5|$|During {{her maiden}} speech on 17 May 1999, Lamont {{was the first}} MSP to use Gaelic at a sitting of the Parliament. She served {{on a number of}} the Parliament's {{committees}} during her first term in office, including the Equal Opportunities Committee, the Local Government Committee and the Social Justice Committee. She became convener of the Social Justice Committee in 2001. In 2000 she became the first Labour MSP to rebel against the Labour-led administration when she threatened to lead backbenchers in voting against a planned Scottish Executive attempt to block the Abolition of Poindings and Warrant Sales Bill, which had been introduced by Sheridan. The move resulted in the withdrawal of the amendment, and a crucial parliamentary vote in favour of the legislation. At a session of First Minister's Questions in 2002, she narrowly avoided becoming the first MSP to be ejected from the parliament after continuing to speak when Presiding Officer David Steel had told <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> down. Steel felt her supplementary question about youth crime was too long, but the incident led to a heated parliamentary debate, and accusations from Lamont's colleague, Labour's Helen Eadie that the Presiding Officer was not treating male and female MSPs equally, an allegation he rejected.|$|E
5|$|During the 2015 season, Fishlock scored {{her first}} {{goal of the}} season during the team's home-opener against Western New York Flash. Her goal in the 25th minute {{was the first of}} the match and assist to Megan Rapinoe in the 86th minute contributed to a 5–1 win for the Reign. During a match against the Washington Spirit on 2 May, Fishlock scored a goal in the 75th minute off an assist from Kim Little {{resulting}} in a 3–1 win over the Spirit. During a match against Sky Blue FC in New Jersey, Fishlock received a controversial red card in the 90th minute that required <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> out the team's next match against league-leading Chicago Red Stars. The controversy stemmed from a scrum in the box after a Sky Blue corner kick and Fishlock's last-minute save on the goal line. Fishlock stated the ball bounced off her head, but Sky Blue forward Nadia Nadim said she blocked it with her hand and the ref awarded Sky Blue the penalty kick. Both matches resulted in 1–1 draws. During the team's second match against Sky Blue FC in Seattle on 6 June, Fishlock scored a goal and an assist earning Player of the Match after leading Seattle to a 3–0 win. She was named NWSL Player of the Week by the media for the ninth week of the season. The Reign finished the regular season in first place clinching the NWSL Shield for the second consecutive time. After advancing to the playoffs, Seattle faced fourth-place team Washington Spirit and won 3–0, advancing to the championship final. Seattle was ultimately defeated 1–0 by FC Kansas City during the championship final in Portland. Fishlock, along with teammates Kim Little, Beverly Yanez, and Lauren Barnes were named to the NWSL Best XI team.|$|E

25|$|May – A 12-year-old girl {{came out}} to her Utah ward as lesbian during a fast and {{testimony}} meeting. During her speech a Stake Presidency member had the mic cut off and told <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> down. A video of the event gained media attention.|$|E
25|$|To make up {{for lack}} of earnings, Parker {{arranged}} for Presley's gold Cadillac to go on tour. Selling it to RCA for $24,000, {{it was used to}} promote Presley's latest film, Frankie & Johnny. The Cadillac tour proved to be somewhat more successful than the film itself. In Houston alone in one afternoon, 40,000 people paid to see it, with one woman offering to have sex with the tour manager if he would allow <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> in it.|$|E
25|$|August 9, 2010: Flight 1052, The {{incident}} {{involved a}} flight attendant after JetBlue Airways Flight 1052 from Pittsburgh to New York City landed. The incident garnered significant media attention when, upon landing, Steven Slater, {{a flight attendant}}, announced over the plane's public address system {{that he had been}} abused by a passenger and that he quit his job. He then grabbed two beers and exited the plane by deploying the evacuation slide and sliding down it. Slater claimed to have been injured by a passenger when he instructed <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> down. Slater's account of the event was not corroborated by others.|$|E

25|$|Roberts was a {{real estate}} {{salesperson}} in 1964 when Abe Hirschfeld hired <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> in the lobby and sell at 925 Park Avenue in New York. She was a condominium broker in 1968 when she met and began her involvement with the then-married multi-millionaire real estate entrepreneur Harry Helmsley. In 1970, she joined one of Helmsley's brokerage firms—Brown, Harris, Stevens—as a senior vice-president. At that time, she was already a millionaire in her own right. Helmsley divorced his wife of 33 years and married Roberts on April 8, 1972. Roberts's marriage to Helmsley may well have saved her career. Late in 1971, several of her tenants sued her for forcing the tenants {{of one of the}} apartments she managed to buy condominiums. They won, and she was forced not only to compensate the tenants but to give them three-year leases. Her real estate license was also suspended, so she focused on running Helmsley's growing hotel empire.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} season, {{she left}} Ford to join Evernham Motorsports' driver development program. During the season, she raced in the ARCA RE/MAX Series and collected 3 top 5's, including a second-place finish, five top 10's, and two poles in six starts. She also made her NASCAR debut that season at Richmond International Raceway driving the No. 6 Dodge for Evernham in the Busch Series. She started 42nd after a wreck in qualifying, {{and proceeded to}} finish 39th after another wreck. In her next start at Dover International Speedway, she qualified ninth, but wrecked eleven laps into the race after being tapped by Justin Labonte. Crocker sustained a cracked rib from the incident forcing <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> out some races she was scheduled to compete in. She ran two more races that season, one for Evernham {{and the other for}} FitzBradshaw Racing, her best finish coming at Memphis Motorsports Park, where she finished 29th for FitzBradshaw in the No. 40 Dodge Charger. She also ran a pair of Truck races for Bobby Hamilton Racing, at Phoenix and Homestead-Miami Speedway. Crocker crashed in both races.|$|E
500|$|According to her account, Lhermitte {{then told}} {{daughter}} Myriam {{that she had}} a surprise for her in the office. When Myriam entered the office, Lhermitte told <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> on a chair and wear a blue handkerchief over her eyes. Once Myriam was seated, Lhermitte took a marble plaque she found nearby and smashed it over Myriam's head, and then cut her throat. Nora, who was allegedly Dr. Schaar's favorite goddaughter, was asked to sit in a chair while Lhermitte slit her throat from behind. After Nora had been killed, Lhermitte wrote the letters [...] "JUD" [...] on the bathroom mirror in Nora's blood, and later stated that she had intended to spell the name [...] "Judas." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1975, at age 22, Schuur {{auditioned for}} drummer/bandleader Ed Shaughnessy. Escorted by her twin brother, she went {{backstage}} {{to seek out}} Shaughnessy after he had finished a concert in Seattle with bandleader Doc Severinsen. Shaughnessy said, [...] "Doc's concert was over and this young blind girl comes in and sits down at the Fender Rhodes keyboard and starts singing the blues. Well, my hair stood on end!" [...] He hired her to be the vocalist in his orchestra, [...] "Energy Force". Jazz trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie heard her and, in 1979, invited <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> in on a set at the Monterey Jazz Festival. According to Dave Gelly in his 2002 book, Stan Getz: Nobody Else But Me, Schuur's performance created [...] "a minor sensation".|$|E
500|$|The {{note was}} printed in neat, all-capital letters with a {{felt-tip}} pen. Its exact wording is unknown, because Cooper later reclaimed it, but Schaffner recalled that it indicated {{he had a}} bomb in his briefcase, and directed <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> beside him. Schaffner did as requested, then quietly asked to see the bomb. Cooper cracked open his briefcase long {{enough for her to}} glimpse eight red cylinders ("four on top of four") attached to wires coated with red insulation, and a large cylindrical battery. After closing the briefcase, he dictated his demands: $200,000 in [...] "negotiable American currency"; four parachutes (two primary and two reserve); and a fuel truck standing by in Seattle to refuel the aircraft upon arrival. Schaffner conveyed Cooper's instructions to the pilots in the cockpit: when she returned, he was wearing dark sunglasses.|$|E
500|$|Thatcher was re-elected for a {{third term}} in 1987. During this period her support for a Community Charge (referred to as the [...] "poll tax") was widely unpopular, and her views on the European Community were not shared by others in her Cabinet. She {{resigned}} as Prime Minister and party leader in November 1990, after Michael Heseltine launched a challenge to her leadership. After retiring from the Commons in 1992, she was given a life peerage as Baroness Thatcher (of Kesteven in the County of Lincolnshire) which entitled <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> in the House of Lords. In 2013 she died of a stroke in London {{at the age of}} 87. Always a controversial figure, she has nonetheless been lauded as one of the greatest, most influential and widest-known politicians in British history, even as arguments over Thatcherism persist.|$|E

500|$|When Cruise first meets Nicole Kidman (Dolly Wells), he asks <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> {{down so that}} he {{will appear}} taller. Cruise {{performs}} his [...] "dangling-from-the ceiling routine" [...] from [...] – while in bed with Kidman. Cruise asks Kidman how he can prove he is not gay, and she recommends that they make the film Eyes Wide Shut. Stanley Kubrick is portrayed as a sleazy film director, and the program shows a newspaper headline giving a critical review of Eyes Wide Shut. The show portrays Cruise's relationship with Penélope Cruz, who is seen wearing a mantilla. Travolta introduces Cruise to his third wife Katie Holmes (Laura Patch) who is depicted as a robotic Stepford Wife. [...] "Greetings, Earth Man, I am here to serve you," [...] says Holmes to Cruise upon their first meeting. After Cruise asks Holmes to marry him, she states, [...] "Affirmative". The show makes fun of Cruise's couch jumping incident on The Oprah Winfrey Show. (This spoof is in reference to a 2005 appearance by Cruise on the Oprah program, where he [...] "jumped around the set, hopped onto a couch, fell to one knee and repeatedly professed his love for his new girlfriend.") At the wedding of Cruise and Holmes, an alien bride and groom are displayed {{on the top of}} the couple's wedding cake, and the show spoofs the couple's wedding vows. A voiceover at the end of the program tells the viewer to visit scientologyisgreat.com and purchase £4,000 worth of books.|$|E
500|$|Later on, Meg knocks Brian out, {{puts him}} {{in the trunk of}} his car and drives away. Chris tells Lois that he saw this, so Lois, Peter, Cleveland, Joe and Quagmire track them down at the Barrington Hotel. When they arrive, they see Meg has tied Brian up with {{packaging}} tape and is about to rape Brian. Lois tells Meg that she is not thinking right, although Meg insists that she has never been more sure of anything in her life. Lois struggles to explain and says Meg does not know what she needs, and then Quagmire says (in an erotic tone) [...] "I know what she needs... Bring her by my house around 8:30 tonight I'll take care of her." [...] This implies that he will try to take advantage of Meg and when she arrives at Quagmire's house, it seems even more likely; he tells <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> down and says [...] "Soon it'll all become clear", puts on seductive music, dims the lights, strips down to a speedo and sits down beside her; but suddenly, Quagmire (uncharacteristically) begins to have a serious heart-to-heart talk with Meg, telling her that her entire life is still ahead of her and she should not be in such a hurry to grow up before assuring her that she will find the right person one day. To help Meg, Quagmire gives her his copy of The Missing Piece to help give her a better perception of things, and sends her away feeling much better. He then walks into his bedroom, where two of his one-night stands await with an array of sex toys, {{and it turns out that}} all of Quagmire's seemingly erotic antics were actually in preparation for this tryst. One of the women asks Quagmire if he has the [...] "hwhip" [...] (with emphasis on the [...] "h") and Quagmire responds with disbelief.|$|E
500|$|Adam Mitchell (Bruno Langley) {{joins the}} Doctor and Rose as {{companion}} {{at the end}} of [...] "Dalek". However, when he tries to smuggle future knowledge from Satellite Five in the year 200,000 back to his own time in [...] "The Long Game" [...] the Doctor expels him from the TARDIS. The Doctor is angry at Rose after he takes her to the event of father Pete Tyler (Shaun Dingwall)'s death and she saves his life, causing a paradox. However, when Pete dies to restore the timeline he shows compassion and encourages <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> by his side as he passes away. After encountering Captain Jack Harkness (John Barrowman) (a con artist and former Time Agent from the 51st century) in 1941, the Doctor realises Harkness had caused a deadly nanotechnological plague to sweep through the human race, turning humans into gas-mask zombies. Following the resolution of the situation, Jack prepares to sacrifice himself, but the Doctor saves him and invites him on board the TARDIS. When the Doctor encounters Blon (Annette Badland), the only Slitheen to survive the Downing Street explosion in present-day Cardiff he has doubts over whether or not to send her home to be executed. During this episode the Doctor first notices that he and Rose had kept coming across the words [...] "Bad Wolf". In the episode [...] "Bad Wolf" [...] the Doctor, Rose and Jack find themselves {{at the mercy of the}} Bad Wolf Corporation based on Satellite Five. However, the true enemy is revealed to be the Daleks, the Dalek Emperor having also survived the Time War and had rebuilt the Dalek race. The Doctor sends Rose back to the 21st century to protect her before attempting to destroy the Dalek army. When he realises that doing this would destroy most of planet Earth he is unable to do so, proclaiming he would rather be a coward than a killer. Having absorbed the energies of the time vortex, Rose is able to return to the Doctor and destroy the Daleks. To save Rose from being killed by harbouring the time vortex, the Doctor removes the harmful effects by kissing her. However, the damage to his cells causes him to regenerate and the Tenth Doctor (David Tennant) takes his place.|$|E
50|$|Eileen Harrington {{was born}} in Kinsale, County Cork, and educated locally at the Convent of Mercy in Kinsale, where {{she was one of}} only two girls in <b>her</b> class <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> the Leaving Certificate examination.

60|$|How {{long she}} {{remained}} thus, crying and half inert with mental anguish and pain, {{she could not}} afterwards have told. Nor did she {{know what it was}} that roused her from this torpor, and caused <b>her</b> suddenly <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> up in <b>her</b> chair, upright, wide-awake, her every sense on the alert.|$|R
60|$|Elaine--she {{had this}} poetic name--fingered her cat timidly, {{not knowing what}} to say or to do, unable even <b>to</b> ask <b>her</b> visitor <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> down. He noticed how her skirt hung almost flat on her hips. She was young, scarce developed, a long, slender thing. Her {{colouring}} was warm and exquisite.|$|R
2500|$|Her art {{background}} {{also made}} her a natural choice to interview artists such as Vladimir Tretchikoff who would later invite <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> for a portrait.

2500|$|Mrs. Van Brugh {{is reading}} letters in Dr. Athelney's home, {{where she has}} been living ever since Smailey has made her penniless. After finally {{dropping}} the last letter – a request for <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> to be photographed by [...] "Scumley and Ripp" [...] – in disgust, she gives vent to her frustration: Her name is now [...] "a word of reproach in every household in the country," [...] her [...] "story a thing to be whispered and hinted at, but not to be openly discussed, for reason of its very shame." [...] Her years of atonement are [...] "held to be mere evidence of skilfully sustained hypocrisy." [...] Even Ruth has left her. Eve tries to comfort her. Mrs. Van Brugh still feels guilty: As Eve has now {{been shown to be}} illegitimate, Eve too will have to suffer, including losing her husband-to-be, Fred. Eve refuses to assign guilt to her mother, insisting she can [...] "see nothing else" [...] but [...] "the perfect woman of the past eighteen years". They embrace.|$|E
