Taking her from their car onto their property, Garrido placed a blanket over Dugard's head and ushered her into an area of his {{backyard}} where sheds and storage units stood, placing her inside a tiny one that was soundproofed. After he finished raping {{her for the first}} time he left her naked <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>structure,</b> which he bolted shut, warning her that Doberman Pinschers were outside and trained to attack her if she tried to escape. Garrido would visit her <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>structure,</b> bringing her food and milkshakes, and talking to her.|$|E

5|$|According to K.C. Aryan, {{the number}} of Matrikas is {{determined}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>structure</b> of the Devanagari alphabet. First is the (A) group which contains the vowels, then the (Ka), (Cha), (Ta), (ta), (Pa), (Ya) and (Ksha) groups. The seven mother goddesses (Saptamatrikas) correspond to the seven consonant groups; when the vocalic (A) group is added to it, the eight mother goddesses (Ashtamatrikas) are obtained. The Shaktas hold that the Mothers preside over impurities (mala) and over sounds of the language. The Mothers were identified with fourteen vowels plus the anusarva and visarga– making their number sixteen.|$|E
5|$|According to Robert van Voren, {{although}} for several years, {{especially after the}} implosion of the USSR and during {{the first years of}} Boris Yeltsin's rule, the positions of the Soviet psychiatric leaders were in jeopardy, now one can firmly conclude that they succeeded in riding out the storm and retaining their powerful positions. They also succeeded in avoiding an inflow of modern concepts of delivering mental health care and a fundamental change <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>structure</b> of psychiatric services in Russia. On the whole, in Russia, the impact of mental health reformers has been the least. Even the reform efforts made in such places as St. Petersburg, Tomsk, and Kaliningrad have faltered or were encapsulated as centrist policies under Putin brought them back under control.|$|E

5|$|Antibiotic drug {{design is}} {{facilitated}} when an enzyme {{that is essential}} to the pathogen's survival is absent or very different in humans. In the example above, humans do not make peptidoglycan, therefore inhibitors of this process are selectively toxic to bacteria. Selective toxicity is also produced in antibiotics by exploiting differences <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>structure</b> of the ribosomes in bacteria, or how they make fatty acids.|$|E
5|$|Bats are {{adapted to}} roosting, hanging upside {{down from their}} feet. The femurs are {{attached}} at the hips {{in a way that}} allows them to bend outward and upward in flight. The ankle joint can flex so as to allow the trailing edge of the wings to bend downwards. However, this design does not permit many movements other than hanging or clambering up trees. Most megabats roost with the head tucked towards the belly, whereas most microbats roost with the neck curled towards the back. This difference is reflected <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>structure</b> of the cervical vertebrae in the two groups, which are clearly distinct. Tendons allow bats to lock their feet closed when hanging from a roost. Muscular power is needed to let go, but not to grasp a perch or when holding on.|$|E

5|$|Marrella was {{the first}} Burgess Shale fossil that Whittington re-examined, and gave the first {{indication}} that surprises were on the way.

5|$|Morchella sextelata is morphologically {{indistinguishable from}} several other morel {{species in the}} M.elata clade, {{including}} M.septimelata, M.brunnea, M.angusticeps, and M.septentrionalis. M.septimelata can be distinguished from these latter three lookalikes by habitat or distribution: M.brunnea is found in non-burned forests of western North America; M.angusticeps is found east of the Rocky Mountains; and M.septentrionalis is restricted to a northern distribution (about 44°N northward) in eastern North America. M.septimelata, however, also grows in burn sites and so is both morphologically and ecologically indistinguishable from M.sextelata. Although there are subtle differences <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>structure</b> of the sterile ridges between the species, the authors were not confident that enough specimens had been examined to establish that these differences were consistent.|$|E

5|$|Phototrophic archaea use {{light to}} produce {{chemical}} {{energy in the}} form of ATP. In the Halobacteria, light-activated ion pumps like bacteriorhodopsin and halorhodopsin generate ion gradients by pumping ions out of the cell across the plasma membrane. The energy stored in these electrochemical gradients is then converted into ATP by ATP synthase. This process is a form of photophosphorylation. The ability of these light-driven pumps to move ions across membranes depends on light-driven changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>structure</b> of a retinol cofactor buried {{in the center of the}} protein.|$|E
5|$|Plutarch cites Aeschines Socraticus, {{who wrote}} a {{dialogue}} on Aspasia (now lost), {{to the effect that}} after Pericles's death, Aspasia lived with Lysicles, an Athenian strategos (general) and democratic leader, with whom she had another son; and that she made him the first man at Athens. Lysicles was killed on expedition to levy subsidies from allies in action in 428 BC With Lysicles' death the contemporaneous record ends. It is unknown, if she was alive when her son, Pericles, was elected general or when he was executed after the Battle of Arginusae. The time of her death that most historians give (c. 401 BC-400 BC) is based on the assessment that Aspasia died before the execution of Socrates in 399 BC, a chronology which is implied <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>structure</b> of Aeschines' Aspasia.|$|E
