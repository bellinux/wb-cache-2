5|$|Diving may be {{performed}} for various reasons, {{both personal and}} professional. Recreational diving is purely for enjoyment and has several specialisations and technical disciplines to provide more scope for varied activities for which specialist training can be offered, such as cave diving, wreck diving, ice diving and <b>deep</b> <b>diving.</b>|$|E
5|$|The main {{inert gas}} in air is {{nitrogen}}, but nitrogen {{is not the}} only gas that can cause DCS. Breathing gas mixtures such as trimix and heliox include helium, which can also cause decompression sickness. Helium both enters and leaves the body faster than nitrogen, so different decompression schedules are required, but, since helium does not cause narcosis, it is preferred over nitrogen in gas mixtures for <b>deep</b> <b>diving.</b>|$|E
5|$|U-6 was {{commissioned}} into the Austro-Hungarian Navy on 1 July 1910, with Linienschiffsleutnant Georg Ritter von Trapp in command. Over {{the next three}} years she served primarily as a training boat, making as many as ten training cruises per month. On 7 November 1911, she hosted a Norwegian naval delegation that inspected her. On 26 June 1912, U-6 was accidentally rammed by the submarine tender Pelikan while surfacing after a <b>deep</b> <b>diving</b> trial.|$|E

50|$|Divers Academy is {{currently}} based in Erial, New Jersey. It moved {{from its original}} campus in Camden, New Jersey to a custom-designed facility in Erial in 2006. The school campus includes a 32-acre 60-foot <b>deep</b> commercial <b>dive</b> training quarry, hyperbaric chamber, Lincoln welding facilities and fully equipped classrooms. In 2013 Divers Academy expanded, adding a custom mixed gas <b>deep</b> <b>dive</b> training facility in Allentown PA.The 50-acre, 300 foot <b>deep</b> <b>dive</b> quarry is the <b>deepest</b> <b>dive</b> training quarry in the US, and is used exclusively for mixed gas <b>deep</b> <b>dive</b> training.|$|R

5|$|The {{arterial}} bubble {{assumption is}} {{also consistent with}} the accidental production of arterial bubbles. One scenario considers a shunt at the heart or lung level that passes bubbles from the venous to the arterial side. A patent foramen ovale (PFO) is thought to only open in certain conditions. A PFO conveniently explains neurological accidents after recreational air diving without any procedure violation, but it does not explain vestibular hits in <b>deep</b> <b>diving.</b> Vestibular symptoms can appear very early in the decompression, long before the massive bubble production required to overload the system.|$|E
5|$|The divers use surface {{supplied}} umbilical diving equipment, utilizing <b>deep</b> <b>diving</b> breathing gas, such as helium {{and oxygen}} mixtures, stored in large capacity, high pressure cylinders. The gas supplies are plumbed {{to the control}} room, where they are routed to supply the system components. The bell is fed via a large, multi-part umbilical that supplies breathing gas, electricity, communications and hot water. The bell also is fitted with exterior mounted breathing gas cylinders for emergency use. The divers are supplied from the bell through umbilicals.|$|E
5|$|Marine mammals {{are able}} to dive {{for long periods of}} time. Both {{pinnipeds}} and cetaceans have large and complex blood vessel systems which serve to store oxygen to support <b>deep</b> <b>diving.</b> Other important reservoirs include muscles, blood, and the spleen which all have the capacity to hold a high concentration of oxygen. They are also capable of bradycardia (reduced heart rate), and vasoconstriction (shunting most of the oxygen to vital organs such as the brain and heart) to allow extended diving times and cope with oxygen deprivation. If oxygen is depleted, marine mammals can access substantial reservoirs of glycogen that support anaerobic glycolysis of the cells involved during conditions of systemic hypoxia associated with prolonged submersion.|$|E

5|$|Pinnipeds have {{a simple}} stomach that is similar in {{structure}} to terrestrial carnivores. Most species have neither a cecum nor a clear demarcation between the small and large intestines; the large intestine is comparatively short and only slightly wider than the latter. Small intestine lengths range from 8 (California sea lion) to 25 times (elephant seal) the body length. The length of the intestine may be an adaptation to frequent <b>deep</b> <b>diving,</b> as the increased volume of the digestive tract serves as an extended storage compartment for partially digested food during submersion. Pinnipeds {{do not have an}} appendix. As in most marine mammals, the kidneys are divided into small lobes and can effectively absorb water and filter out excess salt.|$|E

40|$|During an {{international}} breath-hold diving competition, 19 {{of the participating}} divers volunteered for the present study, aimed at eluci-dating possible symptoms and signs of pulmonary edema after <b>deep</b> <b>dives.</b> Measurements included dynamic spirometry and pulse oxime-try, and chest auscultation was performed on those with the most severe symptoms. After <b>deep</b> <b>dives</b> (25 – 75 m), 12 of the divers had signs of pulmonary edema. None had any symptoms or signs after shallow pool dives. For the whole group of 19 divers, average reductions in forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV 1) were 9 and 12 %, respectively, after <b>deep</b> <b>dives</b> compared with after pool dives. In addition, the average reduction in arterial oxygen saturation (SaO 2) was 4 % after the <b>deep</b> <b>dives.</b> In six divers, respiratory symptoms (including dys-pnea, cough, fatigue, substernal chest pain or discomfort, and hemop-tysis) were associated with aggravated deteriorations in the physio...|$|R

25|$|Divers doing <b>deep</b> <b>diving,</b> cave or wreck penetration, or {{decompression}} stops may routinely carry a complete, independent bailout scuba set {{for their}} own or their buddy's emergency use.

25|$|These can be {{used for}} very deep dives for long periods without the need for decompression, and {{eliminate}} the majority of physiological dangers associated with <b>deep</b> <b>diving.</b> Divers do not even need to be skilled swimmers. Mobility and dexterity are usually restricted by mechanical constraints, and the ergonomics of movement are problematic.|$|E

25|$|Diving {{mask squeeze}} {{enclosing}} {{the eyes and}} nose: The main risk is rupture of the capillaries of the eyes and facial skin because of the negative pressure difference between the gas space and blood pressure, or orbital emphysema from higher pressures. This can be avoided by breathing air into the mask through the nose. Goggles covering only the eyes are not suitable for <b>deep</b> <b>diving</b> as they cannot be equalised.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} in atmospheric pressure suits stagnated in the 1940s through 1960s, as efforts were concentrated on solving {{the problems of}} <b>deep</b> <b>diving</b> by dealing with the physiological problems of ambient pressure diving instead of avoiding them by isolating the diver from the pressure. Although the advances in ambient pressure diving (in particular, with scuba gear) were significant, the limitations brought renewed interest {{to the development of}} the ADS in the late 1960s.|$|E

25|$|Nitrox is {{a popular}} diving gas mix, {{and while it is}} not used for <b>deep</b> <b>diving,</b> it reduces the buildup of {{nitrogen}} in the diver's tissues by increasing the percentage of oxygen in the breathing gas as a substitute for part of the nitrogen. The depth limit of a nitrox mixture is governed by the partial pressure of oxygen, which is generally limited to 1.4 to 1.6 bar depending on the activity of the diver and duration of exposure.|$|E
25|$|Rothschild and Martin {{looked for}} {{evidence}} that mosasaurs {{suffered from the}} bends {{as a result of}} their diving and ascent activities. Avascular necrosis resulting from the bends was completely absent in fossils of the genus Clidastes, suggesting that it preferred to stay near the surface. In contrast, Rothschild and Martin observed avascular necrosis in nearly every specimen of Platecarpus and Tylosaurus that they surveyed. The presence and ubiquity of the avascular necrosis is consistent with the idea that these were <b>deep</b> <b>diving</b> animals.|$|E
25|$|The first uses of hydrox, a {{gas mixture}} of {{hydrogen}} and oxygen {{is used as a}} breathing gas in very <b>deep</b> <b>diving</b> are usually attributed to six ocean dive trials by the Swedish engineer, Arne Zetterström in 1945. Fife later showed that hydrox would allow divers to descend and work at great depths. Fife also developed the first decompression tables {{for the use of the}} mixture. The French engineering company COMEX (Compagnie maritime d'expertises) later applied Fife's work in developing their HYDRA dive series.|$|E
