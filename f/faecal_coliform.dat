30|$|All of {{the water}} samples {{in the current study}} were {{positive}} for <b>faecal</b> <b>coliforms</b> (9.33  cfu/ 100  ml). Similar to our findings, significantly high counts (up to 250  cfu/ 100  ml) of <b>faecal</b> <b>coliforms</b> were analyzed in water samples collected from storage tanks found in Ghana (Akuffo et al. 2013). High counts of <b>faecal</b> <b>coliforms</b> (up to 100  cfu/ 100  ml) were also recorded in household water storage containers in Bahir Dar (Tabor et al. 2011). On the other hand, water samples collected from protected sources were negative for <b>faecal</b> <b>coliforms</b> (Meride and Ayenew 2016). The presence of <b>faecal</b> <b>coliforms</b> in drinking water may affect human health in many ways and it is an indication of the presence of pathogenic bacteria (Mintz et al. 1995). This type of water is not qualified for drinking as 0  cfu/ 100  ml is the recommended guideline. Several factors could be responsible for the presence of <b>faecal</b> <b>coliforms</b> in water storage tanks. For instance, storage tanks cleaning frequency and presence of human or animal faeces can be main driving factors (Cynthia and Schafer 2012). In addition, some of the storage tanks were not covered properly and soil particles and bird faeces could get into the containers that enhance the growth of <b>faecal</b> <b>coliforms.</b> Thus, keeping the water storage tanks clean could improve the microbiological quality of stored water and reduce diarrhoeal and other waterborne diseases in communities (Thompson et al. 2003).|$|R

Water samples were collected twice a month during the period August 2008 to January 2009; from springs on the island of Upolu, Samoa.
