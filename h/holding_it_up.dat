5|$|At {{one point}} during the battle, the flag Moultrie had {{designed}} and raised over the fort was shot down. Sergeant William Jasper reportedly ran to the battlement and raised the flag again, <b>holding</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> and rallying the troops until a flag stand could be provided. He was credited by Moultrie with reviving the troops' spirits, and later given commendations for bravery. A painting of this event (pictured above) depicts Jasper's actions.|$|E
5|$|While there, Nico {{settles into}} camp life; Percy and Blackjack save a sea monster Percy nicknames Bessie; and Artemis's {{lieutenant}} Zoë Nightshade has mysterious dreams about the goddess being in grave danger. Percy has similar dreams about Annabeth saving Luke from being {{crushed by the}} ceiling of some cave and <b>holding</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> for him. Both are unable to act, however, until the Oracle (a shriveled mummy) somehow leaves the attic where it was kept and delivers the Huntress a prophecy. Chiron and Zoë organize a quest, but Percy is forbidden from going because the Hunters refuse to travel with a boy. He successfully sneaks away from camp on Blackjack, though he is almost stopped by Mr. D (Dionysus) who agrees {{to let him go}} because {{there is a good chance}} that Percy will get killed while on the quest.|$|E
5|$|With {{all four}} curses lifted, Link climbs {{on top of}} the Clock Tower at midnight on the third day to confront the Skull Kid again. There and then, he summons the Four Giants, who halt the moon's descent toward Termina by <b>holding</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> with their arms. Now seeing the Skull Kid as a useless puppet, Majora's Mask drops his grip on him and flies up to possess the moon instead. With Tatl at his side, Link follows the Majora's Mask inside the moon and defeats him once and for all, {{returning}} the moon to its proper place in the sky. The Four Giants return to their sleep. Tatl and Tael reunite with the newly liberated Skull Kid. The Happy Mask Salesman takes Majora's Mask, stating it has been purified of its evil power.

500|$|It {{was later}} commented on by William Butler Yeats, who noted that [...] " [...] {{interests}} a critical audience {{today by the}} grotesque tragedy of Danny Deever". T. S. Eliot called the poem [...] "technically (as well as in content) remarkable", <b>holding</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> {{as one of the}} best of Kipling's ballads. Both Yeats and Eliot were writing shortly after Kipling's death, in 1936 and 1941, when critical opinion of his poetry was at a low point; both, nonetheless, drew out Danny Deever for attention as a significant work.|$|E
500|$|Vancouver won {{the first}} game of the series in Chicago 2–1 in double overtime, but fell behind in game two 3–1. During the game the Canucks felt that referee Bob Myers was making {{questionable}} calls against them. A series of events in the third period ignited tempers. First, Vancouver had a goal disallowed. Soon after, there was a perceived non-call against Chicago, followed by a fourth consecutive penalty called against the Canucks. Denis Savard scored on the power play to put the Black Hawks up 4–1. This enraged the Canucks' bench. Assistant coach Ron Smith yelled out [...] "We give up, we surrender, we give up." [...] Williams suggested to Neilson that he throw sticks onto the ice in protest. Neilson noted that he had done that before, and he had a better idea. He proceeded to take a white towel and place it on the end of a hockey stick <b>holding</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> in a mock surrender; some of the Canucks' players followed suit.Neilson was ejected from the game along with two players. Vancouver goaltender, Richard Brodeur later noted that although they lost the game the atmosphere in the dressing room was so positive it was as if they had won.|$|E
2500|$|One medieval {{source in}} Iceland, [...] "Rauðúlfs þáttr", {{mentions}} the sunstone as a mineral {{by means of}} which the sun could be located in an overcast and snowy sky by <b>holding</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> and noting where it emitted, reflected or transmitted light (hvar geislaði úr honum). Sunstones are also mentioned in Hrafns saga Sveinbjarnarsonar (13th century) and in church and monastic inventories (14th–15th century) without discussing their attributes. The sunstone texts of Hrafns saga Sveinbjarnarsonar were copied to all four versions of the medieval hagiography Guðmundar saga góða.|$|E

2500|$|Erste Luftabwehr (First Air Defense). High above {{from the}} rear, a dark-toned, deep droning sound approaches, shortly joined by {{brighter}} music. Deep [...] "sound bombs" [...] explode at periodic intervals. Searchlights leap {{up from the}} crevices of the rock face and scan the sky. Cannon muzzles shaped like trumpet bells are just visible in the precipice. As a chordal sound of high-altitude flight squadrons appears, salvos of anti-aircraft sound missiles shoot skyward. Three times, silver-coloured aircraft are brought spinning downward to crash onto the rock ledge. The rock face opens at the right. A shadowy figure slips out, approaches one of the downed aircraft, and slowly extracts a writhing, miniature human body. After <b>holding</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> {{in the glare of}} the searchlights, the figure disappears back through the rocky door, which closes again [...]|$|E
2500|$|Passing {{the civil}} rights bill in the house {{required}} getting it through the Rules Committee, which had been <b>holding</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> in an attempt to kill it. Johnson decided on a campaign to use a discharge petition to force it onto the house floor. Facing a growing threat that they would be bypassed, the House rules committee approved the bill and moved it {{to the floor of the}} full house, which passed it shortly thereafter by a vote of 290–110. In the Senate, since the tax bill had passed three days earlier, the anti-civil-rights senators were left with the filibuster as their only remaining tool. Overcoming the filibuster required the support of over twenty Republicans, who were growing less supportive due to the fact that their party was about to nominate for president a candidate who opposed the bill. According to Caro, it was ultimately Johnson's ability to convince Republican leader Everett Dirksen to support the bill that amassed the necessary Republican votes to overcome the filibuster in March 1964; after 75 hours of debate, the bill passed the senate by a vote of 71–29. Johnson signed the fortified Civil Rights Act of 1964 into law on July 2. Legend has it that the evening after signing the bill, Johnson told an aide, [...] "I think we just delivered the South to the Republican party for a long time to come", anticipating a coming backlash from Southern whites against Johnson's Democratic Party.|$|E
