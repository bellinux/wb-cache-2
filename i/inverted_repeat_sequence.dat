The <b>sequences</b> around <b>inverted</b> <b>repeats</b> involve all families of repetition frequencies. <b>Inverted</b> <b>repeats</b> are observed as hairpins in electron microscopy. 20 % of hairpins are terminated by a single-stranded spacer ranging from 0. 3 to 1. 5 kb in length.

40|$|The nickel {{resistance}} determinant ncrABCY {{was identified}} in Leptospirillum ferriphilum UBK 03. Within this operon, ncrA and ncrC encode two membrane proteins that form an efflux system, and ncrB encodes NcrB, which belongs to an uncharacterized family (DUF 156) of proteins. How this determinant is regulated remains unknown. Our {{data indicate that}} expression of the nickel resistance determinant is induced by nickel. The promoter of ncrA, designated pncrA, was cloned into the promoter probe vector pPR 9 TT, and co-transformed with either a wild-type or mutant nickel resistance determinant. The results revealed that ncrB encoded a transcriptional regulator that could regulate the expression of ncrA, ncrB, and ncrC. A GC-rich <b>inverted</b> <b>repeat</b> <b>sequence</b> was identified in the promoter pncrA. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) and footprinting assays showed that purified NcrB could specifically bind to the <b>inverted</b> <b>repeat</b> <b>sequence</b> of pncrA in vitro; this was confirmed by bacterial one-hybrid analysis. Moreover, this binding was inhibited {{in the presence of}} nickel ions.

40|$|Two {{naturally}} occurring variations of {{herpes simplex virus}} type 1 (Patton strain) with novel tandem DNA sequence duplications in the S component were isolated, and the DNA was characterized. These variants were identified {{among a number of}} plaque isolates by the appearance of new restriction enzyme fragments that hybridized with radiolabeled DNA from the BamHI Z fragment (map coordinates 0. 936 to 0. 949) located in the unique S region. One isolate, SP 26 - 3, carried a 3. 1 -kilobase-pair duplication defined by recombination between a site in the BamHI Z fragment and a site near the origin of replication in the <b>inverted</b> <b>repeat</b> <b>sequence</b> of the S component carried by the EcoRI H fragment. The other isolate, SP 22 - 4, carried a 3. 5 -kilobase-pair duplication defined by a recombination event between a tandem repeat array in the BamHI Z fragment and a site near the amino terminus of the Vmw 175 gene in the S-region <b>inverted</b> <b>repeat</b> <b>sequence</b> contained in the EcoRI K fragment.

40|$|An {{investigation}} was {{performed with the}} use of physical techniques, to determine the nature and organization of <b>inverted</b> <b>repeat</b> <b>sequences</b> in nuclear DNA fragments from Physarum polycephalum. From the average size of foldback duplexes (550 nucleotide pairs), and the foldback duplex yield as determined by treatment of DNA with S 1 deoxyribonuclease followed by hydroxyapatite chromatography, it is estimated that there are at least 25000 foldback sequences in the Physarum genome. Foldback DNA molecules exhibit properties intermediate between single-stranded DNA and native duplexes on elution from hydroxyapatite with a salt gradient. In addition, thermal-elution chromatography of foldback DNA from hydroxyapatite crystals shows that foldback duplexes are less stable than native DNA. These properties can be explained on the basis that <b>inverted</b> <b>repeat</b> <b>sequences</b> are mismatched when in the foldback configuration. The results of experiments in which the binding of foldback DNA molecules to hydroxyapatite was determined, by using fragments of different single-chain size, agree with previous studies indicating that <b>inverted</b> <b>repeat</b> <b>sequences</b> are located, on average, every 7000 residues throughout the Physarum genome.

40|$|Ferric uptake {{repressor}} (Fur) proteins {{regulate the}} expression of iron homeostasis genes in response to intracellular iron levels. In general, Fur proteins bind with high affinity to a 19 -bp <b>inverted</b> <b>repeat</b> <b>sequence</b> known as the Fur box. An alignment of 19 operator sites recognized by Bacillus subtilis Fur revealed a different conserved 15 -bp (7 - 1 - 7) inverted repeat present twice within this 19 -bp consensus sequence. We demonstrated using electrophoretic mobility shift assays that this 7 - 1 - 7 inverted repeat comprises a minimal recognition site for high-affinity binding by Fur. The resulting revised consensus sequence is remarkably similar to a related 7 - 1 - 7 <b>inverted</b> <b>repeat</b> <b>sequence</b> recognized by PerR, a Fur paralog. Our analysis of the affinity and stoichiometry of DNA binding by B. subtilis Fur, together with a reinterpretation of previously described studies of Escherichia coli Fur, supports a model in which the 19 -bp Fur box represents overlapping recognition sites for two Fur dimers bound to opposite faces of the DNA helix. The resulting recognition complex is reminiscent of that observed for the functionally related protein DtxR. Like Fur, DtxR contains a helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif, recognizes a 19 -bp <b>inverted</b> <b>repeat</b> <b>sequence,</b> and has a typical DNase I footprint of ∼ 30 bp. By envisioning a similar mode of DNA recognition for Fur, we can account for the internal symmetries noted previously within the Fur box, the tendency of Fur to extend into adjacent regions of DNA in a sequence-selective manner, and the observed patterns of DNA protection against enzymatic and chemical probes...|$|E

40|$|An <b>inverted</b> <b>repeat</b> <b>sequence,</b> {{extending}} from the 5 ' untranslated region of the first exon through the translation initiation codon, is highly conserved in the alpha 1 (I), alpha 2 (I) and alpha 1 (III) collagen genes of mammals and birds.

When the upstream axis of the dyad of symmetry was deleted, the efficiency of translation of transcripts from a human alpha 1 (I) collagen-bovine growth hormone fusion gene was unchanged in either transiently or stably transfected cells. Furthermore, mRNA levels were not affected when the same deletion was transferred to a collagen-human growth hormone fusion gene in which the collagen sequence retained the first intron. Examination of human alpha 1 (I) DNA, {{extending from}} the start of transcription to the start of translation, by the DNAse I protection procedure revealed evidence for protein binding to a sequence just upstream of the <b>inverted</b> <b>repeat</b> <b>sequence</b> but not to the inverted repeat itself.

40|$|A {{method is}} {{described}} for isolation of <b>inverted</b> <b>repeat</b> DNA <b>sequences</b> {{that occur in}} E. coli plasmids. The procedures of the isolation involved: (a) denaturation of intact plasmid DNA, (b) a rapid, 30 sec, renaturation of inverted-repeat sequences in the genome, (c) digestion of the single-stranded portion by S 1 nuclease to recover duplex DNA, and (d) detection and purification of the duplexes using 1. 4 % agarose gel electrophoresis. If a plasmid DNA carried <b>inverted</b> <b>repeats</b> of either one type or {{two different types of}} special DNA sequences, these procedures enabled us to observe either one or two characteristic DNA bands, respectively, in the agarose gels. If a plasmid DNA did not carry any <b>inverted</b> <b>repeats,</b> or if the plasmid DNA only carried direct <b>repeat</b> <b>sequences,</b> no characteristic DNA bands were recovered. Cleavage of the spacer DNA between <b>inverted</b> <b>repeat</b> <b>sequences</b> generated no gel bands. This indicated that the <b>inverted</b> <b>repeat</b> <b>sequences</b> must be in the same strand.

40|$|NikR is a nickel-responsive ribbon-helix-helix {{transcription}} factor present in many bacteria and archaea. The DNA binding properties of Escherichia coli and Helicobacter pylori NikR (factors EcNikR and HpNikR, respectively) have revealed variable features of DNA recognition. EcNikR represses a single operon by binding {{to a perfect}} <b>inverted</b> <b>repeat</b> <b>sequence,</b> whereas HpNikR binds to promoters from multiple genes that contain poorly conserved inverted repeats. These differences are {{due in large part}} to variations in the amino acid sequences of the DNA-contacting β-sheets, as well as residues preceding the β-sheets of these two proteins. We present here evidence of another variation in DNA recognition by the NikR protein from Geobacter uraniireducens (GuNikR). GuNikR has an Arg-Gly-Ser β-sheet that binds specifically to an <b>inverted</b> <b>repeat</b> <b>sequence</b> distinct from those recognized by Ec- or HpNikR. The N-terminal residues that precede the GuNikR β-sheet residues are required for high-affinity DNA binding. Mutation of individual arm residues dramatically reduced the affinity of GuNikR for specific DNA. Interestingly, GuNikR tetramers are capable of binding cooperatively to the promoter regions of two different genes, nik(MN) 1 and nik(MN) 2. Cooperativity was not observed for the closely related G. bemidjiensis NikR, which recognizes the same operator sequence. The cooperative mode of DNA binding displayed by GuNikR could affect the sensitivity of transporter gene expression to changes in intracellular nickel levels...|$|E
40|$|Large DNA palindromes form {{sporadically}} in many eukaryotic and prokaryotic genomes and {{are often}} associated with amplified genes. The presence of a short <b>inverted</b> <b>repeat</b> <b>sequence</b> near a DNA double-strand break has been implicated {{in the formation of}} large palindromes in a variety of organisms. Previously we have established that in Saccharomyces cerevisiae a linear DNA palindrome is efficiently formed from a single-copy circular plasmid when a DNA double-strand break is introduced next to a short <b>inverted</b> <b>repeat</b> <b>sequence.</b> In this study we address whether the linear palindromes form by an intermolecular reaction (that is, a reaction between two identical fragments in a head-to-head arrangement) or by an unusual intramolecular reaction, as it apparently does in other examples of palindrome formation. Our evidence supports a model in which palindromes are primarily formed by an intermolecular reaction involving homologous recombination of short inverted repeat sequences. We have also extended our investigation into the requirement for DNA double-strand break repair genes in palindrome formation. We have found that a deletion of the RAD 52 gene significantly reduces palindrome formation by intermolecular recombination and that deletions of two other genes in the RAD 52 -epistasis group (RAD 51 and MRE 11) have little or no effect on palindrome formation.

40|$|Abstract Background Wheat gluten has unique {{nutritional}} {{and technological}} characteristics, {{but is also}} a major trigger of allergies and intolerances. One of the most severe diseases caused by gluten is coeliac disease. The peptides produced in the digestive tract by the incomplete digestion of gluten proteins trigger the disease. The majority of the epitopes responsible reside in the gliadin fraction of gluten. The location of the multiple gliadin genes in blocks has to date complicated their elimination by classical breeding techniques or {{by the use of}} biotechnological tools. As an approach to silence multiple gliadin genes we have produced 38 transgenic lines of bread wheat containing combinations of two endosperm-specific promoters and three different <b>inverted</b> <b>repeat</b> <b>sequences</b> to silence three fractions of gliadins by RNA interference. Results The effects of the RNA interference constructs on the content of the gluten proteins, total protein and starch, thousand seed weights and SDSS quality tests of flour were analyzed in these transgenic lines in two consecutive years. The characteristics of the <b>inverted</b> <b>repeat</b> <b>sequences</b> were the main factor that determined the efficiency of silencing. The promoter used had less influence on silencing, although a synergy in silencing efficiency was observed when the two promoters were used simultaneously. Genotype and the environment also influenced silencing efficiency. Conclusions We conclude that to obtain wheat lines with an optimum reduction of toxic gluten epitopes one needs {{to take into account the}} factors of <b>inverted</b> <b>repeat</b> <b>sequences</b> design, promoter choice and also the wheat background used.

We {{have investigated the}} ability of <b>inverted</b> <b>repeat</b> <b>sequences</b> to stimulate deletion of flanking direct repeats in Escherichia coli. Propensity for cruciform extrusion in duplex DNA correlated with stimulation of flanking deletion, which was partially sbcD dependent.

The SbcCD-dependent mechanism is initiated by SbcCD cleavage of cruciforms in duplex DNA followed by RecA-independent single-strand annealing at the flanking direct repeats, generating a deletion. Analysis of deletion endpoints is consistent with this model. We propose that the SbcCD-independent pathway involves replication slipped mispairing, evoked from stalling at hairpin structures formed on the single-stranded lagging-strand template. The skew of SbcCD-independent deletion endpoints {{with respect to the}} direction of replication supports this hypothesis. Surprisingly, {{even in the absence of}} palindromes, SbcD affected the location of deletion endpoints, suggesting that SbcCD-mediated strand processing may also accompany deletion unassociated with secondary structures...|$|R
