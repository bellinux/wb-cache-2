50|$|The average {{path length}} distinguishes an <b>easily</b> <b>negotiable</b> network from one, which is {{complicated}} and inefficient, with a shorter average path length being more desirable. However, the average path length is simply what the path length {{will most likely}} be. The network itself might have some very remotely connected nodes and many nodes, which are neighbors of each other.|$|E
50|$|The {{trail to}} the summit <b>easily</b> <b>negotiable</b> {{most of the way}} but the last 1.5 mi is along a {{razorback}} ridge with significant exposure. This is the Northwest Ridge, Trail Number 644, which actually starts in the Sauk River Valley on the southwest side of the mountain. The total elevation gain is almost exactly one mile (5280 ft).|$|E
50|$|The K-3, {{developed}} in South Africa, {{is a recent}} addition to the sprint kayak class which previously consisted of the K1, K2 and K4. The K3 is particularly well suited to the Fish River with a relatively rock-free river bed and <b>easily</b> <b>negotiable</b> weirs. Demonstrating this in 2009, Matt Bouman, Herman Chalupsky and Andrew Birkett paddled their K3 to a 5h 9m finish, coming in just outside the top 10 overall.|$|E
50|$|The pass {{is easily}} {{traversable}} by most vehicles, never reaching above the treeline and featuring <b>easily</b> <b>negotiable</b> curves along an amply wide highway. The approach {{on the eastern}} side is fairly gentle, ascending from near Grant up a gulch at the headwaters of the North Fork. The western side of the pass has a steeper ascent, winding up the flank of a mountainside east of the town of Jefferson. An overlook {{on the west side of}} the pass offers a panoramic view of South Park. The top of the pass is nearly flat and surrounded by the Pike National Forest, with a National Forest Service campground on the summit.|$|E
50|$|The pass {{traverses}} {{the continental}} divide north of Leadville in {{a gap between}} the northern end of the Sawatch Range to the west and the northern end of the Mosquito Range to the east. It connects the headwaters of the Arkansas River to the south with the upper valley of the Eagle River (in the watershed of the Colorado River) to the north. The pass is traversed by U.S. Highway 24, allowing access between Leadville and Interstate 70 in the Eagle Valley. The pass has a gentle approach on both sides with few steep gradients and no major hairpin curves. The summit of the pass is nearly level. The road over the pass is generally open all year round, <b>easily</b> <b>negotiable</b> by most vehicles, and closes only during severe winter storms.|$|E
40|$|In {{their recent}} article in this journal, Demont et al. (2009) discuss the effects of {{alternative}} spatial ex ante coexistence regulations (SEACERs) {{in the context of}} the EU regulatory framework. We retain from Demont et al. (2009) that small pollen barriers should be considered as a possible regulatory option in all identifiable situations in which they are as effective as large isolation distances. This idea is in accordance with the proportionality principle of the 2003 EC Recommendation. But further analysis of how consumer choice and consumer welfare are affected should be conducted before supporting the idea that SEACERs should be flexible, that is that GMO farmers should always have the option of paying their non-GMO neighbours to implement the SEACERs in their own fields. We reject the authors' argument that pollen barriers are necessarily more <b>easily</b> <b>negotiable</b> among neighbours (more "flexible") than are isolation distances. We contest the relation of proportionality to the size of market signals for IP products. We contest the idea of shifting coexistence regulation from ex ante to ex post. We believe that any economic analysis of coexistence measures should include their welfare effects on consumers as well as on producers.

40|$|Purpose: We {{evaluate}} here {{our experience}} with modified Cantwell–Ransley technique described by Gearhart for correction of isolated continent epispadias in adults {{with respect to}} its long-term functional outcome and complications. Introduction: Isolated male epispadias is a rare anomaly with a reported incidence of 1 in 11, 700 males. Many surgical techniques with various modifications described to correct epispadias as treatment are debatable and challenging. The majority of the cases are treated at childhood as clinical presentation is striking at birth; hence, presentation in adulthood is extremely rare. Materials and Methods: During the past 5 years, modified Cantwell–Ransley technique described by Gearhart was performed in five cases of isolated continent epispadias which includes two cases of proximal penile, two distal penile and one penopubic. All cases were fresh except one had prior failed repair. Corporal rotation was done by delayed absorbable sutures without incision and anastomosis and suprapubic diversions placed in all the cases. Results: All cases followed up ranging from 6 months to 5 years and were having horizontal and downwards angled penis. No case had urethrocutaneous fistula or stricture. One case had superficial skin infection which healed by secondary intention did not require any secondary procedure. All cases maintained erection post-operatively too. Catheterisation with soft tube revealed <b>easily</b> <b>negotiable</b> channel in all cases on follow-up. Conclusion: Modified Cantwell–Ransley repair described by Gearhart has excellent cosmetic, functional and anatomical results in isolated continent epispadias in the adult...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the Scottish National Party (SNP) {{with respect to}} two of its most defining defence policies: its opposition to nuclear weapons, wanting to rid Scotland of the UK s nuclear deterrent based there, and its policy regarding a Scottish membership to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO). It is a historical analysis of how the policies developed from the SNP s national breakthrough in the late 1960 s, leading up {{to a discussion of}} the current situation where the party is playing {{a leading role in the}} ongoing campaign ending in an independence referendum on 18 September 2014. This inquiry argues that most scholars, journalists and military experts have understated the SNP s morally founded opposition to nuclear weapons, implying, for example, that the party would give up its policy in a situation where the rUK and NATO demanded it. By analysing how the policies have developed in the last four to five decades, we stress that the antagonism against nuclear weapons is deeply rooted in morality and therefore not <b>easily</b> <b>negotiable</b> in a possible settlement negotiation between Scotland and the rest of the UK. The NATO policy, however, has been much more wavering, from staunch opponents of a Scottish membership, to the current policy of wanting to apply if Scotland becomes an independent state, though only on conditions of removing the UK s nuclear deterrent from Scotland. This last aspect underlines why it has been important to look at both policies, since they are very much intertwined, though with very different developments and foundations...|$|E
