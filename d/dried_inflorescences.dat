Over the years, the phytochemistry of the genus Sideritis has been studied, and various terpenoids, sterols, coumarins and especially flavonoid aglycones and glycosides have been identified. In particular, species from the Balkan Peninsula have been studied and were found to be rich in flavonoids, with valuable antioxidant activity. In the folk medicine of the Balkan countries, Sideritis raeseri is used as a herbal tea in the treatment of inflammation, gastrointestinal disorders and coughs, and also as a tonic, whereas extracts are used as a component of dietary supplements for anaemia.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the stability of}} rutin in the inflorescences of the elder during processing. Elder (Sambucus nigra L.) is a medicinal plant that was used for medical purposes as early as in the Middle Ages. Both flowers (Flos Sambuci) and fruit (Fructus Sambuci) of the elder are {{on the list of}} official medicinal products of the State Institute for Drug Control. The main active phenolic substance is flavonoid rutin. Flavonoids are phenolic substances of plant origin. Among the best known properties of these substances is their antioxidant activity. They protect the low density blood lipoproteins from the oxidation modifications that cause the development of arteriosclerosis and hypertension. As a medical plant, the elder is used especially for the preparation of a medicinal drink. It is also commonly used as a material for the preparation of syrup. This product serves as a basis for a refreshing and tasty drink and lately is has also started to be sold in shops. For comparison, five single-flower syrups from the elderflower by different producers were bought. A method of preparation of the elderflower syrup was devised, based in one case on frozen elder inflorescences and in the other on <b>dried</b> <b>inflorescences.</b> The plant material came from wildly growing shrubs and it was collected in June 2013. Altogether, 8 syrups were prepared in the laboratory, 4 of them from fresh material and 4 from dried material. Two different methods were used. The first one was based on extraction using sugar solution, the second one on extraction using water solution where sugar was added afterwards. Another added substance was ethanol. The method for measuring the amount of rutin in the samples was a combination of two extraction steps. The first step was the usual exraction using aqueous methanol and the second step was extraction using a solid sorbent (SPE). The analysis of fresh and dried material concluded that dried elderflowers contain many times more rutin than fresh elder. Among the commercially produced syrups, the "Kitl Syrob Bezový" contained most rutin; a little less rutin was found in "Hamé Bylinný sirup Bezový květ". The concentration of rutin in the syrups prepared in the laboratory was much higher than in the commercial products. By using different methods of syrup preparation and their subsequent analysis, {{it was found that the}} syrups prepared from the <b>dried</b> <b>inflorescences</b> contained a higher amount of rutin than the syrups produced in the same way, but from frozen material. Addition of a small amount of ethanol had no effect on extraction of rutin from inflorescences. Free quercetin, which indicate a decomposition of rutin, wasn´t found in any of produced syrups. The produced syrups were used for the preparation of a drink and then underwent sensory analysis. The paired two-sided preference test included pairs of drinks consisting of a fresh elder drink and dried elder drink. The results showed that the evaluators preferred syrups from dried elderflowers in two of the cases, while in the other two evaluated pairs, the results were not statistically significant. In all cases, the evaluators most often found small and middle differences. The gained results show that the best method of syrup preparation uses dried plant material and sucrose solution as the extraction agent. The syrup prepared in this way contained most rutin and at the same time showed the smallest losses of this substance, which is beneficial to human health. Furthermore, it also tasted better in comparison with syrup prepared in the same way, but from fresh material...|$|E

40|$|Introduction With the {{continuous}} growth of world population, degradation and ecological imbalance throughout the world, {{there is a}} need to increase agricultural production and environmental protection measures. In this respect, efforts to supply nutrients to the environment are at the head of the programs. One of the ways to approach this goal is the use of intercropping systems (Najafi & Mohammadi, 2005 (. Suitable performance in intercropping systems may be achieved by selecting genotypes possessing traits consistent with and appropriate for establishing minimum and maximum synergy and competition employing proper agronomic practices such as density and planting pattern (Mutungamiri et al., 2001). In this context, selected plants should be less competitive in terms of environmental impact. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of different planting patterns on the competition between the two species of Calendula and soybean and to evaluate the yield and quality of an intercropping system compared with a mono-cropping system. Materials and Methods In order to evaluate the competition between soybean and calendula, a field experiment was conducted based on randomized complete block design with 7 treatments and 3 replications in the research farm of the Faculty of Agriculture, the University of Tabriz in 2009. The treatments included pure stands for both species, 1 : 1, 2 : 2, 4 : 2, 4 : 4 and 6 : 4 for soybean and calendula number of rows per strip, respectively. Before planting, soybean seeds were inoculated with Bradyrhyzobium japonicum. Before harvesting, the number of pods per plant, seeds per plant, 1000 - grain weight, grain yield, percentage of oil and protein of soybean grain were measured in 10 randomly selected plants. The number of flowers per plant, <b>dry</b> <b>inflorescence</b> weight and <b>dry</b> petal weight of Calendula were recorded. The harvest of flowers of calendula began on July 30 and harvesting was done every 15 days in six steps. It was continued to mid-October. Total dry petals and sepals of 6 withdrawals flower per plot were considered as <b>inflorescence</b> <b>dry</b> weight. The land equivalent ratio (LER), actual yield loss (AYL), relative crowding coefficient (RCC), aggressivity (A) and competitive ratio (CR) were determined at the end of the growing season. For statistical analysis, analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Duncan’s multiple range test (DMRT) were performed using MSTAT-C. Results and Discussion The results showed that the effect of planting pattern on the number of pods per plant, seeds per plant, 1000 -grain weight, grain yield of soybean, percentage of oil and protein contents of soybean was not significant. The effect of planting pattern on <b>inflorescence</b> <b>dry</b> weight and dry petal weight of calendula was significant. Row and strip intercropping 6 : 4 produced greater <b>dry</b> <b>inflorescence</b> weight and <b>dry</b> petal weight than calendula monoculture.

We recommend leaf extraction only from individuals with stem over 3 m and with more than 25 expanded leaves. Inflorescence production of A. butyracea gives the palm a potential for sap extraction. </div...|$|R
40|$|Interspecific {{hybridisation}} {{with the}} close relative, Trifolium nigrescens (Ball clover) {{is a possible}} strategy to achieve increased reproductive potential of white clover (Trifolium repens). Fertile F 1 plants {{have been used as}} the basis for two generations of backcrossing to T. repens as the recurrent parent. F 1 and backcrossed plants were assessed in both glasshouse and field for a range of morphological traits, including inflorescence production, and the level of water soluble carbohydrates in the stolons. Plants resulting from two generations of backcrossing had an increased allocation of <b>dry</b> matter to <b>inflorescence</b> production in comparison with T. repens. Variation within these plants for agronomic traits (e. g. stolon length, dry weights etc.) suggests that selection for these traits is feasible and in combination with increased inflorescence production offers a potentially valuable approach to germplasm improvement in white clover.
