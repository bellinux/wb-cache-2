5|$|The Pitch Document {{described}} Avatars as {{sharing the}} ability to <b>envision</b> <b>the</b> past, present and future, both literally and symbolically. Accessing this plane of pure truth is given as an Avatar's birthright and can be improved through study and practice. Avatars can manipulate and transmit the resulting visions through dreams to others. As far as established, only Creatures of Darkness suffer physical weakness or pain when their opposite makes use of his powers. Avatars can sense the existence of their moral opponent, but are unable to detect or identify them outside of close physical proximity. They can, however, easily detect and locate an Avatar of like kind over great distances with great accuracy. These abilities contribute to the convergence of the two storylines in Carnivàle.|$|E

25|$|Still imagining President Franklin D.

The Socialist Party, for its part, remained skeptical, having been on the receiving end of more than a decade's worth of vilification and violence.|$|E
25|$|Another primary {{advantage}} to imagination is that, {{though it is}} contextualized by physical elements and time, it is not entirely subject to them, therefore enabling the kind of creativity they need to imagine possibilities not readily visible in their physical world and further weigh alternatives. Put otherwise, imagination provides “the means for navigating between our experiences in conversations and practices, and the theories we develop about our selves, our lives, and our world.” Through discourse, it also enables people to <b>envision</b> <b>the</b> experiences of others in their minds and by so doing invoke a deeper understanding and empathy toward others. Martin and Sugarman write {{that this kind of}} empathic envisioning is instrumental to therapeutically conceptualizing and understanding the clients with which therapists work.|$|E
25|$|Hermeneutic counselors {{advocate}} his {{same process}} {{can be used in}} counseling to <b>envision</b> <b>the</b> bodily experiences of others in reality. For example, a client may present with tears while verbalizing feelings of pain and humiliation in response to a break up with a significant other. A therapist, using his memory of past embodied experiences of relationship heartache, can empathically envision in his imagination very closely to what the client is experiencing, therefore sharing that experience with the client and in turn enabling him to authentically relate to the client. Furthermore, this is precisely what enables the therapist and the client to work together to imagine new therapeutic possibilities. Mensch states that this capacity of human beings necessitates their responsibility to relate to and understand others as best they can. Humans may not always be able to, or entirely be able to, but their co-existence as embodied beings demands that they make the attempt.|$|E

25|$|James Mensch {{provided}} {{an understanding of}} imagining the experiences of others (what can also be called empathic envisioning) and what that might look like {{when he talked about}} literary imagination humans: the capacity of humans to imagine the experiences of characters in novels. Mensch explained that human beings' embodiment provides them with the capacity to imagine these experiences and then relate to them through empathy. For Mensch, people are only capable of having experiences because of and through their body. Humans (Dasein) experience life, others, the world, etc. via their bodies which can taste, smell, hear, feel, and see. More to the point, their bodies encapsulate our various mental faculties required for processing and retaining those experiences. This means human experiences are experiences of the body. Relating to others then is when two bodies experience one another: they inter-relate. Because humans (Dasein) hold their bodily experiences in their memory, they are able to use our literary imagination to <b>envision</b> <b>the</b> experiences of characters in novels.|$|E
25|$|During {{the first}} half of the 20th century, the Pacific Coast League {{developed}} into one of the premier regional baseball leagues. The cities enfranchised by the other two high-minor leagues, the International League and the American Association, were generally coordinated geographically with the major leagues, but such was not the case with the PCL. With no major league baseball team existing west of St. Louis, the PCL was unrivaled for American west coast baseball. Although it was never recognized as a true major league, its quality of play was considered very high. Drawing from a strong pool of talent in the area, the PCL produced many outstanding players, including such future major-league Hall of Famers as Joe DiMaggio, Ted Williams, Tony Lazzeri, Paul Waner, Earl Averill, Bobby Doerr, Joe Gordon, and Ernie Lombardi. Amid success experienced after World War II, league President Pants Rowland began to <b>envision</b> <b>the</b> PCL as a third major league. During 1945 the league voted to become a major league. However, the American League and National League were uninterested in allowing it to join their ranks.|$|E
25|$|However, Waltrip {{was quick}} to {{recognize}} the new and rapid expansion of the sport's popularity, evolving and expanding interest in NASCAR, even among housewives, teens and young adults, and others never before considered NASCAR fans, all primarily due to increasing national network and cable subscription television which televised almost every NASCAR event live, and the growing interest of new family oriented sponsors never before associated with motorsports. NASCAR was becoming a multi-regional, multi-racial, and multi-national and multi-cultural sport enjoyed by men, women and children alike. In addition to the huge influx of money from new sponsors and television, the more astute NASCAR team owners immediately embraced new resources, such as computers, telemetry, research and development, multi-car teams for information sharing, wind-tunnel testing, and the procurement of aerodynamicist, computer modelers, and structural engineers. Waltrip, now one of two drivers for Johnson, {{was quick to}} <b>envision</b> <b>the</b> future of NASCAR and sought {{to take advantage of}} the coming changes, something his car owner, Junior Johnson, although a pioneer of the sport, was somewhat reluctant to embrace. Afterall, Johnson had enjoyed success for decades and won numerous races and championships spanning decades using his own formulas for success.|$|E

500|$|Stanton {{took one}} of the early circus bug {{character}}s, Red the red ant, and changed him into the character Flik. The Circus Bugs, no longer out to cheat the colony, would be embroiled in a comic misunderstanding as to why Flik was recruiting them. Lasseter agreed with this new approach, and comedy writers Donald McEnery and Bob Shaw spent a few months working on further polishing with Stanton. The characters [...] "Tuck and Roll" [...] were inspired by a drawing that Stanton did of two bugs fighting {{when he was in the}} second grade.

500|$|Creator Stephen Hillenburg {{initially}} conceived SpongeBob SquarePants in 1984, {{while he}} was teaching and studying marine biology at {{what is now the}} Orange County Ocean Institute. During this period, Hillenburg became fascinated with animation, and wrote a comic book entitled The Intertidal Zone ,starring various anthropomorphic forms of sea life, many of which would evolve into SpongeBob SquarePants characters, including [...] "Bob the Sponge", who was the co-host of the comic and resembled an actual sea sponge, as opposed to SpongeBob, who resembles a kitchen sponge. In 1987, Hillenburg left the institute to pursue his dream of becoming an animator, and began to <b>envision</b> <b>the</b> possible concept of a project involving anthropomorphic sea life. He then later started drawing several rough sketches. In 1992, Hillenburg began to attend the California Institute of the Arts to study animation, having been accepted into the institute by Jules Engel, who was impressed with Hillenburg's previous work.|$|E
