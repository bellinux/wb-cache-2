40|$|The {{discrepancy}} between the event based supervisory control theory and its signal based implementation in programmable logic controllers using sequential <b>function</b> <b>charts</b> is explored. Different execution models and the related problems are discussed. Specifically, synchronisation of sequential <b>function</b> <b>charts</b> is treated {{in the context of}} modular implementation of the control functions. The supervisory control theory requires that conflicting events are never generated. This is guaranteed by the synchronous execution of events present in all modules. However, in a signal based environment the synchronous “execution of events” is not well defined. We propose an event monitor to resolve this problem...|$|R

Ladder logic), and the structuring tool Sequential <b>Function</b> <b>Chart.</b>|$|E

40|$|Sequential <b>function</b> <b>charts</b> (SFCs) {{are defined}} as a {{modeling}} language in the IEC 1131 - 3 standard [1] {{and can be used}} to structure and drive programmable logic controllers (PLCs). It includes interesting concepts as hierarchy, history variables and priority. As the typical application area of this language is the control of industrial processes, it is obvious that safety and reliability is a crucial goal for systems using SFCs. In this work we give an abstract formal model for SFCs and present a method to automatically verify properties concerning the safety of such systems using the model checking tool SMV (Symbolic Model Verifier) [2, 3].

40|$|The dynamic {{modelling}} {{of logical}} systems widely calls upon the explicit {{use of time}} and the event notion. In terms of <b>Function</b> <b>Chart</b> Grafcet or Interpreted Petri Nets for instance, events are generally represented by "rising or falling edges" of logical variables. However, numerous ambiguities are encountered in the models because the translation of events into edges is not formal enough. In this paper, we propose a theory of binary signal which allows us to describe the time behavior of the inputs and the outputs of any logical system. We especially describe an extended Boolean Algebra. In this algebra, we have defined two unary operations in order to formally express the events. Then, we give ten properties related to these rising and falling edge operations and their composition with the operations AND, OR, and NOT. Key-Words: Sequential <b>Function</b> <b>Chart</b> (S. F.
