5|$|Australia {{headed south}} to The Oval for the Fifth Test. Barnes resumed his opening position, while Hassett {{returned}} to <b>his</b> <b>customary</b> {{position in the}} middle order. England won the toss and elected to bat on a rain-affected pitch. Propelled by Ray Lindwall's 6/20, Australia skittled England for 52 in 42.1 overs on the first afternoon.|$|E
5|$|England faced {{a target}} of 596, which would have {{required}} a world record Test run-chase—no team had successfully chased down more than 400 for victory. Early on, Washbrook pulled Lindwall for a four, almost collecting Barnes in the nose in <b>his</b> <b>customary</b> short leg position. Australia bowled out the hosts for 186 to win by 409 runs and take a 2–0 lead.|$|E

50|$|After over 100 {{games at}} Rotherham his knack for {{promotions}} was spotted by then Reading manager Alan Pardew who at first, took Watson on loan before signing him permanently in March 2002 for £150,000 - where he promptly repeated the trick, guiding the Royals to promotion from League One, in <b>his</b> now <b>customary</b> second place.|$|R
50|$|In the 2014-15 season, Calver {{spent time}} playing at right-back, {{as well as}} <b>his</b> more <b>customary</b> centre-back role. In February 2015, Calver was slapped by a Western Sydney Wanderers fan after {{watching}} the Sydney Derby; he declined to press charges from the incident. In April 2015, Calver signed a new two-year deal with Sydney.|$|R
5|$|On March 20, 2009, Rodríguez {{signed a}} one-year deal worth $1.5million with the Houston Astros. Rodríguez {{was given the}} {{opportunity}} to make an additional $1.5million in performance bonuses. In a situation similar to his tenure with the Yankees, <b>his</b> <b>customary</b> number 7 had been retired by the Astros in honor of Craig Biggio, so Rodríguez initially wore jersey number 12, then later changed to number 77 mid-season.|$|E
5|$|In {{the next}} match, against Leicestershire, Bradman won the toss and elected to bat, {{promoting}} Keith Miller ahead of himself to No. 3. As Miller {{came out to}} bat, the large crowd mobbed the players' entrance only to see that Bradman was not batting in <b>his</b> <b>customary</b> position. Bradman came to the crease at 2/157, and after initially being troubled by the left-arm unorthodox spin of Australian expatriate Jack Walsh, added 159 with Miller before falling for 81. Australia compiled 448 and bowled out the home side for 130 and 147 to win by an innings, with Bradman taking one catch.|$|E
5|$|On July 11, 2012, the Los Angeles Lakers {{acquired}} Nash in a sign-and-trade {{deal with}} Phoenix. Nash also considered signing with New York or Toronto, {{but he decided}} that Los Angeles was the best fit {{for him and his}} family. Nash switched his jersey number, as <b>his</b> <b>customary</b> No. 13 was retired by Los Angeles in honour of Wilt Chamberlain. Nash, an avid soccer fan, chose No. 10 to pay homage to Glenn Hoddle, Zinedine Zidane, Lionel Messi and other soccer playmakers who wore the number. Entering his 17th NBA season, Nash came to the Lakers with concerns over his defense and the health of his back.|$|E

5|$|Hassett had a {{new role}} as the teams headed to Headingley for the Fourth Test. He would improvise and open with Morris, as regular opener Sid Barnes was injured. Hassett dropped Len Hutton—who went on to score 81—on 25. Hassett {{struggled}} {{to make an impact}} in the unfamiliar role, scoring 13 and 17. However, the other Australian batsmen stepped up and scored 3/404 in 330 minutes on the final day to set a new world record for the highest successful Test runchase, ensuring an unassailable 3–0 series lead. Hassett scored two fifties in the lead-up to the Fifth Test, where he returned to <b>his</b> <b>customary</b> role with the return of Barnes. Hassett took a diving catch in the first innings and scored 37 in an innings win. Australia thus won the series convincingly 4–0 and Hassett finished the series with 310 runs at 44.29.|$|E
5|$|He used actors {{of diverse}} backgrounds, from famous film stars {{to people who}} {{had never seen a}} film (as in Aparajito). Robin Wood and others have lauded him as the best {{director}} of children, pointing out memorable performances in the roles of Apu and Durga (Pather Panchali), Ratan (Postmaster) and Mukul (Sonar Kella). Depending on the talent or experience of the actor, Ray varied the intensity of his direction, from virtually nothing with actors such as Utpal Dutt, to using the actor as a puppet (Subir Banerjee as young Apu or Sharmila Tagore as Aparna). Actors who had worked for Ray praised <b>his</b> <b>customary</b> trust but said he could also treat incompetence with total contempt.|$|E
5|$|John was incensed {{about what}} he {{perceived}} as an abrogation of <b>his</b> <b>customary</b> right as monarch to influence the election. He complained both about the choice of Langton as an individual, as John felt he was overly influenced by the Capetian court in Paris, and about the process as a whole. He barred Langton from entering England and seized the lands of the archbishopric and other papal possessions. Innocent set a commission in place {{to try to convince}} John to change his mind, but to no avail. Innocent then placed an interdict on England in March 1208, prohibiting clergy from conducting religious services, with the exception of baptisms for the young, and confessions and absolutions for the dying.|$|E

5|$|The tour opener was {{followed}} by a game against Leicestershire; Miller was promoted to No. 3. At the fall of the first wicket, the crowd surged towards the players' gate, expecting Bradman to enter in <b>his</b> <b>customary</b> batting position. Miller emerged instead, and scored an unbeaten 202 in five and a half hours, although he was dropped three times. He featured in a 111-run second wicket partnership with Sid Barnes, before putting on 159 with Bradman for the third wicket. After a late-order collapse, in which no other batsman passed 12, it was left to last man Bill Johnston to partner Miller from 180 onwards. The pair put on 37 for the tenth wicket before Johnston was out for 12, allowing Miller to complete a double century. One of his sixes concussed a spectator. After his long innings, Miller did not bowl in the first innings, but was used late in the second innings and took 2/10. Australia completed another innings triumph.|$|E
5|$|Walpole's {{taste for}} {{adventure}} did not diminish {{in his last}} years. In 1939 he was commissioned to report for William Randolph Hearst's newspapers on the funeral in Rome of Pope Pius XI, the conclave to elect his successor, and the subsequent coronation. A fellow correspondent was Tom Driberg, whose memoirs tell of a lunch à deux at which Walpole arrived flushed with excitement from a sexual encounter that morning with an attendant in the Borghese Palace. In the weeks between the funeral and Pius XII's election Walpole, with <b>his</b> <b>customary</b> fluency, wrote much of his book Roman Fountain, a mixture of fact and fiction about the city. This was his last overseas visit.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{made two}} {{changes for the}} Test at Headingley. Middle-order batsman Neil Harvey {{replaced}} the injured opener Sid Barnes, who had collapsed while fielding during the Third Test after being hit in the ribs by a Dick Pollard pull shot. Australia declined to replace Barnes with the reserve opener Bill Brown, instead opting to use vice-captain Lindsay Hassett as a makeshift opener rather than in <b>his</b> <b>customary</b> position in the middle-order. Harvey had scored an unbeaten 73 and a 95 in the recent tour matches against Surrey and Gloucestershire respectively. Ron Saggers replaced first-choice wicket-keeper Don Tallon behind the stumps. Tallon's little left finger had swelled up after the Third Test, and he exacerbated the injury during the match against Middlesex. Former Australian Test leg spinner Bill O'Reilly criticised the Australians for opting to use only one spinner, pointing out that he and Chuck Fleetwood-Smith, a left-arm wrist spinner, had taken 17 wickets between them during the last Anglo-Australian Test at Headingley in 1938. O'Reilly cited a further instance of an Ashes Test at the same venue in 1934 in which he and Clarrie Grimmett had significant success for Australia. He wanted {{at least one of}} the two leg spinners, Colin McCool or Doug Ring, to have played alongside off spinner Ian Johnson, the only specialist spinner to have played in the three preceding Tests.|$|E
6000|$|... "But I {{thought it}} was. When a man wishes {{to take a}} girl away from her own home, and make her the {{mistress}} of <b>his,</b> it is <b>customary</b> that he shall ask for her father's permission." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{found the}} old gentleman {{considerably}} changed. There were, occasionally, flashes of <b>his</b> former <b>customary,</b> sarcastic pungency; {{now and again}} he would rouse himself to be ill-natured, antagonistic, and self-willed. But old age and illness had sadly told upon him; and he was content {{for the most part}} to express his humour by little shrugs, shakes of the head, and an irritable manner he had lately acquired of rubbing his hands quickly together.|$|R
50|$|Following {{the release}} of the 1973 album Frampton's Camel, {{keyboard}} player Mick Gallagher chose to leave the group, and for the next album Peter Frampton played keyboards in addition to <b>his</b> more <b>customary</b> guitar duties. Frampton retained British bassist Rick Wills, and American drummer John Siomos for Somethin's Happening which was recorded, with Chris Kimsey engineering, at studios in London, and at Headley Grange in Hampshire, a former workhouse which had been previously used by Led Zeppelin for some of their notable recordings.|$|R
5|$|Australia {{then headed}} to The Oval for the Fifth Test. Barnes {{returned}} from injury, so Hassett returned to <b>his</b> <b>customary</b> {{position in the}} middle order. England elected to bat on a rain-affected pitch. Propelled by Lindwall's 6/20, the tourists skittled Yardley’s men for 52 in 42.1 overs on the first afternoon. With the score at 1/10, Bill Edrich attempted to hook a short ball from Bill Johnston. Edrich failed {{to get the ball}} {{in the middle of the}} bat and it looped up and travelled around 10m. Hassett caught the ball just behind square leg, diving sideways to get two hands to the ball. Soon after, Lindwall bounced Compton, resulting in an edge that appeared to be heading towards the slips cordon. However, the ball cleared the ring of Australian fielders. Hutton called Compton through for a run, but his surprised partner was too busy watching the ball and dropped his bat in panic. Luckily for Compton, the ball went to Hassett at third man, who waited for Compton to regain his bat and composure before returning the ball, thereby forfeiting the opportunity to effect the run out. However, Compton only made four before being dismissed, so Australia lost little from Hassett's sportsmanship.|$|E
5|$|West further broadened {{his musical}} palette on Graduation by not {{limiting}} himself to <b>his</b> <b>customary</b> use of samples and interpolation from classic soul records and instead drew influences from {{a far more}} eclectic range of music genres. Along with house music, Graduation contains samples and music elements of euro-disco, hard rock, electronica, lounge, progressive rock, synth-pop, electro, krautrock, dub, reggae, and dancehall. Also, {{for much of the}} third studio album, Kanye West modified his style of rapping and adopted a dilatory, exuberant flow in emulation of Bono's operatic vocal stylings. West altered his vocabulary, he utilized less of the percussive, rhythmic consonants in favor of the more smoother, melodic vowel sounds. In addition to U2, West drew inspiration from other arena rock bands such as The Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin for the melodies and chord progressions of his songs. In terms of lyricism, he simplifies some of his rhymes after touring with The Rolling Stones on their A Bigger Bang concert tour and discovering he could not captivate the audiences as well with his most complex lyrical themes.|$|E

5000|$|At {{the end of}} the 2014-2015 season [...] "The Blades" [...] {{opted to}} extend their right to a further year on the {{contract}} for Wallace. During the pre-season, new manager Nigel Adkins played Wallace primarily at centre half, as opposed to <b>his</b> more <b>customary</b> midfield role. Adkins commented on how well Wallace was impressing in the new role and indeed Wallace has appeared regularly {{at the beginning of the}} season, again in a new defensive position, this time at left back.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} {{now known}} as the Cahokia Courthouse traces its ancestry back to a French-Canadian log cabin built by one of these settlers about 1740. In line with <b>his</b> group's <b>customary</b> architecture, the unknown builder built the cabin with logs raised vertically. This was different from having the logs placed horizontally, as had become the custom among English-speaking frontiersmen farther east. The French colonial building style is called poteaux-sur-solle (French:post on sill) construction, with the building's posts grounded in a foundation sill to retard wood rot.|$|R

But on the whole the more tangible trouble was the Mendham avalanche. Her tongue seemed to be hanging above him like the sword of Damocles.

50|$|In July 2014, Alcock {{signed a}} two-year deal with Sheffield United.

However, after an injury he has {{found himself in a}} more {{peripheral}} role, made harder by the January arrivals of additional full backs Kieron Freeman and John Brayford. In his second season at United, Alcock again found match time hard to come by, and as a result joined fellow League One side Doncaster Rovers on a 28-day loan On 10 November 2015. The loan was made permanent on 7 January 2016.|$|R
