50|$|In 1999, Virzì {{directed}} Baci e abbracci (Kisses and Hugs), a {{blend of}} fable, social comedy and a Christmas tale à la Dickens. Yet its most obvious reference is to Gogol’s The Inspector General that had already inspired Luigi Zampa’s Anni ruggenti in 1962. Baci e abbracci is an ensemble piece {{about a group of}} <b>ex-factory</b> workers who try to start up an ostrich farm in the middle of Tuscany. In this movie, Virzì once again portrays Italian provincial society seduced by the irresistible appeal of modernity. His younger brother, Carlo Virzì, who plays the frontman of a band called “Snaporaz”, is in fact the author of the music of several of Virzì’s films and made his own film début in 2006 with L’estate del mio primo bacio, written and scripted by Paolo.|$|E
50|$|In late 2004, at {{the request}} of his {{longtime}} patron and friend, Hardman took on the role of mentor/coach to Nick Leventis. Hardman formed Strakka Racing from EDM in 2005, building the team from the ground up, with the goal of reaching the pinnacle of modern Sportscar racing—Le Mans 24 Hours—in five years. With Hardman as team owner, team manager, driver, and mentor/coach to Nick, the team ran first in Group N with a BMW M3, then an <b>ex-factory</b> BMW M3 GTR in GT2, followed by GT1 in the Aston Martin DBR9 in 2008 Le Mans Series. Finally, Hardman negotiated an assisted factory deal with Ginetta-Zytek for the move into LMP1, along with a Michelin tyre contract and an entry to Le Mans 24 Hours, for the 2009 season. In June 2009, Hardman achieved his objective for Strakka with the team’s 21st place finish at Le Mans 24 Hours.|$|E

Two more LMP-1s were also there from Japanese Team Dragon, using one <b>ex-factory</b> car and a newly built car. All five would finish, {{although}} Den Blå Avis' entry would not be classified. The other four cars took fifth, sixth, eighth, and fifteenth. Before returning to the United States, the 1000km Nürburgring would be held for the ALMS. A Panoz LMP-1 Roadster-S would manage to take the race win over BMW, the only win that the car would manage the entire year. Panoz would not manage another podium finish in the ALMS until the seventh round, followed by another at Portland. The defending Petit Le Mans winners would once again lose to BMW by taking only third and fourth at the event, before closing out the season without another podium.|$|E
50|$|Bonita Zakos are {{the most}} human looking demons in the game (despite their giant breasts.) They are minions of the Demons of Vanity and girls with ponytails who use their giant breasts as {{helicopters}} to fly out of danger, to punch Linda, and belly-flop Linda to the ground. They sometimes run and use their breasts to push Linda. Their weak points are their heads and backsides, but it is sometimes a little tricky due to them moving around in circles. They come in three colors: Red, blue and black. The blue and black ones only appear in the EX-Island and <b>EX-Factory,</b> while the red ones appear in the EX-Rooftop and share the EX-Ice world with the black and blue ones. The red ones also appear in the Gallery of Shame if you haven't exorcised and defeated the demon sisters yet. If the Bonita Zakos take enough damage, they explode. More points are earned if they are defeated without players touching their breasts.|$|E

50|$|As {{promising}} as {{the future}} is for a whole, the outlook for small and medium enterprises (SME) is not as bright. The excise structure changed so that companies now {{have to pay a}} 16% tax on the maximum retail price (MRP) of their products, as opposed to on the <b>ex-factory</b> price. Consequently, larger companies cut back on outsourcing and what business is left shifted to companies with facilities in the four tax-free states - Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Uttaranchal, and Jharkhand. Consequently, a large number of pharmaceutical manufacturers shifted their plant to these states, as it became almost impossible to continue operating in non-tax free zones. But in a matter of a couple of years the excise duty was revised on two occasions, first it was reduced to 8% and then to 4%. As a result, the benefits of shifting to a tax free zone was negated. This resulted in, factories in the tax free zones, to start up third party manufacturing. Under this these factories produced goods under the brand names of other parties on job work basis.|$|E

5000|$|In 1913 in the UK, the 1018 cc [...] "Bullnose" [...] Morris Oxford was {{the first}} model {{launched}} by Morris Motors. Only 1302 were made. The Oxford was available as a two-seater, or van but the chassis was too short to allow four-seat bodies to be fitted. It made extensive use of bought in components, including many from the U.S. to reduce costs. The 1915-1919 Morris Cowley (about 1400 produced) powered by a new US Continental engine was a bigger stronger better finished version of the first Oxford. The post-First World War Oxford was a deluxe version of that, now made plainer, 1915-1919 Cowley. They were larger cars with 50% bigger engines than the 1913 Oxford. By 1925 Cowleys and Oxfords were 41 per cent of British private car production and limousine and landaulet bodies for 14/28 Oxfords were supplied <b>ex-factory.</b> Morris then added a commercial vehicle operation and bought Wolseley Motors the following year.

40|$|Objectives To compare {{prices of}} in-patent active {{ingredients}} (AIs) in Europe at three levels (<b>ex-factory</b> prices, net distribution margins and third party payers' prices). Methods We compared the prices in seven EU countries (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and the UK) of the 20 in-patent AIs most {{sold on the}} Italian retail market in 2004, based on "sell in" sales data. We calculated the average <b>ex-factory</b> price per unit of each compound {{in each of the}} seven countries, weighted by the volumes of all reimbursable package sizes and strengths. We estimated net distribution margins according to the 2004 domestic regulations by deducting any type of mandatory discount. Finally, we added VAT to calculate "third party payer's prices". All prices were expressed in index numbers (ItalyÂ =Â  100). Results Italy had the lowest average <b>ex-factory</b> prices, the Netherlands and particularly the UK had by far the lowest distribution margins, while Germany had by far the highest third party payers' prices. The Netherlands and particularly UK showed a steep decrease from <b>ex-factory</b> to third party payers' prices, while Belgium, Italy and Spain gave the opposite pattern. Conclusions Our study suggests that public authorities can deal with drug prices both by strictly controlling <b>ex-factory</b> prices and by establishing appropriate distribution margins. The latter might be facilitated by liberalizing the distribution sector. ...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the quality issue in automotive industry, {{the main focus of}} this research is the <b>ex-factory</b> defects issue occurring at Company A. Company A is one of the suppliers that supplies parts to Toyota Motor Thailand (TMT). Thus, this research is one of representative case that reveals the current quality issue for the SMEs of automotive industry in Thailand. The main research is to identify the root causes for <b>ex-factory</b> defects and to make recommendations so as to improve the performance of the company. In order to understand the existed theories and frameworks, the literature review is made based on quality management and supply chain relationship. These two areas of study will facilitate the understanding of the ideal models, frameworks, and theories practiced by majority. Then, the methodology used to collect data is done through case study and semi-structured interviews with the key fact holders from two organisations, Company A and TMT, in order to explore the “cause” and “effect” of the issues. Thus, the key findings can be derived from the analysis that is structured using Toyota Business Practice (TBP). As a result, the root causes that create the <b>ex-factory</b> defects issue are mainly from the inspectors not following the standardise work, lack of maintenance in tools and equipments, unskilled workers, inadequate training and support from top management, and language barrier. Furthermore, the recommendations are made in order to overcome these issues. The focus areas of recommendations include improvements in management support and system, key points check, operation standard, tools and equipments, working environment, and overcoming language barrier. Significantly, the improvements must derive from supports from top management and employee involvement...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{effects of}} reference pricing {{for prescription drugs}} in German social health insurance based on econometric panel data methods. We analyze the effect on <b>ex-factory</b> prices.

We use a large panel data set of nearly all German prescription drugs on a monthly basis between October 1994 and July 2005. Altogether, the data comprise almost 4 million observations. They provide information on <b>ex-factory</b> prices, reference prices, manufacturers, type of prescription drug, and market entries and exits. Our results show that there is no full price adjustment:A 1 %-change in reference prices leads to a 0. 3 %-change in market prices. Price adjustment, however, is fast, it mostly happens in the first month. Furthermore, the first introduction of a reference price reduces market prices of the affected products by approximately 14 %. Finally, we observe a significant time effect which is positive in the market without reference prices and negative in that with reference price.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo compare {{prices of}} medicines, both originators and generics, in New Zealand and 16 European {{countries}}. MethodsEx-factory price data as of December 2012 from New Zealand and 16 European countries were compared for {{a basket of}} 14 medicines, {{most of which were}} at least partially funded by the state in the 17 countries. Five medicines had, at least in some countries, generic versions on the market whose prices were also analyzed. Medicine price data for the 16 European countries were provided by the Pharma Price Information service. New Zealand medicine prices were retrieved from the New Zealand Pharmaceutical Schedule. Unit prices converted into euro were compared at the <b>ex-factory</b> price level. ResultsFor the 14 medicines surveyed, considerable price differences at the <b>ex-factory</b> price level were identified. Within the European countries, prices in Greece, Portugal, the United Kingdom, and Spain ranked at the lower end, whereas prices in Switzerland, Germany, Denmark, and Sweden were at the upper end. The results for New Zealand compared with Europe were variable. New Zealand prices were found in the lowest quartile for five medicines and in the highest quartile for seven other products. Price differences between the originator products and generic versions ranged from 0 % to 90 % depending on the medicine and the country. ConclusionsMedicine prices varied considerably between European countries and New Zealand as well as among the European countries. These differences are likely to result from national pricing and reimbursement policies...|$|E
