5|$|Models are <b>initialized</b> {{using this}} {{observed}} data. The irregularly spaced observations are processed by data assimilation and objective analysis methods, which perform quality control and obtain values at locations usable by the model's mathematical algorithms (usually an evenly spaced grid). The data are then {{used in the}} model {{as the starting point}} for a forecast. Commonly, the set of equations used to predict the known as the physics and dynamics of the atmosphere are called primitive equations. These equations are <b>initialized</b> from the analysis data and rates of change are determined. The rates of change predict the state of the atmosphere a short time into the future. The equations are then applied to this new atmospheric state to find new rates of change, and these new rates of change predict the atmosphere at a yet further time into the future. This time stepping procedure is continually repeated until the solution reaches the desired forecast time. The length of the time step is related to the distance between the points on the computational grid.|$|E
5|$|Once an {{alternate}} boot partition has been created, the TPM module {{needs to be}} <b>initialized</b> (assuming that this feature is being used), after which the required disk encryption key protection mechanisms such as TPM, PIN or USB key are configured. The volume is then encrypted as a background task, something that may take {{a considerable amount of}} time with a large disk as every logical sector is read, encrypted and rewritten back to disk. The keys are only protected after the whole volume has been encrypted, when the volume is considered secure. BitLocker uses a low-level device driver to encrypt and decrypt all file operations, making interaction with the encrypted volume transparent to applications running on the platform.|$|E

25|$|For structs it is {{optional}} to explicitly call a constructor because the default {{one is called}} automatically. You just need to declare it and it gets <b>initialized</b> with standard values.|$|E

Before <b>initializing</b> RAM, coreboot <b>initializes</b> the serial port (addressing cache and registers only), so it can send out debug text to a connected terminal.

25|$|Land {{development}} schemes may be <b>initialized,</b> where {{operators are}} given the rights to use lands near stations, depots, or tracks for property development.

25|$|If {{efficiency}} {{is not a}} concern, computing factorials is trivial from an algorithmic point of view: successively multiplying a variable <b>initialized</b> to 1 by the integers up to n (if any) will compute n!, provided the result fits in the variable. In functional languages, the recursive definition is often implemented directly to illustrate recursive functions.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} {{variable}} types in C++ are local variables inside a function or block, and temporary variables. The common feature about automatic variables {{is that they}} have a lifetime that is limited to the scope of the variable.

25|$|The {{basic problem}} is that the {{constructor}} is a peculiar function; when it starts off, there is no object, only raw memory. And by the time it finishes, you have a fully <b>initialized</b> object. Therefore, i) The constructor cannot be called on an object ii) However, it needs to access (and initialize) non-static members. This makes calling the constructor directly an error. The solution is the placement form of operator new.|$|E
25|$|Like in C and C++ {{there are}} {{functions}} that group reusable code. The main {{difference is that}} functions, just like in Java, have to reside inside of a class. A function is therefore called a method. A method has a return value, a name and usually some parameters <b>initialized</b> when it is called with some arguments. It can either belong to an instance of a class or be a static member.|$|E
25|$|If {{an attempt}} {{is made to}} IPL from a device which was not <b>initialized</b> with IPL Text, the system simply enters a wait state. The DASD (direct access storage device) {{initialization}} program, IBCDASDI, or the DASD initialization application, ICKDSF, places a wait state PSW and a dummy CCW string in the 24 bytes, should the device be designated for data only, not for IPL, after which these programs format the VTOC and perform other hard drive initialization functions.|$|E
