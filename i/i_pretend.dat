25|$|I scored 114 in {{the first}} innings and 97 in the second. I will not claim that the first innings was a {{particularly}} good one, as it took me almost seven hours. But neither would <b>I</b> <b>pretend</b> {{that it was not}} immensely satisfying. I took ball after ball, blow after blow on that improvised body-shield but was able to stand firm...The second innings was the best I ever played. From the firm foundations of real confidence I was able to get after the bowling and repay Hall, particularly, for some of the anguish he had caused me. I had one glorious hour against him...I hooked him twice in a row and reduced him to the kind of despair which, but a fortnight earlier, had been exclusively mine.|$|E
2500|$|When Anthony's sister Hannah was on {{her death}} bed, she asked Susan {{to talk about the}} great beyond, but, Anthony later wrote, [...] "I could not dash her faith with my doubts, nor could <b>I</b> <b>pretend</b> a faith I had not; so I was silent in the dread {{presence}} of death." ...|$|E
2500|$|While Tate {{reportedly}} {{wanted a}} traditional marriage, Polanski remained somewhat promiscuous and described Tate's attitude to his infidelity as [...] "Sharon's big hang-up". He reminded Tate {{that she had}} promised {{that she would not}} try to change him. Tate accepted Polanski's conditions, though she confided to friends that she hoped he would change. Peter Evans quoted Tate as saying, [...] "We have a good arrangement. Roman lies to me and <b>I</b> <b>pretend</b> to believe him." ...|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Quigg resented {{being left}} out, and <b>I</b> <b>pretended</b> surprise.|$|R
60|$|I {{can tell}} you my heart beat, though <b>I</b> <b>pretended</b> to look quite unconcerned.|$|R
60|$|I had {{not read}} George Moore at the time, but <b>I</b> <b>pretended</b> to understand.|$|R
6000|$|... "Did <b>I</b> <b>pretend?</b> did <b>I</b> <b>pretend</b> badly?" [...] But {{without waiting}} for an answer to this St. George went on: [...] "You ought always to believe such a girl as that--always, always. Some women are meant to be taken with {{allowances}} and reserves; but you must take her just as she is." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No. I'm not. Dear God, how we fool ourselves! <b>I</b> <b>pretend</b> I'm 'spiritual.' <b>I</b> <b>pretend</b> my {{legs are}} graceful. They aren't. They're skinny. Old-maidish. I hate it! I hate that impertinent young woman! A selfish cat, taking his love for granted. [...] . No, she's adorable. [...] . I don't think {{she ought to be}} so {{friendly}} with Guy Pollock." ...|$|E
6000|$|CURTIS--[Agitatedly.] But Martha--you don't understand. How can <b>I</b> <b>pretend</b> gladness when--[Vehemently.] Why, {{it would}} spoil all our plans! ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Dear Captain Cuttle!' remonstrated Walter. 'I being here! Miss Dombey, in her guileless {{innocent}} heart, regards me as her adopted brother; {{but what}} would the guile and guilt of my heart be, if <b>I</b> <b>pretended</b> to believe that I had any right to approach her, familiarly, in that character--if <b>I</b> <b>pretended</b> to forget that I am bound, in honour, not to do it?' ...|$|R
60|$|He {{offered me}} {{his hand as}} he climbed up into the dog-cart, which <b>I</b> <b>pretended,</b> however, not to see.|$|R
6000|$|... "If <b>I</b> <b>pretended</b> <b>I</b> didn't blame him, {{you would}} find me out and it would stand between us. I wish I could say I'd dropped the papers somewhere or find some other way; {{but the truth is}} best." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Lady Barb {{believes}} it; I’m {{sure she}} does!” Jackson exclaimed with spirit. “Why should <b>I</b> <b>pretend</b> {{to be in}} love with her if I’m not?” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay, <b>I</b> <b>pretend</b> to deal {{in little}} more. The rich and great, they that send vessels {{of gold and}} rich dresses to Our Lady, employ their own {{favorite}} messengers; I am but the bearer of prayer and the substitute for the penitent. The sufferings that I undergo in the flesh are passed to the credit of my employers, who get the benefit of my aches and pains. <b>I</b> <b>pretend</b> {{to be no more}} than their go-between, as yonder manner has so lately called me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Edward,' replied my mother, timidly, 'you are a {{far better}} judge of all {{questions}} than <b>I</b> <b>pretend</b> to be. Both you and Jane are. I only said--' ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>pretended</b> to {{be blind}} to this restless curiosity. Sally {{understood}} the cause, too, and it divided her between a sweet gravity and a naughty humor.|$|R
60|$|He did not answer, {{but looked}} at me dubiously, then at his bare legs and his shirt, then again at me. <b>I</b> <b>pretended</b> not to understand.|$|R
60|$|I overheard all this, though <b>I</b> <b>pretended</b> not to,--the little busy chits supposing me entirely {{buried in}} the {{recesses}} of a German book over which I was poring.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course <b>I</b> <b>pretend</b> she'd marry well in marrying me. She couldn't marry a man {{who loves}} her more--or whom, I may venture to add, she loves more." ...|$|E
60|$|STEPHEN [keeping {{his temper}} with difficulty] You {{are pleased to}} be facetious. <b>I</b> <b>pretend</b> to nothing more than any honorable English gentleman claims as his {{birthright}} [he sits down angrily].|$|E
6000|$|Flo. <b>I</b> <b>pretend</b> not to {{instruct}} {{you in your}} way; you see I do not go before you; but you cannot possibly deny me the happiness to wait upon these ladies; me, who-- ...|$|E
6000|$|Some {{indication}} of his opinion was given, however, in a remark, {{which of course}} <b>I</b> <b>pretended</b> not to understand, that I overheard him make {{to one of his}} officers: ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>pretended</b> a {{reluctance}} {{to speak of the}} Ranger, but when I did it was to drop a subtle word or briefly tell of an action that suggested such.|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{certainly}} did," [...] replied Blair, warmly. [...] "And I lied like a trooper. I didn't {{know where}} you were or how you were, but <b>I</b> <b>pretended</b> you were O.K." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Lady, I do {{not know}} {{anything}} about it," [...] he said; [...] "you may be his Highness the Doge, or the ambassador of the emperor. <b>I</b> <b>pretend</b> to know nothing in Venice of late----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As deep as the ocean! All <b>I</b> <b>pretend</b> is {{that the}} author doesn't see--" [...] But a dish {{was at this point}} passed over his shoulder, and we had to wait while he helped himself.|$|E
6000|$|Ferd. But <b>I</b> <b>pretend</b> {{no claim}} {{at all to}} yours; [...] Besides, you are more {{beautiful}} than I, [...] And fitter to allure unpractised hearts: [...] Therefore I once more beg you will not see her.|$|E
6000|$|There was no {{resisting}} such {{a strong}} hint as this: however, <b>I</b> <b>pretended</b> {{to think about it}} for a moment, and then said [...] "Well, I like 'Ting, ting, ting,' best of all." ...|$|R
60|$|Now I {{wished that}} the {{hat-rack}} {{was still at}} hand, but, as it was not, <b>I</b> <b>pretended</b> to stumble, and leant for a moment against the porter who had received my last shilling.|$|R
6000|$|... "I think so," [...] he {{answered}} with a forced smile. [...] "Anyway, I'll try, and I'd like you to be happy. But it wouldn't be flattering if <b>I</b> <b>pretended</b> that <b>I</b> wasn't hurt." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Let it be as you wish. God {{knows my}} heart is pure. <b>I</b> <b>pretend</b> no longer to {{regulate}} my destiny. I am yours, Ferdinand. Be you responsible for all that affects my honour or my heart.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I didn't show anything," [...] said Verena gaily. [...] "I am {{learning}} to dissimulate," [...] she {{added in a}} moment. [...] "I suppose you have to as you go along. <b>I</b> <b>pretend</b> not to notice." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{know what}} it is; he has caught sight of a church. <b>I</b> <b>pretend</b> not to notice any change in him, and {{endeavour}} to hurry him on. He lags more and more behind, however, and at last stops altogether.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should be}} vain, Victorine, if <b>I</b> <b>pretended</b> to {{misunderstand}} your questions," [...] said Marie; [...] "but {{why you should}} mix my name with that of M. Larochejaquelin, without vanity I do not know." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{understood}} the game well enough, though <b>I</b> <b>pretended</b> <b>I</b> did not, and played cautiously. It {{was to keep}} a good stock in my lap, out of which I {{every now and then}} conveyed some into my pocket, but in such a manner, and at such convenient times, as I was sure he could not see it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, she was shocked, of course. She {{sat up in}} bed, {{staring at}} me, and then leaned back on the pillows again. <b>I</b> <b>pretended</b> not to notice it--but I was sorry I'd said {{anything}} about it." ...|$|R
