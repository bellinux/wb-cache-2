40|$|Gas {{and power}} {{networks}} are tightly coupled {{and interact with}} each other due to physically interconnected facilities. In an integrated gas and power network, a contingency observed in one system may cause iterative cascading failures, resulting in network wide disruptions. Therefore, understanding the impacts of the interactions in both systems is crucial for governments, system operators, regulators and operational planners, particularly, to ensure security of supply for the overall energy system. Although simulation has been widely used in the assessment of gas systems as well as power systems, there is a significant gap in simulation models that are able to address the coupling of both systems. In this paper, a simulation framework that models and simulates the gas and power network in an integrated manner is proposed. The framework consists of a transient model for the gas system and a steady state model for the power system based on AC-Optimal Power Flow. The gas and power system model are coupled through an interface which uses the coupling equations to establish the data exchange and coordination between the individual models. The bidirectional interlink between both systems considered in this studies are the fuel <b>gas</b> <b>offtake</b> of gas fired power plants for power generation and the power supply to liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals and electric drivers installed in gas compressor stations and underground gas storage facilities. The simulation framework is implemented into an innovative simulation tool named SAInt (Scenario Analysis Interface for Energy Systems) and the capabilities of the tool are demonstrated by performing a contingency analysis for a real world example. Results indicate how a disruption triggered in one system propagates to the other system and affects the operation of critical facilities. In addition, the studies show the importance of using transient gas models for security of supply studies instead of successions of steady state models, where the time evolution of the line pack is not captured correctly.

40|$|The {{integration}} {{of renewable energy}} sources into existing electric power systems is connected with an increased interdependence between natural gas and electric power transmission networks. To analyse this interdependence {{and its impact on}} security of supply, we developed a novel combined dynamic simulation and optimization model and implemented it into the simulation package SAInt (Scenario Analysis Interface for Energy Systems), the first published software application that allows the combined simulation of gas and electric power systems in a single time frame and simulation environment. The model is composed of a transient hydraulic simulation model for the gas system and an augmented AC-Optimal Power Flow model for the electric power system, which includes a model for dispatchable power system loads and considers time transitional constraints, such as the ramp rate and the start-up time of generation units. Both models take into account the control and constraints of the most relevant facilities present in both systems. The bidirectional interconnection between both systems is considered and established by coupling equations describing the fuel <b>gas</b> <b>offtake</b> for power generation in gas fired power plants, and the electric power supply to LNG terminals and electric driven compressors in gas compressor stations. The resulting system of equations for the combined model are solved in a single simulation time frame. In order to quantify the impact of different contingencies on the operation of the combined system, a number of security of supply parameters are proposed, which can be utilized to compare the impact of different contingencies on security of supply and the efficiency of countermeasures to mitigate this impact. The capabilities of the combined model and the functionality of the simulation tool are demonstrated in a case study of a sample gas and power transmission system. Results indicate how the combined simulation can give insight into important and critical information, such as the timing and propagation of contingencies cascading from one system to the other or the grace period to react to disruptions. Such information can contribute to improving the coordination between gas and power transmission system operators in the event of disruptions, thus, increasing the resilience and the level of security of supply in the combined energy system. The information provided by the combined model cannot be obtained by the traditional co-simulation approach, where both systems are solved in different time frames. Furthermore, the studies stress the importance of using transient gas simulation models for security of supply analysis instead of steady state models, where the time evolution of gas pressure and linepack are not reflected appropriately.

40|$|Even though {{contracts}} {{for the purchase}} and sale of natural <b>gas</b> providing an <b>offtake</b> flexibility concerning volume and time (gas sales agreements) have been commonplace in the natural gas industry for many years, the development of techniques for pricing them has not followed at the same pace. This thesis is motivated by {{the changing nature of}} the natural gas industry in the European Union, which is asking for a mark-to-market evaluation of these contracts. The flexibility provided by these contracts is then regarded as a financial option, called a "gas swing option". Since the gas swing option is actually a set of several American puts on a spread between prices of two or more energy commodities, we devote one section of the text to the theory on spread option pricing. Due to the specific features of the energy markets the existing analytic approximations for spread option pricing are hardly applicable to our framework. That is why we employ numerical methods and model the spot price dynamics through stochastic processes capturing such features. The price of an arbitrarily chosen gas swing option is then computed in accordance with the concept of risk-neutral expectations, i. e. is considered as an expectation of discounted future cash flows for a probability structure called risk-neutral. Finally, our [...] ...|$|R
