5|$|Elcor sat atop {{a bed of}} {{taconite}} {{consisting of}} a uniform mixture of about 30% iron, interspersed with pockets of <b>high-grade</b> <b>ore,</b> {{a part of the}} Biwabik iron formation. The Biwabik iron formation is a large sheet of iron-bearing sediment deposited during the Precambrian era {{on the bottom of the}} Animikie Sea. This iron-bearing rock extends under Lake Superior from the Mesabi and Vermilion Iron Ranges, to the Gogebic Iron Range from northern Wisconsin into the Marquette Range of the upper peninsula of Michigan, and west to the manganese-rich ore of the Cuyuna Iron Range. Michigan's steel-blue high grade ores were quite different from the Mesabi ore, which was soft brown hematite. There is iron in other areas of Minnesota, but no longer in quantities that are practical to mine.|$|E
5|$|Minnesota's {{earliest}} industries were fur {{trading and}} agriculture. The city of Minneapolis grew around the flour mills powered by St. Anthony Falls. Although {{less than one}} percent of the population is now employed in the agricultural sector, it remains a major part of the state's economy, ranking sixth in the nation in the value of products sold. The state is the U.S.'s largest producer of sugar beets, sweet corn, and green peas for processing, and farm-raised turkeys. Minnesota is also a large producer of corn and soybeans. Minnesota has the most food cooperatives per capita in the United States. Forestry remains strong, including logging, pulpwood processing and paper production, and forest products manufacturing. Minnesota was famous for its soft-ore mines, which produced a significant portion of the world's iron ore for over a century. Although the <b>high-grade</b> <b>ore</b> is now depleted, taconite mining continues, using processes developed locally to save the industry. In 2004, the state produced 75 percent of the country's usable iron ore. The mining boom created the port of Duluth which continues to be important for shipping ore, coal, and agricultural products. The manufacturing sector now includes technology and biomedical firms in addition to the older food processors and heavy industry. The nation's first indoor shopping mall was Edina's Southdale Center and its largest is Bloomington's Mall of America.|$|E
25|$|One {{assessment}} {{from the}} IAEA showed that enough <b>high-grade</b> <b>ore</b> exists {{to supply the}} needs of the current reactor fleet for 40–50 years. According to Sovacool (2011), reserves from existing uranium mines are being rapidly depleted, and expected shortfalls in available fuel threaten future plants and contribute to volatility of uranium prices at existing plants. Escalation of uranium fuel costs decreased the viability of nuclear projects. Uranium prices rose from 2001 to 2007, before declining.|$|E

25|$|Cyanide {{is mainly}} {{produced}} for the mining {{of gold and}} silver: It helps dissolve these metals and their ores. In the cyanide process, finely ground <b>high-grade</b> <b>ore</b> is mixed with the cyanide (concentration of about two kilogram NaCN per tonne); low-grade ores are stacked into heaps and sprayed with a cyanide solution (concentration of about one kilogram NaCN per ton). The precious metals are complexed by the cyanide anions to form soluble derivatives, e.g., − and −.|$|E
25|$|The Argyle diamond mine is {{economically}} feasible because its large reserves and <b>high-grade</b> <b>ore</b> offset a low average diamond value. The estimated value of Argyle diamond production is only US$7 per carat ($35/g); this compares to values of $70 per carat ($350/g) for diamonds produced at the Diavik mine and US$170 per carat ($850/g) at the Ekati mine, both in Canada. However, Argyle has {{two to four}} times the concentration of diamonds (ore grade) of these mines. This makes extraction {{economically feasible}}, as mine costs are mostly related {{to the amount of}} ore processed, not the amount of diamond extracted.|$|E
25|$|The company {{struggled}} after World War I: {{the loss}} of military contracts sharply reduced demand for luminescent paint and dials, and in 1922, <b>high-grade</b> <b>ore</b> was discovered in Katanga, driving all U.S. suppliers out of business except U.S. Radium and the Standard Chemical Company. U.S. Radium consolidated its operations in Manhattan in 1927, leasing out the Orange plant and selling off other property. But demand for luminescent products surged again during World War II; by 1942, it employed as many as 1000 workers, and in 1944 {{was reported to have}} radium mining, processing, and application facilities in Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania; Bernardsville, New Jersey; Whippany, New Jersey; and North Hollywood, California as well as New York City.|$|E

500|$|Rhyolite {{began to}} decline before the final closing of the mine. At roughly {{the same time that}} the Bullfrog mines were running out of <b>high-grade</b> <b>ore,</b> the 1906 San Francisco {{earthquake}} diverted capital to California while interrupting rail service, and the financial panic of 1907 restricted funding for mine development. As mines in the district reduced production or closed, unemployed miners left Rhyolite to seek work elsewhere, businesses failed, and by 1910, the census reported only 675 residents. All three banks in the town closed by March 1910. The newspapers, including the Rhyolite Herald, the last to go, all shut down by June 1912. The post office closed in November 1913; the last train left Rhyolite Station in July 1914, and the Nevada-California Power Company turned off the electricity and removed its lines in 1916. Within a year the town was [...] "all but abandoned", and the 1920 census reported a population of only 14. A 1922 motor tour by the Los Angeles Times found only one remaining resident, a 92-year-old man who died in 1924.|$|E

50|$|From 1876 to 1891 Chilean copper mining declined, being largely {{replaced}} in international markets by copper from the United States and Río Tinto in Spain.

40|$|The Mesabi Range {{along the}} north edge of the Paleoproterozoic Penokean orogen in {{northern}} Minnesota has produced 3. 6 billion metric tons of ore since its discovery in 1890. Of that amount, 2. 3 billion metric tons were extracted from hematite- or goethite-rich deposits generally referred to as "high-grade " <b>ores.</b> The <b>high-grade</b> <b>ores</b> formed as the Biwabik Iron-Formation was oxidized, hydrated, and leached by solutions flowing along open faults and fractures. The source of the ore-forming solutions has been debated since it was first pro-posed that the ores were weathering products formed by descending meteoritic ground-water flowing in late Mesozoic time. Subsequently others believed that the ores were better explained by ascending solutions, poss-bily hydrothermal solutions of pre-Phanerzoic age. Neither Wolff nor Gruner could reconcile their observa-tions with a reasonable source for the solutions. In this paper, I build on modern mapping of the Mesabi Range and mine-specific geologic observations summarized in the literature to propose a conceptual model in which the <b>high-grade</b> <b>ores</b> formed from ascending solutions {{that were part of}} a continent-scale topographic orgrav-ity-driven ground-water system.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Chemical {{signatures}} of iron oxides from dolomitic itabirite and <b>high-grade</b> iron <b>ore</b> from the Esperança deposit, loca-ted in the Quadrilátero Ferrífero, indicate that polycyclic processes involving changing {{of chemical and}} redox conditions are respon-sible for the iron enrichment on Cauê Formation from Minas Su-pergroup. Variations of Mn, Mg and Sr content in different gene-rations of iron oxides from dolomitic itabirite, <b>high-grade</b> iron <b>ore</b> and syn-mineralization quartz-carbonate-hematite veins denote the close relationship between <b>high-grade</b> iron <b>ore</b> formation and carbonate alteration. This indicates that dolomitic itabirite is the main precursor of the iron ore in that deposit. Long-lasting per-colation of hydrothermal fluids and shifts in the redox conditions have contributed {{to changes in the}} Y/Ho ratio, light/heavy rare earth elements ratio and Ce anomaly with successive iron oxide generations (martite-granular hematite), as well as lower abundan-ce of trace elements including rare earth elements in the younger specularite generations...|$|R
