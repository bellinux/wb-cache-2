60|$|This {{time there}} was no mistake. It was a hail hardly more than a whisper, but yet so {{distinct}} as to prevent any possibility {{that it was a}} trick of the imagination. One would have said it came from the sea directly beneath the brig's stern, and Jim's <b>face</b> grew <b>pale</b> <b>with</b> <b>fear</b> as he looked quickly around without seeing so much as a floating timber.|$|R
60|$|Nothing {{could be}} more revolting than that swarthy, evil <b>face</b> turned <b>pale</b> <b>with</b> <b>fear.</b> Girty's visage was a ghastly, livid white. So earnest, so intense was Joe's voice, {{that it seemed to}} all as if Wetzel was about to dart into the glade, with his avenging {{tomahawk}} uplifted to wreak an awful vengeance on the abductor. The renegade's white, craven heart contained no such thing as courage. If he ever fought it was like a wolf, backed by numbers. The resemblance ceased here, for even a cornered wolf will show his teeth, and Girty, driven to bay, would have cringed and cowered. Even now at the mention of Wetzel's enmity he trembled.|$|R
60|$|In {{the mean}} time, Dolly--beautiful, bewitching, {{captivating}} little Dolly--her hair dishevelled, her dress torn, her dark eyelashes wet with tears, her bosom heaving--her <b>face,</b> now <b>pale</b> <b>with</b> <b>fear,</b> now crimsoned <b>with</b> indignation--her whole self {{a hundred times}} more beautiful in this heightened aspect than ever she had been before--vainly strove to comfort Emma Haredale, and to impart to her the consolation of which she stood in so much need herself. The soldiers were sure to come; they must be rescued; {{it would be impossible}} to convey them through the streets of London when they set the threats of their guards at defiance, and shrieked to the passengers for help. If they did this when they came into the more frequented ways, she was certain--she was quite certain--they must be released. So poor Dolly said, and so poor Dolly tried to think; but the invariable conclusion of all such arguments was, that Dolly burst into tears; cried, as she wrung her hands, what would they do or think, or who would comfort them, at home, at the Golden Key; and sobbed most piteously.|$|R
60|$|He found Bartley {{seated at}} the window, with a wet towel round his head, and his <b>face</b> <b>pale</b> <b>with</b> headache.|$|R
60|$|His {{voice was}} so quiet and colourless, it made her heart go <b>pale</b> <b>with</b> <b>fear.</b>|$|R
60|$|Clarke {{turned as}} he heard her step and looked {{straight}} {{into a pair of}} dark, scornful eyes and a <b>face</b> <b>pale</b> <b>with</b> anger.|$|R
60|$|The woman turned <b>pale</b> <b>with</b> <b>fear,</b> and {{her fingers}} trembled. She {{would not even}} glance at {{the name on the}} card.|$|R
6000|$|To shore they came, and to {{the boat}} [...] Fast leapt he with the child, And in leapt Margaret--breathless now [...] And <b>pale</b> <b>with</b> <b>fear</b> and wild.|$|R
60|$|M. de Rivarol was {{compelled}} to swallow his fury, though it choked him. The jubilation among his officers had been such {{that he could not}} continue as he had begun. Yet his eyes were malevolent, his <b>face</b> <b>pale</b> <b>with</b> anger.|$|R
5000|$|They were {{generally}} depicted as birds with {{the heads of}} maidens, <b>faces</b> <b>pale</b> <b>with</b> hunger and long claws on their hands. Roman and Byzantine writers detailed their ugliness. Pottery art depicting the harpies featured beautiful women with wings. Ovid described them as human-vultures.|$|R
6000|$|Then the Minuai grew <b>pale</b> <b>with</b> <b>fear</b> for him; but Aietes {{laughed a}} bitter laugh. ‘See! if I had not warriors enough already round me, I could call {{them out of}} the bosom of the earth.’ ...|$|R
60|$|Raym. Mark who defraud their offspring, you or I? For know, {{there yet}} survives the lawful heir Of Sancho's blood, whom when I shall produce, I rest assured {{to see you}} <b>pale</b> <b>with</b> <b>fear,</b> And {{trembling}} at his name.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{not going}} away," [...] he shouted, irritated at last. [...] "Go yourself--hustle--stir thysen--hop." [...] And {{he pointed to}} the door. The child backed away from him, <b>pale</b> <b>with</b> <b>fear.</b> Then she {{gathered}} up courage, seeing him become patient.|$|R
60|$|The Emperor smiled grimly, {{while the}} Patrician's thin <b>face</b> grew <b>pale</b> <b>with</b> anger.|$|R
60|$|With clenched teeth, and <b>faces</b> <b>pale</b> <b>with</b> {{rage and}} anxiety, the party rode on past {{the site of}} the huts, {{scattered}} round which were the bodies of several of the murdered peons. They halted not until they drew rein, and leapt off {{in front of the house}} itself.|$|R
60|$|This {{might also}} be irony; and Francis thought it so; but the tones were so soft and conciliating, that <b>with</b> a <b>face</b> <b>pale</b> <b>with</b> his emotions, he ventured to look up and met the eye of Marian, fixed on him in an {{expression}} that changed his death-like hue into the color of vermillion.|$|R
60|$|She {{repeated}} the sentence, <b>with</b> her <b>face</b> very <b>pale,</b> <b>with</b> her dear hand cold and trembling in mine.|$|R
60|$|After {{they had}} gone Burt took his rifle and strolled off into the forest. Then the girl appeared. Her hair was down, her <b>face</b> <b>pale,</b> <b>with</b> dark shadows. She asked for water to wash her face. Wilson pointed to the brook, and as she walked slowly toward it he took a comb and a clean scarf from his pack and carried them to her.|$|R
6000|$|... 'The Goths round {{his tent}} scoffed {{at me as}} a savage, and swore that I was begotten between a demon and a witch. But I remembered the time when these boasters fled from their settlements; when our tribes mounted their black steeds and hunted them like beasts! Aha, their very lips were <b>pale</b> <b>with</b> <b>fear</b> in those days.' ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{consciousness}} of this turned him <b>pale</b> <b>with</b> <b>fear,</b> for his love was deeper than she knew, and he proved {{this when he}} said in a tone so full of mingled pain and patience that it touched her to the heart: [...] "You shall respect me if I can make you, and when I've earned it, may I hope for something more?" ...|$|R
60|$|Meanwhile, {{the ancient}} {{fortress}} rang with the hideous tumult of the attack. It {{was evident that}} again and again, as their fierce war-shouts proclaimed, the Matabele were striving to scale the wall, {{and again and again}} were beaten back by the raking rifle fire. Once a triumphant yell seemed to announce their success. The fire slackened and Benita grew <b>pale</b> <b>with</b> <b>fear.</b>|$|R
60|$|And {{when the}} crowd had passed noisily along, leaving behind it a trail of torn finery, of {{glittering}} tinsel and of scarlet berries, when the boom of the big drum and the grating noise of the brass trumpets had somewhat died away, wan <b>faces,</b> <b>pale</b> <b>with</b> anxiety, would peer from out the darkness, and nervous hands would grasp with trembling fingers the small bundles of poor belongings tied up hastily in view of flight.|$|R
60|$|He {{closed the}} door behind me, and then, for an instant, I heard him talking in a low voice of {{concentrated}} passion to his wife. This gross breach of hospitality had evidently hit upon his tenderest point. I am no eavesdropper, so I walked out on to the lawn. Presently I heard a hurried step behind me, and there was the lady, her <b>face</b> <b>pale</b> <b>with</b> excitement, and her eyes red with tears.|$|R
6000|$|Medeia shrank and trembled, and her <b>face</b> grew <b>pale</b> <b>with</b> fear; and Aietes {{knew that}} she was guilty, and whispered, ‘If they win the fleece, you die!’ ...|$|R
50|$|Thor then {{prepares a}} strong {{line and a}} large hook and baits it with the ox head, which Jörmungandr bites. Thor pulls the serpent from the water, and the two face one another, Jörmungandr {{dribbling}} poison and blood. Hymir goes <b>pale</b> <b>with</b> <b>fear,</b> and as Thor grabs his hammer to kill the serpent, the giant cuts the line, leaving the serpent to sink beneath the waves.|$|R
6000|$|The lieutenant's <b>face</b> grew <b>pale</b> <b>with</b> anger, {{and he made}} {{a motion}} as if to strike the impudent boy, but one of his companions said, in a warning whisper: ...|$|R
6000|$|The Echo-dwarf stepped forward, his <b>face</b> <b>pale</b> <b>with</b> passion. [...] "Am I to believe," [...] he said, [...] "that you are {{the cause}} of this great evil that has come upon me? and that {{you are the}} wicked {{creature}} who has again started this old man upon his career of pipe-playing? What have I ever done to you that you should have condemned me for years and years to echo back the notes of those wretched pipes?" ...|$|R
60|$|From {{the moment}} that Magdalen Crawford's {{haunting}} eyes had looked straight into his for one fleeting second, an unnamable thrill of pain and pleasure stirred his heart, a thrill so strong and sudden and passionate that his <b>face</b> <b>paled</b> <b>with</b> emotion; the room seemed to swim before his eyes in a mist out of which gleamed that wonderful face with its mesmeric, darkly radiant eyes, burning their way into deeps and abysses of his soul hitherto unknown to him.|$|R
6000|$|Cassy {{entered the}} room, and found Emmeline sitting, <b>pale</b> <b>with</b> <b>fear,</b> in the furthest corner of it. As she came in, the girl started up nervously; but, on seeing who it was, rushed forward, and {{catching}} her arm, said, [...] "O Cassy, is it you? I'm so glad you've come! I was afraid it was--. O, you don't {{know what a}} horrid noise there has been, down stairs, all this evening!" ...|$|R
6000|$|A shudder went to {{the heart}} of poor Conrad, and a tremor shook the iron frame of his old father likewise. CONRAD HAD NOT BEEN CROWNED--dared he profane the throne? He hesitated and turned <b>pale</b> <b>with</b> <b>fear.</b> But it must be done. Wondering eyes were already upon him. They would be {{suspicious}} eyes if he hesitated longer. He ascended the throne. Presently he stretched forth the sceptre again, and said: ...|$|R
6000|$|Sam's <b>face</b> was <b>pale</b> <b>with</b> {{apprehension}} {{that something}} had happened to Peter; but, he said, [...] "How dat be, Massa Tom, with Sam in the next room all the time?" ...|$|R
6000|$|YANK--[Clenching his fists, his <b>face</b> growing <b>pale</b> <b>with</b> rage as if {{the skin}} in the window were a {{personal}} insult.] Trowin' it up in my face! Christ! I'll fix her! ...|$|R
60|$|The {{memory of}} the other father who had left his {{children}} in the night, never to return, made Mr. Bhaer hold his own boy close, and, for a minute, hide his face in Robby's curly hair. Emil laid his head down on his arms, Franz, went to {{put his hand on}} his uncle's shoulder, his boyish <b>face</b> <b>pale</b> <b>with</b> sympathy and sorrow, and the others sat so still that the soft rustle of the falling leaves outside was distinctly heard.|$|R
6000|$|... 20. They stabbed them in {{the back}} and sneered--a slave Who stood behind the throne, those corpses drew Each to its bloody, dark, and secret grave; And one more daring raised his steel anew To pierce the Stranger. 'What hast thou to do [...] 4400 With me, poor wretch?'--Calm, solemn and severe, That voice unstrung his sinews, and he threw His dagger on the ground, and <b>pale</b> <b>with</b> <b>fear,</b> Sate silently--his voice then did the Stranger rear.|$|R
60|$|At first Ethelberta seemed blithe {{enough without}} him. One more day went, {{and he did}} not come, and then her manner was that of apathy. Another day passed, and from fanciful {{elevations}} of the eyebrow, and long breathings, it became apparent that Ethelberta had decidedly passed the indifferent stage, and was getting seriously out of sorts about him. Next morning she looked all hope. He did not come that day either, and Ethelberta began to look <b>pale</b> <b>with</b> <b>fear.</b>|$|R
60|$|Fifteen {{minutes later}} Thurston {{took his place}} behind the boulder, and, because the light was clearer now, he could dimly see the man {{swinging}} a heavy hammer, against the rock. He knew that the miscreant, whose business was to prevent the possibility of such accidents, need only start a few more keys, which he would probably do when the dam was clear of men, and many thousand dollars' worth of property {{and the result of}} months of labor would be swallowed by the river. His <b>face</b> <b>paled</b> <b>with</b> fierce anger when he recognized this fact.|$|R
