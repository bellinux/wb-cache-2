5|$|On July 13, 1995, Cameron County {{officials}} and state authorities traveled to Mexico City to ask Mexican officials to prosecute Puentes Pizaña and Olivarez for Fischer's murder. Thousands of documents were translated from English to Spanish {{and handed over}} to Mexico's attorney general for review. On July 15, Mexican officials agreed to prosecute both of them for the murder in an international prosecution court in Mexico City. Texas prosecutors asked the Mexican government to use Article 4 of the Mexican Federal Penal Code, a little-used provision that permits Mexican citizens to be prosecuted in Mexico for crimes they committed outside the country. In order for the provision to take effect, it required the accused to be in Mexican territory; not to have faced justice {{in the country where}} the crime was committed; and that the crime was not only illegal in the country where it was committed, but also in Mexico. Murder in Mexico carries a maximum sentence of 50 years in prison, though it is common for people to be released after 15 to 25 years for good behavior. The Cameron County office said they would use a <b>federal</b> <b>prosecutor</b> from Tamaulipas as the judge. The two accused would be issued an arrest warrant and asked to appear in court where a federal judge would review their case and determine the punishment in a few months. When Puentes Pizaña heard the news, he was surprised and angered by the decision. He maintained his innocence saying he was only a car thief. Olivarez was in custody in a Matamoros prison. On September 20, a Mexican federal judge agreed to prosecute Puentes Pizaña and Olivarez for the murder. Both of them were eventually found guilty and sentenced to 15 years in prison.|$|E

40|$|The McDade Amendment (2 ̆ 2 the Act 2 ̆ 2) is {{a federal}} law that {{requires}} <b>federal</b> <b>prosecutors</b> {{to abide by the}} state ethics rules of the jurisdiction in which they practice. The Act does not say, however, whether federal or state courts are definitive when it comes to interpreting state ethics rules as they apply to <b>federal</b> <b>prosecutors.</b> Those testifying before Congress raised this issue and noted that the Act left the issue unresolved. Despite this, Congress did not address this matter in either its legislative history or in the Act itself. No court has tackled this question and scholarship attends to it only in passing. At this time, both federal and state courts interpret state ethics rules as they apply to <b>federal</b> <b>prosecutors.</b> As it currently stands, with both court systems interpreting the rules and no determination as to which is definitive, <b>federal</b> <b>prosecutors</b> must comply with both federal and state court interpretations. This is likely to chill <b>federal</b> <b>prosecutors</b> in the exercise of their official duties because they are bound to be unsure of the rules they must abide by. More importantly, concurrent interpretation creates unsolvable conflicts when a federal and state court in the same jurisdiction interpret the same rule differently. This Note explores whether federal or state courts 2 ̆ 7 interpretations of state ethics rules are definitive as applied to <b>federal</b> <b>prosecutors</b> under the McDade Amendment. It considers the plain text of the Act, its legislative history, and the purposes and policies of the legislation. Ultimately, this Note argues that the legal community should regard state courts 2 ̆ 7 interpretations as definitive.

40|$|<b>Federal</b> <b>prosecutors</b> 2 ̆ 7 {{awareness}} of political corruption {{at the state}} and local levels has recently increased concomitantly to the incidence of disclosures and prosecutions of similar corruption at the federal level. Because local law enforcement officials have frequently been unable or unwilling to pursue local political corruption, <b>federal</b> <b>prosecutors</b> have increasingly assumed responsibility for the policing of non-federal political criminal activity, even in the absence of definitive statutory grounds. In this article, the author examines the legal basis upon which federal prosecution of local political corruption is conducted. It is asserted that existing federal judicial and legislative limitations provide an inexact foundation for federal prosecution and, in actuality, promote potentially unconstitutional discretion on the part of <b>federal</b> <b>prosecutors</b> who pursue local corruption. The article identifies several constitutional issues arising from this prosecutorial discretion, especially noting the areas of the separation of powers and other federalism concepts. The article concludes with suggestions for means of limiting the discretion of <b>federal</b> <b>prosecutors</b> in the pursuit of non-federal political corruption...|$|R
