40|$|It is {{generally}} agreed that, {{for a given}} Portland cement, the rate and amount of heat liberated {{during the early stages}} of hydration (up to 28 days) is strongly influenced by the <b>fineness</b> <b>of</b> <b>grinding</b> <b>of</b> the cement (see review by Hooton et al 2005). This is intuitively correct since finer grinding means that the hydration reac¬tions between cement and water will proceed more vigorously at early ages and hence pro¬duce more heat and at a higher maximum rate. However, as Hooton et al (2005) show, opin¬ions vary in the literature as to the sensitivity of the relationship between cement fineness and early-age heat of hydration. Furthermore, when considering different cement types, the significance <b>of</b> the <b>fineness</b> <b>of</b> the cement has to be judged in relation to mineralogical parameters, such as the C 3 A, C 3 S and gypsum content, equally important factors in deter¬mining the heat characteristics of cement. In developing an assessment of the quantum and rate of heat evolution from hydrating cement, an important controllable variable is the <b>fineness</b> <b>of</b> <b>grinding</b> <b>of</b> the cement. This paper presents the results of a project in which two cement clinkers were used to produce cements with five different levels <b>of</b> <b>fineness.</b> These ten cements were then used to make concretes which were subjected to testing in an adiabatic calorimeter to determine the heat evolution characteristics. The results indicate that the effect <b>of</b> increasing <b>fineness</b> on the total amount of heat released during hydration is dependent on the mineralogy and crystal composition of the cement clinker. Also, the potential benefits of a so-called low heat cement can be lost if the cement is too finely ground. Based on simulations of temperature development using the different cement types tested, the results indicate that the <b>fineness</b> <b>of</b> <b>grinding</b> <b>of</b> cement is a more important parameter in the case of concrete elements with high cement contents but of moderate dimensions. In sections of larger dimension, coarse ground cements show lower levels of temperature development with lower thermal gradients...|$|R

40|$|The {{inability}} of swine {{as a species}} to utilize large quantities of fibrous material in the diet has led to much controversy, {{on the part of}} investigators and feeders, over the relative merits of certain feeds. The pig must rely largely on its caecum for the breakdown of dietary cellulose, thus the limited capacity of this organ must be considered in the interests of efficiency of production. It is evident that if the animal is forced to consume a diet which is bulky and highly indigestible it may become physically impossible to provide sufficient nutrients to promote maximum gains in body weight. It was such considerations that gave occasion to the early work on oats. This cereal contains about thirty percent of hulls. Oat hulls are composed largely of cellulose which is apparently quite highly lignified. This being the case, it would appear that this portion of the kernel could serve little useful purpose as a source of energy for the Pig.

40|$|Includes abstract. Includes bibliographical references. High grade ores {{have largely}} been {{depleted}} and those currently being treated are low grade, complex and sometimes finely disseminated, requiring fine grinding to liberate valuable minerals. For fine grinding applications, conventional tumbling mills are energy intensive. More energy efficient technologies such as stirred mills have been developed and widely used for fine and ultra-fine grinding. In this study, the effects of residence time, solids concentration, impeller speed, impeller type, media size and media density on energy consumption in a batch vertical stirred mill were investigated. The effect of energy on mill performance was assessed using the perfect mixing mill model. In addition, the effect of media stress intensity on grind and energy efficiency at constant residence time was also investigated. It was found that irrespective of the method of altering the energy input, the <b>fineness</b> <b>of</b> <b>grind</b> improved with increase in the specific energy input. This suggests that energy is the key driver for size reduction. The perfect mixing model {{can be used to}} assess mill performance and the breakage rates generally increased with increase in the specific energy input, impeller speed and solids concentration. The media stress intensity approach is useful in assessing mill performance in stirred mills at constant residence time. The <b>fineness</b> <b>of</b> <b>grind</b> improved when the media stress intensity was varied from 4. 41 × 10 - 3 to 27. 41 × 10 - 3 Nm. In addition, the specific energy required to produce material below 25 μm and 38 μm decreased with an increase in the media stress intensity. When slurry density effects were considered, an optimum stress intensity was observed with respect to specific energy required to produce material below 25 μm and 38 μm. It was recommended that additional test work be carried out to investigate the effect of media size in the range - 6. 7 mm + 2 mm on energy efficiency. It was also recommended that tests be carried out at impeller speed between 600 rpm and 1500 rpm to assess how mill performance increases even at relatively high impeller speeds.

This created a unique opportunity for modeling the effect of mineralogy on separation equipment and measuring reliability of the simulator in predicting perfonnance of non-concentration equipment, such as hydrocyclones and fine screens, under different operating and feed conditions. While performance of concentration devices including magnetic separator, hydroseparator and flotation banks was expected to show dependence on variation in mineralogy, particularly on liberation size, performance of classification and screening devices would be largely independent of the liberation characteristics. Therefore, the models were expected to reasonably simulate the performance of these devices for a given blend when plant data from the other blend was available.

ABSTRACT: The {{necessity}} of applying materials with high degree <b>of</b> <b>fineness</b> {{in the contemporary}} technologies require used to modern technology in mechanical comminution of different substances, which will assure demanded particle size distribution <b>of</b> <b>grinding</b> product. The scientific performances are mostly aimed at the search for new work conditions <b>of</b> industrial <b>grinding</b> devices, which should guarantee parameters and <b>fineness</b> <b>of</b> <b>grinding</b> products and should decrease energy consuming <b>of</b> <b>grinding</b> and improve environmental protection. All the above seems to be met in the researches <b>of</b> granular materials <b>grinding</b> in the high-energetic fluidized bed. The fluidized jet grinding relies on keeping up a turbulent fluidization in the <b>grinding</b> chamber <b>of</b> mill, which {{is a result of}} collisions of air counter-fluxes. They make it possible to obtain high-energetic fluidized bed, which in turn ensures an effective comminution of tested granular material. The state of pulsatory fluidization is created in the certain surroundings of an axial zone of the fluidized bed. The state of fountain fluidization is created in the axial zone of the fluidized bed, which is characterised by carryover of grains in the zone of high velocities in the centre core <b>of</b> <b>grinding</b> chamber, then by gravitational falling of coarse fraction near walls and by carrying away of the small fraction by the flowing gas into the separation system. The theoretical basis and experimental results for the fluidized jet <b>grinding</b> <b>of</b> granular materials are presented in the paper. The researches were performed on a laboratory fluidized bed opposed jet mill. The experiment contained <b>grinding</b> tests <b>of</b> selected narrow size fraction of limestone in turbulent fluidized layer conditions. The aim of researches was to explain the influence of the values of rotational speed of flow classifier rotor on the efficiency of mill and the particle size distribution <b>of</b> <b>grinding</b> product.

40|$|Abstract. The {{objective}} {{of this paper was}} to review the literature on effects of different methods of processing of grain fraction of the starter feeds for young dairy calves, as well as providing another part of starter which is a source of protein, minerals and vitamins in different physical forms. The second aim was to discus the impact of the main protein sources for starter feeds on performance of preweaning and posteweaning dairy calves. The main criteria for assessment of physical form effect and sources of protein in the starter feeds were intake of dry feeds, daily live weight gain and frame size growth of calves, morphological and functional development of forestomachs, digestibility of feeds and health status of young calves. Data show big variations and lack of consistency of experimental results. Good results were achieved when calves were fed whole, ground, dry-rolled, pelleted and steam-flaked grains. It seemed that <b>fineness</b> <b>of</b> <b>grinding</b> and quantities <b>of</b> fine fraction were important for starter intake. Steam-flaking and grinding improved digestibility to the same extent, but whole grain stimulated chewing and improved rumen environment for bacteria growth. Soybean meal was the most palatable and ensured best performance of calves. Evidently, it is possible to replace soybean meal with rape seed, canola type meal, dry distillers grain with solubles (DDGS) and other protein sources which contain more fiber and are less digestible. However, it is difficult to appraise how much and at what conditions is it possible to replace completely or a maximum possible portion of soybean meal. Additional studies are needed to clarify interactions between physical form of starters, rumen fermentation environments and age of calves.

40|$|Out-of-feed {{events are}} {{a growing problem}} in nursery and grow-finish­ {{facilities}} due to issues associated with feed delivery to bulk bins and bridging of feed in bulk bins. Reports of bridging are increasing as producers continue to reduce the <b>fineness</b> <b>of</b> <b>grind</b> for complete diets {{in order to improve}} feed conversion. A study was conducted to examine the effect of repeated out-of-feed events and diet particle size on barrow performance in a wean-to-finish facility beginning six weeks after weaning. Corn-soybean meal based diets were either coarse (1, 266 microns) or medium ground (1, 019 microns) {{for the duration of the}} experiment. Within particle size, pigs were never out-of-feed or denied access to feed for a 20 -hour period beginning at noon on a random day each week for 16 weeks. For the first eight weeks, weekly out-of-feed events reduced daily gain 0. 15 lb/day compared to the never out-of-feed treatment (P 3 ̆c 0. 001) due to a reduction in daily feed intake (P= 0. 003) with no effect on feed conversion efficiency. There was no effect of out-of-feed events on daily gain or feed conversion for the second eight week period of the experiment. For the 109 -day trial period, weekly random 20 -hour out-of-feed events resulted in a 0. 077 lb/day decrease in daily gain with no effect on feed conversion. The 247 micron reduction in average diet particle size resulted in a 0. 091 lb/lb improvement in overall feed conversion (P= 0. 001) for the coarse versus medium ground diets. There was no effect of any experimental treatment on skin lesion scores, a measure of pig welfare and injury from fighting at the feeder. There was no interaction of out-of-feed events and diet particle size. These results suggest that out-of- feed events can have major consequences for pig performance. However, pigs appear to adjust to weekly out-of-feed events, even when they occurred on a random day within each week. The penalty for repeated out-of-feed events is a reduction in daily gain, with no impact on feed conversion, while the penalty for coarser ground diets is a worsening in feed conversion, with no change in daily gain...|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} of high digestible grain sorghum (HDGS) with a modified starch protein endosperm matrix to replace corn in ethanol production was investigated using dry grind simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF). Preliminary experiments showed that HDGS yielded higher amounts of glucose and ethanol than normal digestible grain sorghum (NDGS) and corn {{particularly in the}} first 48 hrs of fermentation. It was hypothesized that fast conversion of starch to glucose and ethanol during hydrolysis and fermentation are results of improved protein digestibility of HDGS. The invagination of protein structures in HDGS produced a flourier endosperm texture, softer kernels and lower starch content than the normal digestible protein (ND) lines. Highly digestible protein (HD) lines have better pasting properties (significantly lower pasting temperature, faster rate of gelatinization and higher peak viscosity) than ND lines based on the RVA profile. Increasing protein digestibility of the HDGS improved starch digestibility (increased rate of glucose conversion and total glucose yield during saccharification), which is supported by highly significant correlation of turbidity with rate of glucose conversion and efficiency of enzymatic conversion. The efficiency of ethanol conversion is significantly correlated with starch digestibility, pasting properties, and protein digestibility. Results also showed that HD sorghum lines had significantly faster rate of conversion and shorter reaction time needed to achieve completion than ND sorghum lines and corn. Increasing the dry solid concentration from 22 % to 30 % (w/v) increased the ethanol yield from 8 % v/v to 13 %v/v. This will allow considerable saving of water, reduced distillation cost and increased ethanol production for a given plant capacity and labor cost. <b>Fineness</b> <b>of</b> <b>grind</b> influences the amount of sugar formed due to variation in surface area of the flour.

The {{formation}} {{of the structure of}} hardened concrete grouting with two-stage expansion is a complex process that is influenced by many factors, both of a prescriptive nature (composition and additive dosage, mineralogical composition of Portland cement clinker, concrete composition, the presence of chemical additives) and in terms <b>of</b> process (the <b>fineness</b> <b>of</b> cement <b>grinding,</b> temperature <b>of</b> curing, etc.).

For the evaluation of the influence of different factors on the process of gas generation, an effectiveness ratio of gas generation is proposed by the authors. Results. The article presents the results of an investigation into the influence of the amount of gassing agent and the type and dosage of superplasticiser on the process of gassing by means of the displacement method on the mortar mix. The authors similarly propose a expansion efficiency coefficient. The article presents the results of the investigation into the influence of the amount of gassing agent, the presence and amount of superplasticiser, the sand/cement ratio, aggregate size and water-cement ratio during the first stage of expansion of the mixture. The authors propose a formula for describing the dependence of the relative expansion deformations on the concentration of filler. In order to assess the conditions in which a mixture is present, it is proposed to use an indicator consisting in the constraint expansion coefficient. Conclusion. Use of the hardening condition coefficient is proposed as a means of accounting for the effect of curing conditions on the strength of the concrete grouting with two-stage expansion.

A population-balance model (PBM) to predict gold gravity recovery was developed at McGill University in 1994 (Laplante et al, 1995). The objective of this research was to make this PBM user friendly. This was achieved in two different ways. First, the behavior of gravity recoverable gold (GRG) in secondary ball mills and hydrocyclones was described by two parameters, tau and R- 25 mum, and these parameters were linked to the circulating load of ore and the <b>fineness</b> <b>of</b> the <b>grinding</b> circuit product, for easy estimation. Second, the database of simulations produced by the PBM was represented by two multilinear regressions (one for coarse GRG, the other for fine GRG) linking the predicted GRG recovery to the natural logarithm of tau, R- 25 mum, the size distribution of the GRG and the recovery effort (Re), defined as the proportion, in %, of the GRG in the circulating load recovered by gravity. Re was found to be the most significant parameter, tau the least. The GRG size distribution, represented either by two (coarse GRG) or three (fine GRG) points on the cumulative passing curve, has a significant impact on recovery. A total of twenty different GRG size distributions were used to generate the simulation database. The multilinear regressions were tested on four case studies, and found to predict GRG recovery well within the precision with which the GRG content can be measured, a relative 5 %. Whenever size-by-size recovery data are available, the PBM itself would be used; if not, the simpler regressions would be preferred...|$|R
