25|$|On October 16, 2009 the Global Consortium of Nazarene Graduate Seminaries and Schools of Theology (GCNGSST) {{was inaugurated}} in Manchester, England. It {{comprised}} the following eight institutions: Africa Nazarene University (Ongata Rongai, Kenya); Asia-Pacific Nazarene Theological Seminary (Taytay, Rizal, Philippines); Brazil Nazarene College (Faculdade Nazarena do Brasil) (Campinas, Brazil); Korea Nazarene University (Cheonan, South Korea); Nazarene Theological College, (Brisbane, Australia); Nazarene Theological College, (Manchester, England); Nazarene Theological Seminary (Kansas City, Missouri); and Seminario Nazareno de las Americas (SENDAS) (San Jose, Costa Rica). Nazarene educational institutions are {{overseen by the}} Nazarene International Board of Education (IBOE). Funded through {{a grant from the}} Henry Luce Foundation, the consortium connects Nazarene seminaries by optimizing the <b>global</b> <b>resources</b> available for theological education. While much of the work of the consortium is done throughout the year via video conferencing, subsequent meetings of the presidents and academic deans of the member institutions were held on the campuses of Korean Nazarene University in October 2010, and Nazarene Theological Seminary in August 2012.|$|E

2500|$|Despite {{billions of}} dollars of investment, its bitumen - {{especially}} within the Athabasca oil sands - is still only a partially exploited resource. By 2025 this and other unconventional oil resources - the northern and offshore frontiers and heavy crude oil resources in the West - could place Canada in the top ranks among the world's oil producing and exporting nations. In a 2004 reassessment of <b>global</b> <b>resources,</b> the United States' EIA put Canadian oil reserves second; only Saudi Arabia has greater proved reserves. In 2014, the EIA now ranks Canada as third in World Oil Reserves at around 175 billion barrels, while Saudi Arabia is 2nd with around 268 billion barrels and Venezuela is ranked first with around 297 billion barrels of reserves.|$|E
2500|$|The University Yard is {{the main}} open space and {{historic}} heart of the university. Along with George Washington's main library, Gelman Library, they constitute {{the hub of the}} main campus. The seven-story Gelman Library building contains over two million volumes and is constructed in the Brutalist architectural style of the 1970s. It features a concrete façade punctuated by windows that are divided by projecting vertical slabs. For most of the year, parts of the library are open 24 hours a day, seven days per week for use by students, faculty and staff. The seventh floor of the library includes the Special Collections Research Center, National Security Archives, <b>Global</b> <b>Resources</b> Center and Kiev Library. The NSA is a research institution that publishes declassified U.S. government files concerning selected topics of American foreign policy.

40|$|In {{order to}} curb {{environmental}} impact, absolute resource use reductions are urgently needed. To reach this goal, multi-scalar synergies and trade-offs in <b>global</b> <b>resource</b> use must be effectively addressed. We propose that better understanding {{the role of}} extractive economies—economies that extract raw material for export—in <b>global</b> <b>resource</b> use patterns is a prerequisite to identifying such synergies and trade-offs. By combining a system-wide environmental accounting perspective with insights from political ecology and political economy research, we demonstrate that (1) the extractivist expansion may be the corollary of reduced immediate environmental impact in the industrialized countries; and (2) the material flow patterns on which this result is based do not suffice to identify the mechanisms underlying extractivist development {{and its role in}} <b>global</b> <b>resource</b> use. Our work on extractive economies illustrates that, in order to supply transformative knowledge for sustainability transformation, biophysical and socio-political conceptualizations of society-nature relations must be more strongly integrated within the interdisciplinary sustainability sciences in general and social ecology in particular...|$|R
