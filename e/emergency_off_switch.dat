The contact sensor has a threshold limit switch adjustable to a radial operating force, for releasing an emergency off signal.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a slewing crane with electromagnet, operated by three three-phase induction motors but powered from a single-phase power supply. A switchboard drives the motors and the electromagnet. From its seat – {{mounted on the}} crane – an operator can make the crane arm slew left or right. The electromagnet can be moved back, forward, up or down and is capable of lifting 80 kg loads. Crane slewing is limited to an 180 º angle, for safety reasons. Pressing an <b>emergency</b> button <b>switches</b> <b>off</b> all command circuits.

40|$|It {{is clear}} {{that one of the}} primary tools we can use to {{mitigate}} the potential risk from a misbehaving AI system is the ability to turn the system off. As the capabilities of AI systems improve, it is important to ensure that such systems do not adopt subgoals that prevent a human from <b>switching</b> them <b>off.</b> This is a challenge because many formulations of rational agents create strong incentives for self-preservation. This is not caused by a built-in instinct, but because a rational agent will maximize expected utility and cannot achieve whatever objective it has been given if it is dead. Our goal is to study the incentives an agent has to allow itself to be <b>switched</b> <b>off.</b> We analyze a simple game between a human H and a robot R, where H can press R's <b>off</b> <b>switch</b> but R can disable the <b>off</b> <b>switch.</b> A traditional agent takes its reward function for granted: we show that such agents have an incentive to disable the <b>off</b> <b>switch,</b> except in the special case where H is perfectly rational. Our key insight is that for R to want to preserve its <b>off</b> <b>switch,</b> it needs to be uncertain about the utility associated with the outcome, and to treat H's actions as important observations about that utility. (R also has no incentive to <b>switch</b> itself <b>off</b> in this setting.) We conclude that giving machines an appropriate level of uncertainty about their objectives leads to safer designs, and we argue that this setting is a useful generalization of the classical AI paradigm of rational agents...|$|R

30|$|Based on some careful {{studies and}} {{extensive}} experiments, recently A. Dixit et al. proposed a packet-level traffic splitting scheme named RPS (Random Packet Spraying) [11] for data center networks. RPS achieves near ideal load balance and network utilization, and causes little packet reordering by exploiting the symmetry of the multi-rooted tree topologies. Noticing that THS’s strategy of powering <b>off</b> <b>switches</b> barely affects the symmetry {{of the network}} since we always choose the leftmost switches. Therefore, after obtaining the required subset and adding FT-redundancy, we directly borrow the packet-level RPS multipath routing scheme to spread all flows equally among multiple different equal cost shortest paths. Then <b>switch</b> <b>off</b> the <b>switches</b> and ports which {{are not involved in}} final subset and update the network topology. The whole THS procedure is depicted in detail in Algorithm 2.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{controllable}} resistive type fault current limiter (CR-FCL) is introduced. The CR-FCL inserts a pre-specified value of resistance {{based on a}} pre-defined function, by using a simple switching method, in series with the fault current path. When a fault occurs, a self turn <b>off</b> <b>switch</b> starts switching with a pre-specified frequency and duty cycle. By this switching pattern, the controlled value of resistance enters to the fault current path. So, the CR-FCL limits the fault current to the desired values. In addition, from transient stability point of view, by inserting the optimal resistance value, the CR-FCL is capable to enhance power system transient stability in a good manner. In fact, generation of the controllable resistance {{that depends on the}} duty cycle of the self turn <b>off</b> <b>switch</b> is the main idea of the CR-FCL. The variable duty cycle results the variable resistance and the fixed duty cycle results the fixed resistance. Analytical analyses of the proposed FCL are presented in details. Simulation results by power system computer-aided design/electromagnetic transients, including dc (PSCAD/EMTDC) software and corresponding experimental results are studied to validate the effectiveness of the CR-FCL. Considering error analyses, there is the good agreement between the simulation results and the experimental results...|$|R
