500|$|The {{weight of}} information, and its {{constant}} repetition, made an apparently strong case against Driberg, and former friends such as Mervyn Stockwood, the Bishop of Southwark, {{became convinced that}} he had indeed betrayed his country. Other friends and colleagues were more sceptical. According to ex-Labour MP Reginald Paget, not even the security services were [...] "lunatic enough to recruit a man like Driberg", who was famously indiscreet and could never <b>keep</b> <b>a</b> <b>secret.</b> Mitrokhin's [...] "blackmail" [...] story is questioned by historian Jeff Sharlet, {{on the grounds that}} by the 1950s and 1960s Driberg's homosexuality had been an open secret in British political circles for many years; he frequently boasted of his [...] "rough trade" [...] conquests to his colleagues.

General Edgar Russel, chief signal officer of the AEF, extolled their service as [...] "indispensable". Reminiscing about her wartime experience as chief operator, Banker humorously noted that [...] "an afternoon in the switchboard office sometimes sounded like a scene from Alice in Wonderland, where only the initiated can make sense of the proceedings". She also noted the confidentiality aspect of her assignment when she was tested by an intelligence officer about her ability to <b>keep</b> <b>a</b> <b>secret,</b> which was about her posting out of the unit. About her work at the war front she said that [...] "the secrecy surrounding their operations gave it an aura of romance and set it apart from the civilian work". After returning from the war front with her team, she reflected: [...] "We missed the First Army with its code of loyalty and hard work. We were back in the petty squabbles of civilian life where even chief operators had 'tantrums' and where the wives of civilians attached to the Peace Conference spilled all over Paris in Army cars." ...|$|E

Baldwin and Basinger are furious at Homer for breaking their trust, and immediately end their friendship with him and kick him out of their house, and Homer sadly walks to the gate while being pelted with rocks by the citizens. Bitter about losing his celebrity friends and once again feeling like a nobody, Homer begins a mobile museum, entitled [...] "Museum of Hollywood Jerks", which displays the couple's personal belongings {{in an attempt to}} expose them as being selfish and uncaring. Basinger, Baldwin and Howard discover the museum while intending to apologize to Homer. A high-speed chase quickly ensues between Homer, in his mobile museum, and the celebrities in their Hummer. Homer agrees to stop after Ron Howard is injured during the chase. Homer is ordered by a court of law to remain 500 miles away from any celebrity, both living or dead. One month later, Ron Howard pitches Homer's screenplay from earlier to Brian Grazer of 20th Century Fox, and over a still of Howard rejoicing over securing the deal, a snippet of the theme song of Happy Days is played.|$|E

500|$|Eastwood married Margaret Neville [...] "Maggie" [...] Johnson (born 1931; {{then working}} for an auto parts {{suppliers}} company) on December 19, 1953 in Pasadena. They had met {{six months earlier}} {{on a blind date}} in Los Angeles, although Eastwood subsequently had a serious relationship in Seattle that summer with a young woman who became pregnant with his child—an alleged daughter who was given up for adoption, per biographer Patrick McGilligan—before Johnson announced her engagement to him in October. The marriage would not prove altogether smooth. [...] "He thought they were too young, not well enough established," [...] remarked biographer Richard Schickel in the only authorized book ever written about Eastwood. A decade later, an ongoing affair Eastwood was involved in (said to have lasted 14 years) with dancer and Rawhide stuntwoman Roxanne Tunis (who was also married yet separated) produced his earliest verified child, daughter Kimber Eastwood (born Kimber Tunis; June 17, 1964), whose existence was kept secret from the public until July 1989, when the National Enquirer revealed her identity. Biographer Marc Eliot wrote of Johnson, [...] "It is difficult to say for sure that she actually knew about the baby, although it would have been nearly impossible for her not to. Everyone on the set knew ... and it is simply too difficult to <b>keep</b> <b>a</b> <b>secret</b> like that when the mother and the illegitimate child live in the same small town, especially when that small town is Hollywood." [...] The source for the 1989 Enquirer article that originally broke the story claimed Johnson was aware of Kimber's existence at all times and even met Roxanne Tunis in person when making an unannounced visit to the set of Breezy in 1972. Actress Barbara Eden, a onetime Rawhide guest star and witness to the affair with Tunis, said of Eastwood's relationship with Johnson: [...] "They conducted a somewhat open marriage." ...|$|E
500|$|Gravemind {{is one of}} {{the primary}} antagonists of Halo 3. While the Master Chief and Arbiter have {{returned}} to Earth in order to stop the Prophet of Truth, the religious leader of the Covenant, from activating a Forerunner artifact buried in Africa, Gravemind turns High Charity into a Flood hive and sends an infected cruiser to Earth in an attempt to infest the planet; this plan fails, and a message from Cortana informs the Master Chief and allies of the existence of the Ark, a special installation built by the Forerunners outside of the Milky Way galaxy where all the Halos can be fired remotely. Gravemind, the Arbiter, and the Master Chief all want to stop the High Prophet of Truth from activating the rings, so the Flood once again ally with the Chief and Arbiter. As soon as [...] Truth is killed, however, the Gravemind betrays both the Master Chief and the Arbiter, The Chief escapes the Flood's clutches and rescues Cortana from High Charity. Despite being tortured by Gravemind, Cortana has managed to <b>keep</b> <b>a</b> <b>secret</b> safe from the Flood; she has the activation index of Installation 04, which she captured from 343 Guilty Spark during [...] Using the index, Cortana can activate the local ringworld, destroying Gravemind and the Flood, but sparing the galaxy's sentient life. Gravemind finally gains this knowledge, but too late; the Master Chief escapes with Cortana, destroying High Charity in the process. Gravemind survives the blast and attempts to rebuild himself on the new ring. Despite his best efforts, the Master Chief and company activate Halo, destroying it and defeating the Flood once again.

2500|$|Dolly Singh {{is played}} by Sheena Bajaj. Her {{character}} {{is the equivalent of}} the Good Luck Charlie character Teddy Duncan, who {{is played by}} Bridgit Mendler. She is Nikki's only sister, and the second-oldest child in the Singh family. Sensing that she will not be around as much when Nikki is grown, she produces and directs video diaries for her, giving advice she hopes will help Nikki be successful as a teenager. She produces these video diaries {{at the end of every}} episode and ends them by saying, [...] "Best of Luck, Nikki." [...] Her best friend is Pam. Throughout the show, Dolly has had numerous boyfriends. She dated Ritesh (Shaheer Sheikh) in season one, but they broke up after she caught him two-timing both her and a pretty, dim-witted brunette named Maya. She and Maya later become friends. She dates Rahul in season two, with the two of them getting together in the episode Can You <b>Keep</b> <b>A</b> <b>Secret?</b> Dolly is often shown caring for her brothers, such as saving Rohan from falling out of the treehouse window, or offering to help Sunny deal with Guri, who has given him a black eye.|$|E
2500|$|Rohan Singh {{is played}} by Murtuza Kutianawala. He is the eldest Singh sibling. He and Dolly often fight, {{although}} they care about each other, and he usually gets along well with his younger brother, Sunny. He often appears awkward, somewhat careless, and childish, but on numerous occasions {{has been known to}} be resourceful, creative, and intelligent. He has also been shown to be a good cook, and Avatar once tricked Himani (who isn't a very good cook) into working later so that Rohan would cook. He and his best friend Popi have their own band. Rohan occasionally uses his younger sister Nikki for his personal gain, like when he uses her to make big tips while working for Kukkad Nukkad by saying that his mother was in the hospital when she actually worked there (customers just assumed she was ill). He dated Dolly's friend Maya, who like him is a scatterbrain, but they broke up in Rohan in the City, when Maya had to move to Mumbai because of her father's new job. He was originally intended to be named Rohan Singh, but Avatar was nervous as he was writing on his birth certificate, resulting in the legal name of [...] "Rohini Singh". Despite Avatar trying to correct this in the season two episode Can You <b>Keep</b> <b>a</b> <b>Secret?,</b> he accidentally changed the intended name to [...] "Rona Ping". In season three, Rohan moves into an apartment shared with Popi, but is still in the Singh house a lot. In Good Luck Charlie, Rohan is the equivalent of PJ Duncan who {{is played by}} Jason Dolley.|$|E

2500|$|Sheldon {{possesses}} an eidetic {{memory and}} an IQ of 187, although he claims his IQ cannot be accurately measured by normal tests. He originally {{claimed to have}} a master's degree and two doctoral degrees, but this list has increased. Sheldon has an extensive general knowledge in many subjects including physics, chemistry, biology, astronomy, cosmology, algebra, calculus, differential equations, vector calculus, computers, electronics, economics, vexillology, engineering, history, geography, linguistics, football, and trains, {{and in addition to}} a knowledge of Klingon from Star Trek, he has studied Finnish and Mandarin Chinese. He also shows great talent in music, knowing how to play the piano, recorder, and theremin and also having perfect pitch. [...] Although his friends have similar intellects to him, his eccentricities, stubbornness, and lack of empathy often frustrate them. Sheldon occasionally uses slang (in a very unnatural fashion), and follows jokes with his catchphrase [...] "Bazinga!" [...] which is now an officially registered trademark of Warner Bros. He is uncomfortable with human physical contact and has germophobia, which makes his exceptionally rare hugs extremely awkward and painful-looking. He also has haemophobia, which causes him to faint at the sight of blood. Sheldon has difficulty coping when he is interrupted, when asked to <b>keep</b> <b>a</b> <b>secret,</b> or when he hears arguing. He is also a notary public and uses his knowledge in law and contracts usually for his own advantage and is always distressed when challenged in a legal aspect that he cannot logically defend. In his mannerisms, Sheldon also shows symptoms associated with obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. Whenever approaching a person's home, he must knock three times, then say the person's name, and must repeat this at least three times. Upon entering a person's home, he must select the proper seat before sitting down. When it is suggested by Penny that he [...] "just sit anywhere", his response is [...] "Oh, no, if only it were that simple!" [...] This extends to his inability to accept change. His rigidity in maintaining homeostasis often causes him frustration. Because of his rigidity and stubbornness, only his mother and Bernadette – both possessing strong maternal instincts – are able to control him.|$|E
2500|$|Series 6 in 2011 {{continues}} to examine mysteries left unexplained {{at the end}} of Series 5. In [...] "The Impossible Astronaut"/"Day of the Moon", Amy, Rory and River witness a future version of the Doctor murdered, which they vow to <b>keep</b> <b>a</b> <b>secret</b> from the present-day Doctor as they encounter hypnotic aliens called [...] "the Silence". Eventually, Amy unknowingly lets slip that the Doctor dies in [...] "The Almost People", when it also turns out that she is pregnant and has been kidnapped by the nefarious Madame Kovarian (Frances Barber). In [...] "A Good Man Goes to War", the Doctor calls in old favours from across time and space to raise an army to rescue Amy from Demons Run, an asteroid in the 52nd century being used as a base by a religious order, but is unable to rescue her child, Melody Pond. The Doctor also learns that Melody—though Rory and Amy's child—is part Time Lord due to being conceived in the TARDIS, and will grow up to become River Song. In [...] "Let's Kill Hitler", the Doctor encounters a younger iteration of River and learns she has been conditioned by the Silence, explained to be a religious order, to assassinate him. She nearly succeeds using a kiss of poisoned lipstick before Amy convinces her to save his life instead. The Doctor also learns the circumstances of his death from historical records on a time-travelling shape-shifting robot ship called the Teselecta. In [...] "The God Complex", the Doctor leaves Amy and Rory on Earth when he realises Amy's apotheosis of him endangers their lives. Some time passes before the Doctor is ready to confront his death. In [...] "The Wedding of River Song", he devises an escape by concealing himself within the Teselecta, which is disguised to look like him, to make it seem he is shot and burned as history records. In a doomed alternate reality caused by River's reluctance to shoot the Doctor, the two become married; during the ceremony, she is let in on the Doctor's original plan and helps fake and corroborate his death. The Doctor is then warned by his old friend Dorium Maldovar (Simon Fisher Becker) that more prophecies still concern him. The Doctor learns he will be asked the oldest question in the universe, [...] "Doctor who?", on the battlefields of Trenzalore; the Silence had intended his death to prevent this.|$|E
