25|$|With {{millions}} of others I had prayed hard {{at the time of}} Dunkirk and never did prayer seem to be more speedily answered to the full. And we prayed for France and the next day she surrendered. I thought much, and when I went to bed I lay for a long time vividly awake. And I went over in my mind what had happened, concentrating on the thoughts that you had dwelt on, that prayer to be effective must be in accordance with God's will, and that by far the hardest thing to say from the heart and indeed the last lesson we learn (if we ever do) is to say and mean it, ‘Thy will be done.’ And I thought what mites we all are and how we can never see God's plan, a plan on such a scale that it must be incomprehensible. And suddenly for what must have been a couple of minutes I seemed to see with extraordinary and vivid clarity and to hear someone speaking to me. The words at the time were clear, but the recollection of them had passed when I seemed to come to, as it were, but the sense remained, and the sense was this. ‘You cannot see the plan’; then ‘Have you not thought there is a purpose in stripping you one by one of all the human props on which you depend, that you are being left alone <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world?</b> <b>You</b> have now one upon whom to lean and I have chosen you as my instrument to work with my will. Why then are you afraid?’ And to prove ourselves worthy of that tremendous task is our job.|$|E

500|$|After the {{presidency}} of Jimmy Carter (who dramatically reduced the formality of presidential functions), Reagan brought a Kennedy-esque glamour back into the White House. She hosted 56 state dinners over eight years. She remarked that hosting the dinners is [...] "the easiest thing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> <b>You</b> don't have to do anything. Just {{have a good time}} and do a little business. And that's the way Washington works." [...] The White House residence staff found Reagan demanding to work for during the preparation for the state dinners, with the First Lady overseeing every aspect of meal presentations, and sometimes requesting one dessert after another be prepared, before finally settling on one she approved of.|$|E

[...] Hasselhoff enjoyed his cameo: [...] "It was great fun {{and to this day}} around the world kids stop me and say, 'Are you David Hasselhoff?' because I was the only human in the picture." [...] Hasselhoff said that the film gained him new fans: [...] "It's amazing - so many of the kids were so young and didn't see Baywatch and Knight Rider so I got a whole new legion of fans." ...|$|E
500|$|After leaving The Simpsons and The George Carlin Show, Simon {{sought to}} find a [...] "life outside television," [...] as working in the {{industry}} [...] "made [...] crazy." [...] On working in television, Simon concluded: [...] "In some ways, it's the greatest job <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> <b>You</b> make a product that's given away, and all it does is make people smile. Nobody gets hurt, there's no damage, {{and you can get}} crazy rich." [...] Simon retired from full-time television work, although still worked in the media, frequently contributing, as a writer and a participant, to Howard Stern's radio shows. He wrote and directed the one-off radio sitcom [...] "The Bitter Half" [...] for Stern's Howard 101 in 2006. Simon had his own show on Radioio. Simon returned to television production work in 2012, serving as a consultant and director on the series Anger Management for half a day a week.|$|E
500|$|Guitar Hero: Metallica was {{revealed}} to be in production when an analyst for Wedbush Morgan Securities discovered mention {{of the game in}} Activision's 2008 SEC filings, slated to be released in [...] "fiscal 2009". The band was approached in April 2008, who quickly agreed to the game as a [...] "no brainer". [...] Development for the game began {{in the second quarter of}} 2008, according to lead designer Alan Flores. [...] Two posts made to Metallica's website in June 2008 also referred to the [...] "not so top secret GH thing", and that Guitar Hero players could expect [...] "a pile of 'Tallica songs." [...] Lars Ulrich, when asked about the game during an interview with MTV, stated that [...] "the people at ‘Guitar Hero’ and Activision are rapidly becoming our best new friends <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> <b>You</b> can put the rest of it together yourself." [...] Ulrich stated that the idea for the Metallica-themed Guitar Hero game came from the influence the original Guitar Hero games had on Ulrich and James Hetfield's children, learning about music and older bands such as Deep Purple and Black Sabbath.|$|E

500|$|In [...] "Masterpiece", Madonna sings {{about the}} pain of being {{in love with someone}} who is a great work of art, with the lyrics {{including}} [...] "If you were the Mona Lisa, You'd be hanging in the Louvre, Everyone would come to see you, You'd be impossible to move." [...] Madonna said the song describes Wallis Simpson and is [...] "about a woman who has fallen in love with this untouchable thing, this man that was raised to be king. One of the lines of the song 'it must be so hard to always be the chosen one.' At {{the end of the day}} nothing is indestructible, no matter how high you might rise <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>you</b> are still a human being." [...] Marc Schneider from Billboard described [...] "Masterpiece" [...] as a slowed-down, moody ballad that showcases strong execution of vocals from Madonna. He described the production as [...] "simple, direct and reminiscent of her sound in the 1990s". The lyrics were described as emotional, and was comparable to the film's love story, with the chorus as follows: [...] "And I'm right by your side, Like a thief in the night, I stand in front of a masterpiece. And I can't tell you why it hurts so much to be in love with a masterpiece. 'Cause after all, nothing's indestructible".|$|E
500|$|In March 2014, Dinklage {{confirmed}} that Season 4 would [...] "stick fairly closely" [...] to Tyrion's plot line in A Storm of Swords, adding that [...] "those reversals of fortune really send [...] down the rabbit hole." [...] He {{notes that the}} character changes in Season 4, and [...] "really ends up {{in a different place}} than he thought he was going to. It's fueled a bit by anger towards his family, and trying to find his place <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> <b>You</b> see that some people rely on drunk, funny Tyrion. I think funny and drunk lasts only so long. He sobers up in many ways. And love is in his life , and that causes a tremendous amount of damage – because he's vulnerable and he doesn't like to be vulnerable. He's completely stripped of his defense mechanisms." [...] Of Tyrion's relationship with his brother Jaime, Dinklage said, [...] "If you're raised together, you have an unspoken dialogue many times, and it's very easy, especially between Jaime and Tyrion. They have a real friendship, a good brotherhood. They look after each other." [...] As in the novels, Tyrion is (unfairly) found guilty of Joffrey's murder and condemned to death; the HBO series does not use the reveal that his first wife was not really a prostitute to motivate Tyrion to kill his father, and he does not lie to Jaime that he is guilty of killing Joffrey.|$|E
500|$|Starting with Madonna's voice multi-tracked {{questioning}} – [...] "Am I gonna be a star?", [...] "Should I {{change my}} name?" [...] – the lyrics develop into what Rikky Rooksby of The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna {{states is a}} complaint about modern-day life. She also questions the shallowness of modern life and the [...] "American dream." [...] "I know it sounds clichéd," [...] she admitted. [...] "But I've had 20 years of fame and fortune, and I feel that I {{have the right to}} an opinion on what it is and isn't. All everyone is obsessed about now is being a celebrity. I'm saying that's bullshit, and who knows better than me? Before it happens, you have all kinds of notions about how wonderful celebrity is and how much joy it's going to bring you. Then you arrive... In America, more than any other place <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> <b>you</b> have the freedom to be anything you want to be. Which is all well and good, but it only works if you have a value system – and we seem not to have one anymore. It's, 'Whatever it takes to get to the top, that's what you gotta do.' It's the allure of the beautiful life: 'Look like this, you're gonna be happy. Drive this car, you're gonna be popular. Wear these clothes and people are gonna want to fuck you.' It's a very powerful illusion and people are caught up in it, including myself. Or I was." ...|$|E

While playing in England, {{he liked to}} chant Lord Hawke's name and chat to the spectators {{with his back to}} the play.

[...] Its central character, Ignatius J.

2500|$|Much of {{the success}} of rock in Australia is {{attributed}} to the non-commercial Australian Broadcasting Corporation's radio station Triple J, which focuses heavily on Australian alternative music, and has done so since its formation as 2JJ in 1975. Throughout the station's history, they have helped jump start the careers of numerous bands, through programs such as Unearthed, the Australian Music program Home & Hosed and the Hottest 100. The Big Day Out festival has showcased Australian and international acts, with line-ups spanning multiple genres, with an alternative focus. It has become highly popular amongst musicians; Foo Fighters lead singer Dave Grohl said [...] "We play the Big Day Out because it's the best tour <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> <b>You</b> ask any band in the world – they all want to play the Big Day Out, every single one of them." [...] Other festivals, such as Homebake, Livid, and Splendour in the Grass, are also rock focused, and together with Big Day Out are [...] "united by the dominant presence of the indie-guitar scene".|$|E
