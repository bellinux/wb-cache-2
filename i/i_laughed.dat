500|$|In September 1990, Buzz Osborne of the Melvins {{introduced}} the band to Dave Grohl, {{who was looking}} for a new band following the sudden break-up of Washington, D.C., hardcore punks Scream. A few days after arriving in Seattle, Novoselic and Cobain auditioned Grohl, with Novoselic later stating, [...] "We knew in two minutes that he was the right drummer". Grohl later told Q [...] "I remember being {{in the same room with}} them and thinking, 'What? Thats Nirvana? Are you kidding?'" [...] and [...] "Because on their record cover they looked like psycho lumberjacks... I was like, 'What, that little dude and that big motherfucker? You're kidding me'. <b>I</b> <b>laughed.</b> I was like, 'No way'".|$|E
500|$|UGO Networks' Brian Tallerico has {{defended the}} season against the criticism. He {{wrote in a}} 2007 review that {{comparing}} [...] "tenth season Simpsons episodes to the prime of the series (3-7) is just unfair and really kind of self-defeating. 'Yeah, <b>I</b> <b>laughed,</b> but not as hard as {{a couple of years}} ago. So it sucks.' That's nonsense. The fact is that even the tenth season of The Simpsons was funnier than most [...] show's best years." [...] PopMatters' Hassenger commented in his review that although the show had declined in quality, [...] "this {{is not to say that}} these episodes are without their charm; many, in fact, are laugh-out-loud funny and characteristically smart." ...|$|E
500|$|During his monologue, host Rock joked, [...] "Clint Eastwood's a star, OK? Tobey Maguire's {{just a boy}} in tights," [...] He also added, [...] "You want Tom Cruise and all you can get is Jude Law? Wait. You want Russell Crowe and all you can get is Colin Farrell? Wait. Alexander is not Gladiator." [...] In response, Sean Penn rebutted Rock's remarks praising Law {{as one of his}} generation's [...] "finest actors". Over a year later, Law {{expressed}} his anger toward Rock in The New York Times telling columnist Craig Modderno, [...] "At first <b>I</b> <b>laughed</b> because I didn't think he knew who I was. Then I got angry as his remarks became personal. My friends were livid. It's unfortunate I had five or six films come out at the same time." ...|$|E

500|$|Jared Harris {{was told}} after the tenth episode {{read-through}} by series creator Matt Weiner that Lane Pryce's time {{was at an}} end. About Lane's forced retirement, Harris stated: [...] "In the beginning, he doesn't know that's the reason he's being called into the office. Once it comes up, {{he thinks he can}} bluff his way out of it. And then he goes through all of these emotions, from anger to denial to depression to acceptance. It was all written in there. The [...] was very specific about the different turns he would take." [...] Harris continued about his character's subsequent suicide: [...] "When Matt told me [...] idea, <b>I</b> <b>laughed</b> my ass off. When he said the car doesn't start, I just laughed for about five minutes. Nothing goes right for ...The sadness that I feel is that it's been such an amazing experience." [...] Pete's (Vincent Kartheiser), Don's (Jon Hamm), and Roger's (John Slattery) [...] "shocked and chaotic" [...] reactions to Lane's corpse were the actors' genuine reactions, according to Harris.|$|E
500|$|Shortly before 16:00, Hipper's force {{encountered}} the six ships of Vice Admiral Beatty's 1st and 2nd battlecruiser squadrons. The German ships {{were the first}} to open fire, at a range of approximately 15,000 yards (14,000m). When the British ships began returning fire, confusion amongst the British battlecruisers resulted in Moltke being engaged by both New Zealand and Tiger. The British rangefinders had misread the range to their German targets, and so the first salvos fired by the British ships fell a mile past the German battlecruisers. Due to errors in British communication, Derfflinger was unengaged during the first 10 minutes of the battle. Derfflingers gunnery officer, Korvettenkapitän Georg von Hase later remarked [...] "By some mistake we were being left out. <b>I</b> <b>laughed</b> grimly and now I began to engage our enemy with complete calm, as at gun practice, and with continually increasing accuracy." [...] At 17:03, the British battlecruiser [...] exploded after 15 minutes of gunfire from Von der Tann. Shortly thereafter the second half of Beatty's force, the four s of the 5th Battle Squadron, came into range and began firing at Von der Tann and Moltke.|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reception}} {{was mostly}} mixed, with results ranging from negative to positive. Tom Kessenich, {{in his book}} Examination: An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6–9 of the X-Files wrote positively of the episode, saying, [...] "'The Rain King' was cute. Very cute. [...] And yet I never found myself suffering from cuteness overload. In fact, <b>I</b> <b>laughed</b> and smiled the entire way through." [...] Starpulse named [...] "The Rain King" [...] as the ninth best X-Files episode and praised the lighter approach to the paranormal, saying that the episode was an [...] "ingenious way to use the paranormal motif of the show for something other than thrills". Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a [...] "B+" [...] grade. Despite criticizing the show for [...] "filming {{in the land of}} sunshine and lemon drops" [...] and [...] "border on that overly twee independent movie vibe", Handlen noted that [...] "the episode’s essential sweetness has enough snarky asides from our heroes [...] that it never goes completely off the rails." [...] He did, however, note that the episode's placement, after a string of several humorous episodes, hurt its reception; he argued that, had it appeared in an earlier, darker season, the entry would now be viewed as [...] "a cock-eyed classic".|$|E
500|$|Despite her obligations, Hańska was a {{beautiful}} unmarried woman of means living in Paris. The writer Jules Amédée Barbey d'Aurevilly described her this way: [...] "Her beauty was imposing and noble, somewhat massive, a little fleshy, but even in stoutness she retained a very lively charm which was spiced with a delightful foreign accent and a striking hint of sensuality." [...] As she began sorting through Balzac's papers, she called on his friend, Champfleury, for assistance. As they worked one evening, he complained of a headache. [...] "I'll make it go away," [...] she said, and began massaging his forehead. As he wrote later: [...] "There are certain magnetic effluvia, in such situations, of which the effect is that the matter does not stop there." [...] Her affair with the man twenty years her junior was brief, but it provided a tremendous release to Hańska, who had spent decades with older men {{in various states of}} ill health. She began partaking of the social life around her. [...] "The night before last <b>I</b> <b>laughed</b> as I have never done before," [...] she wrote in 1851. [...] "Oh, how wonderful it is not to know anyone or have to worry about anyone, to have one's independence, liberty on the mountain-tops, and to be in Paris!" ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} generally mixed reviews. IGN contributor Robert Canning {{felt that}} the episode [...] "didn't have the same comedic appeal" [...] as [...] "Klaus and Greta", but did say there were [...] "some funny moments to be sure", but overall the episode lacked. He commented that the main plot had its faults, but that the weak link in the story was Cheyenne Jackson's Danny. He wrote that the Sue character had been great in the past, but that her [...] "expanded role" [...] in this episode was less successful. In conclusion, Canning gave the episode a 7.5 out of 10 rating. The A.V. Clubs Todd VanDerWerff wrote that [...] "Black Light Attack!" [...] was [...] "dead in spots. I mean, <b>I</b> <b>laughed</b> out loud a number of times, {{but not nearly as}} much". He noted he liked Liz and Jack battling over Danny, but [...] "something about it never landed in the way it should have", and opined that the show {{did not know what to}} do with Jackson. Overall, he gave the episode a B rating. Sean Gandert for Paste {{felt that the}} Liz, Jack, and Danny plot was less interesting [...] "and in general pretty meh." [...] He noted that [...] "Black Light Attack!" [...] was [...] "a big let-down" [...] after the airing of [...] "Klaus and Greta". Leonard Pierce for The A.V. Club called the episode uneven.|$|E

At the 52nd Primetime Emmy Awards, Sheridan was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Original Music and Lyrics for writing the song [...] "We Only Live to Kiss Your Ass." [...] He wrote that [...] "It was a strange experience at the Emmys ... my song was called, 'We Only Live to Kiss Your Ass.' <b>I</b> <b>laughed</b> out loud when the presenter had to list that song as one of the nominations alongside normal songs written by people like Marvin Hamlisch." [...] Along with the other producers of the series, he was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program in 2005 for [...] "North by North Quahog" [...] at the 57th Primetime Emmy Awards, and again in 2006 for [...] "PTV" [...] at the 58th. Also in 2006, Sheridan won a DVD Exclusive Award for writing the [...] "Stewie B. Goode" [...] segment of the Family Guy direct to video film [...] He shared the award with writer Gary Janetti. 2008 saw Sheridan receive another Outstanding Animated Program nomination, for [...] "Blue Harvest", at the 60th Primetime Emmy Awards. 2008 also saw him receive a nomination for a British Academy Television Award for Best International and in 2009 he was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series at the 61st Primetime Emmy Awards; both awards were for Family Guy in general.|$|E
500|$|Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode an 'A', saying [...] "Community is going {{away for a}} while, but it's going away with an episode that reminds me why I love the show so much. This is a very {{personal}} thing—since humor's subjective like that—but for me, this was the funniest episode since the clip show... <b>I</b> <b>laughed</b> myself silly at this one, {{to the point where}} I was devolving into hiccups at certain scenes, and I'm glad we get to go out on an episode like this, one that plays around with form and makes me laugh." [...] Alan Sepinwall of HitFix also praised the Glee-spoofing, saying [...] "'Regional Holiday Music' was the logical, clever, funny endpoint to it." [...] Sean Gandert of Paste said, [...] "As with its best theme-episodes, the show bridged the gap between high-concept parody and character-based comedy." [...] TV Fanatic's Leigh Raines gave the episode a 4/5 rating, saying while the show [...] "definitely went out with a bang, it didn't totally blow my socks off... While there were a few moments that upped the ick factor, overall this episode fell on the positive side." [...] She praised Troy and Abed's rap performance, but called the scene where Annie seduces Jeff [...] "creepy". Robert Canning of IGN said it was a [...] "great" [...] episode, but [...] "faltered just a bit" [...] at the end: [...] "Abed's realization that his attempts to brighten the holiday only made things darker, as Jeff had previously suggested, fit the character well enough, but the study group's follow-up felt a bit forced and holiday hokey. Of course, that could well have been the point." ...|$|E
2500|$|The critics had a {{field day}} with his gimmicky act, his showy but careful piano playing, his {{non-stop}} promotions, and his gaudy display of success, but he remained largely unaffected, as preserved by the famous quotation, first recorded in a letter to a critic, [...] "Thank you for your very amusing review. After reading it, in fact, my brother George and <b>I</b> <b>laughed</b> {{all the way to the}} bank." [...] He used a similar response to subsequent poor reviews, famously modifying it to [...] "I cried all the way to the bank." [...] In an appearance on The Tonight Show some years later, Liberace reran the anecdote to Johnny Carson, and finished it by saying, [...] "I don't cry all the way to the bank any more – I [...] the bank!" ...|$|E

2500|$|Reeve {{went through}} inner anguish in the ICU, {{particularly}} {{when he was}} alone during the night. His approaching operation to reattach his skull to his spine (June 1995) [...] "was frightening to contemplate. ... I already knew that I had only a fifty-fifty chance of surviving the surgery. ... Then, at an especially bleak moment, the door flew open and in hurried a squat fellow with a blue scrub hat and a yellow surgical gown and glasses, speaking in a Russian accent." [...] The man {{announced that he was}} a proctologist and was going to perform a rectal exam on Reeve. It was Robin Williams, reprising his character from the film Nine Months. Reeve wrote: [...] "For {{the first time since the}} accident, <b>I</b> <b>laughed.</b> My old friend had helped me know that somehow I was going to be okay." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sharon Knolle of TV Squad stated [...] "From the {{inspired}} 'Tik Tok' musical opening sequence to {{the last}} gag, 'To Surveil With Love' {{ranks as one of}} the best 'Simpsons' episodes in years. I never expected the rest of the episode to live up to that killer opening, but, unbelievably, it just got better as it went along." [...] Todd VanDer Werff of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A- and said [...] "I thought this was a strong episode of The Simpsons. <b>I</b> <b>laughed</b> frequently throughout, I thought both of the major storylines mostly made sense and concluded well, and I enjoyed some of the ways the episode turned satire on its ear. I particularly liked the idea of Lisa conforming by becoming a brunette after everyone made fun of her for being a blonde. Dumb blonde jokes are as old as time itself, but the way the episode turned the whole thing into a sly parody of diversity and conformity was winning." ...|$|E
2500|$|The book is {{dedicated}} [...] "To the Wife of My Youth". This dedication {{appears in the}} first printing run of about 5,000 copies, all either in the 1st edition, 1st state binding or in two alternate bindings. In an 1887 printing of Ben-Hur at the Rare Books Department of the Cincinnati Public Library, Lew Wallace wrote to Alexander Hill: [...] "My Dear Friend HillWhen Ben-Hur was finished, I told my wife {{it was to be}} dedicated to her, and that she must furnish the inscription. She wrote 'To the Wife of My Youth' / The book became popular; then I began to receive letters of sympathy and enquiries as to when and of what poor Mrs. Wallace died. <b>I</b> <b>laughed</b> at first, but the condolences multiplied until finally I told the good woman that having got me into the trouble she must now get me out, which she did by adding the words--'Who still abides with me.' / The device was perfect." [...] Wallace apparently also received many marriage proposals due to the misunderstanding.|$|E
