5|$|The most {{distinctive}} characteristic of Pteranodon is its cranial crest. These crests consisted of skull bones (frontals) projecting upward and backward from the skull. The {{size and shape}} of these crests varied due to a number of factors, including age, sex, and species. Male Pteranodon sternbergi, the older species of the two described to date (and sometimes placed in the distinct genus Geosternbergia), had a more vertical crest with a broad <b>forward</b> <b>projection,</b> while their descendants, Pteranodon longiceps, evolved a narrower, more backward-projecting crest. Females of both species were smaller and bore small, rounded crests. The crests were probably mainly display structures, though they may have had other functions as well.|$|E

40|$|The {{increased}} computational {{demands of}} modern statistical stock assessment models {{has made the}} standard methods to provide uncertainty estimates for <b>forward</b> <b>projections</b> impractical in many applications. However, <b>forward</b> <b>projections</b> and their associated estimates of uncertainty are an important and popular piece of management advice. We describe a less computationally intense method to estimate uncertainty in <b>forward</b> <b>projections</b> that includes both parameter uncertainty and future demographic stochastic uncertainty. This method is based on extending the estimation model to include the future projection period and using normal approximation based on the Hessian matrix to estimate confidence intervals. The method is tested using simulation analysis and compared to Bayesian integration and to projections based on the point estimates of the parameters. We identify bias caused by the lognormal penalty on annual recruitment deviations, the lognormal bias correction factor for recruitment and effort deviations, and the stock recruitment relationship. We suggest modifications to eliminate the first two biases. The method is applied to yellowfin tuna in the eastern Pacific Ocean...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a technique to}} recover dynamic 3 D vascular morphology from a single 3 D rotational X-ray angiography acquisition. The dynamic morphology corresponding to a canonical cardiac cycle is represented via a 4 D B-spline based spatiotemporal deformation. Such deformation is estimated by simultaneously matching the <b>forward</b> <b>projections</b> of a sequence of the temporally deformed 3 D reference volume to the entire 2 D measured projection sequence. A joint use of two acceleration strategies is also proposed: semi-precomputation of <b>forward</b> <b>projections</b> and registration metric computation based on a narrow-band region-of-interest. Digital and physical phantoms of pulsating cerebral aneurysms {{have been used for}} evaluation. Accurate estimation has been obtained in recovering sub-voxel pulsation, even from images with substantial intensity inhomogeneity. Results also demonstrate that the acceleration strategies can reduce memory consumption and computational time without degrading the performance. status: publishe...|$|R

30|$|The faster {{simulation}} times {{achieved with}} variance reduction techniques also {{support the use}} of the MC method in the reconstruction of tomographic images from planar images, i.e., single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Novel studies have shown the potential to increase the image quality of SPECT by using MC-based reconstruction [7 – 9]. However, the simulation times in MC-based SPECT reconstruction are lengthy due to the need to simulate all <b>forward</b> <b>projections</b> and because the codes are generally written for the central processing unit (CPU), which limits effective parallelization. For a SPECT reconstruction of a 1283 patient matrix and 120 projections, a rough estimate is that about 1283 * 120 *(100 photons/voxel) have to be simulated per iteration to obtain <b>forward</b> <b>projections</b> with an acceptable image noise, i.e., 25 * 109 photon emissions per iteration. Despite the use of multiple kernels for parallelization of the code, the simulation times for SPECT reconstruction with CPU-based codes are still long. Nevertheless, using graphics processing units (GPUs) for optimized parallelization might substantially reduce SPECT reconstruction times. Recently, Garcia et al. [10] demonstrated that GPU programming for parallelization of the photon transport in the general GEANT 4 code could reduce simulation times by a factor of 70. With this approach, the simulation times in MC-based SPECT reconstruction with GEANT 4 were reduced to hours in phantom studies.|$|R
