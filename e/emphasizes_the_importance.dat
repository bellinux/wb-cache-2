5|$|The {{doctrine}} <b>emphasizes</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> {{of personal}} empowerment, proposing {{that it is}} God's will for his people to be happy. The atonement (reconciliation with God) is interpreted to include the alleviation of sickness and poverty, which are viewed as curses to be broken by faith. This {{is believed to be}} achieved through donations of money, visualization, and positive confession.|$|E
5|$|A notable recent {{development}} in Philosophy of Psychology is Functional Contextualism or Contextual Behavioural Science (CBS). Functional Contextualism {{is a modern}} philosophy of science rooted in philosophical pragmatism and contextualism. It is most actively developed in behavioral science in general, the field of behavior analysis, and contextual behavioral science in particular (see the entry for the Association for Contextual Behavioral Science). Functional contextualism serves {{as the basis of}} a theory of language known as relational frame theory and its most prominent application, acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT). It is an extension and contextualistic interpretation of B.F. Skinner's radical behaviorism first delineated by Steven C. Hayes which <b>emphasizes</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> of predicting and influencing psychological events (including thoughts, feelings, and behaviors) with precision, scope, and depth, by focusing on manipulable variables in their context.|$|E

5|$|As in the Vindication of the Rights of Woman, Wollstonecraft {{does not}} {{highlight}} {{the differences between}} men and women as much as she <b>emphasizes</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> of virtue in Original Stories. Moreover, she defines virtue in such a way that it applies to both sexes. Traditionally, as Kelly explains, virtue was tied to femininity and chastity, but Wollstonecraft’s text rejects this definition and argues instead that virtue should be characterized by reason and self-control. Myers has also pointed out that Mrs. Mason’s desire to instill rationality in her charges is potentially liberating for women readers and their daughters as such a pedagogy was in direct contrast to much that was being written at the time by conduct book writers such as James Fordyce and John Gregory and philosophers such as Rousseau, who asserted the intellectual weakness of women and the secondary status of their gender.|$|E
5|$|One of six {{predetermined}} origin stories {{begins the}} game, {{depending on the}} player character's race and class. Each story ends with the player being introduced to and leaving with Duncan, the commander of Ferelden's Grey Wardens {{who is trying to}} find new recruits, selecting the player as a potential candidate. The two journey to a fortress in southern Ferelden called Ostagar. There, they join Cailan, the King of Ferelden, and his father-in-law Loghain, a legendary general. The three leaders plan to make a stand against the encroaching Darkspawn before a new Blight overwhelms Ferelden. Duncan senses the influence of an Archdemon, a god-like being hosted in the body of a powerful Dragon that commands the Darkspawn, which makes this the first true Blight in over 400 years. Duncan <b>emphasizes</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> of defeating the Blight before it can gain enough momentum to threaten the rest of Thedas.|$|E

Yet like Nancy, she is curious about them and tries to make a connection. Though Sarah defers to Leslie much more than Nancy does to Charlie, she does play a buffer role between the couples. Leslie often consults Sarah on {{what he should do}} and what she thinks about the humans and the situation at hand. At first, Sarah urges wanness, but she also <b>emphasizes</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> of contact.|$|E
25|$|The Chabad school, {{limited to}} its namesake dynasty, but prominent, {{was founded by}} Shneur Zalman of Liadi and was {{elaborated}} by his successors, until the late 20th century. The movement retained many of the attributes of early Hasidism, before a clear divide between Righteous and ordinary followers was cemented. Chabad Rebbes insisted their adherents acquire proficiency in the sect's lore, and not relegate most responsibility to the leaders. The sect <b>emphasizes</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> of intellectually grasping {{the dynamics of the}} hidden divine aspect and how they affect the human psyche; the very acronym Chabad is for the three penultimate Sephirot, associated with the cerebral side of consciousness.|$|E
