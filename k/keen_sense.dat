5|$|The storm petrel's large nasal {{olfactory}} bulbs {{facilitate a}} <b>keen</b> <b>sense</b> of smell, {{and the birds}} themselves have a distinctive musty aroma which can help researchers to locate breeding colonies. Individual petrels recognise their own body scent and {{can use it to}} locate their nest in the dark.|$|E
5|$|The {{large size}} of the {{olfactory}} bulbs, {{as well as the}} terminal and olfactory nerves, suggest that Tarbosaurus had a <b>keen</b> <b>sense</b> of smell, as was also the case with Tyrannosaurus. The vomeronasal bulb is large and differentiated from the olfactory bulb, which was initially suggested as being indicative of a well-developed Jacobsen's organ, which was used to detect pheromones. This may imply that Tarbosaurus had complex mating behavior. However, the identification of the vomeronasal bulb has been challenged by other researchers, since they are not present in any living archosaurs.|$|E
5|$|The {{black vulture}} is a {{scavenger}} and feeds on carrion, {{but will also}} eat eggs or kill newborn animals. In areas populated by humans, it also feeds at garbage dumps. It finds its meals either by using its keen eyesight or by following other (New World) vultures, which possess a <b>keen</b> <b>sense</b> of smell. Lacking a syrinx—the vocal organ of birds—its only vocalizations are grunts or low hisses. It lays its eggs in caves or hollow trees or on the bare ground, and generally raises two chicks each year, which it feeds by regurgitation. In the United States, the vulture receives legal protection under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918. This vulture also appeared in Mayan codices.|$|E

5|$|In 1989, Emily B. Griffin {{found that}} Stegoceras and other pachycephalosaurs {{had a good}} sense of smell (olfaction), based on the study of cranial endocasts that showed large {{olfactory}} bulbs in the brain. In 2014, Jason M. Bourke and colleagues found that Stegoceras would have needed cartilaginous nasal turbinates {{in the front of the}} nasal passages for airflow to reach the olfactory region. Evidence for the presence of this structure is a bony ridge to which it could have attached. The size of the olfactory region also indicates that Stegoceras had a <b>keen</b> <b>sense</b> of smell. The researchers found that the dinosaur could have had either a scroll-shaped turbinate (like in a turkey) or a branched one (as in an ostrich) as both could have directed air to the olfactory region. The blood vessel system in the passages also suggest that the turbinates served to cool down warm arterial blood from the body that was heading to the brain. The skull of S. validum specimen UALVP 2 was suited for a study of this kind due to its exceptional preservation; it has ossified soft tissue in the nasal cavity, which would otherwise be cartilaginous and therefore not preserved through mineralization.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, {{scientists}} analysing {{a detailed}} CT {{scan of the}} braincase of the London Archaeopteryx concluded that its brain was significantly larger than that of most dinosaurs, indicating that it possessed the brain size necessary for flying. The overall brain anatomy was reconstructed using the scan. The reconstruction showed that the regions associated with vision took up nearly one-third of the brain. Other well-developed areas involved hearing and muscle coordination. The skull scan also revealed the structure of its inner ear. The structure more closely resembles that of modern birds than the inner ear of non-avian reptiles. These characteristics taken together suggest that Archaeopteryx had the <b>keen</b> <b>sense</b> of hearing, balance, spatial perception, and coordination needed to fly. Archaeopteryx had a cerebrum-to-brain-volume ratio 78% {{of the way to}} modern birds from the condition of non-coelurosaurian dinosaurs such as Carcharodontosaurus or Allosaurus, which had a crocodile-like anatomy of the brain and inner ear. Newer research shows that while the Archaeopteryx brain was more complex than that of more primitive theropods, it had a more generalized brain volume among maniraptoran dinosaurs, even smaller than that of other non-avian dinosaurs in several instances, which indicates the neurological development required for flight was already a common trait in the maniraptoran clade.|$|E
25|$|Sir James {{was tall}} and imposing, with a relaxed {{approach}} to life. He was an experienced raconteur and, with his <b>keen</b> <b>sense</b> of humour, devised and illustrated various books containing caricatures. He was also an expert at black pen-and-ink drawings.|$|E

25|$|Weigman had {{developed}} a <b>keen</b> <b>sense</b> of hearing and memory. He was able to impersonate any voice, memorize phone numbers by listening to the phone tones, and he gained the skills to understand the inner working of a phone network system by listening to the different frequencies.|$|E
25|$|Hal's {{interest}} in agriculture began early. He started raising truck {{in a small}} garden in Arden, and sold it around the countryside. His <b>keen</b> <b>sense</b> of beauty showed {{in the way he}} fixed up his boxes of vegetables to sell, arranging them artistically in green boxes.|$|E
25|$|The intellectuals {{linked with}} the Romanian Greek-Catholic Church had a {{different}} approach to the problem of the Romanian nation in Transylvania. They possessed a <b>keen</b> <b>sense</b> of history and they thought increasingly in terms of 'nation', creating in this way a new path of development for the Romanians in Transylvania.|$|E
50|$|Wild sheep {{have very}} <b>keen</b> <b>senses</b> {{of sight and}} hearing. When {{detecting}} predators, wild sheep most often flee, usually uphill to higher ground. However, they can also fight back. The Dall sheep {{has been known to}} butt wolves off the face of cliffs.|$|R

25|$|His {{efforts to}} promote music and musicians {{includes}} Haft Rang (Seven Colors) which consists of an ensemble of 80 folk musicians. The troupe consists of lesser known musicians that were earlier lost in ignominy. It includes both educated musicians who can read notes as well as illiterate musicians who have a <b>keen</b> <b>sense</b> of music.|$|E
25|$|Most {{non-human}} mammals {{have a much}} keener {{sense of}} smell than humans, although the mechanism is similar. An example of smell in non-mammals is that of sharks, which combine their <b>keen</b> <b>sense</b> of smell with timing to determine {{the direction of a}} smell. They follow the nostril that first detected the smell. Insects have olfactory receptors on their antennae.|$|E
25|$|After 1975 when Fanis {{had become}} OL' 55, under Baker's guidance, they {{developed}} a style that bordered on parody, but managed to combine novelty retro kitsch and clever theatrics with a <b>keen</b> <b>sense</b> of pop dynamics and an acute understanding of rock 'n' roll. The band dressed in authentic 1950s rocker gear and mixed vintage material with originals—mostly written by bass guitarist, Manzie.|$|E
50|$|Hewkii {{is known}} for his {{athletic}} ability on both Metru Nui and Mata Nui, winning many Copper Masks as a Matoran. These talents helped develop his combat skills and reflexes. He also possessed <b>keen</b> <b>senses,</b> allowing him to pinpoint weak spots. He wore a Kakama as his Kanohi Mask.|$|R
50|$|Most carnosaurs, {{including}} Carcharodontosaurus and Allosaurus, did {{not have}} very good binocular vision, comparable to modern alligators. They possessed binocular vision which was restricted to a region only 20° wide, which is understandable, seeing as they hunted mostly large and slow prey. Their <b>keenest</b> <b>sense</b> was probably smell.|$|R
50|$|Thanks to his artificially induced mutation, Lupo has {{augmented}} strength, speed, agility, endurance, and reflexes. He has hyper <b>keen</b> <b>senses,</b> razor edged talons, {{and has the}} psionic {{ability to}} command animal life, especially dogs and wolves, through high-pitched yelps. Lupo also later gained {{the appearance of a}} werewolf-like creature.|$|R
25|$|Little spotted kiwis eat grubs {{and other}} small insects that are found underground, and {{occasionally}} eat berries. Hence the sharp talons and long beak, it digs into the ground with its talons then shoves its long beak down the soft ground. Since they can't fly to get to insects or food on trees and their eyesight is very poor they depend on a <b>keen</b> <b>sense</b> of smell, long beak and talons.|$|E
25|$|Duck Tollers {{are working}} animals and are happiest {{when they have}} a job to do. Tollers are {{excellent}} hunting companions. They excel at many types of sporting competitions, such as agility, dock diving and obedience. Their <b>keen</b> <b>sense</b> of smell, intelligence, drive to work, and small size, make them perfect search and rescue dogs. The breed standard states that the dog should have a strong retrieving drive, intense birdiness, endurance and a love for water.|$|E
25|$|The band enjoyed {{popularity}} with {{a style that}} bordered on parody but managed to combine novelty retro kitsch and clever theatrics with a <b>keen</b> <b>sense</b> of pop dynamics and an acute understanding of rock 'n' roll. The band scored five top 20 hits on the Australian Kent Music Report singles chart and their debut album, Take It Greasy peaked at No.3 on the Australian albums chart in 1976. After line-up changes, Ol' 55 disbanded in 1983.|$|E

25|$|Some {{dogs are}} trained to silently locate booby traps and {{concealed}} enemies such as snipers. The dog's <b>keen</b> <b>senses</b> of smell and hearing would make them far more effective at detecting these dangers than humans. The best scout dogs are described as having a disposition intermediate to docile tracking dogs and aggressive attack dogs.|$|R
50|$|Lupa is a Swamp Men tribeswoman mutate with {{enhanced}} strength, speed, reflexes & reactions, agility, {{and durability}} {{as well as}} hyper <b>keen</b> <b>senses</b> (including night vision).

25|$|Poodles {{are known}} as a highly intelligent, energetic, and sociable breed. They require both {{physical}} and intellectual activities. Of note is this breed's <b>keen</b> <b>sense</b> for instinctive behavior. In particular, marking and hunting drives are more readily observable in poodles than in most other breeds. A typical poodle should be reserved with strangers upon first introduction, {{but after a while}} should slowly reveal a warm and personable disposition. Snappy, vicious behavior is considered a serious fault in the breed.|$|E

Always feeling a <b>keen</b> <b>sense</b> of responsibility to her family and friends, she places their welfare and interests above her own, and suppresses her own strong emotions in a way that leads others to think she is indifferent or cold-hearted.|$|E
25|$|In {{later years}} and at many venues, {{particularly}} on {{the east and west}} coasts of the U.S., Fugazi was unable to get ticket prices below about $10–$15 total. However, it never saw the $5 rule as inviolable, instead aiming to charge a price that was both affordable and profitable. Unlike some similar, independent rock contemporaries, Fugazi's performances and tours were always profitable, due to the group's popularity, low business overhead costs, and MacKaye's <b>keen</b> <b>sense</b> of audience response in given regions.|$|E
