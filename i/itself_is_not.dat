The plots of such works are more complicated than their Aesopic counterpart, tend more towards ribaldry, and feature the fox making {{a victim of the}} wolf.|$|E

The series takes place in an alternate version of Napoleonic Wars, in which the various nations fight with air forces made up of manned dragons. The HMS Temeraire appears briefly in the ninth and final book.|$|E

5|$|This step is {{necessary}} because the rational nexus test is not foolproof. The test {{is based on}} the presumption that the legislative object <b>itself</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> in violation of the Constitution. However, if the object of the statute is itself illegitimate, a classification may be invalid even if it satisfies the test. Hence, the test is only applicable if the object of the impugned legislation is a proper one.|$|E

5|$|A key {{assessment}} {{that is made}} after diagnosis is whether surgical removal of the tumor is possible (see Staging), as {{this is the only}} cure for this cancer. Whether or not surgical resection can be offered depends on how much the cancer has spread. The exact location of the tumor is also a significant factor, and CT can show how it relates to the major blood vessels passing close to the pancreas. The general health of the person must also be assessed, though age in <b>itself</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> an obstacle to surgery.|$|E
5|$|Adult {{amphibians}} {{and most}} reptiles {{have a double}} circulatory system, meaning a circulatory system divided into arterial and venous parts. However, the heart <b>itself</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> completely separated into two sides. Instead, it is separated into three chambers – two atria and one ventricle. Blood returning from both the systemic circulation and the lungs is returned, and blood is pumped simultaneously into the systemic circulation and the lungs. The double system allows blood to circulate to and from lungs which deliver oxygenated blood directly to the heart.|$|E
5|$|Adult coconut crabs have {{no known}} predators {{apart from other}} coconut crabs and humans. Its large size {{and the quality of}} its meat means that the coconut crab is {{extensively}} hunted and is very rare on islands with a human population. The coconut crab is eaten by Southeast Asians and Pacific Islanders and is considered a delicacy and an aphrodisiac, and intensive hunting has threatened the species' survival in some areas. While the coconut crab <b>itself</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> innately poisonous, it may become so depending on its diet, and cases of coconut crab poisoning have occurred. For instance, consumption of the sea mango Cerbera manghas by the coconut crab may make the coconut crab toxic due to the presence of cardiac cardenolides.|$|E

5|$|Baseball {{has had a}} broad {{impact on}} popular culture, both in the United States and elsewhere. Dozens of English-language idioms have been derived from baseball; in particular, the game {{is the source of}} a number of widely used sexual euphemisms. The first {{networked}} radio broadcasts in North America were of the 1922 World Series: famed sportswriter Grantland Rice announced play-by-play from New York City's Polo Grounds on WJZ–Newark, New Jersey, which was connected by wire to WGY–Schenectady, New York, and WBZ–Springfield, Massachusetts. The baseball cap has become a ubiquitous fashion item not only in the United States and Japan, but also in countries where the sport <b>itself</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> particularly popular, such as the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Chlorine {{is usually}} used (in {{the form of}} hypochlorous acid) to kill {{bacteria}} and other microbes in drinking water supplies and public swimming pools. In most private swimming pools, chlorine <b>itself</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> used, but rather sodium hypochlorite, formed from chlorine and sodium hydroxide, or solid tablets of chlorinated isocyanurates. The drawback of using chlorine in swimming pools is that the chlorine reacts with the proteins in human hair and skin (see Hypochlorous acid), and becomes chemically bonded. Even small water supplies are now routinely chlorinated.|$|E

With a similar mass to c, it has a 260-day orbit, towards the inner edge of 55 Cancri A's habitable zone.

5|$|In {{intelligent}} mammals, such as primates, the cerebrum {{is larger}} {{relative to the}} rest of the brain. Intelligence <b>itself</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> easy to define, but indications of intelligence include the ability to learn, matched with behavioral flexibility. Rats, for example, are considered to be highly intelligent, as they can learn and perform new tasks, an ability that may be important when they first colonize a fresh habitat. In some mammals, food gathering appears to be related to intelligence: a deer feeding on plants has a brain smaller than a cat, which must think to outwit its prey.|$|E
5|$|Occasionally, an individual's tissues are {{resistant}} {{to the effects of}} parathyroid hormone. This is known as pseudohypoparathyroidism. In this case the parathyroid glands are fully functional, and the hormone <b>itself</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> able to function, resulting in a decrease in blood calcium levels. Pseudohypoparathyroidism is often associated with the genetic condition Albright's hereditary osteodystrophy. Pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism, one of the longest words in the English language, is used to describe an individual with Albright's hereditary osteodystrophy; with normal parathyroid hormone and serum calcium levels.|$|E
5|$|Ponies often exhibit thicker manes, tails, {{and overall}} coat. They also have {{proportionally}} shorter legs, wider barrels, heavier bone, shorter and thicker necks, and short heads with broad foreheads. They may have calmer temperaments than horses {{and also a}} high level of intelligence {{that may or may not}} be used to cooperate with human handlers. Small size, by <b>itself,</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> an exclusive determinant. For example, the Shetland pony which averages , is considered a pony. Conversely, breeds such as the Falabella and other miniature horses, which can be no taller than , are classified by their registries as very small horses, not ponies.|$|E

5|$|The {{historian}} R. R. Darlington {{argued that}} the Vita was written right after Æthelwig's death, but another historian, David Knowles, wrote that it probably was written about 1110, possibly by the prior of Evesham, Dominic. Antonia Gransden, another historian, agrees with Darlington, and finds it {{more likely to have}} been written shortly after Æthelwig's death. The work <b>itself</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a hagiography, in that it doesn't attribute any miracles to Æthelwig, and instead is a mix of charters and narratives. Nor does it give any details on Æthelwig's early life or his selection as abbot. A large portion of the work is a detailed list of lands acquired by Æthelwig for the abbey, and concludes with a short description of the abbott's death.|$|E
5|$|The {{orientation}} of Earth's axis and equator are not fixed in space, but rotate about the poles of the ecliptic with {{a period of}} about 26,000 years, a process known as lunisolar precession, as it is due mostly to the gravitational effect of the Moon and Sun on Earth's equatorial bulge. Likewise, the ecliptic <b>itself</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> fixed. The gravitational perturbations of the other bodies of the Solar System cause a much smaller motion of the plane of Earth's orbit, and hence of the ecliptic, known as planetary precession. The combined action of these two motions is called general precession, and changes the position of the equinoxes by about 50 arc seconds (about 0.014°) per year.|$|E
