25|$|Some {{part of the}} <b>feed</b> <b>water</b> {{from the}} {{low-pressure}} zone is transferred to the high-pressure economizer by a booster pump. This economizer heats up the water to its saturation temperature. This saturated water goes through the high-temperature zone of the boiler and is supplied to the high-pressure turbine.|$|E
25|$|<b>Feed</b> <b>water</b> {{comes in}} through the {{economizer}} and then exits after having attained saturation temp in the water or steam circuit. Finally it then flows through evaporator and super heater. If {{the temperature of the}} gases entering the heat recovery boiler is higher, then the temperature of the exiting gases is also high.|$|E

25|$|The cycle a-b-c-d-e-f-a {{which is}} the Rankine steam cycle takes place at a low {{temperature}} and {{is known as the}} bottoming cycle. Transfer of heat energy from high temperature exhaust gas to water and steam takes place by a waste heat recovery boiler in the bottoming cycle. During the constant pressure process 4-1 the exhaust gases in the gas turbine reject heat. The <b>feed</b> <b>water,</b> wet and super heated steam absorb some of this heat in the process a-b, b-c and c-d.|$|E
25|$|After some {{positive}} effect was noticed using both the core spray system and <b>feed</b> <b>water</b> piping, TEPCO decided on 16 September {{to increase the}} amount of water pumped into the No. 2 reactor by one ton, in an attempt to further lower the temperature in the core, to a total of 7 tons per hour. The same was done for reactor No. 3, where 5 tons were added, bring the total to 12 tons per hour. TEPCO also added that the volume of cooling water into the No. 1 reactor would be increased as necessary.|$|E
25|$|The Bruce Heavy Water Plant in Ontario was the world's largest {{heavy water}} {{production}} plant with {{a capacity of}} 700 tonnes per year. It used the Girdler sulfide process to produce heavy water, and required 340,000 tonnes of <b>feed</b> <b>water</b> to produce one tonne of heavy water. It {{was part of a}} complex that included eight CANDU reactors, which provided heat and power for the heavy water plant.

25|$|On 12 March, a new {{electrical}} {{distribution panel}} {{was installed in}} an office adjacent to Unit 1 to supply power via Unit 2 when it was reconnected to the transmission grid two days later. On 21 March, injection of seawater continued, as did repairs to the control instrumentation. On 23 March, it became possible to inject water into the reactor using the <b>feed</b> <b>water</b> system rather than the fire trucks, raising the flow rate from 2 to 18m3/h (later reduced to 11m3/h, and even further to reduce the build up of contaminated water); on 24 March, electricity was restored to the central operating room.|$|E
25|$|On 14 September at 11AM (JST) TEPCO began injecting {{water into}} the No. 2 reactor using the core spray system piping in {{addition}} to the <b>feed</b> <b>water</b> piping already being used as this method seemed to be effective in reducing the temperature in the No. 3 reactor. At that time the temperature {{at the bottom of the}} No. 2 reactor was still 114.4 degrees Celsius (237.92°F), compared to the 84.9°C degrees(184.82°F) in the No.1 reactor and the 101.3°C (214.34°F) in the No. 3 reactor. The new method has led to some temperature decrease, but not as significant as the decrease that occurred in the No.3 reactor.|$|E
25|$|Dairy cattle housing systems {{vary greatly}} {{throughout}} the world depending on the climate, dairy size, and feeding strategies. Housing must provide access to <b>feed,</b> <b>water</b> and protection from relevant environmental conditions. One obvious issue for humanely housing cattle is temperature extremes. Heat stress can decrease fertility and milk production in cattle. Providing shade is a very common method for reducing heat stress. Barns may also incorporate fans or tunnel ventilation into {{the architecture of the}} barn structure. Overly cold conditions, while rarely deadly for cattle, cause increases in maintenance energy requirements and thus increased feed intake and decreased milk production. During the winter months, where temperatures are low enough, dairy cattle are often kept inside barns which are warmed by their collective body heat.|$|E

40|$|We {{studied the}} effect of <b>feed</b> and <b>water</b> {{deprivation}} on gastrointestinal tract and intestinal mucosa development of chicks at 24, 48, and 72 h posthatching. The treatments were <b>water</b> and <b>feed</b> ad libitum, <b>water</b> ad libitum and no <b>feed,</b> no <b>water</b> but <b>feed</b> ad libitum, and no <b>water</b> and no <b>feed.</b> The relative weight of the yolk sac was not influenced by the treatments. However, at 48 and 72 h posthatching, the relative weight of the liver increased, and the gizzard + proventriculus weight decreased in birds receiving feed ad libitum. An increase in jejunum and ileum relative weights and lengths was observed when the birds were supplied with <b>feed</b> and <b>water.</b> The lack of water produced the same effect as the lack of feed, both causing a higher number of villi per area with reduction in villus size, when compared with <b>feed</b> and <b>water</b> ad libitum treatments. The {{results of this study}} revealed that <b>feed</b> and <b>water</b> are able to affect intestinal villus development after hatching, indicating that both <b>feed</b> and <b>water</b> must be supplied to the chicks immediately after hatching...|$|R
25|$|The {{water is}} {{pressurized}} in two stages, and flows {{through a series}} of six or seven intermediate <b>feed</b> <b>water</b> heaters, heated up at each point with steam extracted from an appropriate duct on the turbines and gaining temperature at each stage. Typically, {{in the middle of this}} series of feedwater heaters, and before the second stage of pressurization, the condensate plus the makeup water flows through a deaerator that removes dissolved air from the water, further purifying and reducing its corrosiveness. The water may be dosed following this point with hydrazine, a chemical that removes the remaining oxygen in the water to below 5 parts per billion (ppb). It is also dosed with pH control agents such as ammonia or morpholine to keep the residual acidity low and thus non-corrosive.|$|E
25|$|Ten {{locomotives}} (numbers 92020-92029) {{were built}} in 1955 with the Franco-Crosti boiler. which incorporated a combustion gas <b>feed</b> <b>water</b> preheater that recuperated low-grade residual heat In the 9F version, this {{took the form of}} a single cylindrical water drum running along the underside of the main boiler barrel. The standard chimney on top of the smokebox was only used during lighting up. In normal working the gases went through firetubes inside the preheater drum that led to a second smokebox situated beneath the boiler from which there emerged a chimney on the right-hand side, just forward of the firebox. In the event, the experiment did not deliver the hoped-for benefits, and efficiency was not increased sufficiently to justify the cost and complexity. Moreover, conditions were unpleasant on the footplate in a cross-wind, this in spite of the later provision of a small deflector plate forward of the chimney. These problems led to the subsequent removal of the preheater drum, although the locomotives did retain the original main smokebox with its distinctive look.|$|E
25|$|Work {{began on}} 30 July 1792. The River Leen {{ran along the}} {{southern}} edge of the city between Lenton in the west and Leen Bridge, a series of flood arches to the east. The river bed was enlarged to form the canal, while the river was diverted into a new covered channel further to the north. The flood arches were replaced by a new bridge, and the canal turned sharply to the south, to join the Trent. The proprietors wanted a basin where the canal joined the river, with a lock above that, but Jessop argued that such an arrangement would lead to the entrance becoming blocked with sand. Building the lock close to the river would ensure that the sand was flushed away whenever the lock was emptied. The town section was officially opened on 30 July 1793, giving access to wharves, although there was still much work to be completed. To the east of Leen Bridge, a weir was constructed, to <b>feed</b> <b>water</b> into the Brewery Arm, an enlargement of the river channel. At its far end, another weir overflowed back into the new course of the Leen. A second arm, the Poplar Arm, was made using water channels on Eastcroft Meadow, and joined the Brewery Arm.|$|E

The method optimization included the study of binary mobile phases of water and acetonitrile. The optimum separation was achieved at 40 degrees C, with acetonitrile:H(2) O 29 : 71 v/v used as mobile phase and a 3 ml/min flow-rate, which resulted in their separation in about 5 min. Two reported sample procedures were applied to feed and for animal <b>feeding</b> <b>water</b> samples prior to HPLC. Method validation was carried out according to the EU criteria established for quantitative screening methods. The results indicate that this method is highly specific, reproducible and accurate. The proposed method {{was found to be}} robust and unaffected by small variations in the extraction procedure and in HPLC conditions.

25|$|This {{period is}} characterised by periods of slow to {{moderate}} population growth, with industrial and education industries developing {{and technology and}} services delivered to the town. Several major infrastructure developments arrive such as distributed town gas, electricity, town water supplies, and a sewage treatment system. Town gas had arrived in Bathurst courtesy of a private venture in 1872, with the Council providing a competing network from 1888. On 30 June 1914, the Council purchased the Wark Bros gas system and combined the gas networks. The old gasworks plant on Russell Street (now out of use) was built in 1960. In 1987 natural gas arrived via a new 240km spur pipeline off the Moomba to Sydney pipeline. The {{early part of the}} century saw electricity arrive initially for street lighting; the city converted from gas street lighting to electric lighting on 22 December 1924, when 370 electric lights at a cost of ₤40,000 were switched on. Lighting spread along streets through to 1935, over time to businesses and finally private houses. Sewage treatment was an early infrastructure project funded by the state government and built in 1915. Water supply started with private wells in backyards. Eventually a waterworks was built to the south of the town on the river with the water pumped through piping laid progressively to the businesses and private dwellings. In 1931, work started on the 1,700 ML Winburndale Dam project to gravity <b>feed</b> <b>water</b> through a wood stave pipe laid to the town. The scheme was opened by the Premier of New South Wales on 7 October 1933. Later, a new larger water supply dam was built on the Campbells River. Originally known as the Campbell River Dam scheme and later renamed the Ben Chifley Dam after the late Prime Minister Ben Chifley of Bathurst. It was opened in November 1956. The Ben Chifley Dam received a major storage upgrade designed to meet the cities needs to 2050; the work was completed in 2001 increasing the capacity by 30% to 30,800 ML.|$|E
