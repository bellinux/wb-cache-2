25|$|The term homoeologous, also spelled <b>homeologous,</b> {{is used to}} {{describe}} the relationship of similar chromosomes or parts of chromosomes brought together following inter-species hybridization and allopolyploidization, and whose relationship was completely homologous in an ancestral species. In allopolyploids, the homologous chromosomes within each parental sub-genome should pair faithfully during meiosis, leading to disomic inheritance; however in some allopolyploids, the homoeologous chromosomes of the parental genomes may be nearly as similar to one another as the homologous chromosomes, leading to tetrasomic inheritance (four chromosomes pairing at meiosis), intergenomic recombination, and reduced fertility.|$|E
50|$|Allopolyploids are species whose {{increased}} {{complement of}} genetic material {{is the result}} of hybridization of two closely related species. Thus <b>homeologous</b> chromosomes in allopolyploids are equivalent, but not identical. These differences mean that the precise pattern of silencing and expression can have important phenotypic effects. Reciprocal silencing on the population level refers to the case where two populations are each descended from the same allopolyploid. In one population, one of the two equivalent locci (A) is expressed while the other (B) has been silenced, while in the other population the reciprocal pattern occurs, with B being expressed and A silenced. It {{is important to note that}} this refers to equivalent loci, specific locations within the genome, rather than the entire <b>homeologous</b> chromosome.|$|E
5000|$|When <b>homeologous</b> {{chromosomes}} pair up though bivalents or multivalents, illegitimate genetic crossovers {{may occur}} (4). Since the chromosomes may differ in genetic structure and content, {{segments of the}} chromosome may be shuffled around resulting in massive gene loss. Additionally, illegitimate recombinations may also result in dicentric chromosomes lead to chromosome breakage during anaphase (4). This further contributes to gene loss on duplicated chromosomes.|$|E
50|$|Reciprocal {{silencing}} on {{the tissue}} level {{refers to the}} same pattern of silencing and expression of <b>homeologous</b> loci. However in this case, the differences in silencing and expression occur between two types of tissue within the same individual, rather than in individuals of different populations. This is an example of neofunctionalization, a process where duplicated genes that were once at equivalent loci evolve to carry out two separate functions. Since different tissues require different genes to be expressed, reciprocal silencing can occur between tissues. Importantly, while the pattern of gene expression is the same as in the population case, the genetic means by which this pattern is achieved are very different. While silencing mutations are thought to be the main source of reciprocal silencing at the population level, at the tissue level only epigenetic factors are in play, since expressible copies of both <b>homeologous</b> loci must exist in all cells in an individual if different tissues express different homeologs.|$|E
50|$|Normally, {{homologous}} chromosomes pair up in bivalents during meiosis and separate into different daughter cells. However, when multiple copies of similar chromosomes {{are present in}} the nucleus, <b>homeologous</b> chromosomes can also pair with {{homologous chromosomes}} resulting in the formation of trivalents or multivalents (4). The formation of multivalents results in unequal division of the chromosomes and lead to daughter cells lacking one or few chromosomes.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Soybean, Glycine max (L.) Merr., {{is a well}} {{documented}} paleopolyploid. What remains relatively under characterized {{is the level of}} sequence identity in retained <b>homeologous</b> regions of the genome. Recently, the Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute and United States Department of Agriculture jointly announced the sequencing of the soybean genome. One of the initial concerns is to what extent sequence identity in <b>homeologous</b> regions would have on whole genome shotgun sequence assembly. Results Seventeen BACs representing ~ 2. 03 Mb were sequenced as representative potential <b>homeologous</b> regions from the soybean genome. Genetic mapping of each BAC shows that 11 of the 20 chromosomes are represented. Sequence comparisons between <b>homeologous</b> BACs shows that the soybean genome is a mosaic of retained paleopolyploid regions. Some regions appear to be highly conserved while other regions have diverged significantly. Large-scale "batch" reassembly of all 17 BACs combined showed that even the most <b>homeologous</b> BACs with upwards of 95 % sequence identity resolve into their respective <b>homeologous</b> sequences. Potential assembly errors were generated by tandemly duplicated pentatricopeptide repeat containing genes and long simple sequence repeats. Analysis of a whole-genome shotgun assembly of 80, 000 randomly chosen JGI-DOE sequence traces reveals some new soybean-specific repeat sequences. Conclusion This analysis investigated both the structure of the paleopolyploid soybean genome and the potential effects retained homeology will have on assembling the whole genome shotgun sequence. Based upon these results, <b>homeologous</b> regions similar to those characterized here will not cause major assembly issues. </p...|$|E
40|$|<b>Homeologous</b> {{recombination}} {{refers to}} genetic exchanges between DNA partners containing similar but not identical DNA sequences. Heteroduplex intermediates in such exchanges {{are expected to}} contain multiple DNA mismatches at positions of sequence divergence and hence are potential targets for mismatch correction. Thus recombination of this type {{is of particular interest}} in understanding the role of DNA mismatch correction on recombination fidelity. Previous studies that examined this question in prokaryotic systems suggested that mismatch repair acts as a barrier to recombination between diverged sequences. The central hypothesis of this thesis is that mismatch correction acts as a barrier to <b>homeologous</b> recombination in yeast. The objectives of these studies was to elucidate the role of mismatch correction in <b>homeologous</b> recombination as a means of dissecting its mechanism in eukaryotic organisms. To examine <b>homeologous</b> genetic events in yeast, I developed an in vivo assay system to evaluate recombination between diverged DNA sequences. A <b>homeologous</b> gene pair consisting of Saccharomyces cerevisiae SPT 15 and its Schizosaccharomyces pombe homolog were present as a direct repeat on chromosome V, with the exogenous S. pombe sequences inserted either upstream or downstream of the endogenous S. cerevisiae gene. Each gene carried a different inactivating mutation, rendering this starting strain Spt 15 -. Recombinants that regenerated SPT 15 function were identified by genetic selection and the rates of recombination in different backgrounds were compared. The <b>homeologous</b> mitotic recombination assay was utilized to test the role of S. cerevisiae mismatch repair genes PMS 1, MSH 2 and MSH 3 on recombination fidelity. In strains wild type for mismatch repair, <b>homeologous</b> recombination was reduced 150 - 180 fold relative to homologous controls, indicating that multiply mispaired sequences act in cis as part of an inhibitory mechanism. In the upstream orientation of the <b>homeologous</b> gene pair, msh 2 or msh 3 mutations resulted in 17 -fold and 9. 6 -fold elevations in recombination and the msh 2 msh 3 double mutant exhibited an 43 -fold increase, implying that each MSH gene can function independently in trans to prevent <b>homeologous</b> recombination. Homologous recombination was not significantly affected by the msh mutations. In the other orientation, only msh 2 strains were elevated (12 -fold) for <b>homeologous</b> recombination. A mutation in MSH 3 did not affect the rate of recombination in this orientation. Surprisingly, a pms 1 deletion mutant did not exhibit elevated <b>homeologous</b> recombination in either case. Next, I investigated whether mismatch correction acts as a specific or general obstacle to <b>homeologous</b> recombination by blocking one or many exchange pathways. To answer this question, I performed structural analysis on numerous recombinant products from each strain to determine the percentage of products that fell into a given class (crossovers or gene conversions). Each percentage was then multiplied by the overall rate to arrive at a rate of recombination for individual events. Typically 90 - 100 % of homologous and <b>homeologous</b> recombinant products could be accounted for, either as crossovers or gene conversions. Recombination for all classes of products was inhibited when divergent sequences were present, indicating that homeology blocks formation of both crossovers and gene conversions. Sequence analysis of a limited number of <b>homeologous</b> recombinants indicated that transfer of DNA occurred in continuous stretches and that endpoints fell within regions of 3 - 11 base pairs of perfect homology. Mutations in the mismatch repair genes MSH 2 or MSH 3 that elevate the overall rate of <b>homeologous</b> recombination produced similar rate increases in formation of each recombinant class. This suggests that mismatch correction proteins block multiple types of <b>homeologous</b> recombination events. Taken together, these results support the hypothesis that <b>homeologous</b> and homologous recombination occur by the same (or similar) pathways, with mismatch repair superimposed as an extra level of control over the fidelity of the process. I also investigated whether this <b>homeologous</b> recombination system would be useful in a genetic screen to identify novel genes or new alleles of genes known to increase exchanges between diverged DNA sequences. Hyperhomeologous recombination mutants were isolated following ethylmethane sulfonate mutagenesis of yeast that harbored the spt 15 <b>homeologous</b> duplication. Preliminary characterization of these mutants demonstrated that some of these isolates yielded phenotypes that were consistent with mutations in mismatch repair genes verifying the utility of this method to identify such mutants. To improve the use of this system for a mutant screen, I developed a second generation <b>homeologous</b> duplication using URA 3. These new starter strains are expected to be important for efficient isolation and characterization of hyperhomeologous recombination mutants...|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} the {{mechanism by which}} recombination between imperfectly matched sequences (<b>homeologous</b> recombination) is suppressed in mammalian chromosomes. DNA substrates were constructed, each containing a thymidine kinase (tk) gene disrupted by insertion of an XhoI linker and {{referred to as a}} “recipient” gene. Each substrate also contained one of several “donor” tk sequences that could potentially correct the recipient gene via recombination. Each donor sequence either was perfectly homologous to the recipient gene or contained <b>homeologous</b> sequence sharing only 80 % identity with the recipient gene. Mouse Ltk− fibroblasts were stably transfected with the various substrates and tk+ segregants produced via intrachromosomal recombination were recovered. We observed exclusion of <b>homeologous</b> sequence from gene conversion tracts when <b>homeologous</b> sequence was positioned adjacent to homologous sequence in the donor but not when <b>homeologous</b> sequence was surrounded by homology in the donor. Our results support a model in which <b>homeologous</b> recombination in mammalian chromosomes is suppressed by a nondestructive dismantling of mismatched heteroduplex DNA (hDNA) intermediates.

In this study, the effects of these mutations were further analyzed by quantitation of mitotic <b>homeologous</b> recombinants as crossovers, gene conversions or exceptional events in wild-type, msh 2, msh 3 and msh 2 msh 3 mutant strains. When <b>homeologous</b> sequences were present as a direct repeat in one orientation, crossovers and gene conversions were elevated in msh 2, msh 3 and msh 2 msh 3 strains. The increases were greater in the msh 2 msh 3 double mutant than in either single mutant. When the order of the <b>homeologous</b> sequences was reversed, the msh 2 mutation again yielded increased rates of crossovers and gene conversions. However, in an msh 3 strain, gene conversions occurred at higher levels but interchromosomal crossovers were not increased and intrachromosomal crossovers were reduced relative to wild type. The msh 2 msh 3 double mutant behaved like the msh 2 single mutant in this orientation.

HSV- 1 and HSV- 2 tk genes have 81 % nucleotide identity and hence are <b>homeologous.</b> Correction of the insertion mutant HSV- 1 tk gene via recombination with the hybrid tk sequence required an exchange between <b>homeologous</b> tk sequences, although recombination could initiate within a region of significant sequence identity. Seven cell lines containing linked HSV- 1 and HSV- 1 -HSV- 2 hybrid tk sequences gave rise to tk+ segregants at an average rate of 10 (- 8) events per cell division. DNA sequencing revealed that each recombinant from these lines displayed an apparent gene conversion which involved an accurate transfer of an uninterrupted block of information between <b>homeologous</b> tk sequences.

Chromosomal rearrangements were identified in each population by molecular marker analysis and were classified as de novo <b>homeologous</b> nonreciprocal transpositions (HNRTs), preexisting HNRTs, and <b>homeologous</b> reciprocal transpositions (HRTs). Ninety-nine de novo HNRTs were identified by the presence of a few lines having duplication of a chromosomal region and loss of the corresponding <b>homeologous</b> region. These de novo HNRTs were more prevalent in one population that had a resynthesized B. napus as a parent.

Nine preexisting HNRTs were identified in the three populations involving natural B. napus parents, which likely originated from previous <b>homeologous</b> exchanges.

The use of a chromosomal inverted-repeat recombination assay to measure spontaneous recombination between 91 and 100 % identical sequences demonstrated differences in the fidelity of recombination in pathways defined by their dependence on RAD 51 and RAD 59. In addition, the regulation of <b>homeologous</b> recombination in rad 51 and rad 59 mutants displayed distinct patterns of inhibition by different members of the MMR pathway. Whereas the requirements for the MutS homolog, MSH 2, and the MutL homolog, MLH 1, in the suppression of <b>homeologous</b> recombination were similar in rad 51 strains, the loss of MSH 2 caused a greater loss in <b>homeologous</b> recombination suppression than did the loss of MLH 1 in a rad 59 strain.

Segregation analysis of SSR markers showed 42 codominant SSRs with unexpected null bands among some progeny. Chi-square tests for these loci deviate from the expected 1 : 2 : 1 Mendelian ratio under disomic inheritance. A linkage map of 357 codominant loci aligned on 20 linkage groups (LGs) with a total length of 1728 cM, averaging 5. 1 cM between markers, was developed.

40|$|In {{allopolyploid}} species, fair meiosis {{could be}} challenged by <b>homeologous</b> chromosome pairing {{and is usually}} achieved {{by the action of}} <b>homeologous</b> pairing suppressor genes. Oilseed rape (Brassica napus) haploids (AC, n = 19) represent an attractive model for studying the mechanisms used by allopolyploids to ensure the diploid-like meiotic pairing pattern. In oilseed rape haploids, <b>homeologous</b> chromosome pairing at metaphase I was found to be genetically based and controlled by a major gene, PrBn, segregating in a background of polygenic variation. In this study, we have mapped PrBn within a 10 -cM interval on the C genome linkage group DY 15 and shown that PrBn displays incomplete penetrance or variable expressivity. We have identified three to six minor QTL/BTL that have slight additive effects on the amount of pairing at metaphase I but do not interact with PrBn. We have also detected a number of other loci that interact epistatically, notably with PrBn. Our results support the idea that, as in other polyploid species, metaphase I <b>homeologous</b> pairing in oilseed rape haploids is controlled by an integrated system of several genes, which function in a complex manner...|$|E
40|$|The paleopolyploid soybean genome was {{investigated}} by sequencing <b>homeologous</b> BAC clones anchored by duplicate N-hydroxycinnamoyl/benzoyltransferase (HCBT) genes. The <b>homeologous</b> BACs were genetically mapped to linkage groups C 1 and C 2. Annotation of the 173, 747 - and 98, 760 -bp BACs showed that gene conservation in both order and orientation is high between <b>homeologous</b> regions {{with only a}} single gene insertion/deletion and local tandem duplications differing between the regions. The nucleotide sequence conservation extends into intergenic regions as well, probably due to conserved regulatory sequences. Most of the homeologs {{appear to have a}} role in either transcription/DNA binding or cellular signaling, suggesting a potential preference for retention of duplicate genes with these functions. Reverse transcriptase–PCR analysis of homeologs showed that in the tissues sampled, most homeologs have not diverged greatly in their transcription profiles. However, four cases of changes in transcription were identified, primarily in the HCBT gene cluster. Because a mapped locus corresponds to a soybean cyst nematode (SCN) QTL, the potential role of HCBT genes in response to SCN is discussed. These results are the first sequenced-based analysis of <b>homeologous</b> BACs in soybean, a diploidized paleopolyploid...|$|E
40|$|Pairing between wheat (Triticum turgidum and T. aestivum) <b>homeologous</b> {{chromosomes}} is {{prevented by}} {{the expression of}} the Ph 1 locus on the long arm of chromosome 5 B. The genome of Aegilops speltoides suppresses Ph 1 expression in wheat × Ae. speltoides hybrids. Suppressors with major effects were mapped as Mendelian loci on the long arms of Ae. speltoides chromosomes 3 S and 7 S. The chromosome 3 S locus was designated Su 1 -Ph 1 and the chromosome 7 S locus was designated Su 2 -Ph 1. A QTL with a minor effect was mapped on the short arm of chromosome 5 S and was designated QPh. ucd- 5 S. The expression of Su 1 -Ph 1 and Su 2 -Ph 1 increased <b>homeologous</b> chromosome pairing in T. aestivum × Ae. speltoides hybrids by 8. 4 and 5. 8 chiasmata/cell, respectively. Su 1 -Ph 1 was completely epistatic to Su 2 -Ph 1, and the two genes acting together increased <b>homeologous</b> chromosome pairing in T. aestivum × Ae. speltoides hybrids to the same level as Su 1 -Ph 1 acting alone. QPh. ucd- 5 S expression increased <b>homeologous</b> chromosome pairing by 1. 6 chiasmata/cell in T. aestivum × Ae. speltoides hybrids and was additive to the expression of Su 2 -Ph 1. It is hypothesized that the products of Su 1 -Ph 1 and Su 2 -Ph 1 affect pairing between <b>homeologous</b> chromosomes by regulating the expression of Ph 1 but the product of QPh. ucd- 5 S may primarily regulate recombination between homologous chromosomes...|$|E
40|$|Polyploidization {{constitutes}} a common mode of evolution in flowering plants. This event provides {{the raw material}} for the divergence of function in <b>homeologous</b> genes, leading to phenotypic novelty that {{can contribute to the}} success of polyploids in nature or their selection for use in agriculture. Mounting evidence underlined the existence of <b>homeologous</b> expression biases in polyploid genomes; however, strategies to analyze such transcriptome regulation remained scarce. Important factors regarding <b>homeologous</b> expression biases remain to be explored, such as whether this phenomenon influences specific genes, how paralogs are affected by genome doubling, and what is the importance of the variability of <b>homeologous</b> expression bias to genotype differences. This study reports the expressed sequence tag assembly of the allopolyploid Coffea arabica and one of its direct ancestors, Coffea canephora. The assembly was used for the discovery of single nucleotide polymorphisms through the identification of high-quality discrepancies in overlapped expressed sequence tags and for gene expression information indirectly estimated by the transcript redundancy. Sequence diversity profiles were evaluated within C. arabica (Ca) and C. canephora (Cc) and used to deduce the transcript contribution of the Coffea eugenioides (Ce) ancestor. The assignment of the C. arabica haplotypes to the C. canephora (CaCc) or C. eugenioides (CaCe) ancestral genomes allowed us to analyze gene expression contributions of each subgenome in C. arabica. In silico data were validated by the quantitative polymerase chain reaction and allele-specific combination TaqMAMA-based method. The presence of differential expression of C. arabica <b>homeologous</b> genes and its implications in coffee gene expression, ontology, and physiology are discussed. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E
40|$|Diploidization, {{which follows}} whole genome {{duplication}} events, {{does not occur}} evenly across the genome. In salmonid fishes, certain pairs of <b>homeologous</b> chromosomes preserve tetraploid loci in higher frequencies toward the telomeres due to residual tetrasomic inheritance. Research suggests this occurs only in <b>homeologous</b> pairs where one chromosome arm has undergone a fusion event. We present a linkage map for Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus), a salmonid species with relatively fewer chromosome fusions. Genotype by sequencing identified 19, 418 SNPs, and a linkage map consisting of 4508 markers was constructed from a subset of high quality SNPs and microsatellite markers {{that were used to}} anchor the new map to previous versions. Both male- and female-specific linkage maps contained the expected number of 39 linkage groups. The chromosome type associated with each linkage group was determined, and 10 stable metacentric chromosomes were identified, along with a chromosome polymorphism involving the sex chromosome AC 04. Two instances of a weak form of pseudolinkage were detected in the telomeric regions of <b>homeologous</b> chromosome arms in both female and male linkage maps. Chromosome arm homologies within the Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) genomes were determined. Paralogous sequence variants (PSVs) were identified, and their comparative BLASTn hit locations showed that duplicate markers exist in higher numbers on seven pairs of <b>homeologous</b> arms, previously identified as preserving tetrasomy in salmonid species. <b>Homeologous</b> arm pairs where neither arm has been part of a fusion event in Arctic charr had fewer PSVs, suggesting faster diploidization rates in these regions...|$|E
40|$|A {{library of}} “introgression lines” {{containing}} Solanum lycopersicoides chromosome segments in the genetic background of cultivated tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) {{was used to}} study factors affecting <b>homeologous</b> recombination. Recombination rates were estimated in progeny of 43 heterozygous introgressions and whole-chromosome substitution lines, together representing 11 of the 12 tomato chromosomes. Recombination within <b>homeologous</b> segments was reduced to as little as 0 – 10 % of expected frequencies. Relative recombination rates were positively correlated with the length of introgressed segments on the tomato map. The highest recombination (up to 40 – 50 % of normal) was observed in long introgressions or substitution lines. Double-introgression lines containing two <b>homeologous</b> segments on opposite chromosome arms were synthesized to increase their combined length. Recombination was higher in the double than in the single segment lines, despite a preference for crossovers {{in the region of}} homology between segments. A greater increase in <b>homeologous</b> recombination was obtained by crossing the S. lycopersicoides introgression lines to L. pennellii—a phylogenetically intermediate species—or to L. esculentum lines containing single L. pennellii segments on the same chromosome. Recombination rates were highest in regions of overlap between S. lycopersicoides and L. pennellii segments. The potential application of these results to breeding with introgression lines is discussed...|$|E

Sequencing was performed on 4 libraries from developing fibers of Li 2 mutant and wild type near-isogenic lines at the peak of elongation followed by mapping and PolyCat categorization of RNA-seq data to the reference D 5 genome (G. raimondii) for <b>homeologous</b> gene expression analysis. The majority of <b>homeologous</b> genes, 83. 6 % according to the reference genome, were expressed during fiber elongation. Our results revealed: 1) approximately two times more genes were induced in the AT subgenome comparing to the DT subgenome in wild type and mutant fiber; 2) the subgenome expression bias was significantly reduced in the Li 2 fiber transcriptome; 3) Li 2 had a significantly greater effect on the DT than on the AT subgenome. Transcriptional regulators and cell wall <b>homeologous</b> genes significantly affected by the Li 2 mutation were reviewed in detail. This is the first report to explore the effects of a single mutation on <b>homeologous</b> gene expression in allotetraploid cotton.

In the absence of Ph 1, the two chromosomes recombine as if they were completely homologous. Chromosomes having either terminal or interstitial segments of chromosome 1 A m in 1 A were constructed and their recombination with 1 A was investigated {{in the presence of}} Ph 1. No recombination was detected in the <b>homeologous</b> (1 A m / 1 A) segments, irrespective of whether terminally or interstitial positioned in a chromosome, whereas the levels of recombination in the juxtaposed homologous (1 A/ 1 A) segments was normal or close to normal relative to completely homologous 1 A chromosomes. These observations show that Ph 1 does not regulate chromosome pairing by premeiotic chromosome alignment and a mitotic spindle-centromere interaction, as has been suggested, but processes homology along the entire length of chromosomes...|$|E
