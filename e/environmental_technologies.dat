5|$|New <b>environmental</b> <b>technologies</b> in heating, lighting, {{ventilation}} {{and sanitation}} were also critical to creating taller buildings that were attractive to work in. Central heating {{could not be}} easily extended to serve larger buildings; in the 1850s, a system using low-pressure steam and steam-operated fans became adopted {{in the construction of}} the later skyscrapers. Many U.S. buildings were lit by gas, but this carried safety risks and was difficult to install in taller buildings. As an alternative, electric lights were installed from 1878 onwards, powered by basement generators. Ventilation was also a challenge, as smoke drifting into offices from the streets and the fumes from the gas lighting made air quality a major health issue. A steam-driven, forced-draft ventilation system was invented in 1860 and became widely used in taller buildings by the 1870s, overcoming much of the problem. Improvements in iron piping permitted running hot and cold water and sanitation facilities to be installed throughout taller buildings for the first time.|$|E

2500|$|In {{response}} to this, Lisa P. Jackson, the acting Administrator for the EPA, {{argued that the}} EPA’s implementation of the Clean Air Act has stimulated the US <b>environmental</b> <b>technologies</b> industry {{has led to an}} increase in revenue. [...] "In 2008, that industry generated nearly $300 billion in revenue and $44 billion in exports.” She continued on saying, “Yesterday, the University of Massachusetts and Ceres released an analysis finding that two of the updated CAA standards EPA is preparing to establish … will create nearly 1.5 million jobs over the next 5 years." [...] She also brought attention to the effects that the CAA has on society by stating, [...] "in 2010 alone, EPA's implementation of the CAA saved more than 160,000 US lives, avoided more than 100,000 hospital visits; prevented millions of cases of respiratory illness, including bronchitis and asthma; enhanced US productivity by preventing millions of lost workdays; and kept US children healthy and in school." [...] Supplementing this, on March 1, 2011, the EPA released a report that estimated, “…the direct benefits from the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments are estimated to reach almost $2 trillion for the year 2020, a figure that dwarfs the direct costs of implementation ($65 billion).” The saving reported here are mainly due to the estimated reduction of early deaths caused by pollution. [...] These findings are based upon already observed trends.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} collaborative innovation in business networks for small <b>environmental</b> <b>technology</b> companies entering an emerging market (EM). Export of <b>environmental</b> <b>technology</b> solutions to emerging economies involves high investment opportunities and high growth potential, but also high risk. For example, large-scale demonstrator equipment proving the function of the <b>environmental</b> <b>technology</b> solution might be needed, which usually requires cooperation between several companies and supporting actors. Results from empirical studies presented in this paper confirm the difficulties to export <b>environmental</b> <b>technology</b> solutions to EMs for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Collaboration in business networks appears to be an efficient means to take on larger assignments, and business models built on principles of product service systems (PSS) where the technology can be integrated, and functionality is of main focus. A preliminary business development process model for small firms’ <b>environmental</b> <b>technology</b> export to EMs is developed and presented.
