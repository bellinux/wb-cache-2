50|$|Assortative mating {{in humans}} {{has been widely}} {{observed}} and studied, and {{can be broken down}} into two types of human assortative mating. These are <b>genetic</b> <b>assortative</b> <b>mating,</b> or assortative mating with mate choice based on genetic type and phenotypical expression, and social assortative mating, or assortative mating with mate choice based on social, cultural, and other societal factors.|$|E
50|$|<b>Genetic</b> <b>assortative</b> <b>mating</b> is well {{studied and}} documented. In 1903 Pearson and colleagues {{reported}} strong correlations in height, span of arms, {{and the length}} of the left forearm between husband and wife in 1000 couples. Assortative mating with regards to appearance does not end there. Males prefer female faces that resemble their own when provided images of three women, with one image modified to resemble their own. However, the same result does not apply to females selecting male faces.|$|E
40|$|In human populations, <b>assortative</b> <b>mating</b> {{is almost}} univer­sally positive, with {{similarities}} between partners for quantit­ative phenotypes, common disease risk, beha­vi­our 6, social factors and personality. The causes and <b>genetic</b> consequences of <b>assortative</b> <b>mating</b> remain un­re­solved because partner similarity can arise from different mechanisms: phenotypic assortment based on mate choice, partner interaction and convergence in phenotype over time, or social homogamy where individuals pair according to social or environmental background. Here, we present theory and an analytical approach {{to test for}} <b>genetic</b> evidence of <b>assortative</b> <b>mating</b> and find a correlation in genetic value among partners {{for a range of}} phenotypes. Across three independent samples of 24, 662 spousal pairs in total, we infer a correlation at trait-associated loci between partners for height (0. 200, 0. 004 standard error, SE) that matched the phenotypic correlation (0. 201, 0. 004 SE), and a correlation at trait-associated loci for BMI (0. 143, 0. 007 SE) that was significantly lower than the phenotypic value (0. 228, 0. 004 SE). We extend our analysis to the UK Biobank study (7, 780 pairs), finding evidence of a correlation at trait-associated loci for waist-to-hip ratio (0. 101, 0. 041 SE), systolic blood pressure (0. 138, 0. 064 SE) and educational attainment (0. 654, 0. 014 SE).

50|$|Barriers to {{gene flow}} need {{not always be}} physical. Sympatric {{speciation}} happens when new species from the same ancestral species arise along the same range. This is often {{a result of a}} reproductive barrier. For example, two palm species of Howea found on Lord Howe Island were found to have substantially different flowering times correlated with soil preference, resulting in a reproductive barrier inhibiting gene flow. Species can live in the same environment, yet show very limited gene flow due to reproductive barriers, fragmentation, specialist pollinators, or limited hybridization or hybridization yielding unfit hybrids. A cryptic species is a species that humans cannot tell is different without the use of genetics. Moreover, gene flow between hybrid and wild populations can result in loss of genetic diversity via <b>genetic</b> pollution, <b>assortative</b> <b>mating</b> and outbreeding.|$|R

Wildlife {{diseases}} are emerging at a higher rate than ever before meaning that understanding their potential impacts is essential, especially for those species and populations that may already be of conservation concern. The link between population genetic structure and the resistance of populations to disease is well understood: high genetic diversity allows populations to better cope with environmental changes, including the outbreak of novel diseases. Perhaps following this common wisdom, numerous empirical and theoretical studies have investigated the link between disease and disassortative mating patterns, which can increase genetic diversity. Few however have looked at the possible link between disease and the establishment of <b>assortative</b> <b>mating</b> patterns. Given that <b>assortative</b> <b>mating</b> can reduce <b>genetic</b> variation within a population thus reducing the adaptive potential and long-term viability of populations, we suggest that this link deserves greater attention, particularly in those species already threatened by a lack of genetic diversity. Here, we summarise the potential broad scale <b>genetic</b> implications of <b>assortative</b> <b>mating</b> patterns and outline how infection by pathogens or parasites might bring them about. We include a review of the empirical literature pertaining to disease-induced <b>assortative</b> <b>mating.</b> We also suggest future directions and methodological improvements that could advance our understanding of how the link between disease and mating patterns influences genetic variation and long-term population viability.

Here, we estimated heritability by structural equation modeling (N = 20, 142), and performed a genome wide association (GWA) analysis (N = 7091) and a GCTA study (N = 3340) on hair color within a large cohort of twins, their parents and siblings from the Netherlands Twin Register (NTR). Self-reported hair color was analyzed as five binary phenotypes, namely “blond versus non-blond”, “red versus non-red”, “brown versus non-brown”, “black versus non-black”, and “light versus dark”. The broad-sense heritability of hair color was estimated between 73 % and 99 % and the genetic component included non-additive <b>genetic</b> variance. <b>Assortative</b> <b>mating</b> for hair color was significant, except for red and black hair color. From GCTA analyses, at most 24. 6 % of the additive genetic variance in hair color was explained by 1000 G well-imputed SNPs. Genome-wide association analysis for each hair color showed that SNPs in the MC 1 R region were significantly associated with red, brown and black hair, and also with light versus dark hair color.

40|$|Linkage {{studies of}} complex genetic traits raise {{questions}} about the effects of <b>genetic</b> heterogeneity and <b>assortative</b> <b>mating</b> on linkage analysis. To further understand these problems, I have simulated and analyzed family data for a complex genetic disease in which disease phenotype is determined by two unlinked disease loci. Two models were studied, a two-locus threshold model and a two-locus heterogeneity model. Information was generated for a marker locus linked to one of the disease-defining loci. Random-mating and assortative-mating samples were generated. Linkage analysis was then carried out by use of standard methods, under the assumptions of a single-locus disease trait and a random-mating population. Results were compared with those from analysis of a single-locus homogeneous trait in samples with the same levels of <b>assortative</b> <b>mating</b> as those considered for the two-locus traits. The results show that (1) introduction of <b>assortative</b> <b>mating</b> does not, in itself, markedly affect the estimate of the recombination fraction; (2) the power of the analysis, reflected in the LOD scores, is somewhat lower with assortative rather than random mating. Loss of power is greater with increasing levels of assortative mating; and (3) for a heterogeneous genetic disease, regardless of mating type, heterogeneity analysis permits more accurate estimate of the recombination fraction but may be of limited use in distinguishing which families belong to each homogeneous subset. These simulations also confirmed earlier observations that linkage to a disease "locus" can be detected even if the disease is incorrectly defined as a single-locus (homogeneous) trait, although the estimated recombination fraction will be significantly greater than the true recombination fraction between the linked disease-defining locus and the marker locus...|$|R
50|$|Humans display these <b>genetic</b> {{results of}} <b>assortative</b> <b>mating</b> too, just like other animals. What makes humans unique, however, {{is the human}} {{tendency}} towards seeking mates that are not only similar to us in genetics and in appearances, but those who are similar to us economically, socially, educationally, and culturally. These tendencies toward using sociological characteristic to make determinations about spouse choice has many effects on the lives and livelihoods of those who choose to marry one another, {{as well as their}} children and future generations. Within a generation, <b>assortative</b> <b>mating</b> is sometimes cited as a source of inequality, as those who mate assortatively would marry people of similar station to themselves, thus exacerbating their current station. There is debate, however, about whether this growing preference for educational and occupational similarities in spouses is due to increased preferences for these traits, or the shift in workload that occurred as women entered the workforce. This concentration of wealth in families also perpetuates across generations as parents pass their wealth on to their children, with each successive generation inheriting the resources of both of its parents. The combined resources of the parents allow them to give their child a better life growing up, and the combined inheritances from both parents place them at an even greater advantage than they would be with their superior education and childhoods. This has an enormous impact {{on the development of the}} social economic structure of a society.|$|R

50|$|<b>Assortative</b> <b>mating</b> is a {{mating pattern}} and {{a form of}} sexual {{selection}} in which individuals with similar phenotypes mate with one another more frequently than would be expected under a random mating pattern. Examples of similar phenotypes include, {{but are not limited}} to, body size, skin coloration/pigmentation, and age. <b>Assortative</b> <b>mating,</b> also referred to as positive <b>assortative</b> <b>mating</b> or homogamy, may increase genetic relatedness within the family. <b>Assortative</b> <b>mating</b> can be contrasted with disassortative mating (also known as negative <b>assortative</b> <b>mating</b> or heterogamy) in which individuals with dissimilar genotypes and/or phenotypes mate with one another more frequently than would be expected under random mating. Disassortative mating reduces the genetic similarities within the family. Positive <b>assortative</b> <b>mating</b> occurs more frequently than negative <b>assortative</b> <b>mating.</b> In both cases, due to the nonrandom mating pattern, there is a deviation from the Hardy-Weinberg principle (which states that genotype frequencies in a population will remain constant from generation to generation in the absence of other evolutionary influences).|$|R
40|$|Has {{there been}} an {{increase}} in positive <b>assortative</b> <b>mating?</b> Does <b>assortative</b> <b>mating</b> contribute to household income inequality? Data from the United States Census Bureau suggests there has been a rise in <b>assortative</b> <b>mating.</b> Additionally, <b>assortative</b> <b>mating</b> a¤ects household income inequality. In particular, if matching in 2005 between husbands and wives had been random, instead of the pattern observed in the data, then the Gini coe ¢ cient would have fallen from the observed 0. 43 to 0. 34, so that income inequality would be smaller. Thus, <b>assortative</b> <b>mating</b> is important for income inequality. The high level of married female labor-force participation in 2005 is important for this result...|$|R
50|$|Several {{hypotheses}} {{have been}} proposed to explain the phenomenon of <b>assortative</b> <b>mating.</b> <b>Assortative</b> <b>mating</b> has evolved {{from a combination of}} different factors, which vary across different species.|$|R
50|$|<b>Assortative</b> <b>mating</b> has {{reproductive}} consequences. Positive <b>assortative</b> <b>mating</b> increases <b>genetic</b> relatedness {{within a}} family, whereas negative <b>assortative</b> <b>mating</b> accomplishes the opposite effect. Either strategy may be {{employed by the}} individuals of a species depending upon which strategy maximizes fitness and enables the individuals to maximally pass on their genes to the next generation. For instance, {{in the case of}} eastern bluebirds, <b>assortative</b> <b>mating</b> for territorial aggression increases the probability of the parents obtaining and securing a nest site for their offspring. This in turn increases the likelihood of survival of the offspring and consequently fitness of the individuals. In birds whose coloration represents well being and fecundity of the bird, positive <b>assortative</b> <b>mating</b> for color increases the chances of genes being passed on and of the offspring being in good condition. Also, positive <b>assortative</b> <b>mating</b> for behavioral traits allows for more efficient communication between the individuals and they can cooperate better to raise their offspring.|$|R
40|$|<b>Assortative</b> <b>mating</b> {{has been}} {{suggested}} to result {{in an increase in}} heritability and additive genetic variance through an increase in linkage disequilibrium. The impact of <b>assortative</b> <b>mating</b> on linkage disequilibrium was explicitly examined for the two-locus model of Wright (1921) and two selective <b>assortative</b> <b>mating</b> models. For the Wright (1921) model, when the proportion of <b>assortative</b> <b>mating</b> was high, positive linkage disequilibrium was generated. However, when the proportion of <b>assortative</b> <b>mating</b> was similar to that found in some studies, the amount of linkage disequilibrium was quite low. In addition, the amount of linkage disequilibrium was independent of the level of recombination. For two selective assortative models, the amount of linkage disequilibrium was a function of the amount of recombination. For these models, the linkage disequilibrium generated was negative mainly because repulsion heterozygotes were favored over coupling heterozygotes. From these findings, the impact of <b>assortative</b> <b>mating</b> on linkage disequilibrium, and consequently heritability and additive genetic variance, appears to be small and model-specific...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the pattern of}} educational <b>assortative</b> <b>mating,</b> its evolution over time, {{and its impact on}} household income inequality. To these ends, we use rich data from the United States and Norway over the period 1980 - 2007. We find evidence of positive <b>assortative</b> <b>mating</b> at all levels of education in both countries. However, the time trends vary by the level of education: Among college graduates, <b>assortative</b> <b>mating</b> has been declining over time, whereas individuals with a low level of education are increasingly sorting into internally homogenous marriages. When looking within the group of college educated, we find strong but declining <b>assortative</b> <b>mating</b> by academic major. These findings motivate and guide a decomposition analysis, where we quantify the contribution of various factors to the distribution of household income. We find that educational <b>assortative</b> <b>mating</b> accounts for a non-negligible part of the cross-sectional inequality in household income. However, changes in <b>assortative</b> <b>mating</b> over time barely move the time trends in household income inequality. The reason is that the decline in <b>assortative</b> <b>mating</b> among the highly educated is offset by an increase in <b>assortative</b> <b>mating</b> among the less educated. By comparison, increases in the returns to education over time generate a considerable rise in household income inequality, but these price effects are partly mitigated by increases in college attendance and completion rates among women...|$|R
50|$|<b>Assortative</b> <b>mating</b> can, at times, arise as a {{consequence}} of social competition. Traits in certain individuals may indicate competitive ability which allows them to occupy the best territories. Individuals with similar traits that occupy similar territories are more likely to mate with one another. In this scenario, <b>assortative</b> <b>mating</b> does not necessarily arise from choice, but rather by proximity. This was noted in western bluebirds although there is no definite evidence that this is the major factor resulting in color dependent <b>assortative</b> <b>mating</b> in this species. Different factors may apply simultaneously to result in <b>assortative</b> <b>mating</b> in any given species.|$|R

Slow elimination of intermediate individuals caused by the gradual tightening of <b>assortative</b> <b>mating,</b> which evolves owing to relatively weak disruptive selection, provides the alternative scenario for sympatric speciation, in addition to fast elimination of intermediate individuals as a result of the direct action of strong disruptive selection under an invariant mode of <b>assortative</b> <b>mating.</b> Even when <b>assortative</b> <b>mating</b> alone cannot split an initially coherent population, it may be able to prevent the merging of species after their secondary contact...|$|R

40|$|The {{evolution}} of <b>assortative</b> <b>mating</b> {{is a key}} component of the process of speciation with gene flow. Several recent theoretical studies have pointed out, however, that sexual selection which can result from <b>assortative</b> <b>mating</b> may cause it to plateau at an intermediate level; this is primarily owing to search costs of individuals with extreme phenotypes and to assortative preferences developed by individuals with intermediate phenotypes. I explore the limitations of <b>assortative</b> <b>mating</b> further by analysing a simple model in which these factors have been removed. Specifically, I use a haploid two-population model to ask whether the existence of <b>assortative</b> <b>mating</b> is sufficient to drive the further {{evolution of}} <b>assortative</b> <b>mating.</b> I find that a weakening in the effective strength of sexual selection with strong assortment leads to the existence of both a peak level of trait differentiation and the evolution of an intermediate level of <b>assortative</b> <b>mating</b> that will cause that peak. This result is robust to the inclusion of local adaptation and different genetic architecture of the trait. The results imply the existence of fundamental limits to the evolution of assortment via sexual selection in this situation, with which other factors, such as search costs, may interact...|$|R

40|$|Divergence in {{the face}} of gene flow is perhaps the most wildly disputed subject among {{researchers}} through time. The debate is an old one and we find its origin {{as far back as the}} era of Darwin. The theories dealing with sympatric and parapatric speciation, its processes and ecological conditions, are numerous and the empirical data supporting the ideas is constantly growing. However, the reach of a consensus almost seem as distant as ever. Two fundamental prerequisites can be identified for the evolution of divergence with gene flow, the act of disruptive selection, and the development of <b>assortative</b> <b>mating.</b> A set of models in which speciation with gene flow seem particularly likely is when a shift occurs in host preference in phytophagous insects and mating takes place on the host. In the work behind this thesis, the role of <b>assortative</b> <b>mating</b> in the initial stages of sympatric and parapatric speciation has been studied, as has the interaction between <b>assortative</b> <b>mating</b> and inbreeding and how it effects speciation in small sympatric populations, an aspect not much attended to earlier in the literature. My results show that <b>assortative</b> <b>mating</b> based on resource preference, can evolve rapidly upon secondary contact, and even in parapatric populations with a migration rate of 8 % (13 - 15 individuals) per generation. However for <b>assortative</b> <b>mating</b> to be maintained selection against hybrids is needed. My results also suggests that small inbred populations have a hard time coping with strong <b>assortative</b> <b>mating</b> an as a consequence tend to relax their mating preferences to avoid inbreeding depression.

40|$|A long-standing goal in {{evolutionary}} biology {{is to identify}} the conditions that promote the evolution of reproductive isolation and speciation. The factors promoting sympatric speciation have been of particular interest, both because it is notoriously difficult to prove empirically and because theoretical models have generated conflicting results, depending on the assumptions made. Here, we analyze {{the conditions under which}} selection favors the evolution of <b>assortative</b> <b>mating,</b> thereby reducing gene flow between sympatric groups, using a general model of selection, which allows fitness to be frequency dependent. Our analytical results are based on a two-locus diploid model, with one locus altering the trait under selection and the other locus controlling the strength of assortment (a “one-allele” model). Examining both equilibrium and nonequilibrium scenarios, we demonstrate that whenever heterozygotes are less fit, on average, than homozygotes at the trait locus, indirect selection for <b>assortative</b> <b>mating</b> is generated. While costs of <b>assortative</b> <b>mating</b> hinder the evolution of reproductive isolation, they do not prevent it unless they are sufficiently great. <b>Assortative</b> <b>mating</b> that arises because individuals mate within groups (formed in time or space) is most conducive to the evolution of complete <b>assortative</b> <b>mating</b> from random <b>mating.</b> <b>Assortative</b> <b>mating</b> based on female preferences is more restrictive, because the resulting sexual selection can lead to loss of the trait polymorphism and cause the relative fitness of heterozygotes to rise above homozygotes, eliminating the force favoring assortment.

Our search led to 154 correlations of height between partners. We classified the populations as western and non-western based on geography. These correlations were then analyzed via meta-analytic techniques. Results - 148 of the correlations for partner heights were positive and the overall analysis indicates moderate positive <b>assortative</b> <b>mating</b> (r[*]=[*]. 23). Although <b>assortative</b> <b>mating</b> was slightly stronger in countries that can be described as western compared to non-western, this difference was not statistically significant. We found no evidence for a change in <b>assortative</b> <b>mating</b> for height over time. There was substantial residual heterogeneity in effect sizes and this heterogeneity was most pronounced in western countries. Conclusions - Positive <b>assortative</b> <b>mating</b> for height exists in human populations, but is modest in magnitude suggesting that height is not a major factor in mate choice. Future research is necessary to understand the underlying causes of the large amount of heterogeneity observed in the degree of <b>assortative</b> <b>mating</b> across human populations, which may stem from a combination of methodological and ecological differences...|$|R
