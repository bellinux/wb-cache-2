In a Q&A, he claimed, [...] "There was some switching of character names later in production, and <b>Im</b> <b>not</b> exactly <b>sure</b> how Psylocke got thrown into the mix." [...] Meiling Melançon said, [...] "There was discussion that she was Kwannon or possibly other characters too, but I cant comment on the final choice made. There were certain aspects of her that were true to Psylocke: the red tattoo from Crimson Dawn, and the purple hair - though it was obviously shorter. Outfit-wise - {{and this is my}} personal opinion only - if she was standing there in her usual skintight outfit - which I do find sexy and would have been so stoked to wear - it might not have matched the tone or what the other characters were wearing." [...] In the films DVD audio commentary, the director Brett Ratner confirmed that the character was in fact Psylocke and not Revanche.|$|R

[...] Entertainment Weekly said [...] "the albums garbled title is also preparation for some of the clumsiest lyrics to be heard on a pop record in years ... The songs are riddled with such overwritten Psych 101 ruminations." [...] The Village Voice criticised the lyrics, saying [...] "Much like even non-football fans used to be mesmerized by Howard Cosells genius for never using two words when 23 would do, you dont have to be a love-damaged 17-year-old girl to find Under Rug Swepts dense verbiage a trip. Words tumble forth and arrange themselves kaleidoscopically into all sorts of unusual categories ... <b>Im</b> just <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> that pop music should come out of a thesaurus." [...] NME called it [...] "a tedious album" [...] with [...] "overwrought folk-rock like Surrendering and Hands Clean destined for a thousand organic juice bars. Lyrically, its often hilarious ...

Tanner StranskyEntertainment Weekly In its original American broadcast, [...] "The Chase" [...] was seen by 10.89 million viewers, according to Nielsen Media Research. Among viewers between ages 18 and 49, it received a 3.6 rating/9 share, which at the time was the lowest rating for an individual episode of Desperate Housewives in series history. This continued a downward trend in the ratings for the show: each of the previous three episodes had been the lowest rated in series history until the airing of the next episode in the subsequent week. [...] "The Chase" [...] dropped in viewership three percent from the previous episode, [...] "Lovely". Like that episode, [...] "The Chase" [...] suffered in the ratings partially due to competition from the NBC broadcast of the 2010 Winter Olympics, which drew an estimated 21.3 million viewers.

5000|$|McCain {{was almost}} killed on board Forrestal on July 29, 1967. While the air wing was {{preparing}} to launch attacks, a Zuni rocket from an F-4 Phantom accidentally fired across the carriers deck. [...] The rocket struck either McCains A-4E Skyhawk or one near it. The impact ruptured the Skyhawks fuel tank, which ignited the fuel and knocked two bombs loose. [...] McCain later said, [...] "I thought my aircraft exploded. Flames were everywhere." [...] McCain escaped from his jet by climbing out of the cockpit, working himself to {{the nose of the}} jet, and jumping off its refueling probe onto the burning deck. His flight suit caught on fire as he rolled through the flames, but he was able to put it out. [...] He went to help another pilot trying to escape the fire when the first bomb exploded; McCain was thrown backwards ten feet (three meters) and suffered minor wounds when struck in the legs and chest by fragments. McCain helped crewmen throw unexploded bombs overboard off the hangar deck elevator, then went to Forrestals ready room and with other pilots watched the ensuing fire and the fire-fighting efforts on the rooms closed-circuit television. The fire killed 134 sailors, injured scores of others, destroyed at least 20 aircraft, and took 24 hours to control. [...] In Saigon a day after the conflagration, McCain praised the heroism of enlisted men who gave their lives trying to save the pilots on deck, and told New York Times reporter R. W. Apple, Jr., [...] "Its a difficult thing to say. But now that Ive seen what the bombs and the napalm did to the people on our ship, <b>Im</b> <b>not</b> so <b>sure</b> that I want to drop any more of that stuff on North Vietnam."

Following the October release of The Peel Sessions 1991-2004, a compilation of songs recorded from 1991 to 2000 during her radio sessions with John Peel, she began recording her seventh studio album White Chalk in November, together with Flood, John Parish, and Eric Drew Feldman in a studio in West London. White Chalk was released in September 2007 and marked {{a radical departure from}} her usual alternative rock style, consisting mainly of piano ballads. The album received favourable reviews, its style being described by one critic as containing [...] "pseudo-Victorian elements—drama, restraint, and antiquated instruments and sounds." [...] Harvey herself said of the album: [...] "when I listen to the record I feel in a different universe, really, and <b>Im</b> <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> whether its in the past or in the future. The record confuses me, thats what I like—it doesnt feel of this time right now, but <b>Im</b> <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> whether its 100 years ago or 100 years in the future", summing up the albums sound as [...] "really weird." [...] During the tour for the album Harvey performed without a backing band, and also began performing on an autoharp, which continues to be her primary instrument after guitar and has influenced her material since White Chalk.|$|E
