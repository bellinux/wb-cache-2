40|$|AbstractA best {{evidence}} topic was written {{according to a}} structured protocol. The question addressed was {{whether there is a}} survival benefit from life-long follow-up after treatment for thyroid cancer. A total of 137 papers were identified using the reported searches of which 7 represented the {{best evidence}} to answer the clinical question. The authors, date, journal, study type, population, main outcome measures and results are tabulated. The existing guidelines for follow-up in thyroid cancer recommend life-long follow-up as recurrence may present after 5 years. However, the strategy of life-long follow-up for everyone (as advised by the British, <b>European</b> and American <b>Thyroid</b> <b>Association</b> guidelines) is not evidence-based. The issue {{is that some of the}} recurrences may present after 5 years and low volume recurrence may be more effectively treated. However, as in many other malignancies, there is no study that reliably shows a survival benefit conferred from life-long follow-up, especially in stage 1 disease. Moreover, the risk of recurrence only parallels the risk of disease-specific mortality in the older thyroid cancer patient group (> 45 years at diagnosis). The evidence from the present review supports a risk stratified approach to follow-up for thyroid cancer since low-risk thyroid cancer is associated with low recurrence rates and mortality compared to the other groups. For young patients (< 45 years at diagnosis) with stage 1 disease, there is no proven survival benefit from life-long follow-up following primary treatment. These patients could be safely discharged to primary care after 5 years for follow-up with yearly thyroglobulin measurements...|$|R
40|$|Hypothyroidism is a {{pathologic}} condition {{generated by}} the thyroid hormone deficiency. The American <b>Thyroid</b> <b>Association</b> advises for the screening of hypothyroidism beginning at 35 years and thereafter every 5 years in people {{at high risk for}} this condition: females older than 60 years, pregnant women, patients with other autoimmune disease or patients with a history of neck irradiation. In pregnant women, hypothyroidism can been associated with adverse effect for both mother and child. The „Guidelines of the American <b>Thyroid</b> <b>Association</b> for the Diagnosis and Management of Thyroid Disease During Pregnancy and Postpartum“ recommends the treatment of maternal overt hypothyroidism: females with a thyrotropin (TSH) level higher than the trimester-specific reference interval and decreased free thyroxine (FT 4), and females for which TSH level is higher than 10. 0 mIU/L, irrespective of the FT 4 value, with administration of oral levothyroxine. The goal of treatment of maternal overt hypothyroidism is to bring back the serum TSH values to the reference range specific for the pregnancy trimester. The Guidelines of the „European <b>Thyroid</b> <b>Association</b> for the Management of Subclinical Hypothyroidism in Pregnancy and in Children“ recommends treatment of pregnancy associated subclinical hypothyroidism with the following levothyroxine doses: „ 1. 20 μg/kg/day for TSH≤ 4. 2 mU/l, 1. 42 μg/kg/day for TSH > 4. 2 - 10 and 2. 33 μg/kg/day for overt hypothyroidism“. The „Guidelines of the American <b>Thyroid</b> <b>Association</b> for the Diagnosis and Management of Thyroid Disease During Pregnancy and Postpartum“ and the „European <b>Thyroid</b> <b>Association</b> for the Management of Subclinical Hypothyroidism in Pregnancy and in Children“ do not recommend the treatment of isolated hypothyroxinemia in pregnancy...|$|R

To get further insight on the genes and pathways regulated by T 3 in the developing brain at the cellular level, we used mouse cerebrocortical cells in primary culture.

40|$|Background/Objectives: Thyroid {{cancer is}} the most common {{endocrine}} malignancy and accounts for 1 % of cancers. In recent years, there has been much interest in the feasibility of using miRNAs or miRNA panels as biomarkers for the diagnosis of thyroid cancer. miRNAs are noncoding RNAs with 21 - 23 nucleotides that are highly conserved during evolution. They have been proposed as regulators of gene expression, apoptosis, cancer, and cell growth and differentiation. Methods: The Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ), Google Scholar, PubMed (NLM), LISTA (EBSCO), and Web of Science were searched. Results: The serum level of miRNAs (miRNA- 375, 34 a, 145 b, 221, 222, 155, Let- 7, 181 b) can be used as molecular markers for the diagnosis and prognosis of thyroid cancer in the serum samples of patients with thyroid glands. Conclusions: Given that most common methods for the screening of thyroid cancer cannot detect the disease in its early stages, identifying miRNAs that are released in the bloodstream during the gradual progression of the disease is considered a key method in the early diagnosis of thyroid cancers.

40|$|Objective. Although {{differentiated}} thyroid cancer (DTC) {{usually has}} an indolent course, some cases show a poor prognosis; therefore, risk stratification is required. The {{objective of this}} study is to compare the predictive ability of classical risk stratification systems proposed by the <b>European</b> <b>Thyroid</b> <b>Association</b> (ETA) and American Thyroid Association (ATA) with the system proposed by Tuttle et al. in 2010, based on the response to initial therapy (RIT). Methods. We retrospectively reviewed 176 cases of DTC with a median follow-up period of 7. 0 years. Each patient was stratified using ETA, ATA, and RIT systems. Negative predictive value (NPV) and positive predictive value (PPV) were determined. The area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was calculated in order to compare the predictive ability. Results. RIT showed a NPV of 97. 7 %, better than NPV of ETA and ATA systems (93. 9 % and 94. 9 %, resp.). ETA and ATA systems showed poor PPV (40. 3 % and 41 %, resp.), while RIT showed a PPV of 70. 8 %. The area under ROC curve was 0. 7535 for ETA, 0. 7876 for ATA, and 0. 9112 for RIT, showing statistical significant differences P< 0. 05. Conclusions.

40|$|Background: The American Thyroid Association (ATA) {{and more}} {{recently}} the <b>European</b> <b>Thyroid</b> <b>Association</b> (ETA) Guidelines on {{diagnosis and treatment of}} medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) have provided an excellent tool which was formerly lacking in the field of management of MTC. However, some relevant clinical questions, as the use of somatostatin analogues in the treatment of MTC and the management of pregnant patients with MTC, which were recommended in the guidelines, have been lately extensively revised. Moreover the current issue whether GLP- 1 (a glucagon-like peptide- 1) analogue is associated with MTC has only superficially been analyzed. Methods: Publications have been retrieved in MEDLINE at Pubmed (there is no fix date retrospectively) up to October 2012 using the terms “medullary thyroid carcinoma”, “somatostatin”, “pregnancy ” and “incretins”. The recommendations made by ATA and ETA were considered. Conclusions: There are no data supporting the application of somatostatin analogues in the treatment of MTC, while thyroid cancer during or after pregnancy has no impact on the prognosis of disease or on the outcome of pregnancy. However, women with MEN 2 should be carefully controlled before any planned or during any unplanned pregnancy.
