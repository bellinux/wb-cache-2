Details of pre-operative symptoms, surgical procedure and post-operative complications were collected from the patient notes. Each patient was sent a questionnaire regarding success of the procedure, compensatory sweating and overall satisfaction. Results 46 <b>hyperhydrosis</b> patients (34 females) age range 14 – 57 years. 20 patients suffered with <b>hyperhydrosis</b> in a combination of areas, 14 in the axillae alone, 9 palms alone and with 2 facial symptoms. There were 2 early post-operative complications, 1 haemothorax which required a chest drain and a chest infection. 3 patients required redo procedures. Of follow-up of 42 months (range 6 – 84), 32 (69 · 5 %) patients reported complete dryness or a significant improvement in symptoms and 15 a substantial improvement in quality of life. However 43 patients (93 %) suffered with compensatory sweating, of these 27 had to change clothes more than once daily. Compensatory sweating was graded as severe in 18 and incapacitating in 2. Of note only 5 patients noticed an improvement in the compensatory sweating over time. Only 26 (56 %) would recommend thoracoscopic sympathectomy to others with <b>hyperhydrosis.</b> ConclusionThoracoscopic sympathectomy is effective {{in the treatment of}} <b>hyperhydrosis.</b> However compensatory sweating seems unavoidable and infrequently improves with time.

40|$|Background: <b>Hyperhydrosis,</b> {{excessive}} sweating, can profoundly {{affect the}} quality of life of the patient, with severe impairment of daily activities, social relationships and occupational activities. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the outcome of thoracoscopic sympathectomy in patients with palmar <b>hyperhydrosis.</b> Methods: In a clinical trial at Imam Khomeini, Milad and Velenjak Hospitals from 2003 to 2006, 33 patients older than five years of age with palmar <b>hyperhydrosis</b> underwent thoracoscopic sympathectomy of T 2 and T 3 ganglions. The variables regarding operation duration, length of hospital stay and early post-op complications were recorded. In addition, {{the quality of}} life of the patients was evaluated using the DLQI questionnaire, while the satisfaction of the patients was evaluated using the visual analogue scale before, immediately after and six months after the operation. Results: The mean age of the patients was 23 years and 63. 6 % of our patients were female. The sites of <b>hyperhydrosis</b> were hand, foot and armpit in 72. 7 % of the patients. In 90. 91 % of the cases, disease onset occurred during childhood and 78. 79 % of the patients had a family history of <b>hyperhydrosis.</b> <b>Hyperhydrosis</b> impaired function and had social, interpersonal and emotional effects in 72. 7 % of the cases. The mean duration of the operation was 40. 3 minutes and the mean hospital stay was 1. 45 days. The most common early post-op complications were atelectasis (7. 57 %), short-term pulmonary complications (3. 03 %) and pleural effusion (3. 03 %). Compensatory <b>hyperhydrosis</b> occurred in 60 % of the cases, while 18. 75 % experienced gustatory sweating. Palms were reported to be totally dry immediately after and six months after the operation in 81. 82 % of the cases, while 18. 18 % reported acceptable levels of perspiration. The mean level of satisfaction immediately after and six months after the procedure was 0. 81. All patients felt improvement in all aspects of their lives immediately after and six months after the operation. In terms of quality of life, the mean of DLQI score was significantly lower immediately after and six months after operation (18. 78 &plusmn; 501 vs. 1. 60 &plusmn; 0. 81 and 1. 64 &plusmn; 1), indicating that symptoms had less effect on the patients' lives.

Conclusion: Thoracoscopic sympathectomy is an effective and safe therapeutic modality for palmar <b>hyperhydrosis</b> with a great rate of success and a slight chance of complica-tions. This operation results in a remarkable improvement in various aspects of the patients' lives. Willingness to re-experience the operation indicates the high degree of satisfaction...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Bilateral {{endoscopic}} thoracic sympathectomy (BETS) {{has been}} shown to be an effective, permanent, and safe treatment for severe upper limb <b>hyperhydrosis.</b> More recently, the possibility of using BETS to treat facial blushing, a redness of the face bought on by emotional or social stress, has been raised. This followed incidental reports from patients of relief from their blushing following this procedure for <b>hyperhydrosis.</b> At King's College Hospital, 120 patients underwent BETS over a 3 -year period for both upper limb <b>hyperhydrosis</b> and facial blushing. In this study we report our results in relation to facial blushing. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The outcome was evaluated by questionnaire and symptoms assessed using the visual analogue scale. Questions on postoperative complications and overall quality of life were included. RESULTS: A total of 80 patients responded to our questionnaire of whom 59 (74 %) experienced facial blushing. In 12 patients, this was their only symptom. Severity of facial blushing was reduced from a mean score of 78 before operation to 26 after BETS (P < 0. 001); 29 % reported complete resolution of their facial blushing. There was no mortality or conversion to open surgery. Quality of life was reported to be much better in 63 % of facial blushers following the procedure. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates both a statistically significant reduction in severity of facial blushing as well as a clear improvement in quality of life following a safe procedure with few complication rates. Facial blushing can, therefore, be considered as an indication for BETS on its own merit when not associated with <b>hyperhydrosis...</b>|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectives. We {{assessed}} {{the impact of}} transthoracic endoscopic sympathectomy (TES) {{on the quality of}} life of patients with palmar <b>hyperhydrosis.</b> Design. A retrospective questionnaire based study. Methods. Patients undergoing TES at our institution between 1997 and 2002 received a SF- 36 quality of life postal questionnaire. The pre- and post-operative symptoms were assessed. Statistical analysis was by means of the Student's t test. Results. Ninety-four TES were carried out in 62 patients. Forty-one cases were female. The age range was 17 – 64 years. The mean follow-up period was 38. 46 months. Mean hospital stay was 3 days. Compensatory <b>hyperhydrosis</b> was reported in 29 cases and only considered severe in four cases (9. 7 %). Forty-one patients replied to the questionnaire (66 %).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the efficacy of}} bilateral transthoracic endoscopic sympathectomy (TES), in alleviating symptoms and improving {{quality of life for}} patients in Hawaii. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients who had undergone TES were evaluated by phone interview and the SF- 36 questionnaire to assess improvements in symptoms and the development of compensatory <b>hyperhydrosis.</b> SF- 36 scores were divided into 8 scales and evaluated by one-tailed t-test. RESULTS: Since 1999, eight patients (five women and three men, mean age 27. 4 years old, range 15 - 41 yrs) underwent TES without significant complication. Length of hospital stay was less than one day for all patients except one, who stayed four days. Estimated operative blood lost was less than 100 ml and no blood transfusions were required. No Horner's syndrome was suffered. After a mean follow-up of 7. 0 months (range 1. 2 - 15. 8 months), none of the patients had recurrent symptoms in the palms but all reported moderate compensatory <b>hyperhydrosis</b> located mainly in the trunk and lower extremities (two patients). SF- 36 scores showed significant improvements in social functioning (p < 0. 005), mental health (p < 0. 049), and role-physical (p < 0. 020) along with an increase in bodily pain (p < 0. 012).

40|$|PurposeThis study compares early {{results of}} video-assisted thoracoscopic sympathectomy (VTS) at the {{thoracic}} T 2 versus T 3 ganglion denervation levels {{for the treatment}} of palmar <b>hyperhydrosis</b> (PH). MethodsSixty patients with PH were prospectively randomized for VTS at the thoracic T 2 or T 3 ganglion denervation levels. The patients underwent postoperative evaluation on three occasions: before surgery, and 1 and 6 months after the operation. Endpoints included the absence of PH, the presence, location, and severity of compensatory <b>hyperhydrosis</b> (CH), and a quality-of-life assessment. ResultsFifty-nine of 60 patients reported complete resolution of PH after surgery. One failure occurred in the T 3 group. CH was observed in 26 patients (86. 66 %) in the T 2 group and in 27 patients (90 %) in the T 3 group at 1 month. At 6 months, 30 of 30 patients in the T 2 group and 29 of 30 in the T 3 group experienced CH, although in the T 3 group, CH was less severe at both 1 and 6 months (P <. 05). Quality of life was very poor in both groups before surgery. One month after operation, quality of life was improved similarly in both groups. This improvement was maintained at 6 months in both groups. ConclusionPH is well treated by VTS at either the T 2 or T 3 levels.

40|$|Purpose: We {{compared}} {{the results from}} a video-assisted thoracoscopic sympathectomy (VTS) at the T 4 denervation level with those from a VTS at the T 3 level {{for the treatment of}} palmar <b>hyperhydrosis</b> (PH). Methods: Seventy patients with PH were prospectively followed for VTS at the T 3 or T 4 denervation levels for 6 months. The end points of this study were: absence of PH, compensatory <b>hyperhydrosis</b> (CH), and quality-of-life assessment. Results: Sixty-seven patients reported a complete resolution of PH after surgery. One failure occurred in the T 3 group and 2 in the T 4 group. When anhydrosis was obtained, we noticed totally dry hands in 26 patients in the T 3 group and 6 patients in the T 4 group. The other 27 patients in the T 4 group and 8 in the T 3 group maintained a small level of sweating and were also considered to be therapeutic successes. At 6 months, 25 patients in the T 4 group had some degree of CH (71. 42 %) and all patients in the T 3 group (100 %), though the T 4 group had a lower degree of severity of CH at the 6 -month follow-up (P < 0. 05). After the operation, quality of life was improved similarly in both groups. Conclusions: VTS at either the T 3 or T 4 level provides an effective treatment for PH. VTS at the T 4 level is associated with a less severe form of CH. Despite the occurrence of CH, patients' quality of life is significantly improved following VTS at the T 3 or T 4 levels.
