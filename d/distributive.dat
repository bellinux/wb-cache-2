5|$|Feminist economists {{call for}} a shift in how {{economic}} success is measured. These changes include an increased focus on a policy's ability to bring society toward social justice and improve people's lives, through specific goals including <b>distributive</b> fairness, equity, the universal provisioning of needs, elimination of poverty, freedom from discrimination {{and the protection of}} human capabilities.|$|E
5|$|A ring likewise, has {{a set of}} elements, but now has two {{operation}}s. The first operation {{must make}} the set a group, and the second operation is associative and <b>distributive</b> {{with respect to the}} first operation. It {{may or may not be}} commutative; this means that the result of applying the operation to a first and a second element is the same as to the second and first—the order of the elements does not matter. If every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse (an element x such that ax = xa = 1), the ring is called a division ring. A field is defined as a commutative division ring.|$|E

25|$|A poset antimatroid {{has as its}} {{feasible}} {{sets the}} lower sets of a finite partially ordered set.

25|$|In mathematics, the {{congruence}} lattice problem {{asks whether}} every algebraic <b>distributive</b> lattice is isomorphic to the congruence lattice {{of some other}} lattice. The problem was posed by Robert P. Dilworth, and for many years {{it was one of}} the most famous and long-standing open problems in lattice theory; it had a deep impact on the development of lattice theory itself. The conjecture that every <b>distributive</b> lattice is a congruence lattice is true for all <b>distributive</b> lattices with at most ℵ1 compact elements, but F. Wehrung provided a counterexample for <b>distributive</b> lattices with ℵ2 compact elements using a construction based on Kuratowski's free set theorem.|$|E
25|$|A <b>distributive</b> lattice is complemented if {{and only}} if it is bounded and {{relatively}} complemented. The lattice of subspaces of a vector space provide an example of a complemented lattice that is not, in general, <b>distributive.</b>|$|E
25|$|In a <b>distributive</b> negotiation, {{each side}} often adopts an extreme position, knowing {{it will not}} be accepted—and then uses a {{combination}} of guile, bluffing, and brinkmanship to cede as little as possible before reaching a deal. <b>Distributive</b> bargainers conceive of negotiation as a process of distributing a fixed amount of value. A <b>distributive</b> negotiation often involves people who have never had a previous interactive relationship, nor are they likely to do so again in the near future.|$|E
25|$|In any partial order, {{the lower}} sets form a lattice {{in which the}} lattice's partial {{ordering}} is given by set inclusion, the join operation corresponds to set union, and the meet operation corresponds to set intersection, because unions and intersections preserve the property of being a lower set. Because set unions and intersections obey the <b>distributive</b> law, this is a <b>distributive</b> lattice. Birkhoff's theorem states that any finite <b>distributive</b> lattice can be constructed in this way.|$|E
25|$|In mathematics, Birkhoff's {{representation}} theorem for <b>distributive</b> lattices {{states that}} the elements of any finite <b>distributive</b> lattice can be represented as finite sets, {{in such a way}} that the lattice operations correspond to unions and intersections of sets. The theorem can be interpreted as providing a one-to-one correspondence between <b>distributive</b> lattices and partial orders, between quasi-ordinal knowledge spaces and preorders, or between finite topological spaces and preorders. It is named after Garrett Birkhoff, who published a proof of it in 1937.|$|E
25|$|Thus the <b>distributive</b> law fails.|$|E
25|$|Boolean algebra, a complemented <b>distributive</b> lattice.|$|E
25|$|Given a lattice with {{a bottom}} element 0 {{and a top}} element 1, a pair x,y of {{elements}} is called complementary when x∧y= 0 and x∨y= 1, and we then say that y is a complement of x and vice versa. Any element x of a <b>distributive</b> lattice with top and bottom can have at most one complement. When every element of a lattice has a complement the lattice is called complemented. It follows that in a complemented <b>distributive</b> lattice, the complement of an element always exists and is unique, making complement a unary operation. Furthermore, every complemented <b>distributive</b> lattice forms a Boolean algebra, and conversely every Boolean algebra forms a complemented <b>distributive</b> lattice. This provides an alternative definition of a Boolean algebra, namely as any complemented <b>distributive</b> lattice. Each of these three properties can be axiomatized with finitely many equations, whence these equations taken together constitute a finite axiomatization of the equational theory of Boolean algebras.|$|E
25|$|Many lattices can {{be defined}} {{in such a way}} that the {{elements}} of the lattice are represented by sets, the join operation of the lattice is represented by set union, and the meet operation of the lattice is represented by set intersection. For instance, the Boolean lattice defined from the family of all subsets of a finite set has this property. More generally any finite topological space has a lattice of sets as its family of open sets. Because set unions and intersections obey the <b>distributive</b> law, any lattice defined in this way is a <b>distributive</b> lattice. Birkhoff's theorem states that in fact all finite <b>distributive</b> lattices can be obtained this way, and later generalizations of Birkhoff's theorem state a similar thing for infinite <b>distributive</b> lattices.|$|E

25|$|Birkhoff's theorem, {{as stated}} above, is a {{correspondence}} between individual partial orders and <b>distributive</b> lattices. However, {{it can also}} be extended to a correspondence between order-preserving functions of partial orders and bounded homomorphisms of the corresponding <b>distributive</b> lattices. The direction of these maps is reversed in this correspondence.|$|E

25|$|There {{exists a}} direct limits {{preserving}} functor Φ, from {{the category of}} all <b>distributive</b> lattices with zero and 0-lattice embeddings to the category of all lattices with zero and 0-lattice embeddings, such that ConcΦ is naturally equivalent to the identity. Furthermore, Φ(S) is a finite atomistic lattice, for any finite <b>distributive</b> (∨,0)-semilattice S.|$|E
25|$|In an {{infinite}} <b>distributive</b> lattice, {{it may not}} be the case that the lower sets of the join-irreducible elements are in one-to-one correspondence with lattice elements. Indeed, there may be no join-irreducibles at all. This happens, for instance, in the lattice of all natural numbers, ordered with the reverse of the usual divisibility ordering (so x≤y when y divides x): any number x can be expressed as the join of numbers xp and xq where p and q are distinct prime numbers. However, elements in infinite <b>distributive</b> lattices may still be represented as sets via Stone's representation theorem for <b>distributive</b> lattices, a form of Stone duality in which each lattice element corresponds to a compact open set in a certain topological space. This generalized representation theorem can be expressed as a category-theoretic duality between <b>distributive</b> lattices and spectral spaces (sometimes called coherent spaces, but not the same as the coherent spaces in linear logic), topological spaces in which the compact open sets are closed under intersection and form a base for the topology. Hilary Priestley showed that Stone's representation theorem could be interpreted as an extension of the idea of representing lattice elements by lower sets of a partial order, using Nachbin's idea of ordered topological spaces. Stone spaces with an additional partial order linked with the topology via Priestley separation axiom can also be used to represent bounded <b>distributive</b> lattices. Such spaces are known as Priestley spaces. Further, certain bitopological spaces, namely pairwise Stone spaces, generalize Stone's original approach by utilizing two topologies on a set to represent an abstract distributve lattice. Thus, Birkhoff's representation theorem extends to the case of infinite (bounded) <b>distributive</b> lattices in at least three different ways, summed up in duality theory for <b>distributive</b> lattices.|$|E
25|$|The main {{goals of}} {{treatment}} in <b>distributive</b> shock are {{to reverse the}} underlying cause and achieve hemodynamic stabilization. Immediate treatment involves fluid resuscitation {{and the use of}} vasoactive drugs, both vasopressors and inotropes. Hydrocortisone is used for patients whose hypotension does not respond to fluid resuscitation and vasopressors. Opening and keeping open the microcirculation is a consideration in the treatment of <b>distributive</b> shock, as a result limiting the use of vasopressors has been suggested. Control of inflammation, vascular function and coagulation to correct pathological differences in blood flow and microvascular shunting has been pointed to as a potentially important adjunct goal in the treatment of <b>distributive</b> shock.|$|E
