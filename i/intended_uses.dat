[...] Folding kayaks are in some ways more traditional boats, being similar in design to skin-on-frame kayaks used by native people. [...] Modern folding kayaks use ash and birch or contemporary materials such as aluminum for the frame, and replace the sealskin covering with synthetic waterproof fabrics. [...] Unlike native kayaks, folding kayaks can be easily disassembled and packed for transport. [...] Many folding kayaks include inflatable sponsons that improve the secondary stability of the vessel, helping to prevent capsize. [...] More recently, a class of inflatable folding kayaks has emerged, combining a more limited rigid frame with a tightly inflated skin to produce greater rigidity than an inflatable boat alone.|$|E

40|$|Background: In {{electronic}} health (eHealth) evaluations, {{there is}} increasing attention for studying the actual usage of a technology {{in relation to the}} outcomes found, often by studying the adherence to the technology. On the basis of the definition of adherence, we suggest that the following three elements are necessary to determine adherence to eHealth technology: (1) the ability to measure the usage behavior of individuals; (2) an operationalization of intended use; and (3) an empirical, theoretical, or rational justification of the <b>intended</b> <b>use.</b> However, to date, little is known on how to operationalize the intended usage of and the adherence to different types of eHealth technology. Objective: The study aimed to improve eHealth evaluations by gaining insight into when, how, and by whom the concept of adherence has been used in previous eHealth evaluations and finding a concise way to operationalize adherence to and <b>intended</b> <b>use</b> of different eHealth technologies. Methods: A systematic review of eHealth evaluations was conducted to gain insight into how the use of the technology was measured, how adherence to different types of technologies was operationalized, and if and how the <b>intended</b> <b>use</b> of the technology was justified. Differences in variables between the use of the technology and the operationalization of adherence were calculated using a chi-square test of independence. Results: In total, 62 studies were included in this review. In 34 studies, adherence was operationalized as “the more use, the better,” whereas 28 studies described a threshold for <b>intended</b> <b>use</b> of the technology as well. Out of these 28, only 6 reported a justification for the <b>intended</b> <b>use.</b> The proportion of evaluations of mental health technologies reporting a justified operationalization of <b>intended</b> <b>use</b> is lagging behind compared with evaluations of lifestyle and chronic care technologies. The results indicated that a justification of <b>intended</b> <b>use</b> does not require extra measurements to determine adherence to the technology. Conclusions: The results of this review showed that to date, justifications for <b>intended</b> <b>use</b> are often missing in evaluations of adherence. Evidently, it is not always possible to estimate the <b>intended</b> <b>use</b> of a technology. However, such measures do not meet the definition of adherence and should therefore be referred to as the actual usage of the technology. Therefore, it can be concluded that adherence to eHealth technology is an underdeveloped and often improperly used concept in the existing body of literature. When defining the <b>intended</b> <b>use</b> of a technology and selecting valid measures for adherence, the goal or the assumed working mechanisms should be leading. Adherence can then be standardized, which will improve the comparison of adherence rates to different technologies with the same goal and will provide insight into how adherence to different elements contributed to the outcomes...|$|R
