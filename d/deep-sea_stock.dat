For many stocks, knowledge and data remain insufficient for scientific analysis (COM (2007) 30 final), which is also reflected in recent TAC and Quota setting. Moreover, according to the European Commission, the poor state of key <b>deep-sea</b> <b>stocks</b> {{and the lack of}} scientific data clearly demonstrates the need for an improved management framework for deep-sea fisheries, as proposed by the Commission in 2012 (see IP/ 12 / 813). Based on recent research by CSIRO Australia, using close-kin analysis, a method that has particular po-tential for generating abundance for the management of Southern Bluefin Tuna, utility for transfer to deep-sea species will be assessed. In particular a range of genetic tech-niques and their utility for close-kin mark-recapture applications will be evaluated with respect to feasibility and utility in the context of yielding scientific advice implemented under the remit of the CFP.

40|$|<b>Deep-sea</b> fish <b>stocks</b> {{consist of}} species that live at depths of greater than 400 metres. While being {{important}} for EU fisheries, this natural renewable resource is particularly vulnerable to over-fishing, as many deep sea species are slow-growing and commonly of low fecundity. Generally {{little is known about}} the biology of deep sea species, and there prevails a substantial lack of scientific data on <b>deep-sea</b> <b>stocks.</b> This constitutes a major impediment to management strategies underpinning sustainable and profitable deep sea fisheries. Europe’s deep-sea fisheries began in the 1970 ’s and were entirely unregulated. The fleet grew as rewards were high, but many species were rapidly depleted. It was only in 2003 that a management plan was brought into action. While some measures to better protect commercially exploited deep sea fish have been adopted, such as the limitation of fishing effort or total allowable catches, these have been insufficient to allow stocks to recover and there is a general consensus that most deep-water stocks remain below safe biological limits for exploitation. In a recent communication to the Council and the European Parliament, the European Commission has emphasized the need to improve our knowledge on deep sea fish species to move away from the current prevailing unsustainable exploitation. Ideally, this would be the development of a robust and practical approach to estimate the abundance of deep sea species to support stock assessments and reduce the uncertainty about the state and rebuilding rates of commercially exploited deep sea stocks. The current rapid technology development and concurrent steep drop in costs of large-scale genotyping offers major opportunities for fisheries management. This report explores whether the concept of genetic close-kin abundance estimation, recently applied to establish biomass estimates of Southern Bluefin Tuna, can be applied to fisheries management of deep sea fish species.

40|$|In 2006 the General Assembly adopted {{resolution}} 61 / 105, {{based on}} a compromise proposal offered by deep-sea fishing nations, which committed States and regional fisheries management organisations [RFMOs] to take specific measures to protect vulnerable marine ecosystems [VMEs] from the adverse impacts of bottom fisheries in the high seas and to ensure the longterm sustainability of <b>deep-sea</b> fish <b>stocks.</b> These measures included conducting impact assessments to determine whether significant adverse impacts[SAIs] to VMEs would occur, managing fisheries to prevent SAIs on VMEs, and closing areas {{of the high seas}} to bottom fishing where VMEs are known or likely to occur, unless regulations are in place to prevent SAIs and to manage sustainably <b>deep-sea</b> fish <b>stocks.</b> Based on a review in 2009 of the actions taken by States and RFMOS, the UNGA adoptedresolution 64 / 72 that reaffirmed resolution 61 / 105 and strengthened the call for action through committing States, inter alia, to ensure that vessels do not engage in bottom fishing until impact assessments have been carried out and to not authorise bottom fishing activities until the measures in resolutions 64 / 72 and 61 / 105 have been adopted andimplemented...|$|R
40|$|Deep-sea {{fisheries}} operate globally {{throughout the}} world's oceans, chiefly targeting stocks {{on the upper}} and mid-continental slope and offshore seamounts. Major commercial fisheries occur, or have occurred, for species such as orange roughy, oreos, cardinalfish, grenadiers and alfonsino. Few deep fisheries have, however, been sustainable, with most <b>deep-sea</b> <b>stocks</b> having undergone rapid and substantial declines. Fishing in the deep sea not only harvests target species but can also cause unintended environmental harm, mostly from operating heavy bottom trawls and, to a lesser extent, bottom longlines. Bottom trawling over hard seabed (common on seamounts) routinely removes most of the benthic fauna, resulting in declines in faunal biodiversity, cover and abundance. Functionally, these impacts translate into loss of biogenic habitat from potentially large areas. Recent studies on longline fisheries show that their impact is much less than from trawl gear, but can still be significant. Benthic taxa, especially the dominant mega-faunal components of deep-sea systems such as corals and sponges, can be highly vulnerable to fishing impacts. Some taxa have natural resilience due to their size, shape, and structure, and some can survive in natural refuges inaccessible to trawls. However, many deep-sea invertebrates are exceptionally long-lived and grow extremely slowly: these biological attributes mean that the recovery capacity of the benthos is highly limited and prolonged, predicted to take decades to centuries after fishing has ceased. The low tolerance and protracted recovery of many deep-sea benthic communities has implications for managing environmental performance of deep-sea fisheries, including that (i) expectations for recovery and restoration of impacted areas may be unrealistic in acceptable time frames, (ii) the high vulnerability of deep-sea fauna makes spatial management—that includes strong and consistent conservation closures—an important priority, and (iii) biodiversity conservation should be > balanced with options for open areas that support sustainable fisheries...|$|R
40|$|This study loolcs at {{demersal}} fish food web interactions {{present at the}} Rockall Trough. Rockall Trough lies within Ices division V. This area is highly exploited {{by a number of}} mixed deep-water fisheries. Despite this there has been a lag in management of the area and an overall lack of knowledge of food web interactions. From examining previous literature and carrying out stable isotope analysis on a number of species, it became clear that there is a strong link between the {{demersal fish}} population and surface production. Pervious studies have suggested there to be two main sources of food to the demersal fish fauna. The first is via the exploitation of pelagic species on the slops exploitation of mesopelagic and benthopelagic prey species that overlap in depth range, or/and that carry out vertical /horizontal migrations. Carcase falls also fall within this first source of food to the deep-sea as they are a direct link to the surface. The second source of food is that of endemic benthic prey species, which appears to be less prominent in the fishes diet. A large number of demersal fish are seen to feed on a combination of these sources of food. Stable isotope analysis, appear to confirm the strong link between surface production and demersal fish as many fish are found with low SN 15 levels normally associated with feeding on pelagic species. The removal of commercial mesopelagic species found to be important prey species to the demersal fish fauna, can have serious implications to the demersal food web and ultimately the management of <b>deep-sea</b> <b>stocks.</b> Issues relating to lack of a holistic approach in management and pollution concerns are mentioned.

Economic impact {{assessment}} methodology {{was applied to}} UK fisheries data {{to better understand the}} implications of European Commission proposals for fishing for <b>deep-sea</b> <b>stocks</b> in the North-East Atlantic under the CFP. The aim was to assist the UK fishing industry and Government in evaluating the most effective options to manage deep sea fish stocks. Because of the proposed changes to the list of species defined as being deep sea species, and a new definition of what constitutes a vessel targeting deep sea species, a total of 695 active UK fishing vessels would need a permit to fish for deep sea species.   However, due to existing and capped capacity limits many vessels would potentially not be able to obtain such a permit. The economic impact of these changes reveals that in the short term, landings would decrease by 6, 540 tonnes, reducing gross value added by £ 3. 3 million. Alternative options were assesed that provide mitigation measures to offset the impacts of the proposed regulations whilst at the same time providing more effective protection of deep sea Vulnerable Marine Ecosystems (VMEs). The options include setting a 400 metre depth rule beyond which vessels would potentially be classified as fishing for deep sea species and designating ‘core areas’ for deep sea fishing at depths > 400 metres to minimise the risk of bottom fishing gear on deep sea habitats. This approach would mean the impact of the proposals would essentially be reduced to zero; on average no vessels would be impacted by the proposal...|$|R

For species where data are available, productivity and rebound potential decrease with depth of occurrence. For a suite of deep-sea species studied, their productivity was on average less than half that of shelf and pelagic species. At present, about 17 species of sharks are fishery targets, and most are depleted or collapsed. On the other hand, some shelf sharks, such as houndsharks and sharpnose sharks might be fished sustainably since they are more productive than most deep-sea shark species.

40|$|The United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in 2002 {{adopted the}} first in a series of resolutions {{regarding}} the conservation of biodiversity in the deep sea. Prompted by seriousconcerns raised by scientists, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and numerous States,these resolutions progressively committed States to act both individually and through regional fishery management organizations (RFMOs) to either manage bottom fisheries in areas beyond national jurisdiction to prevent significant adverse impacts on deep-sea species, ecosystems and biodiversity or else prohibit bottom fishing from taking place. Ten years have passed since the adoption of resolution 61 / 105 in 2006, calling on States to take a set of specific actions to manage bottom fisheries in areas beyond national jurisdiction to protect vulnerable marine ecosystems (VMEs) from the adverse impacts of bottom fishing and ensure the sustainability of <b>deep-sea</b> fish <b>stocks.</b> Despite the considerable progress by some RFMOs, there remain significant gaps in the implementation of key elements and commitments in the resolutions.  The Deep Sea Conservation Coalition (DSCC)  has prepared this report to assist the UNGA in its review in 2016 and to address the following question: How effectively have the resolutions been implemented...|$|R
40|$|Size-based {{indicators}} are well {{established as a}} management tool in shelf seas as they respond to changes in fishing pressure and describe important aspects of community function. In the deep sea, however, vital rates are much slower and body size relationships vary with depth, making it less clear how size-based indicators can be applied and whether they are appropriate for detecting changes through time. The <b>deep-sea</b> fish <b>stocks</b> of the North Atlantic underwent a period of exploitation followed by management and conservation action that relieved this pressure. We used data from a deep-water bottom trawl survey in the Rockall Trough, at depths of 300 – 2000 m, to test whether size-based indicators changed over a 16 -year period, during which fishing pressure decreased. We applied four indicators to these data: mean body length, mean maximum length, large fish indicator (LFI) and {{the slope of the}} biomass spectrum. Patterns were analysed within four different depth bands. The LFI and slope of the biomass spectrum showed positive change over time, suggesting recovery from fishing pressure. This response was generally most apparent in the shallowest depth band, where most fishing activity has been distributed. Values of the LFI were much higher overall than in shelf seas, so the same reference points cannot be applied to all marine ecosystems. These findings imply that size-based indicators can be usefully applied to the deep sea and that they potentially track changes in fishing pressure in the medium term...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{outlines}} the approach {{taken by the}} European Union to the management of <b>deep-sea</b> fish <b>stocks.</b> An extensive range of measures was adopted in 2002, and implementation began in 2003. The scheme, which is binding on EU fishing vessels targeting deep-sea species in the North-East Atlantic, encompasses both input and output controls. In southern Europe and in the Mediterranean, deep-sea fisheries tend to be artisanal in nature, {{and in some cases}} of considerable antiquity. In northern community waters deepwater fisheries began in the 1970 ’s. These diverse fisheries, in several regions create particular problems for fisheries managers. The approach taken by the European Union was to adopt catch restrictions, in the form of total allowable catches for a range of the key deepwater species in the ICES area. In addition, a capacity restriction has been imposed. This requires that vessels that want to land more than a very small amount of some specified deepwater species should hold a license issued by its flag state. The overall capacity (in kilowatts and in gross tonnes) of vessels that can receive licences is limited to recent levels. The capacity limitation scheme is accompanied by a requirement to implement a scientific observer scheme in order to improve the scientific data available for assessment purposes.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{temperature}} increase on the <b>stock</b> of the <b>deep-sea</b> pink shrimp (Parapenaeus longirostris) was analysed {{along the western}} coasts of Italy (North Tyrrhenian–Ligurian Sea: Geographical Sub-Area 9). This crustacean is currently {{one of the most}} important commercial species of the trawl fisheries in the Mediterranean Sea. Landings of the species in the North Tyrrhenian–Ligurian Sea have grown consistently during the last years following a rapid increase in the stock size. Since the <b>deep-sea</b> pink shrimp <b>stock</b> is exploited on the same fishing ground of other heavily overexploited stocks in a full mixed and poorly selective fishery, its condition seems to be largely independent of the current fishing exploitation pattern suggesting a positive role of climate change on the dynamic of the stock. To test this hypothesis we investigated the effect of sea surface temperature (SST) on density and distribution of P. longirostris by means of general additive models (GAMs). Two different models were developed for the whole stock and for the recruits (CL < 20 mm) using time series of MEDITS (International bottom trawl survey in the Mediterranean) survey density indices (n km− 2) covering the period 1995 – 2010. Predictors included were geographical coordinates, quarterly averaged minimum SST, sampling depth and year. Spawners density was included as predictor into the GAM for recruits.

40|$|The {{bacterial}} isolate MT- 41 from 10, 476 m, {{nearly the}} greatest ocean depth, is obligately barophilic. The {{purpose of this}} study was to describe the morphological changes in MT- 41 due to nearly isothermal decompression followed by incubation at atmospheric pressure. Two cultures were grown at 103. 5 MPa and 2 °C and then decompressed to atmospheric pressure (0. 101 MPa). One of the cultures was fixed just before decompression. The other culture, kept at 0 °C, was sampled immediately and four more times over 168 h. The number of CFU (assayed at 103. 5 MPa and 2 °C) declined with incubation time at atmospheric pressure. Decompression itself did not lead to immediate morphological changes. The ultrastructure, however, was altered with increasing time at atmospheric pressure. The first aberrations were intracellular vesicles and membrane fragments in the medium. After these changes were plasmolysis, cell lysis, the formation of extracellular vesicles, and the formation of ghost cells. Intact cells in the longest incubation at atmospheric pressure had the normal cytoplasmic granularity suggestive of ribosomes but had few and poorly stained fibrils in the bacterial nucleoids. From the practical standpoint, samples of hadal deep-sea regions need to be fixed either in situ or shortly after arrival at the sea surface even when recovered in insulated sampling gear. This should prevent drastic structural degradation of sampled cells, thus allowing both accurate estimates of <b>deep-sea</b> benthic standing <b>stock</b> and realistic morphological descriptions...|$|R
40|$|First {{published}} online: October 27, 2016 Deep-sea sharks play {{a valuable}} ecological role helping maintain food web balance, {{yet they are}} vulnerable to commercial fishing because of slow growth rates and low reproductive capacity. Overfishing of sharks can heavily impact marine ecosystems and the fisheries these support. Knowledge of stock structure is integral to sustainable management of fisheries. The present study analysed vertebral chemistry using laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) to assay concentrations of 7 Li, 23 Na, 24 Mg, 55 Mn, 59 Co, 60 Ni, 63 Cu, 66 Zn, 85 Rb, 88 Sr, 138 Ba and 208 Pb to assess stock structure in a deep-sea shark, Etmopterus spinax, in Norwegian and French waters. Few studies have applied this technique to elasmobranch vertebrae and the present study represents its first application to a <b>deep-sea</b> shark. Three <b>stocks</b> were identified at the regional scale off western Norway, southern Norway, and France. At finer spatial scales there was evidence of strong population mixing. Overall, the general pattern of stock structure outlined herein provides some indication of the spatial scales at which stocks {{should be viewed as}} distinct fisheries management units. The identification of an effective multi-element signature for distinguishing E. spinax stocks utilizing Sr, Ba, Mg, Zn and Pb and the methodological groundwork laid in the present study could also expedite future research into stock structure for E. spinax and deep-sea elasmobranchs more generally.

40|$|The biology, ecology, and {{dynamics}} of the deep-sea teleost black scabbardfish in the northeast Atlantic are reviewed. The black scabbardfish is a commercial bathypelagic species found in the NE Atlantic mostly from Iceland to the Canary Islands and Western Sahara, at depths from 800 to 1300 m. The spatial structure of its population is still uncertain, although the existence of one single stock that migrates around the NE Atlantic driven by feeding and reproduction {{is the most likely}} hypothesis consistent with available data. This review is based on data from commercial fisheries off the Faroe Islands, Hatton Bank, the west of the British Isles, and Portugal (mainland, Azores, and Madeira) and from Icelandic and Scottish scientific surveys collected between 1988 and 2012. Spawning of black scabbardfish occurs around Madeira and the Canary Archipelagos during {{the last quarter of the}} year. According to the migratory hypothesis, eggs, larvae, and possibly juveniles move north to areas from south of Icelandic and Faroe Islands to the west of the British Isles where they remain for some years to feed and grow. Then, they move south to the area off mainland Portugal, where they reach the size of first maturity but do not reproduce, and later move further south to the spawning grounds. Further studies are needed to understand which of the environmental conditions prevailing around Madeira and the Canaries, but not elsewhere, allow this species to mature and subsequently reproduce. This review suggests that a multidisciplinary approach is required to confirm the spatiotemporal migration and habitats used by black scabbardfish populations in the NE Atlantic at different life stages. Otolith contour shape and microchemistry, fatty acids, carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes, as well as steroid hormones are proposed as promising alternative tools for responding to this challenge. © 2013 EDP Sciences, IFREMER, IRD.

In this study, lead-radium dating provided validated age estimates from juveniles to older adults, supporting the use of otoliths as accurate indicators of age. The oldest age groups were near 30 yr, which provided support for age estimates exceeding 40 or 50 yr from grow zone counts in otolith sections. Hence, scale reading, which rarely exceeds 20 years, {{has the potential for}} age underestimation. Lead-radium dating revealed what may be minor differences in age interpretation between two facilities and findings may provide an age-validated opportunity for the CCAMLR Otolith Network to reassess otolith interpretations. Orange roughy (Hoplostethus atlanticus) support a major <b>deep-sea</b> fishery and <b>stock</b> assessments often depend on age analyses, but lifespan estimates range from ~ 20 to over 100 yr and validation of growth zone counts remained unresolved. An early application of lead-radium dating supported centenarian ages, but the findings were met with disbelief and some studies have attempted to discredit the technique and the long lifespan. In this study, an improved lead-radium dating technique used smaller samples than previously possible and circumvented assumptions that were previously necessary. Lead-radium dating of otolith cores, {{the first few years of}} growth, provided ratios that correlated well with the ingrowth curve. This provided robust support for age estimates from otolith thin sections. Use of radiometric ages as independent age estimates indicated the fish in the oldest group were at least 93 yr. Lead-radium dating has validated a centenarian lifespan for orange roughy. To date, radium- 226 has been measured in otoliths of 39 fish species ranging from the northern Pacific and Atlantic Oceans to the Southern Ocean. In total, 367 reliable radium- 226 measurements were made in 36 studies since the first lead-radium dating study on fish in 1982. The activity of radium- 226 measurements ranged over 3 orders of magnitude (1. 0 dpm. g⁻¹). An analysis revealed ontogenetic differences in radium- 226 uptake that may be attributed to changes in habitat or diet. Radiometric age from otolith core studies was used to describe a radium- 226 uptake time-series for some species, which revealed interesting patterns over long periods. This synopsis provides information on the uptake of radium- 226 to otoliths from an environmental perspective, which can be used as a basis for future studies...|$|R
