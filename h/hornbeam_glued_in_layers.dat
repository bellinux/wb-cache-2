5000|$|When the tensile {{strength}} of a composite flywheel's outer binding cover is exceeded, the binding cover will fracture, followed by the wheel shattering as the outer wheel compression is lost around the entire circumference, releasing all of its stored energy at once; this is {{commonly referred to as}} [...] "flywheel explosion" [...] since wheel fragments can reach kinetic energy comparable to that of a bullet.

Charged polyelectrolytes are widely used as <b>glue</b> <b>in</b> <b>layer</b> by layer assembly, because they provide opposite charge between the solutions, thus avoiding an agglomerate form of coating.

40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} {{the results of}} a pressing diagram optimization based on changes in pressure, temperature and distance between frames of a continuous press during Oriented Strand Boards (OSB) pressing. Tests of selected mechanical properties were carried out on OSB/ 3 boards with a nominal thickness of 18 mm - a basic type with urea-formaldehyd (UF) <b>glue</b> <b>in</b> surface <b>layers</b> and isocyanate <b>glue</b> (PMDI) <b>in</b> the central <b>layer</b> and further an ECO type with PMDI <b>glue</b> <b>in</b> all <b>layers</b> produced by a prominent manufacturer of OSB boards in the Czech Republic. OSB/ 3 boards are intended for structural purposes for use in wet environments. Changes in the pressing diagram were carried out at the stage of “press opening”, which signifi cantly affects mechanical and physical properties of OSB boards. In {{order to be able to}} compare the effects of changes in the pressing curve, the same setting of production parameters was used with all tested boards. The results of laboratory tests were compared with the values given in the ČSN EN 300 Standard. Optimization of the pressing process ranks among the most effective measures to increase the quality of particle boards at zero or minimum costs. The control of production processes is increasingly perfect thanks to the development of electronics, control and computer technology. At present, not only in our country but also worldwide, marked development of wooden constructions occurs thanks to the development of new types of wood-based composite materials and to the development of technologies in building industry. OSB boards are an important representative of wood-based composite materials for wooden constructions. As compared to natural material, OSB boards show a homogenous structure not including natural defects typical of solid wood. From the point of view of physical and mechanical properties, OSB boards are of orthotropic character...|$|R
2500|$|In 1958 a major re-structuring of {{the support}} was done, aimed at {{reducing}} the presence of <b>glue</b> <b>in</b> several <b>layers</b> of canvas underneath the paint. [...] These layers were contracting, causing the paint to lift and flake. It was thought that there were four canvas layers, of which it was planned to remove three. However, as the work was carried out the [...] "alarming discovery" [...] was made that the layer nearest to the paint was actually not canvas but sheets of paper, badly decayed and partly separated from the ground to the paint. [...] The plan was changed to add layers of warm wax-resin in which an inert synthetic textile was fixed, before attaching to a composite board and paper honeycomb solid support. This method {{would be unlikely to}} be used today, but did stabilize the flaking. [...] By 2009 it was tending to flex when the painting is moved, so this is now avoided as far as possible.|$|R
5000|$|The linothorax (pronounced [...] ) {{is a type}} {{of upper}} body armor used by the ancient Greeks, as well as other Hellenic kingdoms {{including}} Macedonia, from the Mycenaean period through the Hellenistic period. The modern term linothorax is based on the Greek λινοθώραξ, which means [...] "wearing a breastplate of linen"; the actual ancient term for this type of armour is unclear. The term [...] "thorax" [...] was the word for breastplate during this era and was traditionally made of metal in most contexts. The [...] "linothorax" [...] were made of linen <b>glued</b> <b>in</b> <b>layers</b> with animal fat, and eventually adopted by many armies. The earliest attested account of a linothorax used for battle is recorded in Book 2 of Homer's Iliad (2.529 and 2.830). It is worn by Ajax the Lesser and is described in brief. Homer, composing stories long before the great armies of Athens, Thebes, Sparta and Macedon, surely understood what the armor was. However, {{the extent to which it}} was used can not be fully determined as the texts were not accurate accounts of specific time periods. An educated guess can be made, however, based on its use by Alexander the Great, and its mention by other sources such as Herodotus (2.182, 3.47, 7.63), Livy (4.19.2-20.7), Strabo (Geography, 3.3.6, 13.1.10), and many other minor sources. The linothorax appears to have been used in place of the bronze “bell cuirass” as the popular choice of armour for Greek hoplites, starting perhaps around the late seventh century and early sixth century B.C. This could have been due to the lower price, lesser weight, and cooler material. Its high point in vase paintings, sculptural reliefs and artistic depictions corresponds with the time of the Persian Wars. By the time of the Peloponnesian War it was still used, and continued to seemingly flourish well into the Hellenistic period.|$|R

30|$|The {{hypothesis}} {{of the use}} of animal <b>glue</b> <b>in</b> the preparatory <b>layers</b> and gum arabic in mixture {{with a small amount of}} another protein material to bind the paint layer is supported by the results of an investigation carried out on two Egyptian cartonnages, dated to the first century CE, in the Petrie Museum Collection [19]. Both cartonnages have a fine ground layer of pure calcite. ELISA (Enzyme Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay) analysis of the fine calcite layer from one of the cartonnages indicated the presence of animal glue, while the analysis of the paint layer gave a weak response for animal glue, a weak response for plant gum (possibly acacia gum) and a stronger response for egg white. This indicates that animal glue was used for the preparatory layer, while egg and plant gum were used as binders of the paint layer, which consisted of green earth [68]. Acacia gum mixed with a little protein material was also identified as paint binder in a cartonnage from a broad collar that has been radio-carbon dated to 512 - 351 BCE [11].|$|R

40|$|The use of <b>Glued</b> <b>In</b> Rod joints for wooden constructions is an {{efficient}} technology to connect and design members in new timber structures and to rehabilitate the damaged structural elements of historical buildings. The major issue concerning {{the use of}} adhesive anchors in timber {{is the lack of}} a standard regulation in the current Eurocode 5 for timber structures. Due to the gap in knowledge of this specific topic in engineering structural design, designers' choices are still supported by test analysis which enables knowledge, and the prediction, of the structural behaviour of <b>Glued</b> <b>In</b> Rod joints. Over the last 30 years, research studies have suggested diverse and contradictory procedures for the prediction of the withdrawal capacity of adhesive anchors in timber whose application led to the relay of inconsistent information about the use of <b>Glued</b> <b>In</b> Rods in the timber engineering field. The presented research work is aimed at clarifying the contradictory nature amongst existing design rules and at proposing a correct design procedure to assess the load bearing capacity of adhesive anchors in timber, whilst also taking into consideration the high product-dependency which <b>Glued</b> <b>In</b> Rod connections are characterised by. Moreover, the thesis investigates the development of new prototypes of resin connectors in timber through the identification of innovative technical solutions in order to achieve an improved structural performance of the studied adhesive joints. An extensive experimental program has been carried out on 'traditional' and new prototypes of adhesive anchors in timber, identified respectively by smooth-cylindrical and rough-threaded internal boreholes in which 8 mm steel rods have been glued by the use of low and high viscosity epoxy resins. The tensile performance of more than 100 samples of single adhesive anchors made from solid timber and glulam has been tested by pull-compression tests in confined test regimes, in both cold states and at elevated temperatures. Experimental findings suggest that in cold states and in restrictive manufacturing conditions, the adoption of the new prototype of <b>Glued</b> <b>In</b> Rods, characterised by the presence of a threaded and rough internal bonding surface, can simultaneously provide an increase of up to 12...|$|R
