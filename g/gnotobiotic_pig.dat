40|$|Purified axial {{filaments}} {{from eight}} serotypes of Treponema hyodysenteriae and two non-pathogenic intestinal spirochaetes {{were characterized by}} SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Axial filaments of all ten strains had similar SDS-PAGE profiles; five major axial filament polypeptides were identified, with molecular masses of 43. 8, 38, 34. 8, 32. 8 and 29. 4 kDa. Hyperimmune <b>gnotobiotic</b> <b>pig</b> serum raised against purified axial filaments of strain P 18 A (serotype 4) cross-reacted with all other serotypes and with the non-pathogens, and convalescent serum taken from a pig with persistent swine dysentery also showed a strong response to the axial filament polypeptides. Hyperimmune <b>gnotobiotic</b> <b>pig</b> serum raised against axial filaments failed to agglutinate viable organisms and did not inhibit growth in vitro.

40|$|The {{efficacy}} of oral tigecycline treatment (2 mg/kg {{of body weight}} for 7 days) of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) was evalu-ated in the <b>gnotobiotic</b> <b>pig</b> model, {{and its effect on}} human gut microflora transplanted into the <b>gnotobiotic</b> <b>pig</b> was determined. Tigecycline oral treatment improved survival, clinical signs, and lesion severity and markedly decreased concentrations of Firmi-cutes but did not promote CDI. Our data showed that oral tigecycline treatment has a potential beneficial effect on the treatment of CDI. Clostridium difficile is a major cause of antibiotic-associated di-arrhea worldwide. Currently, standard treatment for C. diffi-cile infection (CDI) includes one of several antibiotics such as metronidazole, vancomycin, or the newly developed fidaxomicin. These treatments are effective in the short term but are also asso-ciated with a recurrence rate of 15 % to 35 %, possibly due to dis-rupting the gut microbiome (1, 2). Therefore, new therapeutic agents are being investigated. One candidate is tigecycline, which is a broad-spectrum glycylcycline antibiotic with potent activity against C. difficile in vitro (3).

40|$|Animal {{models have}} been {{developed}} in which the role of Helicobacter pylori in the pathogenesis of different gastroduodenal diseases can be investigated. The <b>gnotobiotic</b> <b>pig</b> {{was one of the}} first animal models used. In this model, Helicobacter pylori infection causes gastritis, which shows some similarities to that in humans, such as the development of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT). Hence, this animal model can be used to study the development of MALT in the normal stomach. The aim of our study is to see if lymphoid tissue is present or absent in the normal stomach of gnotobiotic pigs before birth and if so, to investigate its development and composition as a function of gestational age and location in the stomach. Therefore, we studied 82 foetal piglets using routine histology and immunohistochemistry. Our findings show that lymphoid tissue is present at birth. It is composed of lymphoid nodules, a diffuse mononuclear infiltrate and intra-epithelial lymphocytes. The development is a sequential process. The lymphoid tissue in the stomach at birth is composed of the immunohistochemically different immunocompetent cells normally present.

40|$|Some {{characteristics}} of a newly recognized porcine enteric virus are described. Tentatively, the virus {{was referred to as}} porcine pararotavirus (PaRV) because it resembled rotaviruses in respect to size, morphology, and tropism for villous enterocytes of the small intestine. However, it was antigenically distinct from porcine, human, and bovine rotaviruses and reoviruses 1, 2, and 3, and the electrophoretic migration pattern of PaRV double-stranded RNA was distinct from the electrophoretic migration patterns of the rotaviral and reoviral genomes. By passage in <b>gnotobiotic</b> <b>pigs,</b> PaRV was isolated from two suckling diarrheic pigs originating from two herds. After oral exposure of <b>gnotobiotic</b> <b>pigs,</b> villous enterocytes of the small intestines became infected as judged by immunofluorescence, resulting in villous atrophy and diarrhea. Mortality was high when <b>gnotobiotic</b> <b>pigs</b> less than 5 days old were infected. The C strain of this virus was serially passed 10 times in <b>gnotobiotic</b> <b>pigs,</b> and electron microscopy, immunofluorescence, and serological tests indicated no extraneous agents. The virus was serially passed five times in cell cultures which contained pancreatin in the medium, but replication was negligible or absent, as the number of immunofluorescent cells decreased with each passage. Since rotaviral infections are frequently diagnosed by direct electron microscopy of fecal specimens, the presence of other morphologically similar viruses, such as PaRV, should be considered. The use of immune electron microscopy is suggested as a means of helping recognize this situation...|$|R

The clinical state of experimental animals correlated with bacterial translocation {{and levels of}} inflammatory cytokines [a chemokine, interleukin (IL) - 8, a proinflammatory cytokine, tumour necrosis factor (TNF) -α and an anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL- 10] in plasma and intestinal lavages. <b>Gnotobiotic</b> <b>pigs</b> orally mono-associated with either PR 4 or EcN thrived, and bacteria were not found in their blood.

Apparent gastrointestinal absorption of DL-methionine (MET) and 2 -hydroxy- 4 -methylthiobutanoic acid (MHA-FA), post-weaning intestinal morphology, digestive physiology, mucin dynamics and digesta flow were studied in a series of experiments using conventional and <b>gnotobiotic</b> <b>pigs.</b> At 14 d of age, sow - reared conventional (CON) pigs and isolator - reared monoassociated <b>gnotobiotic</b> <b>pigs</b> (EF) were weaned to corn or wheat/barley based diets supplemented with MET or MHA-FA. At 24 d of age, after an overnight fast, pigs were fed experimental diet supplemented with 107 Bq of either 3 H-L-MET or 3 H-L-MHA-FA per kg of feed and chromic oxide (0. 5 % wt/wt). Pigs were killed 3 h after consuming the meal to collect digesta and tissue samples from the stomach and along the small intestinal (SI) length.

The objective {{of this study was to}} search for aberrant bodies in intestinal tissues from pigs, describe their ultrastructure, and investigate the suitability of immunohistochemical staining for chlamydial heat shock protein 60 (cHSP 60) to detect such forms. Intestinal tissues derived from pigs naturally and experimentally infected with Chlamydia (C.) suis were examined by immunohistochemistry, transmission electron microscopy and immunogold electron microscopy. The chlamydial species involved in the natural infection were determined using an Array Tube Microarray to C. suis and Chlamydophila abortus. Ultrastructurally, aberrant bodies were detected in the gut of both naturally and experimentally infected pigs. Immunogold electron microscopy showed that the aberrant bodies were labeled less strongly than the normal forms by antibodies against LPS and cHSP 60 respectively. It was concluded that aberrant bodies occur in vivo in pigs and that the <b>gnotobiotic</b> <b>pig</b> model might be suitable for the study of chlamydial persistence in vivo.

40|$|Abstract. An {{immunohistochemistry}} {{technique was}} developed using fixed tissues {{to study the}} presence and location of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) antigens in situ. Experimentally infected gnotobiotic and conventional pigs as well as pigs with natural TGEV infection were examined. The staining technique was based on detection of the major structural protein of TGEV, the nucleocapsid, by using a pool of 3 monoclonal antibodies. Formalin and periodate-lysine-paraformaldehyde (PLP) -fixed intestinal tissues from a <b>gnotobiotic</b> <b>pig</b> inoculated with virulent TGEV {{were used to determine}} optimal antibody concentrations and incubation times. The intestinal tissues remained in their respective fixatives for 6 months, and serial sections were removed at sequential times and embedded in paraffin blocks. PLP and 10 % neutral buffered formalin were acceptable fixatives and preserved TGEV nucleocapsid antigenicity for up to 6 months. Formalin, in comparison with PLP as a fixative, was better for preserving original tissue morphology and provided better antigen detection. Con-ventional crossbred pigs were inoculated with virulent TGEV, and animals were euthanized on various postex-posure days. Intestinal tissues were positive for TGEV nucleocapsid antigens on postexposure days 2, 4, and 8. The immunohistochemistry technique detected TGEV antigen in stored paraffin-embedded tissues from 14 naturally infected pigs previously confirmed as positive for TGEV using a direct immunofluorescence assay on intestinal mucosal smears, whereas 9 naturally infected pigs confirmed negative for TGEV antigen by the sam...|$|E
40|$|Maximising {{the ability}} of piglets to survive {{exposure}} to pathogens is essential to reduce early piglet mortality, {{an important factor in}} efficient commercial pig production. Mortality rates can be influenced by many factors, including early colonization by microbial commensals. Here we describe the development of an intestinal microbiota, the Bristol microbiota, for use in gnotobiotic pigs and its influence on synthesis of systemic immunoglobulins. Such a microbiota will be of value in studies of the consequences of early microbial colonization on development of the intestinal immune system and subsequent susceptibility to disease. <b>Gnotobiotic</b> <b>pig</b> studies lack a well-established intestinal microbiota. The use of the Altered Schaedler Flora (ASF), a murine intestinal microbiota, to colonize the intestines of Caesarean-derived, gnotobiotic pigs prior to gut closure, resulted in unreliable colonization with most (but not all) strains of the ASF. Subsequently, a novel, simpler porcine microbiota was developed. The novel microbiota reliably colonized the length of the intestinal tract when administered to gnotobiotic piglets. No health problems were observed, and the novel microbiota induced a systemic increase in serum immunoglobulins, in particular IgA and IgM. The Bristol microbiota will be of value for highly controlled, reproducible experiments of the consequences of early microbial colonization on susceptibility to disease in neonatal piglets, and as a biomedical model for the impact of microbial colonization on development of the intestinal mucosa and immune system in neonates...|$|E

40|$|The {{consensus}} {{nucleotide sequence}} {{of a human}} rotavirus Wa strain, with only a partially known passage history, was determined with sequence-independent amplification and next generation 454 pyrosequencing. This rotavirus Wa strain had the expected genome constellation of G 1 -P[8]-I 1 -R 1 -C 1 -M 1 - A 1 -N 1 -T 1 -E 1 -H 1 and was designated RVA/Human-tc/USA/WaCS/ 1974 /G 1 P[8]. Phylogenetic analyses revealed a close relationship to four human rotavirus Wa variants (Wag 5 re, Wag 7 / 8 re, ParWa and VirWa) derived from the original 1974 human isolate. There were rearrangements in the Wag 5 re- and Wag 7 / 8 re variants in genome segments 5 (Wag 5 re) and 7 and 8 (Wag 7 / 8 re), which were not present in WaCS. Pairwise comparisons and a combined molecular clock for the Wa rotavirus genome indicated a close relationship between WaCS and ParWa and VirWa. These results suggest that WaCS is most probably an early cell culture adapted variant from the initial <b>gnotobiotic</b> <b>pig</b> passaged Wa isolate. Evolutionary pressure analysis identified a possible negative selected amino acid site in VP 1 (genome segment 1) and a likely positive selected site in VP 4 (genome segment 4).

40|$|The {{structure}} and infectivity of the oocysts {{of a new}} species of Cryptosporidium from the feces of humans are described. Oocysts are structurally indistinguishable from those of Cryptosporidium parvum. Oocysts of the new species are passed fully sporulated, lack sporocysts, and measure 4. 4 - 5. 4 μm (mean = 4. 86) × 4. 4 - 5. 9 μm (mean = 5. 2 μm) with a length to width ratio 1. 0 - 1. 09 (mean 1. 07) (n = 100). Oocysts were not infectious for ARC Swiss mice, nude mice, Wistar rat pups, puppies, kittens or calves, but were infectious to neonatal gnotobiotic pigs.

40|$|Abstract Background In a {{previous}} study, it was demonstrated that high replication of Porcine circovirus 2 (PCV 2) in a <b>gnotobiotic</b> <b>pig</b> {{was correlated with}} the absence of PCV 2 -neutralizing antibodies. The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate if this correlation could also be found in SPF pigs in which PMWS was experimentally reproduced and in naturally PMWS-affected pigs. Results When looking at the total anti-PCV 2 antibody titres, PMWS-affected and healthy animals seroconverted at the same time point, and titres in PMWS-affected animals were only slightly lower compared to those in healthy animals. In healthy animals, the evolution of PCV 2 -neutralizing antibodies coincided with that of total antibodies. In PMWS-affected animals, neutralizing antibodies could either not be found (sera from field studies) or were detected in low titres between 7 and 14 DPI only (sera from experimentally inoculated SPF pigs). Differences were also found in the evolution of specific antibody isotypes titres against PCV 2. In healthy pigs, IgM antibodies persisted until the end of the study, whereas in PMWS-affected pigs they quickly decreased or remained present at low titres. The mean titres of other antibody isotypes (IgG 1, IgG 2 and IgA), were slightly lower in PMWS-affected pigs compared to their healthy group mates at the end of each study. Conclusion This study describes important differences in the development of the humoral immune response between pigs that get subclinically infected with PCV 2 and pigs that experience a high level of PCV 2 -replication which in 3 of 4 experiments led to the development of PMWS. These observations may contribute to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of a PCV 2 -infection. </p...|$|E

A third small spherical 23 -nm virus-like particle was also observed. Calicivirus-like particles averaged 33 nm in diameter. Similar to rotaviruses, rotavirus-like particles were present as single-capsid 55 -nm forms or double-capsid 70 -nm particles. Most <b>gnotobiotic</b> <b>pigs</b> orally exposed to samples containing these three viruses developed diarrhea and villous atrophy of the small intestine, and all shed the three viruses in their intestinal contents. Attempts to propagate these viruses in cell culture were unsuccessful. The antigenic relationship of the rotavirus-like particles to known rotaviruses was explored by immune EM and immunofluorescent staining. By these techniques, the rotavirus-like particles did not cross-react with antisera to porcine, bovine, or human rotaviruses or to reovirus type 3. Antisera from <b>gnotobiotic</b> <b>pigs</b> exposed to all three viruses had enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and virus neutralization titers of < 4 against porcine rotavirus.

In this study, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) and Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) were first screened {{for their ability to}} bind HuNoV P particles and virions derived from clinical samples containing HuNoV genotype GII. 3 and GII. 4, then the effects of LGG+EcN and rice bran on HuNoV infection and diarrhea were investigated using the <b>gnotobiotic</b> <b>pig</b> model. While LGG+EcN colonization inhibited HuNoV shedding, probiotic cocktail regimens in which rice bran feeding started 7 days prior to or 1 day after viral inoculation in the LGG+EcN colonized gnotobiotic pigs exhibited high protection against HuNoV diarrhea and shedding, characterized by significantly reduced incidence (89 % versus 20 %) and shorter mean duration of diarrhea (2. 2 versus 0. 2 days), as well as shorter mean duration of virus shedding (3. 2 versus 1. 0 days). In both probiotic cocktail groups, the diarrhea reduction rates were 78 % compared with the control group, and diarrhea severity was reduced as demonstrated by the significantly lower cumulative fecal scores. The high protective efficacy of the probiotic cocktail regimens was attributed to stimulation of IFN-γ+ T cell responses, increased production of intestinal IgA and IgG, and maintenance of healthy intestinal morphology (manifested as longer villi compared with the control group). Therefore, probiotic cocktail regimens containing LGG+EcN and rice bran may represent highly efficacious strategies to prevent and treat HuNoV gastroenteritis, and potentially other human enteric pathogens...|$|E

The isotypes, quantities and tissue distribution of rotavirus-specific memory B cells and ASC were evaluated prechallenge (28 and 83 postinoculation days [PID]) and postchallenge (7 postchallenge days [PCD]), using enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay, in gnotobiotic pigs inoculated once with virulent or three times with attenuated HRV and challenged at PID 28 with the corresponding virulent HRV. Complete protection against HRV shedding and diarrhoea was associated with significantly higher numbers of immunoglobulin A (IgA) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) memory B cells and ASC in the ileum of virulent HRV-inoculated pigs at challenge. In contrast, pigs inoculated with attenuated HRV had lower numbers of IgA and IgG memory B cells and ASC in intestinal lymphoid tissues, but higher numbers in the spleen. The bone marrow had the lowest mean numbers of IgA and IgG memory B cells and ASC prechallenge in both groups of HRV-inoculated pigs. Therefore, bone marrow was not a site for IgA and IgG rotavirus-specific antibody production or for memory B cells after inoculation with live rotavirus, from 28 PID up to at least 83 PID.

Comparisons of delivery routes for AttHRV and evaluation of nonreplicating VLP vaccines are important as alternative vaccine approaches to overcome risks associated with live oral vaccines. Groups of neonatal gnotobiotic pigs were vaccinated using combinations of oral (PO) and intranasal (IN) inoculation routes as follows: (i) 3 oral doses of AttHRV (AttHRV 3 ×PO); (ii) AttHRV 3 ×IN; (iii) AttHRVPO, then 2 / 6 VLP 2 ×IN; (iv) AttHRVIN, then 2 / 6 VLP 2 ×IN; and (v) mock-inoculated controls. Subsets of pigs from each group were challenged with virulent Wa HRV [P 1 A(8) G 1] (4 weeks post-primary inoculation) to assess protection. The AttHRVPO+ 2 / 6 VLP 2 ×IN pigs had the highest protection rates against virus shedding and diarrhea (71 % each); however, these rates did not differ statistically among the vaccine groups, except for the AttHRVIN+ 2 / 6 VLPIN group, which had a significantly lower protection rate (17 %) against diarrhea. The isotype, magnitude, and tissue distribution of ASCs were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunospot assay. The highest mean numbers of virus-specific IgG and IgA ASCs were observed pre- and postchallenge in both intestinal and systemic lymphoid tissues of the AttHRVPO+ 2 / 6 VLPIN group. Thus, the AttHRVPO+ 2 / 6 VLPIN vaccine regimen using immunostimulating complexes (ISCOM) and multiple mucosal inductive sites, followed by AttHRV 3 ×PO or IN regimens, were the most effective vaccine regimens, suggesting that either AttHRVPO+ 2 / 6 VLPIN or AttHRV 3 ×IN may be an alternative approach to AttHRV 3 ×PO for inducing protective immunity against rotavirus diarrhea...|$|E

Four age-matched gnotobiotic piglets were anesthetized and sham infected with uninfected cell culture lysates. None of the principal piglets developed clinical symptoms of conjunctivitis or keratoconjunctivitis. Principal piglets necropsied 7 days postinfection (DPI) had histologic lesions of mild or moderate conjunctivitis; immunohistochemical evaluation revealed chlamydial antigen in conjunctival epithelium. A majority of principal piglets necropsied at 14 – 28 DPI had histologic lesions of mild conjunctivitis, but chlamydial antigen was not detected by immunohistochemistry. The results indicated that chlamydial strain H 7 can cause mild or occasionally moderate conjunctivitis in <b>gnotobiotic</b> <b>pigs,</b> but the conjunctival infection is asymptomatic...|$|R
40|$|Twelve {{intestinal}} spirochete {{strains of}} porcine origin were characterized {{on the basis}} of their phenotypic properties, by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis, and by pathogenicity testing in <b>gnotobiotic</b> <b>pigs.</b> The spirochetes used included two strains of Serpulina hyodysenteriae (B 204 and P 18 A), two strains of Serpulina innocens (B 256 and 4 / 71), one strain from the proposed new genus and species "Anguillina coli" (P 43 / 6 / 78), and seven non-S. hyodysenteriae strains recently isolated from United Kingdom pig herds with a history of nonspecific diarrhea and typhlocolitis. By multilocus enzyme electrophoresis, five of these were identified as S. innocens, one was identified as an unspecified Serpulina sp., and one was identified as "A. coli. " S. hyodysenteriae B 204 and P 18 A, "A. coli" P 43 / 6 / 78 and 2 / 7, and three (22 / 7, P 280 / 1, and 14 / 5) of the five S. innocens field isolates induced mucoid feces and typhlocolitis in <b>gnotobiotic</b> <b>pigs.</b> None of the other spirochetes produced clinical signs or large intestinal pathology in this model. The "A. coli" strains induced a more watery diarrhea, with lesions present more proximally in the large intestine, than did the other pathogenic spirochetes. S. innocens 22 / 7 was also tested for pathogenicity in hysterotomy-derived pigs that had previously been artificially colonized with a spirochete-free intestinal flora and shown to be susceptible to swine dysentery. Despite effective colonization, strain 22 / 7 did not produce any disease, nor was there any exacerbation of large intestinal pathology or clinical signs when pigs with an experimentally induced existing colitis caused by Yersinia pseudotuberculosis were superinfected with strain 22 / 7. Certain non-S. hyodysenteriae spirochetes are therefore capable of inducing disease in <b>gnotobiotic</b> <b>pigs,</b> but their role as primary or opportunistic pathogens in conventional pigs remains equivocal...|$|R
40|$|Intimin, {{the product}} of the eaeA gene in enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 (EHEC), is {{required}} for intimate adherence of these organisms to tissue culture cells and formation of the attaching and effacing lesion in the <b>gnotobiotic</b> <b>pig.</b> Because of the importance of intimin in the pathogenesis of EHEC O 157 :H 7 infection in this animal model, we began a structure-function analysis of EaeA. For this purpose, we constructed amino-terminal fusions of the intimin protein with six histidine residues to form two independent fusions. The longer fusion, RIHisEae, contained 900 of the 935 predicted amino acids and included all but the extreme amino terminus. The second fusion, RVHdHisEae, consisted of the carboxyl two-thirds of the protein. Purified extracts of either construct enhanced binding of wild-type 86 - 24 to HEp- 2 cells and conferred HEp- 2 cell adherence on 86 - 24 eaeDelta 10, an eaeA deletion mutant, and B 2 F 1, an EHEC O 91 : 1 - 121 eaeA mutant strain. When 86 - 24 eaeDelta 10 was transformed with either of the plasmids encoding the intimin fusion proteins, the transformant behaved like the wild-type parent strain and displayed localized adherence to HEp- 2 cells, with positive fluorescent-actin staining. In addition, polyclonal antisera raised against RIHisEae reacted with both fusion constructs and recognized an outer membrane protein of the same mass as intimin (97 kDa) in EHEC and enteropathogenic E. coli but not E. coli K- 12. The intimin-specific antisera also blocked adherence of EHEC to HEp- 2 cells. Thus, intimin (i) is a 97 -kDa outer membrane protein in EHEC that serves as a requisite adhesin for attachment of the bacteria to epithelial cells, even when the protein is truncated by one-third at its amino terminus and (ii) can be added exogenously to specifically facilitate HEp- 2 cell adherence of EHEC but not E. coli K- 12...|$|E
40|$|Safer {{and more}} {{effective}} human rotavirus (HRV) vaccines are needed. We evaluated oral priming with attenuated WaHRV (AttHRV) followed by boosting with two intranasal (IN) doses of VP 2 / 6 virus-like particles (2 / 6 VLP) with immunostimulating complexes (ISCOM) to determine if this regimen induces protection against diarrhoea and viral shedding in the <b>gnotobiotic</b> <b>pig</b> model. IgM, IgA and IgG antibody titres in serum and intestinal contents were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and serum neutralizing antibody titres were measured by a virus neutralization (VN) test. Seven groups of neonatal gnotobiotic pigs were vaccinated at post-inoculation days (PID) 0, 10 and 21 and challenged with virulent WaHRV at PID 28. The vaccine groups included: (1, 2) oral priming with AttHRV and boosting with two IN immunizations with 2 / 6 VLP–ISCOM (Att + 2 / 6 VLP–ISCOM) at VLP concentrations of 250 µg or 25 µg; (3, 4) three IN immunizations with 2 / 6 VLP–ISCOM at VLP concentrations of 250 µg or 25 µg (2 / 6 VLP–ISCOM); (5) three oral immunizations with AttHRV (3 ×AttHRV); (6) one oral immunization with AttHRV (1 ×AttHRV); (7) controls (ISCOM matrix and/or diluent). The pigs that received 3 ×AttHRV or Att + 2 / 6 VLP 250 –ISCOM had the highest protection rates against diarrhoea upon challenge at PID 28 with virulent WaHRV. The IgA antibody titres to HRV in intestinal contents were significantly higher in the Att + 2 / 6 VLP 250 –ISCOM group than in all other groups prechallenge (PID 28). Serum VN antibody titres were statistically similar after the first inoculation among the groups given AttHRV, but at PID 28 VN antibody titres were significantly higher for the 3 ×AttHRV and Att + 2 / 6 VLP 250 –ISCOM groups than for the 1 ×AttHRV group suggesting that boosting with 2 / 6 VLP also boosted VN antibody responses. In humans, intestinal IgA antibodies have been correlated with protection against symptomatic reinfection. Thus the vaccine regimen of one oral dose of AttHRV and two IN immunizations with 2 / 6 VLP 250 –ISCOM may be an alternative to multiple-dose live oral vaccines in humans...|$|E
40|$|Two {{combined}} rotavirus vaccination regimens {{were evaluated}} in a <b>gnotobiotic</b> <b>pig</b> model of rotavirus infection and disease and {{were compared to}} previously tested rotavirus vaccination regimens. The first (AttHRV/VLP 2 ×) involved oral inoculation with one dose of attenuated (Att) Wa human rotavirus (HRV), followed by two intranasal (i. n.) doses of a rotavirus-like particle (2 / 6 -VLPs) vaccine derived from Wa (VP 6) and bovine RF (VP 2) rotavirus strains. The 2 / 6 -VLPs were coadministered with a mutant Escherichia coli heat-labile toxin, LT-R 192 G (mLT) adjuvant. For the second regimen (VLP 2 ×/AttHRV), two i. n. doses of 2 / 6 -VLPs+mLT were given, followed by one oral dose of attenuated Wa HRV. To compare the protective efficacy and immune responses induced by the combined vaccine regimens with individual rotavirus vaccine regimens, we included in the experiments the following vaccine groups: one oral dose of attenuated Wa HRV (AttHRV 1 × and Mock 2 ×/AttHRV, respectively), three oral doses of attenuated Wa HRV (AttHRV 3 ×), three i. n. doses of 2 / 6 -VLPs plus mLT (VLP 3 ×), three i. n. doses of purified double-layered inactivated Wa HRV plus mLT (InactHRV 3 ×), mLT alone, and mock-inoculated pigs. The isotype, magnitude, and tissue distribution of antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) in the intestinal and systemic lymphoid tissues were evaluated using an enzyme-linked immunospot assay. The AttHRV/VLP 2 × regimen stimulated the highest mean numbers of intestinal immunoglobulin A (IgA) ASCs prechallenge among all vaccine groups. This regimen induced partial protection against virus shedding (58 %) and diarrhea (44 %) upon challenge of pigs with virulent Wa HRV. The reverse VLP 2 ×/AttHRV regimen was less efficacious than the AttHRV/VLP 2 × regimen in inducing IgA ASC responses and protection against diarrhea (25 % protection rate) but was more efficacious than VLP 3 × or InactHRV 3 × (no protection). In conclusion, the AttHRV/VLP 2 × vaccination regimen stimulated the strongest B-cell responses in the intestinal mucosal immune system at challenge and conferred a moderately high protection rate against rotavirus disease, indicating that priming of the mucosal inductive site at the portal of natural infection with a replicating vaccine, followed by boosting with a nonreplicating vaccine at a second mucosal inductive site, may be a highly effective approach to stimulate the mucosal immune system and induce protective immunity against various mucosal pathogens...|$|E
40|$|Seven {{rotavirus}} strains {{were isolated}} in cell cultures from the intestinal contents of piglets with diarrhea. MA 104 cells with pancreatin {{in the cell}} culture medium was the host system of choice for virus isolation and replication. A cell culture immunofluorescence test in which MA 104 cells were used in microtiter plates was very effective for detecting and assaying rotaviruses. A plaque reduction neutralization test, cross-protection studies in <b>gnotobiotic</b> <b>pigs,</b> and electrophoresis of rotaviral double-stranded RNA were used for comparing viruses. Three strains produced plaques on initial isolation attempts, replicated well in cell cultures, and were antigenically very similar. We suggest that these three strains be considered porcine rotavirus serotype 1, with The Ohio State University (OSU) strain serving as the prototype. The OSU strain was distinct from bovine, simian, canine, and human (Wa and M) rotaviruses by plaque reduction neutralization. Four strains did not produce plaques on initial isolation attempts, were difficult to adapt to cell cultures, and were {{related to each other}} but were distinct from the serotype 1 strains. We suggest that the Gottfried (G) strain be tentatively considered as a prototype for porcine rotavirus serotype 2. The G strain was antigenically closely related to canine and simian rotaviruses and less so to human M rotavirus (human rotavirus serotype 3). Canine, simian, and human M rotaviruses were closely related. All seven porcine rotavirus strains caused diarrhea in <b>gnotobiotic</b> <b>pigs.</b> Cell-cultured vaccines of the OSU and G strains caused only mild or no diarrhea in <b>gnotobiotic</b> <b>pigs,</b> and protection occurred when such pigs were challenged with homologous, bur not heterologous, virulent viruses. A survey indicated that 94 % of 274 porcine serum samples and 100 % of 75 herds were serologically positive to the porcine OSU rotavirus...|$|R
40|$|Respiratory {{symptoms}} with rotavirus shedding in nasopharyngeal secretions {{have been}} reported in children with and without gastrointestinal symptoms (Zheng et al., 1991, J. Med. Virol. 34 : 29 - 37). To investigate if attenuated and virulent human rotavirus (HRV) strains cause upper respiratory tract infections or viremia in <b>gnotobiotic</b> <b>pigs,</b> we inoculated them with attenuated or virulent HRV intranasally, intravenously, or orally or via feeding tube (gavage) and assayed virus shedding. After oral or intranasal inoculation with attenuated HRV, the pigs remained asymptomatic, but 79 to 95 % shed virus nasally and 5 to 17 % shed virus rectally. After inoculation by gavage, no pigs shed virus nasally or rectally, but all pigs seroconverted with antibodies to HRV. No viremia was detected through postinoculation day 10. Controls inoculated intranasally with nonreplicating rotavirus-like particles or mock inoculated did not shed virus. In contrast, 100 % of pigs inoculated with virulent HRV (oral, intranasal, or gavage) developed diarrhea, shed virus nasally and rectally, and had viremia. The infectivity of sera from the viremic virulent HRV-inoculated pigs was confirmed by inoculating <b>gnotobiotic</b> <b>pigs</b> orally with pooled HRV-positive serum. Serum-inoculated pigs developed diarrhea and fecal and nasal virus shedding and seroconverted with serum and intestinal HRV antibodies. Pigs inoculated intravenously with serum or intestinal contents from the viremic virulent HRV-inoculated pigs developed diarrhea, virus shedding, and viremia, similar to the orally inoculated pigs. This study provides new evidence that virulent HRV causes transient viremia and upper respiratory tract infection in addition to gastrointestinal infection in <b>gnotobiotic</b> <b>pigs,</b> confirming previous reports of rotavirus antigenemia (Blutt et al., Lancet 362 : 1445 - 1449, 2003). Our data also suggest that intestinal infection might be initiated from the basolateral side of the epithelial cells via viremia. Additionally, virus shedding patterns indicate a different pathogenesis for attenuated versus virulent HRV...|$|R
