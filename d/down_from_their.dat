5|$|Bats are {{adapted to}} roosting, hanging upside <b>down</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> feet. The femurs are {{attached}} at the hips {{in a way}} that allows them to bend outward and upward in flight. The ankle joint can flex so as to allow the trailing edge of the wings to bend downwards. However, this design does not permit many movements other than hanging or clambering up trees. Most megabats roost with the head tucked towards the belly, whereas most microbats roost with the neck curled towards the back. This difference is reflected {{in the structure of the}} cervical vertebrae in the two groups, which are clearly distinct. Tendons allow bats to lock their feet closed when hanging from a roost. Muscular power is needed to let go, but not to grasp a perch or when holding on.|$|E

5|$|Trogloraptor spin simple webs {{with only}} a few strands, hung from the roofs of caves. Griswold et al. stated that the claws may have a {{significant}} function in capturing prey. Similar to the Nelson cave spider of New Zealand (Spelungula cavernicola, a gradungulid), Trogloraptor probably dangle upside <b>down</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> webs, snatching at passing flying insects with their claws. However their exact prey remains unknown. Captured live specimens were raised in climate-controlled laboratory conditions in an effort to find out. These specimens were offered moths, crickets and other spiders as food; but these were declined and the specimens starved after two weeks. This may indicate a preference for very specific prey.|$|E

According to Stockert, an examination of U.S. records by Mr. Hirst indicates that Lützow's Me262 crashed near Schrobenhausen. The USAAF flew three attacks against the oil terminals at Schrobenhausen, south of Neuburg an der Donau, that day. On their second mission, 22 B-26 bombers escorted by 16 Republic P-47 Thunderbolt fighter aircraft, were just beginning their bomb run at 3:25pm, when they came under attack by four Me262s. Two P-47s came diving <b>down</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> top cover position {{to fend off the}} attacking jets. In this account, one Me262 pilot noticed {{that he was about to}} come under attack and attempted to dive away.

40|$|Previous {{research}} has focused on equity as a prime determinant of mortgage default propensities. This paper extends the analysis of mortgage default to include mortgages that require no <b>down</b> payment <b>from</b> the purchaser. A continuous time hazard model is used to estimate the conditional probability of a serious delinquency, or a claim, as a function of a host of standard control variables, and indicators for the presence and source of the down payment. The data consist of a nationally representative random sample of about 5, 000 FHA insured single family mortgages endorsed in Fiscal Years 2000, 2001, and 2002, observed through September 30, 2006, and samples of about 1, 000 FHA loans each from the Atlanta, Indianapolis, and Salt Lake City MSAs in the same time period. The results indicate that borrowers who provide <b>down</b> payments <b>from</b> <b>their</b> own resources have significantly lower default propensities than do borrowers whose <b>down</b> payments come <b>from</b> relatives, government agencies, or non-profits. Borrowers with <b>down</b> payments <b>from</b> seller-funded non-profits, who make no down payment at all, have the highest default rates. Additionally, borrowers who do not make <b>down</b> payments <b>from</b> <b>their</b> own resources tend to have higher loss given default in the small subset of loans that had completed the property disposition process. ...|$|R
