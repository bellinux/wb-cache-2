40|$|Afterpulsing {{and optical}} {{crosstalk}} are significant performance limitations for applications employing near-infrared single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs). In this paper, we describe an InGaAs/InP SPAD with monolithically <b>integrated</b> <b>resistor</b> that is fully {{compatible with the}} planar fabrication process and provides a significant reduction of the avalanche charge and, thus, of afterpulsing and optical crosstalk. In {{order to have a}} fast SPAD reset (< 50 ns), we fabricated quenching resistors ranging from 10 to 200 k, smaller than what is available in the literature. The resistor, fabricated with the zinc diffusions already used for avoiding premature edge-breakdown, promptly reduces the avalanche current to a low value ∼ 100 μ A in less than 1 ns, while an active circuit completes the quenching and enforces a well-defined hold-off. The proposed mixed-quenching approach guarantees an avalanche charge reduction of more than 20 times compared with similar plain SPADs, enough to reduce the hold-off time down to 1 μ s. Finally, a compact single-photon counting module based on this detector and featuring 70 -ps photon-timing jitter is presented...|$|E

The {{technique is}} based upon generating test structures in the process of interest, performing measurements, and extracting the behavior of a few key well identified building blocks. These building blocks can then be used for generating circuit models of other any structure created by valid combinations of those building blocks, which can then be simulated in a standard circuit simulator to predict behavior. The procedure has been experimentally verified, and shows good agreement with actual measurements up to 5 – 10 GHz. In addition, the model validity has been tested in several circuits by comparing the model predicted results against results obtained using the HP MDS simulator which uses measured parameters directly, with very good results. Since lumped element circuits are generated by this method, structure prediction speed is determined by circuit size and simulator small signal analysis time. The method is versatile and is well suited for circuit design applications.

40|$|Standard linear optical {{detectors}} have {{a maximum}} sensitivity {{in the few}} hundreds of photons range, limited by amplifier noise. On the other hand, single photon detectors, which are the most sensitive detectors, are strongly nonlinear: One or more photons result in the same output signal. Photon number resolving (PNR) detectors, which {{have the ability to}} discriminate the number of photons in a weak optical pulse, are of great importance in the field of quantum information processing and quantum cryptography. Moreover, a PNR detector with large dynamic range can cover the gap between these two detection modes. Such detectors are greatly desirable not only in quantum information science and technology, but also in any application dealing with low light levels. In this work, we propose a novel approach to photon number resolving detectors based on spatial multiplexing of nanowire superconducting single-photon detectors. In the proposed approach, N superconducting nanowires, each connected in parallel to an <b>integrated</b> <b>resistor,</b> are connected in series. Photon absorption in a nanowire switches its bias current to the parallel resistor, forming a voltage pulse across it. The sum of these voltages, proportional to the number of absorbed photons, is measured at the output. The use of a cryogenic preamplifier with high input impedance for the read-out increases the linearity, the signal to noise ratio, and the speed. With this combination, we expect to be able to count up to few tens of photons with high fidelity, excellent timing resolution, and very high sensitivity in the telecommunication wavelength range...|$|E

40|$|There {{are several}} {{important}} semiconductor devices {{in which the}} transport of carriers is controlled by punch-through space-charge effects. Examples include the Bipolar Mode Static Induction Transistor (BSIT), ultrasmall Punch-through MOSFETs, and BARITT diodes for microwave applications. The development of punch-through space-charge type of devices is a technology motivated by the demanding high density among the IC chips. This dissertation discusses a device which operates in a punch-through condition with space-charge control of currents. It is a two terminal device, which could be fabricated with no deviation from today's technology. The device structure is simple, with two n⁺ or p⁺ regions formed in p⁻ or n⁻ substrate, respectively. Punch-through space-charge limited structures both n⁺p⁻n⁺ and p⁺n⁻p⁺, were simulated using a general one-dimensional semiconductor device performance simulation program GESIM 1 for dynamic and static analysis. The results of simulation show that the potential barrier height decreases with increasing applied potential and with a reduction of the spacing L between the n⁺ diffusion in an n⁺p⁻n⁺ structure. The resistance increases as the spacing L is increased. A two-dimensional analytical model of carrier transport in the device was developed. This model accounts for surface effects {{as well as the}} space-charge limited flow. Also, a one-dimensional model that includes mobile carriers effects on the device operation. Structures of various configurations were fabricated and tested. Electrical evaluations of these structures provided large value resistors in a remarkably small area compare to traditional <b>integrated</b> <b>resistors.</b> The resistance was observed to increase with the spacing L and with the resistivity of the starting substrate.

40|$|Introduction In the {{realisation}} of discrete-component analogue {{electronic circuits}} {{it is common}} practice, because of costs, to specify passive component values from a set preferred of values.

For example, to obtain accurate ratio matching of <b>integrated</b> <b>resistors</b> and capacitors by stacking identical unit valued components [1]. The usual design approaches produce circuits in which the permitted component values are assumed to be unrestricted. The circuit is then converted to a practical circuit by simple rounding of the exact component values to the nearest value in the permitted set. Of course, in general the circuit performance realised will differ from the ideal. It may then be necessary to repeat the design with a more stringent specification or to use a more closely spaced set of permitted values, both of which can have cost implications.

40|$|Over {{the past}} decades, the {{electrical}} and functional performances of neuro-stimulators (stimulators) {{have been shown}} to successfully restore impaired function to individuals, such as a cochlea implant for the deaf and vision prosthesis for the blind. Along with this success, ensuring safe operation of stimulators for a long term period {{is one of the major}} concerns. Safety, in terms of stimulators' electrical performances, can be related mainly to two factors; the zero-net charge transfer (perfect charge balance) to tissue and the heat generated by power dissipation at a stimulating tissue and by electronics. Therefore, for a safe neural stimulation, stimulators are required to maintain perfect charge balance and minimize power consumption during neural stimulation. This thesis presents the development of the implantable stimulating circuitry (using HV CMOS process), which includes a stimulator and a high gain current mirror amplifier. The emphasis was given to develop a stimulator, featured in precise charge balancing capability and low power consumption, for vision prosthesis, specifically, a retinal implant. Employing a dynamic current mirror at the output of a stimulator achieves precise charge balance without dedicating large area, as the charge imbalance in current mode stimulation is mainly contributed by the effect of CMOS process variation and mismatch on the current source and sink drivers at the output of a stimulator. With this scheme, charge imbalance of less than 100 pC was measured, when delivering 100 nC to the tissue with a full scale current of approximately 1 mA. This is equivalent to less than 0. 1 % error, sufficient to ensure safety during stimulation. Low power consumption was achieved in a number of ways, such as usage of small bias current, sharing of key biasing blocks, and utilising a short duty cycle for stimulation. Less than 50 uW was consumed during stand-by mode, mostly by bias circuitry. A high gain current mirror amplifier, in the appendix, was proposed and simulated for biomedical circuits, achieving small area, low power consumption, and fast settling time. Apart from these, a novel technique to reduce the variation of CMOS <b>integrated</b> <b>resistor's</b> value was proposed.
