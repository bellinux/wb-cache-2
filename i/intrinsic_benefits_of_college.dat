40|$|This paper {{defends the}} view that <b>intrinsic</b> <b>benefit</b> to a human being {{consists}} exclusively in survival. It takes as its point of departure the neo-Aristotelian view that inquiry into <b>intrinsic</b> <b>benefit</b> to a human being should take place within a wider theory <b>of</b> <b>intrinsic</b> <b>benefit</b> to living things, generally. The paper first argues that the neo-Aristotelian view that <b>intrinsic</b> <b>benefit</b> to a living thing consists in flourishing {{as a member of}} its species, is mistaken. Rather, <b>intrinsic</b> <b>benefit</b> to a living thing consists in survival, and not survival as a member of its species, but survival simpliciter. A refined understanding of survival is developed in the paper. The paper then applies this Survivalist account <b>of</b> <b>intrinsic</b> <b>benefit</b> to human beings: The things we take to be good for human beings—e. g., pleasure, desire-fulfillment, etc. —are good to the extent and because they promote the one <b>intrinsic</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> survival...|$|R

It is found that uniaxial compressive strain really existed in HK pMOSFET with embedded SiGe S/D. The compressive strain induced the decrease in the tunneling attenuation length reflecting in the oxide trap depth from Si/SiO 2 interface to the HK layer, so that the oxide traps {{at a distance from}} insulator/semiconductor interface cannot capture carrier in the channel. Consequently, lower 1 /f[*][*]noise level in HK pMOSFET with embedded SiGe S/D is observed, thanks to the less carrier fluctuations from trapping/detrapping behaviors.

50|$|Researchers tested whether wild white-handed gibbon males from Khao Yai National Park, Thailand, {{increased}} their grooming activity when the female partner was fertile. Adult {{females and males}} of our study population are codominant (in terms of aggression), they live in pairs or small multi male groups and mate promiscuously. They found that males groomed females more than vice versa and more grooming was exchanged when females were cycling than during pregnancy or lactation. The number of copulations/day was elevated when females were cycling, and females copulated more frequently with males on days when they received more grooming. When males {{increased their}} grooming efforts, females also increased their grooming of males, perhaps to equalize give and take. Although grooming might be reciprocated because <b>of</b> <b>intrinsic</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> receiving grooming, males also interchange grooming as a commodity for sexual opportunities during a female's fertile period.|$|R

In a 14 -day daily-experience study of 69 romantic couples, communal strength was positively associated with positive emotions during the sacrifice itself, with feeling appreciated by the partner for the sacrifice, and with feelings of relationship satisfaction {{on the day of the}} sacrifice. Furthermore, feelings of authenticity for the sacrifice mediated these associations.

An empirical analysis of a contaminated site is used to illustrate the cumulative effect of this sell option and a measurement of financial loss. The results of a survey are used to determine the likely value of the real estate option and its effect on the subject property as part of the overall value.

40|$|Past {{research}} has emphasised the <b>intrinsic</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> {{participation in the}} arts, including more receptive modes of participation such as attending live performances and visiting museums and galleries, and more active modes such as participation in dance. However, there is {{a gap in the}} knowledge in relation to participation in circus arts. In this study, 17 adults currently involved in recreational circus arts, took part in semi-structured interviews that sought to identify the perceived <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> participation. Qualitative analysis revealed that the <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> participation in circus arts can be grouped under five categories: physical, psychological, intellectual, social and self-realisation. In addition, potential barriers to participation in circus arts were identified, including perceived ability to participate, physical ability to participate, and gender stereotypes.

40|$|Attendance at organisationally {{provided}} internal {{training and}} development activities (T&D), is often non-mandatory and therefore, to some degree, contingent on employees’ motivation to attend. Organisational climate {{for the transfer}} of training (transfer climate) includes work environment factors that influence the use of skills and knowledge gained during training when back in the workplace. We expected that transfer climate would be a strong determinant of employees’ intention to participate in training activities. Based on Self-Determination Theory (SDT) which describes motivation on a selfdetermination continuum involving various degrees of controlled (external) and autonomous (more intrinsic) motivation, we predicted that both transfer climate and perceived <b>intrinsic</b> <b>benefits</b> from attendance at T&D would be linked to more autonomous motivation to attend. This research also investigated the influence of different components of transfer climate factors and perceptions <b>of</b> <b>intrinsic</b> <b>benefits</b> on four types of motivation (amotivation, external regulation, identified regulation, and intrinsic motivation) to attend non-mandatory T&D activities. Academic and general staff employees of a regional Australian university completed a self-report Professional Development Survey developed for the study (n = 456). Multivariate analysis using Structural Equation Modeling {{was used to test}} the influence of transfer climate factors and <b>intrinsic</b> <b>benefits</b> on four types of motivation. Results showed that transfer climate factors differentially influenced the four types <b>of</b> motivation. <b>Intrinsic</b> <b>benefits</b> was a strong positive predictor of more autonomous types of motivation and a strong negative predictor of more controlled motivation and amotivation. Analysis of mediational models also showed that the relationship between transfer climate factors and type of motivation was partially mediated by <b>intrinsic</b> <b>benefits.</b> Employers should focus on strategies that generate more autonomous motivation to attend nonmandatory T&D among employees. These strategies should include promoting a positive transfer climate using positive reinforcement <b>of</b> the <b>intrinsic</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> T&D...|$|R

40|$|Broadband optical {{communication}} systems are rapidly becoming {{the key to}} overcome the stringent limitations imposed by standard electronic telecommunication networks. However, in order to complete the inevitable transition from electronics to photonics, several critical requirements must be addressed, including lowering energetic demands, achieving higher efficiency, increasing bandwidth and flexibility, all within a compact form factor [1 - 3]. In particular, it is broadly accepted that future photonic devices must be CMOS compatible in order to exploit the existing silicon fabrication technology that has been largely developed during the last 60 years [4 - 7].

The use of laparoscopic approach in resection of colorectal cancer started in the early 1990 s. Laparoscopic resection for colon cancer was widely advocated subsequently as most randomized trials had proven that the oncological outcome comparable to that of open colectomy could be achieved, in addition to the <b>intrinsic</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> minimally invasive surgery. Rectal cancer was rarely included in early randomized trials comparing laparoscopic and open surgery because of the relative complexity of rectal cancer resection, in particular, TME.
