We show the confining spectra which satisfy the ’t Hooft anomaly matching conditions and give a simple method to find the confining superpotential.

40|$|Is grammar {{dependence}} real? A {{comparison between}} cophonological and <b>indexed</b> <b>constraint</b> approaches to morphologically conditioned phonology* SHARON INKELAS AND CHERYL ZOLL This article compares and contrasts cophonology theory and indexed con-straint theory, the dominant current proposals to morphologically condi-tioned phonology. In cophonology theory, morphologically conditioned pho-nology is captured by associating each morphological construction or lexical class {{with its own}} phonological grammar, or cophonology. All constraints within a given cophonology are purely phonological; no constraint directly refers to morphological context. By contrast, <b>indexed</b> <b>constraint</b> theory as-sumes a single fixed constraint ranking for the entire language, and captures morphologically conditioned phonology by <b>indexing</b> individual <b>constraints</b> to specific morphological contexts. The article raises three {{arguments in favor of}} cophonology theory: greater formal parsimony, the ability to han-dle free variation, and more accurate predictions about the scope of mor-phologically conditioned phonological e¤ects. It also evaluates and rejects the primary argument for <b>indexed</b> <b>constraint</b> theory, i. e., Grammar Depen-dence, the claim that <b>indexed</b> <b>constraint</b> theory is more restrictive in the degree of language-internal diversity allowed. Cophonology theory and in-dexed constraint theory are equivalent in the range of language-internal di-versity they allow; it is argued that the upper limit on language-internal di-versity should not be a matter for formal grammar, but instead requires extra-grammatical explanation in terms of the factors influencing language change and variation. 1...|$|R

40|$|We {{show that}} a {{contracting}} universe which bounces due to quantum cosmological effects and connects to the hot big-bang expansion phase, can produce an almost scale invariant spectrum of perturbations provided the perturbations are produced during an almost matter dominated era in the contraction phase. This is achieved using Bohmian solutions of the canonical Wheeler-de Witt equation, thus treating both the background and the perturbations in a fully quantum manner. We find a very slightly blue spectrum (n__S- 1 > 0). Taking into account the spectral <b>index</b> <b>constraint</b> {{as well as the}} CMB normalization measure yields an equation of state that should be less than ω≲ 8 × 10 ^- 4, implying n__S- 1 ∼O(10 ^- 4), and that the characteristic size of the Universe at the bounce is L_ 0 ∼ 10 ^ 3 ℓ_Planck, a region where one expects that the Wheeler-DeWitt equation should be valid without being spoiled by string or loop quantum gravity effects.

40|$|A Gauss pseudospectral {{method is}} {{proposed}} {{in this study}} to solve the optimal trajectory-planning problem for satellite rapid large-angle maneuvers. In {{order to meet the}} requirement of rapid maneuver capability of agile small satellites, Single Gimbal Control Moment Gyros (SGCMGs) are adopted as the actuators for the attitude control systems (ACS). Because the singularity problem always exists for SGCMGs during the large-angle maneuvering of the satellites, a trajectory optimization method for the gimbal rates is developed based on the Gauss pseudospectral method. This method satisfies the control requirement of satellite rapid maneuvers and evades the singularity problem of SGCMGs. The method treats the large-angle maneuver problem as an optimization problem, which meets the boundary condition and a series of the physical constraints including the gimbal angle constraint, the gimbal rates constraint, the singularity <b>index</b> <b>constraint,</b> and some other performance criteria. This optimization problem is discretized as a nonlinear programming problem by the Gauss pseudospectral method. The optimal nonsingularity gimbal angle trajectory is obtained by the sequence of quadratic programming (SQP). This approach avoids the difficulties in solving the boundary value problem. The simulations reveal that the Gauss pseudospectral method effectively plans an optimal trajectory and satisfies all the constraints within a short time...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: User-defined {{data types}} such as {{intervals}} require specialized access methods to be efficiently searched and queried. As database implementors cannot provide appropriate index structures and query processing methods for each con-ceivable data type, present-day object-relational database systems offer extensible indexing frameworks that enable developers {{to extend the}} set of built-in index structures by custom access methods. Although these frameworks permit a seam-less integration of user-defined indexing techniques into query processing they do not facilitate the actual implementation of the access method itself. In order to lev-erage the applicability of indexing frameworks, relational access methods such as the Relational Interval Tree (RI-tree), an efficient index structure to process inter-val intersection queries, mainly rely on the functionality, robustness and perform-ance of built-in indexes, thus simplifying the index implementation significantly. To investigate the behavior and performance of the recently released IBM DB 2 in-dexing framework we use this interface to integrate the RI-tree into the DB 2 server. The standard implementation of the RI-tree, however, does not fit to the narrow corset of the DB 2 framework which is restricted {{to the use of}} a single index only. We therefore present our adaptation of the originally two-tree technique to the single <b>index</b> <b>constraint.</b> As experimental results with interval intersection que-ries show, the plugged-in access method delivers excellent performance compared to other techniques. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel way of {{automatically}} developing data warehouse configuration in rule-based CRM systems. Rule-based CRM systems assume that marketing activities are {{represented as a}} set of IF-THEN rules. Currently, to provide good quality CRM functionalities, CRM systems seek to combine conventional CRM methodologies with data warehousing technology. A data warehouse can be abstractly seen {{as a set of}} materialized views. Selecting views for materialization in a data warehouse is one of the important decision-making tasks in its design. However, there are few facilities in CRM systems with respect to data warehouse design that alleviate the problems associated with data schema maintenance. Given a set of campaign rules expressing marketing strategies, the proposed method generates data warehouse configuration (including database schema and <b>indexing</b> <b>constraint)</b> that can satisfy all the input rules. Our method begins on the premise that data warehouse configuration can be reversibly extracted from marketing campaign rules. This method includes algorithms for database schema generation, <b>indexing</b> <b>constraint</b> generation, schema normalization for removing data redundancies, and OLAP (On-Line Analytic Processing) query generation...|$|R

40|$|Conformational {{changes at}} supramolecular {{interfaces}} are fundamentally coupled to binding activity, yet {{it remains a}} challenge to probe this relationship directly. Within the nuclear pore complex, this underlies how transport receptors known as karyopherins proceed through a tethered layer of intrinsically disordered nucleoporin domains containing Phe-Gly (FG) -rich repeats (FG domains) that otherwise hinder passive transport. Here, we use nonspecific proteins (i. e., BSA) as innate molecular probes to explore FG domain conformational changes by surface plasmon resonance. This mathematically diminishes the surface plasmon resonance refractive <b>index</b> <b>constraint,</b> thereby providing the means to acquire and correlate height changes in a surface-tethered FG domain layer to Kap binding affinities in situ {{with respect to their}} relative spatial arrangements. Stepwise measurements show that FG domain collapse is caused by karyopherin β 1 (Kapβ 1) binding at low concentrations, but this gradually transitions into a reextension at higher Kapβ 1 concentrations. This ability to self-heal is intimately coupled to Kapβ 1 -FG binding avidity that promotes the maximal incorporation of Kapβ 1 into the FG domain layer. Further increasing Kapβ 1 to physiological concentrations leads to a "pileup" of Kapβ 1 molecules that bind weakly to unoccupied FG repeats {{at the top of the}} layer. Therefore, binding avidity does not hinder fast transport per se. Revealing the biophysical basis underlying the form-function relationship of Kapβ 1 -FG domain behavior results in a convergent picture in which transport and mechanistic aspects of nuclear pore complex functionality are reconciled...|$|E
40|$|For {{the class}} of nondispersive, nonabsorbing, {{multilayer}} thin-film optical systems, this thesis work develops a parallel branch-and-bound computational system on Amazon's EC 2 platform, using the Taylor model mathematical/computational system due to Berz and Makino to construct tight rigorous bounds on the merit function on subsets of the search space (as required by a branch-and-bound algorithm). This represents the first, {{to the best of}} our knowledge, deterministic global optimization algorithm for this important class of problems, i. e., the first algorithm that can guarantee that a global solution to an optimization problem in this class has been found. For the particular problem of reducing reflection using multilayer systems, it is shown that a gradient <b>index</b> <b>constraint</b> on the solution can be exploited to significantly reduce the search space and thereby make the algorithm more practical. This optimization system is then used to design a broadband omnidirectional antireflection coating for silicon solar energy. The design is experimentally validated using RF sputtering, and shows performance that is competitive with existing solutions based on impractical sophisticated nano-deposition techniques, as well as the more practical but also more narrowly applicable solutions based on texturing. This makes it arguably the best practical solution to this important problem to date. In addition, this thesis develops a mathematical theory for cheaply (in the computational sense) and tightly bounding solutions to parametric weakly-coupled semilinear parabolic (reaction-diffusion) partial differential equation systems, as motivated by the design of tandem organic solar cell structures (which are governed by the drift-diffusion-Poisson system of equations). This represents the first theoretical foundation, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, to enable guaranteed global optimization of this important class of problems, which includes, but is broader, than many semiconductor design problems.

40|$|In {{this paper}} I discuss {{exceptional}} occurrences in the nominal and verbal morphology of Assamese {{and the role}} of <b>indexed</b> markedness <b>constraints</b> in accounting for these exceptions. Assamese vowel harmony is a 'directional' right-to-left regressive harmony system, which normally ignores morphological boundaries. In contrast to the general process of harmony, this work shows that some morphemes can influence vowel harmony and result in exceptional patterns. Following Pater (2006) it is shown that indexation of markedness constraints can account for these exceptional occurrences. This work also shows that the caveat in Pater (2006) about such constraints' ability to subvert the universal constraint ranking ROOT FAITH >> AFFIX FAITH is indeed borne true. Consequently, the Assamese examples show that <b>indexed</b> <b>constraints</b> lead to an exceptional alternation where [±Back] harmony occurs only in the root and the suffixal [±Back] values remain unaltered. I argue that this reversal is a result of confluence of several factors leading to the theoretically motivated observation that some unexpected processes in OT may be emergent. The paper also deals with another exceptional pattern where the combined outcome of vowel harmony and a morphological requirement of avoiding vowel-vowel sequences results in an exceptional pattern of syllabification. Contextualising these occurrences to the need for <b>indexed</b> markedness <b>constraints,</b> it is shown that the indexation of *HIATUS is able to analyse these occurrences. Furthermore, it is shown that hiatus avoidance can be the result of varying markedness requirements and it need not be the result of a single motivation of unmarkedness dictated by the overarching grammatical structure. *HIATUS is satisfied by both epenthesis as well as vowel deletion, and in one instance a morpheme even prefers a hiatal situation over non-hiatus. The exceptional occurrences show that markedness requirements and reversals may be often emergent, and therefore a result of a particular relation that a specific morpheme construes to be the least marked...|$|R

We propose an extensible theory of indexed types, in which programmers can define the index data appropriate to their pro-grams and use them to track properties of run-time code. The es-sential ingredients in our proposal are (1) a logical framework, which is used to define <b>index</b> data, <b>constraints,</b> and proofs, and (2) computation with indices, both at the static and dynamic levels of the programming language. Computation with indices supports a variety of mechanisms necessary for programming with exten-sible indexed types, including the definition and implementation of indexed types, meta-theoretic reasoning about indices, proof-producing run-time checks, computed index expressions, and run-time actions of <b>index</b> <b>constraints.</b> Programmer-defined <b>index</b> propositions and their proofs can be represented naturally in a logical framework such as LF, where variable binding is used to model the consequence relation of the logic.

The technical contributions of this paper are a novel method for computing with the higher-order data of a simple logical framework and the integration of such com-putation into the static and dynamic levels of a programming lan-guage.
