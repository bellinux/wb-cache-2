50|$|In {{hydraulic}} engineering, {{air bubble}} entrainment {{is defined as}} the <b>entrapment</b> <b>of</b> <b>air</b> bubbles and pockets that are advected within the turbulent flow. The entrainment of air packets can be localised or continuous along the air-water interface. Examples of localised aeration include air entrainment by plunging water jet and at hydraulic jump. Bubbles are entrained locally at the intersection of the impinging jet with the surrounding waters. The intersecting perimeter is a singularity in terms of both air entrainment and momentum exchange, and the air is entrapped at the discontinuity between the impinging jet flow and the receiving pool of water. Interfacial aeration {{is defined as the}} air entrainment process along an air-water interface, usually parallel to the flow direction.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most direct}} and well publicised hazard is lung {{overpressure}} due {{to either a}} failure {{on the part of}} the diver to allow the expanding air in the lungs to escape harmlessly, or <b>entrapment</b> <b>of</b> <b>air</b> due to circumstances beyond the control of the diver. Lung overpressure can lead to fatal or disabling injury, and can occur during training exercises, even when reasonable precautions have been taken. There is some evidence that a full exhalation at the start of the ascent in the [...] "blow and go" [...] scenario, can lead to partial collapse of some of the smaller air passages, and that these can then trap air during the ascent sufficiently to cause tissue rupture and air embolism. The procedure of slowly letting the air escape during ascent can also be taken too far, and not allow the air to escape fast enough, with similar consequences. attempting to breathe off the empty cylinder is one way of potentially avoiding these problems, as this has the double advantage of keeping the airways open more reliably, and in most cases allowing the diver several more breaths during the ascent as the reduced ambient pressure allows more of the residual cylinder air to pass through the regulator and become available to the diver. A 10-litre cylinder ascending 10 metres will produce an extra 10 litres of free air (reduced to atmospheric pressure). At a tidal volume of about 1 litre this would give several breaths during ascent, with increased effectiveness nearer the surface. Of course this air is not available in some cases, such as a rolled off cylinder valve, burst hose, blown o-ring, or lost second stage, where the failure is not simply breathing all the air down to the pressure where the regulator stops delivering, but if it is possible, the demand valve can be kept in the mouth and the diver can continue to attempt to breathe from it during a free ascent.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{theoretical}} and experimental {{studies have shown}} that mushroom shaped micro-pillars exhibit strongly enhanced adhesive performance in comparison to other pillar shapes. However, in the presence of interfacial impurities (e. g. solid particles or air bubbles) the adhesive strength could drastically drop. In this paper we theoretically investigate the effect <b>of</b> the <b>entrapment</b> <b>of</b> micro-bubbles <b>of</b> <b>air</b> at the interface between the mushroom shaped micro-pillar and a rigid substrate on the adhesive performance. We calculate the critical pull-off stress {{as a function of the}} initial volume <b>of</b> the entrapped <b>air,</b> and compare these results with those obtained when, instead <b>of</b> <b>air,</b> small external solid particles are entrapped at the interface. Our results show that the presence <b>of</b> entrapped <b>air</b> is more critical since it strongly reduces the suction effect. The critical stress, indeed, is about 35 - 40 % smaller than the value observed in the case of solid particles, thus resulting in a considerable reduction of the adhesive performance of the mushroom shaped pillar...|$|R

40|$|The {{impact of}} a sessile droplet with a moving meniscus, as {{encountered}} in processes such as dip-coating, generically leads to the <b>entrapment</b> <b>of</b> small <b>air</b> bubbles. Here we experimentally study this process of bubble formation by looking through the liquid using high-speed imaging. Our central finding is {{that the size of}} the entrapped bubble crucially depends on the location where coalescence between the drop and the moving meniscus is initiated: (i) at a finite height above the substrate, or (ii) exactly at the contact line. In the first case, we typically find bubble sizes of the order of a few microns, independent of the size and speed of the impacting drop. By contrast, the bubbles that are formed when coalescence starts at the contact line become increasingly large, as the size or the velocity of the impacting drop is increased. We show how these observations can be explained from a balance between the lubrication pressure in the air layer and the capillary pressure of the drop...|$|R
40|$|A {{variety of}} {{splashing}} phenomena from an impacting liquid drop on a deep liquid pool {{has been studied}} in the past. One of the many phenomena associated with liquid drops impacting on a liquid surface is the <b>entrapment</b> <b>of</b> small <b>air</b> bubbles in the bulk fluid {{through a variety of}} mechanisms. This article will describe how thousands of microbubbles « 24 µm) can be entrained in the bulk fluid. All microbubble entrapment mechanisms were found {{to be the result of}} rapidly rupturing thin air films with rupture velocities ranging from 4 - 17 mls. The size <b>of</b> the <b>air</b> bubbles resulting from the film rupture bore a direct relation to the velocity of the film rupture. The formation of the thin film in all cases was related to the creation <b>of</b> an <b>air</b> sheet between the impacting drop and liquid surface just prior to impact. In most cases a rapid stretching and thinning of the film lead to the rupture and formation of microbubbles. A new region <b>of</b> microbubble <b>entrapment</b> was identified from the rupture of the film that supports floating drops.

Droplets of a few picoliters are ejected from an inkjet nozzle at frequencies of up to 100 kHz. However, the <b>entrapment</b> <b>of</b> an <b>air</b> microbubble in the ink channel can severely impede the productivity and reliability of the printing system. The air bubble disturbs the channel acoustics, resulting in disrupted drop formation or failure of the jetting process. Here we study a micro-electro-mechanical systems-based printhead.

The infrared visualization technique allowed for the accurate sizing of the bubble, including its dynamics, inside the intact printhead. A model was developed to calculate the mutual interaction between the channel acoustics and the bubble dynamics.

40|$|When surface {{soils are}} dry, 0 2 and N 2 are adsorbed on the ex-ternal mineral surfaces. In {{the process of}} wetting the soil, water {{molecules}} displace the adsorbed 0 2 and N 2 molecules to the gas phase {{where they can be}} measured, as was done in this study. These gases, released from the adsorbed phase, join entrapped air in the gaseous phase as the primary factor disintegrating aggregates when soils are wet quickly. Adsorption of N 2 and 02 occurs on surface soils during hot dry afternoons as the water molecules leave the surface. During cool nights, relative humidities commonly rise above 50 %, allowing more strongly adsorbed H 2 O molecules to displace adsorbed 02 and N 2.

40|$|This {{study is}} a {{comparison}} of CFC- 12 (CCl 2 F 2) measurements in firn air and ice core samples from three Antarctic sites: South Pole, West Antarctic Ice Sheet Divide (79. 46 °S, 112. 13 °W), and Siple Dome (81. 65 °S, 148. 81 °W). CFC- 12 is a synthetic chlorofluorocarbon manufactured during the mid-late 20 th century {{for use as a}} refrigerant and an aerosol spray propellant. Its atmospheric history is well established with agreement among instrumental time series measurements and industry-reported production data [Walker et al., 2000], the distribution of dissolved CFC- 12 in the oceans [e. g. Weiss et al., 1985], and firn air measurements [Butler et al., 1999]. The atmospheric history indicates that there was no measureable CFC- 12 in the atmosphere prior to the 1940 ’s. The firn air CFC- 12 profiles are consistent with the known atmospheric history of this gas. In contrast, the air in ice core samples collected near the close-off depth exhibit anomalously high CFC- 12 levels. We propose that this is due to <b>entrapment</b> <b>of</b> modern <b>air</b> in open pores that close after drilling, resulting in elevated CFC- 12 mixing ratios. These results demonstrate how the composition <b>of</b> <b>air</b> trapped in shallow ice cores can be altered during the post-drilling period through purely physical processes.

40|$|We {{report the}} use of {{hydrodynamic}} cavitation as a novel, bottom-up method for continuous creation of foams comprising of air microbubbles in aqueous systems containing surface active ingredients, like proteins or particles.

In addition, the technique provided the possibility of forming non-spherical bubbles due to the high elongational stresses experienced by the bubbles as they flow through the nozzle throat. We show that surface active agents with a high surface elasticity modulus can be used to stabilize the nascent air bubbles and keep their elongated shapes for prolonged periods of time. This combination of the cavitation process with appropriate surface active agents offers an opportunity for creating bubbles smaller than 10 microns, which can provide unique benefits in various applications...|$|E

Drug delivery systems are those that float immediately upon contact with gastric fluids present promising approaches for increasing the bioavailability of drugs with absorption windows in the upper small intestine.

Devices with an initially high density (which decreases with time) first settle down in the stomach and, thus, undergo the risk of premature emptying.

Droplets of a few picoliters are ejected from an ink jet nozzle at a frequency of up to 50 kHz. However, <b>entrapment</b> <b>of</b> an <b>air</b> microbubble into the ink channel can severely impede the productivity and reliability of the printing system. The air bubble disturbs the channel acoustics resulting in disrupted drop formation and failure of the ink channel. In this research we study air entrapment in a normal inkjet printhead and a Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) based inkjet printhead. By using the actuating piezo transducer in receive the acoustics inside the channel could be monitored, clearly identifying the presence <b>of</b> an <b>air</b> microbubble inside the channel during a channel failure. A model was developed to calculate the two-way coupling between the channel acoustics and the disturbing bubble. The model was validated by simultaneous acoustical and infrared detection of the bubble. Using a glass inset in the normal printhead and a infrared visualization technique for the MEMS printhead allowed for an accurate depiction of the bubble size and its translational dynamics inside the print head. The model proves to be a very valuable tool in calculating the presence, the size and the position <b>of</b> entrapped <b>air</b> bubbles inside an operating ink printhead, purely from its acoustic response. We also studied the details of droplet formation with the Brandaris ultrahigh-speed imaging facility at frame rates of up to 10 million frames per second and using an even faster stroboscopic technique of order 5 nanoseconds. The highly reproducible recordings were analyzed to give the local flow rate and velocity distribution within the droplet. The results are compared to a 1 -dimensional model based on the lubrication approximation. In the model the equations are solved on an Eulerian grid with a second order accurate scheme.

Materialsx and Methods: Aerobiological sampling was done using Burkard 24 h spore trap system. The site selected for the <b>entrapment</b> <b>of</b> the <b>air</b> spore was the building of Asthma Bhawan situated at Vidhyadhar Nagar, Jaipur. New patients coming with problems of respiratory allergy such as AR or asthma were recruited in the study. Skin prick tests (SPTs) were carried out after obtaining consent in these patients. Monthly pollen counts of trees, weeds and grasses were correlated with the number of new patients. Pollen calendar was prepared for 2 years. Results: Average annual pollen count during 2011 and 2012 were 14, 460. 5. In the analysis, 37 types of species or families were identified. Pollen count showed two seasonal peaks during March–April and from August to October. January and June showed the lowest pollen counts in 2 years. Average monthly count of grass pollens showed significant correlation with number of new patients (r = 0. 59). However, monthly pollen count of trees and weeds did not correlate. The correlation of the pollen count of individual pollen with the SPT positivity to that pollen showed significant correlation with Chenopodium album only.
