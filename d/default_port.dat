50|$|By <b>default,</b> <b>ports</b> {{are driven}} at the tile's {{reference}} clock. However, clock block resources {{can be used}} to provide different clock signals, either by dividing the reference clock, or based on an external signal. Ports can be further configured to use buffering and to synchronise with other ports. This configuration is performed using library functions.|$|R

50|$|Most {{programs}} that communicate {{over the internet}} use either the TCP or the UDP protocol. Both protocols support 65536 so called ports that programs can choose to bind to. This allows programs to run concurrently on one IP address. Most programs have <b>default</b> <b>ports</b> that are most often used. For example, HTTP servers commonly use TCP port 80.|$|R
50|$|The <b>default</b> <b>ports</b> {{used for}} the direct and reverse {{connections}} were 6666 and 9999 respectively, though the attacker {{had the option of}} changing these. Beast came with a built-in firewall bypasser and had the ability of terminating some Anti-Virus or firewall processes. It also came with a file binder {{that could be used to}} join two or more files together into one executable.|$|R

It uses port 9060 for connection as the <b>default</b> administration <b>port</b> and port 9080 as the <b>default</b> website publication <b>port.</b> In case you install more WebSphere instances these values will be changed.|$|R

50|$|Microsoft Media Server (MMS), a Microsoft {{proprietary}} network-streaming protocol, {{serves to}} transfer unicast data in Windows Media Services (previously called NetShow Services). MMS can be transported via UDP or TCP. The MMS <b>default</b> <b>port</b> is UDP/TCP 1755.|$|E
50|$|Port 411 is the <b>default</b> <b>port</b> for hubs, and 412 for client-to-client connections. If {{either of}} these ports are already in use, the port number is {{incremented}} until the number of a free port is found for use. For example, if 411, 412 and 413 are in use, then port 414 will be used.|$|E
50|$|A common {{alternative}} method of securing LDAP communication is using an SSL tunnel. The <b>default</b> <b>port</b> for LDAP over SSL is 636. The use of LDAP over SSL was common in LDAP Version 2 (LDAPv2) {{but it was}} never standardized in any formal specification. This usage has been deprecated along with LDAPv2, which was officially retired in 2003.|$|E
50|$|The common ports for an IRCd {{process are}} 6665 to 6669, with 6667 being the {{historical}} <b>default.</b> These <b>ports</b> can be opened by a non-superuser process, {{and they became}} widely used.|$|R
2500|$|Scheme's {{input and}} output {{is based on the}} port datatype. (R5RS sec 6.6) [...] R5RS defines two <b>default</b> <b>ports,</b> {{accessible}} with the procedures current-input-port and current-output-port, which correspond to the Unix notions of standard input and standard output. Most implementations also provide current-error-port. Redirection of input and standard output is supported in the standard, by standard procedures such as with-input-from-file and with-output-to-file. [...] Most implementations provide string ports with similar redirection capabilities, enabling many normal input-output operations to be performed on string buffers instead of files, using procedures described in SRFI 6. The R6RS standard specifies much more sophisticated and capable port procedures and many new types of port.|$|R
50|$|Not all HTTP {{proxy servers}} support this feature, {{and even those}} that do may limit the {{behaviour}} (for example only allowing connections to the <b>default</b> HTTPS <b>port</b> 443, or blocking traffic which doesn't appear to be SSL).|$|R
50|$|IBM 5250 or 3270 {{workstation}} emulation {{is supported}} via custom telnet clients, TN5250/TN3270, and IBM servers. Clients and servers designed to pass IBM 5250 data streams over Telnet generally do support SSL encryption, as SSH {{does not include}} 5250 emulation. Under OS/400 (also known as IBM i), port 992 is the <b>default</b> <b>port</b> for secured telnet.|$|E

5000|$|Microsoft Windows {{operating}} systems through XP use the range 1025 - 5000 as ephemeral ports by default. [...] Windows Vista, Windows 7, and Server 2008 use the IANA range by default. Windows Server 2003 uses the range 1025 - 5000 by default, until Microsoft security update MS08-037 from 2008 is installed, after which {{it uses the}} IANA range by default. Windows Server 2008 with Exchange Server 2007 installed has a <b>default</b> <b>port</b> range of 1025 - 60000. In addition to the default range, all versions of Windows since Windows 2000 {{have the option of}} specifying a custom range anywhere within 1025 - 65535.|$|E

50|$|The <b>default</b> <b>port</b> {{number for}} HTTP is 80. However, most webservers can be {{configured}} {{to operate on}} almost any port number, provided the port number is not in use by any other program on the server. There is the HTTP Secure special port 443 that needs special configuration (see Server Name Indication). Port based web sites are explicitly bound to a unique port number and an IP address. In this case the IP address is used for hosting multiple web sites. The unique port number used for a common IP address distinguish an individual web site from other web sites bound to the same IP Address.|$|E
50|$|Some FTP server {{implementations}} {{implement the}} SFTP protocol; however, outside of dedicated file servers, SFTP protocol support is usually provided by an SSH server implementation, as it shares the <b>default</b> <b>port</b> of 22 with other SSH services. SFTP implementations may include an SSH protocol implementation to leverage integration of SSH connection details with preexisting FTP server access controls, where an alternative SSH server is tolerable or where alternative ports may be used. An SSH2 server which supports subsystems may be leveraged {{to keep a}} uniform SSH implementation while enhancing access controls with third party software, {{at the cost of}} fine-grained integration with connection details, and SSH1 compatibility.|$|E
50|$|TCP {{provides}} reliable, ordered {{delivery of}} a stream of bytes from a program on one computer to another program on another computer. TCP is the protocol that major Internet applications rely on, such as the World Wide Web, e-mail, and file transfer. Each of these applications (web server, email server, FTP server) is called a network service. In this system, network services are identified using two components: a host address and a port number. There are 65536 distinct and usable port numbers per host. Most services use a limited range of numbers by default, and the <b>default</b> <b>port</b> number for a service is almost always used.|$|E
50|$|Cisco's {{implementation}} of traceroute also uses {{a sequence of}} UDP datagrams, each with incrementing TTL values, to an invalid port number at the remote host; by <b>default,</b> UDP <b>port</b> 33434 is used. An extended version of this command (known as the extended traceroute command) can change the destination port number used by the UDP probe messages.|$|R
50|$|Some {{internet}} service providers (ISPs), {{in an effort to}} reduce email spam originating at their customer's IP addresses, will not allow their customers to communicate directly with the recipient's mail server via the <b>default</b> SMTP <b>port</b> number 25. In this case the customer {{has no choice but to}} use the smart host provided by the ISP.|$|R
