5|$|In most Dragon Quest games, players must visit {{a church}} (known as a House of Healing in the NES translations) {{and talk to}} a priest or nun to save the games' progress; in Dragon Warrior, players <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> a king to save their progress, though the first two Dragon Quest titles for Famicom use a {{password}} save system. If the party dies in battle the group loses half of its gold and warps to the nearest save location where the hero is revived; players must then pay a priest or nun to revive their party members.|$|E
5|$|Parker was at {{home when}} the August 1896 term began, too sick to preside over the court, as he {{suffered}} from Bright's disease. The jurisdiction of the court {{came to an end}} on September 1, 1896, over lands in the Indian Territory; reporters wanted to interview him about his career but <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> him at his bedside. Parker died on November 17, 1896, of a number of health conditions, including heart degeneration and Bright's disease. His funeral in Fort Smith had the highest number of attenders up to that point. He is buried at the Fort Smith National Cemetery.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Wes Archer, and was written by Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein. It was originally intended to deal with Homer and Marge's problematic sex life, but later developed into {{a story about the}} relationship between Homer and Grampa. Dan Castellaneta provides the voices for both Homer and Grampa. Castellaneta therefore <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> himself when he recorded the voices of the two characters in their interactions for this episode. Castellaneta says that it is hard for him to do Grampa's voice {{for an extended period of}} time because it is [...] "wheezy and airy".|$|E
5000|$|On 13 November 2016, Zakharova drew {{criticism}} for joking on Russian state television that the U.S. election results {{were the result}} of a Jewish conspiracy, stating [...] "If {{you want to know what}} will happen in America, who do you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to?</b> You <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> our people in Brighton Beach, naturally." [...] She also spoke in a stereotypical Jewish accent.|$|R

6000|$|... "Isn't it beautiful?" [...] {{said the}} Story Girl in rapture. [...] "I wouldn't {{have missed it}} for anything. I'm glad I left my necklace. And I am glad you are with me, Bev. The others wouldn't {{understand}} so well. I like you because I don't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you all the time. It's so nice to walk with someone you don't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to.</b> Here is the graveyard. Are you frightened to pass it, Bev?" ...|$|R
500|$|According to Taraborrelli, [...] "Many female artists {{behave like}} a diva for a period when they reach superstar status, and the 'Who's That Girl?' tour marked the {{beginning}} of Madonna's." [...] For instance, she would not allow crew members to talk directly to her; they <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> her representatives, lest they distract her from the business at hand. She also forbade her dancers from speaking to her and her musicians were not permitted to even look at her unless they were onstage with her. Moreover, when coming on and off the stage, Madonna demanded that road managers hold sheets around her in order to shield her from the eyes of [...] "those who couldn't help but stare". DeMann commented: [...] "She has a way of demanding that compels you to give her your undivided attention", to which Taraborrelli felt that such behavior actually was an indication of how successful and strong Madonna was. [...] "You don't {{behave like a}} bitch until you are that successful. The tour sure helped cement her star status", he commented.|$|E
500|$|The season {{confirms}} that the blue alien seen in the first season, and a recurring plot point this season, {{was a member of}} the Kree race, who play a significant role in Guardians of the Galaxy. Whedon explained that [...] "We obviously showed this body a year ago at around this time. When we were breaking that and sussing out what this arc would be, we had to have a lot of the pieces in place from the get go ... we <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> features about what their plans were and where they were going." [...] When asked whether this counts as the series tie-in to Guardians of the Galaxy, Whedon said [...] "It is a very far away other galaxy, so it's a little bit harder to have one of them walk into our set, so a direct tie-in is a little bit more challenging, but it's all one universe, so there's always opportunity for more. ... In Guardians, we saw parts in our universe that we hadn't explored yet, so it shows we're a part of that too." [...] This storyline also introduces the Inhumans to the MCU, ahead of their own film.|$|E
2500|$|Grampa's {{voice is}} {{performed}} by Dan Castellaneta, who also voices numerous other characters, including Homer Simpson, Krusty the Clown, Barney Gumble, Groundskeeper Willie, Mayor Quimby and Hans Moleman. Castellaneta {{was part of}} the regular cast of The Tracey Ullman Show and had previously done some voice-over work in Chicago alongside his wife Deb Lacusta. Castellaneta likes to stay in character during recording sessions, and tries to visualize a scene in his mind so that he can give the proper voice to it. The episode [...] "Grampa vs. Sexual Inadequacy" [...] (season six, 1994) featured many interactions between Grampa and Homer, so Castellaneta therefore <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> himself when he recorded the voices for that episode. Castellaneta said it is hard for him to do Grampa's voice because it is [...] "wheezy and airy".|$|E

60|$|There {{were some}} people there {{of the night}} before, and Colville <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> them. One of the ladies {{asked him if he}} had met the Inglehart boys as he came in.|$|E
6000|$|... "To avert suspicion, most dear Betty. Also I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> her of this Peter, in {{whom she}} seems so greatly interested. You are very shrewd, Betty--tell me, {{is that to}} be a match?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No!" [...] she said. [...] "That is finished. I {{had to see}} you. I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you. Go away, please. I cannot bear to see you any more. It is too terrible--too terrible!" ...|$|E
5000|$|... "I don't know. I can't {{answer that}} yet. I'm too busy. I'll <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you later. A {{couple of friends}} are coming to get me." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "What news {{have you}} heard lately, Mrs. Leake?" [...] asked Miss Todd. The great thing was <b>to</b> make Mrs. Leake <b>talk</b> instead of <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, I {{was obliged}} to let him {{understand}} explicitly that I preferred to keep some of my clothes for my own personal wearing; also, I put his magnificence upon an allowance of cologne-water, and actually was so cruel as to restrict him to one dozen of my cambric handkerchiefs. Dolph was particularly huffy about it, and I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> him like a father, to bring him round." ...|$|E
60|$|But {{remembering that}} dialogue, Mr. Bulstrode felt {{that when he}} <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> his wife fully about his plan of quitting Middlemarch, he should be glad {{to tell her that}} he had made an {{arrangement}} which might be for the good of her nephew Fred. At present he had merely mentioned to her that he thought of shutting up The Shrubs for a few months, and taking a house on the Southern Coast.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's all right, that's all right, {{you may be}} sure, mother," [...] said Cohen, as if {{anxious to}} cut off inquiry on matters {{in which he was}} {{uncertain}} of the guest's position. [...] "So, sir," [...] he added, turning with a look of amused enlightenment to Deronda, [...] "it was better than learning you <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> Mordecai about! I wondered to myself at the time. I thought somehow there was a something." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I was. There are two, you know. But {{they don't}} {{mean so much}} to me now. You'd take them for natives anywhere. I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> them in Samoan." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Oh, {{they are}} all right,' said she. 'They are both in college now. But Mr. Howard deaf! I am truly amazed. Do you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> him through this, Mary?' ...|$|R

6000|$|Roger {{came out}} to Lowlands oftener than ever after that. He <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> {{somebody}} about Stephanie Gardiner and Freda was the safest vent. The [...] "pursuit of the Ideal," [...] as she called it, went on with vim and fervour. Sometimes Roger {{would be on the}} heights of hope and elation; the next visit he would be in the depths of despair and humility. Freda had learned to tell which it was by the way he opened the snuggery door.|$|E
60|$|But {{this was}} {{only one aspect of}} the subject that filled the girl's thoughts. She knew that Prescott loved her and she was glad of it; but here she stopped. She was sanguine, impulsive, courageous, but, with all that could be said for it, the change she must face if he claimed her was a startling one. Besides, he must clear himself of suspicion, and because the part of a mere looker-on was uncongenial, there was a course which she would urge on him. She must see him and {{convince}} him of the necessity for it. Soon after she had made up her mind on this point, Jernyngham and Colston came in, and she <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> them.|$|E
6000|$|... “She thinks so, {{but half}} the people don’t care for us. They’re not so good as we and they know it—I’ll do them that justice—so that they wonder why we should care for them. When we’re polite to them they think the less of us; {{there are plenty of}} people like that. Mamma thinks so much of them simply because they’re foreigners. If I could tell you all the ugly stupid tenth-rate people I’ve <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> for no better reason than that they were de leur pays!—Germans, French, Italians, Turks, everything. When I {{complain}} mamma always says that at any rate it’s practice in the language. And she makes so much of the most impossible English too; I don’t know what that’s practice in.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why not go {{over there}} and see if we can't {{get to the bottom of}} this game?" [...] was the {{unexpected}} proposal uttered by Mr. Jones. [...] "He will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well;--I suppose I did mean to {{show him}} that I {{was not going to}} be exterminated by him. He will write to the {{governor}} to-day. And you will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> the governor." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's all right," [...] said Veronica. [...] "I don't {{really mean}} any harm. He's a sailor, and I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> him like that, else he don't know he's being talked to." ...|$|R
60|$|And James {{was horrified}} at the pettiness and the {{prejudice}} which {{he found in}} his home. Reading no books, for they thought it waste of time to read, the minds {{of his father and}} mother had sunk into such a narrow sluggishness that they could interest themselves only in trivialities. Their thoughts were occupied by their neighbours and the humdrum details of the life about them. Flattering themselves on their ideals and their high principles, they vegetated in stupid sloth and in a less than animal vacuity. Every topic of conversation above the most commonplace they found dull or incomprehensible. James learned that he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> them almost as if they were children, and the tedium of those endless days was intolerable.|$|E

60|$|DAISY. They {{hated me}} at the mission. They found fault with me from morning till night. They blamed me because you wanted to marry me and they treated me as if I was a {{designing}} cat. When you went away they heaved a sigh of relief. Then they started to convert me. They thought I'd better become a school teacher. They hated me because I was seventeen. They hated me because I was pretty. Oh, the brutes. They killed all the religion I'd got. There was only one person who seemed to care if I was alive or dead. That was my mother. Oh, I was so ashamed the first time I saw her. At school in England I'd told them so often {{that she was a}} Chinese princess that I almost believed it myself. My mother was a dirty little ugly Chinawoman. I'd forgotten all my Chinese and I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> her in English. She asked me if I'd like to go to Shanghai with her. I was ready to do anything in the world {{to get away from the}} mission and I thought in Shanghai I shouldn't be so far away from you. They didn't want me to go, but they couldn't keep me against my will. When we got to Shanghai she sold me to Lee Tai Cheng for two thousand dollars.|$|E
