50|$|Magnetic fusion {{works to}} heat a <b>dilute</b> <b>plasma</b> (1014 ions per cm3) to high temperatures, around 20 keV (~200 million C). Ambient air is about 100,000 times denser. To make a {{practical}} reactor at these temperatures, the fuel must be confined {{for long periods}} of time, on the order of 1 second. The ITER tokamak design is currently being built to test the magnetic approach with pulse lengths up to 20 minutes. Inertial fusion attempts to produce much higher densities, 1025 ions per cubic cm, about 100 times the density of lead. This causes reactions to occur extremely quickly (~1 nanosecond), which allows confinement time to be extremely short, as the heat of reactions drives the plasma outward. The $3-4 billion National Ignition Facility (NIF) machine at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) will be a definitive test of ICF at megajoule energy levels. As of 2015 both conventional methods of nuclear fusion are nearing net energy (Q>1) levels after many decades of research, but remain far from a practical energy-producing device.|$|E

40|$|The {{amounts of}} {{fibrinogen}} adsorbed to glass from various human blood plasmas have been measured {{as a function}} of time. The plasmas were 11 single donor plasmas, pooled plasma, a single donor high molecular weight kininogen (HMWK) -deficient plasma and HMWK-deficient plasma, which had been reconstituted with HMWK. For adsorption times between 1 min and 1 h more fibrinogen adsorbed from HMWK-deficient plasma compared with the amounts of fibrinogen which adsorbed from the other plasmas. This result supports the conclusion of several authors that HMWK is involved in the displacement of fibrinogen, initially adsorbed from normal human plasma to glass. Glass surfaces, pre-exposed to solutions of plasma and subsequently exposed to 1 : 1 <b>diluted</b> <b>plasma,</b> gives rise to a relatively high adsorption of HMWK which is independent of the plasma concentration of the precoating solution. The results indicate that HMWK from 1 : 1 <b>diluted</b> <b>plasma</b> is involved in the displacement of proteins from glass surfaces which had been pre-exposed to solutions with a low plasma concentration. Experiments with polyethylene as a substrate reveal that high density lipoprotein (HDL) from 1 : 1 <b>diluted</b> <b>plasma</b> is involved in the displacement of proteins from polyethylene surfaces which had been pre-exposed to solutions with a low plasma concentration.

DESIGN & METHODS: Twenty UCB matched samples of <b>diluted</b> <b>plasma</b> and serum were collected. The samples were analysed by two liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) methods on two separate occasions. RESULTS: The results of 25 (OH) D 3 obtained by the two laboratories demonstrated close agreement with a mean difference of 0. 14 nmol/L [95 % confidence interval (95 % CI), - 6. 8 to 7. 1]. Both methods demonstrate close agreement for 25 (OH) D 3 in UCB serum versus diluted UCB plasma; mean difference 2. 2 nmol/L [95 % CI, - 9. 5 to 13. 9] and 4. 1 nmol/L [95 % CI, - 14. 5 to 6. 1] for the results from Lab A and Lab B, respectively. Vitamin A was quantified by Lab A in UCB serum and diluted UCB plasma; mean difference 0. 07 μmol/L [95 % CI, - 0. 41 to 0. 28]. Results of 25 (OH) D 3 epimer and vitamin E in the <b>diluted</b> UCB <b>plasma</b> were below the limit of quantification, and could not be compared with UCB serum. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Diluted</b> UCB <b>plasma</b> can be used for the quantification of retinol and 25 (OH) D 3 by LC-MS/MS.

40|$|Vasopressin {{promotes}} renal water reabsorption decreasing excretion of {{free water}} to <b>dilute</b> <b>plasma</b> and lower serum osmolality. We have {{good understanding of}} the causes, mechanisms and consequences of this vasopressin-dependent renal water movement. In comparison, vasopressin actions on renal electrolytes including sodium excretion and its consequences have been less well understood. This is so for investigation and discussions of the renal actions of vasopressin are framed primarily around water metabolism rather than any direct effect on salt handling. The fact that water moves in biological systems, to include the mammalian kidney, only by osmosis passively down its concentration gradient is implicit in such discussion but often not overtly addressed. This can cause confusion. Moreover, although vasopressin action on renal sodium excretion via the V 2 receptor is critical to water transport, it is masked easily being situational—for instance, dependent on hydration state. It {{is now clear that}} an increase in sodium reabsorption along the distal nephron (CNT + CD) mediated by activation of the epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) by vasopressin makes an important contribution to maintenance of the axial corticomedullary osmotic gradient necessary for maximal water reabsorption. Thus, we need to modify slightly our understanding of vasopressin and its renal actions to include the idea that while vasopressin decreases free water excretion to <b>dilute</b> <b>plasma,</b> it does this, in part, by promoting sodium reabsorption and consequently decreasing sodium excretion via ENaC activated along the distal nephron...|$|E
