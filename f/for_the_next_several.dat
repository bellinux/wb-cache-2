5|$|Frontier policy {{under the}} Tang dynasty {{reversed}} the wall-building activities of most previous dynasties that had occupied northern China since {{the third century}} BC, and no extensive wall building took place <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>several</b> hundred years.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to these developments, concerned citizens worried {{about the future of}} the habitat formed Save the Pine Bush in 1978. The organization filed lawsuits <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>several</b> decades to stop further developments in the barrens.|$|E
50|$|Other {{community}} and regional facilities currently are in <b>the</b> planning stage <b>for</b> construction in <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>several</b> years.|$|R
50|$|Autumn {{has also}} been busy working {{in the studio with}} {{numerous}} other producers on a slew of major label projects slated <b>for</b> release over <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>several</b> months. Artists she has recently worked with include Alexandra Burke, Kelis, Leona Lewis, The Saturdays, Estelle, Cher Lloyd.|$|R
25|$|During the 1898–99 season Sheffield Wednesday {{were told}} that the land rented at Olive Grove would be needed for railway expansions. They were allowed to remain there <b>for</b> <b>the</b> rest of that season but had to find a new ground <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> season. <b>Several</b> {{locations}} were considered but fell through for various reasons. An alternative was offered by the Midland Railway Company but it did not meet the requirements of the club.|$|R
5|$|Cecil {{and brother}} Godfrey were {{elected to the}} board of {{directors}} of HBT in early 1884 (Godfrey as Vice-President and Cecil as Auditor), and by the end of the year, Godfrey had become President. By January 1886, Godfrey was both President and Treasurer, and Cecil Vice-President, positions they would hold <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>several</b> years.|$|E
5|$|During this time, {{women were}} also given a more {{official}} standing. The Texas Legislature in 1911 {{refused to give}} A permission to hold a summer semester unless women were also permitted to attend. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>several</b> decades during the summers cadets {{were not required to}} be in uniform and women could attend class and participate in intramural activities.|$|E
5|$|<b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>several</b> days, Japanese forces {{launched}} {{air raids}} {{to counter the}} incursion. These included the first widespread use of the kamikaze suicide attack. Several days later, U.S. submarines in the South China Sea spotted two Japanese forces on approach: five battleships steaming toward San Bernardino Strait, and another force of four Japanese carriers in northern Luzon.|$|E
5000|$|Everard {{left the}} company {{at this point and}} {{continued}} to work <b>for</b> only <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>several</b> months; her last recorded appearance was as Aunt Priscilla de Montmorency in Frederick Marshall's comic opera Lola in January 1881. [...] She died in London {{little more than a year}} later, on 22 February 1882, at the age of 37, apparently having never completely recovered from the accident, although some sources report that she died of consumption. Her husband, George William Darley Beswick, survived her.|$|R
50|$|A hangar <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{base was}} built in 1932. Badly damaged in 1934 by a fire which also {{destroyed}} several planes, it was repaired and used <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> 20 years. <b>Several</b> temporary buildings, including barracks for enlisted men, were added during World War II.|$|R
50|$|Recent {{economic}} growth is also turning Russellville into a regional shopping and dining destination, with new restaurants and businesses popping regularly along a new shopping center and hotel, featuring a convention center set <b>for</b> construction within <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>several</b> years; though both projects are running behind schedule, they are still moving forward.|$|R
5|$|In 1915, the {{reformed}} Canton Bulldogs signed former Olympian and Carlisle Indian School standout Jim Thorpe to a contract. Thorpe became {{the face of}} professional football <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>several</b> years and {{was present at the}} founding of the National Football League five years later.|$|E
5|$|Returning to {{civilian}} life, he resumed his farming career, but in 1948 became a priest. He shifted around {{the lower half}} of the North Island <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>several</b> years, serving in a number of churches. He was also a chaplain in the Territorial Force. He retired from the priesthood in 1981 and died eight years later at the age of 73.|$|E
5|$|An area of {{convection}} {{acquired a}} closed circulation and became Tropical Depression One-C on August 22. It stayed disorganized <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>several</b> days. It organized more fully and intensified into {{a tropical storm}} on August 25 and was named Alika. After peaking as a moderately strong tropical storm on August 25, wind shear caused by the pre-Ele tropical depression and an upper-level low near Hawaii weakened the storm to a depression on August 27. Alika dissipated the next day, having never threatened land.|$|E
50|$|At {{the end of}} {{the club}} season, Santa Cruz had been removed from Paraguay's 2016 Copa América squad due to a knee problem; his loan with Málaga had concluded; and Mexican club Cruz Azul had communicated that Santa Cruz was not {{returning}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> season. <b>Several</b> days later, one of the directors of Santa Cruz's former club Olimpia, Ricardo Tavarelli (also the player's brother in-law), announced that he had spoken with Santa Cruz in relation to the player's possible return to the club.|$|R
5000|$|In fact, {{a typical}} GC {{analysis}} takes much more time; sometimes a single sample must be run {{more than an}} hour according to the chosen program; and even more time is needed to [...] "heat out" [...] the column so it is free from the first sample and can be used <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next.</b> Equally, <b>several</b> runs are needed to confirm the results of a study - a GC analysis of a single sample may simply yield a result per chance (see statistical significance).|$|R
25|$|Oil {{companies}} {{including the}} supermajors {{have begun to}} fund research into alternative fuel. BP has invested {{half a billion dollars}} <b>for</b> research over <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>several</b> years. <b>The</b> motivations behind such moves are to acquire the patent rights as well as understanding the technology so vertical integration of the future industry could be achieved.|$|R
5|$|Banned {{from the}} palace and shunned {{by his own}} father, <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>several</b> years the Prince of Wales was {{identified}} with opposition to George I's policies, which included measures designed to increase religious freedom in Great Britain and expand Hanover's German territories {{at the expense of}} Sweden. His new London residence, Leicester House, became a frequent meeting place for his father's political opponents, including Sir Robert Walpole and Viscount Townshend, who had left the government in 1717.|$|E
5|$|Bolt got {{his first}} {{victories}} of the deployment on 23 September {{when he was with}} a flight of 15 VMF-214 aircraft escorting B-24 Liberators back from a raid on Kahili. The bombers had been followed by 20 to 30 Zeros, and a dogfight quickly ensued. During the course of the engagement over Bougainville, Bolt scored two victories. His wingman, Ed Harper, also claimed a victory. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>several</b> weeks, the squadron operated out of Munda in the Solomon Islands.|$|E
5|$|Both Frank Black and Teenager of the Year were {{critically}} well received, {{although they}} enjoyed limited commercial success. In 1995, Thompson left his long-time labels 4AD and Elektra. In 1996, he released The Cult of Ray on Rick Rubin's American Recordings; the album marked a {{turn away from}} the elaborate production of his first solo works and was recorded primarily live with few overdubs. His band for this album featured sole Teenager holdover Lyle Workman on lead guitar, along with bassist David McCaffrey and Scott Boutier on drums. Though the album was neither critically nor commercially successful, its stripped-down approach would increasingly define Thompson's working methods <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>several</b> years.|$|E
25|$|Von Meck {{also knew}} that Tchaikovsky was often in need of cash, despite the large sums she gave him. Tchaikovsky was a poor manager of money and would ask her <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> year's {{allowance}} <b>several</b> months in advance. Knowing of this habit, she might have anticipated his needing the money.|$|R
5000|$|On Thursday November 21, 2013, fans {{received}} word through Twitter from several group members {{that the group}} would reunite and be planning a tour <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> year. <b>Several</b> videos have hit the web showing the group recording material for an upcoming new album. The group plans to release the album before the tour kicks off and in doing so, signed with BMG Rights Management. On May 26, 2014, Day26 releases their first single called [...] "Bullshit" [...] off their upcoming EP entitled [...] "The Return", that is set to release on June 26, 2014.|$|R
50|$|The raft {{provided}} by the aircraft was his only form of shelter <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> 10 days. <b>Several</b> times, Franz unsuccessfully attempted {{to attract the attention}} of various tankers and passing aircraft by firing his signal pistol. In order to escape the heat he would usually swim in the water during midday.|$|R
5|$|<b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>several</b> miles, NY33 runs {{parallel}} to the Thruway and very close to it, with both roads visible from the other. Much of this section of Lancaster has remained rural in character; however, that began {{to change in the}} mid-1990s when Tops Friendly Markets, the regional supermarket chain headquartered in nearby Williamsville, chose a site near the Gunnville Road intersection for a major distribution center. It necessitated the widening of the highway and construction of a traffic light and turn lanes at its entrance.|$|E
5|$|<b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>several</b> months, Davis' unit {{undertook}} {{patrol and}} escort missions in the Cape Gloucester area {{and around the}} islands of Saidor, Manus, and Momote. Through May, these actions were relatively uneventful, except for one fighter sweep mission from Wewak. Davis flew 69 missions from May to August, including several dive-bombing attacks on Japanese positions on Hansa Bay. Davis then flew another 40 missions from September to November, including six patrols between Wakde Island and Hollandia. On November 14, Davis was promoted to the temporary rank of captain.|$|E
5|$|<b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>several</b> {{years he}} would {{serve on the}} always-virulent {{south-eastern}} border, where he made {{his home in the}} city of Illńce. In 1644 under Koniecpolski he took part in the battle of Ochmatów where Commonwealth forces dealt a crushing defeat to Toğay bey's (Tuhaj Bej) Tatars. He served as one of seven pułkowniks in Koniecpolski's army, and once again his cavalry unit charge proved to be a decisive moment of the battle, bringing him much fame. That year he also became a regimentarz in his own light cavalry unit, but he still held the rank of a porucznik of hussars.|$|E
5000|$|In 1885, Harriman {{acquired}} [...] "Arden", the 7863 acre Parrott family {{estate in}} the Ramapo Highlands near Tuxedo, New York, <b>for</b> $52,500. Over <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>several</b> years he purchased almost 40 different nearby parcels of land, adding 20000 acre, and connected all of them with 40 mi of bridle paths. His 100000 sq ft residence, Arden House, was completed only seven months before he died.|$|R
2500|$|The school began {{offering}} an expanded choice of degree {{programs at the}} same time that the state legislature and the United States Department of Agriculture established several services at Texas A [...] The college was unprepared <b>for</b> <b>the</b> ensuing population growth. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> ten years, <b>several</b> hundred students lived in tents in a field in the middle of campus.|$|R
5000|$|The convention's delegates {{were elected}} by the party's riding associations, along with the party's youth, campus and women's associations. There were also {{numerous}} ex officio delegates, including PC Members of Parliament, defeated candidates from the previous election, members of provincial legislatures, members of the party's national executive and the executives of provincial parties affiliated to the federal party. Delegates cast secret ballots, so their votes were not [...] "tied" [...] to any candidate. After each ballot, the candidate winning the fewest votes was removed from <b>the</b> ballot <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> round. <b>Several</b> candidates withdrew voluntarily {{when it became clear}} that they would not be able to win.|$|R
5|$|<b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>several</b> years, Elliott {{moved around}} {{a number of}} parishes in the lower North Island. He also spent periods of time at the City Mission in Wellington. He {{was present at the}} {{unveiling}} of the Alamein Memorial in Egypt in 1954, and two years later attended VC centenary celebrations in London. In 1967, he co-authored a book of his life, From Cowshed to Dog Collar. He retired from the priesthood in April 1981 and moved to Raumati.|$|E
5|$|Gerhard Heilmann {{discussed}} Beebe's Tetrapteryx hypothesis at considerable {{length in}} his 1926 book The Origin of Birds. Heilmann examined hatchlings {{of many other}} bird species, both closely related to those studied by Beebe and belonging to more primitive species, in hope of finding additional evidence for the leg-wings which Beebe had documented. After failing to find such evidence, Heilmann ultimately rejected Beebe's Tetrapteryx hypothesis, and this remained the consensus among ornithologists <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>several</b> decades. Beebe, however, continued to advance his Tetrapteryx hypothesis {{as late as the}} 1940s.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, Bickford went 16–11 with a 4.25 {{earned run}} average and made the National League All-Star team. He {{finished}} seventh {{in the league in}} complete games (15) and third in games started (36) behind teammate Warren Spahn and Ken Raffensberger of the Cincinnati Reds. He lost a no-hitter in the ninth inning in one of those games. At season's end Bickford, alongside Spahn and teammate Johnny Sain created one of the most formidable pitching trios in the league <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>several</b> years.|$|E
50|$|After the {{restoration}} of the English monarchy in 1660, new houses began to spring up in the West End to accommodate Charles II's courtiers. Piccadilly {{was little more than a}} country lane, but the land to the north of it was just beginning to be used <b>for</b> housing; <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>several</b> decades would see the development the whole of this area, which was to become London's leading aristocratic residential district, Mayfair. Two other celebrated mansions were built close to Hyde's at around the same time. To the east Sir John Denham was building the house that later became Burlington House, and to the west Lord Berkeley was building Berkeley House, later Devonshire House.|$|R
40|$|Since 1973 technological, political, regulatory, and {{economic}} {{forces have been}} changing the worldwide economy in a fashion comparable to the changes experienced {{during the nineteenth century}} Industrial Revolution. As in the nineteenth century, we are experiencing declining costs, increaing average (but decreasing marginal) productivity of labor, reduced growth rates of labor income, excess capacity, and <b>the</b> requirement <b>for</b> downsizing and exit. The last two decades indicate corporate internal control systems have failed to deal effectively with these changes, especially slow growth and <b>the</b> requirement <b>for</b> exit. <b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>several</b> decades pose a major challenge for Western firms and political systems as these forces continue to work their way through the worldwide economy...|$|R
50|$|<b>For</b> {{approximately}} <b>the</b> <b>next</b> hour, <b>several</b> heading deviations up to 30 degrees {{were made}} by the pilot of Doe 11 to circumnavigate the weather associated with a front in this area. Turbulence was moderate. It is estimated from study of weather and Doe 11 pilot and navigator interviews that 7 or 8 minutes were lost during this frontal penetration due to these heading deviations.|$|R
