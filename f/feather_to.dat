5|$|Feathers become abraded {{over time}} and all birds need to replace them at intervals. Barn owls are {{particularly}} dependent {{on their ability to}} fly quietly and manoeuvre efficiently, and in temperate areas their prolonged moult lasts through three phases over a period of two years. The female starts to moult while incubating the eggs and brooding the chicks, a time when the male feeds her so she does not need to fly much. The first primary <b>feather</b> <b>to</b> be shed is the central one, number 6, and it has regrown completely by the time the female resumes hunting. Feathers 4, 5, 7 and 8 are dropped at a similar time the following year and feathers 1, 2, 3, 9 and 10 in the bird's third year of adulthood. The secondary and tail feathers are lost and replaced over a similar timescale, again starting while incubation is taking place. In the case of the tail, the two outermost tail feathers are first shed followed by the two central ones, the other tail feathers being moulted the following year.|$|E
500|$|Various interpretations {{have been}} {{suggested}} for the feather present at the opening and conclusion of the film. Sarah Lyall of The New York Times noted several suggestions made about the feather: [...] "Does the white feather symbolize the unbearable lightness of being? Forrest Gump's impaired intellect? The randomness of experience?" [...] Hanks interpreted the feather as: [...] "Our destiny is only defined by {{how we deal with}} the chance elements to our life and that's kind of the embodiment of the feather as it comes in. Here is this thing that can land anywhere and that it lands at your feet. It has theological implications that are really huge." [...] Sally Field compared the <b>feather</b> <b>to</b> fate, saying: [...] "It blows in the wind and just touches down here or there. Was it planned or was it just perchance?" [...] Visual effects supervisor Ken Ralston compared the <b>feather</b> <b>to</b> an abstract painting: [...] "It can mean so many things to so many different people." ...|$|E

[...] According to choreographer Hermes Pan, Astaire lost his temper and yelled at Rogers, who promptly burst into tears, whereupon her mother, Lela, [...] "came charging at him like a mother rhinoceros protecting her young." ...|$|E
500|$|... "A Song for Simeon" [...] is not {{considered}} by scholars and critics {{to be one of}} Eliot's significant poems. It is thus overshadowed by his comparatively better known works of the period—"The Hollow Men" [...] (1925), written before his conversion; and [...] "The Journey of the Magi" [...] (1927), [...] "Ash Wednesday" [...] (1930), and the later, more substantial Four Quartets (1943), written after his conversion. However, in [...] "A Song for Simeon" [...] and these poems, Eliot continues the progression of his themes of alienation in a changing world, and fuses with this the tenets of his newfound faith. Scofield states that the imagery of [...] "A Song for Simeon"—including the symbol of a feather, its setting amid Roman hyacinths and the winter sun—conveys [...] "a sense of wonder and fragile new life". Robin Griffith-Jones draws a connection between Eliot's image of the <b>feather</b> <b>to</b> a statement by Hildegard of Bingen comparing herself [...] "to 'a feather which lacks all weight and strength and flies through the wind'; so she was borne up by God. But Eliot's speaker, still waiting for the wind to blow, imagines only the death wind that will bear him away".|$|E
500|$|Sitting Bull {{was born}} on land later {{included}} in the Dakota Territory. In 2007, Sitting Bull's great-grandson asserted from family oral tradition that Sitting Bull was born along the Yellowstone River, south of present-day Miles City, Montana. He was named Jumping Badger at birth, and nicknamed Hunkesi, or [...] "Slow," [...] said to describe his careful and unhurried nature. [...] When the boy was fourteen years old he accompanied a group of Lakota warriors (which included {{his father and his}} uncle Four Horns) in a raiding party to take horses from a camp of Crow warriors. Jumping Badger displayed bravery by riding forward and counting coup on one of the surprised Crow, which was witnessed by the other mounted Lakota. [...] Upon returning to camp his father gave a celebratory feast at which he conferred his own name upon his son. [...] The name, Tȟatȟáŋka Íyotake, [...] which in the Lakota language means [...] "Buffalo Bull Who Sits Down", would later be abbreviated to [...] "Sitting Bull". [...] Thereafter, Sitting Bull's father was known as Jumping Bull. [...] At this ceremony before the entire band, Sitting Bull's father presented his son with an eagle <b>feather</b> <b>to</b> wear in his hair, a warrior's horse, and a hardened buffalo hide shield to mark his son's passage into manhood as a Lakota warrior.|$|E

2500|$|The volume {{consists}} of 46 pieces {{of poetry and}} essays. The subjects Jackson writes about are primarily children, animals and the environment. For example, one specific poem titled Look Again, Baby Seal promotes environmentalism as Jackson imagines anthropomorphic seals who brood {{about the fate of}} being killed by hunters. Another poem (So the Elephants March) presents elephants that refuse to be killed in order for ivory pieces to be made from their tusks. A third piece (Mother Earth) describes a struggle to cope with the discovery of an oil-covered seagull <b>feather.</b> <b>To</b> stress the theme of environmentalism and the necessity for action, Jackson writes in the essay: [...] "We've been treating Mother Earth the way some people treat a rental apartment.

2500|$|Despite its {{popularity}} {{from in the}} late Mesoamerican period into the early colonial period, few vestiges with this technique survive into the 21st century. [...] One {{reason for this is}} the care needed to maintain the pieces. It is important to know the characteristics of each type of <b>feather</b> <b>to</b> use and preserve them correctly. The best feathers to use are those that have been molted, as they have less organic materials and less likely to deteriorate. [...] A feather object can last indefinitely if it is preserved in a hermetically sealed case of inert gas, with a fixed humidity, darkness and low temperature. However, this renders the piece unobservable. These objects can be exhibited in galleries, museums and private collections with minimal decay if temperature and humidity are controlled and light kept to a minimum.|$|E
