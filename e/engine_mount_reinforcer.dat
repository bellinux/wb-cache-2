40|$|<b>Engine</b> <b>mounting</b> {{is one of}} the {{important}} components in a vehicle to isolate noise and vibration generated by the engine from the driver and passenger. There are three main types of <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> such as passive <b>engine</b> <b>mounting,</b> semi-active <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> and active <b>engine</b> <b>mounting.</b> The price of the mounting in the market range from the cheapest which is passive <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> to the most expensive type of <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> which is the active <b>engine</b> <b>mounting.</b> The effectiveness of the <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> vary with the price of the <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> with the passive <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> being the low quality isolation of noise, vibration and harshness (NVH) and the active <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> being the highest quality isolation of NVH. In order to reduce the vibrations, noise and harshness (NVH) level for vehicles, understanding about the vibration characteristics of the passive <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> in detail is crucial. The objective of this project is to analyze the vibration cause by the engine of a Perodua Kenari on the <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> system at different engine revolutions per minute (rpm). The experiment is carried out on a stationary vehicle using DasyLab software. Here, analysis on the vibration obtained from the experiment carried out helps to determine the time response and frequency response of the engine at different rpm. From the results obtained, we can understand the characteristics of the passive <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> which is the fundamental of <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> among the three types. By understanding the characteristics of the passive <b>engine</b> <b>mounting,</b> improvement can be made on the <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> in a low cost method to further improve on the NVH isolation qualit...|$|R
40|$|The dynamic {{properties}} of <b>engine</b> <b>mount</b> influence {{the performance of}} the <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> system. The frequency-dependent properties represented the more accurate properties of the <b>engine</b> <b>mount</b> as opposed to the frequency-independent properties model. Impact technique in the past has been used to measure the dynamic driving point stiffness in the axial position which omitted the shear properties. In this research, the impact technique is extended to measure the global {{dynamic properties}} including the dynamic shear stiffness of the <b>engine</b> <b>mount</b> [...] When the <b>engine</b> <b>mount</b> is oriented in certain angles, the combination effect of dynamic compression stiffness and dynamic shear stiffness altered the global dynamic properties of the <b>engine</b> <b>mount.</b> A transformation technique is developed to include both of the dynamic stiffnesses and used them to determine the global dynamic properties of <b>engine</b> <b>mount.</b> Three different types of <b>engine</b> <b>mounts</b> are used to validate the application of the developed technique. Finally, optimization was carried out to demonstrate the effect of the global dynamic properties based on the frequency-dependent properties of <b>engine</b> <b>mount.</b> The optimum locations and orientation angles of each individual mount are identified to minimize the mean force transmissibility of the <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> system. The reduction of the force transmissibility showed that optimization based on the frequency-independent properties underestimated the peak transmissibility...|$|R

40|$|The vehicle <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> system, which {{consists}} of several <b>mounts</b> connecting the <b>engine</b> to the vehicle structure, not only supports {{the weight of the}} engine but also isolates the noise, vibration and the transmitted forces to the vehicle structure. At present conventional elastomeric mounts are widely used in <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> systems for commercial vehicles. However, these mounts cannot fulfill the conflicting characteristic requirements for the best isolation concerning both road and engine induced vibrations. Therefore, to improve the noise and vibration isolation of commercial vehicles it is necessary to go beyond traditional passive isolators and use semi-active or active vibration control systems due to their capabilities of addressing the conflicting requirements in different road and engine conditions. The aim of the research presented in this thesis is to first develop mathematical and computational models of elastomeric <b>engine</b> <b>mounts</b> for heavy trucks and investigate the nonlinear behavior of dynamic stiffness and damping of the mounts, and finally use the developed models to design and analyze an adaptronic <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> system. Adaptronic <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> system is referred to a mounting system where actuators, sensors and controller are optimally incorporated in the conventional elastomeric mounting system. The developed computational model of the <b>engine</b> <b>mounts</b> is implemented in Matlab/ Simulink and used in a 3 D engine model with which vibration dynamics analysis under different engine and realistic road inputs is conducted. Moreover, the possibility and advantages of using active <b>engine</b> <b>mounts</b> have been studied by incorporating actuators into the above mentioned 3 D engine model with conventional mounting system for heavy trucks. Simulations of the engine vibration dynamics under similar engine and road excitations have been done for the adaptronic mounting system and compared to the results from the conventional <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> system. The results of simulations of engine vibration dynamics and transmitted forces to the vehicle structure have shown good potential for vibration isolation improvement in heavy trucks by using adaptronic <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> systems...|$|R

40|$|Hydraulic <b>engine</b> <b>mounts,</b> {{consisting}} of an elastomeric part {{and an additional}} hydraulic damping mechanism, became generally accepted in the automotive industry within the last decades. For a target sound design of the interior noise of a passenger car, the transfer paths from the engine via the <b>engine</b> <b>mounts</b> into the passenger compartment play an important role.
