5|$|Many {{elements}} can {{be considered}} as tributes to the power of cinema. In the prison theater, the inmates watch the film Gilda (1946), but this scene was originally intended to feature The Lost Weekend (1945). The interchangeability of the films used in the prison theater suggests that it is the cinematic experience and not the subject which <b>is</b> <b>key</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> scene, allowing the men to escape the reality of their situation. Immediately following this scene, Andy is assaulted by the Sisters in the projector room and uses a film reel to help fight them off. Then in the end of the film, Andy passes through a movie poster to escape his cell and ultimately Shawshank.|$|E
5|$|Kratos {{continues}} his ascent, murdering powerful foes {{that include the}} Titan Perses and the god Helios, which causes the sun to disappear, plunging the world into eternal darkness. This leads to an encounter with Hermes, who mocks Kratos for his past sins. The Spartan chases the god, who leads him to the Chamber of the Flame. Kratos discovers that Pandora's Box is in the Flame of Olympus and <b>is</b> <b>key</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> success of his quest, {{as it was in}} God of War. Athena appears, telling Kratos that the flames around the box can only be quelled by Pandora. Kratos then continues after the overconfident Hermes, whom he catches and kills, releasing a plague. At the Forum, he has an audience with the drunken Hera, who ignores his request for Pandora's location and summons Hercules. After discussing his jealousy of his half-brother, Hercules attacks Kratos and is killed. Kratos then encounters Aphrodite, who is indifferent to his war on Olympus. She then leads him to her estranged husband Hephaestus through Hyperion's Gate, a teleportation device. In a suicide mission, the blacksmith sends Kratos to Tartarus to retrieve the Omphalos Stone so he can forge a new weapon for the Spartan. Kratos finds Cronos, kills the Titan for the stone, and returns to Hephaestus. After forging the weapon, the god tries to kill Kratos himself. Instead, the Spartan kills Hephaestus, who claims {{that he was trying to}} protect his daughter Pandora, who was imprisoned in the Labyrinth after Kratos opened her box. Reusing the Hyperion Gate, the Spartan travels through Hera's Gardens where he kills the taunting goddess, ending all plant life, and makes his way to the Labyrinth to find Pandora.|$|E

25|$|The annual {{consumption}} of antimony(III) oxide in the United States and Europe is approximately 10,000 and 25,000 tonnes, respectively. The main application is as flame retardant synergist {{in combination with}} halogenated materials. The combination of the halides and the antimony <b>is</b> <b>key</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> flame-retardant action for polymers, helping to form less flammable chars. Such flame retardants are found in electrical apparatuses, textiles, leather, and coatings.|$|E
25|$|Actin’s {{cytoskeleton}} <b>is</b> <b>key</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{processes of}} endocytosis, cytokinesis, determination of cell polarity and morphogenesis in yeasts. In addition to relying on actin these processes involve 20 or 30 associated proteins, which {{all have a}} high degree of evolutionary conservation, along with many signalling molecules. Together these elements allow a spatially and temporally modulated assembly that defines a cell’s response to both internal and external stimuli.|$|E

25|$|In the {{processing}} of edible oils, the oil is heated under vacuum to near the smoke point, and water is introduced {{at the bottom of}} the oil. The water immediately is converted to steam, which bubbles through the oil, carrying with it any chemicals which are water-soluble. The steam sparging removes impurities that can impart unwanted flavors and odors to the oil. Deodorization <b>is</b> <b>key</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> manufacture of vegetable oils. Nearly all soybean, corn, and canola oils found on supermarket shelves go through a deodorization stage that removes trace amounts of odors and flavors, and lightens the color of the oil.|$|E

Mexico {{is the only}} Latin American country to be {{ranked in the top}} 10 {{worldwide}} in the number of tourist visits. It received by far the largest number of international tourists, with 35 million visitors in 2016, followed by Brazil, with 6.6 million; the Dominican Republic, with 6 million; Chile, with 5.6 million; Argentina, with 5.5 million; Cuba with 4 million; Puerto Rico with 3.7 million; Peru with 3.7 million; and Colombia, with 3.3 million. The World Tourism Organization reports the following destinations as the top six tourism earners for the year 2016: Mexico, with US$19,571 million; the Dominican Republic, with US$6,723 million; Brazil, with US$6,024 million; Colombia, with US$4,773 million; Argentina, with US$4,687 million; and Panama, with US$4,258 million.|$|E

500|$|Ytterbium clocks {{hold the}} record for {{stability}} with ticks stable to within less than two parts in 1 quintillion (...) [...] The clocks developed at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) rely on about 10,000 rare-earth atoms cooled to 10 microkelvin (10 millionths of a degree above absolute zero) and trapped in an optical lattice—a series of pancake-shaped wells made of laser light. Another laser that [...] "ticks" [...] 518 trillion times per second provokes a transition between two energy levels in the atoms.

500|$|Success {{or failure}} of {{implants}} depends {{on the health of}} the person receiving the treatment, drugs which affect the chances of osseointegration, and the health of the tissues in the mouth. The amount of stress that will be put on the implant and fixture during normal function is also evaluated. Planning the position and number of implants <b>is</b> <b>key</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> long-term health of the prosthetic since biomechanical forces created during chewing can be significant. The position of implants is determined by the position and angle of adjacent teeth, by lab simulations or by using computed tomography with CAD/CAM simulations and surgical guides called stents. The prerequisites for long-term success of osseointegrated dental implants are healthy bone and gingiva. Since both can atrophy after tooth extraction, pre-prosthetic procedures such as sinus lifts or gingival grafts are sometimes [...] required to recreate ideal bone and gingiva.|$|E
500|$|The End of the Road is {{the only}} work of Barth's to have been adapted to film. [...] Director Aram Avakian's loose {{adaptation}} [...] (1970) stars James Earl Jones, Stacy Keach and Harris Yulin in their earliest feature roles. [...] Graphic scenes earned the film an X rating, {{such as those of}} the botched abortion and of what Barth calls a [...] "man rapes chicken" [...] scene not found in the book. [...] Barth and critics widely panned the movie; Barth wrote disdainfully about it in the introduction to the 1988 single-volume edition of The Floating Opera and The End of the Road. [...] Academics Ken Pellow and Rita Hug opined that the linguistic, literary and philosophical aspects of the book made it difficult to adapt; they argued that Jake Horner's frequent speaking to the reader <b>is</b> <b>key</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> book's effectiveness but does not lend itself to film.|$|E

500|$|Dan Martin of The Guardian singles out {{the scene}} where Gwen and Rhys become stowaways in Children of Earth as [...] "just lovely" [...] and [...] "a credit to both actors, {{particularly}} Kai Owen, who has finally made Rhys likable", whilst IGN writer Asham Haque also feels that Rhys' [...] "meatier role" [...] provides [...] "some great sequences" [...] for the couple. Rawson-Jones speaks favourably on Owen's role in the overall ensemble opining that he, along with Barrowman, Myles and David-Lloyd managed to guide the audience through the serial with [...] "panache and verve". The Chicago Tribune Maureen Ryan feels that the initiated Rhys <b>is</b> <b>key</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> show, and is a [...] "very enjoyable character", describing his appeal to government PA Lois Habiba {{to pay for his}} and Gwen's dinner as [...] "priceless". Speaking of the show's fourth series premiere, Simon Brew highlights the central returning trio of Barrowman, Myles and Owen as the show's most engaging actors, and further describes Owen's performance as mixing [...] "humour with an earnest, and a real sense of drive".|$|E
500|$|When {{designing}} the game's main setting, the team {{moved away from}} the traditional enclosed Japanese mansions from previous games in favor of somewhere that blended Eastern and Western architectural tastes to create different gameplay opportunities, described in-game as a Meiji-era hotel. Traditional mansion settings were also included, with more locations being present than in previous games. The color yellow was chosen as the game's image color, while the key words used to describe the plot were [...] "memory", [...] "moon" [...] and [...] "mask". The subtitle refers to the mask that <b>is</b> <b>key</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Kagura Dance Ritual. The mask in turn tied into story themes of the phases of the moon, the nature of memory, and music. During development, Shibata and Kikuchi felt that Grasshopper and Nintendo's involvement helped them reevaluate the series formula and try out new things. After development, Kikuchi said that the three companies' varying ideas on the project made the development [...] "a complete and utter mess", though it ultimately worked out well. The characters were designed by Takeyasu Sawaki, who had previously worked in that capacity on Ōkami and [...] The music was composed by Masafumi Takada and Etsuko Ichikawa. As with the previous two games, Mask of the Lunar Eclipse features songs by Japanese singer Tsuki Amano: the theme song [...] "Zero Tuning", and the ending theme [...] "Noise".|$|E
500|$|Alex Thompson, the episode's sound recordist, {{arranged}} the phones {{so that the}} actors could {{speak to each other}} in real-time. Pemberton and Shearsmith wanted this so that the voices would not have to be recorded in a studio later and added in ADR. The voice of [...] "Chloe"—the identity of whom <b>is</b> <b>key</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> story—presented a particular technical challenge, as the writers wanted to ensure that her identity was not revealed the first time her voice is heard. First, the production team recorded Shearsmith playing George-as-Chloe, and then a number of actresses recorded their versions of Shearsmith playing George-as-Chloe. Of these, one—Hall—was chosen to lend her voice to Chloe. Shearsmith then re-recorded his voice, imitating Hall's version of George-as-Chloe. Hall and Shearsmith's respective performances of George-as-Chloe could then be merged together for the final episode. The first time viewers hear [...] "Chloe", her voice is mostly Hall's; as the episode progresses, more of Shearsmith's voice is audible. For Shearsmith, this did not represent the production team cheating the viewers, as viewers' experiences are filtered through Andy's experiences. The first time viewers hear Chloe, they—like Andy—experience her as a teenage girl. As most of the episode was filmed in real-time, George is visible making calls as Chloe, meaning that he hides in plain sight. Footage of Shearsmith playing George-as-Chloe in George's office—used in the final episode—was filmed separately {{to the rest of the}} episode, as a camera set-up in George's office would have been visible on one of the main cameras.|$|E
