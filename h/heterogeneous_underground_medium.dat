This is done in order to adapt the electrical design of hospital infrastructure extensions. The system consists of a network of overhead power distribution and other <b>underground.</b> The <b>medium</b> voltage network of 34. 5 KV hospital requires the installation of two new transformers for the new burdens that are needed in the Emergency Service.

40|$|A set of fault {{location}} algorithms for <b>underground</b> <b>medium</b> voltage cables, two incipient fault detection schemes for distribution cables {{and a state}} estimation method for underground distribution networks are developed in this thesis. Two schemes are designed to detect and classify incipient faults in underground distribution cables. Based on the methodology of wavelet analysis, one scheme is to detect the fault-induced transients, and therefore identify the incipient faults. Based on {{the analysis of the}} superimposed fault current and negative sequence current in time domain, the other scheme is particularly suitable to detect the single-line-to-ground incipient faults, which are mostly occurring in underground cables. To verify the effectiveness and functionalities of the proposed detection algorithms, different fault conditions, various system configurations, real field cases and normal operating transients are examined. The simulation results have demonstrated a technical feasibility for practical implementations of both schemes. Based on the methodology of the direct circuit analysis, a set of location algorithms is proposed to locate the single phase related faults in the typical <b>underground</b> <b>medium</b> voltage cables. A large number of complex nonlinear equations are effectively solved to find the fault distance and fault resistance. The algorithms only utilize the fundamental phasors of three-phase voltages and currents recorded at single end, normally at substation. The various system and fault conditions are taken into account in the development of algorithms, such as effects of shunt capacitance, mutual effects of metallic sheaths, common sheath bonding methods and different fault scenarios. The extensive simulations have validated the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. In order to extend the proposed {{fault location}} algorithms to underground distribution networks, a state estimation algorithm is developed to provide the necessary information for the location algorithms. Taking account of the complexity and particularity of cable circuits, the problem of the state estimation is formulated as a nonlinear optimization problem that is solved by the sequential quadratic programming technique.

The method can shorten the time of RTM with the same accuracy of the traditional RTM imaging. Firstly, devise the multi-scale grid model according to the velocity model; it uses the small-scale grid for the low-speed area and large-scale grid for high-speed area; secondly, calculate the value of each point of the wave field on multi-scale model, especially the points of transition zone; finally, image the underground media according to the RTM imaging condition. The experimental results show that under the condition of the same simulation order, the multi-scale RTM imaging computational efficiency can be promoted by 25.05 % average within this paper.|$|R

This paper intends to investigate the polarisation and conduction mechanisms within water tree degraded cables, paying particular interest to the effect of space charge accumulation at the water tree tip.

Long duration of the water level change in the well {{can be attributed to the}} dispersion property of underground water in the permeable layer around the well. Recently, a proportionality factor between the changes in water level at this well and in ambient volumetric strain was estimated on the basis of the M 2 tidal constituent as 3.42 mm/ 10 − 8 strain (Takahashi et al. 2012). By using this factor, the observed increase in water level of about 3 cm at the AK 1 well was transferred to changes in volumetric strain of about 88 nstrain of compression. Based on our dike model (case 1), the expected change in volumetric strain at Akanko Onsen, about 8 km NE of Meakan-dake volcano, is 18 nstrain of compression. Although this value is about one fifth of the observed value, the theoretical change in strain is fairly consistent with the observed water level change at AK 1 despite the uncertainty of the <b>heterogeneous</b> <b>underground</b> structure. These results also support our simple dike model.|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{interaction}} of seismic waves with a cylindrical tunnel cavity embedded in a semi-infinite poroelastic medium. When seismic waves scatter from an underground tunnel, the magnitude and location of maximum tangential stresses on the tunnel cavity varies upon angle, frequency, and kind of the incident wave. The overburden thickness (depth of the tunnel) and the bulk properties of the surrounding medium also affect the response of such systems to dynamic excitations. Using the Graf's addition theorem for the cylindrical Hankel functions, the multiple-scattering between the tunnel wall and the free surface is expressed in form of infinite series. To model the <b>underground</b> <b>medium,</b> the Biot dynamic model of poroelasticity is employed. A crossover frequency at which the wavelengths become comparable {{to the size of}} the tunnel, the Biot critical frequency, and the crossover frequency at which fluid diffusion length is of the order of the tunnel size are introduced.

40|$|The {{research}} on heat transfer models of geothermal ground heat exchangers (GHEs) of ground-coupled heat pump (GCHP) system has recently advanced greatly. However, {{although it is}} important to optimize the design size of GHEs for reducing the total length of GHEs, the optimization of GHEs by means of models is a little. This paper describes the interior simulation models of borehole in which single U-tube and double U-tubes are each buried. The analytical solutions concerning the borehole's exterior heat transfer are given. All the factors that exert influences on the design size of GHEs are described {{based on the results of}} the heat transfer models. These significant parameters consist of the centre to centre distance of the U-tube, thermal conductivity of the backfill material, distance of adjacent boreholes, types of circulating liquid or <b>underground</b> <b>medium,</b> arrangement of boreholes, and the minimum temperature of the circulating liquid which enters the heat pump. Using the simulation models and computer programming, the influence degrees of the above factors are discussed in terms of the adoption of different values or types.

40|$|Quantifying {{groundwater}} recharge in crystalline rocks presents great difficulties {{due to the}} high heterogeneity of the <b>underground</b> <b>medium</b> (mainly, due to heterogeneity in fracture network, which determines hydraulic parameters of the bedrock like hydraulic conductivity or effective porosity). Traditionally these rocks have been considered to have very low permeability, and their groundwater resources have usually been neglected; however, they can be of local importance when the bedrock presents a net of well-developed fractures. The current European Water Framework Directive requires an efficient management of all groundwater resources; this begins with a proper knowledge of the aquifer and accurate recharge estimation. In this study, an assessment of groundwater resources in the Spanish hydrologic district of Galicia-Costa, dominated by granitic and metasedimentary rocks, was carried out.

These so-called energy piles include heat exchange pipes already cast into the pile foundation to produce a new type of GHE. Groundwater seepage, by means of advection, {{plays an important role in}} improving the heat transfer performance of energy pile. Existing research has studied heat transfer mechanism of energy pile when groundwater is considered to flow in one direction only, and in two directions also. No studies, however, have been introduced explaining the effects of three-dimensional (3 -D) groundwater seepage (i. e. in three directions) on the heat transfer between pile and <b>underground</b> <b>medium.</b> This paper presents a new mathematical model about the heat transfer of energy pile with 3 -D groundwater seepage, whereby the analytical temperature responses solutions induced by both infinite and finite models are obtained.

In addition, the characteristics involved in the new model were explored and then the factors exerting influence on heat transfer are described.

We have investigated {{the correlations between the}} hydrogeochemical data and the areal seismicity represented by the k s values (k s is a function of magnitude and hypocentral distance) of the earthquakes. At first we smoothed the raw hydrogeochemical data using a semi-triangle weight function. Then we compared the trends of each smoothed hydrogeochemical parameter with the k s trend using a running cross-correlation function with a maximum lag of ± 30 days and the main result was that, sometimes, we found 0. 7 ? 0. 4 cross-correlation coefficients with no lag for flow rate and with + (10 ? 15) days lags for some ion and gas contents. The correlation is positive, i. e. flow rate and ion and gas contents increase when k s increases. This phenomenology could be explained by an underground water pumping produced by some earthquake. We advance the hypothesis that this pumping could be the response of the viscoelastic <b>underground</b> <b>medium</b> of the Koryakskiy volcano to seismic waves. So, sometimes, the supply of elastic energy of the earthquakes may provide the trigger to a catastrophic nucleation of bubbles of this material producing a new melt with a lower density which will tend to expand and cause a pressure increase.

40|$|The air-core coil sensor (ACS) {{is widely}} used as a {{transducer}} to measure the variation in magnetic fields of a helicopter transient electromagnetic (TEM) system. A high periodic emitting current induces the magnetic field signal of the <b>underground</b> <b>medium.</b> However, such current also generates a high primary field signal that can affect the received signal of the ACS and even damage the receiver. To increase the dynamic range of the received signal {{and to protect the}} receiver when emitting current rises/falls, the combination of ACS with magnetic flux compensation structure (bucking coil) is necessary. Moreover, the optimized ACS, which is composed of an air-core coil and a differential pre-amplifier circuit, must be investigated to meet the requirements of the helicopter TEM system suited to rapid surveying for shallow buried metal mine in rough topography. Accordingly, two ACSs are fabricated in this study, and their performance is verified and compared inside a magnetic shielding room. Using the designed ACSs, field experiments are conducted in Baoqing County. The field experimental data show that the primary field response can be compensated when the bucking coil is placed at an appropriate point in the range of allowed shift distance beyond the center of the transmitting coil and that the damage to the receiver induced by the over-statured signal can be solved.

On some stations, the observed seismic levels exceeded design levels recommended by the EC 8 seismic code for buildings and civil engineering works. The ground motions generated by the two mainshocks have specific characteristics: the waveforms are mainly controlled by surface waves generated by the deep sedimentary Po plain, by local site effects and also, on some stations, by non-linear behaviors. In this particular context, we test the ability of an empirical Green’s function (EGF) simulation approach to reproduce the recorded seismograms in a large frequency band without any knowledge of the <b>underground</b> <b>medium.</b> We focus on the possibility to reproduce the strong surface waves generated by the basin at distances between 25 and 90 km. We choose {{to work on the}} second mainshock of the sequence (Mw 5. 9), which occurred on May 29, 2012, because it is better recorded by the seismological networks than the May 20 th first mainshock. We use a k- 2 kinematic source model to generate a set of 100 slip distributions on the fault plane and choose the recordings of a close-by Mw 3. 9 event as EGF. We then generate a set of broad-band seismograms (from 0. 2 to 35 Hz) and compare them to the mainshock signals at 15 stations (Seismograms, Fourier spectra, PGA, PGV, duration, Stockwell Transforms) at epicentral distances from 5 to 160 km. We find that the main specific features of the signals are very well reproduced for all the stations within and beyond the basin.

Despite the potential advantages, the major bottleneck of the MI communication is the limited channel capacity due to the low MI bandwidth. In this paper, the Spread Resonance (RS) strategy is developed for the MI communication in RF-challenged environments which greatly increases the MI channel capacity. Specifically, instead of using the same resonant frequency for all the MI coils, the spread resonance strategy allocates different resonant frequencies for different MI relay and transceiver coils. An optimization solution for the resonant frequency allocation is formulated to maximize the MI channel capacity which captures multiple unique MI effects, including the parasitic capacitor in each MI coil, the Eddy currents in various transmission media with limited conductivities, and the random direction of each coil. Numerical evaluations are provided to validate the significant channel capacity improvements by the proposed SR strategy for MI communication systems.

5000|$|The Danish {{transmission}} system is {{owned and operated}} by Energinet.dk. Energinet.dk was created by a merger of power grid operators Eltra, Elkraft System and Elkraft Transmission, and by natural gas {{transmission system}} operator Gastra. The merger took place on 24 August 2005 with retrospective effect from 1 January 2005. [...] Eltra and Elkraft were communally owned by the respective region's distribution companies. The high-voltage transmission assets were transferred to the Danish State and later to Energinet.dk at no cost. , nearly all low-voltage (<10 kV) power lines run as <b>underground</b> cables. For <b>medium</b> voltage around 50-60 kV 40% are buried, while 25% of high-voltage (132-400 kV) are ground cables. Since 1997, Elkraft and Eltra operated as fully unbundled companies from the power generating companies. , Denmark has about 2-3% transmission losses.|$|R
30|$|RTM {{is based}} on the exact wave {{equation}} rather than its approximation [2]; the time extrapolation is used instead of the depth extrapolation, so it has a good precision. It is not limited by the inclination of the underground structure and the change of the lateral velocity of the medium, and even can the image of the rotary wave [3 – 6]. When the finite difference method is performed for RTM imaging, the selection of the difference order directly affects the imaging precision and the amount of calculation [7 – 9], and the higher the differential order, the more the imaging is accurate, but the amount of RTM is multiplied by the forward and reverse recursion of the wave field [10, 11]. It makes the computer time-consuming, and the storage demand of the full wave field is large. It seriously restricts RTM in the field. In order to solve the above problems, the predecessors have researched related topics. Reference [12] proposes graphics processing unit (GPU) parallel strategy is used to improve the computing efficiency for RTM; this method starts with the hardware and solves the problem of low computing efficiency. Reference [13] proposes the pseudo spectral method which is used {{to solve the problem of}} calculating the spatial derivative, thus improving the computational efficiency of the algorithm. Reference [14] combines the high-order finite difference and boundary conditions to improve the accuracy of the algorithm. Reference [15] used the combination of high calculation efficiency of Kirchhoff integral method of ray shift and reverse time migration to improve the efficiency and accuracy. Reference [16 – 18] proposes an efficient boundary storage strategy of optimizing the random boundary condition and absorbing boundary condition, which can reduce the memory requirement. Reference [19] proposes a reverse time migration method based on the cloud computing to improve the computational efficiency of the algorithm. Reference [20] improves the efficiency of the algorithm from the view of coding and low-order efficiency. The previous work has laid a solid foundation for the subsequent research. In this paper, the RTM algorithm is studied in order to achieve a balance between the improving computing efficiency and the imaging precision. In the discrete analysis of the <b>underground</b> <b>medium,</b> the grid of the same size for the whole model often causes oversampling in the high-speed layer area when the grid is suit for low velocity; if the large grid is used for the whole model, then it can make the low velocity layer and thin layer imaging not clear. So, the paper starts from this problem and designs to use a small-scale mesh in the low velocity layer to make fine imaging, and the large-scale grids are used in the high-velocity layer to avoid oversampling and the amount of computation and memory occupancy also can be reduced. The method can improve the comprehensive efficiency for RTM while the lateral resolution of the migration imaging results is not affected. The experimental results verify the effectiveness of the algorithm in the paper.|$|R
