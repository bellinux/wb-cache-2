5|$|As {{the maids}} of honour are {{reflected}} in each other, so too do {{the king and queen}} have their doubles within the painting, in the <b>dimly</b> <b>lit</b> forms of the chaperone and guard, the two who serve and care for their daughter. The positioning of these figures sets up a pattern, one man, a couple, one man, a couple, and while the outer figures are nearer the viewer than the others, they all occupy the same horizontal band on the picture's surface.|$|E
5|$|The text {{is written}} in gold in Carolingian {{minuscule}} calligraphy, and the gold ink was obtained from an alloy of silver and gold leaf. A few lines or words stand out as they are written in rustic capitals. Over time, the parchment has slightly warped, {{and there is a}} fold {{in the middle of the}} document. It is presented in a permanent exhibition of the State Archives of Lower Saxony in a <b>dimly</b> <b>lit</b> room.|$|E
5|$|In the 3rd century, {{imperial}} mausolea {{began to}} be built as domed rotundas rather than tumulus structures or other types, following similar monuments by private citizens. Pagan and Christian domed mausolea from this time can be differentiated in that the structures of the buildings also reflect their religious functions. The pagan buildings are typically two story, <b>dimly</b> <b>lit,</b> free-standing structures with a lower crypt area for the remains and an upper area for devotional sacrifice. Christian domed mausolea contain a single well-lit space and are usually attached to a church.|$|E
50|$|Access to {{the beach}} is via a track across private farmland. Please respect landowners property. The track was opened in 1983, and is a popular walking track. It descends from 150 m above sea level at its start, a short {{distance}} off Blackhead Road, winding for some 1200 metres {{to the top of}} the tunnel close to a natural sea arch. The tunnel descends 72 steps {{to the beach}}, and is <b>dimly</b> naturally <b>lit.</b> Note that the path down is steep and can be very slippery following wet weather.|$|R
60|$|The rector {{looked at}} the man's wan face, <b>lit</b> <b>dimly</b> {{by the light of}} the shaded lamp, and falling on his knees, began to recite the prayers for the dying. A shiver passed through Lucy. In the {{farmyard}} a cock crew, and in the distance another cock answered cheerily. Lucy put her hand on the good rector's shoulder.|$|R
60|$|The {{great room}} was <b>dimly</b> enough <b>lit,</b> for the windows looking out upon the street were high and heavily curtained, The man who {{sat at the}} desk was almost in the shadow. Yet {{every now and then}} a shaft of {{sunlight}} fell across his pale, worn face. A strange combination this of the worker, the idealist, the man of affairs. From outside came the hum of a great city. At times, too, there came to his ears as he sat here the roar of nations at strife, the fierce underneath battle of the great countries of the world struggling for supremacy. And here at this cabinet this man sat often, and listened, strenuous, romantic, with the heart of a lion and the lofty imagination of an eagle, he steered unswervingly on to her destiny a great people. Others might rest, but never he.|$|R
5|$|Production {{began on}} 3 August 1943. Many {{details about the}} performances, lighting, camera angles, action, and effects were worked out ahead of {{time in order to}} not only keep the film under budget but also help achieve {{suspense}} on such a low budget. Dr. Jared Criswell, former pastor of the Fifth Avenue Spiritualist Church of New York City, served as a technical consultant on the film regarding psychic phenomena. The picture's final fight scene between the Finn, Pollo, and the mad Captain was shot on a <b>dimly</b> <b>lit</b> set to heighten the suspense and keep the audience from guessing who the victor might be, similar to the way Jacques Tourneur and Lewton had shot a similar scene in Cat People.|$|E
5|$|A further {{internal}} diagonal {{passes through}} the space occupied by the Infanta. There is a similar connection between the female dwarf and the figure of Velázquez himself, both of whom look towards the viewer from similar angles, creating a visual tension. The face of Velázquez is <b>dimly</b> <b>lit</b> by light that is reflected, rather than direct. For this reason his features, though not as sharply defined, are more visible {{than those of the}} dwarf who is much nearer the light source. This appearance of a total face, full-on to the viewer, draws the attention, and its importance is marked, tonally, by the contrasting frame of dark hair, the light on the hand and brush, and the skilfully placed triangle of light on the artist's sleeve, pointing directly to the face.|$|E
5|$|The {{video is}} shot in {{black-and-white}} and {{is set in}} a <b>dimly</b> <b>lit</b> and smoky office, where Beyoncé puts on a private show for a detective (played by actor Brett G. Smith). As the clip begins, the detective is gazing out the window. Beyoncé then arrives and stands in an open doorway while rain pours outside. With wavy hair and winged eyeliner, Beyoncé is dressed in a thigh-length leather trench coat and high stockings. After walking inside the office, she immediately strips off her coat. This reveals a satin dress over black panties and thigh-high pantyhose held up by garters. When the music starts, Beyoncé sits on a desk and plays with her hair, her back facing the face of the detective. The latter leans against his desk while watching Beyoncé, who starts to dance sensually on the desk and flips her hair to seduce him. As Beyoncé dances around the armchair, she exposes her vintage-style underwear.|$|E
60|$|The crowd {{converged on}} an archway, {{passed through a}} short throat and emerged on a wider space again, <b>lit</b> <b>dimly.</b> The black figures about him spread out and ran up what seemed in the {{twilight}} to be a gigantic series of steps. He followed. The people dispersed {{to the right and}} left.... He perceived that he was no longer in a crowd. He stopped near the highest step. Before him, on that level, were groups of seats and a little kiosk. He went up to this and, stopping in the shadow of its eaves, looked about him panting.|$|R
60|$|They {{went into}} the cave, having no choice. It was a great place <b>lit</b> <b>dimly</b> by the outer light, and farther down its length with lamps. Looking round her, Rachel saw that its roof was {{supported}} by white columns which she knew to be stalactites, for as a child she had seen their like. At the end of it, where the lamps burned and a fountain bubbled from the ground, rose a very large column shaped like {{the trunk of a}} tree, with branches at the top that looked like the boughs of a tree. Gazing at it Rachel understood why these dwarfs, or some ancient people before them, had chosen this cave as their temple.|$|R
6000|$|For some {{minutes he}} was running through the {{darkness}} along a winding passage, and then he crossed some wide and open space, passed down a long incline, and came at last {{down a flight of}} steps to a level place. Many people were shouting, [...] "They are coming! The guards are coming. They are firing. Get out of the fighting. The guards are firing. It will be safe in Seventh Way. Along here to Seventh Way!" [...] There were women and children in the crowd as well as men. Men called names to him. The crowd converged on an archway, passed through a short throat and emerged on a wider space again, <b>lit</b> <b>dimly.</b> The black figures about him spread out and ran up what seemed in the twilight to be a gigantic series of steps. He followed. The people dispersed to the right and left.... He perceived that he was no longer in a crowd. He stopped near the highest step.

5|$|After {{recording}} sessions, Lennon, Harrison and Starr {{would be}} chauffeured {{back to their}} houses in the 'stockbroker belt' of Southern England, but Aspinall would often drive McCartney and Evans in an Austin Princess limousine to a late-night club to eat. The Bag O'Nails nightclub {{was one of their}} favourites, at 8 Kingly Street in Soho, London, as it also presented live music. They would eat steak, chips and mushy peas, but Aspinall would always take out a torch from his pocket (in the <b>dimly</b> <b>lit</b> club) to inspect the portions on each of their plates. This was {{to make sure that the}} portions were exactly as they had ordered, which McCartney always found amusing. While Harrison, McCartney and Starr passed their driving tests, Lennon didn't pass his driving test until 1965; however, he rarely drove himself due to being a notoriously bad driver by poorly navigating roads and failing to notice other traffic, and as a result, he was usually chauffeured to and from recording sessions and appointments by his own personal chauffeur.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} opens with shots of Rihanna hooded, {{lying on the}} floor of a gas chamber. Three men, dressed in black uniforms and wearing dark round glasses {{circulate}} around the singer, attempting to extort information from her. The scene then moves to a <b>dimly</b> <b>lit</b> room in which Rihanna sits at a table with her love interest (played by American actor Jesse Williams) opposite. On the table between them lies a silver revolver in which, throughout the video, they take it turns holding to their heads. Other scenes include Rihanna in a woodland at night standing in the middle of a highway before a car speeds towards her, quickly cutting to another scene, giving the impression she is run over. Elements of blood and tears and vehicular assault dominate the video. In the final scenes, Rihanna is shown underwater, floating whilst being fired at; one bullet is visually seen cutting her throat. The video ends with her lover apparently committing suicide with the revolver placed between them.|$|E
5|$|On Friday 9 November, prostitute Mary Jane Kelly {{was murdered}} in the single room where she lived at 13 Miller's Court, behind 26 Dorset Street, Spitalfields. One of the earlier victims, Chapman, had lived in Dorset Street, and another, Eddowes, was {{reported}} to have slept rough there. Kelly's severely mutilated body was discovered shortly after 10:45am lying on the bed. The first doctor at the scene, Dr George Bagster Phillips, believed that Kelly was killed by a slash to the throat. After her death, her abdominal cavity was sliced open and all her viscera removed and spread around the room. Her breasts had been cut off, her face mutilated beyond recognition, and her thighs partially cut through to the bone, with some of the muscles removed. Unlike the other victims, she was undressed and wore only a light chemise. Her clothes were folded neatly on a chair, with the exception of some found burnt in the grate. Abberline thought the clothes had been burned by the murderer to provide light, as the room was otherwise only <b>dimly</b> <b>lit</b> by a single candle. Kelly's murder was the most savage, probably because the murderer had more time to commit his atrocities in a private room rather than in the street. Her state of undress and folded clothes have led to suggestions that she undressed herself before lying down on the bed, which would indicate that she was killed by someone she knew, by someone she believed to be a client, or when she was asleep or intoxicated.|$|E
5000|$|Although not {{mutually}} exclusive with the other hypotheses presented, the visual stimuli hypothesis adds another layer of mismatch to explain the modern prevalence of myopia. There is evidence that lack of normal visual stimuli causes improper development of the eyeball. In this case, [...] "normal" [...] refers to the environmental stimuli that the eyeball evolved for over {{hundreds of millions of}} years. These stimuli would include diverse natural environments—the ocean, the jungle, the forest, and the savannah plains, among other dynamic visually exciting environments. Modern humans who {{spend most of their time}} indoors, in <b>dimly</b> or fluorescently <b>lit</b> buildings are not giving their eyes the appropriate stimuli to which they had evolved and may contribute to the development of myopia. [...] Experiments where animals such as kittens and monkeys had their eyes sewn shut for long periods of time also show eyeball elongation, demonstrating that complete lack of stimuli also causes improper growth trajectories of the eyeball. [...] Further research shows that people, and children especially, who spend more time doing physical exercise and outdoor activity have lower rates of myopia, relating the increased magnitude and complexity of the visual stimuli encountered during these types of activities.|$|R
60|$|From the first, {{nothing about}} that evening was as Arnold had expected. He took the tube to Hampstead station, and, the night being dry, {{he walked to}} Pelham Lodge without {{detriment}} to his carefully polished patent shoes. The neighborhood was entirely strange {{to him and he}} {{was surprised to find that}} the house which was pointed out to him by a policeman was situated in grounds of not inconsiderable extent, and approached by a short drive. Directly he rang the bell he was admitted not by a flamboyant parlormaid but by a quiet, sad-faced butler in plain, dark livery, who might have been major-domo to a duke. The house was even larger than he had expected, and was handsomely furnished in an extremely subdued style. It was <b>dimly,</b> almost insufficiently <b>lit,</b> and there was a faint but not unpleasant odor in the drawing-room which reminded him of incense. The room itself almost took his breath away. It was entirely French. The hangings, carpet and upholstery were all of a subdued rose color and white. Arnold, who was, for a young man, exceedingly susceptible to impressions, looked around him with an air almost of wonder. It was fortunate, perhaps, that the room was empty.|$|R
25|$|The attraction’s {{immersive}} {{and carefully}} detailed queue leads guests through <b>dimly</b> <b>lit</b> temple chambers and eerie passageways containing booby-trapped sections {{reminiscent of the}} Indiana Jones movies.|$|E
25|$|Programmed from {{a desktop}} {{computer}} with a wireless network interface controller in Burlington, Ontario, the LEDs use less energy to light than the previous incandescent lights (10% less energy than the <b>dimly</b> <b>lit</b> version and 60% less than the brightly lit version). The estimated cost to use the LEDs is $1,000 per month.|$|E
25|$|The {{final scene}} of the movie ends with Benjamin’s {{narration}} about what people were brought into this world for, recapping all the individuals that he loved and lost throughout his life. The film ends with alarms wailing as Katrina quickly floods a <b>dimly</b> <b>lit</b> storage room that holds Mr. Gateau’s forgotten clock, which continues to tick backwards.|$|E
25|$|Hloubětín and Kolbenova {{stations}} on Line B of Prague Metro were ghost stations from 1998 to 1999 (2001 for Kolbenova). Stations {{were in a}} {{state of}} suspended construction as the heavy industry factories they should have served were closed after the Velvet Revolution. Trains slowed down when passing through these <b>dimly</b> <b>lit</b> stations. As the whole industrial area is slowly revitalized the stations were finally completed.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, as the city's crime rates reached an all-time high, {{the station was}} {{considered}} very dangerous, with 11 crimes having taken place there in the year 1990, {{many of which were}} suspected to happen in the tunnel. The tunnel was <b>dimly</b> <b>lit,</b> covered with graffiti, and strewn with garbage at the time. In September 2014, improvements started on the tunnel, which area residents had complained about. The tunnel, which had graffiti and was frequented by cyclists riding bikes illegally, was slated to get several murals and some new LED lighting.|$|E
25|$|Most {{reports of}} the incarceration of prisoners in the {{basement}} of a bergfried date to the late Middle Ages and early modern period; to what extent this was common before then, is uncertain. Often it is probably a later change of use, as was the case in many town wall towers and even entire castle complexes, like the Bastille, are known. When prisoners were incarcerated in the often claustrophobic, poorly ventilated and <b>dimly</b> <b>lit</b> or even completely dark basements, it was not just imprisonment, but corporal punishment, a severe psychological and physical mistreatment of prisoners.|$|E
25|$|The {{scene was}} {{attended}} by Superintendent Thomas Arnold and Inspector Edmund Reid from Whitechapel's H Division, as well as Frederick Abberline and Robert Anderson from Scotland Yard. Arnold had the room broken into at 1:30p.m. after the possibility of tracking the murderer from the room with bloodhounds was dismissed as impractical. A fire fierce enough to melt the solder between a kettle and its spout had burnt in the grate, apparently fuelled with clothing. Inspector Abberline thought Kelly's clothes were burnt by the murderer to provide light, as the room was otherwise only <b>dimly</b> <b>lit</b> by a single candle.|$|E
25|$|The {{elevator}} rises for a {{few seconds}} before coming to its first stop. The doors open to reveal a long, <b>dimly</b> <b>lit</b> hotel corridor, with overgrown plants and doors to guest rooms, with morning newspapers and room-service trays outside, along its length. There is a single window {{at the opposite end of}} the corridor. A violent thunderstorm is raging and lightning flashes outside the window. The five missing passengers from 1939 appear for several moments, turning to face the elevator and beckoning the guests to join them. Then they disappear in a burst of electricity. The corridor fades away, but the window remains until it appears to be floating in a dark field of stars. The window morphs into the window from the Season 5 opening sequence, and breaks.|$|E
25|$|The town {{is known}} for {{gingerbread}} biscuits which were first made in 1740 by William Eggleston. Eggleston, a baker by trade, was a producer of a biscuit called Grantham Whetstones. Whetsones were a rusk like dry biscuit enjoyed locally and also by coach drivers who used to stop in Grantham to change their horses whilst travelling on the Great North road. According to folklore, Egglestone, whilst baking whetsones in his <b>dimly</b> <b>lit</b> kitchen one morning, mistook one ingredient for another, resulting in a ginger-like biscuit {{to emerge from the}} oven. The mistake was a huge success and the biscuit became established as Grantham gingerbread, known as a white gingerbread because it is not made with molasses or black treacle. This provides a delicate ginger flavour, rich in butter, with a domed top that has a crackled surface. The centre is hollow and resembles a honeycomb.|$|E
25|$|Hundreds {{of snakes}} cover {{the walls and}} ground and a large audio-animatronic cobra (Frighto) appears {{to the right of}} the vehicle, {{striking}} at the riders. The transport heads back to return across the rope bridge and flashes its headlights at an oncoming transport about to cross. The transport turns sharply to the right, behind the giant stone carving of Mara's face, and crosses a wooden bridge under the rope bridge. The transport stalls near a hanging tree root, where many rats are seen climbing across it and falling off into the car before a burst of speed sends the car through the tree root, which vaporizes like mist. The transport careens through a <b>dimly</b> <b>lit</b> tunnel with paintings of spear-wielding skeletal warriors adorning the walls. Blasts of air hit the riders and darts are heard striking the transport as it rolls over the trigger stones between the skeletal warriors.|$|E
25|$|The {{memorial}} {{is shaped}} like a ship's prow; the crypt is accessible by two staircases and a lowered square protected by a metal portcullis. The crypt leads to a hexagonal rotunda that includes two chapels containing earth and bones from concentration camps. The walls display literary excerpts. Pingusson intended that its long and narrow subterranean space convey a feeling of claustrophobia. The memorial's entrance is narrow, marked by two concrete blocks. Inside is the tomb of an unknown deportee who was killed at the camp in Neustadt. Along both walls of the narrow, <b>dimly</b> <b>lit</b> chamber are 200,000 glass crystals with light shining through, meant to symbolize each of the deportees {{who died in the}} concentration camps; {{at the end of the}} tunnel is a single bright light. Ashes from the camps, contained within urns, are positioned at both lateral ends. Both ends of the chamber have small rooms that seem to depict prison cells. Opposite the entrance is a stark iron gate overlooking the Seine at the tip of the Île de la Cité.|$|E
25|$|Halfway to Sanity is {{the tenth}} studio album by American punk band the Ramones. It was {{released}} on September 15, 1987 by Sire Records and was produced by Daniel Rey. Recording sessions began in April 1987 at Intergalactic Studios in New York City, and the band began recording instruments before vocals as a method to learn songs more quickly. Band members tended to disagree on many things at this time, and Rey described them to be impatient. The album's front cover was shot by previous Ramones' photographer George DuBose in Chinatown, New York City. The short lasted session resulted in a <b>dimly</b> <b>lit</b> album cover which guitarist Johnny Ramone said was good because it helped make them look younger. The band toured around the world following the album's release, but certain show dates were cancelled after drummer Richie Ramone left the band due to financial conflicts with the band. Clem Burke of Blondie was hired as Elvis Ramone to fill the drummer's spot for two shows, then was replaced the band's ex-member Marky Ramone, and the tour would continue with him.|$|E
25|$|The {{entrance}} is {{situated at the}} back of the Saw Plaza. The exterior queue line consists of mock razor wire fences and various large torture implements rusting on the ground (most of which come from the films). Walkie talkie announcements are heard from policemen inside the building, often sounding as if they are panicking. Loud ambient music is played throughout the area. The queue travels around the back of the warehouse and then into the building itself. Inside, riders walk through a <b>dimly</b> <b>lit</b> corridor, with four shotguns hanging from the ceiling. The guns 'fire' every few minutes to give a jump effect. The corridor leads up some stairs past a cage with a trap (the Rack from Saw III) seen in it. On special occasions, live actors are placed in this cage and act as Jigsaw's victims. Travelling up the stairs, Billy the Puppet can be seen and heard on TV monitors up the stairs to the station. Above the queue, a body is seen tangled in barbed wire (referencing the first Saw), before the queue goes into the station. In here, mannequin parts are fixed in various small devices or hanging from the walls, and misted windows flash on the wall opposite the queue.|$|E
25|$|The player, {{who sits}} in an office, is {{given access to}} a network of {{security}} cameras throughout the facility to track {{the movement of the}} animatronics. Each character roams the restaurant and has distinct movement patterns, and most of the characters' movements take place off-screen. The camera feeds are <b>dimly</b> <b>lit</b> and distorted, one of the rooms only contains an audio feed, and the cameras do not cover certain areas of the building, most notably the two hallways directly to the left and right of the player. The player cannot leave the guard room, but can close the doors to defend themselves, and briefly turn on lights in the hallways to check for animatronics. Use of these actions consume the player's limited electrical power; if the power runs out, the cameras become inoperable, the doors open, and the lights go out. Once these things happen, the Toreador March will play, the screen will go pitch black, and the player will be jumpscared by Freddy, provided they do not reach {{the end of the night}} in the meantime. If the player is jumpscared by any of the animatronics, the game ends, and the player must restart from the beginning of the night.|$|E
500|$|Jane Stanford {{has been}} {{described}} as having a [...] "Victorian aversion to blank space" [...] and so created a church that is [...] "a <b>dimly</b> <b>lit</b> cavern of glowing mosaic surfaces... and vibrant, stained-glass windows". The church is richly decorated throughout, its architectural features carved with formalized foliate ornament, and the walls adorned with mosaics in the Byzantine manner. [...] The stained-glass windows were crafted by J. and R. Lamb of New York. [...] The chandeliers, installed in 1915, are in the Art Nouveau tradition and have gold decorative patterns cast in pot metal.|$|E

Because of the military's [...] "Don't ask, don't tell" [...] policy (known as DADT and in effect until September 20, 2011), Manning was unable to live as an openly gay man without risk of being discharged. But she apparently {{made no secret of}} her orientation: her friends said she kept a fairy wand on her desk. When she told her roommate she was attracted to men, he responded by suggesting they not speak to each other.

500|$|Despite {{the intense}} weather conditions, Kivilo {{believed}} that the overcast skies created a [...] "gray, somber, stark look." [...] Kivilo also chose not to use any lighting for daytime exterior scenes. For exterior scenes shot during sunnier filming days, computer-generated imagery (CGI) was used to re-create the overcast skies and counter any inconsistencies caused by the falling snow. In depicting the shootout in Lou's home, Kivilo's intent was to [...] "keep things quite sketchy in the lighting and not be clear about exactly what was happening." [...] The camera department lit a China ball from the ceiling to depict a <b>dimly</b> <b>lit</b> kitchen light that would reveal Nancy holding a shotgun. Flash photography guns were used to depict the muzzle flashes during the shootouts.|$|E
