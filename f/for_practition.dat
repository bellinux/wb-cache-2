40|$|Abstractâ€”Adequate {{integrated}} ICT {{infrastructure and}} services are a prerequisite for keeping pace with the rapid rise of complexity and service levels in logistics. Recent studies indicate a high attractiveness and impact perspective of cloud computing for logistics service providers within few years in order {{to cope with the}} growing IT capacity demands. Within this paper, a comprehensive overview is given on R&D with relation to CC for logistics. Among these, the EU-project LOGICAL is presented in detail since it combines different aspects and benefits of CC for the logistics sector. A generic system of CC use cases in logistics and the corresponding needs for a logistics cloud architecture are discussed and compared with the implementation status of the LOGICAL cloud. Special attention is given to the problem of incompatible data and service interfaces. Instead of following the single-window, single-document concept, a semi-automated on demand interface creation service is presented as an intermediate alternative <b>for</b> the <b>practitioning</b> logistics sector...|$|R
