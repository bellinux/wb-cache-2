40|$|Software {{architecture}} {{is a relatively}} new topic in software engineering. It is quickly becoming a central issue, and leadingedge organizations spend a considerable fraction of their development effort on software architecture. Consequently, software {{architecture is}} increasingly often the topic of a dedicated course in software engineering curricula. There are two general flavors as for the contents of such a course. One flavor emphasizes the programming-in-the-large aspects of software architecture and concentrates on design and architectural patterns, architecture description languages and the like. The other emphasizes the communication aspects of software architecture to a variety of stakeholders, thereby acknowledging a broader view of software architecture. In this paper we report our experiences with two master-level courses in software architecture that focus on these communication aspects.

Through synchronized data of particle tracking and stress distributions in particles, I have shown differences between my data of the time-averaged velocity/stress profile of 2 D hopper flow with previous theoretical predictions. I have also demonstrated {{the importance of a}} mechanical stable arch near the opening on controlling hopper flow rheology and suggested a heuristic phase diagram for the hopper flow/jamming transition. Another part of this thesis work is focused on studying the impact of particle shape of particles on hopper flow.

40|$|Iron-containing N-doped carbon {{materials}} were investigated as electrocatalysts for the cogeneration of hydroxylamine (NH 2 OH) and electricity in a H- 2 -NO fuel cell. This electrochemical route {{for the production}} of hydroxylamine is a greener alternative to the present industrial synthesis, because it allows converting the energy released during the reaction into electricity. The studied electrocatalysts were prepared by pyrolysis of composites of activated carbon and polyaniline (PANI) incorporating Fe sites (Fe-PANI-AC). Characterisation with a combination of techniques (FT-IR and Raman spectroscopy, XRD, N- 2 -physisorption, XPS and ToF-SIMS) showed that the materials exhibit promising features as electrocatalysts for the NO reduction reaction, as they contain the desired isolated FeNxCy sites and have a relatively high degree of graphitisation, which grants good electrical conductivity. The performance of the Fe-PANI-AC electrocatalysts was investigated by means of linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) in a half cell setup and by chronoamperometry in a H- 2 -NO fuel cell setup and compared to that of a reference electrocatalyst consisting of iron phthalocyanine supported on activated carbon (FePc/AC). The Fe-PANI-AC electrocatalysts led to higher current density than FePc/AC under all studied conditions. At low NO concentration in the feed, FePc/AC displayed higher selectivity towards hydroxylamine, whereas the Fe-PANI-AC electrocatalysts were superior at higher NO concentration (i. e. at the <b>industrially</b> more <b>relevant</b> conditions), both in terms of production rate and of selectivity towards hydroxylamine. Moreover, the Fe-PANI-AC electrocatalysts exhibited high stability under the fuel cell operating conditions.

Atomic force microscopy in addition to solvent permeation measurements, confirmed that the buffer layer prevented the formation of performance-limiting defects in the bilayer thin films, which likely occur as a result of excessive plasma–surface interactions during the deposition process. It emerged that the primary function of the buffer layer was therefore to act as a protective coating for the flexible polymer substrate material...|$|R

To date, self-healing of FRPs has mostly been applied to simple structures such as flat plates and panels. There is however a somewhat limited application of self-healing in flat panels, as access to the panel surface is relatively simple and repair methods are very well established in industry.

In this study, various characterization techniques: AFM, EDX, SEM, HAADF-STEM, HRTEM, XRD and XPS and catalytic hydrogenation of soybean oil. The concept of intracellular trafficking of palladium into the cells of both Gram-negative (Desulfovibrio desulfuricans) and Gram-positive (Bacillus benzeovorans) bacteria was pioneered against previously known extracellular NP deposition. The membrane integrity and membrane potentials of “palladized” cells (‘bio-Pd’) were found to be retained through flow cytometry analysis.

There {{are a variety of}} expression systems in terms of types of transcriptional patterns, among which the auto-inducible and growth-phase-dependent promoters are gaining increasing favor due to their inducer-independent feature, allowing for the potential to industrially scale-up. To expand the applicability of the auto-inducible expression system, a novel auto-regulatory expression system coupled with cell density was constructed and developed in B. subtilis using the quorum-sensing related promoter srfA (PsrfA). Results: The promoter of the srf operon was used to construct an expression plasmid with the green fluorescent pro-tein (GFP) downstream of PsrfA. The expression displayed a cell-density-dependent pattern in that GFP had a fairly low expression level at the early exponential stage and was highly expressed at the late exponential as well as the station-ary stages. Moreover, the recombinant system had a similar expression pattern in wild-type B. subtilis 168, WB 600, and WB 800, as well as in B. subtilis 168 derivative strain 1681, with the complete deletion of PsrfA, indicating the excellent compatibility of this system.

In this study we show that Escherichia coli does not affect Candida albicans tolerance to amphotericin or caspofungin in an E. coli / C. albicans biofilm. In contrast, ofloxacin-tolerance of E. coli is significantly increased in a polymicrobial E. coli / C. albicans biofilm as compared to an axenic E. coli biofilm. The increased ofloxacin-tolerance of E. coli is mainly biofilm-specific as ofloxacin-tolerance of E. coli is less pronounced in polymicrobial E. coli / C. albicans planktonic cultures. Moreover, we found that ofloxacin-tolerance of E. coli decreased significantly when E. coli / C. albicans biofilms were treated with matrix-degrading enzymes such as the - 1, 3 -glucan-degrading enzyme lyticase. In line with a role for - 1, 3 -glucan in mediating ofloxacin-tolerance of E. coli in a biofilm, we found that ofloxacin-tolerance of E. coli increased even more in E. coli / C. albicans biofilms consisting of a high - 1, 3 -glucan-producing C. albicans mutant. In addition, exogenous addition of laminarin, a polysaccharide mainly composed of poly-β- 1, 3 -glucan, to an E. coli biofilm also resulted in increased ofloxacin-tolerance.

The first part introduces the basic principles of ocean modeling and depicts the long way from the generic principles to the practical modeling of oil spills and of the propagation of other adverse impacts. The second part focuses on the techniques for solving the inverse problem of the quantification of offshore areas with respect to their potential to serve as a source of environmental danger to vulnerable regions (such as spawning, nursing or also tourist areas).   The chapters are written in a tutorial style; they are mostly self-contained and understandable for non-specialist researchers and students. They are carefully peer-reviewed by international experts. The goal was to produce a book that highlights all key steps, methods, models and data sets it is necessary to combine in order to produce a practically usable technology and/or decision support system for a particular sea region. Thus the book is useful not only as a description and a manual of this particular technology but also as a roadmap highlighting the complicated technical issues of ocean modeling for practical purposes.
