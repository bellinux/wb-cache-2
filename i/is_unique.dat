5|$|Aboriginal {{title in}} California {{refers to the}} {{aboriginal}} title land rights of the indigenous peoples of California. The state <b>is</b> <b>unique</b> in that no Native American tribe in California is the counterparty to a ratified federal treaty. Therefore, all the Indian reservations in the state were created by federal statute or executive order.|$|E
50|$|In {{the first}} version of the theorem, evidently the {{separating}} hyperplane <b>is</b> never <b>unique.</b> In the second version, {{it may or may not}} <b>be</b> <b>unique.</b> Technically a separating axis <b>is</b> never <b>unique</b> because it can be translated; in the second version of the theorem, a separating axis can <b>be</b> <b>unique</b> up to translation.|$|R
50|$|Identifiers in VDEX data should <b>be</b> persistent, <b>unique,</b> resolvable, {{transportable}} and URI-compliant. Specifically, vocabulary identifiers should <b>be</b> <b>unique</b> URIs, whereas {{term and}} relationship identifiers should <b>be</b> locally <b>unique</b> strings.|$|R
5000|$|Because {{district}} names had <b>been</b> <b>unique</b> {{within a}} single province and as of 2008 prefecture boundaries are roughly aligned to provincial boundaries, most district names <b>are</b> <b>unique</b> within their prefectures.|$|R
5|$|Although each race <b>is</b> <b>unique</b> in its composition, no {{race has}} an innate {{advantage}} over the other. Each species is balanced out so that while they have different strengths, powers, and abilities their overall strength is the same. The balance stays complete via infrequent patches (game updates) provided by Blizzard.|$|E
5|$|Another {{feature of}} Bristol Cathedral is the {{vaulting}} of its various medieval spaces. The {{work that was}} carried out under Abbot Knowle <b>is</b> <b>unique</b> in this regard, with not one, but three unique vaults.|$|E
5|$|Behind {{the granite}} barrier the {{corridor}} branches eastward to a T-shaped magazine chamber which probably contained Userkaf's funerary equipment.

50|$|Projective {{covers and}} their {{superfluous}} epimorphisms, when they exist, <b>are</b> <b>unique</b> up to isomorphism. The isomorphism need not <b>be</b> <b>unique,</b> however, since the projective property {{is not a}} full fledged universal property.|$|R
50|$|Route numbers 1 to 99 <b>are</b> <b>unique</b> {{only within}} each service area: (1) Hong Kong island, (2) Kowloon and New Territories, (3) Lantau island. All other route numbers <b>are</b> <b>unique</b> within the territory.|$|R
50|$|Both the 4300A and 4300D <b>are</b> <b>unique</b> {{by virtue}} of having spread bore {{throttle}} plate designs (the 4300A being much less pronounced than the 4300D) that <b>are</b> <b>unique</b> to these carburetors and their relative intake mainfolds.|$|R
5|$|Detailed {{descriptions}} {{were published}} by Henri Frankfort (1936), by Pauline Albenda (2005), {{and in a}} monograph by Dominique Collon, curator at the British Museum, where the plaque is now housed. The composition as a whole <b>is</b> <b>unique</b> among works of art from Mesopotamia, even though many elements have interesting counterparts in other images from that time.|$|E
5|$|Gan Eng Seng School <b>is</b> <b>unique</b> {{among the}} schools in Singapore being the only one initiated, {{established}} and maintained by a local citizen with a gift of freehold property, buildings and adequate funds until his demise. Most other schools of the time were established by missionary or communal organisations.|$|E
5|$|Human {{language}} <b>is</b> <b>unique</b> {{in comparison}} {{to other forms of}} communication, such as those used by non-human animals. Communication systems used by other animals such as bees or apes are closed systems that consist of a finite, usually very limited, number of possible ideas that can be expressed.|$|E
5000|$|The theorem {{was first}} proved by [...] They showed that regular local rings of {{dimension}} 3 <b>are</b> <b>unique</b> factorization domains, and [...] had previously shown that {{this implies that}} all regular local rings <b>are</b> <b>unique</b> factorization domains.|$|R
50|$|Usernames <b>are</b> <b>unique.</b>|$|R
50|$|C. histolyticum proteinases <b>are</b> <b>unique</b> {{in their}} {{efficiency}} of converting tissue proteins to amino acids and peptides.

5|$|I Corps <b>is</b> <b>unique</b> {{among the}} active US Army corps {{in that it}} is {{composed}} of a mixture of active duty and US Army Reserve units in 47 of the 50 U.S. states, for a total of around 20,000 active duty and 20,000 army reserve forces.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} {{vertical}} trends down groups, helium {{can be seen}} as a typical noble gas at the head of Group 18, but as discussed below, hydrogen's chemistry <b>is</b> <b>unique</b> and it is not easily assigned to any group.|$|E
5|$|Molecular phylogenetics {{have shown}} that C.cirrhata forms a {{monophyletic}} clade with the remaining two species of Collybia. Because C.cirrhata {{is the only one}} of the three Collybia species lacking sclerotia, it has been suggested that this character trait is an anapomorphy—that <b>is,</b> <b>unique</b> to a single, terminal species within a clade.|$|E
25|$|Complements {{need not}} <b>be</b> <b>unique.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A {{network address}} is an {{identifier}} for a node or network interface of a telecommunications network. Network addresses {{are designed to}} <b>be</b> <b>unique</b> across the network, although some networks allow for local, private addresses or locally administered addresses that may not <b>be</b> <b>unique.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{function}} of identification is to map a known quantity to an unknown entity {{so as to}} make it known. The known quantity is called the identifier (or ID) and the unknown entity is what needs identification. A basic requirement for identification is that the ID <b>be</b> <b>unique.</b> IDs may <b>be</b> scoped, that <b>is,</b> they <b>are</b> <b>unique</b> only within a particular scope. IDs may also be built out of a collection of quantities such that they <b>are</b> <b>unique</b> on the collective.|$|R
5|$|On 13 June the {{following}} year, at Euro 2016 Rosický became the oldest player to represent Czech Republic {{in the competition}} {{at the age of}} 35. The record <b>is</b> <b>unique</b> for Rosický as he also holds the record for being the youngest player to have done so, having featured at Euro 2000 for his nation as a 19-year old.|$|E
5|$|Oryzomys peninsulae is a {{medium-sized}} {{member of the}} genus, smaller than O.albiventer but larger than O.couesi mexicanus. Its fur is grayish-brown on the forequarters, but reddish-brown on the hindquarters; this coloration pattern <b>is</b> <b>unique</b> among western Mexican Oryzomys. The underparts are a dirty white, the feet white above, and the tail dark or brownish above and dirty white below.|$|E
5|$|Secret of Evermore <b>is</b> <b>unique</b> {{in that it}} is {{the only}} game {{developed}} by Square designers in North America. The game received positive reviews upon its release due to its graphics and gameplay, but was criticized for not being up to the expectations many reviewers had of its developer.|$|E
50|$|In 2 dimensions, crepant {{resolutions of}} complex Gorenstein {{quotient}} singularities (du Val singularities) always exist and <b>are</b> <b>unique,</b> in 3 dimensions they exist but need not <b>be</b> <b>unique</b> {{as they can}} be related by flops, and in dimensions greater than 3 they need not exist.|$|R
50|$|Whereas {{the first}} part of a {{binomial}} name must <b>be</b> <b>unique</b> within a kingdom, the second part is quite commonly used in two or more genera (as is shown by examples of hodgsonii above). The full binomial name must <b>be</b> <b>unique</b> within a kingdom.|$|R
30|$|A hyperconvex hull always exists, but needs not to <b>be</b> <b>unique.</b> It <b>is,</b> however, <b>unique</b> {{up to an}} isometry. To be more precise, the {{following}} holds.|$|R
5|$|Some {{methods of}} {{fixation}} for unstable lesions include countersunk compression screws and Herbert screws or pins made {{of stainless steel}} or materials that can be absorbed by the body. If loose bodies are found, they are removed. Although each case <b>is</b> <b>unique</b> and treatment is chosen on an individual basis, ACI is generally performed on large defects in skeletally mature people.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the oldest}} and most {{successful}} insect groups, such Endopterygota, use a system of complete metamorphosis. Complete metamorphosis <b>is</b> <b>unique</b> to a group of certain insect orders including Diptera, Lepidoptera and Hymenoptera. This form of development is exclusive and not seen in any other arthropods.|$|E
5|$|The Bill <b>is</b> <b>unique</b> amongst police dramas in that {{it takes}} a serial format, {{focussing}} on the work and lives of a single shift of police officers, rather than on one particular area of police work. Also unique is that The Bill adapted to this format after several series, whereas comparable series started with the serial format.|$|E
