5|$|The {{extraordinary}} {{demands of}} the Punic Wars, {{in addition to a}} shortage of manpower, exposed the tactical weaknesses of the manipular legion, {{at least in the short}} term. In 217 BC, near the beginning of the Second Punic War, Rome was forced to effectively ignore its long-standing principle that its soldiers must be both citizens and property owners. During the 2nd century BC, Roman territory saw an overall decline in population, partially due to the huge losses incurred during various wars. This was accompanied by severe social stresses and the greater collapse of the middle classes. As a result, the Roman state was forced to arm its soldiers at the expense of the state, which it did not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> the past.|$|E

500|$|Gore {{has said}} that his other reason for enlisting {{was that he did}} not want someone with fewer options than he to go in his place. Actor Tommy Lee Jones, a former college housemate, {{recalled}} Gore saying that [...] "if he found a fancy way of not going, someone else would have to go in his place". His Harvard advisor, Richard Neustadt, also stated that Gore decided, [...] "that he would have to go as an enlisted man because, he said, 'In Tennessee, that's what most people <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> <b>In</b> addition, Michael Roche, Gore's editor for The Castle Courier, stated that [...] "anybody who knew Al Gore in Vietnam knows he could have sat on his butt and he didn't." ...|$|E

500|$|Pascu parted with Divertis in 2007. At the time, he {{indicated}} that {{he could no longer}} handle their tight schedule. The break was not total, though, since Pascu continued to appear on Animat Planet. In a 2007 interview, reflecting on that show's impact, he stated, [...] "I'm not much of a fan of political humor. I simply like the impromptu kind of humor [...] If [...] happens to be political, it is because that is what we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> this series." [...] In 2012, he asserted that his break with political humor was definitive, and against the consensus in Divertis—in 2007, Pascu noted there was already a disagreement between him and Toni Grecu. Shortly after his departure, a conflict between Grecu and the other Divertis actors broke Divertis into competing halves.|$|E
500|$|The team {{failed to}} throw a {{touchdown}} pass in any of their first five games, three of which were shutout losses. Offensive coordinator John Rauch walked out on the team during the week 5 game against Cincinnati, and gave 'personal differences' {{as the reason for}} his resignation. His duties were taken over by McKay, who pointed to the increased effectiveness of the team’s “simpler” offense, saying that they were no longer “trying to do all the things people said you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> this league”. On a strange NFL weekend in which O.J. Simpson was ejected from a game for fighting, the Chicago Bears lost a game due to a referee’s inadvertent whistle, and Minnesota Vikings receiver Sammy White fumbled away a touchdown due to starting his celebration before entering the end zone, McKay launched an obscenity-filled tirade against Denver Broncos coach John Ralston after a blowout loss. McKay admitted that his feelings dated back to their college rivalry, when McKay coached at USC and Ralston coached at Stanford University, but pointed to specific plays such as a reverse and a last-minute punt return as evidence that Ralston was trying to run up the score. Third-string running back Manfred Moore caught a lucky break when, waived after the week 13 game against the Pittsburgh Steelers, he was picked up by the Oakland Raiders as an injury replacement for ex-Buccaneer Rick Jennings. He wound up going from an 0–13 team to the eventual Super Bowl champion. Players began to meet for postgame parties at Steve Spurrier’s house, in order to avoid having to show their faces in public. According to defensive end Pat Toomay, “By the time we got to the last game of the season, we had so many injuries that we didn’t feel we had much of a chance. Everybody was so sick of the season that they showed up packed and ready to get out of town. It looked like a bunch of Okies fleeing the dust bowl." [...] McKay said that the week 4 game against the Baltimore Colts summed up the season: “On one play I looked up and one of our guys was getting kicked out of the game, and two more were getting carried off”.|$|E
2500|$|Out of office, Bevan soon {{exacerbated}} the split within the Labour Party between {{the right and}} the left. For the next five years, Bevan was the leader of the left wing of the Labour Party, who became known as Bevanites. They criticised high defence expenditure (especially for nuclear weapons), called for better relations with the Soviet Union, and opposed the party leader, Attlee, on most issues. [...] According to Richard Crossman Bevan hated [...] "the in-fighting which you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> politics.... He wasn't cut out to be a leader, he was cut out to be a prophet." [...] In 1954, Gaitskell defeated Bevan in a hard fought contest to be the Treasurer of the Labour Party. In March 1955, when Britain was preparing for tests of its first hydrogen bomb, Bevan led a revolt of 57 Labour MPs and abstained on a key vote. The Parliamentary Labour Party voted 141 to 113 to withdraw the whip from him, but it was restored within a month due to his popularity.|$|E

2500|$|Rothenberg {{said he had}} {{not always}} planned on killing Lexa, but the fact that Debnam-Carey was {{simultaneously}} on another show (Fear the Walking Dead), and was therefore unlikely to ever become a series regular on The 100, he felt use of the character would be limited or absent in the future. This is when the writers decided to craft a death scene for her to propel the story forward. [...] "I remember as we were breaking the season, we talked about reincarnation in the Grounder world and how that was how commanders were selected. I didn't want to throw that out as nonsense, which is how Clarke had received it, but I also didn't want {{to say that it was}} real reincarnation," [...] he said, adding he had been reading The Singularity Is Near by Ray Kurzweil at the time, which [...] "talks quite a bit about a future where we'll be able to upload our minds—literally upload our consciousness—into a computer and live forever." [...] This gave Rothenberg the idea for incorporating a [...] "technological reincarnation" [...] storyline. [...] "The commander A.I. would need to be able to pass itself from person to person over time and [...] Lexa was just the most recent recipient of this artificial intelligence augmentation of her consciousness. So once we came up with that idea, that was the point at which everything jelled and sort of came together storytelling-wise," [...] he stated. [...] "And of course, if you're dealing with a story about reincarnation, you've got to die before you can be reincarnated. So Lexa dying became a very tragic necessity." [...] Rothenberg said Clarke was in love with Lexa, that they were soulmates, and Lexa's death will haunt Clarke. [...] " [...] is going to have to figure out how to compartmentalize, the way that all of us <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> the real world when people are suddenly and tragically taken away from us," [...] he added. [...] "That's kind of the point of The 100 in many ways. These horrible things happen and yet we still have to figure out a way to move on and be the heroes of our own stories." ...|$|E
