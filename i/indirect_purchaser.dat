40|$|Any {{scheme for}} private {{antitrust}} enforcement is framed by two main questions: {{who will have}} standing – direct or <b>indirect</b> <b>purchasers</b> – and will the passing-on defense be allowed. Imagine that a cartel of oil producers forces gas stations – direct purchasers – to buy petrol at a higher than competitive price. The gas stations then raise the price for the final customers – <b>indirect</b> <b>purchasers.</b> When the gas stations sue the cartel, the cartelist will claim that no damage has occurred to the gas stations, because the gas stations have passed on the overcharge to its final customers – the passing-on defense. In the United States, the ruling of the California Supreme Court in Clayworth v. Pfizer, alongside {{a report of the}} Antitrust Modernization Commission of 2007, spurred new debate on whether the 1970 s Federal case law should be overruled. The situation in the European Union has been even more challenging. The Court of Justice of the EU surprised everybody with two landmark cases in the early 2000 s, in which the court set up a basic scheme for private antitrust enforcement. However, neither the EU nor the Member States had the appropriate legislation in place. The article analyzes these latest developments, offering new solutions to both jurisdictions. I argue that the practice of passing on increases the total social welfare loss resulting from the existence of a cartel. To remedy the problem, I suggest a system that allows the passing-on defense, grants <b>indirect</b> <b>purchasers</b> standing, and multiplies the damages award. Such a system will lead to direct-purchaser suits being the rule, with <b>indirect</b> <b>purchasers</b> remaining subsidiary enforcers. It will also prompt the direct purchasers to commence the antitrust litigation in the proper time, thus limiting the additional social inefficiencies created by the cartel...|$|R
40|$|In 1982, Congress {{enacted the}} Foreign Antitrust Trade Improvements Act (FTAIA) to resolve {{uncertainties}} about the international reach and effect of U. S. antitrust laws. Unfortunately, the FTAIA has provided {{more questions than}} answers. It has been ten years since the Supreme Court most recently interpreted the FTAIA, and crucial questions and circuit splits abound. One of these questions is how to understand the convergence of the direct purchaser rule (frequently {{referred to as the}} Illinois Brick doctrine) and the FTAIA. Under the direct purchaser rule, only those who purchase directly from antitrust violators are typically permitted to sue under section 4 of the Clayton Act for treble damages. There are several court-created exceptions to this rule that allow <b>indirect</b> <b>purchasers</b> to sue under section 4. This Note addresses the open question of whether courts should apply these exceptions in the FTAIA context. The Seventh Circuit recently discussed this question in Motorola Mobility LLC v. AU Optronics Corp., implying that courts should not recognize Illinois Brick’s exceptions in the FTAIA context. This Note argues for a different interpretation of the case—one that supports the effective deterrence of antitrust violations while vindicating the need to compensate American consumers who are foreseeably, substantially, and directly damaged by foreign anticompetitive conduct. Based on an analysis of the purpose of the Illinois Brick doctrine and the text of the FTAIA, this Note concludes that when an exception to Illinois Brick would permit <b>indirect</b> <b>purchasers</b> to sue in the domestic context, U.

40|$|Doctoral Thesis in Law The defence of passing-on and <b>Indirect</b> <b>Purchaser</b> Standing as Components of Private Enforcement of EU Antitrust Rules Summaries The present work {{investigated}} one of {{the most}} complex and controversial issues in the field of private enforcement of antitrust rules, the passing-on defence and <b>indirect</b> <b>purchaser</b> standing. The research question that guided us throughout this work was: how should the passing-on defence be designed in order to (i) guarantee full compensation to both the direct and indirect purchasers; (ii) to prevent that neither the plaintiff nor the defendant is unjustly enriched; and (iii) to prevent the multiple liability and over-deterrence of the defendant? This work attempted to answer these questions. In doing so, it explored the US private antitrust enforcement policy, the Supreme Courts case law, State law and court practice, the legislative proposals regarding the passing-on defence and <b>indirect</b> <b>purchaser</b> standing, and academic literature. In antitrust cases the assistance of economists to help to overcome {{one of the}} complex issues in designing private enforcement, i. e. quantifying damages and calculating the degree of passing-on, is inevitable. This research provided therefore an overview of the degree of complexity of the methods which can be used to calculate the passing-on by relying on conclusions and statements of economists. Against this, the current situation of private enforcement of private enforcement in Europe is analyzed. It explored first the antitrust enforcement policy. Then an overview and analysis of the ECJs long standing case law on the development of EU law principles, rights and remedies is provided. These developments are the milestones in the course of horizontal liability and the right to claim damages from other individuals under EU law. After this analysis, it then sought to explore the ECJs case law on the extra-contractual liability of the EU and Member States and horizontal liability of individuals for damages. Consequently, the ECJs case law, selected Member States (Germany, England, Belgium and the Netherlands) on tort law has been investigated. Then, the Member States restitution law based on unjust enrichment and undue payment is considered. Subsequently, the Commissions Green, White and Draft Directive on the issues of passing-on defence and <b>indirect</b> <b>purchaser</b> standing are analyzed. Finally, general conclusions and additional proposed options are provided. PART I Passing-on defence and <b>indirect</b> <b>purchaser</b> standing in the United States of America The stated purpose of this part was to explore the problem of passing-on by relying on the US Supreme Courts case law, state law and conclusions and statement of economists. Chapter 1 focused primarily on private antitrust enforcement policy in the US. It revealed that the US courts and antitrust agencies, as part of their interpretation and enforcement of federal antitrust laws adopted an optimal deterrence and efficiency-oriented approaches. In order to achieve these aims, not only the legislator but also the Supreme Court and the lower courts have imposed limitations on standing and to recover damages for antitrust infringements as embodied in Article 4 of the Clayton and Article 1 of the Sherman Acts. The most radical limitation is the rejection of passing-on defence in Hanover Shoe and the <b>indirect</b> <b>purchaser</b> standing in Illinois Brick. These two seminal decisions have received phenomenal attention and led to a split between Federal and State courts. Chapter 2 focused exclusively on passing-on defence. This chapter started with defining the passing-on defence and explaining its purpose, operation and effect. This chapter had further two aims. First, it aimed to explain why the defence gives rise to controversy, divided the academics and court and why the Supreme Court eventually rejected the defence. Second, it aimed to analyze the Supreme Courts Hanover Shoe decision and the academic response and criticism to the Courts decision. The Supreme Courts reasoning behind the rejecting the defence was that the task of establishing passing-on would require convincing proof of virtually unascertainable figure, prove insurmountable and render the already complex antitrust damages actions completely unmanageable. As stated by the Supreme Court: we are not impressed with the argument that sound laws of economics require recognizing this passing-on defence. The Supreme Courts analysis rests on three, well grounded, premises, (i) it is difficult to establish that the buyer has raised his price in response to the overcharge. Second, it is an insurmountable task to proof that the first buyer could not or would not have raised its prices or maintained supra-competitive prices had the alleged overcharges ceased. Finally, the same difficulty applies in proving that that the first purchaser did not lose sales or profit margin thereafter. Chapter 3 focused exclusively on the Supreme Courts Illinois Brick case where it rejected the <b>indirect</b> <b>purchaser</b> standing. This chapter aimed to explain the Courts reasoning in rejecting the <b>indirect</b> <b>purchaser</b> standing and its exceptions to the <b>indirect</b> <b>purchaser</b> rule. It revealed that the Court barred also indirect purchasers from bringing pass-on antitrust claims under the federal antitrust claims. The Supreme Court rejected standing in Illinois Brick on three grounds: (i) symmetry with Hanover Shoe; (ii) considerations of efficiency and (iii) effectiveness. The Court feared for multiple liability of the defendant. Presumably, the difficulties of proof apply also for the offensive use of passing-on. The Supreme Court also found that indirect purchasers are less likely than direct purchasers to institute actions to recover illegal overcharges. The Court feared further that, even in case if procedural devices are introduced to bring all potential claimants in one single action: the difficulties likely to be encountered in management of [such] a class action would make the procedure equally inadequate. The Court feared, further that apportioning the recoveries among all of the potential will add whole new dimensions of complexity to treble-damage suits and seriously undermine their effectiveness. Chapter 4 was concerned with deciphering the legislative response to the Supreme Courts Illinois Brick decision. This chapter revealed that the Courts decision received a lot of criticism. The force of the criticism has driven the legislator to intervene by proposing legislation to overturn these decisions. In 1978, 1983 and 1990 - 1991 the Congress attempted to overturn the decision but failed to do so. The First Task Force, which has been constituted by the American Bar Association, proposed combining all the claims arising from a violation in one single forum (under one jurisdiction). They argued that this is the only practical alternative to avoid the concerns of the Supreme Court in Illinois Brick. An opt-in regime, aggregating and allocating damages for the whole class in one single forum is proposed. The minority, however, did not agree with these proposals which resulted in a minority report. They argued for an opt-out regime. They argued that, otherwise the claims of all injured persons will be subjected to any favourable or adverse judgment on liability. Instead, the minority proposed a bifurcated procedure as a solution. Under this procedure, the defendants violation and aggregate total damages will be determined first, following which defendants would be dismissed from the case. The minority describes the second stage as follows: If an award was made, the various claimant groups would then litigate between themselves their respective rights to share in the aggregate total and any sums remaining undistributed {{at the conclusion of the}} proceedings would be given to the state governments in the geographic areas affected. However, this procedure is criticized for being too revolutionary. The minority proposed further a class-wide damages assessment. The calculation of damages consists of a two-step procedure of first determining the aggregate damages to the class and then distributing the damage award proportionally among class member. The Congress new attempt to overturn the decision also failed in 1983. The Task Force criticized the proposed legislation because it failed to deal with the fundamental conflict in policy which the Supreme Court has twice resolved, first in Hanover Shoe and then in Illinois Brick. However, the Supreme Court also recognized, as a practical matter, that compensation objectives must sometimes give way to manageability and fairness. In other words, the decisions in Hanover Shoe and Illinois Brick rest at bottom on the inescapable and very real practical problems which are likely to arise in <b>indirect</b> <b>purchaser</b> suits: (i) tracing overcharges; (ii) over-complexity; (iii) possible double recovery; (iv) inconsistent judgments and (v) dilution of interest in enforcing antitrust claims. The Task Force is convinced that the Supreme Courts Illinois Brick decision to bar <b>indirect</b> <b>purchaser</b> claims was founded on valid concerns. Chapter 5 presents itself as another important cornerstone of this thesis. This chapter provided an extensive analysis of the state responses to the Illinois Brick decision. The problems surrounding the passing-on defence and <b>indirect</b> <b>purchaser</b> standing not only divided the academics but also the courts. Some state courts (and the legislator) have clearly accepted vis-à-vis the Supreme Court, the <b>indirect</b> <b>purchaser</b> standing and the defence of passing-on. Others state courts (and legislator) rejected the passing-on defence but allowed the <b>indirect</b> <b>purchaser</b> standing through Illinois Brick repealers. These states have one common feature: the courts in these states have showed that the Supreme Courts overstated concerns are not a reason to reject the <b>indirect</b> <b>purchaser</b> standing and passing-on defence. Here, the courts managed to overcome the Supreme Courts concerns for rejecting both the passing-on defence and <b>indirect</b> <b>purchaser</b> standing. Chapter 6 is finally concerned with the current dual system of antitrust enforcement of the US. The objective of this chapter is to provide a clear understanding of two conflicting views of the US Supreme and state courts regarding the <b>indirect</b> <b>purchaser</b> standing and passing-on defence. Dual enforcement system as currently exists in the US has not only led to inconsistent judgments and uncoordinated litigations in multiple forums. Duplicative federal direct purchaser and state <b>indirect</b> <b>purchaser</b> litigation imposes undue burdens on the judicial system and the parties, wastes resources, increases the risk of duplicative recoveries, skews the parties incentives to settle and hinders efficient global settlements. The Task Force argues that concerns about inconsistent judgments and uncoordinated litigation in multiple forums might be addressed by consolidating in a single court all direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>purchaser</b> actions arising out of the same anticompetitive conduct. However, the Task Force stresses that consolidation alone will not avoid multiple liability. Therefore, the Task Force urges the Congress to provide a mechanism to apportion damages among direct and indirect purchasers. They argue that in the absence of such legislation, consolidation may simply complicate direct purchaser litigation and thereby impair deterrence. PART II Passing-on defence and <b>indirect</b> <b>purchaser</b> standing in Europe Having established the US law on private enforcement, which undoubtedly constitutes a valuable source of inspiration for Europe, the second part focuses on EU and Member State law. Part II considers whether the defence of passing-on and intrinsically linked to it the <b>indirect</b> <b>purchaser</b> standing do or should form part of the EU and national Member States law (Germany, England, Belgium, England and the Netherlands). The focus of chapter 1 is on the antitrust enforcement policy in the EU. The dilemma that emerges, as a policy matter, with regard to the allowance or rejection of passing-on defence andindirect purchaser standing leads to the next question: which objectives, that is deterrence, compensation, efficiency, effectiveness and fairness are most valuated in Europe? The basis of this discussion is that unless a deterrence approach is adopted, the passing-on defence and <b>indirect</b> <b>purchaser</b> standing forms part of EU law. This chapter revealed that both the ECJ and the Commission regard full compensation of all the victims of antitrust infringements as the primary objective of private enforcement. In Europe, as opposed to US, it is generally accepted that any damages award to the victim of any tort should provide for equitable restitution and should not serve as a source of enrichment. Full compensation of all the victims implies further that there can be no a priori as to the standing of all the victims to claim for damages. The ECJ opened the door in Courage and Manfredi to any individual to claim for damages as long as the conditions for tort liability are fulfilled, i. e. proof of infringement, harm and causal link. Chapter 2 provided an extensive analysis of the ECJs long standing case law on the development of EU law principles, rights and remedies. These developments are the milestones in the course of horizontal liability and the right to claim damages from other individuals under EU law. Analysis of the EU right to damages continues in Chapter 3. This chapter focused exclusively on the ECJs twin judgments, i. e. Courage and Manfredi, where it held that there is an EU right to damages for breach of Articles 101 and 102 TFEU, which national Member States must respect. This chapter revealed that it is by all means certain that indirect purchasers do have standing but passing-on defence is an unsolved issue under EU law. Chapter 4 explored the ECJs case law on extra-contractual liability of the EU and Member States. The intention was to draw a general picture of the principles, as established by the ECJ, which also may be used as precedents in the field of private enforcement. Chapter 5 was concerned with the conditions which must be fulfilled to establish horizontal liability for breach of Articles 101 and 102 TFEU. This chapter focused, in particular, on national laws of the Member States in order to analyze how the conditions for horizontal liability (e. g. heads of damages, causation) are applied and whether the national laws offers an effective protection of EU law and comply with the EU principles of effectiveness and equivalence. Chapter 6 formed another vital building block for this work. This chapter is divided in four parts and had a twofold purpose. These four parts discussed what the law (in Germany, England, Belgium and the Netherlands) in relation to the defence of passing-on and <b>indirect</b> <b>purchaser</b> is or should be. The view (passing-on defence and <b>indirect</b> <b>purchaser</b> standing allowed) formed in chapters 1, 2, 3 and reiterated here is that the defence is valid and forms part of the law of tort. The second purpose was to find out whether there is any law (case law) on the legal treatment of these issues in these Member States. Chapter 7 and 8 focused on the ECJs response to the passing-on defence in restitution cases. The ECJ dealt here with the passing-on defence in the context of extra-contractual liability of the EU and monetary liability of the Member States. The ECJ recognized the defence but did not demand it. The focus of chapter 9 was on the essence of passing-on defence in the law of restitution based on unjust enrichment. This chapter is divided in three major parts, i. e. English, Belgian and Dutch law. The intention was to show that the defence of passing-on forms an integral part of the law of restitution based on unjust enrichment. One common feature of these Member States is that unjust enrichment law is compensatory in character. This feature has important consequences for the defence for two reasons. First, the plaintiff should only be entitled to restitution of the defendants enrichment where the claimant has suffered loss. Second, restitution will be denied when the claimant has made good his loss by passing it on. An additional objective of this chapter is to show that the defence of passing-on does not play a role in the undue payment cases. Chapter 10 discussed the European Commissions initiatives, Green, White and Draft Directive. Finally, general conclusions and proposed options are provided. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{landmark}} case of Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, which denied {{standing to}} indirect purchasers to sue antitrust violators, {{has been subjected}} to steady and widespread criticism since it was decided in 1977. Despite three decades of dissatisfaction, however, debate over <b>indirect</b> <b>purchaser</b> standing has failed to generate satisfying solutions that meet the objectives of antitrust law and reflect its underlying principles. We attribute the lack of creative alternatives to an undue emphasis on legal formalism, fostered both by the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s elaboration of the <b>indirect</b> <b>purchaser</b> rule and the doctrine 2 ̆ 7 s failure to recognize the pervasiveness of multilayer supply chains. In this Article, we argue for a return to functionalist antitrust objectives. We review the development of the doctrine, explain its descent into formalism, identify its significant shortcomings, and offer a comprehensive framework that addresses the difficult problem of antitrust standing. Building off that framework, and drawing on lessons from securities law, we propose a mechanism that opens antitrust suits to indirect purchasers, consolidates multiple claims into a single proceeding, and designates a presumptive lead plaintiff. Such a mechanism will enhance the impact of underenforced antitrust laws, restore compensation to injured parties, and reduce the administrative and agency costs of parallel litigation...|$|E

40|$|Resumé The thesis elaborates on the <b>indirect</b> <b>purchaser's</b> {{standing}} in disputes for damages {{caused by a}} breach of competition law. Its main purpose is to describe and, consecutively, compare the American and European approach to private enforcement of competition law or, more specifically, selected aspects of regulation relating to <b>indirect</b> <b>purchasers.</b> It {{should be noted that}} while the roots of the American model of private enforcement date back to the 19 th and 20 th century, Europe started to pay increased attention to this topic in the 21 st century.

40|$|In Motorola Mobility, LLC v. AU Optronics Corporation, the Seventh Circuit {{dismissed}} Motorola’s Sherman Act claims {{under the}} Foreign Trade Antitrust Improvement Act.

The {{effect of the}} Seventh Circuit’s decision precluded injured purchasers from recovering damages under the Sherman Act—Motorola’s subsidiaries could not sue because their injuries occurred abroad, while Motorola could not sue {{because it did not}} make direct purchases from the antitrust violators. Courts have often considered a parent and wholly owned subsidiary as a single economic entity for the purposes of antitrust laws, such as under the <b>indirect</b> <b>purchaser</b> doctrine and intra-enterprise conspiracy doctrine. While parents and subsidiaries are two distinct entities in a legal corporate context, there are certain economic benefits for considering them one unit, such as promoting economic efficiency, supporting the efficient use of international supply chains, and encouraging deterrence. Therefore, basic antitrust inquiries, such as the existence of market power and the possibility of conspiracy, require focusing on the substance, rather than the form, of corporations. This Note seeks to explore why the Seventh Circuit chose not to treat Motorola’s American parent company and wholly owned foreign subsidiaries as a single economic unit. It further analyzes the treatment of the parent-subsidiary relationship under the Sherman Act and Foreign Trade Antitrust Improvement Act.

40|$|This article {{reviews the}} legal {{standards}} and the economics of <b>indirect</b> <b>purchaser</b> cases. Drawn from recent cases on behalf of consumers in the ADM price fixing case, it presents cost pass through models for {{high fructose corn syrup}} (HFCS), one of the alleged price fixes in the wet corn milling industry. If soft drink bottlers, a primary user of HFCS, have fixed proportion production, constant returns to scale, and if other bottlers input prices are unaffected by variations in soft drink output due to the price fix, then the impact of the price fix on bottlers' cost is equal to the increase in the price of HFCS. The extent of pass through of the increase by bottlers is shown to depend critically upon the market structure of the bottling industry and the shape of the retail demand curve. Flexible demand functional forms are needed to avoid constraining estimated pass through rates to levels above or below full, 100 percent, pass through.

40|$|This note extends on our paper Illinois Walls: How barring <b>indirect</b> <b>purchaser</b> suits {{facilitates}} collusion (Schinkel, Tuinstra and RÃ¼ggeberg, 2005, henceforth STR). It presents {{analyses of}} two alternative, more competitive, market structures {{to conclude that}} when the conditions for existence of Illinois Walls derived in STR are satisfied, Illinois Walls also exist in these alternative market structures. Section 1 considers a market in which each downstream firm is able {{to buy and sell}} several varieties of the differentiated product, which increases competition at the downstream level. It is found that Illinois Walls then exist for discount factors higher than a certain critical discount factor, where this critical discount factor is strictly smaller than the critical discount value found in STR. Section 2 studies the case where all wholesalers produce one and the same homogeneous input, which the downstream firms each differentiate into their own variety. In this market structure, competition is strong at the upstream level. Illinois Walls turn out to exist for any positive value of the discount factor. These findings suggest that Illinois Walls are robust to variations in market structure. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the theory and}} experience of United States courts concerning the quantification of harm in antitrust cases. This treatment pertains to both the social cost of antitrust violations, and to the private damage mechanisms that United States antitrust law has developed. It is submitted for the Roundtable on the Quantification of Harm to Competition by National Courts and Competition Agencies, Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), Feb., 2011. In a typical year more than 90 % of antitrust complaints filed in the United States are by private plaintiffs rather than the federal government. Further, when the individual states in our federal system file their actions under federal antitrust law {{they are entitled to}} assert claims for damages as well. The vast majority of private antitrust actions in the United States include a claim for damages, which must be trebled. The damages measure authorized by the Clayton Act is based purely on compensation, and Congress has never seriously considered changing it. As it turns out, compensation for losses is rarely the measure that is also sufficient to produce the optimal level of deterrence of anticompetitive practices. Even {{in the case of a}} simple naked cartel producing no efficiency gains whatsoever, the overcharge measure produces optimal deterrence only if we have some way of knowing ex ante what the probability of detection and successful prosecution is. Trebled damages under United States law would be about right if the probability of cartel detection and prosecution were. 33. In all probability, however, the detection rate for naked cartels is not higher than. 2, making a trebling multiplier too low. In other cases such as mergers and most vertical restraints, the probability of detection is 100 % because the act is either public or else known to the plaintiff from its onset. In such cases trebled damages are probably excessive. The <b>indirect</b> <b>purchaser</b> rule in federal antitrust law in the United States awards the entire overcharge to direct purchasers from the violator, and no damages at all to indirect purchasers except in a few atypical situations. In reality, most damages are passed on, and thus direct purchaser intermediaries are typically overcompensated. Further, nearly all of their harm results from lost output rather than the overcharge itself. As a result, in the typical situation the <b>indirect</b> <b>purchaser</b> rule both mismeasures damages and assigns the damages action to the wrong person...|$|E

40|$|This Article {{deals with}} a problem which has {{repeatedly}} arisen {{in state and federal}} courts, resulting in a number of splintered opinions. In 1977, the Supreme Court ruled that only direct purchasers of a price-fixed product may sue under the Sherman Act. Thus, under the 2 ̆ 2 Illinois Brick rule, 2 ̆ 2 consumers who buy a price-fixed product from a middle-man may not sue. Many states responded by passing 2 ̆ 2 Illinois Brick repealers 2 ̆ 2 which aimed to allow such suits. This Article addresses two questions which have divided the state and federal courts: Did the Illinois Brick repealers grant automatic standing to any <b>indirect</b> <b>purchaser</b> of a price-fixed product, or did they simply repeal the per se rule that indirect purchasers can never sue, leaving the question of which indirect purchasers may sue to a traditional 2 ̆ 2 antitrust standing 2 ̆ 2 analysis? If the latter, to what extent must the traditional antitrust standing doctrine be modified to render it consistent with the policies of the Illinois Brick repealers? Although no academic piece has considered these questions, twenty state and federal courts have-all within the last ten years. This Article summarizes the approaches the courts have taken to both of these questions, criticizes those that have gone wrong in its view, and offers a modified test that is both practical and faithful to the policy choices embodied in the repealers...|$|E
40|$|This article {{seeks to}} answer a {{frequently}} asked question in competition law. Where a cartelist sells to a direct purchaser who passes on the loss to a third party, {{to what extent can}} the cartelist avail himself of a defence that the direct purchaser has passed on the loss, and can the consumer have a direct cause of action against the cartelist? The paper explores how established principles of tort and unjust enrichment can provide an answer to this without distorting settled principles of substantive law and procedure. A. INTRODUCTION Lately there has been significant interest among the competition law community in the private enforcement of competition law. In the English courts private enforcement is possible as either a follow-on action, where a public enforcement body (the Office of Fair Trading in the UK) has already launched a successful action, 1 or a standalone action in the Chancery Division, where there is no public enforcement. 2 Where an undertaking breaks competition law either under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (“ TFEU”) or the Competition Act 1998, the claimant may bring an action for breach of statutory duty. This is more controversial than sometimes acknowledged, but for our purposes we will accept the proposition. 3 When, therefore, for example, a cartelist sells to the direct purchaser at an illegal anticompetitive overcharge, he breaches his statutory duty under the Competition Act 1998, s. 2 or under the European Communities Act 1972, s. 2 (1) in those cases where TFEU, Art. 101 is engaged. The problem with which we are primarily concerned in this paper is where a cartelist (“C”) sells to a direct purchaser (“DP”) who then sells on to an <b>indirect</b> <b>purchaser</b> end user (“ IP”). An important debate takes place around the question whether IP has a cause of action against C. Linked to this is the question whether, if DP sues C, C can claim that DP has passed on its loss and therefore has no recoverable losses, or diminished losses...|$|E

This paper addresses that question. Although the basic framework of the antitrust laws is suitable to deal with current economic conditions, the paper identifies several areas where antitrust can be improved. The paper first examines whether the proper criterion for antitrust should be total or consumer surplus. Then it identifies some key issues {{that need to be}} clarified and explains how they should be clarified. Those issues include market definition, merger policy and the treatment of efficiencies, the interaction of antitrust and intellectual property, exclusionary conduct, the right of <b>indirect</b> <b>purchasers</b> to sue, and the proper allocation of responsibility between regulation and antitrust. ...|$|R
40|$|It {{is clear}} from a cursory {{examination}} of the academic literature in the field that private enforcement is an established, well-developed and vibrant mode of enforcement of US anti trust law, constituting the preponderance of anti trust enforcement activity complemented by public enforcement by the DOJ and FTC. Historically, arange of factors have combined to ensure that private enforcement is effectively the default setting for antitrust enforcement in general, namely the wider litigative culture, the significant period of development of antitrust law and economics, and the specific characeristics of US civil procedure: the rules on discovery, the funding of actions, the availability of class actions {{and the existence of}} treble damages actions, together with clarification(and modification) of the legal position in relation to issues such as the passing on defence and standing for <b>indirect</b> <b>purchasers...</b>|$|R
40|$|Victims of {{antitrust}} violations {{can recover}} damages in court. Yet, the quan-ti cation of antitrust damages {{and to whom}} they accrue is often complex. An illegal price increase somewhere {{in the chain of}} production percolates through to the other layers in a sequence of partial pass-ons. The resulting reductions in sales and input demands lead to additional harm to downstream (in) direct purchasers and upstream suppliers to the cartel, respectively. Nevertheless, U. S. civil antitrust litigation is almost exclusively concerned with direct pur-chaser claims for (treble) damages calculated {{on the basis of the}} overcharge. Similar best practice rules are emerging in Europe. In this paper, we show that the direct purchaser overcharge bears no structural relation to the true harm inicted by a cartel on all of its direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>purchasers</b> and sellers in the chain of production.

50|$|The {{effectiveness}} of the parens patriae provision of HSR was greatly weakened by the Supreme Court's Illinois Brick decision, which substantially limited damages relief to direct <b>purchasers,</b> making consumer <b>indirect</b> <b>purchasers</b> unable to sue. Accordingly, wholesalers or retailers {{might be able to}} sue in federal court in a price-fixing case, even though they passed overcharges on to ultimate consumers, but the consumer purchasers could not; yet, the parens patriae provision in HSR is directed at vindicating the right of those very victims. To some extent, however, this effect was mitigated by the availability of state law and congressional passage of the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 (CAFA), under which class actions can be removed from state court to federal court but state parens patriae actions cannot. Consequently, state attorney generals can pursue price-fixing cases on behalf of the state's consumers under state law in state courts.|$|R
