25|$|In recent {{research}} that builds {{on his work}} in polymerisation, Gilbert has developed {{a new way of}} understanding the biochemistry of the enzymatic processes involved in starch biosynthesis, in collaboration with Dr Melissa Fitzgerald, International Rice Research Institute, Manilla. In this new field, he applied the methods he had developed for understanding molecular-weight distributions in synthetic polymers to understanding those of natural ones. He has thus created a powerful new technique for probing the enzymatic processes in starch biosynthesis in grains, again, creating a methodology to obtain reliable mechanistic knowledge by isolating steps in highly complex systems. Each enzymatic step that creates individual chains—analysed by <b>debranching</b> the starch—can now be associated with particular regions in the molecular-weight distribution of a starch. This supported the applicability of one of two rival mechanistic postulates made by starch biochemists. He has also recently developed a major innovation for solving the vexed problem of quantitatively interpreting data for branched systems.|$|E

L. monocytogenes and S. flexneri both generate a tail {{in the form of}} a [...] "comet tail" [...] that gives them mobility. Each species exhibits small differences in the molecular polymerization mechanism of their [...] "comet tails». [...] Different displacement velocities have been observed, for example, with Listeria and Shigella found to be the fastest. Many experiments have demonstrated this mechanism in vitro. This indicates that the bacteria are not using a myosin-like protein motor, and it appears that their propulsion is acquired from the pressure exerted by the polymerization that takes place near to the microorganism's cell wall. The bacteria have previously been surrounded by ABPs from the host, and as a minimum the covering contains Arp2/3 complex, Ena/VASP proteins, cofilin, a buffering protein and nucleation promoters, such as vinculin complex. Through these movements they form protrusions that reach the neighbouring cells, infecting them as well so that the immune system can only fight the infection through cell immunity. The movement could be caused by the modification of the curve and <b>debranching</b> of the filaments. Other species, such as Mycobacterium marinum and Burkholderia pseudomallei, are also capable of localized polymerization of cellular actin to aid their movement through a mechanism that is centered on the Arp2/3 complex.

A rye arabinoxylan polymer with an initial arabinose/xylose ratio of 0. 53 was <b>debranched</b> with an oxalic acid treatment {{as a function of}} time. The resulting samples contained reduced arabinose/xylose ratios significantly affecting the molecular architecture and solution behavior of the biopolymer. With this treatment, an almost linear xylan with arabinose DS of only 0. 04 was obtained. The removal of arabinose units resulted in the self-assembly of the <b>debranched</b> polymer in water into stable nanoparticle aggregates with a size around 300 nm with a gradual increase in crystallinity of the isolated xylan. Using quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring, the adsorption of xylan onto model cellulose surfaces was quantified. Compared to the nonmodified xylan, the adsorption of <b>debranched</b> xylan increased from 0. 6 to 5. 5 mg m(- 2). Additionally, adsorption kinetics suggest that the nanoparticles rapidly adsorbed to the cellulose surfaces compared to the arabinoxylan.

50|$|A <b>debranching</b> enzyme is a {{molecule}} that helps facilitate {{the breakdown of}} glycogen, {{which serves as a}} store of glucose in the body, through glucosyltransferase and glucosidase activity. Together with phosphorylases, <b>debranching</b> enzymes mobilize glucose reserves from glycogen deposits in the muscles and liver. This constitutes a major source of energy reserves in most organisms. Glycogen breakdown is highly regulated in the body, especially in the liver, by various hormones including insulin and glucagon, to maintain a homeostatic balance of blood-glucose levels. When glycogen breakdown is compromised by mutations in the glycogen <b>debranching</b> enzyme, metabolic diseases such as Glycogen storage disease type III can result.|$|E

Phosphorylase can only cleave α-1,4- glycosidic bond between adjacent glucose molecules in glycogen but branches exist as α-1,6 linkages.

40|$|A gene {{encoding}} an α-l-arabinofuranosidase, designated SaAraf 43 A, was cloned from Streptomyces avermitilis. The deduced {{amino acid}} sequence implies a modular structure consisting of an N-terminal glycoside hydrolase family 43 module and a C-terminal family 42 carbohydrate-binding module (CBM 42). The recombinant enzyme showed optimal activity at pH  6. 0 and 45 °C and was stable over the pH range of 5. 0 – 6. 5 at 30 °C. The enzyme hydrolyzed p-nitrophenol (PNP) -α-l-arabinofuranoside but did not hydrolyze PNP-α-l-arabinopyranoside, PNP-β-d-xylopyranoside, or PNP-β-d-galactopyranoside. <b>Debranched</b> 1, 5 -arabinan was hydrolyzed by the enzyme but arabinoxylan, arabinogalactan, gum arabic, and arabinan were not. Among the synthetic regioisomers of arabinofuranobiosides, only methyl 5 -O-α-l-arabinofuranosyl-α-l-arabinofuranoside was hydrolyzed by the enzyme, while methyl 2 -O-α-l-arabinofuranosyl-α-l-arabinofuranoside and methyl 3 -O-α-l-arabinofuranosyl-α-l-arabinofuranoside were not. These data suggested that the enzyme only cleaves α- 1, 5 -linked arabinofuranosyl linkages. The analysis of the hydrolysis product of arabinofuranopentaose suggested that the enzyme releases arabinose in exo-acting manner.

Removal of the module decreased the activity of the enzyme with regard to <b>debranched</b> arabinan.

30|$|The {{arabinan}} is soluble in water, while <b>debranched</b> arabinan {{produced by}} α-l-arabinofuranosidases is insoluble {{in cold water}} [5]. In fruit and vegetable juice processing, α-l-arabinofuranosidases in the enzyme preparations cause haze formation due to the precipitation of polymeric <b>debranched</b> arabinans. Since linear arabinan is the best substrate for endo- 1, 5 -α-l-arabinanases [6], endo-arabinanases {{can be applied to}} prevent haze formation by degrading polymeric <b>debranched</b> arabinan [7],[8]. In addition, as arabinan was one of the major components in plant cell wall, endo-arabinanase used in juice industry can also improve the yield of juice because they can promote the degradation of the pectin in the fruit and vegetable [9]. Endo-arabinanases from several microorganisms have been characterized. Their optimal temperatures are 50 °C for Aspergillus niger[10], 60 °C for Bacillus subtilis[11] and Penicillium chrysogenum[12], 70 °C for Bacillus thermodentrificans[13], and 73 °C for Thermotoga petrophila[14]. Compared with the mesophilic and thermophilic endo-arabinanases, cold-active endo-arabinanases should be more attractive in juice industry as colder conditions hamper spoilage and avoid changes in nutritional properties [15]. However, cold-active endo-arabinanases were less reported.|$|R
