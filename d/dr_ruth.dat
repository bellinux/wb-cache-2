Meanwhile, Two-Face's mental condition has deteriorated as a result of Adams' therapy; she replaced Two-Face's trademark coin with a six-sided die then a tarot deck, in each instance increasing the number of choices he has (as opposed to two choices from his original coin) in the hope that he will eventually not leave any of his choices up to chance. Instead, the treatment renders him incapable of even making simple decisions, such as going to the bathroom.|$|E

The Springfield Waxworks' Chamber of Horrors contains Mr. T, Ronald Reagan and <b>Dr.</b> <b>Ruth,</b> and Laramie's mascot Menthol Moose is a parody of Joe Camel.

500|$|Other casting {{choices were}} Broadway actor Jerry Orbach as Dr. Jake Houseman, Baby's father; and Jane Brucker as Lisa Houseman, her older sister.

Another role went to Bergstein's friend, New York radio personality [...] "Cousin Brucie". She initially wanted him to portray the social director but then later asked him to play {{the part of the}} magician. The role of the social director went to the then unknown Wayne Knight (of later Seinfeld and 3rd Rock from the Sun fame). The part of Baby's mother was originally given to Lynne Lipton, who is briefly visible in the beginning, when the Houseman family first pulls into Kellerman's (she is in the front seat for a few seconds; her blonde hair is the only indication), but she became ill {{during the first week of}} shooting and was replaced by actress Kelly Bishop, who had already been cast to play Vivian Pressman, the highly sexed resort guest.

In 1993, Westheimer and Israeli TV host, Arad Nir, hosted a talk show in Hebrew, titled Min Tochnit, on the newly opened Israeli Channel 2. The show was similar to her US Sexually Speaking show.
