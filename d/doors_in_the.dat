5|$|In 1961, {{the castle}} was leased for 22 years by Anthony and Bunty Kinsman, {{at a cost}} of £1,000. The {{property}} required extensive structural repairs and renovations in order to be made habitable, which the Kinsmans undertook over the next two years. The construction work cost £8,596, and some financial support was provided by the Ministry of Works in exchange for the castle being opened to the public for the next fifteen years. The new oak <b>doors</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> castle were fitted with iron hinges that had originally been used in nearby Lowther Castle. In 1967, the castle was visited by Princess Sharada Shah, the daughter of the King Mahendra of Nepal, as part of an official trip to the UK.|$|E
5|$|The {{apartment}} block {{was not a}} gated complex. Located {{on the corner of}} Rua Dr Agostinho da Silva and Rua Dr Francisco Gentil Martins, 5A was accessible to the public from two sides. Sliding glass patio <b>doors</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> living room at the back overlooked the Ocean Club's pool, tennis courts, tapas restaurant and bar. The patio doors could be accessed via a public street, Rua Dr Francisco Gentil Martins, where a small gate and set of steps led to 5A's balcony and living room. 5A's front door was {{on the opposite side of}} the block from the Ocean Club, on Rua Dr Agostinho da Silva.|$|E
5|$|The {{layout of}} tombs {{dug into the}} sides of {{mountains}} typically had a front chamber, side chambers, and a rear chambers designed to imitate a complex of aboveground halls. The tomb of King Liu Sheng (d. 113 BCE) in Hebei province not only had a front hall with window drapes and grave goods, carriages and horses in the southern separate side chamber, and storage goods in the northern side chamber, but also the remains of real timber houses with tiled roofs erected within (along with a house made of stone slabs and two stone <b>doors</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rear chamber). Doors made completely out of stone were found in many Han tombs as well as tombs in later dynasties.|$|E

5|$|The musical {{style of}} The Book of Taliesyn {{is a mix}} of {{progressive}} rock, psychedelic rock and hard rock and different observers think that in this album the band is more mature and in greater control of its own means of expression. Critics highlight how the compositions are generally longer and more complex than in their debut album. Deep Purple biographer Dave Thompson writes that a dark mood permeates The Book of Taliesyn with little indulgence to pop rock, citing influences of the American band The <b>Doors</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> original tracks written for this album.|$|E
5|$|As Galván left a Farmacia Guadalajara {{drugstore}} {{near his}} home in Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas, on the evening of 27 February 2014, he was kidnapped along with businessman Miguel Ángel Ortiz. His vehicle was discovered abandoned with open <b>doors</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pharmacy's parking lot by his wife. The following day, a disfigured corpse found in the trunk of a pickup truck in the town of García, Nuevo León, was taken to the hospital of the Autonomous University of Nuevo León. After more than a month of forensic examination, experts officially identified the corpse as that of Galván on 31 March 2014. Post-mortem reports concluded that Galván had been tortured before being killed with a coup de grâce. The exact location of Galván's murder remains unknown, although authorities tend to believe he was most likely killed in Tamaulipas.|$|E
5|$|Between March 1926 and September 1928, the CLR {{converted}} the remaining gate stock carriages in phases. The end platforms were enclosed {{to provide additional}} passenger accommodation and two sliding doors were inserting in each side. The conversions increased capacity and allowed the CLR to remove gatemen from the train crews, with responsibility for controlling doors moving to the two guards who each managed half the train. Finally, the introduction of driver/guard communications in 1928 allowed the CLR to dispense with the second guard, reducing a train crew to just a driver and a guard. The addition of <b>doors</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sides of cars caused problems at Wood Lane where {{the length of the}} platform {{on the inside of the}} returning curve was limited by an adjacent access track into the depot. The problem was solved by the introduction of a pivoted section of platform which usually sat above the access track and allowed passengers to board trains as normal, but which could be moved to allow access to the depot.|$|E

5|$|For the {{extension}} to Queen's Park, the LER supplemented the {{existing rolling stock}} with 14 new carriages ordered from Brush Traction and Leeds Forge Company plus spare Gate stock carriages from the GNP These carriages, the 1914 stock, {{were the first to}} have <b>doors</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sides of the carriages as well as the ends. For the longer extension to Watford, the LER and the LNWR ordered 72 new carriages from the Metropolitan Railway Carriage and Wagon Company. Manufacture of this rolling stock was delayed by the war, and, while it was waiting for delivery, the Bakerloo Tube used spare 1915 stock carriages ordered for an unfinished extension of the CLR to Ealing Broadway and more spare Gate stock carriages from the GNP Delivery of the carriages for the Watford service, known as the Watford Joint stock because ownership was shared with the LNWR, began in 1920; they were painted in the LNWR's livery to distinguish them from trains operating only on the Bakerloo Tube's tracks.|$|E
5|$|From November 1984 to June 1987 the DeKalb County Courthouse {{underwent}} {{an interior}} restoration, which {{was completed in}} time for the sesquicentennial celebration for DeKalb County. The restoration, at an approximate cost of $100,000, was undertaken by Conrad Schmitt Studios of New Berlin, Wisconsin. The modern front doors to the courthouse hide the original, beveled glass front doors from view. Once inside the modern doors, the nonfunctional original doors can be seen, standing wide open, to be admired; each door weighs several hundred pounds. Past the <b>doors,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> building's main lobby, is the large, marble staircase to the second floor. The staircase, as well as the lobby's wainscoting, is done in gray Tennessee marble. Most of the first floor is original to the building, including the hexagonal marble flooring, stained glass windows and two original, first floor courtrooms. The plasterwork along the walls and ceilings of the lobby is ornately decorated.|$|E
5|$|The District Railway ordered 60 x 7-car {{electric}} {{trains in}} 1903. A {{third of the}} vehicles were made in England, the rest in Belgium and France and electrical equipment was installed on arrival at Ealing Common Works. Access was by sliding doors, double <b>doors</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> centre and single doors at either end. First and third class accommodation were provided in open saloons with electric lighting. The seats were covered with rattan in third class and plush in first. From 1906 the standard formation was six cars, with {{an equal number of}} motor and trailer cars running in either two or four car formations off-peak. By 1910 the District required additional rolling stock and ordered cars largely constructed of steel. The first batch arrived in 1911, followed by more in 1912 from a different manufacturer but to a similar design. Further cars arrived in 1914 with an elliptical roof instead of the clerestory roof on the earlier designs. In 1920 the District took delivery of new cars, incompatible with the existing fleet, with three hand-operated double sliding doors on each side.|$|E

5|$|The {{day after}} this tragedy, {{workers in the}} unorganized leather {{industry}} of Topsia area held protest rallies demanding compensation for the relatives of the deceased workers, better working conditions and a probe into the fire mishap. The mayor of Kolkata convened an all-party meeting to discuss the incident and also promised to initiate a drive demolish illegal constructions in the area. The labour inspectors inspected the building and declared the factory as illegal. Even though the building was declared illegal and unsafe, a month later, the police raided the house and found that another leather factory was operating behind closed <b>doors</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ground floor of the building. The civic officials issued a notice to stop any work in the building. Though local residents alleged that clandestine work started in the building {{with the help of}} local MLA, Javen Khan, Khan himself blamed it rather on the police.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the game, {{the player}} must {{investigate}} the surroundings through finding and entering doors. These doors contain shops where players can buy equipment, rooms which provide additional information {{needed in the}} quest, traps which contain powerful enemies, and exits {{to the next level}} which can be opened after finding a key. Some of the <b>doors</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> game are hidden and can only be found through by trial and error. At the beginning of the game, shops are visible and are clearly marked with the appropriate signs. Later on in the game, as Wonder Boy gets closer to the MEKA Dragon, the shop doors become unmarked while others are traps set by the level's bosses; {{near the end of the}} game, many of the shops are invisible and contain more powerful weapons. There are four types of shops throughout the game: boot shops allow the player to buy boots which make Wonder Boy jump higher and run faster, armor shops contain armor which makes Wonder Boy incur less damage from enemy attacks, shield shops contain shields which allow him to repel fire from enemies, and magical shops allow players to purchase Magic Weapons. There are also various rooms in the game which the player can enter and receive additional assistance in the quest: taverns where players can buy drinks and receive information from the bartender, Fortune Teller rooms where players may receive information about future events, and hospitals which allow players to refill their life meter and Hourglass Timer for a small price. Other rooms contain a boss in which the player must defeat to get the key to the next level, to earn additional gold, or to upgrade to a more powerful sword.|$|E
