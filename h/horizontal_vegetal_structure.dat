40|$|International audienceWithin {{the scope}} of {{environmental}} modelling, convective heat transfer between a <b>vegetal</b> <b>structure</b> and its surrounding medium remains to be adequately described. However, for some applications, such as forest fire modelling, convective heat transfer {{is one of the}} factors responsible for vertical fire transitions, from ground level to the tree crowns. These fires are the most dangerous because their rates of spread can reach high speeds, around 1 m per second. An accurate characterization of this transfer is therefore important for fire propagation modelling. This study presents an attempt to formulate an analytical modelling of the convective heat transfer coefficient inside <b>vegetal</b> <b>structures</b> generated using an Iterated Function Systems (IFS) which only depends on the IFS parameters (parameters helpful to generate <b>vegetal</b> <b>structures).</b> The results obtained using this formula are compared with previously computed numerical results to evaluate their accuracy. The maximal discrepancies were found to be around 6 % which proves the efficiency of the present model...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Uses of {{medicinal}} plants by {{people around the}} world significantly contribute and guide biologically active compounds research that can be useful in the combat against various diseases. Due to a great chemical and structural variety found in their <b>vegetal</b> <b>structures</b> it consolidates ethnopharmacology as an important science for the pharmaceutical section. Inserted in the diversity of {{medicinal plants}}, is the Maytenus genus, whose research has already revealed lots of isolated substances which are responsible for a great variety of biological activities, among which we cite analgesic and anti-inflammatory, for the treatment of inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, gastritis, ulcers and gastrointestinal disorders. The aim of this review article is to make a compendium of the Maytenus genus and its isolated chemical compounds, among them tingenone. The elucidation of its mechanism of action reveals promising sources for the development of new drugs specially targeted for the treatment of painful inflammatory diseases...|$|R
40|$|Phytotherapy {{is defined}} as the use of {{medicinal}} plants for therapeutic purposes and it uses a variety of complex <b>vegetal</b> <b>structures.</b> In public health, it is considered a type of alternative medicine, in which auto medication with herbs is common and {{there is a lack of}} quality assurance of herbal products. While the World Health Organization is proposing strategies to include complementary and alternative therapies as public health tools, in Chile this type of therapy is emerging. There is a lack of interest and underestimation of conventional medicine towards popular knowledge. At the present time, the Chilean Ministry of Health has recognized 103 plants aiming to promote the use of medicinal plants that are registered and certifed, according to the regulations of the National Control System of Pharmaceutical Products. Therefore, health care professionals should be educated about the association between pharmaceutical products and medicinal plants. Consultation systems about Phytotherapy should also be available, information should be provided about where to purchase safe herbal products and publicity about these products should be regulated...|$|R
40|$|The {{regularity}} of spiders orb webs {{has been}} considered a fascinating natural wonder by generations of naturalists. Although the majority of spider species build irregular three-dimensional networks, those who have evolved the two- dimensional spiral snare have drawn {{most of the attention}} (Vollrath, 1988). Even studies conducted on irregular webs are often explicitly devoted to the search of similarities with orb webs, resulting from behavioral preadaptations to this specific design (Eberhard, 1987, 1992). So the question of the distance between attachment points in an environ- ment that does not feature intrinsinc regulating properties, like a three-dimen- sional web or <b>vegetal</b> <b>structure,</b> remains widely open. In the overall context of swarming in the cooperative spider Anelosimus eximius (Furey et al, in prepa- ration), our focus was on amplification mechanisms involved in group cohesion and coordination of several individuals' activities. From these observations, it appears that dragline attachment pattern has a direct influence on network design, and consequently on the population transfer's dynamics, which is confirmed by theoretical projections about the efficiency of silk-mediated exploratory recruit- ment (Saffre et al, 1997, in press) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. As {{radiative}} transfer {{plays a key}} role in the forest fire propagation process, an accurate knowledge for the radiative properties of the vegetation has to be defined. Indeed, the {{radiative transfer}} is mainly depending on the extinction coefficient value. This coefficient for every kind of vegetation is usually evaluated using the well-known De Mestre correlation. This relation does not take into account the leaf orientation and position. In order to evaluate the role of the leaf orientation and position on the extinction coefficient, a realistic <b>vegetal</b> <b>structure</b> is numerically created using Leaf Area Index data from measurements on real trees, De Wit’s model to represent the leaf orientation and fractal geometry to compute the tree structure. A ray-tracing method is used to simulate the radiative transfer inside the numerical tree. Then, the extinction coefficient is computed as the inverse of the mean free path between two extinction events. A sensitivity study is conducted on the extinction coefficient according to the radiation propagation direction. The paper will present the discrepancies between the De Mestre correlation and the numerical results in order to evaluate the role of the leaf orientation and position in the extinction coefficient determination...|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{identify}} possible allelopathic effects of leaf aqueous extracts of Baccharis dracunculifolia DC., Pilocarpus pennatifolius Lem., Cyperus rotundus L., Morus rubra L., Casearia sylvestris Sw., and Plectranthus barbatus Andr. on the germination and initial growth of Lactuca sativa L., Brassica oleracea L. cv. capitata, B. oleracea L. cv. italica, B. pekinenses L., B. campestris L., Lycopersicum esculentum Miller, and Eruca sativa L. To obtain the aqueous extracts, leaves previously dried at a 1 g. 10 mL- 1 concentration were used, diluted in six solutions (10, 30, 50, 70, 90, and 100 %) and compared to control, distilled water, with five replications of 10 seeds for all vegetable species. The aqueous extracts of all species showed allelopathic potential for germination of seeds, the germination speed index, {{and the initial}} growth of shoots and roots of vegetable crops. The aqueous extracts of C. rotundus and P. barbatus promoted lower and higher allelopathic effects, respectively, and the <b>vegetal</b> <b>structure</b> mostly affected by the extracts was the primary root. The results indicate the existence of allelopathic potential in the species tested, so there’s a need for adopting care procedures when cultivating vegetables with them...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Modern biotechnologies {{offer the}} {{possibility}} to multiplication the biologic <b>vegetal</b> <b>structures</b> by shaping the morphological phenomena (organogenesis or embryogenesis), which ensure both the maintenance of their characteristic elements {{as well as their}} multiplication in a number of units as extended as possible, starting with a certain type of explant and its intrinsic capacity, according to which, under the influence of in vitro culture, certain cells pertaining to it manifest properties specific to stem vegetal cells. In consequence, the aim of the experimental researches presented in this study was the innovation of in vitro multiplication at Brussels cabbage (Brassica oleracea L. convar. oleracea var. gemmifera), from subvarieties Rosella and Sanda, by direct caulogenesis induced under the influence of explant type (leaf, cotyledon, epicotyl, hypocotyl and radicle) and through direct rhizogenesis induced under the influence of exogenous auxin type (NAA or IBA). The best caulogenesis response in case of each of the two subvarieties of Brussels cabbage (Brassica oleracea L. convar. oleracea var. gemmifera) was recorded by experimental variant that consisted of using the explants of cotyledon type. While the best direct rhizogenesis response at Rosella subvariety of Brussels cabbage (Brassica oleracea L. convar. oleracea var. gemmifera) was recorded on experimental variant that consisted of using NAA exogenous auxin 0. 25 mg/l, and in case of Sanda subvariety of Brussels cabbage (Brassica oleracea L. convar. oleracea var. gemmifera) the best direct rhizogenesis response was recorded on experimental variant that consisted of using IBA exogenous auxin 0. 75 mg/l...|$|R
40|$|The {{plant cell}} wall {{can be the}} optimal scale of {{investigation}} for understanding the properties and the variability of <b>vegetal</b> organs <b>structure.</b> At the molecular scale, the wall constituents’ organisation might have a strong influence on theses properties. Primary cell walls are separated into monocotyledons (cereals) and dicotyledons (fleshy fruits) {{depending on the type}} of molecules involved (cellulose, hemicelluloses, pectin, etc.). These polymers structures and concentration within the cell wall change during the organ development (i. e., growth and maturation). Cell wall models built from commercial polymers have been used in the literature to study the influence of these components and their organisation on cell wall mechanical properties. However these analogs, although they’re interesting, don’t take into account the molecule modification with time (growth and maturation) and space (organisation within the tissue) or the change of the hydration state of the wall with time. The first step of our work consists in developing a specific static tensile test adapted to thin film analogs made of polymers extracted at different growth step of the organ. These tests are made in a temperature and humidity controlled environment. Due to their low thickness (around some tenth of micrometre at best), these films are particularly difficult to handle and the mechanical measurements are thus coupled with an image stereo-correlation device. It allows us to measure the strain fields at the surface of the sample, even if it is not perfectly plane, and thus to check the real loading of the film. Finally, this measurement technique allows us to measure the elastic longitudinal modulus of the film together with its Poisson’s ratio without any effect of the tensile machine stiffness or occurrence of slippage in the loading grips...|$|R
5000|$|Periods and Styles of Nutiu’s oeuvreFollowing Nutiu’s oeuvre {{through the}} decades helped {{to define the}} {{different}} stages of his artistic unfolding. The first steps towards abstraction were the modular compositions from the early 60s, {{all of which were}} paintings on canvas. At the same time he also created objects called assemblage, by using different canvases stuck on each other which created a three dimensional effect. Nutiu was always tempted to expand his works beyond the canvas, by leaving the bi-dimensionality. He referred to the works of this period as Utopias.After composing these objects he returned to painting and began a theme called Dynamic Universe; these paintings were made in the 1970s. In this period Nutiu got the idea to build several vessels with dimensions of about 160x160 cm having a depth of 10 cm, which he filled with water and industrial paints that were usually used to paint cars. These colours could not be absorbed by the water, and floated by their own inertia creating unforeseen shapes. The artist influenced those shapes by intervening with a bar until he liked the outcome. Subsequently he arranged a canvas on the water’s surface. The canvas absorbed the paint composition which was a moment earlier in the water. Generally the canvas was covered entirely of these [...] "risky effects" [...] produced in print. In some cases Nutiu intervened with a few brushstrokes or he erased some areas. [...] The very innovative object in space [...] "Sapte forme pictate" [...] (means seven painted shapes) from 1969 was also achieved with this technology transfer in water, while some areas have been painted over.In the 1980s Nutiu was inspired by <b>vegetal</b> <b>structures,</b> especially roots and he subsequently labelled this phase of his artistic production as Sections through Fertile Soil. This title clearly reveals that his abstract works were inspired by nature. Further to this title he was also a passionate fly fisherman and he confessed that the roots of the plants and trees he observed {{on the other side of}} the shore inspired him.In the 1990s Nutiu entitled his body of work Beyond Appearances. The paintings became more graphic and symbolical which is evidenced seen in the artwork Blue Universe from 1999.The paintings were of course abstract and in the 1990s extremely colourful, sometimes colour spots surrounded by a line like a cloisonné. At the end of the 1990s he was attracted by water - running in rivers or falling in cascades and until the early 2000s he was extremely engaged with this subject.In the last years of his life Nutiu returned to his earlier themes, one of which was Sections through Fertile Soil. For Romul Nutiu the source of inspiration is especially the plant, its stem and root, as it feeds from the soil and returns fertility to it and in this permanent struggle for survival it is akin to man. [...] He re-explored painting the element of water as he had done at the beginning of the 2000s. In 2011 Nutiu achieved his largest painting called Dionysiacal Space which was almost 3 metres long and 2 metres wide. This monumental work is although structured also directed by spontaneous intuition and reveals the semantic complexity of the artist.Throughout his life Nutiu’s art always evolved and challenged himself to try new paths and develop new techniques. Although Nutiu used different dimensions of canvases, in his eyes, any surface could become a territory and was able to involve any kind of shades, plans, volumes of colour and different tonalities. This means that he did not need a certain type of canvas or a size as he used his colours and geometrical forms in a way that fit onto every surface. Nutiu had always expressed interest in objects and the objectual space as it could offer him a new field to reveal his spirit. While making objects in space he used the same attitude towards colour, but complicated the conformation so the objects would gain individuality. Sometimes the object could be perceived from all sides and therefore had a higher autonomy. [...] Nutiu above all remained a painter in everything he did whether he used wood panels or sheets of paper; colour was always one essential dynamic that kept all his works together. He liked to play with colour and transferred all his emotions and tensions into it; this can be seen when one observes the canvas directly. He always painted abstract, gestural resulting in experimental art. Nutiu also thought about the objectual reality of the image he painted, that there should be a sensitivity to grasp it. His art could be described as a synthesis between lyricism and rationalism. Most of his works have allegorical meanings.|$|R

La ceramica sovradipinta bizantina di Gortina. p. 1 - 304, PADOVA:Aldo Ausilio Editore in Padova-Bottega d"Erasmo, ISBN: 978 - 88 - 6125 - 071 - 0 The Byzantine painted pottery {{from the}} Gortys {{excavations}} represents {{a new class}} among the painted pottery productions which spread over the Mediterranean basin {{since the end of}} the 6 th century AD. 	The first finds came to light around the mid-fifties during the excavations in the Temple of Athena on the acropolis (Haghios Ioannis hill), but the greatest number of fragments comes from the upper town and, particularly, from the Byzantine quarter between the Pretorio and the Apollo Pythios temple: here, the finding of a ceramic factory site with a small kiln shows that this class is a local production. 	The pottery bears simple linear painted decoration in red or dark brown, over a light brown or clay-coloured slip. The closed forms are amphoras, jugs, bottles, flasks, juglets, bowls; they are decorated on the shoulders with long coupled leaves, <b>horizontal</b> waves, stylized <b>vegetal</b> patterns and groups of diverging lines. 	The open forms include carinated bowls, dishes and basins. The carinated bowls can be considered a fine ware, because of their high technical standards and their great variability in decorative patterns. These latter include motifs such as stylized plants, crosses and birds. The edge of the dishes is decorated with oblique and parallel lines, the rims with colour drops and the inner surface with fishes or small stylized twigs. 	In the production of this pottery class one can distinguish three chronological phases: 	 1. from the end of the 6 th century AD to the earthquake of 618 AD; 	 2. from the earthquake in 618 to the following earthquake of 670 AD; 	 3. from the 670 earthquake to the end of the 8 th century AD. 	The first phase is the one least known, and the very bulk of production is dated after 618 AD. The closed forms are definetly more common than the open ones. The basic forms and the motifs do not show major changes during the two more important phase (from the 1 st half of the 7 th century to the 8 th century AD). 	The Byzantine painted pottery of Gortys can be placed, then, in the wide context of the several ceramic painted productions flourished all around the Mediterranean sea between the end of the 6 th and the 7 th century: in Greek-Aegean area, the dishes and the bowls with vegetal patterns, called “Central Greek Painted Wares” by John Hayes; in Egypt, the painted productions of Alessandria, Antinoe and Kellia; in Syria, Palestine and Jordan the s. c. “Gerash bowls”, the Nabataean bowls and the Omayyad painted pottery with linear and spiral decoration patterns. And painted productions with predominantly regional movement have been identified over the past thirty years, as it is known, also in Central and Southern Italy (Abruzzo, Basilicata, Puglia, Calabria and Sicily). However, the original decorative repertoire of Gortys pottery, devoid of precise similarities with the other contemporary productions, reaffirms its genuine character of local and typical manufacture of Crete island during the first two centuries of Byzantine age...|$|R
