5|$|Alien Soldier was {{released}} in 1995 on a physical cartridge format in Australia, <b>Europe</b> <b>and</b> <b>Japan.</b> In North America, the game was delivered exclusively through the Sega Channel cable service. Released late in the Mega Drive's lifecycle and {{after the release of}} the Sega Saturn, Alien Soldier pushed the system to its technical limits. Suganami wished he continued working on it after release, believing he could have improved on the story and graphics. Years later, Yosuke Okunari of Treasure addressed concerns that Alien Soldier {{was released}} as an incomplete game, stating that the notion is only derived from Suganami having originally had large ambitions that were never realized.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{mushrooms}} enjoy usage as therapeutics in folk medicines, such as Traditional Chinese medicine. Notable medicinal mushrooms with a well-documented {{history of}} use include Agaricus subrufescens, Ganoderma lucidum, and Ophiocordyceps sinensis. Research has identified compounds produced by {{these and other}} fungi that have inhibitory biological effects against viruses and cancer cells. Specific metabolites, such as polysaccharide-K, ergotamine, and β-lactam antibiotics, are routinely used in clinical medicine. The shiitake mushroom {{is a source of}} lentinan, a clinical drug approved for use in cancer treatments in several countries, including Japan. In <b>Europe</b> <b>and</b> <b>Japan,</b> polysaccharide-K (brand name Krestin), a chemical derived from Trametes versicolor, is an approved adjuvant for cancer therapy.|$|E
5|$|In 1905 the USDA {{initiated}} {{its first}} large-scale biological control program, sending entomologists to <b>Europe</b> <b>and</b> <b>Japan</b> {{to look for}} natural enemies of the gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar dispar, and brown-tail moth, Euproctis chrysorrhoea, invasive pests of trees and shrubs. As a result, nine parasitoids (solitary wasps) of gypsy moth, seven of brown-tail moth, and two predators of both moths became established in the USA. Although the gypsy moth was not fully controlled by these natural enemies, the frequency, duration, and severity of its outbreaks were reduced and the program was regarded as successful. This program also {{led to the development}} of many concepts, principles, and procedures for the implementation of biological control programs.|$|E

5|$|Tecmo {{specifically}} targeted Ninja Gaiden at {{a western}} audience, and despite difficulties in obtaining content ratings {{due to the}} game's graphic depictions of violence, it was generally well received, and 362,441 copies were sold in North America {{in the first month}} after its release. Nevertheless, the game had to be censored for release in some regions, and Japanese sales were poor, with only 60,000 in the four months following its release. Making use of the Xbox's internet connectivity, Ninja Gaiden was the focus of a series of online contests across North America, <b>Europe</b> <b>and</b> <b>Japan.</b> Record-breaking numbers of players took part, competing for places in the live final, which was held during the Tokyo Game Show (TGS) 2004.|$|E
