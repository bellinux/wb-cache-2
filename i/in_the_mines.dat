5|$|At {{the age of}} 15 he was an {{offered a}} trial at Leeds United, where his uncle Jim was left back, but turned it down and instead joined his father <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mines.</b> He worked <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mines</b> {{for a short time}} but handed in his notice after finding out just how {{difficult}} and unpleasant it was to work deep underground. He applied to join the police and reconsidered the offer from Leeds United. His trial game for Leeds clashed with his police interview, and Charlton chose to play in the game; the trial was a success and he joined the ground staff at Elland Road.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{introduction}} of the mechanical ore crusher in 1804 the tasks traditionally carried out by bal maidens began to be mechanised. Despite this, the rapid growth of the mines in comparison to the slow spread of mechanisation meant the number of bal maidens appears to have risen steadily, although statistics for the number of women employed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mines</b> {{in the early days of}} industrialisation are incomplete and a few are contradictory.|$|E

5|$|Negotiations resumed in Denver on June 2, and {{the parties}} reached an {{agreement}} on June 4. The agreement provided for resumption of the $3.00-per-day wage and the eight-hour day.

5|$|The {{pulling power}} of the Trait du Nord made it popular for use during the Industrial Revolution of the late 19th century in heavy industry, {{including}} mining. In mines, steam engines and internal combustion engines {{could not be used}} due to the possibility of a gas explosion. The first horses were used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mines</b> in 1821 and the Trait du Nord quickly became a favorite for hauling carts <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mines</b> and operating the pulleys used to lift coal to the surface. Breeders worked to adapt the breed to mining requirements, and the breed became larger as more power was needed to pull heavier loads. Good horses were able to pull , usually around twelve cars worth, along a railway. As early as 1920, the usage of horses in mines began to decline as electric locomotives came into use, and in 1969 the last horse was removed from the mines.|$|E
5|$|The story centres on Bond's {{investigation}} of a diamond-smuggling ring originating <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mines</b> of Sierra Leone and ends in Las Vegas. Along the way Bond meets and {{falls in love with}} {{one of the members of}} the smuggling gang, Tiffany Case. Much of Fleming's background research formed the basis for his non-fiction 1957 book The Diamond Smugglers. Diamonds Are Forever deals with international travel, marriage and the transitory nature of life.|$|E

5|$|Chiquimula de la Sierra ("Chiquimula in the Highlands") was {{inhabited}} by Ch'orti' Maya {{at the time}} of the conquest. The first Spanish reconnaissance of this region took place in 1524. In 1526 three Spanish captains invaded Chiquimula on the orders of Pedro de Alvarado. The indigenous population soon rebelled against excessive Spanish demands, but the rebellion was quickly put down in April 1530. However, the region was not considered fully conquered until a campaign by Jorge de Bocanegra in 1531–1532 that also took in parts of Jalapa. The afflictions of Old World diseases, war and overwork <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mines</b> and encomiendas took a heavy toll on the inhabitants of eastern Guatemala, to the extent that indigenous population levels never recovered to their pre-conquest levels.|$|E
5|$|Even before Haywood {{first became}} an {{official}} with the Western Federation of Miners, {{he was convinced that}} the system under which working people toiled was unjust. He described the execution of the Haymarket leaders in 1887 as a turning point in his life, predisposing him toward membership in the largest organization of the day, the Knights of Labor. Haywood had watched men die in unsafe mine tunnels, and had marched with Kelly's Army. He had suffered a serious hand injury <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mines,</b> and found that his only support came from other miners. When Haywood listened to Ed Boyce of the WFM addressing a group of miners in 1896, he discovered radical unionism and welcomed it.|$|E
5|$|Henry Moore {{was born}} in Castleford, West Riding of Yorkshire, England, to Mary Baker and Raymond Spencer Moore. His father was of Irish origin and became pit deputy and then under-manager of the Wheldale {{colliery}} in Castleford. He was an autodidact {{with an interest in}} music and literature. Determined that his sons would not work <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mines,</b> he saw formal education as the route to their advancement. Henry was the seventh of eight children in a family that often struggled with poverty. He attended infant and elementary schools in Castleford, where he began modelling in clay and carving in wood. He professed to have decided to become a sculptor when he was eleven after hearing of Michelangelo's achievements at a Sunday School reading.|$|E

5|$|It {{appears that}} during the 18thcentury copper boom, it was {{customary}} throughout the Cornish mining industry to use bal maidens purely as casual labour. There are no records of bal maidens being contracted to a particular mine or paid a piece-rate {{for the amount of}} work done. Instead, mine accounts invariably show them being paid a fixed daily rate and employed only as and when they were needed. When poor weather conditions made surface-level work impossible, water shortages meant water-powered machinery could not operate, or accidents <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mines</b> caused a temporary closure, the bal maidens would be suspended.|$|E
5|$|Joe {{received}} little formal schooling. Due to the transient lifestyle of coal miners, {{his family moved}} frequently during his childhood. The McGinnitys moved to Gallatin County in 1878. Two days {{after the birth of}} their seventh child, Peter died in an accident. At the age of eight, Joe and his older brothers went to work <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mines</b> to support their family. In 1880, the family moved to Springfield, Illinois, where Joe and his brothers worked for the Springfield Coal Company. They moved to Decatur, Illinois less than six months later, continuing to mine coal, while their mother cleaned houses.|$|E
5|$|Parry {{was born}} in Merthyr Tydfil in 1841, the seventh of eight {{children}} of Daniel and Elizabeth Parry (née Richards). The family was musically inclined, with all family members singing in the chapel choir. Parry's mother, who performed at church functions, was remembered for her fine voice; two of Parry's sisters, Elizabeth and Jane, and a brother, Henry, gained some prominence in the United States as vocalists. He left school at age nine to work <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mines</b> as the family needed the income. Young Parry worked a 56-hour week for twelve and a half pence while at the mine. By age 12, Parry {{was working at the}} puddling furnaces of the Cyfarthfa Ironworks, where his father also worked.|$|E

5|$|Rejecting his mother's {{proposal}} of sending him {{to study in}} Spain at the University of Salamanca and Alcalá de Henares, alongside his cousin Manuel Belgrano, he enrolled in jurisprudence studies in the University of Chuquisaca, in the Upper Peru (modern Bolivia). There, he learned about the ongoing French Revolution, and the new ideas of the Age of Enlightenment. He also learned about the 1782 Rebellion of Túpac Amaru II and the oppression of the indigenous peoples, which influenced his actions in his future Upper Peru campaign. Before returning to Buenos Aires, he visited Potosí and witnessed the use of slave labor <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mines.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Mérens {{has long}} {{been used as a}} {{delivery}} and courier horse, as well as being used by local farmers. It has also been used by the winemakers of Languedoc, gardeners and dock workers, as well as continuing to be used by French armies, who appreciated its endurance. The breed was used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mines,</b> both under saddle and in harness. It was used by smugglers moving goods through the mountains between France and Spain, mainly carrying wood and minerals, and was known for its endurance and sense of direction.|$|E
5|$|The {{industrial}} {{development of the}} Gier valley had its negative aspects. An 1884 writer described the region of Échalas and Saint-Romain-en-Gier, where the country was furrowed by the river, the canal, the railway and the national road. He described the people as the most miserable in the canton of Givors. He said that everything showed this misery: agriculture, roads, houses, church. Work <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mines</b> was the only choice for the poor villagers. An 1885 travel guide mentions the station of Givors-canal on the railway south from Lyon, where the Nîmes line separated from the line to Saint Etienne. The canal then was mainly used by coal barges. The route from Givors-Canal to St. Etienne passed coal mines, large smelting works and iron foundries.|$|E
40|$|AbstractFor a long time, the {{development}} and utilization of coal resources has made important contribution to {{the development}} of China's national economy. However, at the same time, it has damaged environment <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mining</b> area seriously. Therefore, developing circular economy <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mining</b> area promotes <b>the</b> regional sustainable development. In this paper, according to entropy flow generated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> process of exploiting coal resources, the authors advise to introduce the related industries which consume the entropy flow and realize entropy reduction <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mining</b> area. By reviewing and analyzing the development of circular economy in Pingdingshan Coal Mining Group as an example, the authors conclude that development of circular economy and the introduction of negative entropy flow could promote the balance of the ecosystem and increase order <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mining</b> area...|$|R

5|$|Work {{performed}} by slaves falls into five general categories: domestic, with epitaphs recording at least 55 different household jobs; imperial or public service; urban crafts and services; agriculture; and mining. Convicts provided {{much of the}} labour <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mines</b> or quarries, where conditions were notoriously brutal. In practice, there was little division of labour between slave and free, and most workers were illiterate and without special skills. The greatest number of common labourers were employed in agriculture: in the Italian system of industrial farming (latifundia), these may have been mostly slaves, but throughout the Empire, slave farm labour was probably less important than other forms of dependent labour by people who were technically not enslaved.|$|E
5|$|After {{shooting}} Liniers, Castelli returned {{briefly to}} Buenos Aires and met Moreno. The secretary of war congratulated {{him for his}} conduct, and appointed him as a member representing the Junta, with full power to direct the operations to La Paz. He also left a series of instructions: Castelli was to put {{the government in the}} hands of patriots, earn the native's support, and shoot president Nieto, governor Sanz, and the Bishop of La Paz, in the case of their capture. He received similar orders to capture and execute José Manuel de Goyeneche, who had already defeated the rebels of La Paz revolution (a rebellion similar to the May Revolution, which took place at La Paz, modern Bolivia). Castelli was also instructed to rescue and draft to the Auxiliary Army the Arribeños and Patricians soldiers that, under the command of Vicente Nieto, had left Buenos Aires in 1809 to suppress revolutions in Chuquisaca and La Paz. Suspicious of those soldiers, Nieto had them disarmed and sent as prisoners to the mines of Potosi, under the supervision of Francisco de Paula Sanz. More {{than a third of the}} soldiers died within a month of work <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mines.</b>|$|E
