5000|$|In the beginning, Opal {{was only}} {{supposed}} {{to remain on}} All My Children for about six weeks but, when the show's executives saw Dorothy Lyman's electric portrayal of the character, the writers kept her on and wrote for her more and more. [...] I have a true collaboration with Agnes Nixon(AMC's creator). ... The writers write for me, {{but a lot of}} Opal's impulses come from me. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>people</b> like about Opal is that they don't know what to expect from her.

5000|$|The song is one {{of three}} tracks on Pet Sounds where Brian is the only Beach Boy performing. On the line [...] "Listen to my heart...beat", Brian stated: [...] "I felt very deeply about that line. One of the sweetest songs I ever sang. I have to say I'm proud of it. The innocence of youth in my voice, of being young and childlike. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that's <b>what</b> <b>people</b> liked." ...|$|R
5000|$|This {{album to}} me is more {{creative}} and more versatile than my last album. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that's <b>what</b> <b>people</b> have been looking for. My whole image, to me, the reason why I came out with 'Hard Core,' the sexy thing, was to make me different from every other female rapper that was out. That's exactly what I'm trying to do now, is make myself different, because {{now we have a}} lot of rappers doing the same thing that I did when I came out the first time. What I'm trying to do is separate myself again from the rappers that are out now.—Lil' Kim, MTV News ...|$|R
5000|$|Mathers then {{played the}} song to Teresa LaBarbera Whites, an A&R {{executive}} at the publishing company BMG Rights Management {{who was the}} one that signed Beyoncé and her girl group Destiny's Child to the record label Columbia Records {{at the beginning of their}} careers. When she told Mathers that she was collecting songs for Beyoncé's upcoming sixth studio album, Mathers presented his audio of [...] "Sandcastles". During an interview with Los Angeles Times, Berry recalled the moment the song was played to LaBarbera, [...] "Midian was like he's gonna kill me and he didn't give permission but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> this is the kind of song Beyonce needs to sing. And when she played it Teresa started to cry. I did this song to heal myself and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that's <b>what</b> <b>people</b> are experiencing when they hear it." ...|$|R
5000|$|In October 2012, Roth {{revealed}} he {{had been}} listening to [...] "a lot of Paul Simon and R. Kelly", {{and because of this}} his new release will offer up a different sound than his previous work: [...] "We're carving out a sound, man. The thing about my music is I listen to a whole bunch of different music and I'm a firm believer in progression, whether it be expanding your palate for food or your taste in music. So you'll find all types of influences in there like it's up and down, it's active but it's really sad, there's blues influence, alternative-rock influences and pop influences. It's very accessible and fun. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that's <b>what</b> <b>people</b> can always expect from my music, that it's gonna be fun. It's new, it's different and it's fun. I'm sick of listening to music right now that's the same Isht over and over again. I'm excited to be putting out something that's accessible and it's not so left-field you can't even enjoy it, like, 'Oh, you're such an artist.' We're just making some really fun music." ...|$|R
5000|$|The Runners {{first met}} as {{toddlers}} in Vero Beach, Florida. Their fathers were both physicians {{and their families}} soon became fast friends. Dru and Mayne, both grew up with an interest for music. When Dru's family moved to North Carolina during his teen years, he and Mayne they lost touch with each other but both continued their musical interests separately. When they reunited through telephone, Dru and Mayne discovered they'd each been working with DJing and production. In 2000, They name themselves The Runners and {{set up shop in}} Orlando, where they launched Trac-N-Field Entertainment. In 2008, The Runners were nominated for Producer of the Year at the BET Awards. The Runners want to serve as the new Miami sound machine for an entire region. The Runners have been instrumental in the crafting the new hip-hop soundtrack of the 305. [...] "Were trying to give Miami that sound that Dre gave California, or certain producers gave Atlanta. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> thats <b>what</b> <b>people</b> are hearing in our records now", says Dru.|$|R
2500|$|Growing up, Kripke {{connected}} to television shows that had signature cars, such as The Dukes of Hazzard and Knight Rider. This {{prompted him to}} include one in Supernatural. [...] "We say it's a modern American Western— two gunslingers who ride into town, fight the bad guys, kiss the girl and ride out into the sunset again. And we were always talking {{from the very beginning}} that if you're going to have cowboys, they need a trusty horse." [...] He originally intended for the car to be a '65 Mustang, but his neighbor convinced him to change it to a '67 Impala, since [...] "you can put a body in the trunk" [...] and because [...] "you want a car that, when people stop next to it at the lights, they lock their doors." [...] Kripke has commented, [...] "It's a Rottweiler of a car, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it adds authenticity for fans of automobiles because of that, because it's not a pretty ride. It's an aggressive, muscular car, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that's <b>what</b> <b>people</b> respond to, and why it fits so well into the tone of our show." ...|$|R
500|$|... "Good Enough" [...] {{was written}} by Amy Lee for her long-time friend and husband, Josh Hartzler. It was {{produced}} by Dave Fortman and recorded in Record Plant Studios, Los Angeles. The single was scheduled for release in Germany in a basic and premium format on December 14, 2007, but a release date was never officially announced. While discussing Evanescences then upcoming album, The Open Door, Lee revealed {{that one of the}} tracks would be called [...] "Good Enough". She said, [...] "It's called 'Good Enough,' and it's completely, completely, completely different for me because it sort of [...] happy ending. It's the last song that I wrote for the record, and it's sort of the bravest, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> for me because I had to tell the truth and the truth is, I feel, good now. The rest of the album is pretty aggressive and dark and everything else, but the last one is like, I got to the good place that I was heading for and I wrote about how good I felt. It turned out amazing, but it's like nothing we've ever done. I just have to write from my heart and be genuine, because <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that's <b>what</b> <b>people</b> loved about our music to begin with, and if that changes, then that changes." ...|$|R
500|$|All four episodes were {{directed}} by Lee Salisbury, who learned {{three weeks before}} filming {{that he would be}} working on the episodes, and said he was [...] "a bit dumbstruck" [...] to discover he would be directing the fire episodes and Windsor's departure, but that he was proud to do so. He said his main aim for the fire was to show the fear, panic and pandemonium that comes when a fire starts and quickly spreads. He wanted the story to be character-led rather than led by the fire, saying that the fire [...] "almost becomes a backdrop". Salisbury said it was hard to make the fire look real because [...] "you can't actually set fire to stuff". As the fire lasted for some time, characters' scenes could be divided up into small sections. Salisbury commented: [...] "Bryan Kirkwood, the writer [...] and myself also wanted it to be an episode where things kept happening and the audience would keep thinking, 'Wow, that must have been the explosion' or 'That must have been the stunt'. But more things keep happening and happening, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that's <b>what</b> <b>people</b> will find really shocking." [...] The production team had several production meetings for the weeks' worth of episodes, whereas there is usually just one.|$|R
5000|$|February 22: The Elmira Professional Firefighters Union {{issued a}} press release {{in support of the}} City's decision. The {{original}} offer asked the city for $750,000 to repair the ice plant. Then the offer changed to include an additional $700,000 for accounts payable, or back bills. Once the city denied that offer the IDA came back with the original offer of $750,000. But Elmira City Manager Michael Collins said the city still couldn't swing it, even though payments wouldn't start for several years. [...] "We have a projection a five-year projection and if we looked at that we still {{are not going to have}} that surplus to offset that cost," [...] Collins said. [...] "You know unfortunately if you don't have the money you don't have the money and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that that's <b>what</b> <b>people</b> need to realize and understand we just don't have the money." ...|$|R
5000|$|The tomb of Queen Hatshepsut was {{discovered}} by Howard Carter early in 1903, {{the same year as}} the publication of The Jewel of Seven Stars, in the Valley of the Kings—similar to the Valley of the Sorcerer, where Tera is found in the novel. The similarities between the two, Hebblethwaite states, are [...] "almost too overt to be mere coincidence"; both are extremely powerful female rulers who take on the role of men. Just as Hatshepsut commanded and transfigured her masculine image, it is found in Tera’s tomb that [...] "prominence was given to the fact that she, though a Queen, claimed all the privileges of kingship and masculinity. In one place she was pictured in man’s dress, and wearing the White and Red Crowns. In the following picture she was in female dress, but still wearing the Crowns of Upper and Lower Egypt, while the discarded male raiment lay at her feet". Both Tera and Hatshepsut also seemed to possess some awareness that their legacy would be destroyed. In the novel, Tera leaves an inscription stating her plans for resurrection, as well as that [...] "the hatred of the priests was, she knew, stored up for her, and that they would after her death try to suppress her name". A similar inscription was found on an obelisk at Hatshepsut’s memorial: [...] "Now my heart turns this way and that, as <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> the <b>people</b> will say—those who shall see my monuments in years to come, and who shall speak of what I have done".|$|R
40|$|This is {{an essay}} about the {{corrective}} aspiration {{of the law}} of racial discrimination—the commitment, expressed again and again in the case law, to eliminate the effects of past discrimination. This aspiration is most obviously reflected in remedies that courts order once specific violations of the Constitution or antidiscrimination statutes are shown. In broader form, it is also reflected in measures such as affirmative action that other institutions undertake to overcome more pervasive discrimination. Understanding what this corrective aspiration really means, and struggling with the transitional conflicts of moving from an unjust situation to a more just one, have been the distinctive civil rights challenges for this generation of lawyers and judges. In antidiscrimination law, the basic concept of the wrong to be corrected is defined by the 2 ̆ 2 antidiscrimination principle 2 ̆ 2 as the racially-based disadvantaging of blacks. The harms that are wrongful are those resulting from so-called 2 ̆ 2 purposeful discrimination 2 ̆ 2 —that is, racially prejudiced goals or attitudes—not discrimination defined in some other posssible way. While some have questioned whether it is appropriate to focus especially on harms caused by purposeful discrimination, and would focus instead on black 2 ̆ 2 disadvantage 2 ̆ 2 without linking it to purposeful discrimination, this notion of the harm to be eliminated corresponds, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> to <b>what</b> most <b>people</b> believe are the distinctively terrible wrongs that blacks have suffered: not simply that they have wound up in an inferior position, but that they were deliberately subordinated and remain so today largely because of the effects of purposeful discrimination extending throughout American society over many years. The distinctive moral force of the corrective approach is that it builds upon the strong moral claim that purposeful discrimination is a wrong whose effects should be eradicated...|$|R
