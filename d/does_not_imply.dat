5|$|Non-reductive Physicalism is {{the view}} that mental {{properties}} form a separate ontological class to physical properties: mental states (such as qualia) are not reducible to physical states. The ontological stance towards qualia {{in the case of}} non-reductive physicalism <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>imply</b> that qualia are causally inert; this is what distinguishes it from epiphenomenalism.|$|E
5|$|Radial {{cleavage}} in {{the earliest}} divisions of the egg {{appears to be the}} original condition for the ancestral bilaterians, {{in the earliest}} Ecdysozoa and possibly in the earliest Eutrochozoa, a major sub-group of the Lophotrochozoa.

5|$|The substem {{preceding}} {{the source of}} the antibody refers to the medicine's target. Examples of targets are tumors, organ systems like the circulatory system, or infectious agents like bacteria or viruses. The term target <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>imply</b> what sort of action the antibody exerts. Therapeutic, prophylactic and diagnostic agents are not distinguished by this nomenclature.|$|E

5|$|ASL is {{sometimes}} incorrectly {{cited as the}} third- or fourth-most-spoken language in the United States. These figures misquote Schein and Delk (1974), who actually concluded that ASL speakers constituted the third-largest population requiring an interpreter in court. Although this would make ASL the third-most used language among monolinguals other than English, it <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>imply</b> {{that it is the}} fourth-most-spoken language in the United States, since speakers of other languages may also speak English.|$|E
5|$|If gcd(a,b)=1, then a and b {{are said}} to be coprime (or {{relatively}} prime). This property <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>imply</b> that a or b are themselves prime numbers. For example, neither 6 nor 35 is a prime number, since they both have two prime factors: 6=2×3 and 35=5×7. Nevertheless, 6 and 35 are coprime. No natural number other than 1 divides both 6 and 35, since they have no prime factors in common.|$|E

5|$|Jevons {{warned that}} fuel {{efficiency}} gains tend to increase fuel use. But this <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>imply</b> that improved fuel efficiency is worthless: higher fuel efficiency enables greater production {{and a higher}} material quality of life. For example, a more efficient steam engine allowed the cheaper transport of goods and people {{that contributed to the}} Industrial Revolution. However, if the Khazzoom–Brookes postulate is correct, increased fuel efficiency, by itself, will not reduce the rate of depletion of fossil fuels.|$|E
5|$|Shaktism's {{focus on}} the Divine Feminine <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>imply</b> a {{rejection}} of masculine. It rejects male-female, soul-body, transcendent-immanent dualism, considering nature as divine. Devi {{is considered to be}} the cosmos itself – she is the embodiment of energy, matter and soul, the motivating force behind all action and existence in the material universe. Yet in Shaktism, states C. MacKenzie Brown, the masculine and the feminine are aspects of the divine, transcendent reality. In Hindu iconography, the cosmic dynamic of masculine-feminine interdependence and equivalence, is expressed in the half-Shakti, half-Shiva deity known as Ardhanari.|$|E

5|$|Verified status <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>imply</b> that Twitter {{continuously}} checks {{whether such}} accounts have been hacked. The account of Tesla Motors, for example, was impersonated briefly in 2015.

Twitter referred to this as a breach of their rules and introduced a design update to make this more difficult. In July 2016, Twitter began allowing anyone {{to apply for a}} verified account.

5|$|For {{clarity of}} presentation, the {{diagrams}} {{in this article}} are drawn with the components implemented in stripline format. This <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>imply</b> an industry preference, although planar transmission line formats (that is, formats where conductors consist of flat strips) are popular because they can be implemented using established printed circuit board manufacturing techniques. The structures shown can also be implemented using microstrip or buried stripline techniques (with suitable adjustments to dimensions) and can be adapted to coaxial cables, twin leads and waveguides, although some structures are more suitable for some implementations than others. The open wire implementations, for instance, of a number of structures are shown in the second column of figure 3 and open wire equivalents can be found for most other stripline structures. Planar transmission lines are also used in integrated circuit designs.|$|E
5|$|It is {{important}} not to over-interpret these diagrams. Nothing is implied about how a particle gets from one point to another. The diagrams do not imply that the particles are moving in straight or curved lines. They do not imply that the particles are moving with constant speeds. The fact that the photon is often represented, by convention, by a wavy line and not a straight one <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>imply</b> that it is thought that it is more wavelike than is an electron. The images are just symbols to represent the actions above: photons and electrons do, somehow, move from point to point and electrons, somehow, emit and absorb photons. The theory does not explain how these things happen, but it does tell us the probabilities of these things happening in various situations.|$|E

5|$|The Langenberg Quarry, where K. langenbergensis {{is known}} from, {{is part of}} the Lower Saxony Basin, which would {{have been part of the}} landmass {{associated}} with the Rhenisch, Bohemian, and London-Brabant Massifs. During the Kimmeridgian, it would have been a shallow marine environment; however, this <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>imply</b> that K. langenbergensis was marine, since the animals and plants of the Langenberg Quarry were probably transported allochthonously (albeit only by a short distance) from the surrounding islands. Brackish and freshwater sediments are also present in the quarry, which implies that there was occasional freshwater influx. Twigs and conifer cones indicate that the araucarian Brachyphyllum was present at the site.|$|E
5|$|While Article 34 of the {{constitution}} of Luxembourg formerly required the grand duke or duchess to sanction and promulgate a new law for it to take effect, the required sanction was removed in 2008, after Grand Duke Henri informed his prime minister {{that he could not}} in good conscience assent to a bill to permit euthanasia in the country. The subsequent constitutional amendment removed the need for assent while retaining the need for the Grand Duke to promulgate new laws. The Grand-Duke's signature is still required, but <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>imply</b> assent, only promulgation (announcement that the law has been enacted by Parliament). The Grand-Duke did sign the Euthanasia Act under this new constitutional arrangement.|$|E
5|$|The {{inscription}} goes on {{to describe}} Cyrus returning to their original sanctuaries the statues of the gods that Nabonidus had brought to the city before the Persian invasion. This restored the normal cultic order {{to the satisfaction of}} the priesthood. It alludes to temples being restored and deported groups being returned to their homelands but <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>imply</b> an empire-wide programme of restoration. Instead, it refers to specific areas in the border region between Babylonia and Persia, including sites that had been devastated by earlier Babylonian military campaigns. The Cylinder indicates that Cyrus sought to acquire the loyalty of the ravaged regions by funding reconstruction, the return of temple properties and the repatriation of the displaced populations. However, it is unclear how much actually changed on the ground; there is no archaeological evidence for any rebuilding or repairing of Mesopotamian temples during Cyrus's reign.|$|E

5|$|There is a {{distinction}} between a redshift in cosmological context as compared to that witnessed when nearby objects exhibit a local Doppler-effect redshift. Rather than cosmological redshifts being {{a consequence of the}} relative velocities that are subject to the laws of special relativity (and thus subject to the rule that no two locally separated objects can have relative velocities with respect to each other faster than the speed of light), the photons instead increase in wavelength and redshift because of a global feature of the spacetime metric through which they are traveling. One interpretation of this effect is the idea that space itself is expanding. Due to the expansion increasing as distances increase, the distance between two remote galaxies can increase at more than 3 m/s, but this <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>imply</b> that the galaxies move faster than the speed of light at their present location (which is forbidden by Lorentz covariance).|$|E
5|$|Henri Christophe's {{widow and}} {{children}} are taken to Europe by English merchants, who used to supply the royal family. Solimán accompanies them and enjoys the summers in Rome, where he is treated well and tells embellished tales of his past. He encounters a statue of Pauline whose form brings back memories, and sends him into a howl, causing the room to be rushed. He is reminded of the night of Henri Christophe's demise and flees before succumbing to malaria. Ti Noel recalls things told by Macandal, and the former plantation of Lenormand de Mezy has become a happy place, with Ti Noel presiding over celebrations and festivities. Surveyors disrupt the peace at the plantation, and mulattoes have risen to power; they force hundreds of black prisoners to work by whiplash, and many have lost hope as the cycle of slavery continues. Ti Noel, thinking of Macandal, decides to transform into various animals to observe the ongoing events; he metamorphoses into a bird, a stallion, a wasp, and then an ant. He eventually becomes a goose, but is rejected by the clan of geese. He understands that being a goose <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>imply</b> that all geese are equal, so he returns to human form. The book concludes {{with the end of}} Ti Noel's life, and his own self-reflection upon greatness and The Kingdom of This World.|$|E
