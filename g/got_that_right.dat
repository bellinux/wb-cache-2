500|$|Being a [...] "50–50 co-production" [...] {{between the}} British and French, the crew were a mix from both countries, and neither party has [...] "final control". The series {{employed}} both British and French writers and directors to collaborate on the series, with former Spooks writer Ben Richards leading the writing team. Multiple {{versions of the}} script were used, which were translated for both languages. Five directors were hired for the series, three of them British {{and the other two}} French. Dominik Moll is considered the head director, with the other directors being Hettie MacDonald, Thomas Vincent, Udayan Prasad and Philip Martin. The series' executive producers are Sky's Anne Mensah; Canal+'s Fabrice De La Patellière; Kudos' Jane Featherstone, Karen Wilson, Manda Levin and Ben Richards; Shine France's Nora Melhli; and Filmlance's Lars Blomgren. Ruth Kenley-Letts is the series producer. Jane Featherstone, {{the chief executive of the}} production company Kudos, said of the British–French collaboration: [...] "We have had to work very collaboratively to make sure we are appealing to both nations. I honestly don't know if we have <b>got</b> <b>that</b> <b>right</b> yet. The French like things to be slightly slower, we like them pacier." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{unit has}} been for the most part impenitent. In the first week of February, its Gauteng {{regional}} boss, Commander Sean Tshabalala, bemoaned the public's lack of respect. [...] "You've <b>got</b> <b>that</b> one <b>right,</b> comrade commander," [...] retorted columnist Max du Preez.

I <b>got</b> <b>that</b> <b>right</b> from a fellow that's met him." ...|$|E
6000|$|I couldn't {{wait any}} longer, and so I asked him his name. He stopped rowing and leaned on his oars {{and let the}} boat drift. [...] "Now," [...] said he, [...] "if you've got {{a piece of paper}} and a pencil I wish you would listen careful and put down my name, and if you ever know of any other people in your country coming to the River Wye, I wish you would tell them my name, and say I am a boatman, and can take them down the river better than anybody else that's on it. My name is Samivel Jones. Be sure you've <b>got</b> <b>that</b> <b>right,</b> please--Samivel Jones. I was born on this river, and I rowed on it with my father when I was a boy, and I have rowed on it ever since, and now I am sixty-five years old. Do you want to know why this river is called the Wye? I will tell you. Wye means crooked, so this river is called the Wye because it is crooked. Wye, the crooked river." ...|$|E
5000|$|The office's {{accompanying}} {{budget increase}} was removed {{toward the end}} of the 113th Congress, shortly before Patrick Leahy was to become the first holder of the title in six years. Quoted in CQ Roll Call, Leahy commented, [...] "They didn't keep their commitment. They want to treat us differently than we treated them, and so they've <b>got</b> <b>that</b> <b>right.</b> It seems kind of petty, but it really doesn't matter to me.

5000|$|... 'We {{spent the}} last six or seven months in heavy R&D, in lab coats, {{figuring}} out how to create a control system that felt right,' Harris says. 'You've heard us dump on virtual joysticks and other things that have been ported over from console gaming to touch, and we've eschewed that completely. Once we <b>got</b> <b>that</b> <b>right,</b> we saw a whole bunch of cascading effects of that control scheme, into every aspect of the game: from the way we build encounters and levels, to the way we create our guns and bad guys. So the control scheme will be a big thing.'" ...|$|E
50|$|Kitna {{would again}} get intercepted {{on the first}} {{possession}} of the second half, this time by Jonathan Vilma. But the drive went nowhere, and Detroit's next one, a 12-play, 83-yard drive, resulted in a 25-yard field goal by Jason Hanson. The Jets <b>got</b> <b>that</b> <b>right</b> back, as Pennington converted a couple of third downs during a drive that was capped by Mike Nugent's 33-yard field goal. Down fourteen points, Detroit halved New York's lead with Kitna finding Kevin Jones on a 9-yard touchdown pass on a drive where Kitna converted a critical 4th-and-11 pass to Mike Furrey. The Jets would come right back, with Washington scoring on a 16-yard touchdown run on a sweep around end. Detroit would not give up, as Kitna found Furrey on an 18-yard touchdown pass on a play that survived a Jets challenge. On that drive, Kitna again converted a fourth down to Furrey. But Detroit's ensuing onside kick failed, and the Jets ran out the clock.|$|E

5000|$|Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian was {{slightly}} less convinced, giving it two stars, stating that [...] "it’s hard {{to escape the}} sinking feeling {{that this is a}} waste of talent - that this is a good-natured, well-meaning but pointless kind of Brit-comedy ancestor worship; paying elaborate homage to a TV show <b>that</b> <b>got</b> it <b>right</b> the first time." ...|$|R

In 1514, it was occupied by György Dózsa's army and then in 1661, it was also occupied by the Ottoman army. As a condition of the peace treaty of Vasvár, the town's castle was destroyed in 1665. From 1691 {{it was part of}} the Habsburg Monarchy up until the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867. Thereafter it became part of the Kingdom of Hungary within Austria-Hungary.|$|R
5000|$|Ross and Pohlad {{worked on}} the score for about half a year. Pohlad explained: [...] "Brian hears these amazing orchestrations and harmonies and {{arrangements}} in his head that are so complex, nobody else can understand them until he actually executes them. They're these amazingly, you know, layered things. The problem is he hears {{them all the time}} and he can't turn them off necessarily. That ocean of kind of being the genius as well as the madness really intrigued me. ... I really {{wanted to be able to}} try to get to that and to try to represent that in some way." [...] He did not want to incorporate a conventional score that was a fan's [...] "tribute" [...] to Wilson: [...] "Atticus <b>got</b> <b>that</b> <b>right</b> away. You're not going to try to compete with Brian Wilson. So he had the idea — because we had access to all of Brian's original music and the original tapes and stems and tracks from these recordings. So we started talking about rearranging those. He would take them and combine them in different ways and we'd mix them and things to create new music that essentially was Brian's music." [...] Pohlad said that it was [...] "Revolution 9" [...] (1968) from the Beatles' White Album which inspired this approach. Ross also took inspiration from the Beatles and Jay-Z mashup album The Grey Album (2004).|$|E

[...] The episode received a 1.8 rating and was watched by a total of 3.97 million people. This made it the fourth most watched show on Animation Domination that night, beating The Cleveland Show but losing to The Simpsons with 4.38 million.|$|R

[...] "Why, Pat could take me across his knee just as he did the youngster who mistook him for a deer and put a bullet through his hat last fall. I've never seen anybody take to an idea as Pat did to scouting. He just soaked it up.

Wait a bit! Take the light into the bedroom, and get a chair for yourself--we haven't much accommodation for evening visitors. <b>Got</b> it? <b>that's</b> <b>right.</b> Would {{you like to see}} where the mad watchman hung himself? On the last hook {{at the end of the}} row there. We've got a song he made about the Deadhouse. I think it's in the drawer of the table. A gentleman had it printed and sold, for the benefit of the widow and children. Wait till we are well warmed with our liquor, and I'll tell you what I'll do--I'll sing you the mad watchman's song; and Jacky, my man, you shall sing the chorus! Tow-row-rub-a-dub-boom--that's the tune. Pretty, isn't it? Come along back to our snuggery." [...] He led the way to the Watchman's Chamber.|$|R

[...] Baker named Ronnie Bond of the Troggs as his main drumming influence. He then drummed for Black Sun (1973-74), which played original material. He followed with the Slick City Boys (1974-75). In 1976 he travelled to the United States and then England, where he saw early live performances by the Ramones, Flamin' Groovies, the Dictators and Johnny Thunders. Baker described a chance encounter: [...] "I met Sid Vicious on a bus in London in September 76. My first day in London. I had a New York Dolls t-shirt on and he came up and {{sat next to me}} and said how much he liked the New York Dolls. I told him I'd just seen Johnny Thunders in New York and he told me Johnny Thunders was apparently thinking of coming to England. Which he did. So he <b>got</b> <b>that</b> one <b>right.</b> He introduced himself as John Richie, which was his name not Sid Vicious." [...] - James Baker Baker considered auditioning for the Clash: [...] "I met Joe Strummer and Mick Jones at a pub after a Damned gig. I had a Ramones t-shirt on and they {{came up to me and}} talked to me about that. They said they needed a drummer. But I hadn't played for a year so." [...] - James Baker ...|$|R

5000|$|On May 29, he was {{involved}} in a controversial game-ending play at home plate in the ninth inning in a game against the Kansas City Royals. Napoli was at first and Elvis Andrus was up against Joakim Soria. Andrus hit a shot past Eric Hosmer <b>that</b> <b>got</b> into <b>right</b> field. Napoli was sent home by the third-base coach. Hosmer threw the ball to the plate. Brayan Pena tagged Napoli on the upper shoulder, but Napoli was called safe by the home-plate umpire, giving the Rangers a walk-off win. Pena was enraged and arguing with the umpires with manager Ned Yost. Replays showed that Pena did not block the plate, but tagged Napoli, who got his feet in just before the tag. In his first season with the Rangers he batted [...]320 with 30 home runs (10th in the American League) and 75 RBIs, while improving his defense (throwing out 36% of base-stealers; 4th-best in the league).
