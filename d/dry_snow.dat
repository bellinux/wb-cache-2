2500|$|In {{most of the}} Arctic the {{significant}} snow melt begins in late May or sometime in June. [...] This begins a feedback, as melting snow reflects less solar radiation (50% to 60%) than <b>dry</b> <b>snow,</b> allowing more energy to be absorbed and the melting to take place faster. [...] As the snow disappears on land, the underlying surfaces absorb even more energy, and begin to warm rapidly.|$|E
2500|$|Dry cold – From [...] Dry cold {{conditions}} {{are easier to}} live in than wet {{cold conditions}}. Like in wet cold conditions, proper equipment, training and leadership are critical to successful operations. Wind chill is a complicating factor {{in this type of}} cold. The dry cold environment is the easiest of the four cold weather categories to survive in because of low humidity and the ground remains frozen. As a result, people and equipment are not subject to the effects of the thawing and freezing cycle, and precipitation is generally in the form of <b>dry</b> <b>snow.</b>|$|E
50|$|The 1981-82 ski season saw Telluride’s first snowmaking {{system which}} {{included}} two miles of {{welded steel pipe}} buried three feet underground. The winter before, Colorado experienced one of the <b>driest</b> <b>snow</b> seasons on record. 1981 also was the inaugural year of Telluride Women’s Week. It is currently the longest running women’s focused program in the country.|$|R

60|$|Step by step, {{each time}} {{breaking}} through the thin skin of ice concealed under the <b>dry</b> <b>snow,</b> she forced her way to solid footing. Smoke did not wait, but sprang to the bank, where dry and seasoned twigs and sticks, lodged amongst the brush by spring freshets, waited the match. By the time she reached his side, the first flames and flickers of an assured fire were rising.|$|E
60|$|It was {{a bitter}} evening. The {{snow on the}} crests of the rises glittered like steel; the hollows were sharply picked out in blue. The frost was pitiless, and a strong breeze whipped up clouds of <b>dry</b> <b>snow</b> and drove them in swirls across the plain. A half moon, harshly bright, hung low above the western horizon, and the vast stretch of sky that domed in the prairie was {{sprinkled}} with stars.|$|E
50|$|Brentwood has a humid {{subtropical}} climate (Köppen Cfa) with hot, humid summers and mild to cool winters. Precipitation occurs year round, spring being slightly wetter and fall, slightly <b>drier.</b> <b>Snow</b> and ice are an occasional nuisance during winter months, though heavy amounts are less common. Especially during springtime, Brentwood can experience severe weather, sometimes including tornadoes. The community lies within USDA Plant Hardiness Zone 7.|$|R
50|$|Mt Bachelor offers lift {{accessed}} {{skiing and}} snowboarding 9-4 7 {{days a week}} from mid November {{to the end of}} may. On nice weather days Mt Bachelor offers Skiing 360 degrees off the summit of the mountain. Bachelor holds some of the <b>driest</b> <b>snow</b> relative to the Cascade's. The mountains wide variety of elevation and aspect allows skiers and snowboarders to find good snow nearly every day of the season. Many avid skiers and snowboarders can access a buldge {{on the north side of}} the mountain referred to as 'the cone' by hiking before, during and after the resorts typical hours of operation.|$|R

6000|$|At my [...] "hello," [...] a ranch hand {{came from}} an outer {{building}} and received my thankful horse. In another minute, Ross and I sat by a stove in the dining-room of the four-room ranch house, while the big, simple welcome of the household lay at my disposal. Fanned by the whizzing norther, the fine, <b>dry</b> <b>snow</b> was sifted and bolted through the cracks and knotholes of the logs. The cook room, without a separating door, appended.|$|E
60|$|And he told stories, tracing with {{a finger}} in the dust, of the immense and sumptuous ritual of avalanche-guarded cathedrals; of processions and devil-dances; of the {{changing}} of monks and nuns into swine; of holy cities fifteen thousand feet in the air; of intrigue between monastery and monastery; of voices among the hills, and of that mysterious mirage that dances on <b>dry</b> <b>snow.</b> He spoke even of Lhassa and of the Dalai Lama, whom he had seen and adored.|$|E
60|$|The {{opposite}} slope {{was rough}} and steep, and the jumper too wide to pass easily between the trees. They had to lift it, {{and help the}} oxen here and there; but they struggled up and then found that their difficulties were not over {{when they reached the}} open plain. The wind had risen while they were in the hollow and was now blowing the <b>dry</b> <b>snow</b> about. It had grown dark and the trail was faint.|$|E

50|$|The {{avalanche}} is {{a well-known}} problem with large piles of snow and ice crystals on steep slopes. In <b>dry</b> conditions, <b>snow</b> slopes act similarly to sandpiles. An entire mountainside of snow can suddenly slide due {{to the presence of}} a skier, or even a loud noise or vibration.|$|R
60|$|These springs, {{common to}} most Klondike streams, never cease {{at the lowest}} temperatures. The water flows out from the banks and lies in pools which are cuddled from the cold by later surface-freezings and snow falls. Thus, a man, {{stepping}} on <b>dry</b> <b>snow,</b> might break through half an inch of ice-skin and find himself up to the knees in water. In five minutes, unless able to remove the wet gear, the loss of one's foot was the penalty.|$|E
6000|$|... "No!" [...] she shouted. [...] "Mother! mother! stop crying! Don't you see I'm not dead?" [...] She leaped about, {{catching}} up this wrap and that, shaking the <b>dry</b> <b>snow</b> out of them, and flinging {{them back into}} the cutter, while she laughed in the wild tumult of her spirits. Bartley helped her pick up the fragments of the wreck, and joined her in making fun of the adventure. The wind hustled them, but they were warm in defiance of it with their jollity and their bustle.|$|E
60|$|But the fox did {{not turn}} in his direction. Instead he kept {{straight}} on into the swamp as if he intended to cross it to the high land which made up to the hills beyond. Sparrer caught occasional glimpses of him through the trees. He crossed the trail by which Sparrer had come in, sniffed at it, looked up in Sparrer's direction suspiciously, it seemed to him, sniffed again and then trotted on as if the matter were of no present interest. The <b>dry</b> <b>snow</b> had not held the scent sufficiently to cause alarm.|$|E

60|$|There {{seemed to}} be an unnatural stillness everywhere, amid which the {{crunching}} of the <b>dry</b> <b>snow</b> sounded with a distinctness that almost frightened the boy, who was simply going to his uncle Robert's to spend a day or two. But finally Dan was on the main road, where the snow was frozen so hard that his footsteps could not be heard as distinctly, and where the two tracks worn smooth by the runners of the sleighs lay spread out before him, looking like two satin ribbons on white broadcloth.|$|E
60|$|His load, which {{included}} the rifle, was heavy, {{and he had been}} exerting himself since early morning. The wind was in his face, lashing it until the cold became intolerable, the <b>dry</b> <b>snow</b> was loose, and he could not find his outward trail. Still, he was thankful that no more had fallen and thought he knew the quarter he must make for. Now he was in the open, he could see some distance, for the snow threw up a dim light. It stretched away before him, a sweep of glimmering grey, and the squeaking crunch it made beneath his shoes emphasized the silence.|$|E
60|$|The frost {{got more}} rigorous, drying {{the snow to}} a dusty powder in which Festing's lumber gang floundered awkwardly. Had there been a thaw, the surface would have hardened, but now {{they were forced to}} move the logs through loose, billowy drifts. The men sank to their knees, it was {{difficult}} to find a fulcrum for the handspikes, and the logs would not run well on the beaten roads. The latter broke into holes, and the <b>dry</b> <b>snow</b> retarded the smooth sliding of the lumber like dust. One could not touch a saw or ax-head with the naked hand.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we compare}} dry-snow {{extinction}} coefficients derived from radar altimeter data with brightness temperature data from passive microwave measurements over {{a portion of}} the East Antarctic plateau. The comparison between the extinction coefficients and the brightness temperatures shows a strong negative correlation, where the correlation coefficients ranged from - 0. 87 to - 0. 95. The extinction coefficient of the <b>dry</b> polar <b>snow</b> decreases with increasing surface elevation, while the average brightness temperature increases with surface elevation. Our analysis shows that the observed trends are related to geographic variations in scattering coefficient of snow, which in turn are controlled by variations in surface temperature and snow accumulation rate. By combining information present in the extinction coefficient and brightness temperature data sets, we develop a model {{that can be used to}} obtain quantitative estimates of the accumulation rate of <b>dry</b> polar <b>snow...</b>|$|R

60|$|He crawled {{back over}} the huddled dogs, dusted the <b>dry</b> <b>snow</b> from his furs with the {{whalebone}} beater that Amoraq kept by the door, tapped the skin-lined roof {{of the house to}} shake off any icicles that might have fallen from the dome of snow above, and curled up on the bench. The dogs in the passage snored and whined in their sleep, the boy-baby in Amoraq's deep fur hood kicked and choked and gurgled, and the mother of the newly-named puppy lay at Kotuko's side, her eyes fixed on the bundle of sealskin, warm and safe above the broad yellow flame of the lamp.|$|E

[...] "Haven't I good friends in Boston?" [...] By friendship he swayed his world: nor was he completely unknown--though he did not say so--to certain influential members of his race of the Boston police department. Pulling out a large nickel watch and observing that they had just time to catch the train, he locked up his shop, and they set out together for the station. Mr. Tiernan led the way, for the path was narrow. The <b>dry</b> <b>snow</b> squeaked under his feet.|$|E
60|$|Presently after, {{these two}} set forth and descended to the harbour. It was a {{considerable}} basin, lying among sand hills, and surrounded with patches of down, ancient ruinous lumber, and tumble-down slums of the town. Many decked ships and many open boats either lay there at anchor, {{or had been}} drawn up on the beach. A long duration of bad weather had driven them from the high seas into {{the shelter of the}} port; and the great trooping of black clouds, and the cold squalls that followed one another, now with a sprinkling of <b>dry</b> <b>snow,</b> now in a mere swoop of wind, promised no improvement but rather threatened a more serious storm in the immediate future.|$|E
50|$|Snowfall is {{very rare}} as it is {{normally}} too <b>dry</b> to <b>snow</b> when cold air masses reach the Bootheel, so that the median is only 0.4 in per year and the mean just 5.7 in. The most snow in one month was in January 1977 with 13.1 in, whilst the snowiest season was from July 1966 to June 1967 with 19.3 in.|$|R
