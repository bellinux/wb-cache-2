40|$|Although it {{is known}} that many birds possess {{ultraviolet}} (UV) -sensitive vision, most commercially <b>housed</b> <b>poultry</b> species, as well as species held in zoos, laboratories, or bred for show, are maintained under lighting that is deficient in UV wavelengths compared with normal daylight. UV-sensitive vision {{has been shown to be}} important in both foraging and mate-choice decisions. UV-poor conditions, in which information in this waveband is eliminated, could, therefore, present an important welfare issue. Eight European starlings were given a series of preference tests (eight hours per trial, for six days), in which they could choose to feed in one of four channels. Four experimental trials were carried out, during which the channels were covered in either UV-transmitting (UV+) or UV-blocking (UV-) filters, to determine whether birds had an initial preference for feeding in UV-rich environments and whether there was any change in their preference over time. There was an initial preference for the UV+ environment, but this preference declined very rapidly with familiarity, and was absent by the final trial. These results imply that starlings can rapidly adjust their feeding behaviour if faced with unfamiliar light environments and that any initial behavioural changes attributable to UV-deficient environments may be short-lived. However, further work is necessary to establish whether these adjustments occur across a range of species and contexts before any welfare concerns can be ruled out...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Distribution of {{inorganic}} elements {{was measured}} in <b>poultry</b> <b>house</b> dust from five types of <b>poultry</b> <b>houses</b> during either winter, spring, or summer. With varied environmental condi-tions {{at the time of}} sampling, the levels of calcium, sodium, iron, zinc, magnesium, and aluminum were higher than the other elements found in dust samples from the five types of <b>poultry</b> <b>houses.</b> The most abundant element in <b>poultry</b> <b>house</b> dust was calcium. The level of this element in dust samples from the mechanically ventilated house used for research purposes corresponded closely to the level found in the feed fed at sampling time. High zinc levels in layer houses may be attributed to either the abrasive actions of feathers and feet of layers against the galvanized wire cages on the high zinc content in feathers. The ash content of dust from the five types of <b>poultry</b> <b>houses</b> ranged from. 31 to 3. 54 %. Air particulate counts for particles ranging in size from. 5 to 10 jum were much higher in the layer house used for commercial purposes (ranged from 34. 9 to 66. 3 X 106 /m 3) than in the layer houses used for research purposes (ranged from 5. 8 to 9. 8 X 106 /m 3).

40|$|Ammonia {{volatilization}} from poultry litter commonly {{causes a}} buildup of ammonia in the atmosphere of chicken houses that can {{have a negative impact}} on both farm workers and birds. The release of ammonia from <b>poultry</b> <b>houses</b> can also contribute to environmental problems such as atmospheric haze. The most widely accepted management strategy to control ammonia volatilization from <b>poultry</b> <b>houses</b> is the use of litter amendments that are added to the litter. The poultry industry routinely uses dry acids such as aluminum sulfate and sodium bisulfate to reduce ammonia emissions inside the <b>poultry</b> <b>house.</b> Although these products are very effective in controlling ammonia release in <b>poultry</b> <b>houses,</b> they typically only work for about the first three weeks of the grow-out period, after which time litter pH and ammonia levels will begin to rise.

Therefore this research was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of an alternative product for long-term control of ammonia release in <b>poultry</b> <b>houses.</b> This research investigated the efficacy of a single application of superabsorbent polymers to poultry litter for long term in-house ammonia control which could reduce the negative impacts of ammonia on bird health and performance and potentially the environment...|$|R
