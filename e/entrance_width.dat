500|$|The clan's {{social life}} {{revolves}} around a communal den. While some clans may use particular den sites for years, others may use several different dens {{within a year}} or several den sites simultaneously. Spotted hyena dens can have more than a dozen entrances, and are mostly located on flat ground. The tunnels are usually oval in section, being wider than they are high, and narrow down from an <b>entrance</b> <b>width</b> of ½–1 metre (1.6–7.7ft) to as small as [...] In the rocky areas of East Africa and Congo, spotted hyenas use caves as dens, while those in the Serengeti use kopjes as resting areas in daylight hours. Dens have large bare patches around their entrances, where hyenas move or lie down on. Because of their size, adult hyenas are incapable of using the full extent of their burrows, as most tunnels are dug by cubs or smaller animals. The structure of the den, consisting of small underground channels, is likely an effective anti-predator device which protects cubs from predation during the absence of the mother. Spotted hyenas rarely dig their own dens, having been observed for the most part to use the abandoned burrows of warthogs, springhares and jackals. Faeces are usually deposited [...] away from the den, though they urinate wherever they happen to be. Dens are used mostly by several females at once, and {{it is not uncommon to}} see up to 20 cubs at a single site. The general form of a spotted hyena den is tunnel-shaped, with a spacious end chamber used for sleeping or breeding. This chamber measures up to [...] in width, the height being rather less. Females generally give birth at the communal den or a private birth den. The latter is primarily used by low status females in order to maintain continual access to their cubs, as well as ensure that they become acquainted with their cubs before transferral to the communal den.|$|E

40|$|In the Netherlands a large variety {{exists in}} the used widths of inland port entrances. In addition, {{multiple}} entrance layouts are applied. Currently, guidelines are missing {{for the design of}} inland port entrances along flowing waters with flow velocities larger than 0. 5 m/s. A more generic insight into the minimum required nautical safe <b>entrance</b> <b>width</b> and most efficient entrance layout can reduce the design costs and time. The objective of this research was to find the minimum required nautical safe <b>entrance</b> <b>width</b> for generic situations for inland ports along flowing waters in non-tidal areas. To find this minimum safe <b>entrance</b> <b>width,</b> the most efficient entrance layout was determined. The influence of different design parameters was studied to provide the most efficient situation. Moreover, an insight into the influence of these parameters was needed to determine the effect on the most efficient situation when changing these parameters. A fast-time simulation study was chosen to analyse the influence of different design parameters on the <b>entrance</b> <b>width.</b> A rectangular entrance layout and a mathematical ship model comparable with a loaded CEMT class Va ship were used. Flow velocities between 1. 0 and 2. 5 m/s were taken into account. Moreover, the influence of the waterway width, <b>entrance</b> <b>width,</b> length and angle were analysed with the simulation study. The fast-time simulation program SHIPMA was used to perform the simulation study. As a result of the simulation study, {{it was found that the}} most efficient entrance angle is 120 degrees. Note that this is an entrance orientation in downstream direction. Also from a viewpoint of minimising siltation, this angle is more favourable than an angle of 90 degrees or smaller. The required entrance widths for arrivals sailing upstream and manoeuvring forward into the port are circa 55 and 80 meters, for flow velocities of respectively 1. 0 and 2. 5 m/s. For the determined most efficient layout, the forward manoeuvres into the port when sailing downstream were replaced by backward manoeuvres. For these backward manoeuvres the required entrance widths are circa 70 and 90 meters, for flow velocities of respectively 1. 0 and 2. 0 m/s. A linear relation was observed between the flow velocity and the required <b>entrance</b> <b>width.</b> For the most efficient entrance layout, it was found that the sensitivity of the entrance length, width and angle was small. These results are only valid for an available waterway width larger than 90 meters. For smaller waterway widths additional research is required. Furthermore, it should be mentioned that the limitations of the SHIPMA model also apply for the acquired research results. The most important limitation is that human interference was not included in this research. Besides, only a limited amount of design parameters was included in the simulation study.

In calculating the entrance widths the electron screening and various orbital moments of the incident tp. -atom were taken into account.

40|$|The {{relative}} importance of environment and dispersal related processes for community assembly has attracted great interest over recent decades, but few empirical studies from the marine/estuarine realm have examined the possible effects of {{these two types of}} factors in the same system. Importance of these processes was investigated in a hypothetical metacommunity of benthic invertebrates in 16 micro-tidal estuaries connected to the same open sea area. The estuaries differed in size and connectivity to the open sea and represented a salinity gradient across the estuaries. The Elements of Metacommunity Structure (EMS) approach on estuary scale was complemented with a mechanistic variance partitioning approach on sample scale to disentangle effects of factors affecting assembly of three trait groups of species with different dispersivity. A quasi-Clementsian pattern was observed for all three traits, a likely response to some latent gradient. The primary axis in the pattern was most strongly related to gradients in estuary salinity and estuary <b>entrance</b> <b>width</b> and correlation with richness indicated nestedness only in the matrix of the most dispersive trait group. In the variance partitioning approach measures of turnover and nestedness between paired samples each from different estuaries were related to environmental distance in different gradients. Distance between estuaries was unimportant suggesting importance of factors characterizing the estuaries. While the high dispersive species mainly were sorted in the salinity gradient, apparently according to their tolerance ranges towards salinity, the two less dispersive traits were additionally affected by estuary <b>entrance</b> <b>width</b> and possibly also area. The results exemplify a mechanism of community assembly in the marine realm where the niche factor salinity in conjunction with differential dispersal structure invertebrates in a metacommunity of connected estuaries, and support the idea that dispersive species are more controlled by the environment than less dispersive species...|$|E

The influence of wave, tide and fluvial processes interact to control sediment erosion, transport and deposition in clastic coastal environments. This results in mixed-process coastal systems, which can form good quality, yet geometrically complex reservoir deposits. Channels in modern analogue mixed process environments provide useful insights into how wave, tide and fluvial processes affect paleochannels and can aid subsurface stratigraphic correlation and palaeoenvironmental reconstruction. The Gulf of Carpentaria is an epicontinental sea which formed as a result of sea level rise during the last marine transgression. Holocene deposits have prograded over low gradient bathymetry and display a range of channel forms. The channels that traverse these coastal plains cannot be satisfactorily characterised by simple morphological classification. They have morphologically complex patterns which have developed in response to the seasonal variations in fluvial, tide and wave energy. A numerical examination of the effects of fluvial, tidal and wave energy on the geometry and morphology of 70 single and distributary channels in the Gulf Carpentaria was undertaken using desktop based statistical analyses. Catchment area was used as a proxy for fluvial discharge in these largely ungagged catchments while wave height and tidal range was applied directly from available gauged data. These channels were divided into two subsets based on whether their channel mouths were best described by linear or exponential trends and by the channels being either distributary or single channels. These four groups were then tested separately to assess their geometrical characteristics, including the rate of decrease in channel width downstream of equi-width (fluvial) reaches, and the wave, tide and fluvial ratios. Of the analysed channels 65 % where found to have a linear width profile, and their parallel banked profile was further enhanced by a strong positive correlation with catchment which exhibited very low slope of distance to equi-width. These parallel banked (linear) channels were found to be fluvial dominated while the other 35 % had an exponential width profile with their <b>entrance</b> <b>width</b> visually exhibiting a strong funnelling characteristic, and the channels having a wider <b>entrance</b> <b>width</b> and a longer distance to equi-width. These exponential channels are more tidally dominated. There was a general decrease in tidal energy and wave influence with increase in distance to equivalent width in the channels, this relationship implies that a channel's distance to equivalent width can be used to identify where the fluvial energy is least effective moving downstream indicating that another process is dominant which is usually tidal or in some cases wave energy. It is also shown that there are characteristic relationships between geometric variables like <b>entrance</b> <b>width</b> at the channel mouth and the rate of decrease in channel width downstream of equivalent - width (slope) with proxies of fluvial influences and tidal range. These relationships may overlap {{as a result of the}} complex morphodynamic feedbacks between fluvial discharge, tidal propagation and wave height in this tropical monsoonal environment. Thesis (M.

This study examined the effect different combinations of fire frequency and topography have on (i) the number of hollow bearing logs and (ii) the presence and size of hollows within logs. The influence of wildfire severity and logging were also examined. Hollow availability (i. e. density of hollow bearing logs and hollow presence within logs) was greatest at sites burnt at ‘low’ frequency. The density of hollow logs was greater in gullies, though the effect of fire frequency did not vary with topographic position. Hollows showing signs of internal fire charring typically had a greater <b>entrance</b> <b>width</b> than unburnt hollows, which suggests fire plays an important role in creating large hollows. The number of hollow bearing logs increased with logging intensity, due to unmerchantable timber being left in situ. Wildfire severity had little effect on log hollows.

Studies indicate that in most taxa favoured tree hollows are those in larger trees and higher from the ground, generally thought to be related to decreased predation risk and a more optimal thermal environment. However, neither of these ideas has been tested definitively. Here, we investigate the microclimate of daytime den sites in tree hollows of common brushtail possums in tropical northern Australia. We compare tree and hollow characteristics of dens known to be used by possums, and those not known to be used, to determine whether possums choose trees with microhabitats with a more favourable daytime microclimate. Possums chose to den in tree hollows which were on average 1. 6 °C cooler during the day, and were more buffered from temperature extremes, than other potential den locations. Important factors explaining daytime temperatures between hollows included height of the hollow, <b>entrance</b> <b>width</b> and tree diameter. Tropical arboreal marsupials have been identified as being particularly vulnerable to climate change and there are calls to identify and preserve natural refuges, such as tree hollows, which could buffer them from extreme temperatures.

Each nest has a volume of 5000 cm³. Eighty octo-blocks were deployed as artificial reefs at 10 m from each other at 15 different depths at two sites by divers with the help of the winch of the R/V EGESUF.

40|$|The {{influence}} of sloping boundaries on long wave response of bays and harbours is studies in this work. Laboratory experiments are performed to help validate the theoretical analysis which is applicable to nonbreaking waves. A set of long wave equations in the Langrangian description is derived which includes terms {{to account for}} nonlinear, dispersive, and dissipative processes for wave propagation in two horizontal coordinates. A finite element model is developed based on these equations which is capable of treating arbitrary geometry and the runup of nonbreaking waves on a beach. An analytical harbour response model, capable of treating narrow rectangular harbours with variable bathymetry and sidewall geometry, is developed and applied to several simple geometries. The model shows that for a given harbour length and <b>entrance</b> <b>width,</b> the resonant frequencies and the response of a harbour are very dependent on the harbour sidewall geometry and bathymetry. Some of the nonlinear effects of the runup of nonbreaking waves on a plane beach are discussed. In particular, the time average of the water surface time history at a fixed spatial location is negative and the wave crests are smaller than the troughs. Nonlinear effects do not alter the runup maxima or minima and the maximum fluid acceleration occurs {{at the point of}} maximum rundown of the wave. Laboratory experiments were performed to determine the long wave response of a narrow rectangular harbour whose still water depth decreases linearly between the harbour entrance and the shoreline. Good agreement with the finite element model was obtained, including the prediction of the depression of the mean water level within the harbour. A three-dimensional application of the finite element model treats the runup of solitary waves on a coastline with variable bottom topography and a curved shoreline. The results indicate the model can predict the trapping of wave energy along a sloping coastal margin, a process of fundamental importance for predicting potential tsunami damage...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} that has been presented in this report {{is a part of}} an ongoing study on the siltation of tidal harbors. The study deals with the water motion in the harbor entrance, which motion causes the siltation. As yet, too little is known about this complicated time-dependent water motion. The data obtained during the research will be used to calibrate the 3 -D numerical model Trisula, so that this model {{can be used as a}} tool to predict the water motion in a harbor entrance. With the present knowledge of the transport of cohesive sediments, a better prediction of the siltation of a particular harbor entrance will then be possible. Experiments have been performed in a physical model at the Laboratory of Fluid Mechanics of the Delft University of Technology. In these experiments the influences, on the flow patterns in the harbor entrance and the exchange of heat between harbor and river, of the geometries of the harbor and the harbor entrance, the tidal period and tidal water level changes were examined. Measurements of the time-dependent velocity and temperature fields were made in five model harbors. In the experiments without tidal water level changes three harbors had their length axes perpendicular to the length axis of the river, namely (1) a square harbor of 1 m 2, (2) a rectangular harbor of 1 x 2 m 2 and (3) a square harbor of 1 m 2 with a narrowed entrance of 0. 5 m; one harbor, (4), of 1 m 2 and an <b>entrance</b> <b>width</b> of 1 m had its length axis at an angle of 45 degrees to the length axis of the flume. In the experiment with tidal water level changes a rectangular harbor, (5), with an <b>entrance</b> <b>width</b> of 1 m and a storage area of 8 m 2 had its length axis perpendicular to the length axis of the river. It can be concluded that:  details of circulating flows and gyres depend markedly on the geometry of the harbor.  the progress of the phenomena after slack water in model harbor (2), that is the development of a new primary gyre, does not seem to depend on the tidal period. As a consequence, the phase difference between the development of the gyre and the accelerating flow in the river increases as the period decreases.  the flow pattern in the harbor is highly influenced by the orientation of the harbor entrance. An explanation for this phenomenon is deficient at the moment.  in the model harbors, except harbor (3), a quite strong secondary current is present in the gyre. The maximum velocity in the secondary current is on the average 15 per cent of the main flow. This means that a three-dimensional numerical model will be necessary to simulate the flow pattern in the harbor correctly.  close to the downstream sidewall, in all model harbors, larger water velocities (20 to 50 per cent larger) were observed near the bottom than higher in the water column. Near the bed high-momentum fluid from the mixing layer between harbor and river appears to be transported into the harbor.  tidal water level changes cause an acceleration in the development of the new gyre towards high tide. Towards low tide the development of the new gyre is hindered by the emptying of the basin.  in harbors (1), (2) and (4) a large increase in advective exchange takes place around slack water. The influence of turbulence seems to be of secondary importance during this phase of the tide.  a narrowed entrance highly reduces the exchange of mass between harbor and river at slackwater.  if the flow pattern in the harbor comprises various gyres, in this research harbor (2), the normalized exchange will be less because the secondary,tertiary, etc. gyres do not contribute to the exchange process.  wgen the current in the river is around maximum,the flow is quasi-steady for a quite large duration. The exchange then takes place through the mixing layer between river and harbor, that is, it is caused by turbulent motions only.  although during slack water a less refined turbulence model is sufficient in a numerical model, the modeling of turbulence is important during the quasi-steady phase of the tide, especially when the geometry of the entrance is more complex (e. g. harbor (4)) ...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} carried out in the Gulf of 0 zmir in the Aegean Sea between June 2006 and November 2008. The purpose was the {{creation}} of a new concept of the artificial reef for Octopus vulgaris, with a view to establishing new artificial reef sites to be used in the fisheries management of this species (MPA, NTZ or fishing areas). First, the main characteristics of natural octopus nests were recorded (<b>entrance</b> <b>width,</b> length, etc.) by divers. These characteristics were used in the construction of new octahedral artificial reef blocks. The blocks were made of reinforced concrete, in a shape like that of an inverted pyramid, with an upper surface of 100 x 100 x 25 cm³ and a lower one of 60 x 60 cm². Four cylindrical holes each with two ellipsoidal openings were placed in one face and in the lateral edge of the octo-block, to serve as the entrances to the artificial nest. Each nest has a volume of 5000 cm³. Eighty octo-blocks were deployed as artificial reefs at 10 m from each other at 15 different depths at two sites by divers with the help of the winch of the R/V EGESUF. These artificial octo-reefs were censused by direct observation. Twenty-eight octopuses were sampled at the end of 25 dives. Minimum mantle length of the octopuses was 75 mm and the maximum 249 mm, with an average of 152. 71 mm. The average total length was calculated to be 918. 57 mm. The weight of the specimens was between 244 g and 7140 g with an average of 2335. 43 g. The results showed that both sites were inhabited by octopuses coming from the artificial reefs, which used them as nests. These nests seem to have constituted special places for fisheries management and will permit the assessment of reserve areas or marine protection areas (MPA), thus opening up a new perspective for Turkish fisheries. Este estudo foi realizado no golfo de 0 zmir, no Mar Egeu, entre junho de 2006 e novembro de 2008. O objetivo foi uma nova concepção de recife artificial para Octopus vulgaris, visando o estabelecimento de novos locais a serem utilizados na gestão da pesca dessa espécie (MPA, NTZ ou zonas de pesca). Primeiramente foram consideradas as principais características dos ninhos naturais do polvo (largura da entrada, comprimento, etc.). A seguir essas características foram utilizadas na construção de novos blocos octaédricos de recifes artificiais. Os blocos foram feitos de concreto armado, assemelhando-se a uma pirâmide invertida, nas dimensões de 100 x 100 x 25 cm³ na face superior e 60 x 60 cm² na face inferior. Quatro furos cilíndricos, com duas aberturas elipsoidais, foram dispostos em uma só face e na borda lateral do octo-bloco, correspondendo às entradas do ninho artificial. Cada ninho tem um volume de 5000 cm³. Foram implantados 80 octo-blocos para servirem como recifes artificiais, guardando a distância de 10 m entre si, em 15 profundidades e em dois locais diferentes, com auxílio de mergulhadores e guincho do R/ V EGESUF. Esses recifes foram recenseados, utilizando-se o método de observação direta. Vinte e oito polvos foram amostrados ao final de 25 mergulhos. O comprimento mínimo do manto do polvo foi de 75 mm e o máximo de 249 mm, com média de 152, 71 mm. O comprimento médio total foi determinado em 918, 57 mm. O peso dos espécimes ficou entre 244 e 7140 g, com média de 2335, 43 g. Os resultados mostram que ambos os locais foram sustentados pelos polvos provenientes dos recifes artificiais, que os utilizaram como ninhos. Esses ninhos parecem constituir locais especiais para manejo da pesca, e permitirão a avaliação de áreas de reserva ou áreas marinhas de proteção (MPA), abrindo, desta forma, novas perspectivas para a pesca turca...|$|E
40|$|The atomic force {{microscope}} (AFM) {{provides a}} powerful instrument for investigating and manipulating biological samples down to the subnanometer scale. In contrast to other microscopy methods, AFM does not require labeling, staining, nor fixation of samples and allows the specimen to be fully hydrated in buffer solution during the experiments. Moreover, AFM clearly compares in resolution to other techniques. In general, the AFM can be operated in an imaging or a force spectroscopy mode. In the present work, advantage was taken of this versatility to investigate single biomolecules and biomolecular assemblies. A novel approach to investigate the visco-elastic behavior of biomolecules under force was established, using dextran as an example. While a molecule tethered between a solid support and the cantilever tip was stretched at a constant velocity, the thermally driven oscillation of the cantilever was recorded. Analysis of the cantilever Brownian noise provided information about the visco-elastic properties of dextran that corresponded well to parameters obtained by alternative methods. However, the approach presented here was easier to implement and less time-consuming than previously used methods. A computer controlled force-clamp system was set up, circumventing the need for custom built analogue electronics. A commercial PicoForce AFM was extended by two computers which hosted data acquisition hardware. While the first computer recorded data, the second computer drove the AFM bypassing the manufacturer's microscope control software. To do so, a software-based proportional-integral-differential (PID) controller was implemented on the second computer. It allowed the force applied to a molecule to be held constant over time. After tuning of the PID controller, response times obtained using that force-clamp setup were {{comparable to those of}} the recently reported analogue systems. The performance of the setup was demonstrated by force-clamp unfolding of a pentameric Ig 25 construct and the membrane protein NhaA. In the latter case, short-lived unfolding intermediates that were populated for less than 10 ms, could be revealed. Conventional single-molecule dynamic force spectroscopy was used to unfold the serine:threonine antiporter SteT from Bacillus subtilis, an integral membrane protein. Unfolding force patterns revealed the unfolding barriers stabilizing structural segments of SteT. Ligand binding did not induce new unfolding barriers suggesting that weak interactions with multiple structural segments were involved. In contrast, ligand binding caused changes in the energy landscape of all structural segments, thus turning the protein from a brittle, rigid into a more stable, structurally flexible conformation. Functionally, rigidity in the ligand-free state was thought to facilitate specific ligand binding, while flexibility and increased stability were required for conformational changes associated with substrate translocation. These results support the working model for transmembrane transport proteins that provide alternate access of the binding site to either face of the membrane. Finally, high-resolution imaging was exploited to visualize the extracellular surface of Cx 26 gap junction hemichannels (connexons). AFM topographs reveal pH-dependent structural changes of the extracellular connexon surface in presence of HEPES, an aminosulfonate compound. At low pH (&lt; 6. 5), connexons showed a narrow and shallow channel entrance, which represented the closed pore. Increasing pH values resulted in a gradual opening of the pore, which was reflected by increasing channel <b>entrance</b> <b>widths</b> and depths. At pH &gt; 7. 6 the pore was fully opened and the pore diameter and depth did not increase further. Importantly, coinciding with pore gating a slight rotation of the subunits was observed. In the absence of aminosulfonate compounds, such as HEPES, acidification did not affect pore diameters and depths, retaining the open state. Thus, the intracellular concentration of taurine, a naturally abundant aminosulfonate compound, might be used to tune gap junction sensitivity at low pH...|$|R
40|$|Amphibian {{populations are}} in general decline internationally. The current {{situation}} of amphibian populations highlights {{the urgent need}} for comprehensive information on species’ ecology to better assess conservation and management strategies. Movement behaviour and microhabitat selection give insights into how amphibians use the environment and interact with their surroundings, and are essential to establishing their sensitivity to the global decline phenomenon and identifying the critical habitat features essential for their success. New Zealand native frogs (Anura: Leiopelmatidae, Leiopelma, nine species) were formerly distributed throughout New Zealand, but habitat modification and predation by introduced mammalian predators have influenced recent (Holocene) extinctions and declines, reducing the fauna to four species with major range reductions. All extant Leiopelma are classified as threatened both nationally and internationally, creating an urgent need for species-specific behavioural research to support conservation management. I investigated activity, movement behaviour and microhabitat use of L. archeyi and L. pakeka for better evaluation of long term population viability and improved husbandry in captivity. L. archeyi is the smallest of the Leiopelma species and has been able to co-occur with introduced predators (e. g. rats), whereas L. pakeka is the largest, and the only natural population is confined to a predator-free island. I used a fine-scale tracking technique (i. e. non-toxic fluorescent powders) to track L. archeyi and L. pakeka movements throughout their activity periods when on the surface in their natural habitats, Whareorino Forest and Maud Island, respectively, to obtain detailed information on their activity patterns, movement behaviour, and microhabitat and retreat site use. I investigated in more detail L. pakeka retreat sites by measuring the dimensions of the retreat site <b>entrances</b> (<b>width,</b> height and diameter) as well as the activity inside those retreat sites. Lastly, I used long-term frog survey data to examine the indirect impacts (i. e. behavioural changes) ship rats (Rattus rattus) may have on L. archeyi by studying the microhabitat use and home range of this species in an area with and without rat control within Whareorino Forest. L. archeyi had a longer activity period than L. pakeka with the former being active up to two hours after sunrise, but L. pakeka moved more and further than L. archeyi during their activity periods. Additionally, L. archeyi had a smaller home range compared to L. pakeka which suggests more prominent site fidelity and more sedentary behaviour in this species. Both species actively sought out specific microhabitats among the ones that were available, either to use during movement or to use as retreat sites, but those microhabitat types also differed between species. L. archeyi were more often found above ground level than L. pakeka and tended to use microhabitats that provided cover. L. archeyi preferred to use trees as retreat sites (roots, branches or trunk) whereas L. pakeka used trees (roots) and rocks. L. pakeka retreat sites had lower and more stable temperatures than outside retreats. Frogs were active inside retreats with no evidence of sleep behaviour for at least the first few hours of retreat use. In the rat control area, L. archeyi used more soil, leaf litter and ferns, and {{were also more likely to}} be found at ground level than frogs in the presence of higher numbers of rats. Abiotic factors also influenced movement patterns and microhabitat selection of both species, affirming water balance and thermoregulation are important drivers in frog behaviour. Behavioural attributes and small body size could be aiding in the persistence of L. archeyi in the presence of rats, and large body size and differences in behavioural attributes are likely to put L. pakeka at risk if rats were to reach their habitat. My findings inform on the ecology and behaviour of two Leiopelma species providing valuable information on their habitat requirements, which will enable more effective captive husbandry and better assessment of the appropriateness of translocation sites, aiding in their conservation management...|$|R
