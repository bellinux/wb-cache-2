25|$|The present garden {{follows a}} layout {{established}} by Mellon. Each <b>flower</b> <b>bed</b> is planted {{with a series}} of Littleleaf lindens and Kennedy saucer magnolias bordered by low hedges of boxwood and American Holly. The outer edge of the <b>flower</b> <b>bed</b> facing the central lawn are edged with boxwood. Perennial flowering plants include delphinium, hollyhock, lavender, and roses. Many seasonal flowers are interspersed to add nearly year round color. Spring blooming bulbs planted in the rose garden include jonquil, daffodil, fritillaria, grape hyacinth, tulips, chionodoxa and squill. Summer blooming annuals change yearly. In the fall chrysanthemum and flowering kale bring color until early winter.|$|E
25|$|The {{courtyard}} was adorned {{by a long}} rectangular <b>flower</b> <b>bed,</b> with fifty-five sycamore {{and eight}} tamarisk trees planted in deep pits filled with soil. This {{is one of the}} very few archaeologically documented temple-gardens of ancient Egypt that are known enough about to reconstruct its appearance. The maintenance of such a garden more than 1km from the Nile into the arid desert must have required the constant work of many gardeners and an elaborate irrigation system.|$|E

For example, {{it can be used to}} calculate the amount of area taken up by an irregularly shaped <b>flower</b> <b>bed</b> or swimming pool when designing the layout of a piece of property.|$|E
40|$|<b>Flower</b> <b>beds</b> {{are one of}} the aesthetically most {{striking}} elements of public green areas. Regardless of such an important role, there is very little research dealing with <b>flower</b> <b>beds</b> as an individual element in space. Research is most oft en based on studying flower species in a broader context. This research tried to ascertain to what extent citizens and professionals perceive <b>flower</b> <b>beds</b> in their everyday lives. Results show {{that more than half of}} the subjects notice <b>flower</b> <b>beds</b> on a daily basis. Furthermore, statistically significant differences were determined in the professionals’ and nonprofessionals’ knowledge of certain locations in which <b>flower</b> <b>beds</b> are present, and in their tendency to participate in projects involving the design and maintenance of <b>flower</b> <b>beds.</b> Namely, professionals are more acquainted with the locations of <b>flower</b> <b>beds,</b> and are more likely to participate in a project involving the design and maintenance of <b>flower</b> <b>beds.</b> Results point to the importance of <b>flower</b> <b>beds</b> and the need for further research of their role as a part of urban green spaces...|$|R

Their advert, which involved parents discussing {{the use of the}} tissues for their ill child, was later discussed on You're Hired as being humorously flawed on a number of points – the child being sent to school when she was ill; one parent pinching the child's nose and thus likely to spread their illness; the mother appearing dazed; and the product appearing to have been chucked {{out of the back of}} the car and into a <b>flower</b> <b>bed.</b>|$|E
25|$|On {{the hill}} to the east of Grenadier Pond, {{extending}} up to Colborne Lodge Road, is a landscaped ornamental garden area. There is a 'rock garden' extending {{from the top of the}} hill near Grenadier Cafe, extending south-west nearly to the pond shore. Along Colborne Lodge Road is a hanging garden and ornamental garden with fountains, the 'sunken gardens.' At the bottom of the hill, nearly at the shore line is a large maple leaf-shaped <b>flower</b> <b>bed,</b> visible from the top of the hill. The area was a tobogganing area in the early 1900s. Toboggan runs were constructed from the top of the hill extending down to the pond's ice surface. Wedding photography is no longer permitted in the hillside gardens area.|$|E
25|$|Reverend Robert Alfred Humble BA (1864–1929) was an Anglican priest, born in Heathery Cleugh, Weardale, Durham, England. His {{father was}} Reverend Emerson Humble (1837–1901). His career was marked with much {{pastoral}} work, including organising local fundraising events and meals for the elderly. He {{contributed to the}} work of committees, and joined in local social events, being a member of his church's cricket team. It is in this context of sociability and regular work among his congregation that the events surrounding the delayed discovery of his death, mentioned in several newspapers, remain a puzzle. Having suffered a seizure, he apparently lay openly on a <b>flower</b> <b>bed</b> in his vicarage garden on a dark February night, while his congregation spent eleven hours searching for him on the adjacent moorland. He was vicar St Mark's 1897–1901.|$|E

25|$|The genre {{originated}} in the Middle East and was disseminated by folk storytellers. It was assimilated by individual authors. Dastan's plots are based both on folklore and classical literary subjects. Dastan was particularly popular in Urdu literature, typologically close to other narrative genres in Eastern literatures, such as Persian masnawi, Punjabi qissa, Sindhi waqayati bait, etc., and also reminiscent of the European novel. The oldest known Urdu dastans are Dastan-i-Amir Hamza, recorded in the early seventeenth century, and the on longer extantBustan-iKhayal (The Garden of Imagination or The Garden of Khayal) by Mir Taqi Khayal (d. 1760). Most of the narrative dastans were recorded {{in the early nineteenth}} century, representing the inclusion of 'wandering' motifs borrowed from the folklore of the Middle East, central Asia and northern India. These include Bagh-oBahar (The Garden and Spring) by Mir Amman, Mazhab-i-Ishq (The Religion of Love) by Nihalchand Lahori, Araish-i-Mahfil (The Adornment of the Assembly) by Hyderbakhsh Hyderi, and Gulzar-i-Chin (The <b>Flower</b> <b>Bed</b> of Chin) by Khalil Ali Khan Ashq.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Dreamlover" [...] was {{directed}} by Diane Martel and filmed in upstate New York in June 1993. The video features scenes of Carey swimming in a small pond by a waterfall, boarding a colorful hot air balloon, and dancing alongside several shirtless male dancers. As the video begins, Carey is swimming underwater while wearing clothing. She is soon gasping for air and climbing into a <b>flower</b> <b>bed</b> above. As she frolics and rolls in a field, scenes of Carey boarding a hot air balloon are inter-cut. Her dog Jack makes a cameo appearance, as he follows her through the field and pond. After a short interval of dancing alongside several male dancers, Carey leaves with her dog as the video concludes. After filming the video, Carey revealed that the water was so cold that she refused to swim until the director, Martel, dived in first. Author Chris Nickson felt the video captured the song's soft and relaxed nature: [...] "The casual feel, almost like clips from home movies edited together, captured the song's off-the-shoulder airiness." [...] The video received heavy rotation on several video music channels, which added to the song's chart performance.|$|E

2500|$|The terrace {{and garden}} were {{constructed}} in 1736 shortly after Walpole moved into Number 10. The terrace, extending across the back, provides a {{full view of}} St James's Park. The garden is dominated by an open lawn of [...] that wraps around Numbers 10 and 11 in an L-shape. No longer [...] "fitted with variety Walle fruit and diverse fruit trees" [...] {{as it was in}} the 17th century, there is now a centrally located <b>flower</b> <b>bed</b> around a holly tree surrounded by seats. Tubs of flowers line the steps from the terrace; around the walls are rose beds with flowering and evergreen shrubs. (See North elevation of Number 10 with steps leading to the garden) The terrace and garden have provided a casual setting for many gatherings of First Lords with foreign dignitaries, Cabinet ministers, guests, and staff. Prime Minister Tony Blair, for example, hosted a farewell reception in 2007 for his staff on the terrace. John Major announced his 1995 resignation as leader of the Conservative Party in the garden. Churchill called his secretaries the [...] "garden girls" [...] because their offices overlook the garden. It was also the location of the first press conference announcing the Coalition Government between David Cameron's Conservatives and Nick Clegg's Liberal Democrats.|$|E
2500|$|Therefore, I beseeched the Lord {{to teach}} me His statutes. After my prayer as usual I opened my Bible with closed eyes and {{put my finger on}} the right place.

[...] I asked the Lord: [...] "O Lord! What about until then?" [...] And again I opened the Bible, that time on 1 Timothy 1:15"This is a {{faithful}} saying, and worthy of all acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief." [...] And for the third time I tempted the Lord, saying: [...] "O Lord! I am not an Abraham nor a Jew, I'm a sinner, but involve me to understand Your Will." [...] And then I opened the Book of SirahJoshua 24:29-30, where I read in the new American Translation: [...] "Said to myself, I will water my plants, my <b>flower</b> <b>bed</b> I will drench; and suddenly this rivulet of mine became a river, then this stream of mine, a sea. Thus do I send my teaching forth shining like a dawn, to become known afar off. Thus do I pour out instruction like prophecy and bestow it on generations to come." ...|$|E
