40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [80]- 82) This study {{applies the}} existing quantitative models of process learning {{to investigate the}} <b>economic</b> <b>trade-off</b> associated with the benefits of gradual process improvement. These models describe an imperfect production process which produces defective parts randomly. The defects are indicative of abnormal variations in the process quality. At the end of production of each lot, if defects are discovered, two different policies are considered. One is to invest a small amount {{to prevent the occurrence}} of similar defects in subsequent lots by improving the quality of the production process. The other is to continue production of the next lot in the usual manner without any improvement. A stochastic dynamic programming model is used to determine the optimal policy which gives the minimal expected discounted present cost over an infinite horizon. The effects of lost production time spent in gradual process learning and improvement are scrutinized for investigating the <b>economic</b> <b>trade-off</b> between the benefit of process improvement and the cost of lost production time.

40|$|To {{properly}} {{design a}} pipe heating system, {{the basic principles}} of heat transfer from an insulated pipe must be understood. The three methods of heat flow are conduction, convection (both forced and natural) and radiation. The total heat loss from a pipe must be determined first, since this is the heat which must be replaced to maintain a pipe at a given temperature. A steam heating system requires an analysis of the heat loss from the pipe as well as an analysis of the capacity of the heating system. The economics of steam heat include the accessories as well as the inefficiencies of steam heat. The design of an electric heating system normally involves far fewer components and engineering complexities than does a comparable steam system. The basic system is comprised of the heater, controls and connection accessories. Today there are several <b>economic</b> <b>trade-offs</b> to be made in selecting a pipe heating system.

40|$|This article {{considers}} {{the decision to}} purchase insurance against possible losses of a property or wealth. The decision involves a standard <b>economic</b> <b>trade-off</b> between the benefit of protection against loss {{and the cost of}} insurance premium. The premium is paid out of the income and decreases the consumption of other goods and services, rather than out of wealth and decreases the property or wealth. The demand for insurance depends mainly on the income and preferences. As a result, unlike in the standard model, a fair premium is neither necessary nor sufficient for the optimality of full coverage insurance. Rather, the individuals with higher incomes purchase full coverage insurance even at unfair prices of insurance while the individuals with lower income purchase partial coverage insurance at a fair price.

40|$|Abstract: Levee setback �location � {{and height}} are {{important}} issues in flood levee system design and modification. This paper derives an economic-engineering {{theory of the}} optimal trade-off of levee setback for height both for original and redesigned flood levees, demonstrating the interconnection of levee setback, height, costs and risks, and economically optimal design. These analyses assume stationary flood hydrology and static ratios among damageable property value, unit construction cost, and land price. The <b>economic</b> <b>trade-off</b> of levee setback for height depends on economic cost and benefit and hydraulic parameters, and only indirectly on flood frequency and economic damage parameters. The redesign rules derived in this paper indicate conditions where existing levees should be raised or moved in response to changes in conditions. Numerical examples illustrate the results. This paper demonstrates several ideas and theory for economic flood levee system planning and policy rather than providing guidelines for direct design practice...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we model {{earnings}} {{management as}} a consequence of the interaction among self-interested economic agents [...] namely, the managers, the shareholders, and the regulators. In our model, a manager controls a stochastic production technology and makes periodic accounting reports about his or her performance; an owner chooses a compensation contract to induce desirable managerial inputs and reporting choices by the manager; and a regulatory body selects and enforces accounting standards to achieve certain social objectives. We show that various <b>economic</b> <b>trade-offs</b> give rise to endogenous earnings management. Specifically, the owner may reduce agency costs by designing a compensation contract that tolerates some earnings management because such a contract allocates the compensation risk more efficiently. The earnings-management activity produces accounting reports that deviate from those prescribed by accounting standards. Given such reports, the valuation of the firm may be nonlinear and s-shaped, thereby recognizing the manager 2 ̆ 7 s reporting incentives. We also explore policy implications, noting that (1) the regulator may find enforcing a zero-tolerance policy [...] no earnings management allowed [...] economically undesirable; and (2) when selecting the optimal accounting standard, valuation concerns may conflict with stewardship concerns. We conclude that earnings management is better understood in a strategic context that involves various <b>economic</b> <b>trade-offs...</b>|$|R

30|$|As Heijke and Borghans (1998) point out, {{broadening}} VE programmes {{has both}} advantages and disadvantages. The broader, or less specialised, the programme, the easier the adaptation to both occupational requirements outside the programme’s specific occupational domain and future innovations within the domain itself. A narrow programme, however, provides {{a high degree}} of specialisation in a particular discipline or specific occupation. Graduates who obtain a job in such an occupation shortly after graduation will perform better than other graduates with a broader education. If there is insufficient work in this specific occupation, they will need to resort to a different one. There, they are not likely to perform as well and will find it more difficult to adapt than those with broader training who find work in this occupation. In broadening an education programme, the lower costs of adaptation to different occupational requirements are offset by lower performance in a specialist occupation. The question of broad versus narrow education programmes therefore involves an <b>economic</b> <b>trade-off</b> between these two implications of the programme for future labour market positions.|$|E
30|$|From the {{analysis}} of the <b>economic</b> <b>trade-off,</b> for the 20 -MHz case, the profit decreases at a considerably higher rate (compared to 5 -MHz bandwidth), which is due to the lower rate of decrease from the curve of the costs, implying that for PLR ≤ 1 % and a price of 0.001 €/MByte, the curve for the profit in percentage considering the 20 -MHz bandwidth is similar to the one for price of 0.01 €/MByte considering 5 -MHz bandwidth, mainly for the shortest cell sizes. Then, the profit in percentage terms starts to decrease faster. For example, for R = 1, 000 m, one can conclude that with a price of 1 / 5, i.e. 0.001 or 0.002 €/MByte, for the 20 -MHz case (compared to 0.005 or 0.01 €/MByte for the 5 -MHz bandwidth), values for the profit are 241 % or 583 % (against 130 % or 360 % for the 5 -MHz bandwidth), i.e. respectively 241 / 130 = 1.85 or 583 / 360 = 1.62 times higher than the ones from the 5 -MHz bandwidth.|$|E
