40|$|The Lancara Formation is {{a unit of}} {{carbonate}} sediments of Lower to Middle Cambrian age in the Cantabrian Mountains {{of northern}} Spain. The formation is divisible into a Dolomite Member, a Limestone Member and a Griotte Member. The Dolomite Member and the Limestone Member consist mainly of very shallow marine carbonate sediments, devoid of any fossils. Algal structures like stromatolites and oncolites are the only traces of Cambrian life found in them. It {{is likely that the}} Dolomite Member represents a sebkha-facies since it is mainly composed of finely to medium crystalline dolomites with intraformational breccias and ‘birdseye ’ structures. The limestones are predominantly intrasparudites with stromatolites and oncolites. Locally the lime-stones have been subaerially exposed in Cambrian times. The Limestone Member is overlain by the Griotte Member. Locally the contact is <b>disconformable.</b> The Griotte Member is composed of red, argillaceous, nodular limestones and shales. These are very fossiliferous and contain glauconite-like pellets (muscovite- 1 M). The red color of the sediment is due to dispersed hematite.

It starts with sebkha-like deposits and changes upward via algal lime-stones (algal reef?) into open marine biosparudites and biomicrudites and shales.

A third accretion event (late Paleocene) is recorded in coastal Ecuador. Each accretion event correlates with the uplift and erosion of the Eastern Cordillera and with a sedimentary hiatus in the eastern areas. In Ecuador, accretion of oceanic terranes contributed to the build up of the Andes through tectonic underplating of low-density material, and the eastern areas did not behave as flexural foreland basins during late Cretaceous-Paleogene times...|$|E

The Datta Formation has <b>disconformable</b> lower contact with the Kingriali Formation, and the upper contact with the Shinawri Formation is gradational. In the Kohat area, the formation is reported to be composed of quartzose, dolomitic, and oolitic limestone, suggesting a shallow marine shoreline with the development of a supratidal flat (Fatmi et al. 1990). The age is of Datta Formation is reported as early Jurassic (pre-Toarcian) (Shah 2009). The Jurassic system in Pakistan characterizes mainly limestones, shale, and sandstone. The lower part of the early Jurassic (Datta Formation) is composed of arenaceous and argillaceous sediments dominantly continental origin, grading upward in a sequence of marine calcareous/argillaceous rocks of Shinawri formation. The marine transgression in the Kohat–Potwar depositional basin is suggested to have occurred during late early Jurassic (Shah 2009).

A switch {{in the position of}} the Late Cambrian depocentre from the north-west to the south coincided with cessation of terrigenous clastic deposition and accumulation of Sequence 2, the limestones of the Minaret Formation. Previously unreported talus breccias from the Independence Hills provide important clues to basin configuration at this time.

Regional semi-conformable alteration zones are composed of various proportions of quartz + epidote ± amphibole ± chlorite ± plagioclase feldspar. These regional, semiconformable alteration zones are locally crosscut by several relatively narrow, northeast trending <b>disconformable</b> alteration zones composed of fine-grained chlorite and/or sericite that are closely associated with synvolcanic fault zones. Electron microprobe analyses of the various alteration mineral phases (epidote group minerals, chlorite, amphibole, white mica, and feldspar) have been conducted {{in an effort to}} better understand the hydrothermal processes associated with the development of the semiconformable and <b>disconformable</b> alteration zones at the Five Mile Lake Prospect. These analyses indicate that: a) epidote group minerals range in composition from oisite/clinozoisite to pistacite; b) chlorite is dominantly ripidolite; c) amphibole is primarily actinolite and ferroactinolite, with magnesio-hornblende and ferro-hornblende also present; d) sericite is finegrained muscovite; and e) feldspar is albite. This mineral chemistry suggests the presence of a complex, long-lived hydrothermal system that evolved from seafloor-proximal (hundreds of meters) to deeper subseafloor environments (~ 1 - 3 km) as the volcanic rocks were buried by rapid, dominantly effusive mafic to intermediate volcanism and associated sedimentation. Alteration mineral chemistry at the Five Mile Lake Prospect is remarkably similar to that from the Noranda VHMS mining camp of Canada as well as other VHMS orebodies. This mineral chemistry, combined with favorable volcanology and numerous untested geophysical targets, suggest that the Five Mile Lake Prospect, as well as the uppermost several hundred meters of the Lower Member of the Ely Greenstone, have excellent exploration potential for VHMS mineral deposits.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Previous studies {{suggested}} {{that only one}} ophiolite, the “Khoy ophiolite”, existed near Khoy, northwestern Iran. This the-sis is no longer tenable. Combined investigations (biostratigraphic, chronostratigraphic, geochonometric, geochronologic, and geochemical) demonstrate that {{there are at least}} two and perhaps three ophiolite remnants in the Khoy area: (1) A Late Jurassic (early to middle Oxfordian: 156 Ma to 159 Ma 40 Ar- 39 Ar on gabbro) remnant; (2) A Late Cretaceous (early Coniacian: Radiolaria) remnant (~N-MORB geochemistry); and, possibly, (3) A Late Cretaceous (latest Campanian) remnant (E-MORB geochemistry). Because it is impossible to use the term “Khoy ophiolite ” in this report, we refer the ophiolitic rocks in the Khoy area to the “Khoy Complex ” (sensu International Stratigraphic Guide). The sedimentary contact between Late Cretaceous (early Coniacian) red manganiferous ribbon chert lacking calc-alkaline volca-nic contributions and overlying pyroclastics (tuff and tuff breccia) in the far northwestern part of the Khoy complex is of great tectonostratigraphic significance. This interface represents a sudden change from pelagic to pyroclastic sedimentation. Field evidence indicates that the contact is <b>disconformable</b> and is associated with a hiatus of unknown magnitude. Red ribbon chert (lacking calcalkaline contributions) in the same area overlies and is interbedded with N-MORB pillow basalt; early Coniacian Radiolaria were recovered from interpillow siliceous mudstone.

The upper Miocene non-marine Mint Canyon formation is successively overlain by the uppermost Miocene marine "Modelo" formation, the lower Pliocene marine Pico formation, the Pliocene-Pleistocene non-marine Saugus formation, and by Pleistocene terrace deposits and Recent alluvium. Angular unconformities characterize most of the boundaries between these formations, but <b>disconformable</b> relationships appear to exist locally. As a result {{of two or more}} major periods of deformation, the rocks are highly folded, with broken anticlines and dips that vary from horizontal to vertical. Overturning occurs at least at one place. Compressive stresses from the north appear to have been the most active agents of deformation; but the block-type San Gabriel fault, which runs through the Southern part of the Humphreys Station area, may have had some tilting effect upon the beds throughout this whole region. In general, the structural trend is northwest-southeast. Broad folds in the Mint Canyon formation plunge northwestward at low to moderate angles. Post-Modelo thrusting from the north has developed minor folds on the limbs of the major folds. Superimposed on the highly folded formations are the later formations, themselves slightly folded.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Ebb-tidal deltas {{can form}} {{extensive}} strandline sand deposits on barrier-island shorelines. This paper describes the diagnostic textures, sedimentary structures, and geometry of an ebb-tidal delta in a mesotidal setting at North Edisto Inlet, South Carolina. Bedforms and surface textures at North Edisto Inlet reflect ypical ebb-tidal delta circulation patterns. The main ebb channel {{is dominated by}} large ebb-oriented bedforms, and channel sediments become finer grained in the seaward irection. At the inlet throat, the coarsest available sediment forms a lag deposit. Marginal flood channels adjacent to the barrier islands are dominated by flood-oriented bedforms composed of medium-grained sand. Channel-margin l ear bars, flanked by bedforms with opposing orientations, develop where flood channels approach the main ebb channel. The extensive swash platform is dominated by wave energy, which effectively sorts swash platform sediments. Ebb-tidal delta stratigraphy is dominated by sequences deposited by shifting tidal channels and by the migration of swash bars on the swash platform. Proximally, the ebb-tidal delta sequence is dominated by relatively thick tidal-channel deposits which fine upward and have a sharp, <b>disconformable</b> ower contact.

40|$|The Kinnikinic Formation {{of central}} Idaho is a {{sedimentary}} unit consisting principally of orthoquartzite. From its maximum measured thickness of 2285 {{feet in the}} central Lemhi Range near Gilmore, Idaho, it thins westward to 376 feet at the type section and southward to 326 feet near Arco, Idaho. Northeast of the Lemhi Range it occurs only as erosional remnants, due to pre-Devonian erosion. Both the lower and upper contacts of the Kinnikinic Formation are <b>disconformable.</b> The Kinnikinic Formation is light colored, predominately fine to medium grained, thin to medium bedded, and largely cemented by silica overgrowths. Some metamorphic recrystallization has occurred locally. Although parallel laminae and structureless beds predominate within primarily parallel bedding, omikron-type (underwater dune) cross-laminae are locally abundant. The sediments are moderately sorted to well sorted and both positively and negatively skewed. Cumulative-frequency probability curves illustrate traction, 2 ̆ 2 saltation, 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 suspension 2 ̆ 2 populations; some thin sections indicate two 2 ̆ 2 saltation 2 ̆ 2 populations. An open-marine, shallow-shelfal environment influenced by high-energy (tidal?) currents is postulated for deposition of the Kinnikinic Formation {{on the basis of}} the lithlogic uniformity, lateral extent, sedimentary structure, trace fossils, and paleogeographic setting. The Swan Peak Formation of southeastern Idaho and north-central Utah is divisible into a lower member of dark gray shale and quartz silitite, a middle member of brown orthoquartzite and light-colored shale, and an upper member of white orthoquartzite. Correlation of the white, fine- to medium-grained quartzite in the Raft River Range with the Ordovician Eureka Quartzite, considered probable by Compton (1972), is here accepted. The relatively thin nature of the Eureka Quartzite in this area reflects lesser sedimentation rates relative to areas farther south and/ or post-depositional erosion. The Dayley Creek Quartzite of Armstrong (1968) in the Albion Range is complexly faulted; as mapped, all or most of it probably is not correlative with the Kinnikinic Formation. Quartzites in the lower thrust plate of the Phi Kappa Formation in central Idaho are not environmental equivalents of the Kinnikinic Formation to the east, even though they apparently are approximately time equivalent (Churkin, 1963 a, pp. 1612 - 1615). Middle Ordovician, shallow-shelfal orthoquartzit. es (Kinnikinic Formation, upper member of the Swan Peak Formation, Eureka Quartzite, and Mount Wilson Quartzite of southern Canada) are considered to be one originally continuous genetic unit, based on age determinations of overlying and underlying units, <b>disconformable</b> lower and upper contacts, close physical resemblances, and the high probability they were principally derived from the same source area, possibly Cambrian sandstones in the Peace River-Athabasca Arch area of northern Alberta, Canada.

Anomalously high percentages of undulatory quartz grains in Middle Ordovician orthoquartzites of the Cordilleran miogeosynclinal shelf are highly suggestive of straining in situ and are probably related to post-depositional conditions ranging from purely tectonic to intricate combinations of tectonic and nontectonic events...|$|E

40|$|A mapping {{project of}} the surface geology of the Lavino chrome mine and its {{surroundings}} was initiated {{in order to establish}} the surface geological relationships in the area. In so doing the chromitite layer presently being mined has been identified and potential exploration targets in the area have been outlined. The Lavino Chrome mine field area is situated within the eastern lobe of the Bushveld Igneous Complex. The area is bounded by in the north by the Steelpoort Lineament, in the west by the Dwars River fault and in the east by the contact with the Transvaal Sequence floor rocks. Layered igneous rocks (pyroxenites, norites and anorthosites) of the Rustenburg Layered Suite dominate the geological landscape at the Lavino mine. The fact that outcropping igneous rocks of the Critical Zone abut directly against the quartzite floor rocks on the mine property makes this area unique in the Bushveld Complex. The hills in the field area are capped by mafic/ultramafic iron-rich sheet - like bodies. Extensive strike-slip faulting is seen in outcrop in the area to the north/northwest of present mining operations. On the basis of field relationships, the main chromitite layer presently being mined at Lavino is identified as the Middle Group chromitite layer MG 1. Three other prominent chromitite layers stratigraphically associated with MG 1 are identified as the Middle Group chromitites MG 2, MG 3 and MG 4.

Representative samples were thin sectioned and petrographically analyzed for texture and composition. Although metamorphosed up to greenschist grade, sedimentary and primary mineralogical details are still discernible. Above a <b>disconformable</b> contact with underlying Ordovician-Upper Cambrian (eugeoclinal) deep-marine passive margin rocks, the Permian section {{begins with a}} local basal sandy conglomerate (~ 33 m), followed by metacarbonate turbidites (62 m), then mostly covered noncalcareous metashales and metasiltstones (~ 393 m). Upsection, the mudstones become more calcareous (~ 152 m); several beds of metaarkose interrupt the upper ~ 64 m. An abrupt change to slightly tuffaceous metacalcarenite (~ 10 m) is followed by tu:ffaceous metasandstones with distinctly zoned plagioclase crystals that dominate {{the rest of the}} section (~ 297 m). Rare interbeds of quartz arenite occur ~ 15 m above the base of the tuffaceous metasandstones and interbeds of bioclastic metalimestone are present near the top below the andesite flows. Overall, exposures of Permian metasedimentary rocks in the measured section consist of 28 % argillite and siltstone, 5 % non-tuffaceous sandstone, 25 % tuffaceous sandstone, 5 % conglomerate, 21 % non-tuffaceous limestone, 3 % tuffaceous limestone, 3 % silicified limestone and partially recrystallized chert, 4 % hydrothermally altered rocks, and 6 % younger, less altered igneous intrusions of indeterminate age. Sandstone modal analysis suggests that the basin evolved from a tectonic setting involving compressive uplift (fold-thrust belt, collision suture, or subduction complex) or a transform-margin setting to an arc basin setting. The highly tuffaceous nature of the El Paso Mountains volcaniclastic rocks, their phenocryst assemblage (zoned plagioclase and amphibole), and common lathwork textures are most consistent with highly crystalline, intermediate (andesitic) volcanism...|$|E
40|$|The Upper Jurassic Morrison Formation {{intermittently}} crops {{out along}} the Colorado Front Range. Morrison Formation sediments are predominantly composed of gray mudrock intercalated with minor lithographic limestone and variegated fluvial deposits. Lacustrine sediments are volumetrically more important than previously reported. The uppermost Morrison consists of greenish-gray and variegated tuff. I have used the lowest stratigraphic occurrence of the massive tuff bed as a lithostratigraphic datum for facies correlation. Identification of this tuff bed allows the first regional correlation of Morrison rocks outside the Colorado Plateau. ^ Charophytes and ostracodes within Morrison lacustrine deposits indicate Morrison lakes were shallow, fresh bodies of water. Ubiquitous evidence of subaerial exposure within lacustrine sediments suggests lakes experienced frequent water level fluctuations. Previous studies on symmetrical ripples in New Mexico and southern Colorado indicate lakes may have been tens of miles across. ^ Previous geologic studies in the northern Denver Basin have determined that movement along basement fault blocks has controlled sedimentation patterns in rocks adjacent to the Morrison Formation. Thick Morrison sections above pre-Morrison paleo-highs suggests syndepositional subsidence has also affected Morrison sedimentation patterns. ^ Morrison Formation contacts are commonly ambiguous. Where Morrison lacustrine deposits overlie marine deposits the contact is clearly <b>disconformable.</b> Where Morrison fluvial deposits overlie Ralston Creek fluvial deposits the contact is enigmatic, and I have mapped both units in these areas as Morrison undifferentiated. ^ The upper Morrison contact with the Dakota Group is also difficult to delineate. Previous studies have suggested this contact represents a 30 Ma hiatus. Because the depositional environments and lithologies of the two formations are similar, there is no sharp contact, rather only a conformable sequence with minor disconformities. ^ Thin Upper Jurassic sections onlapping Precambrian rocks suggest the pre-Morrison depositional surface was not flat. As much as 100 feet of topographic relief may have been present between Precambrian highs and adjacent depositional basins. ...|$|E
40|$|The post-Oxfordian Morrison Formation {{is exposed}} along {{the margins of}} the Bighorn and Powder River basins of Wyoming and Montana and is present in the {{subsurface}} throughout both basins. The Morrison Formation lies conformably on the marine glauconitic litharenite of the uppermost Sundance (or Swift) Formation. The upper contact is <b>disconformable</b> wherever the Morrison Formation is directly overlain by the chert-pebble conglomerate unit of the basal Cloverly Formation. In most places the contact between the Morrison and the overlying Cloverly formations is a paraconformity;In the area studied, the Morrison Formation consists mainly of sandstone, siltstone, and variegated mudstone with occasional limestone. Studies have revealed different environments of deposition contrary to the earlier belief of a uniform fluvial environment. The sediments were deposited in a complex of eolian, transitional marine and fluvial environments. Along {{the southern part of the}} Bighorn Basin, the lower Morrison is represented by isolated lenses of thick massive to crossbedded quartzarenites of eolian origin. They represent the final phase of coastal deposition along the retreating margin of the Sundance Sea. Equivalent facies in the north-central part of the basin are olive green silty mudstones and fine grained well sorted, bioturbated quartzwackes of intertidal origin. The upper part of the Morrison Formation consists of sediments of fluvial origin. It is represented by an interbedded claystone and siltstone lithofacies and a channel sandstone lithofacies association. The interbedded siltstone and claystone lithofacies is of overbank origin and dominates the fluvial section of the Morrison Formation;Stratigraphic analysis suggests that positive structural elements were active within the central and north central parts of Wyoming during the Late Jurassic. Morrison Formation is thin and less sandy along paleotopographic highs and sandier along paleotopographic lows, which suggests an active structural control of facies distribution during deposition. The location of these positive elements coincides with the present day Laramide uplifts...|$|E
40|$|Bibliography: pages [145]- 149. The Eocene fluviatile Crazy Hollow Formation {{of central}} Utah is {{characterized}} regionally by its lithic variety, and is differentiated stratigraphically from its enclosing lacustrine rock units. The Crazy Hollow is mineralogically and stratigraphically {{equivalent to the}} informal "Tawny beds" found along the western Gunnison Plateau, and represents the full fluvial sequence found above the Green River and below various pyroclastic formations. The 3 my (near Salina) to 11 my (in western Gunnison Plateau) interval of deposition is determined by dates from the enclosing formations. The very rapid vertical and horizontal lithic changes in the unit distinguish it from other fluvial sequences in central Utah. It is like them in having feldspathic sandstone, but it is conspicuously different in having salt-and-pepper sandstone (of quartz and both black and gray chert). The Crazy Hollow extends northwest into Juab Valley with patchy exposures on the Gunnison Plateau, northeast to the southern Cedar Hills, southeast along the western Wasatch Plateau to northern Fish Lake Plateau, and southwest to the eastern Valley Mountains. A section near Aurora is suggested as a sup- plementary reference section because of its lithic variety, completeness and accessibility. The distinction between the Green River and Crazy Hollow is not sharp and clean, but can be defined by a color change from pale gray and green to red, an increase in clastic material or, locally, evidence of an erosional surface. The contact is locally <b>disconformable,</b> but in many instances the boundary is gradational—even with interfingering units. The depositional environment of the Crazy Hollow changed regionally from mixed-load streams in the southeast to alluvial deposition in the northwest, close to {{the margin of the}} Lake Uinta basin. The source of most of the Crazy Hollow sediment was the Laramide uplifts to the east—notably the Uncompahgre Uplift. Local, more siliceous clastic materials were derived from the eroding Sevier Orogenic Belt, along the west margin of the area and minor amounts of sediment were derived from reworked underlying sediments.

40|$|The Miura Peninsula {{consists}} of the late Cenozoic sedimentary sequence that is divided into the Hayama, Miura, Kazusa and Sagami Groups and Alluvial sediments. The respective units display an unconformable relationship, namely, a marked clino-unconformity between the Hayama and Miura Groups and a parallel unconformity between the Miura and Kazusa Group are characteristics in the peninsula. There are several sedimentary basins in which the Miura, Kazusa and Sagami Groups are distributed surrounding the Hayama Upheaval Belt around the peninsula. The succesive sequence of all the Miura, Kazusa and Sagami Groups is distributed trending east-west and dipping north, it constitutes the southern west wing of the Kanto Structural Basin {{in the northern part}} of the peninsula. The middle and southern parts of the peninsula are characterized by the folds of the Miura Group. The present study has as its objective to describe the stratigraphy and lithology of the Miura and Kazusa Groups and some units of the Sagami Group in the middle and northern parts of the peninsula. This study forms a link in the chain of the researches on the Cenozoic tectonics of the Miura Peninsula. The Miura Group, ranging in age from Late Miocene to Late Pliocene, is divided into two formations: the Zushi and Ikego Formations. The Zushi Formation includes Tagoegawa Sandstone and Conglomerate Member in the northern part, Shimoyamaguchi Sandstone and Conglomerate Member in the southern part, the respective members constitute a basal part of the formation. The Ikego Formation contains Takatoriyama Pyroclastics Member at the lower part. This member is newly named by the author in this study. It is pointed out that the pyroclastic materials were possibly derived from autochthonous materials exploded from a submarine volcano at the bathyal floor. The stratigraphic relation between the Zushi and Ikego Formations is wholly conformable but <b>disconformable</b> in a part, the later relation was caused by submarine erosion on the top of a small dome of the Zushi Formation. The Late Pliocene to Early Pleistocene Kazusa Group is divided into six formations which in ascending order are the Uragō, Nojima, Ōfuna, Koshiba, Nakazato and Tomioka Formations.

The Titiokura Formation is of early Pliocene (Opoitian-Waipipian) age, and unconformably overlies Mokonui Formation, which is a regressive late Miocene and early Pliocene (Kapitean to early Opoitian) succession. In the Te Waka Range and the southern parts of the Maungaharuru Range, the Titiokura Formation comprises a single limestone sheet 20 - 50 m thick, with calcareous sandstone parts. In the vicinity of Taraponui Trig, and to the northeast, the results of 1 : 50 000 mapping show that the limestone gradually partitions into five members, which thicken markedly to the northeast to total thicknesses of c. 730 m, and concomitantly become dominated by siliciclastic sandstone. The members (all new) from lower to upper are: Naumai Member, Te Rangi Member, Taraponui Member, Bellbird Bush Member, and Opouahi Member. The lower four members are inferred to each comprise an obliquity-controlled 41 000 yr 6 th order sequence, and the Opouahi Member at least two such sequences. The sequences typically have the following architectural elements from bottom to top: <b>disconformable</b> sequence boundary that formed as a transgressive surface of erosion; thin transgressive systems tracts (TSTs) with onlap and backlap shellbeds, or alternatively, a single compound shellbed; downlap surface; and very thick (70 - 200 m) highstand (HST) and regressive systems tracts (RST) composed of fine sandstone. The sequences in the Opouahi Member have cryptic TSTs, sandy siltstone to silty sandstone HSTs, and cross-bedded, differentially cemented, fine sandstone RSTs; a separate variant is an 11 m thick bioclastic limestone (grainstone and packstone) {{at the top of the}} member that crops out in the vicinity of Lake Opouahi. Lithostratigraphic correlations along the crest of the ranges suggest that the Titiokura Formation, and its correlatives to the south around Puketitiri, represent a shoreline-to-shelf linked depositional system. Carbonate production was focused around a rocky seascape as the system onlapped basement in the south, with dispersal and deposition of the comminuted carbonate on an inner shelf to the north, which was devoid of siliciclastic sediment input. The rates of both subsidence and siliciclastic sediment flux increased rapidly to the northeast of the carbonate "platform", with active progradation and offlap of the depositional system into more axial parts of Hawke's Bay Basin...|$|E
40|$|The present {{investigation}} examines {{the relationship between}} the Proterozoic Richtersveld and Bushmanland Subprovinces in the westernmost part of the Namaqua Province, near Eksteenfontein, Republic of South Africa. There is a controversy about this relationship because isotopic data contrast with field evidence. On a regional scale the Richtersveld Subprovince is separated from the Bushmanland Subprovince by the northward-dipping Groothoek Thrust. North of the thrust the Richtersveld Subprovince is comprised of low grade volcano/ plutonic rocks of the Vioolsdrif Terrane and medium grade volcano sedimentary sequences of the Pella Terrane. Medium grade rocks of the Steinkopf Terrane (Bushmanland Subprovince) lie immediately south of the thrust. Late Proterozoic strata of the Stinkfontein Formation (Gariep Group) overlie the Namaqua Province in the west; Cambrian Nama Group outliers occur east of the Stinkfontein Formation. Isotopic data show that lithologies of the Richtersveld Subprovince formed between 2000 - 1730 Ma, whereas those of the Bushmanland Subprovince are younger. It is not clear whether the Namaqua metamorphic imprint (at 1200 - 1100 Ma), which is manifest in terranes south of the Groothoek Thrust, extended as far as the Vioolsdrif Terrane in the north. Early Proterozoic structural and metamorphic imprints are inferred to have been obliterated during this event. The westernmost part of the Namaqua Province was overprinted for a distance of 100 km from the coast, during the Pan-African event at 700 Ma and 500 Ma. An area measuring nearly 500 km 2, traversing the western extremity of the boundary between the Richtersveld and Bushmanland Subprovinces was mapped on a scale of 1 : 36, 000. Field mapping was carried out with the aid of aerial photographs, whereas laboratory techniques included map compilation, structural analysis, X-ray diffractometry, geochemical (XRF) and electron microprobe analyses. Supracrustal units of the Richtersveld Subprovince are composed of quartzo-feldspathic gneisses, schists, and minor meta-pelites. Supracrustals of the Bushmanland Subprovince are less diverse than those of the Richtersveld Subprovince and have a <b>disconformable</b> relationship with them. Most intrusive rock-types are thick granitic sheets, except the Early Proterozoic Vioolsdrif Granodiorite which forms part of a batholithic pluton in the north. The Sabieboomrante adamellite gneiss, Kouefontein granite gneiss and Dabbieputs granite gneiss could not be correlated with lithologies commonly occurring in the Richtersveld and Bushmanland Subprovinces. They have been given the new rock names. Mafic and ultramafic rocks of the Klipbok complex occur along the strike of the Groothoek Thrust. They form part of the Richtersveld Subprovince...|$|E
40|$|The {{volcanic}} {{island of}} Milos Island, Greece, {{is a relatively}} small (- 151 km') but {{significant portion of the}} active Southern Aegean Volcanic Arc, Milos comprises an Upper Pliocene-Pleistocene, thick (up to 700 m), and compositionally and texturally diverse succession of calc-alkaline, volcanic and sedimentary rocks that record a transition from a relatively shallow but dominandy below-wave-base submarine setting to a subaerial one. The shallow marine part of the succession hosts several significant epithermal gold deposits. Twenty-two main submarine and twelve subaerial volcanic, sedimentary and intrusive facies have been identified, and arranged into eleven compositionally and texturally distinct facies associations. The principal volcanic facies are (1) coherent rhyolite, dacite, andesite, basaltic andesite Oavas, domes, cryptodomes, dykes and sills), and associated autedastic facies (autobreccia, hyalodastite and intrusive hyalodastite); (2) submarine and subaerial pyrodastic deposits; and (3) volcanogenic sedimentary facies. The volcanic and intrusive facies are interbedded with a sedimentary facies association comprising sandstone and/or fossiliferous mudstone mainly derived from erosion of preexisting volcanic deposits. The main facies associations are interpreted to have conformable, <b>disconformable,</b> and interfingering contacts, and there are no mappable angular unconformities or disconformities whhin the volcanic succession. The facies architecture indicates depositional environments evolved from below to above the wave base to subaerial in most areas, except at the southeastern sector of the island where more uniform subaerial environments dominated. The architecture of the dominantly felsic-intermediate volcanic succession reflects contrasts in eruption style) proximity to source, depositional environment and emplacement processes. The volcanic facies architecrure comprises interfingering proximal (near vent), medial (volcano flanks), and distal (volcano margin) facies associations related mainly to submarine and subaerial felsic cryptodome-pumice cone volcanoes, dacitic to basaltic andesite lava domes and pyroclastic cones. Submarine felsic cryptodome-pumice cone volcanoes are the most voluminous and common type of volcano identified. Submarine explosive eruptions from these centres generated pumiceous gravity-current deposits and thick beds of very coarse, water-settled pumice. In proximal sections, thick felsic pumice breccia intervals were intruded by compositionally similar, porphyritic, rhyolitic and New SHRIMP V-Pb data from four major volcanic facies, in combination with detailed mapping and facies analysis, have enabled construction of an enhanced, internally consistent time-stratigraphic framework for the evolution of Milos. The volcanic activity began at 2. 66 ± 0. 07 Ma and has been more or less continuous since then. Subaerial emergence probably occurred at 1. 44 ± 0. 08 Ma, in response to a combination of volcanic constructional processes and fault-controlled volcano-tectonic uplift. Recent phreatic craters are the youngest (200 Be- 200 AD) expressions of volcanism, and are spatially associated with an active, high-enthalpy geothermal field. The succession contains several significant epithermal, precious and base metal deposits that display a range of textural, mineralogical, and compositional characteristics. The majority of these epithermal ores occur within and at the top a single, submarine felsic cryptodome-pumice cone volcano near the stratigraphic base of the succession. The palaeogeography during mineralisation probably comprised scattered islands (volcanic domes) flanked by shallow-marine areas. A modern analogue for rhe setting of the epithermal- style mineralisation is the shallow submarine to subaerial volcanic complex of the island of Panarea, in the active Aeolian volcanic arc (Tyrrhenian Sea, Italy) ...|$|E
40|$|An {{extensive}} {{study of}} the stratigraphy of the Amuri Limestone Group (Upper Cretaceous Upper Eocene) and the enclosing units in East Marlborough has been undertaken. The study includes regional correlation of detailed measured sections in conjunction with lithofacies descriptions, micropaleontological age determinations, petrographic examination, and geochemical analysis. A revised New Zealand Paleogene time scale has been compiled {{to take into account}} recent major revisions of international Cenozoic geochronology. The Amuri Limestone Group (c. 660 m maximum thickness) incorporates 6 formations: Mead Hill Formation (mid Haumurian - lower Waipawan); Teredo Limestone (mid Waipawan late Mangaorapan); Lower Limestone (mid Waipawan – mid Mangaorapan); Lower Marl (upper Waipawan - lower Heretaungan); Middle Limestone (lower Mangaorapan - lower Bortonian); Upper Marl (upper Porangan - upper Runangan). The Mead Hill Formation is diachronous and conformable on the Upper Iwitahi Group which includes the Woolshed Formation (lower - upper Haumurian) and the overlying Claverley Sandstone (upper Haumurian). The Mead Hill Formation contains the Flaxbourne Limestone Member (mid Haumurian) and Lower Chert Member (late Haumurian). The Lower Limestone contains the Upper Chert Member (mid Waipawan). The Fells Greensand Member (mid Bortonian) and Grass Seed Volcanics Member (upper Bortonian) are both intercalated within the Middle Limestone and Upper Marl. With the exception of post-unconformity sandy facies, the Amuri Limestone consists of dcm-bedded, light greenish grey, well indurated, foraminiferal biomicritic calcilutites and poorly indurated, smectite-rich marls. Macrofossils are extremely rare. Cretaceous sequences are characterized by a poorly developed Planolites - Teichichnus ichnoassemblage; Paleogene facies are dominated by a Zoophycos - Planolites ichnoassemblage. Pelagic limestone deposition was initiated within a central NW-trending trough and spread outwards onto the adjacent near-horizontal platform. Subsidence of the trough is inferred to have been maintained by reactivation of basement faults. Water depths on the platform are likely to have been relatively shallow (inner shelf) during the Late Cretaceous but much deeper (outer shelf - bathyal) during the Paleocene and Eocene. Basin morphology was the major control on lateral facies variations. Platform sediments are characteristically more thinly bedded, and the thickness of individual Formations is correspondingly attenuated, in comparison with trough facies. Chert and dolomite are restricted to the lower parts of the trough facies. Basin-wide unconformities are recognized in the late Haumurian, mid Waipawan (sub-Teredo Limestone unconformity), mid Bortonian, and mid Whaingaroan. Although these breaks are <b>disconformable</b> in platform areas, they regionally account for large amounts of differential erosion. Submarine erosion, hardground formation, development of a Thallasinoides-dominated ichnofauna, glauconitization, phosphatization, and accumulation of a thin sandy facies are typical of unconformities outside the trough. Within the trough, the Haumurian and Waipawan breaks in deposition are represented by paraconformities or coevally deposited siliceous, pyritic mudstones. The subfeldsarenitic Claverley Sandstone was intra-basinally derived from submarine erosion and reworking of the underlying Woolshed Formation. The detrital sand fraction of the Teredo Limestone was derived from reworking of the locally exhumed Claverley Sandstone, and from remobilization at depth and submarine extrusion of that unit. An extra-basinal source (possibly reworked quartzose coal measures) for the redeposited supermature quartzarenitic Fells Greensand is likely. Pulses of (compressional?) tectonic activity immediately preceded and possibly continued during unconformity development. These tectonic events may provide an independent estimate of the timing of some of the major (Late Cretaceous - Cenozoic) plate tectonic events affecting the New Zealand region. The amount of dextral movement on two of the major Marlborough Faults has been estimated from offsets in lithofacies and isopach patterns. 5 - 10 km of transcurrent movement is recognized on the northern branch of the Hope Fault; 10 - 15 km of right-lateral slip has occurred on the Kekerengu Fault...|$|E
40|$|After the {{establishment}} of the N-S Andib-Ganamub trough, the ubiquitous Lower Nosib subarkose was succeeded in the west by the Upper Nosib greywacke which indicates that orthogeosynclinal subsidence was already active in pre-Damara times. A pulse of NNE folding (F₁N) concluded this sedinentary cycle and was accompanied by amphibolite-grade metamorphism (M₁), occasional migmatisation (A₁), and later feldspar blastesis. This episode was most intense in the west, so that the overlying Damara rocks paraconformable in the east, are unconformable there. Martin's (1965) separation of the succeeding Damara basin into a western eugeosyncline and an eastern miogeosyncline applies very well to this area, though the separating hinge-line appears to have been located farther to the west (± 80 Km) of the Kamanjab inlier, along the western flank of a N-S geanticlinal belt. The Lower Bakos semipelite and lenticular carbonate, thinning out against the eastern flank of this positive element controlling the deposition, may, prior to deformation, have created a transition between the western eugeosynclinal greywacke and the eastern miogeosynclinal Lower Otari carbonates. The fractured hinge-zone provided channels for the ascent of syndepositional intrusions and volcanics. Regional erosion following upwarping in the east caused a large influx of detritus into the Khomas furrow prior to the <b>disconformable</b> deposition of the Tillite Substage, which is the only reliable chronostratigraphic link between the base of the Upper Otavi and that of the Upper Bakos Series, the latter partially intertongueing with the succeeding Khomas Series. Gravitational creeping of the miogeosynclinal carbonates down the western slope of the upwarped Kamanjab inlier towards the sinking basin, produced the first folding (F₂O) in the east. Almost contemporaneously, buoyant uplifting forces, related to anatexis (A₂) along the axis of the eugeosyncline, created slopes sufficient to convey nappes (F₂S) of scarcely metamorphosed Damara schists towards the eastern foreland, overriding the miogeosyncline along the N-S Sesfontein Thrust. Eastern foredeeps were rapidly filled by the Mulden molasse. Steep slip folding (F₂S and F₄) in the cores and roots, and the formation of scattered domes at depth, controlled the successive structural evolution of the nappes. Large-scale axial undulations were later produced by orthogonally superposed F₃ folds striking east. The Damaran metamorphism (M₂), which outlasted deformation, has a Barrovian character and grades in the Damara sediments from amphibolite (sillimanite) grade in the west to greenschist (sericite- chlorite) grade in the east. In the previously dehydrated, deformed and metamorphosed, polymetamorphic (M₁/M₂) Nosib terrains, retrograde parageneses and transition granulites developed to the east and {{to the west of the}} Damaran hornblende-oligoclase isograd respectively. The Damaran tectono-thermal episode culminated in advanced migmatisation of the Khomas greywacke (possibly equivalent to the Salem granite-gneiss) and final anatexis (A₂) in the late-kinematic Ganias -Uhima (possibly equivalent to the Donkerhoek) granite, followed by widespread feldspar blastesis. The drop in rheomorphism in the deformed mass at the margin of the migmatite zone induced intense shearing and produced belts of mylonite and cataclastic gneiss. At a later stage, the Sesfontein Thrust was buffered against the Otavi dolomite relief and its speed of advancement reduced to match that of the erosion of its frontal toe, which now separates two completely different structural-stratigraphic domains: i) an eastern miogeosynclinal, feebly metamorphosed and volcanic-free domain (Damara System, Outjo Facies) deformed into non-basement-involving tectonites, overridden by ii) a western domain of suprastructural nappes and metamorphosed eugeosynclinal sediments (Damara System, Swakop Facies) deformed in response to basementinvolving tectonic processes promoted by deeply seated anatexis along the axis of the former eugeosyncline. The present model involves many stratigraphic revisions, one of the most important being that no rocks older than the Nosib Formation outcrop in the area and possibly along most of the Damara mobile belt in the western Kaokoveld...|$|E
40|$|I. Glacigenic {{deposits}} in the Death Valley region occur within the Neoproterozoic Kingston Peak Formation. In the Panamint Range, immediately west of Death Valley, these strata are ≥ 1000 m thick and are continuously exposed for nearly 100 km along the strike of the range. Although these strata are variably metamorphosed and locally exhibit pronounced ductile strain, original sedimentary textures are well preserved throughout the range. Diamictic strata occur in two distinct intervals, a lower one comprising the Limekiln Spring and Surprise Members, and an upper one {{known as the}} Wildrose Sub-member of the South Park Member. Each of these intervals are succeeded by well defined cap carbonates, which, from oldest to youngest, are the Sourdough Member of the Kingston Peak and the Sentinel Peak Member of the overlying Noonday Formation. Between the two glacial successions, the Sourdough and sub-Wildrose South Park units comprise a 300 m thick interglacial succession that includes platform carbonate deposition. Sparse lonestones and striated clasts, along with the impressive lateral continuity of diamictic units, support a glacial origin. Chemostratigraphic profiles of δ 13 C through the Sourdough (- 3 ‰ to + 2 ‰, increasing upward) and Sentinel Peak (- 3 ‰ +/- 1 ‰) suggest correlation with the Sturtian and Marinoan caps, respectively. Potentially economic U deposits (secondary brannerite) occur in graphitic schists of the Limekiln Spring Member and sub-economic U and Th (hosted by detrital monazite) occur within quartz-pebble conglomerates in the South Park Member. The strata contain no fossils, radiometric age control, or primary magnetizations. II. The Neoproterozoic-Cambrian succession in the Death Valley region of SW Laurentia is among the best exposed and easily accessible in the world, and comprises {{one of the most}} complete sections in Laurentia. The largest single exposure of these strata occurs in the Panamint Range on the west flank of Death Valley, but this area has received little attention in comparison to numerous exposures to the east of Death Valley, primarily because of structural complexity and metamorphism. The eastern strata, although unmetamorphosed, occur in isolated fault-bounded exposures and are relatively thin and incomplete compared to the Panamint stratigraphy. These factors, combined with a lack of fossil or radiometric age control, has hindered confident regional correlation, as well as placement in the context of hallmark Neoproterozoic events observed in the South Australian, Namibian and other successions around the globe. New geological mapping, measured sections and high-resolution C-isotope data reported here from the Noonday Formation in the Panamint Range delineate its regional stratigraphic architecture and establish its age through correlation with section with radiometric age control. Carbon isotopic trends in the Panamint Range match to within 1 - 2 ‰ reproducibility previous results obtained for correlative strata in the eastern sections, indicating that metamorphism did not significantly alter C isotopic ratios. The combined lithostratigraphic and chemostratigraphic data form the basis for a revised, more complete stratigraphic framework for the Noonday Formation. A composite section shows that, where most complete, the Noonday consists of three members, from the base upward, the Sentinel Peak, Radcliff, and Mahogany Flats members. New mapping and chemostratigraphic data permit robust regional correlation of a thin dolostone marker horizon {{at the base of the}} Noonday in the Panamint Range as little as 2 m thick (Sentinel Peak Member) with a tube-bearing microbial dolostone in the eastern Death Valley region more than 200 m thick. The data also reveal that the Radcliff Member is bounded by <b>disconformable</b> surfaces and their correlative conformities. These surfaces are recognizable throughout the region and are used to construct a regionally unified stratigraphic nomenclature. A key finding of this study is the construction of a chemostratigraphic profile spanning most of Noonday time. This was greatly aided by the discovery of carbonatebearing strata in the lower part of the Radcliff Member in the Tucki Mountain area of the Panamints, and relating their stratigraphic position to upper Radcliff and younger Noonday strata in the Wildrose Canyon area. The chemostratigraphic profile is a remarkable match for the Maiberg cap carbonate sequence in Namibia, including the decline to a minimum at - 5 ‰, a recovery to near 0 ‰, and then subsequent decline to - 2 ‰. Globally, profiles through many post-Marinoan sequences are either too condensed or lack sufficient carbonate to record these features, including the sections in the eastern Death Valley region. (Halverson et al. 2005). As such, the Panamint profiles represent the first relatively complete record of the post-Marinoan C-isotopic recovery outside of southern Africa. Correlation of these curves (1) firmly places the Noonday at the base of the Ediacaran Period, (2) indicates deposition of 200 m of Sentinel Peak and Radcliff strata occurred between 635 and 632 Ma, (3) supports the hypothesis that the Wildrose Diamictite of the Kingston Peak Formation, which lies in sharp contact below the Sentinel Peak Member, represents at least part of the Marinoan glacial interval; (4) helps identify correlative cap carbonate sequences in key Laurentian sections, which include the Ravensthroat Formation in the MacKenzie Mountains, dolostones capping the upper diamictite of the Pocatello Formation in eastern Idaho, and the middle part of the Mina el Mezquite Formation in Sonora. The Noonday C-isotopic profile confirms that the details of relatively rapid, complex variations in ocean chemistry observed in basal Ediacaran strata in Namibia are globally reproducible. III. The Kingston Peak Formation in the Panamint Range represents the stratigraphically most complete section of Cryogenian strata along the SW margin of Laurentia. Two glacigenic diamictites and their associated cap carbonates, the older Surprise Member and Sourdough Member and the younger Wildrose Member and Noonday Formation (Sentinel Peak Member), provide timing constraints to bracket the inter-glacial succession to between ca. 713 Ma and 635 Ma, the ages of inferred correlative glacial cap carbonate rocks dated elsewhere. This timing constraint is further strengthened by the presence of a sharp decline in C isotopes in the Thorndike Member, which occurs immediately beneath the Wildrose Member; this decline is readily correlated with the global Trezona anomaly. Within the inter-glacial succession, new mapping in the northern Panamints has documented the presence of a previously unrecognised suite of coarse sedimentary rocks herein defined as the Argenta Member of the Kingston Peak Formation. The Argenta consists largely of poorly-sorted breccias and conglomerates containing an assemblage of gravel-sized clasts dominated by granitic gneiss, schist, feldspar augens, vein quartz and quartzite fragments, and locally carbonate rocks. These compositions indicate derivation from a basement provenance and record deposition in alluvial-fan to coarse-braided fluvial settings; their textural and compositional immaturity implies relatively short distances of transport. Mapping shows that the Argenta defines wedge-shaped packages as much as 200 m thick and that the base of the Argenta is a significant angular unconformity. Combined, these features are evidence that deposition occurred during a phase of extensional tectonism interpreted as recording the initial dismemberment of the Rodinia supercontinent. Best estimates place the timing of this tectonism at ca. 650 – 700 Ma. ...|$|E

The underlying, 625 -rn thick upper member of the McIntosh Formation (as mapped by Wells, 1981) is composed of two units: a basal 130 -m thick prograding offshore to marginal marine coal-bearing, lithic-arkosic sandstone facies succession (upper McIntosh sandstone) and a thicker, 500 - m thick bathyal foraminilera-rich siltstone facies that is, in part, in fault contact with the overlying Cowlitz Formation. The lower member of the McIntosh Formation is 375 rn thick in Stillwater Creek, with the base not exposed in the study area. The Cowlitz Formation is subdivided into five informal units. The basal 558 -m thick unit consists of (1) multiple prograding, wave-dominated shoreface hummocky stratified lithic arkosic sandstone successions (unit 1 A) that comprise several thickeningand coarsening-upwards parasequences and (2) coal-bearing delta plain facies associations (unit 1 B). The 205 -m thick second unit is composed of five coarsening-up stormdominated, hummocky-bedded shelf to delta-front arkosic sandstone parasequences. Fining-upwards subtidal, intertidal, and supratidal facies associations constitute the 170 -m thick third member. Tidal-estuarine facies in unit 3 include: (1) nested subtidal micaceous lithic-arkosic sandstone channels, (2) cross-bedded subtidal sandstone ridges with brackish water mollusc hash, (3) sandy and muddy accretionary-bank, and (4) coalbearing marsh-swamp deposits. Thin basaltic volcaniclastic interbeds occur within units one, two, and three. A 155 -m thick fourth unit, consists of wave-dominated, arkosic sandstone, shoreface to offshore bioturbated mudstone facies successions; these successions form 10 coarsening-upward parasequences that overall define a retrogradational parasequence set. Thick, transgressive, bioturbated outer shelfal molluscbearing sandy siltstone and glauconitic mudstone in the Big Bend type locality along the Cowlitz River can be correlated to this unit in the type section in Olequa Creek. The uppermost unit consists of 150 m of deeper marine laminated siltstone, subordinate finegrained and thin-bedded turbidites, thick amalgamated submarine-channel sandstone and chaotic mudstone conglomerate, and slump-folded and soft-sediment deformed laminated siltstone intervals. Petrography of lithic-arkosic micaceous sandstones of the McIntosh and Cowlitz formations indicates there was a distant eastern, extrabasinal acid plutonic-metamorphic source for the arkosic component of these sandstones. The predominant quartz, feldspar, and mica constituents of Cowlitz Formation were transported from a distant dissected arc (such as the Idaho Batholith and metamorphic core complexes to the east) through an ancestral Columbia River drainage system. A second, local and active intrabasinal basaltic source (Grays River volcanics) supplied basaltic scoria and lava rock fragments to form volcaniclastic interbeds. Some volcaniclastics were reworked and mixed with the arkosic extrabasinal sediments in the shallow marine and nonmarine environments of units 2 and 3 of the Cowlitz Formation. Explosive calc-alkaline volcanic activity (Northcraft Formation or Goble Volcanics) is also evident in the silicic and pumiceous tuff beds interbedded with coal marsh/swamp strata in units 1 and 3. Paleocurrent directions indicated by crossbedded tidal strata of unit 3 are to the north-northwest and south-southeast as a resultof shore parallel transport and deflection around a proposed growing volcanic edifice of Grays River volcanics {{to the south and}} southwest. A very high sedimentation rate of 1. 6 m/ 1, 000 years was calculated for {{the upper part of the}} Cowlitz Formation (units 3 to 5) using thickness measurement and 39 Ar/ 40 Ar age dates from the Cowlitz Formation (i. e., from tuff in unit 3) and the easternmost locality in the unconformably overlying Grays River volcanics at Bebe Mountain. The large influx of sediment deposited over a relatively short time period was accommodated by this rapidly subsiding forearc basin. In this study area, subaerial flows of the Grays River volcanics locally unconformably overlie the Cowlitz Formation. A 38. 9 ± 0. 1 Ma 39 Ar/ 40 Ar age date from a tuff bed in unit 3 of the underlying Cowlitz Formation (Irving et al., 1996) and three 39 Ar/ 40 Ar age dates of 38. 640. 40 (south Abernathy Mtn.), 37. 44 ± 0. 45 (west Bebe Mtn.), and 36. 85 ± 0. 46 Ma (east Bebe Mtn.) from the overlying Grays River volcanics bracket the timing of this regional unconformity. Additionally, field mapping (this study) and drill hole data supplied by Weyerhaeuser Company (Pauli, written communications) show there is a valley-fill unit at the base of the Grays River volcanics exposed on the surface and in the subsurface, respectively. These data confirm the volcanic- and tectonically-controlled unconformable relationship of the Cowlitz Formation to the overlying the Grays River volcanics. The Cowlitz Formation is in <b>disconformable</b> contact (a tectonically forced sequence boundary) with an overlying second, younger lowstand valley-fill unit (Toutle Formation unit A) recognized in this study along Olequa Creek. The 265 -m thick, newly discovered, Toutle Formation in this area is subdivided into three informal units: (1) a basal incised, non-marine valley-fill sequence (unit A), (2) a marginal marine (estuarine or nearshore) sequence (unit B), and (3) an upper fluvial sequence (unit C). A 31. 9 ± 0. 4 Ma 39 Ar/ 40 Ar date from a homblende-bearing pumiceous lapilli tuff in unit A indicates that the Toutle Formation is a time equivalent of the upper fluvial member of the Oligocene type Toutle Formation and the middle part of the Lincoln Creek Formation far from the center of the forearc basin to the west. Unit C of the Toutle Formation grades upward into the overlying deeper marine tuffaceous siltstone of the Lincoln Creek Formation. Deformation in this area resulted from two plate tectonic events: (1) latest middle Eocene highly oblique subduction that resulted in short-lived, normal faulting and intrusion of Grays River basalt dikes along small faults and (2) rapid post mid-Miocene oblique subduction that formed northeast-trending dextral and northwest-trending sinistral conjugate faults and broad regional compressional folding throughout southwest Washington. The broad open Arkansas anticline that trends northwest-southeast between Bebe and Abernathy mountains is an eastward extension of the Willapa Hills basement uplift to the west and is extensively cut by northeast and northwest trending faults (Plate I). This compressional event deformed both the Cowlitz Formation and the overlying Grays River volcanics. A similar structural pattern recognized in regional field mapping by Wells (1981) indicates this folding event also deformed mid-Miocene volcanic and sedimentary unit (i. e., Astoria Formation and Columbia River basalts). Reservoir quality of the Cowlitz and upper McIntosh formations micaceous lithicarkosic sandstones is good. These sandstones are clean, highly friable and porous except where carbonate and smectite clay rim cements formed in the lithic arkose. Unit 5 siltstone could act as a cap rock in the subsurface and the 1 - to 10 -rn thick coals could be a source for natural gas. The McIntosh marine siltstone is another possible source for gas and the micaceous arkosic sandstone in the upper McIntosh is a potential reservoir. Stratigraphic pinchouts and normal and wrench fault traps are similar to the Mist gas field of northwest Oregon...|$|E
