5|$|While the Allied armies {{continued}} their slow eastward drive between September and November 1944, the Germans {{prepared for a}} counteroffensive. Adolf Hitler, the German leader, believed that by launching an offensive in the West he could force the United States and Great Britain to an early peace, and thereby transfer {{the entirety of the}} Wehrmacht to the Eastern Front, where <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>bring</b> the Soviet offensive to a standstill and defeat it.|$|E
5|$|Several {{weeks after}} the {{departure}} of those assistants, reports began to surface that O'Brien had interviewed for the Houston Texans' head coaching position to replace Gary Kubiak, who was fired late in the season. Subsequently, the two sides were reported to be negotiating a contract, and on January 3, 2014, the Texans {{held a press conference}} announcing O'Brien as their new head coach. Assistant head coach and wide receivers coach Stan Hixon, safeties coach Anthony Midget, defensive coordinator John Butler, running backs coach Charles London, and strength coach Craig Fitzgerald submitted resignations on January 6, and most were expected to follow O'Brien to the NFL, leaving only offensive line coach Mac McWhorter, who was 63 years old and came out of retirement to coach at Penn State, defensive line coach Larry Johnson, a long-time member of the staff, and tight ends coach John Strollo, as assistant coaches on the staff, and thus making Penn State more attractive of a coaching position to a new coach, as <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>bring</b> in his own staff.|$|E
5|$|Veronica {{talks to}} Sean Friedrich {{and tells him}} about the girl-on-girl event and that Dick and Beaver took her over to a bed and argued about who should have sex with her. Veronica talks to Dick, who {{presents}} a different account of events, saying that he didn't drug her and that he found Beaver with Veronica already. Veronica approaches Beaver, who gives a set of events more {{similar to that of}} Sean. However, after Dick and Sean leave, he purports to have run away and vomited before <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>bring</b> himself to rape her. Keith says that he has to leave for an engagement in Vegas. Logan talks to Aaron, but Aaron does not even know Logan's birth date. Veronica talks to Carrie Bishop (Leighton Meester), who says that she saw Veronica having sex with Duncan. Veronica confronts Duncan, who denies the rape accusations and remembers comforting Veronica in her drugged state. Duncan says that the sex was consensual even though he knew that they were siblings, confirming Veronica's fears. Veronica talks to Wallace about the events but says that she is content with the answers she has. Keith calls a prostitute in Vegas for an unknown reason, while Veronica apologizes to Logan and tells her about the situation with Duncan. Back in Vegas, Keith talks to the prostitute, Cheyenne, about Abel Koontz, as Cheyenne and Koontz were together at the time of Lilly's murder. Veronica and Logan go into his darkened house before they realize that Aaron throws a surprise party for him, meaning that virtually the entire high school knows that they are dating.|$|E

25|$|Rather than tackle {{literature}} {{the same}} way, Loevy chose instead to adapt major literary works to {{the medium of}} television.

25|$|On 19 February 1801, {{about six}} {{miles east of}} Gibraltar, Phoebe sighted a French ship off Ceuta, also sailing eastwards.

After about two hours the French vessel struck her colours; she had five feet of water in her hold and was almost a wreck.

25|$|With 1,300 {{soldiers}} Peyri {{returned to}} Figueres and fortified the town. However, his force {{was too weak}} to interfere with Rovira as he brought more miquelets into Sant Ferran. Rovira appointed Brigadier General Juan Antonio Martínez to command the fortress which was manned by 3,000 miquelets within a week of its capture. Before <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>bring</b> help to Peyri, d'Hilliers had to call in several small garrisons. He also worried about a Royal Navy threat to the port of Roses. After a week passed, d'Hilliers raked up 2,000 reinforcements and brought them to Figueres. Meanwhile, General of Division François Jean Baptiste Quesnel arrived from France with three regular battalions and the National Guard battalions of Haute-Garonne and Gers. With 6,500 infantry and 500 cavalry available, d'Hilliers imposed a blockade on Sant Ferran on 17 April.|$|E

Emma returns home and gives them a big hug and calls them mom and dad for the second time. Mary Margaret and David tell her that they are naming their new son Prince Neal in honor of Emma's first love and Gold's son who saved them all from Zelena. That evening, Hook tells Emma that he traded the Jolly Roger for a magic bean so <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>bring</b> her back to Storybrooke. Realizing this is the ultimate expression of Hook's feelings, Emma finally gives him a passionate kiss. Also that night, Gold and Belle are officially married, watched over by Belle's father Moe French and ordained minister Archie Hopper.|$|E
25|$|Later Krishna told Arjuna how <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>bring</b> down Bhishma, {{through the}} help of Sikhandhi. The Pandavas were {{initially}} not agreeable to such a ploy, as by using such cheap tactics {{they would not be}} following the path of Dharma, but Krishna suggested a clever alternative. And thus, on the next day, the tenth day of battle Shikhandi accompanied Arjuna on the latter's chariot and they faced Bhishma who put his bow and arrows down. He was then felled in battle by Arjuna, pierced by innumerable arrows. Using Sikhandhi as a shield, Arjuna shot arrows at Bhishma, piercing his entire body. Thus, as was preordained (Mahadeva's boon to Amba that she would be the cause of Bhishma's death) Shikhandi, that is, Amba reincarnated was the cause of Bhishma's fall. As Bhishma fell, his whole body was held above the ground by the shafts of Arjuna's arrows which protruded from his back, and through his arms and legs. Seeing Bhishma lying on such a bed of arrows humbled even the gods who watched from the heavens in reverence. They silently blessed the mighty warrior. When the young princes of both armies gathered around him, inquiring if there was anything they could do, he told them that while his body lay on the bed of arrows above the ground, his head hung unsupported. Hearing this, many of the princes, both Kaurava and the Pandava alike brought him pillows of silk and velvet, but he refused them. He asked Arjuna to give him a pillow fit for a warrior. Arjuna then removed three arrows from his quiver and placed them underneath Bhishma's head, the pointed arrow tips facing upwards. To quench the war veteran's thirst, Arjuna shot an arrow into the earth, and a jet stream of water rose up and into Bhishma's mouth. It is said that Ganga herself rose to quench her son's thirst.|$|E
500|$|Truman {{emulated}} this {{by flying}} to the Pacific to meet MacArthur. Initially, Truman was unenthusiastic about the idea, as he disliked publicity stunts, but in October 1950, {{in the wake}} of the victories at Pusan and Inchon, MacArthur's star was burning bright. By meeting with him, Truman could emphasize his own part in the victories, as Commander-in-Chief. A message was sent to MacArthur suggesting a meeting on Hawaii or Wake Island. MacArthur replied that he [...] "would be delighted to meet the President on the morning of the 15th at Wake Island." [...] When MacArthur discovered that the President would be bringing the news media with him, MacArthur asked if <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>bring</b> correspondents from Tokyo. His request was denied.|$|E

500|$|He recalled, [...] "I {{read the}} script for Mad Men and I loved it. I never thought they'd cast me—- I mean, I thought they'd go {{with one of the}} five guys who look like me but are movie stars". He {{believes}} that an actor with a [...] "proven track record" [...] would likely have been chosen if another network had broadcast the show. He went through numerous auditions; each time he explained to the casting directors what <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>bring</b> to the character, if given the part. Alan Taylor and Mad Men creator Matthew Weiner initially thought Hamm was too handsome for the role but ultimately decided, [...] "it was perfect to cast sort of the perfect male in this part". Weiner also sensed that the actor had suffered early loss of his parents, which was similar to Draper's backstory.|$|E
500|$|Wolseley {{sailed to}} the Mediterranean in May 1793, joining Hood's fleet then blockading Toulon. She joined a flying {{squadron}} under Commodore Robert Linzee {{to act against}} French forces in the Mediterranean. On 30 September 1793, Commodore Robert Linzee took his squadron, including Lowestoffe, into the Gulf of San Fiorenzo to attack the [...] redoubt of Forneilli on Corsica. [...] Lowestoffe fired two broadsides at a tower at Mortella Point that protected the deep entrance to the gulf. [...] The fire caused the tower's French defenders to abandon the tower and its three guns, allowing a landing party from Lowestoffe {{under the command of}} Lieutenants Francis Annesley and John Gibb to capture the tower. Linzee, however, delayed his assault on the city until <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>bring</b> his larger ships into action. These larger ships bombarded the town from 1 October, but sustained considerable damage from the garrison, which forced Linzee to withdraw.|$|E
500|$|To detectives from Idaho, Utah and Colorado, Bundy {{confessed to}} {{numerous}} additional homicides, including several that police had been unaware of. He explained that in Utah <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>bring</b> his victims {{back to his}} apartment, [...] "where he could reenact scenarios depicted {{on the covers of}} detective magazines." [...] A new ulterior strategy quickly became apparent: He withheld many details, hoping to parlay the incomplete information into yet another stay of execution. [...] "There are other buried remains in Colorado", he admitted, but refused to elaborate. The new strategy—immediately dubbed [...] "Ted's bones-for-time scheme"—served only to deepen the resolve of authorities to see Bundy executed on schedule, and yielded little new detailed information. In cases where he did give details, nothing was found. Colorado detective Matt Lindvall interpreted this as a conflict between his desire to postpone his execution by divulging information and his need to remain in [...] "total possession—the only person who knew his victims' true resting places." ...|$|E

500|$|Dupotet {{attempted}} {{to throw off}} Amethysts pursuit during the night by turning westwards once more, but Seymour anticipated this manoeuvre and turned his ship westwards as well, discovering Niémen {{only a few miles}} ahead at 21:40. Rapidly gaining on the French ship, Seymour began firing his bow-chasers, small guns situated in the bows of the frigate, in an attempt to damage her rigging so that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>bring</b> his broadsides to bear. Dupotet responded with his stern-chasers, but by 01:00 on 6 April it was clear that Amethyst was going to catch the French frigate. The pursuit had been exhausting: since first sighting the British ships, Niémen had travelled over [...] and was just [...] from the Spanish coast when she was caught. At 01:15, Amethyst opened fire, Niémen immediately responding and turning to the northeast in an attempt to shake off the British ship. Seymour followed his opponent and at 01:45 was again close enough to engage, the frigates firing upon one another from close range for over an hour.|$|E
500|$|Guests were {{expected}} to dress to high standards, with men wearing evening suits and the women wearing [...] "gowns with silk gloves reaching the elbow". All women in full evening dress received an orchid or gardenia corsage, compliments of the Stork Club. A requirement for all men was a necktie; {{those who were not}} wearing one were either lent one or had to buy one to gain admittance. Although African Americans were not explicitly barred from entry, there was a mutual understanding that they were not welcome. Billingsley insisted on orderly conduct for all of his Stork Club guests; fighting, drunkenness, or rowdiness were prohibited. He ran the club on the principle of it being a place where people could have a good time and that it was somewhere <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>bring</b> his own family without worrying that they would see or hear something he did not want them to. Billingsley closely controlled the seating placement system in the club. Unescorted women were not allowed to enter the club after 6:00 p.m; this was a protective measure for men who may have been out with someone other than their wives.|$|E

[...] Beyond that, he and British Admiral George Brydges Rodney avoided significant engagement. De Grasse arrived at Cap-Français on July 16, where the Concorde awaited him. [...] He immediately engaged in negotiations with the Spanish. [...] He informed them of his intent to sail north, but promised to return by November to assist in Spanish operations in exchange for critical Spanish cover while he sailed north. [...] From them he secured the promise to protect French commerce and territories so that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>bring</b> north his entire fleet, 28 ships of the line. [...] In addition to his fleet, he took on 3,500 troops {{under the command of}} the Marquis de St. Simon, and appealed to the Spanish in Havana for funds needed to pay Rochambeau's troops. [...] On July 28, he sent the Concorde back to Newport, informing Washington, Rochambeau, and de Barras that he expected to arrive in the Chesapeake at the end of August, and would need to leave by mid-October. [...] He sailed from Cap-Français on August 5, beginning a deliberately slow route north through a little-used channel in the Bahamas.|$|E
