40|$|With {{a growing}} number of aged {{buildings}} which need to undergo <b>maintenance</b> <b>works</b> in Hong Kong, disputes concerning building <b>maintenance</b> <b>works</b> has become increasingly common in recent years. There have been contentions that bid-rigging activities involved during the tendering process of these projects. Bid-rigging in building <b>maintenance</b> <b>works</b> is a social problem as all buildings will become aged and required to carry out building <b>maintenance</b> <b>works.</b> It is illegal and harmful to the society as the affected group of people would be extensively covering all types of occupants in terms of cost and living environment. In the event that bid-rigging arises during tendering process of the building <b>maintenance</b> <b>works,</b> flat owners not only have to pay additional amount of money out of the exorbitant building maintenance cost, but they have to bear the risk of works which cannot be properly done. In addition, it implies various parties have participated in the tendering process enabling the building consultants or building contractors to win the maintenance contract fraudulently. Such incidents also reflected that there may be grey areas in legislation which enhances the emergence of bid-rigging in building <b>maintenance</b> <b>works.</b> Although there are various kinds of supporting schemes from the government and related organizations to assist building owners to carry out <b>maintenance</b> <b>works,</b> the effectiveness of the schemes remain unknown regarding the increasing disputes arise from building <b>maintenance</b> <b>works</b> and bid-rigging. The study would have a deeper understanding for the causes and effects of bid-rigging in relation to building <b>maintenance</b> <b>works</b> in terms of building condition, assistance and policies provided by the government and relevant organizations to assist building owners in Hong Kong. These include technical and financial assistance on building <b>maintenance</b> <b>works,</b> education for prevention and detection of infraction in collusive behavior, and legislation and prosecution on alleged crimes. In the final part, recommendations would be made to avoid bid-rigging in building <b>maintenance</b> <b>works.</b> The goals of the study is to identify the cause of the problem of bid-rigging in building <b>maintenance</b> <b>works</b> in Hong Kong and make possible suggestions to prevent the bid-rigging in building <b>maintenance</b> <b>works.</b> published_or_final_versionHousing ManagementMasterMaster of Housing Managemen...|$|R

Currently {{urban road}} works {{has changed from}} new constructions to conservations, but unlike {{municipalities}} with rich resources, most road <b>maintenance</b> <b>works</b> of most townships are done by a few engineers, manually and complicated, affecting the quality and progress of road <b>maintenance</b> <b>works.</b> To this end, this study uses pavement maintenance management system, replacing parts of the manual tasks, and a standard with objective data to decide the appropriate range and conservation engineering methods, in order of increasing the efficiency. This study, based on relevant literature, and investigates road <b>maintenance</b> <b>work</b> of townships, and develops an overall system with framework and modules, with expert questionnaires verify demands for conservation officers, restructuring and strengthening the database, and establish an urban road pavement maintenance management system.
