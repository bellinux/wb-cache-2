5|$|Smith {{signed for}} Stoke City in September 1966 after telling manager Tony Waddington {{that he was}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>sign</b> a {{contract}} at another club; though Waddington was not keen on Smith's hard-tackling style, {{he did not want}} to lose the young player. At the age of 18 he faced Leeds United's FWA Footballer of the Year Bobby Collins in a reserve match, and despite Collins going as far as to punch him in the face Smith managed to last the entire match without backing down in an extremely physical contest. However, for a period Waddington banned Smith from playing against first-team players in training as he feared Smith would injure one of his players. He made his first-team debut in the Football League against Arsenal in September 1968, and was given the task of man-marking Bobby Gould. He gave away a penalty after fouling Jon Sammels, which Terry Neill converted for the only goal of the match, but otherwise made a solid debut. However, in his second appearance he gave away two penalties in a 3–1 defeat away to Ipswich Town, and had to wait five months for another first-team appearance. In March 1969, Alan Bloor picked up a knock and Smith returned to the starting line-up in a 5–1 defeat to Leeds, failing in his task to man mark Mick Jones, who claimed a hat-trick. Despite the poor start to his senior career, he managed to finish the 1968–69 season with 14 First Division appearances to his name, and was occasionally used as an emergency striker.|$|E
25|$|Ferguson {{made only}} one close-season signing, paying Blackburn £1.2million for David May. There were {{newspaper}} reports that Ferguson was also <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>sign</b> highly rated 21-year-old striker Chris Sutton from Norwich City, but the player headed for Blackburn instead.|$|E
25|$|Clarett also {{expressed}} interest in playing for NFL Europe. Josh Luchs, Clarett's agent, reported that Clarett was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>sign</b> with the NFL on January 2, 2006, and {{was expected to be}} allocated to NFL Europe. There were also discussions about Clarett playing for the semi-pro Eastern Indoor Football League team the Mahoning Valley Hitmen, coached by the same Jim Terry.|$|E

25|$|At {{the time}} Steven Wilson was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>sign</b> to the Delerium label, {{he owned a}} lot of {{material}} recorded during the mid- and later '80s that he had recorded subsequently on three demo tapes - Tarquin's Seaweed Farm, Love, Death & Mussolini and The Nostalgia Factory. He sent copies of those tapes to people he felt would be interested in the recordings, asking them to spread the word. Delerium originally intended to release all of that material in a double debut album, but Wilson decided to just pick the songs he considered the best ones. These songs were mastered to make Porcupine Tree's first studio album, On the Sunday of Life... (1991); all of the leftover tracks would be later released on a compilation album called Yellow Hedgerow Dreamscape (1994).|$|E
25|$|Before the event, Jeff Jarrett {{was on his}} way out of the company, as {{management}} felt he {{had been}} a bad investment for the company. Vince McMahon, the WWF Chairman, came up with the idea for Jarrett and Chyna to become involved in a storyline together. Vince Russo was asked to write the storyline leading up to the match, including when Jarrett would taunt Chyna and hit her with random household objects. The fans responded positively to the battle-of-the-sexes match-ups. They were originally supposed to have their match-up at Rebellion, but the WWF extended the storyline for another month due to its popularity. In the midst of the feud, Russo left the WWF for rival promotion World Championship Wrestling (WCW). In her autobiography If They Only Knew, Chyna implies that Russo was the person who convinced McMahon to delay their pay-per-view match for a month, because he knew Jarrett was also <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>sign</b> with WCW. Because of the delay, Jarrett's contract expired the day before the match, so he was not contractually required to wrestle at the event. Hours before the event began, Jarrett demanded (and received) somewhere between $300,000–500,000 to wrestle Chyna for the night.|$|E
500|$|On 15 February, gunshots {{could be}} heard in the streets of Mingora, but Yousafzai's father {{reassured}} her, saying [...] "Don't be scared – this is firing for peace." [...] Her father had read in the newspaper that the government and the militants were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>sign</b> a peace deal the next day. Later that night, when the Taliban announced the peace deal on their FM Radio studio, another round of stronger firing started outside. Yousafzai spoke out against the Taliban on the national current affairs show Capital Talk on 18 February. Three days later, local Taliban leader Maulana Fazlulla announced on his FM radio station that he was lifting the ban on women's education, and girls would be allowed to attend school until exams were held on 17 March, but they had to wear burqas.|$|E

500|$|Pelinka is {{well known}} as the agent of Kobe Bryant, who retired {{at the end of}} the [...] after 20 seasons as a {{perennial}} All-Star guard for the Los Angeles Lakers. In fact, some of his other clients have hired him because of this. [...] During the 2003 sexual assault case against Bryant, Pelinka spent a considerable amount of time with his client. [...] He accompanied him on trips to Eagle, Colorado. [...] It was Pelinka who confirmed the news of Bryant's second child. [...] In 2004, when Bryant was a free agent, Pelinka confirmed Bryant would remain in Los Angeles with either the Lakers or the Los Angeles Clippers while rumors were flying that he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>sign</b> with the Chicago Bulls. [...] Subsequently, when Rudy Tomjanovich was hired to be the Lakers' head coach, he sent free agent Bryant and Pelinka a video package describing the things he has done for players at Bryant's position. [...] A few days later, Pelinka negotiated a contract for Bryant to remain with the Lakers for $136.4 million over seven years. [...] When Bryant demanded to be traded during the 2007 offseason, Pelinka confirmed that [...] "Kobe would like to be moved." ...|$|E
500|$|However, Auerbach {{could not}} prevent the Celtics from {{going into a}} slump {{at the end of}} the 1970s. He traded away both Silas and Westphal because they wanted salary {{increases}} that would have made them higher earners than the best player on the Celtics (Cowens), which was not acceptable to Auerbach. [...] While the Westphal trade to the Phoenix Suns in exchange for Charlie Scott was considered a success due to the Celtics' 13th title in 1976, Auerbach later admitted he erred in letting Silas go, even after Cowens personally begged him to give Silas a new deal. When Havlicek retired in 1978, the Celtics went 61–103 in two seasons. In the summer of 1978, after the worst in a string of contentious clashes with several different owners after Walter Brown's passing in 1964, Auerbach hopped into a taxi to take him to Logan Airport, where he was to board a flight to New York to consider a lucrative contract offer from Knicks owner Sonny Werblin. However, the cab driver pleaded with him to stay, emphasizing how much Bostonians loved him and considered him family. Soon after, heading a team press conference, and with his typical bravado, Auerbach puffed on his trademark cigar and stated simply, [...] "I'm not going anywhere. [...] We're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>sign</b> Larry Bird, and we're going to be on top again." [...] Despite knowing that Bird, a talented young player from unheralded Indiana State, had a year of college eligibility remaining, he had drafted Bird as a junior eligible in the 1978 NBA draft and waited for a year until the future Hall-of-Fame forward Bird arrived, finally setting aside his team salary rules when it became clear that his choices were paying Bird a record-setting rookie salary or watch him simply re-enter the 1979 draft. Bird then became the highest-paid Celtic as a rookie, with a $650,000-per year deal. Auerbach knew that the brilliant, hardworking Bird would be the cornerstone of a new Celtics generation.|$|E
500|$|Before {{entering}} the studio, Metallica collected ideas on [...] "riff tape" [...] recordings of various jam sessions. Hetfield and Ulrich {{went through the}} tapes and selected the strongest riffs to assemble into songs. Instruments were recorded separately, with Hetfield playing only rhythm guitar. Rasmussen, {{with the help of}} drum roadie Flemming Larsen, taught the basics of timing and beat duration to Ulrich, who had a tendency to increase speed and had little knowledge of rhythm theory. Drums were recorded in an empty warehouse {{at the back of the}} studio, which was not soundproof and caused reverberation. Although four tracks were already arranged, the band members were not used to creating songs in the studio, as they had not done so for Kill 'Em All. [...] "For Whom the Bell Tolls", [...] "Trapped Under Ice" [...] and [...] "Escape" [...] were written from scratch in Copenhagen, and the band put finishing touches on [...] "Fight Fire with Fire", [...] "Ride the Lightning", [...] "Creeping Death", and [...] "The Call of Ktulu", which were already performed live. Lead guitarist Kirk Hammett took the album's name from a passage in Stephen King's novel The Stand. The cover art, displaying an electric chair in the midst of lightning bolts, was conceived before recording began. Metallica initially had sound problems because its gear was stolen three weeks before the band arrived in Copenhagen. Band members slept in the studio by day as they could not afford a hotel and recorded by night because the studio was booked by other artists during daytime. Because the group was looking for a major label deal, several A representatives from different labels visited the studio. At first it seemed Metallica was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>sign</b> with Bronze Records, but the deal fell through because Bronze executive Gerry Bron did not appreciate the work done at Sweet Silence and wanted the US edition to be remixed by engineer Eddie Kramer, and even considered re-recording the album in another studio. Metallica was put off by Bron's failure to share the band's artistic vision and decided to look for another label for the US release, in spite of the fact that Bronze had already advertised Metallica as one of their bands.|$|E
