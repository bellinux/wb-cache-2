40|$|Fast {{algorithms}} for {{the accurate}} evaluation of some singular integral operators {{that arise in}} the context of solving certain partial differential equations within the unit circle in the complex plane are presented. These algorithms are generalizations and extensions of a fast algorithm of Daripa (SIAM J. Sci. Stat. Comput., 13, No. 6, (1992), 1418 - 1432). They are based on some recursive relations in Fourier space and the FFT (fast Fourier transform), and have theoretical computational complexity of order log N per point where N 2 is the total number of grid points. An application of these algorithms to quasiconformal mappings of doubly connected domains onto annuli is presented in a follow-up paper. AMS: 65 Y 20, 65 E 05, 45 P 05, 44 A 20, 30 E 20. 1.

40|$|Abstract. An ideal I {{of a local}} Gorenstein ring (R, m) {{is called}} cohomologically {{complete}} intersection whenever <b>Hi</b> <b>I</b> (R) = 0 for all i = heightI. Here <b>Hi</b> <b>I</b> (R), i ∈ Z, denotes the local cohomology of R with respect to I. For instance, a set-theoretic complete intersection is a cohomologically complete intersection. Here we study cohomologically complete intersections from various homological points of view, in particular {{in terms of their}} Bass numbers of Hc I (R), c = heightI. As a main result it is shown that the vanishing <b>Hi</b> <b>I</b> (R) = 0 for all i = c is completely encoded in homological properties of Hc I (R), in particular in its Bass numbers...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a systematic computational {{study of the}} inhibition of premixed flames of short chain hydrocarbons with CF 3 I, focusing on sensitivity analysis of the (normalized) burning velocity and reaction pathway analysis using the "iodine-flux" approach. A comprehensive kinetic mechanism was obtained by combining the GRI, hydrofluorocarbon and CF 3 I sub-mechanisms, and updating the rates {{of some of the}} elementary reactions. Calculations were performed using the PREMIX computer code in the CHEMKIN suite of computer codes. The updated mechanism yielded estimates of the normalized laminar burning velocities which concurs closely with published measurements. The sensitivity analysis resulted in a positive coefficient for CF 3 <b>I</b> + <b>M</b> → CF 3 + <b>I</b> + <b>M,</b> confirming the promoting effect of CF 3 I on the laminar flame velocity and is consistent with previous studies. Reaction pathways were drawn for stoichiometric, fuel-lean and fuel-rich flames doped with 1 and 2 % of CF 3 I at atmospheric pressure. The reaction pathway analysis served to identify four major inhibition cycles, denoted as <b>HI</b> → <b>I</b> → <b>HI,</b> <b>HI</b> → <b>I</b> → <b>I</b> 2 → <b>HI,</b> <b>HI</b> → <b>I</b> → CH 3 <b>I</b> → <b>HI</b> and <b>HI</b> → <b>I</b> → C 2 H 5 <b>I</b> → <b>HI.</b> Furthermore, the paper developed a linear expression linking the normalized rate of heat release with the ratio of laminar burning velocities of mitigated and non-mitigated flames, and verified the efficacy of this expression for flames inhibited with CF 3 I...|$|R
