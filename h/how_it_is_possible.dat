He showed <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> to derive the most important information about {{the behavior of a}} family of solutions without having to solve the equation (since this may not always be possible). He successfully used this approach to problems in celestial mechanics and mathematical physics.|$|E
25|$|Plato was {{the first}} philosopher who {{systematically}} inquired into issues such as those noted above. He wrote many dialogues, such as Euthyphro and the Apology, but {{it is from the}} Meno that the modern instantiation of Plato's Problem is derived. In the Meno, Plato theorizes about the relationship between knowledge and experience and provides an explanation for <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> to know something that one has never been explicitly taught. Plato believed that we possess innate ideas that precede any knowledge that we gain through experience.|$|E
25|$|Kelly is {{also known}} for her {{investigation}} on psychics and cold reading techniques. Kelly has investigated the methods used by psychics to convince their clients of their alleged supernatural powers, and she even experimented performing astrology readings. She later developed her own divination system, which she named Tauromancy, which she uses to debunk psychics by showing <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> to create an illusion of a psychic reading just through psychology and by using the client's reactions to the reader's suggestions. Her method includes objects suggestive of magic, such as a purported handwritten and illustrated book {{with the history of}} the tradition, a mat, essences, rods and metal masks.|$|E

I provide a medical explanation of <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>possible</b> for the man reporting this remarkable NDE to have survived his period of cardiac arrest and <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>possible</b> for him to have undergone an NDE. More importantly, I discuss <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>possible</b> for this man to have undergone the truly unusual perceptions of feeling pain in his chest due to cardiac massage {{at the same time as}} his consciousness was displaced out of his body during an out-of-body experience...|$|R

25|$|Bartlett's studies {{relating}} to the nosology of mental illness and his critique of the assumption that psychological normality should be equated with good mental health led him to examine the psychology of creative individuals. The psychology of artists and other highly creative people has been studied from the diagnostic perspective of DSM's psychiatric classification of mental disorders, {{with the result that}} some outstanding creative individuals may be considered to have various degrees of psychopathology. Bartlett has argued that this is not only short-sighted, but it questionably presumes that the psychology of normality should serve as arbiter for mentally healthy emotional, aesthetic, and cognitive characteristics and abilities. In a group of further publications, Bartlett has described in detail <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> to enrich and deepen our understanding of both the psychology of creativity and the psychology of normality.|$|E
25|$|Kant then asks {{why we have}} {{to follow}} the {{principle}} of morality. He is forced to “admit that no interest impels me to do so”. He says that we clearly do “regard ourselves as free in acting and so to hold ourselves yet subject to certain laws” but wonders how this is possible. He then explains just <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible,</b> by appealing to the two perspectives that we can consider ourselves under. According to Kant, human beings cannot know the ultimate structure of reality. Whilst humans experience the world as having three spatial dimensions and as being extended in time, we cannot say anything about how reality ultimately is, from a god's-eye perspective. From this god's-eye perspective the world may be nothing like the way it appears to human beings. We cannot get out of our heads and leave our human perspective on the world to know what it is like independently of our own viewpoint; we can only know about how the world appears to us, not about how the world is in itself. Kant calls the world as it appears to us {{from our point of view}} the world of sense or of appearances. The world from a god's-eye perspective is the world of things in themselves or the “world of understanding”. It is the distinction between these two perspectives that Kant appeals to in explaining how freedom is possible. Insofar as we take ourselves to be exercising our free will, Kant argues, we have to consider ourselves from the perspective of the world of understanding. It is only in the world of understanding that it makes sense to talk of free wills. In the world of appearances, everything is determined by physical laws, and there is no room for a free will to change the course of events. If you consider yourself as part of the world of appearances, then you cannot think of yourself as having a will that brings things about.|$|E

500|$|The {{thesis of}} physicalism {{is that the}} mind {{is part of the}} {{material}} (or physical) world. Such a position faces the problem that the mind has certain properties that no other material thing seems to possess. Physicalism must therefore explain <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> that these properties can nonetheless emerge from a material thing. The project of providing such an explanation {{is often referred to as}} the [...] "naturalization of the mental". Some of the crucial problems that this project attempts to resolve include the existence of qualia and the nature of intentionality.|$|E

2500|$|Lucretius (1st. c. BC) {{opposed the}} concept of a spherical Earth, because he {{considered}} that an infinite universe had no center towards which heavy bodies would tend. Thus, he thought the idea of animals walking around topsy-turvy under the Earth was absurd. By the 1st century AD, Pliny the Elder {{was in a position to}} claim that everyone agreed on the spherical shape of Earth, though disputes continued regarding the nature of the antipodes, and <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> to keep the ocean in a curved shape.

2500|$|This {{article is}} often termed a [...] "pearl" [...] of science {{because it is}} brief and {{contains}} {{the answer to a}} fundamental mystery about living organisms. This mystery was the question of <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> that genetic instructions are held inside organisms and how they are passed from generation to generation. The article presents a simple and elegant solution, which surprised many biologists at the time who believed that DNA transmission was going to be more difficult to deduce and understand. The discovery had a major impact on biology, particularly in the field of genetics, enabling later researchers to understand the genetic code.|$|E
2500|$|Another reason Tillich criticized {{theological}} theism {{was because}} it placed God into the subject-object dichotomy. This is the basic distinction made in Epistemology, that branch of Philosophy which deals with human knowledge, <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible,</b> what it is, and its limits. Epistemologically, God cannot be made into an object, that is, an object of the knowing subject. Tillich deals with this question {{under the rubric of}} the relationality of God. The question is [...] "whether there are external relations between God and the creature". Traditionally Christian theology has always understood the doctrine of creation to mean precisely this external relationality between God, the Creator, and the creature as separate and not identical realities. Tillich reminds us of the point, which can be found in Luther, that [...] "there is no place to which man can withdraw from the divine thou, because it includes the ego and is nearer to the ego than the ego to itself".|$|E
