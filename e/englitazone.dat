40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>englitazone</b> sodium, an {{antidiabetic}} agent, on ion channel {{activity in the}} CRI-G 1 insulin secreting cell line was examined by use of the patch clamp technique. Application of <b>englitazone</b> {{to the outside of}} CRI-G 1 cells in the whole-cell recording configuration produced concentration-dependent inhibition of KATP currents with an IC 50 value of 8 [*]μM. The inhibition of the K+ current was not affected by the removal of Mg 2 + ions from or the addition of trypsin to the solution bathing the intracellular surface of the cell membrane. <b>Englitazone</b> also inhibited KATP channel activity in recordings from inside out excised membrane patches. The concentration-dependence of inhibition was identical to that observed in whole-cell recordings and was voltage-independent. Single channel recordings confirmed that neither the absence or presence of Mg 2 + ions nor the addition of trypsin at the intracellular surface of the membrane influenced the inhibition of KATP channels by <b>englitazone.</b> <b>Englitazone</b> also inhibited Ca 2 +-activated non-selective cation (NSCa) channels in inside-out patches in a concentration-dependent and voltage-independent manner with an IC 50 value of 10 [*]μM. In comparison, the non-sulphonylurea KATP channel blocker ciclazindol produced a slight voltage-dependent inhibition of the NSCa channel at a concentration of 20 [*]μM. In whole-cell recordings <b>englitazone,</b> at a relatively high concentration (50 [*]μM) in comparison with that required to block KATP and NSCa channels, inhibited voltage-activated Ca 2 + currents by 33 % but did not inhibit voltage-activated K+ and Na+ currents. It is concluded that <b>englitazone</b> is a novel blocker of NSCa and KATP channels. The inhibition of KATP channels occurs following procedures that dissociate sulphonylurea receptor coupling to the channel. The equipotent and voltage-independent inhibition of NSCa and KATP channels by <b>englitazone</b> may indicate a common mechanism of block...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} the {{antidiabetic}} agent <b>englitazone</b> and the anorectic drug ciclazindol on ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channels activated by diazoxide and leptin were examined in the CRI-G 1 insulin-secreting cell line using whole cell and single channel recording techniques. In whole cell current clamp mode, the hyperglycaemic agent diazoxide (200 [*]μM) and the ob gene product leptin (10 [*]nM) hyperpolarised CRI-G 1 cells by activation of KATP currents. KATP currents activated by either agent were inhibited by tolbutamide, with an IC 50 for leptin-activated currents of 9. 0 [*]μM. Application of <b>englitazone</b> produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of KATP currents activated by diazoxide (200 [*]μM) with an IC 50 value of 7. 7 [*]μM and a Hill coefficient of 0. 87. In inside-out patches <b>englitazone</b> (30 [*]μM) also inhibited KATP channel currents activated by diazoxide by 90. 8 ± 4. 1 %. In contrast, <b>englitazone</b> (1 – 30 [*]μM) failed to inhibit KATP channels activated by leptin, although higher concentrations (> 30 [*]μM) did inhibit leptin actions. The <b>englitazone</b> concentration inhibition curve {{in the presence of}} leptin resulted in an IC 50 value and Hill coefficient of 52 [*]μM and 3. 2, respectively. Similarly, in inside-out patches <b>englitazone</b> (30 [*]μM) failed to inhibit the activity of KATP channels in the presence of leptin. Ciclazindol also inhibited KATP currents activated by diazoxide (200 [*]μM) in a concentration-dependent manner, with an IC 50 and Hill coefficient of 127 [*]nM and 0. 33, respectively. Furthermore, application of ciclazindol (1 [*]μM) to the intracellular surface of inside-out patches inhibited KATP channel currents activated by diazoxide (200 [*]μM) by 86. 6 ± 8. 1 %. However, ciclazindol was much less effective at inhibiting KATP currents activated by leptin (10 [*]nM). Ciclazindol (0. 1 – 10 [*]μM) had no effect on KATP currents activated by leptin, whereas higher concentrations (> 10 [*]μM) did cause inhibition with an IC 50 value of 40 [*]μM and an associated Hill coefficient of 2. 7. Similarly, ciclazindol (1 [*]μM) had no significant effect on KATP channel activity following leptin addition in excised inside-out patches. In conclusion, KATP currents activated by diazoxide and leptin show different sensitivity to <b>englitazone</b> and ciclazindol. This may be due to differences in the mechanism of activation of KATP channels by diazoxide and leptin...|$|E
40|$|Two {{electrode}} voltage clamp and single channel recordings {{were used to}} investigate the actions of various ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channel inhibitors on cloned KATP channels, expressed in Xenopus oocytes and HEK 293 cells. Oocytes expressing Kir 6. 2 and SUR 1 gave rise to inwardly rectifying K+ currents following bath application of 3 [*]mM sodium azide. Inside-out recordings from non-azide treated oocytes demonstrated the presence of KATP channels which were activated by direct application of 3 [*]mM azide and 0. 1 [*]mM Mg-ATP. Tolbutamide inhibited azide-induced macroscopic Kir 6. 2 -SUR 1 currents, recorded from Xenopus oocytes, with an IC 50 value similar to native KATP channels. Ciclazindol and <b>englitazone</b> also inhibited these currents in a concentration-dependent manner, but with relative potencies substantially less than for native KATP channels. Single channel currents recorded from inside-out patches excised from oocytes expressing Kir 6. 2 -SUR 1 currents were inhibited by tolbutamide, Mg-ATP, <b>englitazone</b> and ciclazindol, {{in the absence of}} azide, with potencies similar to native KATP channels. In the presence of azide, Kir 6. 2 -SUR 1 currents were inhibited by <b>englitazone</b> and tolbutamide but not ciclazindol. Single channel currents derived from Kir 6. 2 Δ 26, expressed in HEK 293 cells, were inhibited by ciclazindol and <b>englitazone</b> irrespective of the absence or presence of SUR 1. In conclusion, heterologously expressed Kir 6. 2 and SUR 1 recapitulate the pharmacological profile of native pancreatic β-cell KATP channels. However, currents induced by azide exhibit a substantially reduced sensitivity to ciclazindol. It is likely that ciclazindol and <b>englitazone</b> inhibit KATP currents by interaction with the Kir 6. 2 subunit...|$|E
40|$|Glitazones or thiazolidinediones (TZDs) are a {{class of}} oral insulin {{sensitizing}} agents. They act on the nuclear receptor of the target cells called as Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptor- γ (PPAR-γ). They were introduced into clinical practice in 1997. The first agent troglitazone was extensively studied, later withdrawn for association with hepatotoxicity. Second generation TZDs are rosiglitazone and pioglitazone. Other {{members of the group}} are ciglitazone and <b>englitazone.</b> These compounds show qualitatively similar metabolic activity but vary in potency. 1 Site and Mechanism of Action (Fig. 1) PPAR γ is a nuclear receptor found predominantly in adipose tissue, also present in skeletal muscle and liver. Natural ligands of PPAR γ include fatty acids (FA), prostaglandin metabolites and leukotrienes. TZDs are synthetic ligands of the intracellular PPAR- γ. TZDs are lipophilic drugs which readily enter cells and bind to PPAR γ with high affinity. PPAR γ is complexed with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) and their activation results in activation of regulatory sequences of DNA that control the expression of specific genes. Besides pioglitazone also works through PPAR α at liver for regulation of lipid homeostasis. Fig. 1 : Mechanism of action of thiazolidinediones C h a p t e r 4...|$|E
40|$|The {{level of}} {{maternal}} circulating triacylglycerols during late pregnancy has been {{correlated with the}} mass of newborns. PPARγ (peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor γ) ligands, such as TZDs (thiazolidinediones), {{have been shown to}} reduce triacylglycerolaemia and have also been implicated in the inhibition of tissue growth and the promotion of cell differentiation. Therefore TZDs might control cell proliferation during late fetal development and, by extension, body mass of pups. To investigate the response to EZ (<b>englitazone),</b> a TZD, on perinatal development, 0 or 50  mg of englitazone/kg of body mass was given as an oral dose to pregnant rats daily from day 16 of gestation until either day 20 for the study of their fetuses, or until day 21 of gestation for the study of neonates. EZ decreased maternal triacylglycerol levels at day 20 of gestation and neonatal mass, but not fetal mass. Fetuses and neonates from EZ-treated mothers exhibited high levels of insulin and were found to be hyperglycaemic. The apparent insulin-resistant state in neonates from EZ-treated pregnant rats was corroborated, since they showed higher plasma NEFA [non-esterified (‘free’) fatty acid] levels, ketonaemia and liver LPL (lipoprotein lipase) activity and lower plasma IGF-I (type 1 insulin-like growth factor) levels, in comparison with those from control mothers. Moreover, at the molecular level, an increase in Akt phosphorylation was found in the liver of neonates from EZ-treated mothers, which confirms that the insulin pathway was negatively affected. Thus the response of fetuses and neonates to maternal antidiabetic drug treatment is the opposite of what would be expected, and can be justified by the scarce amount of adipose tissue impeding a normal response to PPARγ ligands and by hyperinsulinaemia as being responsible for a major insulin-resistant condition...|$|E
