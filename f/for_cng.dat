40|$|A {{demonstration}} compressed {{natural gas}} (CNG) bus has been operating on The University of Texas at Austin shuttle system since 1992. This CNG vehicle, provided by the Blue Bird Company, was {{an opportunity for the}} University {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} a <b>CNG</b> bus <b>for</b> shuttle operations. Three basic operating comparisons were made: 1) fuel consumption, 2) tire wear, and 3) vehicle performance. The bus was equipped with a data logger, Which was downloaded regularly, for trip reports. Tire wear was monitored regularly, and performance tests were conducted at the Natural Gas Vehicle Technology Center. Overall, the data suggest that fuel costs <b>for</b> the <b>CNG</b> bus are comparable to those for University diesel buses. This is a result of the lower fuel price for natural gas. Actual natural gas fuel consumption was higher <b>for</b> the <b>CNG</b> buses than <b>for</b> the diesel buses. Due to weight differences, tire wear was much less on the CNG buses. Finally, after installation of a closed-loop system, the CNG bus out-performed the diesel bus on acceleration, grade climbing ability, and speed...|$|R

40|$|The {{diminishing}} {{resources and}} continuously increasing cost of petroleum {{in association with}} their alarming pollution levels from diesel engines has caused an interest in finding alternative fuels to diesel. Emission control and engine efficiency {{are two of the}} most important parameters in current engine design.

This paper studies the effect of CNG gas induction as well as CNG gas injection on the performance of CNG Biodiesel operated dual fuel engine <b>for</b> both <b>CNG</b> and Honge oil methyl esters (HOME) on combustion of both manifold inducted and injected compressed natural gas (CNG) blended with HOME in a dual-fuel engine. From the experimental evidence it is found that combustion of HOME with CNG in a dual fuel engine operated with optimized parameters of injection timing of 27 ° BTDC and compression ratio of 17. 5 results in acceptable combustion emissions and improved brake thermal efficiencies. The implementation of injection strategies <b>for</b> both <b>CNG</b> and HOME fuels results in increased brake thermal efficiency and considerably reduce combustion emissions such as smoke, HC, CO and NOx...|$|R

50|$|As {{price of}} oil climbed rapidly, it was {{estimated}} more than 40,000 new cars and trucks powered by natural-gas were purchased in six months in 2008, including many buses. That year, {{about half of the}} taxi fleet in Bangkok used LPG, and were prodded to convert to CNG, with little success. Since 2008, there has been a government arm-twisting to switch from LPG to CNG, with a rollout of CNG stations near Bangkok around 2007 and then upcountry in 2010, at times replacing LPG stations. Operators of used vehicles have balked at the massive conversion cost (up to quadruple that of LPG in Thailand), especially given Thailand's strong ultra-competitive domestic LPG conversion industry, as well as retail CNG fuel cost (one and a half times). Thailand had some 700,000 LPG fueled vehicles, and 300,000 CNG fueled, with 1,000 LPG stations and 600 CNG as of 2011. Demand has increased 26% over 2011 <b>for</b> <b>CNG</b> in Thailand. As of the end of 2012, Thailand has 1,014,000 LPG fueled vehicles, and consumed 606,000 tonnes in 2012 of LPG, while 483 stations serve up some 380,000 CNG vehicles., showing that LPG conversion continues to enjoy heavy favor over NGVs despite massive government push <b>for</b> <b>CNG.</b> CNG vehicles {{are more likely to be}} bought factory installed while LPG is likely to be an aftermarket conversion.
