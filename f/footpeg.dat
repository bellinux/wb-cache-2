500|$|... "18 Miles Out" [...] was {{directed}} by Ernest Dickerson and co-written by Scott M. Gimple and showrunner Glen Mazzara. The storyline between Rick Grimes and Shane Walsh reaches a climax in [...] "18 Miles Out", {{in which the two}} men get into a heated argument, ultimately engaging in a physical confrontation. Gimple conceived and wrote the scene into the episode's script. In the fight scene, the moves were choreographed. Dickerson collaborated with Lonnie Smith, Jr. who served as the stunt coordinator. Smith cast two stuntmen to demonstrate and act out the scene for Lincoln and Bernthal so they could duplicate the choreography. Jeremy Connors portrayed Rick, while Trent Bry played the role of Shane. In the fight sequence, Shane topples a motorcycle onto Rick's legs, temporarily immobilizing him. The motorcycle weighed an estimated 800 pounds; in order to decrease the weight of the vehicle, Dickerson and his team emptied the gas tank. This was rehearsed at the series' production studios. Scalan Backus, The Walking Deads special effects technician, rigged the vehicle's <b>footpeg</b> to prevent it from sliding and making contact with the actors' legs. Backus also added a rod with a secure stable so it would give further clearance to the actors and increase the motorcycle's height from the ground. The cameramen filmed the shots at an angle, creating the illusion that the vehicle did hit the actors' legs. Writer Robert Kirkman summated on the aftermath of the confrontation: ...|$|E
2500|$|By the 1980s, the European {{motorcycle}} {{industry as}} a whole was reeling from Japanese competition, causing many companies like NVT (the amalgamated surviving British companies Norton, Triumph, and BSA), Moto-Guzzi, and many others to struggle or disappear completely. [...] Laverda attempted to update their product line by introducing the RGS sports tourer in 1983, [...] with features such unbreakable Bayflex plastic mouldings; fuel filler in the fairing; integrated but removable luggage (Executive version), and adjustable <b>footpeg</b> position. [...] In 1985, came the SFC 1000 sports model [...] a badge engineered attempt based on the RGS to reprise the hallowed SFC name.|$|E
5000|$|... 2010For the 2010 season, Reed joined {{new team}} mate Ryan Villopoto riding the KX-450F for the Monster Energy Kawasaki Racing Team. Reed failed to finish during the round one final {{due to a}} {{collision}} with another racer's <b>footpeg,</b> breaking spokes in his front wheel. During round two he collided with James Stewart, Jr. in the final, breaking his hand resulting in another DNF. Reed returned to race round 13 of the supercross series, and despite having a bad start, Reed finished fourth. Chad Reed withdrew from competition stating he has Epstein Barr Virus. In an open letter published on his website Reed admits that becoming a new dad and also {{the death of his}} close personal friend Andrew McFarlane may be reasons people look to for his poor performance.|$|E

5000|$|The Bandit 750 was a Japan only {{model that}} used parts {{from both the}} 600 and 1200 models; the front frame cradle was {{identical}} to the 600, the rear subframe was identical to the 1200 with bolt on pillion <b>footpeg</b> handers, the clocks were 1200 items with a higher red-line on the rev counter of 12,000rpm (vs 10,000 for the 1200), including a fuel gauge which was absent from the 600 models of the time. The running gear and suspension were also {{the same as the}} 600. The engine, although visually identical to the 600, had a capacity of 748 cc, The carburettors were similar to the 600 apart from jetting, whereas the exhaust was identical to the 1200. The 750 came with a 6 speed gearbox like the 600 - as opposed to the 5 speed on the 1200. Power was a claimed [...] All machines were restricted to 180 km/h to comply with Japanese regulations, but are easily de-restricted to a true maximum speed of 220 km/h.|$|E

Writer Robert Kirkman summated on the aftermath of the confrontation:At the end of this week's episode, Rick is of the mind that they're square; they've got everything out in the open, they've each said their piece and they both know where each other stands, they've had their big blowout and they're riding back in that car and Rick thinks he's handled it. He doesn't necessarily think he's got his friend back, but he thinks the matters are settled. From the look of Shane in that car, I don't know that he's necessarily thinking that. For the most part, this conflict may be put on the back burner for the time being. It definitely seems like Shane still has a bone to pick.While returning to Hershel's farm, Shane stares at a walker in an abandoned field. Kirkman stated the walker symbolizes the growing scope of the zombie virus. [...] "We're really just trying to show that that kind of thing is inescapable," [...] he said. [...] "You're just driving down the street, you look over and, 'Oh, there you go, there’s a zombie.' We're trying to show that this world {{is becoming more and more}} populated by zombies. Our thinking is that large population centers like Atlanta are really where the heart of this began and as and crew moved out to Hershel’s farm they didn’t really encounter very many walkers because they are moving out of the city center at a faster rate than the zombie population. And that zombie population is starting to catch up with them. The area is starting to become more and more dense with walkers." ...|$|E

5000|$|In January of 2006 Vurtego {{released}} its first pogo stick, the V1. The V1 {{was the first}} air-powered extreme pogo stick ever sold and was capable of jumping more than seven feet high. The V1 utilized a custom extruded plastic cylinder body, billet aluminum <b>footpegs,</b> a non-rotating stainless steel shaft, and a nylon piston.|$|R
5000|$|The celebrity {{clients who}} order WCC bikes are a main avenue of promotion. The {{motorcycle}} made for Shaquille O'Neal cost US$150,000 and was customized for the athlete's 338 lb weight and 49 in inseam, and enormous hands, {{resulting in a}} dramatic 11.5 ft long bike with <b>footpegs</b> made for size 24 feet.

50|$|The XV920R had {{a unique}} {{enclosed}} chain final drive, a large, 8 in headlamp, a high-capacity sculpted fuel tank, and rear-set controls and <b>footpegs.</b> Like the Virago, {{it had a}} stamped-steel backbone frame, also serving {{as part of the}} air-induction system. It had a mono-shock rear suspension, with (air) preload and damper adjustments. The front suspension had air preload adjustment only.|$|R
50|$|The RC8 R {{offers many}} chassis {{adjustments}} not found on other superbikes. In {{addition to the}} suspension, the rider can adjust many other parts on the bike including the front brake lever, the rear brake pedal, the clutch lever, the handlebars, the shifter, the <b>footpegs,</b> and the seat/subframe height. Essentially, the adjustable options allow the RC8 R to accommodate riders of various sizes.|$|R
25|$|Dyna models {{utilize the}} big-twin engine (F), <b>footpegs</b> noted as (X) with the {{exception}} of the 2012 FLD Switchback, a Dyna model which used floorboards as featured on the Touring (L) models, and the Dyna chassis (D). Therefore, except for the FLD from 2012 to 2016, all Dyna models have designations that begin with FXD, e.g., FXDWG (Dyna Wide Glide) and FXDL (Dyna Low Rider).|$|R
50|$|All series {{have been}} {{equipped}} with windshields, saddleboxes, pursuit lights, and folding floorboards rather than <b>footpegs.</b> All are a single-rider {{version of the}} Universal Japanese Motorcycle design popular until the advent of specialized motorcycle designs divided the market into cruisers, sport bikes, touring bikes and other specialized applications.

50|$|In October 2006, Yamaha {{announced}} an updated FZ6 for the 2007 model year.The FZ6 received optimized fuel injection (FI) system mapping, redesigned fairing and windscreen, new instrument cluster with analog tachometer and digital speedometer (similar to the FZ1), new four-piston monoblock brake calipers {{for the front}} brake, alumite-finished front forks with revised damping, a three-way catalytic converter, a new seat design, a new rear swingarm, and new passenger <b>footpegs.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Super 9 is a {{lightweight}} scooter made by Kymco. It has modern performance styling, {{as opposed to}} the retro styling seen on many scooters. It can accommodate a rider and passenger, having aluminum passenger <b>footpegs</b> and a large seat. It has an underseat storage box for a full face helmet. It can reach about 80kmh in stock form. The engine design is based on Honda's AF18E/AF16E Dio motor.|$|R
25|$|Sport bikes {{have high}} <b>footpegs</b> that {{position}} the legs {{closer to the}} body to improve ground clearance when cornering, and a long reach to the hand controls, which positions the body and center of gravity forward, above the fuel tank. The rider leans forward into the wind, the force of which can comfortably support the rider's weight at speeds near , but at lower speeds leaves too much weight on the arms and wrists, causing fatigue.|$|R
2500|$|Sport {{the rider}} leans {{forward into the}} wind and the weight of the upper torso is {{supported}} by the rider's core at low speed and air pressure at high speed (e.g., above [...] ). The <b>footpegs</b> are below the rider or to the rear. The reduced frontal area cuts wind resistance and allows higher speeds. At low-speed this position throws the weight of the rider onto the arms, which can tire the rider's wrists.|$|R
50|$|The last new MZ {{model was}} the 1000S which {{featured}} a novel 1000 cc, DOHC parallel twin {{designed and built}} by MZ. The 1000S is a sport-tourer by design. The 1000S' unique engine is exceptionally compact for its displacement. The range includes a naked (unfaired) version and a full tourer with luggage, higher handlebars, and lower <b>footpegs</b> for comfort. Both of these are retuned, with less outright horsepower than the 'S', but with more torque.|$|R

50|$|The MT125R shares {{many parts}} with the CR125 engine. The CR {{versions}} were motocross bikes with similar specifications. One notable difference was the shift {{pattern on the}} transmission. Both had the standard 1 down 5 up pattern. On MT125R versions the shift lever was flipped over rearward to accommodate the rearset <b>footpegs</b> of the MT roadracer. To maintain the widely used 1 down 5 up pattern a different shift linkage was used behind the engine cover.|$|R
50|$|The next edition to the Vurtego series, {{known as}} the V3, became {{available}} in late 2009. The V3 {{is similar to a}} V2 but has an aluminum tube and a new boltless air piston. There were two versions, the standard V3 anodized aluminum and a black version {{known as the}} 'V3 Stealth'. The stealth version features an all black anodized aluminum tube and <b>footpegs</b> with the same performance as the standard V3. The V3 comes in the three sizes.|$|R

5000|$|The {{so-called}} Pröll Way (Pröll-Weg), {{which is}} waymarked, offers an attractive climb {{from the northwest}} to the top. It runs from the Niedersachsenhaus along a sweeping mountain ridge or arête to the summit. This route, which crosses the Neuner Kogel (2,827 m) and the Herzog Ernst (2,933 m), {{is relatively easy to}} negotiate in dry and snow-free conditions albeit sure-footedness and a head for heights are required. There is one climbing section secured with <b>footpegs</b> (Trittstiften).|$|R
25|$|Standards, {{also called}} naked bikes or roadsters, are versatile, {{general-purpose}} street motorcycles. They are recognized primarily by their upright riding position, partway between the reclining rider posture of the cruisers and the forward leaning sport bikes. <b>Footpegs</b> are below the rider and handlebars are {{high enough to}} not force the rider to reach too far forward, placing the shoulders above the hips in a natural position. Because of their flexibility, lower costs, and moderate engine output, standards are particularly suited to motorcycle beginners.|$|R
50|$|The Euro {{was meant}} to be a sporty bike with sport touring aspiration. A big 17 litre tank, or 4.5 US gallons, gives it a much greater range than the other two models. The <b>footpegs</b> sit further back and the {{handlebars}} are lower than on the Ascot, and especially the Shadow, without being anywhere near racy. The passenger portion of the seat is not nearly as cozy as the bit offered to the rider; narrower, shorter and with high set pegs.|$|R
50|$|The 2006 model, {{known as}} the monoposto (solo) had a well {{gusseted}} 60 mm section asymmetric swingarm and a single shock, with stacked mufflers on the right side, low clip-on handlebars, and a dry-clutch. In 2007, a variation was made to taller clip-on handlebars, a wet-clutch, and the GT1000's dual-shock swingarm with mufflers on both sides. This change created space for passenger <b>footpegs</b> and a removable rear seat cowl covering a pillion seat was added, prompting the name change to Sport1000 biposto (tandem).|$|R
2500|$|Trials — Trials riding is a {{specialized}} form of off-road competition testing balancing skills and precision rather than speed. For a trials bike, low weight and crisp throttle response power are the priorities, so trials bikes {{tend to have}} a small (125cc to 300cc) engine, [...] with two-strokes being common. During the trial, the rider stands on the <b>footpegs,</b> so a trials bike will have only a vestigial seat, or no seat at all. Fuel tanks are very small, giving a very limited range.|$|R
