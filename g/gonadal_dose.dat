40|$|Abstract Background Male gonadal {{exposure}} to ionizing radiation may disrupt spermatogenesis, but {{its influence on}} the fecundity of couples has been rarely studied. We aimed to characterize the influence of male <b>gonadal</b> <b>dose</b> of ionizing radiation delivered during radiodiagnostic on the monthly probability of pregnancy. Methods We recruited {{a random sample of}} women who retrospectively described 1110 periods of unprotected intercourse beginning between 1985 and 1999 and leading either to a live birth or to no pregnancy; their duration was censored after 13 months. The male partner answered a telephone questionnaire on radiodiagnostic examinations. We assigned a mean <b>gonadal</b> <b>dose</b> to each type of radiodiagnostic examination. We defined male dose for each period of unprotected intercourse as the sum of the gonadal doses of the X-ray examinations experienced between 18 years of age and the date of discontinuation of contraception. Time to pregnancy was analysed using a discrete Cox model with random effect allowing to estimate hazard ratios of pregnancy. Results After adjustment for female factors likely to influence fecundity, {{there was no evidence of}} an association between male dose and the probability of pregnancy (test of homogeneity, p = 0. 55). When compared to couples with a male <b>gonadal</b> <b>dose</b> between 0. 01 and 0. 20 milligrays (n = 321 periods of unprotected intercourse), couples with a <b>gonadal</b> <b>dose</b> above 10 milligrays had a hazard ratio of pregnancy of 1. 44 (95 % confidence interval, 0. 73 – 2. 86, n = 31). Conclusion Our study provides no evidence of a long-term detrimental effect of male <b>gonadal</b> <b>dose</b> of ionizing radiation delivered during radiodiagnostic on the monthly probability of pregnancy during the year following discontinuation of contraceptive use. Classification errors due to the retrospective assessment of male gonadal exposure may have limited the statistical power of our study. </p...|$|E
40|$|Background/Objective: The {{risks of}} low-dose {{ionizing}} radiation from radiology and nuclear medicine are not clearly determined. Effective dose to population {{is a very}} important factor in risk estimation. The study aimed to determine the effective dose from diagnostic radiation medi-cine in a northern province of Iran. Materials and Methods: Data about various radiologic and nuclear medicine procedures were collected from all radiology and nuclear medicine departments in Mazandaran Province (popu-lation = 2, 898, 031); and using the standard dosimetry tables, the total dose, dose per examination, and annual effective dose per capita as well as the annual <b>gonadal</b> <b>dose</b> per ca-pita were estimated. Results: 655, 730 radiologic examinations in a year’s period, lead to 1. 45 mSv, 0. 33 mSv and 0. 31 mGy as average effective dose per examination, annual average effective dose to member of the public, and annual average <b>gonadal</b> <b>dose</b> per capita, respectively. The frequency of medical radiologic examinations was 2, 262 examinations annually per 10, 000 members of population. However, the total number of nuclear medicine examinations in the same period was 7074, with 4. 37 mSv, 9. 6 &# 61549;Sv and 9. 8 &# 61549;Gy, as average effective dose per examination, an-nual average effective dose to member of the public and annual average <b>gonadal</b> <b>dose</b> per caput, respectively. The frequency of nuclear medicine examination was 24 examinations annu-ally per 10, 000 members of population. Conclusion: The average effective dose per examination was nearly similar to other studies. However, the average annual effective dose and annual average <b>gonadal</b> <b>dose</b> per capita were less than the similar values in other reports, which could be due to lesser number of radiation medicine examinations in the present study...|$|E

40|$|The National Radiological Protection Board has {{recently}} {{carried out a}} reappraisal of the annual genetically significant dose (GSD) to the population of Great Britain arising from the practice of diagnostic radiology. The current value of 120 muGy (12 mrad) is indistinguishable from the value determined 20 years ago despite a 48 % {{increase in the number}} of X-ray examinations performed per head of the population. This is mostly due to a large decrease in the contribution from obstetric radiology and to a marked reduction in the <b>gonadal</b> <b>doses</b> delivered to children for nearly all types of examination. The GSD and the frequency of X-ray examinations in Great Britain would appear to be considerably lower than those found in other industrialized countries and seem unlikely to result in more than 100 cases of serious hereditary ill-health per year at genetic equilibrium. On the other hand, diagnostic radiology is responsible for 87 % of the GSD from all man-made sources of population exposure in Great Britain and there is evidence from the data collected for this reappraisal that radiological protection measures could be improved so as to reduce significantly this large contribution without detriment to patient care...|$|R

40|$|The International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) {{determines the}} policy {{regarding}} radiation safety internationally. To the ICRP, hereditary changes {{as a result}} of either high or low doses, are of a major concern. The SA Forum for Radiation Protection recommended that a research project to determine the genetically-significant dose (GSD) for the South African population should be done as such a project has never been undertaken to date. This term was at first defined by UNSCEAR in 1958. The National Radiological Protection Board derived a formula from this definition as shown in the NRPB Report, NRPB-R 106 (1980). This formula was implemented in the project. It combines the frequency of radiological examinations obtained during the country-wide survey and estimates of <b>gonadal</b> <b>doses</b> for different examination types, together with population and child expectancy data. New procedures, techniques and data processing that were relevant to this project had to be developed because the available information and conditions are unique to South Africa. The task was set to find a model in order to draw the best representative sample of the population and it was determined in a unique way, namely the so-called Dollar Unit Sampling method. A sample of 27 institutions out of a possible 292 (9 %) was drawn in comparison, e. g., with the 8 % of France and 8 % in Great Britain. It was necessary to rely mainly on the calculation of gonad doses due to a shortage of manpower, contrary to other countries that were able to physically measure doses. Information obtained in the survey was used in this regard. The "RADCOMP Entrance Skin Exposure Software Program " of Nuclear Associates was used to produce parametric Free Air Exposure tables based on doses from Table B. 3, NCRP Report No. 102. After the skin entrance doses were calculated, it was possible to calculate the gonad doses. A computer program was obtained from the Food and Drug Administration in the USA for this purpose. Data analysis was performed by means of the software package Microsoft Excel version 4. 0. The above-mentioned formula was used in order to obtain the final results. The GSD for the total SA-population was calculated as 94. 6 μGy.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{activity}} {{concentrations of}} natural radionuclides in peloids were studied {{to assess the}} radiologic hazard from 18 Turkish spas. The peloids are mainly used for therapeutic treatments, rheumatic diseases and aesthetic purposes. The concentrations of the natural radionuclides 226 Ra, 232 Th, 40 K and 137 Cs were determined with a gamma ray spectrometer using a HPGe detector. The average activity concentrations of 226 Ra, 232 Th, 40 K, and 137 Cs in the peloids studied were 110. 69, 71. 52, 576. 48 and 0. 447 Bq/kg, respectively.

40|$|Nasarawa State {{is located}} in north central Nigeria and it is known as Nigeria's home of solid minerals. It is endowed with barite, copper, zinc, {{tantalite}} and granite. Continuous releases of mining waste and tailings into the biosphere {{may result in a}} build-up of radionuclides in air, water and soil. This work therefore aims to measure the activity concentration levels of primordial radionuclides in the soil/sediment samples collected from selected mines of the mining areas of Nasarawa State. The paper also assesses the radiological and radio ecological impacts of mining activities on the residents of mining areas and their environment. The activity concentrations of primordial radionuclides (226 Ra, 232 Th and 40 K) in the surface soils/sediment samples were determined using sodium iodide-thallium gamma spectroscopy. Seven major mines were considered with 21 samples taken from each of the mines for radiochemistry analysis. The human health hazard assessment was conducted using regulatory methodologies set by the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation, while the radio ecological impact assessment was conducted using the ERICA tool v. 1. 2. The result shows that the activity concentrations of 40 K in the water ways of the Akiri copper and the Azara barite mines are 60 and 67 % higher than the world average value for 40 K, respectively. In all mines, the annual effective dose rates (mSv y- 1) were less than unity, and a maximum annual <b>gonadal</b> <b>dose</b> of 0. 58 mSv y- 1 is received at the Akiri copper mine, which is almost twice the world average value for <b>gonadal</b> <b>dose.</b> The external hazard indices for all the mines were less than unity.

One of the most important factors for assessing the radiation risk is the dose received by sensitive organs such as gonads. Radiation damage to the gonads can be lead to genetic damages at the progeny of the radiated individuals, and that damage can be transmitted to the next generation. Materials and Methods: In this study the thermoluminescence dosimeters were used to measure the entrance skin dose. DAP values for each examination and also the patients information such as age,  size, weight and machine setting like that mA, time, kVp and focal spot to film distance were recorded. By means of PCXMC software version 2 gonadal doses were calculated.

Patient skin dose from biventricular pacing procedures requiring extended fluoroscopic exposure may exceed threshold dose for the induction of skin effects only if X-ray source-to-skin distance is kept low. The risk values for fatal cancer and severe hereditary disorders, respectively, associated with a typical CRT procedure were 273 per million and 0. 2 per million treated patients. ConclusionsRadiation risks associated with fluoroscopically guided CRT procedures may be considerable. Present data may be used for the estimation of patient radiation risks from CRT procedures performed in other institutions...|$|E

The measured activities vary from 17 ± 0. 02 Bqkg- 1 to 30. 49 ± 0. 01 Bqkg- 1, 50. 01 ± 0. 16 Bqkg- 1 to 158. 49 ± 0. 17 Bqkg- 1, and 406. 9 ± 0. 42 Bqkg- 1 to 1275. 48 ± 0. 82 Bqkg- 1 for 238 U, 232 Th and 40 K respectively. The acquired gamma radiation dose rate range from 138. 696 ± 2. 06 (nGyh- 1) to 350. 103 ± 7. 21 (nGyh- 1) with mean value of 148. 22 (nGyh- 1), almost three times higher than the recommended safe limit of 55 (nGyh- 1). The measured activities and radiation dose rate were engaged to estimate the annual outdoor effective dose, gamma index, excess lifetime cancer risks and annual <b>gonadal</b> <b>dose</b> equivalent. It was observed from all the estimated parameters, those values in the study area are well above the recommended safe limit for normal background radiation. This suggest that the dwellers and those using the excavated geomaterials from this area for construction purposes are exposed to very high radiation from natural radionuclides.

40|$|Studies on {{environmental}} radioactivity in tropical Africa are scarce. Therefore, a baseline study of natural (238 U, 210 Pb, 226 Ra, 232 Th, 228 Ra, 228 Th, 40 K) and anthropogenic (137 Cs) radionuclides {{was carried out}} on Tema Harbour (Greater Accra, Ghana) surface sediments and on their radiological significance. Grab surface sediment samples were collected from 21 stations within the Tema Harbour and their radioactivity concentrations measured by gamma spectrometry. The mean sediment radioactivity concentrations (Bq kg− 1 dw) were 34 for 238 U, 210 for 210 Pb, 14 for 226 Ra, 30 for 232 Th, 29 for 228 Ra, 31 for 228 Th, 320 for 40 K, and 1. 5 for 137 Cs. Large 238 U/ 226 Ra disequilibria were observed in the harbour sediments and a complex dynamics of several mixed sources of sediments within the Tema Harbour can be inferred from the spatial variations in the radioactivity concentrations. The estimated total absorbed dose rate in air (D), radium equivalent activity (Raeq), external hazard index (Hex), annual <b>gonadal</b> <b>dose</b> equivalent (AGDE) and annual effective dose equivalent (AEDE) indicated no significant radiological risks from the sediment radioactivity concentrations. Application of the Environmental Risk from Ionising Contaminants Assessment and Management tool (ERICA) confirmed that the potential dose rates to biota from the sediment radioactivity concentrations are unlikely to pose appreciable ecological risks. The radioactivity levels are compared with levels reported in sediments from other coastal areas of the world...|$|E
40|$|In a {{pilot study}} to detect the {{potential}} effects of atomic bomb radiation on germ-line instability, we screened 64 children from 50 exposed families and 60 from 50 control families for mutations at six minisatellite loci by using Southern blot analysis with Pc- 1, lambda TM- 18, ChdTC- 15, p lambda 3, lambda MS- 1, and CEB- 1 probes. In the exposed families, one or both parents received a radiation dose > 0. 01 Sv. Among the 64 children, only one child had parents who were both exposed. Thus, {{of a total of}} 128 gametes that produced the 64 children, 65 gametes were derived from exposed parents and 63 were from unexposed parents, the latter being included in a group of 183 unexposed gametes used for calculating mutation rates. The average parental <b>gonadal</b> <b>dose</b> for the 65 gametes was 1. 9 Sv. We detected a total of 28 mutations at the p lambda g 3, lambda MS- 1, and CEB- 1 loci, but no mutations at the Pc- 1, lambda TM- 18, and ChdTC- 15 loci. We detected 6 mutations in 390 alleles of the 65 exposed gametes and 22 mutations in 1098 alleles of the 183 gametes from the unexposed parents. The mean mutation rate per locus per gamete in these six minisatellite loci was 1. 5 % in the exposed parents and 2. 0 % in the unexposed parents.

40|$|The present paper {{describes}} a detailed {{study on the}} distribution of radionuclides along Chavara - Neendakara placer deposit, a high background radiation area (HBRA) along the Southwest coast of India (Kerala). Judged from our studies using HPGe gamma spectrometric detector, it becomes evident that Uranium ((238) U), Thorium ((232) Th) and Potassium ((40) K) are the major sources for radioactivity prevailing in the area. Our statistical analyses reveal the existence of a high positive correlation between (238) U and (232) Th, implicating that the levels of these elements are interdependent. Our SEM-EDAX analyses reveal that titanium (Ti) and zircon (Zr) are the major trace elements in the sand samples, followed by aluminum, copper, iron, ruthenium, magnesium, calcium, sulphur and lead. This is first of its kind report on the radiation hazard indices on this placer deposit. The average absorbed dose rates (9795 nGy h(- 1)) computed from the present study is comparable with the top-ranking HBRAs in the world, thus offering the Chavara-Neendakara placer the second position, after Brazil; pertinently, this value is much higher than the World average. The perceptibly high absorbed gamma dose rates, entrained with the high annual external effective dose rates (AEED) and average annual <b>gonadal</b> <b>dose</b> equivalent (AGDE) values existing in this HBRA, encourage us to suggest for a candid assessment {{of the impact of the}} background radiation, if any, on the organisms that inhabit along this placer deposit. Future research could effectively address the issue of the possible impact of natural radiation on the biota inhabiting this HBRA...|$|E
40|$|Introduction Natural and {{artificial}} radionuclides {{are the main}} sources of human radiation exposure, which enter the food chain from the environment. Radionuclides can affect human health by transferring from soil to plants and entering the human body. In this research study, we aimed to determine the activity concentrations of radionuclides and calculate the average annual committed effective dose (AACED) due to the ingestion of some medicinal and edible plants from Shazand, Markazi Province, Iran. Materials and Methods The specific activities of 226 Ra, 232 Th, 40 K, and 137 Cs in eight medicinal and edible plant species and their surrounding soils were determined, using gamma-ray spectrometry and a high-purity germanium (HPGe) detector. The samples were collected from Shazand, situated in Markazi Province, Iran. Results The maximum soil-to-plant transfer factor (TF) for 226 Ra, 232 Th, 40 K, and 137 Cswas estimated at 0. 13, 0. 13, 3. 17, and 0. 09, respectively. Based on the findings, the AACED for 1 kg of edible plants varied from 0. 63 ± 0. 16 to 13. 71 ± 0. 14 μSv/y. The annual <b>gonadal</b> <b>dose</b> Equivalent (AGDE) varied from 556 to 717 µSv/y for the soil samples (mean: 642 µSv/y). The threshold consumption rate for edible plants ranged between 21. 86 and 82. 63 kg/y. Conclusion In this study, AACED due to the ingestion of radionuclides was lower than the global average (0. 3 mSv/y). Therefore, the present results indicated no radiation health risks, {{associated with the use}} of these medicinal plants for disease treatment. However, it should be noted that all soil samples and some plants were polluted by radiocesium...|$|E
40|$|Massive {{discharge}} of liquid radioactive wastes into the Techa River in 1949 - 1956 by the industrial complex Mayak for production of plutonium for weapon resulted in protracted {{internal and external}} radiation exposure of the population living along the river. The Techa River Offspring Cohort comprises individuals born after December 31, 1949, whose one or both parents were exposed in the Techa riverside villages. The study group includes 7, 897 individuals. About 40 % of the Techa River Offspring Cohort members born in 1950 - 1956 could be exposed in utero and after birth. The mean dose estimates based on the Techa River Dosimetry System 2000 were: 0. 07 Gy for parental gonads, 0. 01 Gy for fetus and 0. 02 Gy for postnatal exposure of bone marrow. Over 46 years of follow-up from 1950 - 1995, 916 subjects died {{and the cause of}} death was known in 93 % of them. Out of 916 subjects dead, 456 (53 %) died under 1 year of age, mainly due to respiratory tract diseases (38 % of all infant deaths), infections (27 %) and perinatal disorders (13 %). It has been shown that the baseline infant mortality rate depends on gender, ethnicity and birth year. Radiation risk analysis was based on a simple parametric linear excess relative risk model with adjustment for gender, ethnicity and birth year. There was no evidence of increasing infant mortality risk with parental <b>gonadal</b> <b>dose.</b> The infant mortality rate significantly depended on fetal dose and dose to bone marrow received during the first year of life with a 3 % increase in risk per 1 cGy of intrauterine and postnatal doses...|$|E
40|$|Hardly {{anything}} {{is able to}} induce stronger emotions in the average man than those induced by matters relating to children. Paediatric patients are not little adults, so not only high-quality modern instrumentation and specific procedures, but also the medical staff?s professional attitude and an adapted environment are desirable when applying radiologic diagnostic imaging techniques. The priority requirement is generally to minimize the radiation burden ? both the overall dose and especially the <b>gonadal</b> <b>dose.</b> In terms of radiation protection, it applies twice to children that the indication {{for the use of}} an examination must always be thoroughly considered. A paediatric radiologist must always accurately determine the correct sequence of individual methods (a so-called examination algorithm) that will give the best diagnostic result with the lowest radiation burden and invasiveness. The aim of this bachelor?s thesis was to analyze the difference in a radiology assistant?s approach to a child and to an adult during radiology examinations and to determine whether a child and his/her legal guardian, if any, have sufficient information when the child undergoes radiology examinations. To clear up the aims of the bachelor?s thesis, research using a technique in which two questionnaires were used was used to collect data. The questionnaires were in both the printed form and the electronic form. The surveys took place in selected radiology departments in Strakonice, in Pisek, in Plzeň, and in Ústí nad Labem. The respondents chose from the answer options for some questions and filled in their answers for the others. The respondents? answers are represented using graphs in the ?Results? chapter. The individual graphs are described there and the most interesting answers to questionnaire questions are supplemented by general thoughts and my personal assumptions and opinions in the following ?Discussion? chapter. The practical part of the bachelor?s thesis proves that the aim of the thesis was achieved. The research questions were answered. The surveys found that the answer to the first research question, i. e. whether radiography assistants take a different approach to a child and to an adult when applying radiological imaging methods, was ?yes?. Radiography assistants take a different approach to a child and to an adult. The answer to the second research question, i. e. whether a child and his or her legal guardian, if any, have sufficient information on radiological examinations, is also positive. A child and his or her legal guardian, if any, have sufficient information on radiological examinations. I have summarised the results of my work in the ?Conclusion? chapter. Further, the surveys found that persons accompanying a child perceive the environment of radiology departments as a friendly, safe and comfortable environment. The only lack of accompanying persons? awareness that could be perceived negatively from the results of the questionnaires within this bachelor?s thesis is the finding that the lay public is not clear about the amount of radiation received during certain radiological examinations (CTs and X-ray examinations) and that the possibility of buying the record of a radiological examination on a CD is not generally known. There is room for active radiology workers who are interested in raising public awareness about radiology examinations. This bachelor?s thesis proved that also lay persons accompanying children are interested in being a part of the team, trying to achieve a beneficial result of the examination. The purpose of the bachelor?s thesis was to prepare a comprehensive text on issues of specifics in paediatric radiology that can be used as supplementary material when examining children...|$|E
