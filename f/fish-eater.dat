5|$|British {{palaeontologist}} David Bruce Norman has stressed how remarkable {{it is that}} Owen, {{who previously}} had propounded that dinosaurs were active quadrupedal animals, largely neglected Scelidosaurus though it {{could serve as a}} prime example of this hypothesis and its fossil {{was one of the most}} complete dinosaurs found at that time. Norman explained this by Owen's excessive workload in this period, including several administrative functions, polemics with fellow-scientists and the study of a large number of even more interesting newly discovered extinct animals, such as Archaeopteryx. Norman also pointed out that Owen in 1861 suggested a lifestyle for Scelidosaurus that is very different from present ideas: it would have been a <b>fish-eater</b> and partially sea-dwelling.|$|E
5|$|In 1986 Charig and Milner first {{suggested}} that its elongated snout with many finely serrated teeth indicated that Baryonyx was piscivorous (a <b>fish-eater),</b> speculating that it crouched on a riverbank and used its claw to gaff {{fish out of}} the water (similar to the modern grizzly bear). In 1984, Taquet pointed out that the spinosaurid snouts from Niger were {{similar to those of the}} modern gharial and suggested a behaviour similar to herons or storks. In 1997 Charig and Milner rejected their initial proposal that the articulation between the premaxilla and maxilla was mobile. In 1987 Andrew Kitchener disputed the piscivorous behaviour of Baryonyx and {{suggested that}} it would have been a scavenger, using its long neck to feed on the ground, its claws to break into a carcass, and its long snout (with nostrils far back for breathing) for investigating the body cavity. Kitchener argued that Baryonyx jaws and teeth were too weak to kill other dinosaurs and too heavy to catch fish, with too many adaptations for piscivory. According to R. E. H. Reid, a scavenged carcass would have been broken up by its predator and large animals capable of doing so—such as grizzly bears—are also capable of catching fish (at least in shallow water).|$|E

40|$|Background: This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} the UK Women's Cohort Study and presents cohort baseline characteristics. Methods: In total, 35 372 women, aged 35 – 69 years at recruitment, were selected to ensure a wide range of dietary intakes. Diet was assessed by a 217 -item food-frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Detailed lifestyle information was collected by postal questionnaire. Vegetarians, <b>fish-eaters</b> and meat-eaters were compared. Results: The cohort women are mainly white, well-educated, middle-class and married with children. They are health-conscious with only 11 % current smokers and 58 % taking dietary supplements. Twenty-eight per cent of subjects self-report as being vegetarian and 1 % as vegan. However, only 18 % are defined as 'vegetarian' from the FFQ. Fat provides 32 % of energy; vitamin and mineral intakes are high, with a broad range of intakes. Meat-eaters are older, with a higher body mass index (BMI) and the lowest intakes of carbohydrate, fibre, vitamin C, folate, iron and calcium. Other <b>fish-eaters</b> are similar to vegetarians. Vegetarians have the lowest intakes of protein, fat and saturated fat. Oily <b>fish-eaters</b> have the lowest BMI; are the least likely to smoke or use full-fat milk; and are the most likely to use dietary supplements and consume the most fruit and vegetables. Oily <b>fish-eaters</b> have the highest total energy intake and vegetarians the lowest. Semi-skimmed milk, bread, potatoes, wine, bananas and muesli are important contributors to energy for all groups...|$|R
500|$|Like {{all members}} of its family, the red-throated loon is {{primarily}} a <b>fish-eater,</b> though it sometimes feeds on molluscs, crustaceans, frogs, aquatic invertebrates, insects, fish spawn or even plant material. It seizes rather than spears its prey, which is generally captured underwater. Though it normally dives and swims using only its feet for propulsion, it may use its wings as well if it needs to turn or accelerate quickly. Pursuit dives range from [...] in depth, with an average underwater time of about a minute. Its fish diet increases the red-throated loon's vulnerability to persistent organic pollutants and heavy metals, both of which bioaccumulate, thus potentially causing greater problems for long-lived species (such as the loon) {{at or near the}} top of the food chain. Its main diet has also led to several of the loon's British folk names, including [...] "sprat borer" [...] and [...] "spratoon".|$|E

Subjects/Methods: This cross-sectional analysis included 392 men, aged 30 – 49 years. Plasma amino acid concentrations were measured with a targeted metabolomic approach using mass spectrometry, and dietary intake was assessed using a food frequency questionnaire. Differences between diet groups in mean plasma concentrations and intakes of amino acids were examined using analysis of variance, controlling for potential confounding factors and multiple testing. Results: In plasma, concentrations of 6 out of 21 amino acids varied significantly by diet group, with differences of − 13 % to + 16 % between meat-eaters and vegans. Concentrations of methionine, tryptophan and tyrosine were highest in <b>fish-eaters</b> and vegetarians, followed by meat-eaters, and lowest in vegans. A broadly similar pattern was seen for lysine, whereas alanine concentration was highest in <b>fish-eaters</b> and lowest in meat-eaters. For glycine, vegans had the highest concentration and meat-eaters the lowest. Intakes of all 18 dietary amino acids differed by diet group; {{for the majority of}} these, intake was highest in meat-eaters followed by <b>fish-eaters,</b> then vegetarians and lowest in vegans (up to 47 % lower than in meat-eaters). Conclusions: Men belonging to different habitual diet groups have significantly different plasma concentrations of lysine, methionine, tryptophan, alanine, glycine and tyrosine.

40|$|Background: Intakes of n- 3 (omega- 3) {{polyunsaturated}} {{fatty acids}} (PUFAs) {{are important for}} health. Because fish is {{the major source of}} eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), non-fish-eaters may have suboptimal n- 3 PUFA status, although the importance of the conversion of plant-derived a-linolenic acid (ALA) to EPA and DHA is debated. Objective: The objective was to determine intakes, food sources, and status of n- 3 PUFAs according to dietary habit (<b>fish-eaters</b> and non-fish-eating meat-eaters, vegetarians, or vegans) and estimated conversion between dietary ALA and circulating long-chain n- 3 PUFAs. Design: This study included 14, 422 men and women aged 39 – 78 y from the EPIC (European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition) -Norfolk cohort with 7 -d diary data and a substudy in 4902 individuals with plasma phospholipid fatty acid measures. Intakes and status of n- 3 PUFAs were measured, and the precursor-product ratio of ALA to circulating n- 3 PUFAs was calculated. Results: Most of the dietary intake of EPA and DHA was supplied by fish; however, meat was the major source in meat-eaters, and spreading fats, soups, and sauces were the major sources in vegetarians. Total n- 3 PUFA intakes were 57 – 80 % lower in non-fish-eaters than in <b>fish-eaters,</b> but status differences were considerably smaller. The estimated precursor-product ratio was greater in women than in men and greater in non-fish-eaters than in <b>fish-eaters.</b> Conclusions: Substantial differences in intakes and in sources of n- 3 PUFAs existed between the dietary-habit groups, but the differences in status were smaller than expected, possibly because the precursor-product ratio was greater in non-fish-eaters than in <b>fish-eaters,</b> potentially indicating increased estimated conversion of ALA. If intervention studies were to confirm these findings, it could have implications for fish requirements...|$|R

60|$|These {{examples}} sufficiently {{indicate how}} divergence of character has acted, and {{has led to}} the adaptation of numerous allied species, each to a more or less special mode of life, with the variety of food, of habits, and of enemies which must necessarily accompany such diversity. And when we extend our inquiries to higher groups we find the same indications of divergence and special adaptation, often to a still more marked extent. Thus we have the larger falcons, which prey upon birds, while some of the smaller species, like the hobby (Falco subbuteo), live largely on insects. The true falcons capture their prey in the air, while the hawks usually seize it on or near the ground, feeding on hares, rabbits, squirrels, grouse, pigeons, and poultry. Kites and buzzards, on the other hand, seize their prey upon the ground, and the former feed largely on reptiles and offal as well as on birds and quadrupeds. Others have adopted fish as their chief food, and the osprey snatches its prey from the water with as much facility as a gull or a petrel; while the South American caracaras (Polyborus) have adopted the habits of vultures and live altogether on carrion. In every great group there is the same divergence of habits. There are ground-pigeons, rock-pigeons, and wood-pigeons,--seed-eating pigeons and fruit-eating pigeons; there are carrion-eating, insect-eating, and fruit-eating crows. Even kingfishers are, some aquatic, some terrestrial in their habits; some live on fish, some on insects, some on reptiles. Lastly, among the primary divisions of birds we find a purely terrestrial group--the Ratitae, including the ostriches, cassowaries, etc.; other great groups, including the ducks, cormorants, gulls, penguins, etc., are aquatic; while the bulk of the Passerine birds are aerial and arboreal. The same general facts can be detected in all other classes of animals. In the mammalia, for example, we have in the common rat a <b>fish-eater</b> and flesh-eater as well as a grain-eater, which has no doubt helped to give it the power of spreading over the world and driving away the native rats of other countries. Throughout the Rodent tribe we find everywhere aquatic, terrestrial, and arboreal forms. In the weasel and cat tribes some live more in trees, others on the ground; squirrels have diverged into terrestrial, arboreal, and flying species; and finally, in the bats we have a truly aerial, and in the whales a truly aquatic order of mammals. We thus see that, beginning with different varieties of the same species, we have allied species, genera, families, and orders, with similarly divergent habits, and adaptations to different modes of life, indicating some general principle in nature which has been operative {{in the development of the}} organic world. But in order to be thus operative it must be a generally useful principle, and Mr. Darwin has very clearly shown us in what this utility consists.|$|E

DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis of self-reported dietary, anthropometric and lifestyle data. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 37875 healthy men and women aged 20 - 97 y participating in EPIC-Oxford. RESULTS: Age-adjusted mean BMI was significantly different between the four diet groups, being highest in the meat-eaters (24. 41 kg/m(2) in men, 23. 52 kg/m(2) in women) and lowest in the vegans (22. 49 kg/m(2) in men, 21. 98 kg/m(2) in women). <b>Fish-eaters</b> and vegetarians had similar, intermediate mean BMI.

Serum concentrations of total, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, as well as apolipoproteins A-I and B were measured, and serum non-HDL cholesterol was calculated. RESULTS: Vegans had the lowest body mass index (BMI) and the highest and lowest intakes of polyunsaturated and saturated fat, respectively. After adjustment for age, alcohol and physical activity, compared with meat-eaters, <b>fish-eaters</b> and vegetarians, serum concentrations of total and non-HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein B were significantly lower in vegans. Serum apolipoprotein A-I concentrations did not differ between the diet groups.

The objective {{of this study was}} to estimate the difference in dietary GHG emissions between self-selected meat-eaters, <b>fish-eaters,</b> vegetarians and vegans in the UK. Subjects were participants in the EPIC-Oxford cohort study. The diets of 2, 041 vegans, 15, 751 vegetarians, 8, 123 <b>fish-eaters</b> and 29, 589 meat-eaters aged 20 – 79 were assessed using a validated food frequency questionnaire. Comparable GHG emissions param-eters were developed for the underlying food codes using a dataset of GHG emissions for 94 food commodities in the UK, with a weighting for the global warming potential of each component gas. The average GHG emissions associated with a standard 2, 000 kcal diet were estimated for all subjects. ANOVAwas used to estimate average dietary GHG emissions by diet group adjusted for sex and age. The age-and-sex-adjusted mean (95 % confidence interval) GHG emissions in kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalents per day (kgCO 2 e/day) were 7. 19 (7. 16, 7. 22) for high meat-eaters (>= 100 g/d), 5. 63 (5. 61, 5. 65) for medium meat-eaters (50 - 99 g/d), 4. 67 (4. 65, 4. 70) for low meat-eaters (< 50 g/d), 3. 91 (3. 88, 3. 94) for <b>fish-eaters,</b> 3. 81 (3. 79, 3. 83) for vegetarians and 2. 89 (2. 83, 2. 94) for vegans.
