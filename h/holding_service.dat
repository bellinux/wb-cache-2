5000|$|Calvin Leon Graham (April 3, 1930 - November 6, 1992) was the {{youngest}} U.S. serviceman to serve and fight during World War II. Following the attack on Pearl Harbor, he enlisted in the United States Navy from Houston, Texas on August 15, 1942, {{at the age of}} 12. [...] His case was similar to that of Jack W.

[...] Even this claim is slightly dubious, however, since between 1920 and 1940, the Marine Corps left approximately forty thousand service numbers un-issued, meaning that the [...] "true" [...] one millionth service number would be slightly higher than #1,060,000.|$|E

50|$|In 1701 English {{minister}} Thomas Bray {{formed the}} Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts (SPG) {{to minister to}} the new English settlers. In 1711 a group of Anglicans were <b>holding</b> <b>service</b> in an old broken down townhouse inPiscataway that they shared {{with a group of}} Baptists. Under the influence of William Skinner, an SPG minister, in 1717 a timber frame church was built, which was completed in 1724, to replace the broken down townhouse. St. James Parish in Piscataway continued to grow, including members from higher up the Raritan River in New Brunswick. The demand was so great that a group gathered in 1742 to construct another church, to be called Christ Church, on the New Brunswick side of the River.|$|E

50|$|This was {{a rematch}} of the 2009 Australian Open final, which Rafael Nadal won {{to become the}} first (and to date, only) Spaniard to win the Australian Open title; as of 2017 it remains his only title at the tournament. The final saw the two <b>holding</b> <b>service</b> for six games of the first set, whilst during the seventh game was the pivotal break of serve giving Federer the opening set. Nadal quickly broke Federer's serve in the second set racing out to a lead that Federer could not overcome, giving him the second set and {{leveling}} the match at one set apiece. The third set was a rather lopsided affair seeing Nadal secure his service game only in the fourth game of the set. The fourth set started off competitively with the two holding serve, until Nadal broke in the fourth game of the set, a lead he would never surrender, evening the match at two sets apiece. The decisive fifth set commenced with a break of Federer's serve by Nadal, giving him a lead in the early going; however, Nadal's serve got broken during the sixth game of the set, leveling the match at two sets and three games apiece. Federer won the next three games breaking Nadal's service in the eighth game of the set to allow him to successfully serve out the match in the final ninth game. This was Roger Federer's 18 Grand Slam singles title, the most ever by a man in the history of tennis, and it was his fifth Australian Open title, just one shy of the record co-held by Novak Djokovic and Roy Emerson.|$|E

40|$|Improving {{governance}} {{is central}} to improving results in human development. It is clear that money is not enough: improved outcomes from service delivery require better governance, including mechanisms for <b>holding</b> <b>service</b> providers accountable and appropriate incentives for performance. There is therefore a growing demand for indicators to measure how and whether these processes work, and how they affect health and education results. This paper makes the case for measuring governance policies and performance, {{and the quality of}} service delivery in health and education. It develops a framework for selecting and measuring a set of indicators and proposes options, drawing from new and innovative measurement tools and approaches. The paper proposes the adoption of a more systematic approach that will both facilitate the work of health and education policymakers and allow for cross-country comparisons and benchmarking.

Ingredients desirable for successful performance contracts are explored in this paper. Although the research cannot conclusively attribute performance contract to more effective and efficient service delivery, it does provide evidence of expanded use of performance contracts and the potential for improved accountability and service delivery relationship between state government and nonprofits. In part {{as a result of the}} New Public Management, government organizations are devolving their responsibilities for services. This includes from the national government to states to local governments, as well as from government to non-profit and for profit organizations. The phenomenon of increasingly privatized government services and its implication for an enhanced role for the nonprofit sector in the United States is well-documented throughout much of the public administration literature. Performance contracts are viewed as a method for <b>holding</b> <b>service</b> providers accountable for outcomes. Yet, despite their increasing popularity, many questions about this emerging trend have remained largely unanswered. A team of researchers(1) from the University of Delaware has been involved in studying various aspects of the relationship in the contractual arrangement between state government, human service agencies and non-profit organizations. This paper will focus on the performance contract arrangements with the research questions: What is the impetus in government and the nonprofit sector in Delaware to implement performance contracts? What agencies are involved in the performance contracts? And finally, is it leadership, mandated requirements or both that promote the performance contract arrangement? The methodology includes quantitative and qualitative data from on-line surveys conducted with nonprofit and government agencies, in person interviews with performance contract administrators and nonprofit recipients, focus group, and a workgroup that has been meeting to address issues around performance measurement and evaluation. The theoretical framework will be established through the literature on the subjects of performance contracting and leadership. The research methods consisted of a series of 44 in-person interviews, administration of two separate online surveys for a total of 111 online responses, document analysis, and focus groups. These are discussed in greater detail in the case study...|$|E

40|$|Overview The {{consumer}} {{movement of the}} 20 th century greatly advanced consumer rights such {{as the right to}} satisfaction of basic needs, the right to safety, the right to be informed, and the right to choose. In the digital age of the 21 st century, technological innovation is challenging policymakers in ensuring consumer rights and protections are at the centre of policy. This Guide highlights current consumer rights and protections in place in the communications industry in Australia and the debate around them. There are a series of complex consumer rights and protections in place in the telecommunications sector through an approach that has favoured self-regulation via a series of industry codes and some statutory obligations. However, due in part to large increases in the number of complaints handled by the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman, there is currently increased attention on customer service and consumer protection. ACCAN Calls for ‘smart’ regulation in the communications sector by entrenching consumer rights and positive outcomes at the centre of communications policy, and <b>holding</b> <b>service</b> providers accountable for minimum benchmarks of customer service while allowing them flexibility to innovate. Smart regulation is also about looking to the future where telecommunications, the Internet and other areas are converging, and ensuring that consumers are central to regulation across the economy. Such approaches can be seen to take shape in locales internationally. The amount of regulatory intervention on behalf of consumers is a contentious matter, however. Some believe that market forces will largely protect consumers, as it will ensure that suppliers have incentive to provide quality products at a reasonable price. There is great debate on this topic, including theories such as those from behavioural economics to consider.   Key resources Consumer Rights Consumers International Comment: The right to satisfaction of basic needs;  The right to safety; The right to be informed;   The right to choose; The right to be heard; The right to redress; The right to consumer education; The right to a healthy environment; READ THE FULL TEXT:  Consumer rights  (HTML) [...] United Nation Guidelines for Consumer Protection United Nations Comment: The UN General Principles set out the legitimate needs of consumers including the protection of consumers from hazards to their health and safety; the promotion and protection of the economic interests of consumers;  consumer access to adequate information to enable making informed choices according to individual wishes and needs and more.
