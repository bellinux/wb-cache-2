5|$|The camp's {{commanding}} officer Major General J. Franklin Bell called Berlin <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>office</b> <b>and</b> asked the showman {{to raise funds}} for a new community house to lodge families of service members who visited the camp. The projected expense of the project was $35,000.

5|$|Shortly {{after being}} hired {{he was taken}} aside by the news {{producer}} and asked to read the on-air bulletin for the nightly broadcast. He read the news for three months until one night when he condensed a six-minute bulletin into three minutes. He attributed this to stage fright, which caused him to speak too fast. The rest of the production crew were not {{ready to move on}} to the next news items, leaving Harries standing in silence for several minutes. Harries recalled in a 2007 interview that Steve Morrison, the producer of the bulletin, called him <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>office</b> <b>and</b> berated him, telling him he did not deserve to be on television and that he would no longer be reading the news. Morrison's remarks angered Harries to such a point that he assaulted the man. Aware that he was going to lose his job, he contacted a Granada colleague who got him a new job at Granada's London centre, which he took up at the age of 23.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{his arrival}} in Washington, Lombardi was aware of tight end Jerry Smith's sexual orientation. “Lombardi {{protected}} and loved Jerry,” said former teammate Dave Kopay. Lombardi brought Smith <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>office</b> <b>and</b> {{told him that his}} sexual orientation would never be an issue {{as long as he was}} coaching the Redskins; Smith would be judged solely on his on-the-field performance and contribution to the team's success. Under Lombardi's leadership Smith flourished, becoming an integral part of Lombardi's offense, and was voted a First Team All-Pro for the first time in his career, which was also Lombardi's only season as Redskin head coach.|$|E

Duty soon released six of the hostages unharmed, and let nurse Virginia Nelson go about two hours later.

25|$|The {{day after}} the decision, Gould says, Truesdale came <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>office</b> <b>and</b> {{subjected}} him to loud verbal abuse (which devolved into a shouting match) because Truesdale was upset that Gould had spoken to the New York Times about the Board's decision. Gould lunched with Mikva after the incident, at which time Mikva allegedly counseled Gould to allow Truesdale and the other Board members to write opinions supporting their votes in this high-profile case. Gould was unwilling to do this, and told Mikva that Truesdale was too deferential to the General Counsel's requests to make that a valuable exercise. On March 28, Gould learned that Truesdale was about to publish comments critical of Gould's contacts with the press during the baseball strike. Gould asked Mikva if the White House {{would be willing to}} privately discipline Truesdale, but Mikva indicated it would not.|$|E
25|$|In 1896, {{three years}} after {{submitting}} his thesis on the Kerr effect, he disobeyed the direct orders of his supervisor and used laboratory equipment to measure the splitting of spectral lines by a strong magnetic field. He was fired for his efforts, but he was later vindicated: he won the 1902 Nobel Prize in Physics for the discovery of what has now {{become known as the}} Zeeman effect. As an extension of his thesis research, he began investigating the effect of magnetic fields on a light source. He discovered that a spectral line is split into several components {{in the presence of a}} magnetic field. Lorentz first heard about Zeeman's observations on Saturday 31 October 1896 at the meeting of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in Amsterdam, where these results were communicated by Kamerlingh Onnes. The next Monday, Lorentz called Zeeman <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>office</b> <b>and</b> presented him with an explanation of his observations, based on Lorentz's theory of electromagnetic radiation.|$|E
