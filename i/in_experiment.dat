25|$|Several {{experiments}} varied {{the immediacy}} of the teacher and learner. Generally, when the victim's physical immediacy was increased, the participant's compliance decreased. The participant's compliance also decreased when the authority's physical immediacy decreased (Experiments 1–4). For example, <b>in</b> <b>Experiment</b> 2, where participants received telephonic instructions from the experimenter, compliance decreased to 21 percent. Interestingly, some participants deceived the experimenter by pretending to continue the experiment. In the variation where the learner's physical immediacy was closest, where participants had to hold the learner's arm physically onto a shock plate, compliance decreased. Under that condition, 30 percent of participants completed the experiment.|$|E

[...] Milinski and Heller's findings have been corroborated both <b>in</b> <b>experiment</b> and computer simulations.

2500|$|Unlike {{researchers}} {{now using}} {{the test for}} psychological evaluation, Stroop used only the three basic scores, rather than more complex derivative scoring procedures. Stroop noted that participants took significantly longer to complete the color reading in the second task than they had taken to name {{the colors of the}} squares <b>in</b> <b>Experiment</b> 2. This delay had not appeared in the first experiment. Such interference were explained by the automation of reading, where the mind automatically determines the semantic meaning of the word (it reads the word [...] "red" [...] and thinks of the color [...] "red"), and then must intentionally check itself and identify instead the color of the word (the ink is a color other than red), a process that is not automated.|$|E
