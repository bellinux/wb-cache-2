Chief Justice Gleeson and Justices Gummow and Kirby dissented, finding instead that the Migration Act should not be interpreted to permit <b>indefinite</b> detention.|$|E
5|$|Adjectives are inflected in two declensions—indefinite and definite—and {{they must}} match the noun they modify in gender and number. The <b>indefinite</b> neuter and plural forms of an {{adjective}} are usually created {{by adding a}} suffix (-t or -a) to the common form of the adjective, e.g., en grön stol (a green chair), ett grönt hus (a green house), and gröna stolar ("green chairs").

40|$|Locative {{sentences}} {{containing a}} <b>indefinites</b> exhibit {{a variety of}} non-existential interpretations. This understudied phenomenon is especially problematic for traditional theories that treat <b>indefinites</b> as denoting existential quantifiers. We propose a solution where <b>indefinites</b> denote properties and are assigned locations similarly to other spatial descriptions. This property-based analysis accounts for new observations about the correlation between non-existential interpretations of locative <b>indefinites</b> and similar geometrical effects with entity-denoting NPs. Thereby, the proposal opens up a new empirical domain for property-based theories of <b>indefinites,</b> with implications {{for the analysis of}} generics, collective descriptions, negative polarity items and part-whole structure. ...|$|R

5|$|The {{class of}} determiners {{is used to}} specify the noun they precede in terms of {{definite}}ness, where the marks a definite noun and a or an an <b>indefinite</b> one. A definite noun is assumed by the speaker to be already known by the interlocutor, whereas an <b>indefinite</b> noun is not specified as being previously known. Quantifiers, which include one, many, some and all, are used to specify the noun in terms of quantity or number. The noun must agree {{with the number of}} the determiner, e.g. one man (sg.) but all men (pl.). Determiners are the first constituents in a noun phrase.|$|E
40|$|This {{paper offers}} a formal {{account of the}} diachronic changes in the {{interaction}} between <b>indefinites</b> in the scope of negation and the expression of sentential negation {{in the history of}} Low German. Different types of negative concord develop at the different historical stages. Parallel to that, the language underwent Jespersen's Cycle. In addition, I argue that, against common belief, Jespersen's Cycle is at best indirectly related to the type of interaction between <b>indefinites</b> and negation. Changes in the type of <b>indefinites</b> used in the scope of negation arise due to changes in the lexical properties of the <b>indefinites</b> involved, not as a result of changes in the expression of negation. Conversely, changes in the type of <b>indefinites</b> do not trigger changes in the expression of negation...|$|R
40|$|Across languages, we find <b>indefinites</b> that overtly mark a speaker’s lack of knowledge: they {{signal that}} the speaker is unable to give any further {{information}} about who or what satisfies her existential claim (Becker, 1999; Haspelmath, 1997). From now on, we will refer to the marking of the speaker’s lack of knowledge as an epistemic effect and to the <b>indefinites</b> that induce epistemic effects as epistemic <b>indefinites...</b>|$|R
40|$|The paper {{proposes a}} novel {{solution}} to the problem of scope posed by natural language <b>indefinites</b> that captures both the difference in scopal freedom between <b>indefinites</b> and bona fide quantifiers and the syntactic sensitivity that the scope of <b>indefinites</b> does nevertheless exhibit. Following the main insight of choice functional approaches, we connect the special scopal properties of <b>indefinites</b> to the fact that their semantics can be stated in terms of choosing a suitable witness. This is in contrast to bona fide quantifiers, the semantics of which crucially involves relations between sets of entities. We provide empirical arguments that this insight should not be captured by adding choice/Skolem functions to classical first-order logic, but in a semantics that follows Independence-Friendly Logic, in which scopal relations involving existentials are part of the recursive definition of truth and satisfaction. These scopal relations are resolved automatically as part of the interpretation of existentials. Additional support for this approach is provided by dependent <b>indefinites,</b> a cross-linguistically common class of special <b>indefinites</b> that can be straightforwardly analyzed in our semantic framework...|$|R

40|$|Spanish as a Romance {{language}} has a determiner system, but {{also allows for}} the presence of nominals without determiners. Some recent literature (Espinal and McNally, 2009; Espinal, 2010) accounts for the difference between Spanish bare nominals and singular <b>indefinites</b> and claims that whereas BNs denote properties of types of individuals, regular <b>indefinites</b> denote entities. The aim of this thesis is to explore the manifestation of this semantic distinction in terms of the discourse referential properties of BNs and regular <b>indefinites.</b> Three experiments are carried out in which their capacity to introduce referential expressions in discourse is examined. Two of the experiments are pen and paper questionnaires and the third experiment is a corpus study. Results show that BNs and regular <b>indefinites</b> present dissimilar behaviors under different forms in discourse. Such results go along with the initial hypothesis that BNs are not able to introduce discourse referents, whereas regular <b>indefinites</b> are...|$|R

40|$|Sometimes exceptional-scope <b>indefinites</b> are {{understood}} {{as if they}} refer to a specific individual or function, sometimes they {{are understood}} {{as if there is}} existential closure of a function variable from the exceptional-scope site. So-called contextualist accounts of these <b>indefinites</b> fail to account for the apparently non-specific exceptional scope readings. Accounts invoking a mechanism of free existential closure generate unattested readings in addition to failing to account for readings in a wider array of cases. Starting with the assumption that all exceptionalscope <b>indefinites</b> are specific, a third account is presented here which employs independently motivated pragmatic strategies of diagonalisation and accommodation. It will be shown how specific <b>indefinites</b> come to be understood as if some mechanism of free-existential closure were in operation. But it will be clear where this closure effect comes from and what constraints there are on it. 1...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} I provide a decompositional {{analysis}} of {{three kinds of}} plural <b>indefinites</b> in two related languages, European Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese. The three <b>indefinites</b> studied are bare plurals, the unos (Spanish) /uns (Portuguese) type, and the algunos (Spanish) /alguns (Portuguese) type. The paper concentrates on four properties: semantic plurality, positive polarity, partitivity, and event distribution. The logic underlying the analysis is that of compositionality, applied at the subword level: as items become bigger in form (with the addition of morphemes), they also acquire more semantic properties.

40|$|International audienceThe chapter {{proposes a}} {{semantic}} analysis of Italian imperfective sentences which uniformly accounts for their habitual and progressive readings. Bare imperfectives with singular <b>indefinites</b> in object position are considered, and the observation is made that singular <b>indefinites</b> systematically {{give rise to}} "same object" (SO) effects in these contexts, sometimes making the containing sentence odd on a habitual interpretation. It is further noted that SO effects are absent if a Q-adverb occurs in the sentence, showing that singular <b>indefinites</b> can distribute over Q-adverbs, {{while there is no}} underlying generic quantifier over which singular <b>indefinites</b> can distribute. These observations are taken to motivate a non-quantificational account of imperfective habituals, based on a semantic analysis of verbs in terms of plural events (Kratzer 2008) and a modal/temporal analysis of imperfective aspect as a forward-expanding operator in a branching time model (Deo 2010). On the proposed account, the repetition involved in habituals does not depend on any underlying quantifier but uniquely comes from verbal plurality...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} a new scope puzzle that arises through the interaction of two lesser-studied constructions, dependent <b>indefinites</b> and verbal pluractionality. The result is a novel account of dependent <b>indefinites</b> that correctly predicts their grammaticality with pluractionals by recognizing two ways of establishing the covariation they require: (i) true distributive quantifiers, and (ii) pluractional operators that structure thematic dependencies. The core insight is that both routes, while compositionally different, lead to similar output structures in Dynamic Plural Logic (DPlL) (van den Berg 1996) or its closely related alternatives (Brasoveanu 2008, Nouwen 2003), which is what dependent <b>indefinites</b> constrain. The analysis not only permits {{a better understanding of}} dependent <b>indefinites</b> in Kaqchikel, an endangered and understudied Mayan language of highland Guatemala, but it clarifies their place in a crosslinguistic typology of similar expressions (e. g., Balusu 2006, Choe 1987, Farkas 1997 a, 2002, Yanovich 2005). Along the way we produce the first description and analysis of these phenomena in Kaqchikel. [URL] BibTeX info</a...|$|R
