25|$|Activation is {{performed}} with a utility supplied with Windows and Office called the Activation Wizard. It {{can be performed}} either over the Internet or by telephone. When activating over the Internet, the Activation Wizard automatically transmits and receives verification data to and from Microsoft servers, completing the process without any interaction by the user. Activation by telephone requires that a user and a Microsoft agent verbally exchange activation information. In this case, an <b>installation</b> <b>ID</b> is generated, which is then read to the agent. The agent verifies the information and replies with a confirmation ID, which is then typed into the Activation Wizard.|$|E
5000|$|In one form, product {{activation}} {{refers to}} a method invented by Ric Richardson and patented (...) by Uniloc where a software application hashes hardware serial numbers and an ID number specific to the product's license (a product key) to generate a unique <b>installation</b> <b>ID.</b> This <b>installation</b> <b>ID</b> {{is sent to the}} manufacturer to verify the authenticity of the product key and to ensure that the product key is not being used for multiple installations.|$|E

50|$|There are {{currently}} four different variants of CACs. The Geneva Conventions Identification Card {{is the most}} common CAC and is given to active duty/reserve armed forces and uniformed service members. The Geneva Convention Accompany Forces Card is issued to emergency-essential civilian personnel. The ID and Privilege Common Access Card is for civilians residing on military <b>installations.</b> The <b>ID</b> card is for DOD/Government Agency identification for civilian employees.|$|R
40|$|DESY {{presently}} operates 14 independent {{insertion device}} (ID) beamlines at its 6 GeV storage ring PETRA III. Besides the 2 m long standard undulators U 29 and U 32, several special IDs {{of up to}} 5 m length have been installed to meet the experimental requests for high energy X-rays, elliptically polarized light, and {{a higher degree of}} coherence. Two additional half octants of the ring have recently been reconstructed, in order to extend the experimental capabilities at PETRA III. The straight sections also allow for <b>installation</b> of <b>IDs</b> of 2 m or 5 m length. This article gives an overview of the ID key parameters, the spectral properties and the brilliance of the current undulators installed at PETRA III. It also presents the characteristics of so me of the upcoming special IDs, like in-vacuum and short undulators...|$|R
5000|$|While DangerOS uses [...]jar {{files for}} applications, they are {{uploaded}} to the device in special files called [...] "bundles". Bundle files have the extension '.bndl'. Each bundle file {{is linked to}} a specific operating system version and build number. For example, a bundle file for v3.4/155053 (T-Mobile Sidekick 3) would be denied installation on a v3.3/149695 device (T-Mobile Sidekick <b>iD).</b> <b>Installation</b> of bundles require a developer key to be installed on your device {{if you are using}} a Production OS. Internal OS builds do not require developer keys.|$|R
50|$|The {{basic unit}} for the ID PMTs is a “supermodule”, a frame which {{supports}} a 3×4 array of PMTs. Supermodule frames are 2.1 m in height, 2.8 m in width and 0.55 m in thickness. These frames {{are connected to}} each other in both the vertical and horizontal directions. Then the whole support structure is connected {{to the bottom of the}} tank and to the top structure. In addition to serving as rigid structural elements, supermodules simplified the initial assembly of the ID. Each supermodule was assembled on the tank floor and then hoisted into its final position. Thus the ID is in effect tiled with supermodules. During <b>installation,</b> <b>ID</b> PMTs were pre-assembled in units of three for easy installation. Each supermodule has two OD PMTs attached on its back side. The support structure for the bottom PMTs is attached to the bottom of the stainless-steel tank by one vertical beam per supermodule frame. The support structure for the top of the tank is also used as the support structure for the top PMTs.|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} summary of {{non-linear}} beam dynamics study in CANDLE, a project of a third generation intermediate energy light source. The study includes the effects of non-linear fields both in the storage ring magnet system and insertion devices. The results of analytical approach and tracking simulation study are discussed. 1 RING LATTICE PARAMETERS The present CANDLE storage ring lattice design consists of 16 identical straight sections, 13 of which are available for Insertion Devices (ID). Each straight section has a length of 4. 8 m with 4 m available for <b>installation</b> of <b>IDs.</b> Because the CANDLE beam emittance is larger than diffraction limited emittance for expected photon wavelength range, we find the lattice optical functions at the middle of straight section (horizontal beta 7. 89 m and vertical beta 4. 87 m) are an optimal one for both machine reliable and radiated photon beam quality point of view [1].

40|$|The French {{national}} {{synchrotron radiation}} source SOLEIL is planned {{to start operation}} in 2006 with several different insertion devices installed in the storage ring either from "day one " or within the first year. The list of high-priority insertion devices (IDs) includes: 640 mm period fast-switching elliptical electromagnet undulator, offering advanced possibilities for fine-tuning of polarization states of the emitted radiation, three electromagnet elliptical undulators with 256 mm period, three 80 mm period APPLE-II type permanent-magnet undulators, and three 20 mm period planar hybrid in-vacuum undulators. The emission of all these undulators will cover wide spectral range extending from UV to hard X-rays. The conceptual design of all the IDs was done by SOLEIL; the final design and construction {{will be made by}} industrial companies and institutions with production capabilities. Before <b>installation,</b> all the <b>IDs</b> will be measured in the SOLEIL magnetic measurements lab. The paper describes peculiarities of the magnetic design, and the estimated optical performance of the SOLEIL undulators in various modes of operation...|$|R
