However, shorter running periods, typically one month per year, with heavy-ion collisions {{are included in}} the programme. While lighter ions are considered as well, the baseline scheme deals with lead ions (see A Large Ion Collider Experiment). The lead ions are first accelerated by the linear accelerator LINAC 3, and the Low Energy Ion Ring (LEIR) is used as an <b>ion</b> <b>storage</b> and cooler unit. The ions are then further accelerated by the PS and SPS before being injected into LHC ring, where they reached an energy of 2.3 TeV per nucleon (or 522 TeV per ion), higher than the energies reached by the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider. The aim of the heavy-ion programme is to investigate quark–gluon plasma, which existed in the early universe.|$|E

25|$|The {{transverse}} Doppler {{effect and}} consequently time dilation was directly observed {{for the first}} time in the Ives–Stilwell experiment (1938). In modern Ives-Stilwell experiments in heavy <b>ion</b> <b>storage</b> rings using saturated spectroscopy, the maximum measured deviation of time dilation from the relativistic prediction has been limited to ≤10−8. Other confirmations of time dilation include Mössbauer rotor experiments in which gamma rays were sent from the middle of a rotating disc to a receiver at the edge of the disc, so that the transverse Doppler effect can be evaluated by means of the Mössbauer effect. By measuring the lifetime of muons in the atmosphere and in particle accelerators, the time dilation of moving particles was also verified. On the other hand, the Hafele–Keating experiment confirmed the twin paradox, i.e. that a clock moving from A to B back to A is retarded with respect to the initial clock. However, in this experiment the effects of general relativity also play an essential role.|$|E

Meanwhile, the synchrotron radiation based research at ISA was expanding, and by 1995 ASTRID was operated 50% of the time in <b>ion</b> <b>storage</b> mode and 50% for synchrotron radiation. With the construction of the Electrostatic Storage Ring for Ions (ELISA) in 1998, and an increasing demand for synchrotron radiation (by 2000 there were 7 beamlines on ASTRID using the light source), the <b>ion</b> <b>storage</b> runs were gradually reduced, until finally in 2005 ASTRID operated in <b>ion</b> <b>storage</b> mode for the last time. Since then ASTRID has been operating in electron storage mode producing synchrotron radiation throughout the year, with 3 or 4 electron runs, separated by shutdown periods for maintenance and development of the ring.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{report on}} the first laser cooling of a bunched beam of {{multiply}} charged C 3 + ions performed at the ESR (GSI) at a beam energy of E = 1. 47 GeV. Moderate bunching provided a force counteracting the decelerating laser force of one counterpropagating laser beam. This versatile type of laser cooling lead to longitudinally space-charge dominated beams with an unprecedented momentum spread of ∆p/p ≈ 10 − 7. Concerning the beam energy and charge state of the ion, the experiment depicts an important intermediate step from the established field of laser cooling of ion beams at low energies toward the unique laser cooling scheme proposed for relativistic beams of highly charged heavy ions at SIS 300 (FAIR).

40|$|Borophene, the boron atom {{analogue}} to graphene, being atomic thick {{have been}} just recently experimentally fabricated. In this work, we employ first-principles density functional theory calculations to investigate the interaction of Ca, Mg, Na or Li atoms with single-layer and free-standing borophene. We first identified the most stable binding sites and their corresponding binding energies as well and then we gradually increased the ions concentration. Our calculations predict strong binding energies of around 4. 03 eV, 2. 09 eV, 2. 92 eV and 3. 28 eV between the borophene substrate and Ca, Mg, Na or Li ions, respectively. We found that the binding energy generally decreases by increasing the ions content. Using the Bader charge analysis, we evaluate the charge transfer between the adatoms and the borophene sheet. Our investigation proposes the borophene as a 2 D material with a remarkably high capacity of around 800 mAh/g, 1960 mAh/g, 1380 mAh/g and 1720 mAh/g for Ca, Mg, Na or Li <b>ions</b> <b>storage,</b> respectively.

The film is made of two vertically aligned multi-walled carbon nanotube (VANT) electrodes that store ions, embedded-in, and monolithically interspaced by a solution of microcrystalline cellulose in a room temperature ionic liquid (RTIL) electrolyte (1 -ethyl- 3 -methylimidazolium acetate-EMIM Ac). The fine tuning of VANTs length and electrolyte/cellulose amount leads, in a sole and continuous block, to <b>ions</b> <b>storage</b> and physical separation between the electrodes without the need of the additional separator layer that is typically used in supercapacitors. Thus, physical discontinuities that can induce disturbances to ions mobility, are fully eliminated significantly reducing the equivalent series resistance and increasing the knee frequency, hence outclassing the best supercapacitors based on VANTs and non-aqueous electrolytes.
