5|$|In late 1930 Goebbels met Magda Quandt, a divorcée who {{had joined}} the party a few months earlier. She worked as a {{volunteer}} in the party offices in Berlin, helping Goebbels organize his private papers. Her <b>flat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Reichskanzlerplatz soon became a favourite meeting place for Hitler and other NSDAP officials. Goebbels and Quandt married on 19 December 1931.|$|E
5|$|When {{disturbed}} at its roosting site, {{an angry}} barn owl lowers {{its head and}} sways it from side to side, or the head may be lowered and stretched forward and the wings drooped while the bird emits hisses and makes snapping noises with its beak.

5|$|With the {{exception}} of A.laevigatum, all species have a thin separating layer, the cortex, between the hymenium and the tomentum. A cortex is also present on many Stereum fungi (on a broader front) and serves to bend up the fruit body. As this cortex is missing on A.laevigatum, its fruit body lies <b>flat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bark.|$|E

5|$|A normal dog has {{a muscular}} {{appearance}} {{with a deep}} chest and strong legs. The French Spaniel has eyes of a dark amber colour, and a thick tail that tapers towards the tip. The hair is medium, dense, with long feathers on the ears, backs of the legs and tail. It has some waviness on the chest and otherwise lies <b>flat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> body. The normal colour of a French Spaniel's coat is white with brown markings rather in shade from a light cinnamon to dark liver. Historically, the coat was only white with black markings, but the breed was mixed with other colours of Spaniels during the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|In fish {{such as the}} herring which live in {{shallower}} water, {{the mirrors}} must reflect a mixture of wavelengths, and the fish accordingly has crystal stacks {{with a range of}} different spacings. A further complication for fish with bodies that are rounded in cross-section is that the mirrors would be ineffective if laid <b>flat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> skin, as they would fail to reflect horizontally. The overall mirror effect is achieved with many small reflectors, all oriented vertically. Silvering is found in other marine animals as well as fish. The cephalopods, including squid, octopus and cuttlefish, have multi-layer mirrors made of protein rather than guanine.|$|E
5|$|Settlements of the Gold Rush era, such as Portuguese <b>Flat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Sacramento River, sprang into {{existence}} and then faded.

5|$|The pilot lay <b>flat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lower wing, as planned, {{to reduce}} {{aerodynamic}} drag. As a glide ended, {{the pilot was}} supposed to lower himself to a vertical position through {{an opening in the}} wing and land on his feet with his arms wrapped over the framework. Within a few glides, however, they discovered the pilot could remain prone on the wing, headfirst, without undue danger when landing. They made all their flights in that position for the next five years.|$|E
5|$|The wings lie <b>flat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{body and}} are very {{variable}} in size between species, being reduced in size in some crickets and missing in others. The fore wings are elytra made of tough chitin, acting as a protective shield for the soft {{parts of the body}} and in males, bear the stridulatory organs for the production of sound. The hind pair is membranous, folding fan-wise under the fore wings. In many species, the wings are not adapted for flight.|$|E
5|$|Although most of {{the miners}} left, either to return home or settle elsewhere, some stayed {{to work in the}} {{ranching}} and logging industries that became the economic mainstay of the Trinity River area. Some also continued to search for gold long after the major deposits were gone; even today, recreational gold panning remains a popular activity along the Trinity. One Mr. Jorstad who had been mining in the Trinity River country since the 1930s, continued to live in a small cabin at Pfeiffer <b>Flat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> North Fork until his death in 1989. Jorstad's cabin was an important rest stop for miners, hunters, hikers and fishermen along the North Fork for many years; it remains as a historical site maintained by the Forest Service.|$|E

5|$|Jean-Michel Jarre {{was born}} in Lyon on 24 August 1948, to France Pejot, a French Resistance member and {{concentration}} camp survivor, and composer Maurice Jarre. When Jarre was five, his parents split up and his father moved to America, leaving him with his mother. He did not see his father again until reaching the age of 18. For the first eight years of his life, Jarre spent six months each year at his maternal grandparents' <b>flat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Cours de Verdun, in the Perrache district of Lyon. Jarre's grandfather was an oboe player, engineer and inventor, designing an early audio mixer used at Radio Lyon. He also gave Jean-Michel his first record player. From his vantage point high above the pavement, the young French boy was able to watch street performers at work, an experience he later cited as proving influential on his art.|$|E
5|$|Rose Beuret and Rodin {{returned}} to Paris in 1877, {{moving into a}} small <b>flat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Left Bank. Misfortune surrounded Rodin: his mother, who had {{wanted to see her}} son marry, was dead, and his father was blind and senile, cared for by Rodin's sister-in-law, Aunt Thérèse. Rodin's eleven-year-old son Auguste, possibly developmentally delayed, was also in the ever-helpful Thérèse's care. Rodin had essentially abandoned his son for six years, and would have a very limited relationship with him throughout his life. Father and son now joined the couple in their flat, with Rose as caretaker. The charges of fakery surrounding The Age of Bronze continued. Rodin increasingly sought more soothing female companionship in Paris, and Rose stayed in the background.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} March 1801, Jean-François left Figeac for Grenoble, {{which he}} reached on the 27th of March, and where Jacques-Joseph lived in a two-room <b>flat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> rue Neuve. Jacques-Joseph was then working as an {{assistant}} in the import-export company Chatel, Champollion and Rif, yet taught his brother to read, and supported his education. His brother also may {{have been part of}} the source of Champollion's interest in Egypt, since as a young man he wanted to join Napoleon's Egyptian expedition, and often regretted not being able to go. Often known as the younger brother of better known Jacques-Joseph, Jean-François was often called Champollion le Jeune (the young). Later when his brother became the more famous of the two, Jacques added the town of his birth as a second surname and hence is often referred to as Champollion-Figeac, in contrast to his brother Champollion. Although studious and largely self-educated, Jacques did not have Jean-François' genius for language; however, he was talented at earning a living, and supported Jean-François for most of his life.|$|E

5|$|As {{with all}} members of the genus, these leaf blades are densely covered by peduncular (stalked) {{mucilaginous}} glands and sessile (flat) digestive glands. The peduncular glands consist of a few secretory cells on top of a single-celled stalk. These cells produce a mucilaginous secretion which forms visible droplets across the leaf surface. This wet appearance probably helps lure prey in search of water; a similar phenomenon is observed in the sundews. The droplets secrete only limited enzymes and serve mainly to entrap insects. On contact with an insect, the peduncular glands release additional mucilage from special reservoir cells located at the base of their stalks. The insect struggles, triggering more glands and encasing itself in mucilage. P. moranensis can bend its leaf edges slightly by thigmotropism, bringing additional glands into contact with the trapped insect. The sessile glands, which lie <b>flat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> leaf surface, serve to digest the insect prey. Once the prey is entrapped by the peduncular glands and digestion begins, the initial flow of nitrogen triggers enzyme release by the sessile glands. These enzymes, which include amylase, esterase, phosphatase, protease, and ribonuclease break down the digestible components of the insect body. These fluids are then absorbed back into the leaf surface through cuticular holes, leaving only the chitin exoskeleton of the larger insects on the leaf surface.|$|E
5|$|Auriscalpium vulgare {{usually has}} a single stem, but {{occasionally}} several stems arise from a thick common base. It attaches {{to the side of}} the cap and is cylindrical or slightly flattened with a bulbous base. Its surface is covered with hairy fibers (especially near the base), and its mature color is a dark chestnut brown. The cap is semicircular or kidney-shaped, <b>flat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lower surface and rounded on the top. The surface is at first much like the stem: covered with bristles and dark chestnut brown. However, it becomes smooth with maturity and can darken to the point of being almost black. The cap margin is usually buff to light brown–roughly the same color as the spines and lighter in color than the center. It becomes rolled inward (revolute) and often wavy in maturity. The spines on the underside of the cap are a few millimeters long and cylindrical down to their sharp tips. White to light brown when young, they later become covered with a white spore mass and then turn an ashy gray. Occasionally, fruit bodies are produced that lack a cap entirely.|$|E
