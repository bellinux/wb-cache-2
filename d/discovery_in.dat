5|$|After Neil Bartlett's <b>discovery</b> <b>in</b> 1962 that xenon {{can form}} {{chemical}} compounds, {{a large number}} of xenon compounds have been discovered and described. Almost all known xenon compounds contain the electronegative atoms fluorine or oxygen. The chemistry of xenon in each oxidation state is analogous to that of the neighboring element iodine in the immediately lower oxidation state.|$|E

5|$|After its <b>discovery</b> <b>in</b> 1897, it {{has never}} been {{recorded}} again and it is now considered extinct; the presence of introduced black rats on María Madre may have contributed to its extinction. Oryzomys nelsoni was a large species, distinguished in particular by its long tail, robust skull, and large incisors. It was reddish to yellowish above and mostly white below. Its diet may have included plant material and small animals.|$|E
5|$|Although it {{is thought}} to have a body-centered cubic crystal {{structure}} from absolute zero to its melting point, high-resolution measurements of the thermal expansion along the three crystallographic axes reveal anisotropies which are inconsistent with a cubic structure. Therefore, further research and <b>discovery</b> <b>in</b> this area is expected.|$|E
5|$|Although one of {{the more}} fantastic {{elements}} of science fiction is central to the film, Carruth's goal was to portray scientific <b>discovery</b> <b>in</b> a down-to-earth and realistic manner.

5|$|Before this <b>discovery,</b> <b>in</b> September 1987, African-American {{rights groups}} had forced tunnel {{contractor}} Atkinson/Dillingham to return 36 steel beams from South Africa used for temporary shoring at Pioneer Square station.

5|$|From its <b>discovery</b> <b>in</b> 1875 {{until the}} era of semiconductors, the primary uses of gallium were {{high-temperature}} thermometrics and metal alloys with unusual properties of stability or ease of melting (some such being liquid at room temperature). The development of gallium arsenide as a direct band gap semiconductor in the 1960s ushered in the most important stage in the applications of gallium.|$|E

5|$|Osteoderms (bony plates {{formed in}} the skin) have been found with at least 10 {{titanosaur}} genera.
