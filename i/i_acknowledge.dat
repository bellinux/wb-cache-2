25|$|Next to {{the study}} of the Scriptures which I earnestly inculcate, I exhort my pupils to peruse Calvin’s Commentaries, which I extol in loftier terms than Helmich himself (a Dutch divine, 15511608); for I affirm that he excels beyond {{comparison}} in the interpretation of Scripture, and that his commentaries ought to be more highly valued than all that is handed down to us by the library of the fathers; so that <b>I</b> <b>acknowledge</b> him to have possessed above most others, or rather above all other men, what may be called an eminent spirit of prophecy. His Institutes ought to be studied after the (Heidelberg) Catechism, as containing a fuller explanation, but with discrimination, like the writings of all men.|$|E

500|$|In January 1897, the Australian Fred Spofforth {{claimed in}} a letter to the Sporting Life that Peel {{occasionally}} threw the ball, an accusation he also levelled at Tom McKibbin, an Australian bowler. Spofforth wrote that Peel [...] "has no need to resort to throwing. <b>I</b> <b>acknowledge</b> that he does not often take to it, still, it is well known to cricketers that at times he does 'shy' [...]" [...] Peel denied this and claimed that leading umpires would support him.|$|E
500|$|According to this theory—one of many—for {{as long as}} Prospero {{is battling}} with these qualities and lost in books, he is banished from Milan. As the play finds its conclusion, he is both able to accept his base, brutal nature ("this thing of {{darkness}} <b>I</b> <b>acknowledge</b> mine" [...] he says when taking responsibility for Caliban) while letting go of his connection with higher, powerful forces ("then to the elements be free, and fare thou well" [...] he says, setting Ariel free). Abandoning magic and acknowledging the brutal potential of his nature, he is {{allowed to return to}} his rightful place as Duke, subject to agreement from the audience: [...] "as you from crimes would pardon'd be, let your indulgence set me free." ...|$|E
500|$|The two men {{discussed}} [...] "natural aristocracy." [...] Jefferson said, [...] "The natural aristocracy I {{consider as}} the most precious gift of nature for the instruction, the trusts, and government of society. And indeed {{it would have been}} inconsistent in creation to have formed man for the social state, and not to have provided virtue and wisdom enough to manage the concerns of society. May we not even say that the form of government is best which provides most effectually for a pure selection of these natural [...] into the offices of government?" [...] Adams wondered if it ever would be so clear who these people were, [...] "Your distinction between natural and artificial aristocracy does not appear to me well founded. Birth and wealth are conferred on some men as imperiously by nature, as genius, strength, or beauty. ... When aristocracies are established by human laws and honour, wealth, and power are made hereditary by municipal laws and political institutions, then <b>I</b> <b>acknowledge</b> artificial aristocracy to commence." [...] It would always be true, Adams argued, that fate would bestow influence on some men for reasons other than true wisdom and virtue. That being the way of nature, he thought such [...] "talents" [...] were natural. A good government, therefore, had to account for that reality.|$|E

500|$|In 2006, Frank and {{incoming}} House Speaker Nancy Pelosi {{were accused}} by Rep. John Hostettler (R-IN) {{of having a}} [...] "radical homosexual agenda"; Frank responded [...] "I do have things I {{would like to see}} adopted on behalf of LGBT people: they include the right to marry the individual of our choice; the right to serve in the military to defend our country; and the right to a job based solely on our own qualifications. <b>I</b> <b>acknowledge</b> that this is an agenda, but I do not think that any self-respecting radical in history would have considered advocating people's rights to get married, join the army, and earn a living as a terribly inspiring revolutionary platform." [...] Frank's stance on outing gay Republicans has been called the [...] "Frank Rule" [...] whereby a closeted person who uses her or his power, position, or notoriety to hurt LGBT people can be outed. The issue became relevant during the Mark Foley scandal of 2006, during which Frank clarified his position on HBO's Real Time with Bill Maher: [...] "I think there's a right to privacy. But the right to privacy should not be a right to hypocrisy. And people who want to demonize other people shouldn't then be able to go home and close the door and do it themselves." ...|$|E
500|$|Locke wrote Some Thoughts Concerning Education in {{response}} to his friend Samuel Clarke's query on how to educate his son, so the text's [...] "principal aim", as Locke states at the beginning, [...] "is how a young gentleman should be brought up from his infancy." [...] This education [...] "will not so perfectly suit the education of daughters; though where the difference of sex requires different treatment, it will be no hard matter to distinguish" [...] (Locke's emphasis). This passage suggests that, for Locke, education was fundamentally the same for men and women—there were only small, obvious differences for women. This interpretation is supported by a letter he wrote to Mrs. Clarke in 1685 stating that [...] "since therefore <b>I</b> <b>acknowledge</b> no difference of sex in your mind relating ... to truth, virtue and obedience, I think well to have no thing altered in it from what is [...]" [...] Martin Simons states that Locke [...] "suggested, both by implication and explicitly, that a boy's education should be along the lines already followed by some girls of the intelligent genteel classes." [...] Rather than sending boys to schools which would ignore their individual needs and teach them little of value, Locke argues that they should be taught at home as girls already were and [...] "should learn useful and necessary crafts of the house and estate." [...] Like his contemporary Mary Astell, Locke believed that women could and should be taught to be rational and virtuous.|$|E

2500|$|In November 2008, {{prosecutors}} {{who were}} in charge of the case announced that Spitzer would not face criminal charges for his involvement in the sex ring. They cited that no evidence of misuse of public funds was found and therefore it would not serve the public interest to press charges against Spitzer. The disgraced former Governor offered an apology for his conduct, saying [...] "I appreciate the impartiality and thoroughness of the investigation by the U.S. Attorney's Office, and <b>I</b> <b>acknowledge</b> and accept responsibility for the conduct it disclosed." ...|$|E

[...] <b>I</b> <b>acknowledge</b> myself guilty in regard of many of my slaves, but I call God to witness to my innocence in respect to the murder of Prosper. [...] I am sensible that the country thirsts for my blood, and I am ready to sacrifice it." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{catechism}} {{is one of}} Luther's {{most personal}} works.

For <b>I</b> <b>acknowledge</b> none of them to be really a book of mine, except perhaps the Bondage of the Will and the Catechism." [...] The Small Catechism has earned a reputation as a model of clear religious teaching. It remains in use today, along with Luther's hymns and his translation of the Bible.|$|E

2500|$|By July 1800 Fox had [...] "forgiven" [...] {{the means}} by which he had come into power and claimed Napoleon had [...] "surpassed...Alexander & Caesar, not to mention the great {{advantage}} he has over them in the Cause he fights in". In October 1801 a preliminary peace agreement between Britain and France was published and Fox was delighted. In a speech to his constituents on 10 October Fox said: [...] "We have not, <b>I</b> <b>acknowledge,</b> obtained the objects for which the War was undertaken—so much the better—I rejoice that we have not. I like the Peace the more on this very account". Many of his friends were shocked at such open language, but as Fox said in his reply to a remonstrance from Grey: [...] "...the truth is, I am gone something further in hate to the English Government than perhaps you and the rest of my friends are, and certainly further than can with prudence be avowed. The triumph of the French Government over the English does in fact afford me a degree of pleasure which {{it is very difficult to}} disguise".|$|E

2500|$|Westfall notes that, in {{the early}} modern period, the “word 'friend' carries special connotations within a context of patronage; {{authorities}} on patronage distinguish what they call instrumental friendship from emotional friendship… [...] Galileo's [...] "friends" [...] in Venice appear to have understood that the [...] "friendship" [...] entailed {{the use of their}} connections and influence on his behalf. In all of Galileo’s attempts to rise up the ladder of Patronage, one of his connections, Sagredo, would write him words that Westfall considers “ne would be hard pressed to find a better example of the language of patronage.” Westfall writes, “Sagredo, who was clearly tiring of the exercise, wanted to be sure that Galileo understood he had fulfilled his duty as a patron [...] ‘Since I have already satisfied abundantly enough the friendship I hold for you, the obligations to you which <b>I</b> <b>acknowledge,</b> and the favor and help that true gentlemen try to extend to the qualified who deserve it,’ he thought he might now honorably desist.” [...] Westfall also provides fantastic evidence directly from the mouth of Galileo as to the importance of Patronage to himself ...|$|E
