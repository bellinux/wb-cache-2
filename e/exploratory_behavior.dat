40|$|Abstract—This paper {{proposes a}} method for {{interactive}} recognition of household objects using proprioceptive and auditory feedback. In our experiments, the robot observed the changes in its proprioceptive and auditory sensory streams while performing five <b>exploratory</b> <b>behaviors</b> (lift, shake, drop, crush, and push) on 50 common household objects (e. g., bottles, cups, balls, toys, etc.). The robot was tasked with recognizing the objects it was manipulating by feeling them {{and listening to the}} sounds that they make without using any visual information. The results show that both proprioception and audio, coupled with <b>exploratory</b> <b>behaviors,</b> can be used successfully for object recognition. Furthermore, the robot was able to integrate feedback from the two modalities, to achieve even better recognition accuracy. Finally, the results show that the robot can boost its recognition rate even further by applying multiple different <b>exploratory</b> <b>behaviors</b> on the object. I...|$|R
40|$|Active object {{exploration}} {{is one of}} {{the hallmarks}} of human and animal intelligence. Research in psychology has shown that the use of multiple <b>exploratory</b> <b>behaviors</b> is crucial for learning about objects. Inspired by such research, recent work in robotics has demonstrated that by performing multiple <b>exploratory</b> <b>behaviors</b> a robot can dramatically improve its object recognition rate. But what is the cause of this improvement? To answer this question, this paper examines the conditions under which combining information from multiple behaviors and sensory modalities leads to better object recognition results. Two different problems are considered: interactive object recognition using auditory and proprioceptive feedback, and surface texture recognition using tactile and proprioceptive feedback. Analysis of the results shows that metrics designed to estimate classifier model diversity can explain the improvement in recognition accuracy. This finding establishes, for the first time, an important link between empirical studies of <b>exploratory</b> <b>behaviors</b> in robotics and theoretical results on boosting in machine learning...|$|R

25|$|Stress {{has been}} known to cause both {{physiological}} and behavioral chronic issues for captive species including, but not limited to, altered reproductive cycling and behavior, reduced immune responses, disrupted hormone and growth levels, reduced body weight, heightened abnormal activities and aggression and decreased <b>exploratory</b> <b>behavior</b> with increased hiding behaviors. Such stress reactions could be caused by sounds, light conditions, odors, temperature and humidity conditions, material make-up of enclosures, habitat size constraints, lack of proper hiding areas, forced closeness to humans, routine husbandry and feeding conditions, or abnormal social groups to name a few. Use of both internal and external privacy screens on exhibit windows has been shown to alleviate stresses from visual effects of high crowd densities, leading to decreased stereotypic behaviors in the gorillas. Playing naturalistic auditory stimuli as opposed to classical music, rock music, or no auditory enrichment (which allows for crowd noise, machinery, etc. to be heard) has been noted to reduce stress behavior as well. Enrichment modifications to feed and foraging, where clover-hay is added to an exhibit floor, decrease stereotypic activities while simultaneously increasing positive food-related behaviors.|$|E

Our robot observed acoustic and visual outcomes from 6 different <b>exploratory</b> <b>behaviors</b> performed on 20 objects (containers and non-containers). Its task was to learn 12 different object categorizations (one for each behavior–modality combination), and then to unify these categorizations into a single one. In the end, the object categorization acquired by the robot matched closely the object labels provided by a human. In addition, the robot acquired a visual model of containers and non-containers based on its unified categorization, which it used to label correctly 29 out of 30 novel objects.

Here, we have examined a related, monogamous species, the California mouse (Peromyscus californicus), where we predicted that males would be less sensitive to BPA in terms of navigational and <b>exploratory</b> <b>behaviors,</b> while displaying other traits related to interactions with females and territorial marking that might be vulnerable to disruption.

To bridge that gap, this study examined the role of culture in influencing consumers’switching intentions, vanity-seeking, and <b>exploratory</b> <b>behaviors</b> of novelty-seeking, curiosity-seeking, and variety-seeking. In this study, the authors summarized the dominant Chinese cultural values and discussed their implications for Taiwanese subjects’switching behaviors in the context of casual or trendy restaurants. Data from two countries (United States and Taiwan) were used to gain insight into cultural differences between Taiwanese and U. S. consumers’din-ing habits. The study results indicate that Taiwanese consumers (i. e., college-aged) are more likely to switch restaurant providers and to exhibit <b>exploratory</b> <b>behaviors</b> than their U.

40|$|Without question, {{racial and}} ethnic {{minority}} groups are playing more significant roles in American society. However, there still remains a lack of diversity within the STEM workforce, especially within agricultural sciences disciplines. More problematic {{is the fact that}} low numbers of African Americans are employed in the agricultural sciences workforce. This study extends the use of Social Cognitive Career Theory by exploring how person, contextual and cognitive factors interplay to influence the career goals and career <b>exploratory</b> <b>behaviors</b> of African American college students pursuing STEM-intensive agricultural sciences majors. Instruments were selected to measure various components of the SCCT framework, focusing primarily on person, cognitive and contextual variables. Data were collected from African American undergraduate students (N = 314) enrolled in STEM-intensive agricultural sciences majors at five Historically Black Land-Grant Institutions. A Structural Equation Modeling technique was utilized to test three research hypotheses. An additional research question was included to identify additional factors influencing students’ pursuit of STEM-intensive agricultural sciences majors. Overall, the structural models indicated good model fit with significant paths being identified among several of the SCCT variables. There are four conclusions of this study. First, African American college students who were enrolled in STEM-intensive agricultural sciences majors with masculine gender personality attributes are {{more likely to engage in}} career <b>exploratory</b> <b>behaviors</b> if they feel more confidence in making career decisions. Second, African American students who were enrolled in STEM-intensive agricultural sciences majors who faced career barriers were more likely to engage in career <b>exploratory</b> <b>behaviors.</b> Third, African American college students who were enrolled in STEM-intensive agricultural sciences majors who were confident in their ability in making career decisions and coping with career barriers were more likely to engage in more career <b>exploratory</b> <b>behaviors.</b> Fourth, African American college students who were enrolled in STEM-intensive agricultural sciences majors reported mentoring as the most helpful factor regarding their career pursuits, and academic difficulties as the most hindering factor regarding their career pursuits.

40|$|Recalibration of {{affordance}} perception allows {{observers to}} adapt {{to changes in the}} body's size or abilities that alter possibilities for action. Of key interest is understanding how <b>exploratory</b> <b>behaviors</b> lead to successful recalibration. The present study was designed to test a novel hypothesis-that the same processes of exploration and recalibration should generalize between affordances that share a similar function. Most affordances for fitting the body through openings are recalibrated without feedback from practicing the action; locomotion exploration is sufficient. The present study used a different fitting task, squeezing through doorways, to determine whether locomotor experience was sufficient for recalibrating to changes in body size that altered affordances. Participants were unable to recalibrate from locomotor experience, demonstrating that <b>exploratory</b> <b>behaviors</b> do not necessarily generalize between functionally similar affordances. Participants only recalibrated following action practice or after receiving feedback about judgment accuracy, suggesting that the informational requirements of the squeezing task may differ from those of other fitting tasks. Implications for affordance theory are discussed...|$|R

Adolescence {{is a time}} when risk behaviors begin to increase through experimentation with health risk behaviors such as substance used and reckless driving and <b>exploratory</b> risk <b>behaviors</b> such as asking someone on a date and standing up to peers. It is likely that some risk-taking is necessary in the course of social and academic development throughout childhood and adolescence. A shift in the adolescent risk behavior research from a focus on health related behaviors to physical and psychological well-being with a link to educational attainment has gained strength, but the goals of this movement are incomplete. Research is needed to better understand the positive outcomes of health risk and <b>exploratory</b> risk <b>behaviors,</b> and a measure that includes both <b>exploratory</b> risk <b>behavior</b> and health risk behavior is needed. The Adolescent <b>Exploratory</b> and Risk <b>Behavior</b> Rating Scale (AERRS) was developed to address this need. The AERRS was developed using both classical test theory and item response theory methods. The participants were 682 high school students in the Midwest. The results suggest that the developed measure has adequate reliability. The initial examination of validity resulted in a factor structure in which health risk <b>behaviors</b> and <b>exploratory</b> risk <b>behaviors</b> fall into separate factors with some gender differences noted. The item response theory results suggest that risk behavior is a spectrum of <b>behaviors</b> with <b>exploratory</b> <b>behaviors</b> falling on one end and health risk behavior on {{the opposite end of the}} spectrum.

40|$|Caenorhabditis elegans explores its {{environment}} by interrupting its forward movement with occasional turns and reversals. Turns and reversals occur at stable frequencies but irregular intervals, producing probabilistic <b>exploratory</b> <b>behaviors.</b> Here we dissect {{the roles of}} individual sensory neurons, interneurons, and motor neurons in <b>exploratory</b> <b>behaviors</b> under different conditions. After animals are removed from bacterial food, they initiate a local search behavior consisting of reversals and deep omega-shaped turns triggered by AWC olfactory neurons, ASK gustatory neurons, and AIB interneurons. Over the following 30 min, the animals disperse as reversals and omega turns are suppressed by ASI gustatory neurons and AIY interneurons. Interneurons and motor neurons downstream of AIB and AIY encode specific aspects of reversal and turn frequency, amplitude, and directionality. SMD motor neurons help encode the steep amplitude of omega turns, RIV motor neurons specify the ventral bias of turns that follow a reversal, and SMB motor neurons set the amplitude of sinusoidal movement. Many of these sensory neurons, interneurons, and motor neurons are also implicated in chemotaxis and thermotaxis. Thus, this circuit may represent a common substrate for multiple navigation behaviors...|$|R

Although electrosensory systems include {{some of the most}} extensively understood circuits in the vertebrate central nervous system, relatively little is known quantitatively about how fish electrolocate objects. We believe a prerequisite to understanding electrolocation and its underlying neural substrates is to quantify and visualize the peripheral electrosensory information measured by the electroreceptors.
