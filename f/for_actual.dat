5|$|Descriptions of the {{tactical}} role of chariots in Ancient Greece and Rome are rare. The Iliad, possibly referring to Mycenaen practices used c.1250 BC, describes {{the use of}} chariots for transporting warriors to and from battle, rather than <b>for</b> <b>actual</b> fighting. Later, Julius Caesar, invading Britain in 55 and 54 BC, noted British charioteers throwing javelins, then leaving their chariots to fight on foot.|$|E
5|$|In 1932 Ralph Budd met Edward G. Budd (no relation), an {{automotive}} steel pioneer who was {{founder and}} president of the Budd Company. Edward Budd was demonstrating his new Budd-Michelin rail motorcar built of stainless steel. Pneumatic-wheeled railcars never found popularity <b>for</b> <b>actual</b> service in the US - they tended to derail - but they demonstrated the successful construction of lightweight stainless steel unibody railcars.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} sports personalities portray themselves. Jim Lampley, Larry Merchant, and Max Kellerman {{comprise}} the ringside broadcast team (all three are commentators for HBO Boxing). Sportswriters such as Bert Sugar, Bernard Fernandez and Steve Springer also appear. As <b>for</b> <b>actual</b> boxers, Mike Tyson (who had retired by the film's release) makes a cameo appearance, taunting Dixon as the fighter enters the ring. Lou DiBella, a real-life boxing promoter, portrays himself as Dixon's promoter. Several of ESPN's personalities also portray themselves. SportsCenter anchor Brian Kenny {{is the host}} of the fictional Then and Now series, while Cold Pizza and 1st and 10 hosts Jay Crawford, Dana Jacobson, Skip Bayless, and Woody Paige also appear. Ring announcer Michael Buffer appeared as himself, as did referee Joe Cortez.|$|E

5|$|The {{episode was}} written by David S. Cohen, Dan Greaney and Steve Tompkins, with Ken Keeler {{coming up with the}} story and the general idea of {{intentionally}} bad writing. It was directed by Neil Affleck, and Tim Conway, Gailard Sartain and Phil Hartman guest-starred. The producers were initially uneasy about the episode, as they feared that the purposely bad writing would be mistaken <b>for</b> <b>actual</b> bad writing. The episode, however, now appears on several lists of the most popular Simpsons episodes.|$|E
5|$|Hieronymus, in 2009, {{concluded}} that the nasal and supraorbital bosses were used for butting or ramming the head or the flank of a rival. The bone structure indicates that the bosses were covered by cornified pads as in modern muskoxen, suggesting dominance fights {{similar to those of}} members of the Caprinae subfamily. In the latter group, an evolutionary transition can be observed, where the originally straight horns become more robust, padded, and increasingly curved downwards. The evolution from horncores into bosses in Centrosaurinae would likewise have reflected a change in fighting technique, from clashing to high-energy head-butting. Head-butting would have been an expensive and risky behavior. Opponents would only have engaged this way after assessing each other's strengths visually. For this reason, Hieronymus considered it unlikely that the bosses served for species recognition as this was already guaranteed by the innate species-specific display rituals preceding a real – instead of a ritual – fight. The bosses would have evolved <b>for</b> <b>actual</b> combat, part of a social selection in which individuals competed for scarce resources such as mates, food and breeding grounds.|$|E

25|$|Overall, the XI Carabinieri Mechanized Brigade {{consisted}} of about 5,000 men with 80 tracked vehicles, 200 other military vehicles, 130 M47 tanks and a paratroopers battalion.

25|$|The biga (Latin, plural bigae) is the two-horse chariot as used {{in ancient}} Rome for sport, transportation, and ceremonies.

The term biga is also used by modern scholars for the similar chariots of other Indo-European cultures, particularly the two-horse chariot of the ancient Greeks and Celts. The driver of a biga is a bigarius.|$|E
