Take {{a look at}} the diaries of the world s political leaders chock-a-block with summit meetings, sometimes two in one week. In mid-June 2002, squashed between an environmental summit in Brazil and a richest nation moot, with NEPAD partners, in Canada, was the World Food Summit Five Years Later in Rome, Italy. There, under the absent eye of most northern Heads of State, and with massive (but very porous) security, the leaders of many developing countries, powerless and budget-challenged, reaffirmed the previous summit s pledge in 1996 to halve the number of hungry people in the world within the, by now, next 12 years. Tying up the time of 6, 613 participants, 74 Heads of State or Government, 181 country representatives, 1, 200 civil society people and 1, 601 media representatives (the equivalent of 250 working years), have such summits become exercises in pompous insincerity, or do they have a value? In terms of promises kept, no. The networking, though, driven by the hundreds of southern NGOs that made the journey, was a joy to behold. The rapprochements between NGOs and the World Bank, the furtive search of the life science industrialists and farmers leaders for partnership, the opportunity to coax the EU representative almost to seek forgiveness for subsidised agriculture all these mark a new phase in cooperation which could change the face of ACP agriculture. That makes a summit worthwhile. And it brings out the occasional chance remark that could trigger off quite a debate, such as that by Nobel prize winner Amartya Sen on poverty and hunger: 'What really matters is that people can buy food; where it is produced is not important.

Whilst women publishers are {{part and parcel of}} the Caribbean publishing scene, it is different in the top management levels of African publishing, where women are under-represented. An exceptionally moving and encouraging book, Courage and Consequence, relates the personal experiences of ten African women who head their own publishing houses or organisations, of how and why they got into publishing, and their successes and failures. The women from Ghana, Kenya, Namibia, Nigeria, Senegal, Uganda and Zimbabwe represent state, commercial, non-profit and community publishing, a women s writers group and a bookseller. An eleventh contribution provides an overview of women in publishing in South Africa. What is so moving about this book, which is recommended to all readers of Spore with an interest, professional or private, in the book and in publishing, and with a grasp of English? Few of the contributors, if any, had encountered direct discrimination on the grounds of their gender; the barriers for women are lack of education, and cultural factors. As a whole, the contributions give an overview of the sobering realities of African publishing, and in particular for women. They celebrate what the ten women have achieved, and show the courage needed to start and run cultural institutions in Africa. They are an inspiration for others to play their part in the cultural development of the development, and, who knows, in empowering the publishing sector to fully embrace rural life and agricultural development.

40|$|The {{world is}} moving towards {{knowledge-based}} societies. Economies are globalising. The global public goods value of forests is being recognised {{at the same}} time that traditional role of state forest agencies in production forestry is declining, in part being taken over by multi-national corporations. At the same time emerging technologies are greatly enhancing our ability to assess and monitor forest attributes, to process and disseminate information and to enhance forest production. All of these changes will have an impact on how forest research is organised, what is done, who does it and who pays for it. It seems inevitable that much traditional forestry research concerned with sustainability and productivity enhancement at the stand-level will be taken over by private sector. However, there is going to be a major challenge in finding resources for research in support of the public goods values of forests at local, national and global levels.

40|$|This book {{could have}} been called 'How to win friends and {{influence}} people' but that title was taken way back in 1936 for what became a classic {{in the art of}} persuasion. That art, for institutions seeking funds, favours or friends, is now called public awareness building. This manual is a solid and comprehensive introduction to the task facing more and more agricultural organisations, namely that of explaining their goals, their needs and their services to the various publics they seek to serve, or rely upon. As such, it fits into the long-term CTA programme of assisting partners to heighten their public profile. It looks in detail at separate and linked approaches and tools: press releases, dealing with the press, interview techniques, newsletters, annual reports, audio-visual presentations, publicity events, fairs, crisis situations, monitoring and evaluation, and more. But, beware, using all the tools in this book will not necessarily win you all the attention you want. In communication there are two sides to any story, and what you say may not be what your targets hear. They also notice what emanates from your institution. That aspect is often overlookedby institutions who believe that public awareness is just a set of mechanistic tools. No, it s more than that. Go outside your organisation and try to understand how others see you, how they interpret your body language, your behaviour. Does your institution look confident or brash? Cooperative or sneery?

40|$|Thesis (Master) [...] İzmir Institute of Technology, Architecture, İzmir, 2003 Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves: 169 - 171) Text in English; Abstract: Turkish and Englishxiii, 174 leavesIn {{the line}} with the increasing energy demand, {{there have been many}} investigations related with the conservation of energy used in buildings. The systems and materials used in buildings have an important role in consumption of energy. Transparent materials and the systems occupies transparent materials contributes this consumption in positive and negative way due to their design and properties. Nevertheless, the transparent materials used in buildings as glazing have importance in order to increase comfort, decrease cost and environmental harm. This study aims to investigate a contemporary construction system; ETFE foil pillow system, which is also known as, Inflatable Pillow System made of ETFE Foil. In the scope of the study, pneumatic pillow system investigated in detail and its performance evaluated due to environmental control criteria, which can be compared with other conventional glass glazing products. The study also involves cost analysis and brief knowledge about contemporary cases that have been completely or partially constructed with this system. The increase in the amount of transparent surfaces in contemporary buildings, pointed out that the conventional glazing system are no more appropriate. Therefore, in specific cases, usage of conventional glass glazing systems results as a cost increase and loss of comfort. The alternatives of the conventional glazing systems don. t have appropriate performance or don. t meet the need of the consumer. Inflatable ETFE foil pillows have better optical properties than glass glazing systems. Generally, thermal properties of this system equal to the advanced double-glazing. Light and heat transmission values vary by changing the foil type and number of layer. Low sound reduction index can be an obstacle or a chance for designers that should be given attention in design phase. The pillow system that relatively provides fire and earthquake protection is also lightweight and flexible. Thus, includes many criteria that are expected in contemporary constructions. The inflatable pillow system made of ETFE foil can be considered as a safe construction method due to mechanical properties of the system and the membrane material that is used as pillows. System reduces operational and maintenance cost for the building. Considerable amount of expenses for lighting and heating can also be reduced by the usage of the pillow system. The lightweight nature of the pillow system affects the construction of the whole building, which also results as a cost reduction. Pillow system is commonly used for greenhouses and botanical gardens and also used for sports and leisure halls as well as institutions ands museums. Addition to its usage as a skylight or façade cover, pillow system {{can be used as a}} total envelope that covers the whole construction underneath. As a result, this study investigates ETFE foil pillows and their environmental control properties against conventional glass glazing systems. The results are evaluated in {{the line with}} the information gained. The advantages and disadvantages of the system as a glazing are given in detail. Although <b>it.</b> <b>s</b> <b>not</b> expected that ETFE pillow system totally be replaced with the conventional glass glazing system, it constitutes an alternative glazing system in specific cases.

40|$|As we {{went through}} the program, what we determined, and what we all agreed on, was that the thrust {{coefficient}} (Cf) of the nozzle, after you get past a certain point, is really an engineering parameter. <b>It</b> <b>s</b> <b>not</b> a fundamental parameter {{that is going to be}} highly variable. Once we knew what the contour of the nozzle was, and once we knew what its characteristic was out to 2 : 1, we could calculate what the 48 : 1 thrust coefficient was going to be. In every case that we made a test, the calculation was precise. We weren't looking for a problem out at 48 : 1. Once we crushed the nozzle and said, "Yeah, we can land on the boulder," and once we had the thermal profile of that columbium nozzle, we did not require a lot of effort there. The real characterization was done in throttling over the 10 : 1 with the injector and controlling the mixture ratio on that - the whole head-end assembly - out to 2 : 1. I think everybody at NASA and Grumman agreed that flying like you test is great, particularly if you are using an aircraft engine. But, in this case, the thrust coefficient of the nozzle was not an issue. We had the tandem configuration of the service module, the command module, and the LEM sitting out there, and we were to fire the LEM. On Apollo 5, we were firing the LEM to show how it would work. There was a problem. I can t remember where the problem was, but something caused a problem before that engine had finished its burn. It was not in the engine, but there was some other problem, and NASA made a controlled shutdown. Then, they came to us and asked, "Hey, we re up there. We want to finish this test program. Is it okay if we restart that engine again in space with this tandem configuration?" We said, "As long as it has been more than forty minutes since you shut down, our analysis says that you will be okay in terms of the thermal characteristics of the inside of that chamber. " They restarted it and pushed that system around in orbit on Apollo 5. It turned out, that when it came to Apollo 13, we went back into the record, and said, "Hey, we have pushed this system around up there on Apollo 5, and we have also restarted this tandem configuration. " The requirements on Apollo 13 were to put it back into play. The spacecraft was out of free return to the earth at the time of the accident. It would not have come back. NASA said, "Okay, we ll use the descent engine to put the spacecraft in a free trajectory; it will go around the moon and be on free trajectory back to Earth. " Then, as it came around the far side of the moon, the guys found out that they had an oxygen problem. As you remember, things were getting pretty bad in there. They said, "We ve got to get it back as fast as we can. Is it okay if we re-fire the engine? Now, we re in a free trajectory, so we want to put as much delta-v (or change in velocity) in as we can. Can we re-fire right now?" We said, "Yes, the data says it has been this period of time. " We could re-fire the engine, run the rest of the duty cycle up as far as we needed while preserving enough fluids to make the final correction as the spacecraft got near Earth, and restart the engine. It was pretty fortuitous that we could give them those answers...|$|E
40|$|In Africa, AIDS affects {{everyone}} in the community. When I was working on HIV/AIDS in Tanzania in 1999, I found myself talking to district administrators and farmers in terms of which households are afflicted, which households are affected and which households are not affected. One farmer kindly told me 'Here there is no household that is not affected. Afflicted and affected. Your third category does not exist. ' Some people claim that AIDS is now more an urban problem than a rural one, but the actual rate of prevalence in any area depends on the local context. In fact, in Africa and other developing countries, you cannot make the urban-rural distinction, because of the constant movement of people. Town people go home to the village at special times of the year, rural people work in towns, and nowadays there is yet more movement because of more funerals {{and the fact that}} when people are very ill, they go home. Remember, relatively few people in Africa die in towns. We all want to be buried near to our forefathers - back to the roots. Deadening impact on agriculture The impact of AIDS can be counted in terms of calories per head, and food security {{is going to be more}} precarious. Because of AIDS, farming systems suffer labour shortage and bottlenecks; these cause shortages of food both for consumption and for sale. If you don t have labour you cannot grow crops that take a long time to mature, like banana (one year) or coffee (five years). You had better grow cassava or sweet potatoes which takes six months and has quick returns. The overriding need for many families is to fill the stomach, care for relatives and take in orphans. For such families, the level of livelihood has gone down. In Rwanda, genocide and AIDS mean that there are more than 11, 000 households headed by children below the age of 11. The biggest threat is that with so many non-socialised children you cannot expect that wars in Africa are going to stop. Some will drift off to be soldiers, or to the cities to be street children, but even for those who stay in rural areas, life will be precarious. They are not being prepared to be farmers. At best they will perhaps be quasi-farmers, disconnected from the land, if they have not sold it. There is no handing-down of knowledge and skills. Schools could have played a very useful role, but in north-western Tanzania, for example, school attendance levels have dropped from 100 % to 30 % because there is no-one to send children to school, to buy books, to pay school fees, and no-one to be the teacher. And when casual labour gives instant earnings, instead of the need to wait for income from farming, which will a young person choose? Disease and risk We have to understand the forces which are driving the epidemic, or rather pandemic now that it is global. Some people present AIDS as a disease in terms of microbes; many people blame its spread on commercial sex workers and loose sexual behaviour. <b>It</b> <b>s</b> <b>not</b> that simple. There are considerations of family and survival. Last year, in Mwanza, Tanzania, a farmer told me: 'My son, here AIDS is not about the virus, it is about food. This is a very dry area. Rains come three months every year. By April, the place is dry, our harvest is in the stores. By end of August, rice stores have run out and you have families without food. So if I have a teenage girl and she goes out and comes back with a kilo of rice, I will not ask. ' It is also a question of risk. People living in comfort perceive risk in terms of the future, tomorrow, the year after, ten years, twenty years it s theoretical because you know that you have something to live for. But talk about AIDS to a commercial sex worker, driven to her work by desperation, and she will say that hunger tonight is a greater risk to her and her children than AIDS, perhaps, after 5 years. Less poverty, less disease As Louis Pasteur said 'The microbe is nothing, the terrain is everything'. That Africa is the poorest continent and that Africa is facing the biggest epidemic of AIDS surely tells us something about the relationship between poverty and the disease. Instead of condemning the alleged promiscuity of our youth, who say their behaviour is only a symptom of the absence of development, we need to make sure that AIDS prevention and poverty alleviation go hand in hand. So yes, more public awareness even though we know that 95 % of people in Tanzania today are aware of AIDS. And, yes, let us help our agricultural extension workers to know and explain more about AIDS, as well as early planting. And, yes, give us institutions and policies which admit to the problem and plan their preparedness. To combat AIDS is not only to change behaviour but also to work on food security and issues like land. Without the security of livelihood, we are going to keep the problem.

Espera-se que a fala seja com expressão, isto é, com a eliminação de tudo que {{provoque}} tensão, e possa, assim, envolver o ouvinte, que busca não apenas a informação, mas a experiência de ouvir, criar e imaginar. Acredita-se que trabalhar as habilidades comunicativas, por meio do treinamento da escuta, sensibiliza o profissional a conhecer melhor os efeitos de uma fala construída e, assim, torna-o mais confiante em sua atuação com a utilização de recursos e ajustes considerados próprios da comunicação radiofônica. Objetivo: Investigar o impacto da intervenção fonoaudiológica na expressividade, durante a leitura de uma locução comercial. Métodos: O estudo foi realizado com 22 estudantes de um curso de formação de radialistas, sendo 15 do sexo masculino (68, 18 %) e 7 do sexo feminino (31, 81 %). Os estudantes foram submetidos à intervenção fonoaudiológica, em sete encontros, com carga horária total de 21 horas, e gravaram uma mesma locução comercial varejo, antes e após a intervenção. Foi baseada em atividades vivenciais, com foco principal no trabalho de ênfase, bem como a sensibilização de seu uso nos diferentes contextos comunicativos da fala radiofônica. As vozes de cada sujeito foram editadas e apresentadas em ordem aleatória, aos pares, a 40 ouvintes de rádio. Cada juiz foi orientado a ouvir as duas vozes, de cada sujeito, e marcar em um protocolo, previamente estabelecido, se as vozes eram iguais ou diferentes. Caso fossem diferentes, deveriam escolher qual a melhor, a primeira ou a segunda. Em seguida, a fonoaudióloga responsável pela pesquisa analisou a melhor e a pior voz segundo a análise dos ouvintes de rádio. Resultados: A análise demonstrou que o maior número de vozes pós-intervenção foi considerado melhor (19 referentes a 86, 36 %%), seguido pelas vozes consideradas como iguais e piores na pós-intervenção (3 correspondentes a 13, 64 %). Na avaliação fonoaudiológica, foram analisadas três vozes: a pior e duas melhores, que empataram no julgamento dos juízes, e, dentre estas, os fatores que diferenciaram as mesmas foram: a modulação, o loudness e o ataque vocal. Conclusões: Pode-se concluir que, para os ouvintes de rádio, as vozes melhoraram após a intervenção fonoaudiológica, o que sugere que a intervenção, com foco nas habilidades de percepção e escuta do uso dos recursos vocais, pode contribuir na expressividade, por ocasião da capacitação de futuros profissionaisIntroduction: The communicative {{competence of}} a radio announcer develops every day and <b>it</b> <b>s</b> <b>not</b> currently necessary the call "voice placement" as required before to be acted. Today the ones considered good radio announcers are who has a natural and spontaneous communication, that is, similar to regular speech, a fact that promotes the proximity to the listeners. The term expressiveness in speech therapy has been used associated {{to the idea of}} attributing to speech, joy, confidence, dynamism, credibility and/or naturalness. Although the positive aspect is being emphasized in this direction, the expressive speech shall convey emotions and attitudes of all natures, both positive and negative. While speaking into the microphone it s the speaker task, leading the listener by the journey of listening, propitiating imagination to both speaker and listener. It s hoped that the speech would be expressive, in other words, with the elimination of anything that causes tension, and thus may involve the listener that seeks not only information, but the experience of listening, creating and imagining. It s believed that work on communication skills through listening training moves the professional to better understand the effects of a built speech and thus makes him more confident in his performance with the use of resources and adjustments considered the own radio communication. Purpose: To investigate the impact of speech therapy intervention in the expressiveness during the reading of a commercial speech. Methods: The study was made with 22 students in a radio announcing course, being them 15 males (68. 18 %) and 7 females (31. 81 %). The students were submitted to the speech therapy intervention in seven meetings, and recorded the same retail trade locution before and after the intervention. The voices of each person were edited and presented in random order, in pairs, to 40 radio listeners. Each judge was instructed to listen to the two voices of each person and score on a previously established protocol if the voices were the same or different. If they were different, they should choose the best voice, the first or second. Afterwards, the research responsible pathologist analyzed the best and the worst voice according to the radio listeners analysis. Results: The analysis showed that the greatest number of post intervention voices was considered the best (19 % to 86. 36 %), followed by the equal and worse voices in the post (3 to 13. 64 %). In clinical evaluation it was analyzed three voices: the worst and best two that tied on the judges trial, but being the determined choice factors: the modulation, the loudness and vocal attack. Conclusions: It can be concluded that in the radio listeners view, the voices get improved after the speech therapy intervention, which suggests that intervention with a focus on the perception and listening skills on the vocal resources use, can contribute to the expressiveness in occasion of the future professionals trainin...|$|E

Mesmo com todas estas precau????es, nem sempre s??o decis??es f??ceis de serem tomadas e que, muitas vezes, necessitam de algum apoio ou alguma ferramenta que lhes auxilie, ainda mais quando os sistemas de produ????o envolvem pr??ticas e/ou processos de produ????o org??nica ou com alguma inova????o tecnol??gica. Nesses casos, o agricultor necessita envolver uma s??rie de elementos internos e externos ?? propriedade, interagir com a natureza e saber us??-la em benef??cio da unidade de produ????o. Estudos v??m sendo realizados para aperfei??oar os processos de produ????o org??nica, enfatizando sua import??ncia e seus benef??cios sociais, ambientais, econ??micos e as oportunidades que ela traz. A produ????o org??nica de batatas tem evolu??do, por??m, por ser um sistema ainda em consolida????o, enfrenta pontos de estrangulamento na produ????o e na comercializa????o, que devem ser estudados com maior profundidade. Neste sentido, o estudo teve por objetivo construir modelos que agreguem os diferentes crit??rios de avalia????o de sistemas de batata org??nica, desenvolvido por agricultores familiares da regi??o Sul do Rio Grande do Sul. Contou com um grupo que vem atuando no projeto de pesquisa Rede de Refer??ncia (GRR) da Embrapa Clima Temperado e outro fora da rede (GFRR), associados ??s Cooperativas Sul Ecol??gica, Arpa-Sul e Coopar. Para avaliar os sistemas de produ????o de batata org??nica o estudo utilizou a ferramenta Multicrit??rio de Apoio ?? Decis??o (MCDA), que permite a inser????o da vis??o subjetiva dos atores envolvidos no contexto decis??rio por interm??dio da forma????o de um quadro de refer??ncia mental (QRM), composto por suas cren??as pessoais, hip??teses, valores e prefer??ncias, atrav??s da constru????o da modelagem criterial de uma forma participativa. O estudo mostrou de uma maneira geral, que os modelos constru??dos (1 -GRR e 2 -GFRR), n??o se diferenciam muito em rela????o ??s pr??ticas de produ????o adotadas em cada um dos grupos. No entanto, as diferen??as ocorreram nos n??veis de impacto das a????es e no estabelecimento de pesos diferentes entre os modelos, de modo que o resultado final, na ordem de prefer??ncia dos crit??rios de avalia????o, foi diferente. Para o GRR o crit??rio tamanho da batata foi o mais importante, enquanto que para o GFRR foi o crit??rio riscos de produ????o. Os dois modelos quando avaliados com outros quatro sistemas de produ????o de batata org??nica (A,B,C e D), tiveram desempenho muito pr??ximos na avalia????o global. No modelo 1, as pontua????es foram de 72, 6; 70, 2; 4, 1 e 10, 9 e no modelo 2, 71, 7; 71, 3; 2, 7 e 5, 0 respectivamente. Na avalia????o em cada um dos grupos, os agricultores concordaram com os resultados obtidos nos modelos, comprovando sua validade e robustez frente aos modelos constru??dos. The farm {{production}} systems, in general, {{have a certain}} degree of complexity because it involves a set of variables that the farmer can not always control, and requires a decision-making. The farmer does it considering his rationality based on his objectives, perception, intuition, and information. Even with all these precautions, <b>it</b> <b>s</b> <b>not</b> always easy to make those decisions, and so they often need some support or some tool to assist them, even more when the production systems involve practices and/or organic production processes or with technological innovation. In these cases, the farmer needs to involve a number of internal and external elements to the rural property, interact with nature and {{know how to use it}} for the benefit of the production unit. A number of studies have been conducted to improve organic production processes, emphasizing its importance and its social, environmental and economic benefits, and the opportunities it brings. Potato organic production has evolved, but, being a system still in consolidation, it faces bottlenecks in production and in marketing, which should be studied deeper. Following this idea, the study aimed to construct models that aggregate different systems evaluation criteria of organic potato developed by family farmers from southern Rio Grande do Sul state. The study had the participation of a group that has been in the research project Rede de Refer??ncia (GRR) of Embrapa Clima Temperado, and another group out of the network (GFRR), associated with Cooperativas Sul Ecol??gica, Arpa-Sul and Coopar. To evaluate the organic potato system, the study used the decision aid multicriteria tool, which allows the inclusion of the subjective view of the actors involved in the decision-making context through formation of a mental frame of reference (QRM), composed of their personal beliefs, assumptions, values and preferences, through modeling criteria construction in a participatory manner. The study showed, in general, that the models constructed (1 -GRR and 2 -GFRR) do not differ much from the production practices adopted in each group. Nevertheless, the differences occurred in the levels of impact of actions, and in the establishment of different weights between the models, so the final result in order of preference of evaluation criteria was different. For GRR the criterion potato size was the most important, whereas for GFRR was the criterion production risks. When evaluated with four other organic potato production systems (A, B, C, and D), the two models performances were very close. In model 1 the scores were 72. 6; 70. 2; 4. 1, and 10. 9, and in model 2, 71. 7; 71. 3; 2. 7, and 5. 0, respectively. In the assessment of each group, the farmers agreed with the results obtained in the models, proving their validity and robustness against the models constructed...|$|E
40|$|Before leaving CTA in late March 2000 {{to take up}} his {{new post}} as Head of the Technical Advisory Division at the International Fund for Agricultural Development in Rome, Italy, Dr Cooke shared some {{insights}} into institutions and change with Spore. You are devoting much of your life to agriculture and development, but the words are strikingly absent from the agendas of today s international community. Not exactly. The preferred terms today are not agriculture and food security, but poverty reduction and rural development. In international negotiations many developed countries assume that ACP agriculture equates with developed country agriculture, with a very small slice of the GDP and a small share of employment. When I met with the development group of the European Parliament, they were genuinely surprised to hear the figures that we know well: agriculture means 30 - 60 % of GDP in sub-Saharan Africa and 70 % of jobs, of which 70 % are held by women. So {{the challenge is to}} ensure that the roles of agriculture are duly recognised in poverty reduction. Then the topic is on the agenda, but through that and other terms like poverty reduction, sustainable livelihoods, impact on equity, or the role of women, and not through agriculture and productivity and the classic banners of 20 years ago. These new terms are often applied in the context of domestic development, rather than that of {{a major player in the}} world agricultural economy. One of CTA s priority themes has been conquering regional and the global markets but also domestic. This is a fundamental difficulty. It s very difficult to get into global markets without having organised a national market: what are you going to trade? There is a supposition that some of the poorer countries can rapidly follow Asian models, forgetting that in almost all cases they went through an agro-industrial development process, generating the wealth to support education and to develop human capital. You can t leapfrog from essentially subsistence agriculture to a semi-industrialised economy unless you discover oil or diamonds, or you re fortunate with tourism. It s a process, and here the challenge for CTA is ensuring that institutional change takes place. All our ACP partners are in a very tough position, coping with economic and political change, decentralisation, technical change, and we re adding on to that 'PS: communicate better with your farmers, your decision takers, and your users'. It s easy to underestimate the barriers to that. If you ve been working in a research centre on oil palm in plantations, it requires considerable change to worry about women subsistence farmers in semi-arid zones. It requires changes in incentive, leadership, and organisation, moving from being supply-driven to responsive, and there are political, social and cultural constraints. What sort of timeframe are you talking about, and how do you recognise that change has taken place? Well, CTA has a 5 -year plan by virtue of being part of the Lomé Convention. For ACP partners the timescale must be longer. This is reflected in the switch away from project or even programme approaches to sectoral approaches. Very long-term processes must be confronted: democratisation and decentralisation, the promotion of sustainable organisations servicing the poor, the development of human capital. And the hardest of all: encompassing sustainable natural resource management with its trade-offs between short- and long-term gains. So we re talking about a long timeframe, but also about getting institutional imperatives correct, sooner rather than later. The results will take years. Our constituency has changed too. Ten years ago if you looked at a CTA annual report, it was all ministries of agriculture and the public sector. Now, we talk about our constituency being public and private. Regrettably there has been a lot of hesitation from some ACP governments. It s very difficult to get them to send a delegation to a meeting that isn t entirely public sector. To be fair, sometimes we suggest including women or NGO or private sector representatives but even when we have had the green light to invite a woman or have shortlisted a woman for a staff post she will often decline at the last minute for personal reasons. Change is happening faster in another field: information and communication technologies. One in nine Spore readers now has an email address This is a regular debate at our Advisory Committee, to what extent should we move our funds away from more traditional areas like video and rural radio to electronic on- and off-line techniques. We have tried to meet the clear needs of many partners who claim that they do not get neutral advice on these topics. We ve been going too slowly for some countries, and too fast for others. Everyone wants the maximum benefit from ICTs but they don t want us to stop doing any of the rest either. How can you encourage change? The whole process of change is a tricky one. Even within the small world of CTA, we have undergone considerable change. Some people feel that we changed too much, more than necessary to satisfy our stakeholders. That is correct if our stakeholders are interpreted as diplomats representing the EU or ACP in Europe; <b>it</b> <b>s</b> <b>not</b> correct if, as I hold, our stakeholders are the subsistence farmers in the poorer sectors of the poorer countries. ACP needs and priorities continue to change, further consultations and seminars are in train to respond to that, and I wish Carl Greenidge all the best in continuing to confront the high rate of change required to do the best for the farmers in the developing world.
