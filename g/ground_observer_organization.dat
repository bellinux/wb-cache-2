NGOs can be businesses, labor unions, research or academic institutes, native populations, gender-affiliated groups, youth groups, environmental activists, farmers, and agriculturists. Around 2,000 NGOs and 100 IGOs were admitted to the 2016 conference. Once an organization is admitted, {{they do not have to}} reapply for the following conference. Observers may submit responses, on behalf of their entire organization, relating to topics or mandates within the conference.|$|R

50|$|The NSSCC had a room {{dedicated}} as {{a filter}} center for monitoring communications and obtaining observations. The filter center had displays listing the orbiting and decayed satellites and a projector {{system that could}} show the motion of one satellite over the earth. The displays were devised by A/3C Peter P. Kamrowski. The center was manned by a Duty Controller and his assistants. The center was designed by Senior Controller 1st Lt Cotter, based on his earlier experience as a volunteer member of the USAF <b>Ground</b> <b>Observer</b> Corps (the <b>Ground</b> <b>Observer</b> Corps filter centers were in turn based on United Kingdom aircraft tracking centers developed during World War II to track Nazi aircraft).|$|R
50|$|The initial {{assignment}} for III Fighter Command, however, was {{the establishment of}} the Army Aircraft Warning Training Center at Drew in June 1941, while the runways were still under construction. The early Air Defense network in the United States consisted of a mixture of civilian <b>Ground</b> <b>Observers,</b> with Army <b>ground</b> units operating primitive early warning RADAR radio detection and ranging) technology which had been developed in the late 1930s. The mission of III FC was the organization and training of civilian and military Aircraft Warning Units, and to provide trained cadres of personnel to the <b>Ground</b> <b>Observer</b> and RADAR units activated. This mission continued throughout the war, with SCR-270 (mobile) and the SCR-271 (fixed) radars, with ground control intercept radar (SCR-588) being added during 1943 for close-in coverage (up to 50 miles) for tracking and controlling fighters from the ground. During the war, <b>Ground</b> <b>Observer</b> posts in the United States were established ss part of the civil air defense network. The Aircraft Warning Training Center at Drew (Eventually designated as the 343d Army Air Force Base Unit) ended in February 1945, the mission being transferred to Fourth Air Force at Hamilton Field, California.|$|R

40|$|The {{theory of}} {{broadband}} shock associated noise from supersonic jets in flight previously {{developed in the}} nozzle fixed coordinates is extended to the coordinate system of a stationary <b>ground</b> <b>observer.</b> The extended theory is relevant to community noise and aircraft certification noise prediction. Since the noise source is unaffected by which coordinate system of reference the radiated noise is measured, the same noise source model is retained in the present formulation. Only kinematic arguments are needed in the analysis. A formula for the noise power spectrum as measured by a <b>ground</b> <b>observer</b> is derived. The formula is applicable to hot as well as cold jets. This formula exhibits a form of Doppler shift in the noise spectrum. However, there is no high power convective amplification factor as some other investigators have proposed...|$|R

Di use laser re ection hazards exist for water cloud surfaces less than 722 m in altitude and ice cloud surfaces less than 850 m in altitude. Specular re ections from ice crystals in cirrus clouds are not probable; however, any specular re ection is a hazard to <b>ground</b> <b>observers.</b> The hazard to the laser operators and any <b>ground</b> <b>observers</b> during heavy fog conditions is of such signi cant magnitude that the laser should not be operated in fog...|$|R
