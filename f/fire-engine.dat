5|$|Experimental {{electric}} fire-engines {{were made}} for testing in France, Germany and England starting {{in the latter part}} of the nineteenth century. Siemens Brothers Company of London built and experimented with an electric fire engine in 1891. It was shown at the Royal Naval Exhibition in England in 1892. The Paris Fire Department experimented with a self-propelled electric fire engine in 1899. The French electric fire engine, known to them as the automobile pump, was first exhibited at the 1900 World's Fair in Paris and became very popular during its first six months of successful operation. It was demonstrated that this electric <b>fire-engine</b> allowed firemen to begin to extinguish a fire four minutes earlier than a steam fire engine. The <b>fire-engine</b> was self-propelled by on board batteries, and carried a water tank with hundreds of gallons of water that could be used immediately at the site of the fire. The hoses were then connected to the city fire hydrants for more water if needed for a large fire. In 1901, the Paris Fire Department put an electric fire engine into successful operation that also had a hook-and-ladder wagon. It had an electric motor-driven water pump to which hoses were attached for the firemen to use.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} engines {{were small}} and were either carried by four men, or mounted on skids and dragged to a fire. As the engines grew larger they became horse-drawn and later self-propelled by steam engines. John Ericsson is credited with building the first American steam-powered fire engine. John Braithwaite built the first steam <b>fire-engine</b> in Britain.|$|E
500|$|Reagan's {{wardrobe}} {{consisted of}} dresses, gowns, and suits made by luxury designers, including James Galanos, Bill Blass, and Oscar de la Renta. Her white, hand-beaded, one shoulder Galanos 1981 inaugural gown {{was estimated to}} cost $10,000, while the overall price of her inaugural wardrobe was said to cost $25,000. She favored the color red, calling it [...] "a picker-upper", and wore it accordingly. Her wardrobe included red so often that the <b>fire-engine</b> shade became known as [...] "Reagan red". She employed two private hairdressers, who would style her hair {{on a regular basis}} in the White House.|$|E
50|$|When ships {{loaded with}} {{valuable}} cargoes are berthed together in crowded docks surrounded by warehouses, a fire can be disastrous. Although land-based <b>fire-engines</b> {{are able to}} reach much of the fire ground, waterborne <b>fire-engines,</b> or fire-floats, can fight the fire from the water (outside the UK fire-floats {{are commonly known as}} fireboats).|$|R

500|$|American {{inventor}} Schuyler Wheeler patented {{an electric}} fire engine {{system in the}} United States in 1885. He filed his invention in 1882 and the patent was issued in 1885. The system included electrical infrastructure, with electric motor driven water pumps, on a horse drawn vehicle. The <b>fire-engine</b> vehicle was designed with the same general equipment as a regular steam fire engine of the time, but used electrically operated equipment instead of steam power. It was designed with an electrical regulator, and a switch for the main electric motor that drove the water pump, that pushed water through the fire-hoses used {{to put out the}} fire.|$|E
500|$|For the film, cinematographer Russell Carpenter used a 1.85 {{aspect ratio}} shot with Arri Alexa XT and M cameras, using the M for fight {{sequences}} and helicopter filming. Camera operator Peter Rosenfeld said, [...] "Russell and Peyton's decision to shoot in 1.85 {{was a good}} call, since at 2.35 there's insufficient height in frame to appreciate the vertical aspects of [...] going from standing full-size to falling {{through a crack in}} the floor." [...] Carpenter and Technicolor also devised a lookup table (LUT) to darken the color palette. Carpenter said, [...] "For a lot of recent comedies I've kept my LUTs kind of 'Kodak' – saturated and upbeat. But this show needed something different that affected skin tones and the Ant-Man suit, which dates back to the 1980s, so it looks a little run-down. What I loved about this LUT was how it allowed the costume to retain the color but took it from <b>fire-engine</b> red to something a little more weathered." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{multi-part}} floating work Guidepost to the New Space, {{a series}} of rounded [...] "humps" [...] in <b>fire-engine</b> red with white polka dots, was displayed in Pandanus Lake. Perhaps one of Kusama's most notorious works, various versions of Narcissus Garden have been presented worldwide venues including Le Consortium, Dijon, 2000; Kunstverein Braunschweig, 2003; {{as part of the}} Whitney Biennial in Central Park, New York in 2004; and at the Jardin de Tuileries in Paris, 2010.|$|E
2500|$|Hove's new fire station, {{replacing}} {{an outdated}} facility in George Street, opened on 2 June 1926. [...] James Barnes & Sons of Brighton built it to Clayton & Black's design {{at a cost}} of £11,098. [...] It was closed in 1976 when a new station opened elsewhere, and was converted into flats between 1978 and 1981. [...] Clayton & Black's design was [...] "elegant": a [...] "charming" [...] bellcote on the roof bore similarities with that at Hove Manor, demolished soon afterwards, and the <b>fire-engine</b> entrances were arched.|$|E
2500|$|The Great Exhibition {{was opened}} on 1 May 1851 by Queen Victoria. It {{was the first}} of the World's Fair {{exhibitions}} of culture and industry. There were some 100,000 objects, displayed along more than ten miles, by over 15,000 contributors. [...] Britain occupied half the display space inside with exhibits from the home country and the Empire. France was the largest foreign contributor. [...] The exhibits were grouped into four main categories—Raw Materials, Machinery, Manufacturers and Fine Arts. The exhibits ranged from the Koh-i-Noor diamond, Sevres porcelain and music organs to a massive hydraulic press and a <b>fire-engine.</b> There was also a 27-foot tall Crystal Fountain.|$|E

2500|$|An early device used {{to squirt}} water onto a fire {{was known as}} a squirt or fire syringe. Hand squirts and hand pumps are noted before Ctesibius of Alexandria invented the first fire pump around the 2nd century B.C., and an example of a force-pump {{possibly}} used for a <b>fire-engine</b> is mentioned by Heron of Alexandria. [...] The fire pump was reinvented in Europe during the 16th century, reportedly used in Augsburg in 1518 and Nuremberg in 1657. A book of 1655 inventions mentions a steam engine (called a fire engine) pump used to [...] "raise a column of water [...] ", but {{there was no mention of}} whether it was portable.|$|E
2500|$|After the 1957 season, the Italian {{motorcycle}} manufacturers Gilera, Moto Guzzi and Mondial jointly {{agreed to}} withdraw from Grand Prix competition due to escalating costs and diminishing sales. Count Agusta originally agreed to withdraw, but then had second thoughts. MV Agusta went on to dominate Grand Prix racing, winning 17 consecutive 500cc world championships. [...] Count Agusta's competitive nature usually saw him hire {{some of the best}} riders of the time, namely Carlo Ubbiali, John Surtees, Mike Hailwood, Giacomo Agostini, Phil Read, among others, and having the best engineers, most notably Arturo Magni. The three- and four-cylinder race bikes were known for their excellent road handling. The <b>fire-engine</b> red racing machines became a hallmark of Grand Prix racing in the 1960s and early 1970s.|$|E

They won first prize at the first official rock-festival of the Soviet Union which took place in Tbilisi thanks to their hit [...] "Lady Blues" [...] and became the stars of Yerevan-81 international pop-rock-festival. [...] "Garbed in <b>fire-engine</b> red pants and white shirt decorated with a splashy 7-Up emblem, Graps sang: [...] "Since we have nowhere else to make love/we do it out in the open/And sometimes the rain washes away the makeup/from her face—and mine", wrote Time magazine in 1981.|$|E
60|$|It {{soon became}} very {{evident that the}} fire was in truth somewhere about the docks, for not only was a dense cloud of smoke seen rising in that direction, but <b>fire-engines</b> began to dash from side streets everywhere, and to rush towards the smoke {{as if they were}} sentient things {{impatient}} for the fray.|$|R

60|$|Little wonder, then, {{that the}} firemen of Watling Street turned out all their engines, {{including}} two of Shand and Mason's new land-steam <b>fire-engines,</b> which had {{at that time}} just been brought into action. Little wonder that the usual request for a man from each station was changed into an urgent demand for every man that could possibly be spared.|$|R

60|$|The station-master had not {{finished}} his speech {{before we were}} all hastening {{in the direction of}} the fire. The road topped a low hill, and there was a great widespread whitewashed building in front of us, spouting fire at every chink and window, while in the garden in front three <b>fire-engines</b> were vainly striving to keep the flames under.|$|R
6000|$|And {{still we}} walked in {{immediate}} quietude. Nothing was happening where we were. The police and the automobile patrols went by, and once half a dozen <b>fire-engines,</b> returning evidently from some conflagration. A question was called to the fireman by an officer in an automobile, and we heard one shout in reply: [...] "No water! They've blown up the mains!" ...|$|R
60|$|The <b>fire-engine</b> {{had struck}} still {{farther to the}} north, into a region {{that they did not}} recognise; and as it ran by a line of high {{railings}} shadowed with trees, the six friends were startled, but somewhat relieved, to see the President leap from the <b>fire-engine,</b> though whether through another whim or the increasing protest of his entertainers they could not see. Before the three cabs, however, could reach up to the spot, he had gone up the high railings like a huge grey cat, tossed himself over, and vanished in a darkness of leaves.|$|E
60|$|Before Master Thurston could reply, the clang and {{rattle of}} a <b>fire-engine</b> broke upon the stillness, {{and all three}} rushed out of the stand in the {{shortest}} possible time.|$|E

50|$|German {{formations}} from KG 2 and 6 {{carried a}} mixed ordnance SC500s, AB500s, AB1000s and BC50s for the attack. Colchester was hit badly by 1,400 incendiaries which started a large {{fire in the}} town centre. 15 properties were destroyed and 99 damaged. 75 <b>fire-engines</b> and two million gallons were needed to extinguish the flames. There was only one casualty in the town and no fatalities.|$|R
50|$|They {{are named}} after Edward Field, their inventor, and were {{originally}} developed for steam <b>fire-engines</b> where speed of raising steam was important. More recently, Field-tube boilers {{have been most}} widely used by French manufacturers, either for small vertical boilers, or as a marine boiler. The use {{of this type of}} Field tube has also been researched for the transfer of heat from nuclear reactors, vacuum condensers and heat exchangers.|$|R
60|$|From the {{reservoirs}} extremely strong iron pipes lead {{down to the}} gravel, and to the end {{of these}} pipes are fitted movable nozzles, like those of <b>fire-engines,</b> but far larger. The water pours out through these nozzles with tremendous force, breaking up the gravel, and washing it away down a long series of wooden troughs, in which the gold settles, and is caught by a variety of contrivances.|$|R
