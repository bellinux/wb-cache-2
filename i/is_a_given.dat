Shrinkage is most evident when afro-hair is (or has recently been) wet. The more coiled the hair texture, the higher its shrinkage.|$|E

25|$|The Sikh gurus {{established}} a mechanism which allowed the Sikh religion to react {{as a community}} to changing circumstances. The sixth guru, Guru Hargobind, {{was responsible for the}} creation of the concept of Akal Takht (throne of the timeless one), which serves as the supreme decision-making centre of Sikhism and sits opposite the Harmandir Sahib. The Sarbat Ḵẖālsā (a representative portion of the Khalsa Panth) historically gathers at the Akal Takht on special festivals such as Vaisakhi or Hola Mohalla and when {{there is a need to}} discuss matters that affect the entire Sikh nation. A gurmatā (literally, guru's intention) is an order passed by the Sarbat Ḵẖālsā in the presence of the Gurū Granth Sāhib. A gurmatā may only be passed on a subject that affects the fundamental principles of Sikh religion; it is binding upon all Sikhs. The term hukamnāmā (literally, edict or royal order) is often used interchangeably with the term gurmatā. However, a hukamnāmā formally refers to a hymn from the Gurū Granth Sāhib which <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>given</b> order to Sikhs.|$|E

The selections on this album seem to be the fruition of that search for musical renewal". He cited [...] "Beautiful Mess" [...] and [...] "I Believe" [...] as standout tracks. Ray Waddell of Billboard also thought that the singles were among the best tracks on the album, while highlighting the instrumental track [...] "Rural Philharmonic" [...] (which Olander had originally intended to record for a solo album) {{as an example of the}} band's strong musicianship. Chrissie Dickinson of The Chicago Tribune was less favorable, commending the [...] "masterful musicianship" [...] and Roe's [...] "light vocal timbre", while criticizing the song selections as [...] "mostly a paint-by-numbers trip around the musical block, from the predictable power balladry of 'I Believe' to the saccharine sentiments of 'We All Fall Down.'" ...|$|E

It's not long before Drake's added on rap kicks in with clever, sexy and romantic rhyming. Then the dreamy drum machine rhythms and Rihanna's vocals kick in again. This is a hit... "What's My Name?" [...] is a good addition to that romantic evening playlist." [...] Jocelyn Vena from MTV praised the [...] "song's chorus" [...] and [...] "Drake's verse". Molly Lambert of Pitchfork Media praised Rihanna's performance saying that [...] "On 'What's My Name', Rihanna doesn't have {{to tell us how}} desirable she is – it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>given.</b> There is never any doubt in her delivery that Rihanna really might as well be the only girl in the world".|$|E

Writing for Canyon News in July 2009, Tommy Garrett applauded Wood for making the role [...] "believable" [...] and noted that fans have [...] "readily accepted her as the surviving twin of Ridge and Taylor's", saying: [...] "Stepping into a role that has been played {{by more than one}} actress would be a very daunting task for a lesser actress. But Jacqueline has embraced the role and made it her own." [...] Garrett enjoys Wood playing a story in which she is [...] "shocked to learn things". While criticizing the material written for the character as being [...] "often repetitive and silly", Sara Bibel of Xfinity opined in June 2012 that Wood is a [...] "charismatic actress" [...] who rises above the script to [...] "deliver consistently interesting performances". In July 2012, Soaps In Depth commended Wood's performance, observing that [...] "While her sexiness <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>given,</b> Wood has a way of bringing a cool, copacetic attitude to her scenes", while praising her ability to infuse [...] "both melancholy and mirth" [...] in her performance. In March 2015, Michael Logan of TV Insider called Steffy [...] "that maddeningly complicated sexbomb".|$|E
