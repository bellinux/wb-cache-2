25|$|Following {{the end of}} {{the first}} season, {{producer}} Robert H. Justman decided to prank Nimoy. He had partially convinced Nimoy that it would have been preferable to have permanent plastic surgery to point the tips of his ears instead of requiring the hour and a half of makeup each day to apply them. It was only when Nimoy began to agree with Justman's suggestion that the producer let on that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke,</b> which Nimoy found amusing. Nimoy became unhappy with his pay during the course of the season, since Shatner was being paid more than he was. But he was asked by the producers to table the discussion until confirmation was received that the series was renewed.|$|E
25|$|Back at the square, Kitri and Basilio join {{those who}} are dancing. At {{the height of the}} merriment, Lorenzo and Gamache arrive, {{followed}} by Don Quixote and Sancho. Seeing his daughter, Lorenzo decides to give his blessing to her union with the nobleman Gamache. Basilio becomes annoyed and, reproaching Kitri for her unfaithfulness, draws a sword and stabs himself. As he lies dying he begs Lorenzo to unite him with Kitri, but Lorenzo and Gamache refuse. Don Quixote approaches Gamache and challenges him to a duel for having refused a dying man's wish. Gamache declines to fight and the merrymakers drive him out of the inn. Taking pity, Lorenzo agrees to unite Basilio and Kitri. At this moment, Basilio pulls out the sword and tells everyone <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke.</b>|$|E
25|$|Skillet {{formed in}} 1996 with two members: John Cooper, former vocalist for Tennessee {{progressive}} rock band Seraph, and Ken Steorts, former guitarist for Urgent Cry. The two bands met through touring together, but those bands disbanded soon after, so John and Ken's pastor {{encouraged them to}} form their own band as a side-project. Coming from different styles of rock music, they decided to name the experiment Skillet. After, Trey McClurkin joined the band as a temporary drummer. Skillet was only together for a month when they received interest from major Christian record label ForeFront Records. In 1996 they released a self-titled debut Skillet. It was well-received, and the trio continued to write new material as they toured the United States. One topic that comes up often among fans and the band itself, is the name 'Skillet'. John Cooper, the lead vocalist, explains that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> at first. Each starting band member was already in a separate band, and all decided to start a side project. Since each other band had a different sound and style to it, the side project {{was said to be}} like putting all of those styles in a big skillet {{to come up with something}} unique, hence the band name 'Skillet'. The band name is still somewhat of a joke between the band members, especially Cooper, who claims to still not like the title.|$|E

25|$|Fincher {{intended}} to make The Game before Seven, but when Brad Pitt became available for Seven, that project took priority. The success of Seven helped the producers of The Game get the larger budget that they wanted. Then, they approached Michael Douglas to star in the film. He was hesitant at first because of concerns that PolyGram was not a big enough company to distribute the film. However, once on board, Douglas' presence helped get the film into production. At the 1996 Cannes Film Festival, PolyGram announced that Jodie Foster would be starring in the film with Douglas. However, Fincher was uncomfortable with putting a movie star of her stature in a supporting part. After talking to her, he considered rewriting the character of Conrad as Nicholas' daughter so that Foster could play that role. However, the actress had a scheduling conflict with the Robert Zemeckis film Contact and could not appear in The Game. Once she left, the role of Conrad was offered to Jeff Bridges but he declined and Sean Penn was cast instead. Deborah Kara Unger's audition {{for the role of}} Christine was a test reel consisting of a two-minute sex scene from David Cronenberg's Crash. Douglas thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> but when he and Fincher met her in person, they were impressed by her acting.|$|E
25|$|The last {{murder to}} involve Gravano was {{the murder of}} Louie DiBono, the made man Gravano had {{threatened}} to kill earlier. Gravano described {{the reasons for the}} murder in Underboss: He was still robbing the family and I asked for permission to take him out. But John had a meeting with DiBono, and DiBono told John that he had a billion dollars of drywall work that was coming out of the World Trade Center. John bit, hook, line and sinker, and refused my request. John said he would handle DiBono personally and become his partner. But DiBono was up to his old tricks double-dealing. He had obviously been bullshitting John. So when John called Louie in for meetings to discuss their new partnership, DiBono didn't show up. John was humiliated. This meant an automatic death penalty. John gave the contract to DiBono's captain, Pat Conte. Conte botched an ideal opportunity to kill DiBono. Then, as Gotti grew increasingly impatient, Conte explained that the problem now was trying to corner DiBono again. Whenever a meeting with him was arranged, DiBono never appeared. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke,</b> what was going on. I couldn't help laughing to myself. I told John why didn't Pat simplify everything. Just call Louie up and tell him to hang himself. Ten months went by. John looks like an asshole. He was too embarrassed even to ask me for help.|$|E

Rankin later {{retracted}} the story, claiming <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke,</b> but the rumour persisted, with a report in 2012 in The Guardian speculating that Rowling's next book would be a crime novel.

I think he would have been big if he'd been straightened out {{at the beginning of his}} career," [...] comments Phil Solomon about Morrison. [...] "He was on a downer and he was drinking. He wasn't the most bankable of artists. He had been the frontman for another of those R & B bands that had gone up the Swanee and there were three or four versions of Them touring. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke.</b> He was no gift.

Morrison commented of Them: [...] "Them were never meant to be on Top of the Pops. I mean, miming? lip syncing? We used to laugh at that programme, think <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke.</b> Then we were on it ourselves. It was ridiculous. We were totally anti that sort of thing.

I banged the phone down not believing a word of what he said". However, after meeting Bhradwaj and hearing a script reading, he loved the story and accepted the offer. The actors Chandan Roy Sanyal, Shiv Subramnayam, Hrishikesh Joshi, Rajatava Dutta and Deb Mukherjee were cast in supporting roles. For the role of drug dealer Tashi, Bhardwaj chose his friend Tenzing Nimaa tour operator in Mussooriesaying he had the character and attitude he wanted, and a weird sense of humour.|$|E
500|$|After {{the first}} rumour circulated, Joe Goddard created a reverse rumour, saying that Minogue {{had written a}} track for Hot Chip. He told NME, [...] "Kylie wrote a song for us, She sent it through our {{management}} to us– it was totally bizarre. It was {{the beginnings of a}} track– I think she wrote it and just thought, 'This would be perfect for Hot Chip', or possibly for a collaboration. It's a crazy song. It's industrial and clanging and even has farmyard animal noises on it. It's the kind of music you'd never normally associate with Kylie. When I'm allowed to send it around it's going to change a few people's ideas about her. Maybe it's one for our next album, after Made in the Dark." [...] Taylor later admitted that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> created to fool people because the band were tired of people phoning them up to ask why Minogue had apparently rejected a song she did not hear.

500|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Traktor, a Swedish directing team known for several TV advertisements.

In an interview with Norwegian newspaper Dagbladet, Ole Sanders from Traktor recalled that in May 2002 Madonna sent them a handwritten letter, along with a demo version of [...] "Die Another Day". The team was in Prague, shooting a music video for The Prodigy. [...] "We thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke,</b> since the letter was long and handwritten.

He was then asked to go to Pinewood Studios in London to watch a half-finished version of the Bond film with producer Barbara Broccoli.

500|$|John Williams {{composed}} the film's score, which earned him an Academy Award {{and was later}} ranked the sixth-greatest score by the American Film Institute. The main [...] "shark" [...] theme, a simple alternating pattern of two notes — variously identified as [...] "E and F" [...] or [...] "F and F sharp" [...] — became a classic piece of suspense music, synonymous with approaching danger (see leading-tone). Williams described the theme as [...] "grinding away at you, just as a shark would do, instinctual, relentless, unstoppable." [...] The piece was performed by tuba player Tommy Johnson. When asked by Johnson why the melody was written in such a high register and not played by the more appropriate French horn, Williams responded that {{he wanted it to}} sound [...] "a little more threatening". When Williams first demonstrated his idea to Spielberg, playing just the two notes on a piano, Spielberg was said to have laughed, thinking that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke.</b> As Williams saw similarities between Jaws and pirate movies, at other points in the score he evoked [...] "pirate music", which he called [...] "primal, but fun and entertaining". Calling for rapid, percussive string playing, the score contains echoes of La mer by Claude Debussy as well of Igor Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring.|$|E
500|$|Music {{historian}} Simon Reynolds {{argues that}} McLaren {{came into his}} own as an auteur only after the group's break-up, with The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle and the recruitment of Ronnie Biggs as a vocalist. Much subsequent commentary on the Sex Pistols has relied on taking seriously McLaren's onscreen proclamations in the film, whether lending them credence or not. As music journalist Dave Thompson noted in 2000, [...] "oday, Swindle is viewed {{by many as the}} truth" [...] (despite the fact that the movie purveys, among other things, a completely illiterate Steve Jones, a talking dog, and Sid Vicious shooting audience members, including his mother, at the conclusion of [...] "My Way").

[...] In an interview featured on the third season DVD, Whedon joked that the [...] "Business School" [...] episode and his former TV show were very similar because [...] "Buffy [...] was sad and depressing but... it was funny. Especially when people died. And {{a lot of people do}} die in [...]" [...] But upon completing the episode, Whedon stated [...] "That was just coincidence. But that's how that happened. God, it was fun." [...] Whedon stated that he was surprised with the amount of input he was allowed with the script. [...] "I wouldn't say freedom to do things with it...But way more input was asked for than I would have ever anticipated." [...] At Pam's art show, the pieces which she was supposed to have painted didn't suit Whedon. [...] "I got to the set and saw Pam's art, and I was like, 'This is not right.'" [...] Whedon said that he held up filming for over an hour until the staff was able create new pieces of art.|$|E
