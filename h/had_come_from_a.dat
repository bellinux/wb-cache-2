His father Hesketh Brodrick Prichard, an officer in the King's Own Scottish Borderers, died from typhoid six weeks before he was born, leading him to be raised alone by his mother, Kate O'Brien Ryall Prichard. She herself <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> {{military}} family, her father being Major-General Browne William Ryall.|$|E
5|$|Butlin's {{inspiration}} for his holiday empire <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> holiday to Barry Island in his twenties, {{when he had}} been locked out of his B all day by his landlady. He finally decided to build the last and smallest of the camps there in 1965. Butlin took out a 99-year lease on the headland at Nell's Point, Barry Island, in 1966. Building work began there in the winter and the gates opened to campers on 18 June 1966. Butlin retired in 1969 and the Barry Island camp was the last opening under his management.|$|E
5|$|On November 12, 2010, {{tourists}} found a jawbone on an Aruban beach {{near the}} Phoenix Hotel and Bubali Swamp. Preliminary examination by a forensic {{expert on the}} island determined that the bone was from a young woman. A part of the bone was sent to The Hague for testing by the Netherlands Forensic Institute. On November 23, 2010, Aruba Solicitor-General Taco Stein announced that—based on dental records—the jawbone was not from Holloway, {{and it was not}} possible to determine whether it <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> man or woman.|$|E

5|$|Pacino {{was born}} in the East Harlem {{neighborhood}} of New York City, to Sicilian-American parents Salvatore and Rose (née Gerardi) Pacino. His parents divorced when he was two years old. His mother then took him to The Bronx to live with her parents, Kate and James Gerardi, who, coincidentally, <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> town in Sicily named Corleone. His father, who was from San Fratello of Sicily, moved to Covina, California to work as an insurance salesman and restaurateur, and had not been in his life since then.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{uncovered}} after Lie's {{death in}} 1912 suggested that Siti Akbari was {{heavily influenced by}} the earlier Sjair Abdoel Moeloek (1847), variously credited to Raja Ali Haji or Saleha. This tale was transliterated by Arnold Snackey, then later translated into Sundanese. Sources disagree on the translator. The documentarian Christiaan Hooykaas, writing {{in a letter to}} literary critic Nio Joe Lan, suggested that Lie's inspiration <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> version of Sjair Abdoel Moeloek held in the Royal Batavian Society of Arts and Sciences Library in Batavia. Biographer Tio Ie Soei, meanwhile, suggested that the version which inspired Lie was translated in 1873 by Lie's teacher, Sierk Coolsma. According to Tio, Coolsma had based his translation off a stage performance and written it hurriedly, such that it was nearly illegible. As he had better handwriting, Lie purportedly copied the story for Coolsma and kept the original in his own collection. The literary historian Monique Zaini-Lajoubert writes that none of these intermediary versions has been found.|$|E
5|$|The 2013 season saw new staff, a new coach, Trent Robinson, {{and several}} new players, {{including}} big signings Michael Jennings, James Maloney, Luke O'Donnell and Sonny Bill Williams, {{arrive at the}} club. This culminated in the Roosters finishing the 2013 season with a 24–12 win over the South Sydney Rabbitohs, securing the minor premiership for the 2013 season and were the NRL's best attacking and defensive team. The Roosters defeated the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles 4–0, in week one of the finals, earning a week's rest. The Roosters defeated the Newcastle Knights 40–14 in week three of the NRL finals, progressing to the 2013 NRL grand final, facing the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles, winning 26–18. It was a great comeback by the Roosters, down by 10 {{points in the second}} half they went on to score three consecutive tries to seal the win and their 13th premiership. They then {{went on to win the}} 2014 World Club Challenge against Wigan 36–14 to claim the treble of club titles. No team in premiership history <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> lower ladder position to win the following season’s title.|$|E

5|$|The novel Soon I Will Be Invincible is {{the first}} novel by Austin Grossman, an {{established}} video games designer. Grossman <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> literary family, son of Judith and Allen Grossman and brother of Lev Grossman, which had fostered his ambition to write his own novel. Instead, Grossman accepted a job working in the video game medium which he credited with teaching him to realistically portray creative characters and situations. He always {{had an interest in}} the superhero genre, citing Alan Moore and Frank Miller as literary influences. In the mid-1990s, the idea behind what would become his first novel came to him {{in the form of a}} supervillain's voice. Grossman spent the next few years casually developing the character that would become Dr. Impossible, adding supporting characters, and writing short stories. By 2006, Penguin's imprint Michael Joseph purchased the publishing rights for the UK, as did Rizzoli for an Italian version. By the time, the book was being published Grossman was 37 years old and had entered the University of California-Berkeley's doctoral program studying English Literature, specializing in Romantic and Victorian literature.|$|E
25|$|Analysis {{indicated}} that the DNA collected {{at the crime scene}} did not match any of the suspects—and that it <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> single, as yet unknown person.

25|$|By {{this point}} Hamilton was well-honoured. However, {{by now he}} {{supported}} eugenics. He heard a story that HIV had been created from an accident with a polio vaccine, which it was thought could have been contaminated with a chimp virus. This supported his idea that modern medicine could be negative, as he thought medicine opposed {{the logic of the}} genes. So he travelled to eastern Congo to look for the virus, amid the murder and chaos. He died, and later research disproved the idea that HIV <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> medical accident.|$|E

While Emma felt that Arjun's negotiations on this matter had been poor for not including her or Zoe, Nick questioned why Instinct had relinquished the candle lamps, when it <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> brand name already being sold {{by one of the}} retailers.|$|E
25|$|According to interim Prime Minister Jean Kambanda's {{testimony}} to the ICTR, President Mobutu Sese Seko of neighboring Zaire (now DRC) had warned Habyarimana {{not to go to}} Dar es Salaam on April 6. Mobutu reportedly said this warning <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> very senior official in the Elysée Palace in Paris. There was a link between this warning, said Mobutu, and the subsequent suicide in the Elysée of François de Grossouvre, a senior high-ranking official working for President François Mitterrand, an official who had killed himself on April 7 after learning about the downing of the Falcon.|$|E
25|$|Those {{witnesses}} and other witnesses from the Forensic Science Service told the Court of Appeal {{that this was}} not the right conclusion to draw from the discovery of the particle of FDR. It was instead no more likely that the particle <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> gun fired by Barry George than that it had come from some other source. The Court of Appeal concluded that, if this evidence had been given to the jury at the trial, there was no certainty that the jury would have found George guilty. For this reason his conviction had to be quashed.|$|E

He also told the court how brothers and sisters of Sinclair's dead brother-in-law, Gordon Hamilton, had provided samples for DNA testing, and {{that the results of}} these tests had been compared with the semen found in the bodies of the victims. He explained that the results obtained are what he would expect, if semen found in the victims <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> brother of the surviving Hamiltons.

25|$|On 9 January 1813, Fawn {{captured}} the Spanish brig Teneriffe {{and sent her}} into Port Cavello. From her Fellowes found out that her captor {{was one of three}} American privateers that <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> rendezvous between Beata and Saint Domingo. Fawn set out in pursuit and on 10 January Fellowes sighted a strange vessel. After a long and arduous chase during which the batteries of Port Cavello fired on the privateer to prevent her entering, Fawn succeeded in chasing the American privateer Rosamond, of eight guns and 105 or 120 men, on shore. Rosamond ran on shore on Point Hicacos where her captain and 24 men drowned in attempting to reach the land. Rosamond had on board $100,000 in specie and valuable merchandize, the plunder of various English and Spanish vessels.|$|E
25|$|To {{prove the}} antiquity and {{authenticity}} of their claims, the Beta Israel cite the 9th-century CE testimony of Eldad ha-Dani (the Danite), {{from a time}} before the Zagwean dynasty was established. Eldad was a Jewish man of dark skin who appeared in Egypt and created a stir in that Jewish community (and elsewhere in the Mediterranean Jewish communities he visited) with claims that he <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> Jewish kingdom of pastoralists far to the south. The only language Eldad spoke was a hitherto unknown dialect of Hebrew. Although he strictly followed the Mosaic commandments, his observance differed in some details from Rabbinic halakhah. Some observers thought {{that he might be}} a Karaite, although his practice also differed from theirs. He carried Hebrew books that supported his explanations of halakhah. He cited ancient authorities in the scholarly traditions of his own people.|$|E

25|$|On June 22, 1739, {{the town}} of Stockbridge was incorporated, and the Rev. Arthur Lawrence, a Stockbridge historian, found it very {{probable}} that Timothy {{was responsible for the}} name, as the Woodbridges <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> neighboring town of Stockbridge, Hampshire. Due to its new status, town officers had to be elected, and Timothy was chosen for town clerk. One of the conditions of the grant was that four new English families be allowed to settle there, and Timothy's brother Joseph, who became an important citizen, soon joined him. This same year, Timothy was involved in a land swap with the Indians, trading 280 acres of riverfront land in Stockbridge for some 4000 acres in what is now the city of Lenox, his part of which was 480 acres. In 1743, the Mahicans wrote to Governor Shirley, asking that lands be confirmed to Timothy and Ephraim Williams, Jr., and the next year, Timothy sold some of his land granted by the General Court to Ephraim, Sr.|$|E
