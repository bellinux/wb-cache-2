40|$|Faced {{with the}} growing needs of {{resource}} materials and the requirements of environmental protection in a vision of sustainable development, it became necessary to study all the possibilities of reuse and recycling of industrial wastes and by-product especially {{in the field of}} civil engineering. There is an increasing interest in limestone fines from limestone quarries in concrete construction to overcome inherent deficiencies in river sand in particular regions of North Africa. Limestone sand is a by-product of the quarry process and typically does not have a significant demand due to its high content of small particles whose diameters are less than 80 ?m. This work is part of the promotion of local products such as waste from the quarry crushing (limestone sand) in the region of Laghouat (Algeria) and waste from the manufacture of agglomerated <b>expanded</b> <b>cork,</b> using them in the making of cement materials for construction primarily for thermal insulation. To study the influence {{of the size of the}} aggregates on the physico-mechanical and thermal properties of concrete, two classes of granular aggregates are used 3 / 8 and 8 / 15. The results obtained showed that the reduction weight of concrete containing crushed sand with <b>expanded</b> <b>cork</b> significantly reduces its thermal conductivity which improves their thermal insulation, but causes a drop in the strength of concrete produced. Lightweight concrete with <b>expanded</b> <b>cork</b> granules 3 / 8 are the lightest and most isolated, and they have low mechanical strength compared to concrete with lightweight aggregates 8 / 15...|$|E

Prototypes for flooring and wall covering were assembled. The prototypes for flooring had three layers: the previously mentioned woods and black cork agglomerate (top layer), pine wood (middle layer) and Rubbercork (bottom layer). The prototypes for wall coverings {{were based on the}} <b>expanded</b> <b>cork</b> regranulate and glue, adding barks or shavings of E. maculata, E. botryoides or Q. faginea. Physical and mechanical tests were made to measure hardness and swelling for the floor prototypes, concluding that the prototype with E. maculata has a higher hardness (41 N. mm- 2) and lower swelling, and therefore an improved performance. For wall covering products physical and mechanical testes were made to determine hardness, strength and thermal conductivity. The prototypes made with bark chips had the highest density 316 kg. m- 3), hardness (2, 9 MPa), traction (0, 19 MPa) and the highest thermal conductivity (0, 044 W/m.

40|$|The use of soil {{construction}} {{dates back}} to the beginning of our civilization. In the South of Portugal there is still a large number of buildings with rammed earth walls, but this technology has been falling into disuse since the middle of last century. The earth construction is highly sustainable since earth is a local material and is 100 % reusable. The buildings with rammed earth walls have a high thermal inertia which, given the climate characteristics Portugal, enjoys its thermal behavior. However, it is desirable that the thermal conductivity of the rammed earth were lower. Environmental concerns related to energy consumption associated with comfort in housing and construction, transportation and application of materials used in construction, has led us to seek new solutions in building typologies on earth. Considering these aspects and aiming to improve the energy efficiency in buildings with rammed earth walls, this paper presents the results of tests performed in laboratory to characterize phisical properties of several compositions containing soil and <b>expanded</b> granulated <b>cork.</b> Compositions were considered soil and <b>expanded</b> granulated <b>cork</b> having the following percentages of <b>expanded</b> granulated <b>cork,</b> 0 %, 10 %, 15 %, 20 % and 25 %. In order to characterize the different compositions from the point of view of mechanical and thermal performance, cubes were produced with 10 centimeters edge and assayed in order to calculate its compression resistance and its thermal conductivity. The results showed that the use of this type of building typologies on earth with the incorporation of <b>expanded</b> granulated <b>cork</b> allows to increase your performance by making it possible to adapt this typology needs of today, including the demands of the Portuguese legislation. The results of this research can be applied, with the appropriate adaptations, both in buildings in rammed earth and in buildings in adobe...|$|R

40|$|Available at ScienceDirectThe {{effects of}} {{temperature}} on anatomical and chemical characteristics of Quercus cerris cork were examined. Cork samples {{were subjected to}} isothermal air heating between 150 ◦C and 400 ◦C and analyzed for mass loss, cellular structure and chemical composition. The thermal decomposition of Q. cerris cork {{is similar to that}} of Q. suber cork. Cork is thermally stable below 200 ◦C and after that degradation depended on temperature and heating time with increasing mass loss, i. e. 3 % at 200 ◦C 10 min and 46 % at 350 ◦C 60 min. With temperature and starting at 200 ◦C, cells expanded, cell wall thickness was reduced and corrugations were lost. Extractives degraded at lower temperatures, although aliphatic extractives were found to be more stable. Suberin from Q. cerris was more heat resistant than Q. suber suberin, while lignin showed similar resistance.

The heat transfer by conduction across these multilayer systems is simulated analytically under unsteady boundary conditions. The thermal delay is computed for multilayer concrete floors with varying numbers of layers and layer thicknesses. The mass density and thermal conductivity of the various materials were determined experimentally. Given its heterogeneity, the specific heat of the lightweight screed was obtained indirectly using both the experimental results and the analytical model. The results obtained show the potential of these composites in applications for increasing the thermal performance of concrete floors, in particular the thermal delay and thermal resistance. The {{results show that the}} contribution of the insulating lightweight screed material's properties to thermal delay is more relevant in systems composed of few layers.

The statistical analysis was performed using SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Sciences), based on 85 mortar mixes produced in the laboratory and on their values of thermal conductivity and compressive strength obtained using tests in small-scale samples. The results showed that aerial lime assumes the main role in improving the thermal conductivity of the mortars. Aerogel type, fly ash, expanded perlite and air entrainers are also relevant components for a good thermal conductivity.

40|$|By {{intensive}} stratification of our society, {{designers and}} contractors {{are faced with}} a variety of requirements and problems which they have never had encountered in their practice before. The complexity of the problem, but primarily inexperience, results with omissions and errors in designing and construction works. When those errors occur in residential buildings, not only that they reduce building's service life, but also, to a considerable extent, reduce living comfort and quality of life of its residents. This paper presents a solution to the problem, due to failure during installation of mechanical equipment in residential-office building, in Sremska Street in Novi Sad. The failure occurred on the pool water pump located {{on the top of the}} building. The pool is an integral part of an apartment. The omission is reflected in rigid connection between the pump and the reinforced-concrete slab of the floor structure, but also in rigid pipes passage through reinforced-concrete elements, which led to the noise level that was significantly above the allowed values at a given building. The problem was repaired by implementing appropriate elastic connection between the water pump and the concrete bedding, which is achieved by using shims, that are a mixture of neoprene rubber and cork. The mechanical room is sound insulated by mounting panels of <b>expanded</b> <b>cork</b> and profiled sponge on the walls and doors of the room. Implementing these procedures reduced noise caused by the work of water pump and related equipment to the acceptable level...|$|E
40|$|The {{increased}} {{need to save}} {{material and}} energetic resources, allied with a growing concern on the environmental issues and incertitude {{on the evolution of}} the economy, has impelled minimalist-approaches to Architecture and Engineering, reducing to the minimum necessary expression the building elements. The development of new lightweight materials, most of them composites with fibrous reinforcement systems, has interest for building materials and textile industries. However, these materials still do not have a significant implementation in the building industry or, at least, this implementation is not being made exploring all their potentialities. Non load bearing interior partition walls are thin elements built to divide the indoor space into rooms or other compartments. Porous materials applied in interior partition walls have a significant importance in these building elements because sound insulation is an important requirement. Walls must provide an airborne sound barrier between rooms in a same dwelling and especially between different dwellings, this last issue as a compulsory requirement to fulfil in Portuguese regulations. In the present study it will be considered a lightweight interior partition wall composed by insulation material and layered within two membranes. The process of selecting materials for that interior partition wall is a challenging task. This paper intends to compare results of functional (acoustic and thermal) performance of materials such as expandable polystyrene (EPS), polyurethane foam (PU), Ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA), 3 D warp knitted polyester fabrics (3 DWK), Cork (CK), <b>Expanded</b> <b>Cork</b> (CKE), Rockwool (RW), coconut fibber (CCF), silicone (SI), waste fiber (WF), to discuss about their potentialities as insulation or membrane materials applied in interior dividing walls technologies. It also presents a morphological characterization of materials, through microscopic analysis, in order to define the relationship between the morphology and acoustic performance. The results of tests are compared with reference values of rock wool as insulation material - conventionally used in lightweight dividing walls made of plasterboard leaves and light gauge steel framing structure. One of the results of this paper is that a lightweight and thin interior partition wall filled with insulation material present acoustic advantages when compared with a heavyweight interior partition wall with more thickness. The concept of membrane goes back to the Latin word “membrana”, meaning parchment or skin. In previous studies it could be verified that low density makes membrane structures poor thermal and acoustic insulators. However, it is available in the market heavily coated or microperforated membranes that have dampening effect A low density generally also implies a high porosity or a high volume of voids, which leads to a decrease in the thermal conductivity. In previous studies from the same authors, it was concluded that the presence of air gap between insulation materials in a lightweight interior partition can increase the acoustic insulation between 2 to 5 dB, the inclusion of porous materials in the air gap can contribute between 1 to 4 dB in thicknesses till 10 cm. The compromise between thermal and acoustic performance should also be attended. However thermal performance is only a requirement for interior partition walls between useful and non useful areas in housing buildings. In this study it will be presented results for different densities of insulation material. In the process of airborne sound transmission between two spaces, should be distinguished: a) direct transmission, that occurs directly through the separation element; or b) marginal transmission - that occurs through other building elements interlocked to the element of separation in study. The direct transmission can occur through joints, cracks or discontinuance of the construction element or through the construction element vibration. The heat transfer coefficient calculation tests were conducted according UNE EN 6946. The sound insulation estimation between locals was conducted according to EN 12354 - 1. Procedures for measuring the reverberation of a room, the absorption of the covering layers, as well as the sound absorption coefficients of a specimen of sound absorptive material were made according to ASTM C – 423...|$|E

Since this application is relatively recent, only about ten years old, there is still much to learn about the reliability of its long-term properties. In this context, this study aims to deepen and approach aspects, some of them poorly studied and even unknown, that deal with characteristics that will make the agglomerate a good choice for exterior wall covering.

The exact length of time that a wine is at risk of exposure to high temperatures will vary depending on the wine, with some wines (such as Madeira which is exposed to high temperatures during its winemaking) being able to sustain exposure to high temperatures more easily than other, more delicate wines (such as Riesling). If the wine is exposed to temperatures that are too cold, the wine can freeze and <b>expand,</b> causing the <b>cork</b> to be pushed out or (more usually) the bottle to crack; this will allow more oxygen to be exposed to the wine. Dramatic temperature swings (such as repeated transferring a wine from a warm room to a cool refrigerator) can also cause adverse chemical reactions in the wine that may lead to a variety of wine faults. Most experts, such as Jancis Robinson, recommend that wine be kept at constant temperatures between 50 and 59°F (10 and 15°C).
