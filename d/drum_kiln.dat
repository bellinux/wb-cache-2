40|$|Bibliography: leaves 94 - 96. Domestic grade {{charcoal}} with a {{fixed carbon}} content {{of at least}} 80 was successfully produced from the alien species Acacia Saligna. Carbonisation was effected using a Tongan <b>drum</b> <b>kiln</b> and average yields on a dry basis of 19. 1 (excluding fines production) were attained. With fines included, the yield increased to 31. 4. It was shown that the earnings of woodcutters could increase by about 25 if they opted for charcoal production using this technology. Three kilns examined in the Western Cape {{proved to be more}} financially viable than the Tongan <b>drum</b> <b>kiln.</b> The Tongan kiln was however shown to have advantages over other technologies in charcoal production from invasive alien vegetation by unskilled labour...|$|E
40|$|In Haiti, most {{families}} have traditionally relied on wood and wood-derived charcoal {{as their primary}} fuel source for indoor cooking. This resource {{has proven to be}} unsustainable, however, as over 90 % of the Haitian countryside has already been deforested and wood is now in low supply. As a poor country, importing fuel is not a viable option and thus, the ability to utilize renewable energy sources is critical. The work of the Edgerton Development Lab, under the guidance of Amy Smith, has developed a process utilizing an oil <b>drum</b> <b>kiln</b> to convert readily available agricultural waste from sugarcane, known as bagasse, into clean burning charcoal briquettes. In order to improve the efficiency of the existing oil <b>drum</b> <b>kiln,</b> this research will explore the design of a brick kiln that is relevant for the social dynamic of developing countries, inexpensive to manufacture and simple to operate. By defining the best system applicable to the Haitian context, this research will enable the efficient production of charcoal. This research will also define the shape of the chamber and the steps involved in the conversion process, enabling Haitians to make use of their natural resources to address a critical energy need. In addition, the enhanced energy efficiency will reduce the production time of the charcoal briquettes. Lastly, this research will explore how this technology can be best integrated into the existing culture and lifestyle of the Haitian community and propose a strategy for community participation. by Etienne Clement Toussaint.

50|$|Crystal malts, or caramel malts are {{prepared}} separately from pale malts. They are high-nitrogen malts that are wetted and roasted in a rotating <b>drum</b> before <b>kilning.</b> They produce strongly sweet toffee-like flavors and are sufficiently converted {{that they can}} be steeped without mashing to extract their flavor. Crystal malts are available in a range of colors, with darker-colored crystal malts kilned at higher temperatures producing stronger, more caramel-like overtones. Some of the sugars in crystal malts caramelize during kilning and become unfermentable. Hence, adding crystal malt increases the final sweetness of a beer. They contain no enzymes. ASBC 50-165/EBC 90-320; the typical British crystal malt used in pale ale and bitter is around ASBC 70-80.|$|R

40|$|The {{feasibility}} of charcoal production from cotton stalks in Malawi was studied {{based on experience}} from Sudan. The country relies considerably on biomass fuels. Of the total energy consumption in Malawi of 2. 376 MTOE in 1989, 92 % was met by biomass (fuelwood: 83. 6 % and charcoal: 8. 3 % Petroleum fuels and ethanol contributed 5. 4 %; electricity, 1. 6 %; and coal, 1. 0 %. Most of the energy (84. 8 %) was consumed in the household sector. The “Malawi Charcoal Project”, which is the main charcoal project {{carried out in the}} country, attempted to produce alternative softwood charcoal from the large resource of pine plantations but was not successful because of unacceptability of the product for household use, long transport distances and costs, and the equipment required for industrial uses. Briquetting of uncarbonized sawdust was also carried out by the Wood Industries Corporation (WICO), but failed due to unacceptability of the products and technical problems. The estimated total national demand for cotton stalk charcoal (CSC) briquettes is 15, 000 t yr− 1 made up of 7000 and 8000 t yr− 1 for household and industrial sectors, respectively. The household demand is most substantial in Blantyre (3500 t yr− 1) and Lilongwe (2700). t yr− 1 Ngabu town was found to be the most appropriate location for a plant to supply the Blantyre market. Of the many plant options that were found financially and economically viable, four, using <b>drum</b> <b>kilns</b> for carbonization, were the most attractive. These were the 800 t yr− 1 agglomeration process with seasonal sun drying operation, 2 - and 3 -shifts, and the 3000 t yr− 1 roll process, year round operation, 2 - and 3 -shifts with financial internal rates of return of 28. 1 %, 38. 3 %, 26. 6 % and 40. 0 % respectively and a pay-back period of three years.

In this study, a pot experiment was conducted to compare the efficiency of pelleted broiler litter biochar (PBLB) derived from a lab-scale pyrolysis reactor (PBLBL) with that resulted from 200 -liter-oil <b>drum</b> <b>kiln</b> (PBLBO). The biochar generated from each reactor was applied to the pot that contained lower organics materials, sandy soil, and grown soybeans cv. Chiangmai- 60 (Glycine max [L. ] Merr.) at the application rates of 5. 00, 10. 0, 15. 0, and 20. 0 t ha- 1. The results showed that both types of pyrolysis reactors (PBLBL and PBLBO), at every application rate, significantly improved the physicochemical properties of soil and increased the growth and yield of soybean; their comparison with a control treatment of soybeans is p < 0. 05. At the application rate of 15. 0 t ha- 1 the PBLBL showed the highest soybean yield. The application of PBLBL and PBLBO significantly led to increased pH, soil organic matter, C:N ration, N, P, K, Ca, Mg and CEC. ...|$|E

40|$|Papers {{presented}} to the 11 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, South Africa, 20 - 23 July 2015. In Zambia wood fuel, as a forest resource currently accounts for 80 % of the country’s total energy consumption at household level. About 60. 9 % of households use firewood for cooking and 24. 3 % use charcoal while only 13. 8 % use electricity. Further in rural areas, 87. 7 % use wood for cooking, 9. 5 % use charcoal and only 1. 5 % used electricity. Traditional earth charcoal kilns are the dominant method used in charcoal production, they incur minimal construction costs for rural communities, but have low conversion efficiencies, ranging from 6 to 12 %. This causes high annual rate of deforestation due to wood harvesting. For every ton of charcoal produced using traditional kiln depletes 0. 1 hectares of woodlands. Zambia has 300 000 hectares per annum rate of deforestation that is increasing at rate of 4 % per annum. This research was about determining the effect of moisture content and log diameter on the conversion efficiency of drum type charcoal making kilns by comparative studies in the field. The <b>drum</b> <b>kiln</b> is intended for use at the household level in periurban and rural areas. The log diameters used in the experimentation ranged from 0. 04 m to 0. 16 m on an average scale. The moisture content of the wood was determined by oven dry method (ASTM-D- 4442) which yielded moisture content ranges of 26. 92 wt. %, 9. 42 wt. %, 8. 63 wt. % and 9. 06 wt. % respectively. am 201...|$|E
40|$|Briquetted {{charcoal}} was experimentally manufactured {{using the}} mixture of sawdust and woody slab wastes as the main materials. At first, sawdust wastes were carbonized in a semi-continuous kiln into the sawdust charcoal. Meanwhile, carbonized on woody slab wastes was conducted in a <b>drum</b> <b>kiln</b> yielding the slab charcoal. Further, the resulting sawdust charcoal and slab charcoal were mixed in varying respective portion, i. e. consecutively : (80 % and 20 %; 60 % and 40 %; 50 % and 50 %; 40 % and 60 %). The mixture was subsequently added with tapioca flour as binding agent at 5 percent, then molded, and compressed under 30 -ton hydraulic pressure into the briquetted charcoal. In addition, the briquetted charcoal was also correspondingly prepared from I 00 percent sawdust, and regarded as with 0 -percent woody slabs (i. e. 100 % and 0 %). Such mixture in varying portions was further asserted as treatment. The resulting briquette charcoal was subsequently examined of its {{physical and chemical properties}}, i. e. moisture content, ash content, volatile matter, fixed carbon, density, compressive strenght, and caloric values. The result revealed that the recovery/yield sawdust charcoal was about 24. 57 - 29. 16 percent, while that of slab charcoal was 25. 26 - 39. 20 percent. Further, {{the mixture of}} sawdust charcoal and slabs charcoal at 40 % : 60 % portion brounght out the briquetted charcoal with the most satisfactory physical and chemical properties i. e. the moisture content of the briquette charcoal was in the range of 2. 50 - 4. 12 percent, ash content 13. 22 - 21. 41 percent, volatile matter 20. 22 - 21. 94 percent, fixed carbon content 56. 65 - 66. 36 percent, density 0. 412 - 0. 487 gram per cm 3, compressive strenght 16. 43 - 38. 13 kg per cm 2, and caloric value 4515 - 5834 cal per gram...|$|E
40|$|Charcoal {{has long}} been known by the {{community}} in its use either as energy sources or for agriculture/forestry-related aspects.   Beginning from the discovery of the so-called Terra Preta, the role of charcoal in improving soil fertility and enhancing its productivity at agriculture as well as forestry lands has attracted remarkable attention internationally ever since.   Raw material for charcoal can be wood or other ligno-cellulosic stuffs (e. g. coconut shells, oil-palm shells, rice husks, wood sawdust, nut shells, etc).   Technology in charcoal manufacture commonly employed by the community comprises heaping-kiln, <b>drum</b> <b>kiln,</b> and dome-shaped kiln systems.   Such manufacture technology is simply carbonizing the ligno-cellulosic stuffs inside the kiln into charcoal.   The charcoal yield usually ranges about 20 - 25 % (w/w), implying that as much 75 - 80 % of the stuffs is lost as smoke that further escape to the air.   Environment concerns arise since such escaped smoke can pollute the atmosphere and hence contribute to the global warming.   Measures are urgently needed {{to reduce the amount of}} such escapes among others, as developed by the Center for Research and Development on Forestry Engineering and Forest Products Processing (CRDFEFPP, Indonesia) by cooling the smoke, during the carbonization of ligno-cellulosic stuffs, thereby condensing it into liquid smoke (popularly called as wood vinegar). Through intensive and tedious researches, it is found out that the wood vinegar (as charcoal by-product) could effectively function as bio-pesticides and bio-fertilizers.   Meanwhile, application of charcoal to the seedlings of forestry plant species reveals positive responses as shown by the increase in biomass weight of those plants on other positive plant-growth aspects (e. g. stem height and diameter).   Likewise, the use of charcoal combined with compost (i. e. organic fertilizer that results from bio-conversion of biomass stuffs) could enhance as much 2 - 3 times the production of vegetables plants as the control (untreated plants).   This in all strongly indicates the charcoal and wood-vinegar manufacture entirely called as essentially the bio-char technology, can convert biomass stuffs (previously regarded as not or less useful) into value-added or more useful products (charcoal and wood vinegar) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to investigate the effect of kiln type (traditional, metal and drum) and billet size on the properties/quality of charcoal produced from Acacia seyal var. seyal wood: Sixty seven trees growing in Wadel Khisheid Reserved Forest (Hawata Forest Circle, Gedaref State) were randomly chosen, felled and cross-cut into 1 -m or 0. 8 m long billets. The billets were divided into three diameter categories, namely, large (≥ 18 cm), medium (9 - 17. 9 cm) and small (2. 5 - 8. 9 cm). After drying for four weeks, samples of each billet size were carbonized using a metal, traditional earth mound or oil <b>drum</b> <b>kiln.</b> Three samples of charcoal, representing each billet size and kiln type, were randomly chosen to determine moisture content, volatile matter, fixed carbon and ash content, charcoal density, ignition and burning time, percentage of burned and unburned charcoal, calorific value and water boiling time. No {{significant differences were found between}} kiln types in air dry density and unburned charcoal. Also, there were no significant differences between billet sizes in moisture content, oven dry density, ignition time, burning time and unburned charcoal. Charcoal from traditional kiln had the highest fixed carbon content, the longest burning time and relatively high calorific value with significant differences from iv other types. It had the lowest volatile content. The metal kiln had the highest volatile content. In the metal kiln, there were significant differences between the three billet sizes in volatile content and fixed carbon. There were also significant differences between the large billets and the other two sizes in the ash content and between the large and medium billets in air-dry density. In the traditional kiln, there were significant differences between the billet sizes in volatile content and ash content. Significant differences were also found between the large and other two sizes in fixed carbon, green density and basic density, and the large and the small size billets in the percentage of burned charcoal. In the traditional kiln, the small billets had significantly higher percentage of burned charcoal than large billets...|$|E
