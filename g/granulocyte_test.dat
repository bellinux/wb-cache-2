40|$|A formal quality {{assurance}} (QA) scheme {{has been established}} to facilitate proficiency <b>testing</b> for <b>granulocyte</b> antibodies and antigens. Fifteen laboratories participated in the Fourth International Granulocyte Immunology Workshop. The main objective of the workshop was to establish a formal QA scheme for granulocyte serology and molecular typing methods. A secondary objective {{was to determine the}} relative sensitivities of the <b>granulocyte</b> immunofluorescence <b>test,</b> <b>granulocyte</b> agglutination <b>test,</b> and MoAb immobilization assays using defined antisera and protocols. Laboratories scored between 16. 7 and 100 percent (mean, 57. 5 %) of the maximum available in the serologic part of this QA exercise. There were particular problems in detecting granulocyte-specific human neutrophil antigen- 1 (HNA- 1 a) IgM antibodies and HNA- 2 a antibodies in the presence of HNA- 1 b antibodies. The <b>granulocyte</b> immunofluorescence <b>test</b> was more sensitive than the <b>granulocyte</b> agglutination <b>test</b> in titration studies, but the latter method more readily identified the presence of HNA- 3 a antibodies. HNA genotyping was generally well performed, with nine laboratories obtaining 100 -percent correct results for HNA- 1 a, HNA- 1 b, and HNA- 1 c. There is a need to standardize the detection of granulocyte-specific antibodies. Laboratories with good performance tended to use two methods for detecting granulocyte-specific antibodies and an HNA-typed panel of granulocytes. The use of a method for elucidating mixtures of granulocyte- and lymphocyte-reactive antibodies (e. g., MoAb immobilization assay) and the use of methods for detecting both cytotoxic and noncytotoxic HLA class I antibodies were also associated with a higher than average performanc...|$|R

40|$|Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) is {{a severe}} {{complication}} related with blood transfusion. TRALI has usually {{been associated with}} antibodies against leukocytes. The flow cytometric <b>granulocyte</b> immunofluorescence <b>test</b> (Flow-GIFT) has been introduced for routine use when investigating patients and healthy blood donors. Here we describe a novel tool in the automation of the Flow-GIFT that enables a rapid screening of blood donations. We analyzed 440 sera from healthy female blood donors {{for the presence of}} granulocyte antibodies. As positive controls, 12 sera with known antibodies against anti-HNA- 1 a, -b, - 2 a; and - 3 a were additionally investigated. Whole-blood samples from HNA-typed donors were collected and the test cells isolated using cell sedimentation in a Ficoll density gradient. Subsequently, leukocytes were incubated with the respective serum and binding of antibodies was detected using FITC-conjugated antihuman antibody. 7 -AAD was used to exclude dead cells. Pipetting steps were automated using the Biomek NXp Multichannel Automation Workstation. All samples were prepared in the 96 -deep well plates and analyzed by flow cytometry. The standard <b>granulocyte</b> immunofluorescence <b>test</b> (GIFT) and <b>granulocyte</b> agglutination <b>test</b> (GAT) were also performed as reference methods. Sixteen sera were positive in the automated Flow-GIFT, while five of these sera were negative in the standard GIFT (anti—HNA 3 a, n = 3; anti—HNA- 1 b, n = 1) and GAT (anti—HNA- 2 a, n = 1). The automated Flow-GIFT was able to detect all granulocyte antibodies, which could be only detected in GIFT in combination with GAT. In serial dilution tests, the automated Flow-GIFT detected the antibodies at higher dilutions than the reference methods GIFT and GAT. The Flow-GIFT proved to be feasible for automation. This novel high-throughput system allows an effective antigranulocyte antibody detection in a large donor population in order to prevent TRALI due to transfusion of blood products...|$|R
40|$|Using a microdroplet <b>granulocyte</b> {{cytotoxicity}} <b>test,</b> 522 {{patients were}} examined {{for the presence}} of granulocytotoxins. Numerous antibodies against granulocytes were found in sera from multitransfused patients, patients with kidney disease undergoing hemodialysis, kidney transplant recipients and pregnant women. Granulocyte cytotoxic activity in sera from these patients appeared to be clearly different from HLA lymphocyte activity. Further, the specificities of granulocyte agglutinating antibodies, appearing {{as a result of the}} <b>granulocyte</b> agglutination <b>test</b> using pure <b>granulocyte</b> suspension, were completely different from that of granulocytotoxins and anti-HLA antibodies. It is likely that granulocyte cytotoxins and granulocyte agglutinins will be useful in transfusion and bone marrow transplantation as a separate tool from the more widely used lymphocyte cytotoxicity reaction. With the use of <b>granulocyte</b> cytotoxicity <b>tests,</b> 172 cadaveric kidney transplant recipients were also tested {{for the presence of}} granulocytotoxins before transplantation. A higher proportion of failure (75 %) was noted among patients with granulocytotoxins than among those without granulocytotoxins (57 %) (P < 0. 05). After transplantation, all 19 patients who had rejected their transplants had granulocytotoxins, whereas none of the 11 successful transplant patients had granulocytotoxins (P< 0. 025). These results suggest that the granulocyte antigens identified by granulocytotoxin may act as histocompatibility antigens in human transplantation. An attempt has been made to analyse the specificities of granulocyte cytotoxins. Fourteen granulocyte specificities have been identified by Mickey's Boolean regression programs. They have been assigned tentatively to three separate but linked loci. The fit to the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was satisfactory. From family studies, the specificities were clearly dominant inherited characteristics. By absorption and cross-correlation tests, these specificities were also proven to be distinct from HLA specificities regardless of whether a genetic linkage with HLA exists has been established...|$|R

40|$|TRALI {{events are}} {{clinically}} diagnosed and laboratory investigations act {{to support the}} diagnosis. The two event or priming TRALI hypothesis proposes that the patient’s underlying illness induces activation of the pulmonary endothelium leading to the sequestration of primed neutrophils. Leukocyte antibodies or biological response modifiers (BRMs) in the transfused blood product activate the primed neutrophil producing an augmented respiratory burst response which causes injury to the microvasculature, resulting in the symptoms of ALI 1. Hence neutrophils are a key effector cell in this pathology 2. Current laboratory investigations are predominantly focussed on the antibody mediated TRALI. Both human neutrophil antigens (HNA) and human leukocyte antigens (HLA) have been associated and implicated in TRALI events. The combination of the <b>granulocyte</b> immunofluorescence <b>tests</b> (GIFT) and <b>granulocyte</b> agglutination <b>test</b> (GAT) have been recommended for the screening and detection of neutrophil reactive antibodies (i. e. HNA and HLA class I antibodies) 3. HLA class II antibodies also have been implicated in severe TRALI, but HLA assays are needed to detect them 4. Crossmatching of recipient neutrophils with donor sera by GIFT and GAT provide a useful means of confirming if an antibody is implicated. Otherwise only an association can be assumed. Although tedious and often protracted the laboratory investigation of TRALI events is needed so that blood donors with “risky” antibodies can be identified and removed from therapeutic use. There is not accepted method for investigating non-antibody mediated TRALI. The Granulocyte Immunobiology Working Party of the International Society of Blood Transfusion (ISBT) is a collective of the world’s granulocyte experts.

40|$|A microdroplet <b>granulocyte</b> {{cytotoxicity}} <b>test</b> was developed, {{mainly in}} Dr. Terasaki's Laboratory, University of California Los Angeles, and partly in our laboratory, Sapporo Medical College in Hokkaido, to identify new antigens which {{belong to a}} different histocompatibility antigen system from the well-known system composed of FILA antigens of human lymphocytes. The following three important problems {{should be considered in}} order to obtain reproducible satisfactory results by this test : 1) Pure granulocyte sample with a limited contamination of other types of cells must be used for the test, 2) Adherence of granulocytes to the surface of plate should be avoided throughout the period of test, because the adhered cells are taken for the dead cells by their dark appearance under a phase contrast microscope even though they are alive and healthy, and 3) Non-specific granulocyte cytotoxic activity contained in unabsorbed rabbit complement, which has been usually used for the routine lymphocyte cytotoxicity test, should be suppressed in this test, because of the demand for an accurate detection of specific cytotoxic reactivity of antiserum. For the first problem the method of separation of granulocytes by centrifugation in Ficoll-Conray solution was employed and agglutination with the appropriate hemagglutinin was carried out before centrifugation to get rid of erythrocytes contamination. The lymphocyte contaminations in the granu-locyte preparations obtained by our method could be restricted within 5 %. The second and third problems were solved by the pretreatment of granulocytes with iodoacetamide at the concentration of 0. 005 - 0. 02 % to keep the cells free from sticking to the plate, and by using rabbit complement absorbed by human erythrocytes, as a complement source for the inhibition of non-specific cytotoxic activity to granulocytes, respectively. From the advantages of the simplicity of techniques and the need of very small amount of typing sera, the newly developed microdroplet <b>granulocyte</b> cytotoxicity <b>test</b> can be added to the microdroplet lymphocyte cytotoxicity test of HLA antigen-antibody system for the purpose of more precise test of histocompatibility and many other purposes of investigation in various clinical fields...|$|R
40|$|Background  From 2005 to 2009 transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) has {{maintained}} its ranking {{as the number}} one cause of transfusion-related fatalities reported to the FDA. This confirms that TRALI remains a serious and potentially fatal transfusion complication. As over 80 % of TRALI events {{have been attributed to}} donor derived leucocyte antibodies the detection and management of donors with these antibodies is crucial to reducing the TRALI risk. Objective  Because blood is a precious medical commodity in limited supply, it would be more effective to exclude only those donors with a risk of triggering TRALI substantiated by objective laboratory evidence (i. e. implicated). This would allow implicated donors to be confidently excluded and would allow other donors only clinically associated with TRALI to be reassessed for continuing to donate. Therefore, the design of an effective and objective TRALI laboratory investigation strategy has to be based on current knowledge of the mechanism of antibody mediated TRALI. Discussion  Leucocyte antibodies in the transfused blood product are thought to activate neutrophils in the pulmonary microvasculature. The by-products of neutrophil activation (e. g. reactive oxygen species and enzymes) consequently cause injury to the pulmonary microvasculature resulting in respiratory distress. There is strong evidence for the role of neutrophil reactive antibodies to human neutrophil antigen (HNA) - 3 a and human leucocyte antigen (HLA) -A 2 in serious TRALI events. HLA Class II antibodies have also been implicated and they are thought to activate monocytes, which subsequently activate neutrophils. Neutrophils, which express human neutrophil antigens (HNA) and HLA Class I, are thus key effector cells in TRALI injury. Because of the pivotal role of neutrophils, effective TRALI investigations must include well validated neutrophil assays such as the <b>granulocyte</b> immunofluorescence <b>test</b> (GIFT) and <b>granulocyte</b> agglutination <b>test</b> (GAT). This article will discuss:– TRALI investigation strategy, – assays for detection of antibodies to HNA and HLA,– how to differentiate associated from implicated donors,– and provide thoughts on the remaining 20 % of TRALI events (i. e. non-immune mediated) ...|$|R

40|$|Background Published {{case reports}} of transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) {{indicate}} that antibodies (Abs) to HNA- 3 a {{have been associated}} with TRALI fatalities. In contrast there have been no reported fatalities in TRALI cases with Abs to HNA- 1 a and HNA- 2 a. Serological characteristics of each of these Abs may therefore be important in determining whether the reaction is mild or severe. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the serologicalcharacteristics of five anti-HNA- 2 a sera. Three sera were implicated in TRALI events and two were from alloimmune-neonatal neutropenia (ANN) cases. Method: An Ab titer was established against neutrophils (PMNs) with high HNA- 2 a expression (> 70 %) using both the <b>granulocyte</b> immunofluorescence <b>test</b> (GIFT) and <b>granulocyte</b> agglutination <b>test</b> (GAT). Two clones of CD 177 (7 D 8 and MEM- 166) were applied in the monoclonal antibody immobilization of granulocyte antigens assay (MAIGA). These same monoclonal antibodies (Mab) were used in blocking studies for epitope mapping, against PMNs from two individuals determined to have high (> 70 %) and two individuals with moderate (30 - 70 %) HNA- 2 a expression. Results: Only 2 / 3 of TRALI associated sera and 1 / 2 of ANN sera were MAIGA positive (i. e. captured by the CD 177 clones). The MAIGA negative sera (TW and AB) had higher titers. PMNs pre-treated with both MAIGA negative sera reduced subsequent 7 D 8 binding but only partially reduced MEM- 166 binding. This suggests that the Abs in these two sera were directed to a site closer to the 7 D 8 epitope. Although sera TQ, TS and AS were captured by both MAb, pre-treament with TS did not block subsequent MAb binding. And TQ and AS only demonstrated partial blocking. PMNs pre-treated with these MAbs did not reduce subsequent binding of Abs from all 5 sera (data not shown). These data indicate that the Abs in the sera bound to HNA- 2 a at more epitopes than the two tested. Conclusions: These data did not identify any characteristic that differentiated ANN from TRALI implicated Abs. They revealed differences in GIFT and GAT titers, and significant serological and epitope preference variability. These serological differences in characteristics may influence the severity of antibody mediated events such as TRALI. These observations justify further studies to characterize Abs implicated in TRALI events, such as Ab titers, isotype, subtypes and epitope reactivity...|$|R
40|$|Six related cysteine-rich, low-molecular-weight {{peptides}} were purified from rabbit peritoneal <b>granulocytes</b> and <b>tested</b> {{in vitro}} for fungicidal activity against Candida albicans. Two peptides (NP- 1 and NP- 2) were highly effective, one (NP- 3 a) was moderately active, and three (NP- 3 b greater than NP- 4 {{much greater than}} NP- 5) had substantially less potency. There was a general, but imperfect, correlation between the candidacidal potency of each peptide and its net cationic charge. Candidacidal activity by NP- 1 was concentration and time dependent and occurred rapidly under optimal low-ionic-strength conditions. It was inhibited by increasing either the ionic strength or Ca 2 + concentration of the incubation mixtures, but was relatively unaffected by Mg 2 +. Candidacidal activity was independent of H+ concentrations between pH 5 and 8, but decreased below pH 5. Candidacidal activity was temperature sensitive and was virtually abolished when NP- 1 was incubated with C. albicans at 0 degrees C.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Primary {{autoimmune}} neutropenia (AIN) {{in children}} {{is characterized by}} severe neutropenia, but mild bacterial infections and a spontaneous resolution. Neutrophil autoantibodies {{are involved in the}} disease. The precise relationship between the specificity and level of reactivity of the antibodies with the absolute neutrophil count and frequency of infections is not known. To obtain a better insight into this relationship, we performed a follow-up study in 15 patients with primary AIN. In addition, we performed two different neutrophil antibody tests to evaluate their sensitivity and specificity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Blood samples from 15 children were tested for neutrophil antibodies, at different time-points during the disease, by using the indirect <b>granulocyte</b> immunofluorescence <b>test</b> (GIFT) and the monoclonal antibody-specific immobilization of granulocyte antigens (MAIGA) assay. Clinical data related to the occurrence of bacterial infections and treatment, and neutrophil counts were collected. RESULTS: Early in the disease, antibodies with pan-FcRIIIb specificity were detected, and HNA- 1 a or HNA- 1 b specificity of the antibodies developed over time. The sensitivity and specificity of neutrophil antibody detection tests were higher in the GIFT than in the MAIGA assay. Variables predicting time of recovery from neutropenia were not found.

Patients were classified as AIN or nonautoimmune causes. Baseline demographic data, results of BMIFT, <b>granulocyte</b> immunofluorescence <b>testing</b> and bone marrow findings were collected from clinical records and the institutional laboratory database. Seventy-six children had BMIFT performed for investigation of neutropenia. There were 45 patients diagnosed with AIN, 28 with nonimmune neutropenia and three failed tests. The median age of children with AIN was 1. 2 years (range 0. 3 - 15. 3), compared with 3. 6 years (range 0. 1 - 15. 7) in the nonautoimmune group. The median neutrophil count in AIN was 0. 3 x 10 (9) /l (0. 9 x 10 (9) /l in nonautoimmune). BMIFT was positive in 24 of 45 patients with AIN and 0 of 28 with nonautoimmune neutropenia (sensitivity 53 %, specificity 100 %, positive predictive value (PPV) 100 %, negative predictive value 57 %).

40|$|Background  The {{neutrophil}} population {{makes up}} the largest proportion (40 – 70 %) of white blood cells and is crucial to our innate immune response. An unexpectedly significant proportion of neutrophils (∼ 28 %) {{is located in the}} pulmonary circulation. This is an immune system front line wherein neutrophils guard an important interface between the external environment and the body. Neutrophils migrate to sites of infection and/or inflammation, where they phagocytose and destroy foreign microorganisms and mediate inflammation and eventual healing. Therefore, a decrease in neutrophil numbers often results in increased susceptibility to infection. Sustained or transient immune neutropenia occurs when neutrophil-reactive alloantibodies or autoantibodies destroy neutrophils, or significantly compromise their function. Neutrophil-reactive antibodies are capable of activating the neutrophil’s microbicidal arsenal with resultant damage to the surrounding tissue. Antigens and Antibodies  There are currently eight well characterized human neutrophil antigens (HNA) : HNA- 1 a, HNA- 1 b, HNA- 1 c, HNA- 2 a, HNA- 3 a, HNA- 3 b, HNA- 4 a and HNA- 5 a. Only HNA- 1 a, HNA- 1 b and HNA- 1 c are specific to neutrophils, whilst the others are also expressed on other cell types. It {{is important to remember that}} neutrophils also express HLA Class I antigens, and that there is some evidence that adequately activated neutrophils may express HLA Class II antigens. This provides an interface between the innate and adaptive immune response. Therefore, both HNA and HLA Class I and II antibodies are capable of reacting with neutrophils in vivo and in vitro. Routine Antigen and Antibody Investigation  Antigen genotyping protocols are now available for HNA- 1 a, HNA- 1 b, HNA- 1 c, HNA- 3 a, HNA- 3 b, HNA- 4 a and HNA- 5 a. The serological examination of neutrophils is reliant on harvesting a representative, pure population of neutrophils, which is difficult because neutrophils are short lived (6 – 8 h) and fragile. The International Granulocyte Immunobiology Workshop recommends the use of both the <b>granulocyte</b> immunofluorescence <b>test</b> (GIFT) and <b>granulocyte</b> agglutination <b>test</b> (GAT), complemented by the monoclonal antibody immobilization of granulocyte antigen (MAIGA) assay. The GIFT uses paraformaldehyde-fixed neutrophils and detects the binding of antibodies to surface HNA and HLA antigens. Serological reaction in the GAT is reliant on viable neutrophils. It demonstrates the ability of antibodies to sensitize neutrophils and stimulate them to undergo chemotaxis towards other sensitized neutrophils, thus forming microscopic agglutinates. The MAIGA is useful in confirming antibody specificities as it employs monoclonal antibodies to known HNA epitopes. To screen for neutrophil-reactive antibodies, serum or plasma is exposed to a screening panel of neutrophils in the GIFT and GAT. To differentiate between HNA and HLA antibodies, the simple strategy of using platelet pools to absorb out HLA antibodies can be used. Specificity is determined using the GIFT and GAT, and a phenotyped and genotyped neutrophil panel and confirmed with the MAIGA. Application The combination of the GIFT, GAT and MAIGA was originally developed for the reliable investigation of immune neutropenias. However, in the last decade these techniques have become fundamental to the investigation of immune mediated TRALI where neutrophils are a key target and effector cell...|$|R
40|$|A {{time-lapse}} {{study of}} granulocyte cytotoxicity was performed with sera from 13 renal allograft recipients (living related donor; 10, cadaver donor; 3) using a droplet microgranulocytecytotoxicity test. Of eight {{patients who had}} previously received blood transfusions, two gave positive reactions for the <b>granulocyte</b> cross match <b>test</b> and developed acute rejection after renal transplantation. Of seven patients with rejection of a renal graft, four were positive for granulocyte cytotoxicity before and after operation. Five patients showed good results for renal graft and four of these were negative for granulocyte cytotoxicity {{both before and after}} operation. Some of the patients with good grafts gave repeated positive reactions for granulocyte cytotoxicity but later showed poor grafting. Results for granulocyte cytotoxicity which were negative early tended to become positive about 10 days before acute rejection. Granulocyte cytotoxicity did not correlate well with HLA-matching or white blood cell counts. Lymphocyte cytotoxicity examined simultaneously was negative in the sera of all 13 patients...|$|R
40|$|Neutropenia {{is common}} in {{patients}} with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) but mechanisms of cell depletion remain obscure. To investigate the possible autoimmune aetiology of neutropenia in SLE, sera from 31 patients with this disorder were tested for anti-granulocyte activity. Granulocyte-binding immunoglobulins were detected by indirect immunofluorescence, {{and the ability of}} patient sera to opsonize granulocytes was determined by measuring the chemiluminescent response of human monocytes to <b>granulocytes</b> sensitized by <b>test</b> sera. Sera from 22 of the 31 patients bound IgG to granulocyte cell membranes and/or to nuclei, but only membrane-binding antibodies opsonized the cells for recognition by monocytes. There was no correlation between neutrophil count and the level of granulocyte-binding IgG as measured by indirect immunofluorescence. In contrast, opsonic activity and neutrophil count were inversely correlated (r = 0. 5; P less than 0. 05). However, opsonic activity was present in sera from most non-neutropenic patients. In patients with SLE, impaired reticuloendothelial system function may allow sensitized granulocytes to remain in the circulation...|$|R
40|$|Leukotriene B 4 (LTB 4) {{was found}} to induce {{enhanced}} migration of the eosinophilic G 1 granulocyte of the dogfish Scyliorhinus canicula in the migration under agarose assay. Higher levels of LTB 4, however, were required to produce this effect than with mammalian neutrophils under similar conditions. It is postulated {{that this may be}} due to the dogfish granulocytes possessing fewer receptors for LTB 4 than their mammalian counterparts. The eosinophilic G 3 <b>granulocyte</b> was also <b>tested</b> using the same assay but results were inconclusive. The effect of LTB 4 on dogfish G 1 and G 3 granulocytes was also monitored with the bipolar shape formation (BSF) assay. LTB 4 induced BSF in both granulocyte types, and this method appeared to be more sensitive than the migration under agarose assay. Whether the enhanced migration observed is a result of chemotaxis or chemokinesis is not determined. This present study represents the first known report of the function of LTB 4 in a non-mammalian vertebrate...|$|R
40|$|Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) is {{the leading}} cause of transfusion- related mortality. To {{determine}} TRALI incidence by prospective, active surveillance and to identify risk factors by a case-control study, 2 academic medical centers enrolled 89 cases and 164 transfused controls. Recipient risk factors identified by multivariate analysis were higher IL- 8 levels, liver surgery, chronic alcohol abuse, shock, higher peak airway pressure while being mechanically ventilated, current smoking, and positive fluid balance. Transfusion risk factors were receipt of plasma or whole blood from female donors (odds ratio = 4. 5, 95 % confidence interval [CI], 1. 85 - 11. 2, P =. 001), volume of HLAclass II antibody with normalized background ratio more than 27. 5 (OR = 1. 92 / 100 mL, 95 % CI, 1. 08 - 3. 4, P =. 03), and volume of anti-human neutrophil antigen positive by <b>granulocyte</b> immunofluoresence <b>test</b> (OR = 1. 71 / 100 mL, 95 % CI, 1. 18 - 2. 5, P =. 004). Little or no risk was associated with older red blood cell units, noncognate or weak cognate class II antibody, or class I antibody. Reduced transfusion of plasma from female donors was concurrent with reduced TRALI incidence: 2. 57 (95 % CI, 1. 72 - 3. 86) in 2006 versus 0. 81 (95 % CI, 0. 44 - 1. 49) in 2009 per 10 000 transfused units (P =. 002).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Granulocyte {{transfusion}} {{has been}} proposed as a bridging therapy for patients with prolonged periods of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia, who suffer from severe fungal and bacterial infections. To recover, adequate numbers of granulocytes are required when the patients are refractory to standard treatment. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the functional characteristics and efficacy of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor/dexamethasone-mobilized granulocytes used for transfusions. DESIGN AND METHODS: Granulocytes from the leukapheresis products were tested for the expression of cell-surface antigens, interactions with endothelial cells, motility, killing of microbes and survival. The granulocytes were used in vivo for transfusion in 16 severely ill children, who were [...] apart from a patient with a granulocyte dysfunction [...] all suffering from prolonged neutropenia. RESULTS: Mobilization of granulocytes with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and dexamethasone caused phenotypic changes (decreased CD 62 L expression and increased levels of CD 66 b and CD 177). The ability of the granulocytes to interact with endothelial cells (rolling, adhesion, transmigration) and to kill various types of pathogens was not affected by the mobilization, leukapheresis and irradiation procedures. The granulocytes were functionally indistinguishable from those isolated from untreated donors, even after 24 hours of storage. Granulocyte transfusion seemed to benefit 70 % of patients, as 11 out of the 16 children showed clinical recovery within 1 - 2 weeks after beginning the transfusions. CONCLUSIONS: Although CD 62 L expression is downregulated on granulocytes used for granulocyte transfusions, concomitant CD 177 upregulation may explain the intact interactions with endothelial cells. All other <b>granulocyte</b> functions <b>tested</b> were intact, including the ability to kill fungi. Granulocyte concentrates can be stored without loss of in vitro viability and functionality for at least 24 hours. As demonstrated in vivo, granulocyte transfusions may be an effective therapy for neutropenic pediatric patients suffering from life-threatening infection...|$|R

Using the <b>granulocyte</b> immunofluorescence <b>test</b> by flow cytometry, the phenotypic frequencies of the human neutrophil alloantigens (HNA) - 1 a, - 1 b, - 2, - 3 a and - 4 a were determined in 100 healthy Brazilian persons. Neutrophils were separated from blood samples by sedimentation, centrifugated and incubated with HNA-specific alloantibody plus fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled F(ab') (2) fragments of anti-human IgG. {{the results showed that}} the phenotype frequencies of HNA- 1 a, - 1 b, - 2 a, - 3 a and - 4 a were 65 %, 83 %, 97 %, 95 % and 94 %, respectively. We detected that neutrophils from 17 % of Brazilians typed positive only with anti-HNA- 1 a (HNA- 1 a/a), 35 % only with anti-HNA- 1 b (HNA- 1 b/b) and 48 % reacted with both antibodies (HNA- 1 a/b). the frequencies found for HNA- 1 a and - 1 b were quite similar to that reported among Africans and American-Africans, but different from those found in Japanese and Chinese. in addition, our data showed that the frequencies of HNA- 2, - 3 a and - 4 a in Brazilians were comparable with those observed in Caucasians. the determination of HNAs frequencies among populations with distinct racial backgrounds is important not only for anthropological reasons, but also for neonatal typing in suspected cases of alloimmune neutropenia or when patients are severely neutropenic.

40|$|Background: Mesenchymal {{stem cells}} (MSCs) {{participate}} in the regulation of inflammation and innate immunity, for example by responding to pathogen-derived signals and by regulating the function of innate immune cells. MSCs from the bone-marrow and peripheral tissues share common basic cell-biological functions. However, it is unknown whether these MSCs exhibit different responses to microbial challenge and whether this response subsequently modulates the regulation of inflammatory cells by MSCs. Methodology/Principal Findings: We isolated MSCs from human bone-marrow (bmMSCs) and human salivary gland (pgMSCs). Expression levels of TLR 4 and LPS-responsive molecules were determined by flow cytometry and quantitative PCR. Cytokine release was determined by ELISA. The effect of supernatants from unstimulated and LPS-stimulated MSCs on recruitment, cytokine secretion, bacterial clearance and oxidative burst of polymorphonuclear neutrophil <b>granulocytes</b> (PMN) was <b>tested</b> in vitro. Despite minor quantitative differences, bmMSCs and pgMSCs showed a similar cell biological response to bacterial endotoxin. Both types of MSCs augmented anti-microbial functions of PMNs LPS stimulation, particularly of bmMSCs, further augmented MSC-mediated activation of PMN. Conclusions/Significance: This study suggests that MSCs {{may contribute to the}} resolution of infection and inflammation by promoting the anti-microbial activity of PMNs. This property is exerted by MSCs derived from both the bone-marrow an...|$|R
40|$|The {{basophil}} activation test (BAT) {{has become}} a pervasive test for allergic response {{through the development of}} flow cytometry, discovery of activation markers such as CD 63 and unique markers identifying basophil <b>granulocytes.</b> Basophil activation <b>test</b> measures basophil response to allergen cross-linking IgE on between 150 and 2000 basophil granulocytes in < 0. 1 ml fresh blood. Dichotomous activation is assessed as the fraction of reacting basophils. In addition to clinical history, skin prick test, and specific IgE determination, BAT can {{be a part of the}} diagnostic evaluation of patients with food-, insect venom-, and drug allergy and chronic urticaria. It may be helpful in determining the clinically relevant allergen. Basophil sensitivity may be used to monitor patients on allergen immunotherapy, anti-IgE treatment or in the natural resolution of allergy. Basophil activation test may use fewer resources and be more reproducible than challenge testing. As it is less stressful for the patient and avoids severe allergic reactions, BAT ought to precede challenge testing. An important next step is to standardize BAT and make it available in diagnostic laboratories. The nature of basophil activation as an ex vivo challenge makes it a multifaceted and promising tool for the allergist. In this EAACI task force position paper, we provide an overview of the practical and technical details as well as the clinical utility of BAT in diagnosis and management of allergic diseases...|$|R
40|$|In 32 {{patients}} with a renal allograft, serial determinations after transplantation were made of C 3 d, the stable conversion product of the complement factor C 3, as well as serial measurements of the anaphylatoxin C 3 a des arg. Furthermore, serial determinations were made {{on the presence of}} circulating immune complexes using three different assays (C 1 q binding assay, polyethylene glycol precipitation <b>test,</b> and indirect <b>granulocyte</b> phagocytosis <b>test).</b> Twenty patients were studied during an active cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, and 12 patients were studied during allograft rejection or during stable phase after renal transplantation. In 12 {{patients with}} a CMV infection serial measurements were made of AP 50 (alternative pathway of complement). During an active CMV infection elevated C 3 d as well as elevated C 3 a des arg levels were found and not in the control group (P < 0. 01). In 8 out of the 12 patients tested, with CMV infection, a decreased hemolytic activity of the alternative pathway (AP 50) was found, together with the elevated levels of C 3 d and C 3 a des arg. Serum C 4 levels were normal or high during CMV infection. Furthermore, circulating immune complexes were found to be positive in 15 out of the 20 {{patients with a}} CMV infection (both primary and secondary infections), and in 2 out of 12 patients of the control group. The complement activation found in the CMV group was not related to the presence of circulating immune complex-like material, since complement activation was present in advance of the appearance of the immune complexes, suggesting that complement activation was not due to classical pathway activation by those complexes. We conclude that our data are consistent with complement activation and the formation of biologically active peptides like C 3 a des arg in patients with an active CMV infection. The decreased hemolytic activity of the alternative pathway (AP 50) together with the normal or high C 4 levels suggest involvement of the alternative pathway, although further studies of the alternative pathway of C are warranted to confirm this hypothesis...|$|R
