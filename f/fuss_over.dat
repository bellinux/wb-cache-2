5|$|One spring, a {{relative}} of the Mistress brings her invalid toddler, Baby, to the Place {{in the hope that}} the weather will help her grow stronger. Lad immediately befriends the girl and becomes her constant companion. By summer, Baby is growing healthier, though she is still unable to walk. One afternoon, the mother sits the child near the lake, then leaves her to go meet the Master and Mistress, who are returning from town. Lad saves the baby from a copperhead snake, but the distraught mother only sees Lad throw her backwards and begins beating him. To protect her friend, Baby manages to shakily walk to her mother and explain what happened. While the humans <b>fuss</b> <b>over</b> the occurrence Lad sneaks off and spends four days buried in marsh mud to draw out the snake's poison.|$|E
25|$|The <b>fuss</b> <b>over</b> boys {{playing with}} hoops reached {{halfway around the}} globe. In the Colony of Tasmania, boys trundling hoops were blamed for {{endangering}} horsemen and rending ladies' dresses, and the Hobart paper called for their banishment to the suburbs, bye-laws, and police attention.|$|E

25|$|Registration 1 {{sold for}} £7.25million {{and is the}} highest price paid for a plate – in the United Arab Emirates. It was {{purchased}} by Abu Dhabi businessman Saeed Abdul Ghaffar Khouri in 2008. As of 2014, the registration 25O broke a new record of being the highest priced plate sold at a DVLA auction. Registration 25O was purchased for £518,000 by Ferrari dealer John Collins in 2014; the plate now sits pride of place on a Ferrari 250 SWB once owned by rock star Eric Clapton. Registration F1 and RAC3R have been considered as the most desirable plates amongst supercar and Formula One fanatics. The registration RAC3R is a suffix style plate that was issued {{in the same year}} British racing driver James Hunt won the Formula One World Championship in 1976. The plate covers an endless list of all the different forms of racing, making it extremely desirable. Since there has been a big <b>fuss</b> <b>over</b> race related plates the Driver & Vehicle Licensing Agency has made a racer game for motorists to celebrate the huge profits made from the sales of private plates. The celebration took place at the Goodwood Festival of Speed in 2010. Unlike horse racing, Formula One racing has become more popular in the last few years, hence why the F1 plate was always going to sell well. On 25 January 2008 the registration F1 sold for £440,000 to Bradford Car design entrepreneur Afzal Kahn. The plate was previously owned and sold by Essex County Council and was sold to raise money for training young drivers. Today the F1 plate has a valuation less than the winning bid with the price tag stagnating on that particular plate. Originally the plate was affixed in 1904 to the Panhard et Levassor of the then County Surveyor. Previously, a few months before the F1 plate was purchased, the S1 plate sold for £397,500 at an auction in September 2007 by an anonymous buyer making it the second most expensive number plate ever sold in the UK. The S1 plate was originally owned by Sir John H A MacDonald, the Lord Kingsburgh and was Edinburgh's first ever number plate. Within the space of two years the S1 plate sold for £65,500 more than the M1 plate that sold at auction in Goodwood on 7 July 2006. Registrations 1D VIP1 51NGH K1NGS and 1O are also marked as considerably expensive plates that have sold publicly in excess of six figures.|$|E

500|$|Commentators {{viewed the}} success of Rome as crucial for the network, {{especially}} after the past mixed reception of Carnivàle and K-Street. In July 2005, James Hibberd of Television Week wrote that Rome was viewed [...] "as the network's best shot for adding another literate, must-see drama to its schedule". Writing for the same publication, Tom Shales said that HBO [...] "has made such a <b>fuss</b> <b>over</b> Rome, and the network itself has put such painful pressure on the show (and its producers) to make a hefty impact, that it'll be scorned like a leper if it fails to make a truly gigantic splash." ...|$|E
500|$|In April and May that year, some European-Americans in Texas {{wrote to}} the editor of the Brazosport Facts {{questioning}} the <b>fuss</b> <b>over</b> her death; some were offended because Selena Day coincided with Easter Sunday. Others said, [...] "Easter is more important than Selena Day", and believed people should let Selena rest in peace and get on with their lives. Mexican-Americans living in Texas also {{wrote to the}} newspaper; some agreed that others were too critical of Selena Day, stating they did not need to celebrate the day and should not have responded to its announcement so rudely. This was also seen by the Corpus Christi Caller Times, which said it had printed several of the negative comments left by people and that many comments were [...] "unprintable". Latino filmmaker Lourdes Portillo said she did not know who Selena was when she heard about the shooting.|$|E
500|$|The Daily Telegraphs Gerard O'Donovan {{agreed that}} [...] "June Brown, as Dot, was mesmerising", but was {{similarly}} {{critical of the}} episode as a whole, concluding: [...] "Overall [...] the feeling couldn’t be avoided that in the greater scheme of things this was a <b>fuss</b> <b>over</b> nothing. Had it been a swan song, {{it would have been}} a worthy one. But doubtless Dot will be out and about again tonight, fag in hand, quoting from the Good Book. Enjoyable as this Albert Square indulgence was, I suspect that most fans will be hoping this one-hander remains a one-off." [...] Leigh Holmwood for The Guardian suggested that viewers may have agreed with O'Donovan's assessment, highlighting the fact that the episode received only 8.7million viewers, compared to 9.4million watching EastEnders the previous week. A 2003 episode centred around Dot also resulted in a notable ratings slump. The New Year episode, which detailed her childhood evacuation to the countryside, received just 8.1million viewers, compared with 12.2m the previous evening and 16m on Christmas Day. Prior to this, however, a 2002 two-hander episode featuring just Dot and Sonia Jackson (Natalie Cassidy) was watched by 11.5million viewers, with an almost 60% share of viewers in the timeslot.|$|E

500|$|When first {{built in}} 1869, Sri Temasek was the {{residence}} of the Colonial Secretary of the Straits Settlements (later Colonial Secretary/Chief Secretary of Singapore). All holders of the position had resided in Sri Temasek from 1869 to 1959. It is currently designated as the official residence of the Prime Minister of Singapore since 1959, though none {{of the past and}} present holders of the post, Lee Kuan Yew, Goh Chok Tong and Lee Hsien Loong, have lived in it as a family home. In the 1998 book Lee Kuan Yew: The Man and His Ideas, Lee Kuan Yew said that when he became Prime Minister in 1959 he and his wife Kwa Geok Choo decided not to move into Sri Temasek with their three children, who were then aged seven, five and two, because the couple [...] "did not want them to grow up in such grand surroundings with butlers and orderlies to <b>fuss</b> <b>over</b> their needs". The family did stay there in 1965 for a short time for security reasons when Singapore was expelled from Malaysia. Apart from that, according to a 2000 Straits Times interview with Kwa, the Lee children often played in the grounds of the house in the evening while their father played golf or made use of the practice tee and putting green.|$|E
500|$|The Guardian Gareth McLean {{described}} the episode as a [...] "bold move" [...] {{on the part}} of the EastEnders producers in deviating from the serial's usual format, and found it to be [...] "compelling and brave", but [...] "not as convincing as it should be". The Daily Telegraph Gerard O'Donovan felt that Brown gave a [...] "mesmerising" [...] performance, but was critical of the episode as a whole, concluding: [...] "Overall [...] the feeling couldn't be avoided that in the greater scheme of things this was a <b>fuss</b> <b>over</b> nothing.

[...] Leigh Holmwood for The Guardian suggested that viewers may have agreed with O'Donovan's assessment, highlighting the fact that the episode received only 8.7million viewers, compared to 9.4million watching EastEnders the previous week. O'Donovan compared the episode to Krapp's Last Tape, saying [...] "it must be said there were quite a few moments of positively (or perhaps that should be negatively) Beckettian bleakness here as Dot recalled, in painfully vivid detail, how time and time again 'life took away everything I ever cared about' and 'all that I ever 'ad, I lorst'." ...|$|E
500|$|Laughton was {{so pleased}} with O'Hara's {{performance}} in Jamaica Inn {{that she was}} cast opposite him in The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1939) for RKO in Hollywood. She boarded the RMS Queen Mary with him and her mother to New York, and then traveled by train to Hollywood. O'Hara's agent Lew Wasserman arranged for a pay increase from $80 a week to $700 a week. As {{the new face of}} RKO she garnered much attention from the Hollywood press and society before the film was even released, something which made her uncomfortable as she felt that she was being viewed as a [...] "novelty" [...] and [...] "people were making a <b>fuss</b> <b>over</b> me because of something I hadn't yet done, something they just thought I might do". O'Hara portrayed Esmeralda, a gypsy dancer who is imprisoned and later sentenced to death by the Parisian authorities. Director William Dieterle initially showed concern that O'Hara was too tall and disliked her wavy hair, asking for her to step under a shower to straighten it out. Filming commenced in the San Fernando Valley, {{at a time when the}} city was experiencing its hottest summer in its history. O'Hara described it as a [...] "physically demanding shoot", due to the heavy makeup and costume requirements, and recalls that she gasped at Laughton in makeup as Quasimodo, remarking, [...] "Good God, Charles. Is that really you?". O'Hara insisted on doing her own stunts from the outset, and for the scene in which the hangman places a noose around her neck, no safety nets were used. The film was a commercial success, taking $3 million at the box office. O'Hara was generally praised for her performance though some critics thought that Laughton stole the show. One critic thought that was the strength of the film, writing: [...] "The contrast between Laughton as the pathetic hunchback and O'Hara as the fresh-faced, tenderly solicitous gypsy girl is Hollywood teaming at its most inspired".|$|E

2500|$|On 3 July 2013, Exaro and Channel 4 news {{broke the}} story of a {{secretly}} recorded tape. The tape was recorded by Sun journalists and in it Murdoch can be heard telling them that the whole investigation was one big <b>fuss</b> <b>over</b> nothing, and that he, or his successors, would take care of any journalists who went to prison.

2500|$|His {{role in the}} {{censorship}} process reportedly earned Georgescu personally {{the hostility}} of poet Ion Barbu, a modernist from Lovinescu's circle, whose political opinions and artistic tenets had made him virtually unpublishable. According to Valeriu Râpeanu, Barbu {{came up to the}} critic in Bucharest's Casa Capşa restaurant, and defiantly questioned the logic and effectiveness of censorship. Barbu's argument compared the regime with parents who <b>fuss</b> <b>over</b> the possibility of their child masturbating to the point where that child becomes determined to try it, and concluding: [...] "That's what you communists are doing, by always telling poets not to imitate Ion Barbu, [...] 'don't follow up on Ion Barbu's poetry, be very careful because it's decadent poetry'. They will start to seek me out and read me." ...|$|E
2500|$|In Canada, {{where the}} Super Bowl {{telecast}} was broadcast by the Global Television Network, the incident passed largely without controversy: only about 50 Canadians {{complained about the}} incident to the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council (CBSC).

2500|$|Annie Reilly {{was born}} in Ireland in 1844. She later emigrated to the United States and settled down in New York City where Reilly found {{employment}} as a servant and child's nurse. She was said to look much younger than her age and was both charming and intelligent. She spoke {{at least two or}} three languages. Once gaining the confidence of the lady of the house, most often by making [...] "a great <b>fuss</b> <b>over</b> the children", she would rob the house of its valuables, usually jewelry, sometimes leaving with sometimes as much as four to five thousand dollars. She rarely stayed in one place for long, waiting only one or two days before robbing her employers, and eventually became known up and down the Eastern seaboard.
