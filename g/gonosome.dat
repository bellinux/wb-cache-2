40|$|As {{individuals}} with genetic sperm defects are {{intracytoplasmic sperm injection}} candidates, {{the study of the}} chromosomal constitution of their spermatozoa is of great interest. This study is a review of the current literature concerning fluorescence in situ hybridisation studies in spermatozoa with genetic sperm defect as 'round head', 'dysplasia of fibrous sheath' (DFS), 'primary ciliary dyskinesia' (PCD), the 'detached tail' and the 'absence of fibrous sheath'. Regarding sperm head defects, elevated XY disomy and diplodies were detected. Genetic defects affecting the sperm tail seemed to have a different correlation with chromosome meiotic segregation. Only chromosome 18, among the autosomes, was studied and the percentage of frequency of disomy was generally within the normal range. In the more frequently studied defect, DFS, the alterations in <b>gonosome</b> disomy and diploidy were recorded by different groups. Regarding PCD defects, elevated frequencies of disomy of sex chromosomes and diploidy were observed, whereas the absence of the fibrous sheath and the detached tail did not show any meiotic disturbance.

40|$|DNA {{libraries}} from sorted human <b>gonosomes</b> {{were used}} selectively to stain the X and Y chromosomes in normal and aberrant cultured human cells by chromosomal in situ suppression (CISS-) hybridization. The entire X chromosome was stained in metaphase spreads. Interphase chromosome domains {{of both the}} active and inactive X were clearly delineated. CISS-hybridization of the Y chromosome resulted in the specific decoration of the euchromatic part (Ypter-q 11), whereas the heterochromatic part (Yq 12) remained unlabeled. The stained part of the Y chromosome formed a compact domain in interphase nuclei. This approach was applied to amniotic fluid cells containing a ring chromosome of unknown origin (47,XY; +r). The ring chromosome was not stained by library probes from the <b>gonosomes,</b> thereby suggesting its autosomal origin. The sensitivity of CISS-hybridization was demonstrated by the detection of small translocations and fragments in human lymphocyte metaphase spreads after irradiation with 60 Co-gamma-rays. Lymphocyte cultures from two XX-males were investigated by CISS-hybridization with Y-library probes. In both cases, metaphase spreads demonstrated a translocation of Yp-material to the short arm of an X chromosome. The translocated Y-material could also be demonstrated directly in interphase nuclei. CISS-hybridization of autosomes 7 and 13 was used for prenatal diagnosis in a case with a known balanced translocation t(7; 13) in the father. The same translocation was observed in amniotic fluid cells from the fetus. Specific staining of the chromosomes involved in such translocations will be particularly important, in the future, in cases that cannot be solved reliably by conventional chromosome banding alone. ...|$|R

40|$|Chromosomal sex {{determination}} {{is a widely}} distributed strategy in nature. In the most classic scenario, one sex {{is characterized by a}} homologue pair of sex chromosomes, while the other includes two morphologically and functionally distinct gonosomes. In mammalian diploid cells, the female is characterized by the presence of two identical X chromosomes, while the male features an XY pair, with the Y bearing the major genetic determinant of sex, i. e. the SRY gene. In other species, such as the fruitfly, sex is determined by the ratio of autosomes to X chromosomes. Regardless of the exact mechanism, however, all these animals would exhibit a sex-specific gene expression inequality, due to the different number of X chromosomes, a phenomenon inhibited by a series of genetic and epigenetic regulatory events described as "dosage compensation". Since adequate available data is currently restricted to worms, flies and mammals, while for other groups of animals, such as reptiles, fish and birds it is very limited, it is not yet clear whether this is an evolutionary conserved mechanism. However certain striking similarities have already been observed among evolutionary distant species, such as Drosophila melanogaster and Mus musculus. These mainly refer to a) the need for a counting mechanism, to determine the chromosomal content of the cell, i. e. the ratio of autosomes to gonosomes (a process well understood in flies, but still hypothesized in mammals), b) the implication of non-translated, sex-specific, regulatory RNAs (roX and Xist, respectively) as key elements in this process and the location of similar mediators in the Z chromosome of chicken c) the inclusion of a chromatin modification epigenetic final step, which ensures that gene expression remains stably regulated throughout the affected area of the <b>gonosome.</b> This review summarizes these points and proposes a possible role for comparative genetics, as they seem to constitute proof of maintained cell economy (by using the same basic regulatory elements in various different scenarios) throughout numerous centuries of evolutionary history...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background By {{comparing}} the quail genome {{with that of}} chicken, chromosome rearrangements {{that have occurred in}} these two galliform species over 35 million years of evolution can be detected. From a more practical point of view, the definition of conserved syntenies helps to predict the position of genes in quail, based on information taken from the chicken sequence, thus enhancing the utility of this species in biological studies through a better knowledge of its genome structure. A microsatellite and an Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) genetic map were previously published for quail, as well as comparative cytogenetic data with chicken for macrochromosomes. Quail genomics will benefit from the extension and the integration of these maps. Results The integrated linkage map presented here is based on segregation analysis of both anonymous markers and functional gene loci in 1, 050 quail from three independent F 2 populations. Ninety-two loci are resolved into 14 autosomal linkage groups and a Z chromosome-specific linkage group, aligned with the quail AFLP map. The size of linkage groups ranges from 7. 8 cM to 274. 8 cM. The total map distance covers 904. 3 cM with an average spacing of 9. 7 cM between loci. The coverage is not complete, as macrochromosome CJA 08, the <b>gonosome</b> CJAW and 23 microchromosomes have no marker assigned yet. Significant sequence identities of quail markers with chicken enabled the alignment of the quail linkage groups on the chicken genome sequence assembly. This, together with interspecific Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH), revealed very high similarities in marker order between the two species for the eight macrochromosomes and the 14 microchromosomes studied. Conclusion Integrating the two microsatellite and the AFLP quail genetic maps greatly enhances the quality of the resulting information and will thus facilitate the identification of Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL). The alignment with the chicken chromosomes confirms the high conservation of gene order that was expected between the two species for macrochromosomes. By extending the comparative study to the microchromosomes, we suggest that a wealth of information can be mined in chicken, to be used for genome analyses in quail. </p...|$|E

METHODS: Lymphocyte karyotypes were evaluated using Giemsa-Trypsin-Giemsa banding and fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH). Semen analysis was performed by light and transmission electron microscopy. FISH of sperm nuclei was carried out to detect possible ICE. RESULTS: Lymphocyte karyotype ana-lysis revealed five t(13; 14), one t(13; 21) and one t(14; 22) carriers.

The FISH method, although being based on random selection and human factor, proved sufficient sensitivity as well as specificity in the field of low-frequency mosaicism diagnostics. The main critical factors responsible for potential misinterpretation of the data arose from inherent characteristics of the biological material, incorrect targeting of the analysis, probe instability, bleed through effect and absence of mitosis during the structural aberrations analysis...|$|R
40|$|Small {{supernumerary}} marker chromosomes (sSMC) {{can appear}} in a numerically normal 'basic karyotype', but also in a numerically abnormal one like a Turner syndrome karyotype (= sSMCT). Here we present 17 new cases with such a mos 45,X/ 46,X,+mar karyotype. Moreover we reviewed all 512 cytogenetically similar cases available from the literature and supply {{for the first time}} data on occurrence, shapes and subgroups of this rare cytogenetic entity. sSMCT are very rare in the common population (1 : 100, 000) - however, they can be observed with a 45 - and even 60 -times higher frequency in infertile and (develop) mentally retarded patients, respectively. Even though sSMCT derive from one of the <b>gonosomes</b> in > 99 % of the cases, there are also exceptional reports on sSMCT derived from one of the autosomes. The majority of sSMCT(X) form ring chromosomes, while most sSMCT(Y) are inverted duplicated/isodicentric chromosomes. Although > 500 sSMCT are reported, a detailed characterization of the chromosomal breakpoints is only given for a minority. Thus, more cases with detailed (molecular) cytogenetic marker chromosome characterization are needed to provide information on formation and effects of an sSMCT. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Animal sex {{chromosome}} evolution has started on different occasions with a homologous pair of autosomes leading to morphologically differentiated <b>gonosomes.</b> In contrast to other vertebrate classes, among fishes cytologically dernonstrahle {{sex chromosome}}s are rare. In reptiles, certain motifs of simple tandemly repeated DNA sequences like (gata) _n/(gaca) _m {{are associated with}} the constitutive heterochromatin of sex chromosomes. In this study a panel of simple repetitive sequence probes was hybridized to restriction enzyme digested genomic DNA of poeciliid fishes. Apparent male heterogamety previously established by genetic experiments in Poecilia reticulata (guppy) was correlated with male-specific hybridization using the (GACA) _ 4 probe. The (GATA) _ 4 oligonucleotide identifies certain male guppies by a Y chromosomal polymorphism in the outbred population. In cantrast none of the genetically defined heterogametic situations in Xiphophorus could be verified consistently using the collection of simple repetitive sequence probes. Only individuals from particular populations produced sex-specific patterns of hybridization with (GATA) _ 4. Additional poeciliid species (P. sphenops, P. velifera) harbour different sex-specifically organized simple repeat motifs. The observed sex-specific hybridization patterns were substantiated by banding analyses of the karyotypes and by in situ hybridization using the (GACA) _ 4 probe...|$|R
40|$|The {{presented}} bachelor work {{is focused}} on the determination of frequency chromosomally abnormal sperm in the semen of healthy men (donors) with normal karyotype (46, XY). The important process, which plays an irreplaceable {{role in the development of}} numerical aberrations of chromosomes or structural abnormalities in the segregation of the gametes, is meiosis. Therefore, I devote much attention on meiosis in the theoretical part. The theoretical part {{is focused on}} the process of pre mature sperm (spermatogenesis), and the consequences of fertilize the oocyte by aneuploid sperm. In my work I present an overview of numerical abnormalities in autosomes and <b>gonosomes</b> and their frequency and distribution of gametes in healthy men. I also focused on the distribution and a brief description of structural aberrations affecting chromosomes and not least I paid attention on method of multicolor interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization, which in combination with sperm chromatin dekondenzation become irreplaceable and valuable research tool for rapid analysis of chromosomal abnormalities in large sperm samples. The experimental part of bachelor work deals with monitoring the frequency of selected numerical abnormalities in sperm samples of five donors aged 23 to 30 years with the use of I-FISH (fluorescence in situ [...] ...|$|R
