5|$|The first {{large-scale}} organized sit-in was on Saturday, February 13, 1960. At about 12:30 pm, 124 students, {{most of them}} black, {{walked into}} the downtown Woolworths, S. H. Kress, and McClellan stores and asked to be served at the lunch counters. After the staff refused to serve them, they sat <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>stores</b> for two hours and then left without incident.|$|E
5|$|Recruitment for the women's {{services}} {{began in}} June 1941. Most volunteers were married women, {{many of them}} the wives of military men.

In addition to jobs as typists, clerks, caterers and the like, women served as drivers and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>stores</b> and workshops. Many {{of the women in the}} air service did skilled work, checking flying instruments, testing parts and doing minor repairs. The women of the Auxiliary Police Service served as BSAP officers both in stations and on the streets.|$|E
5|$|Tensions mounted {{over the}} {{following}} week as sit-in demonstrations spread to other cities and race riots broke out in nearby Chattanooga. On February 27, the Nashville student activists held a fourth sit-in at the Woolworths, McClellan, and Walgreens stores. Crowds of white youths again gathered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>stores</b> to taunt and harass the demonstrators. This time, however, police were not present. Eventually, several of the sit-in demonstrators were attacked by hecklers in the McClellan and Woolworths stores. Some were pulled from their seats and beaten, and one demonstrator was pushed {{down a flight of}} stairs. When police arrived, the white attackers fled and none were arrested. Police then ordered the demonstrators at all three locations to leave the stores. When the demonstrators refused to leave, they were arrested and loaded into police vehicles as onlookers applauded. Eighty-one students were arrested and charged with loitering and disorderly conduct.|$|E

5|$|Johnson began {{thinking}} of life after basketball while still {{playing with the}} Lakers. He wondered why so many athletes had failed at business, and sought advice. During his seventh season in the NBA, he {{had a meeting with}} Michael Ovitz, CEO of Creative Artists Agency. Ovitz encouraged him to start reading business magazines and to use every connection available to him. Johnson learned everything he could about business, often meeting with corporate executives during road trips. Johnson's first foray into business, a high-end sporting goods store named Magic 32, failed after only one year, costing him $200,000. The experience taught him to listen to his customers and find out what products they wanted. Johnson has become a leading voice on how to invest in urban communities, creating redevelopment opportunities in underserved areas, most notably through his movie theaters and his partnership with Starbucks. He went to Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz with the idea that he could successfully open the coffee shops in urban areas. After showing Schultz the tremendous buying power of minorities, Johnson was able to purchase 125 Starbucks stores, which reported higher than average per capita sales. The partnership, called Urban Coffee Opportunities, placed Starbucks in locations such as Detroit, Washington, D.C., Harlem, and the Crenshaw District of Los Angeles. Johnson sold his remaining interest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>stores</b> back to the company in 2010, ending a successful twelve-year partnership. Johnson has also invested in urban California real estate and financial service companies catering to America's underserved markets via his Canyon-Johnson and Yucaipa-Johnson funds. Another major project is with Chicago-based Aon Corp., an insurance services company is designed to promote minority businesses. In 2006-07, Johnson was part of a syndicate that bought the Williamsburgh Savings Bank Tower, then the tallest building in Brooklyn, for $71 million and converted the 512-foot high landmark structure from an office building into luxury condominiums.|$|E
5|$|The {{ships which}} sail the {{southern}} sea {{and south of}} it are like houses. When their sails are spread they are like great clouds in the sky. Their rudders are several tens of feet long. A single ship carries several hundred men, and has <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>stores</b> a year's supply of grain. Pigs are fed and wine fermented on board. There is no account of dead or living, no {{going back to the}} mainland when once the people have set forth upon the caerulean sea. At daybreak, when the gong sounds aboard the ship, the animals can drink their fill, and crew and passengers alike forget all dangers. To those on board everything is hidden and lost in space, mountains, landmarks, and the countries of foreigners. The shipmaster may say 'To make such and such a country, with a favourable wind, in so many days, we should sight such and such a mountain, (then) the ship must steer in such and such a direction'. But suddenly the wind may fall, and may not be strong enough to allow of the sighting of the mountain on the given day; in such a case, bearings may have to be changed. And the ship (on the other hand) may be carried far beyond (the landmark) and may lose its bearings. A gale may spring up, the ship may be blown hither and thither, it may meet with shoals or be driven upon hidden rocks, then it may be broken to the very roofs (of its deckhouses). A great ship with heavy cargo has nothing to fear from the high seas, but rather in shallow water it will come to grief.|$|E

In Briggs's cabin, Deveau found personal items scattered about, including a sheathed sword under the bed, {{but most of the}} ship's papers were missing, together with the captain's navigational instruments. Galley equipment was neatly stowed away; there was no food prepared or under preparation, but there were ample provisions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>stores.</b> There were no obvious signs of fire or violence; the evidence indicated an orderly departure from the ship, by means of the missing lifeboat.|$|E
500|$|Nirvana {{wanted to}} do further work on the {{recorded}} tracks, and considered working with producer Scott Litt and remixing some tracks with Andy Wallace (who had mixed Nevermind). [...] Albini vehemently disagreed, and claimed he had {{an agreement with the}} band that it would not modify the tracks without his involvement. [...] Albini initially refused to give the album master tapes to Gold Mountain, but relented after a phone call from Novoselic. [...] The band decided against working with Wallace and chose to remix and augment the songs [...] "Heart-Shaped Box" [...] and [...] "All Apologies" [...] with Litt at Seattle's Bad Animals Studio in May 1993. [...] Furthermore, a remix of [...] "Pennyroyal Tea" [...] by Scott Litt (at Bad Animals on November 22, 1993) appears on the censored Wal-Mart and Kmart versions of In Utero; this remix is also available on the band's 2002 best-of compilation, Nirvana, and is the same mix that appeared on the single. [...] One song, [...] "I Hate Myself and Want to Die", was omitted from the final track listing as Cobain felt there were too many [...] "noise" [...] songs on the album. [...] The rest of the album was left unaltered aside from a remastering which sharpened the bass guitar sound and increased the volume of the vocals by approximately three decibels. [...] Albini was critical of the album's final mix; he said, [...] "The end result, the record <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>stores</b> doesn't sound all that much like the record that was made. [...] Though it's still them singing and playing their songs, and the musical quality of it still comes across." ...|$|E
