40|$|To {{determine}} if pregnant, literate women and female community health volunteers (FCHVs) in Nepal can accurately determine a woman's eligibility for medical abortion (MA) using a toolkit, compared to comprehensive abortion care (CAC) trained providers. We conducted a prospective diagnostic accuracy {{study in which}} women presenting for first trimester abortion, and FCHVs, independently assessed each woman's eligibility for MA using a modified gestational <b>dating</b> <b>wheel</b> to determine gestational age and a nine-point checklist of MA contraindications or cautions. Ability to determine MA eligibility was compared to experienced CAC-providers using Nepali standard of care. Both women (n = 3131) and FCHVs (n = 165) accurately interpreted the wheel 96 % of the time, and the eligibility checklist 72 % and 95 % of the time, respectively. Of the 649 women who reported potential contraindications or cautions on the checklist, 88 % misidentified as eligible. Positive predictive value (PPV) of women's assessment of eligibility based on gestational age was 93 % (95 % CI 92, 94) compared to CAC-providers' (n = 47); PPV of the medical contraindications checklist and overall (90 % [95 % CI 88, 91] and 93 % [95 % CI 92, 94] respectively) must {{be interpreted with caution}} given women's difficulty using the checklist.

Although a promising strategy to assist women and FCHVs to assess MA eligibility, further refinement of the eligibility tools, particularly the checklist, is needed before their widespread use...|$|R

[...] In addition, while road-traveling vehicles are typically measured from the outermost portions of the wheel rims (and {{there is some evidence that}} the first railroads were measured in this way as well), it became apparent that for vehicles travelling on rails it was better to have the wheel flanges located inside the rails, and thus the distance measured on the inside of the wheels (and, by extension, the inside faces of the rail heads), was the important one.|$|R
50|$|The Iron Age between 700BC and AD43 saw a {{significant}} increase in the density of settlement in the area, with evidence of a large number of farming settlements encompassing both arable and pastoral agriculture, each probably occupied by a single family group. Iron Age pottery has been found at a wide variety of sites within the city centre, including the north bailey of the Castle, Low Pavement, Fisher Gate, Halifax Place and a shallow ditch between Woolpack Lane and Barker Gate. Excavations of settlements at Gamston provided evidence of small-scale pottery and textile industries and extensive trading links, with salt from Cheshire, pottery from Charnwood Forest and querns from the Pennines. The importance of the Trent as a trade route during the period has been shown by the discovery of three dugout canoes and a spoked <b>wheel</b> <b>dating</b> from the Iron Age in the gravels at Holme Pierrepont. Iron Age ditches have been excavated at Nottingham Castle and at several sites in the Lace Market, suggesting that pre-historic fortifications in these areas are possible.|$|R
