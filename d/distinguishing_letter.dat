Spectral classification of white dwarfs The classification scheme for white dwarfs (WD) developed in the beginning in analogy to the main sequence spectral types, with a <b>distinguishing</b> <b>letter</b> “D ” for degenerate object. DAs thus were stars with very strong Balmer lines, DBs had strong He I lines, DOs He II. Today we know that this classification – in contrast to the main sequence – has not much to do wit...|$|E
40|$|Low {{literacy}} is termed 'developmental dyslexia' when reading is significantly behind that {{expected from the}} intelligence quotient (IQ) {{in the presence of}} other symptoms [...] incoordination, left-right confusions, poor sequencing [...] that characterize it as a neurological syndrome. 5 - 10 % of children, particularly boys, are found to be dyslexic. Reading requires the acquisition of good orthographic skills for recognising the visual form of words which allows one to access their meaning directly. It also requires the development of good phonological skills for sounding out unfamiliar words using knowledge of letter sound conversion rules. In the dyslexic brain, temporoparietal language areas on the two sides are symmetrical without the normal left-sided advantage. Also brain 'warts' (ectopias) are found, particularly clustered round the left temporoparietal language areas. The visual magnocellular system is responsible for timing visual events when reading. It therefore signals any visual motion that occurs if unintended movements lead to images moving off the fovea ('retinal slip'). These signals are then used to bring the eyes back on target. Thus, sensitivity to visual motion seems to help determine how well orthographic skill can develop in both good and bad readers. In dyslexics, the development of the visual magnocellular system is impaired: development of the magnocellular layers of the dyslexic lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) is abnormal; their motion sensitivity is reduced; many dyslexics show unsteady binocular fixation; hence poor visual localization, particularly on the left side (left neglect). Dyslexics' binocular instability and visual perceptual instability, therefore, can cause the letters they are trying to read to appear to move around and cross over each other. Hence, blanking one eye (monocular occlusion) can improve reading. Thus, good magnocellular function is essential for high motion sensitivity and stable binocular fixation, hence proper development of orthographic skills. Many dyslexics also have auditory/phonological problems. <b>Distinguishing</b> <b>letter</b> sounds depends on picking up the changes in sound frequency and amplitude that characterize them. Thus, high frequency (FM) and amplitude modulation (AM) sensitivity helps the development of good phonological skill, and low sensitivity impedes the acquisition of these skills. Thus dyslexics' sensitivity to FM and AM is significantly lower than that of good readers and this explains their problems with phonology. The cerebellum is the head ganglion of magnocellular systems; it contributes to binocular fixation and to inner speech for sounding out words, and it is clearly defective in dyslexics. Thus, there is evidence that most reading problems have a fundamental sensorimotor cause. But why do magnocellular systems fail to develop properly? There is a clear genetic basis for impaired development of magnocells throughout the brain. The best understood linkage is to the region of the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) Class 1 on the short arm of chromosome 6 which helps to control the production of antibodies. The development of magnocells may be impaired by autoantibodies affecting the developing brain. Magnocells also need high amounts of polyunsaturated fatty acids to preserve the membrane flexibility that permits the rapid conformational changes of channel proteins which underlie their transient sensitivity. But the genes that underlie magnocellular weakness would not be so common unless there were compensating advantages to dyslexia. In developmental dyslexics there may be heightened development of parvocellular systems that underlie their holistic, artistic, 'seeing the whole picture' and entrepreneurial talents...|$|E

40|$|Despite the {{attention}} given to reading instruction by teachers and researchers, the nature of some basic skills involved in the reading process has not been sufficiently examined. Letter discrimination is one of these. Reading specialists feel that children {{must be able to}} <b>distinguish</b> one <b>letter</b> from another before they can learn more complex tasks such as decoding and word analysis. Yet the data presented in this paper suggest that a substantial proportion or children do not adequately <b>distinguish</b> between <b>letters</b> until they reach the third grade. Most of the problems encountered in teaching letter discrimination appear to result from the lack of a completely satisfactory description of what is meant by "knowing the letters of the alphabet " and a lack of techniques for measuring such knowledge. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to develop a behavioral definition of letter recognition, to present a test for measuring the extent to which children can recognize letters, and to report data for kindergarten through grade three using that test.

However, these projections are absent from upper case letters, which in some cases are only distinguishable by subtle internal cues.

These characters generally comprise half the characters in a genetic sequence but are differentiated by a small internal tick (depending on the typeface). Nevertheless, these Roman characters are available in the ASCII character set most commonly used in textual communications, which reinforces this system's ubiquity.|$|R
