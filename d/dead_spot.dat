2500|$|Rotor is a {{trade name}} of a type of crank used in the {{transmission}} system of a bicycle. Unlike a standard pair of cranks that always remain at 180 degrees relative to each other, the Rotor system varies this angle through the circle of motion. The chainrings also speed up and slow down, which increases and decreases {{the size of the}} gear temporarily as the crankset rotates. [...] The effect of these movements minimizes the <b>dead</b> <b>spot</b> (where little power is produced) at {{the top and bottom of}} the pedaling cycle, and reduces knee strain.

2500|$|Carburetion {{had five}} {{separate}} circuits. Suzuki used peripheral ports for the RE5, as they give better high-speed running but {{are known to}} have low-speed issues. This is dealt with by using a two-stage Mikuni carburetor. An 18mm throat splits into two small peripheral induction tracts. The primary butterfly is directly controlled by one of the five throttle cables, providing smooth low-speed running. A diaphragm controls the secondary carburetor port, and this is activated when a set vacuum is reached in the carburetor circuit. This much larger 32mm port enters the rotor chamber between and slightly below the two small primary ports. Indirectly involved with carburetion is the unique [...] "port valve". This small butterfly valve pivots in the rotor housing inside the secondary port and is directly controlled by another of the throttle cables. Without the port valve, the long induction tract of the secondary port would fill with traces of exhaust gasses whenever the secondary valve was closed. This occurs as the tip of the rotor passes the induction port {{at the end of the}} exhaust cycle before beginning the induction cycle. If this was allowed to happen, when the secondary throat finally opened the engine would first swallow an induction charge contaminated with exhaust gasses causing a momentary misfire and felt as a <b>dead</b> <b>spot</b> or hesitation in acceleration. The port valve is therefore effectively timed to remain closed whenever the secondary carburetor throat is closed, isolating the induction tract from exhaust gasses. Carburetor tuning involves adjusting cables controlling the primary butterfly and the port valve, among other things, illustrated by Suzuki Service Bulletin Nine. The carburetor also incorporated a fuel pump which was mechanically actuated at 35 degrees of primary butterfly movemement (later changed to 28 degrees) to enrich the fuel mixture during acceleration.|$|E

40|$|<b>Dead</b> <b>spot</b> is a {{relatively}} new disease of creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera L.) incited by Ophiosphaerella agrostis Dernoeden, M. P. S. Câmara N. R. O’Neill van Berkum et M. E. Palm. Limited information is available with regards to chemical and cultural management strategies for <b>dead</b> <b>spot.</b> Two field studies were designed to evaluate the influence of various fertilizers and iprodione on the recovery of <b>dead</b> <b>spot</b> when applied after or during peak <b>dead</b> <b>spot</b> activity. When applied after peak activity, all N-sources (ammonium sulfate, IBDU, SCU, urea, Ringer Greens Super, and methylene urea) aided in the recovery and healing of <b>dead</b> <b>spot,</b> but none provided for complete recovery prior to winter. Plots treated with ammonium sulfate and IBDU were among the fastest and slowest to recover, respectively. Iprodione (3 -(3, 5 -dichlorophenyl) -N-(1 -methylethyl) - 2, 4 -dioxo- 1 -imidazolidinecarboxamide) failed to improve <b>dead</b> <b>spot</b> recovery when applications were initiated in late summer after most injury was evident.

40|$|Ophiosphaerella agrostis is a newly {{described}} pathogen that incites <b>dead</b> <b>spot</b> {{disease of}} creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera) putting greens throughout the eastern United States. The objectives {{of this research}} project were to: 1) monitor environmental conditions and develop a predictive model for disease progress and pathogen dispersal under field conditions; 2) {{determine the effect of}} various fertilizers on <b>dead</b> <b>spot</b> recovery in bentgrass; and 3) develop molecular methods to diagnoses the disease and determine genetic variation among O. agrostis isolates. Field studies showed that the appearance of <b>dead</b> <b>spot</b> infection centers was influenced predominantly by air ({{greater than or equal to}} 18 degrees Centigrade) and soil (greater than or equal to 20 degrees Centigrade) temperature, but other factors including low relative humidity (less than or equal to 80 %), shortened periods of leaf wetness (less than or equal to 14 hours), and high levels of solar radiation (greater than or equal to 230 W m to the minus 2) were associated with the development of <b>dead</b> <b>spot</b> epidemics. Patch diameter of O. agrostis infection centers and pseudothecia production generally increased at a linear rate between mid-June and early to mid-August. In a growth chamber study, ascospores were released from pseudothecia following a sharp decrease in relative humidity. Field studies revealed that ascospore release occurred primarily at dawn and dusk or during precipitation events. During precipitation events, ascospores may be forcefully discharged during the entire event, but most ascospores are released within the first 10 hours after precipitation begins. O. agrostis successfully over-wintered in bentgrass leaf sheaths, crowns, roots, and stolons, but little or no reactivation of the disease occurred in the second year. Plots treated with ammonium sulfate and isobutylidene diurea were among the fastest and slowest to recover from <b>dead</b> <b>spot,</b> respectively. In the second year (2003), <b>dead</b> <b>spot</b> recurred in plots treated since 2002 with KNO 3, Ca(NO 3) 2, urea, and a complete fertilizer (20 - 20 - 20), but disease symptoms did not recur in plots receiving ammonium sulfate.
