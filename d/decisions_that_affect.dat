5|$|In {{the case}} of ministerial discretion, it has been {{established}} in Carltona Ltd. v. Commissioner of Works (1943) that it is not unlawful for a civil servant to take a decision on behalf of the minister, even where a statute confers discretion on a minister. Parliament will expect only that the power is to be exercised by an appropriate official. However, the minister is ultimately responsible for decisions taken on his or her behalf. While there has been discussion in case law about whether a minister should be required to personally exercise discretion in <b>decisions</b> <b>that</b> <b>affect</b> a person's liberty, the courts have usually been reluctant to hold so. Such a requirement, however, has been made by way of statutes which require the minister to act personally.|$|E

500|$|Public policy {{determines the}} extent to which {{renewable}} energy (RE) is to be incorporated into a developed or developing country's generation mix. Energy sector regulators implement that policy—thus affecting the pace and pattern of RE investments and connections to the grid. Energy regulators often have authority to carry out a number of functions that have implications for the financial feasibility of renewable energy projects. [...] Such functions include issuing licenses, setting performance standards, monitoring the performance of regulated firms, determining the price level and structure of tariffs, establishing uniform systems of accounts, arbitrating stakeholder disputes (like interconnection cost allocations), performing management audits, developing agency human resources (expertise), reporting sector and commission activities to government authorities, and coordinating decisions with other government agencies. [...] Thus, regulators make a wide range of <b>decisions</b> <b>that</b> <b>affect</b> the financial outcomes associated with RE investments. In addition, the sector regulator {{is in a position to}} give advice to the government regarding the full implications of focusing on climate change or energy security. [...] The energy sector regulator is the natural advocate for efficiency and cost-containment throughout the process of designing and implementing RE policies. [...] Since policies are not self-implementing, energy sector regulators become a key facilitator (or blocker) of renewable energy investments.|$|E

At {{the beginning of}} the game, the player chooses a race for their player character: human, dwarf, elf, are playable races, with Qunari playable for the first time. Players customize the Inquisitor's physical appearance, and gender, among other things. Players choose from three classes, warrior, mage, and rogue, and can specialize their character, which grant them specific abilities. The character would later evolve to become the Inquisitor of Thedas, who is considered [...] "holy" [...] by the citizens there. As the Inquisitor, players had to make choices and <b>decisions</b> <b>that</b> <b>affect</b> and change the game's world state. In addition, they can [...] "judge" [...] certain people on their behaviors and decide their fate. Thedas is the game's world, which includes Ferelden, where [...] was set, as well as three new unexplored regions, which include Orlais, Nevarra and the Free Marches. The game is not an open world video game, as the world is broken up into several sections, which can be freely explored by players. Despite that, BioWare claimed that one of the levels featured in Inquisition is larger than the entire game of Dragon Age II. In addition, each region features different environments like deserts, swamps, and mountains. In order to allow players to navigate the game's world faster, mounts, which are creatures that can be ridden by players, are introduced.|$|E
