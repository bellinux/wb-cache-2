5|$|Cross-country {{skiing is}} a form of skiing where skiers rely on their own {{locomotion}} to move across snow-covered terrain, rather than using ski lifts or other forms of assistance. Cross-country skiing is widely practiced as a sport and recreational activity; however, some still use it as a means of transportation. Variants of cross-country skiing are adapted to a range of terrain which spans unimproved, sometimes mountainous terrain to <b>groomed</b> courses that are specifically designed for the sport.|$|E
40|$|<b>Grooming</b> {{in small}} felids has {{received}} little attention compared with <b>grooming</b> in rodents, bovids and primates where <b>grooming</b> is also common. This study {{set out to}} describe the general pattern, time budget and degree of cephalocaudal sequencing of self-oral <b>grooming</b> in the domestic cat. In 11 cats confined {{for the purposes of}} videotaping, sleeping and resting accounted for 50 % of the time budget. Oral <b>grooming,</b> 91 % of which was to multiple body regions, accounted for 4 % of the overall time budget or 8 % of non-sleepingrresting time. Scratch <b>grooming,</b> always directed to single regions, occupied about 1 r 50 of the time of oral <b>grooming.</b> There was a moderate and significant cephalocaudal trend to <b>grooming.</b> An increased likelihood for oral <b>grooming</b> to follow periods of sleep or rest was indicated by a significant negative correlation between sleeprrest duration and latency to the subsequent <b>grooming</b> bout. The effect of enforced deprivation of <b>grooming</b> on the subsequent occurrence of <b>grooming</b> was explored by the 3 -day application of Elizabethian collars, which prevented oral <b>grooming</b> or control collars that did not prevent <b>grooming.</b> In the 12 h immediately after removal of the Elizabethian collars, oral <b>grooming</b> increased by 67 % and scratch <b>grooming</b> by 200 % compared with the <b>grooming</b> rate after removal of control collars. By the second 12 h, the apparent catch-up effect of <b>grooming</b> had disappeared.

Parasite-defence <b>grooming</b> is regulated both by a central control mechanism (programmed <b>grooming</b> model) and by cutaneous stimulation from bites (stimulus-driven model). To study the evolution of para-site-defence <b>grooming</b> in ungulates, we compared species-typical <b>grooming</b> behaviour with host morphology and hab-itat to test predictions of the programmed <b>grooming</b> model while taking into account phylogenetic relatedness.

5|$|<b>Groomed</b> trail skiing {{occurs at}} facilities, such as Nordmarka (Oslo), Royal Gorge Cross Country Ski Resort and Gatineau Park, Quebec, where trails {{are laid out}} and <b>groomed</b> for both classic and skate-skiing. Such {{grooming}} and track setting (for classic technique) requires specialized equipment and techniques that adapt to {{the condition of the}} snow. Trail preparation employs snow machines that tow snow compaction, texturing and track-setting devices. Groomers must adapt such equipment to the condition of the snow—crystal structure, temperature, degree of compaction, moisture content, etc. Depending on the initial condition of the snow, grooming may achieve an increase in density for new-fallen snow or a decrease in density for icy or compacted snow. Cross-country ski facilities may incorporate a course design that meets homologation standards for such organizations as the International Olympic Committee, the International Ski Federation or national standards. Standards address course distances, degree of difficulty with maximums in elevation difference and steepness—both up and downhill, plus other factors. Some facilities have night-time lighting on select trails—called lysløype (light trails) in Norwegian and elljusspår (electric light trails) in Swedish. The first lysløype were opened in 1946 in Nordmarka and at Byåsen (Trondheim).|$|E

40|$|Social {{networking}} sites (SNS) provide innovative social bonding methods {{known as}} social <b>grooming.</b> These have drastically decreased time and distance constraints of social <b>grooming.</b> Here we show two type social <b>grooming</b> (elaborate social <b>grooming</b> and lightweight social <b>grooming)</b> {{discovered in a}} model constructed by thirty communication data-sets including face to face, SNS, mobile phones, and Chacma baboons. This demarcation {{is caused by a}} trade-off between the number and strength of social relationships on social <b>grooming.</b> The trade-off of elaborate social <b>grooming</b> is weaker than the trade-off of lightweight social <b>grooming.</b> On the other hand, the cost of elaborate methods is higher than lightweight methods. This model connects micro-social <b>grooming</b> behaviour and macro-social structures with these trade-offs. People tend to use elaborate social <b>grooming</b> to reinforce close relationships and construct deep limited societies (e. g. face to face and Chacma baboons). This seems to be apriori. On the other hand, people tend to use lightweight social <b>grooming</b> to maintain many weak social relationships and construct expanded shallow societies (e. g. SNS). Humans recently have obtained this method. Humans with lightweight methods who live in significantly complex societies use various social <b>grooming</b> to effectively construct social relationships. Elaborate social <b>grooming</b> is for getting cooperation from close relationships. Lightweight social <b>grooming</b> is for getting information from many weak relationships...|$|R

40|$|There is a {{mismatch}} between lightpath channel capacity and traffic request capacity in wavelength division multiplexed (WDM) optical mesh networks.

We study the dynamic traffic <b>grooming</b> problem in WDM mesh networks using the fixed-alternate routing (FAR) approach. Based on the FAR approach, we propose the fixed-order <b>grooming</b> (FOG) algorithm to support on-line provisioning of multi-granularity subwavelength connections. As traffic <b>grooming</b> involves two-layered routing, it is {{significantly different from the}} routing and wavelength assignment (RWA) problem in wavelength-routed WDM networks. We introduce the route selection problem (also called <b>grooming</b> node selection problem) and propose three <b>grooming</b> policies to address this problem. The three <b>grooming</b> policies are load sharing (LS), sequential <b>grooming</b> (SG) and minimum gap (MG).
