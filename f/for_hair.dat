5|$|The flowers provide dyes {{of bright}} yellow or green, {{and have been}} used <b>for</b> <b>hair</b> dye. The dried leaves and hair were made into candle wicks, or put into shoes to help with {{insulating}} them. The dried stems were also dipped into suet or wax to make torches. Due to its weedy capacities, the plant, unlike other species of the genus (such as V.phoeniceum), is not often cultivated.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, a TV {{film was}} made on her life — The Jayne Mansfield Story — which was {{nominated}} for three Emmy Awards in the categories <b>for</b> <b>hair,</b> makeup and costume. In the film directed by Dick Lowry, Mansfield is played by Loni Anderson and her husband Mickey Hargitay is played by Arnold Schwarzenegger. She was featured in the A Television Networks TV series Biography in an episode titled Jayne Mansfield: Blonde Ambition. The TV series won an Emmy Award in outstanding non-fiction TV series category in 2001. A again featured her life in another TV serial titled Dangerous Curves in 1999. In 1988, her story and archival footage {{was a part of}} TV documentary Hollywood Sex Symbols. The first film documentary on her, The Wild, Wild World of Jayne Mansfield, started with herself working in the film, but it was finished in 1968 after her death and had to make use of archival footage. Fans of trash documentaries made a cult out of this film.|$|E

5|$|In September, Ferreira starred as Kaycee in the {{independent}} film The Green Inferno. In the early morning of September 14, she and her boyfriend, DIIV frontman Zachary Cole Smith, were arrested at a traffic stop in Saugerties, New York for drug possession. Ferreira, who was in possession of ecstasy tablets, was arrested on drug possession and resisting arrest; Smith was in possession of heroin. She bailed herself out. In October, Ferreira cancelled the final week of her tour with Vampire Weekend after sustaining a hemorrhage to her vocal cords, which she later added {{was caused by a}} vocal node that was repeatedly misdiagnosed as laryngitis. In November, Ferreira and Icona Pop were announced as the opening acts for Miley Cyrus' Bangerz Tour, which began on February 14, 2014. Later that month, she released her third extended play, Night Time, My Time: B-Sides Part 1. In December, Ferreira was announced as the spokeswoman <b>for</b> <b>hair</b> care brand Redken.|$|E

25|$|Gary Bolton (Terence Creasy/Chris Andrews) – Gary is {{the third}} male Yellowcoat. He is often portrayed as a very vain man, obsessed with women and his appearance. He had a {{personal}} crisis during the 1960 season four when he couldn't {{take part in the}} assault course race against the Marines because he was receiving treatment <b>for</b> <b>hair</b> loss.

25|$|The Gorgoneion {{appears to}} have {{originated}} as an apotropaic symbol intended to ward off evil. In a late myth invented to explain {{the origins of the}} Gorgon, Medusa is described as having been a young priestess who served in the temple of Athena in Athens. Poseidon lusted after Medusa, and raped her in the temple of Athena, refusing to allow her vow of chastity to stand in his way. Upon discovering the desecration of her temple, Athena transformed Medusa into a hideous monster with serpents <b>for</b> <b>hair</b> whose gaze would turn any mortal to stone.|$|E
25|$|The {{effects of}} this mixing depend on the types (the alleles) of the gene. If the father has two copies of an allele <b>for</b> red <b>hair,</b> and the mother has two copies <b>for</b> brown <b>hair,</b> all their {{children}} get the two alleles that give different instructions, one <b>for</b> red <b>hair</b> and one <b>for</b> brown. The <b>hair</b> color of these children depends on how these alleles work together. If one allele dominates the instructions from another, {{it is called the}} dominant allele, and the allele that is overridden is called the recessive allele. In the case of a daughter with alleles for both red and brown hair, brown is dominant and she ends up with brown hair.|$|R

25|$|Usually {{referred}} to in works on architecture as foliate heads or foliate masks, carvings of the Green Man may take many forms, naturalistic or decorative. The simplest depict a man's face peering out of dense foliage. Some may have leaves <b>for</b> <b>hair,</b> perhaps with a leafy beard. Often leaves or leafy shoots are shown growing from his open mouth and sometimes even from the nose and eyes as well. In the most abstract examples, the carving at first glance appears to be merely stylised foliage, with the facial element only becoming apparent on closer examination. The face is almost always male; green women are rare.|$|E
25|$|Although {{most of the}} {{communities}} of this period had mostly self-sufficient isolated economies, one important change was the return of trade with the Mediterranean by the now independent Carthage, a thriving Western Mediterranean power. Carthaginian merchants brought imports of wine, glass, pottery and other goods {{through a series of}} emporia, commercial post which sometimes included temples and other installations. At the same time, the archaeological register shows, through the finding of large quantities of fibulae, pins, pincers <b>for</b> <b>hair</b> extraction, pendants, earrings, torcs, bracelets, and other personal objects, the ongoing importance of the individual and his or her physical appearance. While the archaeological record of the Castro Iron Age show suggests a very egalitarian society, these findings imply the development of a privileged class with better access to prestige items.|$|E
25|$|Daniels {{answers the}} call leaving ASA Rhonda Pearlman alone to field {{questions}} from Deputy Commissioner William Rawls and Commissioner Ervin Burrell. She reports that forensics teams are attending each crime scene {{and they are}} recovering 9mm bullet casings, vacuuming <b>for</b> <b>hair</b> and fiber and laser printing for footprints. Daniels returns and is asked {{to confirm that the}} bodies are linked to one organization. He tells Burrell that Marlo Stanfield's drug organization is their prime focus and is then asked what they have on Stanfield. He explains that Major Crimes was building a case against Stanfield until three months ago when their wiretaps were pulled by Lieutenant Marimow. Burrell offers Daniels whatever support he needs. Daniels tells Burrell that he needs the patrol division to begin searching for houses. Daniels leaves to begin organizing a citywide search.|$|E

25|$|Three {{months after}} Hair opened, Hunt {{was on the}} cover of British high-fashion {{magazine}} Queen, the first black model to appear on their cover. In 1968, Hunt posed nude for photographer Patrick Lichfield after the opening night <b>for</b> <b>Hair</b> and the photo appeared {{on the cover of}} British Vogue′s January 1969 issue. Almost 40 years later Hunt again posed nude for Litchfield, recreating the pose for her Vogue Magazine cover five weeks after she had had her right breast and lymph glands removed to halt the spread of cancer. The photo appeared on the cover of her 2005 book Undefeated, about her battle with cancer. She was pleased to work with the photographer under such differing circumstances, though in her autobiography she expressed confusion as to why the photo has been so often reprinted. Hunt has also been photographed by Lewis Morley, Horace Ové, and Robert Taylor.|$|E
25|$|Heritability {{means the}} {{information}} in a given gene is not always exactly the same in every individual in that species, so the same gene in different individuals does not give exactly the same instructions. Each unique form of a single gene is called an allele; different forms are collectively called polymorphisms. As an example, one allele for the gene <b>for</b> <b>hair</b> color and skin cell pigmentation could instruct the body to produce black pigment, producing black hair and pigmented skin; while a different allele of the same gene in a different individual could give garbled instructions {{that would result in}} a failure to produce any pigment, giving white hair and no pigmented skin: albinism. Mutations are random changes in genes creating new alleles, which in turn produce new traits, which could help, harm, or have no new effect on the individual's likelihood of survival; thus, mutations are the basis for evolution.|$|E

500|$|Mr. Krabs is {{the only}} {{character}} on SpongeBob initially based on a specific person from Stephen Hillenburg's life. When designing Mr. Krabs, Hillenburg drew inspiration from his former manager at a seafood restaurant. According to Hillenburg, his manager was redheaded, muscular, and a former army cook; these three traits were adapted into Krabs' character, with Krabs' red color standing in <b>for</b> <b>hair.</b> Krabs' speaking manner was also inspired by the restaurant owner, who reminded Hillenburg of a pirate with his strong Maine accent.
