5|$|Owing to its {{acoustic}} properties, mercury {{was used}} as the propagation medium in <b>delay</b> <b>line</b> <b>memory</b> devices used in early digital computers of the mid-20th century.|$|E
5|$|Although early {{computers}} such as EDSAC made successful use {{of mercury}} <b>delay</b> <b>line</b> <b>memory,</b> the technology had several drawbacks; it was heavy, it was expensive, {{and it did}} not allow data to be accessed randomly. In addition, because data was stored as a sequence of acoustic waves propagated through a mercury column, the device's temperature had to be very carefully controlled, as the velocity of sound through a medium varies with its temperature. Williams had seen an experiment at Bell Labs demonstrating the effectiveness of cathode ray tubes (CRT) {{as an alternative to the}} delay line for removing ground echoes from radar signals. While working at the TRE, shortly before he joined the University of Manchester in December 1946, he and Tom Kilburn had developed a form of electronic memory known as the Williams or Williams–Kilburn tube based on a standard CRT, the first random-access digital storage device. The Manchester Small-Scale Experimental Machine (SSEM) was designed to show that the system was a practical storage device, by testing that data held within it could be read and written at the speed necessary for use in a computer.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of a von Neumann computer depended {{on the availability of}} a suitable memory device on which to store the program. During the Second World War researchers working on the problem of removing the clutter from radar signals had developed a form of <b>delay</b> <b>line</b> <b>memory,</b> the first practical application of which was the mercury delay line, developed by J. Presper Eckert. Radar transmitters send out regular brief pulses of radio energy, the reflections from which are displayed on a CRT screen. As operators are usually interested only in moving targets, it was desirable to filter out any distracting reflections from stationary objects. The filtering was achieved by comparing each received pulse with the previous pulse, and rejecting both if they were identical, leaving a signal containing only the images of any moving objects. To store each received pulse for later comparison it was passed through a transmission line, delaying it by exactly the time between transmitted pulses.|$|E
50|$|As soon as EDSAC was operational, {{it began}} serving the University's {{research}} needs. It used mercury <b>delay</b> <b>lines</b> for <b>memory,</b> and derated vacuum tubes for logic. Cycle time was 1.5 ms for all ordinary instructions, 6 ms for multiplication. Input was via five-hole punched tape and output was via a teleprinter.|$|R
5000|$|Second, {{instead of}} {{transmitting}} {{the red and}} blue information together, it only sends one of them at a time, and uses {{the information about the}} other color from the preceding line. It uses an analog <b>delay</b> <b>line,</b> a <b>memory</b> device, for storing one line of color information. This justifies the [...] "Sequential, With Memory" [...] name.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} theoretically and experimentally the characteristics, {{performance and}} possible applications of coupled resonator optical waveguides (CROWs). The ability to engineer the dispersion properties of a CROW {{and especially the}} ability to realize ultra-slow group velocities paves the way for various applications such as <b>delay</b> <b>lines,</b> optical <b>memories</b> and all-optical switching. Simple analytic expressions for the time delay, usable bandwidth and overall losses in CROW <b>delay</b> <b>lines</b> are derived and compared to exact numerical simulation. Good quantitative agreement is found between the theoretical transmission function obtained by transfer matrix formalism and the measurement of a CROW interferometer realized in polymer material.

25|$|The ENIAC {{design was}} frozen in 1944 to allow construction. Eckert and Mauchly were already {{aware of the}} {{limitations}} of the machine and began plans on a second computer, to be called EDVAC. By January 1945 they had procured a contract to build this stored-program computer. Eckert had proposed a mercury <b>delay</b> <b>line</b> <b>memory</b> to store both program and data. Later that year, mathematician John von Neumann learned of the project and joined in some of the engineering discussions. He produced what was understood to be an internal document describing the EDVAC.|$|E
2500|$|John Adam Presper [...] "Pres" [...] Eckert Jr. (April 9, 1919 – June 3, 1995) was an American {{electrical}} engineer and computer pioneer. [...] With John Mauchly he designed the first general-purpose electronic digital computer (ENIAC), presented {{the first course}} in computing topics (the Moore School Lectures), founded the Eckert–Mauchly Computer Corporation, and designed the first commercial computer in the U.S., the UNIVAC, which incorporated Eckert's invention of the mercury <b>delay</b> <b>line</b> <b>memory.</b>|$|E
2500|$|There {{followed}} {{a series of}} electronic calculator models from these and other manufacturers, including Canon, Mathatronics, Olivetti, SCM (Smith-Corona-Marchant), Sony, Toshiba, and Wang. The early calculators used hundreds of germanium transistors, which were cheaper than silicon transistors, on multiple circuit boards. Display types used were CRT, cold-cathode Nixie tubes, and filament lamps. Memory technology was usually based on the <b>delay</b> <b>line</b> <b>memory</b> or the magnetic core memory, though the Toshiba [...] "Toscal" [...] BC-1411 appears to have used an early form of dynamic RAM built from discrete components. Already there was a desire for smaller and less power-hungry machines.|$|E
50|$|A mercury <b>delay</b> <b>line</b> {{consisted}} of a long tube filled with mercury, a mechanical transducer on one end, and a microphone on the other end, much like a spring reverb unit later used in audio processing. Pulses were sent into the mercury <b>delay</b> <b>line</b> at one end, and took {{a certain amount of}} time to reach the other end. They were detected by the microphone, amplified, reshaped into the correct pulse shape, and sent back into the <b>delay</b> <b>line.</b> Thus, the <b>memory</b> was said to recirculate.|$|R

50|$|The memory {{capacity}} {{is determined by}} dividing the time taken to transmit one bit into {{the time it takes}} for data to circulate through the <b>delay</b> <b>line.</b> Early delay-line <b>memory</b> systems had capacities of a few thousand bits, with recirculation times measured in microseconds. To read or write a particular bit stored in such a memory, it is necessary to wait for that bit to circulate through the <b>delay</b> <b>line</b> into the electronics. The delay to read or write any particular bit is no longer than the recirculation time.|$|R
50|$|<b>Delay</b> <b>line</b> <b>memory</b> {{is a form}} of {{computer}} memory, now obsolete, that was used on some of the earliest digital computers.

50|$|Early {{computers}} used relays, mechanical counters or <b>delay</b> <b>lines</b> for main <b>memory</b> functions. Ultrasonic <b>delay</b> <b>lines</b> {{could only}} reproduce {{data in the}} order it was written. Drum memory could be expanded at relatively low cost but efficient retrieval of memory items required knowledge of the physical layout of the drum to optimize speed. Latches built out of vacuum tube triodes, and later, out of discrete transistors, were used for smaller and faster memories such as registers. Such registers were relatively large and too costly to use for large amounts of data; generally only a few dozen or few hundred bits of such memory could be provided.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} optical buffers based on slow-light optical <b>delay</b> <b>lines.</b> The focus {{of this paper is}} on slow-light <b>delay</b> <b>lines</b> in which the group velocity is re-duced using linear processes, including electromagnetically in-duced transparency (EIT), population oscillations (POs), and microresonator-based photonic-crystal (PC) filters. We also con-sider slow-light <b>delay</b> <b>lines</b> in which the group velocity is reduced by an adiabatic process of bandwidth compression. A framework is developed for comparing these techniques and identifying fun-damental physical limitations of linear slow-light technologies. It is shown that slow-light <b>delay</b> <b>lines</b> have limited capacity and delay–bandwidth product. In principle, the group velocity in slow-light <b>delay</b> <b>lines</b> can be made to approach zero. But very slow group velocity always comes at the cost of very low bandwidth or throughput. In many applications, miniaturization of the <b>delay</b> <b>line</b> is an important consideration. For all delay-line buffers, the minimum physical size of the buffer for a given number of buffered data bits is ultimately limited by the physical size of each stored bit. We show that in slow-light optical buffers, the minimum achievable size of 1 b is approximately equal to the wavelength of light in the buffer. We also compare the capabilities and limitations of a range of delay-line buffers, investigate the impact of waveguide losses on the buffer capacity, and look at the applicability of slow-light <b>delay</b> <b>lines</b> in a number of applications.

40|$|A {{study of}} {{possible}} scenarios for modelling streamflow data from daily time series, using artificial neural networks (ANNs), is presented. Particular emphasis {{is devoted to}} the reconstruction of drought periods where water resource management and control are most critical. This paper considers two connectionist models: a feedforward multilayer perceptron (MLP) and a Jordan recurrent neural network (JNN), comparing network performance on real world data from two small catchments (192 and 69 km 2 in size) with irregular and torrential regimes. Several network configurations are tested to ensure a good combination of input features (rainfall and previous streamflow data) that capture the variability of the physical processes at work. Tapped <b>delayed</b> <b>line</b> (TDL) and <b>memory</b> effect techniques are introduced to recognize and reproduce temporal dependence. Results show a poor agreement when using TDL only, but a remarkable improvement can be obtained with JNN and its memory effect procedures, which are able to reproduce the system memory over a catchment in a more effective way. Furthermore, the IHACRES conceptual model, which relies on both rainfall and temperature input data, is introduced for comparative study. The results suggest that when good input data is unavailable, metric models perform better than conceptual ones and, in general, it is difficult to justify substantial conceptualization of complex processes...|$|R

40|$|Firstly, {{the basic}} {{theory of the}} optical {{coherence}} tomography (OCT) is reviewed. Optical <b>delay</b> <b>line</b> is one of important parts in OCT. Several types of optical <b>delay</b> <b>lines</b> which were proposed and demonstrated are briefly described including their advantages and disadvantages. In this work, a novel multiple-pass cavity optical <b>delay</b> <b>line</b> (MPC-ODL) is proposed and analyzed. The proposed <b>delay</b> <b>line</b> consists of four mirrors, one lens and one resonant scanner. In this proposed <b>delay</b> <b>line,</b> the path <b>delay</b> is obtained by scanning a tilting mirror and magnified by the multiple-pass optical cavity. Thus, for a small scanning angle, a large path delay can be obtained. This <b>delay</b> <b>line</b> is especially suitable for the OCT system that will generate the large dimension images at video rate with high resolution. However, due to multiple-pass cavity used in the proposed <b>delay</b> <b>line,</b> false interference signal may be created besides OCT signal. In {{order to reduce the}} false interference signal generation, some crucial parameters of the proposed <b>delay</b> <b>line</b> have to be carefully chosen.

40|$|Abstract — Optical queues, usually {{constructed}} by optical Switches and fiber <b>Delay</b> <b>Lines</b> (SDL), {{are the key}} elements for conflict resolution in optical packet switching. It is recently shown in [3] that several optical queues {{constructed by}} SDL elements are indeed infinite dimensional switches in time {{and they can be}} constructed by many classical constructions in the switching theory. In particular, a (unicast) flexible <b>delay</b> <b>line</b> in [3] is a discrete-time infinite-server queue that corresponds to the nonblocking switch in the switching theory, and it can be constructed either by the three-stage Clos network or the Cantor network. In this paper, we propose two new constructions for multicast flexible <b>delay</b> <b>lines</b> that use the unicast flexible <b>delay</b> <b>lines</b> as the basic construction elements. The first one is constructed by using parallel unicast flexible <b>delay</b> <b>lines.</b> It is shown that a multicast flexible <b>delay</b> <b>line</b> with maximum <b>delay</b> d can be constructed by using O (√ d) unicast flexible <b>delay</b> <b>lines</b> with maximum <b>delay</b> d. Our second construction is a recursive construction. We show that a multicast flexible <b>delay</b> <b>line</b> with maximum <b>delay</b> 2 d− 1 can be constructed by two unicast flexible <b>delay</b> <b>lines</b> with maximum <b>delay</b> d − 1 and a multicast flexible <b>delay</b> <b>line</b> with maximum <b>delay</b> d− 1.
