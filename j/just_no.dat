It's tempting, but they're not going to {{consider}} you their friend anyway. They just know that you're somebody that can do something for them. So you shouldn't really flatter yourself that they want to be your buddy. They don't... They want you for some reason or other, {{and you just have to}} fend that off all the time.

A poem by Driberg, in the style of Edith Sitwell, was published in Oxford Poetry 1926; when Sitwell came to Oxford to deliver a lecture, Driberg invited her to have tea with him, and she accepted.

500|$|The women's saw Australia beating New Zealand 24–17 in {{the first}} final of women's rugby union at the Olympic Games. New Zealand took the early lead but Australia fought back and looked the most {{dangerous}} team throughout. The New Zealand defence was brutal early. Australia [...] had the ball {{for the first two}} minutes but there was <b>just</b> <b>no</b> way through. New Zealand eventually found a way through after five minutes through Kayla McAlister. Australia almost struck back two minutes later but brutal one-on-one New Zealand defence prevented the try. Finally Australia scored in the corner. The ball looked to be grassed early and then bobble over the line without Australian player Emma Tonegato being in control. But the five points went onto the scoreboard. They went on and scored again right on halftime through Evania Pelite. Australia made an awful start to the second half, kicking the ball out on the full. But they soon recovered with tries to Ellia Green and Charlotte Caslick.|$|E

One, two, Freddy's coming for you. Three, four, we've been there before". Michael Rechtshaffen of The Hollywood Reporter criticized the acting calling it [...] "lethargically lifeless" [...] and criticized Haley's portrayal of Krueger, saying, [...] "Even with his electronically deepened voice and a pointless amount of backstory, there's <b>just</b> <b>no</b> replacing Englund". Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 1 star out of 4, writing in his review, [...] "I stared at A Nightmare on Elm Street with weary resignation. The movie consists of a series of teenagers who are introduced, haunted by nightmares and then slashed to death by Freddy. So what? Are we supposed to be scared?

500|$|The {{first season}} {{received}} generally mixed to negative reviews. Many critics said {{the series was}} too similar to The Office and its mock documentary style. In particular, several commentators said the naive and well-meaning Leslie Knope character too closely resembled The Office protagonist Michael Scott, the well-intentioned but dimwitted manager of a paper company sales office. Maureen Ryan, television reviewer for the Chicago Tribune, said Parks and Recreation surpassed the Friends spin-off Joey as the [...] "worst example of NBC's tendency to extend its franchises well beyond what is desirable or logical." [...] Daniels said of the comparisons between Leslie Knope and Michael Scott, [...] "My sense {{is that if we}} had built 'Parks and Recreation' around a 90-year-old Maasai warrior people would still have said, 'He reminds me of [...] Michael Scott'. There was <b>just</b> <b>no</b> way to escape it." [...] Poehler acknowledged that there was some validity to the comparisons, but felt that the series overcame them with the production of [...] "Rock Show": [...] "I think it was something we had to work through in the beginning, and I’m kind of hoping we’re {{on the other side of}} that and people will start to judge the show on its own, for what it is and realize it’s just a completely different world in a similar style." ...|$|E

They did not specifically mention the diaries, but referred generally to new material. They also did not give the forensic specialists an entire diary, but removed one page only. For comparison purposes they also provided the experts with other samples of Hitler's writing, a handwritten draft for a telegram: this was from Heidemann's own collection and had also been forged by Kujau. Within days Walde provided further documents for comparison—all Kujau forgeries. Walde then flew to the US and commissioned Ordway Hilton, another forensic expert. None of those involved were experts in examining Nazi documents, and Hilton could not read German. Sterns management were too bound up in a secretive approach to be open about their source, or to provide the experts with a complete diary, which would have led to a more thorough examination of wider material. From the samples provided, the experts concluded that the handwriting was genuine. Hilton subsequently reported that [...] "there was <b>just</b> <b>no</b> question" [...] that both documents he had were written by the same person, whom he assumed to be Hitler.|$|E
