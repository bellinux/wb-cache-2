Jonker arrived in Zeeland with the very first aid workers, and photographed people standing on the roofs of their homes.

[...] Higbie's comments attracted media criticism, and Representative Judy Chu (D - CA), the first Chinese American woman elected to the U.S. Congress, declared that [...] "any proposal to force American Muslims to register with the federal government, and to use Japanese imprisonment during World War II as precedent, is abhorrent and has no place in our society. These ideas are based on tactics of fear, division, and hate that we must condemn." [...] Constitutional lawyer Bruce Fein addressed Higbie's suggestion that Korematsu could be used to support a Muslim register, describing the case as having [...] "joined Dred Scott as an odious and discredited artifact of popular bigotry" [...] even though it has never been overturned. [...] Harvard University's Noah Feldman concurred, declaring that [...] "Korematsu's uniquely bad legal status means it's not precedent even though it hasn't been overturned." ...|$|E

50|$|Yourkevitch {{himself was}} in New York City on 9 February 1942 when the Normandie accidentally caught fire <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> War II eras most astounding disasters. He {{could have saved}} this ship, based mostly on his {{intimate}} knowledge of the liners ballast systems, but the NYC fire department would not call on him. They shot too much water to the wrong places and she capsized overnight. (The situation was also {{complicated by the fact}} that the ships advanced fire suppression systems had been offline and un-staffed at the time). The United States Navy would later partner with him during what was then the largest and most complicated salvage operation on a passenger liner until the advent of the Costa Concordia incident of 2013. Even after the ship was but a blistered hull with most of her superstructure gone, he strongly believed she was salvageable. President Franklin D. Roosevelt and others in the war department felt the same way, but further inspections of her innovative hull nevertheless uncovered damages and other issues in the ship and made her beyond repair according to experts. The idea of putting the former ocean liner to sea as an aircraft carrier was also shelved. The Normandies eventual scrapping in 1946 was said to have been understandably heartbreaking to Yourkevitch, as well as associated maritime architects such has William Francis Gibbs, who would soon design his own masterpiece, the SS United States in 1951, with fireproofing especially in mind.|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} of the authors is to deliver specifications and underlying concepts for future computer-aided tools for the design and the control of flexible manufacturing systems for mechanical and electro-mechanical assemblies. This book presents an integrated computer-aided method which supports a concurrent engineering approach for assembled products. This integrated method is divided in several modules which analyse the ease of assembly of a design, the assembly order, the design of an assembly workshop, and the simulation of the workshop taking into account scheduling and flow control. Automatic, semi-automatic and manual utilisations are presented for each module. Communication between design and manufacturing has been emphasised.

Most biodiversity features targeted in past conservation planning have been largely aspects of ecological and biogeographical pattern rather than process.

Spatial components were identified in a GIS using published data and expert knowledge. Options for achieving targets for process components have been seriously compromised by habitat transformation.

Pricing, as a source of competitive advantage is the least explained in marketing literature, therefore it is important to contribute and show how psychological pricing is a source of competitive advantage. It could be an evidence to support the firm belief which exists among many retailers that greater than expected demand occurs at psychological price points. We shall analyze different retail chains belonging to so call hard-discounters in Russian Federation using method of observation and choose one sector in order to check the hypothesis.

40|$|AbstractThis paper reviews an {{analysis}} on transmission of Ethnic Languages of selected cultural communities <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> Heritage Sites, Malacca. Ethnic Language {{is one of the}} most valuable Intangible Cultural Heritage recognized in UNESCO Convention of Safeguarding Intangible Cultural Heritage in 2003. Survey Questionnaires conducted with the selected cultural communities intend to determine the level of Intangible Cultural Heritage manifestation. The survey inquiries adopted five domains of Intangible Cultural Heritage recognized by UNESCO. The domains are Oral Tradition, Performing Arts, Knowledge, Social Practices and Traditional Craftsmanship. The analyses found that there are two significant factors influencing the level of Intangible Cultural Heritage manifestation as well as in transmission of Ethnic Languages. The first factor is the influence of intertwining Intangible Cultural Heritage manifestations. The second factor is the unfavorable influence of universal culture. Concurrently, the recommendations highlight on important Intangible Cultural Heritage to be enhanced in order for the threatened and declining Intangible Cultural Heritage to be safeguarded. The recommendations also generate approaches to overcome the unfavorable influence of universal culture on local culture in the attempt to safeguard Intangible Cultural Heritage as well as to improve the transmission of Ethnic Languages...|$|E
40|$|Even in the {{customer}} specific solution domain MEMS manufacturers are facing an increasing request for low cost turnkey products. Fully calibrated sensors with high performance, light weight and small dimension packages are demanded. Considering {{the cost of}} a MEMS device the silicon dice constitutes just about one third or less of the total component cost. As the silicon fabrication process has already been cost optimised by using batch fabrication, lowering the remaining more than two thirds of the component cost in testing, calibration and assembly by fully automation offers the biggest potential to meet the market requirement for cost-effective turnkey solution. This paper presents a cost-effective test, calibration and assembly infrastructure for turnkey integrated pressure sensors that has been implemented in the fabrication line of the Fraunhofer IMS for the production of barometric pressure sensor. The calibration of the sensors is performend on wafer level during the full automated standard electrical circuit test. After dicing the devices are assembled using automated cassette-to-cassette operation.

This {{has resulted in a}} series of dam safety assessment from both the government agencies and research institutions in Taiwan. This study examined the behavior of Renyi-Tan earth dam during this JiJi earthquake. A series of numerical analyses treating the dam materials to obey Finn’s model has been performed using the finite difference program FLAC. The numerical results were presented and evaluated from the viewpoint of displacement, excess pore pressure, stress path, and accelerations. The results showed that the dam was still intact during the JiJi earthquake because the generated excess pore water pressures in the dam body were only about 60 % of its effective overburden stress, which inhibited the dam from liquefaction...|$|E
