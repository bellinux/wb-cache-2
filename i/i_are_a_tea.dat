The Channel 5 newsreader told Woman and Home magazine that she was diagnosed in 2014, a week after her 50th birthday. She said she had always thought she was healthy as she [...] "did {{all the right things}} - <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> green <b>tea</b> drinker, <b>a</b> salmon eater, a runner". She said her main fear was not seeing her two youngest children grow up.|$|R

[...] "Do you think <b>I</b> <b>am</b> running <b>a</b> pink <b>tea,</b> or <b>a</b> ladies' sewing circle? I don't need anybody to help me to get up a programme; my partner, Mr. Carr, attends to that end of it. What <b>I</b> need <b>is</b> <b>a</b> strong, willing fellow to take tickets and usher folks to seats, and keep the floor free of rubbish, and all that." ...|$|R

6000|$|By a happy coincidence, just as Good King Wenceslas {{had looked}} out on the Feast of Stephen, so Mr Crimble, the curate-in-charge at St Peter's, had looked in. By his [...] "Ah, Phelps!" [...] it was evident that our guests were well acquainted with one another; and Fanny and <b>I</b> <b>were</b> soon enjoying <b>a</b> <b>tea</b> enriched by the cream of local society. Mr Crimble had mild dark eyes, gold spectacles, rather full red lips, and a voice that {{reminded}} me of raspberries. I think he had heard of me, for he was very attentive, and handled my small cup and saucer with remarkable, if rather conspicuous, ingenuity.|$|R
5000|$|Watson <b>is</b> {{frequently}} called <b>a</b> Southern writer, and acknowledges his {{heritage and}} his love for family and friends, particularly after moving to Wyoming in 2005. At community college in Meridian, he became inspired by William Faulkner, Robert Penn Warren, and Flannery O'Connor. He is praised for his portrayal of Southern issues and problems (racism and segregation {{being one of the}} subject matters of Heaven of Mercury), but commented also on stereotypical simplifications of the South in other parts of America:For all the ways South is struggling and, yes, deficient, or failing, flailing, it <b>is</b> also <b>a</b> place full of wonderful people, and possibly one of the most diverse places in the country. Not that everyone gets along. There is ignorance, there is racism. There are also more proud people trying to change that than might be apparent from the results at the polling booths. But writing the book, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> just thinking about these people, trying to make them real people in the reader’s mind. Here’s <b>an</b> anecdote, though. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> at <b>a</b> <b>tea</b> party or the like at a famous university {{in the early stages of}} researching Miss Jane, and I asked the host--who <b>was</b> <b>a</b> pediatrician, for goodness sake--if he could speculate on what might have been my great aunt’s condition. His response was, [...] "You're from Mississippi, right? Is there any history of incest in your family?" ...|$|R
6000|$|It {{was one of}} {{this same}} new and [...] "fittest" [...] species who had already {{relieved}} poor Mr. McAlery Willett of his fortune. Mr. Willett <b>was</b> <b>a</b> trusting soul who had never known {{how to take care}} of himself or his money, people said, and now that he had lost it they blamed him. Some had been saved enough for him and Nancy to live on in the old house, with careful economy. It was Nancy who managed the economy, who accomplished remarkable things with a sum they would have deemed poverty in former days. Her mother had died while <b>I</b> <b>was</b> at Cambridge. Reverses did not subdue Mr. Willett's spirits, and the fascination modern [...] "business" [...] had for him seemed to grow in proportion to the misfortunes it had caused him. He moved into a tiny office in the Durrett Building, where he appeared every morning about half-past ten to occupy himself with heaven knows what short cuts to wealth, with prospectuses of companies in Mexico or Central America or some other distant place: once, <b>I</b> remember, it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>tea,</b> company in which he tried to interest his friends, to raise in the South a product he maintained would surpass Orange Pekoe. In the afternoon between three and four he would turn up at the Boyne Club, as well groomed, as spruce as ever, generally with a flower in his buttonhole. He never forgot that he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> gentleman, and he had a gentleman's notions of the fitness of things, and it was against his principles to use, a gentleman's club for the furtherance of his various enterprises.|$|R
