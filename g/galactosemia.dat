25|$|Genetic {{studies by}} Miriam Murphy, David Croke, and other {{researchers}} identified certain genetic diseases such as <b>galactosemia</b> that are {{more common in the}} Irish Traveller population, involving identifiable allelic mutations that are rarer among the rest of the community.|$|E
25|$|Contraindications to {{breastfeeding}} {{are those}} conditions that could compromise {{the health of}} the infant if breast milk from their mother is consumed. One example of this is <b>galactosemia.</b> This is. If the mother has HIV or antiretroviral therapy, untreated active tuberculosis, human Human T-lymphotropic virus 1 or II, uses illicit drugs, or mothers undergoing chemotherapy or radiation treatment.|$|E
25|$|The {{screening}} process, however, {{is characterized}} by a high false positive rate. In one study, CAH screening had the lowest positive predictive value (111 true-positive cases among 20,647 abnormal screening results in a 2-year period, or 0.53%, compared with 6.36% for biotinidase deficiency, 1.84% for congenital hypo-thyroidism, 0.56% for classic <b>galactosemia,</b> and 2.9% for phenylketonuria). According to this estimate, 200 unaffected newborns required clinical and laboratory follow-up for every true case of CAH.|$|E
25|$|Infants with classic <b>galactosemia</b> cannot digest lactose and {{therefore}} cannot benefit from breast milk. Breastfeeding might harm the baby also {{if the mother}} has untreated pulmonary tuberculosis, is taking certain medications that suppress the immune system. has HIV, or uses potentially harmful substances such as cocaine, heroin, and amphetamines. Other than cases of acute poisoning, no environmental contaminant {{has been found to}} cause more harm to infants than lack of breastfeeding. Although heavy metals such as mercury are dispersed throughout the environment and are of concern to the nursing infant, the neurodevelopmental benefits of human milk tend to override the potential adverse effects of neurotoxicants.|$|E
2500|$|Baby {{is unable}} to breastfeed: [...] The child has a birth defect or inborn error of {{metabolism}} such as <b>galactosemia</b> that makes breastfeeding difficult or impossible.|$|E
2500|$|Metabolic (or biochemical) {{genetics}} {{involves the}} diagnosis and management of inborn errors of metabolism in which patients have enzymatic deficiencies that perturb biochemical pathways involved in metabolism of carbohydrates, amino acids, and lipids. [...] Examples of metabolic disorders include <b>galactosemia,</b> glycogen storage disease, lysosomal storage disorders, metabolic acidosis, peroxisomal disorders, phenylketonuria, and urea cycle disorders.|$|E
2500|$|Beutler {{made major}} {{contributions}} {{to the understanding of}} Tay-Sachs disease. [...] He purified the enzyme that is aberrant in this disease and demonstrated its multimeric structure. [...] His group cloned the gene responsible for Gaucher disease [...] and developed treatments for this disease, as well as diagnostic tests. [...] Beutler also developed a screening test for <b>galactosemia,</b> which is used to this day to detect the disease in neonates, and prevent its severe consequences.|$|E
2500|$|Biochemical {{studies are}} {{performed}} {{to screen for}} imbalances of metabolites in the bodily fluid, usually the blood (plasma/serum) or urine, but also in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). [...] Specific tests of enzyme function (either in leukocytes, skin fibroblasts, liver, or muscle) are also employed under certain circumstances. [...] In the US, the newborn screen incorporates biochemical tests to screen for treatable conditions such as <b>galactosemia</b> and phenylketonuria (PKU). [...] Patients suspected to have a metabolic condition might undergo the following tests: ...|$|E
2500|$|Dietary {{restriction}} and supplementation are {{key measures}} taken in several well-known metabolic disorders, including <b>galactosemia,</b> phenylketonuria (PKU), maple syrup urine disease, organic acidurias and urea cycle disorders. [...] Such restrictive diets {{can be difficult}} for the patient and family to maintain, and require close consultation with a nutritionist who has special experience in metabolic disorders. [...] The composition of the diet will change depending on the caloric needs of the growing child and special attention is needed during a pregnancy if a woman is affected with one of these disorders.|$|E
2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1948, Leloir and his team identified the sugar nucleotides that were fundamental to the metabolism of carbohydrates, turning the Instituo Campomar into a biochemistry institution well known throughout the world. Immediately thereafter, Leloir received the Argentine Scientific Society Prize, [...] {{one of the many}} awards he would receive both in Argentina and internationally. During this time, his team dedicated itself to the study of glycoproteins; Leloir and his colleagues elucidated the primary mechanisms of galactose metabolism (now coined the Leloir pathway) and determined the cause of <b>galactosemia,</b> a serious genetic disorder that resulted in lactose intolerance.|$|E
2500|$|Robert Guthrie {{is given}} {{much of the}} credit for {{pioneering}} the earliest screening for phenylketonuria in the late 1960s using blood samples obtained by pricking a newborn baby's heel {{on the second day of}} life on filter paper. Congenital hypothyroidism was the second disease widely added in the 1970s. Guthrie and colleagues also developed bacterial inhibition assays for the detection of maple syrup urine disease and classic <b>galactosemia.</b> [...] The development of tandem mass spectrometry screening in the early 1990s led to a large expansion of potentially detectable congenital metabolic diseases that can be identified by characteristic patterns of amino acids and acylcarnitines.|$|E
2500|$|Newborn {{screening}} {{is intended}} {{as a public health}} program to identify infants with treatable conditions before they present clinically, or suffer irreversible damage. [...] Phenylketonuria (PKU) was the first disorder targeted for newborn screening, being implemented in a small number of hospitals and quickly expanding across the United States {{and the rest of the}} world. [...] After the success of newborn screening for PKU (39 infants were identified and treated in the first two years of screening, with no false negative results), Guthrie and others looked for other disorders that could be identified and treated in infants, eventually developing bacterial inhibition assays to identify classic <b>galactosemia</b> and maple syrup urine disease.|$|E
2500|$|Luis Federico Leloir [...] (September 6, 1906 [...] December 2, 1987) was an Argentine {{physician}} and biochemist {{who received the}} 1970 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Although born in France, Leloir received {{the majority of his}} education at the University of Buenos Aires and was director of the private research group Fundación Instituto Campomar until his death in 1987. Although his laboratories were often plagued by lack of financial support and second-rate equipment, his research into sugar nucleotides, carbohydrate metabolism, and renal hypertension has garnered international attention and fame and has led to significant progress in understanding, diagnosing and treating the congenital disease <b>galactosemia.</b> Luis Leloir is buried in La Recoleta Cemetery, Buenos Aires.|$|E
2500|$|Because newborn {{screening}} programs test {{for a number}} of different conditions, a number of different laboratorial methodologies are used, as well as bedside testing for hearing loss using evoked auditory potentials and congenital heart defects using pulse oximetry. [...] Newborn screening started out using simple bacterial inhibition assays to screen for a single disorder, starting with phenylketonuria in the early 1960s. [...] With this testing methodology, {{newborn screening}} required one test to detect one condition. [...] As mass spectrometry became more widely available, the technology allowed rapid determination of a number of acylcarnitines and amino acids from a single dried blood spot. [...] This increased the number of conditions that could be detected by newborn screening. [...] Enzyme assays are used to screen for <b>galactosemia</b> and biotinidase deficiency. [...] Immunoassays measure thyroid hormones for the diagnosis of congenital hypothyroidism and 17α-hydroxyprogesterone for the diagnosis of congenital adrenal hyperplasia. [...] Molecular techniques are used for the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis and severe combined immunodeficiency.|$|E
50|$|Duarte <b>galactosemia</b> (also {{known as}} Duarte variant <b>galactosemia,</b> DG, or {{biochemical}} variant <b>galactosemia)</b> is an inherited condition associated with diminished ability to metabolize galactose {{due to a}} partial deficiency of the enzyme galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase. Duarte <b>galactosemia</b> (DG) is estimated to affect close to one in 4,000 infants born in the United States. DG Is considered by most healthcare professionals to be clinically mild. It differs from classic <b>galactosemia</b> in that patients with Duarte <b>galactosemia</b> have partial GALT deficiency whereas patients with classic <b>galactosemia</b> have complete, or almost complete, GALT deficiency.|$|E
50|$|The only {{treatment}} for classic <b>galactosemia</b> is eliminating lactose and galactose from the diet. Even with an early diagnosis and a restricted diet, however, some individuals with <b>galactosemia</b> experience long-term complications such as speech difficulties, learning disabilities, neurological impairment (e.g. tremors, etc.), and ovarian failure. Symptoms {{have not been}} associated with Duarte <b>galactosemia,</b> and many individuals with Duarte <b>galactosemia</b> {{do not need to}} restrict their diet at all. However, research corroborates a previously overlooked theory that Duarte <b>galactosemia</b> may lead to language developmental issues in children with no clinical symptoms. Infants with classic <b>galactosemia</b> cannot be breast-fed due to lactose in human breast milk and are usually fed a soy-based formula.|$|E
50|$|Duarte <b>galactosemia</b> is a milder form of {{classical}} <b>galactosemia</b> and usually has no long term side effects.|$|E
50|$|Galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase deficiency, {{also called}} <b>{{galactose}}mia</b> type 1, classic <b>galactosemia</b> or GALT deficiency, {{is the most}} common type of <b>galactosemia,</b> an inborn error of galactose metabolism, caused by a deficiency of the enzyme galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase. It is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder that can cause liver disease and death if untreated. Treatment of <b>galactosemia</b> is most successful if initiated early and includes dietary restriction of lactose intake. Because early intervention is key, <b>galactosemia</b> is included in newborn screening programs in many areas. On initial screening, which often involves measuring the concentration of galactose in blood, classic <b>galactosemia</b> may be indistinguishable from other inborn errors of galactose metabolism, including galactokinase deficiency and galactose epimerase deficiency. Further analysis of metabolites and enzyme activities are needed to identify the specific metabolic error.|$|E
50|$|Most {{infants with}} DG who are {{detected}} by NBS have their diagnosis confirmed {{in a follow-up}} evaluation. The differential diagnosis of a positive newborn screen for <b>galactosemia</b> includes: classic <b>galactosemia,</b> clinical variant <b>galactosemia,</b> DG, GALE (epimerase) deficiency, GALK (galactokinase) deficiency, or an initial false positive result. There are also other rare conditions, such as portosystemic venous shunting and hepatic arteriovenous malformations, or Fanconi-Bickel Syndrome (GSDXI) {{that can lead to}} elevated blood galactose or urinary galactitol, triggering an initial suspicion of <b>galactosemia.</b>|$|E
50|$|Galactose epimerase deficiency, {{also known}} as GALE deficiency, <b>Galactosemia</b> III and UDP-galactose-4-epimerase deficiency, is a rare, {{autosomal}} recessive form of <b>galactosemia</b> associated with a deficiency of the enzyme galactose epimerase.|$|E
50|$|Infants are {{routinely}} screened for <b>galactosemia</b> in the United States, and {{the diagnosis is}} made while the person is still an infant. Infants affected by <b>galactosemia</b> typically present with symptoms of lethargy, vomiting, diarrhea, failure to thrive, and jaundice. None of these symptoms are specific to <b>galactosemia,</b> often leading to diagnostic delays. Luckily, most infants are diagnosed on newborn screening. If {{the family of the}} baby has a history of <b>galactosemia,</b> doctors can test prior to birth by taking a sample of fluid from around the fetus (amniocentesis) or from the placenta (chorionic villus sampling or CVS).|$|E
50|$|Various human GALE {{mutations}} {{resulting in}} Type III <b>galactosemia</b> have been identified. Functional {{analysis of these}} mutant GALE isoforms suggests that reduced catalytic efficiency and increased likelihood of proteolytic digestion act causatively in Type III <b>galactosemia.</b>|$|E
50|$|In humans, <b>galactosemia</b> is a {{disorder}} {{that affects the}} development of newborns and children as they cannot metabolize the sugar galactose properly. It is speculated that overexpression of UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase may relieve symptoms in humans with <b>galactosemia.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Galactosemia</b> (British galactosaemia) {{is a rare}} genetic {{metabolic}} disorder that affects an individual's ability to metabolize the sugar galactose properly. <b>Galactosemia</b> follows an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance that confers a deficiency in an enzyme responsible for adequate galactose degradation.|$|E
50|$|<b>Galactosemia</b> is {{inherited}} in an {{autosomal recessive}} manner, meaning a child must inherit one defective gene from each parent {{to show the}} disease. Heterozygotes are carriers, because they inherit one normal gene & one defective gene. Carriers show no symptoms of <b>galactosemia.</b>|$|E
50|$|Lactose in food (such as dairy products) {{is broken}} down by the enzyme lactase into glucose and galactose. In {{individuals}} with <b>galactosemia,</b> the enzymes needed for further metabolism of galactose are severely diminished or missing entirely, leading to toxic levels of galactose 1-phosphate in various tissues {{as in the case}} of classic <b>galactosemia,</b> resulting in hepatomegaly (an enlarged liver), cirrhosis, renal failure, cataracts, vomiting, seizure, hypoglycemia, lethargy, brain damage, and ovarian failure. Without treatment, mortality in infants with <b>galactosemia</b> is about 75%.|$|E
5000|$|Not all NBS {{tests for}} <b>galactosemia</b> are {{designed}} to detect DG so affected infants born in one location may be detected while those born in another may not. For example, all states in the US screen for classic <b>galactosemia</b> in their NBS panel, but some states have lower GALT enzyme activity cut-off levels than others. NBS in states with a low GALT cut off level still detects classic <b>galactosemia</b> and helps to minimize false positives, {{but it can also}} result in [...] "missed" [...] DG diagnoses for those samples with partial GALT enzyme activity that is above the cut-off. In those states, a NBS result for <b>galactosemia</b> designated as [...] "normal" [...] may not be informative about an infant's DG status.|$|E
50|$|The {{expression}} of GALT {{is controlled by}} the actions of the FOXO3 gene. The absence of this enzyme results in classic <b>galactosemia</b> in humans and can be fatal in the newborn period if lactose is not removed from the diet. The pathophysiology of <b>galactosemia</b> has not been clearly defined.|$|E
50|$|Studies of Type III <b>galactosemia</b> {{symptoms}} are mostly descriptive, and precise pathogenic mechanisms remain unknown. This is {{largely due to}} a lack of functional animal models of classic <b>galactosemia.</b> The recent development of a Drosophila melanogaster GALE mutant exhibiting galactosemic symptoms may yield a promising future animal model.|$|E
50|$|An {{impairment}} or {{deficiency in}} the enzyme, galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase (GALT), results in classic <b>galactosemia,</b> or Type I <b>galactosemia.</b> Classic <b>galactosemia</b> {{is a rare}} (1 in 47,000 live births), autosomal recessive disease that presents with symptoms soon after birth when a baby begins lactose ingestion. Symptoms include life-threatening illnesses such as jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly (enlarged spleen and liver), hypoglycemia, renal tubular dysfunction, muscle hypotonia (decreased tone and muscle strength), sepsis (presence of harmful bacteria and their toxins in tissues), and cataract among others. The prevalence of cataract among classic galactosemics is markedly less than among galactokinase-deficient patients due to the extremely high levels of galactitol found in the latter. Classic <b>galactosemia</b> patients typically exhibit urinary galactitol levels of only 98 to 800 mmol/mol creatine compared to normal levels of 2 to 78 mmol/mol creatine.|$|E
50|$|Individuals {{presenting}} with Type III <b>galactosemia</b> must {{consume a}} lactose- and galactose-restricted diet devoid of dairy products and mucilaginous plants. Dietary restriction {{is the only}} current treatment available for GALE deficiency. As glycoprotein and glycolipid metabolism generate endogenous galactose, however, Type III <b>galactosemia</b> may not be resolved solely through dietary restriction.|$|E

50|$|<b>Galactosemia</b> is {{normally}} first detected through newborn screening, or NBS. Affected children can have serious, irreversible effects or even die within days from birth. It {{is important that}} newborns be screened for metabolic disorders without delay. <b>Galactosemia</b> can even be detected through NBS before any ingestion of galactose-containing formula or breast milk.|$|E
50|$|<b>Galactosemia</b> {{is caused}} by {{mutations}} in the gene that makes the enzyme galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase. Approximately 70% of galactosemia-causing alleles have a single missense mutation in exon 6. A milder form of <b>galactosemia,</b> called Galactokinase deficiency, is caused a lack of the enzyme uridine diphosphate galactose-4-epimerase which breaks down a byproduct of galactose. This type of is associated with cataracts, but does not cause growth failure, mental retardation, or hepatic disease. Dietary reduction of galactose is also the treatment but not as severe as in patients with classical <b>galactosemia.</b> This deficiency can be systemic or limited to red blood cells and leukocytes.|$|E
