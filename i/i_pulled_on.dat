60|$|Wondering {{what was}} up <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>on</b> my {{clothing}} and made my way aft. The captain was in the cabin alone.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>on</b> the rope, {{and found}} the grapnel had caught. I hung with my whole weight on it, but it held splendidly.|$|E

60|$|I {{tried to}} reassure her, and {{to make light of}} the whole affair. I said that the fact evidently was that I was not rowing as fast as I fancied I was, but that we should soon reach the lock now; and <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>on</b> for another mile.|$|E
6000|$|All that I knew at this {{shock of}} waking was that {{something}} was happening above. As <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>on</b> my steaming mittens and hurried my best up the reeling stairs, I could hear the stamp of men's feet that for once were not lagging. In the chart-house hall I heard Mr. Pike, who had already covered {{the length of the}} bridge from the for'ard-house, shouting: ...|$|E
60|$|I swung this hook {{cautiously}} to {{the roof}} several times before it finally found lodgment; gently <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>on</b> it to strengthen its hold, but whether it would bear the weight of my body I did not know. It might be barely caught upon the very outer verge of the roof, so that as my body swung {{out at the end}} of the strap it would slip off and launch me to the pavement a thousand feet below.|$|E
50|$|I plunged {{full speed}} towards the valley. According to Henri Desgrange's calculation, I was then heading the general {{classification}} with a lead of 18 minutes. So, I was going full speed. All of a sudden, about ten kilometres from Ste-Marie-de-Campan {{down in the}} valley, I feel {{that something is wrong}} with my handlebars. I cannot steer my bike any more. <b>I</b> <b>pull</b> <b>on</b> my brakes and I stop. I see my forks are broken. Well, I tell you now that my forks were broken but I wouldn't say it at the time because it was bad publicity for my sponsor.|$|R
6000|$|... "At {{any rate}} they don't extend it to----" [...] <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> up <b>on</b> the word. He had the upper hand, but I {{could at least}} play the game out with decency.

60|$|I {{thought this}} {{better and better}} still, and as <b>I</b> began to <b>pull</b> <b>on</b> my hose, recalling the man's impudent mendicancy at Prestongrange's, I {{determined}} to pursue {{what seemed to be}} my victory.|$|R
60|$|Towards dusk I noticed {{suddenly}} {{that the top}} of the old stub looked a bit peculiar, but it was some time before I made out a big owl sitting up there. I had no idea how long he had been there, nor whence he came. His back was towards me; he sat up very straight and still, so as to make himself just a piece, the tip end, of the stub. As I watched, he hooted once and bent forward to listen. Then <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>on</b> my string.|$|E
6000|$|... "'I {{have said}} that the house is a {{rambling}} one. One day last week--on Thursday night, to be more exact--I found that I could not sleep, having foolishly taken a cup of strong café noir after my dinner. After struggling against it until two in the morning, I felt that it was quite hopeless, so I rose and lit the candle with the intention of continuing a novel which I was reading. The book, however, had been left in the billiard-room, so <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>on</b> my dressing-gown and started off to get it.|$|E
6000|$|I {{was about}} to shout, but, on second thoughts, decided to keep quiet; yet I {{instantly}} {{made up my mind}} that, if I didn't see or hear from him pretty soon, I would run around to the gate and bang up the people inside. However, it was not necessary for me to trouble myself, for, in a minute, the rope came down again, and I took hold of it. <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>on</b> it and found it all firm, and then I went up. I climbed up pretty fast, and two or three times I felt a tug, as if somebody above was trying to pull me up. But it was of no use, for I was a great deal stouter and heavier than Rectus, who was a light, slim boy. But as I neared the top, a hand came down and clutched me by the collar, and some one, with a powerful arm and grip, helped me {{over the top of the}} wall. There stood Rectus, all right, and the fellow who had helped us up was the big Indian, [...] "Maiden's Heart." ...|$|E

5000|$|After {{travelling}} to the UK, Galloway {{said that}} he intended to represent Scotland in 2016 Four Nations, and {{would have liked to have}} played for them in the past if not for injuries.

60|$|He {{extended}} his hand, smiling, and I delivered mine into {{it without a}} moment's hesitation, and when his fingers closed about it to assist me to my feet the consciousness that it trembled made me blush worse than the red west. I got up, however, and after a while, observing {{that he had not}} let go my hand <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>on</b> it a little, but unsuccessfully. He simply held on, saying nothing, but looking down into my face with some kind of smile--I didn't know--how could I?--whether it was affectionate, derisive, or what, for I did not look at him. How beautiful he was!-- with the red fires of the sunset burning in the depths of his eyes. Do you know, dear, if the Thugs and Experts of the Blavatsky region have any special kind of eyes? Ah, you should have seen his superb attitude, the god-like inclination of his head as he stood over me after I had got upon my feet! It was a noble picture, but I soon destroyed it, for I began at once to sink again to the earth. There was only one thing for him to do, and he did it; he supported me with an arm about my waist.|$|E

5000|$|... “17 January {{was a heavy}} day for me. The {{radar station}} picked up the {{approach}} {{of a group of}} ground attack aircraft on their way to Anju. Our regiment was sent out to repulse them. Arriving in the area of combat operations, we just spotted the last group of Thunderjets sliding along above the clouds to our south. Vishnyakov went to go after them, but {{we were not able to}} attack as the Thunderjets went into a cloud and we found ourselves over the coastline. Not seeing the usual Sabre escort, we made a left turn and began a level climb and had just turned around when I spotted two groups of Sabres diving down to attack Vishnyakov. We were engaging under the most unfavorable conditions, but nevertheless we beat off the first attack of the Sabres and, by using maneuver, climbed back up to about 9000 meters. At that moment another group of Sabres showed up, and moved to come down to attack the regimental commander’s group from above. As for me, as I virtually had no speed due to the climb, managed to increase my climb angle and at 600 meters I opened fire on the Sabre group leader. His aircraft ran through my tracers, and I saw several explosions on it. He increased his dive and angle and headed down. Turning around, I saw that my group was also being attacked from above by a group of Sabres. I gave the command: “Everybody break!” and we turned under the Sabres, but now I saw that my rear wingman, Senior Lieutenant Voronoy, was being fired on by two Sabres. Voronoy went into a sharp dive and headed down. I returned to the battle. At that moment my third pair came under attack from two Sabres coming down from above which, as they opened fire, cut through them and headed out directly towards above me. I followed them, firing at the wingman. He, evidently damaged, turned and banked over into a dive. I was not able to go after the damaged aircraft, as I suddenly felt a sharp blow and the aircraft around me began to rapidly spin. I kicked hard left rudder, but the controls did not respond. It was so sudden that one wing suddenly broke off. I made the decision to bail out of the uncontrollable aircraft, as it was now in a vertical spin downward. With a great deal of difficulty - as I was rammed into the left side of the aircraft - I managed to get my hand on the ejection seat control lever and pull it. A sharp blow momentarily pressed down on my eyes, so I have no idea how I flew out of the aircraft. As I came back to life I was falling together with the seat, I released the harness and kicked out of the seat with my legs. I could see that the clouds below me were coming up rapidly, so <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>on</b> the parachute ripcord ring, and after I yanked it the canopy opened. I came to a sharp halt, and now I was floating under the parachute. Above me was the blue sky, below me the clouds. They were about 800 meters below. I glanced around and saw a Sabre coming at me very quickly. He came on for a few more seconds, and suddenly I saw the smoke and tracers that he was firing his six machine guns. Death was coming for me, and all I could do was wait as he came after me. Fortunately, the Sabre was about 800-1000 meters away, and the tracers flew by tens of meters below me. But for those very few seconds the tracers began to head up towards my legs and only stopped a few meters away.Perhaps at the last second I could pull my legs up at the moment that I felt the bullets were about to hit my legs. But at that precise moment the tracers stopped. I could see the Sabre bank away sharply when 500 meters away, and passing about 50 meters away from me, make a quick turn. I got nauseous from his jet exhaust as he passed. I saw the Sabre make another turn and come back to attack me again. Now I understood that he wanted to get even for the death of his leader, but then I didn’t want to think about that so silently waited for the end to come. The second time, I thought, he won’t miss.I looked down. The cloud was now much closer - perhaps 50-100 meters away. I thought: ‘What will happen first - will I go into the cloud or will his tracers hit me? If the Sabre opens fire, he won’t miss.’ But when the Sabre closed to 800 meters and new tracers flew from it, I poked into the cloud. It immediately became quite dark, humid, but it was a beautiful sensation that I was safe, as he could not see me and I did not see the approaching Sabre and his tracers." ...|$|E

2500|$|I was {{returning}} {{from high school}} one day and a runaway horse with a bridle on sped past {{a group of us}} into a farmer's yard looking for a drink of water. The horse was perspiring heavily. And the farmer didn't recognize it so we cornered it. I hopped on the horse's back. Since it had a bridle on, I took hold of the tick rein and said, [...] "Giddy-up." [...] Headed for the highway, I knew the horse would turn in the right direction. I didn't know what the right direction was. And the horse trotted and galloped along. Now and then he would forget he was on the highway and start into a field. So <b>I</b> would <b>pull</b> <b>on</b> him a bit and call his attention to the fact the highway was where he was supposed to be. And finally, about four miles from where I had boarded him, he turned into a farm yard and the farmer said, [...] "So that's how that critter came back. Where did you find him?"

50|$|A typical dogfight is {{described}} by an unnamed pilot,Pulling up into his blind spot I watched his plane grow larger and larger in my sight. But this German pilot was not content to fly straight and level. Before I could open fire his plane slewed to the right, and seeing me on his tail, he jerked back on the stick into the only defensive maneuver his plane could make. I banked my 47 over {{to the right and}} <b>pulled</b> back <b>on</b> the stick, striving to get him once more into my ring sight. The violent maneuver applied terrific G’s to my body, and I started to black out as the blood rushed from my head.

Just a little more and I’ll have him. Pressing the trigger I waited expectantly for the 109 to explode. I’ve hit his wing. A section two-feet long broke loose from the right wing as the machine gun cut like a machete through it. Too low, a little more rudder and the bullets will find his cockpit. I could see occasional strikes further up the wing, but it was too late. The 109, sensing that I was inside him on the turn, slunk into a nearby cloud. Straightening my plane, I climbed {{over the top of the}} bank, and poised on the other side, waiting for him to appear. But the 109 did not appear, and not wishing to tempt the gods of fate further, I pushed my stick forward, entered the protective cover of the clouds, and headed home.|$|R
