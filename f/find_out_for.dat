Jack and Georgina Sparks (Michelle Trachtenberg) deal with the arrangements of Chuck and Blair's wedding. Before the ceremony, Serena and Blair have a conversation over why she is still talking to Dan after he published a negative chapter about her a few weeks ago. Overhearing their conversation, Dan leaves and gives to Nate his final chapter, which is about Gossip Girl. Blair and Chuck are married by Cyrus (Wallace Shawn) and right after, the police arrive to question them.

Various characters react over the Gossip Girl reveal, including Vanessa (Jessica Szohr), Juliet (Katie Cassidy), Agnes (Willa Holland) and Lola (Ella Rae Peck), as well as Mayor Michael Bloomberg.

500|$|Upon {{arrival at}} the main camp, they were given {{provisional}} bunks in the SS barracks, warmly greeted by fellow SS men and provided with food. Gröning {{was surprised at the}} myriad food items available in addition to basic SS rations. The new arrivals were curious about what function Auschwitz served. They were told that they should <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> themselves because Auschwitz was a special kind of concentration camp.

500|$|Following the two {{accidents}} in 1997, astronaut Jerry Linenger {{felt that the}} Russian authorities attempted a cover-up to downplay {{the significance of the}} incidents, fearing that the Americans would back out of the partnership. A large part of this [...] "cover-up" [...] was the seeming impression that the American astronauts were not in fact [...] "partners" [...] aboard the station, but were instead [...] "guests". NASA staff did not <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> several hours about the fire and collision and found themselves kept out of decision-making processes. NASA became more involved when Russian mission controllers intended to place blame for the accident entirely on Vasily Tsibliyev. It was only after the application of significant pressure from NASA that this stance was changed.|$|E
500|$|In [...] "Mommy Dearest", it is {{discovered}} {{that there is a}} possibility Crowley may have faked his death and might still be alive; suggesting that perhaps Castiel had burned the wrong bones by mistake. Eve reveals this to Sam and Dean when they try to hunt her down. During the hunt, Eve is able to suppress Castiel's powers as she is older than him. After Dean kills Eve, Castiel's powers return and he kills all of her monsters with a blast of white light before transporting the group to the home of the uncle of two young boys who were turned into monsters. There, they find them dead, having been killed by demons, and Castiel promises to look into Crowley's possible survival to <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> sure if he's dead or not. However, Castiel is instead seen with a very alive Crowley who states that he is [...] "tired of cleaning up after [...] messes", implying that Castiel had full knowledge of burning the wrong bones and that both he and Crowley have some sort of agreement between them and/or may be working together as partners.|$|E

After being asked questions by Carlito concerning his daughter Brooke, Hogan attacked Carlito.
