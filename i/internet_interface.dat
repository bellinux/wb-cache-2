The technical approach involves real-time transmission of chief-complaint data as Health Level 7 messages from hospitals to a regional data center, where a Bayesian text classifier assigns each chief complaint to one of eight syndrome categories. Time-series algorithms analyze the syndrome data and generate alerts. Authorized public health users review the syndrome data by using <b>Internet</b> <b>interfaces</b> with timelines and maps. Deployments in Pennsylvania, Utah, Atlantic City, and Ohio have demonstrated feasibility of real-time collection of chief complaints. Retrospective experiments that measured case-classification accuracy demonstrated that the Bayesian classifier can discriminate between different syndrome presentations. Retrospective experiments that measured outbreak-detection accuracy determined that the classifier’s performance was adequate to support accurate and timely detection of seasonal disease outbreaks. Prospective evaluation revealed that a cluster of carbon monoxide exposures was detected by RODS within 4 hours of the presentation of the first case to an emergency department...|$|R
