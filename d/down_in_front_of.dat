5|$|One {{recorded}} case of courtship behavior involving curve-billed thrashers describes two males attacking {{each other}} vigorously and resorting to purring and hissings sounds when neither bird appeared to relent. The two males then puffed up their chests and strutted up and <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the female. They continued to alternate between purr and hiss and fighting one another until one triumphed. The victor flew towards the female and both chirped melodically before copulation.|$|E
5|$|The male {{chooses the}} nest site, and uses {{it for his}} {{courtship}} display, spending much time calling nearby. When a female comes near a male at his nest the male begins to display by raising his head, drooping his wings, pushing his chest forward, and lowering his tail. He then bows up and <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the female, who will lunge and then fly away if unreceptive. Both sexes take part in building the nest, which consists of a loose, untidy bunch of dry grass which fills the nesting cavity, lined with fur and feathers for warmth.|$|E
5|$|Moving {{south along}} the Logging Trail, between 11 and 17 March troops from the Magata Unit {{attacked}} the positions occupied by the US 129th Infantry Regiment {{in the vicinity of}} Cox's and Taylor's Creeks east of the Numa Numa Trail in the 37th Division's sector. Following the commencement of the Japanese counterattack in the central and southern sectors on 8/9March, the northern perimeter came under bombardment from Japanese indirect fire and there were several small scale actions between US and Japanese patrols; however, there were initially no major engagements fought in the sector. On 11March, the main elements of the Magata Unit concentrated around their assembly area on Mount Nampei in preparation for an assault. As they began advancing south-west, the US outposts were withdrawn and heavy barrages of fire were laid <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the American positions. By early evening the two forces were engaged in a heavy exchange of fire along the Logging Trail, which lasted until darkness had fallen. Throughout the night, small parties of Japanese troops attempted to infiltrate the American positions, cutting the wire in several places and successfully capturing a number of pillboxes around the junction of Taylor's Creek and the Logging Trail, as well as several more further to the east.|$|E

50|$|The Ten Broek - Mollie McCarty match {{race was}} a match race on July 4, 1878 between Ten Broeck, a {{stallion}} from Kentucky, and Mollie McCarty, a mare from California.

Both horses were champions of the period, and the win by Ten Broeck marked the first loss of Mollie McCarty's career. The race was immortalized in the folk song, Molly and Tenbrooks.|$|R
5|$|Quatre Bras was a hamlet at a {{strategic}} crossroads {{on the road}} to Brussels. French control of it would not only threaten the city, but divide Wellington's allied army from Blucher's Prussians. At 14:00 on 16 June 1815, after some initial skirmishing, the main French force under Marshall Ney, approached Quatre Bras from the south. They came up against the 2nd Netherlands Division who had formed a line well in advance of the crossroads. Facing three French infantry divisions and a cavalry brigade, the Dutch and Nassau troops were forced back but did not break. Reinforcements arrived at 15:00, being a Dutch cavalry brigade, Picton's 5th British Division, followed closely by the Brunswick Corps. The sharpshooters of the Brunswick Advance Guard regiment were sent to support Dutch skirmishers in Bossou Wood on the allied right (western) flank; the rest of the corps took up a reserve position across the Brussels road. The Duke reassured his inexperienced troops by walking up and <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> them, calmly puffing on his pipe.|$|E

Once they had stopped the Ottoman advance, Delamain ordered a bayonet charge that threw Ottoman reserves into retreat.

Jackson also described shooting as like organizing an army, with 2,400 people involved at the height of production. Due to the remoteness of some of New Zealand's untamed landscapes, the crew would also bring survival kits in case helicopters couldn't reach the location to bring them home in time.|$|E
