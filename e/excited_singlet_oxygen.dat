40|$|Carotenoids act as {{potential}} antioxidants, quenching energy of <b>excited</b> <b>singlet</b> <b>oxygen</b> and scavenging free radicals. Among microalgae, Haematococcus, Chlamydomonas, Chlorella, Dunaliella and diatoms and dinoflagellates, such as Phaeodactylum and Isochrysis, {{are able to}} synthesize large amount of carotenoids. The main function of carotenoids consists in absorbing light to perform photosynthesis, {{and some of them}} are constitutively present in the cells (primary carotenoids). The main primary carotenoids usually found are neoxanthin, violaxanthin, lutein, and ?-carotene. To preserve cells from oxidative damage, their production may be increased, while other carotenoids may be synthesized de novo. In particular, under stress conditions such as high light exposure, nutrient starvation, change in oxygen partial pressure, and high or low temperatures, microalgal metabolism is altered and photosynthetic activity may be reduced. In these conditions, photosynthetic electrons transport is reduced, and the intracellular reduction level increase may be associated with the formation of free radicals and species containing singlet oxygen. In order to prevent damage from photooxidation, microalgae are able to adopt strategies to contrast these dangerous oxidant molecules. One of the most active mechanisms is to synthesize large amount of carotenoids, which can act as antioxidants...|$|E

40|$|Porphyrias are {{a family}} of {{inherited}} diseases, each associated with a partial defect {{in one of the}} enzymes of the heme biosynthetic pathway. In six of the eight porphyrias described, the main clinical manifestation is skin photosensitivity brought about by the action of light on porphyrins, which are deposited in the upper epidermal layer of the skin. Porphyrins absorb light energy intensively in the UV region, {{and to a lesser extent}} in the long visible bands, resulting in transitions to excited electronic states. The excited porphyrin may react directly with biological structures (type I reactions) or with molecular oxygen, generating <b>excited</b> <b>singlet</b> <b>oxygen</b> (type II reactions). Besides this well-known photodynamic action of porphyrins, a novel light-independent effect of porphyrins has been described. Irradiation of enzymes in the presence of porphyrins mainly induces type I reactions, although type II reactions could also occur, further increasing the direct non-photodynamic effect of porphyrins on proteins and macromolecules. Conformational changes of protein structure are induced by porphyrins in the dark or under UV light, resulting in reduced enzyme activity and increased proteolytic susceptibility. The effect of porphyrins depends not only on their physico-chemical properties but also on the specific site on the protein on which they act. Porphyrin action alters the functionality of the enzymes of the heme biosynthetic pathway exacerbating the metabolic deficiencies in porphyrias. Light energy absorption by porphyrins results in the generation of oxygen reactive species, overcoming the protective cellular mechanisms and leading to molecular, cell and tissue damage, thus amplifying the porphyric picture...|$|E

The rate constants, kq, for quenching in acetonitrile of the 3 MLCT states of these ruthenium complex ions by molecular oxygen, O 2 (3 ∑g-), and the variations in the efficiency, fΔT, with which <b>excited</b> <b>singlet</b> <b>oxygen,</b> O 2 *(1 Δg), is thereby produced are reported. The quenching rate constants are in the range 2. 2 - 4. 2 × 109 dm 3 mol- 1 s- 1, and efficiencies of singlet oxygen production are in the range 0. 21 - 0. 74. Those complexes with the highest values of kq tend to be those with lowest fΔT values; that is, kq and fΔT show a reasonable inverse correlation. The product kqfΔT gives the rate constant for oxygen quenching with energy transfer to oxygen, kq 1, and kq - kq 1 gives the rate constant, kq 3, for oxygen quenching by any path which does not lead to energy transfer. The values of kq 1, kq 3, and kq are compared with those in the literature which are mainly available for organic sensitizers of singlet oxygen. The similarities and differences between these two classes of compounds are discussed taking into account the fact that ruthenium complex ions are likely to show enhanced intersystem crossing, due to the heavy atom effect and the likely dependence of kq 1 and kq 3, and thereby the efficiencies of singlet oxygen production, on the energies of the excited 3 MLCT states and on steric factors...|$|E

The resulting SiO 2 /SiC structures {{were characterized by}} a non-contact corona-voltage metrology technique in order to extract capacitance-voltage information, to facilitate further analysis of the afterglow oxidation growth mechanism, and to determine the electrical behavior of defects. In addition, mass spectrometry experiments revealed the concentration of nitric oxide species in the afterglow reactor gas exhaust produced by the cracking of N 2 O molecules in the microwave plasma discharge. Oxidations were performed on n- and p-doped epitaxial 4 H-SiC wafers at growth temperatures between 700 Â°C and 1100 Â°C. The afterglow oxidation process {{was determined to be}} primarily in the parabolic growth regime, and thus rate-limited by diffusion processes. Analysis of the parabolic growth rate temperature dependence revealed a break in activation energy between 0. 46 eV and 1. 51 eV at lower and higher temperature ranges, indicating a change in the dominating oxidation mechanism. In the proposed transport-limited mechanism, afterglow oxidation was suggested to be rate-limited by parallel diffusion of atomic oxygen radicals and <b>excited</b> <b>singlet</b> <b>oxygen</b> molecules to the SiO 2 /SiC interface. An alternative stress-relief mechanism suggested that viscous flow of SiO 2 could relieve compressive stress in the oxide above 960 Â°C. In this case, growth would be stress-limited at low temperatures and diffusion-limited at higher temperatures. Regardless of the exact mechanism or temperature range, the data developed in this work suggest that afterglow oxidation rates of 4 H-SiC are faster than atmospheric growth rates mainly because significant quantities of atomic and excited oxygen are generated in the microwave discharge independent of temperature. Using flatband voltages and accumulation capacitance values extracted from C-V measurements, worst-case charge densities associated with the oxide-semiconductor interfacial region were estimated. The charged defects were found to exist in the 1012 /cm 2 range regardless of growth temperature or oxide thickness. The charged defects were attributed to interface traps which capture majority carriers while the SiC is electrically stressed into accumulation during measurement. It was suggested that the traps failed to emit their charges within the time of measurement, even when the semiconductor was swept into depletion, and thus caused a shift in the observed flatband voltage. Mass spectrometry analysis showed that no thermal cracking of gas species occurs in the furnace at the detection level of the measurement, but rather significant quantities of nitric oxide are produced by the cracking of N 2 O molecules in the microwave plasma discharge independent of furnace temperature...|$|E

Possible mechanisms for the production of the excited species were studied in the laboratory. The reactions were carried out in time resolved flow systems and the species observed by their optical emission with the aid of photomultipliers and photo conductors in conjunction with phase sensitive detection circuitry. The ultra violet photolysis of ozone with λ = 253. 7 nm was studied as a source of O 2 (1 Σg +) and O 2 (1 Δg). O 2 (1 Δg) was observed in the photolysis of ozone-oxygen mixtures with λ = 253. 7 nm and its production was attributed to the energy transfer process: O(1 D) + O 2 (3 Σg -) → O(3 P) + O 2 (1 Δg). O 2 (1 Σg +) was observed in a system involving the photolysis of oxygen with λ = 147 nm by an analogous reaction: O(1 D) + O 2 (3 Σg -) → O(3 P) + O 2 (1 Σg +) The atom recombination reaction: O(3 P) + O(3 P) + M → O 2 (singlet) + M and the chemi luminescent reaction: NO + O 3 → NO 2 + O 2 + hν were studied but found not to produce significant quantities of excited molecular oxygen.

Photolysis of these macrocycles showed two processes; -reduction of the dye and photobleaching, which leads to the disintegration of the conjugated chromophore structure of the dye. Photobleaching is the reductive quenching of the excited state of the sensitizers. The intensity of the quenching decreased progressively from tmtppa, tppa to pc metal complexes with photobleaching quantum yields, 6. 6 x 10. 5 ⁻¹, 1. 8 x 10. 5 ⁻¹ and 5. 4 x 10 ⁻⁶ for Zntmtppa, Zntppa and Znpc, respectively. Efficiency of <b>singlet</b> <b>oxygen</b> sensitization is solvent dependent with very different values obtained for the same compound in different solvents, for example, 0. 25 and 0. 38 were observed as <b>singlet</b> <b>oxygen</b> quantum yields for Gepc complex in DMSO and DMF respectively. In DMSO the efficiency of ¹O₂ generation decrease considerably from pc to tppa and finally tmtppa. In water Getmtppa exhibits much higher <b>singlet</b> <b>oxygen</b> quantum yield, hence promising to be effective as a sensitizer for photodynamic therapy...|$|R
40|$|The {{efficiency}} {{with which}} a conjugated porphyrin dimer photosensitizes <b>singlet</b> <b>oxygen</b> production {{is shown to}} depend on the excitation wavelength, particularly in a viscous medium. This unprecedented behavior reflects viscosity-dependent dynamics that serve to interconvert two <b>excited</b> <b>singlet</b> state conformations of the porphyrin dimer. The efficiency of intersystem crossing from the two singlet state conformations to a common triplet state is shown to be different. In a viscous medium, each excited state conformation can be prepared selectively. Hence, wavelength-specific irradiation of the porphyrin allows fine control over the concentration of the triplet state produced which, in turn, is reflected in the photosensitized yield of <b>singlet</b> <b>oxygen.</b> This property may be beneficial for many applications requiring the controlled release of an oxidizing species, e. g., microfabrication and singlet oxygen-mediated cell death...|$|R
40|$|Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is used {{to treat}} cancer, and {{involves}} a highly conjugated molecule, called a photosensitizer (PS), which is excited by wavelengths of light from visible to infrared. Photosensitizers that are highly conjugated will absorb longer wavelengths (600 – 900 nm), and {{have the potential to}} destroy cells of deeper tissue cancers. In PDT, a PS is administered to the patient, and after an appropriate time delay, the tissue is then exposed to light of a specific wavelength necessary for excitation of the PS. A transfer of energy can take place between the excited PS and oxygen that is nearby. This process allows the PS to relax back to the ground state, while creating an <b>excited</b> <b>singlet</b> state <b>oxygen</b> molecule (1 O 2). Buchwald-Hartwig conditions using Pd catalysts and phosphorus containing ligands can be utilized to synthesize the photosensitizer. The reaction involves a Pd-catalyzed cross coupling of an aryl halide with a nitrogen nucleophile to form a new carbon-nitrogen bond. The PS will be PEGylated with an amine–PEG–Folate complex. Since many tumors over-express folate receptors, the PS–PEG–FA complex will be transported to cancer cells via receptor mediated endocytosis, providing greater selectivity. The killing efficiency of the PS will be tested using HeLa cells. Solutions containing PS only, PS–PEG–FA, and media only will be added to cancer cells with folate restricted media. After exposure to light, the cells will be counted to determine the percentage of cells killed by the <b>singlet</b> <b>oxygen</b> and other radical species. Variables that must be controlled in this study are the following: length of time cells have been growing; specific concentration of PS–PEG–folate complex; length of time for PS–PEG–folate complex uptake into the cell; length of time of exposure to light; length of time from light exposure to cell counting to determine necrosis. The goal of the research is to determine the concentration of PS and length of time of light exposure that is maximally effective for killing tumor cells...|$|R
40|$|Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) {{is a local}} {{treatment}} that requires a photosensitizing agent, light and molecular oxygen. With appropriate illumination, the photosensitizer is <b>excited</b> and produces <b>singlet</b> <b>oxygen</b> that is highly reactive and cytotoxic. Tumor vascular network {{is essential for the}} tumor growth and the understanding of vascular response mechanisms enables an improvement in the PDT protocol for cancer treatment. Compounds of porphyrin (Photogem®) and chlorin (Photodithazine®) were the photosensitizers tested. The incubation times varied from 20 to 80 min and the concentration ranged between 0. 1 and 100 μg/cm 2. Different light doses were used between 4. 8 and 40 J/cm 2 with irradiance varying between 80 and 100 mW/cm 2. The light dose of 30 J/cm 2 was used in the intravenous photosensitizer application. The membrane images were made from 0 to 300 min after treatment. The vascular response was evaluated by the average vessel area. Different responses was observed depending on the photosensitizer concentration and administration form. Intravenous application has been more efficient to produce vessel constriction and the most pronounced effect was observed for the chlorin. FAPESP (CEPOF-CEPID Program) CAPE...|$|R
40|$|Both the {{neurotransmitter}} serotonin and the unnatural {{amino acid}} 5 -hydroxytryptophan (5 HT), contain the 5 -hydroxyindole chromophore. The photochemistry of 5 HT {{is being investigated}} {{in relation to the}} multiphoton excitation of this chromophore to produce a characteristic photoproduct with green fluorescence (‘hyperluminescence’). Laser flash photolysis (308 nm) of 5 HT in aqueous solution at neutral pH produces both the neutral 5 -indoloxyl radical (λmax 400 - 420 nm) and another transient absorption with λmax 480 nm and lifetime of 2 μs in deaerated solutions. Based on quenching by oxygen and β-carotene, the species at 480 nm is identified as the triplet excited state of 5 HT. In acidic solution a new oxygen-insensitive intermediate with λmax 460 is assigned to the radical cation of 5 HT. Time-resolved measurements of luminescence at 1270 nm have shown that the triplet state of 5 HT is able to react with <b>oxygen</b> to form <b>singlet</b> <b>excited</b> <b>oxygen</b> (1 O 2 *) with a quantum yield of ∼ 0. 1. However, 5 HT has also been found to be an effective quencher of <b>singlet</b> <b>oxygen</b> with a second order rate constant of 1. 3 × 108 dm 3 mol- 1 s- 1. The results are discussed in the light of recent observations on the multiphoton-excited photochemistry of serotonin...|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the reactions of oxygen in its normal ground state, some reactions of oxygen are due to the <b>excited</b> <b>singlet</b> state, a highly reactive form of the molecule. <b>Singlet</b> <b>oxygen</b> {{is responsible for the}} rapid deterioration of materials, particularly those with conjugated unsaturation such as natural rubber and synthetic elastomers. It is formed when triplet oxygen, the normal ground state, reacts with sensitizers, such as certain dyes and ketones, excited by radiation to their triplet states. Oxygen also increases the amount of solar radiation absorbed by conjugated unsaturated hydrocarbons through formation of a complex with these materials.|$|R
40|$|The photophysical properties, the {{capacity}} to produce <b>singlet</b> molecular <b>oxygen</b> by sensitization and the photostability {{of a series of}} 20 aryloxazinones and one quinoxalinone have been evaluated using a combination of methods including steady-state and time-resolved spectroscopic techniques. The photophysics of aryloxazinone derivatives and consequently its capacity to produce <b>singlet</b> molecular <b>oxygen</b> is very dependent on the structure. Benzoxazinone derivatives substituted in para position to the 2 -phenyl group (1) -(3) have low fluorescence quantum yields and produce <b>singlet</b> <b>oxygen</b> in moderate quantum yields. Inclusion of electron donors groups in position 7 of the aromatic fused moiety to the heterocyclic ring (4) -(6), increases significantly the emission from the <b>excited</b> <b>singlet</b> state with a concomitant diminution in the ability to produce <b>singlet</b> <b>oxygen.</b> An exception corresponds to the 7 -methoxy- 2 phenylbenzoxazinone (4) able to generate larger quantities of excited oxygen and photodecompose in less than a 2 % under large energy doses in aerobic irradiation conditions. In general, 2 -phenyl and 2 -methyl naphthoxazinones derivatives (7) -(17) are more fluorescent than the compounds of the corresponding benzo series, and generate <b>singlet</b> molecular <b>oxygen</b> in low to moderate yields. Exceptions are the 2 -methyl (13) and the 9 -methoxy- 2 -methyl (14) derivatives that produce excited oxygen efficiently, however, with appreciable decomposition. The most promising compounds to be employed as <b>singlet</b> <b>oxygen</b> sensitizers are the anthracene like 3 -phenyl- 2 H-naphtho[2, 3 -b][1, 41 -oxazin- 2 -one (19) and the 1 -methyl- 3 -phenylquinoxalin- 2 (1 H) -one (21). These compounds are photostable in the absence and in the presence of electron donor additives under large doses of irradiation, accomplishing all requisites to be good sensitizer and to produce <b>singlet</b> <b>oxygen</b> in high yields, almost independently on solvent polarity.
