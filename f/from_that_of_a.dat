5|$|After {{the fall}} of Acre, Edward's {{international}} role changed <b>from</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> diplomat to an antagonist. He had long been {{deeply involved in the}} affairs of his own Duchy of Gascony. In 1278 he assigned an investigating commission to his trusted associates Otto de Grandson and the chancellor Robert Burnell, which caused the replacement of the seneschal Luke de Tany. In 1286, Edward visited the region himself and stayed for almost three years. The perennial problem, however, was the status of Gascony within the kingdom of France, and Edward's role as the French king's vassal. On his diplomatic mission in 1286, Edward had paid homage to the new king, Philip IV, but in 1294 Philip declared Gascony forfeit when Edward refused to appear before him in Paris to discuss the recent conflict between English, Gascon, and French sailors (that had resulted in several French ships being captured, along with the sacking of the French port of La Rochelle).|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} {{previous}} novels in the series, aspects of Thunderball come from Fleming's own experiences: the visit to the health clinic was inspired by his own 1955 trip to the Enton Hall health farm and Bond's medical record, as read out to him by M, is a slightly modified version of Fleming's own. The name of the health farm, Shrublands, was taken <b>from</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> house owned by the parents of his wife's friend, Peter Quennell. Fleming dedicates {{a quarter of the}} novel to the Shrublands setting and the naturalist cure Bond undergoes.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the first}} quantum effects to be {{explicitly}} noticed (but not understood at the time) was a Maxwell observation involving hydrogen, half a century before full quantum mechanical theory arrived. Maxwell observed that the specific heat capacity of H2 unaccountably departs <b>from</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> diatomic gas below room temperature and begins to increasingly resemble that of a monatomic gas at cryogenic temperatures. According to quantum theory, this behavior arises from the spacing of the (quantized) rotational energy levels, which are particularly wide-spaced in H2 because of its low mass. These widely spaced levels inhibit equal partition of heat energy into rotational motion in hydrogen at low temperatures. Diatomic gases composed of heavier atoms do not have such widely spaced levels and do not exhibit the same effect.|$|E
5|$|Sound {{technicians}} {{spent the}} early part of the year trying to find the right sounds. Some, such as animal sounds like those of tigers and walruses, were bought. Human voices were also used. Fran Walsh contributed to the Nazgûl scream and David Farmer the Warg howls. Other sounds were unexpected: the fell beast's screech is taken <b>from</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> donkey, and the mûmakils bellow comes from the beginning and end of a lion's roar. In addition, ADR was used for most of the dialogue.|$|E
5|$|Testing of the Disney bombs {{began in}} early 1945. Bombs were {{initially}} dropped on a bombing range near Southampton to photographically record their trajectory and calibrate bombsights. This was necessary as the flight-path of a rocket-accelerated bomb differed considerably <b>from</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> free–falling bomb. Test drops were then {{conducted on the}} Watten bunker, German codename Kraftwerk Nord West (now known as the Blockhaus d'Éperlecques), a large German concrete bunker near Watten in northern France. This was ideal for the purpose as the area had been captured by Allied forces in September 1944, so damage to the structure could be inspected after bomb tests. Four bombs, carried by two B-17s, were used and two hits scored on the target. The resultant damage was considered satisfactory by Royal Navy observers on the ground.|$|E

The presentation of the Group varied as the series progressed, with its role changing <b>from</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> benevolent investigative group to an antagonistic mystic sect. The Millennium Group has met with negative responses, with its vacillating depiction being a focus of criticism both from critics and from series star Lance Henriksen.|$|E
5|$|The anime {{adaptation}} shows Deep Blue as a voice {{coming from}} a blue light, to whom Kisshu gives progress reports, and a shadowed version of his true form is seen when Quiche brings him some mew aqua in episode twenty-six. His death is changed in the anime to come {{at the hands of}} Mew Ichigo rather than Masaya, though Masaya aids her by taking over the body. To keep the true identity of Deep Blue a secret, his voice actor's name is shown only as a question mark until his identity is revealed in episode forty-nine; after which the credits are changed to list Megumi Ogata (who also voices Masaya and the Blue Knight). Deep Blue {{is one of the few}} characters whose name remains unchanged in the Mew Mew Power dub. The anime slightly modified his role <b>from</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> savior for the aliens to a destructive force that wants to do nothing but destroy the Earth which causes the aliens to turn against him.|$|E

5|$|The {{life cycle}} of a termite begins with an egg, but is {{different}} <b>from</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bee or ant in that it goes through a developmental process called incomplete metamorphosis, with egg, nymph and adult stages. Nymphs resemble small adults, and go {{through a series of}} moults as they grow. In some species, eggs go through four moulting stages and nymphs go through three. Nymphs first moult into workers, and then some workers go through further moulting and become soldiers or alates; workers become alates only by moulting into alate nymphs.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} changes to {{gameplay}} {{and the way}} text is displayed during Bad Boys Love in the original version of the game: saving is disabled except at certain points in the story, the function to skip dialogue and interactions is removed, and plot-important dialogue and narrative are highlighted with colored text; usually yellow, though text of particularly critical importance is highlighted in red. In the 2014 remake however, the option to save is available at all times, the skip function is retained, and text is no longer highlighted. In both versions, the game's interface and controls change <b>from</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> standard visual novel to {{similar to that of}} a '90s-era turn-based role-playing game during certain segments of the narrative.|$|E
5|$|Joint {{attention}} {{is an important}} mechanism through which children learn to map words-to-world, and vice versa. Adults commonly make an attempt to establish joint attention with a child before they convey something to the child. Joint {{attention is}} often accompanied by physical co-presence, since children are often focused on what is in their immediate environment. As well, conversational co-presence is likely to occur; the caregiver and child typically talk together about whatever is taking place at their locus of joint attention. Social pragmatic perspectives often present children as covariation detectors, who simply associate the words that they hear with whatever they are attending to {{in the world at}} the same time. The co-variation detection model of joint attention seems problematic when we consider that many caregiver utterances do not refer to things that occupy the immediate attentional focus of infants. For instance, caregivers among the Kaluli, a group of indigenous peoples living in New Guinea, rarely provide labels {{in the context of their}} referents. While the covariation detection model emphasizes the caregiver's role in the meaning-making process, some theorists argue that infants also play an important role in their own word learning, actively avoiding mapping errors. When infants are in situations where their own attentional focus differs <b>from</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> speaker, they seek out information about the speaker's focus, and then use that information to establish correct word-referent mappings. Joint attention can be created through infant agency, in an attempt to gather information about a speaker's intent.|$|E

Despite his optimism, Obama was critical of former Presidents GeorgeW. Bush and BillClinton. David E. Sanger, chief Washington correspondent for The New York Times, described the speech as the harshest rebuke of an outgoing President during an inaugural address since Franklin Roosevelt's call for restoration of American values. The Bush administration was upset about {{the tone of the}} speech, saying that the speech veered <b>from</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> ritualistic but respectful thanks to that of a public diatribe. Members of the Republican party viewed the speech as a missed chance to seek unity, while Rahm Emanuel, Obama's White House Chief of Staff, described the speech as a reflection of the mandate of the people.
