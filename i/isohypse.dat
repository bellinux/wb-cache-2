50|$|An isopycnal {{is a line}} of {{constant}} density. An isoheight or <b>isohypse</b> is a line {{of constant}} geopotential height on a constant pressure surface chart. <b>Isohypse</b> and isoheight are simply known as lines showing equal pressure on a map.|$|E
5000|$|... "Contour line" [...] is {{the most}} common usage in cartography, but isobath for {{underwater}} depths on bathymetric maps and <b>isohypse</b> for elevations are also used.|$|E
50|$|Topographic maps {{conventionally}} show topography, or land contours, {{by means}} of contour lines. Contour lines are curves that connect contiguous points of the same altitude (<b>isohypse).</b> In other words, every point on the marked line of 100 m elevation is 100 m above mean sea level.|$|E
50|$|Contour lines (or <b>isohypses)</b> are isolines showing equal elevation. This is {{the most}} common way of numerically showing elevation, and is {{familiar}} from topographic maps.|$|R

40|$|In a {{continuation}} of Richard Finsterwalder's work of 1950 eight selected glaciers in the Eastern Alps have been photogrammetrically surveyed and mapped {{on a scale of}} 1 : 10. 000 in the years 1959 and 1969 in order to establish a record of glacier variation. From a comparison of <b>isohypses</b> of the 1950, 1959 and 1969 surveys the height changes of the glacier surfaces have been determined for approximately two decades. This yielded an average raise of 0, 1 m per year, while an average sinking of glacier surfaces of 0, 6 m per year had been found for the period 1920 - 1950...|$|R

50|$|The Castle {{is located}} about 9 {{kilometers}} to the south-west of Fushe Kosova, and about 16 kilometers south-west of Pristina. It {{is located on}} a forested hillock, at the highest <b>isohypse</b> and occupies an area of approx. 1.3 hectares. It {{does not have a}} regular geometric shape. On the west side, it connects with the Golesh hill, which commands the highest above sea level altitude of 1019 meters, while on the south-east, only 2.5 kilometers away is the Prishtina Airport. It has a mainly flat area on the south east, slightly elevated towards the north-west. The Fort possesses a unique geostrategic position, with the maximum altitude of 767 m above sea level and minimum of 736 m, from where can be controlled a large area of the Kosovo Field.Before archaeological excavations started, there were no traces of the fortified rampart and of the interior architectural structures, which had been covered by soil and dense and diverse vegetation.|$|E
50|$|After the war the atlas {{maintained}} the same character with {{relief in the}} style of the great classic atlases (hachuring), in contrast to newly published works, that used <b>isohypses</b> (contour lines) to indicate altitudes. This, side by side with the superior typography of the hand-drawn type in the Atlante Internazionale, the lettering, gave the maps a very attractive appearance. The seventh edition was issued 1955/56, the last and eighth edition in 1968: an atlas of 50 x 32 centimetres with 94 tables, in total 173 pages of cartographic material, and an index, covering 250,000 geographical names; the map surface consisted of about 18 square metres! The eighth edition was finally reprinted in 1977.|$|R
40|$|Abstract niet beschikbaarThe {{computer}} program FLSTAT 3 D (FLow STATionary in 3 Dimensions) calculates the quasi-three-dimensional discontinuous velocity field {{in a system}} of coupled semi-confined anisotropic heterogeneous aquifers, based upon two-dimensional <b>isohypses</b> for every aquifer, on a regional scale. The Dupuit-Forchheimer assumption is supposed to be valid. The model area is subdivided into distorted cubic shaped elements. Hydraulic conductivities (k) or a vertical flow resistance (c) and a value of porosity (n) must be given for every element. A hydraulic head (phi) must be given for every nodal point of one layer in an aquifer. These data and the mesh coordinates are organized in the data generator RDARR. The post-processing program METROPART calculates flow paths starting from a point somewhere in the flow field. Cartesian coordinates and travel times are the results of the calculations in both printable and graphics processable output. The program can be instatlled on every computer with a FORTRAN compiler...|$|R
40|$|We have {{downloaded}} {{upper-air observation}} data {{over the period}} of 1973 to 2013 in TEMP reports of all radiosonde stations and pilot-ballon stations from a free American website. WMO keeps register of around 750 radiosonde stations in operation today in the Global Observing System. The purpose of this database is to prepare upper-air case studies and statistical analyses. Not only data of the main isobaric surfaces but of the significant levels (marked points) are available as well, so the whole vertical profile of temperature, humidity and wind can be reconstructed. It enables investigation of climate of <b>isohypses,</b> {{short and long term}} variation in the height of tropopause, inversions and isotherms in the future. In the starting phase we can analyse the spatial and temporal variation of data capture that can result interesting outcomes. Since radio sounding is a costly observation method economic considerations of certain countries are reflected in the frequency or even suspending of the measurements. On the other hand several developing countries perform extended upper-air monitoring...|$|R
40|$|Large-scale {{atmospheric}} circulation controls the mass and energy {{balance of the}} Greenland ice sheet through its impact on radiative budget, runoff and accumulation. Here, using reanalysis data and the outputs of a regional climate model, we show that the persistence of an exceptional atmospheric ridge, centered over the Arctic Ocean, was responsible for a poleward shift of runoff, albedo and surface temperature records over the Greenland {{during the summer of}} 2015. New records of monthly mean zonal winds at 500 hPa and of the maximum latitude of ridge peaks of the 5, 700 +/- 50 m <b>isohypse</b> over the Arctic were associated with the formation and persistency of a cutoff high. The unprecedented (1948 - 2015) and sustained atmospheric conditions promoted enhanced runoff, increased the surface temperatures and decreased the albedo in northern Greenland, while inhibiting melting in the south, where new melting records were set over the past decade.
