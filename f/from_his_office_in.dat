5|$|Asad was {{dismissed}} <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>office</b> <b>in</b> Ramadan 109 AH (December 727 or January 728 AD), when in an outburst of anger {{he had the}} chief representatives of the four greatest Arab tribes in Khurasan, the Ahl al-'Aliyah, Azd, Tamim, and Bakr, publicly flogged. Caliph Hisham demanded his dismissal, and after naming al-Hakam ibn 'Awana al-Kalbi as his deputy, Asad returned to his brother in Iraq.|$|E
5|$|In September 1936, Bill's brother, the Catholic priest Reverend Denny, and his sister, Mary Catherine Denny, were {{involved}} in a vehicle accident in which Mary received fatal injuries. Reverend Denny suffered from an illness that resulted from the accident which contributed to his death in June 1941. Denny wrote a further autobiographical book, A Digger at Home and Abroad, which was published in 1941. He continued to practice law until his death, despite difficulties associated with rheumatoid arthritis. He died on 2 May 1946 of a heart attack which developed at his home on Osmond Terrace, Norwood, after he returned <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>office</b> <b>in</b> Adelaide. He was survived by his wife, one son and three daughters. He was accorded a state funeral, and was buried at West Terrace Cemetery.|$|E
5|$|Sam Houston was an {{attorney}} by profession and politically accomplished {{even before he}} moved to Texas. In Tennessee, he had been both {{a member of the}} United States House of Representatives and Governor. His military victory at the Battle of San Jacinto elevated him to hero status in Texas. After completing his first term as President of the Republic of Texas in early December 1838, he continued to practice law <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>office</b> <b>in</b> Liberty. He arrived in Mobile, Alabama, in the early months of 1839 as a partner of the Sabine City Company, seeking investors to develop a community that is today known as Sabine Pass. Through Martin Lea, he made the acquaintance of Antoinette's husband William Bledsoe, a wealthy businessman who in turn suggested Nancy Lea as a possible investor. Invited to a garden party at Martin's home, it was there Houston first became acquainted with Margaret. The mutual attraction was instantaneous.|$|E

He was FIFA's interim president until Jules Rimet was elected its third president in March 1921.|$|R
5|$|The {{outbreak}} of war raised Kruger's international profile even further. In countries antagonistic to Britain he was idolised; Kruger expressed high hopes of German, French or Russian military intervention, despite the repeated despatches from Leyds telling him {{this was a}} fantasy. Kruger took no part in the fighting, partly because of his age and poor health—he turned 74 the week war broke out—but perhaps primarily to prevent his being killed or captured. His personal contributions to the military campaign were mostly <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>office</b> <b>in</b> Pretoria, where he oversaw the war effort and advised his officers by telegram. The Boer commandos, including four of Kruger's sons, six sons-in-law and 33 of his grandsons, advanced quickly into the Cape and Natal, won a series of victories {{and by the end}} of October were besieging Kimberley, Ladysmith and Mafeking. Soon thereafter, following a serious injury to Joubert, Kruger appointed Louis Botha to be Acting Commandant-General.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept for}} Super Mario Galaxys {{gameplay}} originated from ideas taken from Super Mario 128, a technology demonstration shown at Nintendo Space World in 2000 to exemplify the processing {{power of the}} GameCube. The demonstration's director (and future director of Super Mario Galaxy), Yoshiaki Koizumi, desired {{that one of its}} distinguishing features, spherical-based platforms, should be used in a future game, but was held back in belief that such a feature would be impossible for technical reasons. Super Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto suggested to work on the next large-scale Mario game after Nintendo EAD Tokyo finished development on Donkey Kong Jungle Beat in late 2004, pushing for the spherical platform concept to be realised. A prototype of the game's physics system took three months to build, where it was decided that the game's use of spherical platforms would best be suited to planetoids in an outer space environment, with the concept of gravity as a major feature. During development, the designers would often exchange ideas with Miyamoto <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>office</b> <b>in</b> Kyoto, where he would make suggestions to the game design. According to Koizumi, many ideas were conceived before development of the Wii console itself begun.|$|E

His 30-year marriage to Lucy Goosby ended in 1946.|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{the other}} {{governors}} and commissioners of other British overseas territories, {{there is no}} separate flag for the Commissioner of the British Indian Ocean Territory. This is mainly because he is never resident in the territory, {{and he would be}} unable to fly any flag <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>offices</b> <b>in</b> the Foreign and Commonwealth <b>Office</b> <b>in</b> London.|$|R
25|$|In December 1925, {{the provincial}} council of Cuneo, in which Giolitti was re-elected {{president}} in August, voted a motion who {{asked him to}} join the National Fascist Party. Giolitti, who at the time, completely opposed the regime, resigned <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>office.</b> <b>In</b> 1928 {{he spoke to the}} Chamber against the law which effectively abolished the elections, replacing them with the ratification of governmental appointments.|$|E
25|$|In 1905 Schlaich {{accused the}} German Vice Consul Dr. Eugen Büge (1859–1936) in Jaffa to be {{breaking}} consular secrets {{in return for}} gifts. So Büge was transferred for disciplinary reasons to Aleppo, however, the German Foreign Office urged also Schlaich's transfer, since it considered Schlaich and not Büge to have damaged its reputation abroad. The , the executive board of the Prussian state church, pressurised Jerusalem's Association to release Schlaich <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>office</b> <b>in</b> Jaffa, thus he was appointed for another pastorate in Germany. The Jaffa congregation gave Schlaich a farewell on 25 December 1905, and Georg Johannes Egger (1842) thanked Schlaich and his wife for 9 years of successful pastoral work.|$|E
500|$|Melish {{distributed}} the Cleveland coins through the exposition, at local banks, and by mail order <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>office</b> <b>in</b> Cincinnati. Sales were good, {{and the full}} authorized mintage of 50,000 was struck. [...] Congress had inserted safeguards in the legislation to curb excessive profits, and {{though some of the}} coins were minted in 1937, there was no change of date, meaning collectors would only have to purchase one piece to have a complete set. Thousands remained in dealer inventories for years, and the coins remain inexpensive by the standards of commemorative coins of the era.|$|E
50|$|MacManaway was {{selected}} by the Unionist party to contest Belfast West in the 1950 General Election. As a precaution, he resigned <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>offices</b> <b>in</b> the Church of Ireland. He won the election, defeating the sitting Irish Labour Party MP Jack Beattie by 3,378 votes. Among the activists working on this campaign was a young Ian Paisley.|$|R

500|$|Assistant Postmaster General Frank H. Hitchcock {{resigned}} <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>office</b> <b>in</b> February 1908 to {{lead the}} Taft effort. In April, Taft made a speaking tour, traveling as far west as Omaha before being recalled to go to Panama and straighten out a contested election. At the 1908 Republican National Convention in Chicago in June, there was no serious opposition to him, and he gained a first-ballot victory. Yet Taft did not have things his own way: he had hoped his running mate would be a midwestern progressive like Iowa Senator Jonathan Dolliver, but instead [...] the convention named Congressman James S. Sherman of New York, a conservative. [...] Taft resigned as Secretary of War on June 30 to devote himself full-time to the campaign.|$|E
500|$|His law {{practice}} increased greatly from this exposure, {{as did the}} demands on his time. In 1771, he moved Abigail and the children to Braintree, but he kept his office in Boston, saying, [...] "I shall spend more Time in my Office than ever I did." [...] He also noted {{on the day of}} the family's move, [...] "Now my family is away, I feel no Inclination at all, no Temptation, to be any where but at my Office. I am in it by 6 in the Morning – I am in it at 9 at night.... In the Evening, I can be alone at my Office, and no where else. I never could in my family." [...] Nevertheless, after some time in the capital, he became disenchanted with the rural and [...] "vulgar" [...] Braintree as a home for his family. In August 1772, therefore, Adams moved his family back to Boston. He purchased a large brick house on Queen Street, not far <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>office.</b> <b>In</b> 1774, Adams and Abigail returned the family to the farm due to the increasingly unstable situation in Boston, and Braintree remained their permanent Massachusetts home.|$|E
500|$|Although {{the cathedral}} is modest in size, {{it is very}} richly ornamented. As was his usual practice, <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>office</b> <b>in</b> Buckingham Street {{and in the course}} of many site visits, Burges oversaw all aspects of the design, {{including}} the statuary, the stained glass and the furniture, charging 10% rather than his usual 5%, owing to the high level of his personal involvement. He drew designs for every one of the 1,260 sculptures that adorn the West Front and decorate the building inside and out. He sketched cartoons for the majority of the 74 stained glass windows. He designed the mosaic pavement, the altar, the pulpit and the bishop's throne. Lawrence and Wilson consider the result [...] "undoubtedly [...] greatest work in ecclesiastical architecture" [...] with an interior that is [...] "overwhelming and intoxicating." [...] Through his ability, by the careful leadership of his team, by total artistic control, and by vastly exceeding the intended budget of £15,000, Burges produced a building that in size is little more than a large parish church but in impression is described in Lawrence and Wilson's study as [...] "a cathedral becoming such a city and one which posterity may regard as a monument to the Almighty's praise." ...|$|E
50|$|He was {{an agent}} for Apthorp and Hancock of Boston. Smith served as an ensign in Captain John Gorham's Rangers.

To mark the end of the SED's monopoly on power, LDPD leader Manfred Gerlach was elected chairman. However, the body ceased to be of political importance and merely oversaw the transition to the parliamentary elections of March 1990.|$|R

500|$|CNR {{dispatcher}} A. E. Tisdale {{meant to}} send both trains identical orders to [...] "meet" [...] (get past each other) on a mostly single-track section. His intended order read [...] "Psgr Extra 3538 West meet No.2 Eng6004 at Cedarside and No.4 Eng6057 Gosnell." [...] (Cedarside and Gosnell were sidings where trains could wait to allow opposing traffic to clear.) Tisdale dictated the order <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>office</b> <b>in</b> Kamloops, British Columbia, to Alfred John [...] "Jack" [...] Atherton, the operator at Red Pass Junction, for delivery to Passenger Extra 3538 West, the troop train, and to F.E. Parsons, the operator at Blue River, [...] westbound from Red Pass Junction, for delivery to No.2, the Continental. The words [...] "at Cedarside" [...] {{did not appear}} in the order as copied down by Atherton to be handed to the troop train crew. Parsons's version of the order accorded with Tisdale's, and was passed to the Continental and to Train No.4. According to Hugh A. Halliday in his history of Canadian railroad wrecks, [...] "it would have been one man's word against the other, but the Blue River operator had been on the line at the same time. Parsons backed up Tisdale's version of events; Atherton would be cast firmly as the culprit in this affair." ...|$|E
500|$|Douglas' {{new houses}} embrace {{a range of}} sizes and types, and include {{substantial}} country houses, such as Oakmere Hall and Abbeystead House; cottages, such as the pair known as Tai Cochion; workers' houses, {{such as those in}} Port Sunlight; and terraces of houses built for speculation, including 6–11 Grosvenor Park Road and 1–11 and 13 Bath Street in Chester. Work carried out on grand houses included additions to Vale Royal Abbey and Hawarden Castle. Works associated with houses include entrance gates for Mostyn Hall and a set of kennels at Croxteth Hall. Many of Douglas' new houses have been designated as listed buildings. Listed buildings are divided into three grades according to their importance. This list consists of work carried out by Douglas in designing new houses, additions and modifications to pre-existing houses, and structures related to houses such as kennels and gates. The details have been taken mainly from the Catalogue of Works in the biography by Edward Hubbard. Not all structures in these categories are included. If a building is listed, it has been included. Some unlisted buildings have been included because they are of interest, or they demonstrate that Douglas worked in areas at a distance away <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>office</b> <b>in</b> Chester. The works excluded are, on the whole, small houses, cottages and outbuildings. [...] Works attributed to Douglas by Hubbard on stylistic grounds together with evidence of a local association, even though they are not confirmed by other reliable evidence, are included. Where this is the case, it is stated in the Notes column. Unexecuted schemes are not included.|$|E
