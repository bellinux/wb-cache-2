40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} {{relaying}} techniques in WiMAX communication system. Different cooperative and non-cooperative schemes are investigated and compared over a complete 802. 16 WiMAX-OFDM chain. Realistic channel impulse responses are used. Measurement of some propagation conditions feeds the WINNER channel model {{in order to}} generate the channel coefficients belonging to different links. Besides, real characteristics of an <b>industrial</b> <b>relay</b> are taken into account. Simulation {{results show that the}} performances of the relaying techniques, at constant relay gain, depend essentially on the propagation conditions pertaining to the different links in the network. They depend also on the received powers from the direct link and the relayed link. Finally, two intuitive power allocation schemes are examined when automatic gain controller is available at the relay...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} several {{methods for}} motivating students taking a power system protection (PSP) course. The paper reviews the laboratory activities {{developed for the}} PSP course at Curtin University, Australia; these methods are applicable {{and can be used}} for PSP course instruction at any institution. These activities were developed to improve the learning experience of the electrical engineering undergraduate and postgraduate students enrolled in this course. Initially, the PSP course at Curtin University consisted of lectures and tutorials accompanied by two sessions of software-based simulations and one session of laboratory demonstration. To motivate the students, several computer-based simulations and practical laboratory experiments were developed. PSCAD and ETAP power system analysis software tools are introduced and used to demonstrate the performance and coordination of different protection relays from steady-state and dynamic points of view. Also, a practical setup composed of a LabVolt power system simulator and <b>industrial</b> <b>relays</b> is used to carry out several practical experiments. The experiments help students observe the performance of protection systems for transformers and induction motors during faults and abnormal operating conditions. Finally, the concept of relay testing and commissioning is introduced by relay standalone experiments using a secondary injection relay test set. The results of these activities were evaluated according to the students' satisfaction, comments, total scores, and interest in PSP...|$|R
40|$|Salient pole {{synchronous}} generators as {{the main}} component of an electricity generation station should be carefully maintained and their operation has to be monitored such that any damage on them is avoided. Otherwise, the generating station might experience frequent shut downs which results in electricity generation interruptions and high costs associated with repairing and compensation of lack of energy. In this sense, many protective schemes focusing on a variety of synchronous generator faults have already been proposed and are still modified and developed to further enhance the quality of protection. In this thesis, synchronous generator stator windings to ground fault is studied {{as one of the most}} common and crucial faults in these machines. Numerous methods of stator winding to ground fault protection schemes are also reported in the literature. Third harmonic differential voltage and sub-harmonic schemes are studied in this research. A novel adaptive scheme for both methods is modelled and implemented in a comprehensive lab scale set-up where a real generation unit is scaled down including all different components and apparatus. The simulation model is also established based on simultaneous finite element analysis (FEA) and coupled magnetic circuit to assist with system configuration design and parameter selections. The adaptive scheme is proved to be capable of detecting stator windings to ground faults based on actual experimental data. Finally, the proposed adaptive scheme is compared against other available non-adaptive protection schemes currently used in <b>industrial</b> <b>relays.</b> Several important performance evaluation criteria in protection schemes such as sensitivity and security of operation referred to as reliability are considered. It is shown that the adaptive scheme offers higher reliability than other schemes which emphasizes its credibility and applicability...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{assembly}} planning consists in generating feasible sequences {{to assemble a}} product and selecting an efficient assembly sequence from amongst these. This paper describes an original ordering genetic algorithm (OGA) developed to solve this problem. The developed approach permits the generation {{of assembly}} trees for a mechanical product. The algorithm is based on three main ideas. First, a mapping transforms any studied assembly plan into a valid one using 'precedence values' changing through the sequence, so that an invalid sequence will never be proposed. Secondly, to identify subsets, trace is kept all along the sequence of the components membership {{to a set of}} parts. Finally, the individuals of the OGA are compared with each other using a multi-criteria decision aided method called PROMETHEE II. The use of this method avoids aggregating several technical criteria into a unique fitness value. The proposed algorithm, illustrated through the simple example of a mouse device, has been applied on an <b>industrial</b> signalling <b>relay</b> made of 34 parts.

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this paper}} is to {{simulate}} the performances of a ground fault circuit-breaker (GFCB) relay with new low nickel content alloys. Indeed, in the construction industry, the materials become more expensive as their nickel content increases. Moreover, the demand for nickel is particularly sensitive to the economic conjuncture. Therefore, an original electromagnetic relay model has been developed and validated in different working conditions (current amplitude, frequency, temperature). A dedicated magnetic characterization of materials is needed, using basically a usual and <b>industrial</b> GFCB <b>relay</b> for reference and design data in modeling. First, the magnetic model of the relay is built and checked against experimental data. The simulation may predict the tripping current threshold of the relay. On the other hand, new low nickel content alloys for relay parts are studied in this framework, thanks to the developed model. The effect of temperature on the magnetic properties of the candidate materials and the electrical performances of the virtual relays is presented. The results, analysis, and conclusions are given. Finally, a first attempt to predict the economic gain made with a change of material is made...|$|R

40|$|Ongoing {{emphasis}} on the fourth industrial revolution requires further focus on the Internet of Things (IoT) {{as a means to}} integrate all relevant entities within a single technological system. In the integration process, a gateway to relay the raw data to an IoT endpoint is essential so that a joint interface among the heterogeneous domains can be provided. This work describes the development of a distributed industrial IoT gateway, called DIIG, able to <b>relay</b> <b>industrial</b> network data to a centralized data-store. DIIG exploits a real-time client server programming model based on S 7 communication and Modbus TCP protocols. The subsequent analysis carried out on the testbed mainly focuses on the performance evaluation of the gateway.

40|$|Relaying {{is a very}} {{promising}} technique to improve the reliability of data transmission in wireless (<b>industrial)</b> networks. With <b>relaying,</b> relay nodes support source nodes in carrying out retransmissions. A common assumption is that relayers should be placed at âgoodâ positions (e. g. in the middle between source and destination) to achieve benefits. In this paper we tackle {{the question of whether}} it is strictly necessary to place relayers at âgoodâ positions (which often requires extensive measurements). We present results indicating that the benefits of relaying are achievable even with randomly placed relayers, as long as enough of them are deployed. Specifically, we present results suggesting that with a sufficient (and still not too high) number of randomly deployed relayers, the probability that all packets, sent by source nodes to a central controller in a TDMA round, reach the controller is larger than for the case with source-only retransmissions. This finding holds true both in the absence and the presence of feedback. Â© 2012 IEEE. Â© 2012 IEEE. Personal use of this material is permitted.
