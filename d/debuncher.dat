40|$|A recent {{proposal}} to detect {mu} {yields} e direct conversion at Fermilab asks for slow extraction of protons from the antiproton source, specifically from the <b>Debuncher.</b> [1] A third-integer resonance originally was considered for this, {{partly because of}} the Debuncher's three-fold symmetry and partly because its operational horizontal tune, {nu}{sub x} {approx} 9. 765, is already within 0. 1 of {nu}{sub x} = 29 / 3. Using a half integer resonance, {nu}{sub x} = 19 / 2, though not part of the original proposal, has been suggested more recently because (a) Fermilab has had a good deal of experience with half-integer extraction from the Tevatron, the Main Injector and the erstwhile Main Ring, and (b) for reasons we shall examine later, it depopulates the entire bunch without an abort at the end. This memo presents considerations preliminary to studying both possibilities. It is meant only {{as a starting point for}} investigations to be carried out in the future. The working constraints and assumptions have oscillated between two extremes: (1) making minimal changes in the antiproton source to minimize cost and (2) building another machine in the same tunnel. In this memo we adopt an attitude aligned more toward the first. The assumed parameters are listed in Table 1. A few are not (easily) subject to change, such as those related to the beam's momentum and revolution frequency and the acceptance of the <b>debuncher.</b> Two resonance exemplars are presented in the next section, with an explanation of the analytic and semi-analytic calculations that can be done for each. Section 3 contains preliminary numerical work that was done to validate the exemplars within the context of extraction from the <b>Debuncher.</b> A final section contains a summary.

Each 30 -nsec macropulse from the linac contains 0. 25 nanocoulombs of charge (1. 5 x 10 9 positron/pulse). With a 1. 12 linac dilution factor, the 95 th percentile emittance is 6. 6 x 6. 6 (mmï¿½mrad) 2. This corresponds to an rms emittance of 1. 1 x 1. 1 (mmï¿½mrad) 2.

With nominal bunch beam currents of 10 {sup 11 } protons, the first incoherent Schottky signals were detected and analyzed. This paper will report on these initial commissioning results. A companion paper will report on the data analysis curve fitting and remote control user interface of the system.
