2500|$|The Moatfield site {{provides}} a rare snapshot {{into the lives}} of Iroquonians from the 13th Century. Evidence indicates the ossuary was a cemetery for one community. The <b>key</b> <b>here,</b> <b>is</b> that it served a community, not just a family or a specific kin group, a pattern that is more typically seen in populations from this period. Health patterns observed in the remains evidence a reliance on agriculture, and this reliance changed over time. Regardless of the changes, a continuity in the relationship between the dead and the living was maintained. The socio-political patterns associated with the evolving agricultural subsistence base, are [...] reflected in the bones of Moatfield people.|$|E
50|$|The Kontakion is also Byzantine-like in its melody. The soprano and the alto sing it {{together}} while the tenor and bass provide the ison. The <b>key</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> A melodic minor.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>key</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> non-capturing {{and also}} {{thematic}} (that is, it is logically {{related to the}} rest of the solution): 1.a7. The variations are largely the same as in the original: ...|$|E
5000|$|The <b>key</b> <b>here</b> <b>was</b> the {{prospective}} liabilities. Various tranches of the notes were due for payment at various future dates, {{the latest of}} which were 2045 (or thirty years after the date that the case was being heard in the Supreme Court).|$|R
30|$|The <b>key</b> {{complication}} <b>here</b> <b>is</b> the nondifferentiability of {{the value}} function within the dynamic programming, {{as well as the}} spike discontinuity (4).|$|R
5000|$|Another <b>key</b> feature <b>here</b> <b>is</b> the {{presence}} of several cultural groups. In 1976 founded the Cultural Association of Martino, [...] "MO.SY.M" [...] which seeks to support every kind of act of cultural interest.|$|R
50|$|There {{are clearly}} good lessons {{that can be}} drawn from the MOA-AD {{experience}} which can shed light on how to move forward. The <b>key</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> that civil society and peace advocates recognize, accept and learn from those lessons.|$|E
5000|$|Anybody knowing r could {{compute the}} message m; so r {{must not be}} {{revealed}} by Alice. In addition to the publicly available information, Bob knows his own private <b>key.</b> <b>Here</b> <b>is</b> how he can obtain m: First he multiplies the encrypted message e and part of his private key f ...|$|E
50|$|This {{is quite}} simply a {{description}} of where exactly the retouch {{is located on the}} flake. The <b>key</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> to be very specific. The retouch extensiveness for each area should also be described. This entails whether the retouch is total or partial. Proper flake terminology should be used in these descriptions.|$|E
60|$|MACAIRE. O, yes, I remember. I {{heard it}} drop. (Drops <b>key.)</b> And <b>here</b> it <b>is</b> before my eyes.|$|R
5000|$|One {{problem with}} this {{protocol}} is that a malicious intruder can arrange for A and B {{to end up with}} different <b>keys.</b> <b>Here</b> <b>is</b> how: after A and B execute the first three messages, B has received the key [...] The intruder then intercepts the fourth message. He resends message 2, which results in S generating a new key , subsequently sent to B. The intruder intercepts this message too, but sends to A the part of it that B would have sent to A. So now A has finally received the expected fourth message, but with [...] instead of [...]|$|R
2500|$|The above {{expressions}} tell us {{how much}} enzymes [...] and [...] control the steady state flux. The <b>key</b> point <b>here</b> <b>is</b> that changes in enzyme concentration, or equivalently the enzyme activity, must be brought about by an external action.|$|R
5000|$|... "Pad 39C is {{the latest}} {{addition}} to our portfolio of launch pads," [...] said Scott Colloredo, CPD director. [...] "The small class market is here. The demand {{for that kind of}} launcher is increasing. The <b>key</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> this is really what a launch site for a small class launcher needs to look like." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{principle}} of exercise states that those things most often repeated are best remembered. It {{is the basis}} of drill and practice. It has been proven that students learn best and retain information longer when they have meaningful practice and repetition. The <b>key</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> that the practice must be meaningful. It is clear that practice leads to improvement only when it is followed by positive feedback.|$|E
5000|$|Former {{managing}} editor of Foreign Affairs, contributing editor of Time magazine, and now CNN host Fareed Zakaria says the President-elect Trump's call with President Tsai Ing-wen of Taiwan was {{not a bad idea}} while some people are getting a bit too critical. [...] "The {{truth of the matter is}} we need leverage with China... on many issues we need to be able to push them harder... The <b>key</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> that it should be part of a thought-through strategy." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{description}} of the manufacturing company reads “Manufacturing company That Produces against a 15-day forecast”.The <b>key</b> word <b>here</b> <b>is</b> “forecast”.What is the SCOR scenario that resembles a production based on forecast? The answer is, M1 (Make build to stock).|$|R
5000|$|The above {{expressions}} tell us {{how much}} enzymes [...] and [...] control the steady state flux. The <b>key</b> point <b>here</b> <b>is</b> that changes in enzyme concentration, or equivalently the enzyme activity, must be brought about by an external action.|$|R
3000|$|This is can be {{explained}} by the fact that, often some of selected features although leading to lower errors, are irrelevant which increases the training time and memory resources. A <b>key</b> question <b>here</b> <b>is</b> how to add relevant features without degrading the training performances ? [...]...|$|R
5000|$|The {{hierarchy}} makes proving {{certain kinds}} of theorems about Haken manifolds a matter of induction. One proves the theorem for 3-balls. Then one proves that if the theorem is true for pieces resulting from a cutting of a Haken manifold, then it is true for that Haken manifold. The <b>key</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> that the cutting takes place along a surface that was very [...] "nice", i.e. incompressible. This makes proving the induction step feasible in many cases.|$|E
50|$|The <b>key</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> that National Starch did not {{demonstrate}} that the investment banking, legal, and other costs it incurred in connection with Unilever’s acquisition of its shares are deductible as ordinary and necessary business expenses under §162(a). In addition to the analysis provided by the two previous courts, the Supreme Court cited {{the fact that there}} is a long history of finding that the purpose of changing the corporate structure for the benefit of future operations is not an ordinary and necessary business expense. General Bancshares Corp. v. Commissioner, 326. F.2d, at 715.|$|E
5000|$|A {{recent survey}} by {{internet}} security experts BullGuard showed a lack of insight into the rising number of malicious threats affecting mobile phones, with 53% of users claiming that they are unaware of security software for Smartphones. A further 21% argued that such protection was unnecessary, and 42% admitted it hadn't crossed their mind ("Using APA," [...] 2011). These statistics show consumers are not concerned about security risks because they believe {{it is not a}} serious problem. The <b>key</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> to always remember smartphones are effectively handheld computers and are just as vulnerable.|$|E
50|$|The <b>key</b> feature <b>here</b> <b>is</b> {{the loss}} of freedom of maneuver. If a force can easily {{overcome}} a terrain feature, while maintaining its fighting strength, then it is not breaking out; it is maneuvering {{in the same way}} any force would over non-restrictive terrain.|$|R
50|$|The <b>key</b> feature <b>here</b> <b>is</b> {{that the}} paths form {{a basis for}} the root {{operators}} like that of a monomial representation: when a root operator is applied to the basis element for a path, the result is either 0 or the basis element for another path.|$|R
50|$|The <b>key</b> theme <b>here</b> <b>is</b> the {{development}} of the Dorsai culture, and the creation of the Dorsai military model which makes their soldiers the best among all the settled worlds. It also shows the growth of the separate planetary cultures and their evolution to independence from Earth.|$|R
5000|$|The {{simplest}} {{form of the}} Leggett-Garg inequality {{derives from}} examining {{a system that has}} only two possible states. These states have corresponding measurement values [...] The <b>key</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> that we have measurements at two different times, and one or more times between the first and last measurement. The simplest example is where the system is measured at three successive times [...] Now suppose, for instance, that there is a perfect correlation [...] of 1 between times [...] and [...] That is to say, that for N realisations of the experiment, the temporal correlation reads ...|$|E
5000|$|In {{setting up}} a {{financial}} reinsurance treaty, the reinsurer will provide capital (there {{are a number of}} ways of doing this, discussed below). In return, the insurer will pay the capital back over time. The <b>key</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> to ensure that repayments only come out of surplus emerging from the reinsured block of business. The benefit of this surplus-limitation {{comes from the fact that}} in the regulatory accounts there is no value ascribed to future profits - which means the liability to repay the reinsurer is made from a series of payments which are deemed to be zero.|$|E
50|$|Shared {{services}} is {{the provision of}} a service by one part of an organization or group, where that service had previously been found, {{in more than one}} part of the organization or group. Thus the funding and resourcing of the service is shared and the providing department effectively becomes an internal service provider. The <b>key</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> the idea of 'sharing' within an organization or group. This sharing needs to fundamentally include shared accountability of results by the unit from where the work is migrated to the provider. The provider on the other hand needs to ensure that the agreed results are delivered based on defined measures (KPIs, cost, quality etc.).|$|E
5000|$|With a Sano shunt, a hole {{is made in}} {{the wall}} of the single {{ventricle}}, and a Gore-Tex conduit is used to connect the ventricle to the pulmonary artery. The <b>key</b> difference <b>here</b> <b>is</b> that the blood flow is more pulsatile than with the Blalock-Taussig version.|$|R
50|$|The APE can be {{computed}} correspondingly. The <b>key</b> idea <b>here</b> <b>is</b> {{to use the}} first-stage regression {{to purify}} the error term and then estimate the model without the endogeneity issue {{based on the assumption}} about the correlation structure. Another important assumption <b>here</b> <b>is</b> the normality distributional assumption, which cannot be relaxed under the Tobit model framework.|$|R
40|$|Social science {{research}} into migratory and post-migratory processes in Europe deals {{to some extent}} with {{the way in which}} certain categories of immigrants are ideologically problematized and are excluded from regular social resources. A <b>key</b> concept <b>here</b> <b>is</b> racism. What racism really is – i. e. what phenomena ca...|$|R

5000|$|It is a {{cover for}} the {{withdrawal}} of services and minimises the accountability of the state; blurring the lines {{of responsibility for the}} quality of service. If co-production is done for the wrong reasons this can be the case. It is a question of means and ends. The <b>key</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> to emphasise that 'co' requires input both from people who deliver services and people who have been seen as 'recipients' of them. They are likely to play different roles and power will be distributed differently in co-produced services but contribution from both is essential, otherwise services become 'self-organised' which is a different thing entirely.|$|E
5000|$|The {{situation}} comprises {{a complex}} web {{of material and}} social aspects of the environment, such as history, culture, physical environmental features, and policy environment, {{as well as more}} local aspects such as task complexity, organizational structure, or staff stability. The <b>key</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> to identify and focus on the [...] "aspects of the situation that enable and constrain leadership practice but also capture how they shape that practice." [...] Whereas Contingency Theory describes the situation as merely the context within which individuals act, a distributed perspective looks to the situation as constitutive, {{in the sense that it}} both influences and is influenced by the actions of the people in it.|$|E
50|$|Since 2000 he {{has been}} {{involved}} with influential work on questions in political press conferences (building on earlier work on the organization of news interviews more generally). A <b>key</b> work <b>here</b> <b>is</b> his joint book with Steve Clayman from UCLA, with whom he teaches the course 'Talk and Social Institutions' at UCLA.|$|R
5000|$|PPH {{pathology}} arises {{both from}} the humoral consequences of cirrhosis and the mechanical obstruction of the portal vein. A central paradigm holds responsible an excess local pulmonary production of vasoconstrictors that occurs while vasodilatation predominates systemically. <b>Key</b> <b>here</b> <b>are</b> imbalances between vasodilatory and vasoconstricting molecules; endogenous prostacyclin and thromboxane (from Kupffer Cells) [...] or nitrous oxide (NO) and endothelin-1 (ET-1). ET-1 is the most potent vasoconstrictor under investigation {{and it has been}} found to be increased in both cirrhosis and pulmonary hypertension. [...] Endothelin-1 has two receptors in the pulmonary arterial tree, ET-A which mediates vasoconstriction and ET-B which mediates vasodilation. Rat models have shown decreased ET-B receptor expression in pulmonary arteries of cirrhotic and portal hypertensive animals, leading to a predominant vasoconstricting response to endothelin-1.|$|R
40|$|We design carbyne {{transistor}} {{which is}} integrable into the existing silicon technology {{and can be}} scaled up in a rather broad range [...] starting from that prepared by us (by 0. 5 -mkm technology) up to the monomolecular one because the <b>key</b> mechanism <b>here</b> <b>is</b> the inter-chain charge transfer.
