5|$|After the Bears punted, Garrett Hartley {{kicked a}} 47-yard field goal. On the ensuing possession, Malcolm Jenkins forced Jay Cutler to fumble, and Cameron Jordan {{recovered}} the loose ball {{and reached the}} Bears' 6-yard line. After failing to score a touchdown, Hartley kicked a 19-yard field goal. In the second quarter, the Saints scored off Drew Brees' two-yard screen pass to Pierre Thomas to increase the lead to 13 points. On Chicago's next drive, the offense traveled 70 yards within eight plays, which ended in Jay Cutler's three-yard touchdown pass to Alshon Jeffery. The final score of the half was by Thomas, who caught a 25-yard pass from Brees. In the third quarter, after Hartley kicked a 36-yard field goal, the Bears traveled 71 yards to the Saints' 5-yard line. However, a penalty on Kyle Long for being an ineligible downfield player, followed by three consecutive incomplete passes forced Robbie Gould to <b>kick</b> <b>a</b> 27-yard field goal. Early in the following quarter, Chicago reached New Orleans' 25-yard line, but turned the ball over on downs after Cutler's pass to Earl Bennett on 4th and 2 was dropped. On the Saints' next drive, a neutral zone infraction penalty by Lance Briggs on 4th and 1 allowed Hartley to <b>kick</b> <b>a</b> 48-yard field goal to extend the Saints' lead to 26–10. However, the Bears attempted to rally, with Cutler throwing three consecutive passes to Jeffery, the final throw going 58 yards to the Saints' 2-yard line, where Brandon Marshall scored. Matt Forté's two-point conversion allowed the Bears to narrow the gap to eight points, but the onside kick was recovered by the Saints. Although the Saints were forced to punt, with 21 seconds remaining, Cutler could only manage to throw a pass to Jeffery which reached the Bears' 41-yard line, as time ran out, giving the Saints the 26–18 win. The win {{marked the first time}} the Saints defeated the Bears in an away game since 2002, although that game occurred at Memorial Stadium in Champaign, Illinois.|$|E
5|$|After {{the failed}} trick play, the Hokies' offense started at their 44-yard line. The first Tech {{play of the}} drive was a 15-yard pass from DeShazo to Still for a first down. A three-yard run by Thomas was {{followed}} by a seven-yard reverse by Still for another first down at the Tennessee 29-yard line. On first down, Thomas pushed the Hokies eight yards forward with a run up the middle. This was followed by two incomplete passes, bringing up fourth down. Again, Tech head coach Frank Beamer elected to try to convert the fourth down rather than <b>kick</b> <b>a</b> field goal. Unlike Tech's previous fourth down, however, the try was unsuccessful after DeShazo mishandled the snap and was tackled for a loss. Virginia Tech turned the ball over on downs, and Tennessee's offense returned to the game with 1:31 remaining in the quarter.|$|E
5|$|As {{characters}} gain experience points their mutant superpowers {{and unique}} abilities can be upgraded. Items found during gameplay {{can also be}} equipped to further enhance a character's abilities. Characters can combine attacks to create a combo, in which two or more players punch or <b>kick</b> <b>a</b> single enemy at the same time. The character's special abilities {{can also be used}} in the same manner to create a Super Combo which inflicts massive damage on enemies. Each character has several mutant powers that players can assign to controller buttons. The game also features a skirmish mode, which allows players to fight against each other or waves of computer-controlled enemies.|$|E

[...] On January 18, 2015, Crosby <b>kicked</b> <b>a</b> season-high 5 field goals against the Seattle Seahawks.|$|R
5|$|As had Virginia Tech, Air Force {{began moving}} {{the ball on}} the ground. The Falcons were aided by two offsides {{penalties}} against the Hokies and drove into Tech territory. Once there, Weiss completed a 16-yard pass to Tom Coleman for a first down. Weiss picked up another first down by running the ball, pushing the Falcons inside the Tech red zone with 10:10 remaining. The Tech defense stiffened, forcing a fourth down at the two-yard line. Rather than <b>kick</b> <b>a</b> field goal, Fisher DeBerry elected to attempt the touchdown, and Mike Brown ran the needed twoyards. The score and following extra point gave Air Force a 177 lead with 6:00 remaining in the game.|$|E
5|$|Hit & Run {{has seven}} levels, each with {{missions}} and sub-plot. The player can control one specific character in each level. The game's playable characters are Homer, Bart, Lisa, Marge, and Apu. Homer and Bart are played twice. When travelling on foot, the player character can walk, run, and perform {{three types of}} melee attacks: a normal <b>kick,</b> <b>a</b> jumping kick, and a smashing move. To drive, the player can either commandeer {{one of the many}} civilian vehicles that drive endlessly around town, or use a phone booth to select a car. The game's driving missions are also similar to those of Grand Theft Auto III. In both games, the player races against other characters, collects items before a timer runs out, and wrecks other cars.|$|E
5|$|Michigan State {{added to}} their lead {{at the start}} of the 2nd half with a 15-yard TD run by Glenn Winston. Michigan responded in the 4th quarter with a 60-yard {{touchdown}} by Darryl Stonum, and tied it up just before time expired with a 92-yard drive capped by a 9-yard TD pass by Forcier to Roy Roundtree, taking the game to overtime. On its opening drive of overtime Forcier led Michigan down to the 8-yard line but then threw a tipped interception in the end zone, ending their threat. MSU's Larry Caper ended the game with a 23-yard TD run on 3rd down and 12, breaking three Michigan tackles that would have forced the Spartans to <b>kick</b> <b>a</b> field goal for the win.|$|E

50|$|Iowa's defense {{continued}} to force Texas Tech to attempt field goals rather than score touchdowns. Robert Treece <b>kicked</b> <b>a</b> 23-yard field goal to cut Iowa's lead to 16-13. Tech's defense held, and Tech {{got the ball}} back. This time, Robert Treece <b>kicked</b> <b>a</b> 37-yard field goal {{to tie the game}} at 16. Kaeding provided the winning score, <b>kicking</b> <b>a</b> 47-yard field goal, to make the final score 19-16.|$|R
5|$|Navy {{received}} {{the ball from}} Washington and began to throw it erratically. After gaining several yards, Ira McKee threw an interception near midfield. On the next play, Fred Abel threw a long pass to George Wilson, who was tackled on the Navy 20-yard line after gaining 30yards. Washington brought out their placekicker, Leonard Ziel, to <b>kick</b> <b>a</b> 32-yard field goal, which would have won them the game. Ziel kicked the ball about a yard short of the right upright, giving the ball back to Navy with the game still tied. A few plays later the game ended in a 1414 tie.|$|E
5|$|Tech {{received}} Florida State's kickoff at {{its goal}} line {{and returned the}} ball to the 11-yard line, where Tech's offense took over. Kendrick ran for 12yards and a first down, but then Vick fumbled on a rush to the left. Florida State recovered the ball, and the Seminoles' offense was given the ball at the Virginia Tech 35-yard line. On the first play after the fumble, Chaney broke free for a long run that gave State a first down inside the Virginia Tech 10-yard line. The Seminoles were pushed backward on two consecutive plays and committed a chop block before Bowden was forced to send in Janikowski to <b>kick</b> <b>a</b> 32-yard field goal. The kick gave Florida State a 3929 lead with 10:26 remaining in the game.|$|E
5|$|Texas fair {{caught the}} punt at their 14-yard line. On {{the first play}} after the <b>kick,</b> <b>a</b> run up the middle was stopped {{for the loss of}} a yard. Williams then gained two yards, and Brown threw an {{incomplete}} pass. Texas went three-and-out {{for the first time in}} the second quarter and prepared to punt. Bryan Still fielded the kick at the Tech 40-yard line and returned it 60 yards to the end zone for Virginia Tech's first points of the game. The subsequent extra point was good, and with 2:34 remaining in the first half, Tech cut Texas' lead to 107.|$|E

5|$|The Tech kickoff was {{returned}} 17 yards by Gilyard to the Cincinnati 40-yard line, giving the Bearcats good field position {{to start their}} drive. Two rushes by Goebel resulted in 11 yards and a first down at the Tech 49-yard line. This success on the ground was followed by more through the air, as Pike completed three consecutive passes: a 16-yarder to Gilyard, a 3-yarder to Goodman, and a 14-yarder to Gilyard. Goebel then ran five yards to the Tech 11-yard line. Two Pike passes fell incomplete, setting up fourth down. Rather than attempt to <b>kick</b> <b>a</b> field goal, Cincinnati head coach Brian Kelly ordered the offense to attempt to convert the fourth down. This was done when Pike completed a seven-yard pass to Goodman for a first down at the Virginia Tech four-yard line. Two more Pike passes fell incomplete before Goebel rushed three yards to the Virginia Tech one-yard line. Cincinnati again faced a fourth down, and again, Kelly elected to attempt to score a touchdown rather than <b>kick</b> <b>a</b> field goal. Pike attempted to cross the goal line on a running play, but was stopped by the Virginia Tech defense. With 7:25 remaining in the game, Cincinnati turned the ball over on downs to the Virginia Tech offense, which returned to the field.|$|E
5|$|The {{first play}} of the Tech drive {{resulted}} in a 12-yard gain as Josh Hyman rushed for 12 yards and a first down on an end-around. Running back Cedric Humes was stopped for a loss on the first play after Hyman's rush, but earned 10yards on two subsequent rushes, setting up a fourth down. Needing one yard for a first down, behind by 16points, and with time running down in the quarter, Tech head coach Frank Beamer elected to attempt the first down play rather than <b>kick</b> <b>a</b> field goal. Humes again rushed the ball, and as time ran out in the third quarter, picked up enough ground for the first down. With one quarter of play remaining, Auburn led Virginia Tech 16–0, but the Hokies had picked up a first down inside the Auburn 10-yard line to begin the fourth quarter.|$|E
5|$|West Ham {{kicked the}} match off, as both teams {{lined up in}} a 4–4–2 formation. West Ham {{committed}} the first foul of the match in the first minute as Paul Konchesky brought down Steven Gerrard, but Liverpool were unable to capitalise on the resulting free <b>kick.</b> <b>A</b> few minutes later, West Ham midfielder Yossi Benayoun advanced down the right hand side of the pitch and passed {{the ball into the}} penalty area, but Liverpool defender Sami Hyypiä was able to intercept the ball before Ashton or Harewood received it. Harewood had the first shot on goal for West Ham in the 12th minute, but it was deflected out for a corner.|$|E

5|$|With a solid {{lead and}} time running {{down in the}} game, Georgia Tech began a {{sequence}} of running plays intended to keep the game clock running while gaining ground. From their 25-yard line, the Yellow Jackets gained 38 yards on seven plays, advancing into Clemson territory in the process. Facing fourth down at the Clemson 37-yard line, the Yellow Jackets attempted to gain a first down rather than <b>kick</b> <b>a</b> long field goal. When they were stopped short of the first-down line, Clemson's offense returned to the field. Spiller again drove the Tigers down the field, opening the drive with a 54-yard run on its first play. Three plays later, Ellington capitalized the drive with a one-yard run for a tying touchdown. The following extra point gave Clemson a one-point lead, 34–33, with 6:11 remaining in the game.|$|E
5|$|In a {{situation}} with more time, Virginia Tech would have kicked the ball off to Florida State and {{hoped for a}} defensive stop to give the offense {{a chance for a}} game-winning drive. With less than twominutes remaining, however, and with Virginia Tech having used all its timeouts, the only chance for the Hokies was to attempt a difficult onside <b>kick.</b> <b>A</b> successful recovery would give the Hokies another chance on offense. Kicker Brandon Pace teed up the ball, and kicked it forwards, bouncing the ball high into the air to create a jump ball situation. Virginia Tech's Xavier Adibi recovered the ball, but because the kick had only traveled nineyards before the recovery, the ball was awarded to Florida State. NCAA rules state that an onside kick must travel at least 10yards before the kicking team can legally touch the ball, and Pace's kick had not traveled the requisite distance.|$|E
5|$|In the Trojans' {{first home}} {{game of the}} season they faced the Arkansas Razorbacks, led by eighth–year head coach Houston Nutt and quarterback Robert Johnson. Bush opened the scoring for the Trojans with a 76-yard rush. The Razorbacks {{answered}} with a touchdown pass by Johnson, however, Leinart scored three touchdowns, two passing and one rushing, {{before the end of the}} quarter. In the second quarter the Razorbacks were able to <b>kick</b> <b>a</b> field goal before the Trojans scored two more touchdowns on a rush by LenDale White and a third pass by Leinart. Going into the half the Trojans led 42–10. In the third quarter, White rushed for his second touchdown and Leinart threw a fourth before the Trojan starters were taken out of the game. Booty threw his second touchdown of the season in the fourth quarter before backup quarterback Alex Mortensen threw a touchdown for the Razorbacks. Third-string Trojan quarterback Mike McDonald threw a 4-yard touchdown to end the game, giving the Trojans a 70–17 win and a 24-game winning streak.|$|E

5|$|The bicycle kick retains popular appeal; Hesse and Simpson {{highlight}} the positive impact a successful bicycle kick has on player notability, and the United States Soccer Federation {{describes it as}} an iconic embellishment of the sport. Defender Marcelo Balboa's bicycle kick in the 1994 FIFA World Cup match between Colombia and the United States received much praise and is even credited with boosting the sport's popularity in the United States. According to former Manchester City defender Paul Lake, a notable bicycle kick performed by English left winger Dennis Tueart in the English Premier League injured hundreds of fans who tried to emulate it. When Italian striker Mario Balotelli, during his youth development years, tried to pattern his skills on those of Brazilian midfielder Ronaldinho and French midfielder Zinedine Zidane, he fixated on the bicycle kick. The manoeuvre is also admired in variants of association football, such as beach soccer and futsal. An action like the bicycle kick is also used in sepak takraw, a sport {{whose objective is to}} <b>kick</b> <b>a</b> ball over a net and into the opposing team's side.|$|E
5|$|Though {{hampered}} {{by the need to}} work inside his own end zone, Marcus Vick completed an 11-yard pass to tight end Jeff King for a first down. The play was the sole positive gain for the VT offense, however, and Virginia Tech was forced into its sixth punt of the game. The kick was a poor one, and traveled only 28yards before flying out of bounds. Thanks to the bad kick, Weatherford was able to start his offense inside Virginia Tech territory, and took advantage of the situation. On the first play after the punt, Weatherford completed a 41-yard throw downfield to Willie Reid, who hauled in the ball at the Virginia Tech three-yard line to give the Seminoles a first and goal. After a failed quarterback sneak, however, Florida State was penalized 10yards for holding and Weatherford was sacked for a loss of threeyards on the next play. Although unable to cross the goal line for a touchdown, FSU did send in kicker Gary Cismesia for his second field goal attempt of the day. The <b>kick,</b> <b>a</b> 41-yarder, was good and gave Florida State a 203 lead with 4:23 remaining in the third quarter.|$|E
5|$|Vick {{passed for}} six yards, then ran {{an option for}} 12yards and a first down. Now on State's side of the field, however, the Tech offense was unable to gain another first down and punted back to Florida State, which {{returned}} the kick to its 21-yard line. State was stopped short on consecutive plays, committed a five-yard false start penalty, then was stopped for no gain on third down. After going three and out, State punted back to the Hokies, who returned {{the ball to the}} Seminoles' 41-yard line. On the first play of the drive, Vick completed a 26-yard pass to the Tech fullback, Hawkins. After three rushes failed to pick up the first down at the Florida State five-yard line, Tech coach Frank Beamer sent in Graham to <b>kick</b> <b>a</b> 23-yard field goal. The kick was successful, and with 7:54 remaining in the quarter, Tech cut Florida State's lead to 2817.|$|E
