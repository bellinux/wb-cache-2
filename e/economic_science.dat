5|$|A {{cause and}} effect {{methodology}} led to a relatively value-free approach to <b>economic</b> <b>science,</b> in which Cantillon was uninterested in the merit of any particular economic action or phenomenon, focusing rather on the explanation of relationships. This led Cantillon to separate <b>economic</b> <b>science</b> from politics and ethics {{to a greater degree}} than previous mercantilist writers. This has led to disputes on whether Cantillon can justly be considered a mercantilist or one of the first anti-mercantilists, given that Cantillon often cited government-manipulated trade surpluses and specie accumulation as positive economic stimuli. Others argue that in instances where Cantillon is thought to have supported certain mercantilist policies, he actually provided a more neutral analysis by explicitly stating possible limitations of mercantilist policies.|$|E

25|$|Neoclassical {{economics}} {{studies the}} behaviour of individuals, households, and organizations (called economic actors, players, or agents), when they manage or use scarce resources, which have alternative uses, to achieve desired ends. Agents {{are assumed to}} act rationally, have multiple desirable ends in sight, limited resources to obtain these ends, a set of stable preferences, a definite overall guiding objective, and the capability of making a choice. There exists an economic problem, subject to study by <b>economic</b> <b>science,</b> when a decision (choice) is made {{by one or more}} resource-controlling players to attain the best possible outcome under bounded rational conditions. In other words, resource-controlling agents maximize value subject to the constraints imposed by the information the agents have, their cognitive limitations, and the finite amount of time they have to make and execute a decision. <b>Economic</b> <b>science</b> centres on the activities of the economic agents that comprise society. They are the focus of economic analysis.|$|E

500|$|Although {{there is}} {{evidence}} that Richard Cantillon wrote a wide variety of manuscripts, only his Essai Sur La Nature Du Commerce En Général (abbreviated Essai) survives. Written in 1730, it was published in French in 1755, and was translated into English by Henry Higgs in 1932. Evidence suggests that Essai had tremendous influence on the early development of <b>economic</b> <b>science.</b> However, Cantillon's treatise was largely neglected during the 19th century. In the late 19th century and it was [...] "rediscovered" [...] by William Stanley Jevons, who considered it the [...] "cradle of political economy". Since then, Cantillon's Essai has received growing attention. Essai is considered the first complete treatise on economic theory, and Cantillon has been called the [...] "father of enterprise economics".|$|E

2500|$|Thus, if {{a person}} has several options, you can {{calculate}} the opportunity cost of choosing one. But can we calculate a universal opportunity cost, which would include all the options? The prevailing opinion was that the opportunity cost could not be applied outside of cases of limited resources. This led some economists to limit the object of economics to [...] "exceptional" [...] resource situations (an idea still present in all economics textbooks). Still unknown are the consequences that might follow from an <b>economic</b> <b>science</b> that has no fixed limits outside of the economic system, in terms of availability of goods.|$|E

2500|$|Paul Krugman, {{who later}} won the Nobel Memorial Prize in <b>Economic</b> <b>Science,</b> in 1994 downplayed Galbraith's stature as an {{academic}} economist. In Peddling Prosperity, he places Galbraith as one among many [...] "policy entrepreneurs" [...] – either economists, or think tank writers, left and right – who write solely for the public, {{as opposed to those}} who write for other academics, and who are, therefore, liable to make unwarranted diagnoses and offer over-simplistic answers to complex economic problems. Krugman asserts that Galbraith was never taken seriously by fellow academics, who instead viewed him as more of a [...] "media personality". For example, Krugman believes that Galbraith's work, The New Industrial State, is not considered to be [...] "real economic theory", and that Economics in Perspective is [...] "remarkably ill-informed".|$|E
2500|$|At {{the dawn}} {{as a social}} science, {{economics}} was defined and discussed at length as the study of production, distribution, and consumption of wealth by Jean-Baptiste Say in his Treatise on Political Economy or, The Production, Distribution, and Consumption of Wealth (1803). These three items are considered by the science only {{in relation to the}} increase or diminution of wealth, and not in reference to their processes of execution. Say's definition has prevailed up to our time, saved by substituting the word [...] "wealth" [...] for [...] "goods and services" [...] meaning that wealth may include non-material objects as well. One hundred and thirty years later, Lionel Robbins noticed that this definition no longer sufficed, because many economists were making theoretical and philosophical inroads in other areas of human activity. In his Essay on the Nature and Significance of <b>Economic</b> <b>Science,</b> he proposed a definition of economics as a study of a particular aspect of human behaviour, the one that falls under the influence of scarcity, which forces people to choose, allocate scarce resources to competing ends, and economize (seeking the greatest welfare while avoiding the wasting of scarce resources). For Robbins, the insufficiency was solved, and his definition allows us to proclaim, with an easy conscience, education economics, safety and security economics, health economics, war economics, and of course, production, distribution and consumption economics as valid subjects of the economic science." ...|$|E
2500|$|Arthur M. Diamond argues Hayek's {{problems}} arise {{when he goes}} beyond claims that can be evaluated within <b>economic</b> <b>science.</b> Diamond argued that: “The human mind, Hayek says, is not just limited {{in its ability to}} synthesize a vast array of concrete facts, it is also limited in its ability to give a deductively sound ground to ethics. Here is where the tension develops, for he also wants to give a reasoned moral defense of the free market. He is an intellectual skeptic who wants to give political philosophy a secure intellectual foundation. It is thus not too surprising that what results is confused and contradictory.” Chandran Kukathas argues that Hayek's defence of liberalism is unsuccessful because it rests on presuppositions that are incompatible. The unresolved dilemma of his political philosophy is how to mount a systematic defence of liberalism if one emphasizes the limited capacity of reason. Norman P. Barry similarly notes that the “critical rationalism” in Hayek’s writings appears incompatible with “a certain kind of fatalism, that we must wait for evolution to pronounce its verdict.” Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz argue that the element of paradox exists in the views of Hayek. Noting Hayek's vigorous defense of [...] "invisible hand" [...] evolution that Hayek claimed has created better economic institutions than could be created by rational design, Friedman pointed out the irony that Hayek was then proposing to replace the monetary system thus created with a deliberate construct of his own design. Also, John N. Gray summarized this view as [...] "his scheme for an ultra-liberal constitution was a prototypical version of the philosophy he had attacked." [...] Bruce Caldwell wrote: [...] "If one is judging his work against the standard of whether he provided a finished political philosophy, Hayek clearly did not succeed," [...] although he thinks that [...] "economists may find Hayek's political writings useful." ...|$|E
