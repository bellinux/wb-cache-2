500|$|The {{committee}} {{keeps the}} list of species it considers under review and, from time to time, makes changes. These are usually because species have increased in frequency and no longer meet the numerical criteria for inclusion. A species is removed if {{it has more than}} 150 records in the preceding ten years, with ten or more in at least eight of those years. Different criteria were used in a review in 2006 (see below). [...] There have been three major [...] "purges" [...] of species since the committee's formation. The first was soon after the committee's formation, in 1963, when 16 species were removed: red-crested pochard, snow goose, pectoral sandpiper, Mediterranean gull, Sabine's gull, melodious warbler, <b>icterine</b> <b>warbler,</b> yellow-browed warbler, northern goshawk, golden eagle, red kite, Kentish plover, crested tit, bearded tit, marsh warbler and Dartford warbler. Records of the last eight species had been considered only outside their [...] "normal" [...] British range (e.g. crested tits outside Scotland, and red kites outside Wales). The second was in 1982, when ten further species were removed: Cory's shearwater, purple heron, white stork, buff-breasted sandpiper, Richard's pipit, tawny pipit, Savi's warbler, aquatic warbler, serin and common rosefinch. Savi's warbler was re-admitted to the committee's list in 1998, due to declining numbers of occurrences. Thirdly, in 2006, a further 17 species were dropped from the list: ferruginous duck, Wilson’s petrel, great white egret, black kite, red-footed falcon, American golden plover, white-rumped sandpiper, white-winged black tern, alpine swift, red-rumped swallow, red-throated pipit, subalpine warbler, greenish warbler, dusky warbler, Radde's warbler, Arctic redpoll and rustic bunting. Their selection was based on different criteria from those previously used: more than 200 records in Britain ever, and more than 100 occasions in the last decade.|$|E

50|$|The <b>icterine</b> <b>warbler</b> (Hippolais icterina) is an Old World warbler in {{the tree}} warbler genus Hippolais. It breeds in {{mainland}} Europe except the southwest, where it is replaced by its western counterpart, melodious warbler. It is migratory, wintering in sub-Saharan Africa.|$|E
5000|$|This is a {{medium-sized}} warbler, 12 to 13 cm in length, and similar to its eastern counterpart, the <b>icterine</b> <b>warbler</b> (Hippolais icterina). The adult has a plain brown back and wings, and yellowish underparts. Compared to the <b>icterine</b> <b>warbler,</b> the upper parts are rather browner and the under parts rather yellower. The bill {{is strong and}} pointed and the legs are brown. The sexes are identical, as with most warblers, but young birds are paler on the belly. The song is a pleasant babbling. Compared {{to that of the}} icterine it is more fluent and sustained but much less varied, and it does not include mimicked sounds. Other vocalisations include a rattling [...] "trrrr", which resembles a house sparrow, a quiet [...] "tuk" [...] and a chattering [...] "chret-chet".|$|E
5000|$|Icterine [...] is a colour, {{described}} as yellowish, jaundice-yellow or marked with yellow. It {{is derived from}} Ancient Greek ikteros (jaundice), via the Latin ictericus. [...] It is used as an adjective {{in the names of}} birds with yellowish plumage to describe their appearance, including the <b>icterine</b> <b>warbler</b> and icterine greenbul.|$|E
50|$|This is a {{medium-sized}} warbler, similar {{in size to}} the <b>icterine</b> <b>warbler,</b> with a slightly longer bill and shorter wings and a longer tail. Its frequent tail movement is reminiscent of a Sylvia warbler or a chat. Its rather grey plumage {{is similar to the}} olivaceous warbler, but tail movements are diagnostic.|$|E
50|$|The <b>icterine</b> <b>warbler</b> is a bird of {{woodland}} {{rather than}} forest, preferring woodland edge or glades, favouring the crowns of well spaced trees with tall undergrowth. Prefers broad leafed trees, {{but may be}} found in conifers mixed with broad leafed trees. Will use copses, orchards, parks, gardens, shelterbelts and tall hedges interspersed with trees.|$|E
50|$|Other birds {{found in}} Järveküla Nature Reserve include: the Barn swallow (the {{national}} bird of Estonia), Eurasian wryneck, Eurasian golden oriole, <b>Icterine</b> <b>warbler,</b> River warbler, Spotted flycatcher, Eurasian tree sparrow, Common chaffinch, European greenfinch, European pied flycatcher, Eurasian skylark, Fieldfare, White wagtail, Yellowhammer, Hooded crow, Garden warbler, Grey heron, Eurasian blue tit, Eurasian blackcap, Common rosefinch, European goldfinch and Common chiffchaff among others.|$|E
50|$|Some {{rare and}} {{endangered}} species live all year round on the Enz, which is an important resting stop for many migratory birds. These include, inter alia, kingfisher, sandpiper, goosander, grey wagtail, moorhen and dipper. Other guests and residents of the coppiced willows and the trees lining {{the banks of the}} river are white wagtail, <b>Icterine</b> <b>warbler,</b> spotted flycatcher, nightingale and golden oriole.|$|E
50|$|The <b>icterine</b> <b>warbler</b> {{is mainly}} insectivorous but will feed on fruit in late summer. It forages amomng the foliage taking insects {{either on the}} leaves or fluttering, will flycatch. In general it is clumsier than the smaller but superficially similar Phylloscopus warblers. Rather solitary and it is {{territorial}} on both the breeding and wintering grounds. Four to six eggs are laid in a nest in a tree or a bush.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>icterine</b> <b>warbler</b> has {{the most}} northerly and {{widespread}} distribution of the four Hippolais species, its breeding range extends from northern France and Norway through most of northern and eastern Europe, south {{as far as the}} northern Balkans mountains and Crimea mountains eastwards in a narrowing band to the River Ob. It has bred in Scotland recently but it is normally a passage migrant in Great Britain and Ireland ...|$|E

40|$|In spring, long-distance {{migrants}} {{are considered}} to adopta time-minimizing strategy to promote early arrival atbreeding sites. The phenology of spring migration wasexamined and compared between two insular stopoversites in Greece and Sweden for <b>Icterine</b> <b>Warbler,</b> WoodWarbler, Spotted Flycatcher and Collared Flycatcher. All  of them migrate due north which means that some proportion of birds that pass through Greece are headingto Scandinavia. The Collared Flycatcher had the earliestand the <b>Icterine</b> <b>Warbler</b> the latest arrival time. Thedifferences in median dates between Greece and Swedenwere 3 – 4 weeks and the passages in Sweden weregenerally more condensed in time. The average overallspeed estimates were very similar and varied between 129 and 137 km/d. In most of the species higher speedestimates were associated with years when birds arrivedlate in Greece. After crossing continental Europe birdsarrive at the Swedish study site with significantly higherbody masses compared to when they arrive in Greece andthis might indicate a preparation for arriving at breedinggrounds with some overload...|$|E
40|$|Migratory birds use {{stopover}} {{sites for}} resting and feeding. Breaks after prolonged flights may allow cooling down the muscles and save energy through hypothermia. We measured hypothermic abilities in two long-distance migratory songbirds (garden warbler, Sylvia borin, and <b>icterine</b> <b>warbler,</b> Hippolais polyglotta) at a stopover site during spring migration selecting (1) birds just arrived after a prolonged flight (morning) (2) birds {{that had been}} resting in the vegetation for several hours (afternoon) and (3) birds caught {{in the late afternoon}} and kept overnight in standard conditions (night). In the first two samples, body temperature was measured immediately, 30 and 180 min after capture. In the night sample, it was measured at 1 a. m. in birds awake and asleep, and at 7 a. m., when all birds were awake. Morning birds showed the highest values (39. 7 A degrees C), dropping of about 3 A degrees C after 180 min. In the afternoon birds (2), the time course was similar, but values (38. 5 A degrees C) were lower than that of morning birds of about 1 A degrees C. At night, asleep birds had lower temperature than awake birds, reaching up to 10 A degrees C less than daytime values, but recovering in the early morning. Such remarkable plasticity in thermogenic abilities during migration could allow small migrants to economize energy in emergency situations...|$|E
