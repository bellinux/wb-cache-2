5|$|In the 1860s {{plans were}} laid for a deep-water harbour on the {{northern}} shore of Brean <b>Down.</b> <b>It</b> was intended that this harbour would replace Bristol as a port on embarkation for transatlantic crossings and the export of minerals and agricultural produce from the Mendip Hills {{and the rest of}} Somerset.|$|E

It may even divide the rights to use a mark within a particular city by reference to roads or other landmarks in that city.|$|E

5|$|In 1664 {{the mill}} {{partially}} burned <b>down.</b> <b>It</b> was rebuilt and, {{in order to}} recover from the losses, the miller did not have to pay taxes for the next 15 years. In 1764 another fire destroyed the entire mill, according to an ordenance from the States General after the miller requested assistance. The mill was rebuilt {{with the addition of a}} second water wheel. The larger building was a gristmill and the smaller building an oil mill. In 1909 a sawmill was added to the larger building, and for a period the smaller building also acted as a fulling mill.|$|E
5|$|In 1745, Crossford Bridge– which dated back to {{at least}} 1367– was torn <b>down.</b> <b>It</b> {{was one of a}} series of bridges {{crossing}} the River Mersey destroyed by order of the government, to slow the advance of Jacobite forces during the Jacobite rising. The Jacobites repaired the bridge upon reaching Manchester, and used it to send a small force into Sale and Altrincham. Their intention was to deceive the authorities into believing that the Jacobites were heading for Chester. The feint was successful and the main Jacobite army later marched south through Cheadle and Stockport instead.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, Titterton {{stepped down}} as Director of the Research School of Physical Sciences, and became an {{ordinary}} professor. Once again he spearheaded a proposal to upgrade the department's equipment, this time by using the tandem as an injector for a superconducting linear accelerator. Unable to secure funding in Australia, he managed to persuade the British Science Research Council to donate the required equipment to the ANU from facilities in England that were being closed <b>down.</b> <b>It</b> was installed and commissioned after his death. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George on 1 January 1957, and was created a knight bachelor on 1 January 1970.|$|E

5|$|Kepler was {{the first}} to devise a system that {{described}} correctly the details of the motion of the planets with the Sun at the center. However, Kepler did not succeed in formulating a theory behind the laws he wrote <b>down.</b> <b>It</b> was left to Newton's invention of celestial dynamics and his law of gravitation to finally explain the motions of the planets. Newton also developed the reflecting telescope.|$|E
5|$|Like other bird-hipped dinosaurs of the Dinosaur Park Formation, Gryposaurus {{appears to}} have only existed {{for part of the}} {{duration}} of time that the rocks were being formed. As the formation was being laid <b>down,</b> <b>it</b> recorded a change to more marine-influenced conditions. Gryposaurus is absent from {{the upper part of the}} formation, with Prosaurolophus present instead. Other dinosaurs known from only the lower part of the formation include the horned Centrosaurus and the hollow-crested duckbill Corythosaurus. Gryposaurus may have preferred river-related settings.|$|E
5|$|The Hokies {{began the}} second quarter in {{possession}} of the ball and facing a second down and one yard. After the Tech offense picked up one first <b>down,</b> <b>it</b> was unable to gain another. Facing a fourth down and needing fiveyards for a first down at the Air Force 29-yard line, Tech head coach Frank Beamer elected to try to gain the first down instead of trying a long field goal. Bryan Randall was sacked for a loss of 10yards, however, and the Hokies turned the ball over to Air Force after failing to gain the first down.|$|E

5|$|The {{island is}} formed of Carboniferous Limestone {{and is often}} {{described}} as geologically a continuation of the Mendip Hills at Brean Down; however, the dip is at a different angle to that on Brean Down. On Steep Holm the dip is about 30 degrees to the north whereas at Brean <b>Down</b> <b>it</b> is 30 degrees to the south. There are some folds and fractures with dip angles up to 75 degrees created during the final phases of the Variscan orogeny {{near the end of the}} Carboniferous Period, 300million years ago.|$|E
5|$|Coatbridge {{was given}} burgh status in 1885, and {{was granted a}} coat of arms by the Lord Lyon in 1892. The arms have a black field and on it a flaming tower to {{represent}} a blast furnace and Coatbridge's industrial tradition. The crest is a monk holding a stone in his left hand. The stone relates to the old parish of Monklands and {{the legend of the}} 'aul' Kirk stane'. The legend of the 'aul' Kirk stane' is that a pilgrim undertaking a penance from Glasgow carried a stone in the direction of Monklands. When he could carry the stone no further (or in another version of the legend, when an angel spoke to him) he laid the stone <b>down.</b> <b>It</b> was where the stone came to rest that he was to build a church. The church is the present day Old Monkland Kirk, at which the stone can still be seen.|$|E
5|$|Each time a {{successful}} attack is performed on a player, their health meter depletes. Players with low health stay stunned for longer when knocked down. A player can increase their health {{by picking up}} food items that randomly appear in the ring. Running and attacks drain stamina. If a player {{does not have enough}} stamina to perform a certain move, it becomes unavailable until they recover. Stamina is regained through not pressing the actions buttons or picking up certain items. Attacks which require more stamina are generally more effective. The stun meter only appears when the opponent is knocked <b>down.</b> <b>It</b> depletes gradually, but the stunned player cannot move until the Stun meter is completely drained. A player can reduce the stun meter faster by pressing the action buttons, or by receiving certain attacks. If a player is low on health, the stun meter will normally be higher, making pin attempts harder to resist. Once a player's health is completely depleted, it will only take one hit to stun them. Certain attacks to a stunned opponent will actually reset the stun meter.|$|E

5|$|In 2002, CenturyLink Field {{became the}} first stadium in the NFL to install a FieldTurf {{artificial}} field. The surface is made of plastic fibers rooted {{in a mixture of}} ground rubber and sand. The field was replaced in the spring of 2008 after tests showed that compression of the sand and rubber increased the risk of player injuries. FieldTurf won the bid for the second installation over Polytan. For the replacement surface, a one-inch (two and one-half centimeters) poured rubber foundation was added to prevent the compression from reoccurring. Under the naming rights agreement, Qwest paid $500,000 for the installation and First & Goal paid the remaining amount, which was undisclosed. By 2010 the FieldTurf's quality had decreased with the blades becoming matted <b>down.</b> <b>It</b> also failed FIFA's quality testing to be ranked 2 Star. A new FieldTurf surface was laid down in 2012 and it met the requirements of a 2 Star field after testing.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{exited the}} mass of {{aircraft}} and was immediately attacked by three Bf 109s. The closest was 100 yards away. Maintaining a steep, tight, spiralling turn, he dived into cloud and immediately headed for Dover. Coming out of the cloud, Johnson saw a lone Bf 109. Suspecting it {{to be one of}} the three that had chased him, he searched for the other two. Seeing nothing, Johnson attacked and shot it <b>down.</b> <b>It</b> was his fourth victory. Johnson ended his month's tally by adding a probable victory on 21 August. But it had been a bad day and month for the Wing. The much loathed Circus and Rhubarb raids had cost Fighter Command 108 fighters. The Germans lost just 18. On 4 September 1941 Johnson was promoted to flight lieutenant and awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC).|$|E
5|$|Making {{matters worse}} for the defenders, any {{aircraft}} that braved the weather and attempted to land was subject to North Vietnamese anti-aircraft fire on its way in for a landing. Once the aircraft touched <b>down,</b> <b>it</b> became the target of any number of NVA artillery or mortar crews. The aircrew then {{had to contend with}} anti-aircraft fire on the way out. As a result, 65 percent of all supplies were delivered by paradrops delivered by C-130 aircraft, mostly by the US Air Force, whose crews had significantly more experience in airdrop tactics than Marine air crews. The most dramatic supply delivery system used at Khe Sanh was the Low Altitude Parachute Extraction System (LAPES), in which palletized supplies were pulled out of the cargo bay of a low-flying transport aircraft by means of an attached parachute. The pallet slid to a halt on the airstrip while the aircraft never had to actually land. The US Air Force delivered 14,356 tons of supplies to Khe Sanh by air (8,120 tons by paradrop). 1st Marine Aircraft Wing records claim that the unit delivered 4,661 tons of cargo into KSCB.|$|E

5|$|O'Sullivan {{began the}} 2016/2017 season late, at the Shanghai Masters. In the first round, he {{defeated}} Liang Wenbo 5–4 after recovering from 1–4 <b>down.</b> <b>It</b> {{was his first}} professional tournament match in five months. However, this {{was as far as}} he progressed, as in the second round he lost by 2–5 to Michael Holt. Competing in the inaugural European Masters, O'Sullivan defeated David Gilbert 4–1 in the first round, Mark Allen 4–2 in the second round, Mark Davis 4–1 in the quarterfinals and then whitewashed Neil Robertson 6–0 in the semi-final. Facing Judd Trump in the final, O'Sullivan took a 5–3 lead after the first session. In the second session, O'Sullivan further led 8–6 before eventually losing 8–9. In the first of the Home Nations series of tournaments, at the inaugural English Open, O'Sullivan defeated Jimmy Robertson 4–0 in the first round, Zhao Xintong 4–3 in the second, but then lost to Chris Wakelin in the third by 3–4. At the International Championship, O'Sullivan beat Xiao Guodong 6–4 in the first round and Kurt Maflin 6–4 in the second to reach the last 16. However, he was then defeated by Michael Holt 4–6, making this the third consecutive loss to Holt in 2016.|$|E
5|$|On 15 April Cunningham was to {{have his}} most {{successful}} night, shooting down three bombers (victories no. 8–10). On patrol near the south coast he engaged a He 111 over Monmouthshire which he shot down with only 40 rounds. He returned to Middle Wallop only to be sent on patrol for a second sortie. He took off and headed south, towards Southampton. GCI {{was too busy to}} employ him and he was granted a request to investigate a searchlight cone towards Marlborough. Rawnsley directed him to attack and he duly shot down the He 111 which crashed into derelict houses in Southampton. He was sent by GCI after another enemy but lost the contact, appearing over Southampton again he spotted yet another He 111 in the moonlight. He closed to 80 yards and shot it <b>down.</b> <b>It</b> crashed in the area of Lymington. Cunningham's 9th victory was Werknummer 2857, code G1+ES, belonging to 8./KG 55. The Heinkel, piloted by Oberleutnant Günther von Seidlitz, crashed onto No. 10-12 Padwell Road, Southampton at 02:00. Seidlitz and Feldwebel Franz Hümmer were killed in action and Unteroffizier Horst Rosenberg and Herbert Sauer were taken prisoner of war. In April, having downed at least 10 enemy aircraft in night-fighting operations, Cunningham was decorated with his first Distinguished Service Order (DSO).|$|E
5|$|On April 23, 2008 the Cubs {{won for the}} 10,000th time in {{the history}} of the {{franchise}} on the road against the Colorado Rockies. Like the 9,000th win, the 10,000th win came in a 76 victory at Coors Field. The Cubs were the second franchise to achieve 10,000 regular season wins; the San Francisco Giants/New York Giants were the first. The franchise flew a special 10,000th win flag along with a Cubs Win flag to commemorate the landmark achievement for the franchise. This was unusual not just for the 10,000th win, but also for flying the flag in reference to a road game. The special flag flew from the afternoon of April 24, 2008 until immediately prior to the next home game on April 29, 2008 at 7:05pm against the Milwaukee Brewers. After the flag was taken <b>down,</b> <b>it</b> was autographed by all members of the 2008 Chicago Cubs and auctioned off for charity.|$|E
