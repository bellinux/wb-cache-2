5|$|Task Force Kean {{launched}} its attack on August 7, moving out from Masan, but Kean's offensive had collided {{in a meeting}} engagement with one being simultaneously delivered by the North Koreans. Heavy fighting continued {{in the area for}} three days. By August 9, Task Force Kean was poised to retake Chinju. The Americans initially advanced quickly though North Korean resistance was heavy. On August 10, the Marines picked up the advance. However, the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade was withdrawn from the force on August 12 to be redeployed <b>elsewhere</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> perimeter. Task Force Kean continued forward, capturing the area around Chondong-ni. Eighth Army requested several of its units to redeploy to Taegu to be used <b>elsewhere</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> front, particularly at the Naktong Bulge.|$|E

In 1926 the gasworks closed and was replaced by an electrical generator <b>elsewhere</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Waddesdon Manor grounds, and the track of the spur was removed.|$|E
5|$|Because of his {{leadership}} at Yarmouk, Khalid ibn al-Walid {{is considered one}} of the finest generals in history and his use of mounted warriors throughout the battle showed just how well he understood the potential strengths and weaknesses of his mounted troops.

5|$|During the Second World War Waterloo {{station and}} the nearby Thames bridges were a {{significant}} target for Axis bombing, and there were several near-misses on the Necropolis station during the London Blitz of 1940–41.

5|$|Heavy {{fighting}} {{continued in}} the area for three days. By 9 August, Task Force Kean was poised to retake Chinju. The task force, aided by air power, initially advanced quickly though North Korean resistance was heavy. On 10 August, the Marines picked up the advance, inadvertently encountering the North Korean 83rd Motorized Regiment of the 105th Armored Division, which was caught off-guard and attempted to withdraw. F4U Corsairs from the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing strafed the retreating column repeatedly, inflicting 200 casualties and destroying about 100 of the regiment's equipment vehicles, but 1st Provisional Marine Brigade forces were not able to follow up the attack, as they were redeployed <b>elsewhere</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> perimeter on 12 August. Task Force Kean continued forward, supported by field artillery, capturing the area around Chondong-ni. At that time, Eighth Army requested several of its units to redeploy to Taegu to be used <b>elsewhere</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> front, particularly at the Naktong Bulge.|$|E

5|$|All {{described}} {{specimens of}} Sinosauropteryx preserve integumentary structures (filaments {{arising from the}} skin) which most palaeontologists interpret as very primitive type of feathers. These short, down-like filaments are preserved along the back half of the skull, the arms, neck, back, and {{top and bottom of}} the tail. Additional patches of feathers have been identified {{on the sides of the}} body, and palaeontologists Chen, Dong and Zheng proposed that the density of the feathers on the back and the randomness of the patches <b>elsewhere</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> body indicated the animals would have been fully feathered in life, with the ventral feathers having been removed by decomposition.|$|E

During the night of 16–17 April 1941, in one of the last major air raids on London, bombs repeatedly fell on the Waterloo area. The rolling stock berthed in the Necropolis siding was burned, and the railway arch connecting the main line to the Necropolis terminus was damaged, but the terminal building itself remained unscathed.|$|E
5|$|<b>Elsewhere</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Camp, the Army began {{replacing}} the wartime Nissen huts with more permanent structures. New barracks opened in 1955, and the Headquarters of the Army in Scotland arrived {{the same year}} from Edinburgh Castle. Further land was purchased from Lord Rosebery and married quarters were built close to the river. In 1966, a purpose-built office block, by architects Bowhill Gibson and Laing, was constructed within the walled garden, and named Annandale Block in honour of the builder of Craigiehall. Craigiehall Camp was also {{the site of a}} Cold War Anti-Aircraft Operations Room, built in the 1950s. The two-storey, reinforced concrete structure was listed in 2016 as the best surviving example of its type in Scotland.|$|E
