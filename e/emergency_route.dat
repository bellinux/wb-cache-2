To implement large scale emergency goods distribution effectively according to demand, the routes logistics optimization model among multi supply places and multi demand places under large scale emergency incident is established. Several preconditions {{of the model}} are given, the optimization objectives include that <b>emergency</b> <b>routes</b> should be selected along the largest emergency goods flow direction, the curve degree of <b>emergency</b> <b>routes</b> should be minimized, the burden of <b>emergency</b> <b>routes</b> should be balance, and the repeat parameter of emergency network should be minimized as far as possible. Some constraints such as transportation quantity, length, curve degree of <b>emergency</b> <b>routes,</b> avoiding of isolated point and the number limit of <b>emergency</b> <b>routes</b> are considered. Above multi-objective non-linear programming model is transferred, and its solving method by GA is designed. The emergency logistics problem within one certain typical region is taken as the research instance, {{the validity of the}} model and its solving algorithm is validated. The obtained calculation result shows that, under the precondition of meeting the emergency routes&# 39; length and flow quantity, the emergency network performances such as repeat parameter, route exchanging times per transportation, number of isolated nodes, burden balance degree of <b>emergency</b> <b>routes,</b> average curve degree of <b>emergency</b> <b>routes</b> are satisfied. Under large <b>emergency</b> incidents, above <b>routes</b> optimization model and algorithm will benefit for improving efficiency and precision of emergency logistics, and its maneuverability is strong.

40|$|The {{occurrence}} {{of a strong}} earthquake in Indiana or neighboring states, as {{has occurred in the}} past, has serious implications for the State Transportation System with respect to adequate response. The definition of Earthquake <b>Emergency</b> <b>Routes</b> for the State of Indiana became a priority for the Indiana Department of Transportation. These <b>Emergency</b> <b>Routes</b> take into account various aspects related to transportation including coverage of population and area and travel time along these routes, and issues related to structural and geotechnical seismic vulnerability of the roads and bridges along these routes. Part I of the overall study report formulates a multi-commodity maximal covering network design problem (MCNDP) for identifying critical routes, for earthquake response and to seismically retrofit bridges. In the MCNDP, routes are sought that minimize the total travel time over the selected routes and maximize the total population covered, subject to a budget constraint on bridge retrofitting costs on the selected routes. The problem is formulated as a twoobjective integer programming model and solved using the branch-and-cut module in the CPLEX optimizer. The model performance is analyzed using the transportation network in southwest Indiana. A problem reduction strategy is introduced to reduce computational times by recognizing that the critical routes are not usually circuitous. Thereby, the search for the critical routes for an origin-destination (O-D) pair is confined to a limited geographical region around it. To further reduce computational costs, the formulation is extended to incorporate valid inequalities that exploit the problem structure. Simulation studies are conducted to investigate the effects of varying the budget and the relative weights of the two objectives. Noninferior frontiers that illustrate the trade-offs between the conflicting objectives for different budgets are constructed to provide practical insights to decision-makers. The final selected routes in addition include constraints set by the Study Advisory Committee regarding specific roads {{to be included in the}} final set. Part II of the study report covers the structural and geotechnical seismic issues related to the definition of Earthquake <b>Emergency</b> <b>Routes</b> for the State of Indiana. Previous worldwide experience on bridge damage during strong earthquakes has influenced the bridge earthquake design specifications and mitigation procedures. The evolution of the relevant requirements in the AASHTO Specifications and the existence of a proposed draft seismic design specification under development as part of the NCHRP Project 12 - 49 have significant implications in the assessment of the existing vulnerability, its mitigation, and the design of new bridges along the <b>Emergency</b> <b>Routes.</b> Geographical Information System (GIS) was implemented to assist the evaluation of seismic vulnerability of the proposed Indiana <b>Emergency</b> <b>Routes.</b> Using the available information, the GIS implementation may be used for mitigation of vulnerability, simulation, and response to a strong earthquake in Indiana incorporating information from the Indiana Department of Transportation (Indot) maintenance database and selected structural and geotechnical information from the relevant bridge drawings. Findings from a vulnerability assessment as well as final calibration performed using selected representative bridge data such as drawings and soil exploration descriptions are also reported. Vulnerability was evaluated for different levels of ground acceleration in order to obtain behavior patterns for selected bridges and to illustrate upgrade needs for the transportation structures on the <b>Emergency</b> <b>Routes.</b> The information contained in this report could be used to assist the engineers in conducting simulations that will help Indot to devise mitigation policies for different earthquake occurrence scenarios and to evaluate potential alternative routes...|$|R

50|$|Allentown {{developed}} quickly {{due to its}} convenient {{location to}} downtown Pittsburgh as well as due to the available transportation. Two main roads south from Pittsburgh merged on the hilltop in Allentown: Washington Road (today’s Warrington Avenue) and Brownsville Turnpike Road (today’s Arlington Avenue). The neighborhoods were connected at first by horse-drawn streetcars and later by the electric streetcar. In 1888 Allentown became the first site west of the Allegheny Mountains to operate an electric streetcar. Ever since then the trolley, or ‘T’, has run through the neighborhood of Allentown, keeping the hilltop residents connected to downtown Pittsburgh. In the past there were five inclines that served Allentown, {{the most famous of}} which was the curved Knoxville incline with a station at the intersection of Warrington and Arlington.

5000|$|Officials {{feared that}} if the lava flow {{continued}} on its path it will cover over the only route {{in and out of}} lower Puna, Highway 130.

Construction of the Chain of Craters alternate route began by making a path over a wall of lava rock covering the road in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. The $12 million to $15.5 million route, to be re-established between the park and Kalapana as a gravel road, would have been the only road in and out of lower Puna, if the June 27 lava flow had made its way to the sea. The park closed the end of Chain of Craters Road as construction began. Nearly 8 miles of the roadway, officially known as Chain of Craters Road inside the park and Highway 130 outside of it, is covered by past flows from the ongoing Pu'u O'o eruption that threatened Pahoa. Chain of Craters Road, which opened in 1965, had portions blocked or covered by lava for 37 years of its 49-year existence, according to the park. The road is about 19 miles long inside the park. However the 2014 lava flow did not continue further.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} {{the concept and}} the implementation of an <b>Emergency</b> <b>Route</b> Service 3 D (ERS 3 D), {{which is based on}} the already established OGC Standards OpenLS and which further covers the following two aspects: Firstly, the possibility to bypass restricted areas or closed streets during disaster situations and secondly the ability to return a 3 D route geometry that can be integrated into a 3 D application. Within the project OK-GIS (Open and free GIS for Disaster Management) a Route Service based on OpenLS Specifications was implemented. This was then taken as the basis for building more complex services. Based on the initial Route Service an <b>Emergency</b> <b>Route</b> Service (ERS) was developed, along with a 3 D Route Service (3 DRS). The combination of the 3 DRS and the ERS then resulted in a 3 D <b>Emergency</b> <b>Route</b> Service (3 DERS). An impor-tant aspect is that this can be achieved solely using OGC standards, so no further standards need to be specified for this application. Moreover this shows that more complex services can be realized by combining existing OGC services and integrating them into a 3 D spatial data infrastructure. ...|$|E
