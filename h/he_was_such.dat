Sommerfeld taught an {{advanced}} course on differential equations in physics, which Bethe enjoyed. Because <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>such</b> a renowned scholar, Sommerfeld frequently received advance copies of scientific papers, which he put up for discussion at weekly evening seminars. When Bethe arrived, Sommerfeld had just received Erwin Schrödinger's papers on wave mechanics.|$|E
25|$|Power {{lost the}} congressional election, and his trial against Morrison began on Dec. 3, 1924. State Rep. George Lommen {{was the first}} to take the witness stand on Power’s behalf. Morrison had {{attacked}} Lommen in the past, accusing him of collecting bribes from the operators of slot machines, as well as declaring that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>such</b> a flip-flopping “political chameleon,” he would probably end up a Communist.|$|E
25|$|In 1959, James T. Aubrey Jr. {{became the}} {{president}} of CBS. Under Aubrey, the network became the most popular on television with shows like The Beverly Hillbillies and Gilligan's Island. However, Paley's personal favorite was Gunsmoke; in fact, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>such</b> a fan of Gunsmoke that, upon its threatened cancellation in 1967, he demanded that it be reinstated, a dictum {{that led to the}} abrupt demise of Gilligan's Island, which had already been renewed for a fourth season.|$|E

25|$|His {{continued}} unpaid {{promotion of}} Eastern Air Lines {{earned him the}} undying gratitude of good friend Eddie Rickenbacker, the World War I flying ace who {{was the president of}} the airline. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>such</b> a good friend of the airline that Rickenbacker took a retiring Douglas DC-3, fitted it out with an executive interior and DC-4 engines, and presented it to Godfrey, who then used it to commute to the studios in New York City from his huge Leesburg, Virginia, farm every Sunday night.|$|E
25|$|He {{finally came}} to be {{respected}} {{as one of the}} most intelligent cyclists ever, but when he died in 1987 he was still to a large extent one of cycling's greatest enigmas. Raphaël Géminiani knew him better than anyone and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>such</b> a perceptive man that his comments are particularly interesting. He said that Jacques w{{as one of the most}} gifted riders of all time but this was hardly reflected by his record. He had won eight major Tours without once crossing the top of a mountain in the lead. His lack of offensive spirit made Géminiani mad with rage on countless occasions but he was always so incredibly stylish, absolute perfection.|$|E
25|$|Eihei-ji {{is one of}} {{the largest}} Zen {{training}} facilities in Japan, and the abbot at this time was Gempo Kitano-roshi. Prior to coming to Japan, Kitano was head of Soto Zen in Korea. He also was one of the founders of Zenshuji, a Soto Zen temple located in Los Angeles, California. Suzuki's father and Kitano had a tense history between them. Sogaku had trained with Kitano in his early Zen training and felt that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>such</b> a high priest due to familial status and connections. Shunryu did not see this in Kitano, however. He saw a humble man who gave clear instruction, and Shunryu realized that his father was very wrong in his assessment.|$|E

25|$|In his 1914 book, Abenmasarra y su escuela. Orígenes de la filosofía hispano-musulmana, Asín opens by {{describing}} {{the evolution of}} Islamic philosophy and cosmology {{at the center of}} Islamic civilization in the East, in comparison with its later emergence in Al-Andalus (Muslim Iberia). A brief biography of Ibn Masarra (883-931) follows. There Asín posits the continuation of pre-existing Iberian culture among Hispanic natives who, following its conquest, converted to Islam. Because of Abenmasarra's father's client status (to his Berber mawla), Asín infers that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>such</b> a Muslim 'Spaniard' (a muladi). Asín describes his affinity to Greek philosophy, i.e., neoplatonism, then notes the accusations of heresy against him, and that he early concealed his teachings. At that time the Muslim ruler faced severe political unrest, being challenged by armed rebels such as 'Umar ibn Hafsun; accordingly the Emir showed little tolerance for religious dissenters like Abenmasarra. Ibn Masarra felt compelled to flee, traveling to Qairawan and Mecca. Yet eventually he managed to return to Córdoba under the next Emir, and to set up his School which contained sufi elements.|$|E
500|$|Longfellow was {{the most}} popular poet of his day. [...] As a friend once wrote, [...] "no other poet was so fully {{recognized}} in his lifetime". Many of his works helped shape the American character and its legacy, particularly with the poem [...] "Paul Revere's Ride". <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>such</b> an admired figure in the United States during his life that his 70th birthday in 1877 took on the air of a national holiday, with parades, speeches, and the reading of his poetry.|$|E
500|$|Owing to {{the strange}} {{nature of the}} language, the Century 21 writers would brief Unwin on episode plots and then leave space in their scripts for the actor to draft all the Unwinese {{dialogue}} himself.

500|$|Despite their {{appreciation}} of his work, many of Glicken's associates considered him eccentric and highly disorganized. Chatty, noted for being extremely sensitive, Glicken also paid meticulous attention to detail. One {{of his friends}} writes, [...] "Harry was a character his whole life.... Everyone who knew him was amazed <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>such</b> a good scientist." [...] Regarding Glicken's driving habits, the same acquaintance describes him as [...] "a cartoon character" [...] who [...] "would drive at full speed down the road, talking about whatever was important to him, and... come to a four-way stoplight and he'd sail through it, never knowing he'd just gone through".|$|E
500|$|Josh Weinstein has {{expressed}} regret about killing off Grimes after only one episode, describing him as [...] "such an amazing character." [...] In {{an interview with}} The Believer, producer George Meyer said, [...] "Grimes's cardinal sin was that he shined a light on Springfield. He pointed out everything that was wrongheaded and idiotic about that world. And {{the people who do}} that tend to become martyrs. He said things that needed to be said, but once they were said, we needed to destroy that person. I'll admit, we took a certain sadistic glee in his downfall. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>such</b> a righteous person, and that somehow made his demise more satisfying." ...|$|E
500|$|The Pixies {{entered the}} studio again in 1988 {{to record their}} second album Surfer Rosa. Lovering's {{contribution}} on songs such as [...] "Bone Machine" [...] – which begins with a 10-second drum solo – [...] "Break My Body" [...] and [...] "River Euphrates" [...] established his steady, accurate style. Doolittle, the band's major label debut, followed in 1989. During the album's recording sessions, Thompson convinced Lovering to sing on [...] "La La Love You", which had been written as a [...] "dig at {{the very idea of}} a love song". The album's producer Gil Norton later said that during the sessions Lovering [...] "went from not wanting to sing a note to 'I can't get him away from the microphone'. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>such</b> a showman". In addition to drums and vocals, Lovering played bass guitar on the album's penultimate track, [...] "Silver".|$|E

500|$|Fashion {{photographer}} and illustrator Tony Viramontes created the stylized {{cover for the}} new album and the singles Nasty and Control. Jackson said of Viramontes, [...] "He was very creative, and I believe one day his work will be iconic. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>such</b> a joy to work with. I miss him." [...] Author Dean Rhys Morgan in Bold, Beautiful and Damned: The World of Fashion Illustrator Tony Viramontes discusses how Jackson was [...] "transformed from a former child star into an assured fashion forward figure with her trendsetting big hair and severe all black ensemble. Until this point Jackson had been more a reflection than pioneer, more interpreter than innovator. This album was all about Janet and who she wanted to be." [...] Alexander Fury wrote in The Independent, [...] "the artwork created with Eighties illustrator Tony Viramontes for Control stands the test of time." ...|$|E
500|$|Morrison {{signed a}} {{contract}} with Bert Berns, and just before he left for New York made a speech to his friends and ended with: [...] "One day you'll see my picture up on the wall and you'll all say 'I knew him'." [...] An acquaintance who witnessed the speech told the author: [...] "He knew he was different and that his music was good but I thought <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>such</b> a nasty character; always rude and quite vulgar." [...] Morrison recorded the song [...] "Brown Eyed Girl" [...] in New York with Berns, as well as the album Astral Weeks. He became much more popular with the album Moondance, and Rolling Stone commented he had [...] "the striking imagination of a consciousness that is visionary in the strongest sense of the word". Morrison's image appeared on the cover of Rolling Stone a year after releasing Moondance.|$|E
500|$|The {{friendship}} and professional association lasted {{until the end}} of Richardson's life. Gielgud wrote in 1983, [...] "Besides cherishing our long years of work together in the theatre, where <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>such</b> an inspiring and generous partner, I grew to love him in private life as a great gentleman, a rare spirit, fair and balanced, devotedly loyal and tolerant and, as a companion, bursting with vitality, curiosity and humour." [...] Among Richardson's other parts in his first Old Vic season, Enobarbus in Antony and Cleopatra gained particularly good notices. The Morning Post commented that it placed him in the first rank of Shakespearean actors. At the beginning of 1931 Baylis re-opened Sadler's Wells Theatre with a production of Twelfth Night starring Gielgud as Malvolio and Richardson as Sir Toby Belch. W. A. Darlington in The Daily Telegraph wrote of Richardson's [...] "ripe, rich and mellow Sir Toby, [...] I would go many miles to see again." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{new team}} began promisingly in 1970–71 by {{retaining}} fifth {{place in the}} league and reaching the semi-finals of the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup where they lost 0–1 to a very experienced Leeds United side. The highlight of Liverpool's European campaign that season was a 4–1 aggregate victory in the quarter-final over Bayern Munich. For the first time since winning the competition in 1965, Liverpool reached the FA Cup Final but, as in the Fairs Cup, experience was the major factor and Shankly's young team were beaten 2–1 by league champions Arsenal despite having taken the lead in extra time through a Steve Heighway goal. Watching from the sidelines was another new player whom Shankly had recently signed from Scunthorpe United for £35,000 on Twentyman's recommendation. This was Kevin Keegan and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>such</b> an important addition to the new Liverpool team that Shankly devoted an entire chapter of his autobiography to him entitled [...] "A Boy Called Keegan". Shankly summarised Keegan as [...] "the inspiration of the new team".|$|E
500|$|Bharathiraja wanted Chithra Lakshmanan, {{who was an}} {{assistant}} director with K.

When Kamal asked for , Lakshmanan suggested that Bharathiraja offer the role to Sivakumar since the production unit could not afford Kamal's request; however, Bharathiraja saw Kamal as the ideal choice and agreed to pay him [...] For his character, the actor grew his curly hair long and wore lungis and khadi high-buttoned shirts. In 2017, Kamal recalled, [...] "Years ago, a man sporting a soiled dhoti and shirt came to my office to narrate a script. Had I turned the offer down {{on the basis of his}} dirty clothes, I wouldn’t have been here talking to you. After listening to the script, I realised that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>such</b> a genius and the movie was the cult classic , and he was none other than ace Bharathiraja sir". Bharathiraja also recalled that he showed a [...] "handsome Kamal Haasan in an ugly way" [...] as he wanted to prove that characters need not always be attractive, and to break this stereotype in the film industry.|$|E
500|$|As a manager, he was {{a strict}} disciplinarian, {{possibly}} {{a result of his}} military background. [...] Carroll [...] "Dink" [...] Mothell maintained that [...] "Rogan wanted to run the ball club like they did it in the army. He liked to give orders too much, even before he was managing. He used to bawl players out for different things. I could take it, but we had ball players, when he'd get on them, they'd go into a shell, resented it, and didn't give him their best." [...] Another Monarchs pitcher, Chet Brewer, said that [...] "Rogan wasn't the best manager because <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>such</b> a great ball player himself. [...] He couldn't teach pitchers much, because he'd say, 'All {{you have to do is}} go out and throw the man what I threw'." [...] According to historian Phil Dixon, [...] "In Rogan's first few years as manager he was reluctant to pinch-hit for many of the veterans on his roster because they were his friends." [...] He didn't trust younger players, often inserting himself to pitch or pinch-hit for them. He sometimes treated rookies harshly. Eventually Rogan [...] "discarded his distant approach" [...] and became increasingly known for teaching and developing less experienced players.|$|E
