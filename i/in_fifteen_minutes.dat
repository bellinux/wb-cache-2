5|$|At Unbreakable, the TNA X Division Championship was defended in a Three Way match by then-champion Christopher Daniels against A.J. Styles and Samoa Joe. Styles won {{the match}} {{and the title}} at the event. This led to TNA {{promoting}} a Thirty-Minute Iron Man match between Styles and Daniels for the title at Bound for Glory. This was a rematch between the two that took place at Against All Odds. Other events that lead to this match included the 2005 TNA Super X Cup Tournament, which caused the Three Way match at Unbreakable, and Daniels defeating Styles in an Ultimate X Challenge match at TNA's Destination X PPV event on March13 to become champion. On the October8 episode of Impact!, Daniels issued a challenge to Styles to pick three wrestlers on the roster and he would defeat all of them <b>in</b> <b>fifteen</b> <b>minutes</b> or less. Styles accepted the challenge and chose Shark Boy, Sonjay Dutt, and himself. Daniels defeated both Shark Boy and Dutt before the time-limit expired, but did not defeat Styles in time on the October15 episode of Impact!.|$|E

Buildings would line the parade and student residences built on tower blocks rise from the central thoroughfare. Such plans were mostly followed.|$|E
25|$|Under Barassi, Carlton reached three {{consecutive}} Grand Finals between 1968 and 1970, resulting in two premierships: 1968 against Essendon and 1970 against traditional rivals Collingwood.

25|$|Merchant sailors {{were trained}} {{and used to}} man the {{anti-aircraft}} gun, it fired continually throughout the battle though it misfired a few times because of old ammunition. <b>In</b> <b>fifteen</b> <b>minutes</b> of fighting the Stanvac Calcutta was struck {{several times in the}} bridge and elsewhere, killing Captain Karlsson and a few other men. After hitting the Stier the guards manning the 4-inch gun were reported to have been encouraged and continued firing accurately until shrapnel damaged their weapon. The sights were destroyed but the Americans continued shooting until the ammunition on deck was exhausted. At this time Ensign Anderson ordered two men to retrieve more ammunition from below deck though as soon as they left, Captain Gerlach maneuvered his ship for a torpedo attack. When lined up, Stier fired one torpedo and it dove into the water and headed straight for Stanvac Calcutta where it detonated on the port side. Water began flowing in and the vessel started listing. A number of additional men were killed in the torpedo explosion and when {{it was clear that the}} American ship could not be saved, Ensign Anderson ordered the survivors to abandon ship and he began to lower life rafts.|$|E
25|$|The great England wicket-keeper Godfrey Evans was on {{his fourth}} tour of Australia, having visited before in 1946-47, 1950–51 and 1954-55. He was chosen in part for his batting, having made centuries against the West Indies and India, but his loud and {{enthusiastic}} wicketkeeping was a joy to watch and considered {{by far the best}} in the world. When he returned to England in 1959 he missed three stumpings <b>in</b> <b>fifteen</b> <b>minutes</b> against India and retired from Test cricket as he no longer met his own exacting standards, but his record number of dismissals in Test cricket remained unbeaten for eighteen years. The Marylebone Cricket Club preferred to rotate their reserve wicket-keepers and in 1958-59 it was the turn of the reserve Surrey keeper Roy Swetman. He was by far the shortest man in the team and looked only 17, but was in fact 25. Although a good man behind the stumps and a decent lower order batsman he was not Evans and lost his England place in 1960. In 1956 England had out-fielded and out-caught Australia and they were still a strong fielding team. Colin Cowdrey would be the first slip fielder to take 100 Test catches, Peter May and Tom Graveney were good slips and Ted Dexter an athletic cover. Fred Trueman was a good close field and Tony Lock was considered the greatest backward short leg in the world and one of the safest pair of hands in cricket. Peter Richardson, Willie Watson and Trevor Bailey were good all round fielders, though the latter two were slowing {{down at the end of}} their careers.|$|E

[...] In his The Seven Ages of Man routine, he drew two faces and progressively aged them. [...] His first performance was on June 11, 1906, in a show that also featured entertainer W.C. Fields. [...] It was a success, and McCay toured with the show throughout 1907, while managing to complete his comic strip and illustration work on time, often working in hotel rooms or backstage.|$|E

The program's first song [...] "Kuśa Lava Rāmāyaṇ Gātī" [...] was aired on 1 April 1955 at 8:45am IST. Vidya Madgulkar, the poet's wife, recalled in an interview that Madgulkar wrote the first song and gave it to Phadke the day before the recording; however, Phadke lost the lyrics. With the broadcast already scheduled, station director Sitakant Lad requested Madgulkar to re-write the song which was readily declined by an angered poet. Lad then decided to lock the poet in one of recording rooms equipped with all the required writing material and agreed to unlock the door only when Madgulkar is ready with the lyrics. Madgulkar then rewrote the lyrics from memory <b>in</b> <b>fifteen</b> <b>minutes</b> so Phadke could compose the music.|$|E

Following the track list reveal for the album, on February 7, 2014, producer DJ Mustard revealed that he co-produced [...] "Sanctified" [...] with Kanye West. The song was also produced by Mike Dean, along with being written by William Roberts, Sean Anderson, Kanye West, and Dijon McFarlane. Betty Wright lent her vocal talent to the song during a late night studio session she did {{as a favor to}} DJ Khaled in order for him to meet a deadline. She recorded the hook <b>in</b> <b>fifteen</b> <b>minutes</b> while sitting on a sofa [...] In the song, West raps about how he feels about people playing up his earlier works and dismiss who he is now, before saying that he's not going to worry about it. Then later he says, [...] "Wipe my forehead with a handkerchief and wash my sins in the blood of Jesus, People sayin', 'Ye, we need another Yeezus." [...] This being a reference to his experimental sixth studio album.|$|E
500|$|A castle {{was chosen}} for the video's setting. Personnel {{researched}} numerous castles in the United States and were unable to locate one in sufficient condition for filming. They had considered traveling to Europe to find a castle, but were then informed about a castle south of Nashville, Tennessee. Named Castle Gywnn, a castle {{that is part of}} the Tennessee Renaissance Festival, both located in Arrington, Tennessee, it was built in 1973 and chosen as the video's setting. Wardrobe for the video was supplied by Jacquard Fabrics, excluding Swift's dress for the balcony scene. The dress was designed by Sandi Spika with inspiration and suggestions from Swift. [...] "She loves to put her input in her dresses", stated Spika. The two had discussed the dress two months prior to the filming of the video. Accentuates were made on the video set. The video was filmed in two days in August 2008 in Tennessee. On the first day, the balcony and field scenes were shot. On the set, someone had replaced the playback CD with a high-pitch, altered version of the song. As a result, Swift lent the crew her iPod to play the original track. While filming another scene, sunset was about to occur and, therefore, the process was executed rather rapidly. For the scene, Fanjoy suggested a kiss between Swift and Gaston, but Swift refused to because she believed it would make for a sweeter moment. On the second day, scenes at Cumberland University in Lebanon, Tennessee and at a ballroom were filmed. Swift learned the choreography for the latter <b>in</b> <b>fifteen</b> <b>minutes</b> prior to filming. Approximately 20 dancers were used for the scene.|$|E
