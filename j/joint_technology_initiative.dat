ATR's senior vice-president for engineering Alessandro Amendola indicated that the elimination of all uses of bleed air was a key aim in the designing of an all-electric architecture as well as improving engine efficiency; the minimising of peak electrical loads was also a stated priority.

40|$|SUMMARY: The 7 th EU {{framework}} programme for research (FP 7) aims to provide new impetus to Europe’s growth and competitiveness, in realising {{that knowledge is}} Europe’s greatest resource. The programme places greater emphasis {{than in the past}} on research that is relevant to the needs of European industry, to help it compete internationally, and develop its role as a world leader in certain sectors. For the first time the {{framework programme}} provides support for the best in European investigator-driven research, with the creation of a European Research Council. The FP 7 budget is 50 % higher compared with its predecessor. The paper focuses on advances in information and communication technologies (ICT) under FP 7 and on how the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industry and facility management (FM) can benefit through a systematic involvement. The technologies under development, ranging from wireless sensor networks, cooperative smart objects, plug-and-play control architectures, technologies supporting the "Internet of Things", to ICT services supporting energy efficiency can benefit not only this sector, but the economy as a whole. Significant near-market research will be carried out in the two ICT <b>Joint</b> <b>Technology</b> <b>Initiatives</b> (JTI) which are launched in 2008. They address nanoelectronics and embedded computing systems applications. In international cooperation, the Intelligent Manufacturing Systems (IMS) initiative is focusing its strategy on building Manufacturing Technology Platforms in areas such as standardisation, education, sustainable manufacturing...|$|R
40|$|Numerical {{simulations}} aid combustor {{design to}} avoid and reduce thermo-acoustic oscillations. Non-linear {{heat release rate}} estimation and its modelling are essential for the prediction of saturation amplitudes of limit cycles. The heat release dynamics of flames can be approximated by a Flame Describing Function (FDF). To calculate an FDF, {{a wide range of}} forcing amplitudes and frequencies needs to be considered. For this reason, we present a computationally inexpensive level-set approach, which accounts for equivalence ratio perturbations on flames with arbitrarily-complex shapes. The influence of flame parameters and modelling approaches on flame describing functions and time delay coefficient distributions are discussed in detail. The numerically-obtained flame describing functions are compared with experimental data and used in an acoustic network model for limit cycle prediction. A reasonable agreement of the heat release gain and limit cycle frequency is achieved even with a simplistic, analytical velocity fluctuation model. However, the phase decay is over-predicted. For sophisticated flame shapes, only the realistic modelling of large-scale flow structures allows the correct phase decay predictions of the heat release rate response.

This thesis conducts a Business Case Analysis (BCA), including a base case analysis and sensitivity analyses focusing on the Return on Investment (ROI) of investing in, and operating and maintaining, the PEAK. The BCA compares the life-cycle cost estimate of the PEAK with that of the status quo (existing) systems in operational scenarios for a 10 -year period. When compared against the estimated investment over the system life-cycle, the results show positive ROI and net present value after the first year. The savings come from the cost of water and transportation. Lieutenant Commander, Supply Corps, United States Nav...|$|R

40|$|Polymer {{electrolyte}} {{fuel cells}} with their high gravimetric energy density face a water balance problem especially under variable loads, e. g. in automotive conditions: The excess product water {{needs to be}} removed from the fuel cell while maintaining a humidifed membrane. The gas diffusion layer, which also provides contact to the electro- chemically active components, has to achieve the passive management of the water balance. Heterogeneously hydrophobic gas diffusion media have already shown to be more capable of balancing these opposing requirements than conventional materials. Various methods of pattern- ing gradients of hydrophobicity are applied, like microperforation and laser, focused X-Ray and ion beam irradiation. The modifcations are analysed with photoemission and infrared spectroscopy and compared for their performance, applicability and scalability.
