500|$|Ed, Edd n Eddy {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. David Cornelius of DVD Talk considered the Eds to be child equivalents of The Three Stooges, believing that [...] "the series revels {{in the sort}} of frantic, often gross humor <b>kids</b> <b>love</b> so much, and there's just enough oddball insanity at play to make adults giggle just as easily." [...] Cornelius also wrote that the [...] "animation is colorful and intentionally bizarre; bold lines forming the characters and backgrounds wiggle and morph in a delirious haze. This is animation that's, well, really animated." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{leaving the}} group Hearsay, Texas native Ciara earned a writing job via her manager, for Atlanta's Tricky Stewart and The-Dream's RedZone Entertainment, penning songs for Mýa and Fantasia among others. According to Ciara, no one {{believed}} in her dreams of hearing her own music on the radio until she met producer Jazze Pha in 2002. Within five months of meeting her, Pha signed her to his Sho'nuff label and they had already recorded five tracks. About Ciara, Jazze Pha said, [...] "What was really lacking is the Janet Jackson, high-energy dance [...] Ciara fills that void. She's pretty, she can dance, she can write music, and <b>kids</b> <b>love</b> her. Everyone loves her." ...|$|E
500|$|Other {{artists who}} have written tributes to Barrett include his {{contemporary}} Kevin Ayers, who wrote [...] "O Wot a Dream" [...] in his honour (Barrett provided guitar to {{an early version of}} Ayers' song [...] "Religious Experience: Singing a Song in the Morning"). Robyn Hitchcock has covered many of his songs live and on record and paid homage to his forebear with the song [...] "(Feels Like) 1974". Phish covered [...] "Bike", [...] "No Good Trying", [...] "Love You", [...] "Baby Lemonade" [...] and [...] "Terrapin". The Television Personalities' single [...] "I Know Where Syd Barrett Lives" [...] from their 1981 album And Don't the <b>Kids</b> <b>Love</b> It is another tribute. In 2008, The Trash Can Sinatras released a single in tribute to the life and work of Syd Barrett called [...] "Oranges and Apples", from their 2009 album In the Music. Proceeds from the single go to the Syd Barrett Trust in support of arts in mental health.|$|E

500|$|The lyrics for {{the album}} were all written by Radke during his imprisonment. He has {{often called the}} album a breakup record, but with a band and not a girl. Radke said that, [...] "I would think all day, for days and days, [...] what people would want to hear. I would dissect my old album and read all the fan letters and the reasons why they loved my band and why they listened to it. And I wrote about that, but in {{different}} ways. I don’t know why these <b>kids</b> <b>love</b> the tragedies that I write about. I guess they can relate to it." [...] Also on the writing process, Radke said that his lyrics were much more evolved than his past works and that he felt this was a high-point for the post-hardcore genre, owing success to being incarcerated and writing lyrics for two years with no other musical influences. The title, The Drug in Me Is You, came from Radke's experiences concerning his previous self-destructive behavior, which Radke explained that, [...] "We named it that because ... It's me, looking in the mirror, saying, 'I am my own worst [...] I do the worst damage to myself — {{more than anybody else}} can to do me.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Pokémon Gold and Silver {{continued}} the enormous success of its predecessors, beginning {{the formation of}} Pokémon into a multi-billion dollar franchise. As of April 2000 roughly 6.5 million copies of the games had been sold in Japan. Silver {{proved to be the}} slightly more popular version, edging out Gold by approximately 100,000 copies. By the first week of their release in the U.S.A. the games had eclipsed Pokémon Yellow's previous record sales of a little over 600,000 copies; selling a combined total of 1.4 million copies to become the fastest selling games ever. The commercial success was expected, as Peter Main, the executive {{vice president of sales and}} marketing, stated [...] "There's no question about it; <b>kids</b> <b>love</b> to play Pokemon. So far in 2000 the best-selling game in America for any home console is Pokemon Stadium for [...] Nintendo 64, and the best-selling game for any handheld video game system is Pokemon [...] Yellow for Game Boy Color, but Pokemon [...] Gold and Silver will eclipse even those impressive sales totals. We project sales of 10 million units total of these two games in less than six months time". By 2010, the recorded sales of Gold and Silver were at 23 million units sold.|$|E

2500|$|Amy Poehler voices Bessie Higgenbottom, a 9¾-year-old Honeybee scout.
