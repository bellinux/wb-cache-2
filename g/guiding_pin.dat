40|$|Abstract. This study firstly {{conducted}} measurement of load history profiles at brake <b>guide</b> <b>pins</b> using strain gages subject to random road load history obtained from vehicle durability tests. Then, this study developed a {{simple mathematical model}} capable of estimating <b>guide</b> <b>pin</b> load history using the principle of energy conservation for a given road load profile. The model took into account the effect of impact that occurs {{from a range of}} acceleration levels and frequency content of the road input. The mathematical model also utilized the measured stiffness of the <b>guide</b> <b>pin</b> specimens and strain versus load relationship to increase the accuracy of the predictions. The estimated loads at a brake <b>guide</b> <b>pin</b> subject to a given random road load history were then computed using the mathematical model and compared to the load history obtained from the measurement. This study also compared cumulative fatigue damages calculated using Smith-Watson-Topper equation with the measured and predicted load profiles at the <b>guide</b> <b>pin.</b> The comparison study showed that the developed simple model is applicable to predict load profiles for fatigue life calculation at brake <b>guide</b> <b>pins...</b>|$|R

A <b>guide</b> <b>pin</b> from the Synthes (Paoli, PA) 7. 3 -mm cannulated set was placed percutaneously into the distal posterolateral leg with the ankle held in neutral position.

30|$|In obese patients, lateral {{fluoroscopic}} {{visualization of}} the hip is sometimes poor with the patient positioned on the fracture table. On a radiolucent table, manipulation of the limb to obtain frog lateral images {{of the hip}} is not only more expeditious, but often provides a higher quality image on the lateral view than that obtained on a fracture table. However, manipulation of a large leg risks bending even the most stout <b>guide</b> <b>pins.</b> Special care is required to avoid bending the <b>guide</b> <b>pin</b> in all cases, especially as the girth of the leg increases. Protected rotation of the leg while holding the <b>guide</b> <b>pin</b> {{at the site of}} skin insertion will allow adequate external rotation to see the lateral trajectory. Forceful manipulation into the flexion–abduction frog position should be avoided while the <b>guide</b> <b>pin</b> is in place. If required, slight rotation of the image intensifier may aid in obtaining the full lateral view.|$|R

30|$|In {{cases where}} a {{cortical}} button is employed {{to secure the}} graft to the femur, our group has observed an unsteady movement of the <b>guide</b> <b>pin</b> that is not securely fixed in bone when over drilled with a cannulated femoral drill. This common scenario is presumed to occur when the drilling sequence produces the smaller cortical button drill hole before the larger graft tunnel socket. In this situation, the tunnel <b>guide</b> <b>pin</b> would be loose within the cortical button drill hole. As a consequence of drilling over a loose <b>guide</b> <b>pin,</b> the drill might “wobble” and possibly alter the tunnel shape and aperture dimensions. To our knowledge, this observation was not {{reported in the literature}} with no previous study comparing the effect of changing the drilling sequence of the femoral tunnel on the tunnel shape.|$|R

40|$|Grafts placed too {{anteriorly}} on the femur {{are reportedly}} {{a common cause}} of failure in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Some studies suggest more anatomic femoral tunnel placement improves kinematics. The ability of the transtibial technique and a tibial tunnel-independent technique (placed transfemorally outside-in) to place the <b>guide</b> <b>pin</b> {{near the center of}} the femoral attachment of the anterior cruciate ligament was compared in 12 cadavers. After arthroscopic placement of the <b>guide</b> <b>pins,</b> the femur was dissected and the three-dimensional geometry of the femur, anterior cruciate ligament footprint, and positions of each <b>guide</b> <b>pin</b> were measured. The transtibial guide-pin placement was 7. 9  ±  2. 2  mm from the center of the footprint (near its anterior border), whereas the independent technique positioned the <b>guide</b> <b>pin</b> 1. 9  ±  1. 0  mm from the center. The center of the footprint was within 2  mm of an anteroposterior line through the most posterior border of the femoral cartilage in the notch and a proximodistal line through the proximal margin of the cartilage at the capsular reflection. More accurate placement of the femoral tunnel might reduce the incidence of graft failure and might reduce long-term degeneration observed after reconstruction although both would require clinical confirmation...|$|R

Two 5.0 - to 6.0 -mm femoral tunnels matched with the graft diameters were {{created for the}} AMM/AML and PL grafts by over-drilling via the <b>guide</b> <b>pins.</b> For the tibia, three 2.4 -mm <b>guide</b> <b>pins</b> were parallelly inserted from the medial tibial cortex to the anteromedial portion of the tibial ACL footprint (Otsubo et al., 2012) with a tibial tip aimer (Smith & Nephew Endoscopy). The <b>guide</b> <b>pins</b> were over-drilled to create two anteriorly-located tunnels (4.5 - to 5.0 -mm) for the two portions of the AMM/AML graft and one posteriorly-located tunnel (5.0 - to 6.0 -mm) for the PL graft, matching the graft diameters. Two Endobutton-CLs (Smith & Nephew Endoscopy) with appropriate loop lengths were connected to each loop end of the two grafts. The unified tibial end of the PL graft was sutured with two No. 2 polyethylene sutures using a Krackow stitch. Each tibial end of the bifurcated AMM/AML graft was also sutured with a No. 2 polyethylene suture by a Krackow stitch, respectively.|$|R
