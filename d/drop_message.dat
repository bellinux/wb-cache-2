40|$|Abstract – DTN {{flooding}} based {{routing protocol}} replicate the message copy {{to increase the}} delivery like hood that overloads the network resources. The probabilistic routing protocols reduce replication cost by forwarding the message to a node that holds high predictability value to meet its destination. However, the network traffic converges to high probable nodes and produce congestion that triggers the drop of previously stored messages. In this paper, we have proposed a routing protocol called as Connection frequency Buffer Aware Routing Protocol (CFBARP) that uses an adaptive method to maintain {{the information about the}} available buffer space at the receiver before message transmission. Furthermore, a frequency based method has been employed to determine the connection recurrence among nodes. The proposed strategy has performed well in terms of reducing message <b>drop,</b> <b>message</b> relay while increases the delivery probability...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Recent {{advances}} in coding theory have produced two classesof codes, turbo codes and low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes, which approach the Shannon limit of channel capac-ity while admitting efficient implementations of message encoding and decoding in software. Theoretic results aboutthe latter {{have been shown}} to apply to the former, hence we examine the evolution of LDPC codes from their originin Gallager's 1963 thesis to their current incarnation as tornado codes developed by Luby, Mitzenmacher, Shokrollahi,and Spielman. After considering several analytic approaches to quantifying their performance, we discuss the practicalityof LDPC codes, particularly those designed for the erasure channel, when applied to a number of current problems innetworking. 1 Introduction The late Claude Shannon founded an entire field of study in 1948 with his discovery of the Noisy Channel Coding Theorem [15]. Shannon proved that every communication chan-nel has a fixed capacity, which can be expressed in terms of bits per second, and that {{it is not possible to}} send infor-mation across a channel at a rate exceeding its capacity, or Shannon limit, as it has come to be known. Since that time,an entire field of study has grown out of attempts to design coding schemes that reach or approach the Shannon limit ofvarious channels, including those that simply <b>drop</b> <b>message</b> bits, termed erasure channels [5], and those that add varioustypes of noise to the signal.

30|$|Unfortunately, {{decentralization}} {{can leave}} peer-to-peer networks {{vulnerable to a}} different sort of denial-of-service attack wherein malicious agents join the network and misroute or <b>drop</b> <b>messages,</b> thereby disrupting communication. Constraining this message-dropping behavior is difficult since victims typically learn only that their messages weren't delivered, not who was at fault. Even when malicious behavior is localized to a particular peer, there is no central authority who can evict the peer from the network, leaving it free to perpetuate the attack. A small number of malicious agents can amplify their message-dropping with a Sybil attack[6], in which each joins the network many times under various false identities to occupy a greater percentage of the overlay space. Since <b>dropping</b> <b>messages</b> is computationally inexpensive for the attacker, {{a relatively small number of}} attackers can significantly disrupt overlay traffic.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} how <b>dropped</b> <b>messages</b> can be avoided during the service discovery process of the Universal Plug and play (UPnP) protocol in home networks. Another aim involved determining the causes of those <b>messages</b> being <b>dropped</b> during the service discovery process, with many protocols being examined. The thesis proposes an algorithm that can compute the.,/] 1 tr) imum period of time [...] required between a consecutive burst of services' reply messages and that determines the minimum required queue sizes for the routers' nodes to manage the traffic and avoid <b>dropped</b> <b>messages.</b> The proposed solution is applied at the application layer in' end nodes, not router nodes, as this would reduce the load on router nodes, freeing them up for other routing functions. The solution takes into consideration many of the network parameters such as network size, message size and existing traffic. An NS 2 simulator was used to examine the produced algorithm on two different network configurations - centralized and decentralized - which was tested with three different types of queue management algorithms: drop tail, Random Early Detection (RED) and Random Exponential Marking (REM). In addition, its functionality was examined in a hybrid network, which included both wired and wireless connections. The results show an improvement in the discovery rate and a reduction in the number of <b>dropped</b> <b>messages,</b> highlighting the capability of the proposed algorithm in dealing with modifications to the network topology and in changing the density of the existing traffic. The principal conclusion was that the UPnP scales up well with its extensive use of messaging through managing the rate of replied services' messages.

These algorithms are notoriously difficult to implement correctly, due to asynchronous communication and the occurrence of faults, such as the network <b>dropping</b> <b>messages</b> or computers crashing. We introduce PSYNC, a domain specific language based on the Heard-Of model, which views asynchronous faulty systems as synchronous ones with an adversarial environment that simulates asyn-chrony and faults by <b>dropping</b> <b>messages.</b> We define a runtime system for PSYNC that efficiently executes on asynchronous networks. We formalise the relation between the runtime system and PSYNC in terms of observational refinement. This high-level synchronous abstraction introduced by PSYNC simplifies the design and implementation of fault-tolerant distributed algorithms and enables automated formal verification. We have implemented an embedding of PSYNC in the SCALA programming language with a runtime system for partially synchronous networks. We show the applicability of PSYNC by implementing several important fault-tolerant distributed algorithms and we compare the implementation of consensus algorithms in PSYNC against implementations in other languages in terms of code size, runtime efficiency, and verification...|$|R

40|$|Service {{discovery}} protocols {{are used}} to facilitate dynamic cooperation among devices / services with minimal user intervention. These protocols work by exchanging messages to identify and locate the relevant services. When new devices and services are added the flow of messages often appears as a burst. These bursts act as a critical factor that may cause the loss messages which dramatically influences {{the performance of the}} service discovery process. Thus, the loss of messages results in uncompleted discovery process which will directly affect the sharing of resources in home networks.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel vehicle platoon control algorithm using Vehicle to Vehicle (V 2 V) and Vehicle to Infrastructure (V 2 I) wireless communications between platoon members. A platoon forms {{a chain of}} vehicles (e. g., trucks) for improved traffic and fuel efficiency. Platooning algorithms aim to maintain small inter-vehicular distance between vehicles under dynamic driving conditions like acceleration and deceleration. The random delay and <b>dropped</b> <b>messages</b> have a pronounced impact on the control algorithm especially in a congested communication network. In this work, a decentralized platooning control strategy is proposed such that each vehicle can independently switch between multiple controller strategies dependent on communication topologies or the pattern of information exchange from vehicles in-front. The control strategy takes into account V 2 V communication delay of up to 100 ms. In order to overcome the impact of <b>dropped</b> <b>messages</b> a predictive control scheme is proposed.
