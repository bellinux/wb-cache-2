500|$|On June 7, 2008, Franken was {{endorsed}} by the DFL. In a July 2008 interview with CNN, he was {{endorsed by}} Ben Stein, a noted entertainer, speechwriter, lawyer and author known for his conservative views, who generally supported Republican candidates. Stein said of Franken, [...] "He is my pal, {{and he is a}} really, really capable smart guy. I don't agree with all of his positions, but he is a very impressive guy, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> be in the Senate." ...|$|E
2500|$|In February 2009, Queenie Fletcher {{suggested}} that Abdelbaset al-Megrahi, {{who at the}} time was appealing his conviction for the Lockerbie bombing, should be moved to a prison in Libya, on condition that the Libyan government co-operate with detectives investigating her daughter's murder. Mrs Fletcher said: [...] "I know he is ill and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> be returned to a prison in Libya so his family can visit him. The appeal could still go ahead in Scotland, but he could stay in prison in Libya. It's got to be a fair exchange, so Yvonne's case can be closed. I'd like the police here to be given permission to interview whoever they've got to interview in Libya and see whoever they need to for someone to be brought to trial." ...|$|E
2500|$|Regardless, Clooney was {{determined}} {{to stay with the}} role. Loyal to the script, Clooney helped convince executives to support certain aspects of the film (such as the exploding cow scene) even after he was urged to drop out of production, as his contract called for his compensation with or without his decision to stay in the film. After a number of arguments, Clooney wrote Russell a letter that criticized Russell's behavior in a last attempt to make peace between the two, days before another fight would break out during the filming of the movie's finale. In it, the three lead characters attempt to escort Iraqi rebels across the border to Iran. There were a number of actors and extras in the scene, as well as other elements, such as helicopters flying overhead and landing {{in the center of the}} location. The fight began after an extra was having difficulty throwing Ice Cube's character to the ground. After a number of takes, Russell came to the extra and put him through the motions of the action. Some individuals present on the set during the incident state that Russell was simply showing the extra how to convincingly act in the scene. However, Clooney and others thought that Russell had violently thrown the extra to the ground. Clooney recalls: [...] "We were trying to get a shot and then he went berserk. He went nuts on an extra." [...] Clooney approached Russell and began criticizing him again, coming to the extra's defense. The two began shouting at one another before entering a physical fight. Second assistant director Paul Bernard was so fed up with the experience when the fight broke out that he put down his camera and walked off the set, effectively quitting. Clooney concludes, [...] "Will I work with David ever again? Absolutely not. Never. Do I think he's tremendously talented and do <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> be nominated for Oscars? Yeah." [...] Russell offered a different view, saying [...] "we're both passionate guys who are the two biggest authorities on the set," [...] and maintaining that the two continue to be friends. Ice Cube felt the conflict helped the film, saying [...] "it kind of kicked the set into a different gear where everybody was focused and we finished strong. I wouldn't mind if the director and the star got into an argument on all of my movies." ...|$|E

60|$|You told me, if I {{remember}} rightly, {{that one}} of the members of the original meeting denounced me as an arch-heretic[170]--meaning, doubtless, an arch-pagan; for a heretic, or sect-maker, is of all terms of reproach the last that can be used of me. And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> have been answered that it was precisely as an arch-pagan that I ventured to request a more intelligible and more unanimous account of the Christian Gospel from its preachers.|$|E
5000|$|After the race, Scheckter {{admitted}} that {{he knew he was}} holding Fittipaldi up. [...] "But <b>I</b> didn't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> pass, although <b>he</b> was being pushed from behind by Arturo Merzario. He tried three times to outbrake me, but I wouldn't let him get away with it." [...] With Scheckter out, McLaren also clinched its first Constructor's Championship, ten years after Bruce McLaren and Teddy Mayer had founded the team.|$|R

You cannot think, Mr. Dean, how much I have thought about it all." ...|$|R
5000|$|Several of Bartman's {{friends and}} family members spoke out in the days {{following}} the incident. His father told the Chicago Sun-Times, [...] "He's a huge Cubs fan. I'm sure I taught him well. I taught him to catch foul balls when they come near him." [...] A neighbor added, [...] "He's a good kid, a wonderful son, never in any trouble. <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> be blamed at all. People reach for balls. This just happened {{to be a little more}} critical. If Florida didn't score all the runs, you wouldn't be standing here." ...|$|R
6000|$|Nov. 7, 1854.--I thought Bright's letter both an {{able and}} a manly [...] one, and though I cannot go his lengths, I respect and sympathise [...] {{with the spirit}} in which it originated. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> draw a [...] {{distinction}} between petty meddlings of our own, or interferences [...] for selfish purposes, and an operation like this which really is in [...] support of the public law of Europe.

6000|$|If not, suppose some few gentlemen in the House of Commons, {{and to be}} sure {{very few}} they were, who {{publicly}} declared their dislike to it, or entered into any resolution; this, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> have explained, and not insinuated so gross a reflection on a {{great majority of the}} House of Commons, who first passed this law, and have ever since opposed all attempts to repeal it; these are the gentleman whom, in sarcasm and irony, he is pleased to call the [...] "worthy," [...] that is, the unworthy patriots themselves.|$|E
6000|$|... "Let him {{understand}} this. I do {{not wish}} to write to him again. After what has passed I cannot say I wish to see him again. But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> acknowledge to me that he has been mistaken. He need not then fear that I shall trouble him with any reply. But I shall know that he has acquitted me of a fault of which I cannot bear to think I should be accused." [...] Then she took a somewhat formal though still an affectionate farewell of the girl.|$|E
5000|$|Angela Punch McGregor {{later said}} she was [...] "amazed" [...] to be offered {{the role of a}} model but {{accepted}} the part because she had not worked for a while.I feared that if I didn't do it I would go down the plug hole The role was a mistake; the film was a mistake.

I promised Poulter, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> have her. Besides, I want the money slick at once.

60|$|January 14.--An odd mysterious {{letter from}} Constable, who is gone post to London, to put {{something}} to rights which is wrong betwixt them, their banker, and another moneyed friend. It strikes me to be that sort of letter which I have seen men write when they are desirous that their disagreeable intelligence should be rather apprehended than avowed. I thought {{he had been in}} London a fortnight ago, disposing of property to meet this exigence, and so <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>should.</b> Well, I must have patience. But these terrors and frights are truly annoying. Luckily the funny people are gone, and I shall not have the task of grinning when I am serious enough. Dined as yesterday.|$|E
6000|$|... "Who is {{that little}} yellow one," [...] he said, [...] "that old {{one with a}} face like a skull," [...] and he pointed to Hans, who had kept as much out of sight as {{possible}} behind Mavovo, [...] "that wizened, snub-nosed one who might be a child of my brother the god, if ever he had a child? And why, being so small, does he need so large a staff?" [...] Here he pointed again to Hans's big bamboo stick. [...] "I think he is as full of guile as a new-filled gourd with water. The big black one," [...] {{and he looked at}} Mavovo, [...] "I do not fear, for his magic is less than my magic," [...] (he seemed to recognise a brother doctor in Mavovo) [...] "but the little yellow one with the big stick and the pack upon his back, I fear him. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> be killed." ...|$|E
6000|$|For my own part, I {{enjoy the}} mystery, {{and perhaps the}} reader may. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> ought. <b>He</b> <b>should</b> not be less {{grateful}} for summer rain, or see less beauty in the clouds of morning, because they come to prove him with hard questions; to which perhaps, if we look close at the heavenly scroll, we may find also a syllable or two of answer, illuminated here and there.[16] ...|$|R
5000|$|One widely publicised {{response}} to Amaechi's announcement came from former NBA player Tim Hardaway, who {{stated that he}} would demand that a gay player be removed from his team: [...] "First of all I wouldn't want him on my team. Second of all, if he was on my team I would really distance myself from him because <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> that's right and <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> be {{in the locker room}} when we're in the locker room. Something has to give. If you have 12 other ball players in your locker room that's upset and can't concentrate and always worried about him in the locker room or on the court or whatever, it's {{going to be hard for}} your teammates to win and accept him as a teammate." [...] Hardaway later apologised for his remarks.|$|R
2500|$|In 1998, Lustiger {{was awarded}} the Nostra Aetate Award for {{advancing}} Catholic-Jewish relations by the Center for Christian-Jewish Understanding, an interfaith group housed {{on the campus of}} Sacred Heart University, a Catholic university at Fairfield, Connecticut in the United States. The Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish civil rights group, protested the award, saying it was [...] "inappropriate" [...] to honor Lustiger, who was born a Jew but left the faith. [...] "It's fine to have him speak at a conference or colloquium," [...] said the league's national director Abraham Foxman. [...] "But <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> be honored because he converted out, which makes him a poor example." [...] In France, however, Lustiger enjoyed good relations with the Jewish community. Théo Klein observed that although conversions usually carry out negative connotations in the Jewish world, it was not so with the Cardinal. Klein called Lustiger [...] "his cousin".|$|R
60|$|The gaps {{through the}} Blue Ridge I {{understand}} {{to be about}} the following distances from Harper's Ferry, to wit: Vestal's, 5 miles; Gregory's, 13; Snicker's, 18; Ashby's, 28; Manassas, 38; Chester, 45; and Thornton's, 53. I should think it preferable to take the route nearest the enemy, disabling him to make an important move without your knowledge, and compelling him to keep his forces together for dread of you. The gaps would enable you to attack if you should wish. For a great part of the way you would be practically between the enemy and both WASHINGTON and Richmond, enabling us to spare you the greatest number of troops from here. When at length running for Richmond ahead of him enables him to move this way, if he does so, turn and attack him in rear. But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> be engaged long before such a point is reached. It is all easy if our troops march as well as the enemy, and it is unmanly to say they cannot do it. This letter is in no sense an order.|$|E
6000|$|... "A consumptive; that is, I did at first. And {{it bothered}} me.

Everything he said and did was wonderful to me, like poetry and music. And then {{when he began to}} grow stronger and I saw {{that he was going to}} get well, and Cliff went on the rampage and showed the yellow streak, and I gave him back his ring--I didn't know even then how much Wayland meant to me. But on our trip over the Range I understood. He meant everything to me. He made Cliff seem like a savage, and I wanted him to know it. I'm not ashamed of loving him.

6000|$|He {{glanced up}} through the trees at the light overhead, and spoke more slowly than ever.

I {{think he ought to}} desire for her a life as high as she is capable of leading, with full scope for every faculty of her intellect or her {{emotional}} nature. She should be beautiful, with a vigorous, wholesome, many-sided beauty, moral, intellectual, physical; yet with soul in her, too; and with the soul and the mind lighting up her eyes, as it lights up--well, that is immaterial. And if a man can discover such a woman as that, and can induce her to believe in him, to love him, to accept him--though how such a woman can be satisfied with any man at all is to me unfathomable--well, then, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> be happy in devoting his whole life to her, and should give himself up to repay her condescension in taking him.' ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2009, Friday Night with Jonathan Ross was {{nominated}} for a BAFTA. According to The Times, Ross {{was nominated}} soon after he was banned.

5000|$|As the incumbent, Freeman-Wilson ran for Indiana Attorney General in 2000 {{but lost}} to Republican Steve Carter. State {{auditors}} later {{found that the}} former Attorney General Freeman-Wilson issued more than $700,000 in grants without approval from the Governor and various agencies during her eleven months in office. The Indiana State Board of Accounts discovered this when it filed the annual audit of this office in 2001. The State Board found that Freeman-Wilson issued grants from the $1.39 million payment Indiana received for work on the national tobacco settlement. A $500,000 grant to the Indiana Minority Health Coalition was also issued without approval from the Governor and agencies under his control. Freeman-Wilson acknowledged, [...] "mistakes were made." [...] She stated to the Indianapolis Star, [...] "I'm not going to criticize Mr. Carter and <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> criticize me."
