500|$|In 1967, Los Gatos {{released}} {{their first}} single, [...] "La balsa", backed with [...] "Ayer nomás". The song catapulted the burgeoning [...] "rock nacional" [...] scene in Buenos Aires, establishing the commercial viability of rock music sung in Spanish, and turning what originally was an underground scene into a widespread youth culture phenomenon. [...] "La balsa" [...] sold over 250,000 copies, an impressive number for that time, {{especially for a}} song with Spanish lyrics that differed from the cheerful and shallow efforts of the contemporary nueva ola movement. Spinetta stated: [...] "We were with Emilio [...] in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>television,</b> a Saturday afternoon, when we heard [...] "La balsa". Then we said, [...] "but these kids are awesome... let's be hippies from tomorrow!" [...] After a Los Gatos concert, Spinetta met producer Ricardo Kleiman and invited him to the band's rehearsals. When Kleiman heard the band play he signed them to RCA Records, and in November 1968 Almendra released their first single: [...] "Tema de Pototo", backed with [...] "El mundo entre las manos". Almendra began playing live, with performances {{during the summer of}} 1969 in Mar del Plata and an appearance at the Ancón Festival in Peru. Their Buenos Aires debut was at the Di Tella Institute as part of Three Beat Shows, where they introduced [...] "Fermín", [...] "Ana no duerme" [...] and [...] "Que el viento borró tus manos", songs which would appear on their first studio album. Almendra released a second single, [...] "Hoy todo el hielo en la ciudad" [...] backed with [...] "Campos verdes"; it was also released in Peru, where it was more successful than it was in Argentina. Between April and September 1969, the band recorded their first LP at TNT Studios, Buenos Aires, while a third single ("Tema de Pototo", backed with [...] "Final") was released. At the time of Almendras release, the influence of the Beatles and the Rolling Stones had overshadowed the success of the nueva ola, exemplified by the popular teen pop music TV show, El Club del Clan.|$|E

5000|$|Emotron's {{music and}} live show evolved over time. His early works are pop-punk esque while his newest {{material}} is more ambient slow rock. In one video {{that has since}} disappeared from YouTube, Emotron's live show was seen to include costume changes and lighting his crotch on fire as a finale. This reflected the more upbeat and goofy period in his music. Around 2010, Emotron's style became much darker and mellower, focusing heavily {{on the fact that}} Knight was aging, nearing 30 at the time. The song [...] "1998" [...] which can be found on YouTube {{is a prime example of}} his later style. Later shows included a bizarre media display featuring up to 10 television sets in a half circle playing static or strange images. Emotron would crouch in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>televisions,</b> usually wearing a speedo or similar attire.

Her name is derived from Polyfilla, a DIY product used to fill holes and cracks in plaster. Polly's sister Penny Dreadful makes an occasional appearance. Like several Private Eye regulars, Polly is based {{on more than one}} female columnist, but Jane Moore of The Sun, whose remarks are often echoed by Polly or commented on elsewhere in the magazine, is a major source.

2500|$|Unlike a light {{gun that}} senses {{light from a}} {{television}} screen, the Wii Remote senses light from the console's Sensor Bar (model number RVL-014), which allows consistent usage regardless of a television's type or size. The Sensor Bar is about [...] long and features ten infrared LEDs, five {{at each end of}} the bar The LEDs furthest from the center are pointed slightly outwards, the LEDs closest to the center are pointed slightly inwards, while the rest are pointed straight forward. The Sensor Bar's cable is [...] in length. The bar may be placed above or below the television, and should be centered. If placed above, the sensor should be in line with the <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>television,</b> and if placed below, should be in line with the front of the surface the television is placed on. It is not necessary to point directly at the Sensor Bar, but pointing significantly away from the bar will disrupt position-sensing ability due to the limited viewing angle of the Wii Remote.|$|E
40|$|AbstractProblem StatementLogical {{and reason}} {{can not be}} separated, {{due to the fact}} that only {{together}} they establish a correct system of thought and define logical reasoning. Thought is often dissolved in solving problems, according to some authors, and according to J. Piaget, quoted by M. Golu (p. 331), “is reduced to a system of operations”. In order to prove the statement, I used a set of tests (evaluation tests) which helped me detect quality aspects of reasoning in general and of logical reasoning in particular. Purpose of StudyFor this research I started from the assumption that leisure time is wrongfully spent in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> computer, <b>television,</b> or playing electronic games, which leads to a loss of contact with reality and limits logical reasoning. My research was conducted on a group of 126 individuals (boys and girls) candidates for higher education, high school graduates, and eager to become students, who come from different institutions, but theoretically have similar preoccupations and <b>the</b> tendency <b>of</b> obtaining <b>the</b> same social status – of students, future intellectuals. Research MethodsBibliographic study method; observation method; enquiry method (questionnaire, discussion, enquiry, etc.); pedagogical experiment method; statistical-mathematical method; observation method, graphical method. FindingsThe research aims to emphasize that leisure time wrongfully spent in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> computer, <b>television,</b> or playing electronic games, leads to a loss of contact with reality and limits logical reasoning, while individuals who have a programme where they alternate group sports activities, such as lessons Physical Education, and sports games with static computer games, electronic games or watching television, benefit from a different process of development, proven by the manner in which they approach reasoning issues. ConclusionsIn all these changes I consider that a particularly important role is held by <b>the</b> absence <b>of</b> Physical Education lessons and <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> computer, <b>television</b> or electronic games addiction, reason for which I believe that leisure time wrongfully spent in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> computer, <b>television</b> or playing electronic games, leads to a loss of contact with reality and limits the subjects’ logical reasoning...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Missing page 1. This review {{focused on}} television's {{influences}} on {{children in the}} period from 1970 to 2000. This review is important because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> explanations it presents for the arguments made by numerous researchers about <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> <b>television</b> on society, and how the influence changed society from 1970 to 2000. A valuable aspect of this review was that if television was considered a medium that changes, and was continually refined, why did only certain issues catch <b>the</b> attention <b>of</b> researchers? Often, in each separate decade, similar types of influences of television on children arose and were repeatedly studied by the researchers. In the 1990 s, researchers studied <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> sitting in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> a television without much activity; however, in the 1970 s children also sat in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>televisions,</b> but their environment was different. In the 1970 s, children watched television under parental supervision. Researchers focused their attention upon <b>the</b> contents <b>of</b> viewing material available to children and overlooked <b>the</b> lack <b>of</b> activity <b>television</b> viewing caused. It was the changes in <b>the</b> <b>television</b> viewing environment, <b>the</b> location <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>television,</b> and occupants in the room, that were highlighted in my review as television and children watching continue to be studied. This is important because <b>the</b> <b>television</b> environment itself was not given much notice independently by researchers.

5000|$|LCD panels, {{like other}} flat panel displays, are also much thinner than CRTs.

However, bright sunlight falling on <b>the</b> <b>television</b> was found to activate the controls.
