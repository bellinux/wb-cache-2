The {{aim of this study}} was to develop a measuring system for different instruments and manipulations in LESS using a single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) port. Methods: The loads on the SILS port were applied and recorded by the universal material testing machine by the following method. The handle of the forceps inserted in the SILS port was connected with the machine by a <b>fishing</b> <b>wire</b> and pulled at a constant rate. The surface deforma-tions (displacements and strains) of the SILS port were recorded with digital image correlation (DIC) simultane-ously. The correlation between deformation measure-ments and loads were analyzed. This experiment was repeated 8 times. Results: Strong correlations existed between deforma-tion measurements calculated by DIC and objective criteria “loads ” applied and recorded by the universal material testing machine (r 0. 98). The correlation coefficients were statistically significant (P. 001). A high repeatability of the results appeared in all repeti-tions of the experiment. Conclusions: A DIC measurement system has been developed for LESS, and comprehensive mechanical parameters of a SILS port can be obtained precisely by using this system. It is reliable and repeatable for eval-uation of instruments and manipulations in LESS. Key Words: Laparoendoscopic single-site surgery, Mea-surement system, Digital image correlation...|$|R
40|$|The {{exhibition}} at the long-established Haus am Lützowplatz (artists shown include Marina Abramović, Francis Bacon, Tony Craig, Rebecca Horn, Asger Jorn, Andy Warhol) comprised a total of nine intermedia works created between 2003 and 2009, including sculptures, installations, canvases, photographs {{as well as a}} performance. The work shown examines the human position in a world oversaturated with technology through reworking the (im) possibilities of exchange proposed by our environment. In particular, the work revolves around the inherent ambiguity of the interface, providing both access to new territories and simultaneously separating us from other parts of reality. For instance, with “Still a Life” participants can animate a fragile paper fish by touching a <b>fishing</b> <b>wire</b> stretched around the installation. However, the wire being an interface is only a distraction from its ultimate function as a barrier, keeping the audience at a distance. Notwithstanding Nuhn’s reservations about the impact of new technologies on our lives his work often embraces, somewhat schizophrenically, the possibilities offered by this technology to create perceptually engaging experiences. Yet, his pieces rarely propose a direct means for audience interaction. In “Digital Communication” the “actors” are unaware of their participation in the installation, which involves a live Internet chat-room relayed to an arrangement of robotic fingers. The installation highlights the binary nature of virtual interaction and presents, as a new language, a sonic rendition of pure electric impulses...|$|R

[...] One of the more difficult moving zorts included a [...] "triple zort" [...] with other characters who could teleport on the same shot in [...] "End of Nights". The sequence was difficult for Tapping, as she had to carry a prop weighing approximately 73 pounds. A three-dimensional hologram of Rachel's office was included in [...] "Fragments"; it was originally intended to feature the hologram throughout the episode, but because doing so would be costly, the producers decided to have one scene with the hologram, so Henry could {{use it as a}} blueprint to make an identical office with boxes. For the finale, Anthem decided to make the macri and Big Bertha look like the same creature, though Bertha would be a considerably larger creature. Some scenes involve the macri interacting with real life objects, including clothing. To make a scene where the macri enters a jacket, Wilson used <b>fishing</b> <b>wire</b> to move a sleeve slightly. Big Bertha's actions meanwhile, were largely made underwater. Anthem found that making underwater effects was difficult because there was a different style of movement. Additionally, Anthem produced a sequence where Wexford launches depth charges from his ship.

40|$|In rehabilitative {{medicine}} of sea turtles, traumatic lesions {{and infectious}} diseases are the more frequently encountered reasons to provide veterinary care to these animals. Trauma related emergencies (boat strikes, ingestion of fish hooks, entrapment in <b>fish</b> <b>wires,</b> etc.) require a surgical approach, and consequently a correct pain management. Data on reptile analgesia and pain management are scarce, both with NSAIDs and opioids, and totally lacking in sea turtles, so dosage regimens are generally extrapolated from other animal species, with consequent risks of clinical failure and damage to the animal. In order to avoid circumstances like these, preliminary data on the pharmacokinetic behavior of meloxicam in loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta) are presented, in order to assert the possibility of its clinical use to provide pre- and post-surgical analgesia. Meloxicam has been chosen in spite of other NSAIDs because of its more selective anti-COX 2 activity, and consequently expected lesser adverse side effects. 6 clinically health loggerhead turtles (courtesy of Lampedusa WWF Sea Turtles Rescue Center), 9. 6 - 27. 1 kg weight, were used. The animals were individually maintained in outdoor pools with continuous marine water flow, at 25 - 27 °C and 35 ‰ salinity. The dose of 0. 1 mg/kg of meloxicam was decided, so reducing the recommended dose used for dog and cat as no data are reported on the capacity of turtles to tolerate NSAIDs. Nevertheless, no adverse reaction was observed after {{the administration of the}} drug. Blood samples were collected from alternated cervical sinuses in lithium heparinized tubes. Meloxicam plasma concentrations were determined by DAD-HPLC. After the administration of a single i. m. dose, a very quick absorption rate has been noted, with time to peak concentration 0. 79 ± 0. 28 h (mean ± s. e.), and peak concentrations 0. 03 ± 0, 01 mg/ml. As pharmacodynamic and efficacy studies of meloxicam in reptiles have not been published, the minimum efficace concentration cannot be predicted, so further studies are requested to define the optimal dosage. A very fast disappearance of drug from vascular compartment was observed, with concentrations of drug below the quantitation limit (25 ng/ml) in 4. 60 ± 3. 49 h, elimination half-life of 1. 32 ± 0. 55 h, clearance of 4. 32 ± 1. 19 L/h•kg, and apparent volume of distribution of 6. 51 ± 2. 45 L/kg. These data are surprising enough, if compared with the ones reported in green iguana, where plasma concentrations resulted > 0. 1 mg/mL for up to 24 h, elimination half-life 9. 93 ± 4. 92 h, clearance 0. 037 ± 0. 016 L/h•kg, and apparent volume of distribution 0. 46 ± 0, 12 L/kg following a single i. v. dose of 0. 2 mg/kg. The large volume of distribution observed in loggerhead turtle suggests a wide tissue distribution, but nothing can be said on the persistence of drugs in tissues or real elimination of the drugs, so further studies are essential...|$|R

A total of seven presentations were given in Broward, Palm Beach, and Martin Counties. These presentations were for {{groups such as}} dive clubs, underwater photography clubs, fishing clubs, and environmental professionals clubs. Unfortunately, due to scheduling conflicts no survey presentations have been given in Miami-Dade County to-date. Summaries of these outreach presentations include {{the name of the}} club, location of the presentation, number of people reached, demographics, questions and responses during the presentations, and any flyers, emails, and/or pictures associated with each presentation. Table 1 displays these presentations indicating the club name, type of club, type of event, date of presentation, event location, and county. A total of 25 locations were visited to hand out survey postcards. These included three dive shops in Miami-Dade County, six dive shops in Broward County, ten dive shops, one surf shop, and one fishing store in Palm Beach County, and one dive shop and two marinas in Martin County. Table 2 shows survey outreach locations visited, their address, and the date visited. Survey outreach emails were sent to over 45 different groups targeting thousands of people. The largest was FWC at 15, 000. Efforts were also made to email all registered fishing license holders in south Florida totaling several hundred thousand emails, but no organization (FWC, NSU, FDEP) could send the email due to information privacy rules. Social media included Facebook and Twitter account postings on various reef related group pages such as Florida’s Coral Program, Protect Our Reefs, and Divers Direct. Articles were also posted on various forums such as Scuba Board and Florida Sportsman. Working with OFR and DEP staff, Joe Donzelli, NSU’s Associate Director of the Office of Public Affairs, wrote a press release to highlight the OFR survey and its importance in the effort to protect Florida’s reefs. Various media groups covered the story including The Sun Sentinel, The <b>Fishing</b> <b>Wire,</b> and Nova Southeastern University’s Shark Bytes. The outreach had a substantial effect on the number of survey respondents. The highest peaks in survey participation occurred in 2014 on October 16 th, 22 nd, and 23 rd with 61, 45, and 64 survey registrations created those days respectively. The second largest spike on October 16 th, 2014 {{may be due to the}} social media posts created and shared that day. An example of some of these posts can be viewed in Figure 13.

40|$|Much {{attention}} has been paid to the impacts of plastics and other debris on marine organisms, but the effects of plastic on terrestrial organisms have been largely ignored. Detrimental effects of terrestrial plastic could be most pronounced in intensively human-modified landscapes (e. g., urban and agricultural areas), which are a source of much anthropogenic debris. Here, we examine the occurrence, types, landscape associations, and consequences of anthropogenic nest material in the American crow (Corvus brachyrhynchos), a North American species that breeds in both urban and agricultural landscapes. We monitored 195 nestlings in 106 nests across an urban and agricultural gradient in the Sacramento Valley, California, USA. We found that 85. 2 % of crow nests contained anthropogenic material, and 11 of 195 nestlings (5. 6 %) were entangled in their nests. The length of the material was greater in nests in agricultural territories than in urban territories, and the odds of entanglement increased 7. 55 times for each meter of anthropogenic material in the nest. Fledging success was significantly lower for entangled than for unentangled nestlings. In all environments, particularly urban, agricultural, and marine, careful disposal of potential hazards (string, packing and hay bale twine, balloon ribbon, <b>wire,</b> <b>fishing</b> line) could reduce the occurrence of entanglement of nestling birds...|$|R
40|$|The European {{conflict}} between the increasing population of cormorants Phalacrocorax carbo sinensis and the fisheries has remained strong {{over the last two}} decades. One of the main obstacles to a resolve or mitigation of the conflict is lack of documentation of the effect of the birds¿ predation on the fish stocks. Naturally, such documentation is difficult to produce, due to the complexity and openness of the ecosystems (lakes, coast-areas, rivers). Tagging and releasing <b>fish</b> with coded <b>wire</b> tags, to recover tags from cormorant pellets can be a viable method to measure the impact of cormorants on fish populations. This study focused on the predation in a shallow estuary, where nearly 100, 000 fish were tagged and more than 10, 000 cormorant pellets were collected in the 3 -year study period. A total of 112 tags were recovered from the collected pellets. The analyses of tag recovery data showed a considerable cormorant predation on tagged Flounder, Eel and Salmon smolts.

40|$|This {{report is}} {{a summary of}} the results of 883 purse seine sets made for {{juvenile}} salmonids during 15 cruises off the coasts of Oregon and Washington during the springs and summers of 1981 - 1985. Juvenile coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) occurred most frequently, followed by chinook salmon (0. tshawytscha). The juveniles of these two species co-occurred more frequently than expected. Juvenile chum, pink and sockeye salmon (0. keta, O. gorbuscha, and O. nerka), steelhead (0. mykiss) and cutthroat trout (0. clarki clarki) were caught much less frequently and in lower numbers than coho or chinook salmon. We found no evidence of large schools ofjuvenile salmonids. A northerly movement of juvenile coho salmon wa suggested by decreased catches off Oregon and increased catches off Washington between early and late summer. Highest catch per set of juvenile coho salmon was usually found inshore of 37. 2 km. Juvenile chinook salmon were usually found within 27. 9 km of the coast. Juvenile salmonids were found over a broad range of surface salinities and temperatures. High catches of juvenile coho salmon occurred in both the low salinity waters of the Columbia River plume and in adjacent higher salinity waters. Preferences for specific salinities or temperatures were not obvious for any species, although catch rates of juvenile coho salmon were highest in years when chlorophyll content was also high.

40|$|Pacific coast salmonids, {{including}} California stocks, {{have declined}} in numbers with all populations of California Central Valley Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) listed or proposed for listing as endangered or threatened under the U. S. Endangered Species Act. Although California's natural stocks are declining, mass production of Central Valley fall-run Chinook salmon through hatchery production has supplemented {{the commercial and}} recreational fisheries. One challenge in understanding population dynamics of the California Central Valley Chinook salmon, is understanding the mechanisms that contribute to persistence of the populations. Key to understanding how spatial structure influences population dynamics is identification of habitats or distinct populations that may contribute differentially to juvenile recruitment into the adult population. Currently, the only method for understanding these mechanisms is based on recoveries of hatchery <b>fish</b> with coded <b>wire</b> tags in commercial and recreational landings. The small proportion of tagged hatchery fish and few coded wire tag returns limits information derived for hatchery populations and provides no method to explicitly monitor population trends of wild populations. Restoring exploited fisheries stocks relies on understanding the links between larval supply and adult recruitment, as well as determining temporal and spatial population structure. My research will use natural population markers to determine the relative contribution of production sources, both natural and supplemental, {{as well as the}} role of stock structure to the persistence of California Central Valley Chinook salmon. I will use a newly developed technique to analyze the microstructure and geochemical composition of otoliths, fish ear bones, to determine the production source and stream-of-origin for adult Chinook salmon.
