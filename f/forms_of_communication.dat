5|$|Human {{language}} {{is unique in}} comparison to other <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>communication,</b> such as those used by non-human animals. Communication systems used by other animals such as bees or apes are closed systems that consist of a finite, usually very limited, number of possible ideas that can be expressed.|$|E
5|$|Electronics {{deals with}} {{electrical}} circuits that involve active electrical components such as vacuum tubes, transistors, diodes, optoelectronics, sensors and integrated circuits, and associated passive interconnection technologies. The nonlinear behaviour of active components {{and their ability}} to control electron flows makes amplification of weak signals possible and electronics is widely used in information processing, telecommunications, and signal processing. The ability of electronic devices to act as switches makes digital information processing possible. Interconnection technologies such as circuit boards, electronics packaging technology, and other varied <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> infrastructure complete circuit functionality and transform the mixed components into a regular working system.|$|E
5|$|Several {{species of}} animals {{have proved to}} be able to acquire <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> through social learning: for {{instance}} a bonobo named Kanzi learned to express itself using a set of symbolic lexigrams. Similarly, many species of birds and whales learn their songs by imitating other members of their species. However, while some animals may acquire large numbers of words and symbols, none have been able to learn as many different signs as are generally known by an average 4 year old human, nor have any acquired anything resembling the complex grammar of human language.|$|E

5|$|In {{the rear}} of the main {{entrance}} hall is a series of six dioramas illustrating communications and the press throughout Indonesian history. The first diorama shows various <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> and news-sharing in pre-colonial Indonesia. The second diorama shows the press in the colonial period, including the first newspaper in the Indies under the Dutch East India Company, Memories der Nouvelles (1615); the first printed newspaper in the Indies, the Bataviasche Nouvelles (1744), and the first Javanese newspaper in the Indies, Bromartani (1855). The third diorama depicts the press during the Japanese occupation, whereas the fourth depicts the press during the National Revolutionâ€“ including the formation of the PWI. The fifth diorama shows the state of the press during the New Order under President Suharto, a time of great press censorship. The final diorama depicts the press after the beginning of Reformasi in 1998, in which greater freedom of the press has been granted.|$|E
5|$|In {{preparation}} for the oncoming hurricane, the weather forecast office in New Orleans began to issue tropical cyclone warnings and watches and advisories for the storm on August23. The first storm warnings were issued for areas of the United States Gulf Coast between New Orleans and Matagorda, Texas at 10:30 p.m CDT (0430UTC) that day, indicating an approaching system with considerable intensity. As the hurricane unexpectedly recurved to the north the next day, the previously issued storm warning was shifted eastward to include areas from Morgan City, Louisiana to Galveston, Texas, while a hurricane warning was issued by the weather forecast office for areas between Morgan City and Mobile, Alabama at 10:00p.m. CDT (0400UTC). A storm warning was also placed for areas east of Mobile to Apalachicola, Florida. After the hurricane rapidly weakened over land, warnings and advisories from the New Orleans weather office related to the storm were discontinued by 9:00p.m. (0500UTC) on August25. The warnings were communicated to potentially affected areas via mail, telegraph, and other <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>communication.</b> During {{the time that the}} hurricane was approaching the coast, the United States Weather Bureau also began experimentally transmitting surface weather analysis maps to ships by radio. Small craft offshore of Mobile were recalled to the Port of Mobile, while floating dock property was removed in New Orleans. Due to the potential affects of the hurricane on the cotton industry, cotton stock markets reported gains of eight to fifteenpoints from the first trades, with stock prices closing with a net gain as high as 24points.|$|E

40|$|During the 20 th century {{popular culture}} has been {{developing}} a special communication form which hasn't been used before. Cuteness as a <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> has become a new effective method of strategic marketing, PR campaigns and branding. Cute appeal is a biological factor that has been developed through thousands of years during the evolution to provide a necessary care for the offspring. But during the decades the cute appeal has been turned to an effective <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> with almost guaranteed effects on the target audience. This research has been aiming to detect who is using cuteness as a <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> on-line and how are they using it. The most effective method {{for this type of}} research is a qualitative method. The field of the research has become the World Wide Web and over a hundred samples have been collected. The samples of interest were the web-pages which are using cuteness as a <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>communication.</b> The samples were divided into four groups with several subgroups. To analyse them the four perspectives of cuteness have been created based on the theoretical background and previous research. The results helped to get a deeper understanding of cuteness as a <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> on the private level, corporate/organizational and even on the level of educational institutions and nonprofit organizations...|$|R

25|$|Semaphore is a <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> that {{utilizes}} flags.

This <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> is primarily used by naval signallers. This technique of signalling was adopted in the early 19th century and is still used in various forms today.|$|R
25|$|Originally, the GPO was a {{monopoly}} covering the despatch of items from a specific sender {{to a specific}} receiver, {{which was to be}} of great importance when new <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> were invented.

25|$|There {{have been}} many {{instances}} showing {{that there is a}} form of aphasia among deaf individuals. Sign language is, after all, a form of communication that has been shown to use the same areas of the brain as verbal <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>communication.</b> Mirror neurons become activated when an animal is acting in a particular way or watching another individual act in the same manner. These mirror neurons are important in giving an individual the ability to mimic movements of hands. Broca's area of speech production has been shown to contain several of these mirror neurons resulting in significant similarities of brain activity between sign language and vocal speech communication. Facial communication is a significant portion of how animals interact with each other. Humans use facial movements to create, what other humans perceive, to be faces of emotions. While combining these facial movements with speech, a more full form of language is created which enables the species to interact with a much more complex and detailed form of communication. Sign language also uses these facial movements and emotions along with the primary hand movement way of communicating. These facial movement <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> come from the same areas of the brain. When dealing with damages to certain areas of the brain, vocal <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> are in jeopardy of severe forms of aphasia. Since these same areas of the brain are being used for sign language, these same, at least very similar, forms of aphasia can show in the Deaf community. Individuals can show a form of Wernicke's aphasia with sign language and they show deficits in their abilities in being able to produce any form of expressions. Broca's aphasia shows up in some patients, as well. These individuals find tremendous difficulty in being able to actually sign the linguistic concepts they are trying to express.|$|E
25|$|For much of {{the colonial}} period, the state (then an intendencia or province) was {{relatively}} isolated with few roads and other <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>communication.</b> Most politics and social issues were strictly on the local level.
