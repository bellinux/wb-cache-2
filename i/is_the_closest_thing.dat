This period <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>closest</b> <b>thing</b> to a golden age in Egyptian tradition, {{the period of}} {{stability}} that the Egyptians constantly sought to evoke and imitate. Yet the stories about Ra's reign focus on conflicts between him and forces that disrupt his rule, reflecting the king's role in Egyptian ideology as enforcer of maat.|$|E

[...] He noted that Black Lives Matter is not monolithic and [...] "is a movement comprising numerous groups. ...

500|$|Papps {{revealed}} {{to a reporter}} from TV Life {{that he would never}} marry as young as Frank did. While he told Eithne Power of TVTimes that he thought Frank and Bobby rushed into marriage without any [...] "proper understanding of each other". Frank thinks that marriage is a partnership where he will be [...] "strong, the big provider and the breadwinner". Papps said that it was a [...] "chauvinist view" [...] but due to his childhood he wants the option of security. Papps said that Bobby wants the same because of her bad childhood, but they both [...] "approach marriage from different angles. Dickson agreed and admitted that there were times she wanted to scream at Bobby and tell her to [...] "get her act together" [...] where their marriage is concerned. Frank later decides to comfort Roo when Brett blackmails her to get access to Martha. Bobby becomes jealous and paranoid. Dickson said that [...] "Bobby has caught Frank on the rebound, and she knows it. Frank <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>closest</b> <b>thing</b> poor Bobby has ever had". Tom thinks that their marriage was a mistake, Dickson said that [...] "deep down" [...] Bobby knows that is too young, but she is a character [...] "who can't be told".|$|E
500|$|Although vastly {{critically}} acclaimed, {{the song}} did receive some minor criticism. Lukewarmly, Irving Tan of Sputnikmusic commented, [...] "numbers like 'Be Our Guest' provides evidence that Lumiere and co. are infinitely preferable as entertaining flatware." [...] On Lansbury's performance, Tan joked, [...] "The singer's delightfully personable contribution is almost {{reason enough to}} forgive Disney for thinking her English accent... would not look {{out of place in}} a film set in 18th century France." [...] A more negative review was written by Pete Vonder Haar of The Houston Press. Observing that Beauty and the Beast [...] "was Disney's first stab at incorporating computer animation," [...] he felt that [...] "the results are, now, pretty primitive," [...] concluding, [...] "I recall thinking the dancing forks during 'Be Our Guest'... looked pretty bad and time has not been kind." [...] The song has also been compared to [...] "Under the Sea" [...] from The Little Mermaid, most of which have been mixed. Jay Boyar the Orlando Sentinel opined, [...] "'Be Our Guest'... <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>closest</b> <b>thing</b> in Beauty and the Beast to the bubbly 'Under the Sea' extravaganza in The Little Mermaid," [...] while Entertainment Weeklys Owen Gleiberman's review was much more negative, describing the song as [...] "merely serviceable" [...] and concluding, 'Be Our Guest,'... sorry to say, is no 'Under the Sea'." [...] Likewise, Desson Howe of The Washington Post panned both the song and Lumiere, writing, [...] "the Candelabrum's Maurice Chevalier accent is clearly intended to substitute for the Caribbean-lilted lobster in Mermaid. And the ensemble song, 'Be Our Guest,' in which the household gadgets enjoin Belle to live with them, is an obvious attempt to reprise a similar Mermaid number, 'Under the Sea.' But it's just under par." ...|$|E
500|$|Since his {{appearance}} in Final Fantasy XII, Balthier has received mostly positive reception. When {{he was first}} revealed, the fan response was very positive. GameSpy's Justin Speer described him as a [...] "clever-bastard type", praising his wry delivery. GameSpot's Greg Kasavin called Balthier the best character in the game, describing him as the [...] "Auron of the cast". 1UP.com editor Jeremy Parish called Final Fantasy XII protagonist Vaan annoying, placing the duo of Balthier and Fran above him. 1UP.com's Andrew Pfister stated Balthiers presence in Final Fantasy XII helped ease some fans dislike of the [...] "angsty teen" [...] behavior of the main character Vaan. PSX Extreme editor Cavin Smith commented that while Vaan is the main character, he usually takes a back seat, adding that Balthier <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>closest</b> <b>thing</b> to a male lead. For similar reasons, GameZone listed Balthier as the tenth best Final Fantasy character, emphasizing how Balthier becomes [...] "as much the leading man as Vaan." [...] PALGN's Phil Larsen commented that though a lofty prediction, he expected that the duo of Balthier and Fran would [...] "go {{down in history as}} one of the greatest duos of modern narrative storytelling". Balthier ranked ninth on IGN's top 25 best Final Fantasy characters, ranking higher than any other character from Final Fantasy XII. Editor Dave Smith commented that he makes a [...] "convincing case" [...] that he is the main hero, upstaging fellow playable characters due to his [...] "sharp looks and even sharper wit." [...] GamesRadar'sAJ Glasser listed Balthier and Fran as one of her favourite Final Fantasy couples, describing theirs as being a well-balanced relationship. Destructoid's Aaron Linde noted that few video game characters had both his intelligence and his common sense, and wished more male characters in gaming could be like him.|$|E

500|$|The {{album that}} {{resulted}} is what many call the outlaw movement's first true record and Jennings' artistic zenith. [...] Almost {{all of the}} songs on Honky Tonk Heroes contain a defiant, restless longing for and celebration of the road ("Moving <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>closest</b> <b>thing</b> to being free...") and a rock and roll swagger that was entirely new in Nashville circles. [...] Although concept albums were not new in country music, with stars like Johnny Cash, Marty Robbins, and Porter Wagoner all having recorded LPs with unifying themes, Honky Tonk Heroes offered a more progressive take on the enterprise, resembling the albums Mickey Newbury had recently recorded and the blockbuster Red Headed Stranger album that Willie Nelson would release two years later. [...] In addition to Shaver's brooding compositions, Jennings rounded out the collection with the tender ballad [...] "We Had It All," [...] written by Kris Kristofferson keyboardist [...] "Funky" [...] Donnie Fritts. [...] According to Michael Striessguth's book Outlaw, RCA had asked Waylon to tack on one more song to augment the Shaver songs, in hopes of landing a hit single, and after considering Steve Young's [...] "Seven Bridges Road," [...] Jimmie Rodgers' [...] "T for Texas," [...] and Shel Silverstein's [...] "The Leaving Coming On," [...] Jennings opted for the Fritts tune, which {{would go on to}} be recorded and performed by Rod Stewart, Ray Charles, Bob Dylan, the Rolling Stones. [...] Released as a single, [...] "We Had it All", peaked at number 28 in Billboards Country Singles. [...] Jennings and Shaver also collaborated on the hit single [...] "You Asked Me To," [...] which spent fifteen weeks on the Billboard country singles charts, reaching a peak of number eight. [...] In the liner notes to The Essential Waylon Jennings, Wade Jessen quotes the singer: [...] "We wrote this one night in the dark over at Bobby Bare's office across the street from a Burger Boy where we'd been playing pinball. [...] Shaver said, 'I've got it started. [...] Let's finish it.' [...] We wrote it pretty well in the dark." [...] Shaver recorded his own version in 1977 for the album Gypsy Boy, with special guest Willie Nelson on guitar and vocals. [...] "You Asked Me To" [...] also appeared as the closing song on Elvis Presley's 1975 album Promised Land.|$|E
2500|$|Ruskin's {{theories}} also inspired some architects {{to adapt}} the Gothic style. Such buildings created {{what has been called}} a distinctive [...] "Ruskinian Gothic". Through his friendship with Sir Henry Acland, from 1854 Ruskin supported attempts to establish what became the Oxford University Museum of Natural History (designed by Benjamin Woodward) which <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>closest</b> <b>thing</b> to a model of this style, but still failed completely to satisfy Ruskin. The many twists and turns in the Museum's development, not least its increasing cost, and the University authorities' less than enthusiastic attitude towards it, proved increasingly frustrating for Ruskin.|$|E

He pulls off other pranks, such as putting a small effigy of Longtarin on the front of his car, in a parody of the Rolls-Royce Spirit of Ecstasy.|$|E
2500|$|ALDL {{was not a}} standard. [...] It was {{actually}} extremely fragmented. [...] The information exchange changed with each powertrain control module (aka PCM, ECM, ECU).

[...] While ALDL <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>closest</b> <b>thing</b> to standard onboard diagnostics prior to 1991 ALDL was not a standard. [...] ALDL was even fragmented within GM brands, models, and model years. [...] Trim levels in the same model year, division, and nameplate can use different communications. [...] Different versions presented differences in diagnostic jack pin-outs, data protocols, and data rates (this {{is the reason for}} the ″Mask″ files needed for aftermarket software communication). Earlier versions used 160 bit/s, while later versions went up to 8192 bit/s and used bi-directional communications to the PCM or ECM/TCM.|$|E

The Esquire is a one-pickup version of the Telecaster. Prior to using any Telecaster oriented guitar, before buying his 1966 model, he used as main guitars a Gretsch White Falcon and a Hofner. For amplification Strummer was known to use amplifiers such as a Roland Jazz Chorus, a Selmer Bassman {{while he was in}} the 101ers, a Vox AC30 and various Marshall amplifiers, but his main amplifier was a Music Man HD 212,150. Strummer commented on his choice of amplifier with [...] "I don't have time to search for those old Fender tube amps.

2500|$|The couplet {{brings the}} sonnet {{together}} in a happy light. Throughout the sonnet we're learning about the poet's dark confessions to finding his ideal love and realizing the only love that he needs the most is of the young mans. Jane Roessner notices how the line [...] "then give me welcome, next my heaven the best" [...] is [...] "the poet's need of pity from the young man and how his long confession important for {{its effect on the}} young man, calculated to move him to a certain response." [...] Line 13 is the poet begging the young man to forgive him and to embrace him. The phrase in line 13 [...] "next my heaven the best" [...] is the poet confessing to the young man that his love is like his heaven. He <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>closest</b> <b>thing</b> to the divine. Radley and Redding state that the poet is saying, [...] "your love is next of the divine (ideal), grant me a welcome sanctuary in your person." [...] The couplet is the most powerful part of the sonnet because now he is saying that the love the young man provides is great next to this divine being.|$|E
2500|$|In 1993, on his fortieth birthday, Moore openly {{declared}} his dedication {{to being a}} ceremonial magician, something he saw as [...] "a logical end step to my career as a writer". According to a 2001 interview, his inspiration for doing this came when he was writing From Hell in the early 1990s, a book containing much Freemasonic and occult symbolism: [...] "One word balloon in From Hell completely hijacked my life... A character says something like, 'The one place gods inarguably exist is in the human mind'. After I wrote that, I realised I'd accidentally made a true statement, and now I'd have to rearrange my entire life around it. The only thing that seemed to really be appropriate {{was to become a}} magician." [...] Moore associates magic very much with writing; [...] "I believe that magic is art, and that art, whether that be music, writing, sculpture, or any other form, is literally magic. Art is, like magic, the science of manipulating symbols, words or images, to achieve changes in consciousness... Indeed to cast a spell is simply to spell, to manipulate words, to change people's consciousness, and this is why I believe that an artist or writer <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>closest</b> <b>thing</b> in the contemporary world to a shaman." ...|$|E
