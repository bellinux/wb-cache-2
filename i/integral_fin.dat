40|$|This {{article is}} in an Open Access journalThe paper reports {{experimental}} results using simulated condensation on eight horizontal <b>integral</b> <b>finned</b> tubes with different fin spacing but same root diameter. Condensation was simulated with low approaching zero vapor velocity of condensate using three liquids (water, ethylene glycol and R 141 b) supplied to the tube via small holes between the fins {{along the top of}} the tubes. Controlling parameters of the investigation were fin spacing of condensation tubes, flow rate of condensate and surface tension to density ratio of the condensate. The results indicate that the retention angle (measured from the top of the tube to the position where the inter-fin space is completely filled with liquid) increases with the increase in fin spacing. Also, retention angle increases as the density of the condensate increases but retention angle decreases with increase in surface tension. Interesting finding is seen as retention angle remains constant with increase in condensate flow rate, starting from very low (nearly zero) flow rate to the flow rate at which the tube gets fully flooded. The critical flow rate for eight tubes of defined fin density against three working fluids is measured. Results obtained from simulated condensation for almost zero condensate velocity are in good agreement with earlier data and theoretical model for retention angle on such tubes...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} unlimited. Heat transfer measurements {{have been made}} for filmwise condensation of steam on three families of horizontal <b>integral</b> <b>finned</b> copper tubes. The families differ {{from each other in}} their tube root diameter (12. 7 mm, 19. 05 mm, 25. 00 mm). The tubes making up each family differ from each other only in the fin spacing. Similar measurements have been carried out on three smooth horizontal copper tubes of outside diameters equal to the root diameters of each family, allowing the heat transfer enhancements due to the fins to be measured directly. Results carried out under vacuum and atmospheric conditions indicate that there is a optimum fin spacing which is independent of tube root diameter and operating pressure. This optimum fin spacing is 1. 5 mm. Heat transfer measurements were carried out on all tubes with and without the use of a spiral insert (used to enhance the internal heat transfer). It was found that with the current processing technique used, the heat transfer enhancement for a finned tube (which is based on the outside heat transfer coefficient) varies depending on whether or not an insert is used, the enhancement being lower when no insert is used. However, it was found that when testing a smooth tube there was no difierence when an insert was or was not used. There is a need to develop a more accurate correlation for the inside heat-transfer coefficient. Further tests have been repeated using a finned tube geometrically similar to one being tested at the University of London. Discrepancies that existed between the two sets of data have been eliminated. [URL] United States Nav...|$|R

40|$|A {{significant}} factor in the overall efficiency of the balance of plant for a future magnetic fusion energy (MFE) reactor is the thermal performance of the divertor. A significant fraction of the reactor power is delivered to the divertor as plasma impurities and fusion products are deposited on its surface. For an advanced MFE device, an average divertor heat load of 10 MW/m² is expected at steady-state operating conditions. Helium cooling of the divertors {{is one of the}} most effective ways to accommodate such a heat load. Several helium-cooled divertor designs have been proposed and/or studied during the past decade including the T-Tube divertor, the helium-cooled flat plate (HCFP) divertor, the helium-cooled multi-jet (HEMJ) divertor, the helium-cooled modular divertor with <b>integral</b> <b>fin</b> array (HEMP), and the helium-cooled modular divertor with slot array (HEMS). All of these designs rely on some form of heat transfer enhancement via impinging jets or cooling fins to help improve the heat removal capability of the divertor. For all of these designs very large heat transfer coefficients on the order of 50 - 60 kW/m²-K have been predicted. As the conditions of a fusion reactor and associated helium flow conditions (600 °C and 10 MPa) are difficult to achieve safely in a controlled laboratory environment, the study of these divertors often relies on computer simulations and experimental modeling at non-prototypical, albeit dynamically similar, conditions. Earlier studies were based on the assumption that, for geometrically similar divertor test modules, dynamic similarity can be achieved by matching only the Reynolds number. Experiments conducted in this investigation using different coolants and test module materials have shown this assumption to be false. Modified correlations for the Nusselt number and loss coefficients for the HEMJ and HEMP-like divertor modules have been developed. These have been used to develop generalized performance curves to predict the divertor performance, i. e. the maximum allowable heat flux and corresponding pumping power fraction, at prototypical conditions. Additionally, a numerical study has been performed to optimize the fin array geometry of the HEMP-like divertor module. The generalized correlations and performance curves developed in this investigation can be incorporated into system design codes, thereby allowing system designers to optimize the divertor geometry and operating conditions.

The instanton is realized by a Euclidean D brane wrapping a non-trivial cycle upon which we also wrap a single space-filling D brane. The standard problem of unwanted neutral fermionic zero modes is evaded by the appearance of couplings to charged bosonic zero modes in the instanton moduli action. Since the Euclidean D brane wraps a cycle which is not associated to any low energy gauge dynamics, it can not be interpreted as an ordinary gauge instanton, but rather as a stringy one. By considering such a brane configuration at an orbifold singularity, we can explicitly evaluate the instanton moduli space <b>integral</b> and <b>fin...</b>|$|R
