This work has continued without interruption ever since an enormous federal subsidy to San Francisco Bay shipping. Some of the <b>dredge</b> <b>spoils</b> were initially dumped in the bay shallows (including helping to create Treasure Island on the former shoals to the north of Yerba Buena Island) and used to raise an island in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. The net effect of dredging has been to maintain a narrow deep channel—deeper perhaps than the original bay channel—through a much shallower bay. At the same time, most of the marsh areas have been filled or blocked off from the bay by dikes.|$|E

40|$|Monitoring large (underwater) surfaces, with rapidly varying composition, {{requires}} a sampling density which exceeds {{the capabilities of}} standard techniques. These techniques involve sample collection {{and a number of}} treatments and measurements in the laboratory; both steps are laborious, tedious and costly. This paper presents an in situ method in which a detector system is trailed over the surface and measures continuously the gamma rays emitted by the natural radionuclides in the sediment. Since each sediment component has its own characteristic set of activity-concentration values (radiometric fingerprint), the composition of the sediment can be deduced quantitatively. This paper shows the application of this technique for monitoring the dispersal of <b>dredge</b> <b>spoil</b> from Rotterdam harbour, dumped in the North Sea. In addition to a qualitative picture of <b>dredge</b> <b>spoil</b> dispersal, a mass-balance equation has been used to quantitatively assess the <b>dredge</b> <b>spoil</b> transport with time.

40|$|The {{disposal}} of <b>dredge</b> <b>spoil</b> in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park for port expansion at Abbot Point in North Queensland, Australia, {{has been a}} contentious issue receiving extensive media coverage. The media has {{played a key role}} in representing different risk perceptions, and potentially influencing policy decision-making. This paper identifies different perceptions of risk portrayed by local, regional, interstate and national print media in relation to the <b>dredge</b> <b>spoil</b> issue from January 2013 until February 2014. Media analysis explored the questions: how is 'risk' represented, who is linked to different risk perceptions, and how has the media coverage of the issue changed over time? Results show that 'risk' to the Great Barrier Reef from the <b>dredge</b> <b>spoil</b> was framed by four main themes: Environmental Disaster, Socio-economic Disaster, Equilibrium and Industrialism. Environmental Disaster was the most prominent overall, and often positioned in opposition to Industrialism. In January 2013 the <b>dredge</b> <b>spoil</b> issue was mainly covered by local sources and focused on risks to local livelihoods and environments. By February 2014 the issue was covered by sources throughout Australia and represented a range of risks to the GBR, and its World Heritage status, in relation to coal mining and port developments. Insights for communication from this analysis include the importance of using clear language that provides exact and solid examples of risks, especially in light of the media's agenda-setting power and with an issue that the general public does not have direct experience...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{policy in}} the Netherlands {{concerning}} waste recognises an order of preference, with prevention as the ideal solution, followed by reuse (either direct or after treatment) and confined disposal as the least preferred option. The reuse of <b>dredged</b> <b>spoils</b> is the cheapest removal option {{and one that is}} frequently used. Treatment of <b>dredged</b> <b>spoils</b> is more expensive than disposal and hence difficult to stimulate. Consequently, 2002 saw the introduction of a tax of € 13. 48 per ton on the disposal of treatable <b>dredged</b> <b>spoils.</b> The environmental objective was to cancel out the economic advantage of disposal over processing and thus to encourage treatment. The introduction of this tax measure has had a number of positive effects:- In-situ sediment site investigations have been extended to include the determination of the sand content, and more attention is being paid to identifying sandy and non-sandy batches;- More accurate records of the dredging, transportation and disposal processes are being drawn up;- Treatment is being carried out under a quality assurance system geared towards maximising sand production...|$|R

50|$|The {{great black-backed gull}} {{is found}} {{in a variety of}} coastal habitats, {{including}} rocky and sandy coasts and estuaries, as well as inland wetland habitats, such as lakes, ponds, rivers, wet fields and moorland. They are generally found within striking distance of large bodies of water while ranging inland. Today, it is a common fixture at refuse dumps both along coasts and relatively far inland. The species also makes extensive use of <b>dredge</b> <b>spoils,</b> which, in the state of New Jersey, comprise their most prevalent nesting sites. It generally breeds in areas free of or largely inaccessible to terrestrial predators, such as vegetated islands, sand dunes, flat-topped stacks, building roofs and sometimes amongst bushes on salt marsh islands.

40|$|Abstract: A {{laboratory}} scale study {{was carried out}} using Starkey medium to demonstrate the feasibility of using microbial methods for the bioleaching of heavy metals from contaminated spoils. Acidophilic bacteria, Acidithiobacillus species were isolated from abandoned <b>dredged</b> <b>spoils</b> that were produced during the dredging of oil well access canals in the Niger Delta. Two different composite <b>dredged</b> <b>spoil</b> samples were collected, suspended in Starkey medium and inoculated with {{the culture of the}} bacteria for 1 - 7 weeks. The heavy metal concentration of the sediment prior to the bioleaching are as follows: copper (121. 1 ± 0. 30 mg/kg), cadmium (130. 8 ± 0. 53 mg/kg), chromium (143 ± 1. 00 mg/kg), nickel (138. 5 ± 0. 36 mg/kg), manganese (296 ± 2. 00 mg/kg) and zinc (131. 5 ± 0. 50 mg/kg). During the leaching process, the results of the physico-chemical monitoring show that pH decreased from 3. 5 to < 2. 0, while sulphate, conductivity, redox potential, turbidity, iron and optical density of the leaching broth increased. The physical observations (colour, turbidity, slime production, utilization of sulphur crystals) correlated with the physico-chemical measurements. After seven weeks of bioleaching, the heavy metal recoveries from the spoil 1 are copper (89 %), cadmium (100 %), chromium (56 %), nickel (81 %), manganese (68 %) and lead (96 %). We therefore conclude that Acidithiobacillus sp isolated from abandoned <b>dredged</b> <b>spoils</b> have the potential for the bioremediation of heavy metal contaminated <b>dredged</b> <b>spoils.</b> Key words: Acidithiobacilli Bioleaching Bioremediation Dredging Heavy metal pollution oil exploratio...|$|R
