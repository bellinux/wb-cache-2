60|$|In {{the little}} field beyond, where the plough still turns up musket-balls and cartridge-boxes, took place {{one of those}} {{irregular}} skirmishes between the militiamen and Knyphausen's stragglers, that made the retreat historical. A Hessian soldier, wounded in both legs and utterly helpless, dragged himself to {{the cover of a}} hazel-copse, and lay there hidden for two days. On the third day, maddened by thirst, he managed to creep to the rail-fence of an adjoining farm-house, but found himself unable to mount it or pass through. There was no one in the house but a little girl of six or seven years. He called to her, and in a faint voice asked for water. She returned to the house, as if to comply with his request, but, mounting a chair, took from the chimney a heavily-loaded Queen Anne musket, and, going to the door, took deliberate aim at the helpless intruder, and fired. The man fell back dead, without a groan. She replaced the musket, and, returning to the fence, covered the body with boughs and leaves, until it was hidden. Two or three days after, she related the occurrence in a careless, casual way, and leading the way to the fence, with a piece of bread and butter in her guileless little fingers, pointed out the result of her simple, unsophisticated effort. The Hessian was decently buried, but I could not find out what became of the little girl. Nobody seemed to remember. I trust, that, in after-years, she was happily married; that no Jersey Lovelace attempted to trifle with a heart whose impulses were so prompt, and whose purposes were so sincere. They did not seem to know if she had married or not. Yet it does not seem probable that such simplicity of conception, frankness of expression, and deftness of execution, were lost to posterity, or that they failed, in their time and season, to <b>give</b> <b>flavor</b> to the domestic felicity of the period. Beyond this, the story perhaps has little value, except as an offset to the usual anecdotes of Hessian atrocity.|$|E

40|$|The {{neutrino}} mixing {{parameters are}} presented {{in a number of}} different ways by the various experiments, e. g.

In this paper, we argue that presenting the data in terms of sin^ 2 θ, where θ is the mixing angle appropriate for a given experiment has a direct physical interpretation. For current atmospheric, solar and reactor neutrino experiments, the sin^ 2 θ's are effectively the probability of finding a <b>given</b> <b>flavor</b> in a particular neutrino mass eigenstate. The <b>given</b> <b>flavor</b> and particular mass eigenstate varies from experiment to experiment, however, the use of sin^ 2 θ provides a unified picture of all the data.

All of this is performed in the context of the present experimental status of three neutrino oscillations. Comment: 4 pages, Latex, 2 postscript figure...|$|R

The detection of carcinogenic compounds, such as 3, 4 -benzo(a) pyrene, has led to studies of the effect of the conditions of smoke generation in their production.

40|$|Background: Garlic is used {{world wide}} to <b>give</b> <b>flavor</b> to foods as pecols ect. by {{different}} nations specially by Iranian society. The dominant believe is, the garlic therapeutic effects on patients with gastric discomfort and digesting problems. Objective: {{in this study}} we aimed to investigate the garlic effect on gastric acid and pepsin in both basic and stimulated condition by electrical stimulus of voguesnerve in rat. Methods: in an experimental study two groups of 12 wistar rats were selected. to make the animal unconscious, 50 mg/kg Sodium Tiopantal were given ip. and each rat was tracheostomized, laparatomized, gastrodeodonostomized and then 100 mg/kg of garlic extract dissolved in 9 saline was introduced to stomach of animal. The vagus nerves of both side of the neck released from carotid sheet and stimulated with 15 millivolts, frequency 4 Herts and 1 milisecond wide. The stomach secretions then washed out in following stages; first base, second base, vagus stimulated conditions and reverse to base. The acid amounts of washing were measured by titrometry and pepsin amounts were measured with Anson technique. Results: the acid and pepsin secretion were significantly increased in rats received garlic extracts (p< 0. 000 p< 0. 05 respectively). Stimulation by vagus nerves in control group significantly increased the level of acid (p< 0. 05) and pepsin (p< 0. 05) and garlic treated group had similar secretion rate to stimulated group. Furthermore there were no significant relationship between sex of studied rats. Conclusion: consumption of garlic in the diet has lots of benefits for digestion of foods, so it can be beneficial for those patients with digestive problems, however {{it should be noted that}} people with digestive dysfunction related to increased level of gastric acid or pepsin must avoid garlic consumption. Therefore patient with gastritis and duodenal ulcer are not allowed to take garlic in their diet...|$|E
40|$|A thesis {{submitted}} to the Department of Computer Science and Engineering for the MScAbstract Software development is {{getting more and more}} complex with the improvement of technologies and tools for relative domains. Applying software solutions became an inevitable fact in the modern society. However, the domain conditions and the business environments change rapidly, by making the software norms obsolete. Furthermore, due to the intrinsic properties of software, situation becomes worse. Though the history confines to a few decades, software engineering owns dozens of software process paradigms to date. Introducing new process paradigms may resolve a selected problem, but not the others, and often introduces more issues. Moreover, it is evident that the improvements for the software processes only from the technical orientation do not solve all the issues in rapid changing environments. / Agile software process is a well known, lightweight, and flexible practice which was introduced as a remedy for the above crisis. In many aspects it serves its purpose. It introduced a paradigm shift to the software development for rapid delivery in uncertain environments. However, usage of well known Agile like software paradigms {{as it is in the}} practical conditions is arguable. The Agility concept endures certain flaws due to the native characteristics. Neither, it is the best software paradigm, nor the panacea for all software projects. / This research was derived with new perspectives from rational concepts in different domains, which were not yet been introduced to the Agile software process improvements. The research objectives were focused towards identifying existing bottlenecks in the Agile practices and potential improvements to those.

The conducted study was successful in many aspects, and shows a significant impact to the Agile process.
