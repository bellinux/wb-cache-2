40|$|The {{hypocycloid}} mechanism, in {{its basic}} or modified version, {{can be used}} in reciprocating machines as an alternative solution to the conventional crankshaft-connecting rod system. This kinematic device is quite old in concept, but still gives rise to some research since it has some positive mechanical features, and it allows several functions to be easily combined. In the hypocycloid mechanism in fact the connecting rod has a perfectly sinusoidal straight-line motion, a characteristic that theoretically reduces the piston side thrust to zero and permits a perfect balance of inertia forces without auxiliary rotating shafts. Moreover, by means of a second head with suitable seals that prevent leakage to the crankcase, the lower portion of the cylinder {{can be used as a}} second working chamber without using the crosshead thus reducing the dimensions of the double acting machine. The authors have undertaken theoretical and experimental research in order to evaluate the positive features, in particular those concerning the possibility of the combination of functions, and to compare these characteristics with the evident shortcomings. This has led to the design and construction of a <b>double</b> <b>acting</b> <b>compressor,</b> whose performances have been compared with those of a traditional compressor. A perfectly balanced two-stroke engine, with the scavenging pump separated from the crankcase, has also been constructed and teste...|$|E

The thermal performance of such a plant employing air-turbo generator block and bottoming steam turbine block has been analyzed over a range of pressure ratio (2 - 16) and for different turbine inlet air temperatures (1073, 1273 and 1373 K). The conventional GT combustion chamber is replaced by a burner and heat exchanger. The conventional axial compressor-gas turbine assembly is replaced by <b>double</b> <b>acting</b> reciprocating <b>compressor</b> and a turbo generator assembly. The main objective of using reciprocating compressor is to reduce the work requirement. <b>Double</b> <b>acting</b> reciprocating <b>compressor</b> is used instead of single acting to avoid the pulsating flow. The simulation of thermodynamic model is done by Athena Visual Studio software. For base case configuration, (topping cycle pressure ratio 4, gas flow rate of 90 Nm 3 /hr and turbine inlet temperature (TIT) = 1273 K) the turbocharger unit provides about 35. 9 kW electrical output, while work requirement for compressor and pump unit is about 15. 04 kW respectively. This work is supplies by the steam cycle which is about 17. 05 kW. It is seen from the analysis that up to the pressure ratio 5 (cut-off point) the steam cycle can drive the work consuming components and beyond this pressure ratio an auxiliary power source is required to drive them. It is also seen from the analysis at TIT 1073 K this cut-off point is bellow pressure ratio 4 while at TIT 1373 K the cut-off point is above pressure ratio 5...|$|R

50|$|A <b>double</b> <b>acting</b> {{cylinder}} {{is extended}} and retracted using {{hydraulic or pneumatic}} pressure in both directions. <b>Double</b> <b>acting</b> telescopic cylinders are thus much more complex in design than the single acting type.

50|$|Whenever fluid is {{supplied}} to the cylinder the piston will move. This movement of piston is called as stroke.

The plant is equipped as follows: a vertical engine the make and rated horse power of which are unknown, belted, through a main shaft, to a <b>double</b> <b>acting,</b> horizontal, piston <b>compressor</b> manufactured by the Ingersoll-Sergeant Drill company, and rated at from 8 to 13 horse power depending on the revolution, piston compressor manufactured by the Ingersoll-Sergeant Drill Company, and rated at from 8 to 13 horse power depending on the revolutions per minute and the receiver pressure. A Westinghouse engine with two 6 x 8 single acting cylinders {{was connected to the}} air receiver and used as an air motor. The object of the tests was to determine 1 st the efficiency of the plant, or the ratio of the developed brake horse power of the motor to the indicated horse power of the engine; 2 nd the efficiency between the engine and compressor cylinders, and between the compressor cylinder and the brake on the motor; 2 rd the horse power lost in heating the air and the cooling water. A series of three tests was conducted, the duration of each of which was one hour. Indicator cards were taken on the engine and compressor every five minutes throughout the test; as there was no means of taking cards on the air motor, a rope brake was constructed and used instead. Every five minutes, {{at the same time that}} the indicator cards instead. Every five minutes, at the same time that the indicator cards were taken, the speeds of the engine compressor and motor were noted, and at the same time, the initial and final temperatures of the air and cooling water, and the readings of the scale of the rope brake on the motor were taken. All water which passed through the water jacket of the compressor was carefully weighed and recorder, so that the total weight of water which passed through the jacket during the test was known...|$|R
