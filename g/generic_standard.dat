40|$|Background: The title, Nurse Practitioner, is {{protected}} in most jurisdictions in Australia and in New Zealand {{and the number}} of nurse practitioners is increasing in health services in both countries. Despite this expansion of the role there is scant national or international research to inform development of nurse practitioner competency standards. Objectives: The aim {{of the study was to}} research nurse practitioner practice to inform development of <b>generic</b> <b>standards</b> that could be applied for the education, authorisation and practice of nurse practitioners in both countries. Design: The research used a multi-methods approach to capture a range of data sources including research of policies and curricula, and interviews with clinicians. Data were collected from relevant sources in Australia and New Zealand Settings: The research was conducted in New Zealand and the five states and territories in Australia where, at the time of the research, the title of nurse practitioner was legally protected. Participants: The research was conducted with a purposeful sample of nurse practitioners from diverse clinical settings in both countries. Interview and material data were collected from a range of sources and data were analysed within and across these data modalities. Results: Findings included identification of three <b>generic</b> <b>standards</b> for nurse practitioner practice namely, Dynamic Practice, Professional Efficacy and Clinical Leadership. Each of these standards has a number of practice competencies, each of these competencies with their own performance indicators. Conclusions: <b>Generic</b> <b>Standards</b> for nurse practitioner practice will support a standardised approach and mutual recognition of nurse practitioner authorisation across the two countries. Additionally these research outcomes can more generally inform education providers, authorising bodies and clinicians on the standards of practice for the nurse practitioner whilst also contributing to the current international debate on nurse practitioner standards and scope of practice...|$|R

5000|$|Nadroga (pronounced [...] ), is a {{prominent}} dialect of the West Fijian languages spoken in {{mostly in the}} western region of the Fiji Islands. It is often being used as the <b>generic</b> <b>standard</b> of West Fijian.

Known as one of the prestige dialects of Fiji (which include the dialects of Rewa, Cakaudrove and Lau), Nadroga is popularly identified, and sometimes lampooned, by the change of Standard Fijian 's' to 'h' and the turbulent pitch and rapidness in which the language is spoken and can widely be identified by non-speakers within Fiji as a result of those characteristics. It is a dialect that is less understood by native Fijian speakers due to different sounds and spelling of common words.(Becker E.

Macedonian, for example, in which the articles are suffixed, has столот (stolot), the chair; столов (stolov), this chair; and столон (stolon), that chair.

5000|$|As a consequence, {{southern}} Germany and {{by extension}} both the Swabians and the Bavarians {{came to be seen}} as marked deviations from <b>generic</b> <b>Standard</b> German, and a number of clichés or stereotypes developed. These portrayed the Swabians as stingy, overly serious or prudish petty bourgeois simpletons, as reflected in [...] "The Seven Swabians" [...] (Die sieben Schwaben), one of the Kinder- und Hausmärchen published by the Brothers Grimm. On the positive side, the same stereotype may be expressed in portraying the Swabians as frugal, clever, entrepreneurial and hard-working. The economic recovery of Germany after the Second World War, known as the Wirtschaftswunder, was praised by songwriter Ralf Bendix in his 1964 Schaffe, schaffe Häusle baue / Und net nach de Mädle schaue ("let's work and work, and build a house / and not look out for girls" [...] in Swabian dialect).

40|$|Abstract. Safety-critical {{systems are}} often subject to {{certification}} {{as a way}} to ensure that the safety risks associated with their use are suffi-ciently mitigated. A key requirement of certification is the provision of evidence that a system complies with the applicable standards. The way this is typically organized is to have a <b>generic</b> <b>standard</b> that sets forth the general evidence requirements across different industry sectors, and then to have a derived standard that specializes the <b>generic</b> <b>standard</b> accord-ing to the needs of a specific industry sector. To demonstrate standards compliance, one therefore needs to precisely specify how the evidence requirements of a sector-specific standard map onto those of the generic parent standard. Unfortunately, little research has been done to date on capturing the relationship between generic and sector-specific standards and a large fraction of the issues arising during certification can be traced to poorly-stated or implicit relationships between a <b>generic</b> <b>standard</b> and its sector-specific interpretation. In this paper, we propose an approach based on UML profiles to systematically capture how the evidence re-quirements of a <b>generic</b> <b>standard</b> are specialized in a particular domain. To demonstrate our approach, we apply it for tailoring IEC 61508 – one of the most established standards for functional safety – to the Petroleum industry...|$|E
