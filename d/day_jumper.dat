50|$|The eastern cut-off was {{undoubtedly}} {{the most natural}} and successful variation of the scissors technique. But a few jumpers achieved world-class performances with another variation, the so-called modified scissors.In the modified scissors, the upper body leans back after takeoff, leading to a layout on the back above the bar. This gives a very efficient clearance, but it made for an uncomfortable landing in the early <b>days,</b> when the <b>jumper</b> typically fell into a sandpit.|$|R

5000|$|Speaking to Long's son, Owens said in 1964 that Long {{went to him}} {{and told}} him to try to jump from a spot several inches behind the {{take-off}} board. Since Owens routinely made distances far greater than the minimum of 7.15 m required to advance, Long surmised that Owens would be able to advance safely to the next round without risking a foul trying to push for a greater distance. On his third qualifying jump, Owens was calm and jumped with at least four inches (10 centimeters) to spare, easily qualifying for the finals. In the finals competition later that <b>day,</b> the <b>jumpers</b> exceeded the old Olympic record five times. Owens {{went on to win the}} gold medal in the long jump with 8.06 m while besting Long's own record of 7.87 m. Long won the silver medal for second place and was the first to congratulate Owens: they posed together for photos and walked arm-in-arm to the dressing room. Owens said, [...] "It took a lot of courage for him to befriend me in front of Hitler... You can melt down all the medals and cups I have and they wouldn't be a plating on the twenty-four karat friendship that I felt for Luz Long at that moment".Long's competition with Owens is recorded in Leni Riefenstahl's documentary Olympia - Fest der Völker.|$|R

[...] —A Soap World columnist on Van der Meer's performance as Xanthe.
