Responses were judged by the production of specific antibodies, and compared with the responses obtained when the same vaccines were given by conventional routes. Chickens responded similarly to commercial <b>avian</b> <b>infectious</b> <b>encephalomyelitis</b> vaccine given on food or by eyedrop when antibodies were measured by ELISA, and the vaccine virus spread by contact. Increasing the dose of oral vaccine tenfold gave a more rapid serological response but the levels of antibody were not increased. There was no serological response to commercial infectious laryngotracheitis virus vaccine given on food. An experimental avian adenovirus vaccine produced a serological response when given on food, but higher levels of antibody were produced in response to vaccination by eyedrop.

40|$|International audienceAn {{outbreak}} of neurological disease occurred in pheasant chicks on a game farm in 2007. The disease was first {{seen in the}} tenth hatching of chicks on the farm. Affected chicks showed trembling and incoordination {{from the time of}} hatching, and subsequently blindness and cataract formation was seen in some of the affected chicks at three weeks of age. The peak mortality and culling figure was 21. 0 % in the worst affected hatch, compared with a maximum of 11. 7 % in the first nine hatches. No further cases were evident by 7. 5 weeks of age. Histopathological examination showed a moderate acute encephalomyelitis in some, but not all, of the chicks with neurological signs. The clinical presentation and histopathological findings were typical of vertically transmitted <b>avian</b> <b>encephalomyelitis</b> as seen in chickens, although <b>avian</b> <b>encephalomyelitis</b> virus could not be detected in inoculated embryonated chicken eggs. However, serological testing by ELISA for antibodies to the virus was positive in 4 of 5 affected three-week-old birds and 23 of 29 adult breeding birds and RT-PCR testing of RNA extracted from brain and pancreas tissue of affected chicks yielded nucleotide sequences aligned 82 % and 83 % with three <b>avian</b> <b>encephalomyelitis</b> sequences in a sequence database. The evidence suggested that the neurological disease was attributable to infection with a strain of <b>avian</b> <b>encephalomyelitis</b> virus which appeared to have entered the flock {{at the start of the}} breeding season, and was possibly introduced by carrier pheasants brought on to the farm early in the season...|$|R

40|$|The African penguin (Spheniscus demersus) is an {{endangered}} seabird that breeds {{along the coast}} of Namibia and South Africa, and disease surveillance was identified as a priority for its conservation. Aiming for the establishment of baseline data on the presence of potential pathogens in this species, a comprehensive health assessment (blood smear examination, haematology, biochemistry and serology) was conducted on samples obtained from 578 African penguins at 11 breeding colonies and a rehabilitation centre. There were 68 penguins that were seropositive for at least one of seven pathogens tested: <b>avian</b> <b>encephalomyelitis</b> virus, <b>avian</b> <b>infectious</b> bronchitis virus, <b>avian</b> reovirus, <b>infectious</b> bursal disease virus, Newcastle disease virus, Mycoplasma gallisepticum and Mycoplasma synoviae. All samples were seronegative for avian influenza virus subtypes H 5 and H 7 and infectious laryngotracheitis virus. The apparent prevalence of Babesia sp. and Borrelia sp. in blood smears was consistent with previous studies. Babesia -infected individuals had a regenerative response of the erythrocytic lineage, an active inflammatory response and hepatic function impairment. These findings indicate that African penguins may be exposed to conservation-significant pathogens in the wild and encourage further studies aiming for the direct detection and/or isolation of these microorganisms...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACTAvian {{encephalomyelitis}} {{is caused}} by an Hepatovirus and primarily affects chickens. Chickens of all ages are susceptible to the virus, but the nervous symptoms are manifested only in young chicks, between one to five weeks of age. During the last thirty years, <b>avian</b> <b>encephalomyelitis</b> appeared to be well controlled by breeder vaccination.

Considering the clinical, histopathological, and serological evidences, the disease was confirmed, showing an increase in outbreaks from the last quarter of 2012, extending through 2013.

The examination of purified <b>avian</b> <b>encephalomyelitis</b> virus (AEV) with electron microscopy using negative stain revealed virus particles which were icosahedral in shape, lacked an envelope, and had a mean diameter of 26 ± 3 nm. It was suggested that the viral capsid was composed of 12 capsomers located at the vertices of an icosahedron. The virus was tentatively given a triangulation number of one, and included in the icosahedral class P = 1. The sedimentation coefficient (S₂₀, w) of AEV was determined to be 148 ± 3 S. The bouyant density of the virus in CsC 1 was determined to be 1. 31 to 1. 32 g/ml by infectivity assay following isopycnic gradient centrifugation. The infectivity titer of the virus was reduced by 1. 2 log₁₀ after heating at 56 °C for one hour.

In recent years, very virulent strains of IBDV (vvIBDV), causing severe mortality in chicken, have emerged in Europe, Latin America, South-East Asia, Africa and the Middle East. Infection is via the oro-fecal route, with affected bird excreting high levels of the virus for approximately 2 weeks after infection.|$|R
