This study investigates what influences a strong or weak <b>employer</b> <b>brand</b> has on the preference for total rewards. The results should assist remuneration agents in appropriately leveraging the company’s <b>employer</b> <b>brand</b> value, as a factor, when compiling a total rewards package for potential employees. A questionnaire was developed, asking participants to indicate their preferences relating to total rewards {{in the context of}} their current employer, with regard to stronger and weaker <b>employer</b> <b>brands.</b> Results of the study indicate that potential employees would require financial reward increases in the range of 15 % - 30 % in order to change employment, irrespective of whether it is perceived as a strong or weak <b>employer</b> <b>brand.</b> It was observed that a stronger <b>employer</b> <b>brand</b> could offer increases closer to the bottom of the range compared to weaker <b>employer</b> <b>brands</b> which would have to pay a premium to the top end of the range <b>Employer</b> <b>brand</b> value appears to increase the total reward costs for companies, irrespective of how the brand is perceived.

40|$|<b>Employer</b> <b>brand</b> is an {{application}} of the branding practices to an organization 2 ̆ 7 s people processes. It is also a normative instrument for communicating the employment value proposition, shaping the employee experience, and driving cultural change. This expanded role enables <b>employer</b> <b>brand</b> {{to be a more}} complete and integrated mechanism for managing the overall employee experience. ^ Much of the current literature has focused on a single application of <b>employer</b> <b>brand,</b> that of its usage in recruiting employees. Yet, the role it can play in motivating and aligning existing employees with the organization 2 ̆ 7 s strategic objectives is arguably more valuable. If delivered as promised, the <b>employer</b> <b>brand</b> can be a direct method for influencing and engaging employees. If promises go unmet, however, it can distract and disengage employees. This could then affect the perceived levels of integrity of organizational leadership. Therefore, managing any gaps between the promises and the experience is essential. This notion of espoused-experienced gap management is common to consumer brand management practices, but unexplored in <b>employer</b> <b>brand</b> literature. ^ Understanding the intersection between employee experiences and <b>employer</b> <b>brand</b> practices is essential to identifying potential drivers of espoused-experienced <b>employer</b> <b>brand</b> gaps. Using a cross-case comparison of employee and employer groups from five organizations, this study leveraged customer satisfaction frameworks to explore the characteristics and factors affecting espoused-experienced <b>employer</b> <b>brand</b> congruence. ^ Four significant findings emerged from the study. First, the <b>employer</b> <b>brand</b> gap is a multidimensional construct consisting of four domains and five dimensions rooted in the organization 2 ̆ 7 s culture and requiring ongoing management. Next, data showed that employees evaluate delivery of the <b>employer</b> <b>brand</b> similar to the way customers evaluate their service experiences. This employee as customer metaphor explained the importance of expectations and past experiences in the gap and employee views. Third, the nature of the findings provides the business case for establishing employee research, employee data mining, and employee relationship management capabilities. Fourth, the data suggests that reducing the <b>employer</b> <b>brand</b> gap will positively affect employee engagement. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of this}} Bachelor’s thesis „Creating an <b>employer</b> <b>brand</b> in Outokumpu Tubular Products AS“ is {{to create}} {{practical}} suggestions {{for the company to}} develop <b>employer</b> <b>brand.</b> Outokumpu Tallinn needs <b>employer</b> <b>brand</b> because many of the current employees are reaching retirement age, wherefore it is necessary to recruit new employees to replace them. Suggestions are made on the assumption of theoretical background and empirical data, which consists of interviews with Outokumpu chief executive and employees and also with potential future workers – students. The theoretical background indicated that when creating <b>employer</b> <b>brand</b> the first task is to develop a strategy and then the tactics of implementing desired objectives. When building up the strategy it is essential to create an overview of existing <b>employer</b> <b>brand</b> components. Afterward it is possible to develop the identity of the brand considering workers selection criterion of their future employers. During the process it is necessary {{to keep in mind that}} the <b>employer</b> <b>brand</b> would support business objectives. For gathering empirical data six semi-structured interviews were conducted. Three expertinterviews were carried out with Outokumpu chief executive and two employees, though one employee`s expertise is questionable wherefore it is considered partly as an informant interview. Three informant interviews were carried out with students. All interviews were analyzed with cross-case text analyze method. Interviews which were carried out with employees indicated that Outokumpu appraises the most workers health and democratic managing style. Interviews carried out with students revealed that most important selection criteria for future and current employers is that the work must be interesting and the employer must be caring and understanding towards employees. Main channels where students get information concerned employers are face to face conversation, the internet and educational institutions. Finally recommendations have been made for Outokumpu Tallinn to create an <b>employer</b> <b>brand.</b> Suggestions are divided into strategic and tactical suggestions. For strategy it is advised that Outokumpu should change everyday work more interesting and diverse, develop an honest and democratic managing style, implant and spread existent Scandinavian culture values. Tactical suggestions are divided into economic downfall and growth periods. In an economic downfall period it is necessary to create and launch an internal <b>employer</b> <b>brand</b> and carry out a general reputation campaign. In an economic growth period it is necessary to develop and launch an external <b>employer</b> <b>brand</b> with concrete job offers and to develop an existent internal <b>employer</b> <b>brand...</b>|$|R

40|$|Objective of the Study The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to evaluate what drives <b>employer</b> <b>brand</b> advocacy online at the case company, a Nordic-based multinational IT-company. Operating in an industry where the competition for attracting and retaining top talent is fierce, the case company seeks to make use of its employees to spread the word of the company as a preferable place of work. The study sought answers to the main research question: What drives <b>employer</b> <b>brand</b> advocacy online at a multinational IT company? and three subsequent sub questions: (1) What themes relating to the <b>employer</b> <b>brand</b> of the <b>employer</b> are employees at the case company willing to advocate for? (2) Which factors act as limiting aspects for <b>employer</b> <b>brand</b> advocacy online? and (3) Which motivators support <b>employer</b> <b>brand</b> advocacy at the case company? Methodology and Theoretical Framework The study was conducted as a single case study, combining data from semi-structured interviews and online material gathered from employees’ Twitter feeds. Five employees in the case company’s B 2 B unit were interviewed, with online material gathered from four employees. The theoretical framework includes three levels: (1) thematical topic of advocacy content, (2) limiting factors for advocacy online, and (3) motivational factors behind advocacy. Findings and Conclusions The study resulted in three main findings: (1) employees are most inclined to advocate for interest aspects of the <b>employer</b> <b>brands,</b> and unwilling to advocate for economic aspects, (2) choice of channel is the main factor limiting advocacy, with Twitter and LinkedIn identified as the most suitable channels for <b>employer</b> <b>brand</b> advocacy content, with Facebook deemed unsuitable for the purpose, and (3) advocacy being motivated mainly by two factors: altruism and ability to show expertise. These findings suggest that <b>employer</b> <b>brand</b> advocacy in the context of the case company can be used to communicate about the <b>employer</b> <b>brand,</b> with focus on interest topics. Furthermore, advocacy can be facilitated by focusing on channels that support advocacy, and encouraging employees to advocate by appealing to their willingness to help the employer or their desire to build their personal brand as experts within the industry...|$|R

This study thus adds further knowledge to this research gap.   The purpose of this study is to explain how potential employees’ identification affects the {{relation between}} CSR and the attractiveness of the <b>employer</b> <b>brand.</b> A deductive research approach is adopted in combination with a positivistic approach. The study has a cross-sectional perspective and a quantitative method is used in form of a self-completion questionnaire. This self-completion questionnaire was distributed in Swedish universities to students within the field of industrial engineering and management, and business administration.   The findings of this study show that there is a positive relationship between potential employees’ identification and the attractiveness of the <b>employer</b> <b>brand.</b> In addition, the result indicates that the image of a social responsible employer has some connection to the attractiveness of the <b>employer</b> <b>brand.</b>   The limitations are that the study has a small sample, which results in a lack of generalizability outside the context of this study. The implications are that potential employees’ identification is a concept that affects the attractiveness of the <b>employer</b> <b>brand.</b>   The original value of this study is that it includes potential employees’ identification into the research of CSR and the attractiveness of the <b>employer</b> <b>brand.</b> ...|$|R

It is underpinned by the extant literature on CC dimensions, stakeholder theory and <b>employer</b> <b>brands.</b> The research approach is based on two case studies, comprising three phases: analysis of corporate documentation followed by two phases of semi-structured interviews exploring employees’ perceptions of CC and the link to <b>employer</b> <b>brands.</b> Key findings: An understanding of the positioning of CC in the corporate sustainability strategy and differing foci of CC, including environment, sustainable supply chain and people/culture. The study highlights employee understanding of eight CC dimensions, revealing economic responsibility toward employees as a new dimension. With respect to <b>employer</b> <b>brands,</b> CC initiatives focused on discretionary responsibility towards the natural environment and economic responsibility towards customers are seen as essential; legal, ethical and discretionary responsibility towards community are limited; and discretionary and economic responsibilities towards employees have a strong relationship. A focus on economic responsibilities towards owners has a strong but negative relationship. The theoretical contribution is a conceptual framework of all identified CC dimensions in practice and their relationship to <b>employer</b> <b>brands.</b> Contributions to practice include the importance of benefit packages, work-life balance support, employee development and work environment...|$|R
