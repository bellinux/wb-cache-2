The {{purpose of this study}} is to provide a better understanding of how organizations utilize <b>e-Logistics</b> within their supply chain. To reach this purpose, two research questions are stated, focusing on how can the <b>e-Logistics</b> system be described, as well as how the factors that influence the <b>e-Logistics</b> system can be described. To answer these research questions, a qualitative research approach was used where case studies on Volvo Logistics Corporation in Sweden and Haier Logistics Corporation in China were conducted. From the in-depth interviews and used to collect data, the findings show that the <b>e-Logistics</b> system can be described as a process, as an information system and from the value that it creates.

Empirical findings from the transport and logistics sectors suggest that the <b>e-logistics</b> investments generally do not increase the financial risks of companies except the implementation of computer aided picking systems and radio frequency identification. Meanwhile, only the investment of enterprise resource planning can reduce the financial risks and enhance the profitability at the same time.

40|$|Logistics {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} agribusiness functions due to the idiosyncrasy of food products and the structure of food supply chain. Companies in the food sector typically operate with poor production forecasting, inefficient inventory management, lack of coordination with supply partners. Further, markets are characterised by stern competition, increasing consumer demands and stringent regulation for food quality and safety. Large agribusiness corporations have already turned to <b>e-logistics</b> solutions as a means to sustain competitive advantage and meet consumer demands. There are four types of <b>e-logistics</b> applications: (a) Vertical alliances where supply partners forge long-term strategic alliances based on electronic sharing of critical logistics information such as sales forecasts and inventory volume. Vertical alliances often apply supply chain management (SCM) which is concerned with the relationship between a company and its suppliers and customers. The prime characteristic of SCM is interorganizational coordination: agribusiness companies working jointly with their customers and suppliers to integrate activities along the supply chain to effectively supply food products to customers. <b>E-logistics</b> solutions engender the systematic integration among supply partners by allowing more efficient and automatic information flow. (b) e-tailing, in which retailers give consumers the ability to order food such as groceries from home electronically i. e. using the Internet and the subsequent delivery of those ordered goods at home. (c) Efficient Foodservice Response (EFR), which is a strategy designed to enable foodservice industry to achieve profitable growth by looking at ways to save money for each level of the supply chain by eliminating inefficient practices. EFR provides solutions to common logistics problems, such as transactional inefficiency, inefficient plant scheduling, out-of-stocks, and expedited transportation. (d) Contracting, a means of coordinating procurement of food, beverages and their associated supplies. Many markets and supply chains in agriculture are buyer-driven where the buyers in the market tend to set prices and terms of trade. Those terms can include the use of electronic means of communication to support automatic replenishment of goods, management of supply and inventory. The results of the current applications of <b>e-logistics</b> in food sector are encouraging for Greek agribusiness. Companies need to become aware of and evaluate the value-added by those applications which are a sustainable competitive advantage, optimisation of supply chain flows, and meeting consumer demands and food safety regulations. E-business diffusion has shown that typically first-movers gain a significant competitive advantage and the rest companies either eventually adopt the new systems or see a significant decline in their trading partners and perish. <b>E-logistics</b> solutions typically require huge investments in hardware and software and skilled personnel, which is an overt barrier for most Greek companies. Large companies typically are first-movers but small and medium enterprises (SMEs) need institutional support in order to become aware that <b>e-logistics</b> systems can be fruitful for them as well...|$|E

40|$|There are two newly {{emerging}} research {{issues in the}} enterprise information systems literature. One is the scalability issue for rapidly increasing choreographic volumes between interrelated organizations. The other is the business intelligence issue for traceable and monitorable business processes and services interchanging e-Business data and applications across organizations. Based upon these emerging issues, through a functional extension of the ebXML technology we have developed a process-driven e-Business service integration (BSI) system, which is named ‘e-Lollapalooza’. It consists of three major components – the Choreography Modeler coping with the process-driven collaboration issue, the Runtime & Monitoring Client for coping with the business intelligence issue and the EJB-based BSI Engine coping with the scalability issue. This paper particularly focuses on the e-Lollapalooza’s development aspects for supporting the ebXML-based choreography and orchestration among the engaged organizations in a process-driven multiparty collaboration for <b>e-Logistics</b> and e-Commerce services.

Global competitiveness places more pressure on companies to improve their delivery performance of products and services to customers. In an effort {{to improve the quality}} of delivery service, companies have outsourced their logistics services including packing, warehousing (inventory management) and shipping of goods to customers. Communication plays an important role in integrating the activities along the logistics value chain. Information technologies such as Electronic Data Interchange (EDI), the Internet, World Wide Web (WWW) and E-Commerce have contributed greatly to improving communication with partners in the logistics chain. In particular, real-time information systems such as web-based logistics information systems help to improve 3 PL services. In this paper, a case study of <b>E-Logistics</b> is used to illustrate the implications of Information Technology (IT) in particular the Internet, WWW and EDI on the performance of the logistics value chain is presented.

40|$|Abstract. The paper quantitatively models <b>e-logistics</b> supply chains {{for urban}} {{business-to-consumer}} {{relationships in the}} case of grocery product delivery. Orders are placed through internet, but deliveries are made at the customer’s home. The model takes special account of the effect produced on logistics variables (distances, times, costs, shipments, stops, etc.), by the way in which orders are received, and includes the delivery in time windows in urban areas. The findings are of interest both to transportation planners and <b>e-logistics</b> industry. Planners should design parking space and loading/unloading procedures so that the deliveries are made efficiently and with little traffic perturbation, and the industry should start getting ready to understand the high cost of this quality of service: the “picking ” process has a high cost that cannot be assumed in high volumes and everyday the good (the street is contemplated as a scarce social good) and bad (double parking, bus lane blocking, etc. causing additional traffic congestion) use of the streets will likely cost more money. An application to Barcelona, Spain, for the food distribution sector (supermarkets) shows that, for the previously stated reasons, the current industry procedures are only feasible for very low demand share (less than 10 %). 1...|$|E

40|$|In global {{business}} competition, companies believe greater transparency in supply-chain operations and collaboration {{is very important}} for success. Transparency brings accountability and responsibility. This openness in the supply-chain allows companies to see how their suppliers are performing, from their sourcing of raw materials to their delivery to the retail outlet. Achieving greater transparency in the supply chain requires the development of comprehensive <b>e-Logistics</b> tools, which provide all players with open communication and shared information in every stage of the order-to-delivery process. Supply-chain transparency in ordering, inventory and transportation is a prerequisite for optimization and is critical for making business decisions.
