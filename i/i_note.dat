500|$|Meanwhile, the {{legitimate}} government had relocated to Iași, in besieged Moldavia. Late in 1916, it court-martialled Filitti in absentia, and {{sentenced him to}} death for the crime of high treason. By January 1918, the collapse of Russian forces on the Eastern Front led the Iași administration into negotiating a separate peace with the Central Powers. Germanophile Alexandru Marghiloman took over as Premier, in what seemed to spell a moral victory for the pro-German camp. However, Filitti was drawing closer to the more disgruntled Germanophiles, led by P. P. Carp, who wanted to sign peace on their own terms: [...] "I ask Carp, should he leave to negotiate for Romania, to take me with him. He says that he'll take along his son. <b>I</b> <b>note</b> that one does not exclude the other. He agrees" [...] (January 12, 1918). Filitti was also upset that Marghiloman himself had not yet offered him a high diplomatic post during negotiations over the Buftea-Bucharest Peace Treaty, and noted that the Ententist King, Ferdinand I, [...] "made it hard" [...] {{for him to be}} accepted back into the diplomatic corps. As noted by Georgeta Filitti, Ferdinand vetoed successive proposals to rehire him as public servant.|$|E
500|$|When Madonna {{started writing}} {{the songs on}} the album, she was {{inspired}} by different situations, like having guitar lessons and getting an idea, or sometimes Ahmadzaï would send over a rough demo to her without the basic chord progression. The songs on American Life and their lyrics were developed like that. Explaining her writing process, Madonna told Q magazine that the [...] "music has to jar my brain in terms of lyrics. Sometimes I write free verse. I have a journal and <b>I</b> <b>note</b> down ideas I get from newspapers and books". Madonna also remembered Ahmadzaï's downbeat existentialism regarding the condition of society around them, and the long discussions they had into the night, which ultimately reflected into the songwriting as anxiety they felt in their heart. American Life was deemed {{by some as a}} concept album featuring political themes based around the United States, with Madonna explaining that she felt [...] "like America has changed over the years and that a lot of our values seem to be materially oriented and so superficial. And we all seem to be obsessed with fame {{just for the sake of}} fame, no matter what— sell your soul to the devil if that's what it takes. And we're also completely obsessed with the way we look." [...] Madonna recalled that even she had been through such trials and those musings came out in the writing of the first three songs, the title track, [...] "Hollywood" [...] and [...] "I'm So Stupid". John Norris from MTV described them as a trilogy, and an indicator of Madonna's reassessment of her life while discussing things she wishes to put behind her. Madonna partly agreed, saying that the tracks are extensions of one another, and portray her desire of giving importance to less noteworthy things, and how she could come out of that [...] "illusion". Madonna discussed the materialistic themes of the record and her personal encounters which have led to the composition with MTV saying: ...|$|E

Fontaine examined three pieces of duct tape found on Caylee's remains for fingerprints, and said she did not find fingerprints but did not expect to, given the months the tape and the remains had been outdoors and exposed to the elements, stressing that any oil or sweat from a person's fingertips would have long since deteriorated. Though Fontaine showed the findings to her supervisor, she did not initially try to photograph the heart-shaped adhesive, explaining, [...] "When I observe something is unexpected, <b>I</b> <b>note</b> it and continue with my examination." [...] During the defense's cross-examination, Fontaine explained that when she examined the sticker evidence a second time, after subjecting the tape to dye testing, [...] "It was no longer visible." [...] She said that other FBI agents had tested the duct tape in the interim.|$|E
