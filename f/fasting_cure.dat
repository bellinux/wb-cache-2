40|$|To {{save energy}} and raise molding and coremaking productivity, the {{synthetic}} procedure of novolaks for the shell process was investigated. The {{study indicated that}} it was difficult to obtain <b>fast</b> <b>curing</b> novolaks under strongly acidic conditions alone. A novel synthetic procedure was proposed for preparing novolaks in a two-step manner, a divalent metal salt catalyzed novolak preparation followed by a strong acid catalyzed novolak preparation. The optimum conditions for the two-step procedure were determined by orthogonal experiment design.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{determine}} the bond tensile strength of a polycarbonate sandwich joined with a <b>fast</b> <b>cured</b> epoxy adhesive. A 6. 5 kW single mode microwave unit operating at 2. 5 GHz was used to <b>fast</b> <b>cure</b> the epoxy adhesive. The samples of polycarbonate were prepared in accordance with ASTM D 2095 - 72 (modified) and glued with a two-part epoxy adhesive mix employing a doping agent for rapid cure in the microwave unit. Two operational parameters, cure time, microwave power and one processing parameter, dopant concentration, were varied to determine their effect on the resulting bond strength. These rapidly-cured samples were then tensile tested to determine the joint strength {{as a function of the}} operational and processing parameters. The fracture surfaces of the adhesively joined polycarbonate samples were examined using light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. A polariscope was employed to determine the variation in stress in the adhesive joint. Conventional curing of epoxy adhesive polycarbonate sandwiches was also undertaken. The tensile strength of these conventionally-cured bonded samples were then compared to that of <b>fast</b> <b>cure</b> using microwave. Results of the processing and testing program indicate the effect of dopant concentration, curing time and microwave absorbed power on the resulting mechanical strength of the adhesively bonded joint...|$|R

40|$|AbstractGrouting is a {{major method}} used to prevent water and mud inrush in tunnels and {{underground}} engineering. In this paper, the current situation of control and prevention of water and mud inrush is summarized and recent advances in relevant theories, grout/equipment, and critical techniques are introduced. The time-variant equations of grout viscosity at different volumetric ratios were obtained based on the constitutive relation of typical <b>fast</b> <b>curing</b> grouts. A large-scale dynamic grouting model testing system (4000  mm ×  2000  mm ×  5  mm) was developed, and the diffusions of cement and <b>fast</b> <b>curing</b> grouts in dynamic water grouting were investigated. The results reveal that the diffusions of cement grouts and <b>fast</b> <b>curing</b> grouts are U-shaped and asymmetric elliptical, respectively. A multi-parameter real-time monitoring system (ϕ =  1. 5  m, h =  1. 2  m) was developed for the grouting process to study the diffusion and reinforcement mechanism of grouting in water-rich faulted zone. A high early strength cream-type reinforcing/plugging grout, a high permeability nano-scale silica gel grout, and a high-expansion filling grout were proposed for the control of water hazards in weak water-rich faulted zone rocks, water inrush in karst passages, and micro-crack water inrush, respectively. Complement technologies and equipment for industrial applications were also proposed. Additionally, a novel full-life periodic dynamic water grouting with the critical grouting borehole as the core was proposed. The key techniques for the control of water inrush in water-rich faulted zone, jointed fissures and karst passages, and micro-crack water inrush were developed...|$|R

In this investigation the layer consists of a liquid mixture of epoxy resin with aluminium particles is cured using microwave heating and is further used in rapid product development. The issue of statistical modelling of the <b>fast</b> <b>curing</b> process of thin epoxy resin layers using microwave heating is addressed in this paper. The modelling by a linear regression method is based on information available from the curing process as well as from data collected performing the Dynamic Scanning Calorimetry analysis. To reach the state of dimensional stability, the curing temperature of the layer material was controlled using two options. First, through the reduction of the microwave power and second, through altering the turntable speed so that the microwave exposure time of the layer was monitored. This operation was controlled using appropriate computer software...|$|R

40|$|Through {{assistance}} from NASA's Kennedy Space Center, Dow Corning developed a strong, heat-protecting coating with applications {{in a variety}} of fields. Previously, NASA used silicate coatings that simply failed to adequately protect, which resulted in the frequent recoating of the damaged areas. The enormous expense of this repeat procedure led Kennedy's Materials Science Laboratory to investigate the possibilities of ablative-type coatings. The investigations resulted {{in the creation of a}} silicone ablative material known as the Dow Corning 3 - 6376 <b>Fast</b> <b>Cure</b> Elastomer. The new product, which does not require a primer coating, is a 100 percent silicone material. It is currently used in the automotive and aerospace industries and serves as an exceptional coating for engine compartment firewalls. Dow Corning's <b>Fast</b> <b>Cure</b> Elastomer has also proved to be an effective sealant. Moreover, it reduces the turnaround time for reuse of the launch structure because of fewer refurbishing operations. This means that NASA is not held up due to repairs when it comes time to launch another Shuttle. To date, the Agency has launched dozens of successful missions without the need for recoating...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to provide a useful approach of polymer synthesis for accelerating the <b>fast</b> <b>cure</b> of phenol-urea-formaldehyde (PUF) resin as wood adhesive by optimizing its structure and composition. The PUF resins containing high contents of very reactive groups such as para-methylol groups were synthesized by reacting methylolurea, phenol, and formaldehyde in the presence of magnesium oxide (MgO) as catalyst. The effects of synthesis parameters including F/(P + U), OH/P, and MgO/P mole ratios on the structure, composition, curing characteristics, and their relationships of PUF resins were investigated. The results indicated that MgO seemed to be an efficacious catalyst for PUF resin synthesis and promote its <b>faster</b> <b>cure.</b> The increase in the F/(P + U) mole ratio or/and OH/P mole ratio appeared to be beneficial for the formation of para-methylol groups and cocondensed methylene linkages between phenolic methylol groups and urea units, and for the removal of unreacted urea. In case of Catalyst/P mole ratio, an appropriate dosage of added metal-ion was very important for synthesizing the high-content reactive groups of PUF resins, otherwise leading to the reverse effects...|$|R

50|$|While Rosendale cement was {{extremely}} popular for {{the foundation of}} buildings (e.g. Statue of Liberty, Capitol Building, Brooklyn Bridge) and lining of water pipes, its long curing time {{of at least one}} month made it unpopular after World War I in the construction of highways and bridges, and many states and construction firms turned to Portland cement. Because of the switch to Portland cement, {{by the end of the}} 1920s, only one of the 15 Rosendale cement companies had survived. In the early 1930s, it was discovered that Portland cement, with a <b>faster</b> <b>curing</b> time, was not as durable, especially for highways. As a result, some states stopped building highways and roads with cement. Engineer Bertrain H. Wait, whose company had worked on the construction of the New York City's Catskill Aqueduct, was impressed with the durability of Rosendale cement and devised a blend of Rosendale and synthetic cements which had the good attributes of both: durable and a much <b>faster</b> <b>curing</b> time. Mr. Wait convinced the New York Commissioner of Highways to construct near New Paltz, New York, an experimental section of highway using one sack of Rosendale to six sacks of synthetic cement. It proved a success, and for decades the Rosendale-synthetic cement blend was common in highway and bridge construction.|$|R
