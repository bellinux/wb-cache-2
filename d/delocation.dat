Such rounds have been limited by the gradual opening of the national countries, as well as by changes in East European ideology and politics. Hence, {{about the end of the}} 90 ’s, European car-building industry shows considerable disparity, East to West. In the car-building companies’ vision, East-European car-building development potential is basically sustained by both the car low penetration rate, and the low labor cost. On the long term run, gradual valorizing of the East-european trading, with increasing labor costs, may read as a wearing thin of the competitive advantage in car-building industries, as well as problem issues of novel territory attractiveness needing permanent boosting. Country-to-country comparative analysis indicates that competitive advantage of car-building has not gone down in all of the West-European States.

Even if this choice has always been relevant, globalization has turned the issue, whether to locate inside or outside the district, from an intra- to an inter-national issue. The fear is <b>delocation,</b> that is, the implosion of the district due to the flight of innovative newcomers to distant locations. This negative effect could offset the benefits that the district reaps {{both in terms of}} cost reduction through foreign production in low wage countries and in terms of access to new markets.

40|$|We {{show that}} {{agglomeration}} forces can reverse standard international-tax-competition results.

Moreover, split-the-difference tax harmonization can make both nations worse off. This may help explain why tax harmonisation which is Pareto improving in the standard model is so difficult in the real world. The key theoretical insight is that agglomeration forces create quasi-rents that can be taxed without inducing <b>delocation.</b> This suggests that the tax game is something subtler than a race to the bottom. Advanced 'core' nations may act like limit-pricing monopolists toward less advanced 'periphery' countries. Since agglomeration rents are a bell-shaped function of the level of integration, the equilibrium tax gap in our tax game is also bell shaped. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{behavior}} of firms towards weak protection of labor standards in developing countries (South). A less than perfectly elastic labor supply in the South gives firms an oligopsony position {{in the labor market}} tempting them to strategically reduce output to cut wages. In an open economy, competitors operating where labor standards are recognized meanwhile enjoy less aggressive competitors and raise output. <b>Delocation</b> also increases Southern wages and triggers a competition effect, lowering ex post output and hence potential profits of a relocating firm. These effects reduce relative profitability of moving production to the South casting doubts on traditional beliefs that multinationals are attracted to regions with lower wages. Moreover, adopting a minimum wage policy in the South eliminates the oligopsony distortion and improves competitiveness of Southern firms in the world product market. It also enhances consumer and wage surplus in the South and hence unambiguously raises Southern welfare. Copyright � 2007 The Author; Journal compilation � 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd. ...|$|E

This paper demonstrates that the Doha proposal can be effective when environmental policy and its trade obligations are endogenous. Under plausible circumstances, ratification by a non-signatory to the MEA along with free trade as a reward is the unique equilibrium outcome. <b>Delocation</b> to pollution havens does not occur, as optimal tariffs are positive if standards are not adopted.

40|$|We {{review the}} {{theoretical}} links between growth and agglomeration. Growth, {{in the form}} of innovation, can be at the origin of catastrophic spatial agglomeration in a cumulative process à la Myrdal. One of the surprising features of the Krugman (1991) model, was that the introduction of partial labour mobility in a standard ‘new trade model’ with trade costs could lead to catastrophic agglomeration. The growth analog to this result is that the introduction of endogenous growth in the same type of ‘new trade model’ can lead to the same result. A difference with the labour mobility version is that the results are easier to derive from the analytical point of view in the endogenous growth version. We show that the relation between growth and agglomeration depends crucially on capital mobility between regions. The absence of capital mobility {{is at the heart of}} the possibility of spatial agglomeration with catastrophe. In addition, growth alters the process of location even without catastrophe. In particular, and contrary to the fundamentally static models of the New Economic Geography, spatial concentration of economic activities may be consistent with a process of <b>delocation</b> of firms towards poor regions. Finally, the presence of localized technology spillovers implies that spatial agglomeration is conducive to growth. agglomeration; capital mobility; geography; growth...|$|E

Chapter 1 studies how {{the presence of}} a multinational leads to a technology transfer to its local suppliers and also modifies the degree of backward linkages in the local economy. It identifies in which cases a multinational increases the level of backward linkages when it enters hosts markets and it investigates when the multinational could even benefit itself from transferring technology to its local suppliers. Chapter 2 deals with <b>delocation</b> and welfare. It shows that welfare in the North increases when the host country is not technologically too lagged and that vertical technology transfer to the South {{plays a major role in}} enhancing welfare of workers-consumers in the North and in the South. Finally, chapter 3 provides a Schumpeterian growth model endogenously generating demand-driven patterns of vertical intra-industrial trade. It gives a new explanation of the endogenous emergence of multi-location, multi-quality firms. The existence of such firms and income inequality among consumers both across and within countries then generate and shape rich patterns of intra-industrial vertical trade and FDI, with the extent of income disparities also conditioning the incentives to invest in R&D.
