40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel methodology {{to develop a}} silent dual communication based on subvocal speech. Two electronic systems were developed for people’s wireless communication. The system has 3 main stages. The first stage is the subvocal speech electromyographic signals acquisition, in charge to extract, condition, encode and transmit the system development. This signals were digitized and registered from the throat and sent to an embedded a raspberry pi. In this device was implemented the processing, {{as it is called}} the second stage, which besides to store, assumes conditioning, extraction and pattern classification of subvocal speech signals. Mathematical techniques were used as Entropy, Wavelet analysis, Minimal Squares and Vector Support Machines, which were applied in Python free environment program. Finally, in the last stage in charge to communicate by wireless means, were developed the two electronic systems, by using 4 signal types, to classify the words: Hello, intruder, <b>hello</b> <b>how</b> <b>are</b> <b>you?</b> and I am cold to perform the silent communication. Additionally, in this article we show the speech subvocal signals’ recording system realization. The average accuracy percentage was 72. 5 %, and includes a total of 50 words by class, this is 200 signals. Finally, it demonstrated that using the Raspberry Pi it is possible to set a silent communication system, using subvocal. speech signals...|$|E

Every one seems to get longer and longer. Did you get to bed early Sunday night, young lady? You’d better have, {{you must have been}} tired, I know I was. I’m going to hit the sack right after I mail this. I feel like the wreck of the Hesperus. Did you have any snow down thar in New York? We had our first snow squall today, and man, is it cold. I was flying the first period this morning, and I could see the storm coming in from the North West like a huge white curtain. It was the first time I ever saw a snow storm from the air. It didn’t stick though, but it was snow. I knew {{something}} important had to happen this week. I’ve been looking over the financial situation, hon, and allowing for everything, a small amount of recreation included, I ought to have $ 4. 38 saved by March if I budget myself very carefully. Not bad for me, eh? But seriously, angel, it’s not as bad as all that. I’ve got some pretty good ideas as to how to raise some money, and I was talking to a fellow here that just bought an engagement and a wedding ring, and they’re not too expensive, at least not $ 500. But as you said before, you don’t get married every day, so by God we’re going to have the best. But most of all, darling, I want you to be happy. If there is ever any doubt in your mind, just let me know. We’ve still got {{a lot of things to}} settle, hon. I want to have a long talk with you this weekend. Oh by the way, have you told your father yet? I wonder what he’ll have to say. Maybe I better send him another carton of cigarettes. Well hon, the sergeant just finished drawing my bath, I don’t want to keep him waiting. Give my best to your family. Your mother is really marvelous. I love you.

O. now and it’s crowded as hell, in fact all you see {{all over}} town are {{soldiers}} and more soldiers. I ate dinner at the Brooklyn Spaghetti House. It was pretty crumby. This afternoon we stood retreat, that’s when they lower the flag. It was very impressive {{lined up on the}} huge parade ground were about 15, 000 men. We all saluted while the flag was lowered and the band played the national anthem. Then we passed in review in front of the C. O., who, by the way, is now a Colonel, General Brady having left. There was one quite funny thing about the ceremony. The C. O. stands about 500 feet from the main group- consisting of all the wing group in camp. He gives his orders to the adjutant who in turn has to give the orders of the C. O. to the O. D. who is about 200 feet from the C. O. But in order to do this he (the adjutant) has to walk to the O. D. (officer of the day). He covers that 200 feet in record time but he can’t run. It’s very comical to see him scooting back and forth between these two men, his gate being quite similar to a man in a walking race. I got your package today hon, and thanks alot. That fruit cake will hit the spot after a good workout on the drill field. And that candy is just what I like with the chewy centers. Thanks again, angel. Mom, when you address my letters don’t put the training group number down, tent is 1176. For one thing it’s not necessary, and another thing I 2 ̆ 7 m in 1177 now. Jim Koenigar is shipping out Sunday, boy is he lucky. I’m learning {{a hell of a lot}} down here. Yesterday I field stripped a carbine. An automatic rifle that fires 15 shots as fast as you can pull the trigger. It’s a sweet piece. (Rifles aren’t called that here, they’re pieces). Next week we’ll start using the Thompson Submachine Gun! I got a seven page letter from Judy today, also one from Charlie, and a card from Ace. I thrilled to hear that you rented the apartment, sweetheart, and I think is a good price. If I’m still here when you go to Texas try ad work it so you can stop by and see me on the way. It’s starting get damned cold down here. We had frost this morning, and along with the cold we had to go over the obstacle course right after breakfast. This course is really terrific. It starts off with a 3 foot handle, then a 3 foot hurdle, an 8 foot wall, followed by a ladder, horizontal to the ground which we have to hang on to and reach from rung to rung. Then there is a 2 foot hurdle, a 20 foot ladder we have to climb up and over and down the other side. The next thing we meet is a 5 foot wall then a bunch of logs we have to walk over, succeeded by a log over a stream that we have to cross hand over hand. This we call Guadalcanal. Quite a few fellows fall in the drink. Then finally we come upon a low tunnel we have to crawl through. One fellow went over this course in 2 min and 14 seconds. That’s really goin’ some. My xo!x?o watch broke today so I’ll have to have it fixed, for a change. That’s all I do to that hairy thing, break it and have it fixed. Did I tell you I got a letter from Nan? Thank her for me. Well I have to get back to camp beautiful so take care of yourself and tell Bobby to get rid of that cold. I feel very flattered that she should cry over my letter.

40|$|The role of mothers, the {{constitution}} of families, {{and the power of}} their stories are the bedrock of my thesis, which is the first 90 pages of a novel entitled Playing House. In it, I hope to investigate the denotation and connotation of the words mother and family, in order to investigate the tension between the two. I hope to complicate society 2 ̆ 7 s assumption that a womb makes a woman a mother, and the lack of one prohibits it. Many times, we are mothered by someone other than our biological mother [...] sometimes for the better and sometimes not. Sometimes to our liking and sometimes not. And all too often, women are considered 2 ̆ 2 abnormal 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 inferior 2 ̆ 2 because they are {{not a member of the}} elitist motherhood club. In Jeff Skinner 2 ̆ 7 s creative writing seminar, he instructed fiction writers to ask themselves two questions: (1) Why this day? and (2) How can I raise the stakes?. Recently, my best friend has joined the ranks of 2 ̆ 2 infertile 2 ̆ 2 women who will stop at no cost or inconvenience to conceive a child. And I thought, perfect ! That would complicate Beth, the main character, wonderfully. She is surrounded by mothers in the novel who never let her forget that she is not one. How would she feel, how would she cope with the reality the scandalous evidence of her husband 2 ̆ 7 s affair and subsequent child when she must face the loneliness of her infertility? It was not until I wrote the last words on the page that I knew the answer. For the scope of my thesis, I expect to work through the initial 95 pages. My first goal is to clarify the desires of my main characters: Beth and Michael. Generally, what do they want from each other? What do they want in each scene? What things do they desire, both tangible and intangible? Answering these questions will result in a better, fuller portrait of each character. Also, I plan on spending time visualizing the characters in order to make them more alive in my mind and therefore, more realistic on the page. Secondly, I expect to condense or even eliminate the long, irrelevant sections of the main characters 2 ̆ 7 backstory and the secondary characters 2 ̆ 7 subplots. For example, the focus of the narrative should be Beth and Michael 2 ̆ 7 s attempt to hold their marriage together while adopting an unexpected child. Much to the dismay of an engaged reader, the narrative often strays faultily to Beth and Michael 2 ̆ 7 s college days or the extraneous marriages of John and Rachel, Trevor and Lauren, or Beth 2 ̆ 7 s mother and father. I also intend to add physical and environmental details to the novel. I hope to flesh out my characters and their dialogue by providing more description of their physical actions and appearance. In addition, I hope to gain credibility as an author/observer by more vividly describing the environment. I tell my students 2 ̆ 2 setting should be connected to conflict [...] . it is not haphazard. 2 ̆ 2 Yet again, I am tasting my own medicine. Lastly, a change that I expect to make is Beth 2 ̆ 7 s profession [...] from college professor to high school teacher. The fact that she is an educator and that she shares a campus with her husband is important to the themes and the conflict of the novel; however, the unlikelihood that a woman not yet 30 is already a college professor undermines the novel 2 ̆ 7 s credibility. Making Beth a high school teacher keeps the subtle theme of the tension between education and athletics in tact. However, the conflict of the novel requires Beth and Michael to share a work environment, so the high school where Beth teaches will remain on the same campus as the college where Michael works. Based on the discussion from my thesis defense, I have also made the following revisions: First, I softened the exchange with the mother and revealed more back story based on my explanation as to why the mother was so bitter, in that the grandparents 2 ̆ 2 wrote her off 2 ̆ 2 essentially. That information comes into play as Beth now sympathizes with her mother, although she still swears to never become like her, and her mother gives her valuable advice about the need to move on from mistakes. Also, I narrated some of the dialogue that resembled dialogue in a drama, in that hopefully most of the dialogue included now is necessary to the advancement of plot and/or characterization and not the general, 2 ̆ 2 <b>Hello,</b> <b>how</b> <b>are</b> <b>you?</b> 2 ̆ 2 exchange. Next, I added some literary allusions to Beth 2 ̆ 7 s character that hopefully add to her realism as an English teacher. Lastly, I cleaned up a great deal of the wordiness and punctuation...|$|E
