40|$|Derivatives of {{d-xylose}} and d-glucose, {{in which}} the hydroxy groups at C- 5, and C- 5 and C- 6 were replaced by fluorine, <b>hydrogen</b> and <b>azide,</b> were synthesized and used as substrates of the NAD(P) H-dependent aldehyde reduction catalysed by aldose reductases isolated from the yeasts Candida tenuis, C. intermedia and Cryptococcus flavus. Steady-state kinetic analysis showed that, {{in comparison with the}} parent aldoses, the derivatives were reduced with up to 3000 -fold increased catalytic efficiencies (k(cat) /K(m)), reflecting apparent substrate binding constants (K(m)) decreased to as little as 1 / 250 and, for d-glucose derivatives, up to 5. 5 -fold increased maximum initial rates (k(cat)). The effects on K(m) mirror the relative proportion of free aldehyde that is available in aqueous solution for binding to the binary complex enzyme-NAD(P) H. The effects on k(cat) reflect non-productive binding of the pyranose ring of sugars; this occurs preferentially with the NADPH-dependent enzymes. No transition-state stabilization energy seems to be derived from hydrogen-bonding interactions between enzyme-NAD(P) H and positions C- 5 and C- 6 of the aldose. In contrast, unfavourable interactions with the C- 6 group are used together with non-productive binding to bring about specificity (6 - 10 kJ/mol) in a series of d-aldoses and to prevent the reaction with poor substrates such as d-glucose. Azide introduced at C- 5 or C- 6 destabilizes the transition state of reduction of the corresponding hydrogen-substituted aldoses by approx. 4 - 9 kJ/mol. The total transition state stabilization energy derived from hydrogen bonds between hydroxy groups of the substrate and enzyme-NAD(P) H is similar for all yeast aldose reductases (yALRs), at approx. 12 - 17 kJ/mol. Three out of four yALRs manage on only hydrophobic enzyme-substrate interactions to achieve optimal k(cat), whereas the NAD(P) H-dependent enzyme from C. intermedia requires additional, probably hydrogen-bonding, interactions with the substrate for efficient turnover...|$|R

40|$|Flavins {{are thought}} to be {{important}} chromophores for chronic photo-induced skin injury, but the mechanism is not well known. We have reported that the primary cytotoxicity remaining in ultraviolet A-irradiated riboflavin solution is attributable to hydrogen peroxide. Because the dermis is more hypoxic than the atmosphere, we investigated the cytotoxicity of riboflavin solution during and after ultraviolet A irradiation under hypoxia. Riboflavin solution showed stronger cytotoxicity during irradiation under hypoxia than under air. Riboflavin solution that had been irradiated under hypoxia at lower ultraviolet A doses showed stronger cytotoxicity and contained more hydrogen peroxide than solution irradiated under air at the same doses. At higher ultraviolet A doses, however, the cytotoxicity and hydrogen peroxide quantity were similar in riboflavin solutions irradiated under different oxygen conditions. The effect of a singlet oxygen quencher, sodium azide, on the induction of cytotoxicity and production of hydrogen peroxide by ultraviolet A irradiation of riboflavin solution was examined. The presence of sodium azide in the solution during ultraviolet A irradiation suppressed the cytotoxicity and hydrogen peroxide production to similar levels at various ultraviolet A doses regardless of oxygen conditions.

40|$|The general aim of {{the thesis}} was to deduce whether {{selected}} naturally occurring flavonoids (genistein, epicatechin gallate (EC), epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), baicalin) attenuate various secondary insults that may cause death of ganglion cells in primary open angle glaucoma (POAG). An ischemic insult to the rat retina significantly causes the inner retina to degenerate indexed by changes of various antigens, proteins and mRNAs located to amacrine and ganglion cells. These changes are blunted in animals treated with genistein {{as has been shown}} for ECGC. Studies conducted on cells (RGC- 5 cells) in culture showed that hydrogen peroxide, L-buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) /glutamate and serum deprivation (mimicking oxidative stress), rotenone, sodium azide (affecting mitochondria function in specific ways) and light (where the mitochondria are generally affected) all generated reactive oxygen species and caused death of RGC- 5 cells. EGCG was able to attenuate cell death caused by <b>hydrogen</b> peroxide, sodium <b>azide</b> and rotenone. Only EC was able to attenuate BSO/glutamate-induced cell death, in addition to cell death caused by hydrogen peroxide and rotenone. Genistein had no positive effect on cell death in experiments carried out on RGC- 5 cells. Exposure of RGC- 5 cells to flavonoids showed that EC and EGCG increased the mRNA expression of endogenous antioxidants such as HO-l (heme oxygenase 1) and Nrf- 2 (nuclear erythroid factor-z-related factor 2). Light insult, rotenone and sodium azide activate the p 38 (protein kinase 38) pathway, while only light and rotenone activate the JNK (c-Jun amino-terminal kinase) pathway. Serum deprivation affects mitochondrial apoptotic proteins causing an increase in the ratio of Bax/Bcl 2 (Bax: Bcl- 2 -associated X protein; Bcl- 2 : B-cell lymphoma 2). An insult of light to RGC- 5 cells, unlike that induced by sodium azide, is inhibited by necrostatin-I and causes an activation of AlF (apoptosis-inducing factor) with alpha-fodrin being unaffected. These studies suggest that ganglion cell death caused by insults as may occur in POAG involves various cellular signaling pathways. The selected flavonoids have diverse actions in increasing cellular defense mechanisms, and in negating the effects of ischemia and specific types of oxidative stress. The results argue for the possible use of flavonoids in the treatment of POAG to slow down ganglion cell death. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|AMP-activated {{protein kinase}} (AMPK) has been {{proposed}} to be a therapeutic target for patients with type 2 diabetes and the metabolic syndrome. In skeletal muscle AMPK stimulates glucose uptake and fatty acid oxidation, whereas in liver it inhibits fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis. The Rab GTPase activating proteins Akt substrate of 160 kDa (AS 160) and tre- 2 /USP 6, BUB 2, cdc 16 domain family member 1 (TBC 1 C 1) {{have been identified as}} potential targets of both protein kinase B (PKB, also known as Akt) and AMPK which mediate glucose transporter 4 (GLUT 4) translocation to the plasma membrane in response to insulin and 5 -aminoimidazole- 4 -carboxamide riboside (AICAR) respectively in muscle. Previous work in our laboratory has demonstrated that AICAR modestly stimulates basal glucose transport, yet inhibits insulin-stimulated glucose transport in 3 T 3 -L 1 adipocytes, which is in contrast to the effect of AICAR in skeletal muscle. Currently the role of AMPK in adipocytes remains poorly characterised despite the importance of fat tissue in energy homeostasis. To address this, the molecular mechanism of AMPK activation by known stimuli, the acute effect of various AMPK activators on glucose transport, the effect of AMPK inhibition and knockdown on AICAR mediated inhibition of insulin-stimulated glucose transport and the effect of acute AICAR treatment on PKB substrate phosphorylation in 3 T 3 -L 1 adipocytes was investigated. In addition the effect of sustained AMPK activation on glucose transport and insulin signaling in 3 T 3 -L 1 adipocytes, and the effect of sustained AMPK activation on insulin signaling in human adipose tissue was also investigated. The AMPK activators; sorbitol, metformin, rosiglitazone, arsenite, <b>azide,</b> <b>hydrogen</b> peroxide and isoproterenol were all shown to stimulate AMPK activity {{in the presence of the}} Ca 2 +/Calmodulin dependent protein kinase kinase (CaMKK) inhibitor STO- 609, suggesting that these activators activate AMPK via a CaMKK-independent pathway in 3 T 3 -L 1 adipocytes. However, A 23187 -stimulated AMPK activity was abrogated in the presence of STO- 609. Isoproterenol, sodium azide and rosiglitazone, were all shown to cause an increase in the ADP/ATP ratio in 3 T 3 -L 1 adipocytes compared to control as assessed by high performance liquid chromatography, suggesting that they stimulate AMPK activity in an LKB 1 -dependent manner. These results suggest a possible role for CaMKK as an upstream AMPK kinase in 3 T 3 -L 1 adipocytes, in addition to LKB 1. There may also exist other upstream AMPK kinases in 3 T 3 -L 1 adipocytes that are both nucleotide and calcium independent since sorbitol, metformin, arsenite, hydrogen peroxide and leptin were found to activate AMPK independently of CaMKK and also showed no significant effect on adenine nucleotide ratios. Sorbitol, rosiglitazone, AICAR, isoproterenol and A 769662 all significantly inhibited insulin-stimulated glucose transport. Furthermore, in the presence of the AMPK inhibitor, Compound C, the inhibitory effect of AICAR on insulin-stimulated glucose transport was no longer apparent. However, AICAR still displayed a tendency to inhibit insulin-stimulated glucose transport in 3 T 3 -L 1 adipocytes infected with adenoviruses expressing a dominant negative AMPK mutant. The effect of AICAR on basal and insulin-stimulated AS 160 /TBC 1 D 1 phosphorylation at phospho-Akt substrate (PAS) sites, was assessed. AICAR did not alter AS 160 /TBC 1 D 1 phosphorylation compared to basal levels, nor perturb insulin-stimulated AS 160 /TBC 1 D 1 phosphorylation at PAS sites. In addition, AICAR did not appear to alter the phosphorylation of any other proteins at PAS sites. Prolonged AMPK activation by AICAR in 3 T 3 -L 1 adipocytes also significantly inhibited insulin-stimulated glucose transport and was not associated with altered PKB protein expression or insulin-stimulated PKB Ser 473 phosphorylation. In addition, chronic AMPK activation by metformin in adipose tissue of type 2 diabetic subjects was not associated with altered expression of three key insulin signalling molecules; PKB, the phosphoinositide 3 -kinase (PI 3 K) p 85 subunit and insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS- 1). Overall these results suggest a prominent role for LKB 1 as an AMPK kinase and a potential role for CaMKK as an AMPK kinase in adipocytes. This study also suggests that both acute and prolonged AMPK activation in adipocytes inhibits insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, however the precise mechanism of inhibition has yet to be elucidated. ...|$|R

Vibrational spectra of nitrous oxide (N 2 O), an isoelectronic analogue of HN 3, have also been recorded in the 500 - 15200 cm- 1 spectral region. At high vibrational energy (above thresholds of approximately 12600 and 18500 cm- 1), HN 3 exhibits vibrational and/or electronic predissociation to form two sets of products (N 2 + NH(X 3 Σ), NH*(a 1 Δ)) that evolve from the reactant on multiple potential energy surfaces. Spectral line broadening measurements on highly vibrationally excited states of hydrazoic acid have been performed to determine intramolecular lifetimes for vibrational predissociation and other intramolecular rate processes. Thousands of rovibronic transitions have been analyzed to yield accurate spectroscopic (rotational, vibrational) constants of NH stretch vibrational overtone states (up to 7 ν NH) and of combination states involving NH stretch overtone excitations plus one or more quanta of other vibrational modes. Absolute and/or relative absorption intensities have been measured for many vibrational bands. Extensive high resolution linewidth measurements on individual rovibronic transitions as well as spectral simulations of the linewidths of strongly overlapping transitions have been completed {{in order to determine}} lifetime broadening rates and mechanisms as a function of rovibronic excitation energy and state both below and above characteristic predissociation thresholds.
