40|$|The {{complexity}} of high-dimensional data creates {{a number of}} concerns when trying to analyze it. This data often consists of a response or survival time and potentially thousands of predictors. These predictors can be highly correlated, and the sample size is often very small and right censored. Sliced inverse regression (SIR) is a method of reducing the dimension of the data, while preserving all the regression information. Sliced inverse regression with regularizations was developed to work {{when the number of}} predictors exceeds the sample size, and to deal with highly correlated predictors as well. In this study we investigated the performance of Sliced inverse regression with regularizations using three different approaches for <b>handling</b> <b>right</b> censored data. The methods of reweighting, mean imputation, and multiple imputation were analyzed. Based on the simulation scenarios, the mean imputation method performs the best in regards to fitting the data as well as prediction. The method of reweighting appears inadequate when combined with SIR...|$|E

This study aims to determine issues, opportunities and strengths in managing regulation of seed germination in West Sulawesi.

40|$|There {{exists a}} need to {{estimate}} the potential financial, epidemiological and societal impact that diseases, and the treatment thereof, can have on society. Markov processes are often used to model diseases to estimate these quantities of interest and have an advantage over standard survival analysis techniques in that multiple events can be studied simultaneously. The theory of Markov processes is well established for processes for which the process parameters are known {{but not as much}} of the literature has focussed on the estimation of these transition parameters. This dissertation investigates and implements maximum likelihood estimators for Markov processes based on longitudinal data. The methods are described based on processes that are observed such that all transitions are recorded exactly, processes of which the state of the process is recorded at equidistant time points, at irregular time points and processes for which each process is observed at a possibly different irregular time point. Methods for <b>handling</b> <b>right</b> censoring and estimating the effect of covariates on parameters are described. The estimation methods are implemented by simulating Markov processes and estimating the parameters based on the simulated data so that the accuracy of the estimators can be investigated. We show that the estimators can provide accurate estimates of state prevalence if the process is stationary, even with relatively small sample sizes. Furthermore, we indicate that the estimators lack good accuracy in estimating the effect of covariates on parameters unless state transitions are recorded exactly. The methods are discussed with reference to the msm package for R which is freely available and a popular tool for estimating and implementing Markov processes in disease modelling. Methods are mentioned for the treatment of aggregate data, diseases where the state of patients are not known with complete certainty at every observation and diseases where patient interaction plays a role.
