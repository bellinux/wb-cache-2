40|$|This {{research}} was a qualitative research. Multiple methods {{were used in}} this research. They were observation, interview, transcription, and documentary. After getting the data, there were some influences in segmental and suprasemental features. At the segmental features, it influenced some consonant and vowel sounds. Those consonant sounds were [v] and [f] sound became [p] sound,[th] sound became [t] sound,[z] sound became [s] sound,[ch] sound became [c] sound, and [ǰ] became [ng]. Meanwhile, at the vowel sounds influenced monophtongs and <b>diphtongs.</b> At monophtongs, they were[é] sound became [ə] sound, [ə] sound became [é] sound, and [ɪ] sound became [e] sound. Meanwhile at the <b>diphtongs,</b> it was [ei] sound became [e] sound. At the suprasegmental features, there were some influences on the words 2 ̆ 7 stress and intonation. Some words and sentences were given inappropriate stress and intonation. Those things happened for some reasons. They were the intensity time in using English, the difference in phonological system between English and Lampungnese language, the sociolinguistic factor, the learner 2 ̆ 7 s age, and the learner 2 ̆ 7 s attitude and personality...|$|E
40|$|Characteristics of the wovels in German {{language}} {{compares to}} those in the Czech language Annotation in the english language My thesis explores characteristics of the vowels in German language and compares them {{to those in}} the Czech language. The thesis is devided into the following parts: introduction, theoretical part, practical part and the ending. Introduction summarizes the reasons that made me choose this particular topic, it presents the literature and my opinion on why phonetics is such an important part of communication, my expectations and the description of my work. Theoretical part consists of several chapters: a) characteristics of german vowels, how they are devided according to the basic classification (the position of the tongue, quality, quantity, labialization) and according to other clasiffications (stress/reduction, participation of the nasal cavity and the description of the individual vowels and <b>diphtongs)</b> b) characteristics of czech vowels, how they are devided according to the basic classification (the position of the tongue, quality, quantity, labialization) and according to other clasiffications (stress/reduction, participation of the nasal cavity and the description of the individual vowels and <b>diphtongs)</b> c) most common problems with pronunciation for non-native speakers which are [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The {{speech of}} Bosiljevo has {{characteristics}} of cakavian and kajkavian dialect. Phonological system is characterized by: ikavian - ekavian reflex of the yat; {{the presence of}} <b>diphtongs</b> and semi-diphtongs (ie, ug). Two-accent system of falling intonation (long-falling and short-falling); instability of accent shifting. Morphological system is characterized by: diversity of endings in noun declension (G LI plural); absence of aorist, the imperfect tense and past participle. Infinitive has shorter and longer form; comparation of adjectives requires a variety of accent shifting; personal pronouns have special forms for the third person singular and the third person plural. Particularity of sound changes is visible in compound adverbs and prepositions...|$|E
40|$|Dutch {{is one of}} the {{languages}} borrowed in bahasa Indonesia. The language contact during the Dutch colonialism is the reason why some Dutch words were borrowed in bahasa Indonesia. The words are used in many different fields such as government, law, culinary and daily life. The purpose of this research is to describe the sound changes and the changes of the meaning of the borrowed words from Dutch to bahasa Indonesia. The words used in this research are from Kamus Besar Bahasa Indonesia 4 th edition. After doing some observations, the researcher used 328 words derived from Dutch. The researcher analysed the words using distinctive features for the sound changes and the components of meaning for the meaning changes. The result shows that there are 12 sound changes (vocal, consonant and <b>diphtong)</b> and five groups of meaning changes. ...|$|R
40|$|The normal {{pronunciation}} of diphthong lies {{in putting}} the prominence or length to the nucleus vowel and gliding {{to the second}} one. However, this is not as the mostly phenomena of Javanese Learners of English (JLE) ’s way of pronouncing diphthong. JLE tends to make shifts in pronouncing the quality of diphthong, {{one of which is}} a gliding decrease or omission. The data are collected by techniques of recording and demonstration. The data analysis uses techniques of comparing and contrasting be- tween JLE’s pronunciation and Received Pronunciation (RP). To amount of frequency in comparing JLE’s and RP, the percentage of the highest occurrence can be indi- cated. The result shows that JLE’s pronunciation of <b>diphtong</b> tends to reduce the fortis of nucleus before gliding or there is no gliding in the second vowel.   Key words: sound shift, JLE, SPE, gliding, fortis, and pronunciation quality...|$|R
40|$|In {{the article}} there are 222 place names of Sokolka {{district}} registered in dialectal variants. The material {{used for the}} study constituted survey manuscripts made for The Dictionary Of North- Eastern Poland Place Names, which were collected {{by a team of}} philologists, leaded by Professor Antonina Obrebska-Jablonska, arranged by the Commission of Determining the Place and Object Names at the Office of the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Poland in 1961 – 1970. Dialectal forms of oyconyms analysis was carried out on three levels: structural, phonetic and formative. The study shows that the dialectical variants of place names of the Sokolka district, registered in source materials, were used by the inhabitants of the test area, in spoken variants maintaining phonetic and morphological characteristics typical for the dialect of the test area. Particular impact on dialect variants of names had Belarusian language and its dialects. These influences were primarily observed at the level of phonetics: variable accent, vowel reduction, a <b>diphtong</b> like pronunciation of certain vowels et al. However, at the formative level, the big influence on the construction of oyconyms models had also other East Slavic languages. Wydane z udziałem środków dziekana Wydziału Filologicznego U...|$|R
40|$|Osthoff's Law {{which has}} been {{formulated}} by Hermann Osthoff as a rule explaining the alternation of the long and short vowels (<b>diphtongs)</b> in some Ancient Greek pardigmata {{in a better way}} than the assumption of an old ablaut does is investigated in the present study by considering the possibilities of econstruction and the alternatives of historical development of the paradigmata in which is the Osthoffian vowel shortening usually supposed. r * The results are e. g. that Greek nouns in - have used the generalized full grade suffix [...] in original inflection, that the desinence of the accusative plural of -stems -ans can be derived immediately from the Indo-European *-ah 2 ns and that the desinence of Indo-European thematic instrumental plural was *-oh 1 is. The general conclusion reached {{is that there is no}} need to postulate the former operation of Osthoff's Law in any of the considered morphological issues. The Law, in consequence, is loosing his utility at least in the field of Greek historical morphology...|$|E
