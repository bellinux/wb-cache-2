5|$|Elemental bromine is very {{reactive}} {{and thus}} {{does not occur}} free in nature, but in colourless soluble crystalline mineral halide salts, analogous to table salt. While it is rather rare in the Earth's crust, the high solubility of the bromide ion (Br−) has caused its accumulation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>oceans.</b> Commercially the element is easily extracted from brine pools, mostly in the United States, Israel and China. The mass of bromine <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>oceans</b> is about one three-hundredth of that of chlorine.|$|E

50|$|Following Kesey's {{death in}} 2001, McClanahan edited Spit <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ocean</b> # 7: All About Kesey, a {{collection}} of stories, poems and essays about Kesey. Spit <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ocean</b> # 7 was the last volume of a literary magazine Kesey himself conceived in 1973 and thereafter sporadically self-published. Each Spit <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ocean</b> volume featured a different theme and editor; the last Kesey-published edition, Spit <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ocean</b> # 6, had been released over 20 years before, in 1981.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> major upwellings <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ocean</b> are {{associated}} with the divergence of currents that bring deeper, colder, nutrient rich waters to the surface. There are at least five types of upwelling: coastal upwelling, large-scale wind-driven upwelling <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ocean</b> interior, upwelling associated with eddies, topographically-associated upwelling, and broad-diffusive upwelling <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ocean</b> interior.|$|R
50|$|Sonic {{characteristics}} of marine species - Noise <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ocean</b> {{is of utmost}} importance for ocean explorations, oceanographic as well as fisheries studies, sonar operations, etc. The wide range of systems for <b>ocean</b> research demands <b>the</b> need for characterizing <b>the</b> noise sources <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ocean.</b> <b>The</b> ambient noise <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ocean</b> is composite <b>in</b> nature, with components emanating {{from a variety of}} noise sources. The problem of identification of noise sources <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ocean</b> is of prime importance because of its diverse practical applications. <b>In</b> view of <b>the</b> importance of the area of identification of noise sources, there is a need and requirement for characterizing <b>the</b> noise sources <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ocean</b> which are of both man made and biological in origin.|$|R
5|$|Their {{effects are}} far-reaching; by {{increasing}} the amount of respiration <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>oceans,</b> viruses are indirectly responsible for reducing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere by approximately 3 gigatonnes of carbon per year.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{estimated}} that the solid earth as a whole contains 730 ppm of carbon, with 2000 ppm in the core and 120 ppm in the combined mantle and crust. Since the mass of the earth is , this would imply 4360 million gigatonnes of carbon. This is much more than the amount of carbon <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>oceans</b> or atmosphere (below).|$|E
5|$|It is {{estimated}} that there are about 1031 viruses on Earth. Most of them are bacteriophages, and most are <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>oceans.</b> Microorganisms constitute more than 90 per cent of the biomass in the sea, {{and it has been}} estimated that viruses kill approximately 20 per cent of this biomass each day and that there are fifteen times as many viruses <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>oceans</b> as there are bacteria and archaea. Viruses are the main agents responsible for the rapid destruction of harmful algal blooms, which often kill other marine life, and help maintain the ecological balance of different species of marine blue-green algae, and thus adequate oxygen production for life on Earth.|$|E
50|$|Oceanic {{heat content}} (OHC) refers to <b>the</b> heat stored <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ocean.</b> <b>The</b> changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ocean</b> heat play an {{important}} role in sea level rise, because of thermal expansion. Ocean warming accounts for 90% of the energy accumulation from global warming between 1971 and 2010.|$|R
50|$|The term {{false bottom}} can also {{refer to the}} deep {{scattering}} layer <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ocean,</b> a phenomenon where a layer of marine organisms deep <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ocean</b> can be mistaken by sonar for the seabed.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the lesson}} is to enable {{children}} to recognise {{that there is a}} great diversity of animals <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ocean.</b> <b>The</b> children will become familiar with the characteristics of a variety of marine animals from different regions and <b>ocean</b> environments around <b>the</b> world. They will also learn about marine pollution affecting the animals that live <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ocean.</b> Note: This lesson plan can be used with the drama lesson plan: A Whale’s Tale – Adventures of living <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ocean...</b>|$|R
5|$|Microorganisms {{constitute}} {{more than}} 90% of the biomass in the sea. It {{is estimated that}} viruses kill approximately 20% of this biomass each day {{and that there are}} 10 to 15 times as many viruses <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>oceans</b> as there are bacteria and archaea. Viruses are also major agents responsible for the rapid destruction of harmful algal blooms, which often kill other marine life.|$|E
5|$|Researchers {{recently}} discovered archaeal involvement in ammonia oxidation reactions. These reactions {{are particularly important}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>oceans.</b> The archaea also appear crucial for ammonia oxidation in soils. They produce nitrite, which other microbes then oxidize to nitrate. Plants and other organisms consume the latter.|$|E
5|$|Archaea {{exist in}} {{a broad range of}} habitats, and as a major part of global ecosystems, may {{represent}} about 20% of microbial cells <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>oceans.</b> The first-discovered archaeans were extremophiles. Indeed, some archaea survive high temperatures, often above , as found in geysers, black smokers, and oil wells. Other common habitats include very cold habitats and highly saline, acidic, or alkaline water. However, archaea include mesophiles that grow in mild conditions, in swamps and marshland, sewage, the oceans, the intestinal tract of animals, and soils.|$|E
40|$|The {{focus of}} this review article is on the {{anthropogenic}} CO 2 taken up by <b>the</b> <b>ocean.</b> There are several methods of identifying the anthropogenic CO 2 signal and quantifying its inventory <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ocean.</b> <b>The</b> ?C* method is most frequently used to estimate the global distribution of anthropogenic CO 2 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ocean.</b> Results based on analysis of the dataset obtained from the comprehensive surveys of inorganic carbon distribution <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world <b>oceans</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1990 s are given. These surveys were jointly conducted during <b>the</b> World <b>Ocean</b> Circulation Experiment (WOCE) and <b>the</b> Joint Global <b>Ocean</b> Flux Study (JGOFS). This data set consists of 9618 hydrographic stations from a total of 95 cruises, which represents the most accurate and comprehensive view {{of the distribution of}} inorganic carbon <b>in</b> <b>the</b> global <b>ocean</b> available today. <b>The</b> increase of anthropogenic CO 2 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ocean</b> during <b>the</b> past few decades is also evaluated using direct comparison of results from repeat surveys and using statistical method of Multi-parameter Linear Regression (MLR). The impact of increasing oceanic anthropogenic CO 2 on the calcium carbonate system <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ocean</b> is reviewed briefly as well. Extensive studies of CaCO 3 dissolution as a result of increasing anthropogenic CO 2 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ocean</b> have revealed several distinct oceanic regions where the CaCO 3 undersaturation zone has expanded...|$|R

5|$|Bromine is {{significantly}} less {{abundant in the}} crust than fluorine or chlorine, comprising only 2.5parts per million of the Earth's crustal rocks, and then only as bromide salts. It is the forty-sixth most abundant element in Earth's crust. It {{is significantly}} more abundant <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>oceans,</b> resulting from long-term leaching. There, it makes up 65parts per million, corresponding to a ratio of about one bromine atom for every 660 chlorine atoms. Salt lakes and brine wells may have higher bromine concentrations: for example, the Dead Sea contains 0.4% bromide ions. It is from these sources that bromine extraction is mostly economically feasible.|$|E
5|$|Free {{oxygen gas}} was almost nonexistent in Earth's {{atmosphere}} before photosynthetic archaea and bacteria evolved, probably about 3.5 billion years ago. Free oxygen {{first appeared in}} significant quantities during the Paleoproterozoic eon (between 3.0 and 2.3 billion years ago). For the first billion years, any free oxygen produced by these organisms combined with dissolved iron <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>oceans</b> to form banded iron formations. When such oxygen sinks became saturated, free oxygen began to outgas from the oceans 3–2.7billion years ago, reaching 10% of its present level around 1.7billion years ago.|$|E
5|$|In 1978, Riefenstahl {{published}} a book of her sub-aquatic photographs called Korallengärten ("Coral Gardens"), followed by the 1990 book Wunder unter Wasser ("Wonder under Water"). In her 90s, Riefenstahl was still photographing marine life and gained {{the distinction of being}} one of the world's oldest scuba divers. On 22 August 2002, her 100th birthday, she released the film Impressionen unter Wasser ("Underwater Impressions"), an idealized documentary of life <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>oceans</b> and her first film in over 25 years. Riefenstahl was a member of Greenpeace for eight years.|$|E

5|$|The {{effects of}} climate change on teleosts could be {{powerful}} but are complex. For example, increased winter precipitation (rain and snow) could harm populations of freshwater fish in Norway, whereas warmer summers could increase growth of adult fish. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>oceans,</b> teleosts may be able to cope with warming, as it is simply an extension of natural variation in climate. It is uncertain how ocean acidification, caused by rising carbon dioxide levels, might affect teleosts.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} life {{was that of the}} {{unicellular}} eukaryotes, prokaryotes and archaea until about 610 million years ago when multicellular organisms began to appear <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>oceans</b> in the Ediacaran period. The evolution of multicellularity occurred in multiple independent events, in organisms as diverse as sponges, brown algae, cyanobacteria, slime moulds and myxobacteria. In January 2016, scientists reported that, about 800 million years ago, a minor genetic change in a single molecule called GK-PID may have allowed organisms to go from a single cell organism to one of many cells.|$|E
5|$|The {{military}} and geologists employ strong sonar and produce an increases in noise <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>oceans.</b> Marine mammals that {{make use of}} biosonar for orientation and communication are not only hindered by the extra noise, but may race to the surface in panic. This {{may lead to a}} bubbling out of blood gases, and the animal then dies because the blood vessels become blocked, so-called decompression sickness. This effect, of course, only occurs in porpoises that dive to great depths, such as Dall's porpoise.|$|E

5|$|Archaea were {{initially}} viewed as extremophiles living in harsh environments, such as hot springs and salt lakes, {{but they have}} since been found in {{a broad range of}} habitats, including soils, oceans, and marshlands. They are also part of the human microbiota, found in the colon, oral cavity, and skin. Archaea are particularly numerous <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>oceans,</b> and the archaea in plankton {{may be one of the}} most abundant groups of organisms on the planet. Archaea are a major part of Earth's life and may play roles in both the carbon cycle and the nitrogen cycle. No clear examples of archaeal pathogens or parasites are known, but they are often mutualists or commensals. One example is the methanogens that inhabit human and ruminant guts, where their vast numbers aid digestion. Methanogens are also used in biogas production and sewage treatment, and biotechnology exploits enzymes from extremophile archaea that can endure high temperatures and organic solvents.|$|E
5|$|As {{temperatures}} {{continue to}} rise, the last animal {{life will be}} driven back toward the poles, and possibly underground. They would become primarily active during the polar night, aestivating during the polar day due to the intense heat. Much of the surface would become a barren desert and life would primarily be found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>oceans.</b> However, due to a decrease of the amount or organic matter coming to the oceans from the land as well as oxygen in the water, life would disappear there too following a similar path to that on Earth's surface. This process would start {{with the loss of}} freshwater species and conclude with invertebrates, particularly those that do not depend on living plants such as termites or those near hydrothermal vents such as worms of the genus Riftia. As a result of these processes, multi-cellular lifeforms may be extinct in about 800 million years, and eukaryotes in 1.3 billion years, leaving only the prokaryotes.|$|E
5|$|Bacteriophages are {{a common}} and diverse group of viruses and are the most {{abundant}} form of biological entity in aquatic environments– there are up to ten times more of these viruses <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>oceans</b> than there are bacteria, reaching levels of 250,000,000 bacteriophages per millilitre of seawater. These viruses infect specific bacteria by binding to surface receptor molecules and then entering the cell. Within {{a short amount of}} time, in some cases just minutes, bacterial polymerase starts translating viral mRNA into protein. These proteins go on to become either new virions within the cell, helper proteins, which help assembly of new virions, or proteins involved in cell lysis. Viral enzymes aid in the breakdown of the cell membrane, and, {{in the case of the}} T4 phage, in just over twenty minutes after injection over three hundred phages could be released.|$|E
