2500|$|The young Slattery {{spent much}} of her {{childhood}} watching television and old Hollywood movies, from which she learned to impersonate her favorite actresses, such as Joan Bennett and Kim Novak. In 1961 she signed up for a course at the DeVern School of Cosmetology in Baldwin, on Long Island. She said that she [...] "learned about the mysteries of sex from a salesman in a local children's shoe store" [...] and finally revealed an inclination towards cross-dressing when her mother confronted her about local rumors, which described her as [...] "dressing as a girl" [...] and frequenting a local gay bar called The Hayloft. In response, Slattery left the room and reappeared in full feminine attire. Her mother later said that, [...] "I <b>knew</b> <b>then...</b> <b>that</b> I couldn't stop Jimmy. Candy was just too beautiful and talented." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Gardner's later account, {{one night}} in September 1939 they {{took him to a}} large house owned by [...] "Old Dorothy" [...] Clutterbuck, a wealthy local woman, where he was made to strip naked and taken through an {{initiation}} ceremony. Halfway through the ceremony, he heard the word [...] "Wica", and he recognised it as an Old English word for [...] "witch". He was already acquainted with Margaret Murray's theory of the Witch-cult, and that [...] "I then <b>knew</b> <b>then</b> <b>that</b> which I had thought burnt out hundreds of years ago still survived." [...] This group, he claimed, were the New Forest coven, and he believed them {{to be one of the}} few surviving covens of the ancient, pre-Christian Witch-Cult religion. Subsequent research by the likes of Hutton and Heselton has shown that in fact the New Forest coven was probably only formed in the mid-1930s, based upon such sources as folk magic and the theories of Margaret Murray.|$|E
2500|$|In {{his book}} This Just In: What I Couldn't Tell You on TV, CBS News {{correspondent}} Bob Schieffer, who was {{serving as a}} reporter for the Fort Worth Star-Telegram when Cronkite's editorial aired, acknowledged that Johnson did not see the original broadcast but also defended the allegation that Johnson had made the remark. According to Schieffer, Johnson's aide George Christian [...] "told me that the President apparently saw some clips of it the next day" [...] and that [...] "That's when he made the remark about Cronkite. But he <b>knew</b> <b>then</b> <b>that</b> it would take more than Americans were willing to give it." [...] When asked about the remark during a 1979 interview, Christian claimed he had no recollection about what the President had said. In his 1996 memoir A Reporter's Life, Cronkite claimed he was at first unsure about how much of an impact his editorial report had on Johnson's decision to drop his bid for re-election, and what eventually convinced him that the President had made the statement was Bill Moyers, fellow journalist and former aide to Johnson, telling him [...] "The president flipped off the set and said 'If I've lost Cronkite, I've lost Middle America.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|On October 10, 1943, O'Hare flew with VF-6 {{again in}} the air strikes against Wake Island. On this mission Lt.(jg) Alex Vraciu, the future ace, was his wingman - both Butch and Vraciu scored that day. When they came across an enemy {{formation}} Butch took the outside airplane and Vraciu took the inside plane. Butch went below the clouds to get a Japanese Mitsubishi Zero and Vraciu lost him, so Vraciu {{kept an eye on}} a second Zero that went to Wake Island and landed. Vraciu strafed the Zero on the ground, then saw a Betty bomber and shot it down. Upon returning to the carrier, O'Hare asked Vraciu where he went and Vraciu <b>knew</b> <b>then</b> <b>that</b> he should have definitely stayed with his leader. Alex Vraciu later told after the war, [...] "O'Hare taught many of the squadron members little things that would later save their lives. One example was to swivel your neck before starting a strafing run to make sure enemy fighters were not on your tail." [...] Vraciu also learned from O'Hare the [...] "highside pass" [...] used for attacking the Japanese Mitsubishi G4M Betty bombers. The highside technique was used to avoid the lethal 20-mm fire of the Betty's tail gunner. The Wake Island raid would be the last occasion Butch would lead VF-6 in battle. According to orders dated September 17, 1943, October found Butch O'Hare as Commander Air Group (CAG) commanding Air Group Six, embarked on the famous [...] Functioning as CAG, O'Hare was given command of the entire Enterprise air group: Grumman F6F Hellcat fighters, Douglas SBD Dauntless dive bombers, Grumman TBF Avenger torpedo bombers and 100 pilots.|$|E
2500|$|Late in {{the first}} day, when [...] was {{finishing}} his first journey across the sky, one of the hermaphrodite twins, , stopped breathing. [...] Afraid, the people left her alone. [...] In the morning, the Coyote named First Angry and the people went to find the twin, but [...] was gone. [...] One man looked down the reed into the Third World, and there he saw [...] sitting {{by the side of}} the river combing her hair. [...] He called to his friend, and he looked and also saw her. [...] The people asked Coyote what to do. [...] He took a black rock, , and threw it into , the Black Water Lake. [...] He said that if the rock came up and floated, the spirit of the dead person would return to the Fourth World and there would be no death. [...] If the rock sank, the spirit would stay in the world below and there would be death. The rock sank, and the people <b>knew</b> <b>then</b> <b>that</b> the twin was dead, and First Man remembered the agreement they had made with the sun. [...] Four days later the two witnesses who had looked down on the dead twin also died. [...] The people learned that it is dangerous to look at the dead. The people were all mad at Coyote for this and gathered around to beat him. Coyote said they could beat him, but first he had something to say. [...] "I threw the rock in the water knowing that it would sink." [...] The people darkly muttered about this to one another, the whole of them deciding that Coyote really did deserve a good beating. But quick thinking Coyote finished his explanation. [...] "Without death the world would soon be overpopulated. The elders would never die and would stay stuck in their infirm bodies. There would be no room for new children. We would run out of food and shelter with so many people to feed and care for." [...] The gathered group was silent for a bit while all of them contemplated Coyote's rationale and found him to be wise and intelligent.|$|E
