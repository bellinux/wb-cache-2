40|$|In {{this paper}} we report a simple {{design of a}} micro-optical shutter/attenuator. The {{standard}} MUMPS process was used to fabricate the device. A vertically erected, gold-coated, 200 x 300 mum side length micro-mirror was precisely placed between the end faces of two closely spaced optical fibers. The position of the micro-mirror {{with respect to the}} optical fiber end face was controlled by a nano-stepping motor array. Optical and mechanical tests were performed on the device. A 1. 55 mum laser beam was sent along the optical fiber. When the micro-mirror was removed {{from the front of the}} fiber, the coupling efficiency between two fibers was - 10 dBm. Once the micro-mirror was placed in the optical path the coupling efficiency dropped to - 51. 5 dBm.
