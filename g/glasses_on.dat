25|$|From the 18th century, English {{lead glass}} became popular {{throughout}} Europe, and was {{ideally suited to}} the new taste for wheel-cut glass decoration perfected on the Continent owing to its relatively soft properties. In Holland, local engraving masters such as David Wolff and Frans Greenwood stippled imported English glassware, a style that remained popular through the eighteenth century. Such was its popularity in Holland that the first Continental production of lead-crystal glass began there, probably {{as the result of}} imported English workers. Imitating lead-crystal à la façon d’Angleterre presented technical difficulties, as the best results were obtained with covered pots in a coal-fired furnace, a particularly English process requiring specialised cone-furnaces. Towards {{the end of the eighteenth}} century, lead-crystal glass was being produced in France, Hungary, Germany, and Norway. By 1800, Irish lead crystal had overtaken lime-potash <b>glasses</b> <b>on</b> the Continent, and traditional glassmaking centres in Bohemia began to focus on colored glasses rather than compete directly against it.|$|E
25|$|Van Barneveld {{decided not}} to wear his glasses {{in the first round}} of the 2015 World Championship and took out {{finishes}} of 167 and 170 in beating Rowby-John Rodriguez 3–0. He was then involved in three successive matches in which there was never a set between Van Barneveld and his opponent as he edged past Jamie Caven 4–3, Adrian Lewis 4–3 (Lewis missed one match dart) and Stephen Bunting 5–4. In the Bunting match he returned from a break after the fourth set with his <b>glasses</b> <b>on</b> explaining afterwards that the board was looking blurry. Van Barneveld looked to have got himself back into his semi-final meeting with Phil Taylor when he recovered from 2–0 down to draw level, but his lengthy previous matches seemed to take effect as he could not win another set to be defeated 6–2. At the Masters he knocked out newly crowned world champion Gary Anderson 11–6 in the semi-finals, but was beaten by a reversal of this scoreline against Michael van Gerwen in the final.|$|E

The housemates failed every part of the Tudor-themed shopping task and received only a basic budget. During the task, Siavash, playing King Henry VIII, was called upon to ban one housemate from nominating and to grant another immunity. He chose Charlie and Marcus respectively. On Day 21, the housemates nominated against the clock in a live programme, resulting in Angel and Halfwit facing the public vote.|$|E
500|$|To obtain certain {{snow and}} ice sound effects, sound {{designer}} Odin Benitez traveled to Mammoth Mountain, California, to record them at a frozen lake.

The foley artists received daily deliveries of 50 pounds (22.6kg) of snow ice while working, to help them record all the necessary {{snow and ice}} sounds for the film. Because the film's visuals were finalized so late, five separate versions of nearly every footstep on snow were recorded (corresponding to five different types of snow), then one was later selected during mixing to match the snow as rendered in {{the final version of}} each scene.

500|$|George Boldt (1851–1916), the {{founding}} proprietor, was a Prussian-born American hotelier and self-made millionaire who influenced {{the development of}} the urban hotel as a civic social center and luxury destination. His motto was [...] "the guest is always right", and he became a wealthy and prominent figure internationally. The hotel was built to his specifications. He served as president and director of the Waldorf Astoria Hotel Company, as well as the Waldorf–Astoria Segar Company and the Waldorf Importation Company. He also owned and operated the Bellevue-Stratford Hotel, an elite boutique hotel on Broad Street in Philadelphia, with his wife, Louise. Boldt was described as [...] "Mild mannered, undignified, unassuming", resembling [...] "a typical German professor with his close-cropped beard which he kept fastidiously trimmed... and his pince-nez <b>glasses</b> <b>on</b> a black silk cord". Boldt retained his contacts with the European elite and he and his wife made frequent trips to Europe, bringing back with them many antiques, a characteristic of the Waldorf Astoria. Boldt continued to own the Bellevue even after his relationship with the Astors blossomed.|$|E
500|$|Another stunt {{scene was}} filmed for Episode 6; the charity ball scene was filmed {{over two days}} at a Masonic Lodge and {{concluded}} with a fight between Jenny and Natalie (played by Lorelei King). The shots of Jenny spraying Natalie with a fire extinguisher were limited to two takes because {{it took so long}} to re-apply King's make up. The table that Ripley and King's stunt doubles fall through had its legs weakened, and the <b>glasses</b> <b>on</b> the table were replaced with sugar glass. The Brief Encounter fantasy was filmed at a steam railway near Rochdale. Nigel Cole used the scene as an opportunity to make his mark as a television director. Most of the scene was filmed by Cole and the main crew. Establishing shots were filmed by Langan and the second unit, due to time constraints. The lighting and focus of the fantasy station was intended to be a direct contrast to the harsh modernity of Piccadilly, which appeared in the [...] "real life" [...] scenes.|$|E

500|$|The {{original}} hotel {{started as}} two hotels on Fifth Avenue built by feuding relatives. The first hotel, the 13-story, 450-room Waldorf Hotel, designed by Henry Janeway Hardenbergh in the German Renaissance style, was opened on March 13, 1893 {{at the corner}} of Fifth Avenue and 33rd Street, on the site where millionaire developer William Waldorf Astor had his mansion.

William Astor, motivated in part by a dispute with his aunt Caroline Webster Schermerhorn Astor, had built the Waldorf Hotel next door to her house, on the site of his father's mansion. The hotel was built to the specifications of founding proprietor George Boldt, who owned and operated the Bellevue-Stratford Hotel, a fashionable hotel on Broad Street in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, with his wife Louise.

[...] He added that when the suit was originally filed in 2011 the 3DS was not profitable. Nintendo appealed unsuccessfully.

2500|$|Mari Shimazaki {{designed}} the game's characters to be [...] "fashionable", with [...] "subdued" [...] features.

Bayonetta emerged as a long-haired, black-clothed witch with a beehive hairdo (in place of the traditional pointy hat) and glasses (which Kamiya [...] "really pushed for... to differentiate Bayonetta from other female characters {{and give her a}} sense of mystery and intelligence"). Conversely, Shimazaki [...] "didn't require a huge amount of effort" [...] to design Bayonetta's short-haired, red-clothed rival Jeanne, who merely wears her <b>glasses</b> <b>on</b> her head above her eyes. She added plumes to Jeanne's handguns to add movement to the design, and thick makeup to Jeanne's face to [...] "make [...] feel like something out of the 1960s".

2500|$|The video {{begins with}} a consecutive, quick {{close-up}} of each group member. Natalie Appleton, first, is seen with tied-back hair and black sunglasses turning around. Shaznay Lewis, second, is seen with loose hair removing her sunglasses. Nicole Appleton, third, is seen wearing a tilted black hat and a veil over her face. Melanie Blatt, last, is wearing a European-styled black cap with her hair curled to volume and is depicted throughout the video reading The Thief's Journal by Jean Genet. A scene is then focused around the atmosphere outside a bank as the girls begin to arrive, {{the name of the}} fictional bank is [...] "La Banca dei Fortunati" [...] (in Italian it means [...] "The Bank of the luckies"). The name of the fictional bank director is [...] "Benito Berlusconi" [...] The music video is set in black and white, with occasional streaks of yellow or red visible for dramatic emphasis. The scene then shifts to an ATM where money is seen ejecting. Shaznay and Nicole then walk into the bank in supermodel style with whips. Natalie comes through another entrance with her <b>glasses</b> <b>on</b> her head. With security all around, Natalie acts innocent by pretending to be doing her make-up while she waits for Nicole and Shaznay to act out the robbery. [...] Upon Nicole and Shaznay about to act out the robbery is a scene where blood is leaking in a white background. Shaznay and Nicole are then seen sitting down at a table making a deal with the bank managers. At this stage Natalie goes back outside and puts her [...] glasses back on. She stares at one of the security guards as blood starts dripping underneath her sunglasses from her eyes {{to the extent that the}} ground beneath her rapidly enlarges in a circle of blood before the screen flashes out in red. In another seen, Nicole removes her hat and now has loose hair, and begins crawling to escape the bank while Melanie is waiting outside reading. Natalie and Shaznay are now in the bank area where they make use of a whip to frighten the civilians. The civilians then put their hands in the air and begin moving together in an almost robotic dance routine. The group then makes their escape via a motorcycle and side car. Melanie had never driven a motorcycle before and W.I.Z. had to draft in an extra hiding behind a cap to take her place.|$|E
