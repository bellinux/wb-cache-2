The terms set by Lloyd's stipulated that <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> publicly worn for thirty days {{in any given}} year, that it be stored in a vault, and that Taylor was {{to be accompanied by}} armed guards when wearing it in public. Taylor would later have a replica made of the diamond that cost $2,800.|$|E
5|$|In 1977, British Airways and Singapore Airlines {{shared a}} Concorde for flights between London and Singapore International Airport at Paya Lebar via Bahrain. The aircraft, BA's Concorde G-BOAD, was painted in Singapore Airlines livery {{on the port}} side and British Airways livery on the {{starboard}} side. The service was discontinued after three return flights because of noise complaints from the Malaysian government; <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> reinstated on a new route bypassing Malaysian airspace in 1979. A dispute with India prevented Concorde from reaching supersonic speeds in Indian airspace, so the route was eventually declared not viable and discontinued in 1980.|$|E
5|$|Many German radio {{messages}} were encoded using the Enigma machine and other enciphering techniques and the codes were changed frequently. A team of code breakers stationed at Bletchley Park worked to break codes {{as quickly as}} possible to provide advance information on German plans and troop movements. British military intelligence code-named this information Ultra intelligence as <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> provided to the top level of commanders. The Enigma code used by Field Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt, Oberbefehlshaber West (Supreme Commander West; OB West), commander of the Western Front, was broken by the end of March. German intelligence changed the Enigma codes right after the Allied landings of 6 June but by 17 June the Allies were again consistently able to read them.|$|E

5|$|On Monday, April 4, U.S. Attorney Garret S. Cannon {{took over}} the {{prosecution}} and moved that Jackalow {{be transferred to the}} U.S. Marshall in the Essex County Jail. Voorhies again objected to jurisdiction, arguing that if the alleged murder was committed in the Long Island Sound <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> tried in New York. Vroom on the other hand held that a showing of probable cause had been made. Further, he argued that he had jurisdiction {{on the grounds that the}} murder was committed between the state of New York and the Norwalk Islands, and Jackalow's robbery had in any case continued until his arrival in Barnegat. Jackalow was remanded to Newark to await the decision of the grand jury.|$|E
5|$|The Seneca Nation availed {{itself of}} the act in {{bringing}} this action, which was subject to the provision, as held by the court of appeals, that <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> brought and maintained ‘in the same manner and within {{the same time as}} if brought by citizens of this state in relation to their private individual property and rights.’ Under the circumstances, the fact that the plaintiff was an Indian tribe cannot make federal questions of the correct construction {{of the act}} and the bar of the statute of limitations.|$|E
5|$|The {{second major}} {{milestone}} (after version 1.0) in Epiphany development was the 2.14 release. This {{was the first}} Epiphany release which followed GNOME's version numbering. It also featured network awareness using NetworkManager, smart bookmarks-related improvements {{and the possibility of}} being compiled against XULRunner. The latter was critical, as previously Epiphany could only use Firefox or Mozilla/SeaMonkey as a layout engine provider, so <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> installed alongside one of those browsers. The XULRunner support made it possible to install Epiphany as the sole web browser on the system.|$|E

5|$|After World War II, the US Navy {{sought to}} acquire a nuclear strike capability, and the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Air, Rear Admiral Arthur W. Radford wanted them to operate from {{aircraft}} carriers. There were practical problems with this. Nuclear weapons at that time were bulky and required a large aircraft to carry them. After Operation Crossroads, Radford asked Hayward if the Navy had such an aircraft, and Hayward suggested modifying the Lockheed P2V Neptune for carrier operations using jet-assisted takeoff (JATO) rocket boosters. It was an interim solution, as it a could not carry a Fat Man, but only the smaller Little Boy bomb; <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> operated by the large Midway class aircraft carriers, which still had to be modified for the task; and initially had no tailhook, so it was unable to land on a carrier, and a mission would have to end with it either landing at a land base or ditching at sea.|$|E
5|$|The {{woodwork}} {{removed by}} Street was sold for a nominal sum, with {{a condition that}} <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> used for a hall, chapel or library. Some pieces {{ended up in the}} library and chapel of Forest School in Walthamstow, east London (an institution that previously had no link to the college). Panels under the communion rail were also removed from the chapel, even though Street had reported to the college that these carvings were the only portion of the chapel woodwork with any real value, and had suggested at one point reusing them in connection with the ante-chapel screen and the adjoining seats. Some of the woodwork was transferred to St Edern's Church, Bodedern, in Anglesey, which had links with the college from 1648 until the Church in Wales was disestablished in 1920. Some of the panels may also have been re-used in the Fellows' Library (in the second quadrangle); other panelling at Bodedern came from the college, but not apparently from the chapel, and so may have been from a disused library gallery.|$|E
5|$|Under the new system, {{newly elected}} magistrates were awarded with {{automatic}} {{membership in the}} senate, although it remained difficult for a Plebeian from an unknown family to enter the senate. Several factors {{made it difficult for}} individuals from unknown families to be elected to high office, in particular the very presence of a long-standing nobility, as this appealed to the deeply rooted Roman respect for the past. Ultimately, a new Patricio-Plebeian aristocracy emerged, which replaced the old Patrician nobility. It was the dominance of the long-standing Patrician nobility which ultimately forced the Plebeians to wage their long struggle for political power. The new nobility, however, was fundamentally different from the old nobility. The old nobility existed through the force of law, because only Patricians were allowed to stand for high office, and it was ultimately overthrown after those laws were changed. Now, however, the new nobility existed due to the organization of society, and as such, <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> overthrown through a revolution.|$|E

25|$|Traditionally, Rabbis {{believed}} that the mysteries of Kabbalah were so complex and so easily misunderstood that <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> taught to devout students (mostly males) only after age 40. Therefore, some traditionalists had seen the Kabbalah Centre as a perversion of Judaism's ancient and secretive mystic tradition.|$|E

25|$|On November 1, 1943, the Marine amphibious {{landing at}} Cape Torokina, Bougainville, was {{strongly}} resisted by the sole piece of artillery {{available to the}} Japanese defenders, a well-camouflaged 75 millimeter regimental gun. Strategically placed and protected within a coconut log bunker, the gun had already destroyed four landing craft and damaged ten others, seriously threatening {{the success of the}} operation. No boats could approach the beach without passing within 150 yards or less from the muzzle. The emplacement was so situated that <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> attacked from the front and also in a position whereby rifle fire and grenades could not reach the gun crew.|$|E
25|$|In 1775, Daniel Boone blazed a {{trail for}} the Transylvania Company from Virginia through the Cumberland Gap into central Kentucky.

In some areas they had to face Indian attacks. In 1784 alone, Indians killed over 100 travelers on the Wilderness Road. No Indians lived permanently in Kentucky but they sent raiding parties to stop the newcomers. One of those intercepted was Abraham Lincoln's grandfather, who was scalped in 1784 near Louisville.|$|E
25|$|It {{was unclear}} how the People's Charter would be officially implemented.

Deposed Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase, who opposed the Charter, however, stated that a referendum would constitute legal validation.
