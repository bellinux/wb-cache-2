50|$|An organism's need {{to predict}} future events {{is central to}} modern {{theories}} of conditioning. Most theories use associations between stimuli {{to take care of}} these predictions. For example: In the R-W model, the associative strength of a CS tells us how strongly that CS predicts a US. A different approach to prediction is suggested by models such as that proposed by Gallistel & Gibbon (2000, 2002). Here the response is not determined by associative strengths. Instead, the organism records the times of onset and offset of CSs and USs and uses these to calculate the probability that the US will follow the CS. A number of experiments have shown that humans and animals can learn to time events (see Animal cognition), and the Gallistel & Gibbon model yields very good quantitative fits to a variety of experimental data. However, recent studies have suggested that <b>duration-based</b> models cannot account for some empirical findings as well as associative models.|$|E

30|$|Figure 3 {{shows the}} {{normalized}} transmitted bits of five association control algorithms: bandwidth-based association (Ba), <b>duration-based</b> association (Du), combined metric-based association (BaDu), local optimum association (LO), and offline optimal association (Optimal) algorithms. We observe that the <b>duration-based</b> association (Du) shows the worst performance {{compared to the}} other online algorithms. The main reason is that the <b>duration-based</b> algorithm connects to the APs with longer available link durations for less frequent re-association, without considering the effective bit rate. As a result, the <b>duration-based</b> algorithm suffers from low throughput once the users associate with an AP with low bandwidth. The bandwidth-based association is shown to achieve a relatively high bit rate compared to the <b>duration-based</b> association. However, we clearly observe that it experiences frequent handoffs, because the connection duration is not considered, and thus, it cannot achieve the best performance. The combined metric-based association control algorithm (BaDu), is shown to achieve the highest performance among the three online association control algorithms. This is mainly because it considers the link bandwidth as well as the available link duration and exploits their trade-off. However, we observe that it sometimes selects the AP that has low bit rates but with a very long connection duration, and suffers from low throughput. From Figure 4, we can see that these three algorithms achieve reasonable performance, but there is a large performance gap between them and the optimal association control. The bandwidth-based association (Ba), <b>duration-based</b> association (Du), and combined metric-based association (BaDu) achieve only 54 %, 68 %, and 81 % throughput compared to the local optimal association control (LO). We also observe that the association control algorithm can be further improved if it has access to future knowledge. Particularly, the offline optimal (Optimal) improves the performance of local optimal (LO) by up to 10 %.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{perception}} of <b>duration-based</b> syllabic rhythm was examined within a metrical framework. Par-ticipants assessed the duration patterns of four-syllable phrases set within the stress structure XxxX (an Aber-crombian trisyllabic foot). Using on-screen sliders, partic-ipants created percussive sequences that imitated speech rhythms and analogous non-speech monotone rhythms. There was {{a tendency to}} equalize the interval durations for speech stimuli but not for non-speech. Despite the percep-tual regularization of syllable durations, different speech phrases were conceived in various rhythmic configurations, pointing to a diversity of perceived meters in speech. In addition, imitations of speech stimuli showed more vari-ability than those of non-speech. Rhythmically skilled lis-teners exhibited lower variability and were more consistent with vowel-centric estimates when assessing speech stim-uli. These findings enable new connections between meter-and <b>duration-based</b> models of speech rhythm perception...|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to show that the <b>duration-based</b> hedge ratio has many serious defects: first, the {{yield-to-maturity}} is not the market interest rate, and it cannot even serve as a proxy for the market interest rate. Second, it is difficult to choose an appropriate bond for hedging among available bonds and to calculate duration. Third, duration can only be applied to small changes of interest rate. If there is a large change in interest rate, a <b>duration-based</b> hedge's performance may be worse than expected. The paper proposes an improving method to solve these problems. Design/methodology/approach – The proposed design is a model-driven enterprise system. Findings – The proposed system integrates the complex risk management into the enterprise architecture.

Howev-er, in {{a small proportion of}} cases, as with other assessments based on concurrent choice, the MSWO assessment produces un-differentiated approach percentages for many of the stimuli. There are at least two explanations for undifferentiated outcomes. First, if none or very few of the items are preferred, the individual may make more or less random selections. Alternatively, if sev-eral items are highly preferred and compete with each other in a concurrent arrange-ment, switches in preference across trials may also yield a somewhat random distri-bution.

30|$|In summary, {{since the}} audio stimuli {{used in these}} {{experiments}} were verbally identical, {{the results of our}} experiment indicate that similarity in subtle prosodic cues does indeed positively influence the efficiency of prosodic information transmission. Additionally, there are significant differences in response times at different morphing levels and under different <b>duration-based</b> pairing conditions, but no significant difference in response times between MFCC-based pairing conditions or pitch-based pairing conditions. In contrast, the visual fixation results show no significant differences at different morphing levels or different <b>duration-based</b> pairing conditions, but show significant differences between different MFCC-based pairing conditions and pitch-based pairing conditions. We cannot explain this contrastive result, except to suggest that perhaps this experiment revealed a “boundary” of human speech perception ability. Investigation of a possible boundary of this type would be an interesting topic of future research. Also note that the utterances of some pairs of participants may have sounded more artificial than others, and that even within the same pair of participants some sentences sounded more artificial than others since nasal sounds usually sound slightly more artificial than plosive sounds. This research does not investigate the influence of the naturalness of the synthesized voices, which should also be examined in future research.|$|E
40|$|AbstractBilateral, {{high-frequency}} {{stimulation of}} the basal ganglia (STN-DBS) is in widespread use {{for the treatment of}} the motor symptoms of Parkinson׳s disease (PD). We present here the first psychophysical investigation of the effect of STN-DBS upon perceptual timing in the hundreds of milliseconds range, with both <b>duration-based</b> (absolute) and beat-based (relative) tasks; 13 patients with PD were assessed with their STN-DBS ‘on’, ‘off’, and then ‘on’ again. Paired parametric analyses revealed no statistically significant differences for any task according to DBS status. We demonstrate, from the examination of confidence intervals, that any functionally relevant effect of STN-DBS on relative perceptual timing is statistically unlikely. For absolute, <b>duration-based</b> timing, we demonstrate that the activation of STN-DBS may either worsen performance or have no effect, but that it is unlikely to lead to significant improvement. Although these results are negative they have important implications for our understanding of perceptual timing and its relationship to motor functions within the timing network of the brain. They imply that the mechanisms involved in the perceptual processing of temporal information are likely to be functionally independent from those that underpin movement. Further, they suggest that the connections between STN and the subtantia nigra and globus pallidus are unlikely to be critical to beat-based perceptual timing...|$|E

40|$|Why do we {{need new}} {{charging}} mechanisms? Packet-Switched services do not require a dedicated path {{for the duration of}} the call. Instead, they rely on a virtual connection with the network setting up a real connection only when there is data to be sent/received, and then dropping the connection until more data is ready to be transmitted or received. As a result, network resources are used only when packets are in transmission, and there is thus no clear notion of "the duration of a call". Hence, users may no longer wish to be charged in the traditional <b>duration-based</b> manner. Besides, in contrast to today's dedicated networks, (e. g. PSTN, Frame Relay and even GSM) which carry a single application type at a fixed <b>duration-based</b> price, General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) and UMTS are multi-service networks. These require flexible pricing models, where price is a function of data volume, QoS provisioned, packet content, etc. For example, voice and video data is more or less continuous, thus requiring network resources more or less for the entire duration of its transfer. Consequently, we can expect voice and video to have a flat per-minute rate, whereas other services, such as, Resource (e. g. file) Access and fax/email applications may be charged on a volume basis, i. e. charged per MB of data transferred. Moreover, voice and video applications require bi-directional latency and bandwidt...|$|E
40|$|Research on {{interval}} timing strongly implicates the cerebellum and the {{basal ganglia}} {{as part of}} the timing network of the brain. Here we tested the hypothesis that the brain uses differential timing mechanisms and networks—specifically, that the cerebellum subserves the perception of the absolute duration of time intervals, whereas the basal ganglia mediate perception of time intervals relative to a regular beat. In a functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment, we asked human subjects to judge the difference in duration of two successive time intervals {{as a function of the}} preceding context of an irregular sequence of clicks (where the task relies on encoding the absolute duration of time intervals) or a regular sequence of clicks (where the regular beat provides an extra cue for relative timing). We found significant activations in an olivocerebellar network comprising the inferior olive, vermis, and deep cerebellar nuclei including the dentate nucleus during absolute, <b>duration-based</b> timing and a striato-thalamo-cortical network comprising the putamen, caudate nucleus, thalamus, supplementary motor area, premotor cortex, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex during relative, beat-based timing. Our results support two distinct timing mechanisms and underlying subsystems: first, a network comprising the inferior olive and the cerebellum that acts as a precision clock to mediate absolute, <b>duration-based</b> timing, and second, a distinct network for relative, beat-based timing incorporating a striato-thalamo-cortical network...|$|E

We examined these treatment effects on simulated forest succession dynamics and fire patterns including fire frequency. size, burned area, and shape complexity of burned patches. The comparison {{was carried out}} using a forest landscape model (LANDIS) for a sur-face fire regime in the Missouri Ozark Highlands. Results showed that incorporation of fuel into fire occurrence modeling significantly changed simulated dynamics of fire frequency and area burned. The <b>duration-based</b> minimum travel time algo-rithm produced the highest variability in fire size, and the dynamic percolation method produced the most irregular burned patch shapes. We also found that various fire modeling methods greatly affected temporal fire patterns in the short term, but such effects were less prominent in the long term. The simulated temporal changes in landscape-level species abundances were similar for different fire modeling methods, suggesting that a complex fire modeling method may not be necessary for examining coarse-scale vegetation dynamics.
