New York's Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) says it has found no sign of that, but in 2000 the Catskills chapter of Trout Unlimited, Riverkeeper and some other groups sued the city, arguing the Portal releases into the creek violated the federal Clean Water Act.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} {{simulations of}} an air plasma discharge at atmospheric pressure initiated by a needle anode set inside a dielectric capillary tube. We have studied {{the influence of the}} tube inner radius and its relative permittivity ε r on the <b>discharge</b> <b>structure</b> and dynamics. As a reference, we have used a relative permittivity ε r = 1 to study only the influence of the cylindrical constraint of the tube on the discharge. For a tube radius of 100 µm and ε r = 1, we have shown that the discharge fills the tube during its propagation and is rather homogeneous behind the discharge front. When the radius of the tube is in the range 300 to 600 µm, the <b>discharge</b> <b>structure</b> is tubular with peak values of electric field and electron density close to the dielectric surface. When the radius of the tube is larger than 700 µm, the tube has no influence on the discharge which propagates axially. For a tube radius of 100 µm, when ε r increases from 1 to 10, the <b>discharge</b> <b>structure</b> becomes tubular. We have noted that the velocity of propagation of the discharge in the tube increases when the front is more homogeneous and then, the discharge velocity increases with the decrease of the tube radius and ε r. Then, we have compared the relative influence of the value of tube radius and ε r on the discharge characteristics. Our simulations indicate that the geometrical constraint of the cylindrical tube has more influence than the value of ε r on the <b>discharge</b> <b>structure</b> and dynamics. Finally, we have studied the influence of photoemission processes on the <b>discharge</b> <b>structure</b> by varying the photoemission coefficient. As expected, we have shown that photoemission, as it increases the number of secondary electrons close to the dielectric surface, promotes the tubular structure of the discharge...|$|E

40|$|The {{comparative}} study {{of the dynamics of}} ultraviolet (UV) and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) induced hydrogen plasma was performed. It was shown that for low H 2 pressures and bias voltages, the dynamics of the two plasmas are significantly different. In the case of UV radiation, the plasma above the photocathode appears after UV pulse due to electron avalanche, after which <b>discharge</b> <b>structure</b> formation begins. In contrast, for EUV-induced plasma, a spatial <b>discharge</b> <b>structure</b> is formed immediately during radiation pulse through intensive gas ionization. This difference explains why EUV-induced plasmas are much denser at low pressures (less then 10 Pa) and bias voltages (less then 50 V). However, at pressures above 30 Pa EUV and UV induced plasmas show similar volt-ampere characteristics. This means that, in certain cases, plasma-chemistry in presence of EUV-induced plasma can be predicted from UV induced plasma experiments...|$|E

40|$|International audienceDielectric barrier {{discharges}} (DBD) in air at {{atmospheric pressure}} and at low frequency are mainly constituted of thin transient plasma filaments (or microdischarges) with radii {{of a few}} hundreds of micrometers. In this work, we consider a point-to-plane geometry with the dielectric covering the plane electrode. Plasma filaments are initiated by streamers, starting from the high-field region close to the point electrode. The plasma filaments deposit charges on the dielectric plate which screen the electric field and lead to an extinction of the discharge filaments. In this work we experimentally demonstrate the synchronous start of several filaments in a time range of less than a few tens of nanoseconds and we show that the charges deposited on the dielectric have a strong impact on the <b>discharge</b> <b>structure.</b> This is validated using a simple electrostatic model.

40|$|Gas {{discharges}} {{sustained by}} highfrequency travelling surface wave (SW) {{has been studied}} intensively till now due to their numerous technological applications. The SW that sustains the discharge is the eigen wave of <b>discharge</b> <b>structure,</b> therefore axial distribution of discharge parameters are mainly determined by {{the properties of the}} wave that sustains the discharge. Until recently, the SW propagation and, therefore, axial gas <b>discharge</b> <b>structure,</b> were studied with the assumption of uniform radial plasma density profile. However, in real systems plasma density is always heterogeneous in radial direction and the conditions of plasma or hybrid resonances may take place at the periphery of discharge vessels [1]. It is necessary to note, that transverse electromagnetic waves are slightly damping waves in weakly collisional discharge plasma. But efficiency of energy transfer can be increased substantially in the regions of hybrid resonances, where electromagnetic waves transforms into plasma waves [2]. The purpose of this report is to determine properties of the nonsymmetric potential SW (wavelength, spatial damping rate and SW radial field distribution) in magnetized plasma column with radially heterogeneous plasma electron density, and, finally, to determine plasma density axial structure in the discharges sustained by such waves in diffusion controlled regime.

When hydrothermal fluids come into contact with the cold subarctic seawater, it triggers catalytic-driven precipitation of smectite group minerals and other minerals. In the long term, elongated structures growing from the sea bottom are formed. The sample material shows a highly porous architecture, as it is built up of numerous small tubes. These constitute the waters’ pathway from the hydrothermal reservoir to the subarctic ocean water.|$|R

It's shown that the thickness of solid insulator {{and the kind of}} oil significantly influence the characteristics of creeping discharge and especially the stopping length Lf. For a given thickness, Lf increases quasi-linearly with the voltage; it decreases when the thickness increases. Lf is longer when the point is positive than with a negative point. For given voltage and thickness of pressboard, Lf is greater in vegetable oil than in mineral oil; Lf is generally greater of 60 % in vegetable oil than in mineral oil when the point is positive and it's of 40 % greater when it's negative. The values of Lf merge into one another in vegetable oils.
