5|$|Upon {{responding}} to a public disturbance call, Tre, a Bloods <b>gang</b> <b>member,</b> yells racial insults at Zavala, who responds by accepting a one-on-one fist fight. Zavala beats and arrests him, but wins Tre's respect for not charging him with assault. Later that night, Tre and his fellow Bloods gang members are attacked {{by a group of}} Sureños in a drive-by shooting and one of Tre's friends is killed. The next day, the officers respond to a noise complaint at a house party full of Sureños, where Taylor encounters a <b>gang</b> <b>member</b> named Big Evil, whose truck he later finds is filled with ornately decorated firearms and a large amount of money.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} HIV testing behaviours, perceived vulnerability to HIV and correlates of sexual risk behaviours of young adult Latino and African American male <b>gang</b> <b>members</b> in Los Angeles, California. Data {{were collected from}} 249 <b>gang</b> <b>members</b> aged 18 - 26 years. The majority (59 %) of <b>gang</b> <b>members</b> reported unprotected vaginal intercourse (UVI) in the past 12 months. Only one-third (33. 2 %) of <b>gang</b> <b>members</b> had ever been tested for HIV. In our multivariate analysis, <b>gang</b> <b>members</b> who reported UVI {{were more likely to}} have engaged in the following behaviours: had sex with someone they just met (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 4. 51), had sex with someone they think or know had a sexually transmitted infection (STI; AOR = 4. 67) or had sex while incarcerated (AOR = 8. 92). In addition, <b>gang</b> <b>members</b> with a higher perceived vulnerability to HIV were less likely to report UVI in the previous 12 months (AOR = 0. 75). These findings offer implications for development of an HIV prevention intervention for young Latino and African American male <b>gang</b> <b>members...</b>|$|R

5|$|Walsh was on {{the team}} that {{captured}} criminal Arthur Barker, son of gangster Ma Barker, in Chicago in 1935 and was later involved in tracking Public Enemy Number One Al Brady in 1937. On October 12 of that year, {{he was with the}} group of FBI agents who ambushed and killed Brady in a shoot-out at a Bangor, Maine sporting goods store. While waiting for Brady to arrive, he acted as a clerk in the store for several days and arrested Brady <b>Gang</b> <b>member</b> James Dalhover. As the operation leader, Walsh's job was to alert thirteen other agents, as well as over 30 other state and local policemen, of any gang member's arrival by pulling a cord on the window. As they were interrogating Dalhover in the store Clarence Lee Shaffer, Jr., another <b>gang</b> <b>member,</b> entered the building and began firing at the agents. While arresting Dalhover, Walsh took bullets to his hand, shoulder and right chest, but quickly returned to work.|$|E
5|$|In New York Bond meets up {{with his}} {{counterpart}} in the CIA, Felix Leiter. The two visit some of Mr Big's nightclubs in Harlem, but are captured. Bond is interrogated by Mr Big, who uses his fortune-telling employee, Solitaire (so named because she excludes men from her life), to determine if Bond is telling the truth. Solitaire lies to Mr Big, supporting Bond's cover story. Mr Big decides to release Bond and Leiter, and has one of Bond's fingers broken. On leaving, Bond kills several of Mr Big's men, while Leiter is released with minimal physical harm by a <b>gang</b> <b>member,</b> sympathetic because of a shared appreciation of jazz.|$|E

Dummy, who had been befriended by Danny, grapples with Maxie; the gun goes off, killing its owner.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a single case}} study of one street gang in one London borough. Semistructured {{interviews were conducted with}} 12 <b>gang</b> <b>members,</b> or former <b>gang</b> <b>members,</b> and seven practitioners. The practitioners and <b>gang</b> <b>members</b> / ex-gang members reported different perspectives on how the gang was structured and drug dealing was organised. The <b>gang</b> <b>members</b> / ex-gang members suggested that the gang is a loose social network with little recognisable formal organisation. Although individual <b>gang</b> <b>members</b> sell drugs, the gang should not be viewed as a drug dealing organisation. Rather it is a composition of individual drug dealers who cooperate out of mutual self-interest. Therefore, some <b>gang</b> <b>members</b> are best described as independent entrepreneurs while others are subcontractors looking to 'go solo'. The seven practitioners, however, tended to describe a more hierarchically structured gang, with formal recruitment processes. This divergence of perspective highlights an important consideration for policy and research...|$|R

The jail sentences also acted as a glue to unite the Mexican and Mexican American community in a common cause, a fight against class distinction based on prejudice and racism, a fight against the establishment. In prison, 38th Street <b>gang</b> <b>members</b> were held in high esteem. On October 4, 1943, the convictions of the <b>gang</b> <b>members</b> were overturned and the <b>gang</b> <b>members</b> were allegedly welcomed back to their communities as heroes.|$|R

5|$|Arkham Origins {{introduces}} a multiplayer component to the series. Invisible Predator Online revolves around a gang war in Blackgate Prison between supervillains Joker and Bane. Three Joker gang members fight three Bane gang members, {{and in turn}} the team of Batman and Robin. Gangs win by killing all the opposing team's reinforcements, while Batman and Robin win by acquiring intimidation points (from eliminating gang members). A <b>gang</b> <b>member</b> can become boss (Joker or Bane), gaining more-powerful abilities. Gang members can access guns and explosives; Batman and Robin can access gadgets and abilities from the main game, including Detective Vision. Gang members have a limited Enhanced Vision, which requires recharging.

5|$|Eastwood {{joined the}} Marsh Agency, and {{although}} Lubin landed him his biggest role {{to date in}} The First Traveling Saleslady (1956) and later hired him for Escapade in Japan, without a formal contract Eastwood was struggling. Upon the advice of Irving Leonard, his financial advisor, he changed talent agencies to the Kumin-Olenick Agency in 1956 and Mitchell Gertz in 1957. He landed several small roles in 1956 as a temperamental army officer for a segment of ABC's Reader's Digest series, and as a motorcycle <b>gang</b> <b>member</b> on a Highway Patrol episode. In 1957, Eastwood played a cadet in West Point series and a suicidal gold prospector on Death Valley Days. In 1958, he played a Navy lieutenant in a segment of Navy Log and in early 1959 made a notable guest appearance on Maverick opposite James Garner as a cowardly villain intent on marrying a rich girl for money.

5|$|His mother {{raised the}} family, {{including}} Coleman's brother (Lillashawn) and sister, in the Humboldt Park community area, then the West Side and finally Oak Park. Coleman describes his stepfather as a long-time <b>gang</b> <b>member</b> with an extensive criminal record. After enduring formative years with gunfights outside elementary school, home loss {{due to an}} apartment fire, and expulsion hearings, his stepfather, Mose Oliver, introduced him to wrestling {{to keep him out}} of trouble. Federal records confirm that Oliver is an alleged 1990s gang enforcer who served time from 2004 to 2011 for participation in Operation Day Trader. The wrestling started in about 2001. By sixth grade both his father and stepfather were incarcerated and his father figure was his wrestling coach, Mike Powell. Coleman attended Ella Flagg Young elementary school. Barral raised her family with little assistance away from the gang influences of the West Side. She applied for section 8 assistance. Coleman, who was nearly expelled as a sophomore, graduated from Oak Park and River Forest High School in Oak Park, IL in 2009. He has studied at Northern Michigan University.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT This paper explores {{drinking}} by girl <b>gang</b> <b>members.</b> Sociologists and crimin-ologists {{have tended}} to concentrate on both male <b>gang</b> <b>members</b> and their involvement in drug dealing. This pre-occupation has tended to overshadow not only the role of female <b>gang</b> <b>members</b> but also the importance of drinking within youth gangs. In spite of a growing interest in female drinking, ethnographic and qualitative research on female drinking is still much less developed than that devoted to male drinking. In analyzing the culture of drinking {{in the lives of}} girl <b>gang</b> <b>members,</b> we uncover the extent to which alcohol plays a central part in their everyday lives. Data for this paper are drawn from the results of an on-going study of street gangs in the San Francisco Bay area, in which 97 female <b>gang</b> <b>members</b> were interviewed using both a quantitative and qualitative interview schedule...|$|R

5|$|The video premiered on October 4, 1994, on MTV. It {{begins with}} showing the {{neighborhood}} of Harlem, with Madonna as a singer in a small jazz club. She simply sits in the club with her band and sings for her small, mostly black and Latino audience. Interspersed throughout the video are scenes {{of people living in}} Harlem, doing their daily chores, including a supporting cast of transvestite prostitutes, a pimp, and a black <b>gang</b> <b>member</b> who shows off the scars on his body. During the intermediate verses, Madonna is shown writhing in the lap of an older, maternal woman, who symbolically baptizes her by splashing water on her forehead. Near the video's end, Madonna walks through the neighborhood and climbs a set of stairs to have a reunion with her family, a young Latin man and their supposed son. The video ends with Madonna smiling towards the camera while sitting at the nightclub.|$|E
5|$|Hasselbaink {{was born}} on 27 March 1972 in Paramaribo, Suriname (then part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands), to Frank Ware and Cornelli Hasselbaink; he was the {{youngest}} of six children. At the age of three Hasselbaink was run over by a moped which broke his right leg. In October 1978, his mother took him and three siblings to live in Zaandam, Netherlands; his father remained in Suriname and rarely contacted the family. The next year Hasselbaink began playing youth football for Gestaagt Volharding Overwint (GVO), initially as a goalkeeper. He later played for Zaansche Football club (ZFC) and Zaanlandia as a right winger. He joined a street gang as a teenager and spent three months in a youth detention facility for stealing. After his release he joined the youth team at DWS, but was dismissed from the club for stealing the watch of a first-team player. He began his senior career with Telstar, while still a <b>gang</b> <b>member,</b> and had disciplinary issues at the club due to his persistent lateness. He made his Eerste Divisie debut on 27 October 1990, in a 2–0 defeat at VVV-Venlo. Head coach Niels Overweg dismissed him after he turned up late to a match.|$|E
5|$|One {{day before}} senior year, Veronica is working {{a job at}} a {{restaurant}}. Soon, a boy named Kelvin (Charles Duckworth) comes into the restaurant and says that he failed his drug test, even though he has been clean for ten months. Veronica sees an interview with her father, Keith (Enrico Colantoni), on TV, and it is revealed that he wrote a book about the Lilly Kane case. The episode then flashes back to the romantic cliffhanger at the end of season one, and it is revealed that Logan was at the door. Logan reveals that the biker gang beat him up after he kicked Weevil (Francis Capra) in the face. Although he woke up with a knife and found one of the gang members was stabbed, Logan tells Veronica that he did not stab the <b>gang</b> <b>member,</b> and Veronica believes him. However, Leo (Max Greenfield) comes and arrests Logan. Wallace (Percy Daggs III) says that he and Meg (Alona Tal) also failed their drug test. Wallace informs Veronica about the details of the drug test, and the episode flashes back to show the details of Veronica and Logan starting to date over the summer. Veronica talks to all the students who were framed in the drug test, and they all say some people might want to harm them. Veronica has become estranged from Meg, and Veronica reveals that Logan was released from prison soon after he was arrested.|$|E
2500|$|Also {{identified}} as an issue within the prison system is gang violence, because many <b>gang</b> <b>members</b> retain their <b>gang</b> identity and affiliations when imprisoned. Segregation of identified <b>gang</b> <b>members</b> {{from the general population}} of inmates, with different gangs being housed in separate units often results in the imprisonment of these <b>gang</b> <b>members</b> with their friends and criminal cohorts. Some feel this has the effect of turning prisons into [...] "institutions of higher criminal learning." ...|$|R

50|$|According to the police, <b>gang</b> <b>members</b> had {{recently}} escaped from prison and {{missed out on}} {{the opening of the}} military depots and were short of weapons. They went to Levan to take Kallashnikovs from roma villagers, because they believed the roma had too many. The <b>gang</b> <b>members</b> had been celebrating the release from prison at “Klubi i Ilias” in Fier and after consuming large amounts of alcohol went to a bar in Levan and over drinks demanded from the local roma leader one Kallashnikov for each of their <b>gang</b> <b>members.</b> The roma leader explained that the roma had only one Kallashnikov per person and had turned in all the extras at the police station in Fier. Arguments followed and the <b>gang</b> <b>members</b> shot and killed the roma leader and began shooting other roma customers in the bar. Local Roma villagers quickly surrounded the bar and demanded the gang's surrender. Even though they were drunk and poorly armed, the gang continued shooting from inside until they ran out of ammunition. Only three <b>gang</b> <b>members</b> who were sober enough were able to escape. All the remaining <b>gang</b> <b>members</b> were executed by the roma in fear of revenge.|$|R
5000|$|Women {{associated}} with gangs but who lack membership are typically categorized {{based on their}} relation to <b>gang</b> <b>members.</b> A survey of Mexican American <b>gang</b> <b>members</b> and associates defined these categories as girlfriends, hoodrats, good girls, and relatives. [...] Girlfriends are longterm partners of male <b>gang</b> <b>members,</b> and may have children with them. Hoodrats are seen as being sexually promiscuous and heavy drug and alcohol users. <b>Gang</b> <b>members</b> may engage in casual sex with these girls, {{but they are not}} viewed as potential longterm partners and are severely stigmatized by both men and women in gang culture. Good girls are long term friends of members, often from childhood, and relatives are typically sisters or cousins. These are fluid categories, and women often change status as they move between them.Valdez found that women with ties to <b>gang</b> <b>members</b> are often used to hold illegal weapons and drugs, typically, because members believe the girls {{are less likely to be}} searched by police for such items.|$|R
