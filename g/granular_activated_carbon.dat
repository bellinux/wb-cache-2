The first stage is known as affination and involves immersing the sugar crystals in a concentrated syrup that softens and removes the sticky brown coating without dissolving them. The crystals are then separated from the liquor and dissolved in water. The resulting syrup is treated either by a carbonatation or by a phosphatation process. Both involve the precipitation of a fine solid in the syrup and when this is filtered out, many of the impurities are removed at the same time. Removal of color is achieved by using either a <b>granular</b> <b>activated</b> <b>carbon</b> or an ion-exchange resin. The sugar syrup is concentrated by boiling and then cooled and seeded with sugar crystals, causing the sugar to crystallize out. The liquor is spun off in a centrifuge and the white crystals are dried in hot air and ready to be packaged or used. The surplus liquor is made into refiners' molasses.|$|E

In this study, two commercial <b>granular</b> <b>activated</b> <b>carbons</b> obtained by physical activation of coconut shell, specifically developed and selected to purify potable water from dissolved organics (GCN 1240) and for use in gold recovery systems (GCN 816 G), were studied in batch systems to evaluate their effectiveness for separation of lead (II) from aqueous solutions. A characterization of the two carbons, different in particle size, is provided through determination of their pH(PZC) and scanning electron microscope analysis.
