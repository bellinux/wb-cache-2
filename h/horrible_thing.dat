5|$|The first {{incarnation}} {{of my life}} was as a ruthless killer. I still live {{with a sense of}} sin over those I killed. I chased them and shot them down—such a <b>horrible</b> <b>thing</b> to do. Now, I go to the kindergarten every day and interact with the children. I want to nurture kind and considerate hearts in all of them. Harada also traveled to the United Kingdom and United States to meet some of the American and British airmen he had fought against, including the American ace Joe Foss who {{is believed to have been}} the pilot who shot down his plane. As part of his travels Harada visited Santa Isabel Island, where he located the wreckage of his fighter and brought a section of it back to Japan.|$|E
25|$|At the beginning, Spanish {{flagship}} Santa Teresa did {{a warning}} shot without bullet {{and ordered the}} enemy to give up arms and surrender, Haultain's fleet, ordered to not open fire unless attacked, responded quickly with a bullet shot with one of two Dutch captains, thus declaring that the combat was accepted. The Dutch ship had discharged at the midpoint of cannons and muskets, but retained Fadrique vessel to be almost edge to edge with the enemy, to be exploited until the last bullet {{and he had the}} utmost vigor. The Spanish broadside caused a <b>horrible</b> <b>thing</b> to that of those watching from land and sea, getting fire to the garrison of the Dutch tables and causing such damage and casualties to them that the Dutch immediately retreated. The Spanish captain went through the enemy formation, firing in all directions and with great speed and accuracy but receiving numerous discharges from the enemy.|$|E

500|$|On April 22, 1986, Yankovic began {{recording}} {{three new}} original songs {{for his next}} album: [...] "Don't Wear Those Shoes", [...] "One of Those Days", and [...] "Dog Eat Dog". Although [...] "Don't Wear Those Shoes" [...] is an original composition, Yankovic admitted that the intro {{was inspired by the}} style of The Kinks. Lyrically, the song is a plea by the singer to his wife not to not wear certain shoes which he cannot stand. [...] "One of Those Days" [...] is a song detailing horrible things as if they were everyday annoyances. Each <b>horrible</b> <b>thing</b> escalates up to global annihilation while more mundane annoyances pop up at different times.|$|E
500|$|In a 1988 {{interview}} with Barbara Walters, Fonda expressed regret {{for some of}} her comments and actions, stating:I {{would like to say}} something, not just to Vietnam veterans in New England, but to men who were in Vietnam, who I hurt, or whose pain I caused to deepen because of things that I said or did. I was trying to help end the killing and the war, but there were times when I was thoughtless and careless about it and I'm very sorry that I hurt them. And I want to apologize to them and their families. [...] I will go to my grave regretting the photograph of me in an anti-aircraft gun, which looks like I was trying to shoot at American planes. It hurt so many soldiers. It galvanized such hostility. It was the most <b>horrible</b> <b>thing</b> I could possibly have done. It was just thoughtless.|$|E
500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} many positive reviews from fans and television critics. One-time The Simpsons writer and comedian Ricky Gervais named it his second favorite episode, and said: [...] "Mr. Burns gives [...] this terrible plaque above his desk that says, 'Don't forget: You're here forever.' It's about how sometimes things don't {{go the way}} you planned, which is pretty amazing in a cartoon. Homer then puts up all the pictures of Maggie he's ever taken to strategically cover this <b>horrible</b> <b>thing</b> so it now reads, 'Do it for her.' It gives me a lump in the throat thinking about it." [...] Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, {{the authors of the}} book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, said: [...] "A surprisingly traditional episode. The flashback to 1993 seems a bit odd, but this {{is a good example of}} a story that doesn't overly rely on set pieces and confounded expectations for its success." [...] In a review of the sixth season, Joshua Klein of the Chicago Tribune cited [...] "And Maggie Makes Three", [...] "Treehouse of Horror V", [...] "Homer Badman", and [...] "Lisa's Rival" [...] among his favorite episodes of the season.|$|E

500|$|While imprisoned, Kemper {{has participated}} {{in a number of}} interviews, {{including}} a segment in the 1982 documentary The Killing of America, as well as an appearance in the 1984 documentary Murder: No Apparent Motive. His interviews are notable for their contribution to understanding the mind of serial killers, with FBI profiler John E. Douglas describing Kemper as [...] "among the brightest prison inmates" [...] he ever interviewed and capable of [...] "rare insight for a violent criminal." [...] Kemper is also forthcoming about the nature of his crimes and has said that he participated in the interviews to save others like himself from killing; stating {{at the end of his}} Murder: No Apparent Motive interview: [...] "There's somebody out there that is watching this and hasn't done that – hasn't killed people, and wants to, and rages inside and struggles with that feeling, or is so sure they have it under control. They need to talk to somebody about it. Trust somebody enough to sit down and talk about something that isn't a crime; thinking that way isn't a crime. Doing it isn't just a crime, it's a <b>horrible</b> <b>thing,</b> it doesn't know when to quit and it can't be stopped easily once it starts." [...] He also conducted an interview with French writer Stéphane Bourgoin in 1991.|$|E
500|$|The South Park {{football}} team plays a rival team from Middle Park, Colorado. Like South Park itself, Middle Park is an actual basin in the Rocky Mountains of north-central Colorado. Matt Stone said the Middle Park kids {{were made to}} seem richer and cooler than the South Park students {{because that was the}} perception real South Park residents have of the actual Middle Park. Richard Stamos, who sings during halftime in the episode's football game, is the fictional brother of John Stamos, a real-life actor best known for his roles on Full House and ER. Trey Parker and Matt Stone did not know Stamos when they wrote [...] "Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride", but Parker said they assumed he was [...] "a big douche" [...] because of his role on Full House, which Parker called [...] "just the most <b>horrible</b> <b>thing</b> ever put on television". Since the episode aired, however, Parker and Stone have become acquainted with Stamos and found him to be [...] "a really, really cool guy". John Stamos told them he loved the inclusion of the Richard Stamos character in [...] "Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride". Richard Stamos sings [...] "Lovin' You", a 1975 hit single by singer-songwriter Minnie Riperton. Parker chose it because he felt it was a popular song in the gay community, and also because, [...] "I've just always hated that song. I hate any song from that era, really. It's just a horrible time for music." ...|$|E
500|$|Pilgrim {{is often}} {{noted for its}} study of theodicy, or its defense of God's {{goodness}} {{in the face of}} evil. [...] The narrator attempts to reconcile the harsh natural world, with its [...] "seemingly horrid mortality," [...] with the belief in a benevolent God. [...] Death is repeatedly mentioned as a natural, although cruel progression: [...] "Evolution", the narrator states, [...] "loves death more than it loves you or me." [...] A passage in the second chapter of the book describes a frog being [...] "sucked dry" [...] by a [...] "giant water bug" [...] as the narrator watches; this necessary cruelty shows order in life and death, no matter how difficult it may be to watch. [...] The narrator especially sees inherent cruelty in the insect world: [...] "Fish gotta swim and birds gotta fly... insects, it seems, gotta do one <b>horrible</b> <b>thing</b> after another. I never ask why of a vulture or a shark, but I ask why of almost every insect I see. More than one insect... is an assault on all human virtue, all hope of a reasonable god." [...] While she remains drawn to the ultimately repugnant and amoral natural world, she also questions her place in it. The narrator states, [...] "I had thought to live {{by the side of the}} creek in order to shape my life to its free flow. [...] But I seem to have reached a point where I must draw the line. It looks as though the creek is not buoying me up but dragging me down." ...|$|E

2500|$|At a Republican {{fund-raising}} {{event in}} February 2015, Giuliani stated, [...] "I do not believe, and I {{know this is}} a <b>horrible</b> <b>thing</b> to say, but I {{do not believe that the}} president [...] loves America", and [...] "He doesn’t love you. And he doesn't love me. He wasn't brought up the way you were brought up and I was brought up, through love of this country." [...] In response to criticism of the remarks, Giuliani said, [...] "Some people thought it was racist—I thought that was a joke, since he was brought up by a white mother... This isn't racism. This is socialism or possibly anti-colonialism." [...] White House deputy press secretary Eric Schultz said he agreed with Giuliani [...] "that it was a <b>horrible</b> <b>thing</b> to say", but said he would leave it up to the people who heard Giuliani directly to assess if the remarks were appropriate for the event. Although he received some support for his controversial comments, Giuliani said he also received several death threats within 48 hours.|$|E

2500|$|As one of {{the highest-ranking}} Catholics in the country, Catherine was an obvious target for Protestant extremists, and it was hardly {{surprising}} that the Popish Plot of 1678 would directly threaten her position. However, Catherine was completely secure in her husband's favour ("she could never do anything wicked, {{and it would be}} a <b>horrible</b> <b>thing</b> to abandon her" [...] he told Gilbert Burnet), and the House of Lords, most of whom knew her and liked her, refused by an overwhelming majority to impeach her.

2500|$|A final line of blame-laying {{holds that}} major {{industrialists}} either caused {{or at least}} significantly exacerbated the famine through speculation, war profiteering, hoarding, and corruption [...] "unscrupulous, heartless grain traders forcing up prices based on false rumors". Working from an assumption that the Bengal famine claimed 1.5 million lives, the Famine Inquiry Commission made a [...] "gruesome calculation" [...] that [...] "nearly a thousand rupees [...] of profits were accrued per death". As the Famine Inquiry Commission put it: [...] "a {{large part of the}} community lived in plenty while others starved ... corruption was widespread throughout the province and in many classes of society." [...] British Field Marshal Viscount William Slim observed that [...] "the <b>horrible</b> <b>thing</b> about Calcutta was the contrast of the blatant wealth of some of its citizens with the squalid misery, beyond mere poverty, at their very doors." ...|$|E

[...] The day after the debate, Mourdock issued a statement saying, [...] "God creates life, and that was my point. God does not want rape, and by no means was I suggesting that he does. Rape is a <b>horrible</b> <b>thing,</b> and for anyone to twist my words otherwise is absurd and sick." [...] He later said at a press conference, [...] "I believe God controls the universe. I don't believe biology works in an uncontrolled fashion." [...] The controversy likely contributed to Mourdock's loss to Representative Joe Donnelly, and Tom LoBianco of Associated Press' The Big Story commented upon the similarities to Akin's comments.|$|E
