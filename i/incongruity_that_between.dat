40|$|One Acupuncture”, like “One Medicine”, has the {{potential}} to improve research quality and clinical outcomes. However, while human acupuncture point locations have remained largely consistent over time, the veterinary versions remain imprecise and variable. Establishing anatomical criteria for veterinary acupuncture atlases in keeping with the human template will create congruence across species, benefiting both research and practice. Anatomic criteria for points based on objectively verifiable structures will facilitate translational research. Functionally comparative innervation, in particular, should be similar between species, as the nerves initiate and mediate physiologic changes that result from point stimulation. If researchers choose points that activate different nerves in one species than in another, unpredictable outcomes may occur. Variability in point placement will impede progress and hamper the ability of researchers and clinicians to make meaningful comparisons across species. This paper reveals <b>incongruities</b> <b>that</b> remain <b>between</b> human and veterinary acupuncture points, illustrating the need to analyze anatomical characteristics of each point to assure accuracy in selecting transpositional acupuncture locations...|$|R
40|$|The amusing {{tale of the}} vain cock and. the {{deceitful}} fox is {{narrated by}} one of the 'Preeste thre' in the General Prologue to the Canterbury Tales. Chaucer gives us no further information about this character. The only thing we learn about him at this stage is that he is accompanying the Prioress on the pilgrimage to Canterbury. Yet he comes to life when the Host turns to "This sweete preest, this goodly man, Sir John" and urges him to narrate a merry tale that would cheer up the whole company of pilgrims. Chaucer's vivid account of the cock's adventure is a fine piece of mock-heroic writing as he treats a trivial subject in the heroic manner which is usually reserved for epic poetry to enhance the qualities and achievements of heroes. However, mock-heroic is not intended to praise but to ridicule and {{in the process of doing}} so it gives rise to comedy.

40|$|The {{projects}} {{presented in}} this thesis, which include performance, photography, and sculpture, investigate perception and cognition through the study and reconfiguration of content drawn from philosophy, cognitive science, and linguistics. I suspect that the language that we use to communicate about perception may be faulty. Within this critical perspective, the projects are propositions {{in response to the}} question: What is the form of perception/cognition? Underlying the projects is a fundamental philosophical question: Why do we have conscious experience? In philosophy these are referred to, respectively, as the hard and easy problems of consciousness. I investigate the linguistic structures of 'language' and 'parole' in a related attempt to understand the function of language, first independently, and then within a cognitive framework. The experiments begin with words such as 'definition', 'vision', 'perception' and represent systems defined by these signifies using objects, actions, and images. Reconfiguring the words into tangible experiments allows the nature of the phenomenon to be examined outside of the limitations of linguistic description. Ideally, the <b>incongruity</b> <b>that</b> might exist <b>between</b> the words and the experiences of perception and cognition can be uncovered through this process. by Sofia Rebeca Berinstein.

The sweet old wainscoted parlour, the view of the garden that reminded her of scenes in Shakespeare's comedies, all that was exquisite in the home of his forefathers--what visible reference was there to these fine things in poor Lionel's stable-stamped composition? When she came in this evening and saw his small sons making competitive noises in their mugs (Miss Steet checked this impropriety on her entrance) she asked herself what they would have to show twenty years later for the frame that made them just then a picture. Would they be wonderfully ripe and noble, the perfection of human culture? The contrast was before her again, the sense of the same curious duplicity (in the literal meaning of the word) that she had felt at Plash--the way the genius of such an old house was all peace and decorum and the spirit that prevailed there, outside of the schoolroom, was contentious and impure. She had often been struck with it before--with that perfection of machinery which can still at certain times make English life go on of itself with a stately rhythm long after there is corruption within it.|$|R

Interviews were conducted with 36 full-time women students who had returned to graduate school after a five-year lapse in their iormal training. The women placed {{a high value on}} the cognitive and affective aspects of their recreational activipies. However, the score concerning their behavioral attitudes ware lower, indicating <b>that</b> <b>incongruity</b> existed <b>between</b> what the women thought and felt about recreation and what they did in regard to their actual activities. The greatest barriers to recreation were related to limited time, work and school being the highest priorities; and too much daily stress. The returning students said they participated less in mass media, social, outdoor, sport, and hobby activities when they returned to school. The study suggested implications for those who may be programming for women who aro returning to school. With the growing number of returning students, traditional student activity and sports programs {{may not be the best}} methods for supplementing the recreational needs of this group of students.

50|$|Gender {{roles in}} media and {{advertising}} is impacted by humor. Advertising frequently uses gender roles to promote products. There are various stereotypes {{in regards to}} humorous advertising with both males and females. Stereotypes can product oversimplified conceptions and misapplied knowledge evaluations. Humor is generated on two steps.

Humor occurs when it seems that things are normal, {{while at the same}} time something goes wrong that breaks our expectations. Men could be depicted in domestic roles doing chores, whereas women would be presented in independent roles. This would break our expectation and society norms that revolve around the gender roles.

The refusal of polio vaccine in Nigeria and the recurrent epidemics that ensued were in part driven by the people's resentment at the resources poured into what was seen locally as a lesser health issue while the people's major and pressing primary health care needs were going unmet and (in the case of Nigeria) big killers like measles left unaddressed. 'One Health' (simultaneous and coordinated provision of health measures for human and animal populations through shared systems) offers positive prospects, but it works best where horizontal primary health care systems are built up alongside any vertical, top-down, single disease-focused interventions.|$|R

Reputation-based trust {{management in the}} Pilarcos open service ecosystem combines shared experience information on the actors’ past behaviour and the decision context to estimate the risks of a collaboration. The trust decision process is semi-automatic, with selected decisions forwarded to a human user. A particularly interesting feature of the decision process is <b>incongruity,</b> <b>that</b> is, unexpected changes in service performance. In the classical example, a previously well-behaved service turns malicious to cash in its good reputation as ill-gained monetary profit. If the reputation system swiftly reacts to such changes, it protects its user more efficiently and deters misbehaviour. We present a new model for detecting and reacting to incongruities in a reputation-based trust management system. The model {{is based on the}} concept of reputation epochs, dividing an actor’s reputation into periods of internally consistent behaviour. In contrast to earlier approaches, this model provides the necessary flexibility for the trust management system to adjust to constantly changing business situations...|$|R

Sarcasm detection has been a challenging research problem, and its importance for NLP applications such as review summarization, dialog systems and sentiment analysis is well recognized. Sarcasm can often be traced to <b>incongruity</b> <b>that</b> becomes apparent as the full sentence unfolds. This presence of incongruity- implicit or explicit- affects the way readers eyes move through the text. We observe {{the difference in the}} behaviour of the eye, while reading sarcastic and non sarcastic sentences.

We perform statistical classification using the enhanced feature set so obtained.

40|$|People {{continuously}} {{experience the}} world and the objects in it through all their senses. Product designers can influence the way people experience products by paying attention to the multiple sensory aspects of product design. Designing sensory experiences can be aimed at communicating a consistent message to all sensory channels, making this message a stronger one. The opposite approach, designing a product in a way that incongruent information is provided to different senses, {{can be used as a}} means to create surprising products. Perceiving one sensory aspect of a product first can create an expectation on what will be perceived through other sense modalities. The information perceived at a later stage may disconfirm the expectation formed upon the initial perception, resulting in a surprise reaction. In this thesis, three types of sensory incongruities were studied: visual-tactual, visual-auditory and visual-olfactory. Our studies suggest that out of the three types of <b>incongruities</b> <b>that</b> were studied, visual-tactual incongruities in products are most effective in evoking surprise reactions. Furthermore, the surprise reaction seems to have a long-term effect on 3 other emotions: interest, fascination and confusion. From the experiments on visual-auditory and visual-olfactory <b>incongruity</b> we concluded <b>that</b> people seem less likely to experience surprise upon encountering one of these types of sensory incongruities. Nevertheless, the sound of a product can in some cases influence the overall perceived expression of that product. Designers should always carefully consider whether to design a sensory incongruity or a product that communicates a consistent message to all sensory channels. Industrial Design Engineerin...|$|R
