40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} an {{investigation}} of an improved longitudinal joint with <b>headed</b> <b>bar</b> details connecting precast decked bulb tee girders for accelerated bridge construction. The testing study included two phases. In phase I, five beam specimens with various <b>headed</b> <b>bar</b> details and a continuous reinforced specimen were tested under flexure loadings. A <b>headed</b> <b>bar</b> detail with 152  mm lap length was recommended for further study. In phase II, two slabs connected by the selected joint were tested under flexure and flexure-shear loadings. Test results were evaluated based on structural behaviors including capacity, deflection, and failure mode. At last, a validated strut-and-tie model was developed to anticipate {{the capacity of the}} improved longitudinal joint. It shows that the proposed <b>headed</b> <b>bar</b> details can provide a continuous force transfer in the joint. The lap length interacting with the spacing of the <b>headed</b> <b>bar</b> is the most significant parameter of the improved joint details. To develop a full strength joint, the lap length should not be less than 152  mm and be designed by the strength requirement. The strut-and-tie model can provide a conservative strength anticipation of the joint and it is the lower bound of the ultimate capacity of the joint...|$|E

A fourth column test investigated the response with the seismic crossties replaced by <b>headed</b> <b>bars.</b> Finally, two column specimens were constructed and tested {{with all of the}} transverse reinforcement provided by <b>headed</b> <b>bars.</b> These six specimens enabled an assessment of the effectiveness of <b>headed</b> <b>bars</b> in confining the concrete.

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the design and}} behaviour of narrow cast in-situ joints between precast concrete elements in which continuity of reinforcement is achieved through overlapping headed bars. The use of headed bars minimises the required reinforcement lap length and hence joint width, thereby, maximising the area of precast concrete units. Confining reinforcement {{in the form of}} transverse bars and vertical shear studs is installed within the joint. Improved understanding of the behaviour of such joints is obtained by means of experimental testing and numerical analysis. In total, 32 tensile specimens and five flexural specimens were tested. The main longitudinal reinforcement in all specimens consisted of 25 mm diameter headed bars with 70 mm square heads. The tests investigated the influence on joint performance of concrete strength, confining shear studs, transverse bar arrangement, <b>headed</b> <b>bar</b> lap length and spacing, and out-of-plane offset of precast planks. For tensile specimens, a lap length of 100 mm with four 16 mm transverse bars and concrete compressive strength of 28 MPa was sufficient for <b>headed</b> <b>bar</b> yield. Ductile flexural failure, with <b>headed</b> <b>bar</b> yield, was achieved with the same lap length, two 20 mm transverse bars and concrete compressive strength of 39 MPa. A nonlinear finite element model (NLFEM) is presented with results showing that it captures the behaviour of the joint well. Additional parametric studies carried out with the validated NLFEM provide otherwise unavailable insights into joint behaviour. In conjunction with an appropriate safety format, the model is considered suitable for the design of standard joint configurations. Analytical models based on the strut-and-tie method and upper bound plasticity are presented. The models were found to give reasonable predictions of joint strength, but are not capable of fully capturing the observed joint behaviour. An improved strut and tie design method is suggested and recommendations are made for optimising joint design. Open Acces...|$|E
40|$|Ductile coupled {{walls are}} {{important}} elements in resisting seismic loads in tall buildings. Ductile coupling beams must possess excellent energy absorption characteristics and significant ductility. Coupling beams with small span-to-depth ratios typically utilize diagonal bars {{to resist the}} shear and flexure. The present method for the confinement of the diagonal reinforcement requires closely spaced seismic hoops. This type of coupling beam is difficult to assemble and has several areas of congested steel bars. To simplify construction and ease the steel congestion, it is proposed that the confinement of the diagonal bars be provided by headed bars. Two full-scale coupling beam specimens, one with confining hoops and one with <b>headed</b> <b>bar</b> confinement, were tested under reversed cyclic loading at McGill University. Both specimens contained identical diagonal bars and distributed reinforcement and were constructed from the same batch of concrete. The responses of the specimens were compared {{with respect to the}} general hysteretic responses, including ductility, energy absorption and load sustainability. The specimen using <b>headed</b> <b>bar</b> confinement performed as well as, or better than the specimen with seismic hoops.

This series included: a specimen without any confinement; a specimen with closed ties; a specimen with seismic hoops and crossties; a specimen with closed hoops and headed bars replacing the crossties; and two specimens that had all of the transverse reinforcement replaced by headed bars at two different spacings. Two additional specimens were tested to investigate the effectiveness of headed bars used to retrofit specimens that had no transverse reinforcement. In the retrofit procedure the first step involved drilling horizontal holes through the specimens. Headed bars with one end having a fixed head and the other end having a threaded head were then placed in the holes. After seating the heads on a thin layer of epoxy, the headed bars were slightly prestressed using the turn-of-the-nut method. Using small access holes drilled {{at the end of each}} <b>headed</b> <b>bar,</b> the horizontal holes were filled with structural epoxy. Behavioural comparisons were made for the boundary elements utilizing conventional reinforcement and those with headed bars. It was found that headed bars not only provided a viable solution when used as crossties, but they also offer improved confinement compared to the seismic hoops and crossties used in seismic design. It was also found that headed bars can be used to replace entirely the hoops and crossties with improved confinement.

All of the deep beams had a centre-to-centre spacing of 2000 mm between the two supports, 1000 mm in height, and 350 mm in thickness.
