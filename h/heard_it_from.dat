Returning {{once again}} to a {{reworking}} of the past, this time the supposed murder of director Thomas Ince by Orson Welles's bête noire William Randolph Hearst, The Cat's Meow was a modest critical success but made little money at the box office. Bogdanovich says he was {{told the story of}} the alleged Ince murder by Welles, who in turn said he <b>heard</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> writer Charles Lederer.|$|E
25|$|Skeptical {{scholars}} {{account for}} the many similarities between the Quran and the Jewish and Hebrew Scriptures by saying that Muhammad was teaching what he {{believed to be a}} universal history, as he had <b>heard</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> the Jews and Christians he had encountered in Arabia and on his travels - as well as his exposure to the Hanif tradition by way of his paternal-grandfather, Abdul Muttalib. These scholars also disagree with the Islamic belief that the whole of the Quran is addressed by God to humankind. They note that there are numerous passages where God is directly addressed, or mentioned in the third person, or where the narrator swears by various entities, including God.|$|E

500|$|Meisdalshagen {{was also}} discontented with the {{deregulation}} policy {{to which the}} Labour Party gradually adhered in the 1950s. Trygve Bratteli, on the other hand, {{was viewed as a}} proponent of gradual deregulation. In November 1958 there were rumours that Meisdalshagen would return to the cabinet, probably as Minister of Transport of Communications. Some believed that Meisdalshagen worked together with Karl Trasti to have Trygve Bratteli removed from the cabinet; Trasti would succeed Bratteli as Minister of Finance, according to the rumour, with was told to Bratteli by Meisdalshagen's predecessor as Minister of Agriculture, Rasmus Nordbø. At the time Karl Trasti {{was a member of the}} ad-hoc Paulson Committee, which worked with questions regarding the Ministry of Finance's policy. It was thought that some of the committee's policy proposals could be undesirable to Bratteli, and thereby compromise his minister position. This information was given to Trygve Bratteli from parliamentary secretary Haakon Bingen in January 1959. Binge had <b>heard</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> Egil Lothe, at the time a deputy under-secretary of state in the Ministry of Finance. A friend of Meisdalshagen, Lothe was thereby tied to the alleged intriguers. Jens Haugland noted the scheme of Trasti and Meisdalshagen in his diary, and that this caused Bratteli to keep himself [...] "in the background". This was a part of a broader schism in the party, where Meisdalshagen was the [...] "strongest man in the group" [...] consisting of parliamentarians who deviated in questions of foreign policy: Finn Moe, Trygve Bull, Hans Offerdal, Sverre Løberg and Meisdalshagen. Meisdalshagen had been a supporter of the [...] "Easter Uprising" [...] of 1958, a voicing of dissent within the Labour Party, where the socialist students' association gained the signatures of Labour MPs on a NATO-critical resolution. In Meisdalshagen's obituary, he was likened to Olav Oksvik, another NATO-critical Labour politician.|$|E

In this version of events, Micle is Cătălina and the page Cătălin is Eminescu's one-time friend and colleague, Ion Luca Caragiale; Maiorescu is the Demiurge.|$|E

Harrison told British DJ Nicky Horne in August 1974: [...] "It just blew my mind, because I <b>heard</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> my pop background.

Rather, I will point out the man who I know for a fact began the wrong-doing against the Greeks."

2500|$|Herodotus {{regarded}} the Colchians as an Ancient Egyptian race. Herodotus {{states that the}} Colchians, with the Ancient Egyptians and the Ethiopians, {{were the first to}} practice circumcision, a custom which he claims (without historical proof) that the Colchians inherited from remnants of the army of Pharaoh Sesostris. Herodotus writes, [...] "For it is plain to see that the Colchians are Egyptians; and what I say, I myself noted before I <b>heard</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> others. When it occurred to me, I inquired of both peoples; and the Colchians remembered the Egyptians better than the Egyptians remembered the Colchians; [...] the Egyptians said that they considered the Colchians part of Sesostris' army. I myself guessed it, partly because they are dark-skinned and woolly-haired; though that indeed counts for nothing, since other peoples are, too; but my better proof was that the Colchians and Egyptians and Ethiopians are the only nations that have from the first practised circumcision." [...] Apollonius of Rhodes states that the Egyptians of Colchis preserved as heirlooms a number of wooden tablets, which show, with considerable accuracy, seas and highways.|$|E

2500|$|Schlink's {{problematic}} {{approach toward}} Hanna's culpability in the Final Solution {{has been a}} frequent complaint about the book. Early on {{he was accused of}} revising or falsifying history. In the Süddeutsche Zeitung, Jeremy Adler accused him of [...] "cultural pornography" [...] and said the novel simplifies history and compels its readers to identify with the perpetrators. In the English-speaking world, Frederic Raphael wrote that no one could recommend the book [...] "without having a tin ear for fiction and a blind eye for evil." [...] Ron Rosenbaum, criticizing the film adaptation of The Reader, wrote that even if Germans like Hanna were metaphorically [...] "illiterate", [...] "they could have <b>heard</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> Hitler's mouth in his infamous 1939 radio broadcast to Germany and the world, threatening extermination of the Jews if war started. You had to be deaf, dumb, and blind, not merely illiterate… You'd have to be exceedingly stupid."

2500|$|This epic {{has been}} {{influential}} in the West since it was translated in the 18th century, first by Antoine Galland. Many imitations were written, especially in France. [...] Various characters from this epic have themselves become cultural icons in Western culture, such as Aladdin, Sinbad and Ali Baba. However, no medieval Arabic source has been traced for Aladdin, which was incorporated into The Book of One Thousand and One Nights by its French translator, Antoine Galland, who <b>heard</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> an Arab Syrian Christian storyteller from Aleppo. The popularity of the work may in part be due to greater popular knowledge of history and geography since it was written. This meant that the plausibility of great marvels had to be set at a greater distance of time ("long ago") and place ("far away"). This {{is a process that}} continues, and finally culminates in fantasy fiction having little connection, if any, to actual times and places. A number of elements from Arabian mythology and Persian mythology are now common in modern fantasy, such as genies, bahamuts, magic carpets, magic lamps, etc. [...] When L. Frank Baum proposed writing a modern fairy tale that banished stereotypical elements he felt the genie, dwarf and fairy were stereotypes to avoid.|$|E

Frida Michelson, a Latvian Jew who had been working near Jelgava in a forced labor detail when the synagogues were burned, reported that on her return to Riga, she was told by a friend (who had <b>heard</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> someone else) that the halls and the backyard of the Choral Synagogue were filled with refugees from Lithuania. Perkonkrusts and [...] "other Latvian hangers-on" [...] surrounded the building, trapped the people inside, and set it on fire.
