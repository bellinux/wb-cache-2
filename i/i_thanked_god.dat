2500|$|Kiarostami has {{received}} worldwide acclaim {{for his work}} from both audiences and critics, and, in 1999, he was voted the most important film director of the 1990s by two international critics' polls. Four of his films {{were placed in the}} top six of Cinematheque Ontario's Best of the '90s poll. He has gained recognition from film theorists, critics, as well as peers such as [...] Jean-Luc Godard, Nanni Moretti (who made a short film about opening one of Kiarostami's films in his theater in Rome), Chris Marker, and Ray Carney. Akira Kurosawa said of Kiarostami's films: [...] "Words cannot describe my feelings about them ... When Satyajit Ray passed on, I was very depressed. But after seeing Kiarostami's films, <b>I</b> <b>thanked</b> <b>God</b> for giving us just the right person to take his place." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following his {{re-election}} in the 1945 general election on 5 July, Herbert noted {{of the new}} Parliament that [...] "the surge of Socialism into the House of Commons was something to see." [...] The Labour Party, under Clement Attlee, had won 393 seats, and the Conservatives had won only 197. Herbert said of the newly elected Labour MPs that [...] "Arrogance, I am sorry to say, remained. There was such a concerto of nastiness and hate and imbecile yelling, that <b>I</b> <b>thanked</b> <b>God,</b> many times, that I was an Independent and could be silent without disloyalty." [...] Herbert campaigned {{to ensure that the}} newly elected MPs realised the significance of private members' time. He prepared a number of private member's bills, including on betting reform, legal aid for the poor, a fairer voting system, and the abolition of decree nisi, among other things. However, [...] was unsuccessful in his first attempt to guarantee private members' time – later in the Parliament, it would be restored.|$|E
60|$|Then {{the door}} of the {{anteroom}} opened--and <b>I</b> <b>thanked</b> <b>God</b> for the mercy of that interruption. I whispered a word to her, and in obedience she sprang back, and sank limp and broken on the chair once again.|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is dedicated}} to my fiancée, Angel Liang. Acknowledgements <b>I</b> <b>thank</b> <b>God</b> for His Guidance over the years {{during the course of}} my degree pursuit. With His Love and Mercy, I have been able to find relief during the trials. <b>I</b> <b>thank</b> <b>God</b> that the Microelectronics Research Center at the University of Texas at Austin provides such an excellent research environment. <b>I</b> also <b>thank</b> <b>God</b> that Dr. Ray Chen gave me the opportunity to join this group and to learn under his supervision over the years. <b>I</b> <b>thank</b> <b>God</b> for my committee members, Dr. Michae...|$|R
60|$|I {{believe you}} are right again; and <b>I</b> <b>thank</b> <b>God</b> for his strong head and heart.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>thank</b> <b>God</b> that <b>I</b> can, with a {{full and}} unfeigning heart, utter Amen to this passage.|$|R
6000|$|... “Amen, amen! dear Henry,” {{says the}} lady, {{pressing}} his arm. “I knew it. Mr. Atterbury, of St. Bride’s, who {{was called to}} him, told me so. And <b>I</b> <b>thanked</b> <b>God,</b> too, and in my prayers ever since remembered it.” ...|$|E
60|$|While Blondin was speaking, {{the whole}} scene of the {{previous}} day and of the terrible night rushed in upon my brain like a flood, and <b>I</b> <b>thanked</b> <b>God</b> fervently for my deliverance, while I complied with the man's suggestion and sipped some more tea.|$|E
6000|$|... "We know that," [...] said Crystal, [...] "we {{were stopped}} by them last night, {{after you left}} us. They were after {{the money for the}} usurper, who had sent them, and <b>I</b> <b>thanked</b> <b>God</b> that twenty-five {{millions}} had enriched a common thief rather than the Corsican brigand." ...|$|E
60|$|Sir Mart. Some {{three days}} since, or thereabouts: But, <b>I</b> <b>thank</b> <b>God,</b> <b>I</b> am very weary on't already.|$|R

6000|$|... (He pauses, and {{the light}} of a new thought irradiates his face.) Do you know, Margaret, <b>I</b> <b>thank</b> <b>God</b> it has {{happened}} as it has. What if my usefulness is destroyed? There will be other men--other leaders. I but make way for another. The cause of the people can never be lost. And though I am driven from the fight, I am driven to you. We are driven together. It is fate. Again <b>I</b> <b>thank</b> <b>God</b> for it.|$|R
60|$|Silently I {{followed}} her home. The wind was rising, coming in sudden, angry gusts; {{the storm was}} at hand, but we reached shelter before it broke. Just as I shut our door behind us it smote {{the house with the}} roar of a baffled beast. <b>I</b> <b>thanked</b> <b>God</b> that we were not out in it, following the dream-child.|$|E
6000|$|... "My children, my children, {{which of}} you shall I love best? Which {{of you is}} the more noble? <b>I</b> <b>thanked</b> <b>God</b> this morning for having given me one such son; but to have found that I possess two!" [...] And Mrs. Leigh laid {{her head on the}} table, and buried her face in her hands, while the generous battle went on.|$|E
6000|$|... 'The clear bright {{moon was}} right {{over my head}} as after a while, and after prayer with his friends, I left his room; the quiet splash of the tiny waves on our {{sheltered}} shore, and the little schooner at her anchorage: and <b>I</b> <b>thanked</b> <b>God</b> that one more spirit from among the Melanesian islanders was gone to dwell, we trust, with JESUS CHRIST in Paradise.|$|E
60|$|VALENTINE. No, Miss Livvy, men are {{not like}} that. I am a very average man, but <b>I</b> <b>thank</b> <b>God</b> <b>I</b> am not like that.|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you were}} to bring that to him," [...] she said, {{pointing}} to the bag in my hand, [...] "he would {{not so much as}} touch it. To-morrow I shall go to the Ursulines, and <b>I</b> <b>thank</b> <b>God</b> <b>I</b> shall never see you again. <b>I</b> <b>thank</b> <b>God</b> <b>I</b> shall no longer be your sister. Give Monsieur the bundle," [...] she said to the frightened Andre, who still stood by the hedge; [...] "he may need food and clothes for his journey." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am glad--glad," [...] {{continued}} Ujarak, [...] "that {{you have}} come before <b>I</b> die. <b>I</b> <b>thank</b> <b>God</b> for sending you. I have prayed for this." ...|$|R
60|$|As I {{threw my}} rifle to my shoulder, <b>I</b> <b>thanked</b> <b>God,</b> the ancient God of my ancestors, that I had {{replaced}} the hard-jacketed bullets in my weapon with soft-nosed projectiles, for though {{this was my first}} experience with Felis leo, I knew the moment that I faced that charge that even my wonderfully perfected firearm would be as futile as a peashooter unless I chanced to place my first bullet in a vital spot.|$|E
6000|$|... "There isn't {{much more}} to tell," [...] said Anscombe, [...] "except about yourself. While Heda was away I was kept a {{prisoner}} and watched day and night by Zikali's people who would not let me stir a yard, but otherwise treated me kindly. Then one day at sunrise, or shortly after it, Heda re-appeared and told me all this story, {{for the end of}} which, as you may imagine, <b>I</b> <b>thanked</b> <b>God.</b>|$|E
60|$|Toward morning, I {{must have}} dozed, though {{it seemed to}} me at the time that I had lain awake for days, instead of hours. When I finally opened my eyes, it was daylight, and the girl's hair was in my face, and she was {{breathing}} normally. <b>I</b> <b>thanked</b> <b>God</b> for that. She had turned her head during the night so that as I opened my eyes I saw her face not an inch from mine, my lips almost touching hers.|$|E
6000|$|... "My lot has {{not been}} fortunate. I have consorted long with grief, entered the gloomy {{labyrinth}} of madness, and emerged, but half alive. Yet <b>I</b> <b>thank</b> <b>God</b> that <b>I</b> have lived! <b>I</b> <b>thank</b> <b>God,</b> that <b>I</b> have beheld his throne, the heavens, and earth, his footstool. I am glad that I have seen the changes of his day; to behold the sun, fountain of light, and the gentle pilgrim moon; to have seen the fire bearing flowers of the sky, and the flowery stars of earth; to have witnessed the sowing and the harvest. I am glad that I have loved, and have experienced sympathetic joy and sorrow with my fellow-creatures. I am glad now to feel the current of thought flow through my mind, as the blood through the articulations of my frame; mere existence is pleasure; and <b>I</b> <b>thank</b> <b>God</b> that <b>I</b> live! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I'm not the same; {{for which}} <b>I</b> <b>thank</b> <b>God</b> and you. Only I think I am honester than you. I always {{live up to}} my philosophy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hugh," [...] {{she said}} suddenly, after a pause, [...] "you must {{remember}} one thing,--that {{you can afford}} to be independent. <b>I</b> <b>thank</b> <b>God</b> that your father has provided for that!" ...|$|R
60|$|Advancing {{from the}} high-road to the wood, I saw two persons {{at a little}} {{distance}} from me--a man in the dress of a gamekeeper, and a lad. I was too much agitated to take any special notice of them; I hurried along the path {{which led to the}} clearing. My presentiment had not misled me. There he lay, dead on the scene of the duel, with a blood-stained razor by his side! I fell on my knees by the corpse; I took his cold hand in mine; and <b>I</b> <b>thanked</b> <b>God</b> that I had forgiven him in the first days of my recovery.|$|E
60|$|If {{deprived}} {{of the society of}} my fellow creatures, and of the conveniences of life, I could not but reflect that my forlorn situation was yet attended with some advantages. Of the whole island, though small, I had peaceable possession. No one, it was probable, would ever appear to dispute my claim, unless it were the amphibious animals of the ocean. Since the island was almost inaccessible, at night my repose was not disturbed by continual apprehension of the approach of cannibals or of beasts of prey. Again and again <b>I</b> <b>thanked</b> <b>God</b> on my knees for these various and many benefactions.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{shall have}} it," [...] he {{answered}} grimly. [...] "Listen, then. I began at Thorpe. You were at once rude and kind to me. I {{was a simple}} ass, of course, and you were a mistress in all the arts which go to a man's undoing. It wasn't an equal fight. I struggled a little, but <b>I</b> <b>thanked</b> <b>God</b> that I had an excuse {{to give up my}} work. I came to London, but the poison was working. Every morning before you were up, and every night after dark, I walked round your square--and the days I saw you were the days that counted." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I shall {{break the}} promise I {{made to the}} captain just now," [...] he declared, [...] "and answer that one question, at any rate. <b>I</b> <b>thank</b> <b>God</b> <b>I</b> am not!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{will never}} set the Thames on fire," [...] she had said. [...] "I {{thought at first}} that it would. But {{such as it is}} <b>I</b> <b>thank</b> <b>God</b> for it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'My dear,' said she, 'I am {{sure you}} {{are as good as}} you are pretty, and you shall keep the child: and <b>I</b> <b>thank</b> <b>God</b> for sending you to me!' ...|$|R
6000|$|In {{the body}} of the text, besides, my eye caught, as it passed, some deadly expressions: [...] "Figure {{somewhat}} fleshy," [...] "bright, intellectual smile," [...] "the unconsciousness of genius," [...] "'Now, Mr. Dodd,' resumed the reporter, 'what would be your idea of a distinctively American quality in sculpture?'" [...] It was true the question had been asked; it was true, alas! that I had answered; and now here was my reply, or some strange hash of it, gibbeted in the cold publicity of type. <b>I</b> <b>thanked</b> <b>God</b> that my French fellow-students were ignorant of English; but when I thought of the British--of Myner (for instance) or the Stennises--I think I could have fallen on Pinkerton and beat him.|$|E
60|$|At length our voyage {{came to an}} end, and on {{a certain}} twelfth of June I found myself in the mighty city of London that I had never yet visited, and {{kneeling}} down in the chamber of my inn, <b>I</b> <b>thanked</b> <b>God</b> that after enduring so many dangers and hardships, it had pleased Him to preserve me to set foot again on English soil. Indeed to this hour I count it nothing short of marvellous that this frail body of a man should survive all the sorrows and risks of death by sickness, hunger, battle, murder, drowning, wild beasts, and the cruelty of men, to which mine had been exposed for many years.|$|E
60|$|At {{the foot}} of the short flight of steps that led from the hall to the {{courtyard}} I could hear the slow pacing of the sentry placed there by Ramiro. But unless he were summoned, it was extremely unlikely that the fellow would leave his post, so that, I concluded, I had little to fear from that quarter. I drew back and taking up a position behind Ramiro's chair--a position more favourable to escape in the untoward event of his awaking--I craned forward to read the letter over his shoulder. <b>I</b> <b>thanked</b> <b>God</b> in that hour for two things: that my sight was keen, and that Vitellozzo Vitelli wrote a large, bold hand.|$|E
6000|$|... "And <b>I</b> <b>thank</b> <b>God</b> now," [...] murmured Crystal involuntarily, [...] "that {{the money}} has fallen {{into the hands of}} a common highwayman rather than in those of the scourge of mankind." ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘Well,’ he said, {{when he had}} kissed her, ‘every {{man must}} have his folly; <b>I</b> <b>thank</b> <b>God</b> mine is no worse. Off with you! I have given a child a squib.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, George," [...] he said, [...] "you gave us {{a dreadful}} fright! <b>I</b> <b>thank</b> <b>God's</b> mercy." [...] With that half-mechanical phrase he had flung an {{unconscious}} challenge. Laird looked up whimsically.|$|R
