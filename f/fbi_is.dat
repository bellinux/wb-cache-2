5|$|Despite the {{publicity}} generated by Porteous's {{book and the}} 2011 television documentary, the <b>FBI</b> <b>is</b> standing by its position that Christiansen cannot be considered a prime suspect. It cites a poor match to eyewitness physical descriptions, a level of skydiving expertise above that predicted by their suspect profile, and an absence of direct incriminating evidence.|$|E
5|$|Bavetta was one {{of three}} referees for the Game 6 of the 2002 Western Conference Finals between the Kings and the Lakers. Former referee Tim Donaghy has alleged {{that at least one of}} the referees working this game had {{subjective}} motives for wanting the Lakers to defeat the Kings, and made officiating calls to effectuate this outcome. The NBA has not permitted Bavetta to speak publicly regarding the incident, though The New York Times reported on June 12, 2008 that the <b>FBI</b> <b>is</b> investigating allegations that Game 6 of the 2002 Western Conference Finals had been manipulated to further the series to a seventh game. Even the television announcers commented on how obvious it was that the fix was in.|$|E
5|$|Mulder finds Scully {{underground}} in Antarctica, {{in a large}} facility containing many {{humans in}} ice-like enclosures. He breaks Scully's confinement and uses the vaccine to revive her, but this disrupts the facility and cocooned aliens begin trying to escape. Just after the agents escape to the surface, a huge alien vessel emerges from beneath the ice and travels into the sky. Mulder watches it disappear into the distance as Scully regains consciousness. Some time later, Scully attends a hearing, where her testimony is disregarded and the evidence covered up. She hands over the only remaining proof of their ordeal, the bee that stung her, noting that the <b>FBI</b> <b>is</b> not currently capable of investigating this evidence. Outside, Mulder reads an article that has covered up the domes and crop field in Texas; Scully informs Mulder that she is willing to continue working with him.|$|E

2500|$|While {{attempting}} {{to obscure the}} fact that an <b>FBI</b> informant <b>was</b> in the car, and to ensure that the <b>FBI</b> <b>was</b> not held responsible for permitting their informant to participate in violent acts, without FBI surveillance or backup, the <b>FBI</b> <b>was</b> concerned that they might be held accountable for their informant's (Rowe) role in the death. [...] Rowe had been an informant for the FBI since 1960. [...] The <b>FBI</b> <b>was</b> aware that Rowe had participated in acts of violence during Ku Klux Klan activities. On the day of Liuzzo's death, prior to the shooting, Rowe called his FBI contact and notified him that Rowe and other Klansman were travelling to Montgomery, and that violence was planned.|$|R

5|$|In {{the second}} season, Parrish, {{who appears to}} have been fired from the <b>FBI,</b> <b>is</b> working a desk job as an analyst at the CIA while living with Shelby and {{continuing}} her relationship with Ryan, who later becomes her fiancé. Flashbacks reveal that she is working undercover for the FBI as a CIA recruit. She is tasked with uncovering a rogue faction of the CIA called the AIC. At The Farm, she is joined with other recruits, including Harry Doyle (Russell Tovey), Dayana Mampasi (Pearl Thusi), Sebastian Chen (David Lim), León Velez (Aarón Díaz), Leigh Davis (Heléne Yorke), and Jeremy Miller (David Call). Ryan later joins the other recruits at the site, much to Alex's surprise. Some time after her recruitment, Alex has a meeting with Matthew Keyes and Miranda Shaw. It is revealed that she was recruited by the CIA as part of a covert mission to establish any potential threats within the agency. Ryan is also recruited by the agency for the same mission. Owen Hall (Blair Underwood) is confirmed to be the primary CIA instructor for the training site at TheFarm. In addition, Lydia Hall (Tracy Ifeachor) is later revealed to be another trainer on-site. Alex and the other recruits undergo a series of training assessments in order to become future case officers. After being kicked out of TheFarm by Lydia, Alex goes back to working as an analyst. In addition, she breaks off her engagement with Ryan some time before the 2018 G-20 hostage crisis in New York.|$|E

25|$|The <b>FBI</b> <b>is</b> {{organized}} into functional branches and the Office of the Director, which contains most administrative offices. An executive assistant director manages each branch.

25|$|Although {{many of the}} FBI's {{functions}} are unique, its activities in support of national security are {{comparable to those of}} the British MI5 and the Russian FSB. Unlike the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), which has no law enforcement authority and is focused on intelligence collection overseas, the <b>FBI</b> <b>is</b> primarily a domestic agency, maintaining 56 field offices in major cities throughout the United States, and more than 400 resident agencies in lesser cities and areas across the nation.

25|$|The Uniform Crime Reports (UCR) compile {{data from}} over 17,000 law {{enforcement}} agencies across the country. They provide detailed data regarding the volume of crimes to include arrest, clearance (or closing a case), and law enforcement officer information.

The UCR data only reflect the most serious offense {{in the case of}} connected crimes and has a very restrictive definition of rape. Since about 93% of the data submitted to the <b>FBI</b> <b>is</b> in this format, the UCR stands out as the publication of choice as most states require {{law enforcement agencies}} to submit this data.|$|E
