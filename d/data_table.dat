40|$|MCNPX is a Monte Carlo N-Particle {{radiation}} transport code {{extending the}} capabilities of MCNP 4 C. As with MCNP, MCNPX uses nuclear <b>data</b> <b>tables</b> to transport neutrons, photons, and electrons. Unlike MCNP, MCNPX also uses (1) nuclear <b>data</b> <b>tables</b> to transport protons; (2) physics models to transport 30 additional particle types (deuterons, tritons, alphas, pions, muons, etc.); and (3) physics models to transport neutrons and protons when no tabular data are available or when the data are above the energy range (20 to 150 MeV) where the <b>data</b> <b>tables</b> end. MCNPX can mix and match <b>data</b> <b>tables</b> and physics models throughout a problem. For example, MCNPX can model neutron transport in a bismuth germinate (BGO) particle detector by using <b>data</b> <b>tables</b> for bismuth and oxygen and using physics models for germanium. Also, MCNPX can model neutron transport in UO sub 2, making {{the best use of}} physics models and data tables: below 20 MeV, <b>data</b> <b>tables</b> are used; above 150 MeV, physics models are used; between 20 and 150 MeV, <b>data</b> <b>tables</b> are used for oxygen and models are used for uranium. The mix-and-match capability became available with MCNPX 2. 5. b (November 2002). For the first time, we present here comparisons that calculate radiation transport in materials with various combinations of data charts and model physics. The physics models are poor at low energies (< 150 MeV); thus, <b>data</b> <b>tables</b> should be used when available. Our comparisons demonstrate the importance of the mix-and-match capability and indicate how well physics models work in the absence of <b>data</b> <b>tables...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, we {{investigate}} a knowledge representation formalism {{in the context}} of fuzzy <b>data</b> <b>tables.</b> A possibilistic decision logic incorporating linguistic terms is proposed for representing and reasoning about knowledge in fuzzy <b>data</b> <b>tables.</b> Two applications based on the logic are described. The first is the extraction of fuzzy rules from general fuzzy <b>data</b> <b>tables.</b> In this application, the knowledge in the tables may be made explicit by the formulas of the logic or used implicitly in decision-making. The second is for the fuzzy quantization problem of precise <b>data</b> <b>tables.</b> It {{can be viewed as a}} special case of the first, however, due to some special properties of the problem, a polynomial time rule extraction process can be obtained. Finally, the relationship of the logic with some works for handling uncertain information in <b>data</b> <b>tables</b> is also discussed...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, the {{qualitative}} and quantitative semantics for rules in <b>data</b> <b>tables</b> are investigated from a logical viewpoint. In modern data analysis, knowledge can be discovered from <b>data</b> <b>tables</b> and is usually represented by some rules. However, the knowledge is useful for a human user only when he can {{understand the meaning of}} the rules. This is called the interpretability problem of intelligent data analysis. The solution of the problem depends on the selection of the rule representation language. A good representation language should have clear semantics so that a rule can be effectively validated with respect to the given <b>data</b> <b>tables.</b> In this regard, logic {{is one of the best}} choices. Starting from reviewing the decision logic for <b>data</b> <b>tables,</b> we subsequently generalize it to fuzzy and possibilistic decision logics. The rules are then viewed as the implications between well-formed formulas of these logics and their semantics with respect to precise or uncertain <b>data</b> <b>tables</b> are presented. The validity, support, and confidence of a rule are also rigorously defined in the framework...|$|R
