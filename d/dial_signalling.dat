40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{experimental results}} using an atmospheric backscatter dual CO 2 laser DIAL.

Factors that eventually limit the rate of improvement in the SNR, such as changes in the ratio of the absorption and/or backscatter at the two laser frequencies and background noise, are discussed. In addition, it is noted that DIAL measurements made using hard-target backscatter often show departures from N exp - 1 / 2 dependence improvement in the standard deviation because they are further limited by the combined effects of atmospheric turbulence and speckle (since the relative reproducibility of the speckle pattern on the receiver gives rise to correlations of the lidar signals) ...|$|R

50|$|When the {{telephone}} is on-hook, {{the potential of}} the ring conductor of the local loop is held at a nominal level of -48V DC with respect to the tip conductor, provided by {{the telephone}} exchange or a foreign exchange station (FXS) interface. When the terminal initiates use of the line, it causes current to flow by closing the loop, and this signals the exchange to provide dial tone on the line and to expect <b>dial</b> <b>signals,</b> in form of DTMF digits or dial pulses, or a hook flash. When the loop is opened and current stops flowing for a certain period of time, the subscriber equipment signals that it has finished using the line; the telephone exchange resets the line to an idle state. For alerting an incoming call, the exchange rings the telephone by superimposing an alternating current (AC) signal onto the line of between 40 V and 90 V. The frequency of the signal is 20 Hz. In early exchanges, the ringing power was produced by a hand-cranked generator in the operator console of the exchange.|$|R

50|$|Pulse <b>dialing</b> is a <b>signaling</b> {{technology}} in telecommunications {{in which a}} direct current local loop circuit is interrupted according to a defined coding system for each signal transmitted, usually a digit.

The most common version decodes the digits 1 through 9, as one to nine pulses, respectively, and the digit 0 as ten pulses. Historically, the most common device to produce such pulse trains is the rotary dial of the telephone, lending the technology another name, rotary dialing.|$|R

40|$|For Telephone, Satz focusses on the {{familiar}} {{pitch of the}} electronic <b>dial</b> tone, a <b>signal</b> of live telephonic connection which came into widespread use in 1950 s. Considering the dial tone as an open field of potential communication, Satz talked with electronic music pioneers Laurie Spiegel and Pauline Oliveros on the technological and perceptual implications of composing and listening to sustained musical notes, known as drone music. Excerpts of the conversations, recorded via Skype and IPhone, are played against compositions by the two composers, probing the political, musical and conceptual implications of the drone. Dial Tone Drone features excerpts from ‘Horse Sings From Cloud’ (1975), an accordion score by Pauline Oliveros, and ‘Expanding Universe’ (1974 - 76), a computerised composition by Laurie Spiegel.

40|$|Intracerebral {{hemorrhage}} (ICH) is {{the stroke}} subtype {{with the worst}} prognosis and has no established acute treatment.

Heritability estimates indicate a substantial genetic contribution to risk of ICH in both locations. We report a genome-wide association study of this condition that meta-analyzed data from six studies that enrolled individuals of European ancestry. Case subjects were ascertained by neurologists blinded to genotype data and classified as lobar or nonlobar based on brain computed tomography.

40|$|Dial Tone Operator {{is a sound}} {{installation}} {{offering a}} disorienting experience of the dial tone as spatialized binaural music, composed from vintage recordings of telephone sounds, interwoven with spoken word and song by vocalists Elaine Mitchener and Jennifer Walshe. Early telephone operators were women, "weavers of speech" who provided seductive efficient voices and cheap labour, plugging lines {{in and out of}} a circuit. Automatic dial systems were developed to replace them, reducing costs and ensuring the privacy of the interlocutors. The dial tone plays when the telephone is off-hook, indicating that the system is live and a telephone number can be <b>dialled,</b> a sustained <b>signal</b> of 'lines open', awaiting transmission and connectivity. The composition suggests an experience of tuning in and tuning out, amplifying the multitude of voices in the ether, the meaningful and meaningless messages in a state of constant transmission. Using the dial tone and electric hum as drone music, the piece stimulates the nervous system by providing a constant sound within which the mind can go back and forth (either due to acoustic illusions, binaural effects or shifts in tone). Listeners are invited to immerse themselves in the intimate telephonic headphone encounter at the end of the corridor, lose themselves in the subtleties of a sustained note, and hum along. In addition to vintage headphones the installation features an original switchboard operator mouthpiece, which would have originally served to amplify the operator's voice as a hornlike contraption resting on their sternum. As a telephonic relic, it suggests that a person might speak into it, or that the wall itself is an operator. Composed and scripted by Aura Satz.

40|$|Our {{world is}} not a movie. This is the basic {{assertion}} of this study. Another assertion is that Time {{is more complicated than}} what is supposed by the usual thinking. Some regions of spacetime are sufficiently handled by the current spacetime theories, with their unique { 1 -Time Variable } for each [R 3 + 1]. However, not all regions of space and time are addressed. Therefore, we obligingly explore those regions here. The author’s viewpoint is that the currently assumed time dimensionality, i. e. one, is insufficient for explaining a large class of phenomena. This conviction was affirmed by proving that a set of time variables is not always a set of “reducible” (i. e. mutually dependent) time variables. In general, since local space is measured by a composition of a set of rods having lengths, local time is defined by a composition of a set of generalized clocks having 1 -time variables. The same understanding of the distinction between space variables and time variables is in need of some improvement. It was long ago observed that the standard rods and clocks approach relies on a set of artificial devices rather detached from the usual world. Here, it is taken to attention the more primitive and natural approach via a set of “static elements”(as perceived by observers) versus a set of “mobile elements”. In this study, it is proven that their interactions yield time variables of many kinds. In short, this study is on the nature of time. Given that the argument of this study is the time structure of the observer’s world, we may suppose one primitive “Observed Observer”≡ {OΨ ` } possess- ing intelligence, memories, etc., but wanting of the concepts of space and time insofar as such concepts are sophisticated sensations. Therefore, n a { set o of diligent observers possessing the concepts of space and time } ≡ { O } is supposed to study {OΨ ` }. A necessary preamble is the investigation of {OΨ ` }’s perceptive system. In this study, this investigation is no more than an ordered list of definitions, being outside its argument. {OΨ ` }’s field of observation is a [World Part] ≡ [W]. Here, its description is schematized and simplified. In this mimicking of the animal sensory processes, information 1112 deemed unnecessary is dropped. The structure of this study is as follows. Chapter 1 introduces the set terminology of perceptive systems, including the direct and indirect senses, as well as the mapping between an observer and an observed object (i. e. the observation map). Chapter 2 introduces the terminology of generic observed objects, the subset of “important objects (for the observer) ”, the set of signals with its classes: particle signals and wave signals. h i In Chapter 3, the “Set of Generalized Clocks” ≡ [GC] is introduced as a subset of “World Parts” ≡ h i [W]. A [GC] is defined as a [W] with some noticeable features generating an [N-Time Variable], N ∈ [Z +] (note that the cases wherein N ∈ / [Z +] are left to the reader). By its name, a [GC] is not necessarily a sophisticated device. Also, rarely a [GC] is a practical useful device; Generalized Clocks are introduced here only for defining and clarifying Time. The principal components of a [GC] are succinctly presented in advance. The convenience of a separation by an animal observer of the sensed [Generalized Spacetime] ≡ [GS] into Real Space and Time is elucidated. Accordingly, a theoretical distinction between Real Space variables and Time variables is introduced (more extensively discussed in chapter 4). It becomes necessary, by a “Partition Factor”, to make the distinction between Space variables (let us say that here Space variables are assumed to be Real following Euclid) and Time variables (here assumed to be Imaginary). In Chapter 4, the set of generalized clocks, of which common clocks are a subset, is examined more diffusely. By definition, a [GC] mingles with the ordinary physical systems and is apt to yield a [N-Time Variable]. Some of the arguments are as follows: [GC]’s subclocks; { Set of Levels } i. e. any class or succession of generalized clocks having some common components; main components and eventual components of a [GC]; elementary clocks; simple clocks; main generalized clock. Again and by other words, a formulation of time: a time variable being expressed as the intersection of pointers indexes <b>signals,</b> <b>dial,</b> and correlator. Some types of intersections are: (History defining Intersection) and (Value defining Intersection). To specify a (Time Value of a chosen [GC]) : a { value defining intersecant } acting within a (Value defining Intersection). [Function Time], the time variable being function of a chosen Real space variable, and its classes: [Position Time], [Absolute Travel Time], [Counter Time], [Envelope Time]. It is said that not always and not necessarily a { 1 -Time Variable } is produced by an integration. Subspaces of a [W] (hence, also of a [GC]) are listed: { History }, 13 { Hypothesis }, (State), and (Pointlike Event). In order to simplify this study, an assumption: linear time for { History } and { Hypothesis }. [Quantized Time Variable]. Inversion of a { Time Interval } of a { 1 -Time Variable }. Inversion of a { Time Interval } of a [N-Time Variable]; N > 1. In Chapter 5, two of the many possible time concepts are analyzed and compared, namely [Widespread Time]=[PT], which is of current use in the author’s spacetime interval, and [Natural Time]=[NT], which is more primitive, i. e. more spontaneous to an unlearned observer. Chapter 6 analyzes map correlation, i. e. the correlation of a set of variables, in particular time variables, by a set of maps that the observer knows. In short: map-correlated, feebly map-correlated, and map-uncorrelated time variables are encountered in a [World Part], by a specified observer. An example of a map-uncorrelated time variable is annexed. In an analysis not restricted to a history { World Part } but addressed to a sample space [World Part], an assumed unique { 1 -Time Variable } is generally insufficient for the time-labeling of said [World Part], since not all other time variables are dependent of this chosen independent time variable. On the contrary, a history { World Part } is temporally linear by our definition, but rarely a [World Part] is reducible to a known history { World Part }. Chapter 7 describes how a [Reference Time Variable] may be chosen for a [World Part] and map-correlated to each element of the set of dependent time variables. This must be done cautiously; not in all cases this choice is satisfactory. Ideally, a one-to-one correspondence between any [Time Variable] of the observed [World Part] and the [Reference Time Variable] should be necessary. It is unnecessary to remember that in general the assumption of a suitable [Reference Time Variable], for example a { Reference 1 -Time Variable }, is a practical and useful method. Chapter 8 introduces (Value Defining Intersection) and { value defining intersecant }, which are concerned with the separation of a (Time Value) from a [Time]. Chapter 9 describes how linear velocity, angular velocity, acceleration,... may be considered time variables of generalized clocks. Chapter 10 details how in a set of levels, a change of level yields change of time variable. Restrictions of a [GC], i. e. the assumption of another (similar) [GC] of a lower level, may be achieved by many modalities; the case examined here is by restriction of the [Dial]. Chapter 11 contains examples of generalized clocks and comparisons between them, revealing possible time stops, repetitions of time values, time discontinuities, etc. Chapter 12 describes how by a (Value Defining Intersection), the observer 14 creates a correspondence between the state (GC) of [GC] at his or her disposal and the state (W) of [W] under observation. Necessarily, this state (W) depends on the type of [GC]. The process of specifying (W) by [GC] is explained, as well as the “quality” of the separation of (W) from [W], i. e., time-slicing and time-defining sharpness. As an example, it is shown that a [GC] with an [N-Time Variable], large N, is convenient for a thin Time slicing. In Chapter 13, since a (World Part) state is relative to a specified chosen [GC], it is considered the largest [GC] at the observer’s disposal, namely his or her [Main Generalized Clock]. By this temporally powerful [Cm G], in a (Value Defining Intersection) the (Observer) state may extract a very thinly sliced state (W) of [W]. Obviously, this is a primitively and locally defined state, and therefore it lacks conceptual interpretations. The last section of this chapter discusses two alternate specifications in Real space and time of a (World Part) state. In Chapter 14, a (Pointlike Event) being a (State) of a Real spatial point, is introduced as relative to a given set of generalized clocks (that may be a one-element set) and labeled by a (Time Value) corresponding to them all. Pointlike Event in regards to [C A] does not necessarily correspond to n Pointlike Event in regards to [C B]; instead, it may correspond to an o Interval in regards to [C B]. It is a comparison between [C A] and [C B] that proves the relativity of the concept of (Pointlike Event). In Chapter 15, some specific cases of generalized clocks are introduced to discuss the argument of time dimension. In Chapter 16, the [Generalized Spacetime] introduced here acknowl- edges not only the existence of map-correlated time variables but also the presence of map-uncorrelated and feebly map-correlated time variables. The latter variables are difficult to deal with, lacking or with scarce associative bounds with other time variables; nevertheless, they cannot be theoretically ignored. It is proposed that a [World Part] = [W], suitably referred to a [C `; i T `] where [i T `] is an [N-Time Variable] with N > 1, be mapped onto [Generalized Spacetime] ≡ [GS], with [R 3 + 1] being a subcase of [GS]. The introduction here of [GS] has implications. For example, by the definition of History used in this study, the observer may sense a History { W; i t ` } with a { 1 -Time Variable } and necessarily with its boundary states. However, its development outside { W; i t ` } toward the past and future must not be regarded as a line in any mathematical representation. Another implication here is the approximate symmetry in the observer’s 15 knowledge of past ∆ P [W] and future ∆ F [W], the first joined to an end, the second {{to the other end of}} said history { W; i t ` }. Chapter 17 shows the merging of our proposals with [R 3 + 1] theory. Though some arguments here are well-known, they are included to ensure the continuity of exposition. This chapter’s contributions are listed below: The parametric { 1 -Time Variable } of [R 3 + 1] masks the presence of other 1 -time variables map-connected with it. The { 1 -Time Variable } of any Elementary [GC] is assumed to be associated to either a wave signal or a particle signal. The natural time system [NT] is applied to [R 3 + 1]. { Main Frame } is defined. The (Metric Equation) ≡ (ME) is generalized, that is applied to non-electromagnetic signals.
