They {{moved to a new}} house {{on the other side of}} town on Rose Street, which Williams' mother soon turned into a {{boarding}} house. The house had a small garden, on which they grew diverse crops that Williams and his sister Irene sold around Georgiana. At a chance meeting in Georgiana, Hank Williams met U.S. Representative J.

5|$|Catherine Rottenberg {{argues that}} Larsen’s novella {{is a prime}} example of race and gender norms portrayed in the US. The main characters, Irene and Clare, and their {{struggle}} with their own identification problems in the novel, helps readers understand the difference between gender and race norms. These two central characters are able to pass as white women even though Irene does not fully pass over, and Rottenberg argues the difference between Clare and Irene by re-evaluating the idea of desire/identification. The mis-identification Clare deals with stems from her re-connection with Irene after twelve years of not speaking. Seeing Irene sparked a desire in Clare for her to get back in touch with her African-American culture. Irene's identification trouble is associated with <b>her</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> feel safe and in control in her life, the main reason Irene chooses to pass over only on occasion. Irene doesn't want to put herself into a dangerous situation.|$|E

25|$|Biographers {{differ on}} what {{was the basis for}} this arrangement. Little Leopold was ill in his infancy, and perhaps needed to be kept in Salzburg for this reason, but this does not explain why he was still kept there after his recovery. Another {{possibility}} attributes the arrangement to Marianne's delicate health or <b>her</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> take care of her stepchildren. Biographer Maynard Solomon attributes the arrangement to Leopold's wish to revive his skills in training a musical genius, as he had done with Wolfgang. He also suggests that giving up her son was indicative of Marianne's total subordination to her father's wishes.|$|E

500|$|Kuehn {{described}} Alice as [...] "well-intentioned, canny {{and sometimes}} lovable", but as someone who, at 36, never grew up, {{and is still}} dependent on her parents. Yelin said Alice is [...] "in a state of perpetual adolescence", and <b>her</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> [...] "mother everyone" [...] is [...] "an extreme case of psychological regression or failure to thrive". Greene wrote that Alice's [...] "humanitarianism is ludicrous in her world", and described her as [...] "so furiously at odds with herself" [...] because she is too immature to comprehend what is happening and her actions vary from being helpful to dangerous.|$|E

500|$|... "Do Somethin'" [...] {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} contemporary critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic said {{that along with}} [...] "I've Just Begun (Having My Fun)", they are [...] "two very good previously unreleased tunes". Annabel Leathes of BBC Online commented, [...] "two robust, unreleased tracks [...] suggest, however, that she may still be churning out a few more No.1s before taking time out to sing lullabies to her brood", while Christy Lemire of the Associated Press noted that both songs [...] "provide Britney with further opportunities to proclaim <b>her</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> have fun and be herself, which have been running themes throughout her last two albums". Ann Powers of Blender called [...] "Do Somethin'" [...] "a decent bit of crunk where she raps in a cutesy-poo drawl that suggests she could have nabbed the Dukes of Hazzard sexpot role from Jessica Simpson". Spence D. of IGN considered the song [...] "interesting for its many interpretations, no less".|$|E

She elaborated, [...] "It's the fear of attachment {{and the fear of}} loving something that's bad for you... If you listen to the lyrics, it's like being in love with the bad boy all the time, and you keep going back for more." [...] Gaga added that the fear in [...] "Monster" [...] erupted from <b>her</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> have a stable relationship. [...] "I keep falling in love with the monster...

500|$|Allison Mack characterizes Chloe {{as being}} a [...] "misfit" [...] during the first season; more of [...] "a really smart girl with attitude". She goes on to {{describe}} Chloe as intelligent and independent. Another of Chloe's defining characteristics is <b>her</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> [...] "expose falsehoods" [...] and find the truth in every situation. The character is curious, and wants {{to be honest with}} people. She is always {{trying to make sense of}} the situation. Next to her curiosity, her impulsiveness is a key characteristic that eventually leaves her under the control of Lionel Luthor, when she offers to uncover information on Clark for Lionel. The reason for this betrayal is based on Chloe's love for Clark. As Allison Mack explains, Chloe is so blinded by her love for Clark that she neglects to see all of the mistakes that he makes. It is this unrequited love for Clark that [...] "drives [...] to be as ambitious and as focused as she is".|$|E

Ordynov tries to convince Katerina of <b>her</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> detach herself from Murin physically and psychologically, and believes he has overcome her reluctance to do so when he hears her sing a song of love and freedom. Katerina offers wine to Ordynov and Murin as she considers her choice. Murin uses the language of prediction and psychology to show any choice as futile, as Katerina is predestined by her sex to be a captive of a master and her own grief. Ordynov now fully believes that Murin is a sorcerer and that Katerina is his slave, as she herself believes. Using Murin's argument, he offers to buy Katerina, to effect her liberation. Murin indicates a veiled threat that the price would be bloodshed for both buyer and goods. Fearing a lost cause, Ordynov intends to kill Murin, but fails as a knife falls from his hand and as Katerina falls at her husband's feet.|$|E
