The land between {{the houses and}} the often-foetid Hampton Brook was low-lying enough {{to be subject to}} flood during a combination of spring tide, prolonged rainfall and onshore wind. Either the digging or the <b>filling-in</b> of the oyster company's fishpools created soft, unstable land.|$|E

By the 1930s, both courses were being intensively used, with restaurants located near both clubhouses. Around this time, six holes of the Van Cortlandt course were rebuilt as part of the Henry Hudson Parkway's construction. Due to the Major Deegan Expressway's construction in 1949, there were plans to fill in [...] of the nearby marshlands so new holes could be built. A third of the way into the <b>filling-in</b> project, conservationists and residents called {{for the rest of the}} marsh to be preserved. Two greens were eventually placed on the filled-in marshland.|$|E

2500|$|The band {{came to the}} {{attention}} of the Australian independent music scene and inner city circuit. In January 1984 they recorded [...] "Out of the Unknown", with Younger producing, which was released on Citadel as their first single. Before touring to Melbourne, Lickliter was replaced on bass guitar by Mark Lock (The Phantom Agents, End). In August they recorded a 10-minute psychedelic epic [...] "Mirror Blues" [...] (issued split over a 7" [...] in Australia and intact on 12" [...] in the United Kingdom). Barwick was dissatisfied with Died Pretty and the band tried to recruit Chris Welsh (The 31st, Screaming Tribesmen) but initially could not finance a drum kit for him. With Welsh finally on board, they recorded the extended play (EP), Next to Nothing, released in August 1985. It held a top ten position on the alternative charts for nearly 12 months, starting their career with critical attention and three alternative chart No.1 hits in a row. UK label, What Goes On, compiled their early singles as The Died Pretty on a three-track EP and French label Closer released Next to Nothing in 1985. Three releases achieved 'Single of the Week' in UK music weekly Melody Maker, though the band did not achieve a great deal of popularity or notice by the UK public. The next single [...] "Stoneage Cinderella" [...] appeared in June 1986, taken from their first album Free Dirt, produced by Younger, which followed in August. Free Dirt was released internationally by What Goes On and Citadel. The band went on its first tour to Europe and the United States in October, which included two weeks in France with drummer Andrew Edge <b>filling-in</b> for Welsh, who had broken his foot in London. Died Pretty became a popular attraction in France and Italy.|$|E

60|$|The {{moment his}} back was turned, we both assailed Oscar with the same question. What had passed at the {{interview}} between the rector and himself?

6000|$|I {{was in my}} seventeenth {{year when}} the raid and the capture of John Brown, of Harper's Ferry fame, enjoyed its sharp {{reverberation}} among us, though we were then {{on the other side}} of the world; and I count this as the very first reminder that reached me of our living, on our side, in a political order: I had perfectly taken in from the pages of [...] "Punch," [...] which contributed in the highest degree to our education, that the peoples on the other side so lived. As there was no American [...] "Punch," [...] and to this time has been none, to give small boys the sense and the imagination of living with their public administrators, Daniel Webster and Charles Sumner had never become, for my fancy, members of a class, a class which numbered in England, by John Leech's showing, so many other members still than Lords Brougham, Palmerston and John Russell. The war of Secession, soon arriving, was to cause the field to bristle with features and the sense of the State, in our generation, infinitely to quicken; but that alarm came upon the country like a thief at night, and we might all have been living in a land in which there seemed at least nothing save a comparatively small amount of quite private property to steal. Even private property in other than the most modest amounts scarce figured for our particular selves; which doubtless came partly from the fact that amid all the Albany issue there was ease, with the habit of ease, thanks to our grandfather's fine old ability--he had decently provided for so large a generation; but our consciousness was positively disfurnished, as that of young Americans went, of the actualities of [...] "business" [...] in a world of business. As to that we all formed together quite a monstrous exception; business in a world of business was the thing we most agreed (differ as we might on minor issues) in knowing nothing about. We touched it and it touched us neither directly nor otherwise, and I think our fond detachment, not to say our helpless ignorance and on occasion (since I can speak for one fine instance) our settled density of understanding, made us an unexampled and probably, for the ironic [...] "smart" [...] gods of the American heaven, a lamentable case. Of course even the office and the [...] "store" [...] leave much of the provision for an approximately complete scheme of manners to be accounted for; still there must have been vast numbers of people about us for whom, under the usages, the assault on the imagination from without was much stronger and the <b>filling-in</b> of the general picture much richer. It was exactly by the lack of that <b>filling-in</b> that we--we more especially who lived at near view of my father's admirable example--had been thrown so upon the inward life. No one could ever have taken to it, even in the face of discouragement, more kindly and naturally than he; but the situation had at least that charm that, in default of so many kinds of the outward, people had their choice of as many kinds of the inward as they would, and might practise those kinds with whatever consistency, intensity and brilliancy. Of our father's perfect gift for practising his kind I shall have more to say; but I meanwhile glance yet again at those felicities of destitution which kept us, collectively, so genially interested in almost nothing but each other and which come over me now as one of the famous blessings in disguise.|$|E
60|$|So far, then, as {{mechanical}} science goes I am {{inclined to}} think the coming period will be, {{from the point of}} view of the common man, almost without sensational interest. There will be an immense amount of enrichment and <b>filling-in,</b> but of the sort that does not get prominently into the daily papers. At every point there will be economies and simplifications of method, discoveries of new artificial substances with new capabilities, and of new methods of utilising power. There will be a progressive change in the apparatus and quality of human life--the sort of alteration of the percentages that causes no intellectual shock. Electric heating, for example, will become practicable in our houses, and then cheaper, and at last so cheap and good that nobody will burn coal any more. Little electric contrivances will dispense with menial service in more and more directions. The builder will introduce new, more convenient, healthier and prettier substances, and the young architect will become increasingly the intelligent student of novelty. The steam engine, the coal yard, and the tail chimney, and indeed all chimneys, will vanish quietly from our urban landscape. The speeding up and cheapening of travel, and the increase in its swiftness and comfort will go on steadily--widening experience. A more systematic and understanding social science will be estimating the probable growth and movement of population, and planning town and country on lines that would seem to-day almost inconceivably wise and generous. All this means a quiet broadening and aeration and beautifying of life. Utopian requirements, so far as the material side of things goes, will be executed and delivered with at last the utmost promptness....|$|E
60|$|Three admirable water-colors {{are devoted}} by Mr. Parsons to the {{perceptible}} dignity of Gravetye, in Sussex, {{the dignity of}} very serious gardens, entitled to ceremonious consideration, Few things in England can show a greater wealth of bloom than the wide flowery terrace immediately beneath the gray, gabled house, where {{tens of thousands of}} tea-roses, in predominant possession, have, in one direction, a mass of high yews for a background. They divide their province with the carnations and pansies: a wilder ness of tender petals ignorant of anything rougher than the neighborhood of the big unchanged medley of tall yuccas and saxifrage, with miscellaneous <b>filling-in,</b> in the picture which presents the charming house in profile. The artist shows us later, in September, at Gravetye, the pale violet multitude of the Michaelmas daisies; another I great bunch, or bank, of which half masks and greatly beautifies the rather bare yellow cottage at Broadway. This brings us on to the autumn, if I count as autumnal the admirable large water-color of a part of a garden at Shiplake, with the second bloom of the roses and a glimpse of a turn of the Thames. This exquisite picture expresses to perfection the beginning of the languor of the completed season--with its look of warm rest, of doing nothing, in the cloudless sky. To the same or a later moment belongs the straight walk at Fladbury--the old rectory garden by the Avon, with its Irish yews and the red lady in her chair; also the charming water-color of young, slim apple-trees, full of fruit (this must be October), beneath an admirable blue and white sky. Still later comes the big pear-tree that has turned, among barer boughs, to flame-color, and, in another picture, the very pale russet of the thinned cherry-trees, standing, beneath a grayish sky, above a foreshortened slope. Last of all we have, in oils, December and a hard frost in a bare apple-orchard, indented with a deep gully which makes the place somehow a subject and which, in fact, three or four years ago, made it one for a larger picture by Mr. Parsons, full of truth and style.|$|E
6000|$|I profess {{a certain}} vagueness of remembrance {{in respect to}} the origin and growth of The Tragic Muse, which {{appeared}} in the Atlantic Monthly again, beginning January 1889 and running on, inordinately, several months beyond its proper twelve. If it be ever of interest and profit to put one's finger on the productive germ of a work of art, and if in fact a lucid account of any such work involves that prime identification, I can but look on the present fiction as a poor fatherless and motherless, a sort of unregistered and unacknowledged birth. I fail to recover my precious first moment of consciousness of the idea to which it was to give form; to recognise in it--as I like to do in general--the effect of some particular sharp impression or concussion. I call such remembered glimmers always precious, because without them comes no clear vision of what one may have intended, and without that vision no straight measure of what one may have succeeded in doing. What I make out from furthest back is that I must have had from still further back, must in fact practically have always had, the happy thought of some dramatic picture of the [...] "artist-life" [...] and of the difficult terms on which it is at the best secured and enjoyed, the general question of its having to be not altogether easily paid for. To [...] "do something about art"--art, that is, as a human complication and a social stumbling-block--must have been for me early a good deal of a nursed intention, the conflict between art and [...] "the world" [...] striking me thus betimes as one of the half-dozen great primary motives. I remember even having taken for granted with this fond inveteracy that no one of these pregnant themes was likely to prove under the test more full of matter. This being the case, meanwhile, what would all experience have done but enrich one's conviction?--since if, on the one hand, I had gained a more and more intimate view of the nature of art and the conditions therewith imposed, so the world was a conception that clearly required, and that would for ever continue to take, any amount of <b>filling-in.</b> The happy and fruitful truth, at all events, was that there was opposition--why there should be was another matter--and that the opposition would beget an infinity of situations. What had doubtless occurred in fact, moreover, was that just this question of the essence and the reasons of the opposition had shown itself to demand the light of experience; so that to the growth of experience, truly, the treatment of the subject had yielded. It had waited for that advantage.|$|E
60|$|The {{second time}} I went to Blois I took a {{carriage}} for Chambord, {{and came back}} by the Château de Cheverny and the forest of Russy--a charming little expedition, to which {{the beauty of the}} afternoon (the finest in a rainy season that was spotted with bright days) contributed not a little. To go to Chambord you cross the Loire, leave it on one side and strike away through a country in which salient features become less and less numerous and which at last has no other quality than a look of intense and peculiar rurality--the characteristic, even when it be not the charm, of so much of the landscape of France. This is not the appearance of wildness, for it goes with great cultivation; it is simply the presence of the delving, drudging, economising peasant. But it is a deep, unrelieved rusticity. It is a peasant's landscape; not, as in England, a landlord's. On the way to Chambord you enter the flat and sandy Sologne. The wide horizon opens out like a great potager, without interruptions, without an eminence, with here and there a long, low stretch of wood. There is an absence of hedges, fences, signs of property; everything is absorbed in the general flatness--the patches of vineyard, the scattered cottages, the villages, the children (planted and staring and almost always pretty), the women in the fields, the white caps, the faded blouses, the big sabots. At the end of an hour's drive (they assure you at Blois that even with two horses you will spend double that time), I passed through a sort of gap in a wall which does duty as the gateway of the domain of a proscribed pretender. I followed a straight avenue through a disfeatured park--the park of Chambord has twenty-one miles of circumference; a very sandy, scrubby, melancholy plantation, in which the timber must have been cut many times over and is to-day a mere tangle of brushwood. Here, as in so many spots in France, the traveller perceives that he is in a land of revolutions. Nevertheless its great extent and the long perspective of its avenues give this frugal shrubbery a certain state; just as its shabbiness places it in agreement with one of the strongest impressions awaiting you. You pursue one of these long perspectives a proportionate time, and at last you see the chimneys and pinnacles of Chambord rise apparently out of the ground. The <b>filling-in</b> of the wide moats that formerly surrounded it has, in vulgar parlance, let it down and given it a monstrous over-crowned air that {{is at the same time}} a magnificent Orientalism. The towers, the turrets, the cupolas, the gables, the lanterns, the chimneys look more like the spires of a city than the salient points of a single building. You emerge from the avenue and find yourself at the foot of an enormous fantastic mass. Chambord has a strange mixture of society and solitude. A little village clusters within view of its liberal windows, and a couple of inns near by offer entertainment to pilgrims. These things of course are incidents of the political proscription which hangs its thick veil over the place. Chambord is truly royal--royal in its great scale, its grand air, its indifference to common considerations. If a cat may look at a king, a tavern may look at a palace. I enjoyed my visit to this extraordinary structure as much as if I had been a legitimist; and indeed there is something interesting in any monument of a great system, any bold presentation of a tradition.|$|E

I took {{to the right of}} the Porte de l'Aude, without {{entering}} it, where the old moat has been filled in. The <b>filling-in</b> of the moat has created a grassy level at the foot of the big gray towers, which, rising at frequent intervals, stretch their stiff curtain of stone from point to point. The curtain drops without a fold upon the quiet grass, which was dotted here and there with a humble native, dozing away the golden afternoon. The natives of the elder Carcassonne are all humble; for the core of the Cite has shrunken and decayed, and there is little life among the ruins. A few tenacious laborers, who work in the neighboring fields or in the ville-basse, and sundry octogenarians of both sexes, who are dying where they have lived, and contribute much to the pictorial effect, - these are the principal inhabitants. The process of con- verting the place from an irresponsible old town into a conscious [...] "specimen" [...] has of course been attended with eliminations; the population has, as a general thing, been restored away. I should lose no time in saying that restoration is the great mark of the Cite. M. Viollet-le-Duc has worked his will upon it, put it into perfect order, revived the fortifications in every detail. I do not pretend to judge the performance, carried out on a scale and in a spirit which really impose themselves on the imagination. Few archi- tects have had such a chance, and M. Viollet-le-Duc must have been the envy of the whole restoring fra- ternity. The image of a more crumbling Carcassonne rises in the mind, and there is no doubt that forty years ago the place was more affecting. On the other hand, as we see it to-day, it is a wonderful evocation; and if there is a great deal of new in the old, there is plenty of old in the new. The repaired crenella- tions, the inserted patches, of the walls of the outer circle sufficiently express this commixture. My walk brought me into full view of the Pyrenees, which, now that the sun had begun to sink and the shadows to grow long, had a wonderful violet glow. The platform at the base of the walls has a greater width on this side, and it made the scene more complete. Two or three old crones had crawled out of the Porte Nar- bonnaise, to examine the advancing visitor; and a very ancient peasant, lying there with his back against a tower, was tending half a dozen lean sheep. A poor man in a very old blouse, crippled and with crutches lying beside him, had been brought out and placed on a stool, where he enjoyed the afternoon as best he might. He looked so ill and so patient that I spoke to him; found that his legs were paralyzed and he was quite helpless. He had formerly been seven years in the army, and had made the campaign of Mexico with Bazaine. Born in the old Cite, he had come back there to end his days. It seemed strange, as he sat there, with those romantic walls behind him and the great picture of the Pyrenees in front, to think that he had been across the seas to the far-away new world, had made part of a famous expedition, and was now a cripple at the gate of the mediaeval city where he had played as a child. All this struck me as a great deal of history for so modest a figure, - a poor little figure that could only just unclose its palm for a small silver coin.|$|E

50|$|Though intriguing, {{these results}} cannot be easily {{generalized}} to similar phenomena, {{such as the}} <b>filling-in</b> of illusory contours or the <b>filling-in</b> through artificial scotomata or adapted edges (such as in the Troxler's effect). All these phenomena are indeed similar, and probably rely on similar neural circuitries {{but they are not}} identical. For instance, an obvious difference between <b>filling-in</b> across the blind spot and <b>filling-in</b> of occluded edges is that <b>filling-in</b> across the blind spot is modal (i.e. you literally see the filled-in section), while <b>filling-in</b> across occluders is amodal. <b>Filling-in</b> across the blind spot was found to be different also from <b>filling-in</b> across cortical scotomata in two patients examined by Ramachandran (Ramachandran 1992; Ramachandran, Gregory et al. 1993). In these subjects, some features filled in the scotoma faster than others, and in some circumstances <b>filling-in</b> took some seconds before it was completed (while <b>filling-in</b> across the blind spot is immediate). Together these data suggested that mechanisms for the <b>filling-in</b> of colours, motion and texture can be dissociated and may correspond to processes in higher-order areas that are specialized for these attributes.|$|E
50|$|Contrary to the {{predictions}} of isomorphic <b>filling-in,</b> these authors found an identical response to the stimulus that induced <b>filling-in</b> and to the control stimulus in early visual cortex.|$|E
50|$|There {{is general}} {{agreement}} that edges {{play a central}} role in determining the apparent colour and lightness of surfaces through similar <b>filling-in</b> mechanisms. However, the way in which their influence is performed is still unclear. Two different theories have been put forward to explain the <b>filling-in</b> completion phenomenon.|$|E
50|$|The authors {{recorded}} {{the activity of}} surface- and edge-cells (cells whose receptive fields pointed either to the filled-in surface or to {{the border between the}} disk and the ring) in the visual cortices V1 and V2 while the monkey was performing the <b>filling-in</b> task. The activity of surface-cells correlated with the physical stimulus change in both areas V1 and V2, but not with the perceived colour change induced by <b>filling-in.</b> The activity of edge-cells followed the stimulus contrast when the disk colour changed physically; when the colours were constant, the edge signals also decayed, but more slowly. Together, these data are incompatible with the isomorphic <b>filling-in</b> theory, which assumes that colour signals spread from the borders into uniform regions.|$|E

The process is thought to be analogous to physical diffusion, with contours acting as diffusion barriers for the colour and brightness signals. An alternative hypothesis is that image information is transformed at the cortical level into an oriented feature representation. Form and colour would be derived at a subsequent stage, not as the result of an isomorphic <b>filling-in</b> process, but as an attribute of an object or proto-object.

5000|$|... "Perceptual filling-in", in its {{simplest}} definition, {{is simply}} the <b>filling-in</b> of information that is not directly given to the sensory input. The missing information is inferred or extrapolated from visual data acquired in {{a different part of}} the visual field. Examples of <b>filling-in</b> phenomena include lightness assignment to surfaces from information of contrast across the edges and completion of features and textures across the blind spot, based on the features and textures that are detected in the visible part of the image. In this definition, it is clear that a <b>filling-in</b> process involves a rearrangement of visual information, in which activity in one region of the visual field (i.e. edges) is assigned to other regions (surfaces). In any event, the total amount of information available is not increased, being determined by the retinal input, and any rearrangement of information is useful only if it brings the information contained in the image into a form that is more easily analyzed by our brain.|$|E
50|$|The {{behaviour}} {{of primary}} visual cortex neurons {{seems to be in}} agreement with the one hypothesized by an isomorphic <b>filling-in</b> theory in that they both respond to luminance of the surfaces also in the absence of borders, and their activity is modulated by that of edges far outside the receptive field. Moreover, when the temporal frequency of luminance modulation in the surrounding patches exceeded a threshold value, the induced response disappeared, suggesting that it {{was the result of a}} spreading of activity, taking a finite time to happen, likely explainable in the context of isomorphic <b>filling-in.</b>|$|E
50|$|There are {{at least}} three {{different}} kinds of experiments whose results support the idea that a real spreading of neural activity in early visual areas is the basis for <b>filling-in</b> of visual information.|$|E

5000|$|A similar 'sensory fading,' or <b>filling-in,</b> {{can be seen}} of a fixated {{stimulus}} {{when its}} retinal image is made stationary on the retina (a stabilized retinal image). Stabilization {{can be done in}} at least three ways.|$|E
