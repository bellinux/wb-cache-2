5|$|Due to pancreatitis, Crozier {{played only}} 58 out of 70 {{games for the}} Red Wings in 1966–67. His numbers were <b>down</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> won only 22 games and {{recorded}} a 3.35 GAA. The Red Wings missed the playoffs. After another bout of pancreatitis {{at the beginning of}} the 1967–68 season, Crozier announced his retirement due to stress and depression. His announcement was short-lived as after six weeks, he returned to hockey. Before re-joining the Red Wings, Crozier played five games with the Fort Worth Wings of the Central Professional Hockey League (CPHL) as conditioning. Crozier spent two more seasons on a mediocre Red Wings team before being traded to the newly formed Buffalo Sabres in 1970.|$|E

5|$|In 1972, Duncan Wood, the BBC's Head of Comedy, {{watched a}} comedy on {{television}} called The Misfit. Impressed by writer Roy Clarke's ability to inject both comedy and drama into the sitcom, Wood offered Clarke {{the opportunity to}} write a sitcom. Clarke nearly turned the job <b>down</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> felt that the BBC's idea for a programme about three old men was a dull concept for a half-hour sitcom. Instead, Clarke proposed that the men should all be unmarried, widowed, or divorced and either unemployed or retired, leaving them free to roam around like adolescents {{in the prime of}} their lives, unfettered and uninhibited.|$|E
5|$|The new Chief of Staff, General Malin Craig offered Eichelberger {{command of}} the 29th Infantry, the {{demonstration}} regiment based at Fort Benning, Georgia. Eichelberger turned this <b>down,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> had been away from the infantry for many years, and some infantry officers might be jealous. Instead, he accepted {{command of the}} 30th Infantry, a less prestigious unit stationed at the Presidio of San Francisco, but there were still officers who resented someone attaining command of a regiment {{at the age of}} 52. Before departing, he took a brief course at the Infantry School at Fort Benning to reacquaint himself with the infantry. As part of the 3rd Infantry Division, the 30th Infantry took part in a series of major training exercises over the next two years.|$|E
5|$|England batted {{first to}} score 362, {{but when the}} West Indies batted, Ganteaume and his opening partner, George Carew shared a {{partnership}} of 173. Once more, Ganteaume was criticised for slow batting, although he later suggested that he had concentrated on scoring singles to allow his in-form partner to face the bowling. On the third day, he carried on batting to reach his century, {{the first in a}} Test match by a Trinidadian in Trinidad. The innings took around 270 minutes, but he slowed <b>down</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> neared three-figures, and the West Indies' captain sent out a note asking the batsmen to score faster. Other batsmen also batted slowly, and Ganteaume later claimed that England used negative, run-saving tactics to slow the scoring rate. He did not bat in the second innings, when the West Indies needed to score runs quickly in an unsuccessful attempt to win the game. The match was drawn, having been earlier interrupted by rain which cut the playing time, but in the knowledge that quick scoring was vital, Ganteaume's slow batting adversely affected the West Indies' chances of victory.|$|E

5|$|In most {{variations}} Black has {{the opportunity}} to play Bb4+, a move whose advisability depends on White's possible answers. If White blocks the check with Nb1–c3 then Black should capture the knight only if White is forced to take back with the pawn, after which the isolated, doubled pawns are a positional advantage for Black that fully compensates the loss of the bishop pair, and even the gambitted pawn. Due to its immunity to pawn attacks, the c5-square may be used by Black as a stronghold for his pieces. Piece exchanges can be good for Black even if he is a pawn <b>down,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> can hope to exploit the crippled pawn structure in the ending. On the other hand, if White can recapture with a piece, the trade on c3 typically concedes the bishop pair for insufficient compensation.|$|E
5|$|Jake and Elwood begin {{tracking}} down {{members of the}} band. Five of them are playing a deserted Holiday Inn lounge, and quickly agree to rejoin. Another turns them <b>down</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> is the maître d' at an expensive restaurant, but the brothers refuse to leave the restaurant until he relents. On their way to meet the final two band members, the brothers find the road through Jackson Park blocked by an American Nazi Party demonstration on a bridge; Elwood runs them off the bridge into the East Lagoon. The last two band members, who now run a soul food restaurant, rejoin the band {{against the advice of}} one's wife. The reunited group obtain instruments and equipment from Ray's Music Exchange in Calumet City, and Ray, as usual, takes an IOU.|$|E
5|$|The prologue {{depicting}} Indiana in {{his youth}} inspired Lucas to create The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles television series, which featured Sean Patrick Flanery as the young adult Indiana and Corey Carrier as the 8- to 10-year-old Indiana. The 13-year-old incarnation played by Phoenix in the film {{was the focus of}} a Young Indiana Jones series of young adult novels that began in 1990; by the ninth novel, the series had become a tie-in to the television show. German author Wolfgang Hohlbein revisited the 1912 prologue in one of his novels, in which Indiana encounters the lead grave robber—whom Hohlbein christens Jake—in 1943. The film's ending begins the 1995 comic series Indiana Jones and the Spear of Destiny, which moves forward to depict Indiana and his father searching for the Holy Lance in Ireland in 1945. Spielberg intended to have Connery cameo as Henry in Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008), but Connery turned it <b>down</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> had retired.|$|E

5|$|Zombi 2 {{serves as}} a sequel to Zombi, a re-edited Italian release of George A. Romero's 1978 film Dawn of the Dead; Zombi had been edited by Dario Argento and given a new score by the Italian band Goblin, and proved {{successful}} upon its release in Italy. As Italian copyright law allows any film to be marketed as a sequel to another work, the film was quickly greenlit and financed by producer Fabrizio De Angelis. Enzo G. Castellari was offered to direct Zombi 2, but turned it <b>down</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> did not feel {{he would be the}} right director for a horror film. Director Lucio Fulci was De Angelis' second choice for the project, and was hired based on his handling of violent scenes in his previous films Sette note in nero and Non si sevizia un paperino.|$|E

25|$|Zimbabwe crawled {{to their}} fourth loss of over 100 {{runs in the}} last five matches, as they were bowled out for their third-lowest all out score in ODIs by a rampant Irfan Pathan. It {{followed}} a promising bowling effort, as India had been restricted to 121 for 4 after 35 overs – Mohammad Kaif tied <b>down,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> could only make 65 despite having faced 122 balls. Earlier, Heath Streak had dismissed Venugopal Rao caught behind for a three-ball duck.|$|E

He was awarded his wings and commission posthumously.|$|E
25|$|Caroline Quentin was Renwick's {{first choice}} for Maddy Magellan, but the casting of Creek proved {{something}} of a problem. Renwick had wanted Nicholas Lyndhurst, but he turned it down. Rik Mayall was also offered the part, but was, at the time, busy with stage work (he would later guest-star in a Christmas special of the series). Hugh Laurie showed {{a great deal of}} interest and agreed to take the part, but later turned it <b>down</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> could not figure out Creek's motivations for investigating the cases Maddy involves him in, especially when he shows so much reluctance in some of the episodes.|$|E
25|$|Ian McKellen as Gandalf the Grey: an Istari wizard {{and mentor}} to Frodo. Sean Connery was {{approached}} for the role, {{but did not}} understand the plot, while Patrick Stewart turned it <b>down</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> disliked the script. Before being cast, McKellen had to sort his schedule with 20th Century Fox as there was a two-month overlap with X-Men. He enjoyed playing Gandalf the Grey more than his transformed state in the next two films, and based his accent on Tolkien. Unlike his on-screen character, McKellen did not spend much time with the actors playing the Hobbits; instead he worked with their scale doubles.|$|E
