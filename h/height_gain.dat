25|$|Growth {{retardation}} may occur, as <b>height</b> <b>gain</b> may {{slow and}} can stop completely with severe weight loss or chronic malnutrition. In such cases, provided that growth potential is preserved, height increase can resume and reach full potential after normal intake is resumed. Height potential is normally preserved if the duration {{and severity of}} illness are not significant or if the illness is accompanied by delayed bone age (especially prior to a bone age of approximately 15 years), as hypogonadism may partially counteract the effects of undernutrition on height by allowing for a longer duration of growth compared to controls. Appropriate early treatment can preserve height potential, and may even help to increase it in some post-anorexic subjects, due to factors such as long-term reduced estrogen-producing adipose tissue levels compared to premorbid levels. In some cases, especially where onset is before puberty, complications such as stunted growth and pubertal delay are usually reversible.|$|E
25|$|Anorexia nervosa causes {{alterations}} {{in the female}} reproductive system; significant weight loss, as well as psychological stress and intense exercise, typically results in a cessation of menstruation in women who are past puberty. In patients with anorexia nervosa, there is a reduction of the secretion of gonadotropin releasing hormone in the central nervous system, preventing ovulation. Anorexia nervosa can also result in pubertal delay or arrest. Both <b>height</b> <b>gain</b> and pubertal development are dependent on the release of growth hormone and gonadotrophins (LH and FSH) from the pituitary gland. Suppression of gonadotrophins in people with anorexia nervosa has been documented. Typically, growth hormone (GH) levels are high, but levels of IGF-1, the downstream hormone that should be released in response to GH are low; this indicates a state of “resistance” to GH due to chronic starvation. IGF-1 is necessary for bone formation, and decreased levels in anorexia nervosa contribute {{to a loss of}} bone density and potentially contribute to osteopenia or osteoporosis. Anorexia nervosa can also result in reduction of peak bone mass. Buildup of bone is greatest during adolescence, and if onset of anorexia nervosa occurs during this time and stalls puberty, low bone mass may be permanent.|$|E

50|$|In {{support of}} the {{nutritional}} hypothesis, it is known that, in the United States, the average height before 1900 was about 10 cm (∼4 inches) shorter than it is today. Possibly related to the Flynn effect is a similar change of skull size and shape during the last 150 years. Though the idea that brain size is unrelated to race and intelligence was popularized in the 1980s, studies continue to show significant correlations. (Note, however, that size isn't everything—or maybe anything significant at all. For example, the overall size and asymmetrical shape of Albert Einstein's brain were normal; whereas the prefrontal, somatosensory, primary motor, parietal, temporal and occipital cortices were extraordinary.)A Norwegian study found that <b>height</b> <b>gains</b> were strongly correlated with intelligence gains until the cessation of <b>height</b> <b>gains</b> in military conscript cohorts {{towards the end of}} the 1980s. Both height and skull size increases probably result from a combination of phenotypic plasticity and genetic selection over this period. With only five or six human generations in 150 years, time for natural selection has been very limited, suggesting that increased skeletal size resulting from changes in population phenotypes is more likely than recent genetic evolution.|$|R

40|$|Objective: A {{description}} {{is made of}} transcrestal sinus lift using the sinus balloon technique, evaluating the bone height achieved and implant success one year after prosthetic loading. Material and method: Between January and July 2007, transcrestal sinus lift using the sinus balloon technique for dental implant placement {{was carried out in}} 6 patients. A panoramic X-ray study and maxillary computed tomography scan were carried out before the operation, in order to discard possible sinus pathology. During the intervention, the integrity of the sinus membrane was evaluated using a Medi Pack Pal endoscope (Farol Store and Co., Tuttlingen, Germany), and the intraoperative complications were analyzed. The dental implants were placed in the same surgical step in the presence of 3 mm or more of residual bone. Following the operation, panoramic X-rays were used to assess the bone <b>height</b> <b>gained.</b> One year after prosthetic loading, the implant success rate was determined based on the criteria of Buser. Results: One patient was excluded due to Schneider's membrane perforation as confirmed by endoscopy. Trans-crestal sinus lift was carried out in 5 males {{with a mean age of}} 41. 6 years (range 27 - 51), without antecedents of sinus disease. There were no intraoperative complications. In four patients the implants were placed simultaneous to sinus lift, while in another case implant placement was postponed due to insufficient remaining bone <b>height.</b> The mean <b>gain</b> in <b>height</b> after the operation was 8. 7 mm. One year after prosthetic loading, the implant success rate was 100 %. Conclusions: Transcrestal sinus lift using the sinus balloon technique is a minimally invasive procedure. In 5 patients the bone <b>height</b> <b>gained</b> proved sufficient to allow implant placement even in the presence of 3 mm of residual bone. © Medicina Oral S. L...|$|R
