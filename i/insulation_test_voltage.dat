40|$|On-site {{testing has}} often been {{requested}} by the utilities following installation of new HV cables, and also to check the condition of HV power transformers suspected of a damaged insulation. Specialized equipment for on-site tests has to withstand off-road transportation, to pass under road-bridges, be equipped with its own power source, and what is most difficult, to make measurements at HV substations which are notorious for intense electromagnetic interference. At present, a HV resonant test set-up with the partial discharge (PD) measuring instrument, and the C-tgd bridge with built-in <b>test</b> <b>voltage</b> source are {{the most frequently used}} mobile test equipment.

40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} {{fundamental}} investigations of partial discharge behaviour of typical defects of PE/XLPE-insulated medium <b>voltage</b> cables at <b>test</b> <b>voltages</b> with variable shape and frequency.
