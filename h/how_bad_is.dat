50|$|Ralph Gibson LJ {{held that}} the Tribunal was {{entitled}} to find the age requirement discriminatory so long as proof of disparate impact was shown. However, the correct pool for comparison was all male and female graduates with necessary experience. So the Employment Appeal Tribunal was upheld. Further, the Tribunal was right to construe ‘justifiable’ in SDA 1975 section 1(1)(b)(ii) to mean an objective balance between the condition’s discriminatory effect the employer’s reasonable needs. But the Tribunal had gone about the balancing exercise wrongly. He said one must look both at the quantitative effect and the qualitative effect (how many are adversely affected and <b>how</b> <b>bad</b> <b>is</b> the effect is).|$|E

5000|$|... "Heavy" [...] {{received}} generally negative {{reviews from}} critics, with complaints generally {{centered around the}} band's move from nu metal to a pop-oriented sound. Anna Gaca of Spin found the song to be a failed attempt to stay relevant against current popular rap rock bands like Twenty One Pilots, concluding that [...] "So: <b>How</b> <b>bad</b> <b>is</b> [...] "Heavy"? It's {{not as bad as}} you'd think. It will annoy you no more and no less than any other blowout pop duet else you're likely to hear on the radio while you're at the gym or the supermarket or something. It's fairly astonishing to see Linkin Park bend their knee so shamelessly for a taste of the charts, but those are the rules of the game." [...] Emmy Mack of Music Feeds was similarly negative, noting the irony of naming the track [...] "Heavy" [...] when the song sounded like [...] "a dance-pop duet featuring Chester doing a really bad Twenty One Pilots impersonation and trading verses with a random guest pop vocalist."

Although 15 medical specialists were flown in to treat the victims, some children were moved to hospitals in other cities {{in the state of}} Jalisco which had doctors with specialties in children's burns. One boy could not be moved for further treatment as he has been declared brain dead. Two children were taken to a Shriner's burn hospital in Sacramento, California, USA, for treatment. [...] "A lot of it is how deep the burn is and where it's located and <b>how</b> <b>bad</b> <b>is</b> the smoke inhalation," [...] said Dr. Tina Palmieri, assistant chief of burns for the hospital. She reported that there was only a 50 per cent chance of survival for one of the three-year-old girls who sustained burns to over 80 per cent of her body. [...] This girl was accompanied by her father and arrived in California by Mexican military transport. Her mother, who had herself been working in the day care center, was taken to a Ciudad Obregón hospital after pulling her daughter and several other children out of the fire. [...] The second patient, a young boy, began a series of skin graft surgeries on Sunday June 7, reported Dr. David Greenhalgh, chief of burn treatment at the Sacramento hospital. Both of these patients were listed in critical condition, monitored for infection, and unable to talk because breathing tubes had been inserted.|$|E
5000|$|Smurfette's {{original}} artificial nature arose {{again in}} the sequel episode, [...] "Smurfette Unmade." [...] In this story, Gargamel tells his apprentice Scruple (who was an added character by this time) about how he regrets creating her, he comments on <b>how</b> <b>bad</b> <b>is</b> that Gargamel can't turn her evil again, and he remembers there is a way. They kidnap her and prepare a spell which initially doesn't seem to work and the Smurfs take her home. When Scruple turns {{on the next page}} of Gargamel's spell book, the bad guys realize the spell is complete but its effects won't become apparent until the next full moon's midnight, which happened to be that very night. The effects includes Smurfette changing back to her original appearance and malicious personality before she could consult Papa Smurf on the matter. Thus changed into her original form, Smurfette manages to hide by concealing her black hair with a wig (in spite of her clothes and shoes being a dead giveaway) but the Smurfs eventually learn the truth when she arranges for the Smurfs to be captured. Papa Smurf said he can't repeat the spell that had initially turned her good. However, just as Gargamel is about to get Baby Smurf to test his gold making potion (over Smurfette's objection), Smurfette's conscience rebels and she changes back into blond-haired Smurfette. Gargamel and Scruple attempt to capture her to prevent themselves from losing again but Smurfette destroys the potions and sends the Smurfs' arch enemies into a tree. They all return home with Papa Smurf guessing that Smurfette's Smurf nature is too strong to ever be fully removed.|$|E
