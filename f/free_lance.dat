5|$|The Bessy comics {{were also}} {{published}} in Felix, a German comic magazine by Bastei Verlag. From 1965 on, {{they wanted to}} publish a complete new story every month, a rhythm they increased to twice a month in 1966. Unable to produce so fast, Vandersteen had to expand his Studio considerably. Led by Karel Verschuere, a team of some ten young artists mass-produced the comics, which were of considerable lower quality. The {{most important of these}} artists were Frank Sels and Edgar Gastmans, while many stories were produced by Daniël Janssens. When in late 1967 Verschuere quit, {{and at the same time}} Bastei increased the rhythm again, now to one complete comic a week, the Studio was disbanded and Sels and Gastmans started to work on a <b>free</b> <b>lance</b> basis. The next year, they decided to go behind Vandersteen's back and to sell directly to the Germans. Vandersteen then had to reorganize the Bessy Studio and hired Jeff Broeckx. The Studio continued until 1985, with artists like Patrick van Lierde, Ronald Van Riet, Eugeen Goossens, and Walter Laureyssens. It produced more than 900 Bessy-comics.|$|E

25|$|Fredericksburg's daily {{newspaper}} is The Free Lance–Star. The <b>Free</b> <b>Lance</b> {{was first published}} in 1885, and competed with two twice-weekly papers in the city during the late 19th century, the Fredericksburg News and The Virginia Star. While the News folded in 1884, the Star moved to daily publication in 1893. In 1900, the two companies merged, with both newspapers continuing publication until 1926, when they merged as a single {{daily newspaper}} under the current title. Until June 19, 2014, the Free Lance–Star was owned and operated by members of the Rowe family of Fredericksburg. At that time, Sandton Capital Partners purchased the paper. On December 31, 2015 the newspaper and associated website were purchased by Berkshire Hathaway′s BH Media Group. Fredericksburg.Today, an online hyperlocal news site began operation following the 2014 bankruptcy of The Free Lance–Star.|$|E

Initially he worked as a <b>free</b> <b>lance</b> writer for various newspapers. However, in 1951 he lost his job due to his past membership in the Home Army. His wife was given a choice of either divorcing him, or also losing her job. She refused, and they both became unemployed. As a result, Iringh tried to support his family, even though by this time he was quite ill, by taking photographs and selling them on the street to passers-by. In 1956 he started to work for the Association of Czechs and Slovaks in Poland although he was soon once again fired on the basis of an absurd accusation that he was plotting to separate the Orava and Polish Spisz regions from Poland and join them to Czechoslovakia.|$|E

Naomi is trying her best to convince her possible new client. She is also faced with a problem when TA, Naomi's physics class partner, informs her that she has to pass his physics class, if she wants to pass the sophomore year. It turns out the TA is hurt, as Naomi has never invited him to any of the parties she has thrown in the past year. Later on, Naomi decides to help Liam make Vanessa’s party a success, so she can invite the TA to the party, and score a few brownie points. At the party, Naomi tells TA that she would rather work hard to get good marks on her project, than him favoring her in any way. In No Good Deed, Naomi decides to plan Mitchell Nash's daughters sweet sixteen birthday party, after a previous client told her she would not hire her without her having any professional experiences.|$|E

Shiller drove a cab, worked as a waitress and <b>free</b> <b>lance</b> photographer, and got involved in radical politics. With one of Chicago's most controversial political organizers, Walter [...] "Slim" [...] Coleman, Shiller helped organize the Intercommunal Survival Committee, a sort of white support arm of the Black Panther Party. The committee evolved into the Heart of Uptown Coalition, a political and social service organization steeped in the rhetoric of Marxism; [...] "comrades" [...] were expected to organize [...] "cadres." [...] "We must have the frame of mind that as revolutionaries we have (to) {{be able to solve}} any problem that comes our way..." [...] Shiller said. The Coalition provided an array of programs geared toward providing essential services for the poor, including medical clinics for pregnant women, mothers and young children; a legal aid clinic, food pantries and distributing clothes and meals to the poor. For decades Shiller and her allies worked to preserve Uptown as the last North Side lakefront neighborhood south of Rogers Park that is home to a significant population of low income households.|$|E

2500|$|Henry David Gray {{writes on}} the {{complexity}} of views that readers have taken while contemplating the sonnets. There are the Southamptonites who date the sonnets from 1592–1596, and believe the first 125 sonnets to be in chronological order, the dark lady being Elizabeth Vernon, and the Rival Poet to be Drayton. Gray continues with the next group of critics being Pembrokists, dating the sonnets from 1598 to 1603, the dark lady being Mary Fitton, and the Rival Poet being Chapman. Gray believes, following with Sir Sidney Lee, that the sonnets are literary exercises, {{it is important to}} figure who the dark lady is, that W.H. is not the youth addressed in the first 125 sonnets, the sonnets are in no chronological order, and he had no idea who the rival poet was. Gray proclaims his view, [...] "I am a <b>free</b> <b>lance</b> among the Sonnets' critics with a special set of conjectures all my own; though I do agree with Butler that that W.H. is William Hughes, with Acheson that the Dark Lady is Mistress Davanant, and with Montmorency that the Rival Poet is Spenser." ...|$|E
2500|$|Campana {{composed}} {{at least}} two patriotic songs during the 1848–1849 Italian revolutions. One was set to Arcangelo Berettoni's poem [...] "La costituente italiana" [...] (The Italian Constituent). The other, [...] "Inno nazionale" [...] (National Hymn) set to a text by Franco Carrai, became the most frequently sung song in Livorno at the time. He also composed a chorus to accompany a dramatic allegory performed at the Teatro degli Avvalorati in 1847 to celebrate Leopold II, Grand Duke of Tuscany granting Livorno its own Civil Guard. Between 1846 and 1854, Francesco Lucca, the firm which had commissioned Verdi's early opera Il corsaro, published seven collections of Campana's songs. Riccordi was to publish another nineteen between 1851 and 1873. The Riccordi collections were variously entitled Souvenirs, Pensieri, Echi, Sospiri, or Ricordi (Souvenirs, Thoughts, Echoes, Sighs, Memories), with each one devoted to a different place which had a personal significance in Campana's life, including Naples, Venice, Rome, Paris, Bagni di Lucca, and Lake Como. The majority of Campana's songs were set to Italian texts, some written by the composer himself such as [...] "Quando da te lontano!" [...] (When I Am Far From You!). However, he also set texts by English writers which became popular both as concert pieces and as parlor songs. His most well-known collaborators in this genre were Henry Brougham Farnie (e.g. [...] "Speak to Me" [...] and [...] "The Scout: A Trooper's Ditty") and Henry Hersee (e.g. [...] "A <b>Free</b> <b>Lance</b> Am I: Or the Soldier of Fortune" [...] and [...] "The Little Gipsy"). Another popular concert piece in England was Campana's [...] "Voga, voga, O marinaro" [...] (Row, Row, O Sailor), a barcarole for three female voices. It was later mentioned in Eleanor Farjeon's 1941 novel, Miss Gransby's Secret, a satire on the sensibilities of the Victorian era.|$|E
