50|$|It {{is located}} in the south central area of the tehsil to the south of Murree. According to the 1998 census of Pakistan it had a {{population}} of 9,945. The major tribes of the Union Council include the Behramals and the Parhals with such distribution that the village Musirai which located in south of Murree city houses the parhals along with the villages of Mohra, Batnara and Paghaan (in south of Jhika Gali), whilst the villages of Bara <b>Hoter,</b> Sumbal Bia, Phaphril, Ghora and Saen are inhabited by behramals. The Union Council has a scenic beauty of a dale, as the River Soan bisects the two population hubs. There are behramal majority areas in the east of the river and parhal's majority areas in the west of the river. The literacy rate in Union Council Musiari is substantial, and the rate is quite healthy in girls too. One High School for Boys, located in the village of Phaphirl, is meeting the education needs of the populace, it does not suffice albeit. The growing population of the area demand a Higher Secondary School and the existing School needs to be upgraded for the purpose. There are a number of middle and primary schools for boys and girls in the area, but a girls high school is still a remote possibility that eludes the desirous population for decades. The affluent parents prefer sending their children to better English medium schools in the Murre City.The road net has substantially increased with the construction of Murree-Islamabad express way. However, the remote areas still roost in the dilapidated road conditions that aggravate each year owing to flashing monsoons.|$|E
40|$|Grapes and grapevines are {{prominent}} motifs {{in the vast}} range of Jewish art dating back to Antiquity. In recent decades, there has been growing interest in creating contemporary Jewish ceremonial textiles for the home and synagogue, as well as textile art on Jewish themes. The grape and vine motif have often been included in these new works. A brief survey of Jewish sources: Grapes and wine are highly important symbols in Jewish tradition and ritual and {{date back to the}} 1 st century. A magnificent golden vine that hung over the inner portal of the Second Temple was described by Josephus and the Mishnah. ! The Hasmoneans and Bar Kochba followers struck a cluster of grapes on their victory coins {{as a symbol of the}} fertility of the country. This same emblem appears slightly later as a decoration in mosaic floors of synagogues. In literature of the period, the vine is prominent as a Messianic symbol (Enoch, 32 : 4). There is a suggestion that the fruit of the Tree of Wisdom was like bunches of grapes on a vine. Noah planted a vine after the Flood. The importance of the vine is attested to by the Bible 2 ̆ 7 s many synonyms for its branches: baddim, banot, daliyyot, zalzallim, zemorah, <b>hoter,</b> yonek, kannah, matteh, netishot nezer, anat, porah, kezirim, shelalot, sarigun and sorek. Over 40 expressions connected with viticulture are mentioned in the Bible and Talmudic literature...|$|E

These ignimbrites have a similar compositions, raising the question of whether they are geneticaly related. The Batur Ignimbrite- 1 (BI- 1) is crystal poor, containing rhyodacitic (68 - 70 wt % SiO 2), white to grey pumices and partly welded and unwelded. The overlying Batur Ignimbrite- 2 (BI- 2) is a homogeneous grey to black dacitic pumices (64 - 66 wt % SiO 2), unwelded and densely welded (40 - 60 % vesicularity), crystal and lithic rich. Phase equilibria indicate that the Batur magma equilibrated at temperatures of 1100 - 1300 oC with melt water contents of 3 - 6 wt%. The post-eruptive Batur magma was cooler ( 6 wt % H 2 O). A pressure of 20 kbar is infered from mineral barometry for the Batur magma chamber. Magmatic chamber model is one in which crystals and melt separate from a convecting Batur magma by density differences, resulting in a stratified magma chamber with a homogeneous central zone, a crystal-rich accumulation zone near the walls or base, and a buoyant, melt-rich zone near the top. This is consistent with the estimated magma temperatures and densities: the pre-eruptive BI- 1 magma was <b>hoter</b> (1300 oC) and more volatile rich (6 wt % H 2 O) with density 2. 25 g/cm 3 than the BI- 2 magma (1200 oC; 4 wt % H 2 O) in density was higher (2. 50 g/cm 3). Batur melt characteristics and intensive parameters are consistent with a volatile oversaturation-driven eruption. However, the higher H 2 O content, high viscosity and low crystal content of the BI- 1 magma imply an external eruption trigger. </p...|$|E
