40|$|Leukemia cutis {{refers to}} {{cutaneous}} <b>infiltration</b> <b>by</b> malignant hematopoietic cells. Its clinical manifestations are highly variable and biopsy {{is required for}} confirmation. We present three cases of patients with persistent monocytosis and skin lesions whose diagnosis was chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. The biopsy of skin lesions showed a dermal <b>infiltration</b> <b>by</b> atypical myelocytes and monocytes. Immunohistochemical study was positive for CD 68. These findings were compatible with cutaneous <b>infiltration</b> <b>by</b> chronic myelomonocytic leukemic cells...|$|R

40|$|The {{formation}} of polyelectrolyte complexation (PEC) films <b>by</b> <b>dipping</b> free-standing films of either gellan gum (GG) or chitosan (CH) into solutions of opposite charge is reported. It was {{shown that the}} composition and mechanical characteristics depend on pH, and {{the order in which}} the biopolymers were added, i. e., dipping CH into GG, or dipping GG into CH. Toughness, tensile strength, extensibility and density values of PEC films prepared by immersing CH films into GG solutions increased with increasing CH:GG ratio. This was not observed for PEC films prepared <b>by</b> <b>dipping</b> GG into CH. The observed behaviour is attributed to the difference in their film compositions, i. e., films prepared <b>by</b> <b>dipping</b> GG into CH solution consist of an inner CH layer and two outer GG layers. In contrast, GG appears to diffuse into the CH layer for films prepared <b>by</b> <b>dipping</b> CH into GG...|$|R

40|$|Objective. Infiltration of {{rheumatoid}} arthritis (RA) synovial tissue (ST) by differentiated dendritic cells (DC) is a consistent feature {{in patients with}} active disease. However, mononuclear cells (MNC), including DC, may be nonspecifically chemoattracted to inflammatory sites regardless of etiology, Therefore, to evaluate the specificity of ST <b>infiltration</b> <b>by</b> differentiated DC, synovial biopsies from patients with RA, spondylarthropathy (SpA), osteoarthritis (OA), and gout were examined. Methods. Formalin-fixed ST sections were analyzed by double immunohistochemical staining for vascularity and <b>infiltration</b> <b>by</b> differentiated DC, lymphocytes, and macrophages. Results, DC containing nuclear RelB were found in perivascular MNC aggregates from patients with all arthritides studied. <b>Infiltration</b> <b>by</b> differentiated DC was similar in RA and SpA ST, but reduced in OA ST. Differentiated DC were always observed in close association with lymphocytes, and the correlation between these variables suggested that the infiltration of inflammatory sites by DC and lymphocytes was associated. Conclusion, Perivascular <b>infiltration</b> <b>by</b> DC, lymphocytes, and macrophages is nonspecifically related to inflammation, but signals present in RA and SpA ST lead to more intense cellular infiltration and accumulation...|$|R

40|$|Silver {{stabilizing}} {{layer of}} coated conductor has been prepared <b>by</b> <b>dip</b> coating method using organic silver complexes containing 10 wt. % silver {{as a starting}} material.
