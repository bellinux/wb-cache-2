It has been seen from the several studies conducted by power engineers that one of the main problem in high voltage power (HV) equipment is the degradation of insulation i. e., quality of insulation of power equipment. As the high voltage power equipments are mainly subjected with spark over voltage causes by the lighting strokes, switching action, a protective device is used for determine the safe clearance required for proper insulation level. The sphere gaps are commonly used for measurements of peak values of high voltages and have been adopted by IEC and IEEE as a calibration device. Generally, the standard sphere gaps are widely used for protective device in electrical power equipments. The sphere gaps are filled up with insulating medium such as liquid <b>insulation</b> (<b>transformer</b> oil), and gas insulation (SF 6, N 2, CO 2, CCl 2 F 2 etc.) in HV power equipments. Normally, air medium is widely used as an insulating medium in different electrical power equipments as its breakdown strength is 30 kV/cm. Therefore electrical breakdown characteristic of small air gap under the different applied voltage has its great significance for the design consideration of various air insulated HV equipment. In addition, the effect of breakdown voltage on different insulation like lamiflex, leatheroid, plywood, craft paper, and polyester fiber has also been studied. To observe the effect on insulation due to breakdown mechanism, the insulation samples are collected both before and after breakdown voltage test and analysis has been done with the help of Scanning electron microscope (SEM).

40|$|Power {{transformers}} {{are important}} and expensive elements within the electric power transmission and distribution utilities. Since these equipments are connected in series to the network, any inadvertent failures would cause catastrophic interruptions to the power supply. As such, it is extremely critical for the power transformer to operate continuously {{in order to maintain}} a reliable and efficient electricity supply. Ageing or defects in power transformer has a root in its insulation structure and this has always been a well-known fact. For many years, mineral oil impregnated cellulose paper (OIP) has been the choice of <b>insulation</b> for power <b>transformers</b> due to its excellent dielectric properties as well as its inexpensive price. During the course of operation, the dielectric properties of OIP insulation inevitably deteriorate due to singularly or a combination of stresses such as thermal, electrical, mechanical, chemical as well as environmental stresses. Degradation of power <b>transformer</b> <b>insulation</b> is an irreversible process and has been encountered by all power utilities around the world. However, replacing a power transformer simply by its age is impractical and uneconomical. With the increase in the population of ageing power transformers, there is an urgent need to evaluate the condition of <b>transformer</b> <b>insulation</b> so as to facilitate the planning for refurbishment or replacement of the equipment in a more appropriate manner. To address this issue, many techniques involving both chemical and electrical methods have been developed to monitor the insulation condition of oil-filled power transformers. However, some of these techniques are destructive by nature {{and some of them are}} unable to assess the insulation condition accurately. With the advancement in technology over the years, newer diagnostic methods in time and frequency domains have been developed in recent years to assess the insulation condition based on their dielectric responses. One of the newly developed methods is known as Frequency Domain Spectroscopy (FDS) measurement and it monitors the insulation condition by measuring the diagnostic parameters as a function of frequency ranging from 0. 1 mHz to 1 kHz. The primary focus of this thesis is to adopt FDS technique to study the effects of several deterioration factors on the dielectric response of <b>transformer</b> <b>insulation,</b> so as to develop a better understanding between FDS technique and the condition of <b>transformer</b> <b>insulation.</b> To study the effects of moisture and temperature, FDS measurements were performed on a CIGRE model transformer at various moisture concentrations and temperature levels. From the experimental results, moisture and temperature have significant impacts on the dielectric response of <b>transformer</b> <b>insulation.</b> In addition to constant temperature, FDS measurements were also performed during transient temperature conditions to investigate the effects of transient temperature on the dielectric response of <b>transformer</b> <b>insulation.</b> An empirical relationship between the dielectric response produced from transient and steady temperature conditions was able to be established from the experimental results.
