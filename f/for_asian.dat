Very small increases in sightings have been confirmed off Shiretoko Peninsula, Abashiri, and Kushiro in Hokkaido, Tsushima, Sado Island, off Maiduru in the Sea of Japan since in late 2000s as whales in Sea of Okhotsk might have started recolonizing into former habitats (for coastal Sakhalin, as well). Whales possibly used to migrated into Seto Inland Sea.|$|E

His next post was the then-Sultanate of Muscat and Oman, where held the position of Development Secretary. He was appointed political agent (then equivalent to ambassador) of Abu Dhabi in 1961, a post that he held until 1965.

5|$|Meanwhile, former {{warehouse}} {{workers and}} lottery winners Calvin (Calvin Tenner) and Hide (Hidetoshi Imura) approach Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) asking for their jobs back {{as they made}} a bad investment in an energy drink <b>for</b> <b>Asian</b> homosexuals. Darryl accepts them back and shows them around the warehouse and introduces them to new foreman Val (Ameenah Kaplan). Val's boyfriend, Brandon (Jerry Minor), is also there with her and notices the blatant compliments that Darryl gives to Val. Brandon then tells Darryl off which he responds to by just simply walking away. Later, Darryl and his daughter, Jada, are taking pictures at the family portrait studio; Val joins them and holds Darryl's hand.|$|E
5|$|No {{further action}} was taken until the summer of 1834, when {{officials}} suggested that proof coin sets be prepared as gifts <b>for</b> <b>Asian</b> dignitaries. After examining Mint records, personnel incorrectly concluded that the last Draped Bust dollars minted were dated 1804, so they chose that date for the coins. It is unknown why the current date was not used, but numismatic historian R.W. Julian suggests the coins were predated to prevent coin collectors from becoming angered when they {{would be unable to}} obtain the newly dated coins, which were struck in very small numbers. It is unknown precisely how many 1804 dollars were struck, though eight are known to be extant.|$|E

5|$|The MAW {{has been}} criticised by workers' and welfare groups for making FDWs second-class citizens. The {{statutory}} minimum wage {{does not apply to}} them; although the MAW is HK$3,920, a local worker working a 48-hour week would earn HK$6,240 if paid at the minimum hourly wage of HK$30 (as of 30 March 2015). The International Domestic Workers Federation has complained that the MAW rose by only 3.9 percent (or HK$150) from 1998 to 2012, failing to keep pace with Hong Kong's median monthly income (which rose over 15 percent during the same period). Since Hong Kong is a benchmark market <b>for</b> <b>Asian</b> migrant workers, there is pressure to keep wages low. Wages were also held in check by competition from Indonesian workers, who began arriving in large numbers during the 1990s. Since then, workers from other Asian countries (such as Bangladesh and Nepal) may be willing to work for less than the MAW.|$|E
5|$|The clutch {{is usually}} {{two or three}} buff-white eggs blotched with sepia or grey-brown, {{particularly}} at the wide end. The average egg size <b>for</b> <b>Asian</b> birds was 19.3x12.9mm (0.76x0.51in) with a weight of 1.7g (0.06oz). Both adults incubate the eggs for 16–19 days prior to hatching and feed the chicks about ten times an hour until they fledge and for several days after they can fly. The fledging time can vary from 22–24days to 25–30days, though the latter estimates probably take into account fledged young returning to the nest for food. If a nest is destroyed, or the breeding attempt otherwise fails, a replacement clutch may be laid, typically with fewer eggs. Two nests in Arabia were used in spring {{and again in the}} autumn, but it is not known if the same pair were involved.|$|E
5|$|There {{are other}} {{conferences}} on international emergency medicine as well, {{including the one}} that the World Association for Disaster and Emergency Medicine (WADEM) has held every two years since 1987. However, WADEM focuses more on disaster medicine than emergency medicine system development, {{and many of its}} member physicians are not specialists in emergency medicine. Additionally, the European Society for Emergency Medicine (EuSEM) has hosted an annual conference since 1998. EuSEM also publishes The European Journal of Emergency Medicine, develops recommendations for emergency medicine standards for European countries, and supports a disaster medicine training center and degree program in San Marino. The Asian Society for Emergency Medicine (Asian Society), which was founded in 1998, holds its own biennial conference. In addition to that, the Asian Society, like the EuSEM, develops curriculum recommendations <b>for</b> <b>Asian</b> countries.|$|E

5|$|In 1986, {{a larger}} 100cc HA05E engine model was {{introduced}} especially <b>for</b> <b>Asian</b> markets. The newer 100cc model was developed exclusively for Southeast Asian market, especially in Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam, where underbones were very popular, with new {{features such as}} a telescopic front suspension to replace the older leading link suspension, and a four-speed transmission to replace the older three-speed transmission used in older Cub variants. The 100cc model was initially known as the Honda Dream in Thailand and Honda EX5 in Malaysia, before being standardised as the Honda EX5 Dream in 2003. In addition, Honda Japan began importing the made-in-Thailand Dream as the Super Cub C100EX in 1988. The Japanese C100EX was later being facelifted in 1993, while the Southeast Asian EX5 Dream retains the 1986 design until the present day, with only minor cosmetic changes. In 2011, the carbureted EX5 Dream was phased out in Thailand and being replaced with the fuel-injected Honda Dream 110i, with the powertrain being derived from the fuel-injected Honda Wave 110i.|$|E
5|$|The Association <b>for</b> <b>Asian</b> Studies {{states that}} there is no known written {{evidence}} to suggest that later leaders of the Gelug—Gendün Drup (1391–1474) and Gendün Gyatso (1475–1571)—had any contacts with Ming China. These two religious leaders were preoccupied with an overriding concern for dealing with the powerful secular Rinpungpa princes, who were patrons and protectors of the Karma Kargyu lamas. The Rinpungpa leaders were relatives of the Phagmodrupa, yet their authority shifted over time from simple governors to rulers in their own right over large areas of Ü-Tsang. The prince of Rinbung occupied Lhasa in 1498 and excluded the Gelug from attending New Years ceremonies and prayers, the most important event in the Gelug. While the task of New Years prayers in Lhasa was granted to the Karmapa and others, Gendün Gyatso traveled in exile looking for allies. However, it was not until 1518 that the secular Phagmodru ruler captured Lhasa from the Rinbung, and thereafter the Gelug was given rights to conduct the New Years prayer. When the Drikung Kagyu abbot of Drigung Monastery threatened Lhasa in 1537, Gendün Gyatso was forced to abandon the Drepung Monastery, although he eventually returned.|$|E

40|$|To derive cut-points {{for body}} mass index (BMI) and waist {{circumference}} (WC) for minority ethnic groups that are risk equivalent based on endogenous glucose levels to cut-points for white Europeans (BMI 30 kg/m 2; WC men 102 cm; WC women 88 cm). Cross-sectional data from participants aged 40 - 75 years: 4, 672 white and 1, 348 migrant South Asian participants from ADDITION-Leicester (UK) and 985 indigenous South Asians from Jaipur Heart Watch/New Delhi studies (India). Cut-points were derived using fractional polynomial models with fasting and 2 -hour glucose as outcomes, and ethnicity, objectively-measured BMI/WC, their interaction and age as covariates. Based on fasting glucose, obesity cut-points were 25 kg/m 2 (95 % Confidence Interval: 24, 26) <b>for</b> migrant South <b>Asian,</b> and 18 kg/m 2 (16, 20) <b>for</b> indigenous South <b>Asian</b> populations. <b>For</b> men, WC cut-points were 90 cm (85, 95) <b>for</b> migrant South <b>Asian,</b> and 87 cm (82, 91) <b>for</b> indigenous South <b>Asian</b> populations. <b>For</b> women, WC cut-points were 77 cm (71, 82) <b>for</b> migrant South <b>Asian,</b> and 54 cm (20, 63) <b>for</b> indigenous South <b>Asian</b> populations. Cut-points based on 2 -hour glucose were lower than these. These findings strengthen evidence that health interventions are required at a lower BMI and WC <b>for</b> South <b>Asian</b> individuals. Based on our data and the existing literature, we suggest an obesity threshold of 25 kg/m 2 <b>for</b> South <b>Asian</b> individuals, and a very high WC threshold of 90 cm <b>for</b> South <b>Asian</b> men and 77 cm <b>for</b> South <b>Asian</b> women. Further work is required to determine whether lower cut-points are required for indigenous, than migrant, South Asians...|$|R
