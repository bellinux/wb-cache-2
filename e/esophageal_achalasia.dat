50|$|<b>Esophageal</b> <b>achalasia</b> is an esophageal {{motility}} disorder {{involving the}} smooth muscle {{layer of the}} esophagus and the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). It is characterized by incomplete LES relaxation, increased LES tone, and lack of peristalsis of the esophagus (inability of smooth muscle to move food down the esophagus) {{in the absence of}} other explanations like cancer or fibrosis.|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} were {{to assess the}} long-term outcome of <b>esophageal</b> myotomy for <b>achalasia</b> and to identify preoperative factors influencing the outcome. A total of 200 patients {{were included in the}} study.

50|$|In some situations, {{there are}} {{additional}} restrictions. For example, patients {{who need to}} avoid acid reflux, such as those recovering from <b>esophageal</b> surgery for <b>achalasia,</b> are also instructed {{to stay away from}} foods that can aggravate reflux, which include ketchup and other tomato products, citrus fruits, chocolate, mint, spicy foods, alcohol, and caffeine.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} routine use of barium swallow study in {{patients}} with chronic cough. METHODS: Between October of 2011 and March of 2012, 95 consecutive patients submitted to chest X-ray due to chronic cough (duration > 8 weeks) {{were included in the}} study. For study purposes, additional images were obtained immediately after the oral administration of 5 mL of a 5 % barium sulfate suspension. Two radiologists systematically evaluated all of the images in order to identify any pathological changes. Fisher's exact test and the chi-square test for categorical data were used in the comparisons. RESULTS: The images taken immediately after barium swallow revealed significant pathological conditions that were potentially related to chronic cough in 12 (12. 6 %) of the 95 patients. These conditions, which included diaphragmatic hiatal hernia, <b>esophageal</b> neoplasm, <b>achalasia,</b> <b>esophageal</b> diverticulum, and abnormal esophageal dilatation, were not detected on the images taken without contrast. After appropriate treatment, the symptoms disappeared in 11 (91. 6 %) of the patients, whereas the treatment was ineffective in 1 (8. 4 %). We observed no complications related to barium swallow, such as contrast aspiration. CONCLUSIONS: Barium swallow improved the detection of significant radiographic findings related to chronic cough in 11. 5 % of patients. These initial findings suggest that the routine use of barium swallow can significantly increase the sensitivity of chest X-rays in the detection of chronic cough-related etiologies...|$|R

50|$|Rampurs are {{typically}} {{a healthy and}} long-lived breed, living up to fifteen years, and hereditary illness is rare.

If such specialists are not available, it is best to seek one who specialises in the treatment of greyhounds or related breeds. Greyhounds demonstrate unusual blood chemistry, which can be misread by veterinarians not familiar with the breed; this can result in an incorrect diagnosis. Rampurs have higher levels of red blood cells than do other breeds, (a trait inherited from their English Greyhound ancestors). Since red blood cells carry oxygen to the muscles, this higher level allows the hound to move larger quantities of oxygen faster from the lungs to the muscles. Veterinary blood services should use greyhounds as blood donors if there are no available Rampurs, (Greyhounds are generally used as universal blood donors anyway).|$|E

40|$|Background: This {{study was}} carried out to {{evaluate}} and compare the outcome of various causes of non-malignant lesions of the esophagus after endoscopic therapeutic intervention. Methods: A cohort of patients with non-malignant dysphagia presenting at Aga Khan University hospital, a tertiary care setting who underwent endoscopic intervention was studied. Response to treatment was evaluated by improvement in dysphagia score {{on a scale of}} 0 - 4 and weight gain. Results: 99 subjects (53 males) were included. Mean age was 48. 6 Â± 17. 2 years. Dysphagia for solids was present in 48 %, for liquids in 3 % and for both in 49 % patients. Significant weight loss (> 10 % body weight) occurred in 35 (35. 3 %) patients. Achalasia was diagnosed in 49. 5 %, peptic stricture in 30. 4 %, post sclerotherapy stricture in 12. 1 %, corrosive injury in 4 %, post-operative stricture in 4 %. In comparative analysis of achalasia and inflammatory groups, good response to dysphagia was seen in 40 / 49 (82 %) and 22 / 50 (44 %) respectively p < 0. 001. Weight gain was 35 / 49 (72 %) and 22 / 50 (44 %) p < 0. 001 respectively. Significantly, more endoscopic sessions were required in inflammatory group compare to achalasia; 2. 2 and 1. 1 respectively; p < 0. 001 and 16 % complications rate in inflammatory group comparing to no complications in achalasia.

Thirty-five patients (mean age 53 years, 80 % females) with a manometric picture of diffuse esophageal spasm were followed for at least 1 year. Patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease confirmed by pH monitoring or systemic diseases that may affect esophageal motility were excluded. Esophageal manometry was repeated in all patients. Five (14 %) of the patients progressed to achalasia at a mean follow-up of 2. 1 (range 1 - 4) years. Demographic characteristics were not predictive of transition to achalasia, while dysphagia (P= 0. 005) as the main symptom and the wave amplitude of simultaneous waves less than 50 mmHg (P= 0. 003) were statistically significant. in conclusion, the transition of diffuse <b>esophageal</b> spasm to <b>achalasia</b> is not frequent at a 2 -year follow-up.

40|$|Benign esophageal lesions {{occur in}} various diseases. Barium studies {{are useful for}} the {{evaluation}} of mucosal surface lesions but provide little information about the extramucosal extent of disease. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, on the other hand, permit the assessment of wall thickness, mediastinal involvement, adjacent lymphadenopathy, and distant spread. In diseases such as fibrovascular polyps, duplication cysts, scleroderma, trauma, caustic esophagitis, hiatal hernia, <b>esophageal</b> diverticulum, <b>achalasia,</b> and paraesophageal varices, the findings of imaging studies are specific, obviating the need for further invasive diagnostic work-up. The advent of helical computed tomography and its volume data set allows the acquisition of multiplanar images, and magnetic resonance imaging is useful both for this and for tissue characterization. Thus, multiplanar cross-sectional imaging further extends the role of imaging modalities to the evaluation of benign esophageal lesions.

40|$|Achalasia {{is a rare}} {{neurological}} {{deficit of}} the esophagus that produces an impaired relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter and decreased motility of the <b>esophageal</b> body. <b>Achalasia</b> is generally accepted to be a pre-malignant disorder, since, particularly in the mega-esophagus, chronic irritation by foods and bacterial overgrowth {{may contribute to the}} development of dysplasia and carcinoma.

40|$|<b>Achalasia</b> is an <b>esophageal</b> {{motility}} {{disorder of}} unknown cause, characterized by aperistalsis of the esophageal body and impaired lower esophageal sphincter relaxation. Patients present at all ages, primarily with dysphagia for solids/liquids and bland regurgitation. The diagnosis {{is suggested by}} barium esophagram and confirmed by <b>esophageal</b> manometry. <b>Achalasia</b> cannot be cured. Instead, {{our goal is to}} relieve symptoms, improve esophageal emptying and prevent the development of megaesophagus. The most successful therapies are pneumatic dilation and surgical myotomy.

Laparoscopic myotomy, usually combined with a partial fundoplication, has an overall success rate of 87 %. Young patients, especially men, are the best candidates for surgical myotomy. Botulinum toxin injection into the lower esophageal sphincter and smooth muscle relaxants are usually reserved for older patients or those with co-morbid illness.

40|$|Megaesophagus as the {{end result}} of {{achalasia}} is the consequence of disordered peristalsis and the slow decompensation of the esophageal muscular layer. The main symptoms of achalasia are dysphagia, regurgitation, chest pain and weight loss, but respiratory symptoms, such as coughing, particularly when patients lie in a horizontal position, may also be common due to microaspiration. A 70 -year old woman suffered from a nocturnal cough and shortness of breath with stridor. She reported difficulty in swallowing food over the past ten years, but had adapted by eating a semi-liquid diet. Chest X-ray showed right hemithorax patchy opacities projecting from the posterior mediastinum. Chest computed tomography scan showed a marked dilatation of the esophagus with abundant food residues. Endoscopy confirmed the diagnosis of megaesophagus due to <b>esophageal</b> <b>achalasia,</b> excluding other causes of obstruction, such as secondary esophagitis, polyps, leiomyoma or leiomyosarcoma. In the elderly population, swallowing difficulties due to <b>esophageal</b> <b>achalasia</b> are often underestimated and less troublesome than the respiratory symptoms that are caused by microaspiration.

As a control, 60 non-achalasia subjects including reflux esophagitis and superficial esophageal cancer were also included in this study. Endoscopic findings were evaluated according to Descriptive Rules for Achalasia of the Esophagus as follows: (1) esophageal dilatation, (2) abnormal retention of liquid and/or food, (3) whitish change of the mucosal surface, (4) functional stenosis of the esophago-gastric junction, and (5) abnormal contraction. Additionally, the presence of the longitudinal superficial wrinkles of esophageal mucosa, "pinstripe pattern (PSP) " was evaluated endoscopically. Then, inter-observer diagnostic agreement was assessed for each finding. The prevalence rates of the above-mentioned findings (1 - 5) were 41. 1 %, 41. 1 %, 16. 1 %, 94. 6 %, and 43. 9 %, respectively.

40|$|Objective To {{investigate}} the mechanism and effect of columnar balloon dilatation therapy on treating patients with severe dysphagia caused by upper <b>esophageal</b> sphincter (UES) <b>achalasia</b> after stroke. Methods Sixty -four patients with severe dysphagia caused by UES achalasia after stroke were diagnosed through Video Fluoroscopic Swallowing Study (VFSS) and esophageal dynamics testing. The patients were randomly divided into control group (N = 32) and treatment group (N = 32). Patients in control group {{were treated with}} routine drug treatment and routine rehabilitation training, while patients in treatment group were treated with columnar balloon dilatation therapy {{on the basis of}} routine treatment. The treatment end point was either the patient resuming an oral diet or after 4 -weeks treatment. All cases were evaluated by swallowing function of VFSS, high resolution manometry (HRM) and scores of the severity of dysphagia before treatment and at treatment end point. Results Compared with before treatment, UES resting pressure (P = 0. 000) and residual pressure (P = 0. 000) were significantly decreased, peak pressure was significantly increased (P = 0. 000), duration of relaxation was prolonged (P = 0. 000), and scores of the severity of dysphagia were significantly increased (P = 0. 000, 0. 000) in both groups after treatment. Compared with control group, UES resting pressure (P = 0. 001) and residual pressure (P = 0. 000) were significantly decreased, peak pressure was significantly increased (P = 0. 002), duration of relaxation was prolonged (P = 0. 000), and scores of the severity of dysphagia were significantly increased (P = 0. 000) in treatment group after treatment. Until the treatment end point or after 4 -week treatment, the total effective rate in treatment group was significantly higher than that in control group [93. 75 % (30 / 32) vs. 81. 25 % (26 / 32); Ï 2 = 4. 010, P = 0. 000].

RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 14 years, 84. 5 % of patients had a good or excellent relief of symptoms, and clinical scores as well as resting pressures of the esophageal body and LES were reduced compared with preoperative values (P< 0. 001). However, {{there was no significant}} difference in DeMeester score between pre- and postoperative patients (P= 0. 51). Esophageal transit was improved in postoperative patients, but still slower than that in normal controls. The incidence of gastroesophageal reflux in patients who underwent esophageal myotomy alone was 63. 6 % compared to 27. 3 % in those who underwent myotomy and antireflux procedure (P= 0. 087). Three (1. 7 %) patients were complicated with esophageal cancer after surgery. CONCLUSION: <b>Esophageal</b> myotomy for <b>achalasia</b> can reduce the resting pressures of the esophageal body and LES and improve esophageal transit and dysphagia. Myotomy in combination with antireflux procedure can prevent gastroesophageal reflux to a certain extent, but further randomized studies should be carried out to demonstrate its efficacy.

40|$|Hong et al 1 has {{reported}} a study entitled âA unique esophageal motor pattern that involves longitudinal muscles {{is responsible for}} emptying in achalasia esophagus â in the July 2010 issue of Gastroenterology. Achalasia esophagus is characterized by loss of peristalsis and incomplete esophagogastric junction (EGJ) relaxation. Recent studies showed that there is considerable heterogeneity in the disease entity of achalasia esophagus. 2 The symptoms such as dysphagia and chest pain in achalasia patients are related to poor esophageal emptying, and in turn related to impaired lower esophageal sphincter (LES) relaxation and lack of <b>esophageal</b> peristalsis. In <b>achalasia,</b> even though incomplete, esophageal emptying occurs intermittently, irrespective of the gravity. However, the precise mechanism of esophageal emptying has never been studied. In this study, based on a recent high-resolution manometr...|$|R
