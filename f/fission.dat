5|$|Bohr and Wheeler {{set to work}} {{applying}} the liquid drop model to explain the mechanism of nuclear <b>fission.</b> As the experimental physicists studied <b>fission,</b> they uncovered puzzling results. George Placzek asked Bohr why uranium seemed to <b>fission</b> with both very fast and very slow neutrons. Walking to a meeting with Wheeler, Bohr had an insight that the <b>fission</b> at low energies {{was due to the}} uranium-235 isotope, while at high energies it was mainly due to the far more abundant uranium-238 isotope. They co-wrote two more papers on <b>fission.</b> Their first paper appeared in Physical Review on September 1, 1939, the day Germany invaded Poland, starting World War II in Europe.|$|E
5|$|Conventional <b>fission</b> {{power plants}} {{rely on the}} chain {{reaction}} caused when <b>fission</b> events release thermal neutrons that cause further <b>fission</b> events. Each <b>fission</b> event in U-235 releases two or three neutrons with about 2MeV of kinetic energy. By careful arrangement {{and the use of}} various absorber materials, designers can balance the system so one of those neutrons causes another <b>fission</b> event while the other one or two are lost. This balance is known as criticality. Natural uranium is a mix of three isotopes; mainly U-238, with some U-235, and trace amounts of U-234. The neutrons released in the <b>fission</b> of either of the main isotopes will cause <b>fission</b> in U-235, but not in U-238, which requires higher energies around 5MeV. There is not enough U-235 in natural uranium to reach criticality. Commercial light water nuclear reactors, the most prevalent power reactors in the world, use nuclear fuel containing uranium enriched to 3 to 5% U-235 while the leftover is U-238.|$|E

The difference, apparent at 20 <b>fissions</b> post-fertilization, is essentially gone by 100 <b>fissions.</b> This observation {{is consistent with}} a generalized "allelic exclusion" at all loci completed by perhaps 60 <b>fissions</b> after fertilization...|$|R
40|$|The karyotypes {{of living}} catarrhines are {{correlated}} with the current concepts of their fossil record and systematic classification. A phylogeny, beginning {{at the base of}} the Oligocene, for those animals and their chromosome numbers is presented. Toddś (1970) theory of karyotypic <b>fissioning</b> is applied to this case — three <b>fissioning</b> events are hypothesized. A late Eocene event (the primary catarrhine <b>fissioning)</b> is hypothesized to underlie the diversification of the infraorder Catarrhini into its extant families, the second <b>fissioning</b> underlies the radiation of the Pongidae/Hominidae in the Miocene and the third accounts for the high chromosome numbers (54 – 72) and the Neogene (Miocene-Pliocene-Pleistocene) radiation of members of the genus Cercopithecus. Published catarrhine chromosome data, including that for “marked” chromosomes (those with a large achromatic region that is the site for ribosomal RNA genes) are tabulated and analysed. The ancestral X chromosome is always retained in the unfissioned metacentric state. The Pongidae/Hominidae have 15 pairs of mediocentric chromosomes that survived the second <b>fissioning</b> whereas the other chromosomes (besides the X) are thought to be fission-derived acrocentrics. Both the detailed karyology and the trend from low to high numbers is best interpreted to support Toddś concept of adaptive radiations correlated with karyotypic <b>fissioning</b> in ancestral populations...|$|R
5|$|The Baker {{explosion}} ejected {{into the}} environment about twice as many free neutrons as there were <b>fission</b> events. A plutonium <b>fission</b> event produces, on average, 2.9 neutrons, {{most of which are}} consumed in the production of more <b>fission,</b> until <b>fission</b> falls off and the remaining uncaptured neutrons escape. In an air burst, most of these environmental neutrons are absorbed by superheated air which rises into the stratosphere, along with the <b>fission</b> products and unfissioned plutonium. In the underwater Baker detonation, the neutrons were captured by seawater in the lagoon.|$|E
5|$|Another {{model for}} the {{evolution}} of circular permutations is the <b>fission</b> and fusion model. The process starts with two partial proteins. These may represent two independent polypeptides (such as two parts of a heterodimer), or may have originally been halves of a single protein that underwent a <b>fission</b> event to become two polypeptides.|$|E

40|$|Recently we {{have shown}} that given two multi-chromossomal genomes {{it is easy to}} compute the minimum weight series of fusions, <b>fissions,</b> and transpositions needed to {{transform}} one genome into the other, when the weight associated to transpositions is twice as large as that associated to fusions and <b>fissions</b> [17]. In this work we present several results on the computation of distance when an arbitrary weight is associated to transpositions. Some variations of the problem are also studied. For instance we present a polynomial time algorithm for the problem of syntenic distance when only the events of fusions and <b>fissions</b> are admitted...|$|R
5|$|Each fusion {{event in}} the D-T fusion reactor gives off an alpha {{particle}} and a fast neutron with around 14MeV of kinetic energy. This is enough energy to cause <b>fission</b> in U-238, and many other transuranic elements as well. This reaction is used in H-bombs to increase the yield of the fusion section by wrapping it in a layer of depleted uranium, which undergoes rapid <b>fission</b> when hit by the neutrons from the fusion bomb inside. The same basic concept {{can also be used}} with a fusion reactor like LIFE, using its neutrons to cause <b>fission</b> in a blanket of <b>fission</b> fuel. Unlike a <b>fission</b> reactor, which burns out its fuel once the U-235 drops below a certain threshold value, these fission–fusion hybrid reactors can continue producing power from the <b>fission</b> fuel as long as the fusion reactor continues to provide neutrons. As the neutrons have high energy, they can potentially cause multiple <b>fission</b> events, leading to the reactor as a whole producing more energy, a concept known as energy multiplication. Even leftover nuclear fuel taken from conventional nuclear reactors will burn in this fashion. This is potentially attractive because this burns off many of the long lived radioisotopes in the process, producing waste that is only mildly radioactive and lacking most long-lived components.|$|E
5|$|Emission of {{neutrons}} {{during the}} <b>fission</b> of uranium {{is important not}} only for maintaining the nuclear chain reaction, {{but also for the}} synthesis of the heavier actinides. Uranium-239 converts via β-decay into plutonium-239, which, like uranium-235, is capable of spontaneous <b>fission.</b> The world's first nuclear reactors were built not for energy, but for producing plutonium-239 for nuclear weapons.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, the Pupin Physics Laboratories at Columbia where Zinn worked {{were the}} center of {{intensive}} research into the properties of uranium and nuclear <b>fission,</b> which had recently been discovered by Lise Meitner, Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann. At Columbia, Zinn, Enrico Fermi, Herbert L. Anderson , John R. Dunning and Leo Szilard investigated whether uranium-238 fissioned with slow neutrons, as Fermi believed, or only the uranium-235 isotope, as Niels Bohr contended. Since pure uranium-235 was not available, Fermi and Szilard chose to work with natural uranium. They were particularly interested in whether a nuclear chain reaction could be initiated. This would require more than one neutron to be emitted per <b>fission</b> on average {{in order to keep}} the chain reaction going. By March 1939, they established that about two were being emitted per <b>fission</b> on average. The delay between an atom absorbing a neutron and <b>fission</b> occurring would be the key to controlling a chain reaction.|$|E

5|$|In most {{fusion energy}} designs, fusion {{neutrons}} react {{with a blanket}} of lithium to breed new tritium for fuel. A major issue with the fission–fusion design is that the neutrons causing <b>fission</b> are no longer available for tritium breeding. While the <b>fission</b> reactions release additional neutrons, these {{do not have enough}} energy to complete the breeding reaction with Li-7, which makes up more than 92% of natural lithium. These lower energy neutrons will cause breeding in Li-6, which could be concentrated from the natural lithium ore. However, the Li-6 reaction only produces one tritium per neutron captured, and more than one T per neutron is needed to make up for natural decay and other losses. Using Li-6, neutrons from the <b>fission</b> would make up for the losses, but only at the cost of removing them from causing other <b>fission</b> reactions, lowering the reactor power output. The designer has to choose which is more important; burning up the fuel through fusion neutrons, or providing power through self-induced <b>fission</b> events.|$|E

The former makes up just 0.714 percent of the uranium atoms in natural uranium, about one in every 140; natural uranium is 99.28 percent uranium-238. There is also a tiny amount of uranium-234, which accounts for just 0.006 percent.|$|E
5|$|The risk of {{building}} an operational reactor running at criticality in a populated area {{was a significant}} issue, as there was a danger of a catastrophic nuclear meltdown blanketing one of the United States' major urban areas in radioactive <b>fission</b> products. But the physics of the system suggested that the pile could be safely shut down even {{in the event of}} a runaway reaction. When a fuel atom undergoes <b>fission,</b> it releases neutrons that strike other fuel atoms in a chain reaction. The time between absorbing the neutron and undergoing <b>fission</b> is measured in nanoseconds. Szilard had noted that this reaction leaves behind <b>fission</b> products that may also release neutrons, but do so over much longer periods, from microseconds to as long as minutes. In a slow reaction like the one in a pile where the <b>fission</b> products build up, these neutrons account for about three percent of the total neutron flux.|$|E

40|$|The {{stability}} of multielectron bubbles (MEBs) in liquid helium is investigated using the liquid-drop model for <b>fissioning</b> nuclei.

A new cytoplasmic marker, erythromycin resistance, was used to eliminate nonconjugant and macronuclear regeneration clones. Twenty early mature clones were obtained from five different mutagenized cultures. Three of them were genetically analyzed by crosses to wild-type stocks. The results show all three mutants to be controlled by incompletely dominant genes, i. e., the homozygotes became mature 20 - 25 <b>fissions</b> and the heterozygotes 15 <b>fissions</b> earlier than the wild-type clones.

5|$|Among 19 {{isotopes}} of curium, {{the most}} accessible are 242Cm and 244Cm; they are α-emitters, but with much shorter lifetime than the americium isotopes. These isotopes emit almost no γ-radiation, but undergo spontaneous <b>fission</b> {{with the associated}} emission of neutrons. More long-lived isotopes of curium (245–248Cm, all α-emitters) are formed as a mixture during neutron irradiation of plutonium or americium. Upon short irradiation, this mixture is dominated by 246Cm, and then 248Cm begins to accumulate. Both of these isotopes, especially 248Cm, have a longer half-life (3.48 years) and are much more convenient for carrying out chemical research than 242Cm and 244Cm, {{but they also have}} a rather high rate of spontaneous <b>fission.</b> 247Cm has the longest lifetime among isotopes of curium (1.56 years), but is not formed in large quantities because of the strong <b>fission</b> induced by thermal neutrons.|$|E
