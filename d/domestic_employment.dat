They were busily covering the wicker-worked flakes about their houses with salted fish, and we now saw that the back yards were improved for this purpose as much as the front; where one man's fish ended another's began. In almost every yard we detected some little building from which these treasures were being trundled forth and systematically spread, and we saw that there was an art as well as a knack even in spreading fish, and that a division of labor was profitably practised. One man was withdrawing his fishes a few inches beyond the nose of his neighbor's cow which had stretched her neck over a paling to get at them. It seemed a quite <b>domestic</b> <b>employment,</b> like drying clothes, and indeed {{in some parts of the}} county the women take part in it.|$|E

"It is {{the custom}} in summer," [...] said Lord Menteith, without {{attending}} to his apology, [...] "to send the cows to the upland pastures {{to have the}} benefit of the grass; and the maids of the village, and of the family, go there to milk them in the morning and evening. While thus employed, the females of this family, to their great terror, perceived that their motions were watched at a distance by a pale, thin, meagre figure, bearing a strong resemblance to their deceased mistress, and passing, of course, for her apparition. When some of the boldest resolved to approach this faded form, it fled from them into the woods with a wild shriek. The husband, informed of this circumstance, came up to the glen with some attendants, and took his measures so well as to intercept the retreat of the unhappy fugitive, and to secure the person of his unfortunate lady, though her intellect proved to be totally deranged. How she supported herself during her wandering in the woods could not be known--some supposed she lived upon roots and wild-berries, with which the woods at that season abounded; but the greater part of the vulgar were satisfied that she must have subsisted upon the milk of the wild does, or been nourished by the fairies, or supported in some manner equally marvellous. Her re-appearance was more easily accounted for. She had seen from the thicket the milking of the cows, to superintend which had been her favourite <b>domestic</b> <b>employment,</b> and the habit had prevailed even in her deranged state of mind.|$|E

30|$|This paper {{investigated}} {{the impact of}} outward FDI on <b>domestic</b> production and <b>employment</b> in Japan’s manufacturing industry by input–output analysis. Three effects are analyzed separately: export promotion effect, export substitution effect and import inverse effect. As a result, export promotion effect is positive, and export substitution effect and import inverse effect are negative. Export substitution effect has the most negative impact {{than the other two}} so that the total effect of Japan’s outward FDI has negative impact on <b>domestic</b> production and <b>employment,</b> which means that outward FDI caused the decrease in <b>domestic</b> production and <b>employment</b> in Japan’s manufacturing industry. Among these manufacturing industries, the transportation equipment industry has the greatest negative impact. The unemployment in this industry is more than other industries because production plants transferred to foreign countries. From the trend of the result, we can know that the unemployment caused by foreign investment became serious from 2000, although it decreased in 2008 because of depression.|$|R

40|$|We use new {{offshoring}} {{data and}} new workforce micro-data with occupational classifications to investigate how {{an increase in}} the global supply of IT workers has affected the occupational composition of the US IT workforce.
