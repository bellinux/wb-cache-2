5|$|Timmons' career {{declined}} {{quickly in}} the 1960s, {{in part because of}} drug abuse and alcoholism and {{partly as a result of}} frustration at being typecast as a composer and player of seemingly simple pieces of music. In 1968 he made his second, final, recording for Milestone, Do You <b>Know</b> <b>the</b> <b>Way?</b> In the following year he played in a quartet led by Sonny Red, with Dexter Gordon on one of the saxophonist's temporary returns to the US from Europe, and in a trio backing vocalist Etta Jones. Timmons continued to play in the early 1970s, mostly in small groups or in combination with other pianists, and mainly in the New York area.|$|E

While media members speculated about a lack of {{compatibility}} between her in-laws and her, Kajol clarified that they were [...] "like parents to me" [...] and encouraged her to continue working in films. Tabloids have often romantically linked Devgan with other Bollywood actresses, and have reported about an imminent divorce. Refuting the rumours, Kajol stated, [...] "I don't believe in those rumours because I <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> this industry functions.

Well, I'm a jobbing actor... {{as long as}} they pay me I couldn't care less if my name is billed above or below the title". Although Le Mesurier played a wide range of parts, he became known as [...] "an indispensable figure in the gallery of second-rank players which were the glory of the British film industry in its more prolific days". He felt his characterisations owed [...] "a lot to my customary expression of bewildered innocence" [...] and tried to stress for many of his roles that his parts were those of [...] "a decent chap all at sea in a chaotic world not of his own making".|$|E

According to NPR's Morning Edition, Bunker has [...] "become a revered voice to many members of Anonymous", and they refer to him as [...] "Wise Beard Man". Bunker told Newsweek that he {{was pleased to see}} a large group of young individuals acting against Scientology, but stated he was also concerned for their safety: [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> Scientology works: they're going to get these people in trouble ... I'm very concerned about their safety, and I'm concerned about the Scientologists' safety, too." [...] Bunker stated that he has received 6,000 emails from individuals who say they are part of Anonymous. Bunker attended the February 10, 2008 protest against Scientology in Los Angeles.|$|E
500|$|On November 9, 2007, Jay-Z {{appeared}} on the Charlie Rose Show to discuss the album. When asked about how the film gave life to this album, he stated [...] "It's a New York City true story, you know. So {{as soon as the}} movie came on, it was like familiar, things that my pop seen and my uncles seen and, you know, different things like that, things I've seen growing up. So they resonated with me in a way, the story, as well as, I mean, even though everything happens, you <b>know,</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> it turns out, you know, it's one of those movies that where you champion the bad guy, because the bad guy, you know, he don't seem like a bad guy, and the good guy — I mean the good guys are bad. You know, that complex — the complexity of human beings in this thing was amazing to me. I loved the complexity of the human beings".|$|E
500|$|The plot of Man of Steel {{employs a}} {{nonlinear}} narrative, and tells {{parts of the}} story in flashback. During story discussions for The Dark Knight Rises in 2008, David S. Goyer told Christopher Nolan his idea regarding how to present Superman in a modern context. Impressed with Goyer's concept, Nolan pitched the idea to the studio, who hired Nolan to produce and Goyer to write based on the financial and critical success of The Dark Knight. Nolan admired Bryan Singer's work on Superman Returns for its connection to Richard Donner's version, stating that [...] "A {{lot of people have}} approached Superman {{in a lot of different}} ways. I only <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> that has worked for us that's what I know how to do," [...] emphasizing the idea that Batman exists in a world where he is the only superhero and a similar approach to the Man of Steel would assure the integrity needed for the film. [...] "Each serves to the internal logic of the story. They have nothing to do with each other." [...] Nolan, however, clarified that the new film would not have any relationship with the previous film series.|$|E

2500|$|Recording {{sessions}} in Los Angeles, with producers Waddy Wachtel (Bob Dylan, Rolling Stones, Robbie Williams) [...] and Greg Ladanyi (Warren Zevon, Jackson Browne, Fleetwood Mac), were {{a new challenge}} according to Kilbey, [...] "It was Australian hippies versus West Coast guys who <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> they like to do things. We were a bit more undisciplined {{than they would have}} liked". Personality clashes occurred as the two sides bickered over guitar sounds, song structures and work ethic. Under pressure from the producers, Kilbey took vocal lessons, an experience he later regarded as valuable.|$|E

2500|$|California {{still was}} {{a land of}} free spirits, open hearts, and easy-going living. Popular music of the period bore titles such as [...] "California Girls," [...] "California Dreamin'," [...] "San Francisco (Be Sure to Wear Flowers in Your Hair)," [...] "Do You <b>Know</b> <b>the</b> <b>Way</b> to San Jose" [...] and [...] "Hotel California". These {{reflected}} the Californian promise of easy living in a paradisaical climate. The surfing culture burgeoned. Many people took low-paying jobs and joined the surfers living in trailers at the beach, and many others forsook ambition and joined the hippies living in cities.|$|E

The oracle responded, [...] "he that wounded shall heal". The Achaean fleet then set sail and was scattered by a storm. Achilles landed in Scyros and married Deidamia.

2500|$|Warwick had re-recorded a Pat Williams-arranged {{version of}} the theme at A Studios in New York because {{contractual}} restrictions with her label would not allow the Warwick version from the film to be included on the 20th Century Fox soundtrack LP, and reverse legal restrictions would not allow the film version to be used anyplace else in a commercial LP. The LP Dionne Warwick in Valley of the Dolls, released in early 1968 and containing the re-recorded {{version of the}} movie theme (#2–4 weeks), [...] "Do You <b>Know</b> <b>the</b> <b>Way</b> to San Jose?" [...] and several new Bacharach-David compositions, hit the #6 position on the Billboard album chart and would remain on the chart for over a year.

2500|$|The phrase pneuma pythona'.' (or puthona) means [...] "Pythonian spirit" [...] or [...] "divinatory spirit," [...] and occurs {{only once}} in the New Testament. In , after Paul and Silas visit a woman of Thyatira, they are greeted {{on their way to}} synagogue by a [...] "working girl" [...] (paidiskê), a slave who has earned a {{reputation}} as a gifted diviner; she is said to have a pneuma pythona, not akatharton or poneron, though the spirit is presumed to be evil. Through her employment she earns significant income for her masters. The adjective pythona indicates a connection to the cult of Apollo, regarded as the greatest of the Greek oracular gods; she is nevertheless inspired to acknowledge out loud that the two missionaries of the [...] "most high god" [...] (theos hypsistos; see also Hypsistarians) <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> to salvation. For several days, she repeatedly voices this praise of Christianity.
