There is considerable variation <b>in</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> of the glans protrudes from the hood and how much is covered by it, ranging from completely covered to fully exposed, and tissue of the labia minora also encircles the base of the glans.|$|E
5|$|Evaluative {{conditioning}} {{suggests that}} if the name is liked then the name letters will be liked too. This would occur through repeated visual association of the name letters with the name. Martin and Levey defined evaluative conditioning as a variation of classical conditioning in which we come to like or dislike something through an association. Given the observation that our own name stands out among others as quite an attractive stimulus, as Cherry found in the cocktail party effect, {{it could be that}} the name-letter effect results from evaluative conditioning. Feys set up a controlled study with Flemish subjects, pairing unfamiliar symbols (Japanese kanji) with subjects' own names, and with other names. He found that there was no difference <b>in</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> subjects liked the kanji symbol representing their own name or other names. He concluded that evaluative conditioning is not the primary cause of the name-letter effect.|$|E

25|$|Temperature and {{humidity}} play {{a large role}} <b>in</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> ozone is being produced using traditional generation methods (such as corona discharge and ultraviolet light).

25|$|Variance <b>in</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> one {{breathes}} out {{can also}} give false readings, usually low.

The presence of volatile components is another example of this; mixtures of volatile compounds can be more volatile than their components, which can create artificially high levels of ethanol (or other) vapors relative to the normal biological blood/breath alcohol equilibrium.|$|E

25|$|Wakefield pitched {{with what}} {{is said to be}} a slow sidearm motion, but is {{actually}} a ¾-overhand motion.

Wakefield's primary pitch, the knuckleball, is normally thrown about 64–68mph and has a great deal of variance <b>in</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> it 'flutters'. The flutter of his knuckleball depended on a variety of factors including temperature, humidity, precipitation (both type and intensity), air resistance, wind speed, wind direction, the condition of the ball, and very small changes in his grip or the orientation of the seams. Wakefield also featured a 71–75mph fastball, a slow curve (57-61mph), and a slower version of his knuckleball (59-62mph).|$|E

25|$|Jesus' {{death and}} resurrection {{underpin}} a variety of theological interpretations as to how salvation is granted to humanity. These interpretations vary widely <b>in</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> emphasis they place {{on the death of}} Jesus as compared to his words. According to the substitutionary atonement view, Jesus' death is of central importance, and Jesus willingly sacrificed himself as an act of perfect obedience as a sacrifice of love which pleased God. By contrast the moral influence theory of atonement focuses much more on the moral content of Jesus' teaching, and sees Jesus' death as a martyrdom. Since the Middle Ages there has been conflict between these two views within Western Christianity. Evangelical Protestants typically hold a substitutionary view and in particular hold to the theory of penal substitution. Liberal Protestants typically reject substitutionary atonement and hold to the moral influence theory of atonement. Both views are popular within the Roman Catholic church, with the satisfaction doctrine incorporated into the idea of penance.|$|E

[...] One popular street newspaper, The Big Issue, has been a focus of this controversy because it concentrates on attracting a large readership through coverage of mainstream issues and popular culture, whereas other newspapers emphasize homeless advocacy and social issues and earn less of a profit.|$|E

A [...] "dizzied" [...] or [...] "stunned" [...] opponent will appear very discombobulated {{for a short period}} of time (in which the match timer freezes temporarily) and the player has a small margin of opporitunity to achieve an instant knockdown with a well-timed knockout punch. Each of the 16 opponents varies <b>in</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> match time it takes to become [...] "dizzied", some more quickly than others and vice-versa. There are 2 opponents who can be KOd upon the 1st knockdown, however, a knockdown during a [...] "dizzy" [...] animation is critical in making this possible. There are 8 opponents who can be KOd in 2 knockdowns, however, the player must achieve the 2nd knockdown within 4 seconds of the 1st knockdown. Finally there are 6 opponents who the player must defeat via a TKO as the aforementioned 4 seconds between the 1st 2 knockdowns does not apply.|$|E
500|$|Despite its prevalence, {{the neoclassical}} {{synthesis}} had its Keynesian critics. A strain of disequilibrium or [...] "non-Walrasian" [...] theory developed that criticized the synthesis for apparent contradictions in allowing disequilibrium phenomena, especially involuntary unemployment, to be modeled in equilibrium models. Moreover, they argued, {{the presence of}} disequilibrium in one market must be associated with disequilibrium in another, so involuntary unemployment had to be tied to an excess supply in the goods market. Many see Don Patinkin's work as {{the first in the}} disequilibrium vein. Robert W. Clower (1965) introduced his [...] "dual-decision hypothesis" [...] that a person in a market may determine what he wants to buy, but is ultimately limited <b>in</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> he can buy based on how much he can sell. Clower and Axel Leijonhufvud (1968) argued that disequilibrium formed a fundamental part of Keynes's theory and deserved greater attention. Robert Barro and Herschel Grossman formulated general disequilibrium models in which individual markets were locked into prices before there was a general equilibrium. These markets produced [...] "false prices" [...] resulting in disequilibrium. Soon after the work of Barro and Grossman, disequilibrium models fell out of favor in the United States, and Barro abandoned Keynesianism and adopted new classical, market clearing hypotheses.|$|E
500|$|Carbon is {{distributed}} throughout the atmosphere, the biosphere, and the oceans; these are referred to collectively as the carbon exchange reservoir, and each component is also referred to individually as a carbon exchange reservoir. [...] The different elements of the carbon exchange reservoir vary <b>in</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> carbon they store, and in {{how long it takes}} for the [...] generated by cosmic rays to fully mix with them. [...] This affects the ratio of [...] to [...] in the different reservoirs, and hence the radiocarbon ages of samples that originated in each reservoir. The atmosphere, which is where [...] is generated, contains about 1.9% of the total carbon in the reservoirs, and the [...] it contains mixes in less than seven years. The ratio of [...] to [...] in the atmosphere is taken as the baseline for the other reservoirs: if another reservoir has a lower ratio of [...] to , it indicates that the carbon is older and hence that some of the [...] has decayed.

The time it takes for carbon from the atmosphere to mix with the surface ocean is only a few years, but the surface waters also receive water from the deep ocean, which has more than 90% of the carbon in the reservoir. Water in the deep ocean takes about 1,000 years to circulate back through surface waters, and so the surface waters contain a combination of older water, with depleted , and water recently at the surface, with [...] in equilibrium with the atmosphere.|$|E
