25|$|The Mini-14 {{was first}} {{introduced}} in 1973 by Sturm, Ruger & Co. The name Mini-14 was coined because it resembles a smaller version of the military M14 rifle. Designed by L. James Sullivan and William B. Ruger, it incorporated numerous innovations and cost-saving engineering changes. The Mini-14 rifle employs an <b>investment</b> <b>cast,</b> heat-treated receiver and is mechanically similar to the M1 Garand rifle, with a self-cleaning, fixed-piston gas system. Initial rifles were produced with a complex, exposed bolt hold open device with no button for manual engagement. Stocks were somewhat angular and heat shields were made of wood. These rifles, with serial number prefixes before 181, were tooled and redesigned with a new stock, new bolt hold-open mechanism, and other small changes.|$|E

In addition, an aluminium mould of a blade for wax injection was fabricated using Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machining to compare conventional <b>investment</b> <b>casting</b> with the proposed rapid <b>investment</b> <b>casting</b> process.

On the other hand, sacrificial patterns produced by the Perfactory system showed lower applicability for <b>investment</b> <b>casting</b> due to pattern flexibility and difficulties in burn-out step.

40|$|Abstract- <b>Investment</b> <b>casting</b> {{process has}} been a widely used process for centuries. It {{is known for its}} ability to produce {{components}} of complex shapes with dimensional accuracy and excellent surface finish. <b>Investment</b> <b>casting</b> has been used to make manufacture weapons, jewellery and art castings during the ancient civilization and today it is used to manufacture engineering components. In <b>Investment</b> <b>casting</b> wax patterns are made by wax injection and then coating of the wax patterns are done by ceramic slurry, made with silica flour and binder. After dewaxing and firing molten metal is poured in the shell and solidified casting can be achieved. <b>Investment</b> <b>casting</b> can be cast any ferrous and non ferrous metal which is difficult in die casting. Finishing operations are negligible and very thin sections as. 75 mm can also be cast which is not possible in sand casting but there are many challenges in <b>Investment</b> <b>casting.</b> Shell prepared by conventional <b>investment</b> <b>casting</b> method has very low mechanical properties which is very important for making heavy products.

The research is centred on the suitability of rapid prototyping (RP) /Iayer manufacturing (LM) methods to produce patterns for the <b>investment</b> <b>casting</b> of aluminium (AI), magnesium (Mg) and titanium (Ti) alloys, together known as Rapid <b>Investment</b> <b>Casting.</b> Three core RP technologies are investigated namely: Three Dimensional Printing - Drop-on-Bed from Z-corporation, Three Dimensional Printing - Drop-on- Drop from ThermoJet - 3 D Systems and Selective Laser Sintering from EOS.
