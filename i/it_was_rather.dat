5|$|The trial {{started on}} February 4, 2013. Blythe testified {{that when he}} wanted to see the club before the concert, Lamb of God's {{technician}} told him that the club was terrible and messy. According to Blythe, the technician went on, saying that the stage was small, there were too many people, and that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>rather</b> dangerous.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the {{official}} account, Bissonnette's version alleges that bin Laden's wife Mariam was uninjured in the raid. In addition, Bissonnette {{states that the}} report of bin Laden's daughter Safia having splintered wood striking her foot is false, as he explains that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>rather</b> his wife Amal who was injured by such fragments.|$|E
5|$|Commenting on the gameplay, Famitsu {{noted that}} <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>rather</b> simple, but {{approved}} of the inclusion of Casual Mode and praised the content of each chapter for being just the right size. Moehnke praised the alterations made from the original version, such as not needing to dismount steeds when indoors, but also noted that some elements such as mechanics surrounding Marth showed the game's age. Nishioka generally enjoyed the gameplay experience, praising the inclusion of user-friendly options, but felt that these same new additions would divide fans.|$|E
5000|$|The {{sustainable}} {{society is}} one that lives within the self-perpetuating limits of its environment. That society, contrary to some popular opinion, is not a [...] "no-growth" [...] society. <b>It</b> <b>is,</b> <b>rather,</b> a society that recognizes the limits of growth. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> not a society that continues to seek alternatives to growth. <b>It</b> <b>is,</b> <b>rather,</b> a society that l0oks for alternative ways of growing.|$|R

5|$|They {{made all}} these {{different}} bits up, not {{thinking in terms of}} verse, chorus, bridge or what was going to go where, just coming up with all these sections of chanting, rapping and singing, which we recorded all higgledy-piggledy. And then we just sewed it together. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>rather</b> like the way we'd been working on the dance remixes we'd been doing before. Kind of a cut-and-paste method.|$|E
5|$|Max Weber was {{a pioneer}} in {{delineating}} a connection between capitalism and exceptionalism. In earlier texts, Maximiliano Korstanje explores the American exceptionalism {{and its effects on}} the current means of productions. This contribution to the existent literature is of paramount importance because of two main reasons. The first and most important, he relates capitalism to Protestantism. This is of course nothing new, since Max Weber did it in the past. However, Korstanje adds, though Weber was in the correct side by confirming the connection of Reform and Capitalism, the key role played by Norse Mythology was left behind. In effect, the concept of predestination as it has been discussed by Weber did not come from Luther alone. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>rather</b> enrooted in the core of Norse Culture. Secondly, this impossibility to understand the future led to English speaking societies to construct a risk-prone culture, which resulted in what Ulrich Beck dubbed the “Risk Society”. The criticism exerted in the uneven distribution of Capitalism should be explained by the “economy of salved peoples” formulated by Weber.|$|E
5|$|On 11 May, the pretender Mustafa {{appeared}} before the Great Council, and was given a gift of 150 ducats for his services. On 4 June a new duke and captain were elected for Thessalonica, Paolo Contarini and Andrea Donato, after the first three pairs chosen all declined the post, despite the fine attached to refusal; {{a clear indication of}} the unwillingness of the Venetian nobles to undertake the unprofitable and perilous task. On 1 July, Mocenigo attacked the Ottoman ships at Gallipoli, but although he led his flagship to break through the palisade protecting the Ottoman anchorage, the other Venetian vessels did not follow, forcing Mocenigo to withdraw with heavy casualties. Even now, however, Venice would not commit its full force to the conflict: when Suriano, as a proponent of the hawkish faction, proposed to arm a fleet of 14 ships and engage in a more decisive policy against the Ottomans in January 1430, the proposal was voted down, even though <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>rather</b> modest and clearly inadequate to force the Sultan to come to terms. Instead, the Great Council instructed the new captain-general, Silvestro Morosini, to seek the mediation of the Byzantine Emperor for a settlement on the lines of the previous agreements.|$|E

5|$|The Maya made meticulous {{observations}} of celestial bodies, patiently recording astronomical {{data on the}} movements of the sun, moon, Venus, and the stars. This information was used for divination, so Maya astronomy was essentially for astrological purposes. Maya astronomy did not serve to study the universe for scientific reasons, nor was it used to measure the seasons in order to calculate crop planting. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>rather</b> used by the priesthood to comprehend past cycles of time, and project them into the future to produce prophecy. The priesthood refined observations and recorded eclipses of the sun and moon, and movements of Venus and the stars; these were measured against dated events in the past, on the assumption that similar events would occur in the future when the same astronomical conditions prevailed. Illustrations in the codices show that priests made astronomical observations using the naked eye, assisted by crossed sticks as a sighting device. Analysis of the few remaining Postclassic codices has revealed that, at the time of European contact, the Maya had recorded eclipse tables, calendars, and astronomical knowledge that was more accurate at that time than comparable knowledge in Europe.|$|E

25|$|La Créole was premiered at the Théâtre des Bouffes Parisiens, Salle Choiseul in Paris. The costumes were {{designed}} by Alfred Grévin. Although it ran for over sixty performances, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>rather</b> coolly received due to its poor plot, and was not revived.|$|E
25|$|Some {{critics have}} tried to deny that Ellen White was a major {{influence}} in the Adventist shift toward Trinitarian doctrine and have argued that early Adventism had neither an Arian nor Trinitarian theology, but claim <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>rather</b> a materialist one, a form of philosophical monism.|$|E
25|$|The new fighter {{was not a}} great {{improvement}} on the D.H.2 – although a little faster <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>rather</b> less manoeverable. It was nonetheless ordered into production from Darracq Motor Engineering Company and Vickers. Neither manufacturer delivered their F.E.8s particularly quickly, so that the type ended up reaching the front in numbers six months later than the D.H.2.|$|E

25|$|Established in 1799, a few records exist {{from the}} Princely State of Mysore that say {{permission}} to commit sati could be granted.

25|$|Yet Helms' testimony, {{which made}} headlines, {{for the most}} part {{amounted}} to a circumspect, professional defense of the agency. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>rather</b> the testimony of William Colby the current DCI that had more lasting import and created greater controversy. Colby also sparked division within the CIA. Helms parted ways with Colby as a result, and especially regarding Colby's delicate role in the perjury allegations against him.|$|E

The DLM42 mount was mainly used on the Type IX as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>rather</b> heavy for the Type VII U-boats. The 3.7cm Flak M42U was the naval version of the 3.7cm Flak used by the Kriegsmarine on Type VII and Type IX U-boats.|$|E

A few years into his service as anchor, Rather began wearing sweaters beneath his suit jacket to soften and warm his on-air perceptions to viewers.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the band}} was {{initially}} based in Cape Town (five of the group's six members came from the Eastern Cape), they came to prominence at the 1963 National Jazz Festival in Johannesburg. An album recorded after the festival was released as Jazz – The African Sound, {{but this was not}} a Blue Notes record per se, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>rather</b> an album featuring some of the Blue Notes in a big band put together by McGregor. This big band was intended to continue touring, but proved unworkable. Instead, The Blue Notes continued as a quintet, then sextet.|$|E
25|$|The Reffye mitrailleuse used a 13mm (.512inch) {{centerfire}} cartridge, {{designed by}} Gaupillat, which represented {{the state of}} the art in ammunition design at the time. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>rather</b> similar to an elongated modern shotgun shell: centerfire with a rimmed brass head and a dark blue hardened cardboard body. The , 13mm (0.512inch) patched bullet was propelled by 185 grains (12 grams) of compressed black powder at a muzzle velocity of , three and a half times more powerful than Chassepot or Dreyse rifle ammunition. This was, by far, the most potent rifle caliber ammunition in existence at the time. The Montigny and Reffye mitrailleuse systems were not designed to function with paper cartridges such as the 11mm Chassepot combustible paper cartridge.|$|E
