25|$|Magnetoencephalography (MEG). The {{multifocal}} {{nature of}} epileptogenicity in Panayiotopoulos syndrome has been also documented with MEG, which {{revealed that the}} main <b>epileptogenic</b> areas are along the parietal-occipital, the calcarine, or the central (rolandic) sulci. Patients with frontal spikes were significantly older than patients with spikes on rolandic, parieto-occipital, or calcarine sulci. Follow-up MEG demonstrated shifting localization or disappearance of MEG spikes.|$|E
25|$|In late 2016, Eichenwald was {{intentionally}} sent <b>epileptogenic</b> GIFs over Twitter. He {{said the}} second attempt, in December, succeeded in {{causing him to}} have a seizure and that he would be taking a short break from Twitter while he pursued legal action against the user that sent the image. On March 17, 2017, a Maryland man was arrested in connection with the incident and charged with cyberstalking.|$|E
25|$|The {{clinical}} uses of MEG are {{in detecting}} and localizing pathological activity {{in patients with}} epilepsy, and in localizing eloquent cortex for surgical planning in patients with brain tumors or intractable epilepsy. The goal of epilepsy surgery is to remove the <b>epileptogenic</b> tissue while sparing healthy brain areas. Knowing the exact position of essential brain regions (such as the primary motor cortex and primary sensory cortex, visual cortex, and areas involved in speech production and comprehension) helps to avoid surgically induced neurological deficits. Direct cortical stimulation and somatosensory evoked potentials recorded on ECoG are considered {{the gold standard for}} localizing essential brain regions. These procedures can be performed either intraoperatively or from chronically indwelling subdural grid electrodes. Both are invasive.|$|E
500|$|... 1983: Positron {{emission}} tomography (PET, invented 1981) {{was compared to}} electroencephalography (EEG) and CT. It {{was found to be}} capable of locating <b>epileptogenic</b> cortical tubers that would otherwise have been missed.|$|E
500|$|... 1998: An Italian team used {{magnetoencephalography}} (MEG) {{to study}} three patients with TSC and partial epilepsy. Combined with MRI, {{they were able}} to study the association between tuberous areas of the brain, neuronal malfunctioning and <b>epileptogenic</b> areas. Later studies would confirm that MEG is superior to EEG in identifying the eliptogenic tuber, which may be a candidate for surgical resection.|$|E
500|$|After TBI, {{abnormalities}} {{exist in}} the release of neurotransmitters, chemicals used by brain cells {{to communicate with each}} other; these abnormalities {{may play a role in}} the development of PTE. [...] TBI may lead to the excessive release of glutamate and other excitatory neurotransmitters (those that stimulate brain cells and increase the likelihood that they will fire). This excessive glutamate release can lead to excitotoxicity, damage to brain cells through overactivation of the biochemical receptors that bind and respond to excitatory neurotransmitters. Overactivation of [...] glutamate receptors damages neurons; for example it leads to the formation of free radicals. [...] Excitotoxicity is a possible factor in the development of PTE; [...] it may lead to the formation of a chronic <b>epileptogenic</b> focus. An epileptic focus is the part of the brain from which epileptic discharges originate.|$|E
500|$|People whose PTE {{does not}} respond to {{medication}} may undergo surgery to remove the <b>epileptogenic</b> focus, {{the part of the}} brain that is causing the seizures. However surgery for PTE may be more difficult than it is for epilepsy due to other causes, and is less likely to be helpful in PTE than in other forms of epilepsy. It can be particularly difficult in PTE to localize the epileptic focus, in part because TBI may affect diffuse areas of the brain. Difficulty locating the seizure focus is seen as a deterrent to surgery. However, for people with sclerosis in the mesial temporal lobe (in the inner aspect of the temporal lobe), who comprise about one third of people with intractable PTE, surgery is likely to have good outcome. [...] When there are multiple epileptic foci or the focus cannot be localized, and drug therapy is not effective, vagus nerve stimulation is another option for treating PTE.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>epileptogenic</b> zones {{identified}} from preoperative EEG {{data were}} validated by observations from postoperative ECoG data {{in all three}} patients. [...] These preliminary results {{suggest that it is}} possible to direct surgical planning and locate <b>epileptogenic</b> zones noninvasively using the described imaging and integrating methods. [...] EEG findings were further validated by the surgical outcomes of all three patients. [...] After surgical resectioning, two patients are seizure-free and the third has experienced a significant reduction in seizures. [...] Due to its clinical success, FINE offers a promising alternative to preoperative ECoG, providing information about both the location and extent of <b>epileptogenic</b> sources through a noninvasive imaging procedure.|$|E
2500|$|Before {{a patient}} can be {{identified}} {{as a candidate for}} resectioning surgery, MRI must be performed to demonstrate the presence of a structural lesion within the cortex, supported by EEG evidence of <b>epileptogenic</b> tissue. Once a lesion has been identified, ECoG may be performed to determine the location and extent of the lesion and surrounding irritative region. [...] The scalp EEG, while a valuable diagnostic tool, lacks the precision necessary to localize the <b>epileptogenic</b> region. [...] ECoG is considered to be the gold standard for assessing neuronal activity in patients with epilepsy, and is widely used for presurgical planning to guide surgical resection of the lesion and <b>epileptogenic</b> zone. The success of the surgery depends on accurate localization and removal of the <b>epileptogenic</b> zone. [...] ECoG data is assessed with regard to ictal spike activity – “diffuse fast wave activity” recorded during a seizure – and interictal epileptiform activity (IEA), brief bursts of neuronal activity recorded between epileptic events. [...] ECoG is also performed following the resectioning surgery to detect any remaining epileptiform activity, and to determine the success of the surgery. [...] Residual spikes on the ECoG, unaltered by the resection, indicate poor seizure control, and incomplete neutralization of the <b>epileptogenic</b> cortical zone.

2500|$|The {{objective}} of the resectioning surgery is to remove the <b>epileptogenic</b> tissue without causing unacceptable neurological consequences. [...] In addition to identifying and localizing the extent of <b>epileptogenic</b> zones, ECoG {{used in conjunction with}} DCES is also a valuable tool for functional cortical mapping. [...] It is vital to precisely localize critical brain structures, identifying which regions the surgeon must spare during resectioning (the “eloquent cortex”) in order to preserve sensory processing, motor coordination, and speech. [...] Functional mapping requires that the patient be able to interact with the surgeon, and thus is performed under local rather than general anesthesia. [...] Electrical stimulation using cortical and acute depth electrodes is used to probe distinct regions of the cortex in order to identify centers of speech, somatosensory integration, and somatomotor processing. [...] During the resectioning surgery, intraoperative ECoG may also be performed to monitor the epileptic activity of the tissue and ensure that the entire <b>epileptogenic</b> zone is resectioned.|$|E
2500|$|Since its {{development}} in the 1950s, ECoG {{has been used to}} localize <b>epileptogenic</b> zones during presurgical planning, map out cortical functions, and to predict the success of epileptic surgical resectioning.

2500|$|The {{electrocorticogram}} {{is still}} {{considered to be the}} [...] "gold standard" [...] for defining <b>epileptogenic</b> zones; however, this procedure is risky and highly invasive. [...] Recent studies have explored the development of a noninvasive cortical imaging technique for presurgical planning that may provide similar information and resolution of the invasive ECoG.|$|E
2500|$|The {{invasive}} electrodes are stereotaxically placed electrodes or a subdural strip or grid electrode. Utilizing {{the information}} obtained through CSM, limited resection of <b>epileptogenic</b> brain can be performed. [...] For focal epilepsy, resective surgery {{is one of}} the mainstay treatment options for medication resistant epilepsy. Through the technique of CSM, generally using awake craniotomies, the neurosurgeon has the ability to monitor the functioning of the patient during the resection and stimulation of the brain.|$|E
2500|$|Photosensitive {{epilepsy}} - This is an epileptic {{reaction to}} flashing lights in susceptible persons, which can range in severity from an unusual feeling or involuntary twitch to a generalized seizure. [...] This <b>epileptogenic</b> response can {{be triggered by}} lights flashing in the frequency range of 10–20Hz, regardless of color. [...] While individual light sources used on emergency vehicles generally have much lower flash rates than this, the Loughborough study suggests that such possibilities be minimized. [...] It also notes that emergency workers may report distraction and eyestrain unrelated to epilepsy from working under the lights.|$|E
2500|$|CSM is an {{effective}} treatment for focal epilepsy [...] and bilateral or multiple seizure foci. It is {{an effective}} treatment option when resective surgery to remove the affected area is not an option, generally seen with bilateral or multiple seizure foci. CSM is routinely utilized for [...] patients with epilepsy in order to pin point {{the focal point of}} the seizures. It is used once there is a testable hypothesis regarding brain location for the <b>epileptogenic</b> zone, determined through a less invasive procedure, electroencephalography. Once {{the focal point of the}} seizures is determined, this information allows aids neurosurgeons with knowing what portions of the brain could potentially be resected without any negative post-operative neurological deficits.|$|E
2500|$|A {{study of}} 30 TSC {{patients}} in Egypt found, [...] "...earlier age of seizures commencement (<6 months) {{is associated with}} poor seizure outcome and poor intellectual capabilities. Infantile spasms and severely <b>epileptogenic</b> EEG patterns {{are related to the}} poor seizure outcome, poor intellectual capabilities and autistic behavior. Higher tubers numbers is associated with poor seizure outcome and autistic behavior. Left-sided tuber burden is associated with poor intellect, while frontal location is more encountered in ASD. So, close follow up for the mental development and early control of seizures are recommended in a trial to reduce the risk factors of poor outcome. Also early diagnosis of autism will allow for earlier treatment and the potential for better outcome for children with TSC." ...|$|E
2500|$|ECoG was pioneered in {{the early}} 1950s by Wilder Penfield and Herbert Jasper, neurosurgeons at the Montreal Neurological Institute. [...] The two {{developed}} ECoG {{as part of their}} groundbreaking Montreal procedure, a surgical protocol used to treat patients with severe epilepsy. [...] The cortical potentials recorded by ECoG were used to identify <b>epileptogenic</b> zones – regions of the cortex that generate epileptic seizures. [...] These zones would then be surgically removed from the cortex during resectioning, thus destroying the brain tissue where epileptic seizures had originated. [...] Penfield and Jasper also used electrical stimulation during ECoG recordings in patients undergoing epilepsy surgery under local anesthesia. This procedure was used to explore the functional anatomy of the brain, mapping speech areas and identifying the somatosensory and somatomotor cortex areas to be excluded from surgical removal.|$|E
2500|$|In one novel approach, Bin He et al. seek to {{integrate}} the information provided by a structural MRI and scalp EEG to provide a noninvasive alternative to ECoG. [...] This study investigated a high-resolution subspace source localization approach, FINE (first principle vectors) to image the locations and estimate the extents of current sources from the scalp EEG. [...] A thresholding technique {{was applied to the}} resulting tomography of subspace correlation values in order to identify <b>epileptogenic</b> sources. [...] This method was tested in three pediatric patients with intractable epilepsy, with encouraging clinical results. [...] Each patient was evaluated using structural MRI, long-term video EEG monitoring with scalp electrodes, and subsequently with subdural electrodes. [...] The ECoG data were then recorded from implanted subdural electrode grids placed directly {{on the surface of the}} cortex. [...] MRI and computed tomography images were also obtained for each subject.|$|E
