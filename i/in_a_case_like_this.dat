25|$|When I hear of an 'equity' <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> I am {{reminded}} of a blind man {{in a dark room}} - looking for a black hat - which isn't there.|$|E
25|$|It {{may occur}} that systems of {{coordinates}} for two {{different sets of}} geometric figures are equivalent {{in terms of their}} analysis. An example of this is the systems of homogeneous coordinates for points and lines in the projective plane. The two systems <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> are said to be dualistic. Dualistic systems have the property that results from one system can be carried over to the other since these results are only different interpretations of the same analytical result; this is known as the principle of duality.|$|E
2500|$|After an {{extensive}} analysis finding that truthful trial testimony was protected speech, which culminating in find a genuine factual dispute {{on the issue}} and thus overturning the summary judgement initially granted by the district court, Flaum echoed one of Scalia's criticisms in a footnote. [...] "Waters provides little direct guidance as to {{the division of labor}} between judge and jury <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> one," [...] he observed. [...] "The critical question that, to this point, remains unanswered requires an assessment of the defendants' subjective motivation, a classic jury issue." ...|$|E
5|$|Johnson: <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>like</b> that, yes.|$|R
6000|$|... "In a {{commercial}} civilization like ours {{any sort of}} suspicion can attach to any sort of man <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>like</b> this," [...] said Matt.|$|R
6000|$|... "And do {{you come}} to such effete posterity as we are for help <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>like</b> that?" [...] demanded Corey. [...] "Why, the boy's an Ancestor!" ...|$|R
2500|$|... "In {{the final}} analysis," [...] he wrote, [...] "a Justice's vote <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> depends more {{on his or}} her views about the {{respective}} lawmaking responsibilities of Congress and this Court than on conflicting policy interests. Judges who have confidence in their own ability to fashion public policy are less hesitant to change the law than {{those of us who are}} inclined to give wide latitude to the views of the voters' representatives on nonconstitutional matters." [...] While he had admittedly helped start the discussions about the various interpretations of Wilko in his dissent in Scherk v. Alberto-Culver, Inc. while chief judge of the Seventh Circuit, he said [...] "one of these arguments, however, carries sufficient weight to tip the balance between judicial and legislative authority and overturn an interpretation of an Act of Congress that has been settled for many years." ...|$|E
60|$|You can't act <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> {{as if you}} 'd only a {{principle}} to consider. It 's the--the special circumstances.|$|E
6000|$|... "No reports made <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>like</b> <b>this.</b> Our rule {{is to just}} {{decide the}} thing and {{announce}} the final decision, whether it's unanimous or not." ...|$|E
6000|$|The other fellow grinned. [...] "'Peared {{to me like}} you'd made a mistake, but I couldn't blame you. Feller has to act quick <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>like</b> that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I know that. Come {{with me to}} Uriah Dicks', and I'll {{tell him}} about the matter. Uriah will stand by us, I know, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>like</b> this." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Haven't {{you ever}} {{voted for a}} Republican?" [...] asked the girl. [...] "Don't you think it better {{to vote for the}} best man, rather than the best party, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>like</b> this?" ...|$|R
6000|$|I had an {{accident}} insurance on my life. Would it hold good <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>like</b> <b>this?</b> Or would Euphemia {{have to go back}} to her father? ...|$|E
60|$|Now, {{as we have}} said, {{there are}} three grades in the kind and {{character}} of the measures which may be considered violent that a mother may resort to <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>like</b> <b>this.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Thanks for the compliment, Freddie; but I should {{imagine that}} {{something}} a little more solid than a persuasive way would be required <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>like</b> <b>this.</b> You said something a while ago about five hundred pounds?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, I'm not sure," [...] {{said the}} master, graciously, [...] "whether your way might not do <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>like</b> that. It's crude, of course, {{but with a}} few changes it would do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{said her}} husband, [...] "I did not. I {{required}} more than speed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>like</b> that. And now I think," [...] said he, rising, [...] "we must call this session concluded." ...|$|R
50|$|There are {{differences}} in respect of what kinds of types are used. The bacteriological code prefers living type cultures, but allows other kinds. There has been ongoing debate regarding which kind of type is more useful <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>like</b> cyanobacteria.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Prosser,' he said, 'you are {{a man of}} the world, and I {{should like}} your advice. What would you do <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>like</b> <b>this?</b> I go to a theatre to see a play, and what do I find?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll {{remember}} it, auntie," [...] I said, wearied {{out with}} excitement. [...] "But I {{think you did}} wrong, all the same. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> it's everybody's first duty to tell all he knows, {{in the interests of}} justice." ...|$|E
6000|$|Strangest {{of all to}} think, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> of {{the people}} who were left behind, or in some way or other {{prevented}} from going, and always afterwards told of how they had escaped being on board the Mariposa Belle that day! ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'There now! What {{can be done}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>like</b> that?' cried he despairingly. 'She {{should have}} rushed in from the wings and thrown herself upon your bosom. I have seen such a {{situation}} earn three rounds from the pit. There is good material spoiling here for want of some one to work it up.' ...|$|R
60|$|He {{shifted his}} foot nervously {{as he made}} the bold request. Anne felt at once that she would go. There was nobody in the world whose care she would more readily be under than the trumpet-major's <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>like</b> the present. He was their nearest neighbour's son, and she had liked his single-minded ingenuousness from the first moment of his return home.|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{seems to}} be the general opinion. That's what Mr. Westover advised. I seem to be the only one against it. I suppose you mean that I'm not fit for Cynthy. I don't deny it. All I say is I want her, and I don't want the other one. What {{are you going to do}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>like</b> that?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now what," [...] pondered Mike, [...] "would A. J. Raffles {{have done}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>like</b> <b>this?</b> Suppose he'd been after somebody's jewels, {{and found that}} they were after him, and he'd locked one door, and could get away by the other." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, then," [...] said my Aunt Martha, [...] "if {{he has a}} {{story to}} tell he ought to be allowed to tell it, even <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>like</b> <b>this.</b> Nobody should be judged until he has said what he thinks he ought to say. Let us hear his story." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{may think}} it strange," [...] said she, [...] "that I talk {{in this way}} to you, but you came here {{to find out what}} sort of girl I am, and I am {{perfectly}} willing to help you do it. Besides, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> I would rather talk to a man than to a woman." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mother {{says there}} is an {{insurance}} on the house and furniture for nine hundred dollars, but she hasn't {{been able to find}} the papers yet, and maybe they have been burned, too. If you can, come down right away. I suppose they don't like to let clerks off in New York, but they ought to make <b>an</b> exception <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>like</b> this." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And you, {{my young}} lord,' said Henry, looking towards Malcolm, whose light touch and tender hands {{had made him}} <b>a</b> welcome {{attendant}} <b>in</b> the illness, 'I have many a kind service to thank you for. And I believe I mightily angered you once; but, boy, remember--ay, and you too, Ralf Percy--that he is your friend who turns you back from things sore to remember <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>like</b> mine!' ...|$|R
5000|$|There was {{an attempt}} made to prevent the {{issuance}} of a marriage license to Mr. Mascarel, but it proved futile, as {{the law does not}} require a license to render the marriage valid <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>like</b> this[...] [...] [...] The desire to have the union made legal was brought about by the failing health of Mrs. Mascarel, who, although twenty years younger than her aged husband, is still a woman far advanced in years.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am sure, {{my young}} friend, {{we are all}} very much indebted to you. The methods which {{sometimes}} are scarcely politic in the ordinary affairs of life," [...] he continued drily, [...] "are admirable enough <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>like</b> <b>this.</b> We will just help Hunterleys tie up {{the leader of the}} gang. A very plucky stroke, that of his." ...|$|E
6000|$|Jackson hesitated. Mr Dexter, {{setting the}} lines on Friday, had {{certainly}} {{said that they were}} to be shown up [...] "tomorrow evening." [...] He had said it very loud and clear. Still, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>like</b> <b>this....</b> After all, by helping to beat the School House on the river he would be giving Dexter's a leg-up. And what more could the man want? ...|$|E
6000|$|My {{idea was}} that, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> it's no good trying opposition. What {{you want is}} to work {{it so that the}} chappie quits of his own accord. You want to egg him on to overdoing the thing till he gets so that he says to himself, [...] "Enough! Never again!" [...] That was {{what was going to happen}} to Harold.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{understand}} you," [...] he said, coldly. [...] "It is true {{that the}} Neapolitan was ready to rescue thee, when the calamity befell thy uncle of Florence, but Don Camillo Monforte is not a common diver of the Lido, to be rewarded like him who finds a bauble dropped from a gondola. Thou hast thanked the cavalier; I trust that a noble maiden can do no more <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>like</b> this." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{said you}} were mighty independent, and I guess he's right; but you needn't be afraid of getting {{any more than you}} pay for. This room couldn't be let to many people, and those who would be willing to live <b>in</b> such <b>a</b> place we would not want in the house, except <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>like</b> yours, where <b>a</b> friend of ours says {{everything}} is as it should be. Mr. Davis is a very nice man." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{efficacy}} of odd-even rationing is debated. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>like</b> gasoline, {{it does not}} actually reduce consumption, since people prevented from filling up one day will just fill up the day before, and vice versa; {{the total number of}} people in line on each day is unchanged. [...] Some propose it has psychological effects like reducing panic buying, discouraging people from making small purchases on a daily basis, or emphasizing the shortage and further discouraging unnecessary trips.|$|R
