5000|$|In law, {{it means}} that a {{property}} or benefit has been enjoyed {{for so long that}} its owner does not have to prove how they came to own it. In English law and its derivatives, time immemorial means the same as time out of mind, [...] "a time before legal history and beyond legal memory". In 1275, by the first Statute of Westminster, the time of memory was limited to the reign of King Richard I, beginning 6 July 1189, the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> the King's accession.

The Emperor Rudolf II, in whose Kingdom of Bohemia the Duchy of Jägerndorf lay, refused to admit Johann as duke and asked for Beuthen and Oderberg as pledges. His successors, Matthias and Ferdinand II, however, took the oath of fealty from Johann in 1611 and 1617.

50|$|In {{common law}} countries, {{possession}} {{is itself a}} property right. The owner of a property has the right <b>of</b> <b>possession</b> and may assign that right wholly or partially to another who may then also assign the right <b>of</b> <b>possession</b> to a third party. For example, an owner of residential property may assign the right <b>of</b> <b>possession</b> to a property manager under a property management contract who may then assign the right <b>of</b> <b>possession</b> to a tenant under a rental agreement. There is a rebuttable presumption that the possessor of property also has the right <b>of</b> <b>possession,</b> and {{evidence to the contrary}} may be offered to establish who has the legal right <b>of</b> <b>possession</b> to determine who should have actual possession, which may include evidence of ownership (without assignment of the right <b>of</b> <b>possession)</b> or evidence <b>of</b> a superior right <b>of</b> <b>possession</b> without ownership. <b>Possession</b> <b>of</b> a thing for long enough can become ownership by termination of the previous owner's right <b>of</b> <b>possession</b> and ownership rights. In the same way, the passage of time can bring to an end the owner's right to recover exclusive <b>possession</b> <b>of</b> a property without losing the ownership of it, as when an adverse easement for use is granted by a court.|$|R
