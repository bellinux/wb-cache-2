5|$|The forward {{exchange}} rate (also referred to as <b>forward</b> <b>rate</b> or forward price) is the exchange rate at which a bank agrees to exchange one currency for another at a future date when it enters into a forward contract with an investor. Multinational corporations, banks, and other financial institutions enter into forward contracts {{to take advantage of}} the <b>forward</b> <b>rate</b> for hedging purposes. The {{forward exchange}} rate is determined by a parity relationship among the spot exchange rate and differences in interest rates between two countries, which reflects an economic equilibrium in the foreign exchange market under which arbitrage opportunities are eliminated. When in equilibrium, and when interest rates vary across two countries, the parity condition implies that the <b>forward</b> <b>rate</b> includes a premium or discount reflecting the interest rate differential. Forward exchange rates have important theoretical implications for forecasting future spot exchange rates. Financial economists have put forth a hypothesis that the <b>forward</b> <b>rate</b> accurately predicts the future spot rate, for which empirical evidence is mixed.|$|E
5|$|This {{equation}} {{represents the}} unbiasedness hypothesis, {{which states that}} the forward exchange rate is an unbiased predictor of the future spot exchange rate. Given strong evidence that CIRP holds, the <b>forward</b> <b>rate</b> unbiasedness hypothesis {{can serve as a}} test to determine whether UIRP holds (in order for the <b>forward</b> <b>rate</b> and spot rate to be equal, both CIRP and UIRP conditions must hold). Evidence for the validity and accuracy of the unbiasedness hypothesis, particularly evidence for cointegration between the <b>forward</b> <b>rate</b> and future spot rate, is mixed as researchers have published numerous papers demonstrating both empirical support and empirical failure of the hypothesis.|$|E
5|$|Other {{rationales}} {{for the failure}} of the <b>forward</b> <b>rate</b> unbiasedness hypothesis include considering the conditional bias to be an exogenous variable explained by a policy aimed at smoothing interest rates and stabilizing exchange rates, or considering that an economy allowing for discrete changes could facilitate excess returns in the forward market. Some researchers have contested empirical failures of the hypothesis and have sought to explain conflicting evidence as resulting from contaminated data and even inappropriate selections of the time length of forward contracts. Economists demonstrated that the <b>forward</b> <b>rate</b> could serve as a useful proxy for future spot exchange rates between currencies with liquidity premia that average out to zero during the onset of floating exchange rate regimes in the 1970s. Research examining the introduction of endogenous breaks to test the structural stability of cointegrated spot and forward exchange rate time series have found some evidence to support <b>forward</b> <b>rate</b> unbiasedness in both the short and long term.|$|E

40|$|<b>Forward</b> and futures <b>rates</b> are {{frequently}} used as measures of market expectations. In this paper we apply standard forecast efficiency tests, and some newer exact sign and rank tests, {{to a wide}} range of <b>forward</b> and futures <b>rates,</b> and in this way test whether these are in fact rational expectations of future actual prices. The <b>forward</b> and futures <b>rates</b> that we study under a common methodology include foreign exchange <b>forward</b> <b>rates,</b> U.

5|$|The {{empirical}} {{rejection of}} the unbiasedness hypothesis is a well-recognized puzzle among finance researchers. Empirical evidence for cointegration between the <b>forward</b> <b>rate</b> and the future spot rate is mixed. Researchers have published papers demonstrating empirical failure of the hypothesis by conducting regression analyses of the realized changes in spot exchange rates on forward premiums and finding negative slope coefficients. These researchers offer numerous rationales for such failure. One rationale centers around the relaxation of risk neutrality, while still assuming rational expectations, such that a foreign exchange risk premium may exist that can account for differences between the <b>forward</b> <b>rate</b> and the future spot rate.|$|E
5|$|Covered {{interest}} rate parity is a no-arbitrage condition in foreign exchange markets which {{depends on the}} availability of the forward market. It can be rearranged to give the forward exchange rate {{as a function of the}} other variables. The forward exchange rate depends on three known variables: the spot exchange rate, the domestic {{interest rate}}, and the foreign interest rate. This effectively means that the <b>forward</b> <b>rate</b> is the price of a forward contract, which derives its value from the pricing of spot contracts and the addition of information on available interest rates.|$|E
5|$|Economists {{have found}} {{empirical}} evidence that covered interest rate parity generally holds, though not with precision {{due to the}} effects of various risks, costs, taxation, and ultimate differences in liquidity. When both covered and uncovered interest rate parity hold, they expose a relationship suggesting that the <b>forward</b> <b>rate</b> is an unbiased predictor of the future spot rate. This relationship can be employed to test whether uncovered interest rate parity holds, for which economists have found mixed results. When uncovered interest rate parity and purchasing power parity hold together, they illuminate a relationship named real interest rate parity, which suggests that expected real interest rates represent expected adjustments in the real exchange rate. This relationship generally holds strongly over longer terms and among emerging market countries.|$|E
50|$|A <b>forward</b> {{interest}} <b>rate</b> {{is a type}} {{of interest}} rate that is specified for a loan that will occur at a specified future date.

40|$|Every maturity-dependent {{derivative}} contract entails a term structure. For example, when {{the value of}} the portfolio consisting of a long position in a stock and a short position in a vanilla option is expressed in units of its instantaneous exercise value, the resulting quantity defines a discount function. Thus, the derivative of the discount function with respect to the time left until maturity defines a term structure density function, and the "hazard rate" associated with the discount function determines the <b>forward</b> <b>rates</b> for the vanilla option portfolio. The dynamics associated with these quantities are obtained in the complete market setting. In particular, one can model vanilla options based on the associated <b>forward</b> <b>rates.</b> The formulation based on <b>forward</b> <b>rates</b> for options extends the approach based on modeling the implied volatility process. As an illustrative example, the initial term structure of the Black–Scholes model is considered.

5|$|The {{equilibrium}} {{that results}} from the relationship between forward and spot exchange rates {{within the context of}} covered interest rate parity is responsible for eliminating or correcting for market inefficiencies that would create potential for arbitrage profits. As such, arbitrage opportunities are fleeting. In order for this equilibrium to hold under differences in interest rates between two countries, the forward exchange rate must generally differ from the spot exchange rate, such that a no-arbitrage condition is sustained. Therefore, the <b>forward</b> <b>rate</b> is said to contain a premium or discount, reflecting the interest rate differential between two countries. The following equations demonstrate how the forward premium or discount is calculated.|$|E

40|$|We {{evaluate}} {{the extent to}} which the explanatory power detected in the term structure in different markets and countries can actually be used to produce sensible forecasts of future short-term interest rates. Specifically, in spite of the forecasting connotation of the unbiasedness property of <b>forward</b> <b>rates,</b> actual evaluation of their forecasting performance has received scant attention in the literature on the term structure. We use monthly data for 1978 - 1998 on interest rates on Eurodeposits on the US dollar, yen, Deutsche mark, British pound, Spanish peseta, French franc, Italian lira and Swiss franc, comparing forecasts obtained from <b>forward</b> <b>rates</b> to those obtained from univariate autoregressions. By themselves, <b>forward</b> <b>rates</b> produce better one-step ahead forecasts, as well as better once-and-for all forecasts of 1 -month interest rates over a full year horizon than those obtained from the own past of interest rates. The gain in one-step ahead forecasting disappears for longer maturities, although <b>forward</b> <b>rates</b> still produce better once-and-for all predictions of 3 - and 6 -month interest rates than univariate autoregressions for a number of currencies.

Two cases are analyzed, firstly when volatility is taken to be a function of the <b>forward</b> <b>rates,</b> and secondly when volatility is taken to be an independent quantum field. Since volatiltiy is a positive valued quantum field, the full theory turns out to be an interacting nonlinear quantum field theory in two dimensions. The state space and Hamiltonian for the interacting theory are obtained, and shown to have a nontrivial structure due to the manifold moving with a constant velocity. The no arbitrage condition is reformulated in terms of the Hamiltonian of the system, and then exactly solved for the nonlinear interacting case. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} that long-term <b>forward</b> interest <b>rates</b> in the U.

This behavior {{is in contrast}} to the prediction of many macroeconomic models, in which the long-run properties of the economy are assumed to be time-invariant and perfectly known by all economic agents: Under those assumptions, the shocks we consider would have only transitory effects on short-term interest rates, and hence would not generate large responses in <b>forward</b> <b>rates.</b> Our empirical findings suggest that private agents adjust their expectations of the long-run inflation rate in response to macroeconomic and monetary policy surprises.

Consistent with our hypothesis, <b>forward</b> <b>rates</b> derived from inflation-indexed Treasury debt show little sensitivity to these shocks, indicating that the response of nominal <b>forward</b> <b>rates</b> is mostly driven by inflation compensation. In addition, we find that in the U.

40|$|Distantly {{maturing}} <b>forward</b> <b>rates</b> {{represent the}} markets long term (risk neutral) expectations about interest rates. As such, {{they are the}} fundamental ingredient of the pricing kernel. In most equilibrium models, interest rates mean revert, and long <b>forward</b> <b>rates</b> are asymptotically constant. However, from US Treasury STRIPs data, <b>forward</b> <b>rates</b> slope increasingly downwards, and do not attenuate in volatility, as maturity increases beyond about 15 years.

We verify this predictable behavior in the STRIPs data, and also in T Bond futures data. We also show that in principle, this predictability can be exploited for profit in the T Bond futures market. Our model also includes the notion that this predictability is not present, when we transform to risk neutral probabilities. This is reasonable, since otherwise, the market would move to obviate this predictability. Also, we are able to verify this directly in the futures data, by identifying the risk neutral drift with the slope of the futures term structure.
