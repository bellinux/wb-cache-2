Different incubation temperatures revealed significant differences among Aspergillus species. The internal <b>human</b> <b>milieu</b> provides the ideal conditions {{for the development of}} invasive disease by Aspergillus fumigatus but restricts invasion by Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus niger. Aspergillus spp. are ubiquitous organisms, progressively as-sociated with a growing spectrum of infections in immunocom-promised hosts (9, 11). Aspergillus fumigatus is responsible for over 90 % of cases of invasive aspergillosis (7). Germination of conidia is the most crucial step in the de-velopment of Aspergillus, as hyphae represent the invasive form (4, 8). Thus, germination rate and hyphal growth represent good indicators of interspecies variability and may be useful in designing potential antifungal compounds (10).

40|$|Peer reviewed“Direct {{experience}} of God”, {{a concept that}} is frequently used by theologians, was a topic Simon Maimela wrestled with in conjunction with his students since its meaning became increasingly complicated through the processes of secularisation. In the 1960 ’s, it was asserted that modern people cannot have a direct {{experience of}} God; albeit one could still live by faith and by commitment to religious values in a world which claimed that “God is dead”. This article explores the concept “experiencing God directly” according to Karl Rahner, who situates a direct experience of God in a human self-transcendent (philosophical-theological) environment.

In this context, sometimes, architecture has a role of purification – for the mind, for the soul, and even for the body – but only for those who understand and believe its message, and in this way, learn how to detach themselves from the profane in which they live, leaving behind the secular and entering the sacred: the fascinating, pure, and complex architectural space. This means in both literally, as well as metaphorically terms, passing through architecture, as an intermediary space between the profane and the sacred, in a place that sometimes exists out of the time.

40|$|Defining {{the role}} of Staphylococcus aureus adhesins in disease {{pathogenesis}} may depend {{on the use of}} bacteria grown in culture media that more closely reflect the <b>human</b> <b>milieu</b> than conventional broth. This study examined the functional effect on S. aureus adhesins following growth in an ex vivo medium containing a complex mixture of human proteins (used peritoneal dialysate) relative to growth in Todd-Hewitt broth. The adherence of S. aureus, cultured in dialysate, to fibronectin and fibrinogen was markedly reduced despite the expresion of full-length ClfA, ClfB, and fibronectin-binding proteins. Growth in dialysate resulted in the acquisition of a surface coat, as visualized by transmission electron microscopy, which was shown to contain fibronectin, fibrinogen, and immunoglobulins. Adherence of S. aureus to fibrinogen following growth in dialysate was significantly reduced by expression of protein A but was restored following growth in immunoglobulin-depleted dialysate. We conclude that bacterial adherence to solid-phase protein is critically dependent on the culture medium, that S. aureus adhesins may become saturated with target protein prior to contact with solid surfaces, and that there is an interaction between fibrinogen-binding proteins and immunoglobulin bound to protein A following contact with host proteins. These findings have important implications for future studies of S. aureus adhesins...|$|R

In this review, we describe the caveats in current practices of extracting and isolating nanoparticles from clinical samples and show {{that they do not}} help truly define the clinical significance of any detected exogenous nano-sized objects. Finally, we suggest a systematic way of tackling these demanding scientific tasks. More specifically, a precise and true qualitative evaluation of nanoparticles in human biological samples still remains difficult to achieve because of various technical reasons. Such a procedure is more refined when the nature of the pollutants is known, like in the case of nano-sized wear debris originating from biomedical prostheses. Nevertheless, nearly all available analytical methods provide unknown quantitative accuracy and qualitative precision due to the challenging physical and chemical nature of nanoparticles. Without trustworthy information to detect and describe the nanoparticulate load of clinical samples, it is impossible to accurately assess its pathological impact on isolated cases or allow for relevant epidemiological surveys on large populations.

40|$|Although the {{plasminogen}} activating equimolar {{complex of}} staphylokinase (STA) with human plasmin is very rapidly inhibited by alpha 2 -antiplasmin, STA {{is a potent}} fibrinolytic agent in a <b>human</b> plasma <b>milieu</b> which contains 1 microM alpha 2 -antiplasmin. In the present study, {{it was found that}} the complex of plasmin with recombinant STA (STAR), after neutralization with alpha 2 -antiplasmin, retained the full plasminogen activating potential of STAR when added to a plasminogen solution (93 +/- 5 % residual activity). When added to human plasma containing a 125 I-fibrin-labeled plasma clot, equi-effective concentrations (causing 50 % lysis in 2 h) were 17 +/- 3. 0, 13 +/- 1. 0, and 20 +/- 1. 0 nM for STAR, equimolar plasmin-STAR mixtures, and plasmin-STAR mixtures neutralized by alpha 2 -antiplasmin, respectively. Gel filtration of mixtures of plasmin(ogen) and STAR revealed elution as plasmin-STAR complex (Mr approximately 100, 000), whereas after addition of alpha 2 -antiplasmin, STAR eluted with an apparent Mr of 20, 000. When mixtures of plasmin and STAR were adsorbed to lysine-Sepharose, STAR adsorbed quantitatively (96 +/- 1 %) to the gel, whereas it was nearly quantitatively recovered in the unbound fraction (92 +/- 4 %) after addition of alpha 2 -antiplasmin to the mixture. Scatchard analysis of the binding of STAR to plasmin-Sepharose yielded a dissociation constant of 55 nM, whereas no specific binding of STAR to plasmin-alpha 2 -antiplasmin-Sepharose could be demonstrated. These findings indicate that, both in purified systems and in a <b>human</b> plasma <b>milieu</b> containing a 125 I-fibrin-labeled plasma clot, neutralization of the plasmin-STAR complex by alpha 2 -antiplasmin results in dissociation of functionally active STAR from the complex and recycling of STAR to other plasminogen molecules.

40|$|Using the {{discourse}} of Shaykh Muhammad Mahdi Shams al-Din, {{this article examines the}} contestation of sovereignty in Lebanon. His discourse on questions of sovereignty and agency offers an alternative vision of modernity that is part of an evolving struggle in the Lebanese political system. Lebanon’s consociational democratic system of structured political sectarianism necessitated an enmeshed and interactive theological, organizational, and political response. The article asks how political and ideational challenge – in the sense of empowering a disempowered group – occurs within a dominant political system of democratic exclusion? In addition, the geo-political reality of diminished state-level sovereignty, both vis-à-vis regional and international powers and domestically, in state institutions, functions, and relations, begs the question of how conditions of structured exclusion affect the state’s ability to act autonomously and {{in the interests of the}} majority of its citizens? I argue that Shams al-Din’s discourse sought to reform the status quo by emphasizing a post-sectarian accommodative vision. The essence of this vision emphasized the role of the resistant struggle (al-muqawama) for truth, justice, and inclusiveness as integral to the achievement of muwatana or citizenship (ownership / voice in the nation-state) as well as nationalist sovereignty, both of which he contextualized historically and politically within open and constructive relationships with their broader Arab, Islamic, and <b>Human</b> <b>milieus.</b> Shams al-Din’s idealistic but politically-engaged vision drew on the Sunni concept of (consultation) shura and traditional Shi‘i texts to frame just rule as an aspirational struggle and as a post-sectarian framework for political and societal organization based on taqrib (drawing closer, searching for commonalities) that stretches beyond borders. This vision outlined an interactive and interdependent relationship whereby national sovereignty is fortified for being embedded in its society and in the agency of its citizens, and vice versa...|$|R

40|$|Naked DNA is a {{non-toxic}} vector for {{therapeutic gene}} delivery. However, current methods of transfection with naked DNA reach a {{limited range of}} susceptible tissues and have a low efficiency. The transfection of clinically important post-mitotic cells is particularly challenging because in these cells DNA need to pass the nuclear barrier. Thus, new principles for the transfer of naked DNA into human cells are required {{and can be found}} among the genetic exchange mechanisms in bacteria, where gene entry into cells via pick-up and transfer of naked DNA is known as “transformation”. In a number of bacteria, dedicated molecular machinery facilitates cell entry of free DNA by the process of “natural transformation”. In transformation-competent bacterial cells, specialised protein complexes mediate the binding of free double-stranded DNA, its fragmentation, cell entry and conversion to single-stranded DNA. I propose to exploit bacterial natural transformation machinery for a two-step transfection of human cells with therapeutic naked DNA. Firstly, the bacterial transformation protein complexes are inserted into the plasma membranes or nuclear envelopes of the target human cells and, secondly, the double-stranded vector DNA is supplied for the processing by the installed DNA transfer apparatus. I hypothesize that non-toxic bacterial transformation complexes residing in their new <b>human</b> <b>milieu</b> can promote the ultra-efficient transfer of exogenous therapeutic naked DNA. As the introduction of DNA into mammalian cells by non-viral means is called “transfection”, I propose to name the bacterial transformation complexes functioning in their new eukaryotic surroundings as “transfectosomes”. The initial step of the gene delivery should exploit the modern methods of extraneous protein insertion into mammalian cells, such as cell painting, engineering of cell permeable proteins with targeted intracellular localization, physical techniques of protein transfer like electroinsertion and electroporation. Sequence-selective natural transformation systems are known and can be taken advantage of to exclude undesired (e. g. gene silencing) portions of vector DNA from entering human nucleoplasm. Improved transfectosomes can possibly be engineered for better establishment and performance in human membranes. The hypothesis can be tested by comparing the naked DNA transfer efficiency into the transfectosome-bearing and the naive human cells in ex-vivo and in-vivo gene therapy settings. Immunogenicity of the transfectosomes can be modulated by protein engineering. As the delivered fragments of single-stranded DNA are highly recombinogenic, the confirmation of the hypothesis can lead to a breakthrough in gene repair therapy of dominantly inherited familial hypercholesterolemia, polycystic kidney disease and trinucleotide repeat disorders.

40|$|Narratives of {{mourning}} and healing {{have become a}} popular discourse in films about animalhuman relationships set in the contemporary East Asian urban milieu. From the mainstream to the arthouse, from micro films to personal documentaries, images of the dying pet have triggered poignant revelations about human existence. While most of these films focus {{on the process of}} how the human protagonists come to the enlightening moment of self-understanding through the grieving experience, the deaths of their animal companions are often the imperative origins of such self-making. Interestingly, the cause of these animals’ loss is either evaded by or mirrored through human illness in these cinematic Bildungsromane. Given such a lacuna in the interpretive context, how do we read these textual animals who are dying in the arms of their fragile human companions? How do the interspecies life-and-death stories illuminate the dialectics of alienation and intimacy of the city dwellers? How does the claustrophilic timespace of the cinematic medium articulate and habituate these affective stories of failures and recovery? How do we produce a critical reflection on the imaginary of vulnerability, the ethics of care, and fabulations of inadequacy and sentimentality in the cosmopolitan East Asian cities where pet-keeping is becoming en vogue and a sign of economic prosperity? Through a comparative study of Quill (dir. Yochi Sai, Japan, 2004), Gu Gu The Cat (dir. Isshin Inudo, Japan, 2008), and This Darling Life (dir. Angie Chen, Hong Kong, 2008), this paper attempts to examine the urban phenomenon that while animals have become vital participants of everyday life, human beings are facing a (de) pressing need to rethink their affective network with these nonhuman urban residents. These stories of failures – the failure of language in articulating the loss of the animal other in the <b>human</b> <b>milieu</b> as well as the failure of knowing oneself until the inconceivable moment of loss and death – signify the therapeutic journey in which the seeking of interpretation beyond language becomes an essential process toward a more limpid subjectivity both within and outside the narrative chronotope.

40|$|In {{order to}} obtain more {{information}} on the mechanism of plasminogen activation by staphylokinase (STA), we have studied the interaction between recombinant STA (STAR) and different molecular forms of human plasminogen, including Glu-plasminogen (native moiety), Lys-plasminogen (partially degraded moiety) and low-molecular-mass (LMM) plasminogen (moiety lacking kringles 1 - 4). Addition of 2 microM STAR to 0. 4 microM Glu-plasminogen, Lys-plasminogen or LMM plasminogen resulted in the generation of proteolytic activity towards the chromogenic substrate D-Val-Leu-Lys-NH-PhNO 2 (S- 2251) corresponding to the exposure of 1 active center/plasminogen molecule. Complex formation was associated with conversion of the one-chain plasminogen moieties to two-chain plasmin, and with quantitative conversion of Glu-plasminogen to Lys-plasmin. The stoichiometry of the plasminogen-STAR complex, determined by binding of the complex to Lys-Sepharose and measurement of residual STAR, was found to be equimolar. The plasminogen-STAR complexes were inhibited by alpha 2 -antiplasmin with second-order rate constants of 2. 4 +/- 0. 17 x 10 (6) M- 1 s- 1 for Glu-plasminogen, 2. 4 +/- 0. 21 x 10 (6) M- 1 s- 1 for Lys-plasminogen and 9. 4 +/- 1. 5 x 10 (4) M- 1 s- 1 for LMM plasminogen. Glu-plasmin-STAR, Lys-plasmin-STAR and LMM plasmin-STAR had comparable catalytic efficiencies (kcat/Km) for the activation of Glu-plasminogen (0. 24 - 0. 29 microM- 1 s- 1), Lys-plasminogen (0. 57 - 0. 79 microM- 1 s- 1) or LMM plasminogen (0. 11 - 0. 16 microM- 1 s- 1). In a <b>human</b> plasma <b>milieu</b> in vitro STAR, Glu-plasmin-STAR, Lys-plasmin-STAR and LMM-plasmin-STAR were equally effective for the lysis of 125 I-fibrin-labeled human plasma clots [50 % clot lysis in 2 h (EC 50) with 11 - 13 nM test compound] and equally fibrin-selective (residual fibrinogen levels of 72 - 84 % after 2 h at EC 50). Our results thus confirm that plasminogen and STAR form a 1 : 1 stoichiometric complex in which plasminogen is converted to plasmin and Glu-plasminogen to Lys-plasmin. The lysine-binding sites in kringles 1 - 4 of plasminogen are not required for the complex formation with STAR, nor for the enzyme activity of the complex with STAR in purified systems and in a <b>human</b> plasma <b>milieu.</b> The lysine-binding sites are, however, important for the rate of the inhibition of the complexes by alpha 2 -antiplasmin. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{examines}} the religious topography of Arcadia through two particular aspects: the built {{and the natural}} landscape, and how each relates to human communities, their places of living, and {{their understanding of the}} world around. It relies on the assumption commonly made in the field that, since ritual practice was of prevalent importance for the Greeks, cult sites are the most important places for the communities, and therefore they can tell us a lot about the people who built, visited and looked after them. The first part rests on the acknowledgement that sanctuaries are places of interaction for a certain community of cult (which can but need not overlap with a given polis) and explores how they can be indicators of social change, defined here as responses to changes with large impact on the <b>human</b> <b>milieu.</b> These changes and their response articulated in sacred space are identified in four chapters. The first sets the stage and surveys the known sacred sites of Arcadia {{at the end of the}} Bronze Age and during the Early Iron Age. The second looks at how the building of temples after the eighth century indicates a significant change in the way communities were structured in Arcadia. The third looks at how Arcadian sanctuaries responded to the increased religious mobility of the Classical and Hellenistic period. Finally, chapter four evaluates the impact of the Roman conquest on Arcadian religious sites. The second part explores how myths and rationalising discourses allowed the Greeks to make sense of the salient characteristics and numen of their surrounding natural landscape. Each of the three chapters departs from a situation observed in Arcadia by ancient sources and {{examines the}} responses articulated to explain it. Among the variety of topics to pursue, three have been selected because they exemplify a typical characteristic of Arcadia: its wetness. They also allow spatial areas that were less prominent in part one to be explored. The first chapter investigates the attribution of Mycenaean waterworks in Arcadia to Herakles in myth. The second chapter examines the connection made in ancient sources between Poseidonâs lordship over the Peloponnese, earthquakes, floods and cults of Poseidon Hippios in Arcadia. Finally, the last chapter explores the apparent contradiction of having infernal rivers observable in the world of the living, such as the Styx flowing in the Aroania Mountains. </p...|$|R

In a <b>human</b> plasma <b>milieu</b> in vitro, consisting of a radiolabelled human plasma clot submerged in plasma, 50 % clot lysis in 2 h required 6. 5 micrograms/ml [Ala 279]rscu-PA or 3. 4 micrograms/ml rscu-PA, whereas with both deletion mutants no significant clot lysis was observed with up to 16 micrograms/ml. Treatment of [Ala 279]rscu-PA or rscu-PA with plasmin resulted in quantitative conversion to two-chain molecules and was associated with an increase in specific amidolytic activity from about 600 IU/mg to 62. 5 IU/micrograms for [Ala 279]rscu-PA as compared to an increase from about 0. 3 IU/micrograms to 75. 0 IU/micrograms for rscu-PA.

Therefore, variants of recombinant scu-PA (rscu-PA) were produced by transfecting Chinese hamster ovary cells with cDNA encoding rscu-PA N 302 Q (rscu-PA with Asn- 302 to Gln mutation), rscu-PA C 279 A,N 302 Q (rscu-PA with Cys- 279 to Ala and Asn- 302 to Gln mutations) or rscu-PA del(N 2 -F 157) C 279 A,N 302 Q (rscu-PA C 279 A,N 302 Q with deletion of Asn- 2 through Phe- 157). These mutants were purified to homogeneity from conditioned cell culture medium and were obtained essentially as single chain molecules with specific activities on fibrin plates of (mean +/- S.

Plasmin quantitatively converts rscu-PA N 302 Q and rscu-PA C 279 A,N 302 Q to amidolytically active two-chain derivatives with a specific activity of 56, 000 IU/mg and 32, 000 IU/mg, respectively, as compared to 75, 000 IU/mg for wild-type rscu-PA. Plasminogen activation as a function of time was comparable for rscu-PA N 302 Q and wild-type rscu-PA, and somewhat slower for rscu-PA C 279 A,N 302 Q. In a <b>human</b> plasma <b>milieu</b> in vitro, consisting of a 125 I-fibrin labeled plasma clot submerged in plasma, 50 percent clot lysis in 2 h required 2. 2 micrograms/ml rscu-PA N 302 Q and 6. 0 micrograms/ml rscu-PA C 279 A,N 302 Q, as compared to 3. 2 micrograms/ml wild-type rscu-PA. In contrast, rscu-PA del(N 2 -F 157) C 279 A,N 302 Q was not converted to an amidolytically active two chain derivative by plasmin, and did not induce significant plasminogen activation in purified systems or clot lysis in a <b>human</b> plasma <b>milieu.</b> Following bolus injections in hamsters, the initial half-lives (1. 8 - 2. 6 min) and the plasma clearances (0. 6 - 1. 5 ml min- 1) were comparable for wild-type rscu-PA and for the three rscu-PA mutants. These results suggest that the fibrinolytic activity in a plasma milieu in vitro and the in vivo turnover of rscu-PA are not markedly affected by the absence of carbohydrate.

5000|$|On Tagore, a {{collection}} of Chaudhuri’s essays on Rabindranath Tagore, was awarded the Rabindra Puraskar in 2012. ‘Rabindranath Tagore {{is widely regarded as}} a romantic poet, speaking of beauty and truth; as a transcendentalist; a believer in the absolute; a propagandist for universal man. But, as Amit Chaudhuri shows in these remarkable and widely admired essays about the poet and his <b>milieu,</b> his secret <b>concern</b> was really with life, play, and contingency, with the momentary as much as it was with the eternal. It is this strain of unacknowledged modernism, as well as a revolutionary life-affirming vision, that gives his work, Chaudhuri argues, its immense power. Acute, challenging, and path-breaking, Amit Chaudhuri’s collection will become a classic reading of Rabindranath Tagore and the way he is perceived today.’ Pankaj Mishra praised the book, saying, Few have written as well as Amit Chaudhuri on Tagores aesthetics ... in On Tagore.|$|R

A heterodisperse group of lower-molecular-mass antigens (approximately 21 to 39 kilodaltons) was expressed relatively early (less than 19 h) in encystation. In contrast, discrete bands at approximately 66, 78, 92, and 103 kilodaltons only appeared after 24 h of incubation under conditions which lead to production {{of large numbers of}} water-resistant cysts. We also describe {{for the first time the}} appearance of prominent cytoplasmic vesicles, which were the earliest morphologic change in encysting trophozoites observable by light microscopy. Early in encystation, cyst wall antigens were concentrated in these vesicles, as shown by immunocytochemistry, suggesting that the vesicles function in export of cyst wall constituents...|$|R
40|$|The {{inhibitory}} {{effects of}} antifibrinolytic amino acids on clot lysis induced with recombinant staphylokinase (SakSTAR) or with streptokinase (SK) were evaluated in a <b>human</b> plasma <b>milieu</b> in vitro {{and in a}} hamster pulmonary embolism model in vivo. Addition of tranexamic acid to a system composed of 60 microliters 125 I-fibrin-labeled plasma clots submerged in 0. 5 ml human plasma, caused dose-dependent inhibition of lysis; complete lysis in 120 min required 30 nM SakSTAR or 100 nM SK and was reduced to 50 % with 0. 015 mM or with 0. 07 mM tranexamic acid, respectively. Aprotinin also produced dose-dependent inhibition; lysis with SakSTAR or with SK was reduced to 50 % of the control value with 8 KIU/ml or with 10 KIU/ml aprotinin, respectively. Thus, in human plasma in vitro the antifibrinolytic potency of tranexamic acid was 5 -fold higher towards SakSTAR than towards SK, whereas that of aprotinin was comparable towards both agents. In hamsters with pulmonary embolism given 0. 063 mg/kg SakSTAR or 0. 20 mg/kg SK over 30 min, the antifibrinolytic potency of tranexamic acid, administered as a single bolus injection or as a bolus injection followed by continuous infusion, was 8 - to 10 -fold higher towards SakSTAR than toward SK (50 % reduction of clot lysis with SakSTAR at 12. 5 mg/kg, as compared to 100 - 150 mg/kg with SK). In contrast, aprotinin was equipotent towards SakSTAR and SK (50 % reduction of clot lysis with 2, 000 to 2, 700 KIU/kg). (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{interactions}} of recombinant staphylokinase (SakSTAR) with human platelets were investigated in a buffer <b>milieu,</b> in a <b>human</b> plasma <b>milieu</b> in vitro, and in plasma from patients with {{acute myocardial infarction}} (AMI) treated with SakSTAR. In a buffer milieu, the activation rate of plasminogen by SakSTAR or streptokinase (SK) was not significantly altered by addition of platelets. Specific binding of SakSTAR or SK to either resting or thrombin-activated platelets was very low. ADP-induced or collagen-induced platelet aggregation in platelet-rich plasma (PRP) was 94 +/- 2. 7 % or 101 +/- 1. 7 % of control {{in the presence of}} 0. 1 to 20 microM SakSTAR, with corresponding values of 95 +/- 2. 8 % or 90 +/- 4. 6 % of control in the presence of 0. 1 to 4 microM SK. No effects were observed on platelet disaggregation. ATP secretion following collagen-induced platelet aggregation was 4. 3 +/- 0. 26 microM for SakSTAR (at concentrations of 0. 1 to 20 microM) and 4. 4 +/- 0. 35 microM for SK (at concentrations of 0. 1 to 4 microM), as compared to 3. 4 +/- 0. 70 microM in the absence of plasminogen activator. Fifty % lysis in 2 h (C 50) of 60 microliters 125 I-fibrin labeled platelet-poor plasma (PPP) clots prepared from normal plasma or from plasma of patients with Glanzmann thrombasthenia and immersed in 0. 5 ml normal plasma, was obtained with 12 or 16 nM SakSTAR and with 49 or 40 nM SK, respectively.

40|$|The paper {{claims that}} {{conspiracy}} theories in Bulgaria are organized as a milieu {{rather than as}} a genre, and that, depending on their intensity, conspiracy theories can perform heterogeneous functions, which range from justification of political claims and popular mobilization to entertainment. Building on that conceptual framework, the paper illustrates the most prominent functional types of Bulgarian conspiracy theories. The higher-intensity theories are exemplified by the narratives of corruption and of the afterlife of the former communist secret services. The lower-intensity theories are illustrated by the fortunately short-lived question if the president of the United States has been abducted by aliens. The impact of the Bulgarian conspiratorial milieu on global theories is represented by the example of the Bulgarian modifications of the traveling narrative of the conspiracy of Jewish bankers. The emancipatory potential of the conspiracy theories is demonstrated by the example of the 2011 anti-GMO protests, motivated by narratives of conspiracy between the government and transnational corporations, which derived their energy from the associated <b>milieu</b> of ecological <b>concerns...</b>|$|R
40|$|Macrophages can be {{polarized}} into M 1 and M 2 macrophages {{based on}} {{the composition of the}} <b>milieu.</b> <b>Human</b> macrophages have been poorly characterized. In this study, various macrophage subsets were generated by treating monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) with IFNγ (M 1), IL- 4 (M 2 a), LPS and IL- 1 β (M 2 b) or IL- 10 (M 2 c) which were characterized with respect to their cell surface marker profile and functional profile in the context of cytokine production, susceptibility to HIV infection and apoptosis. Each polarization state demonstrated a unique cell surface marker profile and cytokine profile. In addition M 1 macrophages were shown to produce IFNγ post TLR stimulation. Moreover, M 1 macrophages were highly sensitive to apoptosis following Smac mimetic treatment. Furthermore, M 2 a and M 2 c macrophages were resistant to apoptosis, induced by PI 3 K blockage and IAPs degradation respectively, {{and at the same time}} supported productive HIV infection unlike the other macrophage subsets.

40|$|A {{recombinant}} chimeric plasminogen activator {{consisting of}} a humanized monoclonal antibody specific for cross-linked human fibrin (MA- 15 C 5 Hu) and a 32 kDa single-chain urokinase-type plasminogen activator (scu-PA- 32 k) comprising amino acids Leu 144 -Leu 411, MA- 15 C 5 Hu/scu-PA- 32 k, was previously {{found to have a}} 12 -fold higher fibrinolytic potency than recombinant scu-PA- 32 k towards a human plasma clot in a <b>human</b> plasma <b>milieu</b> in vitro (Vandamme et al., Eur J Biochem 1992; 205 : 139 - 46). Therefore, the thrombolytic and pharmacokinetic properties of MA- 15 C 5 Hu/scu-PA- 32 k were compared with those of recombinant single-chain urokinase-type plasminogen activator (scu-PA) in 3 different venous thrombosis models in vivo. In hamsters with a pulmonary embolus {{consisting of a}} human plasma clot, the thrombolytic potency (% lysis per dose in mg/kg administered) of MA- 15 C 5 Hu/scu-PA- 32 k was 23 -fold higher than that of scu-PA (p less than 0. 0005). In rabbits with a jugular vein clot prepared from human plasma, the thrombolytic potency of MA- 15 C 5 Hu/scu-PA- 32 k was 11 -fold higher than that of scu-PA (p = 0. 012). In baboons with an autologous whole blood clot in the femoral vein, the chimera had a 5 -fold higher thrombolytic potency than scu-PA. In all three animal species, the clearance of the chimera was 10 - to 27 -fold reduced as compared to scu-PA. The specific thrombolytic activity (% lysis per micrograms/ml steady-state plasma u-PA antigen) was increased up to 7 -fold with MA- 15 C 5 Hu/scu-PA- 32 k as compared with scu-PA, which is indicative of targeting of the chimera to the clot. No fibrinogen breakdown or alpha 2 -antiplasmin depletion was observed during thrombolysis with the chimera. Thus, MA- 15 C 5 Hu/scu-PA- 32 k constitutes a recombinant chimeric plasminogen activator with a significantly enhanced thrombolytic potency in 3 different animal models of venous thrombosis. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Philosophical self-reflexion is {{a healthy}} {{practice}} of any science including psychology. Nevertheless, psychology has long ago outgrew {{the age of the}} search for its own identity. It is however a science sui generis, determined by a radical split into Lockean and Kantian (objective and phenomenological) paradigm, each completely legitimate but also completely different in defining the objectives as well as the methods of research. That internal splitting is presented in all psychological disciplines. In social psychology, social constructivism emerged decades ago as a typical disciplinary "paradigm" (although subordinated to both previously mentioned paradigms). The present contribution is aimed to show that social constructivism could be effectively merged with the theoretical frame of cognitivism, dominant theoretical orientation in contemporaneous psychology. On the other hand, social constructivism failed to understand the proper relationship between human nature and human cultural context. Human beings are evolutionary evolved as beings genetically programmed for the construction of the culture and social <b>milieu.</b> <b>Human</b> beings are not products of the culture in the proper sense of meaning. The truth is quite opposite: the culture is a product of human biological equipment. But this is an equipment that predisposes human individual to be a social, cultural being uniquely capable of learning, uniquely capable of receiving the influence of his own products &# 8211; social environment and culture...|$|R
40|$|Multiple myeloma (MM) cells induce {{relevant}} angiogenic effects {{within the}} <b>human</b> bone marrow <b>milieu</b> (huBMM) by the aberrant expression of angiogenic factors. Hypoxia triggers angiogenic events within the huBMM and the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor- 1 α (HIF- 1 α) is over-expressed by MM cells. Since synthetic miR- 199 a- 5 p mimics negatively regulates HIF- 1 α, we here investigated a miRNA-based therapeutic strategy against hypoxic MM cells. We indeed found that enforced expression of miR- 199 a- 5 p led to down-modulated expression of HIF- 1 α {{as well as}} of other pro-angiogenic factors such as VEGF-A, IL- 8, and FGFb in hypoxic MM cells in vitro. Moreover, miR- 199 a- 5 p negatively affected MM cells migration, while it increased the adhesion of MM cells to bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) in hypoxic conditions. Furthermore, transfection of MM cells with miR- 199 a- 5 p significantly impaired also endothelial cells migration and down-regulated the expression of endothelial adhesion molecules such as VCAM- 1 and ICAM- 1. Finally, we identified a hypoxia/miR- 199 a- 5 p loop as a potential molecular mechanism responsible of miR- 199 a- 5 p down-regulation in hypoxic MM cells. Taken together our results indicate that miR- 199 a- 5 p has an important role for the pathogenesis of MM and support the hypothesis that targeting angiogenesis via a miRNA/HIF- 1 α pathway may represent a novel potential therapeutical approach for this still lethal diseas...|$|R
40|$|The {{progressive}} ankylosis gene (ank) is a {{transmembrane protein}} that transports intracellular pyrophosphate to the extracellular <b>milieu.</b> <b>Human</b> mutations of ank lead to craniometaphyseal dysplasia, a disease which {{is characterized by}} the overgrowth of craniofacial bones and osteopenia in long bones, suggesting that ANK plays a regulatory role in osteoblast differentiation. To determine the role of ANK in osteoblast differentiation, we suppressed ANK expression in the osteoblastic MC 3 T 3 -E 1 cell line using siRNA and determined the expression of osteoblastic marker genes and the transcription factors osterix and runx 2. In addition, we determined the osteoblastic differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells isolated from the bone marrow of ank/ank mice, which express a truncated, nonfunctional ANK protein, or wild-type littermates. Suppression of ANK expression in MC 3 T 3 -E 1 cells led to a decrease in bone marker gene expression, including alkaline phosphatase, bone sialoprotein, osteocalcin and type I collagen. In addition, osterix gene expression was decreased in ANK expression-suppressed MC 3 T 3 cells, whereas runx 2 expression was increased. Bone marrow stromal cells isolated from ank/ank mice cultured in the presence of ascorbate- 2 -phosphate for up to 35 days showed markedly reduced mineralization compared to the mineralization of bone marrow stromal cells isolated from wild-type littermates. In conclusion, these findings suggest that ANK is a positive regulator of differentiation events towards a mature osteoblastic phenotype...|$|R
40|$|A mutant of {{recombinant}} {{tissue-type plasminogen activator}} (rt-PA), {{obtained by}} deletion of residues Lys 296 to Gly 302 [rt-PA del(K 296 -G 302) ], was previously shown to be resistant to inhibition by plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1 (PAI- 1) (Madison et al, Nature 339 : 721, 1989). This mutant was obtained by expression of its cDNA in Chinese hamster ovary cells and purification to homogeneity from conditioned cell culture medium. It was obtained as a single chain molecule with amidolytic activity, specific fibrinolytic activity, and binding to fibrin and lysine, which were comparable or somewhat {{lower than those of}} wild-type rt-PA obtained in the same expression system. The plasminogen-activating potential of rt-PA del(K 296 -G 302) in the presence of CNBr-digested fibrinogen was about twofold lower than that of wild-type rt-PA. The inhibition rate of rt-PA del(K 296 -G 302) by recombinant PAI- 1 (rPAI- 1) was more than 500 -fold lower than that of wild-type rt-PA. In a <b>human</b> plasma <b>milieu</b> in vitro, rt-PA del(K 296 -G 302) induced dose-dependent lysis of a 125 I-fibrin-labeled plasma clot; equi-effective concentrations (causing 50 % clot lysis in 2 hours) were 0. 28 micrograms/mL and 0. 36 micrograms/mL for mutant and wild-type rt-PA, respectively. In this system, addition of rPAI- 1 to the plasma resulted in a concentration-dependent reduction of the fibrinolytic potency of rt-PA del(K 296 -G 302) and of rt-PA; a 50 % reduction required 2. 4 micrograms/mL and 0. 15 micrograms/mL rPAI- 1, respectively. Continuous infusion of mutant or wild-type rt-PA over 60 minutes in hamsters with a 125 I-labeled plasma clot in the pulmonary artery resulted in dose-dependent clot lysis, with a thrombolytic potency (percent clot lysis per milligram of compound administered per kilogram of body weight) and a specific thrombolytic activity (percent clot lysis per microgram per milliliter steady state rt-PA-related antigen level in plasma) that were not significantly different. Bolus injection in hamsters of 1 mg/kg rPAI- 1 followed by bolus injection of 1 mg/kg rt-PA del(K 296 -G 302) or wild-type rt-PA resulted in neutralization of the thrombolytic potency of wild-type rt-PA, while the mutant retained approximately half of its thrombolytic potency. These results indicate that rt-PA del(K 296 -G 302), with a known resistance to inhibition by rPAI- 1 in purified systems, maintains this property both in a plasma milieu in vitro and in an experimental animal model of thrombolysis in vivo.

40|$|While it is {{acknowledged}} {{that there is}} devastating poverty within certain sectors of Australia's urban areas, low incomes are concentrated in rural areas, where rural sociology has been concerned mostly with (owner-operator) farmer lifestyles and livelihoods. It cannot be denied that commodity prices and seasonal conditions frequently create 'bad times' for farm owners or commodity 'growers'. Nevertheless, this chapter disaggregates the 'rural' epithet - used for all that goes on outside the cities - and separates farm workforces from other categories of rural and urban workers, bringing the farm wage and salary earner (employee) category to the fore. Overall, this chapter addresses two major aspects of agricultural labour: (i) how the employees' conditions {{differ from those of}} their farmer employers and of farm owner-operators who live and work in the same production environment but appear to employ only immediate family members; and (ii) the conditions of life and work of agricultural employees. Data of two types are presented, and the analysis is in three sections. Census data from 1996 (most recent) confirm farm workers as belonging to three class categories (employers, self-employed and employees). Farm workers in aggregate are first compared with other producers, then compared among classes of farm producers. This cross-sectional analysis is enhanced with data from a small national attitude survey, and then two case studies are used to elaborate the limited census information. Conditions of work and living are shown to be poorer for farm employees than for other farm work categories (owner-operator and employer farmers), and their appreciation of their opportunities for economic and social improvement reflects limited capacity for change within their work <b>milieu.</b> Particularly of <b>concern</b> here is farm, local community and legislative response to providing a labour force for harvesting sugarcane and mandarin oranges (tangerines) ...|$|R
