500|$|Most {{subtropical}} cyclones {{form when}} a deep cold-core extratropical cyclone drops {{down into the}} subtropics. [...] The system becomes blocked by a high latitude ridge, and eventually sheds its frontal boundaries as its source of cool and dry air from the high latitudes diverts away from the system. [...] Temperature differences between the 500hPa pressure level, or [...] above ground level, and the sea surface temperatures initially exceed the dry adiabatic lapse rate, which causes an initial round of thunderstorms to form at a distance east of the center. [...] Due to the initial cold temperatures aloft, sea surface temperatures usually need to reach at least [...] for this initial round of thunderstorms. [...] The initial thunderstorm activity moistens up the environment around the low, which destabilizes the atmosphere by reducing the lapse rate needed for convection. [...] When the next shortwave or upper level jet streak (wind maximum within the jet stream) moves nearby, convection reignites closer to {{the center and the}} system develops into a true subtropical cyclone. [...] The average sea surface temperature that helps lead to subtropical cyclogenesis is [...] If the thunderstorm activity becomes deep and persistent, allowing its initial low level warm core to deepen, tropical cyclogenesis is possible. The locus of formation for North Atlantic subtropical cyclones <b>is</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> open ocean; the island of Bermuda is regularly impacted by these systems.|$|E
2500|$|In 2013 a {{class action}} lawsuit was filed against Facebook alleging the company scanned user {{messages}} for web links, translating them to “likes” on the user’s Facebook profile. Data lifted from the private messages was then used for targeted advertising, the plaintiffs claimed. [...] "Facebook's practice of scanning the content of these messages violates the federal Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA {{also referred to as}} the Wiretap Act), as well as California's Invasion of Privacy Act (CIPA), and section 17200 of California's Business and Professions Code," [...] the plaintiffs said. This shows that once information is online it is no longer completely private. [...] It is an increasing risk because younger people are having easier internet access than ever before, therefore they put themselves in a position where it is all too easy for them to upload information, but they may not have the caution to consider how difficult it can be to take that information down once it <b>is</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> open. [...] This is becoming a bigger issue now that so much of society interacts online which was not the case fifteen years ago. [...] In addition, because of the quickly evolving digital media arena, people's interpretation of privacy is evolving as well, and {{it is important to consider}} that when interacting online. [...] New forms of social networking and digital media such as Instagram and Snapchat may call for new guidelines regarding privacy. [...] What makes this difficult is the wide range of opinions surrounding the topic, so it is left mainly up to our judgement to respect other people's online privacy in some circumstances. [...] Sometimes it may be necessary to take extra precautions in situations where somebody else may have a tighter view on privacy ethics. [...] No matter the situation it is beneficial to know about the potential consequences and issues that can come from careless activity on social networks.|$|E

The door shut heavily behind him, with a shudder. He <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning streets of Florence.|$|R

60|$|Supper {{was ready}} for them, and they sat down gladly and partook of the things provided. During the day, to pass the time, Whopper and Tommy had baked a big pan of beans and another of biscuits, and both were good. They had also tried their hand at baking some cake, {{but this was a}} little burned. Yet the boys ate it and {{declared}} it was all right. At home it might have been different, but when one <b>is</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> woods, and doing one's own cooking---well, there is no use in finding fault, that's all.|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose so, to your eyes," [...] {{replied the}} captain. [...] "But you will see, by {{reflecting}} on the subject, that it is, in fact, just the contrary. If a very violent storm comes up when the ship <b>is</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> open sea, it can ordinarily do no harm, only to drive the ship off her course, or perhaps carry away some of her spars or sails. If there is no land in the way, she is in very little danger. But it is very different if a gale of wind comes up suddenly {{in such a place}} as this." ...|$|E

"Yes," [...] said he, after {{reflecting}} {{a moment on}} what his uncle had said, [...] "yes; I see how they can warp by means of anchors, {{where there is a}} bottom which they can take hold of by them; but that is just the same as a shore.

60|$|Life {{in a bank}} is at its {{pleasant}}est in the winter. When all {{the world}} outside is dark and damp and cold, the light and warmth of the place are comforting. There is a pleasant air of solidity about {{the interior of a}} bank. The green shaded lamps look cosy. And, the outside world offering so few attractions, the worker, perched on his stool, feels that he is not so badly off after all. It is when the days are long and the sun beats hot on the pavement, and everything shouts to him how splendid it <b>is</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country, that he begins to grow restless.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is true," [...] was {{the proud}} reply. [...] "The German Navy {{has been a}} long time proving itself. It has done so now. To-day every German citizen is the proudest {{creature}} breathing. He knew before that his armies were invincible. He knows now that his fleet is destined to make his country the mistress of the seas. England's day is over. Her ships were badly handled and foolishly flung into battle. She has lost many of her finest units. Her Navy is to-day a crippled and maimed force. The German fleet <b>is</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> North Sea, waiting for an enemy who has disappeared." ...|$|E

There he had seen the Baron Conrad and six of his men, and that they were eating one of the swine that they had killed and roasted. Maybe," [...] said she, seating herself upon the edge of Otto's couch; [...] "maybe my father will kill thy father, and they will bring him here and let him lie upon a black bed with bright candles burning around him, as they did my uncle Frederick when he was killed." ...|$|E
