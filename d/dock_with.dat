5|$|Lifting off and {{entering}} orbit, Ross attempts to <b>dock</b> <b>with</b> Phoenix. However, Doppelganger experiences a technical malfunction. The shuttle detaches from Phoenix and falls {{through the atmosphere}} towards the Space Centre. EUROSEC is unable to repair the fault from the ground, and Doppelganger crashes into a parked spacecraft. Ross is incinerated in the collision and a chain reaction destroys much of the Space Centre, killing personnel and destroying all records of Ross's presence on the Counter-Earth.|$|E

5|$|On September 29, Walter Schirra, Eisele, and Walter Cunningham {{were named}} {{as the prime}} crew for a second Block I CSM flight, AS-205. NASA planned to follow this with an {{unmanned}} test flight of the LM (AS-206), then the third manned mission would be a dual flight designated AS-278 (or AS-207/208), in which AS-207 would launch the first manned Block II CSM, which would then rendezvous and <b>dock</b> <b>with</b> the LM launched unmanned on AS-208.|$|E
5|$|Launched in January 2001 after a {{short delay}} due to a problem with Mir, on 27 January Progress M1-5 became the last {{spacecraft}} to <b>dock</b> <b>with</b> the station. It spent two months attached to the Kvant-1 module before deorbiting the station on 23 March 2001. Mir re-entered the atmosphere with Progress M1-5 still docked, disintegrating over the Pacific Ocean, with debris falling into the ocean at around 06:00 GMT. During {{the early stages of}} the unmanned Progress M1-5 mission, a manned Soyuz was placed on standby to launch in order to complete the mission if a problem occurred. The decision to deorbit Mir attracted both praise and criticism for Rosaviakosmos, while several campaigns to save the station were conducted.|$|E
5|$|Lunar Orbit Rendezvous (LOR): A single Saturn V could {{launch a}} {{spacecraft}} that {{was composed of}} a mother ship which would remain in orbit around the Moon, while a smaller, two-stage lander would carry two astronauts to the surface, return to <b>dock</b> <b>with</b> the mother ship, and then be discarded. Landing {{only a small part}} of the spacecraft on the Moon and returning an even smaller part to lunar orbit minimized the total mass to be launched from the Earth.|$|E

5|$|Nautical units often play a {{secondary}} role, {{but can be}} essential to victory. Fishing boats are similar to villagers in that they can gather fish. Merchant ships trade resources from the stockpile and exchange it for gold at another player's <b>dock,</b> <b>with</b> the amount of gold earned being relative to the distance between both docks. Transport ships carry land units from one area of land to another. As well as attacking enemy ships, warships can be very effective in attacking land-based units close to the shoreline (because melee units cannot fight back). Warships come either as galleys which fire arrows or triremes which launch bolts or boulders (very effective against buildings near the shoreline).|$|E
5|$|The first prosecutions in {{relation}} to the riot began at Manchester Crown Court on 14 January 1992. The trial was conducted amid tight security, including armed police patrolling the area around the court, body searches for spectators and a specially constructed <b>dock</b> <b>with</b> sides made from bulletproof glass. Nine men went on trial charged with riot under Section 1 of the Public Order Act 1986, with six of them, including Paul Taylor and Alan Lord, also being charged with the murder of Derek White.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{objectives}} of STS-71, launched on June 27, {{called for the}} Space Shuttle Atlantis to rendezvous and perform the first docking between an American Space Shuttle and the station. On June 29, Atlantis successfully docked with Mir, becoming the first US spacecraft to <b>dock</b> <b>with</b> a Russian spacecraft since the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project in 1975. Atlantis delivered Cosmonauts Anatoly Solovyev and Nikolai Budarin, who would form the expedition EO-19 crew, and retrieved Astronaut Norman Thagard and Cosmonauts Vladimir Dezhurov and Gennady Strekalov of the expedition EO-18 crew. Atlantis also carried out on-orbit joint US-Russian life sciences investigations aboard a Spacelab module and performed a logistical resupply of the station.|$|E

5|$|The second {{expedition}} to Mir, EO-2, launched on Soyuz TM-2 on 5 February 1987. During their stay, the Kvant-1 module, launched on 30 March 1987, arrived. It {{was the first}} experimental version of a planned series of '37K' modules scheduled to be launched to Mir on Buran. Kvant-1 was originally planned to <b>dock</b> <b>with</b> Salyut 7; due to technical problems during its development, it was reassigned to Mir. The module carried {{the first set of}} six gyroscopes for attitude control. The module also carried instruments for X-ray and ultraviolet astrophysical observations.|$|E
5|$|Unable to {{maneuver}} the Soyuz to <b>dock</b> <b>with</b> the station, Stone ejects herself via explosive decompression {{and uses a}} fire extinguisher as a makeshift thruster to travel the final metres to Tiangong, which is rapidly deorbiting. Stone then enters the Shenzhou capsule just as Tiangong starts to break up on the upper edge of the atmosphere. Stone radios that she is ready {{to head back to}} Earth. After re-entering the atmosphere, Stone hears Mission Control, which is tracking the capsule and sending a rescue. But due to a harsh reentry and the premature jettison of the heat shield, a fire starts inside the capsule.|$|E
5|$|Big Gemini, or Big G, {{grew out}} of a 1963 {{proposal}} called Gemini Transport, to develop an enlarged Gemini spacecraft with docking capability, which would take advantage of the increased capacity offered by the Saturn IB and Titan IIIM rockets. It was designed to transport between nine and twelve astronauts into space, {{and to be able to}} <b>dock</b> <b>with</b> space stations, in support of Apollo Applications and MOL missions. It would have been launched by a Heavy lift launch vehicle; either a Titan IIIG or Saturn INT-20, the former being intended for use on US Air Force missions and the latter being intended for NASA missions. The Titan IIIM was also considered, which would have launched a smaller version of the spacecraft due to its lower capacity, to resupply MOL space stations later in the program. NASA also proposed several Saturn IB derivatives with solid first stages as alternatives to the INT-20, offering similar payload capacity.|$|E

5|$|Bond survives {{attacks by}} Jaws, Chang's replacement, during Rio Carnival {{and on the}} Sugarloaf Cable Car. After Jaws' cable car crashes, he is rescued from the rubble by Dolly, and the two fall in love. Drax's forces capture Goodhead, but Bond escapes; he learns that the toxin comes from a rare orchid {{indigenous}} to the Amazon jungle. Bond travels the Amazon River while under attack from Drax's forces; he eventually finds Drax's base near Iguazu Falls. Captured by Jaws, Bond is taken to Drax and witnesses four Moonrakers lifting off. Drax explains that he stole the loaned shuttle because another in his fleet had developed a fault during assembly. Bond and Goodhead escape and pose as pilots on Moonraker 6. The shuttles <b>dock</b> <b>with</b> Drax's space station, hidden from radar by a cloaking device.|$|E
5|$|The current Washington Park Lake House {{was built}} in 1929 {{replacing}} the original stick style structure constructed in 1876. It is constructed in the Spanish Revival style with terracotta, terrazzo, brick, and guastavino tile. The area {{in front of the}} lake house has been the site for the performance of plays by the Park Playhouse for over 20 years. A 900-seat amphitheater faces the lake house allowing for comfortable seating for the over 60,000 people who visit every year. A proposal by the city to turn the lake house into a 125-seat restaurant and 200-seat banquet hall with an expanded <b>dock</b> <b>with</b> boat, cross-country ski, and ice skate rentals failed to materialize {{due to a lack of}} interest from the private business sector.|$|E
5|$|When Shea {{was hired}} by NASA, President John F. Kennedy's {{commitment}} to landing men on the Moon was still only seven months old, {{and many of the}} major decisions that shaped the Apollo program were yet to be made. Foremost among these was the mode that NASA would use to land on the Moon. When Shea first began to consider the issue in 1962, most NASA engineers and managersincluding Wernher von Braun, the director of the Marshall Space Flight Centerfavored either an approach called direct ascent, where the Apollo spacecraft would land on the Moon and return to the Earth as one unit, or Earth orbit rendezvous, where the spacecraft would be assembled while still in orbit around the Earth. However, dissenters such as John Houbolt, a Langley engineer, favored an approach that was then considered to be more risky: lunar orbit rendezvous, in which two spacecraft would be used. A command/service module (CSM) would remain in orbit around the Moon, while a lunar module would land on the Moon and return to <b>dock</b> <b>with</b> the CSM in lunar orbit, then be discarded.|$|E

5|$|Hansen locates Yusupov, {{who tells}} him that Anna Kamsky, Viktor's daughter, is onboard and must be saved. Yusupov had brought her to Sakhalin to {{blackmail}} Viktor into turning the exocels into biological weapons. Eventually, Viktor and his colleague, Dr. Pavel Bakharev, began to experiment on live human infection, and the Eastern Spirit {{was on its way}} from the Sakhalin to collect the next batch of human specimens supplied by the Mafia when the exocel outbreak occurred. An exocel then bursts out of Yusupov's chest, killing him. Hansen finds Anna, who tells them they must go to the radio room and contact her father. They contact the rig, but Bakharev tells Anna that Kamsky is missing and pleads with her not to return. She says no, telling Bakharev she will see him soon. They turn the ship back towards the Sakhalin but because the seas are so rough, they are unable to <b>dock</b> <b>with</b> the platform. As such, they head to the crow's nest and jump from the ship when it collides with the rig. Hansen makes the jump, but Anna falls into the sea.|$|E
5|$|The {{unmanned}} Progress cargo {{vehicles were}} only used to resupply the station, carrying {{a variety of}} cargoes including water, fuel, food and experimental equipment. The spacecraft were not equipped with reentry shielding and so, unlike their Soyuz counterparts, were incapable of surviving reentry. As a result, when its cargo had been unloaded, each Progress was refilled with rubbish, spent equipment and other waste which was destroyed, along with the Progress itself, on reentry. In order to facilitate cargo return, ten Progress flights carried Raduga capsules, which could return around 150kg of experimental results to Earth automatically. Mir was visited by three separate models of Progress; the original 7K-TG variant equipped with Igla (18 flights), the Progress-M model equipped with Kurs (43 flights), and the modified Progress-M1 version (3 flights), which together flew a total of 64 resupply missions. Whilst the Progress spacecraft usually docked automatically without incident, the station was equipped with a remote manual docking system, TORU, in case problems were encountered during the automatic approaches. With TORU cosmonauts could guide the spacecraft safely in to <b>dock</b> (<b>with</b> {{the exception of the}} catastrophic docking of Progress M-34, when the long-range use of the system resulted in the spacecraft's striking the station, damaging Spektr and causing decompression).|$|E
