5|$|There is some {{evidence}} that there were at least two inns during the 18th century, although their precise locations and names are unknown. In 1827, Parson and White's Directory listed the Brown <b>Jug,</b> adjoining Carr Hill Pottery at Carr Hill Lane and it is likely that this venue is one of those earlier inns. The second is likely the Old Fellows Inn, located near the Brown <b>Jug</b> at Carr Hill Lane, listed in 1844, but later listed as 'The Free Gardeners Arms". By 1856, both the Brown <b>Jug</b> and the Free Gardeners Arms were well established and thriving and continued to prosper well into the 20th century, under the slightly different names of The Old Brown <b>Jug</b> and The Gardeners Arms.|$|E

50|$|<b>Jugged</b> hare and <b>jugged</b> rabbit are {{dishes that}} {{involves}} stewing an entire hare or rabbit {{that has been}} cut at the joints in a process called <b>jugging.</b> The blood of the hare or rabbit is traditionally included in <b>jugged</b> hare, which serves to thicken and enrich the dish. Additional ingredients in both dishes include typical stew ingredients such as vegetables and spices. Wine, such as Port, and juniper berries are used in <b>jugged</b> hare. <b>Jugged</b> hare is a traditional dish in Great Britain and France, and {{used to be a}} staple food in Great Britain. <b>Jugged</b> hare is included in early editions of the book The Art of Cookery made Plain and Easy. The book was first published in 1747.|$|R
50|$|In the Roadblock, teams made a {{traditional}} milk delivery {{by means of}} Bernese Mountain Dog. After picking a dog, one team member guided their dog pulling a cart carrying two empty milk <b>jugs,</b> {{to one of two}} gondola stations. After unloading the milk <b>jugs</b> and riding the gondola to the top station, teams carried the milk <b>jugs</b> to the dairy farm for that tramway and traded the empties for full <b>jugs.</b> The team member then carried the full <b>jugs</b> back to the gondola and down to their dog, before bringing the dog and full milk <b>jugs</b> to the milk truck for their next clue.|$|R

50|$|Face <b>jugs</b> {{were fully}} {{functional}} pieces that served the practical purpose of holding and pouring liquid. Various slave owner accounts hold that African-American slaves would use their face <b>jugs</b> to carry {{water into the}} fields with them. Other scholars believe that face <b>jugs</b> were used {{as a form of}} self-identification, or a Self-Portrait and perhaps were a way for slaves to deal with their physical displacement and loss of visual worth. Some folklore accounts held that these <b>jugs</b> were used for spiritual, rather than practical, purposes. It is believed that the <b>jugs</b> were buried outside of front and back doors to scare spirits away. It is also claimed that these <b>jugs</b> were used as grave markers and placed atop burial sites surrounded with the possessions of the deceased.|$|R

5|$|Following {{his defeat}} in the Walker Whiskey Trophy events, a number of Rush's admirers and backers held a banquet in his honour, at which they {{presented}} him with an illuminated testimonial along with a sterling silver tea set, salver, and claret <b>jug,</b> valued at £200. These recognised his excellence as a sportsman, and his admirable qualities as a man. The salver was inscribed with a dedication, and each piece bore an inscribed caricature of Rush at the oars of an outrigger skiff.

Crook’s <b>jugs</b> almost exclusively depict demonic and contorted faces. Crook also sculpts fanciful creatures with the same demonic qualities as his <b>jugs.</b> These sculptures often refer to attorneys, judges, or the legal profession to which Crook belongs.|$|R

5|$|In January 1918, Andrić joined several South Slav nationalists in editing a {{short-lived}} pan-Yugoslav periodical called Književni <b>jug</b> (Literary South). Here {{and in other}} periodicals, Andrić published book reviews, plays, verse, and translations. Over {{the course of several}} months in early 1918, Andrić's health began to deteriorate, and his friends believed he was nearing death. However, he recovered and spent the spring of 1918 in Krapina writing Ex ponto, a book of prose poetry that was published in July. It was his first book.|$|E
5|$|In tribal societies, kilim were woven {{by women}} at {{different}} stages of their lives: before marriage, in readiness for married life; while married, for her children; and finally, kilim for her own funeral, to be given to the mosque. Kilims thus had strong personal and social significance in tribal and village cultures, being made for personal and family use. Feelings of happiness or sorrow, hopes and fears were expressed in the weaving motifs. Many of these represent familiar household and personal objects, such as a hairband, a comb, an earring, a trousseau chest, a <b>jug,</b> a hook.|$|E
5|$|She finally narrates {{the story}} of her {{abandonment}} to <b>Jug,</b> who tells her that she fears abandonment so much that she does not allow herself to commit in relationships, leaving before they can leave her. He convinces her that she does not need to forgive her parents for abandoning her, but she can, as an adult, see them as two regular people who made a mistake. After this, Kaira makes an effort to reconcile with her parents and also works to finish her short film.|$|E

5|$|The castle was {{primarily}} built from bricks, with stone {{used for the}} detailing, such as doorways. The brickwork was decorated with patterns of darker bricks, called diapering, which was used to show symbols associated with Lord Hastings, as well as objects such as a <b>jug</b> and a ship. This style of decorative brickwork and stonework was popular across England at this time, but particularly so at Eton College, where John Cowper, the master mason on the project, had been an apprentice. Although the castle was not extensively decorated, the brickwork at Kirby Muxloe was skillfully executed, with the bricklayers cutting and shaping the kiln-fired bricks to produce spiral and domed vaulting.|$|E
5|$|Though most provinces {{were capable}} of {{producing}} wine, regional varietals were desirable and wine was a central item of trade. Shortages of vin ordinaire were rare. The major suppliers {{for the city of}} Rome were the west coast of Italy, southern Gaul, the Tarraconensis region of Hispania, and Crete. Alexandria, the second-largest city, imported wine from Laodicea in Syria and the Aegean. At the retail level, taverns or speciality wine shops (vinaria) sold wine by the <b>jug</b> for carryout and by the drink on premises, with price ranges reflecting quality.|$|E
5|$|As {{the files}} {{converge}} {{on the east}} frieze we encounter the first women celebrants E2–27, E50–51, E53–63. The priestesses carry the sacrificial instruments and paraphernalia including the phiale (phial or <b>jug),</b> oinochoai (wine jars), thymiaterion (incense burner), {{and in the case}} of E50–51, evidently they have just handed the marshal E49 a kanoun, making the girl the kanephoros. The next groups E18–23, E43–46, are problematic. Six on the left and four on the right, if one does not count two other figures who may or may not be marshals, then this group might be taken to be the ten eponymous heroes who gave their names to the ten tribes. Their proximity to the deities indicates their importance, but selecting differently, then nine of them may be the archons of the polis or athlothetai officials who managed the procession; there is insufficient iconographic evidence to determine which interpretation is correct.|$|E

5|$|Ceramics lend {{themselves}} to circular motifs, whether radial or tangential. Bowls or plates can be decorated inside or out with radial stripes; these may be partly figurative, representing stylised leaves or flower petals, while circular bands can run around a bowl or <b>jug.</b> Patterns of these types were employed on Islamic ceramics from the Ayyubid period, 13thcentury. Radially symmetric flowers with, say, 6 petals {{lend themselves}} to increasingly stylised geometric designs which can combine geometric simplicity with recognisably naturalistic motifs, brightly coloured glazes, and a radial composition that ideally suits circular crockery. Potters often chose patterns suited {{to the shape of}} the vessel they were making. Thus an unglazed earthenware water flask from Aleppo {{in the shape of a}} vertical circle (with handles and neck above) is decorated with a ring of moulded braiding around an Arabic inscription with a small 8-petalled flower at the centre.|$|E
5|$|Draught beer's {{environmental}} impact can be 68% lower than bottled beer due to packaging differences. A life cycle study of one beer brand, including grain production, brewing, bottling, distribution and waste management, {{shows that the}} CO2 emissions from a 6-pack of micro-brew beer is about 3 kilograms (6.6 pounds). The loss of natural habitat potential from the 6-pack of micro-brew beer {{is estimated to be}} 2.5 square metres (26 square feet). Downstream emissions from distribution, retail, storage and disposal of waste can be over 45% of a bottled micro-brew beer's CO2 emissions. Where legal, the use of a refillable <b>jug,</b> reusable bottle or other reusable containers to transport draught beer from a store or a bar, rather than buying pre-bottled beer, can reduce the {{environmental impact}} of beer consumption.|$|E
5|$|In his youth, Stojanović wrote poems, {{only one}} of which is published—in a 1918 issue of the {{literary}} magazine Književni <b>jug,</b> whose editor was future Nobel Prize winner Ivo Andrić. For this poem, Stojanović was inspired by the Serbian epic hero Ailing Dojčin. A number of Stojanović's poems are preserved in a notebook that belonged to his closest school friend Todor Ilić. According to the poet Dragan Kolundžija, Stojanović's poems are lyrical miniatures composed in free verse, focused on man and nature, and filled with melancholy. Kolundžija finds that what inspired Stojanović to write poetry is reflected in his verse Krvav je bol (Pain is bloody). According to poet Miroslav Feldman, who first met Stojanović in 1919 in Zagreb, his poems were sad and permeated with a yearning for a brighter, more joyous life.|$|E
50|$|Among <b>Jug's</b> direct disciples {{were the}} famous novelist Vladimir Bartol and Zorko Jelinčič, {{one of the}} co-founders of the militant anti-fascist {{organization}} TIGR. Already in 1925, the two organized the first seminar dedicated to <b>Jug's</b> memory {{in the village of}} Krn near Kobarid, in which they discussed the issues of <b>Jug's</b> voluntaristic world view. Due to the effort of <b>Jug's</b> colleagues, his posthumous fame spread in the intellectual circles of interwar Slovenia. The list of his admirors included the author, politician and diplomat Anton Novačan, the poet Oton Župančič, the playwrights Pavel Golia and Ivan Mrak, and the poet and political activist Edvard Kocbek.|$|R
25|$|Many shapes can be {{used for}} a variety of things, such as <b>jugs</b> (oinochoai) and cups (kylikes). Some, however, have very limited uses; such as the kyathos which is used solely to {{transfer}} wine into these <b>jugs</b> and cups.|$|R
50|$|As Folk art, face <b>jugs</b> {{have become}} a {{significant}} feature {{in the history of}} African-American art. Because formal ceramic skills to create face <b>jugs</b> were taught after America gained its independence, they are regarded as some of the first truly American pieces. Because of their interesting physical characteristics and historical context behind them, face <b>jugs</b> are important examples of African-American art and as the start of a theme of self-identification that would carry into the future.Some use these vessels may have been as political symbols. Most famously, it is believed that Dave the Potter, a slave who worked in the Miles mill where face <b>jugs</b> were made, was himself protesting against his status through ceramic pieces.|$|R
