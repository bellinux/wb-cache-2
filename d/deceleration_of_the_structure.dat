40|$|Driving is a {{task that}} {{requires}} <b>the</b> timely detection <b>of</b> critical events and relevant changes in traffic circumstances. Adaptation of speed and safety margins allows drivers to control the time available to react to potential hazards. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> basic safety margins in driving is the time headway preserved with respect to cars ahead. To avoid rear-end collisions, drivers have to detect <b>decelerations</b> <b>of</b> lead cars. It can be assumed that fast or abrupt <b>decelerations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lead car are detected faster than slow or gradual decelerations. Moreover, expected decelerations are presumably detected faster than unexpected decelerations. Drivers' responses to rather abrupt and more gradual <b>decelerations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lead were investigated in a driving simulator. Situational traffic cues were used to manipulate the driver's expectations. Drivers adjusted <b>the</b> timing <b>of</b> their responses very well to <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> <b>deceleration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lead car. If cues in the environment indicated that the lead car was likely to decelerate, drivers reacted faster. Moreover, drivers increased their headway before the lead car actually started to decelerate, which can be considered an anticipatory response. In general, anticipation allows drivers to maintain their preferred headway and control time pressure in driving...|$|R

In contrast, channels formed of gram-EDA, which exposes one positive charge, and neutral gA channels were insensitive to Konig’s polyanion. The effect strongly depended on <b>the</b> nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> polyanion added, namely: DNA, RNA, polyacrylic acid, and polyglutamic acid were inactive, whereas modified polyacrylic acid induced <b>deceleration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> channel kinetics at high concentrations.

Duration of any physical process measured by decelerating physical time is always longer, than corresponding duration, measured by a scale of invariable uniform Newtonian time.
