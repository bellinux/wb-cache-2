60|$|Razumov trembled {{with rage}} and fear. He was beside himself, but kept <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> <b>low.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Listen," [...] Franks said, <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> <b>low</b> and hard. [...] "We {{must get}} {{back down at}} once. There's {{a lot to get}} started on. All this can be turned to our advantage." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's true I don't {{want you}} to go to America," [...] he said, looking fixedly at the table-cloth. [...] "In fact, my {{feelings}} towards you seem to be utterly and damnably bad," [...] he said energetically, although forced to keep <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> <b>low.</b>|$|E
60|$|Lenore saw {{his throat}} swell. <b>His</b> <b>voice</b> seemed <b>low</b> {{and full of}} emotion.|$|R
60|$|Reist turned {{upon him}} with a sudden violent gesture. <b>His</b> <b>voice</b> was <b>low,</b> but charged with passionate hate.|$|R
60|$|He turns, he gazes on a face {{beauteous}} as a starry night; {{his heart}} is full, <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> is <b>low.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ungenerous, unmanly,' said Guy, <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> <b>low,</b> but quivering with indignation; 'ungenerous to reproach {{him with}} what he so bitterly repented. Could not his penitence, could not his own blood'--but as he spoke, the gleam of wrath faded, the flush deepened on the cheek, and he left the room.|$|E
6000|$|... "Lass, {{it might}} be a {{thousand}} years for all you need worry," [...] he replied, <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> <b>low</b> and full. Then it seemed, as she flung up her arms, that she was about to embrace him. But her gesture was an appeal to the stars, to Heaven above, for something she did not speak.|$|E
60|$|<b>His</b> <b>voice,</b> <b>low,</b> languid, and soft, {{was most}} insinuating, and for hours {{he kept his}} guest talking of the East and its {{industries}} and prejudices; and Berrie and her mother listened with deep admiration, for the youngster had seen {{a good deal of}} the old world, and was unusually well read on historical lines of inquiry. He talked well, too, inspired by his attentive audience.|$|E
60|$|<b>His</b> <b>voice</b> was <b>low,</b> in an awing, {{confident}} {{contrast with}} the headlong emphasis of his movements. He sat down abruptly.|$|R
60|$|Haldin had a subdued, heartbroken attitude. He {{bowed his}} head; his hands hung between <b>his</b> knees. <b>His</b> <b>voice</b> was <b>low</b> and pained but calm.|$|R
6000|$|<b>His</b> <b>voice</b> was <b>low,</b> but {{fiercely}} reproachful in answer. [...] "I {{mean you}} should treat your beautiful self and your splendid art with greater consideration." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{never were}} two happier creatures for twenty-two years," [...] said Dr. May, <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> <b>low</b> with emotion. [...] "Sorrow spared her! Yes, {{think of her}} always in undimmed brightness--always smiling as you {{remember}} her. She was happy. She is," [...] he concluded. His friend had turned aside and hidden {{his face with his}} hands, then looked up for a moment, [...] "And you, Dick," [...] he said briefly.|$|E
6000|$|... [laughing] Nay, nay, I doubt {{not that}} {{he has come to}} tell That I am some great Lord of Italy, And we will have long days of joy together. Within the hour, dear Ascanio. [Exit ASCANIO.] Now tell me of my father? [Sits down on a stone seat.] Stood he tall? I warrant he looked tall upon his horse. His hair was black? or perhaps a reddish gold, Like a red fire of gold? Was <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> <b>low?</b> The very bravest men have voices {{sometimes}} Full of low music; or a clarion was it That brake with terror all his enemies? Did he ride singly? or with many squires And valiant gentlemen to serve his state? For oftentimes methinks I feel my veins Beat with the blood of kings. Was he a king? ...|$|E
60|$|He {{was working}} {{himself up to}} a greater and ever greater passion of fury. He kept <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> <b>low</b> because he didn't want Ignácz Goldstein to hear--not just yet, at any rate--for Ignácz was a hard man and a stern father, and God only knew what he might not do if he was roused. Leopold did not want Klara hurt--not yet, at any rate--not until he was quite sure that she meant to play him {{altogether}} false. She was vain and frivolous, over-fond of dress and of queening it over the peasant girls of the village, {{but there was no}} real harm in her. She was immensely flattered by the young Count's attentions and over-ready to accept his presents in exchange for kisses and whisperings behind closed doors, but there was no real harm in her--so at least Leopold Hirsch kept repeating to himself time and again, whenever jealousy gnawed at his heart more roughly than he could endure.|$|E
60|$|Her {{heart had}} already consented. <b>His</b> <b>voice</b> was <b>low</b> and persuasive, a strange earnestness seemed to vibrate through it, as he begged {{her to come}} with him.|$|R
6000|$|... "You know," [...] he said, and <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> was <b>low</b> and {{difficult}} [...] "I have needed {{you for a}} light. You will soon be the only light again." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{seemed to}} force himself to finish. <b>His</b> <b>voice</b> was very <b>low.</b>|$|R
60|$|Afterwards {{it seemed}} to him that there must have been {{something}} mortally terrifying in his own appearance as he stood there with his back to the wall and his eyes fixed upon the solitary occupant of the room. Lady Letitia, in a blue dressing gown, was lying upon a couch drawn up before a small log fire. There seemed to be no detail of the room which in those sickening moments of mental absorption was not photographed into his memory. The old four-poster bedstead, hung with chintz; the long, black dressing table, once a dresser, covered carelessly with tortoise-shell backed toilet articles, with a large mirror in the centre from which a chair had just been pushed back. But, above all, that look in her face, from which every other expression seemed to have permanently fled. Her lips were parted, her eyes were round with horrified surprise. The book which she had been reading slipped from her fingers and fell noiselessly on to the hearth-rug. She sat up, supporting herself with her hands, one on either side, pressed into the sofa. She seemed denied the power of speech, almost as he was. And then a sudden wonderful change came to him. He spoke quite distinctly, although he kept <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> <b>low.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Inevitably, {{because of}} his close {{association}} with establishment figures and royalty, some people criticised his [...] "hushed tones" [...] style of speaking at state occasions, claiming he was pompous. In an interview he laughed-off such attacks explaining that, {{even though he had}} to use a special microphone which covered his mouth to obviate his speaking disrupting the solemn atmosphere, he still had to pitch <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> <b>low</b> to avoid his voice carrying. A more common touch was demonstrated in his friendly broadcasts like Down Your Way where he met thousands of ordinary people in towns and villages, and the many trade unionists, politicians and industrialists etc. who appeared on Panorama and other programmes. Dimbleby also showed stamina and imperturbability in marathon election night broadcasts which ran from 10.00pm when the polls closed to around 6.00am or 7.00am the following morning.|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{how long}} do you think my voyage is likely to last?" [...] demanded Wilder, {{dropping}} <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> so <b>low</b> as to reach no ears but those of the publican.|$|R
6000|$|Midwinter's face darkened for {{the first}} time. [...] "I am sorry to hear it," [...] he said, <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> sinking <b>low,</b> and <b>his</b> eyes {{dropping}} {{to the ground as}} he spoke.|$|R
60|$|He sunk <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> so <b>low,</b> {{and gazed}} upon {{her with an}} air so stern and strange, that Toby, to divert the current of his thoughts, inquired if his wife were living.|$|R
60|$|<b>His</b> <b>voice</b> was <b>low</b> and unmodulated, as {{of one who}} repeats {{something}} that he has heard before, whilst the eyes suddenly shone as if with a fleeting memory of an exquisite vision.|$|R
6000|$|... "Adrienne!" [...] Leonardo cried, and <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> was <b>low</b> and bitter, [...] "I {{dare not}} ask, and yet I must know. Tell me quickly. Don't torture me. You care for this Englishman?" ...|$|R
6000|$|The haggard {{face turned}} gravely and patiently. 'Only {{one of my}} old headaches.' he smiled, 'my old bilious headaches--the {{hereditary}} Lawford variety.' But <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> fell <b>low</b> again. 'We must get to bed.' ...|$|R
60|$|GEOFFREY [He interposes. <b>His</b> <b>voice</b> is very <b>low,</b> {{almost a}} whisper.] My wife will not sign.|$|R
60|$|Niaz {{was gone}} for three days, as often happened, and on the fourth night, after she had retired to her lonely bedroom, she felt sure she heard <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> {{speaking}} <b>low</b> somewhere in the courtyard.|$|R
6000|$|... "In {{that point}} he is unrivalled--indeed he {{is a perfect}} desperado--a down-right fire-eater, and no mistake," [...] said my friend, here {{dropping}} <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> excessively <b>low,</b> and thrilling me with the mystery of his tone.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mademoiselle," [...] he cried, and {{she gasped}} in her affright at this ruinous indiscretion, [...] "I beg {{that you will}} stand aside." [...] <b>His</b> <b>voice</b> was <b>low</b> and threatening, but his words were woefully distinct.|$|R
6000|$|... "Papa, I don't think I can choose," [...] {{the child}} answered, making <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> very <b>low</b> and confidential. [...] "But I {{have been a}} great deal with mamma to-day," [...] he added in a moment.|$|R
60|$|They were Rintoul's words. Yet Babbie {{had only}} ventured {{to look up}} {{because he was so}} long in speaking. <b>His</b> <b>voice</b> was <b>low</b> but harsh, like a wheel on which the brake is pressed sharply.|$|R
6000|$|<b>His</b> <b>voice</b> was <b>low</b> and not pleasant. With {{considerable}} haste {{the clerk}} {{took down the}} key, protesting, [...] "I never said you looked like a sneak-thief. Just rules of the hotel. But if you want to--" ...|$|R
6000|$|Norman's colour {{rose with}} the extreme pain this unjust {{accusation}} caused him, and <b>his</b> <b>voice,</b> though <b>low,</b> {{was not without}} irritation, [...] "I have tried. I have not done as much as I ought, perhaps, but--" ...|$|R
60|$|As for my uncle, {{he stood}} before her and I saw not his face, but <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> was <b>low</b> and terrible, {{speaking}} words I understood not then, though long afterwards I came to know their meaning.|$|R
6000|$|Seaforth {{stared out}} into the {{glittering}} night, and groaned, for he knew what happened to wounded men unsheltered from the frost. <b>His</b> <b>voice</b> was <b>low</b> and harsh as he asked, [...] "Then {{what is to be}} done?" ...|$|R
