Both measurements and theoretical predictions have shown that TWDP fading becomes more common as mobile radio links increase in both frequency and density.|$|E
40|$|Aircraft {{navigation}} {{based on}} GPS (Global Positioning System) and WAAS (Wide Area Augmentation System) requires both code and carrier measurements {{to calculate the}} position estimate [1]. A GPS receiver’s carrier tracking loop is weaker than code tracking loop. Thus, carrier lock can more easily be broken under deep signal fading caused by ionospheric scintillation. If a receiver cannot track code and carrier of at least four satellite channels, the aircraft cannot navigate using GPS or WAAS. The solar maximum data set analyzed in this research demonstrates frequent <b>deep</b> <b>fades</b> and almost all satellites in view suffered from scintillation, which could significantly reduce number of simultaneous tracked satellites. Statistics of number of tracked satellites under 45 minutes of strong scintillation are given in this paper and importance of shorter reacquisition time of a receiver is also emphasized. In order to design an aviation receiver with shorter reacquisition time under frequent deep signal fadings, characteristics of signal fading have to be well understood. Two important characteristics of deep fading are analyzed, which are fading duration and time between <b>deep</b> <b>fades.</b> The fading duration model in this paper can provide a guideline for more robust aviation receiver design. Even if the receiver could reacquire phase lock quickly, frequent <b>deep</b> <b>fades</b> significantly increase noise level in smoothed pseudoranges, which results in lower navigation availability. Statistics of time between <b>deep</b> <b>fades</b> given in this paper shows very frequent <b>deep</b> <b>fades</b> {{that could be a}} major concern of GPS navigation under strong scintillation during solar maximum period...|$|E

In a slow-fading channel, {{it is not possible to}} use time diversity because {{the transmitter}} sees only a single realization of the channel within its delay constraint.

These wireless networks are subject to <b>deep</b> <b>fades,</b> where a severe drop {{in the quality of}} the communication link occurs. Such <b>deep</b> <b>fades</b> may significantly impact the formation’s performance and stability, and cause unexpected safety problems.

This suggests that one can use channel state information as a feedback signal to recover the performance loss caused by a deep fade. This paper derives sufficient conditions to assure almost-sure practical stability of a leader-follower non-holonomic system in the presence of <b>deep</b> <b>fades.</b> These conditions relate the channel state to the system’s convergence rate.

Threshold-based scheduling is applicable to all the WiMAX subcarrier permutation options, but due to analytical difficulty we will later focus on the band-AMC in our analysis. Motivation for the threshold-based scheduling consideration is the fact that, in OFDMA systems, user channels experience <b>deep</b> <b>fades</b> frequently, therefore the regular WiMAX OFDMA scheduler based on FUSC, PUSC, or band-AMC systems {{would be forced to}} assign subchannels to users when their channels experience <b>deep</b> <b>fades,</b> degrading the BS throughput significantly.

In this paper, an ARQ scheme with adaptive error-correcting codes is considered. A robust channel sensing algorithm by {{making use of}} XOR-ing is proposed for link adaptation. With the proposed channel estimation algorithm, an adaptive scheme that adapts its error correcting codes according to channel conditions is presented. The efficiency of the proposed adaptive ARQ scheme is evaluated in terms of throughput performance by computer simulation for a time-varying mobile channel characterized by Rayleigh fading and log-normal shadowing.
