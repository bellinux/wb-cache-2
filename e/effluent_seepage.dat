With the development of industry and agriculture, city population increasing, more and more water is needed, as well as the groundwater. It causes the groundwater over-extraction, and a series of serious environment problems such as region’s groundwater cone of depression, land subsidence, seawater inbreak, water quality deteriorate. It is very necessary for us to study groundwater resource. Traditionally, 2 D data model is used and 2 D planes and slice are represented the result, not the true 3 D, so it is difficult to analyse groundwater resource exactly. Therefore, Volume visualization technology is introduced into the field of groundwater resource. Volume visualization technology is that scatter sampling in finite space, each value of sampling point will be one or more properties, which represent its physical property. So it is very suitable to represent the true 3 D geo-phenomena, such as the existent condition of groundwater, the groundwater cone of depression and the groundwater <b>effluent</b> <b>seepage</b> field.

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} mountain-front recharge {{from the}} Santa Rita mountains. Trilinear diagrams, finger-print diagrams, and scattergrams suggest that {{two types of}} water recharge the regional aquifer by <b>effluent</b> <b>seepage</b> as Madera Canyon Stream flows onto Madera Canyon fan. One type of water is dominated by calcium and bicarbonate ions, and the other type is dominated by calcium and sulfate ions. Deuterium and oxygen- 18 data support these interpretations and indicate that recharge occurs over {{a broad range of}} elevations. Furthermore, the isotopic data indicate that the deuterium and oxygen- 18 gradients are - 3. 5 0 / 00 and - 0. 4 0 / 00, respectively, per 1000 foot increase. Evidence is lacking for the presence of deeply circulating waters. Calculations based on a flow-net analysis and a water balance approximate annual mountain-front recharge to be between 200 and 400 ac-ft/yr/mi of mountain-front recharge. Recharge studies from the nearby Santa Catalina mountains estimate recharge to be between 25 and 50 ac-ft/yr/mi of mountain front and present evidence for minor amounts of deep circulation through the mountain block into the basin.

40|$|International audienceEscherichia coli and Enterococci {{are widely}} used as {{indicators}} of faecal contamination of groundwater while total coliforms, which are of environmental but also of faecal origin, are indicators of {{the overall quality of}} the water. The survival of bacteria in groundwater is dependent on many factors including temperature, competition with indigenous bacteria and entrapment in aquifer material. Previous studies showed two sources of faecal contamination of a schist aquifer: infiltration into the ground from nearby septic tank <b>effluents</b> and <b>seepage</b> of landfill leachate. Water samples for bacterial analysis were collected from a piezometer on a monthly basis (15 months) and every six hours over two non-consecutive days. The intermittent sampling showed relatively stable concentrations of bacteria over time after the removal of stagnant water. Therefore, a continuous bacterial contamination without significant daily variation exists. The ratio of E. coli densities to total coliforms densities (EC/TC) allowed differentiation between the sources of faecal pollution in groundwater by comparing the populations of faecal bacteria with those of environmental bacteria. Enumeration indicated that the densities of bacteria were much higher in this schist aquifer than those in alluvial aquifers contaminated by a septic tank reported in the literature...|$|R

An {{investigation}} {{was made into}} the physical, chemical and biological conditions of the Elsburgspruit to establish the extent and quality of pollution {{over a period of}} {{two and a half years}} from January 1987 June 1989. The results obtained during the investigation can be summarised as follows. Serious faecal pollution as reflected by faecal coliforms, faecal streptococci and coliphage organisms occurs over a large stretch of the river, posing a health risk to the people using the recreational area at' Vosloosrust, downstream from the Elsburgspruit near Kathlehong. The occurrence and large numbers of coliphage organisms occurring at certain sampling localities suggest the possible presence of the pathogenic viruses Salmonella, Pseudomonas and Candida. <b>Effluent</b> and <b>seepage</b> waters from mining areas, discharged into the Elsburgspruit were found to be low in pH and high in concentrations of certain metals such as zinc, manganese and iron. Due to the large volume of this particular effluent, the effects thereof on the water quality and fauna of the streams are felt over a distance of more than seven kilometres. As a result, the recovery of the stream from pollution is severely retarded. A number of species of the numerically dominant aquatic and semi-aquatic macrophytes which occurred within the flood-plain of the Elsburgspruit, were found to be able to absorb and to accumulate substantial concentrations of the various heavy metals, directly from the water, or from adjacent moist soils. It was also found that the Spanish reed, Arundo donax, which covers a large area of the wetland region of the Elsburgspruit in its lower section, absorbed and accumulated substantial quantities of the different heavy metals from the water of the stream.

40|$|Zalengei area, Darfur Province, Sudan, a {{semi-arid}} area, appears favorable in {{many respects}} for future agricultural development. The cultivation of new cash crops depends {{on the availability of}} adequate supplies of ground water of satisfactory quality to irrigate these crops. The principal aquifer in the area is unconfined in the valley fill sediments which form the Lower Terrace and the Flood Plain formations. The average thickness of the aquifer is some 90 feet, and its average transmissivity and storage coefficient are 100, 000 gallons/day/foot, and 0. 2 respectively. The storage capacity of the ground water reservoir is some 140, 000 acre feet. Ground water is discharged from the basin by evapotranspiration, <b>effluent</b> <b>seepage,</b> and underflow out of the basin. Recharge to the ground water is from direct precipitation over the basin area, by influent seepage, and by underflow into the basin. The ground water supplies of the area have small amounts of dissolved solids, mostly bicarbonates and, carbonates. The waters that underlie Wadi Aribo are generally rich in calcium and magnesium bicarbonates, whereas those underlying Wadi Azum are rich in sodium carbonates and bicarbonates. The ground water underlying Wadi Azum is an approximate blend of the waters supplied by its tributaries and the water of the Large Dariba Lake. This lake has the highest content of fluoride yet known in natural waters. The arable land in the area is 7200 acres. The amount of ground water needed to irrigate these lands is about 21, 600 acre-feet per year. About 20 per cent of this amount can be recharged to the ground water body from the annual precipitation over the basin area; the rest can be recharged by influent seepage from the wadis during flood time.

40|$|According to {{estimates}} of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), more than 1. 8 billion people will be living in countries or regions with absolute water scarcity by 2025. The pressure on water resources is increased not only in arid and semiarid regions, but also in fast growing megacities {{around the world as}} a result of, amongst other factors, the changing nutritional and consumer behavior (rising living standards). Over 90 % of the annual water consumption of the newly industrializing and developing countries in the arid and semiarid climate zone is used for agricultural irrigation to ensure the nutrition of the population. Thus, {{since the beginning of the}} 20 th century, the planned/controlled reuse of wastewater has developed into a central task of the sustainable water resources management. Wastewater represents a valuable resource in view of its composition (e. g. nutrients P, N for soil fertilizing) and its reliable, weather-independent availability in every household. The establishment of a closed-loop water management can enhance the efficiency of water usage. Therefore, activities in research and development are currently focused on decentralized and semi-centralized concepts, since their structures offer better conditions for the establishment of closed-loop systems and innovations in wastewater technology can be implemented more easily. In general, the hygienic quality requirements for wastewater reuse are predominantly oriented towards the planned usage. These are, in turn, regulated by thresholds and guidance values, e. g. for faecal indicator bacteria (e. g. faecal coliforms: E. coli), in widely differing norms and legal provisions specific to the respective countries. In Germany since 2005, small wastewater treatment plants can obtain the discharge class +H by the German Institute for Civil Engineering (DIBt: Deutsches Institut für Bautechnik) if secondary effluents contain less than 100 faecal coliforms (E. coli) per 100 mL. This ensures a safe <b>effluent</b> <b>seepage</b> in karst and water protection areas. Due to the infectious risk caused by a multitude of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, worm eggs, protozoa) which are still contained in wastewater after mechanical-biological treatment, specific disinfection methods are indispensable for their satisfactory reduction. Demands on disinfection methods for wastewater reclamation are quite complex. They should be characterized by a high and constant disinfection efficiency at low or moderate formation of disinfection by-products. The reclaimed wastewater should be able to be stored safely. Moreover, the disinfection method should be technically simple, scaleable, space-saving, subjected to low maintenance and realized at moderate investment and operating costs without applying external toxic chemicals. Established methods in decentralized wastewater disinfection are mainly based on membrane and UV technologies. However, these methods are currently working under high operating costs (high maintenance and cleaning efforts). Furthermore, the high investment costs of the membrane filtration are disadvantageous. In addition, both methods do not provide a disinfection residual. Thus, further research is required for the development and testing of alternative disinfection technologies. Against this background, the applicability of the electrolysis and UV/electrolysis hybrid technology for the decentralized wastewater reclamation was investigated and assessed in this dissertation. Results have shown that the electrochemical disinfection of biologically treated wastewater represents an efficient method at temperatures of > 6 °C, pH values of 400 J m- 1, no complete removal of E. coli bacteria can be achieved at TSS concentrations of > 17 mg L- 1. Therefore, it is indispensable to prevent bacterial reactivation caused by photo and dark repair processes. This topic was studied in the current work by electrochemically produced oxidants using an electrolysis cell positioned downstream of the UV unit. Results have shown that photo and dark reactivation were completely prevented by oxidants in a total concentration of 0. 5 [...] . 0. 6 mg L- 1 at a TSS concentration of 8 [...] . 11 mg L- 1, at pH values ranging from 5. 7 to 8. 1 and at temperatures ranging from 10 °C to 30 °C (t = 24 [...] 72 h). Even at a high TSS concentration of 75 mg L- 1, the reactivation of E. coli (ctotal oxidants = 1. 8 mg L- 1) and, up to a TSS concentration of 32 mg L- 1, the reactivation of total coliforms (except E. coli, ctotal oxidants = 1. 0 mg L- 1) can be prevented at a high initial germ concentration of 2 … 3 105 per 100 mL. The lowest energy consumption could be observed when mixed oxide electrodes (MOX electrodes) were applied. This result and the fact that no chlorate and perchlorate were observed at MOX electrodes argue for the application of these electrodes in practice. All in all, the UV/electrolysis hybrid technology represents an energy-efficient method for reclamation of biologically treated wastewater with TSS concentrations ranging from 6 months). The undesired formation of coverings caused by biofouling processes on quartz glass surfaces could be prevented by electrochemically produced oxidants in a total concentration of 1 mg L- 1 within an experimental duration of 5. 5 months. However, the application of the UV/electrolysis hybrid technology is limited by increased particle concentrations and faecal loadings (initial E. coli concentration). The resulting enhanced demand of electrochemically produced oxidants for the prevention of bacterial reactivation results in a considerable increase of the electric charge input and energy consumption...|$|E

The {{investigations}} {{reported here}} conducted during 1990 - 1994 had the following objectives: Selection of representative localities in impoundments and rivers in wetlands affected by radionuclide- and metal-containing <b>effluents</b> and <b>seepage</b> water from mines and metal-processing industries. To determine the occurrence and concentration of radionuclides and selected metals in mine- and industry-polluted waters and sediments in catchments of the Blesbokspruit, the Klip River and the Crocodile River systems. To establish radionuclide and metal concentrations in some semi-aquatic and aquatic weeds in these mine- and industry-polluted waters with {{observations on the}} ability of some plants to accumulate certain metals in their roots and/or shoots. To evaluate some benthic macro-invertebrate organisms as possible indicators of radionuclide and metal pollution in the affected streams. To determine the radionuclide and metal concentrations in selected vegetable crops irrigated with mine- and industry-polluted water. The localities where the investigation took place were mainly in wetland regions on the East and West Rand. Water of polluted streams traverse expansive wetlands containing floating, emergent and submerged aquatic vegetation. These plants {{play an important role in}} the recovery from pollution of the affected waters. Pollutants are also available to and accumulated by other aquatic organisms such as crabs, fish and birds. In addition, the same water is often used for the irrigation of vegetable crops, thereby creating potential pathways through which these pollutants may be consumed by humans. All the above objectives have largely been met in as such that potential sources of pollution were identified and pollutants detected in the abiotic (water and sediments) environment. These pollutants were also found in wetland biota as well as agricultural crops irrigated with contaminated water.

The lowest potential and the longest lag were exhibited by sediments in an apple cannery effluent area. Enrichment cultures of nitrifying microorganisms were obtained from all sites using NH 4 + as a source of energy, but enrichments for nitrite oxidizers were unsuccessful. Concentrated pine bark tannins, similar in origin to those in effluents at the well-nitrifying chipmill site, were tested for toxicity to pure cultures of nitrifying bacteria.

40|$|The final {{disposal}} of waste in sanitary landfill generates environmental impacts {{in the form of}} gaseous emissions and <b>effluents</b> in the <b>seepage</b> water. In product specicic Life Cycle Assessments, these environmental impacts resulting from the disposal of the product under study frequently have a strong influence on the overall results. The Sanitary Landfill (SL), like the Municipal Solid Waste Incineration (MSWI), is a complex system with a large variety of different types of waste with varying input composition. A direct determination of the environmental impacts resulting from the landfilling of a single input component, e. g. by measurements, is not possible. The model approach described in this paper shows an operationalized concept for the allocation of the environmental effects caused by the landfill process to special input components. The calculation of the landfill emissions in the model is based on the emission spectrum (landfill gas and seepage water) of an average-sized landfi ll in Germany and the elementary composition of the single waste fraction under consideration. The resulting reactor landfill module comprises an average split for diffuse and captured landfill emissions, the use of captured landfill gases in a gas engine and a cleaning of captured seepage water in a waste water treatment plant.

40|$|On April 1, 2003, {{representatives of}} the Commodity Credit Corporation of the U. S. Department of Agriculture (CCC/USDA) and Argonne National Laboratory met with {{representatives of the}} U. S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region VII (EPA); the Nebraska Department of Environmental Quality (NDEQ); and Nebraska Health and Human Services (NHHS) to discuss the current {{regulatory}} and technical status of the environmental investigations at the former CCC/USDA grain bin site in Murdock, Nebraska. The investigations are being performed by Argonne (under the direction of the CCC/USDA) to characterize and evaluate the potential remedial needs associated with the carbon tetrachloride contamination identified in groundwater and surface waters {{in the vicinity of the}} town. This contamination has been linked to former CCC/USDA grain storage activities at Murdock. Table 1. 1 presents a brief summary of the regulatory, site characterization, and remedial assessment activities to date at Murdock. Figure 1. 1 illustrates the extent of the groundwater carbon tetrachloride plume, estimated on the basis of sampling performed by Argonne in June 2002. Figure 1. 2 presents the 2002 interpretation of the site hydrogeology in a cross section extending northwestward from the former CCC/USDA grain storage facility, along the approximate axis of the groundwater plume. In reviewing the available information for Murdock, the EPA identified two specific areas of technical concern regarding the distribution and potential fate of the carbon tetrachloride contamination at the site that might significantly affect the selection of an appropriate remedial strategy: (1) Periodic sampling (by Argonne) of surface water at the headwaters of the unnamed tributary to Pawnee Creek northwest of Murdock and sampling of the <b>effluent</b> from natural <b>seepage</b> points and agricultural drain tile lines that contribute to the creek (Figure 1. 3) demonstrated discharge of contaminated groundwater from the aquifer to the headwaters area north of Waverly Road. The EPA noted, however, that no conclusive evidence is available to demonstrate whether complete capture and removal of the carbon tetrachloride plume from the aquifer are occurring by this mechanism. Specifically, the EPA questioned whether contamination continuing to migrate in the deeper subsurface beneath the tributary to Pawnee Creek might pose a threat to groundwater resources beyond the area of presently observed contaminant discharge. (2) Concentrations of carbon tetrachloride measured in groundwater from shallow monitoring well 2 S, near the north-central boundary of the property formerly occupied by the CCC/USDA grain storage facility (Figure 1. 1), have remained relatively constant (at approximately 40 - 100 mg/L) since Argonne began periodic sampling of this well in 1991, with no clear trend of decreasing values. The observed concentrations suggest that a continuing, uncharacterized source of carbon tetrachloride contamination to groundwater remains in the vadose zone soils beneath the former grain storage facility, upgradient of this well. To address these concerns, the CCC/USDA and Argonne proposed a series of targeted field investigations at the Murdock site. Four technical objectives were originally proposed in the Work Plan for this targeted investigation (Argonne 2003), and two additional objectives were authorized as the field work progressed and information accumulated. The combined technical objectives of this investigation were to accomplish the following: (1) Determine the continuity, thickness, and hydrogeologic characteristics of the aquifer in the vicinity of the Pawnee Creek tributary. (2) Characterize the present distribution of carbon tetrachloride contamination in groundwater and surface water in the area north of Waverly Road. (3) Determine the patterns of groundwater flow in the vicinity of the Pawnee Creek tributary and their relationship to the expected migration of the identified carbon tetrachloride plume. (4) Identify and delineate the presence of carbon tetrachloride in vadose zone soils in the northern portion of the former CCC/USDA facility that might pose a continuing source of contamination to the aquifer, and determine soil properties affecting vertical contaminant migration. (5) Evaluate contaminant migration from soil to groundwater, and analyze indoor air potentially affected by vapor intrusion at residences built on the former CCC/USDA facility.

40|$|Water is {{the most}} {{essential}} requirement for life. The most fundamental component of sustainable development {{is to ensure that}} the streams, rivers, lakes and oceans are not contaminated due to human activities. Water is extensively used for various mining operations, viz., wet drilling, dust suppression, ore processing, washing of heavy earth moving machinery (HEMM). Mine drainage, mine cooling, aqueous leaching and other mining processes has the potential to cause contamination of water bodies both surface and ground by discharging mine <b>effluent</b> and tailing <b>seepage.</b> The ever increasing mining activities pose a serious threat to the water resources. The awareness towards environmental footprint of mining operations is consistently growing, but it often gets little attention. Environmental pollution is the price that we pay for our everyday use of minerals and its products. Contamination of water sources severely affects not only an individual species but the entire ecosystem and all the organisms living in the ecosystem, and also severely affect human health. In the present work, water samples were collected from various sampling sites, followed by laboratory analysis and water quality modelling. Water sampling was done in the area surrounding TRB iron ore mine owned by Jindal Steel & Power Ltd, located in Tensa region of Sundergarh district in Odisha during October 2016. The location of sampling was so selected because of the nearness of mining site to residential areas. In recent years, the surrounding surface and ground water bodies were gradually contaminated due to the mining operations. A total of 23 water quality parameters of the collected water samples, viz., Temperature, Conductivity, Oxidation Reduction Potential, pH, Acidity, Alkalinity, Dissolved Oxygen, Biochemical Oxygen Demand, Total Dissolved Solids, Total Hardness, Turbidity, Sulphate, Phosphate, Nitrate, Chloride, Fluoride, Sodium, Potassium, Calcium, Manganese, Iron, Copper and Nickel, were determined by laboratory analysis. The water quality modelling was done using WA-WQI (Weighted Average - Water Quality Index) based on 11 water quality parameters, viz., pH, Conductivity, DO, TDS, Hardness, BOD, Sulphate, Chloride, Nitrate, Calcium and Iron. Graphical modelling was done for all the determined water quality parameters {{in order to make the}} water quality analysis easily comprehensible. Graphical models of all the water quality parameters were created in QGIS (Quantum GIS) software using IDW (Inverse Distance Weighting) method, in which all the water quality parameters were interpolated and displayed for the area surrounding the sampling locations. Finally, a 3 D graphical model of WA-WQI was created, represented as a DEM (Digital Elevation Model), where higher elevation indicates higher values of WA-WQI. Based on the study of the experimental analysis data and the graphical models, it was concluded that turbidity values exceeded the permissible limit (1 NTU according to IS- 10500) in almost the entire study region; pH was below the permissible of 6. 5 in half of the study region; iron, copper and manganese concentrations exceeded the permissible limits (0. 3 mg/l, 0. 05 mg/l and 0. 1 mg/l respectively) in the regions surrounding the sampling sites G 1, S 2 and S 5; BOD value exceeded the permissible limit (5 mg/l) in the regions surrounding the sampling sites G 1 and S 5; and nickel concentration exceeded the permissible limit (0. 02 mg/l) in the regions surrounding the sampling sites S 5. According to the WA-WQI ratings determined for the water samples, only G 2 qualifies for excellent water quality; S 1 and S 3 have good water quality; G 3, G 4, G 5 and S 4 have poor water quality; and G 1, S 2, and S 5 has very poor water quality. Although, it was inconclusive that if ground water sources are more polluted than surface water sources. ...|$|R
40|$| {{to ensure}} that it does not impede {{effluent}} infiltration beyond tolerable limits. Various strategies have been investigated to either control clogging mat formation or to remediate its severity. Intermittent dosing of effluent is one such strategy that has attracted considerable attention. Research conclusions with regard to short duration time intervals are contradictory. It has been claimed that the intermittent rest periods would result in the aerobic decomposition of the clogging mat leading to a subsequent increase in the infiltration rate. Contrary to this, it has also been claimed that short duration rest periods are insufficient to completely decompose the clogging mat, and the intermediate by-products that form as a result of aerobic processes would in fact lead to even more severe clogging. It has been further recommended that the rest periods should be much longer and should be in the range of about six months. This entails the provision of a second and alternating seepage bed. The other concepts that have been investigated are the design of the bed to meet the equilibrium infiltration rate that would eventuate after clogging mat formation; improved geometry {{such as the use of}} seepage trenches instead of beds; serial instead of parallel effluent distribution and low pressure dosing of effluent. The use of physical measures such as oxidation with hydrogen peroxide and replacement of the infiltration surface have been shown to be only of short-term benefit. Another issue of importance is the degree of pretreatment that should be provided to the effluent prior to subsurface application and the influence exerted by pollutant loadings on the clogging mat formation. Laboratory studies have shown that the total mass loadings of BOD and suspended solids are important factors in the formation of the clogging mat. It has also been found that the nature of the suspended solids is also an important factor. The finer particles from extended aeration systems when compared to those from septic tanks will penetrate deeper into the soil and hence will ultimately cause a more dense clogging mat. However the importance of improved pretreatment in clogging mat formation may need to be qualified in view of other research studies. It has also shown that effluent quality may be a factor in the case of highly permeable soils but this may not be the case with fine structured soils. The ultimate test of onsite sewage treatment system efficiency rests with the final disposal of effluent. The implication of system failure as evidenced from the surface ponding of <b>effluent</b> or the <b>seepage</b> of contaminants into the groundwater can be very serious as it can lead to environmental and public health impacts. Significant microbial contamination of surface and groundwater has been attributed to septic tank effluent. There are a number of documented instances of septic tank related waterborne disease outbreaks affecting large numbers of people. In a recent incident, the local authority was found liable for an outbreak of viral hepatitis A and not the individual septic tank owners as no action had been taken to remedy septic tank failure. This illustrates the responsibility placed on local authorities in terms of ensuring the proper operation of onsite sewage treatment systems. Even a properly functioning soil absorption system is only capable of removing phosphorus and microorganisms. The nitrogen remaining after plant uptake will not be retained in the soil column, but will instead gradually seep into the groundwater as nitrate. Conditions for nitrogen removal by denitrification are not generally present in a soil absorption bed. Dilution by groundwater is the only treatment available for reducing the nitrogen concentration to specified levels. Therefore based on subsurface conditions, this essentially entails a maximum allowable concentration of septic tanks in a given area. Unfortunately nitrogen is not the only wastewater pollutant of concern. Relatively long survival times and travel distances have been noted for microorganisms originating from soil absorption systems. This is likely to happen if saturated conditions persist under the soil absorption bed or due to surface runoff of effluent as a result of system failure. Soils have a finite capacity for the removal of phosphorus. Once this capacity is exceeded, phosphorus too will seep into the groundwater. The relatively high mobility of phosphorus in sandy soils have been noted in the literature. These issues have serious implications in the design and siting of soil absorption systems. It is not only important {{to ensure that}} the system design is based on subsurface conditions but also the density of these systems in given areas is a critical issue. This essentially involves the adoption of a land capability approach to determine the limitations of an individual site for onsite sewage disposal. The most limiting factor at a particular site would determine the overall capability classification for that site which would also dictate the type of effluent disposal method to be adopted...|$|R
