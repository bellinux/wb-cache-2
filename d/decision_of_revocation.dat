This is the case despite the grant decision being an administrative decision. This Paper considers the decisions made {{as part of the}} patent system - including the decision by a patent examiner to grant a patent and the adjudicatory <b>decisions</b> <b>of</b> opposition and <b>revocation</b> - and explores the potential for the {{challenges to}} the grant decision to be subject to administrative review.

40|$|One of {{the hardest}} tasks of a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is to manage {{revocation}}. Different revocation mechanisms have been proposed to invalidate the credentials of compromised or misbe- having users. All these mechanisms aim to optimize the transmission <b>of</b> <b>revocation</b> data to avoid unnecessary network overhead.

Temporal distribution <b>of</b> the <b>revocation</b> data has a significant influence on the performance and scalability <b>of</b> the <b>revocation</b> service. In this paper, we demonstrate that the temporal distribution of the daily number of revoked certificates is statistically self-similar, and that the currently assumed Poisson distribu- tion does not capture the statistical properties of the distribution.

40|$|In ownership-based {{access control}} {{frameworks}} {{with the possibility}} of delegating permissions and administrative rights, chains of delegated accesses will form. There are different ways to treat these delegation chains when revoking rights, which give rise to different revocation schemes. Hagström et al. [8] proposed a framework for classifying revocation schemes, in which the different revocation schemes are defined graph-theoretically; they motivate the revocation schemes in this framework by presenting various scenarios in which the agents have different reasons for revocating. This paper is based on the observation that there are some problems with Hagström et al. 's definitions <b>of</b> the <b>revocation</b> schemes, which have led us to propose a refined framework with new graph-theoretic definitions <b>of</b> the <b>revocation</b> schemes. In order to formally study the merits and demerits of various definitions <b>of</b> <b>revocation</b> schemes, we propose to apply the axiomatic method originating in social choice theory to revocation schemes. For formulating an axiom, i. e. a desirable property <b>of</b> <b>revocation</b> frameworks, we propose a logic, Trust Delegation Logic TDL), with which one can formalize the different reasons an agent may have for performing a revocation. We show that our refined graph-theoretic definitions <b>of</b> the <b>revocation</b> schemes, unlike Hagström et al. 's original definitions, satisfy the desirable property that can be formulated using TDL. status: publishe...|$|R
