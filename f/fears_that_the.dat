5|$|Experience {{from the}} few cities where {{congestion}} pricing has been implemented shows that {{social and political}} acceptability is key. Public discontent with congestion pricing, or rejection of congestion pricing proposals, is due mainly to the inequality issues, the economic burden on neighboring communities, the effect on retail businesses and the economic activity in general, and the <b>fears</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> revenues will become just another tax.|$|E
5|$|He helped broker the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, an {{international}} treaty designed to curb greenhouse gas emissions. The treaty was not ratified in the United States after a 95 to 0 {{vote in the}} Senate. The primary objections stemmed from the exemptions the treaty gave to China and India, whose industrial base and carbon footprint have grown rapidly, and <b>fears</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> exemptions would lead to further trade imbalances and offshoring arrangement with those countries.|$|E
5|$|O'Connor {{made two}} {{arguments}} for the dissenting justices: that predisposition was proven {{by the fact}} that Jacobson had ordered materials both times he was actually solicited, and that the Court had usurped the jury's rightful role in deciding whether he was entrapped. She also expressed <b>fears</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> court had so broadened the definition of predisposition as to make it a viable defense in almost any case.|$|E

5|$|Stocks surged {{worldwide}} {{after the}} EU announced the EFSF's creation. The facility eased <b>fears</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Greek debt crisis would spread, and {{this led to}} some stocks rising {{to the highest level}} in a year or more. The euro made its biggest gain in 18 months, before falling to a new four-year low a week later. Shortly after the euro rose again as hedge funds and other short-term traders unwound short positions and carry trades in the currency.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the treaty}} was signed, German {{soldiers}} had already entered {{the port of}} Klaipėda. Adolf Hitler, on board the cruiser Deutschland, personally toured the city and gave a short speech. The armada sailing to Klaipėda included the cruiser Admiral Graf Spee, the light cruisers Nürnberg, Leipzig, and Köln, two destroyer squadrons, three torpedo boat flotillas, and one tender flotilla. At the time the Lithuanian navy had only one warship, the Prezidentas Smetona, a 580-ton converted minesweeper. While the Germans were celebrating {{the return of the}} city, European politicians expressed <b>fears</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Free City of Danzig would be Hitler's next target.|$|E
5|$|Charles Pearson (1793–1862) had {{proposed}} an underground railway connecting the City of London {{with the main}} line rail termini in around 1840. In 1854 he commissioned the first traffic survey, determining that each day 200,000 walked into the City, 44,000 travelled by omnibus, and 26,000 in private carriages. A Parliamentary Commission backed Pearson's proposal over other schemes. Despite concerns about vibration causing subsidence of buildings, the problems of compensating the many thousands whose homes were destroyed during digging of the tunnel, and <b>fears</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> tunnelling might break into Hell, construction began in 1860. On 9January 1863 the line opened as the Metropolitan Railway (MR), the world's first underground passenger railway.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{concerns}} about vibrations causing subsidence of nearby buildings, {{the problems of}} compensating the many thousands of people whose homes were destroyed during the digging of the tunnel, and <b>fears</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> tunnelling might accidentally break through into Hell, construction began in 1860. The new railway was built beneath the existing New Road, running from the Great Western Railway's terminus at Paddington to Farringdon and the meat market of Smithfield. On 9January 1863 the line opened as the Metropolitan Railway (MR), the world's first underground passenger railway. The MR was successful and grew steadily, extending its own services and acquiring other local railways in the areas north and west of London.|$|E
5|$|Great Britain VIII was a nine-day railtour from London to Cornwall, Scotland {{and back}} to London. Various steam {{locomotives}} were scheduled to haul the train on {{each day of the}} tour, which was to have been entirely steam hauled. Participants paid between £1,995 and £2,895 per person for the nine-day tour. Despite <b>fears</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> tour would be cancelled, it was run although with changes to the locomotives hauling it. DB Schenker agreed to operate the first two days of the tour. The tour suffered a number of issues including steam locomotives being replaced by diesels, and a lack of train heating; these resulted in a significant number of passengers leaving the tour early.|$|E
5|$|Henry VIII {{ordered the}} {{construction}} of an artillery blockhouse at East Tilbury in 1539–40 as part of a major scheme to fortify the coastline of England and Wales. It followed his break from the Pope and the Catholic Church, which led to <b>fears</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Catholic powers of Europe would seek to invade so as to reimpose Papal authority. Five blockhouses were built along the Thames between Gravesend and Higham – two on the north bank at Tilbury and East Tilbury and three on the south bank at Gravesend, Milton (near the present New Tavern Fort) and Higham.|$|E

Dr. Cheever dispatches Dr. Erin Mears (Kate Winslet), an Epidemic Intelligence Service officer, to Minneapolis to begin investigating. Mears traces the outbreak back to Emhoff while negotiating with local bureaucrats initially reluctant to commit resources for a proper public health response to the virus. Dr. Mears later becomes infected and dies.|$|E
5|$|London Bridge was {{the only}} {{physical}} connection between the City and {{the south side of}} the river Thames and was itself covered with houses. It had been noted as a deathtrap in the fire of 1632 and, by dawn on Sunday, these houses were burning. Samuel Pepys observed the conflagration from the Tower of London and recorded great concern for friends living on the bridge. There were <b>fears</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> flames would cross London Bridge to threaten the borough of Southwark on the south bank, but this danger was averted by an open space between buildings on the bridge which acted as a firebreak.|$|E
5|$|Mikhail Gorbachev's {{introduction}} of the policies of glasnost and perestroika in the 1980s also fueled Armenian visions {{of a better life}} under Soviet rule. The Hamshenis who were deported by Stalin to Kazakhstan began petitioning for the government to move them to the Armenian SSR. This move was denied by the Soviet government because of <b>fears</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Muslim Hamshenis might spark ethnic conflicts with their Christian Armenian cousins. However, another event that occurred during this time made an ethnic clash between Christian Armenians and Muslims inevitable.|$|E

Italian <b>fears</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Ottoman naval forces at Beirut could be used to {{threaten}} the approach to the Suez canal led the Italian military to order the destruction of the Ottoman naval presence in the area. On 24 February 1912 two Italian armoured cruisers attacked and sank an Ottoman casemate corvette and six lighters, retired, then returned and sank an Ottoman torpedo boat.|$|E

After Frears agreed to direct, and the cast were signed on, ITV pulled out of it over <b>fears</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> political sensitivity could affect its corporate merger. Channel 4 picked up the production and filming was carried out for five weeks in May 2003. The film was broadcast on 28 September 2003, the weekend prior to the Labour Party's annual party conference.|$|E

5|$|After the Klondike Gold Rush, {{the mounted}} police {{continued}} to spread their network of posts across the far north. In 1903, a small team of police under Inspector Charles Constantine {{were sent to}} Herschel Island to investigate the alleged sexual mistreatment of Inuit women by the transient whaling community there; the decision was also driven by <b>fears</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> United States might try to assert sovereignty over the wider Mackenzie Delta. The police {{found no evidence of}} sexual abuse, but took the opportunity to collect customs duties and to attempt to clamp down on liquor sales to the indigenous community. The same year, a well-publicised Canadian expedition was sent to Hudson Bay on the schooner SS Neptune, including Superintendent John Moodie and a small team of mounted police.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{unreliable}} {{nature of}} the troops loyal to the NDH government, Phleps utilised Chetnik forces as auxiliaries, stating to a visiting officer {{that he could not}} disarm the Chetniks unless the NDH government provided him with the same strength in reliable troops. In January 1944, due to <b>fears</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Western Allies would invade along the Dalmatian coastline and islands, V SS Mountain Corps forced the mass evacuation of male civilians between the ages of 17 and 50 from that area. Phleps was criticised by both NDH and German authorities for the harshness with which the evacuation was carried out. During {{the first six months of}} 1944, elements of the V SS Mountain Corps were involved in Operation Waldrausch (Forest Fever) in central Bosnia, Operation Maibaum (Maypole) in eastern Bosnia, and Operation Rösselsprung (Knight's Move), the attempt to capture or kill the Partisan leader Josip Broz Tito.|$|E
