50|$|Although {{existing}} technologies {{were employed}} and adapted for the operations at Gerdec, {{the techniques of}} ammunition disposal being used at the time were, and still are (in 2010), new technologies in this field. An error made by engineers who designed the machinery the demilitarisation company and associates employed on the project used. A fundamental <b>design</b> <b>assumption</b> made early in the design process rendered the basic machinery potentially lethal. Researchers and designers of the ammunition disposal kilns assumed the combustible compounds within the ammunition would burn away at 350 degrees Celsius. Documents available from the US military state, and thermochemical and thermodynamic calculations will verify the combustible compounds within the ammunition being disposed of at Gerdec burn to give out a heat amounting to 4500 degrees Celsius. Such an energy would, without further sufficient and adequate designed machine components, lead to vaporization and explosion of the machines used {{to dispose of the}} ammunition dumps.|$|E
40|$|In {{the design}} of cold-formed steel purlins based on Eurocode 3, the lateral bending moment in the free flange of the purlin, when in tension, {{is assumed to be}} zero due to flange curling and second order effects. To {{investigate}} the validity of this <b>design</b> <b>assumption,</b> non-linear analytical and finite element models for analyzing how the gravity load affects the maximum mid-span stresses in cold-formed steel purlins attached to the roof sheeting are presented in this paper. The second-order effect of tensile stresses induced by the gravity load in the free flange of purlins is investigated by emphasizing on Z and C sections. The results obtained from the two models are compared with Eurocode 3, and they are included in this article.

This study seeks to understand {{the effects of these}} <b>design</b> <b>assumptions</b> on the powerplant structure and the aircraft performance of fuel cell powered aircraft. A comparison is constructed by developing a multidisciplinary modeling and design environment that does not contain the assumption suggested in previous studies. <b>Design</b> <b>assumptions</b> from previous studies can then be imposed on the more complete design environment to determine the performance costs and morphological changes caused by the <b>design</b> <b>assumptions.</b> In the first design study, results show that designing fuel cell powered aircraft using automotive-type fuel cell subsystem design rules leads to a low efficiency powerplant and a low performance aircraft in long-endurance and long-range UAV applications.

Further, we present a generalization of this method which allows the user to express varying levels of interest in each potential model; the resulting design will be suggestive of these differences. Some asymptotic properties of the maximin criterion are also explored, including a condition which guarantees a design with the same generalized D-efficiencies for each possible model.

The main <b>design</b> <b>assumption</b> is that all the nodes in the vicinity of a sender and a receiver will hear the RTS or CTS packets, and defer their transmission appropriately.

Often, neighboring nodes are "masked" by other on-going transmissions nearby and, hence, are unable to receive the RTS or CTS packets correctly. We refer to such nodes as masked nodes.

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. Early warning systems for {{critical}} conditions at offshore wind turbines {{are needed to}} reduce maintenance costs and avoid catastrophic failures. Monitoring of the critical scour development at monopile foundations is commonly done with cost-intensive scour depth measurements. The scour condition is regarded critical when the depth exceeds the maximum allowed design scour depth during normal operation or due to a severe storm. This practice can lead to high maintenance costs and potentially unnecessary maintenance activities such as refilling of the scour hole or reconstruction of the scour protection. Instead, the exploitation of the structural reserves of fatigue driven monopile foundation designs stemming from <b>design</b> <b>assumption</b> versus real site conditions is suggested. Damage accumulation is highly influenced by the time behaviour of the transient scouring and real soil properties. This paper elaborates on novel low cost monitoring methods to detect when a scour development is truly critical when taking site conditions into account. A combination of fatigue monitoring and natural frequency supervision is proposed for critical scour identification {{in the framework of}} an early warning system...|$|E
