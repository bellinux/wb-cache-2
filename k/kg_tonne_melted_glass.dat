The mixed soil constituents were molten due to shock {{at the time of}} meteoroid impact near the Martian surface and the molten glass got incorporated into the voids and cracks in some shergottite meteorites. Earlier, Rao et al. found large enrichments of sulfur (sulfate) during an electron-microprobe study of several impact <b>melt</b> <b>glass</b> veins and pods in EET 79001,LithC thin sections. As sulfur is very abundant in Martian soil, these S excesses were attributed to the mixing of a soil component containing aqueously altered secondary minerals with the LithC precursor materials prior to impact melt generation. Recently, we studied additional impact <b>melt</b> <b>glasses</b> in two basaltic shergottites, Zagami and Shergotty using procedures similar to those described by Rao et al.

40|$|This memo report {{summarizes}} {{our current}} {{knowledge of the}} appearance of <b>melt</b> <b>glass</b> formed and subsequently deposited in the subsurface after an underground nuclear test. We have collected archived pictures and <b>melt</b> <b>glass</b> samples {{from a variety of}} underground nuclear tests that were conducted at the Nevada Test Site (NTS) during the U. S. nuclear testing program. The purpose of our work is to better determine the actual variation in texture and surface area of the <b>melt</b> <b>glass</b> material. This study is motivated by our need to better determine {{the rate at which the}} radionuclides incorporated in the <b>melt</b> <b>glass</b> are released into the subsurface under saturated and partially saturated conditions. The rate at which radionuclides are released from the glass is controlled by the dissolution rate of the glass. Glass dissolution, in turn, is a strong function of surface area, glass composition, water temperature and water chemistry (Bourcier, 1994). This work feeds into an ongoing experimental effort to measure the change in surface area of analog glasses as a function of dissolution rate. The conclusions drawn from this study help bound the variation in the textures of analog glass samples needed for the experimental studies. The experimental work is a collaboration between Desert Research Institute (DRI) and Earth and Environmental Sciences-Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (EES-LLNL). On March 4, 1999 we hosted a meeting at LLNL to present and discuss our findings. The names of the attendees appear at the end of this memo. This memo report further serves to outline and summarize the conclusions drawn from our meeting. The United States detonated over 800 underground nuclear tests at the NTS between 1951 and 1992. In an effort to evaluate the performance of the nuclear tests, drill-back operations were carried out to retrieve samples of rock in the vicinity of the nuclear test. Drill-back samples were sent to Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) and analyzed for diagnostic purposes. As a result of these activities, a body of knowledge consisting of personal accounts, photos, reports and archived solid samples was gained regarding the physical nature of the <b>melt</b> <b>glass</b> that formed during an underground nuclear test. In this memo report, we summarize previously published reports, compile archived photos, document and describe <b>melt</b> <b>glass</b> samples and summarized discussions from former field engineers and radiochemists who had direct knowledge of drill-back samples. All the information presented in the report was gathered from unclassified sources. We have included as wide a variation of samples as we could document.

Scanning electron microprobe analysis of the bulk glass shows conspicuous alteration layers lining internal vesicle surfaces in the glass. X-ray diffraction patterns for the alteration phases are consistent with clay mineral compositions. Glass dissolution models indicate these layers are too thick to have formed at ambient temperatures over the 10 year period in which they remained in a saturated environment. This implies the alteration layers likely formed at temperatures higher than ambient during cooling of the cavity following the underground detonation. Mobilization of this clay alteration layer as colloidal particles in groundwater represents a potential source of actinide release into the environment...|$|R

40|$|Temperature can {{significantly}} affect radionuclide transport behavior. In simulation of radionuclide transport originating from an underground nuclear test, temperature effects from residual test heat include non-isothermal groundwater flow behavior (e. g. convection cells), increased dissolution rates of <b>melt</b> <b>glass</b> containing refractory radionuclides, changes in water chemistry, and, in turn, changes in radionuclide sorption behavior. The low-yield (0. 75 kiloton) Cambric underground nuclear test situated in alluvium below {{the water table}} offers unique perspectives on radionuclide transport in groundwater. The Cambric test was followed by extensive post-test characterization of the radionuclide source term and a 16 -year pumping-induced radionuclide migration experiment that captured more mobile radionuclides in groundwater. Discharge of pumped groundwater caused inadvertent recirculation of radionuclides through a 220 -m thick vadose zone to the water table and below, including partial re-capture in the pumping well. Non-isothermal flow simulations indicate test-related heat persists at Cambric for about 10 years and induces limited thermal convection of groundwater. The test heat has relatively little impact on mobilizing radionuclides compared to subsequent pumping effects. However, our reactive transport models indicate test-related heat can raise <b>melt</b> <b>glass</b> dissolution rates up to 10 {sup 4 } faster than at ambient temperatures depending on pH and species activities. Non-isothermal flow simulations indicate that these elevated glass dissolution rates largely decrease within 1 year.
