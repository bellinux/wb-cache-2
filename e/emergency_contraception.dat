40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{findings from}} {{an evaluation of}} a scheme to provide free <b>emergency</b> hormonal <b>contraception</b> (EHC) via community pharmacies in the North-West of England.

The benefits of the service, cited by both pharmacists and users, included enhanced access to EHC, at times when it was needed, and at no cost to the user. In particular, users noted a welcome absence of judgmental attitudes when accessing the service. Pharmacists too were positive about the service, not least because they believed that it conferred enhanced professional status. However, both users and pharmacists had a number of major concerns about the schemes, centring on the potential for misuse, changes in contraceptive behaviour and the impact on sexually transmitted infections.

25|$|Chile {{has some}} of the strictest {{abortion}} laws in the world. One of the last acts of the military government under Pinochet was to outlaw abortion in all circumstances. Chile's abortion law criminalizes abortion even when it would save a pregnant woman's life. Therapeutic abortion was legal between 1931 and 1989 but is now is illegal under all circumstances. There have been proposed bills from Chilean legislators and s on abortion and reproductive rights, but they have never been passed. Estimates range between 120,000 and 160,000 for the number of Chilean women who have illegal abortions each year. Chile is considered to have one of the highest abortion rates in Latin America.

40|$|BACKGROUND: In the UK, a large {{proportion}} of contraceptive services are provided from general practice. However, little is known about which contraceptive services are provided and to whom. STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive serial cross-sectional study of women aged 12 - 55 &emsp 14;years, registered with 191 general practices in Scotland, UK between 2004 and 2009. RESULTS: Annual incidence of provision of hormonal and long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs) increased from 27. 7 % in 2004 to 30. 1 % in 2009. Amongst those women registered with a general practice for the full 5 -year period the provision of LARCs increased from 8. 8 % to 12. 5 % (p< 0. 001). For the same group, the provision of <b>emergency</b> hormonal <b>contraception</b> (EHC) decreased from 5. 2 % to 2. 6 % (p< 0. 001).

40|$|In Italy, <b>Emergency</b> Hormonal <b>Contraception</b> (EHC) is a {{prescription}} drug, {{available only in}} pharmacies. Evidence suggests {{that a number of}} doctors and pharmacists refuse to provide EHC, on grounds of conscience, although the exact frequency of this phenomenon is unknown. This creates a barrier to access to EHC for women, thus risking undermining their right to reproductive self-determination. In this article, we aim to offer a clearer empirical and theoretical understanding of the situation and to assess the force of doctors’ and pharmacists’ claims against providing EHC. Unlike standard discussions of the issue, we argue that the category of conscientious objection is not the most appropriate one for making sense of these claims, because they are not grounded in a conflict between two contrasting moral duties. The seemingly forced choice between protecting doctors’ and pharmacists’ professional self-determination and women’s reproductive self-determination could be prevented by distributing EHC without medical prescription and in a number of outlets (including supermarkets), thus relieving doctors and pharmacists from the legal duty to provide it...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{findings}} of a qualitative study that explored adolescent experiences of accessing <b>emergency</b> hormonal <b>contraception.</b> It describes how anticipated judgements and associated feelings of embarrassment and shame were dealt with through friendship. The paper outlines how, contrary to the notion of the ‘mean girl’, friends assumed crucial supporting roles which included confidante, advisor, and motivator. In some cases this included physically accompanying hesitant friends to sexual health services. The narrative brought to light how friends often kept each other on the straight and narrow, providing a sharp contrast to the image of irresponsible or shameless adolescents. Being this friend was transformative, offering a kind of reform that allowed a shift from the perceived label of promiscuous risk taker to that of informal advisor and supporter. The study concluded that friends were instrumental in the successful negotiation of the powerful discourses of risk and responsibility in the health arena and that this example of female solidarity at a time of crisis potentially {{plays a key role in}} adolescent sexual health...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{levonorgestrel}} for <b>emergency</b> post coital <b>contraception</b> after rape, {{has raised}} strong and recurring discussions during 2004 and 2005 in Chile.

Therefore, the use of levonorgestrel implies bioethical decisions that, in a democratic and pluralistic society, should be solved considering individual and collective responsibilities, conditions of equity and the informed autonomy of the affected women. Their moral values and their capacity to assume the consequences of an assault on their dignity, honor and self-esteem, in addition to physical and mental injuries, should also be considere...|$|R
40|$|Clinical {{sexual health}} {{consultations}} with young women often focus on avoiding ‘risks;’ namely pregnancy and {{sexually transmitted infection}} transmission. They also typically fail to explore how contraception use can impact on the capacity to enjoy sexual relationships. In contrast, this paper argues that sexual pleasure should be {{a starting point for}} all sexual health consultations and education work with young people. Drawing on our experiences of working for a UK sexual health charity for young people we suggest that excluding pleasure from sexual health consultations creates its own risks. A pleasure deficit model not only detracts from a full and frank exploration of sexuality, which is bound up with notions of sexual subjectivity and agential practices, but can also limit concerns regarding the adverse effects of contraception such as loss of libido. Using the example of long acting reversible contraception we note {{there is a tendency to}} privilege adult/‘expert’ advice over young women’s bodily knowledge. We also indicate how silence and discomfort regarding sexual pleasure may confound contraceptive consultations, for example in the case of <b>emergency</b> hormonal <b>contraception</b> provision. Establishing sexual pleasure as a starting point will provide a broader, positive and less risky focus on sexuality and sexual health...|$|R
