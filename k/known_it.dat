5|$|Dinheirosaurus is a genus of diplodocid sauropod dinosaur that {{is known}} from fossils {{uncovered}} in modern-day Portugal. It may represent a species of Supersaurus. The only species is Dinheirosaurus lourinhanensis, first described by José Bonaparte and Octávio Mateus in 1999 for vertebrae and some other material from the Lourinhã Formation. Although the precise age of the formation is not <b>known,</b> <b>it</b> can be dated around the early Tithonian of the Late Jurassic.|$|E
5|$|How these {{clusters}} {{are formed}} {{is not yet}} known, but their formation might well be related to that of globular clusters. Why M31 has such clusters, while the Milky Way does not, is not yet <b>known.</b> <b>It</b> is also unknown if any other galaxy contains these types of clusters, {{but it would be}} very unlikely that M31 is the sole galaxy with extended clusters.|$|E

5|$|The superb fairy-wren {{breeding}} male {{is used as}} {{an emblem}} by the Bird Observation & Conservation Australia. On 12 August 1999, a superb fairywren was mistakenly illustrated for an Australia Post 45c pre-stamped envelope meant to depict a splendid fairywren. Called the blue wren {{as it was then}} <b>known,</b> <b>it</b> had previously featured on a 2s.5d. stamp, released in 1964, which was discontinued with the advent of decimal currency.|$|E

5|$|A {{medium-sized}} warbler, the Nauru {{reed warbler}} has dark brown upperparts, cream underparts and a long, thin beak. It makes a low, cup-shaped nest into which it lays {{two or three}} white eggs, and it feeds on insects. However, details about its behavior and ecology are little <b>known.</b> <b>It</b> is found throughout Nauru, which has changed substantially in recent decades due to phosphate mining. The Nauru reed warbler is potentially threatened by introduced predators and habitat loss, and its small range means {{that it could be}} vulnerable to chance occurrences, such as tropical cyclones. Reports of a similar warbler from nearby islands suggest that it might previously have been found elsewhere, but was driven to local extinction by introduced cats.|$|E
5|$|A {{saturated}} solution of equal parts of thallium(I) formate (Tl(CHO2)) and thallium(I) malonate (Tl(C3H3O4)) in water {{is known as}} Clerici solution. It is a mobile, odorless liquid which changes from yellowish to colourless upon reducing the concentration of the thallium salts. With a density of 4.25g/cm3 at 20°C, Clerici solution {{is one of the}} heaviest aqueous solutions <b>known.</b> <b>It</b> was used in the 20th century for measuring the density of minerals by the flotation method, but its use has discontinued due to the high toxicity and corrosiveness of the solution.|$|E
5|$|Adults have neutral grey heads, brown necks, brown-sepia striped backs, and grey-white bellies, breasts, and throats. Males {{have some}} buff {{markings}} on their breasts, and less sharp brown spots on their napes than females. The Perijá tapaculo is a secretive bird and therefore difficult to observe; {{as a result}} its ecology is poorly <b>known.</b> <b>It</b> feeds on insects and reproduces between April and July. Its range is partially within Chamicero de Perijá Bird Reserve in Colombia and the Sierra de Perijá National Park in Venezuela.|$|E

5|$|Although plague was <b>known,</b> <b>it</b> {{was still}} {{sufficiently}} uncommon that medical practitioners {{might have had}} no personal experience of seeing the disease; medical training varied from those who had attended the college of physicians, to apothecaries who also acted as modern doctors, to simple charlatans. Other diseases abounded, such as an outbreak of smallpox the year before, and these uncertainties all added to difficulties identifying the true start of the epidemic. Contemporary accounts suggest cases of plague occurred through the winter of 1664/5, {{some of which were}} fatal but a number of which did not display the virulence of the later epidemic. The winter was cold, the ground frozen from December to March, river traffic on the Thames twice blocked by ice, {{and it may be that}} the cold weather held back its spread.|$|E
5|$|Bach led {{the first}} {{performance}} on 1 June 1727 in the Nikolaikirche. The Bach scholar Klaus Hofmann notes that a printed libretto for the congregation was recently {{found in the}} Russian National Library in St. Petersburg, containing the texts for the three feast days of Pentecost and Trinity of 1727. Until then the work had been dated much later, such as 1746 when a revival took place for which performance material exists. As {{the music of the}} 1727 version is lost, the timing of Bach's revisions to the wedding cantata is not <b>known.</b> <b>It</b> is likely that he revised it further in the 1740s because he wrote a new score.|$|E
5|$|Birket Israel (trans. Pool of Israel) also Birket Israil or Birket Isra'in, {{abbreviated}} from Birket Asbât Beni Israìl (trans.
