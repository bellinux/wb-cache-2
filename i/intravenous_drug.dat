5|$|Routes of {{infection}} include vertical transmission (such as through childbirth), early life horizontal transmission (bites, lesions, and sanitary habits), and adult horizontal transmission (sexual contact, <b>intravenous</b> <b>drug</b> use).|$|E
5|$|The {{second most}} {{frequent}} mode of HIV transmission is via blood and blood products. Blood-borne transmission can be through needle-sharing during <b>intravenous</b> <b>drug</b> use, needle stick injury, transfusion of contaminated blood or blood product, or medical injections with unsterilized equipment. The risk from sharing a needle during drug injection is between 0.63 and 2.4% per act, {{with an average}} of 0.8%. The risk of acquiring HIV from a needle stick from an HIV-infected person is estimated as 0.3% (about 1 in 333) per act and the risk following mucous membrane exposure to infected blood as 0.09% (about 1 in 1000) per act. In the United States <b>intravenous</b> <b>drug</b> users made up 12% of all new cases of HIV in 2009, and in some areas more than 80% of people who inject drugs are HIV positive.|$|E
5|$|Universal {{precautions}} {{within the}} health care environment {{are believed to be}} effective in decreasing the risk of HIV. <b>Intravenous</b> <b>drug</b> use is an important risk factor and harm reduction strategies such as needle-exchange programs and opioid substitution therapy appear effective in decreasing this risk.|$|E

40|$|Heterosexual {{transmission}} of {{human immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV) was investigated in 123 subjects with no apparent risk factor for infection other than having had heterosexual intercourse with {{a person who was}} either infected with HIV or at high risk of being infected with it. Seven subjects were found to be infected with the virus. Risk factors for transmission included being the regular sexual partner of an abuser of <b>intravenous</b> <b>drugs</b> and having a sexual relationship of more than 18 months' duration. Anal intercourse was not a risk factor in the three subjects who admitted to it. There were 41 regular partnerships with abusers of <b>intravenous</b> <b>drugs</b> in which the antibody state and history were fully known for both partners. In these partnerships male to female {{transmission of}} the virus occurred in five out of 34 (15 %) and female to male in one out of seven. In 30 couples in whom one partner was known to be positive for HIV and an abuser of <b>intravenous</b> <b>drugs</b> four female partners were found to be seropositive at first testing, but there were no new positive results on subsequent serial testing. In six of these 30 couples both partners abused <b>intravenous</b> <b>drugs</b> but the partner who was negative for HIV remained so. Few of the partnerships always practised safe sexual techniques, even after a partner was known to be positive for HIV...|$|R
5|$|Drug use and overdoses {{increased}} {{significantly in the}} 1800s due to the commercialization and availability of certain drugs. For example, while opium and coca had been used for centuries, their active ingredients, morphine and the cocaine alkaloid, were not isolated until 1803 and 1855 respectively. Cocaine and various opiates were subsequently mass-produced and sold openly and legally in the Western world, resulting in widespread misuse and addiction. Drug use and addiction also {{increased significantly}} following {{the invention of the}} hypodermic syringe in 1853, with overdose being a leading cause of death among <b>intravenous</b> <b>drug</b> users.|$|E
5|$|HCV {{is spread}} {{primarily}} by blood-to-blood contact associated with <b>intravenous</b> <b>drug</b> use, poorly sterilized medical equipment, needlestick injuries in healthcare, and transfusions. Using blood screening, the risk from a transfusion {{is less than}} one per two million. It may also be spread from an infected mother to her baby during birth. It is not spread by superficial contact. It {{is one of five}} known hepatitis viruses: A, B, C, D, and E.|$|E
5|$|Those at {{high risk}} of {{infection}} should be tested as there is effective treatment for those who have the disease. Groups that screening is recommended for include those who have not been vaccinated and one of the following: people from areas of the world where hepatitis B occurs in more than 2%, those with HIV, <b>intravenous</b> <b>drug</b> users, {{men who have sex with}} men, and those who live with someone with hepatitis B.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This paper {{reports on}} a pilot study {{examining}} the incidence of nurses' errors in preparation and administration of <b>intravenous</b> <b>drugs.</b> Furthermore, the study aimed to evaluate the short-term effects of implementation of a new protocol for preparation and administration of <b>intravenous</b> <b>drugs.</b> SETTING: Two nursing departments of internal medicine at a 953 beds University Medical Centre in The Netherlands. METHODS: By means of a prospective, quasi-experimental design, nurses were observed {{during the process of}} preparation and administration of <b>intravenous</b> <b>drugs.</b> Observation was performed before and after the implementation of a new protocol. Seventy-two nurses at two nursing departments were observed during the study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: A mean pre-test and post-test quality score at two departments of internal medicine. RESULTS: At baseline, average quality scores for nurses at the two departments were 64 (intervention ward) and 67 (control ward) on a 0 - 100 quality scale. The pre-test quality scores were not statistically significant for the two nursing wards (T = 1. 36, df = 55, P = 0. 18). After the implementation of the new protocol, nurses at the intervention ward scored better (72) than nurses at the control ward (69). The mean score at the intervention ward was significantly higher than the score in nurses of the control ward (T = - 2. 20, df = 53, P = 0. 04). CONCLUSIONS: The number of errors in the preparation and administration of <b>intravenous</b> <b>drugs</b> is high. This study shows that implementing a protocol for the preparation and administration of these drugs can reduce the number of errors...|$|R

5|$|Antiretroviral {{treatment}} {{among people}} with HIV whose CD4 count ≤ 550 cells/µL is a very effective way to prevent HIV infection of their partner (a strategy known as treatment as prevention, or TASP). TASP {{is associated with a}} 10 to 20 fold reduction in transmission risk. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with a daily dose of the medications tenofovir, with or without emtricitabine, is effective in a number of groups including {{men who have sex with}} men, couples where one is HIV positive, and young heterosexuals in Africa. It may also be effective in <b>intravenous</b> <b>drug</b> users with a study finding a decrease in risk of 0.7 to 0.4 per 100personyears.|$|E
5|$|Bacterial vaginosis (BV) occurs {{more often}} in lesbians, but it is unclear if BV is {{transmitted}} by sexual contact; it occurs in celibate as well as sexually active women. BV often occurs in both partners in a lesbian relationship; {{a recent study of}} women with BV found that 81% had partners with BV. Lesbians are not included in a category of frequency of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission, although transmission is possible through vaginal and cervical secretions. The highest rate of transmission of HIV to lesbians is among women who participate in <b>intravenous</b> <b>drug</b> use or have sexual intercourse with bisexual men.|$|E

5|$|HIV is {{typically}} transmitted through unprotected sex or <b>intravenous</b> <b>drug</b> use, {{and is often}} associated with groups such as promiscuous gay men, illicit drug users, and sex workers. For these reasons, and also because of fears of contagion, people living with HIV are frequently subjected to stigma and discrimination. Publicity campaigns around the world have aimed to counter HIV-related prejudices and misconceptions and to replace them with an accurate understanding that helps to prevent new infections. These efforts have been aided by various celebrities – including American basketball star Magic Johnson and South African judge Edwin Cameron – who have publicly announced that they are HIV-positive.|$|E
5|$|Clinicians {{assess the}} {{physical}} aspects {{such as the}} appearance of a patient, including apparent age, height, weight, and manner of dress and grooming. Colorful or bizarre clothing might suggest mania, while unkempt, dirty clothes might suggest schizophrenia or depression. If the patient appears much older than his or her chronological age this can suggest chronic poor self-care or ill-health. Clothing and accessories of a particular subculture, body modifications, or clothing not typical of the patient's gender, might give clues to personality. Observations of physical appearance might include the physical features of alcoholism or drug abuse, such as signs of malnutrition, nicotine stains, dental erosion, a rash around the mouth from inhalant abuse, or needle track marks from <b>intravenous</b> <b>drug</b> abuse. Observations can also include any odor which might suggest poor personal hygiene due to extreme self-neglect, or alcohol intoxication. Weight loss could also signify a depressive disorder, physical illness, anorexia nervosa or chronic anxiety.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, Dallas {{electrician}} and rodeo cowboy Ron Woodroof (Matthew McConaughey) {{is diagnosed}} with AIDS and given 30 days to live.

He is soon ostracized by family and friends and gets fired from his job, believed by family, friends and coworkers to have had homosexual relations, and is eventually evicted from his home. At the hospital, he is tended to by Dr. Eve Saks (Jennifer Garner), who tells him that they are testing a drug called zidovudine (AZT), an antiretroviral drug which is thought to prolong the life of AIDS patients—and is the only drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for testing on humans. Dr. Saks informs him that in the clinical trials, half the patients receive the drug and the other half are given a placebo, as {{this is the only way}} they can determine if the drug is working.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] To {{estimate}} {{the prevalence of}} infection with HIV in young offenders in Scotland and to obtain information about related risk factors and previous tests for HIV. DESIGN [...] Voluntary anonymous study with subjects giving saliva samples for testing for HIV and completing questionnaires about risk factors. SETTING [...] Polmont Young Offenders' Institution near Falkirk, Scotland. SUBJECTS [...] 421 of 424 available male prisoners in Polmont. The questionnaires of 17 of the prisoners {{were excluded because of}} inaccuracies. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Prevalence of infection with HIV and related risk behaviour. RESULTS [...] 68 (17 %) of prisoners admitted misuse of <b>intravenous</b> <b>drugs,</b> of whom 17 (25 %) admitted having injected drugs while in prison. Three subjects admitted having anal intercourse while in prison. Prevalence of misuse of <b>intravenous</b> <b>drugs</b> varied geographically: 28 % (33 / 120) of prisoners from Glasgow compared with 9 % (7 / 81) of those from Edinburgh and Fife. A high level of heterosexual activity was reported, with 36 % (142 / 397) of prisoners claiming to have had six or more female sexual partners in the year before they were imprisoned. Altogether 8 % (32 / 389) of prisoners had previously taken a personal test for HIV: 50 % (9 / 18) of those who had started misusing <b>intravenous</b> <b>drugs</b> before 1989, 18 % (9 / 49) of those who started misuse later, and only 4 % (14 / 322) of those who had not misused <b>intravenous</b> <b>drugs.</b> No saliva sample tested positive for antibodies to HIV, but 96 prisoners requested a confidential personal test for HIV as a result of heightened awareness generated by the study.
