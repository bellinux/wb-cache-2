Most companies undertake an IPO with the assistance of an investment banking firm acting in the capacity of an underwriter.

Alternative methods such as the <b>dutch</b> <b>auction</b> have also been explored.

25|$|An auction is {{a process}} of buying and selling goods or {{services}} by offering them up for bid, taking bids, and then selling the item to the highest bidder. The open ascending price auction is arguably {{the most common form of}} auction in use today. Participants bid openly against one another, with each subsequent bid required to be higher than the previous bid. An auctioneer may announce prices, bidders may call out their bids themselves (or have a proxy call out a bid on their behalf), or bids may be submitted electronically with the highest current bid publicly displayed. In a <b>Dutch</b> <b>auction,</b> the auctioneer begins with a high asking price for some quantity of like items; the price is lowered until a participant is willing to accept the auctioneer's price for some quantity of the goods in the lot or until the seller's reserve price is met. While auctions are most associated in the public imagination with the sale of antiques, paintings, rare collectibles and expensive wines, auctions are also used for commodities, livestock, radio spectrum and used cars. In economic theory, an auction may refer to any mechanism or set of trading rules for exchange.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Dutch</b> <b>auction</b> {{also known}} as an open {{descending}} price auction. In the traditional <b>Dutch</b> <b>auction</b> the auctioneer begins with a high asking price for some quantity of like items; the price is lowered until a participant is {{willing to accept the}} auctioneer's price for some quantity of the goods in the lot or until the seller's reserve price is met. If the first bidder does not purchase the entire lot, the auctioneer continues lowering the price until all of the items have been bid for or the reserve price is reached. Items are allocated based on bid order; the highest bidder selects their item(s) first followed by the second highest bidder, etc. In a modification, all of the winning participants pay only the last announced price for the items that they bid on. The <b>Dutch</b> <b>auction</b> is named for its best known example, the Dutch tulip auctions. ("Dutch auction" [...] is also sometimes used to describe online auctions where several identical goods are sold simultaneously to an equal number of high bidders.) In addition to cut flower sales in the Netherlands, Dutch auctions have also been used for perishable commodities such as fish and tobacco. The <b>Dutch</b> <b>auction</b> is not widely used, except in market orders in stock or currency exchanges, which are functionally identical.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to the extensive international evidence that auctions have not been popular for IPOs, there is no U.S. evidence {{to indicate that the}} <b>Dutch</b> <b>Auction</b> fares any better than the traditional IPO in an unwelcoming market environment.

2500|$|In {{determining}} {{the success or}} failure of a <b>Dutch</b> <b>Auction,</b> one must consider competing objectives. If the objective is to reduce risk, a traditional IPO may be more effective because the underwriter manages the process, rather than leaving the outcome in part to random chance in terms of who chooses to bid or what strategy each bidder chooses to follow. From the viewpoint of the investor, the <b>Dutch</b> <b>Auction</b> allows everyone equal access. [...] Moreover, some forms of the <b>Dutch</b> <b>Auction</b> allow the underwriter to be more active in coordinating bids and even communicating general auction trends to some bidders during the bidding period. Some have also argued that a uniform price auction is more effective at price discovery, although the theory behind this is based on the assumption of independent private values (that the value of IPO shares to each bidder is entirely independent of their value to others, even though the shares will shortly be traded on the aftermarket). [...] Theory that incorporates assumptions more appropriate to IPOs does not find that sealed bid auctions are an effective form of price discovery, although possibly some modified form of auction might give a better result.|$|E

Before this, Treasury bills were auctioned through a discriminatory or pay-what-you-bid auction, in which the various winning bidders each paid the price (or yield) they bid, and thus the various winning bidders did not all pay the same price.

In this type of auction all bidders {{simultaneously}} submit sealed bids so that no bidder knows the bid of any other participant. The highest bidder pays the price they submitted. This type of auction is distinct from the English auction, in that bidders can only submit one bid each. Furthermore, as bidders cannot see the bids of other participants they cannot adjust their own bids accordingly. From the theoretical perspective, this kind of bid process has been argued to be strategically equivalent to the <b>Dutch</b> <b>auction.</b> However, empirical evidence from laboratory experiments has shown that Dutch auctions with high clock speeds yield lower prices than FPSB auctions.
