40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, {{numerous}} studies have estimated the economic impacts {{of a variety of}} disruptions. Most of these studies are based on macroeconomic models that quantify the direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>economic</b> losses from a disruption. Direct economic losses occur due to damaged facilities or when consumers change their purchasing behavior because of the disruption. <b>Indirect</b> <b>economic</b> losses occur when directly impacted businesses consequently reduce their orders to their suppliers. <b>Indirect</b> <b>economic</b> losses are often larger than direct economic losses. This paper compiles the results from these economic models in order to compare the costs of different disruptions and help decision makers prioritize among disruptions. We compare the direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>economic</b> losses from a variety of disruptions, including earthquakes, hurricanes, terrorist attacks, pandemic diseases, and port closures. Some studies model hypothetical scenarios, but other studies quantify the economic losses from historical events such as the September 11 attacks and the 2011 Japanese tsunami. This paper provides a useful benchmark to understand the consequences from disruptions and highlight areas that public officials could address in planning for future disruptions...|$|R

40|$|This study evaluates {{and compares}} the <b>indirect</b> <b>economic</b> loss (IEL) {{resulting}} from two hypothetical catastrophes occurring in China – in developed Shanghai and in less-developed Sichuan – to provide new measures of disaster reduction. IEL {{was divided into}} <b>indirect</b> <b>economic</b> loss due to the disruption of production process (IEL I) and <b>indirect</b> <b>economic</b> loss induced by the disturbance of industrial lines (IEL II). An input-output model {{was used to assess}} these two types of IEL. The study showed that (1) developed regions may be more vulnerable with respect to IEL; (2) IEL II is the primary factor contributing to total IEL; (3) decision makers need to focus on IEL II beside IEL I which is usually the main disaster-reduction target after a disaster; and (4) tradeoff between economic growth and disaster prevention is needed to achieve regional sustainable development...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Economic {{effects of}} {{short-term}} close for small airports include direct <b>economic</b> losses and <b>indirect</b> <b>economic</b> losses. The <b>indirect</b> <b>economic</b> losses {{can be calculated}} by the input-output method in term of the economic effect of short-term close on revelant regions and industries. The direct economic losses comes mainly from airport agencies and can be obtained in accordance with Civil Airport Charge Reform Scheme(2007). The Weihai International Airport of China is a study case chosen to estimate the economic effects of short-term close. The results demonstrate that the direct economic loss of short-term close is 93, 048, 915 ¥ and the <b>indirect</b> <b>economic</b> loss of short-term close is more than 30, 000, 000 ¥. Pulling effects of the airport have significant influence on energy source industry, manufacturing industry, air transportation, etc. Promoting effects of the airport have enormous effect on postal industry, air transportation, etc...|$|R

40|$|International audienceDisaster loss {{estimates}} are helpful for managing post-disaster reconstruction and for designing disaster-risk mitigation strategies. However, {{most of these}} estimates in China merely consider direct losses, {{and only a few}} include <b>indirect</b> <b>economic</b> losses. As the most destructive earthquake since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, the Wenchuan Earthquake that occurred in 2008 resulted in direct economic damages reached Chinese Yuan (CNY) 845 billion (US $ 124 billion). The aim {{of the study was to}} estimate <b>indirect</b> <b>economic</b> losses caused by the Wenchuan Earthquake in Sichuan Province through the Adaptive Regional Input-Output (ARIO) model, which can reflect disaster-related changes in production capacity, ripple effects within the economic system, and adaptive behaviors of economic actors. The results showed that <b>indirect</b> <b>economic</b> losses in the production and housing sectors were estimated at 40 % of the direct economic losses, i. e., approximately CNY 300 billion; moreover, the model predicted an 8 -year reconstruction period. Several factors contributed to these losses, including significant damages to key sectors, financial constraints on reconstruction, post-earthquake investment instability, and limits in reconstruction capacity. Active government support policies post-earthquake are a useful strategy to mitigate the adverse economic impact of an earthquake in developing countries...|$|R
40|$|The {{total losses}} caused by natural {{disasters}} have spatial heterogeneity {{due to the}} different economic development levels inside the disaster-hit areas. This paper uses scenarios of direct economic loss to introduce the sectors' losses caused by the 2008  Wenchuan earthquake (2008  WCE) in Beijing, utilizing the Adaptive Regional Input–Output (ARIO) model and the Inter-regional ripple effect (IRRE) model. The purpose is to assess the ripple effects of <b>indirect</b> <b>economic</b> loss and spatial heterogeneity of both direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>economic</b> loss at {{the scale of the}} smallest administrative divisions of China (streets, villages, and towns). The results indicate that the district of Beijing with the most severe <b>indirect</b> <b>economic</b> loss is the Chaoyang District; the finance and insurance industry (15, see Table  1) of Chaowai Street suffers the most in the Chaoyang District, which is 1. 46  times that of its direct economic loss. During  2008 – 2014, the average annual GDP (gross domestic product) growth rate of Beijing was decreased 3. 63  % by the catastrophe. Compared with the 8  % of GDP growth rate target, the decreasing GDP growth rate is a significant and noticeable economic impact, and it can be efficiently mitigated by increasing rescue effort and by supporting the industries which are located in the seriously damaged regions...|$|R

40|$|The {{harmonisation}} of <b>economic</b> <b>interests</b> {{is one of}} {{the essential}} preconditions for the development of enterprises, including small ones. As practice shows, the harmonisation of major interests of small innovative business requires not only market instruments, but also state regulation, which demands the development of a corresponding mechanism. This study sets out to develop and justify the macroeconomic mechanism of development of small innovative enterprises on the basis of harmonisation of basic <b>economic</b> <b>interests</b> of their agents. The research significance of the results presented in the article consists in the fact that, for the first time, the problem of <b>economic</b> <b>interest</b> harmonisation has been considered in relation to the agents of small innovative business. The author juxtaposes the major <b>economic</b> <b>interests</b> of these agents and identifies their compatibility and conflict areas. The article offers a mechanism for the development of small innovative businesses, including two sets of instruments — those aimed at combining the agents’ efforts {{on the basis of their}} common <b>economic</b> <b>interests</b> and prevention of conflicts resulting from their incompatibility. The recommendations on the application of instruments for harmonising <b>economic</b> <b>interests</b> can be used in drawing up programmes for the development of small innovative business at the federal, regional, and municipal level...|$|R

40|$|The {{influence}} of <b>economic</b> <b>interest</b> groups on national policy-making on European Union-level policy and European integration {{seems to be}} case specific and circumstantial. Certain <b>economic</b> <b>interests</b> (for example, pension funds) are so influential {{that some of them}} become almost inseparable from the state. However, <b>economic</b> <b>interests</b> are less likely to become influential when broad institutional questions are negotiated, rather than specific rules with a clear cost-benefit balance. And it is especially when they feel challenged by the state that they turn their efforts to EU-level lobbying. The record of <b>economic</b> <b>interest</b> groups in EU policy-making appears also to be mixed. They are influential when they enjoy privileged institutionalised interactions with a policy-making node, such as European Parliament (EP) committees. However, access to the EP has recently become less privileged and institutional advocacy has become more contested, to the disadvantage of <b>interest</b> groups.
