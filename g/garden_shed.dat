5|$|Wood Siding {{initially}} had no {{facilities for}} passengers, {{not even a}} platform. In 1894 a low platform and small corrugated iron waiting room were built for passengers. As well as the passenger platform, a short siding led to a raised wooden platform, alongside the through line to Brill, which served both as a buffer stop for the siding, and as a loading platform for milk. The station was staffed by a single porter, responsible for opening the gates of a nearby level crossing and for loading and unloading freight (mainly milk); a small, unheated hut was provided for his use. While the original Aveling & Porter locomotive was slow and noisy and could be heard by the porter long before its arrival, later locomotives were quieter and quicker; a ladder was installed against a large oak for the porter to watch for oncoming trains. Wood Siding station and its siding were rebuilt at the GWR's expense between 1908–1910 to stand on a wide bridge above the new Chiltern Main Line. Wood Siding {{was removed from the}} timetable by 1931, although trains continued to stop on request. While Wood Siding station was demolished shortly after closure, the abutments of the bridge which carried the station and sidings remain intact. The porter's hut survives as a nearby <b>garden</b> <b>shed.</b>|$|E

25|$|The National Tramway Museum at Crich in Derbyshire holds eight Sheffield trams. Sheffield Corporation Tramways car 15 is a horse tram {{dating from}} 1874; {{it was the}} first tram to be used at the museum in 1963 and still remains servicable. Car 74 is another Victorian Sheffield tram, sold to the Gateshead tramway and ran until 1951.

In addition there are two Sheffield works cars and an early single-deck tram that is not in working condition.|$|E
25|$|Rectangular, wooden, <b>garden</b> <b>shed</b> style police {{boxes were}} {{introduced}} in Sunderland in 1923 by Chief Constable Frederick J. Crawley, and then in Newcastle in 1925 {{when he took over}} as Chief Constable there. Crawley was arguably the first proponent (at least in Britain) of the concept of the police box as a miniature police station rather than just a communications point, including unrestricted access to the telephone by the general public for contacting police, ambulance, and fire services. His well publicised success with these boxes, and the revised policing methods they allowed, soon led to the adoption of similar police box systems in many of the larger cities in the north of England, including Manchester and Sheffield.|$|E

25|$|The {{producers}} and director James Strong paid {{particular attention to}} the visual style of the reveal. Chibnall wanted to expose the murderer's identity visually and dynamically, not through dialogue in a static scene on a set. During a location site visit prior to filming, Chibnall, Strong, and Holmes walked from the house at Lavington Close to the house on St Andrews Drive. As they crossed a footbridge over the Land Yeo, Chibnall—struck by the scenery of the area—realised that a single, uncut point of view shot of DI Hardy walking through the Miller house, through the garden, and into the <b>garden</b> <b>shed</b> was the way to reveal the killer's identity. Chibnall and Strong decided that the shot in the first episode of Mark Latimer walking through the Broadchurch High Street should mimic this reveal shot in the eighth episode.|$|E
500|$|Beginning in 1996, Warren {{served as}} the island's only police officer. However, since {{no one had been}} arrested on the island since the 1950s, her duties {{involved}} issuing driving licenses and stamping visitors' passports. Warren had no qualifications or formal training to be a police officer, and was given the job because everyone on the island had a [...] "job". [...] The island's jail was described as [...] "the size of a <b>garden</b> <b>shed</b> and riddled with termites," [...] and its cells had been used to store building materials and lifejackets.

500|$|Generally, {{all four}} members agreed that Waters' album concept unified {{by a single}} theme was a good idea. Waters, Gilmour, Mason and keyboardist Richard Wright participated in the writing and {{production}} of the new material, and Waters created the early demo tracks at his Islington home in a small studio built in his <b>garden</b> <b>shed.</b> Parts of the new album were taken from previously unused material; the opening line of [...] "Breathe" [...] came from an earlier work by Waters and Ron Geesin, written for the soundtrack of The Body, and {{the basic structure of}} [...] "Us and Them" [...] borrowed from an original composition by Wright for Zabriskie Point. The band rehearsed at a warehouse in London owned by The Rolling Stones, and then at the Rainbow Theatre in Finsbury Park, London. They also purchased extra equipment, which included new speakers, a PA system, a 28-track mixing desk with four quadraphonic outputs, and a custom-built lighting rig. Nine tonnes of kit was transported in three lorries; this would be the first time the band had taken an entire album on tour, but allowed improvement and refinery nonetheless, which by then had been given the provisional title of Dark Side of the Moon (an allusion to lunacy, rather than astronomy). However, after discovering that that title had already been used by another band, Medicine Head, it was temporarily changed to Eclipse. The new material premièred at The Dome in Brighton, on 20 January 1972, and after the commercial failure of Medicine Head's album the title was changed back to the band's original preference.|$|E

[...] It had a float metered carburetor, used mushroom intake valves which were opened by the suction of the piston's intake stroke, and instead of an electrical ignition system, it used hot tube ignition, a platinum tube running into the combustion chamber, heated by an external open flame. [...] It could also run on coal gas. It used twin flywheels and had an aluminum crankcase.|$|E
2500|$|Normally Kilburn High Road and Stonebridge Power House which {{controlled}} only plain {{track with}} crossovers were switched out and only Queens Park, Willesden and Harrow boxes were staffed {{for at least}} part of the day, to deal with junction and siding traffic. In the early 1980s manual control of signalling was needed for a few months after dragging gear on a train destroyed many electric train-stops which were of a design almost confined to this line (LU train-stops are mostly electro-pneumatic). By this time the signal boxes at Stonebridge Power House and Kilburn High Road had been abolished. Emergency crossovers at other locations were controlled by [...] ground frames enclosed in structures the size of a <b>garden</b> <b>shed.</b>|$|E

He continued collecting minerals and insects, and family holidays in Wales brought Charles new opportunities, but an older sister ruled that [...] "it was not right to kill insects" [...] for his collections, {{and he had to}} find dead ones. He read Gilbert White's The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne and took up birdwatching. Eras took an interest in chemistry and Charles became his assistant, with the two using a <b>garden</b> <b>shed</b> at their home fitted out as a laboratory and extending their interests to crystallography. When Eras went on to a medical course at the University of Cambridge, Charles continued to rush home to the shed on weekends, and for this received the nickname [...] "Gas". The headmaster was not amused at this diversion from studying the classics, calling him a poco curante (trifler) in front of the boys. At fifteen, his interest shifted to hunting and bird-shooting at local estates, particularly at Maer in Staffordshire, the home of his relatives, the Wedgwoods. His exasperated father once told him off, saying [...] "You care for nothing but shooting, dogs, and rat-catching, and you will be a disgrace to yourself and all your family." ...|$|E
