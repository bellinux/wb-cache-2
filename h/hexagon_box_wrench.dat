50|$|When {{the handle}} of a pipe <b>wrench,</b> <b>box</b> <b>wrench</b> or ratchet is {{inserted}} into a cheater bar, the additional distance {{makes it possible to}} generate the required torque with the same amount of force being applied. However, the work done is the same with or without the cheater bar because the torque and angle of rotation needed to accomplish a particular task does not change.|$|R
5000|$|A {{peanut butter}} wrench, {{also known as}} a crank bolt spanner or a crank spanner, is a {{single-ended}} <b>box</b> <b>wrench</b> or ring spanner used in cycling to tighten older 14 mm and 15 mm crank bolts, or the wheel nuts (track nuts) on hubs with solid axles commonly found on track bicycles, particularly the 15 mm wrench made by Campagnolo. This is the only one-piece wrench {{that can be used to}} tighten or loosen the bolt or nut which holds the crank to a square-taper bottom bracket spindle (although a thin-walled 15 mm socket and handle will also serve), whereas any wrench/spanner of the correct size will tighten or loosen wheel nuts.|$|R

5000|$|When {{working with}} common 6-point {{hexagonal}} fasteners, the 12-point shaped socket offers {{double the amount}} of starting points or possible positions by which to put the socket on the nut. This is of large importance on a <b>box</b> <b>wrench</b> which is typically adjustable in 15 or 30 degree increments. This versatility of fitting position is normally of small importance on a socket wrench which can be easily rotated in small increments regardless of socket type. Since loading contact points between the nut and socket are at the corner points (not the flats), twelve point sockets have more than adequate strength for most applications where nut and socket are in good condition. If the nut or socket is rounded by wear, using a [...] "double" [...] shaped socket {{is more likely to}} results in slippage or further rounding off and possible stripping of either the bolt head, nut or socket. This versatility is the main purpose of the 12-point shape found in common sockets, but is essential when working with 12-point bolt and nut heads. Socket strength is mainly a function of the alloys and heat treatments used to make the socket along with wall thickness of the socket wrench as measured at the corner points (thinnest section).|$|R
6000|$|As he spoke, Stanley {{turned to}} his wife, and said, [...] "Jessie, hold on by my collar; I'll take Eda in my arms." [...] At that instant the canoe gave a lurch, and before Stanley could grasp his child, they were all {{struggling}} in the sea! At this awful moment, instead of endeavouring to do as her husband directed, Mrs Stanley instinctively {{threw her arms around}} Edith, and while the waves were boiling over her, she clasped the child tightly to her bosom with her left arm, while with her right she endeavoured to raise herself to the surface. Twice she succeeded, and twice she sank, when a box of merchandise providentially struck her arm. Seizing this, she raised herself above the water, and poor Edith gasped convulsively once or twice for air. Then the <b>box</b> was <b>wrenched</b> from her grasp by a wave, and with a wild shriek she sank again. Just then a strong arm was thrown around her, her feet touched the ground, and in a few seconds she was dragged violently from the roaring waves and fell exhausted on the beach.|$|R
5000|$|Some sockets are {{designed}} {{to have the same}} outside diameter and shape within a given set size. Each pass-through socket, within a given socket set, is designed to be used with a [...] "special" [...] ratchet that fits {{on the outside of the}} socket and not to the middle of the socket. By fitting the outside of the socket they allow the bolt or stud to extend through the socket, eliminating the need for a deep socket in some applications. By attaching to the outside of the socket they also allow the socket to be built up to 50% shorter and with 20% less width which is an advantage in some situations. Pass-through sockets and ratchets are built for 1/4", 3/8" [...] and 1/2" [...] sets in both SAE and metric sizes. By using a fine tooth ratchet and socket system that allow a pass-through ratchet to be used as a conventional ratchet handle with interchangeable 1/4-inch and 3/8-inch drives some ratchets can be used with standard sockets. They are built by a number of manufacturers with a variety of trade names. Craftsman Tools call theirs--Max Axess, and also sells GearWrench's Pass-Thru brands. Lowes calls their socket system Xtreme Access, etc.. Ratcheting <b>box</b> end <b>wrenches</b> can often be employed in the same application but will nearly always be significantly wider.|$|R
60|$|The door of {{this was}} firmly locked; but a big hole had been torn in the roof by bears, and I crawled in by that entrance. Mooween had been here many times ahead of me. Every corner of the big room, the bunks and the {{cupboards}} and even the stove, had been ransacked {{from one end to}} the other; and the strong, doggy smell of a bear was everywhere, showing how recently he had searched the place. Here in a corner a large tin <b>box</b> had been <b>wrenched</b> open, and flour was scattered over the floor and deacon-seat, as if a whirlwind had struck the place. Mooween was playful evidently; or perhaps he was mad that the stuff for which he had taken so much trouble was too dry to eat. The white print of one paw was drawn everywhere on the floor and walls. This was the paw of a little bear, who had undoubtedly come late, and had to be content with what the others had left.|$|R
50|$|The race {{restarted}} on lap 80. For {{the first}} few laps, Truex, Jr. kept Hamlin from getting a big lead, but as the field caught {{the tail end of}} the field, Hamlin jumped to a bigger lead. Eventually, Truex, Jr. took back the lead on lap 145. The second round of pit stops began on lap 150 when Clint Bowyer hit pit road. Truex, Jr. surrendered the lead to pit on lap 158 and gave it to Hamlin. He pitted on lap 160 and handed the lead to teammate Carl Edwards. He pitted on lap 162 and handed the lead to Dale Earnhardt Jr. The second caution flew on lap 163 when Ricky Stenhouse Jr. had a tire blow out and slammed the wall in turn 2. David Gilliland was tagged for speeding on pit road during the green flag stops and was forced to serve a drive-through penalty. Edwards was tagged for taking equipment out of the pit <b>box</b> after the <b>wrench</b> used to adjust the track bar got stuck in the hole and restarted the race from {{the tail end of the}} field.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, one Marx product line showed a greater sophistication in toy offerings. The [...] "Fix All" [...] series was introduced, whose main {{attraction}} was larger plastic vehicles (about 14 inches long) {{that could be}} taken apart and put back together with included tools and equipment. A 1953 Pontiac convertible (erroneously identified on packaging as a sedan), and a 1953 Mercury Monterey station wagon which featured an articulated drive-line. Everything from the pistons to the crankshaft to the rear axle gears were visible through clear plastic, and wood-trim decals for the sides finished off this marvelous model. A very large 1953 Chrysler convertible, a 1953 Jaguar XK120 roadster, a WWII-era Willys Jeep, a Dodge-ish utility truck, a tow truck, a tractor, a larger scale motorcycle, a helicopter, {{and a couple of}} airplanes were all part of the Fix All series. The cars' boxes boasted features like [...] "Over 50 parts" [...] and [...] "For a real mechanic!" [...] As an example, the tow truck came with cast metal <b>box</b> and open <b>wrenches,</b> an adjustable end wrench, a two-piece jack, gas can, hammer, screwdriver, and fire extinguisher. The Jeep came with a star wrench, a screw jack and working lights.|$|R

The race restarted on lap 169 with Truex, Jr. in the lead. The third caution of the race flew on lap 176 for a 3-car wreck on the front stretch. This began when Trevor Bayne, while exiting turn 4, was moving up the track and got turned by Michael Annett. He overcorrected, turned down, and hit the inside wall. Annett continued to ride the wall before getting rear-ended by Allgaier. Annett continued on, but Allgaier did not. While Truex opted not to pit, most of the cars on the lead lap behind him did. The race restarted with two laps to go at a scheduled green-white-checker finish, Johnson shot ahead of teammate Kasey Kahne and held off Harvick to score his tenth career win at Dover. He became the fifth driver to have 10 or more wins at a single track.|$|R
