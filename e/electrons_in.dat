5|$|Independent {{electrons}} {{moving in}} vacuum are termed free electrons. <b>Electrons</b> <b>in</b> metals also behave {{as if they}} were free. In reality the particles that are commonly termed <b>electrons</b> <b>in</b> metals and other solids are quasi-electrons—quasiparticles, which have the same electrical charge, spin, and magnetic moment as real electrons but might have a different mass. When free electrons—both in vacuum and metals—move, they produce a net flow of charge called an electric current, which generates a magnetic field. Likewise a current can be created by a changing magnetic field. These interactions are described mathematically by Maxwell's equations.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of the noble gases aided {{in the development of}} a general understanding of atomic structure. In 1895, French chemist Henri Moissan attempted to form a reaction between fluorine, the most electronegative element, and argon, one of the noble gases, but failed. Scientists were unable to prepare compounds of argon until the end of the 20th century, but these attempts helped to develop new theories of atomic structure. Learning from these experiments, Danish physicist Niels Bohr proposed in 1913 that the <b>electrons</b> <b>in</b> atoms are arranged in shells surrounding the nucleus, and that for all noble gases except helium the outermost shell always contains eight <b>electrons.</b> <b>In</b> 1916, Gilbert N. Lewis formulated the octet rule, which concluded an octet of <b>electrons</b> <b>in</b> the outer shell was the most stable arrangement for any atom; this arrangement caused them to be unreactive with other elements since they did not require any more electrons to complete their outer shell.|$|E
5|$|A {{nitrogen}} atom {{has seven}} <b>electrons.</b> <b>In</b> the ground state, they {{are arranged in}} the electron configuration 1s2s2p2p2p. It therefore has five valence <b>electrons</b> <b>in</b> the 2s and 2p orbitals, three of which (the p-electrons) are unpaired. It {{has one of the}} highest electronegativities among the elements (3.04 on the Pauling scale), exceeded only by chlorine (3.16), oxygen (3.44), and fluorine (3.98). Following periodic trends, its single-bond covalent radius of 71pm is smaller than those of boron (84pm) and carbon (76pm), while it is larger than those of oxygen (66pm) and fluorine (57pm). The nitride anion, N3−, is much larger at 146pm, similar to that of the oxide (O2−: 140pm) and fluoride (F−: 133pm) anions. The first three ionisation energies of nitrogen are 1.402, 2.856, and 4.577MJ·mol−1, and the sum of the fourth and fifth is 16.920MJ·mol−1. Due to these very high figures, nitrogen has no simple cationic chemistry.|$|E
50|$|An orbital is a {{stationary}} state (or approximation thereof) of a one-electron atom or molecule; more specifically, an atomic orbital for an <b>electron</b> <b>in</b> an atom, or a molecular orbital for an <b>electron</b> <b>in</b> a molecule.|$|R

5|$|Fluorine atoms {{have nine}} {{electron}}s, one fewer than neon, and electron configuration 1s22s22p5: two <b>electrons</b> <b>in</b> a filled inner shell and seven in an outer shell requiring one {{more to be}} filled. The outer electrons are ineffective at nuclear shielding, and experience a high effective nuclear charge of 9 − 2 = 7; this affects the atom's physical properties.|$|E
5|$|In the {{standard}} periodic table, the elements {{are listed in}} order of increasing atomic number Z (the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom). A new row (period) is started when a new electron shell has its first electron. Columns (groups) {{are determined by the}} electron configuration of the atom; elements with the same number of <b>electrons</b> <b>in</b> a particular subshell fall into the same columns (e.g. oxygen and selenium are in the same column because they both have four <b>electrons</b> <b>in</b> the outermost p-subshell). Elements with similar chemical properties generally fall into the same group in the periodic table, although in the f-block, and to some respect in the d-block, the elements in the same period tend to have similar properties, as well. Thus, it is relatively easy to predict the chemical properties of an element if one knows the properties of the elements around it.|$|E
5|$|Planetary {{models of}} atoms were not new, but Bohr's {{treatment}} was. Taking the 1912 paper by Darwin {{on the role}} of <b>electrons</b> <b>in</b> the interaction of alpha particles with a nucleus as his starting point, he advanced the theory of electrons travelling in orbits around the atom's nucleus, with the chemical properties of each element being largely determined by the number of <b>electrons</b> <b>in</b> the outer orbits of its atoms. He introduced the idea that an electron could drop from a higher-energy orbit to a lower one, in the process emitting a quantum of discrete energy. This became a basis for what is now known as the old quantum theory.|$|E
50|$|It {{is common}} to {{describe}} where electrons reside as <b>electron</b> bands <b>in</b> bulk materials and <b>electron</b> orbitals <b>in</b> molecules. For the sake of expedience the following description will be described in molecular terms. When a photon excites a molecule, an <b>electron</b> <b>in</b> a ground state orbital can be excited to a higher energy orbital. This excited state leaves a vacancy in a ground state orbital that can be filled by an electron donor. It produces an <b>electron</b> <b>in</b> a high energy orbital which can be donated to an <b>electron</b> acceptor. <b>In</b> these respects a photoexcited molecule {{can act as a}} good oxidizing agent or a good reducing agent.|$|R

5|$|Rhodium {{belongs to}} group 9 of the {{periodic}} table, but {{the configuration of}} <b>electrons</b> <b>in</b> the outermost shells is atypical for the group. This anomaly is also observed in the neighboring elements, niobium (41), ruthenium (44), and palladium (46).|$|E
5|$|The {{distribution}} of the <b>electrons</b> <b>in</b> solid materials can be visualized by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). This technique employs the photoelectric effect to measure the reciprocal space—a mathematical representation of periodic structures {{that is used to}} infer the original structure. ARPES can be used to determine the direction, speed and scattering of electrons within the material.|$|E
5|$|The {{electron}} configuration or organisation of electrons orbiting neutral atoms shows a recurring pattern or periodicity. The electrons occupy {{a series of}} electron shells (numbered shell 1, shell 2, and so on). Each shell consists {{of one or more}} subshells (named s, p, d, f and g). As atomic number increases, electrons progressively fill these shells and subshells more or less according to the Madelung rule or energy ordering rule, as shown in the diagram. The {{electron configuration}} for neon, for example, is 1s2 2s2 2p6. With an atomic number of ten, neon has two <b>electrons</b> <b>in</b> the first shell, and eight <b>electrons</b> <b>in</b> the second shell—two in the s subshell and six in the p subshell. In periodic table terms, the first time an electron occupies a new shell corresponds to the start of each new period, these positions being occupied by hydrogen and the alkali metals.|$|E

5|$|Whereas {{all other}} group 8 {{elements}} have 2 <b>electrons</b> <b>in</b> the outermost shell, in ruthenium, the outermost shell {{has only one}} electron (the final electron is in a lower shell).

5|$|A {{thallium}} atom has 81 electrons, {{arranged in}} the electron configuration 4f145d106s26p1; of these, the three outermost <b>electrons</b> <b>in</b> the sixth shell are valence electrons. Due to the inert pair effect, the 6s electron pair is relativistically stabilised {{and it is}} more difficult to get them involved in chemical bonding than for the heavier elements. Thus, very few electrons are available for metallic bonding, similar to the neighboring elements mercury and lead, and hence thallium, like its congeners, is a soft, highly electrically conducting metal with a low melting point of 304°C.|$|E
5|$|Although thin, these {{outer layers}} {{determine}} the thermal {{evolution of the}} white dwarf. The degenerate <b>electrons</b> <b>in</b> the bulk of a white dwarf conduct heat well. Most of a white dwarf's mass is therefore at almost the same temperature (isothermal), {{and it is also}} hot: a white dwarf with surface temperature between 8,000K and 16,000K will have a core temperature between approximately 5,000,000K and 20,000,000K. The white dwarf is kept from cooling very quickly only by its outer layers' opacity to radiation.|$|E

5|$|Chemical {{bonds between}} atoms were now explained, by Gilbert Newton Lewis in 1916, as the {{interactions}} between their constituent electrons. As the chemical properties of the elements were known to largely repeat themselves according to the periodic law, in 1919 the American chemist Irving Langmuir suggested {{that this could be}} explained if the <b>electrons</b> <b>in</b> an atom were connected or clustered in some manner.

5|$|Compression of a {{white dwarf}} will {{increase}} the number of <b>electrons</b> <b>in</b> a given volume. Applying the Pauli exclusion principle, this will increase the kinetic energy of the electrons, thereby increasing the pressure. This electron degeneracy pressure supports a white dwarf against gravitational collapse. The pressure depends only on density and not on temperature. Degenerate matter is relatively compressible; this means that the density of a high-mass white dwarf is much greater than that of a low-mass white dwarf and that the radius {{of a white}} dwarf decreases as its mass increases.|$|E
