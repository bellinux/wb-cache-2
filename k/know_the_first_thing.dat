2500|$|Dolphy and John Coltrane {{knew each}} other long before they {{formally}} played together, having met when Coltrane was in Los Angeles with Miles Davis. They would often exchange ideas and learn from each other, and eventually, after many nights sitting in with Coltrane's band, Dolphy was asked to become a full member. Coltrane had gained an audience and critical notice with Miles Davis's quintet, but alienated some jazz critics {{when he began to}} move away from hard bop. Although Coltrane's quintets with Dolphy (including the Village Vanguard and Africa/Brass sessions) are now well regarded, they originally provoked Down Beat magazine to brand Coltrane and Dolphy's music as 'anti-jazz'. Coltrane later said of this criticism: [...] "they made it appear that we didn't even <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> about music (...) it hurt me to see [...] get hurt in this thing." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{death of}} Kurdi and reports {{that his family}} {{had been trying to}} {{ultimately}} reach Canada had an immediate impact on domestic Canadian politics. Prime Minister and leader of the Conservative Party Stephen Harper cancelled a photo opportunity and addressed the issue in a campaign event. [...] "Yesterday, Laureen and I saw on the Internet, the picture of this young boy, Alan, dead on the beach. Look, I think, our reaction to that, you <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> that crossed our mind was remembering our son Ben at that age, running around like that" [...] Harper said. Minister of National Defence and Multiculturalism Jason Kenney cancelled an important announcement on Conservative efforts to protect the integrity of Canada’s immigration system and the security of Canada. Canadian Citizenship and Immigration Minister Chris Alexander announced he would be temporarily suspending his campaigning in the 2015 Canadian federal election to return to Ottawa to resume his ministerial duties and investigate the case of Alan Kurdi, whose uncle's application for refugee status had been rejected by his ministry.|$|E

Gag was imprisoned {{in the mountain}} after going on a rampage after being laughed at by Cliff, Bob and the inhabitants of Under during a festival. Bob freed Gag because he <b>knows</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> he'll do is head to Under to destroy the place and Russel will {{have no choice but}} to get Cliff's help, and the price will be the Crown of Under. Meanwhile, Loopy needs to get his nose bell fixed and we learn that he's more than just the court jester.|$|R
5000|$|Modjeska {{intended}} to abandon her career and envisioned herself living [...] "a life of toil under the blue skies of California, among the hills, riding on horseback {{with a gun}} over my shoulder." [...] The reality proved less cinematic. None of <b>the</b> colonists <b>knew</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> about ranching or farming, and they could barely speak English. The utopian experiment failed, the colonists went their separate ways, and Modjeska returned to the stage, reprising the Shakespearean roles that she had performed in Poland. Perhaps the best account of daily life on the ranch is Theodore Payne's memoir, Life on the Modjeska Ranch in the Gay Nineties.|$|R

On the voyage home he fidgeted ever so at the delay, and I <b>knew</b> that <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> he did, when he got back, would be to write to Master Herbert and tell him to bring his wife down to the Hall.

5000|$|Two other Zhuangzi {{contexts}} use hundun.

[...] "You have only to rest in inaction and things will transform themselves. Smash your form and body, spit out hearing and eyesight, forget you are a thing among other things, and you may join in great unity with the deep and boundless. Undo the mind, slough off spirit, be blank and soulless, and the ten thousand things one by one {{will return to the}} root - return to the root and not know why. Dark and undifferentiated chaos - to the end of life none will depart from it. But if you try to know it, you have already departed from it. Do not ask what its name is, do not try to observe its form. Things will live naturally and of themselves." [...] (tr.
