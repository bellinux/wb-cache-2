5|$|Aloof and arrogant, FBI {{special agent}} Barry Baldwin (Peter Outerbridge) works with Black and Hollis on several cases. During an FBI {{raid on the}} home of a serial killer whose brain was altered by the Millennium Group (triggering his killing spree), Baldwin is injured <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>explosion.</b> On the way to the hospital, he is murdered in the {{ambulance}} by a Millennium Group assassin.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{outbreak}} of World War II, he conducted experiments which showed that in the fission process, neutrons were emitted. In early 1939 he envisaged {{that a large number}} of fissions could occur and if this happened within a sufficiently short time, then considerable amounts of energy could be released. He went on to calculate that this process could occur in less than a microsecond, and as a consequence would result <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>explosion.</b>|$|E
5|$|Fort Stikine was a British Fort ship {{which was}} built in Canada in 1942. Owned by the American War Shipping Administration, she was leased under charter to the Ministry of War Transport under the Lend-Lease scheme and {{operated}} under {{the management of the}} Port Line. Fort Stikine only had a short career, and was destroyed <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>explosion</b> at Bombay, India, in April 1944 that caused the loss of a further thirteen ships.|$|E

5|$|Of {{the five}} major volcanoes in Washington, only Glacier Peak and Mount St. Helens have had large eruptions {{in the past}} 15,000 years. Since both volcanoes {{generate}} magma of dacitic origin, the viscous magma builds up since it cannot flow through the eruptive vent. Gradually, the pressure grows, culminating <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>explosion</b> that ejects materials such as tephra, which in its simplest form, is ash.|$|E
5|$|Pearl {{receives}} an emergency call when another super villain attacks. During the fight, Pearl sees Olivia caught <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>explosion.</b> Believing her friend dead, Pearl attacks the villain directly and suffers serious burns to {{her hands and}} face. She faints after she subdues him. She awakens in a hospital and finds herself healed except for her hair.|$|E
5|$|The nuclear {{properties}} of plutonium-239 were also studied; {{researchers found that}} when it is hit by a neutron it breaks apart (fissions) by releasing more neutrons and energy. These neutrons can hit other atoms of plutonium-239 and so on in an exponentially fast chain reaction. This can result <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>explosion</b> large enough to destroy a city if enough of the isotope is concentrated to form a critical mass.|$|E

50|$|There {{have been}} a number of notable {{accidents}} related to the manufacture and sale of fireworks in Mexico. <b>In</b> 1998, <b>an</b> <b>explosion</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> workshop <b>in</b> the Barrio de San Agustín neighborhood in Tultepec affected over one hundred houses and killed ten neighbors. <b>In</b> 1999, <b>an</b> <b>explosion</b> <b>in</b> Celaya left 56 dead and 350 hurt. In 2003, there was <b>an</b> <b>explosion</b> at the Miguel Hidalgo Market in Veracruz, which started at a clandestine fireworks warehouse that resulted in 28 dead, 35 hurt and 52 missing. <b>In</b> 2006 <b>an</b> <b>explosion</b> at the San Pablito market was attributed to a product called a “cerillo” (match) which consists of a colored stick with chemicals on both ends which produces sparks when scraped on a surface. This led to a yearlong ban on the product so its safety could be reevaluated. The last major accident in Tultepec was <b>in</b> 2016 when <b>a</b> major fireworks <b>explosion</b> <b>in</b> San Pablito killed at least 32.|$|R

5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, dance-oriented disco music was {{very popular in}} the United States, {{particularly}} after being featured in hit films such as Saturday Night Fever (1977). Despite its popularity, disco sparked a backlash from rock music fans. This opposition was prominent enough that the White Sox, seeking to fill seats at Comiskey Park during a lackluster season, engaged Chicago shock jock and anti-disco campaigner Steve Dahl for the promotion at the July12 doubleheader, the Thursday preceding the All-Star break. Dahl's sponsoring radio station was 97.9 WLUP-FM, so attendees would pay 98 cents and bring a disco record; between games, Dahl would destroy the collected vinyl <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>explosion.</b>|$|E
5|$|McCudden {{performed}} well and took on more administrative responsibilities {{once he was}} promoted to Corporal on 20 November 1914. During this period, the First Battle of Ypres was being fought and the Squadron re-equipped with the higher performing Morane-Saulnier L aircraft. Several months later, on 1 April 1915, {{he was promoted to}} sergeant and made NCO in charge of all engines in his flight. McCudden's delight at gaining a promotion was cut short by news that his brother William had been killed in an air crash while flying an elderly Blériot. Just a week later, his eldest sister Mary lost her husband <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>explosion</b> which destroyed the minelayer HMS Princess Irene on 27 May 1915.|$|E
5|$|Ranariddh has 12 half-siblings {{from his}} father by {{different}} wives; Norodom Buppha Devi is the only full-sibling of Ranariddh. Buppha Devi became a ballet dancer, like her mother Phat Kanhol had been during her younger days. Kanhol remarried in 1947 to a military officer, Chap Huot, and had five children with him. Phat Kanhol died from cancer in February 1969 {{at the age of}} 49, while Chap Huot was killed <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>explosion</b> a year later. Four of Ranariddh's half-siblings by his mother and Chap Huot were killed during the Khmer Rouge years, while one of them, Chap Nhalyvoud survived. Chap Nhalyvoud served as the governor of Siem Reap Province between 1998 and 2004.|$|E

5|$|The Machination {{performs}} a successful surgery on Hunter, and Ironhide is seemingly killed <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>explosion</b> {{set up by}} them. They now begin to manufacture their own army of Sunstreaker bodies. Shockwave and the Dynobots are excavated up by archaeologists in Eureka, Nevada and Skywatch takes over the area. In Oregon, two young humans wonder whether to buy Soundwave, still trapped in cassette player mode. Megatron calls Sixshot to come and speed up Earth's destruction, and the Reapers follow, eager to have Sixshot join their attempt to rid the universe of war-like species. Elsewhere on Earth, Ramjet's grandiose plans for a coup against Megatron fail when the Decepticon leader kills him in one-on-one combat.|$|E
5|$|Bruce is {{kept under}} {{observation}} at a secret desert base, while Talbot intends to weaponize the Hulk's powers. David tries to recreate Bruce's failed experiment, {{but instead of}} turning into another Hulk he finds himself able to absorb any material he touches or energy to which he is exposed. He hands himself over to the military after telling Betty that he had murdered his wife {{in front of the}} child Bruce. Bruce has a nightmare about the event, leading to a more powerful transformation of the Hulk. Talbot is killed <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>explosion</b> created when he attempted to use a special syringe to gain a sample of the creature. The Hulk escapes the base and rampages across the desert to San Francisco, battling Army forces sent after him. When Betty calms Bruce into his human form, General Ross realizes the Hulk is uncontrollable and that Bruce should be executed.|$|E
5|$|Steph {{sleeps with}} Niall. Niall then kills Tina Reilly (Leah Hackett) <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>explosion</b> and reveals {{that he was}} in fact Myra McQueen's (Nicole Barber-Lane) son.

Steph tricks Niall into believing she will run away with him but is later caught by Niall when she tries to call the police. Steph manages to get away and this results in Steph, Craig and Niall having a brawl {{on the edge of a}} cliff. When Steph reveals to Niall she will never love him he jumps off the cliff. Steph is left devastated by another loss in her life. When she returns home she finds that Niall has {{destroyed}} her wedding photos, the only piece of Max she had left. The sheer amount of trauma Steph has faced made her extremely shaken and she decided to leave for a break once more.|$|E

5|$|Swann takes Bond to L'Américain, a {{hotel in}} Tangier, and they {{discover}} that White left evidence directing them to Oberhauser's operations base at a massive crater in the Sahara. Taking a train to a remote station, Bond and Swann have an encounter with Hinx that sees the assassin killed, and are eventually escorted to Oberhauser's base. There, Oberhauser reveals that Spectre has been funding the Joint Intelligence Service while staging terrorist attacks around the world, creating a need for the Nine Eyes programme. In return C will give Spectre unlimited access to intelligence gathered by Nine Eyes, allowing them to anticipate and counter-act investigations into their operations. Bond is tortured as Oberhauser discusses their shared history: after the younger Bond was orphaned, Oberhauser's father Hannes became his temporary guardian. Believing that Bond supplanted his role as son, Oberhauser killed his father and staged his own death, adopting the name Ernst Stavro Blofeldgoing on to form Spectre and targeting Bond. Bond and Swann overpower him and escape, destroying the base <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>explosion</b> and leaving Blofeld to die.|$|E
5|$|The Smith Gun {{was capable}} of firing both anti-personnel and {{anti-tank}} rounds (the latter capable of penetrating some 60mm of armour), and provided the Home Guard and local defence units with a potentially potent anti-personnel and anti-armour weapon. However, there were several flaws in its design, and as such it was not well liked {{by some of the}} Home Guard units to which it was issued. It was heavy and awkward to manhandle, particularly over rough ground and in urban areas; in the latter, it was recommended that toggle ropes be used to manoeuvre the weapon into position. The low muzzle velocity meant that shells were lobbed in a high curved trajectory, making precise range calculations and firing experience vital. This was difficult when so few rounds were available for training, a problem compounded by early batches possessing faulty fuzes that led to the Smith Gun's alleged 'terrifying reputation for killing its crew'. (This probably arises from the first fatal malfunction when, during a live-fire exercise in 1942, Corporal Maynard of 2819 Squadron, RAF Regiment was killed <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>explosion.</b>|$|E
5|$|The video shifts {{again to}} Björk {{buried in the}} sand under the rain of ashes. The two pieces of rock appear again, this time each one with a Björk-shaped strata. The strata also sing parts of the song, and two arms come out from the {{floating}} rocks and their hands barely brush against each other. The rocks unite once again as the chorus begins for the second time. During {{this part of the}} video, images of Björk singing in a smoky setting alternate with more rocks uniting to the main two, while their Björk-shaped strata secrete a substance similar to lava from their mouth. All the rocks are now united, forming a big volcano, whose crater is shaped like two opposite Björk-shaped rocks. The volcano finally erupts <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>explosion</b> of magma, while a thunderstorm occurs in the background. The video ends as the volcano fades out and all that remains visible is ash and smoke.|$|E
