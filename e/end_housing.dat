5|$|By 1890 {{official}} {{slum clearance}} programmes had begun. One {{was the creation}} of the world's first council housing, the LCC Boundary Estate, which replaced the neglected and crowded streets of Friars Mount, better known as The Old Nichol Street Rookery. Between 1918 and 1939 the LCC continued replacing East <b>End</b> <b>housing</b> with five or six storey flats, despite residents preferring houses with gardens and opposition from shopkeepers who were forced to relocate to new, more expensive premises. The Second World War brought an end to further slum clearance.|$|E

The first miss of the shoot-out came from Ronaldo, who characteristically stuttered in his run-up in an attempt to put Čech off, but the goalkeeper dived to his right to save.|$|E

500|$|Chevron-carved {{voussoirs}} (wedges) {{and three}} stone human heads, weathered by time and also probably from the 12th century, have been repositioned over the doorway, {{which is at}} the west end of {{the south side of the}} church. The wedges probably come from a former chancel arch and apse, removed (as in other churches in Anglesey) to make the chancel larger. The doorway has been enlarged at some point, most likely during the early part of the 19th century. On the north side, a doorway was added in the 18th century, but it was subsequently blocked and a window inserted instead. One writer has speculated that this might have been a leper niche and window. There are two other modern windows in the north wall, and all three are at different heights. There is a bellcote at the west <b>end,</b> <b>housing</b> a bell (probably from the 18th century). The roof has been described as being [...] "clearly one of the earliest on the island".|$|E
