There has been much research exploring the intergenerational transmission of violence: children of men who are violent {{are more likely to be}} violent themselves. Previous research has explored risk factors, but few have explored factors that protect those who have been exposed to intimate partner violence from perpetrating in their future relationships. The current study explored <b>functional</b> social <b>support</b> and quality of adult romantic attachment as two possible protective factors. Findings revealed that intimate partner violence was predictive of future perpetration. Adult romantic attachment quality and <b>functional</b> social <b>support</b> did not significantly moderate the relationship between exposure and perpetration. Analysis of effect sizes indicated that adult romantic attachment quality had a larger impact on perpetration than past <b>functional</b> social <b>support.</b> Likewise, past <b>functional</b> social <b>support</b> had a larger impact on perpetration than current <b>functional</b> social <b>support</b> did.

5000|$|Furthermore, {{social support}} can be {{measured}} in terms of structural support or <b>functional</b> <b>support.</b> Structural support (also called social integration) refers {{to the extent to which}} a recipient is connected within a social network, like the number of social ties or how integrated a person is within his or her social network.

40|$|Objective. This work {{sought to}} {{determine}} <b>functional</b> social <b>support</b> in family caregivers of severely dependent elderly adults and its relationship with sociodemographic characteristics. Methods. This was a cross-sectional study. The Duke-UNC- 11 <b>Functional</b> Social <b>Support</b> questionnaire was applied to 67 family caregivers from Family Healthcare Centers in Valdivia (Chile) in 2012. Results. Family caregivers perceived low levels of affective social support (49. 3 %) and of trust (98. 5 %); considering insufficient the information and advice they receive related, principally, to the scarce {{number of people who}} help, they need to establish communication to share their feelings and problems derived from the task of caring. These caregivers recognize the support from community healthcare centers. <b>Functional</b> social <b>support</b> is correlated to the following variables: number of {{people who live in the}} home, years of study, age of the caregiver, and number of people who help; with this last variable predicting the level of social support in its two dimensions. Conclusion. Family caregivers of severely dependent elderly adults perceive a level of <b>functional</b> social <b>support,</b> especially in the dimension of trust. Community nurses must increase the number of home visits, evaluate the needs for social support perceived in caregivers, and teach coping strategies to mitigate problems that emerge in this work...|$|R

5000|$|A {{functional}} brigade —or <b>functional</b> <b>support</b> brigade— is a brigade {{specialized in}} combat support or {{combat service support}} for a particular military role. The primary purpose of a functional brigade is to plug into operational formations at the theater level or those commanded by corps or division commanders performing as the Army Service Component Command (ASCC) once deployed, and to conduct operational or theater level tasks or support. Functional brigades, like modular support brigades, have a modular subordinate structure that may vary considerably among brigades of the same type. Unlike the modular support brigades, functional brigades typically operate under theater control and depend on theater-level elements for signal and other support. The theater force may task-organize them to corps or division headquarters. Types of functional brigades include: ...|$|E
50|$|Positive {{affect and}} {{negative}} affect (PANAS) represent independent domains of emotion {{in the general}} population, and positive affect is strongly linked to social interaction. Positive and negative daily events show independent relationships to subjective well-being, and positive affect is strongly linked to social activity. Recent research suggests that high <b>functional</b> <b>support</b> is related {{to higher levels of}} positive affect. In his work on negative affect arousal and white noise, Seidner found support for the existence of a negative affect arousal mechanism regarding the devaluation of speakers from other ethnic origins. The exact process through which social support is linked to positive affect remains unclear. The process could derive from predictable, regularized social interaction, from leisure activities where the focus is on relaxation and positive mood, or from the enjoyment of shared activities. The techniques used to shift a negative mood to a positive one are called mood repair strategies.|$|E
