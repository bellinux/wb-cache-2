5000|$|In 2006, Applied Biosystems {{acquired}} the Research Products Division of Ambion, a supplier of RNA-based reagents and products. That year, with the <b>Influenza</b> <b>A</b> Subtype <b>H5N1</b> [...] "avian flu" [...] strain scare, the company launched a global initiative {{to identify and}} track such infectious diseases.|$|R
50|$|H5N1 {{clinical}} trials are {{clinical trials}} concerning H5N1 vaccines, which {{are intended to}} provide immunization to <b>influenza</b> <b>A</b> virus subtype <b>H5N1.</b> They are intended to discover pharmacological effects and identify any adverse reactions the vaccines may achieve in humans.|$|R
50|$|Dhori virus (DHOV) is {{a species}} of the genus Thogotovirus {{and a member of}} the family Orthomyxoviridae. Its hosts are ticks, mosquitoes, and mammals (including humans). Dhori virus is lethal to mice, causing {{systemic}} pathologic changes similar to those reported in humans with virulent <b>influenza</b> <b>A</b> (<b>H5N1)</b> virus infection.|$|E

"Since 1997, {{studies of}} <b>influenza</b> <b>A</b> (<b>H5N1)</b> {{indicate}} that these viruses continue to evolve, {{with changes in}} antigenicity and internal gene constellations; an expanded host range in avian species {{and the ability to}} infect felids; enhanced pathogenicity in experimentally infected mice and ferrets, in which they cause systemic infections; and increased environmental stability." ...|$|E
5000|$|As of February 2008, the [...] "median age of {{patients}} with <b>influenza</b> <b>A</b> (<b>H5N1)</b> virus infection is approximately 18 years ... The overall case fatality proportion is 61% ... Handling of sick or dead poultry during {{the week before the}} onset of illness is the most commonly recognized risk factor ... The primary pathologic process that causes death is fulminant viral pneumonia." ...|$|E
25|$|<b>H5N1</b> is <b>a</b> subtype of {{the species}} <b>Influenza</b> <b>A</b> virus of the Influenzavirus A genus of the Orthomyxoviridae family. Like all other <b>influenza</b> <b>A</b> subtypes, the <b>H5N1</b> subtype is <b>an</b> RNA virus. It has a {{segmented}} genome of eight negative sense, single-strands of RNA, abbreviated as PB2, PB1, PA, HA, NP, NA, MP and NS.|$|R
50|$|The pseudoknot {{structure}} {{is very similar}} in influenzavirus A and influenzavirus B. A unique point mutation occurring in the strains of <b>influenza</b> <b>A</b> virus subtype <b>H5N1</b> after 2001 has been suggested to result in RNA conformational shift, favouring an alternative hairpin structure instead of the pseudoknot.|$|R
5000|$|The highly {{pathogenic}} <b>influenza</b> <b>A</b> virus subtype <b>H5N1</b> is <b>an</b> emerging avian <b>influenza</b> {{virus that}} is causing global concern {{as a potential}} pandemic threat. It {{is often referred to}} simply as [...] "bird flu" [...] or [...] "avian influenza", even though it {{is only one of many}} subtypes.|$|R
5000|$|The human {{incubation}} period of avian <b>influenza</b> <b>A</b> (<b>H5N1)</b> is 2 to 17 days. Once infected, the virus can spread by cell-to-cell contact, bypassing receptors. So {{even if a}} strain {{is very hard to}} initially catch, once infected, it spreads rapidly within a body. For highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza in a human, [...] "the time from the onset to presentation (median, 4 days) or to death (median, 9 to 10 days) has remained unchanged from 2003 through 2006." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{number of}} cases {{detected}} after April fell abruptly. The {{decrease in the number}} of new human H7N9 cases may have resulted from containment measures taken by Chinese authorities, including closing live bird markets, or from a change in seasons, or a possibly a combination of both factors. Studies indicate that avian influenza viruses have a seasonal pattern, much like human seasonal influenza viruses. If this is the case, H7N9 infections - in birds and people - may pick up again when the weather turns cooler in China. Limited person-to-person spread of bird flu is thought to have occurred rarely in the past, most notably with avian <b>influenza</b> <b>A</b> (<b>H5N1).</b> According to the US CDC, based on previous experience, some limited human-to-human spread of this H7N9 virus would not be surprising if the virus reemerges in the fall. Furthermore, according to the WHO, since migratory birds were first implicated in H7N9 transmission, the possibility that the virus may spread into other regions or countries with colder weather cannot be excluded, given the widespread bird migratory patterns.|$|E
50|$|Single-domain {{antibodies}} {{have been}} tested as a new therapeutic tool against multiple targets. In mice infected with <b>influenza</b> <b>A</b> virus subtype <b>H5N1,</b> Nanobodies directed against hemaglutinin suppressed replication of the H5N1 virus in vivo and reduced morbidity and mortality. Nanobodies targeting the cell receptor binding domain of the virulence factors toxin A and toxin B of Clostridium difficile were shown to neutralize cytopathic effects in fibroblasts in vitro.|$|R
50|$|Research {{suggests}} that VLP vaccines against influenza virus could provide stronger and longer-lasting protection against flu viruses than conventional vaccines. Production can begin {{as soon as}} the virus strain is sequenced and can take as little as 12 weeks, compared to 9 months for traditional vaccines. In early clinical trials, VLP vaccines for influenza appeared to provide complete protection against both the <b>Influenza</b> <b>A</b> virus subtype <b>H5N1</b> and the 1918 flu pandemic. Novavax and Medicago Inc. have run clinical trials of their VLP flu vaccines.|$|R
5000|$|... "Human disease {{associated}} with <b>influenza</b> <b>A</b> subtype <b>H5N1</b> re-emerged in January 2003, {{for the first}} time since an outbreak in Hong Kong in 1997." [...] Three people in one family were infected after visiting Fujian province in mainland China and 2 died. By midyear of 2003 outbreaks of poultry disease caused by H5N1 occurred in Asia, but were not recognized as such. That December animals in a Thai zoo died after eating infected chicken carcasses. Later that month H5N1 infection was detected in 3 flocks in the Republic of Korea. H5N1 in China in this and later periods is less than fully reported. Blogs have described many discrepancies between official China government announcements concerning H5N1 and what people in China see with their own eyes. Many reports of total H5N1 cases exclude China due to widespread disbelief in China's official numbers.|$|R
5000|$|The New England Journal of Medicine {{reported}} on March 30, 2006 {{on one of}} dozens of vaccine studies currently being conducted. The Treanor et al. study was on vaccine produced from the human isolate (A/Vietnam/1203/2004 H5N1) of a virulent clade 1 <b>influenza</b> <b>A</b> (<b>H5N1)</b> virus {{with the use of a}} plasmid rescue system, with only the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes expressed and administered without adjuvant. [...] "The rest of the genes were derived from an avirulent egg-adapted influenza A/PR/8/34 strain. The hemagglutinin gene was further modified to replace six basic amino acids associated with high pathogenicity in birds at the cleavage site between hemagglutinin 1 and hemagglutinin 2. Immunogenicity was assessed by microneutralization and hemagglutination-inhibition assays with the use of the vaccine virus, although a subgroup of samples were tested with the use of the wild-type influenza A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1) virus." [...] The results of this study combined with others scheduled to be completed by spring 2007 is hoped will provide a highly immunogenic vaccine that is cross-protective against heterologous influenza strains.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Influenza</b> <b>A</b> virus subtype <b>H5N1,</b> {{also known}} as A(H5N1) or simply <b>H5N1,</b> is <b>a</b> subtype of the <b>influenza</b> <b>A</b> virus which can cause illness in humans and many other animal species. A bird-adapted strain of H5N1, called HPAI A(H5N1) for highly {{pathogenic}} avian influenza virus of type <b>A</b> of subtype <b>H5N1,</b> is the highly pathogenic causative agent of H5N1 flu, commonly known as avian influenza ("bird flu"). It is enzootic (maintained in the population) in many bird populations, especially in Southeast Asia. One strain of HPAI A(H5N1) is spreading globally after first appearing in Asia. It is epizootic (an epidemic in nonhumans) and panzootic (affecting animals of many species, especially over a wide area), killing {{tens of millions of}} birds and spurring the culling of hundreds of millions of others to stem its spread. Many references to [...] "bird flu" [...] and H5N1 in the popular media refer to this strain.|$|R
50|$|In early 2009, {{samples of}} viral {{material}} supplied by Baxter International {{to a series}} of European laboratories were found to be contaminated with live Avian flu virus (<b>Influenza</b> <b>A</b> virus subtype <b>H5N1).</b> Samples of the less harmful seasonal flu virus (subtype H3N2) were found to be mixed with the deadly <b>H5N1</b> strain after <b>a</b> vaccine made from the material killed test animals in a lab in the Czech Republic. Though the serious consequences were avoided by the lab in the Czech Republic, Baxter then claimed the failed controls over the distribution of the virus were 'stringent' and there was 'little chance' of the lethal virus harming humans.|$|R

50|$|<b>H5N1</b> is <b>an</b> <b>Influenza</b> <b>A</b> virus subtype. Experts {{believe it}} might mutate {{into a form}} that transmits easily from person to person. If such a {{mutation}} occurs, it might remain <b>an</b> <b>H5N1</b> subtype or could shift subtypes as did H2N2 when it evolved into the Hong Kong Flu strain of H3N2.|$|R
50|$|The World Health Organization {{was founded}} in 1948 as a United Nations agency to improve global health. In most of the world, life {{expectancy}} has improved since then, and was about 67 years as of 2010, and well above 80 years in some countries. Eradication of infectious diseases is an international effort, and several new vaccines have been developed during the post-war years, against infections such as measles, mumps, several strains of influenza and human papilloma virus. The long-known vaccine against Smallpox finally eradicated the disease in the 1970s, and Rinderpest was wiped out in 2011. Eradication of polio is underway. Tissue culture is important for development of vaccines. Though the early success of antiviral vaccines and antibacterial drugs, antiviral drugs were not introduced until the 1970s. Through the WHO, {{the international community has}} developed a response protocol against epidemics, displayed during the SARS epidemic in 2003, the <b>Influenza</b> <b>A</b> virus subtype <b>H5N1</b> from 2004, the Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa and onwards.|$|R
25|$|<b>Influenza</b> <b>A</b> virus subtype H3N2 is endemic in pigs in China, and {{has been}} {{detected}} in pigs in Vietnam, increasing fears {{of the emergence of}} new variant strains. The dominant strain of annual flu virus in January 2006 was H3N2, which is now resistant to the standard antiviral drugs amantadine and rimantadine. The possibility of H5N1 and H3N2 exchanging genes through reassortment is a major concern. If <b>a</b> reassortment in <b>H5N1</b> occurs, it might remain <b>an</b> <b>H5N1</b> subtype, or it could shift subtypes, as H2N2 did when it evolved into the Hong Kong Flu strain of H3N2.|$|R
5000|$|Among {{the more}} {{attractive}} alternatives available for reducing mortality is vaccine stockpiling and prepandemic vaccination. [...] "Human H5N1 vaccines are currently available and can induce heterotypic immunity. WHO and governments should give urgent consideration {{to the use}} of these vaccines for the priming of individuals or communities who would be at greatest risk of infection if <b>an</b> <b>H5N1</b> <b>influenza</b> pandemic were to emerge." [...] Death associated with <b>influenza</b> <b>A</b> viruses [...] "is usually mediated by superinfection with bacteria, mainly Streptococcus pneumoniae.", suggesting that lethality may be reduced by vaccination against pneumonia.|$|R

50|$|The current avian flu, in humans, is fatal in over 50% of {{confirmed}} cases. Yet early projections {{like those}} above {{have assumed that}} such a lethal avian strain would surely lose genes contributing to its lethality in humans as it made the adaptations necessary for ready transmission in the human population. This optimistic assumption cannot be relied on. As the WHO reported in November 2006, initial outbreaks of <b>an</b> <b>H5N1</b> pandemic could rival the current lethality of over 50%. Further information necessary to make an accurate projection of initial lethality of <b>an</b> <b>H5N1</b> pandemic does not exist, as no data was collected that could show the pre-pandemic virulence in any potential flu strain until after the last pandemic of the 20th Century. There is no basis for assuming that <b>an</b> <b>H5N1</b> pandemic will emerge with only the far lower 1-2% lethality rate of the Spanish Flu, once {{assumed to be a}} worst-case scenario. There exists no reliable prediction of the mortality rate of <b>an</b> <b>H5N1</b> pandemic, and it would be irresponsible to confine planning to only optimistic assumptions {{out of step with the}} currently observed case fatality ratio.|$|R
25|$|In general, {{humans who}} catch <b>a</b> humanized <b>influenza</b> <b>A</b> virus (a human flu virus of type A) usually have {{symptoms}} that include fever, cough, sore throat, muscle aches, conjunctivitis, and, in severe cases, breathing problems and pneumonia {{that may be}} fatal. The severity of the infection depends {{in large part on}} the state of the infected persons' immune systems and whether they had been exposed to the strain before (in which case they would be partially immune). No one knows if these or other symptoms will be the symptoms of <b>a</b> humanized <b>H5N1</b> flu.|$|R
50|$|In January 2006, Doğubayazıt was {{the centre}} of <b>a</b> <b>H5N1</b> bird flu outbreak. Several {{children}} died from the disease after playing with chicken carcasses.|$|R
5000|$|Unfortunately, <b>a</b> human <b>H5N1</b> {{pandemic}} might {{emerge with}} initial lethality resembling that over-50% case fatality now observed in pre-pandemic H5N1 human cases, {{rather than with}} the still-high 1-2% seen with the Spanish Flu or with the lower rates seen in the two more recent <b>influenza</b> pandemics. <b>As</b> a WHO working group noted, ...|$|R
25|$|Highly {{pathogenic}} <b>H5N1</b> avian <b>influenza</b> in <b>a</b> {{human is}} far worse, killing 50% of humans who catch it. In one case, <b>a</b> boy with <b>H5N1</b> experienced diarrhea followed rapidly by a coma without developing respiratory or flu-like symptoms.|$|R
