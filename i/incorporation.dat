5|$|Arlington was {{incorporated}} as a fourth-class city on May 20, 1903, including {{the remnants of}} Haller City (located north of modern-day Division Street). The <b>incorporation</b> came after a referendum on May 5, in which 134 of 173 voters approved the city's <b>incorporation.</b> The new city elected shingle mill owner John M. Smith as its first mayor. In the years following <b>incorporation,</b> Arlington gained a local bank, a cooperative creamery, a city park, a library, electricity, and telephone service.|$|E

5|$|There is also {{a debate}} in the {{linguistic}} literature whether Greenlandic has noun <b>incorporation.</b> This is because Greenlandic does not allow the kind of <b>incorporation</b> common in many languages in which a noun root {{can be incorporated into}} almost any verb to form a verb with a new meaning. On the other hand, Greenlandic does often form verbs that include noun roots. The question then becomes whether to analyse these verb formations as <b>incorporation</b> or as denominal derivation of verbs. Greenlandic has a number of morphemes that require a noun root as their host and which form complex predicates that correspond closely in meaning to what is often seen in languages that have canonical noun <b>incorporation.</b> Linguists who propose that Greenlandic does have <b>incorporation</b> argue that these morphemes are in fact verbal roots that must obligatorily incorporate nouns to form grammatical clauses. This argument is supported by {{the fact that many of}} the derivational morphemes that form denominal verbs work almost identically to canonical noun <b>incorporation.</b> They allow the formation of words with a semantic content corresponding to an entire English clause with verb, subject and object. Another argument is that the morphemes used to derive denominal verbs come from historical noun incorporating constructions that have become fossilized. Other linguists maintain that the morphemes in question are simply derivational morphemes that allow the formation of denominal verbs. This argument is supported by the fact that the morphemes cannot occur without being latched on to a nominal element. The examples below illustrate how Greenlandic forms complex predicates including nominal roots.|$|E

5|$|Apart {{from the}} {{establishment}} of the boards of commissioners in Hanley and Burslem, no further changes occurred until the 1830s when passing of the Reform Act 1832 (2 & 3 Will. IV. c.45) sparked renewed interest in <b>incorporation.</b> The act created the parliamentary borough of Stoke-upon-Trent, which would elect two members to Parliament. Together with Stoke-upon-Trent itself, the parliamentary borough also comprised Hanley, Shelton, Lane End, Fenton, Burslem, Tunstall, Rushton Grange, and the hamlet of Sneyd. The significance of the act was {{that for the first time}} and for one important reason only, through the election of Members of Parliament, the townships of the Potteries effectively became one. Shortly after the Reform Act came into effect, a Municipal Corporations Bill was introduced which proposed that the new parliamentary boroughs should be granted charters of <b>incorporation.</b> The bill failed with the prorogation of that Parliament, while the Potteries were excluded from the reforms of the later Municipal Corporations Act 1835 (5 & 6 Wm. IV. c.76). Interest in <b>incorporation</b> was sufficient for several meetings on the subject to take place; the Staffordshire Advertiser reported after one meeting in Burslem that <b>incorporation</b> would lead to one town having undue influence over the others, a theme that was to recur for many years. The same meeting revisited a topic raised pre–1820, the promotion of law and order in the Potteries, and called for the appointment of a stipendiary magistrate.|$|E
