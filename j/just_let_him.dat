500|$|Triggered by {{the death}} of Krusty's father, Lisa becomes obsessed with {{protecting}} her own father, [...] Homer, from getting hurt. She wraps him in bubble wrap, which ends up saving his life when Otto's school bus plows into the garden. Eventually Marge and Bart talk some sense into Lisa, that while it is nice of her to be concerned for her father, she should not force Homer to take it easy on himself and <b>just</b> <b>let</b> <b>him</b> live his life.|$|E
500|$|It was Jones who {{ultimately}} played {{most of the}} bass parts during the Bollocks recordings; Howard calls his rudimentary, rumbling approach the [...] "explosive missing ingredient" [...] of the Sex Pistols' sound. Vicious's bass is reportedly present on one track that appeared on the original album release, [...] "Bodies". Jones recalls, [...] "He played his farty old bass part and we <b>just</b> <b>let</b> <b>him</b> do it. When he left I dubbed another part on, leaving Sid's down low. I {{think it might be}} barely audible on the track." [...] Following [...] "God Save the Queen", two more singles were released: [...] "Pretty Vacant" [...] (largely written by Matlock) on 1 July and from the Bollocks sessions, [...] "Holidays in the Sun" [...] on 14 October. Each was a Top Ten hit.|$|E
500|$|As {{the lines}} between comedy show and news show have blurred, Jon Stewart has come under {{pressure}} in some circles to engage in more serious journalism. Tucker Carlson and Daily Show co-creator Lizz Winstead have chastised Stewart for criticizing politicians and newspeople in his solo segments and then, in interviews with the same people, rarely taking them to task face-to-face. In 2004, Winstead expressed a desire for Stewart to ask harder satirical questions, saying, [...] "When you are interviewing a Richard Perle or a Kissinger, {{if you give them}} a pass, then you become what you are satirizing. You have a war criminal sitting on your couch—to <b>just</b> <b>let</b> <b>him</b> be a war criminal sitting on your couch means you are having to respect some kind of boundary." [...] She has argued that The Daily Show success and access to the youth vote should allow Stewart to press political guests harder without fearing that they will not return to the show. In 2010, Winstead had changed her views, commenting that since 2004, Stewart did some of the hardest-hitting interviews on TV. Stewart said in 2003 that he does not think of himself as a social or media critic and rejects the idea that he has any journalistic role as an interviewer.|$|E

[...] Never in her life had she known anything so high and fine as this, <b>just</b> <b>letting</b> <b>him</b> have it and bravely and magnificently leaving it. Didn't the place, the associations and circumstances, perfectly make it sound what it wasn't? and wasn't that exactly the beauty? ...|$|R
5000|$|In [...] "Casino Night," [...] Toby {{tries to}} {{convince}} Michael not to invite Boy Scouts {{to a company}} Casino Night. Michael's response is to demean {{him in front of}} everybody. Toby <b>just</b> <b>lets</b> <b>him</b> finish. That night, however, Toby viciously beats Michael at no-limit Texas Hold 'Em, to Michael's visible irritation. Later, Toby says to the camera, [...] "I'm not gonna lie—it felt good to take money from Michael. I'm gonna chase that feeling." ...|$|R
500|$|Executive {{producer}} Jeff Pinkner {{decided he}} wanted fellow executive producer David H. Goodman and supervising producer J. R. Orci to collaborate in writing the episode; Goodman wrote the first half, while Orci wrote {{the rest of the}} episode. The two later worked together on only one other episode, [...] "The Equation". Frederick E. O. Toye directed the episode, as he had worked previously with the writers on Alias. The writers had the idea {{for a couple of weeks}} of Olivia walking into an apartment and discovering walls covered with drawings of events that [...] "no man could possibly have known about". They wanted to take [...] "urban myths or legends of strange events" [...] and come up with a fringe science equivalent; this led them to creating the story of Roy, a man with seemingly [...] "psychic" [...] abilities, which they then expanded by offering a real scientific explanation in the form of Walter's past research. In the show's early development, the producers were also unsure about how other aspects should be developed, such as Joshua Jackson's character Peter. For instance, in [...] "The Ghost Network", they debated whether or not Peter would break into his childhood home before finally [...] "stalling and <b>just</b> <b>let</b> <b>him</b> do it"; Orci came up with Peter's explanation to Olivia, that he used to live there so it wasn't really breaking in.|$|E
2500|$|The {{instrumental}} backing {{was effectively}} recorded {{live in the}} studio, while Van Vliet overdubbed most of the vocals in only partial sync with the music by hearing the slight sound leakage through the studio window. Zappa said of Van Vliet's approach, [...] " [...] impossible to tell him why things should be such and such a way. It {{seemed to me that}} {{if he was going to}} create a unique object, that the best thing for me to do was to keep my mouth shut as much as possible and <b>just</b> <b>let</b> <b>him</b> do whatever he wanted to do whether I thought it was wrong or not." ...|$|E
2500|$|Along {{with his}} sister, Andrew notices Bree's {{increasing}} alcohol consumption, and uses it against her. When Bree refuses to let Andrew access his trust fund {{to buy a}} car, he calls her a [...] "mean old drunk", and she slaps him. Andrew emotionally blackmails Justin into punching him {{in the same place}} Bree slapped him. He then hires a lawyer to file for emancipation from his mother, whom he accuses of hitting him while drunk. Andrew tries to persuade her in [...] "There Is No Other Way" [...] to <b>just</b> <b>let</b> <b>him</b> go, but she refuses saying she hasn't [...] "set him right" [...] yet. Andrew, after consultation with his lawyer, tells Bree in [...] "Could I Leave You?" [...] that he will accuse her of molesting him if he does not get his way.|$|E
6000|$|Ellen {{chose to}} protest, or thought {{it fair to}} do so. [...] "I don't believe she is doing him any harm. She <b>just</b> <b>lets</b> <b>him</b> talk out, and {{everybody}} else checks him up so. It was nice of her to come and talk with me, when we had all been keeping away from her. Perhaps he sent her, though. She says {{they have always been}} such good friends because she wouldn't be anything else from the beginning." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Say, {{but it just}} is. Kind of breathless, though. He ain't {{very well}} known around the State, and he was bound to run--and I <b>just</b> couldn't <b>let</b> <b>him</b> come out without any clothes on." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am Stewart's wife," [...] she {{answered}} {{him and she}} looked at him, not conscious of any motive to persuade or allure, but <b>just</b> to <b>let</b> <b>him</b> know the greatness of her dependence upon him.|$|R
2500|$|The fifth Republican {{debate was}} held at Florida State Fair Grounds in Tampa, Florida, {{sponsored}} by CNN and Tea Party Express. It was moderated by Wolf Blitzer, and was notable for being the first Tea Party debate in history. Rick Perry was booed by the audience for defending his use of an executive order to mandate young girls have the HPV vaccine, which he defended by saying, [...] "I will always {{err on the side}} of life". The debate also engendered controversy when Blitzer asked Ron Paul a hypothetical question about a young man who could afford health insurance but refused to purchase any and went into a coma. When Blitzer asked Paul [...] "Congressman, are you saying that society should <b>just</b> <b>let</b> <b>him</b> die?", a few audience members shouted [...] "Yeah!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune {{referred}} to Tré Cool as [...] "Green Day's most potent weapon", adding that [...] "His monstrous kick-drum wallop evokes John Bonham, while his manic fills make him punk's answer to Keith Moon." [...] His stage persona {{has also been}} compared to Moon. Sound engineer Neill King, who worked with Green Day on Dookie, noted that Tré Cool shares Moon's [...] "wild animal approach" [...] to playing drums, and explained that the band encountered difficulties while recording [...] "Basket Case" [...] due to his unpredictable style: [...] "It's not that Tré wasn’t a good drummer, {{but in terms of}} his performances we wanted the best of the best...So, although we wanted him to do all of his wild fills and crazy drumming, we couldn’t <b>just</b> <b>let</b> <b>him</b> go. He’d drift in and out of time, which is terrific live, but which was unacceptable on radio at that time." ...|$|E
2500|$|What ensued {{was one of}} {{the most}} vitriolic {{corporate}} battles of the 1980s, with Perot and Smith publicly exchanging barbs using the media, which delightedly splashed the story over every business publication in the U.S.. Perot notoriously lashed out at Smith in a 1988 exclusive to Fortune Magazine, saying: [...] "My question is: Why haven't we unleashed their potential? The answer is: the General Motors system. It's like a blanket of fog that keeps these people from doing what they know needs to be done. I come from an environment where, if you see a snake, you kill it. At GM, if you see a snake, the first thing you do is go hire a consultant on snakes. Then you get a committee on snakes, and then you discuss it for a couple of years. The most likely course of action is—nothing. You figure, the snake hasn't bitten anybody yet, so you <b>just</b> <b>let</b> <b>him</b> crawl around on the factory floor. We need to build an environment where the first guy who sees the snake kills it." [...] Perot went on to needle Smith regarding the opulent 25th floor GM offices in New York, [...] "An entire teak forest must have been decimated for that floor". Smith, who had obviously ignored the irony of the CEO of the largest public corporation in the world complaining about the opulence of the private office (which Perot had personally paid to furnish) of a rival, had responded to Perot's frequent criticism of GM's executive perks a year earlier, [...] "Perot's office (in Dallas) 'makes mine look like a shanty-town. He has Remingtons; he has a Gilbert Stuart painting hanging on the wall. Nobody runs around saying 'Get rid of Ross's office'".|$|E

5000|$|David Jeffries of Allmusic wrote, [...] "Musically, {{the results}} are a brighter, tighter, yet more {{elaborate}} version of the man's best work, with tracks like [...] "Security" [...] and [...] "Merry Go Round" [...] sounding both flashy and meaty at once." [...] Evan Rytlewski of The A.V. Club gave the album a [...] "B" [...] rating, writing [...] "disorganized as it is, this is the environment he works best in, and Success smartly <b>just</b> <b>lets</b> <b>him</b> do his thing". Meka Udoh of XXL gave the album an [...] "XL" [...] review, writing [...] "maybe influenced by Marshall himself, Royce has learned to channel his loquacious voracity into a controlled rage, and {{the end result is}} perhaps his most complete body of work".|$|R
6000|$|DORA. Then I'm afraid youll have to {{send him}} out of the world, old dear. I'm sorry for you: I really am, though you mightnt believe it; and I think your {{feelings}} do you real credit.

"That will tickle him immensely; and if you'd <b>just</b> <b>let</b> <b>him</b> put brown tops {{to my old}} boots, {{and stick}} a cockade in his hat when he sits up behind the phaeton, he'd be a happy fellow," [...] laughed Thorny, who had {{discovered}} that one of Ben's ambitions {{was to be a}} tip-top groom.|$|E
50|$|In the 1980s G.I. Joe cartoon series, Destro was {{voiced by}} Arthur Burghardt. In the Sunbow {{produced}} series, Destro is portrayed much differently, {{as he and}} Cobra Commander have a more contemptuous relationship. Destro {{is not afraid to}} say what is on his mind and even physically assaults him in some cases. Cobra Commander usually <b>just</b> <b>lets</b> <b>him</b> get away with it because he {{is the only one who}} would know how to operate the doomsday devices he makes. Destro is the creator of such technological super weapons as the Weather Dominator. He has also created some organic implements of destruction such as the Creeper Vine, as seen in The Revenge of Cobra miniseries. Furthermore, while Cobra Commander was generally portrayed as a bungler, Destro was both a more serious and more competent villain.|$|R
5000|$|The Gothic prince Atharid sentenced Sabbas to death, {{ordering}} him to {{be thrown}} in the river Musæus, {{a tributary of the}} Danube. As he went with the soldiers he praised God the whole way, denouncing the pagan and idolatrous ways of his captors. The soldiers, considering him a fool or insane, contemplated <b>just</b> <b>letting</b> <b>him</b> go, reasoning that the prince would never find out. Sabbas urged them to do their duty, proclaiming [...] "Why do you waste time talking nonsense and not do what you were told to? For I see what you cannot see: over there on the other side, standing in glory, the saints who have come to receive me". At this the soldiers pushed him under the river with a branch against his neck and drowned him.|$|R
5000|$|... "When I had his arm {{behind his}} back, I {{could feel it}} popping, I thought, 'Well, this guy's pride <b>just</b> won't <b>let</b> <b>him</b> tap, will it?' So without hesitation, I broke it. I heard it break, and I thought, 'Ah, there, I just broke it.' I was stopped afterward, but even if I hadn't been, {{continuing}} to break it more would have been fine by me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, but my lord {{will find}} that he can't be extravagant with me. <b>Just</b> <b>let</b> <b>him</b> {{be sent to the}} calaboose a few times, and {{thoroughly}} dressed down!

6000|$|... "He's a plumb buzzard," [...] said Buck. [...] "He won't work, and he's the low- downest passel of inhumanity I ever see. I didn't {{know what}} you wanted done with him, Ranse, so I <b>just</b> <b>let</b> <b>him</b> set. That seems to suit him. He's been {{condemned}} to death by the boys a dozen times, but I told 'em maybe you was savin' him for the torture." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then she can't get any education. Old Gould is a {{sensible}} man, who says any school {{he could afford}} would only turn her out a sham, and he means, when Mary and Kate are a little older, to {{get some sort of}} governess for the three.

6000|$|His uplifted hand descended, and {{thereafter}} {{rose and fell}} in a swift and steady rhythm. The cub struggled and cursed and squirmed, but did not offer to bite.
