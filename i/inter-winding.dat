Power transformers failure may lead to high scale system’s operations disruption and heavy economic losses, that’s why the lever of requirements for power transformer protections is so high. Differential protection is usually used as a main protection against internal faults such as <b>inter-windings</b> faults, inter-coil faults or coil-core faults. For safe protection against incomplete winding faults protection device must be capable to detect differential current from such a very low value from nominal. The idea for a new device is to use information extracted from inrush current thru Fourier transformation to perform an early detection of faults usually hardly detectable due to very low impact on transformer’s primary current in steady condition.

5000|$|An Austin {{transformer}} is {{a special}} type of an Isolation transformer used for feeding the air-traffic obstacle lamps and other devices on a mast radiator antenna insulated from ground. As the electrical potential difference between the antenna and ground is high (up to 300 kV), feeding the lamps directly is impossible. The transformer consists of two ring-like windings with a large air space between the winding and the magnetic core. The large spacing provides both isolation from high voltage and low <b>inter-winding</b> coupling capacitance.|$|E
40|$|M. Ing. (Electrical & Electronic Engineering Science) This study {{investigates the}} {{mitigation}} of conducted electromagnetic interference (EMI) in a flyback DC-DC converter. Without {{the use of}} filters, the maximum mitigation of EMI possible without significantly decreasing converter operating efficiency is investigated. The following parameters are found to influence EMI: · Switching speed: Decreasing switching speed (increasing rise and fall times of the MOSFET) effectively reduces both common mode (CM) and differential mode (DM) EMI above a certain frequency. Series gate resistors {{up to a certain}} value were found to not increase power dissipated in the MOSFET. Series gate resistors greater than this value, further reduce CM and DM EMI at the cost of larger amounts of power being dissipated in the MOSFET. · Leakage inductance and <b>inter-winding</b> capacitance: The dominant component of the flyback coupled inductor in terms of EMI generation is the <b>inter-winding</b> capacitance. Increasing <b>inter-winding</b> capacitance increases both CM and DM EMI. Reducing <b>inter-winding</b> capacitance increases leakage inductance. Increasing leakage inductance however, results in reduced converter efficiency. Coupled inductor design is therefore a compromise between leakage inductance and <b>inter-winding</b> capacitance. · Layout inductance: Reducing layout inductance in certain parts of the circuit is an effective method for reducing DM EMI. This is shown to also decrease CM EMI but not to the same extent as DM EMI. · Snubbing: Snubbing is shown to effectively reduce both CM and DM EMI by reducing the magnitude of the voltage overshoot and ringing on the drain of the MOSFET. Snubbing however reduces converter efficiency. This study gives important guidelines to the engineering trade-offs in reducing EMI versus efficiency in a flyback converter...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{methodology}} to interpret frequency response measurements of a deformed transformer winding due to conductors tilt. To achieve that, geometrical parameters of a three phase prototype transformer {{is used to}} simulate the frequency response {{of one of the}} windings using the multi-conductor transmission line model. To simulate the response, inter-turn, inter-disc and <b>inter-winding</b> capacitances of the winding based on normal and deformed conditions are computed using finite element method. Using the computed values, the frequency response for both normal and deformed conditions are simulated. The simulated responses are studied by subdividing into four frequency regions and compared using the correlation coefficient. For further analysis, the vector fitting algorithm was implemented to approximate the transfer function of each response. All transfer functions are then represented in the Nyquist diagram to analyse the shape of each plot. From the Nyquist diagram, it was observed that the real minimum of each plot increases as the winding deformation increases. This finding can be used to estimate the winding deformation severity based on the plotted attributes. No Full Tex...|$|E

The main benefits of using this developed PCB embedding process are the capability to customize the air-gap for the flyback transformer and volume reduction for the converter. The easy modulation of the air-gap distance can be achieved using PCB material in specfic thickness. Moreover, the design of a coplanar-winding transformer structure with very low <b>inter-winding</b> capacitance needs a large winding area and raises the interest for the PCB integration approach.
