5|$|The diet of the Arctic tern varies {{depending}} on location and time, but is usually carnivorous. In most cases, it eats small fish or marine crustaceans. Fish species comprise {{the most important part}} of the diet, and account <b>for</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> biomass consumed than any other food. Prey species are immature (1–2-year old) shoaling species such as herring, cod, sandlances, and capelin. Among the marine crustaceans eaten are amphipods, crabs and krill. Sometimes, these birds also eat molluscs, marine worms, or berries, and on their northern breeding grounds, insects.|$|E
5|$|The {{prognosis}} {{is good for}} stable lesions (stageI and II) in juveniles with open growth plates; treated conservatively—typically without surgery—50% of cases will heal. Recovery in juveniles {{can be attributed to}} the bone's ability to repair damaged or dead bone tissue and cartilage in a process called bone remodeling. Open growth plates are characterized by increased numbers of undifferentiated chondrocytes (stem cells) which are precursors to both bone and cartilaginous tissue. As a result, open growth plates allow <b>for</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stem cells necessary for repair in the affected joint. Unstable, large, full-thickness lesions (stageIII and IV) or lesions of any stage found in the skeletally mature are more likely to fail non-operative treatment. These lesions offer a worse prognosis and surgery is required in most cases.|$|E
25|$|The Tamamushi Shrine is {{a common}} example of {{painting}} that derived from Baekje and provides important evidence for the Korean peninsula's and the Chinese mainland's strong cultural transfer to the Japanese islands. The shrine is named for the many wings of the tamamushi beetle that once adorned it but have since deteriorated. The paintings that cover building and dais are of Jataka tales, bodhisattvas, the Four Heavenly Kings, and other buddhist iconography. The front panels of the building show the Four Guardian Kings clad in armor with long flowing scarves. On the side doors are bodhisattvas holding lotus blossoms and forming a mudra. On the back is represented a sacred landscape with heights topped with pagodas. The dais shows on its front relics, seated monks making offerings, and apsara. On the back is depicted Mount Sumeru. The right side shows {{a scene from the}} Nirvana Sutra, where the Buddha offers his life in return <b>for</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sacred teachings, before being caught in his plummet by Indra. On the left panel of the dais is a scene from the Golden Light Sutra of a bodhisattva removing his upper garments before casting himself from a cliff to feed a hungry tigress and her cubs.|$|E

500|$|During the Prime Minister's Western swing, St. Laurent made formal speeches only {{in major}} cities. In {{contrast}} to Diefenbaker's whistle-stop train touring, with a hasty speech in each town {{as the train}} passed through, the Liberals allowed ample time for [...] "Uncle Louis" [...] {{to shake hands with}} voters, pat their children on the head, and kiss their babies. In British Columbia, St. Laurent took the position that there were hardly any national issues worth discussing—the Liberals had brought Canada prosperity and all that was needed <b>for</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same was to return the party to office. After touring Western Canada, St. Laurent spent the remainder of the second week of the campaign returning to, and in, Ottawa. The third week opened with a major speech in Quebec City, followed by intensive campaigning in Ontario. The fifth week was devoted to the Maritime provinces and Eastern Quebec. The sixth week opened with a major rally in Ottawa, before St. Laurent returned to the Maritimes and Quebec, and the final week was spent in Ontario before St. Laurent returned to his hometown of Quebec City for the election.|$|E

2500|$|Bismarck had {{an entirely}} {{different}} view after the war in 1866: he was interested only in strengthening Prussia {{through the eyes of}} a staunch realist. Uniting Germany appeared immaterial to him unless it improved Prussia's position. [...] Bismarck had mentioned before the war the possibility of ceding territory along the Rhine to France, and Napoleon III, urged by his representatives in France, used these casual references by Bismarck to press <b>for</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> territory that Prussia had received from Austria. These discussions, leaked by Bismarck to the German states in the south, turned former enemies into allies almost overnight, receiving not only written guarantees but armies that would be under the control of Prussia.|$|E
2500|$|On August 9, 2012, Sparks {{stated in}} an {{interview}} with Billboard, that she had about seven songs set so far for her third album. Sparks stated [...] "It's going to be different from what my fans have heard before. [...] With (2009's) 'Battlefield' it was pop/rock {{and a little bit of}} pop/R, but I'm going <b>for</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> R side now, so it's like R/pop instead of pop/R" [...] In an interview with MTV, Sparks confirmed she had recorded a duet with Jason Derulo and it would be on the album and could serve as a potential single. Sparks performed on VH1 Divas 2012 with fellow singers Miley Cyrus, Kelly Rowland and Ciara. The show premiered on December 16, 2012. Sparks joined singers Ledisi and Melanie Fiona in a tribute to Whitney Houston.|$|E
2500|$|The Democrats {{said that}} would fatten the rich; the tariff should be low—for [...] "revenue only" [...] (thus not to foster manufacturing). Whigs argued that banks and paper money were needed; the Democrats countered that no honest man wants them. Public works {{programs}} to build roads, canals and railroads would give the country the infrastructure it needed for rapid economic development, said the Whigs. Democrats replied {{they did not want}} that kind of complex change. Rather the Democrats called <b>for</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same—especially more farms to raise the families in the traditional style. More land is needed for that, Democrats said, so they pushed for expansion south and west. Jackson conquered Florida for the US. Over intense Whig opposition, his political heir, James Polk (1844–48) added Texas, the Southwest, California, and Oregon. Next on the Democratic agenda would be Cuba.|$|E

2500|$|GameSpot's Jeff Gerstmann {{scored the}} game 7.2 out of 10. He was {{critical}} of the general gameplay, which he argued [...] "quickly boils down to you running from room to room, killing anything that pops up along the way." [...] He was also critical of the creature design, which he felt was [...] "largely recycled from last year's game, which is disappointing. The way the monsters in the last game were based on various methods of execution was interesting, but retrofitting them to fit Baltimore street crime seems cheap." [...] He concluded [...] "The Suffering: Ties That Bind has its moments, {{but most of these}} moments are the same sorts of moments that you saw in last year's game. If you're a fan of the previous game and you're looking <b>for</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same, Ties That Bind fits the bill, but more expansion on the themes of the first game would have made for a much more interesting final product." ...|$|E
2500|$|Several {{contemporary}} experts cite {{evidence of}} a much larger shortfall, however. Wallace Aykroyd, who {{had been a member of}} the Commission, wrote in 1975 that there had been a 25% shortfall in the harvest of the winter of 1942, exacerbated by increased exports, decreased imports, and a drain on the carryover of that year. , director of the Department of Civil Supplies (DCS) of the Government of Bengal, was responsible for managing food supplies from August 1942 to April 1943. He estimated the crop loss at 20%, with crop disease accounting <b>for</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> loss than the cyclone; other government sources privately admitted the shortfall was [...] "2 million tons". Rutger's University economist George Blyn argues that the Midnapur cyclone and floods of October 1942 plus the loss of imports from Burma caused the famine; he asserts the Bengal rice harvest had been reduced by one-third. These figures have been debated online by experts as recently as 2010.|$|E
2500|$|While {{he stated}} {{the song was}}n't [...] "full throttle" [...] as her past singles, Nick Levine of Digital Spy said the song was danceable, commenting it [...] "manages to be chunky and zesty at the same time." [...] He further complimented its {{dancefloor}} appeal, saying, [...] "it's enough to have K.Ro fearing for her 'Commander' title," [...] while preferring the subsequent release of uptempo songs, stating, [...] "At this rate, Burkey's big mobiles-in-the-air moment {{will just have to}} wait." [...] Giving the song a perfect five out of five stars review, a Popjustice writer called the song [...] "jaunty." [...] Fraser McAlpine of BBC Chart Blog said called the song [...] "deliriously happy, {{to the point of being}} simple-minded, and conjures up instant images of warmth and sunshiney freedom in everyone that hears it." [...] McAlpine also pointed out her label's wise decision to release it right at the ending of summer, with fans pining <b>for</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vacation season and waiting until Christmas. FemaleFirst said [...] "the track is set to cause a long-lasting heat wave when it hits radio in July" [...] and [...] "will also be blazing club floors across the country once again." [...] The review went on to say that the single [...] "has cemented her place as the UK’s prime female recording artist." ...|$|E
