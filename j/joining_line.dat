Considering {{the mosaic}} {{result of the}} lunar DOM (Digital Orthophoto Map) {{produced}} by China's “CE- 1 ” satellite, there usually exists a sharp gray jump beside the <b>joining</b> <b>line.</b> As to a strip image, the gray distribution may be uneven because of the light changing or position difference during photographing.

By making the pixels around boundary to change gradually, the <b>joining</b> <b>line</b> will finally be invisible. In order to solve the uneven gray distribution problems causing by imaging angle, light condition and other factors, a homogenization technology based on statistics of gray distribution was proposed.

40|$|Abstract. Friction Stir Welding (FSW) is {{a simple}} process {{involving}} a rotating tool (with an extended pin) traversing on the <b>joining</b> <b>line</b> of the two work pieces leaving behind the required weld. Tool geometry (pin and shoulder), rotational speed, traverse speed, and tilt angle are important parameters which determine the resultant properties of weld. Milling machines due to rotating tool and traversing {{can be used as}} a method of doing laboratory scale FSW experiment. In cases where milling machines have a fixed head, limitation of zero degree tool tilt angle results in substantial defects (e. g. tunnel defect) in weldments. In this study a new approach is developed and adopted for overcoming this limitation of a fixed head vertical milling machine to incorporate the flexibility of tool tilt. The results for welding with and without this approach are presented along with discussion and conclusion...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{objective}} of the work {{was to develop a}} technology for the friction stir welding (FSW) of copper elements of thicknesses exceeding 15 mm and pos-sible to use in the production of current conductor rails. The length of the con-ductor rail element <b>joining</b> <b>line</b> amounts to approximately 100 mm. The first stage involved FSP tests, i. e. tests of copper plasticisation, using the FSW method and creating the compact weld structure on plates having thicknesses between 8 and 20 mm. The next stage consisted in friction stir welding of copper ele-ments. The investigation involved testing copper plasticisation conditions while using the FSW process, the development of a welding tool as well as the develop-ment of conditions for proper welding of sheets/plates having thicknesses of up to 20 mm. It was observed that properly formed welds require the use of a rela-tively low tool rotation rate and good cooling of element-fixing tooling...|$|E

If {{all of the}} sides have the same length {{and all of the}} angles are congruent, the polygon is called regular. The sum of the angles of a regular polygon with n sides, where n is 3 or more, is 180 ° x (n – 2) degrees. If a regular polygon were {{connected}} with other regular polygons in three dimensional space, a polyhedron could be created. In geometry, a polyhedron is a three-dimensional solid which consists of a collection of polygons joined at their edges. The word polyhedron is derived from the Greek word poly (many) and the Indo-European term hedron (seat). The plural of polyhedron is "polyhedra " (or sometimes "polyhedrons"), and their discovery dates back to the ancient Greeks. Pythagoras, famous for his Pythagorean Theorem, was thought to believe that there were an infinite number of regular polyhedra, polyhedra whose faces are congruent regular polygons which are assembled in the same way around each vertex. Plato also knew about regular polyhedra, as evidenced by his inclusion of five regular polyhedra in his work “the Timaeus”. He associated the cube with earth, the tetrahedron with fire, th...|$|E

Boundary conditions on the <b>joining</b> <b>line</b> are obtained for the land-based part of the glacier. The dynamics of the ice-divide domain of the glacier is analysed for the case of axially symmetric, steady, isothermal ice flow. 0 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved. Laboratory investigations [l] {{have shown that the}} motion of ice can be described using a model of the flow of an incompressible fluid with an exponential rheological aw and a creep coefficient close to three (Glen’s law). In the case of glaciers, the Reynolds number is of the order of 10 -l ’ and the Stokes approximation, which describes inertialess flow, is therefore used. It has been shown [2] that, in the case of many glaciers, the effect of temperature can be taken into account by the choice of its characteristic value in the layer close to the base. On account of this, we will henceforth confine ourselves to considering two-dimensional isothermal flow. We shall also assume that there is no ablation and slippage of ice on the bed [3] (which is assumed to be solid). The viscosity of water is neglected compared with the viscosity of ice (in the floating ice region) and the high-frequency components of the function for the bed profile are also neglected (the characteristic slopes of the bed and the upper surface of the land-based glacier are assumed to be equal) ...|$|E

Due to the very little quantum energy Eo, the ratio Eo/mc 2 equals about 10 - 50 so the collisions with particles follow the optical reflection accurately. The simultaneous micro-quanta hitting upon a nucleon are about 10 50 �, a high number due to the small wavelength which results close to Planck’s length. Along the <b>joining</b> <b>line</b> between two particles {{there is a lack of}} incident quanta (missing beam) which determines unbalanced collisions generating drawing forces between particles by mutual screening. These forces increment the particle energy, as shown for instance by the heating during the gravitational contraction of the galactic gas globules leading to protostars. This mechanism allows to predict that observations of the thermal emission from major solar planets may exceed the power received from solar light. When two particles are very close, the mutual screening highly increments the missing beam, giving rise to a short-range strong force which is of the right strength to hold protons and neutrons within the atomic © 2008 C.

The same process originates also a short-range “weak ” force on the electron closely orbiting a proton, giving rise to the neutron structure which undergoes β − decay.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present the {{advantages}} of the direct presCrIbed suRface Curvature distribution bLade dEsign (CIRCLE) method for the design of high-efficiency turbomachinery blades. These advantages are illustrated by redesigning several examples of axial turbomachinery blades of interest to energy conversion devices, and discussing in detail the aerodynamic performance and efficiency improvements of the redesigned blades over the original geometries. The two-dimensional (2 D) method, originally proposed for turbine blades, has been extended for use with 2 D and three-dimensional (3 D) turbine, compressor and fan blades, and isolated airfoils. By specification, the method allows <b>joining</b> <b>line</b> segments between the leading edge (LE) and trailing edge (TE) circles or ellipses so that the streamwise distribution of surface curvature and slope of curvature are continuous everywhere from the LE stagnation point to the TE stagnation point. The form of the line segments to prevent the “wiggles” of higher order lines is presented. Also by specification, the CIRCLE method can be integrated with multi-objective heuristic or evolutionary-algorithm optimization methods. The efficacy of the method is examined by: redesigning two 2 D turbine blades, one 2 D compressor blade, and one 2 D isolated airfoil; and by designing one 3 D compressor blade row and one 3 D turbine blade row. The aerodynamic performance improvements between the original and the sample redesigned blades are discussed in detail, resulting in higher-efficiency blades than the original geometries. Further extension of the method for centrifugal and mixed-flow impeller geometries is a coordinate transformation. It is concluded that the CIRCLE method is a new design environment enabling the original design (or redesign) of high-efficiency 2 D and 3 D turbomachine blades, with direct applications in a variety of energy conversion devices. <br/...|$|E
