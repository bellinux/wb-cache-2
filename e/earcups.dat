5000|$|First {{reviewed}} in 1993, the MDR-V600 {{was designed to}} satisfy DJs who wanted {{a greater emphasis on}} bass. To help DJs in cuing songs with one ear, the MDR-V600's <b>earcups</b> can be swiveled around backwards. In a test of virtual surround on a portable DVD player, using the movie House of Flying Daggers, the MDR-V600 was praised: [...] "the imaging, separation, and clarity of sound was impressive".|$|E

5000|$|In {{loud enough}} environments, {{the ear canal}} can vibrate, causing the air trapped inside the <b>earcup</b> to vibrate as well. This {{typically}} only occurs with low frequency noise, but can reduce {{the effectiveness of the}} hearing protection device.|$|R
25|$|Supra-aural {{headphones}} or on-ear headphones have pads {{that press}} against the ears, rather than around them. They were commonly bundled with personal stereos during the 1980s. This type of headphone generally {{tends to be}} smaller and lighter than circumaural headphones, resulting in less attenuation of outside noise. Supra-aural headphones {{can also lead to}} discomfort due to the pressure on the ear as compared to circumaural headphones that sit around the ear. Comfort may vary due to the <b>earcup</b> material.|$|R
5000|$|Since 1999, Ultrasone AG {{has been}} {{producing}} headphones that they claim {{reduce the risk}} of hearing damage, through the use of more efficient transducers and <b>earcups</b> shielded to reduce electromagnetic radiation, designated as LE/ULE (Low/UltraLow Emission). Ultrasone claims that magnetic fields so close to the head could contribute to [...] "listener fatigue" [...] and might be [...] "a potential health hazard". According to Ultrasone, their headphones reduce magnetic emissions by up to 98 percent compared to other headphones.|$|E
5000|$|Improper earmuff fit {{can cause}} discomfort, {{which in turn}} may cause the {{individual}} to avoid wearing the hearing protection device, reducing its effectiveness. Characteristics of a comfortable earmuff include: lightweight material, soft and removable circumaural cushions, low heat and humidity buildup, easy maintenance, reduction in low-frequency noise, no resonances of sound within the earcup, wide headband, and large enough <b>earcups</b> to allow for full coverage of the outer ear. If the individual finds the hearing protection device to be uncomfortable, {{he or she should}} explore other options for hearing protection, such as a different style of earmuff or earplugs.|$|E
50|$|On September 3, 2014, Bose {{announced}} the QuietComfort 25 headphones, {{the successor to}} the QuietComfort 15. QuietComfort 25 features a new cosmetic design, {{as well as new}} improved audio and enhanced noise-canceling performance. The folding design of the headphones has also been improved for a new, smaller carrying case. The ear cushions of the headphones are manufactured with protein leather, a synthetic material, and the <b>EarCups</b> feature a soft-touch TPE bumper and cast zinc pivot. A major change is the ability to continue to use the headphones after the battery has expired, without the noise-cancelling feature. Bose chose to eliminate the Hi/Low switch present on the previous model which allowed users to adjust for low-output devices like MP3 players.|$|E
50|$|During {{the amount}} of time an {{individual}} wears earmuffs, the device can be jostled and displaced from the proper position that allows for the highest attenuation. This can be common in the workplace, as many individuals are in motion during the time they are wearing the hearing protection device. Moving the jaw while chewing or talking and perspiration are examples of ways in which readjustment can occur, causing the seal to be broken between the <b>earcup</b> and skin and allowing sound to leak in.|$|R
50|$|The {{domestic}} Kingfisher Class had 32-34 inch seat pitch. Every {{seat was}} equipped with personal IFE systems with AVOD on board the Airbus A320 family aircraft. As in Kingfisher First, passengers could access movies, English and Hindi TV programmes, a few live TV channels powered by DishTV, and Kingfisher Radio. The screen was controlled by a controller-console on the seat armrest. <b>Earcup</b> headphones were provided free of cost to all passengers. The default channel showed, alternating every few seconds, the aeroplane's ground speed, outside temperature, altitude, distance and time to destination, {{the position of the}} aircraft on a graphical map, and one or more advertisements. Passengers were served meals on most flights. Before take-off, passengers were served bottled lemonade. Along with the headphones a pen and a keychain with the Kingfisher logo were also given.|$|R
40|$|Detailed {{acoustic}} engineering {{models that}} explore noise propagation mechanisms associated with noise attenuation and transmission paths created when using hearing protectors such as earplugs and headsets in high noise environments. Biomedical finite element (FE) models are developed based on volume Computed Tomography scan data which provides explicit external ear, ear canal, middle ear ossicular bones and cochlea geometry. Results from {{these studies have}} enabled {{a greater understanding of}} hearing protector to flesh dynamics as well as prioritizing noise propagation mechanisms. Prioritization of noise mechanisms can form an essential framework for exploration of new design principles and methods in both earplug and <b>earcup</b> applications. These models are currently being used in development of a novel hearing protection evaluation system that can provide experimentally correlated psychoacoustic noise attenuation. Moreover, these FE models can be used to simulate the effects of blast related impulse noise on human auditory mechanisms and brain tissue...|$|R
40|$|Noise {{cancellation}} headphones (NCHs) {{supplement the}} acoustic isolation characteristic of headphones with active noise reduction.

The principles of passive attenuation after which active attenuation which includes feedforward and feedback methods, are described. 1...|$|E
30|$|CT {{images of}} the {{cylinder}} phantom with the headphones in place revealed homogeneous X-ray attenuation of the headphone material of 350 – 500  Hounsfield units (HU; for comparison, water 0  HU; compact bone 1000 – 1500  HU; Fig.  1), corresponding to linear absorption values μ at 511  keV of around 0.12  cm− 1, as obtained from the machine-derived PET attenuation images [14]. PET annihilation radiation traversing both <b>earcups</b> (thickness ~ 2  cm) perpendicularly was therefore expected to decrease in intensity to a value of exp(– 0.12  cm− 1 [*]×[*] 2  cm[*]×[*] 2)[*]=[*] 62  %. This was confirmed by forward projecting the attenuation map using the open source program STIR [15], resulting in a value of approximately 59  % for those lines.|$|E
30|$|The {{provided}} headphones were {{proven to}} cause considerable attenuation of 511  keV photons of PET, thus justifying the manufacturer’s disapproval of using them for simultaneous PET scanning of the head. Their effects on PET quantification in phantom and patient studies were clearly evidenced in the scans. In the latter, especially the cerebellum and the temporal lobes as regions that are located right between the <b>earcups</b> experienced a rather uniform decrease in uptake values of approximately 10  %, while more remote regions were less affected. Therefore, specifically in PET studies where absolute uptake quantification is necessary (e.g. kinetic modelling of tracer uptake in the brain), the headphones should be avoided. In cases where quantification {{is not of}} importance, the headphone-introduced bias may still have diagnostic impact {{despite the absence of}} localised visual artefacts.|$|E
40|$|Hearing loss {{claims have}} risen {{steadily}} in the U. S. Department of Veterans Affairs across all military services for decades. The U. S. Navy, with U. S. Air Force and industry partners, {{is working to}} improve hearing protection and speech intelligibility for aircraft carrier flight deck crews who work up to 16 hours per day in 130 - 150 dB tactical jet aircraft noise. Currently, flight deck crews are required to wear double hearing protection: earplugs and earmuffs (in cranial helmet). Previous studies indicated this double hearing protection provides approximately 30 dB of noise attenuation when earplugs are inserted correctly and the cranial/earmuffs are well-fit and in good condition. To assess hearing protection practices and estimate noise attenuation levels for active duty flight deck crews, Naval Air Systems Command surveyed 301 U. S. Navy Atlantic and Pacific Fleet flight deck personnel from four aircraft carriers and two amphibious assault ships. The survey included a detailed assessment of cranial helmet fit and maintenance condition (e. g., earmuff headband tension, <b>earcup</b> foam and cushion integrity); earplug use and insertion depth; anthropometri...|$|R
30|$|A {{cylinder}} phantom was scanned {{without and}} with dedicated MR headphones in a PET/CT scanner. Headphone attenuation was additionally assessed {{in a clinical}} setup in 10 patients on a PET/MR scanner using F- 18 -fluoro-deoxy-glucose. The difference in tracer uptake with and without headset was determined for the various brain regions. Additionally, the patients were asked for differences in noise levels, patient comfort, communication quality, and preference. CT data revealed headphone attenuation values of 350 – 500  HU. Neglecting headphone attenuation leads to a decrease in PET values between the <b>earcups</b> of about 11  % {{when compared to the}} correctly reconstructed data. Regions further away from the headphones were less affected. Patient images demonstrated a decrease of 11  % on average in the cerebellum and temporal lobes, while other regions were less affected.

40|$|Research {{over the}} past decade has {{demonstrated}} substantial increases in noise reduction performance for circumaural hearing protectors through feedforward active noise reduction (ANR) based on least mean square (LMS) methods. However, commercialization of feedforward ANR hearing protection devices has yet to occur. This paper explores issues related to robust realization of feedforward ANR for hearing protection. Specifically, the dynamic range of noise sources, the potential for leakage around circumaural <b>earcups,</b> vibration conditions of high noise environments, and the need for communication requires ANR algorithms that are robust to large variations in the acoustical dynamics of hearing protectors. To meet this need, a hybrid ANR architecture that exhibits excellent stability margins and performance for both stationary and non-stationary noise sources is presented. The hybrid system is comprised of a Lyapunov-tuned leaky LMS feedforward component and a broadband digital feedback ANR system. The contribution of each component to ANR performance is adjusted by individual feedforward and feedback gain factors, and stability margins are defined by the net increase in these gains that can be accommodated while maintaining system stability. Stability and noise reduction performance of the hybrid system are validated experimentally using an earcup from a commercia...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the validity of}} diagnostic pure-tone audiometry in a natural environment using a computer-operated audiometer with insert earphones covered by circumaural <b>earcups</b> incorporating real-time monitoring of environmental noise. Design: A within-subject repeated measures design was employed to compare air (250 to 8000 Hz) and bone (250 to 4000 Hz) conduction pure-tone thresholds measured in retirement facilities with thresholds measured in a sound-treated booth. Study sample: 147 adults (average age 76 ± 5. 7 years) were evaluated. Pure-tone averages were normal in 59 %, mildly (> 40 dB) elevated in 23 % and moderately (> 55 dB) elevated in 6 % of ears. Results: Air-conduction thresholds (n= 2259) corresponded within 0 to 5 dB in 95 % of all comparisons between the two test environments. Bone-conduction thresholds (n= 1669) corresponded within 0 to 5 dB in 86 % of comparisons. Average threshold differences (- 0. 6 to 1. 1) and standard deviations (3. 3 to 5. 9) were within typical test-retest reliability limits. Thresholds recorded showed {{no statistically significant differences}} (Paired Samples T-test:p˃ 0. 01) except at 8000 Hz in the left ear. Conclusion: Valid diagnostic pure-tone audiometry can be performed in a natural environment with recently developed technology, offering the possibility of access to diagnostic audiometry in communities where sound-treated booths are unavailable.

40|$|Background: MR {{headphones}} are attenuation sources affecting PET quantification in hybrid PET/MRI. Despite potentially better patient communication, usage in PET/MRI scans is {{not approved}} by the vendor. This study aims to determine the impact of headphones on PET by means of phantom and patient scans. Additionally, the perceived benefit of using headphones was evaluated. Findings: A cylinder phantom was scanned without and with dedicated MR headphones in a PET/CT scanner. Headphone attenuation was additionally assessed in a clinical setup in 10 patients on a PET/MR scanner using F- 18 -fluoro-deoxy-glucose. The difference in tracer uptake with and without headset was determined for the various brain regions.

No visual artefacts in the images were noticed. On average, no advantage in terms of noise and patient comfort and only slightly better quality of communication were imparted by the patients. Conclusions: Using headphones during PET/MR acquisition leads to a negative bias in brain uptake values without introducing obvious image artefacts. Since they lack benefits for the patients, they should be avoided if PET quantification of the brain is needed...|$|E
40|$|It is {{estimated}} that 10 % of the global population is impaired to a significant degree by a decrease in hearing sensitivity. With the greatest proportion of these persons residing in developing countries where communities are grossly underserved, it is incumbent on hearing healthcare professionals to seek means of offering equitable hearing health care services to these communities. The delivery of conventional diagnostic hearing services to these population groups is challenged by limitations in human resources, financial constraints and by the dearth of audiometric testing facilities that are compliant with permissible ambient noise levels for reliable testing. Valid diagnostic hearing assessment without an audiometric test booth will allow greater mobility of services and could extend hearing healthcare service delivery in underserved areas. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the validity of diagnostic pure tone audiometry in a natural environment, outside a sound treated room, using a computer-operated audiometer with insert earphones covered by circumaural <b>earcups</b> incorporating real-time monitoring of environmental noise. A within-subject repeated measures research design was employed to assess elderly adults with diagnostic air (250 to 8000 Hz) and bone (250 to 4000 Hz) conduction pure tone audiometry. The study was of a quantitative nature and the required data was collected by testing subjects initially in a natural environment and subsequently in a sound booth environment to compare the threshold measurements. One experienced audiologist used audiometric KUDUwave test equipment to evaluate subjects in both environments. A total of 147 adults with an average age of 76 (± 5. 7) years were tested. Ears had pure tone averages (500, 1000, 2000 and 4000 Hz) of ≥ 25 dB in 59 %, > 40 dB in 23 % and ˃ 55 dB in 6 % of cases. Analysis of collected data showed air conduction thresholds (n = 2259) corresponding within 0 to 5 dB in 95 % of all comparisons between testing in the natural and sound booth environments. Bone conduction thresholds (n = 1669) corresponded within 0 to 5 dB in 86 % of comparisons and within 10 dB or less in 97 % of cases. Average threshold differences (– 0. 6 to 1. 1) and standard deviations (3. 3 to 5. 9) were within typical test-retest reliability limits. Recorded thresholds showed no statistically significant differences with a paired samples t-test (p ˃ 0. 01) except at 8000 Hz in the left ear. Overall the correlation between the air-conduction thresholds recorded in the sound booth environment and the natural environment was very high (˃ 0. 92) across all frequencies while for bone conduction threshold correlation for the two environments fell between 0. 63 and 0. 97. This study demonstrates that valid diagnostic pure tone audiometry in an elderly population can be performed in a natural environment using an audiometer employing insert earphones covered by circumaural <b>earcups</b> with real-time monitoring of ambient noise levels. Mobile diagnostic audiometry performed outside of an audiometric sound booth may extend current hearing healthcare services to remote underserved communities where booths are scarce or inaccessible. In combination with Telehealth applications this technology could offer a powerful and viable alternate diagnostic service to persons unable to attend conventional testing facilities for whatever reasons.
