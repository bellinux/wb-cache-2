5|$|All juniper species grow berries, {{but some}} are {{considered}} too bitter to <b>eat.</b> <b>In</b> addition to J. communis, other edible species include Juniperus drupacea, Juniperus phoenicea, Juniperus deppeana, and Juniperus californica. But the berries of some species, such as Juniperus sabina, are toxic and consumption of them is inadvisable.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Objective: To {{establish}} what {{is known}} about binge <b>eating</b> <b>in</b> children and adoles-cents and to identify unresolved questions. Method: We reviewed relevant studies to high-light and synthesize salient research findings. Discussion: Available research has suggested that loss of control over eating may be more important than consumption of an objectively large amount of food in the assessment of binge <b>eating</b> <b>in</b> children. In addition, dieting may not be associated consistently with binge <b>eating</b> <b>in</b> children. Behavioral correlates of binges may include <b>eating</b> <b>in</b> the absence of hunger, <b>eating</b> <b>in</b> response to strong emotions or external cues, and <b>eating</b> <b>in</b> secret. On the basis of available research, provisional research criteria for binge <b>eating</b> disorder (BED) <b>in</b> children are suggested to stimulate further study of pediatric samples. We emphasize the need for prospective studies on the relationships among aberrant eating, weight and mood, and the inclusion of boys and girls of differen...|$|R

5|$|Capybaras are farmed {{for meat}} and skins in South America. The meat is {{considered}} unsuitable to <b>eat</b> <b>in</b> some areas, while {{in other areas}} it is considered {{an important source of}} protein. In parts of South America, especially in Venezuela, capybara meat is popular during Lent and Holy Week as the Catholic Church previously issued special dispensation to allow it to be eaten while other meats are generally forbidden.|$|E
5|$|During these {{workshops}} it {{was decided}} that the first target for the group's actions would be downtown lunch counters. At the time, African Americans were allowed to shop in downtown stores but were not allowed to <b>eat</b> <b>in</b> the stores' restaurants. The group felt that the lunch counters were a good objective because they were highly visible, easily accessible, and provided a stark example of the injustices black Southerners faced every day.|$|E

40|$|The ﬁrst aim of {{this study}} was to examine the {{association}} between different dimensions of family func- tioning and dysfunctional <b>eating</b> <b>in</b> a sample of Italian adolescent boys and girls. The second aim was to investi- gate whether gender moderates the relationship between family functioning and dysfunctional eating. Seven hun- dred and twenty seven adolescents (500 boys and 227 girls) with ages ranging from 15 to 18 years completed a survey of self-report measures. Findings from hierarchical multi- ple regression analysis suggested that aspects of family functioning such as ﬂexibility, cohesion, disengagement, enmeshment, rigidity and chaotic were related to dys- functional <b>eating</b> <b>in</b> adolescents. Additionally the results indicated differences between boys and girls, <b>in</b> particular dysfunctional <b>eating</b> <b>in</b> adolescent boys seemed to be more affected by dimensions of enmeshment and disengagement than dysfunctional <b>eating</b> <b>in</b> girls. This research highlights the important role of various aspects of family functioning in relation to dysfunctional <b>eating</b> <b>in</b> adolescents...|$|R

5|$|Common elands are nomadic and crepuscular. They <b>eat</b> <b>in</b> {{the morning}} and evening, rest in shade when hot and remain in {{sunlight}} when cold. They are commonly found in herds of up to 500, with individual members remaining in the herd anywhere from several hours to several months. Juveniles and mothers tend to form larger herds, while males may separate into smaller groups or wander individually. During estrus, mainly in the rainy season, groups tend to form more regularly. In southern Africa common elands will often associate with herds of zebras, roan antelopes and oryxes.|$|E

5|$|Consensus has {{determined}} sea turtles, including E. imbricata to be, {{at the very}} least, threatened species because of their slow growth and maturity, and slow reproductive rates. Many adult turtles {{have been killed by}} humans, both accidentally and deliberately. Their existence is threatened due to pollution and loss of nesting areas because of coastal development. Biologist guess that the hawkbill population has declined 80 percent in the past hundred years. Human and animal encroachment threatens nesting sites, and small mammals dig up the eggs to <b>eat.</b> <b>In</b> the US Virgin Islands, mongooses raid hawksbill nests (along with those of other sea turtles, such as Dermochelys coriacea) right after they are laid.|$|E
5|$|Many Jews observe kashrut partially, by abstaining from pork or shellfish, or by not {{drinking}} milk with a meat dish. Some keep kosher at home but will <b>eat</b> <b>in</b> a non-kosher restaurant. In 2012, one {{analysis of the}} specialty food market in North America estimated that only 15% of Kosher consumers were Jewish. A sizable non-Jewish {{segment of the population}} views kosher certification as an indication of wholesomeness. Muslims, Hindus, and people with allergies to dairy foods often consider the kosher-pareve designation as an assurance that a food contains no animal-derived ingredients, including milk and all of its derivatives. However, since kosher-pareve foods may contain honey, eggs, or fish, strict vegetarians cannot rely on the certification.|$|E
5|$|The episode's finale is Don's day and {{the trip}} to Howard Johnson's Restaurant and Motor Lodge in Plattsburgh. As he and Megan <b>eat</b> <b>in</b> the restaurant, Megan expresses her {{frustration}} at having her needs and desires {{take a back seat}} to Don's. The discussion escalates into a fight, during which Megan makes a hurtful remark about Don's mother, and Don storms out and drives off without her. Don returns sometime later and begins to worry when he can't find Megan. He spends hours looking for and waiting for her, calling Peggy (the other side of the conversation from the first part of the episode) as well as Megan's mother in Montreal.|$|E

5|$|The station’s first {{expansion}} came in 1850 {{when the}} new East Lancashire line used new platforms staffed and managed by the East Lancashire Railway, with their own entrance and booking office in Butler Street. From 1863, trains between London and Scotland, having no dining cars, were scheduled to allow 20 minutes at Preston for passengers to <b>eat</b> <b>in</b> the station’s dining room. The pressure on catering staff was increased when northbound and southbound trains would often arrive about the same time. The condition of the station deteriorated {{to the extent that}} on 18 August 1866 part of the roof on the East Lancashire side collapsed injuring three people, one seriously. By then, 150 trains a day passed through the station.|$|E
5|$|This {{was added}} to the south of the Great Hall in the early 16th century to provide a small {{intimate}} room where the family could <b>eat</b> <b>in</b> private away from the servants. Above it is the small Oriel Bedroom, probably originally a dressing room for the Great Chamber as its only entrance is via that room. At {{the same time that the}} oriel room and bedroom were added, rooms were added or remodeled to the south of the Great Hall: the Great Parlour with Great Chamber above, and the Little Parlour with Little Parlour above. John Lyte, the builder, placed his coat of arms on the outside of the building.|$|E
5|$|A single {{spotted hyena}} can eat at least 14.5kg of meat per meal. Although spotted hyenas act aggressively {{toward each other}} when feeding, they {{compete with each other}} mostly through speed of eating, rather than by {{fighting}} as lions do. When feeding on an intact carcass, spotted hyenas will first consume the meat around the loins and anal region, then open the abdominal cavity and pull out the soft organs. Once the stomach, its wall and contents are consumed, the hyenas will eat the lungs and abdominal and leg muscles. Once the muscles have been eaten, the carcass is disassembled and the hyenas carry off pieces to <b>eat</b> <b>in</b> peace. Spotted hyenas are adept at eating their prey in water: they have been observed to dive under floating carcasses to take bites, then resurface to swallow. A single hyena can take less than two minutes in eating a gazelle fawn, while a group of 35 hyenas can completely consume an adult zebra in 36 minutes. Spotted hyenas do not require much water, and typically only spend 30 seconds drinking.|$|E

5|$|Driving on, Marion {{stops for}} {{the night at the}} Bates Motel. The proprietor, Norman Bates, invites her to a light dinner after she checks in. She accepts, but then hears an {{argument}} between Norman and his mother about bringing a woman into her house. They <b>eat</b> <b>in</b> the motel parlor, where he tells her about his life with his mother, who is mentally ill and forbids him to have a life outside of her. Her sense of compassion and responsibility awakened by Norman's story, Marion decides to go back to Phoenix in the morning to return the stolen money, and prepares for bed. As she is showering, a shadowy figure comes in and stabs her to death with a chef's knife. Norman discovers the murder and assumes his mother is responsible. He meticulously cleans up the crime scene, putting Marion's corpse and her possessions—including the embezzled money—into the trunk of her car and sinking it in the swamps near the motel.|$|E
5|$|In all versions, Khandoba {{returns to}} Jejuri {{with his new}} wife and faces the wrath of Mhalsa. Many songs tell about the {{confrontations}} of Mhalsa and Banai. In some songs, Mhalsa complains about Khandoba's infatuation with the impure Banai. The cantankerous Mhalsa grumbles how Banai has polluted the house by her uncouth ways and suggests that Banai {{should be returned to}} the wilderness again. The songs sing how the vegetarian, high-caste Mhalsa is forced to catch fish and <b>eat</b> <b>in</b> the same plate as the non-vegetarian low-caste Banai. Mhalsa is portrayed blaming Banai for the problems in the palace and talking about her superiority to Banai. Banai retorts by saying that Khandoba came to her, mesmerized by her beauty and became her servant. A frustrated Khandoba leaves the palace on a hunting trip after Mhalsa and Banai quarrel about who will embroider a shawl for him and marries Rambhai. The songs also narrate how ultimately the wives have to remain in harmony and aid each other. For example, a song sings how Mhalsa and Banai come together and celebrate the festival of Diwali with Khandoba at Jejuri.|$|E
5|$|Once prey {{is brought}} down, wolves begin to feed excitedly, ripping and {{tugging at the}} carcass in all directions, and bolting down large chunks of it. The {{breeding}} pair typically monopolizes food {{in order to continue}} producing pups. When food is scarce, this is done {{at the expense of other}} family members, especially non-pups. The breeding pair typically eats first, though as it is they who usually work the hardest in killing prey, they may rest after a long hunt and allow the rest of the family to eat unmolested. Once the breeding pair has finished eating, the rest of the family tears off pieces of the carcass and transport them to secluded areas where they can <b>eat</b> <b>in</b> peace. Wolves typically commence feeding by consuming the larger internal organs of their prey, such as the heart, liver, lungs and stomach lining. The kidneys and spleen are eaten once they are exposed, followed by the muscles. A single wolf can eat 15–19% of its body weight in a single feeding.|$|E
