5|$|A {{new round}} of {{concession}} applications were filed in 1987: Trondheim to Northern Norway, Tromsø–Longyearbyen, Oslo–Billund and Oslo–Alicante. The right-winged Willoch's Second Cabinet decided to use three principles in issuing new concessions: keeping the array of local routes, granting concessions on the terms that the airlines would continue to cross-subsidize routes, and to introduce competition on the largest routes. Braathens SAFE was <b>given</b> <b>permission</b> to fly Oslo–Bergen and Western Norway – Trondheim – Bodø – Tromsø, plus once daily Oslo–Trondheim–Bodø, as well as Tromsø–Longyearbyen. At the same time, SAS was allowed to fly freely on the routes Oslo–Trondheim and Oslo–Stavanger. In 1988, Braathens SAFE introduced automatic check-in machines in Oslo, Stavanger, Bergen, Ålesund and Trondheim.|$|E
5|$|As {{the first}} {{settlers}} of the municipality, the Islanders {{and their descendants}} were designated hidalgos. The established settlers resented the Islanders for their new titles and exclusive privileges within the city government. The newcomers {{did not know how}} to handle horses, rendering them useless in mounted warfare against the Apaches. Unlike the established settlers, who relied on ranching, the Islanders were primarily farmers, and their refusal to build fences led to many disagreements when livestock trampled the fields. By the early 1740s, however, intermarriage and the need for closer economic ties had helped to alleviate some of the infighting, and the original settlers were <b>given</b> <b>permission</b> to serve as magistrates and council members.|$|E

5|$|During the battle, Graham also {{saved the}} life of Captain Wyndham– {{one of those who}} had shut the gate– by {{shooting}} a sniper whose musket was trained on the officer. Mid-afternoon, a fire broke out in one of the farm buildings following a bombardment of incendiary shells. Graham's brother Joseph was lying wounded within, and Graham requested permission to fall out, so he might rescue his brother; <b>given</b> <b>permission,</b> he retrieved his brother and returned to his post. Joseph Graham died of wounds five days later.|$|E
5|$|In February 1953, Lympne {{was again}} {{waterlogged}} and Silver City Airways operated out of Southend and Blackbushe. The company {{stated that they}} were willing to purchase Lympne, but the decision of Folkestone Town Council was still awaited for. By May, Folkestone Town Council had decided not to purchase Lympne and Silver City Airways again expressed an interest in purchasing the airport at a reasonable price. In November, it was announced that Air Kruise had been <b>given</b> <b>permission</b> to operate a scheduled service from Lympne and/or Ramsgate to Birmingham. The service was to be seasonal between April and September, with permission to run the service lasting until 1960. Air Kruise moved its operations to Ramsgate Airport in 1953.|$|E

5|$|In {{an attempt}} to coax Hitler out of his rage, General Alfred Jodl speculated that General Walther Wenck's XII Army, which was facing the Americans, could move to Berlin because the Americans, already on the Elbe River, were {{unlikely}} to move further east. This assumption was based on his viewing of the captured Eclipse documents, which organised the partition of Germany among the Allies. Hitler immediately grasped the idea, and within hours Wenck was ordered to disengage from the Americans and move the XII Army north-east to support Berlin. It was then realised that if the IX Army moved west, it could link up with the XII Army. In the evening Heinrici was <b>given</b> <b>permission</b> to make the link-up.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Stafford and Cernan, still {{circling}} in {{the clouds}} in the second T-38, {{had no idea what}} had happened to their flight partners. Air traffic controllers were confused by the two planes in flight attempting different abort actions after the initial missed approach, and moreover no one on the ground knew who was in the crashed plane. After some delay, Stafford and Cernan were asked to identify themselves and <b>given</b> <b>permission</b> to land, but they were not informed of the crash until on the ground. Although personally distraught over the loss of his close colleagues and friends, Stafford acted as NASA's chief contact on the scene until other personnel arrived to relieve him later in the day.|$|E
5|$|O'Leary served {{three years}} with the Irish Guards, leaving in August 1913 to join the Royal Northwest Mounted Police (RNWMP) in Saskatchewan, Canada.

At {{the outbreak of the}} First World War in Europe during August 1914, O'Leary was <b>given</b> <b>permission</b> to leave the RNWMP and return to Britain in order to rejoin the army as an active reservist. On 22 October, O'Leary was mobilized and on 23 November he joined his regiment in France, then fighting with the British Expeditionary Force, entrenched in Flanders.|$|E
