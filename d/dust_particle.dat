5|$|A {{permanent}} asymmetric moon {{dust cloud}} exists around the Moon, created by small particles from comets. Estimates are 5 tons of comet particles strike the Moon's surface each 24 hours. The particles strike the Moon's surface ejecting moon dust above the Moon. The dust stays above the Moon approximately 10 minutes, taking 5 minutes to rise, and 5 minutes to fall. On average, 120 kilograms of dust are present above the Moon, rising to 100 kilometers above the surface. The dust measurements {{were made by}} LADEE's Lunar Dust EXperiment (LDEX), between 20 and 100 kilometers above the surface, during a six-month period. LDEX detected an average of one 0.3 micrometer moon <b>dust</b> <b>particle</b> each minute. <b>Dust</b> <b>particle</b> counts peaked during the Geminid, Quadrantid, Northern Taurid, and Omicron Centaurid meteor showers, when the Earth, and Moon, pass through comet debris.

The remaining bodies range down {{to the size of}} a <b>dust</b> <b>particle.</b> The asteroid material is so thinly distributed that numerous unmanned spacecraft have traversed it without incident. Nonetheless, collisions between large asteroids do occur, and these can produce an asteroid family whose members have similar orbital characteristics and compositions. Individual asteroids within {{the asteroid}} belt are categorized by their spectra, with most falling into three basic groups: carbonaceous (C-type), silicate (S-type), and metal-rich (M-type).|$|E
5|$|A {{snowflake}} is {{a single}} ice crystal that has achieved a sufficient size, and may have amalgamated with others, then falls through the Earth's atmosphere as snow. Each flake nucleates around a <b>dust</b> <b>particle</b> in supersaturated air masses by attracting supercooled cloud water droplets, which freeze and accrete in crystal form. Complex shapes emerge as the flake moves through differing temperature and humidity zones in the atmosphere, such that individual snowflakes differ in detail from one another, but may be categorized in eight broad classifications and at least 80 individual variants. The main constituent shapes for ice crystals, from which combinations may occur, are needle, column, plate and rime. Snowflakes appear white in color despite being made of clear ice. This is due to diffuse reflection of the whole spectrum of light by the small crystal facets.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the 1986U2R/ζ and λ rings, there are other extremely faint dust bands in the Uranian ring system. They are invisible during occultations because they have negligible optical depth, though they are bright in forward-scattered light. Voyager 2s images of forward-scattered light revealed the existence of bright dust bands between the λ and δ rings, between the η and β rings, and between the α ring and ring 4. Many of these bands were detected again in 2003–2004 by the Keck Telescope and during the 2007 ring-plane crossing event in backscattered light, but their precise locations and relative brightnesses were different from during the Voyager observations. The normal optical depth of the dust bands is about 10−5 or less. The <b>dust</b> <b>particle</b> size distribution is thought to obey a power law with the index p=2.5±0.5.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the early}} results from the Infrared Astronomy Satellite (IRAS) was the {{discovery}} of excess infrared flux coming from Vega, beyond what would be expected from the star alone. This excess was measured at wavelengths of 25, 60, and 100μm, and came from within an angular radius of 10arcseconds (10″) centered on the star. At the measured distance of Vega, this corresponded to an actual radius of 80astronomical units (AU), where an AU is the average radius of the Earth's orbit around the Sun. It was proposed that this radiation came from a field of orbiting particles with a dimension {{on the order of}} a millimeter, as anything smaller would eventually be removed from the system by radiation pressure or drawn into the star by means of Poynting–Robertson drag. The latter is the result of radiation pressure creating an effective force that opposes the orbital motion of a <b>dust</b> <b>particle,</b> causing it to spiral inward. This effect is most pronounced for tiny particles that are closer to the star.|$|E
25|$|Photoelectric heating in grains: The {{ultraviolet}} radiation emitted by hot stars can remove electrons from dust grains. The photon hits the dust grain, {{and some of}} its energy is used in overcoming the potential energy barrier (due to the possible positive charge of the grain) to remove the electron from the grain. The remainder of the photon's energy heats the grain and gives the ejected electron kinetic energy. Since the size distribution of dust grains is n(r)∝r, where r is the size of the <b>dust</b> <b>particle,</b> the grain area distribution is rn∝r. This indicates that the smallest dust grains dominate this method of heating.|$|E

The elemental composition and size of individual <b>dust</b> <b>particles,</b> and their mixture state with sea salt, sulfate and nitrate were analyzed using electron microscopes and an energy dispersive spectrometer. It was found that far less than 10 % of <b>dust</b> <b>particles</b> were internally mixed with sea salt.

25|$|In the 1980s Simpson Simpson and A. J. Tuzzolino {{developed}} the dust flux monitor instrument which involved a thin sheet of plastic which was polymerized {{in the presence}} of a strong electric field perpendicular to the plane of the plastic, and then electrically polarized carrying a positive electric charge on one of its surfaces and a negative charge on the other. The way it operated was such that a <b>dust</b> <b>particle</b> or heavy nucleus penetrating through the sheet first vaporizes in a small area releasing the charges, then the electrical signal indicates the location and size of the hole in the plastic which is then calibrated to give information on its speed and size. These calibrations took place from 1985 until 1989. Simpson's device was used on spacecraft Vega 1 and Vega 2 to Halley's comet in 1986, and earned him the Gagarin Medal for Space Exploration that year for his contribution towards the success of the Vega mission, as his instruments had been the only ones from the United States to encounter the comet.|$|E

30|$|If <b>dust</b> <b>{{particles}}</b> drift inward {{only by the}} P-R effect, {{the flux}} of the particles is inversely proportional to {{the distance from the}} sun. On the contrary, the radial profiles of dust flux measured by instruments on board spacecraft are relatively flat at 10 – 50 AU for Voyager 1 / 2 and at 5 – 15 AU for Pioneer 10 / 11. This means that <b>dust</b> <b>particles</b> in these region must have suffered from other dynamical effect(s), one of which is possibly sublimation of their ice component. It is worthwhile noting that <b>dust</b> <b>particles</b> with radius st make the largest contribution to the flux. <b>Dust</b> <b>particles</b> of initially s = st, however, become undetected during ice sublimation, since their sizes are reduced to s < st. We expect the flux of <b>dust</b> <b>particles</b> measured by spacecraft to decrease in the sublimation zone owing to a lack of these particles with initial radius st. Nevertheless, the presence of a refractory core in the particles does not necessarily result in a considerable reduction of their flux at the sublimation zone. In our model, the flux of EKB <b>dust</b> <b>particles</b> shows a bump around {{the outer edge of the}} sublimation zone. The smaller the threshold radius of detection is, the larger the heliocentric distance of a bump in the flux is. As we found, a bump in the model flux of <b>dust</b> <b>particles</b> appears at a heliocentric distance where a roughly constant flux of <b>dust</b> <b>particles</b> was measured. We conclude that the flat profile of the measured dust flux may be caused by ice sublimation of EKB <b>dust</b> <b>particles.</b>|$|R

40|$|Dynamics of <b>dust</b> <b>particles</b> in a {{divertor}} plasma is simulated using numerical solutions of dust {{momentum and}} charging equations in an electrostatic sheath and an ionizing presheath, where an electrostatic force and a drag force due to absorption of plasma ions {{are taken into}} account. Spatial distributions of plasma parameters in a divertor are obtained with particle simulations including ionization by electron-impact. We found that the critical dust radius exists. <b>Dust</b> <b>particles</b> with a larger radius than this critical one are incapable to come off a divertor plate because the ion drag force is stronger compared to the electrostatic force. Control of the plate potential can suppress the dust motion from the plate. The radii of heavy <b>dust</b> <b>particles</b> are classified with respect to equilibrium positions. Considering <b>dust</b> <b>particles</b> started at the plate with radii smaller than the critical one, two types of dust motion were found. <b>Dust</b> <b>particles</b> with the first type of motion {{come back to the}} plate before approaching their equilibrium positions.

30|$|In-situ data on {{the flux}} of <b>dust</b> <b>particles</b> in {{the outer solar system}} put {{constraints}} on the dynamical evolution and production rate of the particles. Furthermore, these constraints would give new insights into the physical properties of EKB <b>dust</b> <b>particles</b> and the collisional processing of EKBO surfaces. Pioneer 10 / 11 measured a flux of 10 - 10 – 10 - 9 cm- 2 s- 1 at 1 – 20 AU through pressurized cells whose pressure loss indicate dust impacts (Humes, 1980). Voyager 1 / 2 detected <b>dust</b> <b>particles</b> with a much higher flux of 10 - 8 – 10 - 7 cm- 2 s- 1 at 10 – 50 AU through abrupt changes of voltage detected by antenna elements (Gurnett et al., 1997). We expect the difference of the fluxes measured by these spacecraft may be explained by the size distribution of <b>dust</b> <b>particles</b> drifting from the EKB because the spacecraft have different detection size threshold. It turned out that the radial profiles of the fluxes are nearly flat at 10 – 50 AU for Voyager 1 / 2 and 5 – 15 AU for Pioneer 10 / 11. In contrast, the flux of <b>dust</b> <b>particles</b> controlled by radiation forces is inversely proportional to the heliocentric distance. Therefore, the flat profile implies that <b>dust</b> <b>particles</b> are affected by other dynamical effects. It is natural to expect that EKB <b>dust</b> <b>particles</b> are mainly composed of ices together with refractory carbonaceous materials. If such icy <b>dust</b> <b>particles</b> drift inward by the P-R effect, the ice component in the particles intensively sublimes when their temperatures become about 100 K (Kobayashi et al., 2008). Small icy <b>dust</b> <b>particles</b> of micrometer sizes actively sublime at 20 – 40 AU, while large <b>dust</b> <b>particles</b> sublime at smaller distances. This sizedependence {{comes from the fact that}} smaller <b>dust</b> <b>particles</b> have higher temperatures in the dust sizes (≳ 1 μm) we concern, owing to their lower emissivity. The locations of flat profiles in the measured fluxes may be explained by the difference in the size threshold of the instruments, because the locations coincide with heliocentric distances where <b>dust</b> <b>particles</b> of the threshold size actively sublime. When ice sublimes, some <b>dust</b> <b>particles</b> become smaller than the threshold of dust detection by the spacecraft, resulting in a decrease in the number of <b>dust</b> <b>particles</b> measured by the spacecraft. However, refractory grains encased in icy materials would sustain the detection to some extent in the ice sublimation zone as long as they drift inward by the P-R effect. This chain of events would prevents increasing fluxes with decreasing distance, which may form a relatively flat profile in the radial distribution of the flux. We propose ice sublimation to explain the flat profile in the fluxes measured by Pioneer and Voyager spacecraft.|$|R
