5|$|Dementia, and {{specifically}} Alzheimer's disease, may {{be among the}} most costly diseases for society in Europe and the United States, while their costs in other countries such as Argentina, and South Korea, are also high and rising. These costs will probably increase with the ageing of society, becoming an important social problem. AD-associated costs include direct medical costs such as nursing home care, direct nonmedical costs such as in-home <b>day</b> <b>care,</b> <b>and</b> indirect costs such as lost productivity of both patient and caregiver. Numbers vary between studies but dementia costs worldwide have been calculated around $160billion, while costs of Alzheimer's disease in the United States may be $100billion each year.|$|E
5|$|Historically, UM {{regulated}} {{female student}} conduct more than men's conduct {{with a staff}} under the Dean of Women watching over the women. UM combined the separate Dean of Men and Dean of Women positions in 1971. In 1971, UM formed a Women's Commission which issued a 1974 report {{on the status of}} women on campus. The result was UM's first female commencement speaker, <b>day</b> <b>care,</b> <b>and</b> a Women's Study minor. Following the enactment of Title IX in 1972, and decades of litigation, all organizations, including honorary societies were open to women. The Women's Commission also sought more equitable funding for women's sports. Terry Williams Munz became the first woman in America awarded an athletic scholarship when she accepted a golf scholarship from UM in 1973.|$|E

In order to avoid sending their children to other small communities in the area, Kibbutz children's houses and Kindergartens began accepting children from nearby Yokneam Illit, and in some cases the number of children from Yokneam Illit outnumbered the Kibbutz children. This phenomenon later extended to the elementary and secondary schools until the building of new schools in Yokneam Illit was able to catch up with demand.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{advances}} {{a framework}} for conceptualizing the professional status of <b>day</b> <b>care</b> personnel <b>and</b> describes training options for such personnel. The conceptual framework consists of a historical review of <b>day</b> <b>care</b> providers <b>and</b> discussions of the desirability of the service provided by <b>day</b> <b>care</b> centers <b>and</b> the knowledge base required of <b>day</b> <b>care</b> personnel. The discussion aims to provide a perspective for understanding {{the current status of}} <b>day</b> <b>care</b> personnel <b>and</b> the dilemmas surrounding current training options. It also highlights the complexity of the <b>day</b> <b>care</b> system <b>and</b> the impossibility of finding easy answers to the problem of staff training and certification. The four approaches to the training of <b>day</b> <b>care</b> personnel reviewed are: (1) in-service training programs; (2) competency-based training models; (3) baccalaureate training programs; and (3) community college diploma or certificate programs. While each of the training options has different professional status implications, the lack of specificity which exists in most state or provincial regulations does not ensure any differentiation in job role, status, or pay, for levels of training. To date, there is little direct evidence of the impact of different content and levels of training on staff behavior or developmental ol&comes for children. There are 111 citations.

25|$|A {{number of}} markets are {{considered}} historic places. The Abelardo L. Rodriguez Market {{is located in}} the historic center of Mexico City, just northeast of the main plaza, or Zocalo. It was built in 1934 as a prototype for a more modern marketplace and has a number of unusual features such as <b>day</b> <b>care</b> <b>and</b> an auditorium. However, the markets most distinctive feature is the approximately 1,450 square meters of wall and ceiling space covered in murals. These murals were painted by students of Diego Rivera and under his supervision. The works mostly reflect socialist themes, such as the exploitation of workers, peasants and miners, the fight against Nazism and fascism, and racial discrimination. Earthquakes, time, humidity and vandalism took their toll on the murals from the time they were painted. Restoration of the murals began in 2009.|$|E
25|$|Multiple {{colleges and}} {{universities}} have historically had connections to the YMCA. Springfield College, of Springfield, Massachusetts, was founded in 1885 as an international training school for YMCA Professionals, while one of the two schools that eventually became Concordia University—Sir George Williams College—started from night courses offered at the Montreal YMCA. Northeastern University began out of a YMCA in Boston, and Franklin University began as the YMCA School of Commerce. San Francisco's Golden Gate University traces its roots to the founding of the YMCA Night School on 1 November 1881. Detroit College of Law, now the Michigan State University College of Law, was founded with a strong connection to the Detroit, Michigan YMCA. It had a 99-year lease on the site, and it was only when it expired that the college moved to East Lansing, Michigan. Youngstown State University traces its roots to the establishment of a law school by the local YMCA in 1908. The Nashville School of Law was the YMCA Night Law School until November 1986, having offered law classes since 1911 and the degree of Jurist Doctor since January 1927. YMCA pioneered the concept of , providing educational opportunities for people with full-time employment. Many YMCAs offer ESL programmes, alternative high school, <b>day</b> <b>care,</b> <b>and</b> summer camp programs. In India, YMCA University of Science and Technology Faridabad was founded in 1969. It offers various programme-related to science and engineering.|$|E

500|$|The Baird case {{became the}} first {{national}} scandal over child-care arrangements, but the situation that these nominees faced was in part at least a common one to Americans. [...] Two-thirds of American women with school-age children were in the workforce and three-fifths of married men with children had working wives. [...] They all needed some form of <b>day</b> <b>care,</b> <b>and</b> with there being no organized or subsidized day care system in the U.S., many families turned to arrangements within the underground economy. [...] That this administration ran into this problem was considered ironic, given that Bill and Hillary Clinton were the first dual-career couple to occupy the White House.|$|E
500|$|Bowlby's {{work was}} misinterpreted {{to mean that}} any {{separation}} from the natural mother, any experience of institutional care or a multiplicity of [...] "mothers" [...] necessarily resulted in severe emotional deprivation and sometimes, that all children undergoing such experiences would develop into [...] "affectionless children". As a consequence it was claimed that only 24-hour care by the same person (the mother) was good enough, <b>day</b> <b>care</b> <b>and</b> nurseries were not good enough and mothers should not go out to work. The WHO advised that day nurseries and creches could have a serious and permanent deleterious effect. Such strictures suited the policies of governments concerned about finding employment for returned and returning servicemen after World War II. In fact, although Bowlby was of the view that proper care could not be provided [...] "by roster", he was also of the view that babies should be accustomed to regular periods of care by another and {{that the key to}} alternative care for working mothers was that it should be regular and continuous. He addressed this point in a 1958 publication called Can I Leave My Baby?. Ainsworth in the WHO 1962 publication also attempted to address this misapprehension by pointing out that the requirement for continuity of care did not imply an exclusive mother–child pair relationship.|$|E
