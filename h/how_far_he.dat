500|$|Conscious of {{the need}} to improve after his {{uncertain}} start to first-class cricket, Hammond scored his maiden first-class century in the first match of the 1923 season, making 110 and 92 opening the batting against Surrey. He did not reach three figures again that season, but his performances and batting technique impressed several critics, such as cricket correspondent Neville Cardus, former England and Middlesex captain Plum Warner, and The Times correspondent; Cardus described him as a future England player. In all first-class matches that season, Hammond scored 1,421 runs at an average of 27.86. With the ball, he took 18 first-class wickets at an average of 41.22, including figures of six for 59 against Hampshire.

Leaders were given briefings about the need to be [...] "severe" [...] and [...] "firm"; all Jews were to be viewed as potential enemies that had to be dealt with ruthlessly.

500|$|According to Oborne, Vorster was {{a pragmatic}} {{politician}} {{who wanted to}} maintain apartheid {{and to make it}} appear acceptable to the outside world. To this end, attempting to broaden South Africa's international connections, he accepted black foreign diplomats in the country and began to plan a policy to allow mixed-race sport to prevent South Africa's international isolation. However, such policies were unpopular with his domestic supporters and he was careful not to go too far. Oborne writes: [...] "Vorster knew that there was a limit to <b>how</b> <b>far</b> <b>he</b> could go without imperilling his own position. That limit was Basil D'Oliveira." [...] According to Oborne, Vorster never intended to allow D'Oliveira to play with the MCC team; his supporters would not have accepted a non-white South African benefiting from this change of policy and demonstrating his ability at a high level. Vorster therefore worked to give the impression overseas that D'Oliveira would be welcome, {{while at the same time}} doing his utmost to stop him from playing. He courted the British ambassador, Sir John Nicholls, and told him that a tour party including D'Oliveira would be acceptable. Nicholls passed this on to the UK government. Vorster meanwhile monitored D'Oliveira's progress closely; from his debut in 1966, South Africa kept a security file on him.|$|E
500|$|In recent years, {{the words}} of the hymn have been changed in some {{religious}} publications to downplay a sense of imposed self-loathing by its singers. The second line, [...] "That saved a wretch like me!" [...] has been rewritten as [...] "That saved and strengthened me", [...] "save a soul like me", or [...] "that saved and set me free". Kathleen Norris in her book Amazing Grace: A Vocabulary of Faith characterizes this transformation of the original words as [...] "wretched English" [...] making the line that replaces the original [...] "laughably bland". Part of the reason for this change has been the altered interpretations of what wretchedness and grace means. Newton's Calvinistic view of redemption and divine grace formed his perspective that he considered himself a sinner so vile that he was unable to change his life or be redeemed without God's help. Yet his lyrical subtlety, in Steve Turner's opinion, leaves the hymn's meaning open to a variety of Christian and non-Christian interpretations. [...] "Wretch" [...] also represents a period in Newton's life when he saw himself outcast and miserable, as he was when he was enslaved in Sierra Leone; his own arrogance was matched by <b>how</b> <b>far</b> <b>he</b> had fallen in his life.|$|E
