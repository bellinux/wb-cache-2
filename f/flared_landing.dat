A combined aerodynamic-structural analysis is made {{which is based on}} the assumption that the sail is flexible and has freedom to make the shape which the aerodynamic pressure and the internal stresses dictate.

The assumptions are also made that the booms are rigid and straight and that they have small enough cross sections so as not to affect the aerodynamics. The boom are maintained a fixed distance apart by spreader bars, and the dihedral of the leading-edge booms is fixed with respect to the keel boom. The aerodynamic theory used is Newtonian theory, which has sometimes been used to express the aerodynamic pressure-shape relationship for the hypersonic speed range. Numerical results are presented to show effects of variation in dihedral angle (raising or lowering of the leading-edge booms) ...|$|E

40|$|The Active Gear, Flexible Aircraft Takeoff and Landing Analysis program, AGFATL, was {{developed}} to provide a complete simulation of the aircraft takeoff and landing dynamics problem. AGFATL can represent an airplane either as a rigid body with {{six degrees of freedom}} or as a flexible body with multiple degrees of freedom. The airframe flexibility is represented by the superposition of up to twenty free vibration modes on the rigid-body motions. The analysis includes maneuver logic and autopilots programmed to control the aircraft during glide slope, <b>flare,</b> <b>landing,</b> and takeoff. The program is modular so that performance of the aircraft in flight and during landing and ground maneuvers can be studied separately or in combination. A program restart capability is included in AGFATL. Effects simulated in the AGFATL program include: (1) flexible aircraft control and performance during glide slope, <b>flare,</b> <b>landing</b> roll, and takeoff roll under conditions of changing winds, engine failures, brake failures, control system failures, strut failures, restrictions due to runway length, and control variable limits and time lags; (2) landing gear loads and dynamics for up to five gears; (3) single and multiple engines (maximum of four) including selective engine reversing and failure; (4) drag chute and spoiler effects; (5) wheel braking (including skid-control) and selective brake failure; (6) aerodynamic ground effects; (7) aircraft carrier operations; (8) inclined runways and runway perturbations; (9) flexible or rigid airframes; 10) rudder and nose gear steering; and 11) actively controlled landing gear shock struts. Input to the AGFATL program includes data which describe runway roughness; vehicle geometry, flexibility and aerodynamic characteristics; landing gear(s); propulsion; and initial conditions such as attitude, attitude change rates, and velocities. AGFATL performs a time integration of the equations of motion and outputs comprehensive information on the airframe, state-of-maneuver logic, autopilots, control response, and aircraft loads from impact, runway roll-out, and ground operations. Flexible-body and total (elastic plus rigid-body) displacements, velocities, and accelerations are also output in the flexible-body option for up to twenty points on the aircraft. The AGFATL program is written in FORTRAN IV for batch execution and has been implemented on a CDC CYBER 170 series computer with an overlayed central memory requirement of approximately 141 (octal) of 60 bit words.
