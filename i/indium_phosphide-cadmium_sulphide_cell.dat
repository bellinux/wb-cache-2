40|$|The gamma-ray {{irradiation}} {{effects of}} lead <b>sulphide</b> photoconductive <b>cell</b> {{have been obtained}} experimentally. The gamma-ray source used was 10000 curie Cobalt- 60,and total irradiation dose was 10 ^ 7 roentgen ～ 10 ^ 8 roentgen. The irradiation was carried out at room temperature. The results obtained are summarized as follows : (1) Coloring of the cell vessel due to the gamma-ray irradiation does not deteriorate {{the characteristics of the}} lead <b>sulphide</b> photoconductive <b>cell</b> as a near infrared detector to any appreciable degree. (2) Decrease in dark impedance of the cell due to the gamma-ray irradiation shows only a slight recovery. (3) Value of the activation energy is changed by the gamma-ray irradiation. (4) Dark current is increased, photocurrent is decreased and time constant is also decreased. Increase in dark current is due to the decrease in dark impedance of the cell, and shows little recovery. The cause of the decrease in photocurrent and time constant may be the formation of current carrier recombination centers created by the gamma-ray irradiation. (5) Current noise is increased by the gamma-ray irradiation, but recovers almost completely. Photocurrent and time constant also recover almost completely. (6) The time needed for the complete recovery of the cell photoelectric characteristics seems to be proportional to the irradiation dose. (7) From the results obtained above, it may by concluded that the lead <b>sulphide</b> photoconductive <b>cell</b> is not damaged so easily by the gamma-ray irradiation dose which was used in this experiment...|$|R
40|$|Lithium iron {{sulphide}} {{has been investigated}} as a low-cost, high energy density and relatively safe positive electrode material for secondary lithium batteries. Lithium {{iron sulphide}} was synthesised, characterised and compared with natural pyrite samples and was shown to have a capacity of 350 mAh. g- 1 upon cycling between 1. 45 and 2. 80 V vs. Li. The capacity was attributed to the Fe 2 +/Fe 3 + redox couple at potentials up to 2. 55 V, and oxidation of sulphur sites from Fe 3 +(S 2 -) 2 to Fe 3 +S 2 -(S 2) 2 - 0. 5 up to 2. 80 V. The cycle life performance of lithium iron sulphide is poor when the cell is cycled between 1. 45 and 2. 80 V, with the cell loosing approximately 1. 4 mAh. g- 1 per cycle, although this performance is superior to comparable pyrite electrodes. Calcium doped samples of lithium iron sulphide were synthesised. Calcium doping was shown to impact upon lithium transport properties of the bulk lithium iron sulphide, improving the rate performance of the material. Improvements in cycle life performance of the calcium doped samples were offset by decreased specific capacity due to lithium substitution. The poor cycle life performance of lithium iron <b>sulphide</b> <b>cells</b> was attributed to the utilisation of the high voltage plateau corresponding to sulphur site oxidation/reduction. Experiments utilising a variety of negative electrode materials has identified the formation of soluble polysulphide species upon cycling of the cell, which reduce irreversibly at the negative electrode, contributing to active mass loss and poor cycle life performance. In-situ XRD studies have highlighted the structural decomposition that occurs upon utilisation of the sulphide, which results in irreversible amorphisation of the lithium iron sulphide crystal structure. Lithium iron sulphide was treated via coating with lithium boron oxide glass and a novel carbon coating method via thermal decomposition of butyl-methyl-pyrrolydinium-dicyanimide. Both treatments were shown to increase the cycle life performance of lithium iron sulphide, due to decreased dissolution of polysulphide upon cycling. The choice of binder, electrode formulation and electrolyte was also shown to impact upon the cycle life performance of lithium iron <b>sulphide</b> <b>cells...</b>|$|R

Optical density is expressed as electrical resistance in the circuit connected with the cadmium cell. Harris, Lewis & Silva, 1967) and in vitro (Mendez-Bauer, Cabot & Caldeyro-Barcia, 1960; Rydł=e' & Sjł=o", 1962; Moore & Zarrow, 1965). It is generally accepted that this tissue is more selective than any other mammalian tissue currently used. The recently developed method of van Dongen & Hays (1966) for assaying oxytocin on rat mammary gland tissue in vitro is the most sensitive method so far devised. In this method {{the time of the}} beginning of milk expulsion is measured by means of microscopical observation of minute pieces of rat mammary gland. In our experience, however, the precision of this method is not suitable for quantitative measurements of relatively small changes of the oxytocin level in blood. In an attempt to measure the microscopically observed milk expulsion more objectively we have designed a device for measuring changes in light penetration through rat mammary gland slices. It consists of a cadmium <b>sulphide</b> photoelectric <b>cell,</b> a light source, a Wheatstone bridge and a pen recorder. The mammary tissue is placed in a small chamber continuously perfused with a solution of the following composition (g. /l. distille...|$|R
40|$|A L 8 {{matrix of}} {{experiments}} {{has been carried}} out to investigate various deposition parameters of Cadmium telluride (CdTe) /Cadmium <b>sulphide</b> (CdS) solar <b>cells</b> grown using metal organic chemical vapour deposition (MOCVD). The results of the matrix were analysed using a criterion to establish which growth parameters are significant and warrant further investigation. The most significant parameters were CdTe growth temperature and in situ arsenic doping of the CdTe absorber layer. Characterisation of the device structures showed that CdTe grain enlargement from 1 μm to ∼ 3 μm occurred at the higher CdTe deposition temperature of 390 °C. SIMS depth profiles verified that arsenic concentrations, within the device structures, of 2. 5 × 1018 and 2 × 1019 atoms cm− 3 were achieved for the different partial pressures. A model for the behaviour of arsenic in polycrystalline CdTe material, based on only partial passivation of grain boundaries and saturation of the grain boundaries at As concentrations above > 2. 5 × 1018 atoms cm− 3 is presented and discussed...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Bacterial biofilms pose {{significant}} {{food safety}} risks {{because of their}} attachment to fomites and food surfaces, including fresh produce surfaces. The {{purpose of this study}} was to systematically investigate the activity of selected antimicrobials on Campylobacter jejuni biofilms. Methods: C. jejuni biofilms and planktonic cells were treated with ciprofloxacin, erythromycin and diallyl sulphide and examined using infrared and Raman spectroscopies coupled with imaging analysis. Results: Diallyl <b>sulphide</b> eliminated planktonic <b>cells</b> and sessile cells in biofilms at a concentration that was at least 100 -fold less than used for either ciprofloxacin or erythromycin on the basis of molarity. Distinct cell lysis was observed in diallyl sulphide-treated planktonic cells using immunoblot analysis and was confirmed by a rapid decrease in cellular ATP. Two phases of C. jejuni biofilm recalcitrance modes against ciprofloxacin and erythromycin were validated using vibrational spectroscopies: (i) an initial hindered adsorption into biofilm extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) and delivery of antibiotics to sessile cells within biofilms; and (ii) a different interaction between sessile cells in a biofilm compared with their planktonic counterparts. Diallyl sulphide destroyed the EPS structure of the C. jejuni biofilm, after which the sessile cells were killed in a similar manner as planktonic cells. Spectroscopic models can predict the survival of sessile cells within biofilms. Conclusions: Diallyl sulphide elicits strong antimicrobial activity against planktonic and sessile C. jejuni and ma...|$|R
40|$|Ulcerative colitis is {{associated}} with a selective reduction of n-butyrate oxidation by the colonic epithelial cells although the reason for this has been unclear. Colonic epithelial cell n-butyrate oxidation can be inhibited in vitro by incubation with sulphide but the role of mucosal detoxification of sulphide in the metabolic welfare of the colonic mucosa has not been examined. This study aimed to assess the role mucosal detoxification of sulphide by thiolmethyltransferase (TMT) -mediated methylation may play in protecting the healthy colonic mucosa from the adverse effects of luminal <b>sulphide.</b> Colonic epithelial <b>cell</b> suspensions from healthy human proximal (n = 9) and distal colon (n = 10) were incubated in the presence of 14 C-labelled n-butyrate (5 mmol/L) alone, butyrate plus sodium hydrogen sulphide (NaHS) (1. 5 mmol/L), or butyrate plus NaHS plus S-adenosyl-methionine 1, 4 butane disulphonate (SAMe) (5 mmol/L). Study end points were metabolic performance (14 CO 2 production) and mucosal TMT activity. Incubation with NaHS induced a significant inhibition of 14 CO 2 production compared with control incubations (P < 0. 001) which was similar for proximal and distal colonic cell suspensions. S-adenosyl-methionine 1, 4 butane disulphonate reversed this effect completely in proximal but not in distal cell incubations, suggesting a greater susceptibility of the distal colon to the sulphide effect. Although median whole mucosal TMT values did not differ between proximal and distal colonic mucosa, a non-normal distribution of distal TMT values was observed. However, neither the degree of sulphide inhibition of control 14 CO 2 production nor the degree to which SAMe reversed this inhibition correlated with whole mucosal TMT activity. The study concluded that regional variation exists in TMT activity in the human colon but whilst methylation appears to protect colonic epithelial cells against sulphide-induced inhibition of n-butyrate oxidation, this cannot be directly correlated with mucosal TMT activity.
