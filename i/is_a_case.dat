5|$|Food {{politics}} in Africa {{differs from the}} cases in North America and Europe in that there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> of small scale food power in Africa, particularly in Sudan. Some experts say that the cases of famine and food insecurity in Africa are due to inconsistent output of food production and the downward spiral {{of the interaction between}} population growth and environmental sustainability. But upon closer inspection, it is revealed that nature is not the only catalyst for Africa’s numerous food insecurity issues.|$|E
5|$|Jacobson v. United States, 503 U.S. 540 (1992), <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> {{decided by}} the United States Supreme Court {{regarding}} the criminal procedure topic of entrapment. A narrowly divided court overturned the conviction of a Nebraska man for receiving child pornography through the mail, ruling that postal inspectors had implanted a desire to do so through repeated written entreaties.|$|E
5|$|Another {{analogous}} case {{within a}} single species has been termed Browerian mimicry (after Lincoln P. Brower and Jane Van Zandt Brower). This <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> of bipolar (only two species involved) automimicry; the model is the same species as its mimic. Equivalent to Batesian mimicry {{within a single}} species, it occurs {{when there is a}} palatability spectrum within a population of harmful prey. For example, monarch (Danaus plexippus) caterpillars feed on milkweed species of varying toxicity. Some feed on more toxic plants, and store these toxins within themselves. The more palatable caterpillars thus profit from the more toxic members of the same species.|$|E

5|$|Batesian mimicry <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> of {{protective}} or defensive mimicry, where the mimic does best by avoiding confrontations with the signal receiver. It is a disjunct system, {{which means that}} all three parties are from different species. Batesian mimicry stands in contrast to other forms such as aggressive mimicry, where the mimic profits from interactions with the signal receiver. One such case of this is in fireflies, where females of one species mimic the mating signals of another species, deceiving males to come close {{enough for them to}} eat. Mimicry need not involve a predator at all though. Such is the case in dispersal mimicry, where the mimic once again benefits from the encounter. For instance, some fungi have their spores dispersed by insects by smelling like carrion. In protective mimicry, the meeting between mimic and dupe is not such a fortuitous occasion for the mimic, and the signals it mimics tend to lower the probability of such an encounter.|$|E
5|$|Glik v. Cunniffe, 655 F.3d 78 (1st Cir. 2011) <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> {{in which}} the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit held that a private citizen {{has the right to}} record video and audio of public {{officials}} in a public place, and that the arrest of the citizen for a wiretapping violation violated his First and Fourth Amendment rights. The case arose when Simon Glik, a private citizen, filmed Boston, Massachusetts, police officers making an arrest in a public park. When the officers observed that Glik was recording the arrest, they arrested him and he was subsequently charged with wiretapping, disturbing the peace, and aiding in the escape of a prisoner. Glik then sued the City of Boston and the arresting officers, claiming that they violated his constitutional rights.|$|E
5|$|Recently, it {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the Bouba/Kiki phenomenon <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> of ideasthesia. Most people will agree that the star-shaped object on the left is named Kiki and the round one on the right Bouba. It has been assumed that these associations come from direct connections between visual and auditory cortices. For example, according to that hypothesis, representations of sharp inflections in the star-shaped object would be physically connected to the representations of sharp inflection in the sound of Kiki. However, Gomez et al. have shown that Kiki/Bouba associations are much richer as either word and either image is associated semantically to a number of concepts such as white or black color, feminine vs. masculine, cold vs. hot, and others. These sound-shape associations seem to be related through a large overlap between semantic networks of Kiki and star-shape on one hand, and Bouba and round-shape on the other hand. For example, both Kiki and star-shape are clever, small, thin and nervous. This indicates that behind Kiki-Bouba effect lies a rich semantic network. In other words, our sensory experience is largely determined by the meaning that we assign to stimuli. Food description and wine tasting is another domain in which ideasthetic association between flavor and other modalities such as shape may play an important role.|$|E
