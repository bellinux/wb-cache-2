5|$|William Foster and William Eddy, both {{survivors}} of the snowshoe party, started from Bear Valley to intercept Reed, taking with them a man named John Stark. After one day, they met Reed helping his children, all frostbitten and bleeding but alive. Desperate to rescue their own children, Foster and Eddy persuaded four men, with pleading and money, to return to Truckee Lake with them. Halfway there they found the crudely mutilated and eaten remains of two children and Mrs. Graves, with one-year-old Elizabeth Graves crying beside her mother's body. Eleven survivors were <b>huddled</b> <b>around</b> a fire that had sunk into a pit. The relief party split, with Foster, Eddy, and two others headed toward Truckee Lake. Two rescuers, hoping to save the healthiest, each took a child and left. John Stark refused to leave the others. Stark picked up two children and all the provisions, and assisted the nine remaining Breens and Graveses to Bear Valley.|$|E
25|$|At about 1:30 am, the 38th Army and the 15th Airborne Corps {{arrived at}} {{the north and south}} ends of the Square respectively. The 14th Artillery Division had reached the Museum of Chinese History, {{on the east side of}} the Square, at 12:15 am. The 27th and 65th Armies spilled out of the Great Hall of the People on the west side of the Square. The 63rd Army held the east side of the Square. The 24th, 39th, 54th Armies and the 14th Artillery Division {{controlled}} the perimeter of the Square, and by 2 am, the encirclement was complete. Crowds trying to re-enter the Square from East Chang'an Avenue were driven off by gunfire. At the time, several thousand students remained <b>huddled</b> <b>around</b> the Monument to the People's Heroes inside the Square.|$|E
25|$|The Buccaneers and Panthers met for {{the first}} time this season, with first place in the NFC South on the line. Carolina {{starting}} quarterback Jake Delhomme sat out the game with an elbow injury, and was replaced by David Carr. The Buccaneer offense started the game with an exhausting, 11-play, 71-yard drive, capped off by a 3-yard scramble by Jeff Garcia for a touchdown. With 3 minutes left in the first quarter, running back Carnell Williams blasted down the field for an 18-yard run, but his right leg buckled, seriously injuring his knee. As he was being carted off the field, nearly the entire Buccaneers team, along with several Panthers players, <b>huddled</b> <b>around</b> Williams in support. After the injury timeout, Earnest Graham salvaged the drive with a one-yard touchdown run. Tampa Bay extended their halftime lead to 17–0 after a Matt Bryant field goal, meanwhile, Carolina's offense was sputtering, blasted by the Buccaneers defense, who sacked Carr three times, and intercepeted him once. Carr completed only 19 of 41 pass attempts, and Carolina was facing their first shutout in five seasons. With 23 seconds left in regulation, Carolina finally got on the board with a touchdown pass to DeAngelo Williams. An onside kick was unsuccessful, and the Buccaneers won their third straight game.|$|E

500|$|Union {{inaction}} {{created the}} opportunity for the Confederates to attack first before Buell arrived. On the morning of April 6, 1862, Grant's troops were taken by surprise when the Confederates, led by Generals Albert Sidney Johnston and P.G.T. Beauregard, struck first [...] "like an Alpine avalanche" [...] near Shiloh church, attacking five divisions of Grant's army and forcing a confused retreat toward the Tennessee River. Johnston was wounded and died during the engagement and command fell upon Beauregard. One Union line held the Confederate attack off for several hours at a place later called the [...] "Hornet's Nest", giving Grant time to assemble artillery and 20,000 troops near Pittsburg Landing. The Confederates finally broke through the Hornet's Nest to capture a Union division, but [...] "Grant's Last Line" [...] held Pittsburg Landing, while the exhausted Confederates, lacking reinforcements, halted their advance. That evening, heavy rain set in while Grant and his staff took cover and <b>huddled</b> <b>around</b> a fire. When asked by McPherson {{if he was going}} to retreat, Grant replied, [...] "Retreat? No. I propose to attack them at daylight and whip them." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{band of the}} Milky Way {{goes through}} Canis Major, with only patchy obscurement by {{interstellar}} dust clouds. It is bright in the northeastern corner of the constellation, {{as well as in}} a triangular area between Adhara, Wezen and Aludra, with many stars visible in binoculars. Canis Major boasts several open clusters. The only Messier object is M41 (NGC 2287), an open cluster with a combined visual magnitude of 4.5, around 2300 light-years from Earth. Located 4 degrees south of Sirius, it contains contrasting blue, yellow and orange stars and covers an area the apparent size of the full moon—in reality around 25 light-years in diameter. Its most luminous stars have already evolved into giants. The brightest is a 6.3-magnitude star of spectral type K3. Located in the field is 12 Canis Majoris, though this star is only 670 light-years distant. NGC 2360, known as Caroline's Cluster after its discoverer Caroline Herschel, is an open cluster located 3.5 degrees west of Muliphein and has a combined apparent magnitude of 7.2. Around 15 light-years in diameter, it is located 3700 light-years away from Earth, and has been dated to around 2.2 billion years old. NGC 2362 is a small, compact open cluster, 5200 light-years from Earth. It contains about 60 stars, of which Tau Canis Majoris is the brightest member. Located around 3 degrees northeast of Wezen, it covers an area around 12 light-years in diameter, though the stars appear <b>huddled</b> <b>around</b> Tau when seen through binoculars. It is a very young open cluster as its member stars are only a few million years old. [...] Lying 2 degrees southwest of NGC 2362 is NGC 2354 a fainter open cluster of magnitude 6.5, with around 15 member stars visible with binoculars. Located around 30' northeast of NGC 2360, NGC 2359 (Thor's Helmet or the Duck Nebula) is a relatively bright emission nebula in Canis Major, with an approximate magnitude of 10, which is 10,000 light-years from Earth. The nebula is shaped by HD 56925, an unstable Wolf-Rayet star embedded within it.|$|E
500|$|The band members' {{main goal}} was to reinvent the group's sound from scratch, {{creating}} what Trohman called a [...] "reimagining of the band," [...] which focuses more on pop. Sessions were not without difficulties, as the band struggled initially to produce new material. Walker had doubts about the band's volatility, feeling the record would not get made following [...] "meltdown after meltdown." [...] The entire album was recorded in secrecy from the music industry, critics, and fans of the band. While specifically denying that the group's announcement was a reunion because [...] " [...] never broke up", the band announced a reunion tour and details of Save Rock and Roll on February 4, 2013. The quartet's announcement included {{a photo of the}} group that had been taken earlier that morning of the band members <b>huddled</b> <b>around</b> a bonfire tossing copies of their back catalog into flames at the original location of Comiskey Park, the location of 1979's Disco Demolition Night, a baseball promotional event which involved destroying disco records. A message on the group's website read [...] "when we were kids the only thing that got us through most days was music. It's why we started Fall Out Boy in the first place. This isn't a reunion because we never broke up. We needed to plug back in and make some music that matters to us. The future of Fall Out Boy starts now. Save rock and roll..." [...] Save Rock and Roll debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 chart, with first week sales of 154,000 copies in the United States, according to Nielsen SoundScan. The arrival of Save Rock and Roll posted the quartet's third-biggest sales week, and earned the group's second career number one on the chart. The band's chart success was best described as unexpected by music journalists. Rolling Stone called the band's comeback a [...] "rather stunning renaissance", and Entertainment Weekly called the number one a [...] "major accomplishment for a band whom many in the industry had dismissed as kings of a genre whose time had passed." ...|$|E

60|$|The English, {{from the}} great {{prevalence}} of rural habits throughout every class of society, have always been fond of those festivals and holidays which agreeably interrupt the stillness of country life; and they were, in former days, particularly observant of the religious and social rites of Christmas. It is inspiring to read even the dry details which some antiquarians have given of the quaint humours, the burlesque pageants, the complete abandonment to mirth and good-fellowship with which this festival was celebrated. It seemed to throw open every door, and unlock every heart. It brought the peasant and the peer together, and blended all ranks in one warm generous flow of joy and kindness.
