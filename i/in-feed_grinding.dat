40|$|The general {{characteristic}} of the closed-loop T-system of round <b>in-feed</b> <b>grinding</b> is determined and its function is magnitude of actual metal removal. The specified characteristic as the uniform index characterises rigidity of T-system and cutting ability of a grinding wheel in aggregate. Possibility of experimental definition of the general {{characteristic of}} the closed-loop T-system is considered, and this allows to increase accuracy of working cycle calculation during technical normalization of circular grinding operations.

30|$|Various {{applications}} of equation (1.1) and its generalizations can be found, for example, {{in the theory}} of self-excited oscillations, in oscillation processes in a vacuum tube, in dynamics of an auto-generator, in description of processes of <b>in-feed</b> <b>grinding</b> and cutting (see [1]); on position control in mechanical engineering, on electromechanical systems, and on combustion engines [2]. The problem of stabilizing the rolling of a ship by the activated tanks method in which ballast water is pumped from one position to another was reduced in [3] to analysis of stability of the second order delay equation.|$|E
40|$|In {{production}} engineering, {{monitoring of}} the grinding process is critical for acquiring information on material removal, wheel performance, and workpiece quality. Here, a general model of the power signal and material removal rate is proposed to monitor the internal plunge grinding of a bearing outer race way product. Three continuous grinding cycles after dressing were used to analyse the roughing, semi-finishing, finishing and spark-out process under the same parameters. Based on the actual grinding process, a practical analysis method is applied to improve the general model to predict more accurately the power curve. Finally, estimations of grinding wheel performance and grind quality using the grinding power signal model (GPSM) coefficients are also presented. The experimental {{results showed that the}} improved power signal model is capable of solving the industrial problem of multi-stage <b>in-feed</b> <b>grinding</b> cycles and improving grind quality...|$|E
40|$|<b>In-feed</b> {{centerless}} <b>grinding</b> technique {{offers a}} major {{contribution to the}} industries. This is the alternative <b>in-feed</b> centerless <b>grinding</b> technique using regulating wheel. Mainly centerless grinding is divided in three types, and those are End feed, in-feed and through feed Centerless grinding. This paper mainly deals with low cost automation on <b>in-feed</b> Centerless <b>grinding</b> machine using regulating wheel suitable for multiple in-feed type jobs. It deals {{with the development of}} a Centerless grinding automation technique for the job having multiple diameter, steps or projections on the job. In this new method of automation hydraulic cylinders, sensors besides a control panel, pressure gauge, and a hydraulic power pack added. Relay control is used for the electrical control. The objective of this work is to reduce the cycle time, consistency in the quality of job and to reduce the production cost. In this focus is concentrated on compact centerless grinding unit. The higher machining accuracy is obtained. Results showed improvement in the surface roughness and productivity of the job...|$|R
50|$|<b>In-feed</b> {{centerless}} <b>grinding</b> is used {{to grind}} workpieces with relatively complex shapes, such as an hourglass shape. Before the process begins, the workpiece is loaded manually into the grinding machine and the regulating wheel is moved into place. The complexity of the part shapes and grinding wheel shapes required to grind them accurately prevent the workpiece from being fed axially through the machine.|$|R
