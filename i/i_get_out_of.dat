500|$|When Stickells {{expressed}} concern that the arrest might jeopardize the concert that was scheduled for that night at Maple Leaf Gardens, the booking detective assured them that he would [...] "get it done as quickly" [...] as he could because his children had tickets for the event; he commented: [...] "they'll kill me if I don't get [...] out." [...] Management at the Gardens pressured the Toronto police department to release him, complaining that the sell-out crowd of 18,000 fans might riot if they canceled the show. He was released by 8 p.m. and escorted to the venue by the police, who remained at the arena throughout the performance. He displayed a jovial attitude during the concert, joking with the audience and singing in a mock operatic style for comedic effect.

He first played drums on [...] "Layla", [...] "White Room" [...] and [...] "She's Waiting" [...] for friend Eric Clapton. Then, Collins performed [...] "Against All Odds" [...] and [...] "In the Air Tonight", and finished the night playing drums for Led Zeppelin's aforementioned act. The band has claimed that the performance was unspectacular, and critics place the blame on Collins. However, Collins says that [...] "I would pledge to my dying day that it wasn't me," [...] and that Thompson was racing through some of the performance. Collins later remarked, [...] "... I remember in the middle of the thing, I actually thought, How do <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> here?"

2500|$|Originally, Pink {{wanted to}} call her album Heartbreak Is a Motherfucker, but her record label {{declined}} because of a fear that offensive language would affect sales. She also said {{that she did not}} want the album to look like a break-up album; [...] "There is a lot of that , but there is fun happening too and that's why I named it Funhouse in the end." [...] Pink has also stated that she sees life as a carnival: [...] "Clowns are supposed to be happy, but they are really scary. Carnivals are supposed to be fun, but really they are kind of creepy." [...] "and that's like life to me, and love. Love is supposed to be fun, but it can sometimes be really scary.
