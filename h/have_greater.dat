Results of a survey involving 892 students at two universities indicate that male faculty members are perceived as <b>having</b> <b>greater</b> expert power, while no gender differences exist on referent, reward and coercive power.

5|$|Analysis {{of the two}} {{combat system}} {{proposals}} saw Signaal fall out of favour with the tender reviewers. This was primarily attributed to a cost-reducing re-design late in the process: the changes were not fully documented because of time constraints.

In addition, the system proposed by Rockwell appeared to <b>have</b> <b>greater</b> performance capabilities, and would be cheaper to implement.|$|E

5|$|Personal traits such as age, gender, location, and {{education}} correlate, either positively or negatively, with HIV/AIDS awareness levels. For example, older women have demonstrated {{higher levels of}} knowledge regarding HIV/AIDS than younger women in Malawi. Because men typically <b>have</b> <b>greater</b> access to education and other social resources, they are often more knowledgeable about HIV prevention and transmission than women. While men are, on average, able to list 2.2 ways to prevent HIV transmission, women are only able to list 1.5 ways. Only 38% of women surveyed in 2003-2004 understood that their husbands {{would be less likely}} to contract HIV if they used condoms during intercourse with prostitutes and other women from high-risk groups. In addition, men who are raised in urban environments are, on average, more informed about HIV/AIDS than men who are raised in rural environments, presumably because urban children typically <b>have</b> <b>greater</b> access to educational resources than rural children. Among both men and women, higher levels of education correspond to increased knowledge about HIV/AIDS: men and women who have received secondary school educations are significantly more likely to understand complex aspects of the disease, such as the fact that people who appear healthy can still be HIV-positive, than those who have not. Finally, people who have lost friends or family members to the disease are likely to <b>have</b> <b>greater</b> knowledge about HIV/AIDS due to their personal, firsthand exposure to the problem.|$|E

5|$|Herd immunity, {{generated}} from previous exposure to cold viruses, {{plays an important}} role in limiting viral spread, as seen with younger populations that <b>have</b> <b>greater</b> rates of respiratory infections. Poor immune function is a risk factor for disease. Insufficient sleep and malnutrition have been associated with a greater risk of developing infection following rhinovirus exposure; this is believed to be due to their effects on immune function. Breast feeding decreases the risk of acute otitis media and lower respiratory tract infections among other diseases, and it is recommended that breast feeding be continued when an infant has a cold. In the developed world breast feeding may not be protective against the common cold in and of itself.|$|E
5|$|Impala are symbiotically {{related to}} oxpeckers, which feed on ticks from {{those parts of}} the antelope's body which the animal cannot access by itself (such as the ears, neck, eyelids, {{forehead}} and underbelly). The impala is the smallest ungulate with which oxpeckers are associated. In a study it was observed that oxpeckers selectively attended to impala despite the presence of other animals such as Coke's hartebeest, Grant's gazelle, Thompson's gazelle and topi. A possible explanation for this could be that because the impala inhabits woodlands (which can have a high density of ticks), the impala could <b>have</b> <b>greater</b> mass of ticks per unit area of the body surface. Another study showed that the oxpeckers prefer the ears over other parts of the body, probably because these parts show maximum tick infestation.|$|E
