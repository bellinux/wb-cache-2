40|$|Freeing Speech” {{contributes}} to the existing academic debate around the virtues and vices of {{freedom of information act}} (“FOIA”) requests, and specifically, to the much-discussed problem of judicial under-enforcement of both federal FOIA and state right-to-know law actions. <b>Freeing</b> <b>Speech</b> offers a new insight into this problem, which is that often courts simply do not see the First Amendment implications of these cases. The article coins the phrase promoting speech, and argues that this First Amendment value undergirds the entire right-to-know statutory scheme. Yet this value remains hidden in these cases, as adjudicating a right-to-know claim does not require a court to construe or apply the First Amendment. The piece argues that for courts to effectively adjudicate these requests, this must change. <b>Freeing</b> <b>Speech</b> is unique in part because it arose out of the author’s practice experience. In July 2016, the author represented, pro bono, a journalist seeking public records regarding the funding of the 2016 Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. A politically powerful group opposed the request. To order production over this group’s objection, the court hearing the request would have needed to see the First Amendment implications of the entire freedom of information act (or in this case, “right to know”) statutory scheme. The court did not see those implications, and thus <b>Freeing</b> <b>Speech</b> was born. <b>Freeing</b> <b>Speech</b> argues that, for courts to fully understand a statutory right to know case, courts first situate that case in its proper constitutional context. The Article argues that although Justice Brandeis recognized this constitutional value when he warned that public discussion of political issues was a “political duty,” Whitney v. California, 274 U. S. 357, 376 (1927) (Brandeis, J., concurring), that value has since been overshadowed by the more familiar value of protecting <b>speech.</b> <b>Freeing</b> <b>Speech</b> seeks to bring the value of promoting speech out of the shadow of the First Amendment...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{transformation}} of Flaubert’s <b>free</b> indirect <b>speech</b> in the film Madame Bovary by Claude Chabrol. Conversion of <b>free</b> indirect <b>speech</b> into direct speech or into narration by an external narrator (voice-over) cannot be avoided, it does, however, pose many problems {{because of the potential}} ambiguousness (polyphony) of <b>free</b> indirect <b>speech.</b> In such cases, Chabrol often finds effective solutions which bring the film closer to Flaubert’s style. Nevertheless, it remains clear that film adaptations of literary masterpieces entail serious losses. Therefore teachers must convince students that film adaptations of high-quality literature can never replace literary works themselves. Literature and film are two different media, based on distinct types of artistic expression, and should be presented as such to students. As a consequence, film adaptations of literary masterpieces should not uncritically be considered as the most suitable material in all teaching contexts.

For example, the reactionary, anti-Catholic, anti-black Ku Klux Klan (KKK) was a frequent target of ACLU efforts, but the ACLU defended the KKK's right to hold meetings in 1923.
