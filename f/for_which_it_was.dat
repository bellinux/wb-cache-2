5|$|Following {{the end of}} the First World War, {{sales of}} peat began to decline, as working horses were {{replaced}} by motor lorries and tractors. The British Moss Litter Company bought up two other companies who were extracting peat in Crowle Moor in 1935. Most peat was sold as bales, with 'fine' peat being used by gardeners and the growing of mushrooms and 'litter' being used for animal bedding, while 'tailings' were used for floor covering at show-jumping events and for bulking up feed for cows. Around one-fifth was not baled, and was used for various purposes, including the production of firelighters, for health cures at Harrogate baths, and the purifying of gas by gas companies, <b>for</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> mixed with iron ore at Creyke's Siding. By the late 1940s, it was finding a new market as litter for battery hen houses, and by then around 90 per cent was baled.|$|E

50|$|Equivalently, from a queue layout, {{one could}} process the edges {{in a single}} queue using a queue data structure, by {{considering}} the vertices in their given ordering, and when reaching a vertex, dequeueing all edges <b>for</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> the second endpoint followed by enqueueing all edges <b>for</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> the first endpoint. The nesting condition ensures that, when a vertex is reached, all of the edges <b>for</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> the second endpoint are ready to be dequeued. Another equivalent definition of queue layouts involves embeddings of the given graph onto a cylinder, with the vertices placed on {{a line in the}} cylinder and with each edge wrapping once around the cylinder. Edges that are assigned to the same queue are not allowed to cross each other, but crossings are allowed between edges that belong to different queues.|$|R

The system and website choked under the strain of thousands of users simultaneously attempting to play {{the latest version of}} Counter-Strike.

5|$|The {{first signs}} of Meyerbeer {{breaking}} with the Italian traditions {{in which he had}} trained are in Il crociato in Egitto. Amongst other notable features of the opera were its lavish orchestral forces (extending to two onstage military bands in the final act). The grandiosity of the work reflected the need to make an impact on the sophisticated and technologically advanced stages of London and Paris, <b>for</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> extensively rewritten. Meyerbeer's contribution was revealed at this stage to be the combination of Italian vocal lines, German orchestration and harmony, and the use of contemporary theatrical techniques, ideas which he carried forward in Robert and his later works. However Meyerbeer's background in the Italian operatic traditions can be clearly seen as late as 1859 in the 'mad scene' in Dinorah (the virtuoso aria Ombre légère).|$|E
