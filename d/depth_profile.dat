500|$|The medium {{half-life}} of 227Ac (21.77 years) {{makes it}} very convenient radioactive isotope in modeling the slow vertical mixing of oceanic waters. The associated processes cannot be studied with the required accuracy by direct measurements of current velocities (of the order 50 meters per year). However, evaluation of the concentration depth-profiles for different isotopes allows estimating the mixing rates. The physics behind this method is as follows: oceanic waters contain homogeneously dispersed 235U. Its decay product, 231Pa, gradually precipitates to the bottom, so that its concentration first increases with depth and then stays nearly constant. 231Pa decays to 227Ac; however, the concentration of the latter isotope does not follow the 231Pa <b>depth</b> <b>profile,</b> but instead increases toward the sea bottom. This occurs because of the mixing processes which raise some additional 227Ac from the sea bottom. Thus analysis of both 231Pa and 227Ac depth profiles allows to model the mixing behavior.Ac in deep ocean water |journal=Nature |volume=310 |pages=486–488 |date=1984 |doi=10.1038/310486a0 | issue=5977 | bibcode = 1984Natur.310..486N}} ...|$|E

Such interactions are commonly of Coulomb nature.
