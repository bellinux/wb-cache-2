5000|$|The gallows {{from which}} he is {{suspended}} forms a Tau cross, while the figure - from {{the position of the}} legs - forms a <b>fylfot</b> <b>cross.</b> There is a nimbus about the head of the seeming martyr. It should be noted (1) that the tree of sacrifice is living wood, with leaves thereon; (2) that the face expresses deep entrancement, not suffering; (3) that the figure, as a whole, suggests life in suspension, but life and not death. ... It has been called falsely a card of martyrdom, a card of prudence, a card of the Great Work, a card of duty ... I will say very simply on my own part that it expresses the relation, in one of its aspects, between the Divine and the Universe.There is a halo burning brightly around the hanged man's head, signifying a higher learning or an enlightenment.|$|E
