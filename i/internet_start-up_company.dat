40|$|This paper {{considers}} the path from formation to failure of two <b>Internet</b> <b>start-up</b> <b>companies</b> {{in the context}} of the work of numerous academic researchers in the field of corporate financial distress and bankruptcy. In the 1990 s, several authors found evidence that small, young companies are particularly prone to failure, especially if they are in a high technology field. These authors commonly found failing companies experienced problems with management, profits, cash flow and liquidity. Two decades earlier, Argenti (1976) had set out a typical path from birth to failure of a dynamic company that behaved in a manner reminiscent of many Internet firms. Argenti’s work highlighted the importance of both injections of capital and withholding of capital in the life cycle of many companies. This paper’s comparison of two business-to consumer (B 2 C) <b>Internet</b> <b>start-ups</b> with the model derived from academic research suggests some <b>Internet</b> <b>start-ups</b> of this sort may be inherently predisposed to failure. A crucial factor would appear to be that these firms have elected to retail goods that are simply unsuited to being sold via the Internet. This means that revenues are always going to be small and this problem is exacerbated by the fact that <b>Internet</b> <b>start-ups</b> have excessive expenditure in the development phase followed by fairly limited options for funding when under pressure, having no recourse to debt financing or liquidation of assets. Combine these factors and it is clear to see that the probability of failure is very high...|$|R
50|$|Since the 1990s, San Francisco's {{economy has}} diversified away from finance and tourism towards the growing fields of high tech, biotechnology, and medical research. Technology jobs {{accounted}} for just 1 percent of San Francisco's economy in 1990, growing to 4 percent in 2010 {{and an estimated}} 8 percent {{by the end of}} 2013. San Francisco became an epicenter of <b>Internet</b> <b>start-up</b> <b>companies</b> during the dot-com bubble of the 1990s and the subsequent social media boom of the late 2000s (decade). Since 2010, San Francisco proper has attracted an increasing share of venture capital investments as compared to nearby Silicon Valley, attracting 423 financings worth US$4.58 billion in 2013. In 2004, the city approved a payroll tax exemption for biotechnology companies to foster growth in the Mission Bay neighborhood, site of a second campus and hospital of the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). Mission Bay hosts the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine, California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences, and Gladstone Institutes, as well as more than 40 private-sector life sciences companies.|$|R
40|$|This Master's thesis {{deals with}} the Internet {{start-up}} companies' topic, their lifecycle and possible application of the classical business plan theory. The aim of the thesis is to describe the lifecycle of an <b>internet</b> <b>start-up</b> <b>company</b> from its early plan-ning phase, market research, to its business strategy statement. The aim {{is to provide a}} brief tutorial on planning and realization of an internet project too. To give advices and provide experiences, which have been gained during writing the thesis. This work brings to the reader a confrontation of a classical business plan with the entire internet project. It also aims to certify viability of the particular internet start-up idea mainly thanks to a wide research on the public's and attorneys' side of the market. Practical part of the thesis brings up an idea of the particular <b>internet</b> <b>start-up</b> <b>company</b> "Free Advice" and its business model, market research on this project, public's and attorneys' interest, initial phase {{and the beginning of the}} realisation of the project. Goals were achieved through practical work on the first three phases of the business plan. The author's added value is mainly in application of theoretical premises of the business plan to the concrete business idea. This will allow other entrepreneurs to easily implement the business plan theory to an internet project in order to justify its meaningfulness. The achieved results can be used in order to realise this particular idea and to get necessary funds...|$|E

Frank Daniels III was LHP, for [...] "Lord High Protector." [...] George Schlukbier was CBGL, for [...] "Chief Bull Goose Looney." [...] Employees followed suit with their own job titles. As in other <b>internet</b> <b>start-up</b> <b>companies,</b> there was frenzied activity 24-hours a day, seven days a week.

During the period when Kevin Mitnick was America's most-wanted computer hacker (1994-1995) he was living in Raleigh and using cell phones to hack into ISP's and then telneting into unsuspecting UNIX servers (like Nando) and creating directories/files and deleting all traces. Nando technicians tried, but never quite managed, to get a fix on Mitnick's location. All the while, the company was in communication with the FBI.

40|$|Once awarded {{exclusively}} to upper management, stock options are now granted increasingly to rank-and-file employees and {{are becoming a}} greater component of employee compensation. The expanding use of stock options is undoubtedly {{due in part to}} the large increase in equity prices over the last twenty years. Further fueling the demand was the <b>Internet</b> <b>start-up</b> boom of the late 1990 s, the spectacular financial success of many technology and computer companies, notably Microsoft and Oracle, and the well- publicized lucre acquired by their employees. The collapse of the initial public offerings market for <b>Internet</b> <b>start-up</b> <b>companies</b> at the dawn of the twenty-first century, accompanied by the rapid decline in the stock prices of many companies in technology-related sectors, served to apprise employees that option returns are risky. Microsoft 2 ̆ 7 s recent announcement that it plans to replace its option program with a restricted stock program will undoubtedly cause many companies to reevaluate their use of compensatory options. Nevertheless, it appears that options will continue to be an important part of employee compensation. This Article examines the international tax issues raised by global stock option plans. It first examines the financial reasons for and unique issues raised by granting employees stock options and the U. S. accounting treatment of stock option plans. It then reviews the U. S. and tax treaty rules applicable to holders and issuers of non-qualified stock options and examines the conflicts that arise when a compensatory option holder or option income is subject to the tax jurisdiction of more than one country. Finally, it considers unilateral, bilateral, and multilateral policy options of tax administrators in the face of the global stock option plans. This Article argues that the United States should consider unilaterally amending its foreign tax credit regime to prevent the double taxation of option holders, incorporate option provisions in its income tax treaties, and support the general multilateral approach set forth in the OECD Report...|$|R

50|$|Early 2000 to 2001 saw the {{dramatic}} bursting of the dot-com bubble. Excitement over {{the prospects of}} Internet stocks had led to huge increases in the major indexes.

2500|$|In 2001, {{the markets}} crashed, the boom ended, and many left San Francisco. South of Market, where many dot-com {{companies}} were located, had been bustling and crowded with few vacancies, but by 2002 was a virtual wasteland of empty offices and for-rent signs. Much {{of the boom}} was blamed for the city's [...] "fastest shrinking population", reducing the city's population by 30,000 {{in just a few}} years. While the bust has helped put an ease on the city's apartment rents, the city remains expensive. By 2003, the city's economy had recovered from the dot-com crash thanks to a resurgent international tourist industry and the Web 2.0 boom that saw the creation of many new <b>internet</b> and software <b>start-up</b> <b>companies</b> in the city, attracting white-collar workers, recent University graduates, and [...] young adults from all over the world. Residential demand as well as rents rose again, and as a result city officials relaxed building height restrictions and zoning codes to construct residential condominiums in SOMA such as One Rincon Hill, 300 Spear Street, and Millennium Tower, although the late 2000s recession has indefinitely halted many construction projects such as Rincon Hill. Part of this development is the reconstruction of the Transbay Terminal Replacement Project.|$|R

40|$|The {{identification}} of the different factors impacting a software <b>start-up</b> <b>company's</b> decision to pursue an alliance, acquisition, IPO or venture capital to sustain growth is the main objective of this research study. First and foremost on a software <b>start-up</b> <b>company's</b> list of reasons to pursue and engage in alliances is to leverage the incumbent's tangible and intangible assets. Other factors impacting their decision to leverage alliances include the opportunity to enhance stability and profitability {{and the opportunity to}} acquire key customers. Another key factor that encourages <b>start-up</b> <b>company</b> alliance or strategic partnership formation is the need for the <b>start-up</b> <b>company</b> to establish platform leadership. Like the pursuit of alliances, foremost on a software <b>start-up</b> <b>company's</b> list of reasons to pursue and engage in acquisitions is to leverage the incumbent's or the acquirer's tangible and intangible assets. Other factors impacting their decision to get acquired include the boost such an acquisition will provide in helping them establish platform leadership. Acquisitions are also pursued by <b>start-up</b> <b>companies</b> when the founders want to exit. <b>Start-up</b> <b>companies</b> also pursue to get acquired to survive, when no other option are available. Lastly, they would opt to get acquired to penetrate new markets. Given optimal economic conditions, IPOs capture the best liquidity and valuation. It is advantageous versus getting acquired in that one gets to sustain growth while retaining control of the software <b>start-up</b> <b>company.</b> Software <b>start-up</b> <b>companies</b> seek venture capital funding for a number of factors. This includes getting help in business development, leveraging the VC network, obtaining a certification effect, diversifying net worth and reducing risk, and pursuing and engaging in alliances successfully. (cont.) There is no one universal paradigm to help a software <b>start-up</b> <b>company</b> determine when it is best to pursue an alliance, an acquisition, an IPO or venture capital. A myriad of factors specific to one's situation impacts the decision to choose the right growth strategy. To make the most informed decision, the executive team must consider all these factors. by Sergio D. Ybanez. Thesis (S. M.)
