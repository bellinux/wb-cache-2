5|$|Capsize is {{the word}} used to {{describe}} a bike falling over without oscillation. During capsize, an uncontrolled front wheel usually steers {{in the direction of}} lean, but never enough to stop the increasing lean, until a very high lean angle is reached, at which point the steering may turn in the opposite direction. A capsize can happen very slowly if the bike <b>is</b> <b>moving</b> <b>forward</b> rapidly. Because the capsize instability is so slow, on the order of seconds, it is easy for the rider to control, and is actually used by the rider to initiate the lean necessary for a turn.|$|E

25|$|Cellulosic ethanol {{is a type}} of biofuel {{produced}} from lignocellulose, a material that comprises much of the mass of plants. Corn stover, switchgrass, miscanthus and woodchip are some of the more popular non-edible cellulosic materials for ethanol production. Commercial investment in such second-generation biofuels began in 2006/2007, and much of this investment went beyond pilot-scale plants. Cellulosic ethanol commercialization <b>is</b> <b>moving</b> <b>forward</b> rapidly. The world’s first commercial wood-to-ethanol plant began operation in Japan in 2007, with a capacity of 1.4 million liters/year. The first wood-to-ethanol plant in the United States is planned for 2008 with an initial output of 75 million liters/year.|$|E

25|$|Rose and the Doctor also {{decide to}} {{investigate}} the party and don servant garb to disguise themselves. The Doctor and Rose learn that Pete and Jackie are childless and about to divorce. When Rose attempts {{to discuss it with}} Jackie she is rebuked for overstepping her bounds. Suddenly the party is interrupted by the Cybermen, who smash into the house and surround the guests. Lumic calls the President, who is in attendance, telling him that he <b>is</b> <b>moving</b> <b>forward</b> with his plans and that all of humanity will be upgraded. Lumic tells everyone that upgrading is compulsory and that anyone who refuses will be deleted. The President refuses to be upgraded and is killed by a Cyberman. The partygoers panic, try to flee and the Cybermen begin killing them. The Doctor, Rose, and Pete escape the house and encounter Mickey and the Preachers outside. They try firing upon the advancing Cybermen with automatic rifles, but their bullets do no damage and soon they are surrounded. The Doctor tells everyone to surrender and tells the Cybermen that they are volunteering for the upgrade. The Cybermen tell them that they are incompatible and will be deleted. The episode ends with the Cybermen advancing on them.|$|E
500|$|VOSES uses miniature, {{all-weather}} audio speakers {{that are}} placed on the hybrid's wheel wells and emit specific sounds based on the direction the car is moving {{in order to minimize}} noise pollution and to maximize acoustic information for pedestrians. If the car <b>is</b> <b>moving</b> <b>forward,</b> the sounds are only projected in the forward direction; and if the car is turning left or right, the sound changes on the left or right appropriately. The company argues that chirps, beeps and alarms are more distracting than useful, and that the best sounds for alerting pedestrians are carlike, such as [...] "the soft purr of an engine or the slow roll of tires across pavement." [...] One of the EVA's external sound systems was designed specifically for the Toyota Prius.|$|E

She is initially excited, but Tracy Jordan and Jenna Maroney convince her to test the market and search for other offers before agreeing to work with Jack. Liz signs with a talent agent (Josh Fadem) to explore other options, but later learns he is a low-level agent. Jack cannot stand Liz's dismissal of him, and as a result, he announces through the media that NBC <b>is</b> <b>moving</b> <b>forward</b> with the pilot's production and calls in Padma Lakshmi as a potential new host in place of Liz. Liz threatens to sue Jack and NBC {{for the rights to}} [...] "Dealbreakers", but Jack informs her that NBC owns the rights to it. Liz takes a meeting with Sports Shouting producer, Scottie Shofar (Shawn Levy), and Jack meets with Padma. During their respective meetings, however, the two realize that they should work with one another. They shake hands {{at the end of the}} episode, agreeing to create the pilot together.|$|E
500|$|... “Spirit in Motion” is {{the motto}} for the Paralympic movement. [...] The {{symbol for the}} Paralympics {{contains}} three colours, red, blue, and green, which are the colours most widely represented in the flags of nations. [...] The colours are each {{in the shape of}} an Agito (which is Latin for [...] "I move"), which is the name given to an asymmetrical crescent specially designed for the Paralympic movement. [...] The three Agitos circle a central point, which is a symbol for the athletes congregating from all points of the globe. [...] The motto and symbol of the IPC were changed in 2003 to their current versions. [...] The change was intended to convey the idea that Paralympians have a spirit of competition and that the IPC as an organization realizes its potential and <b>is</b> <b>moving</b> <b>forward</b> to achieve it. [...] The vision of the IPC is, [...] "To enable Paralympic athletes to achieve sporting excellence and to inspire and excite the world." [...] The Paralympic anthem is [...] "Hymne de l'Avenir" [...] or [...] "Anthem of the Future". [...] It was composed by Thierry Darnis and adopted as the official anthem in March 1996.|$|E

O'Malley's prominence at the convention generated both support for, and criticism of, his record.

2500|$|The rider's seat bones {{remain in}} contact with the saddle at all times. The rider [...] "rolls" [...] with the canter, {{allowing}} free movement in the hips and relaxation in the thighs. The hips move from a backward position, to an upright position aligned with the body, to a slightly forward position, in relation to the gait. So when the 1-2-3 of the footfalls occur, the seat <b>is</b> <b>moving</b> <b>forward.</b> During the suspension phase, it moves back. The rider should focus on making a sweeping motion with the hips. [...] A good visualization technique is for a rider to imagine sweeping the saddle with one's seat, or to visualize sitting in a swing, using the seat muscles to gently move it going back and forth.|$|E
2500|$|One {{government}} which <b>is</b> <b>moving</b> <b>forward</b> with mitigation plans is the emirate of Abu Dhabi. [...] The United Arab Emirates economy minister stated in 2007 that the UAE {{do not believe}} that relying on oil revenues is sustainable, and so are moving to diversify their economies. [...] Besides allotting land for solar power plants and partnering with Massachusetts Institute of Technology to build an alternative energy research institute, a new city is being constructed [...] east-southeast of the city of Abu Dhabi, which will rely entirely on solar energy, with a sustainable, zero-carbon, zero-waste ecology. Known as Masdar (Arabic for source), the initiative is headed by the Abu Dhabi Future Energy Company (ADFEC) [...] The project is estimated to take some 10 years to complete, with the first phase complete and habitable in 2009, and a goal of housing 50,000 people and 1,500 businesses. The city is intended to cover , with no point further than 200 m from a solar powered personal rapid transit link, housing energy, science and technology communities, commercial areas, a university, and the headquarters of the Future Energy Company. [...] By relying on sustainable energy sources, keeping cars out of the city, returning to older architectural conventions (such as reducing air conditioning costs with large tents and narrow spaces between buildings), using sewage to produce energy and create soil, taking advantage of all recycling opportunities (including for and from construction), and reusing gray water, Masdar is designed to be a city which will consume no oil.|$|E

60|$|This conveys {{in general}} terms, at least, my {{interpretation}} of the present time, {{and it is in}} accordance with this view that the world <b>is</b> <b>moving</b> <b>forward</b> as a whole and with much dispersed and discrepant rightness, that I do not want to go apart from {{the world as a whole}} into any smaller community, with all the implication of an exclusive possession of right which such a going apart involves. Put to the test by my own Samurai for example by a particularly urgent and enthusiastic discipline, I found I did not in the least want to be one of that organization, that it only expressed one side of a much more complex self than its disciplines permitted. And still less do I want to hamper the play of my thoughts and motives by going apart into the particularism of a new religion. Such refuges are well enough when the times threaten to overwhelm one. The point about the present age, so far as I am able to judge the world, is that it does not threaten to overwhelm; that at the worst, by my standards, it maintains its way of thinking instead of assimilating mine.|$|E
