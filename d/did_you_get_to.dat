She was a grandmother already at that time, and her pretty granddaughters accompanied me to the airport". [...] FAITHFUL SCUFFLE [...] “You mother and your father…” “I was raised by my grandmother and my grandfather. And I also had two gouvernantes: one of them was from Vienna and another one was from Bordeaux. Half a day I had to speak German, while another half a day I spoke French. My father was socialist revolutionary, he was either in exile or deported. Children of rich prosperous people often decide to join revolutionaries. We left Russia and traveled to France three weeks after Lenin's death, because my father understood very well how it will be going. We lived in France for the money of our relative, Kiev millionaire and sugar manufacturer Lev Brodsky. My parents came back to the birthplace in 1931, they were possessed with yearn for justice. My father was poisoned in 1935, and my mother…” “Why did you stay?” “I was serving in French Armed Forces. In 1933 I arrived in Moscow as a correspondent of a newspaper Matin where Mikhail Koltsov invited me to work with him as a French editor in the recently created The Moscow News. I didn't stay there for a long time, because I had a fight with Konstantin Umansky, head of the Press department of the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs (Ministry of Foreign Affairs)". [...] “Did you fight with fists?” “Of course! We were rolling on the ground, he was very strong. I received a report of a People's Commissar Maxim Litvinov that was read by him in League of Nations in French, but I didn't know about that, because I was given this report in Russian. I translated it repeatedly. Of course, my text differed from the one of Litvinov. Umansky summoned me and said: “Who was that idiot who published Litvinov’s report?” I couldn’t hold myself. He still didn’t recover and come to his senses, while I was running to the French Embassy. As a person who served in The French Armed Forces I had the right for the French citizenship. Thus, I took the train in two hours. If not that story, I'd stay in USSR (Soviet Union) and I am sure I wouldn't survive it, because repressions just started". [...] “Did you share your parents' political views and sympathies?" [...] “I shared their views regarding the necessity of justice, and I will never ever agree on limiting freedom for the sake of this justice. One should always find compromise between freedom and justice at any historical moment. Every epoch and every country should have their own compromises". [...] WAR IS MONOTONY AND ROUTINE [...] “Did de Gaulle know how to do it?" [...] “If only France wouldn't have been defeated in 1940, de Gaulle would die a Division General. De Gaulle became catalyst of resistance, and this resistance was inevitable". [...] “How did it happen that you became {{one of the founders of}} de Gaulle's Party and one of General's closest associates?” “The story that I was among the founders of this Party is true, but the story that I was one of the closest associates is a legend. I was just one of the first people who joined him in June 1940. General addressed all the French people through the radio from London, while I had no questions whether to live in France occupied by Germans or to fight Germans". [...] “When did your war start?" [...] “It started in 1936. I was writing some poetry at that period of time and I wrote in one of my verses: if Francisco Franco will seize Madrid, Germans will take Paris. I heard about German offensive on 10 May 1940, when I was in Paris, where I was having a ball celebrating awarding of the first officer rank. Youth is always careless and light hearted". [...] “How <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> England?" [...] “We dashed to the small city of Saint-Jean-de-Luz, where Englishmen embarked the rests of Polish Military on their vessels. Then there was an African Campaign (Mediterranean and Middle East theatre of World War II). De Gaulle addressed the troops on our way with the short speech that ended with the words: “Future of France is in our hands”. It was that moment when I first saw his famous gesture that became later an ordinary and well known gesture for the millions of French citizens, - he raised his hands above his head and stood motionless for some time. It’s impossible to forget it”.|$|E

Not bad for me, eh? But seriously, angel, it’s not as bad as all that. I’ve got some pretty good ideas as to how to raise some money, and I was talking to a fellow here that just bought an engagement and a wedding ring, and they’re not too expensive, at least not $ 500. But as you said before, you don’t get married every day, so by God we’re going to have the best. But most of all, darling, I want you to be happy. If there is ever any doubt in your mind, just let me know. We’ve still got {{a lot of things to}} settle, hon. I want to have a long talk with you this weekend. Oh by the way, have you told your father yet? I wonder what he’ll have to say. Maybe I better send him another carton of cigarettes. Well hon, the sergeant just finished drawing my bath, I don’t want to keep him waiting. Give my best to your family. Your mother is really marvelous. I love you.
