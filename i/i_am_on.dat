In an interview in 2014, Heinz Prüller recalled Rindt speaking about Indianapolis in 1967: [...] "In Indianapolis, I always feel like <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>on</b> my way to my own funeral." [...] At another occasion, he said about the track: [...] "It is catastrophic, I only drive there because of the money." ...|$|E

500|$|A Confederate officer {{approached}} Capehart's 3rd Brigade {{on horseback}} under a flag of truce. Capehart and the officer rode down the column to General Custer, where the officer told the general that Lee and Grant were in correspondence concerning a surrender of Lee's Army. The Confederate officer also requested a truce until {{the results of}} the negotiation were known. Custer's response was [...] "Tell General Longstreet that I am not in command of all the forces here, but that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>on</b> his flank and rear with a large cavalry force, and that I will accept nothing but unconditional surrender." ...|$|E
500|$|Anti-German {{sentiment}} rose {{among the}} British public, in newspapers, and in elite gentlemen's clubs, where resentment was inflamed by Admiral Lord Charles Beresford despite Churchill's remonstrances. Driven by public opinion, Churchill asked Prince Louis to resign as First Sea Lord on 27 October 1914. When acceptance of Battenberg's resignation was delayed by the King's {{opposition to the}} appointment of Fisher in his place, Louis wrote to Churchill, [...] "I beg of you to release me. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>on</b> the verge of breaking down & I cannot use my brain for anything". On 13 November he wrote to Churchill's Naval Secretary, Rear-Admiral Horace Hood, [...] "It was an awful wrench, but I had no choice from the moment it was made {{clear to me that}} the Government did not feel themselves strong enough to support me by some public pronouncement." ...|$|E
500|$|In October 2003, Harisu {{made the}} {{decision}} to leave her management company, TTM Entertainment. However, TTM claimed to hold the rights to her stage name, and announced their intentions to use that name to promote other artists. The matter was taken to court, and in early 2004 the ruling went in favour of Harisu, allowing her to keep the name. She subsequently set up her own company, G Entertainment, in order to make her own decisions regarding her career. In February she released her third album, Foxy Lady, which marked a change from the sound of her previous albums towards a more hip-hop/R style, with Harisu saying [...] "now <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>on</b> my own, and showing my true colors, doing exactly the kind of music that I've always wanted." [...] The album, however, failed to make the top 50 in the Korean charts.|$|E

2500|$|In the {{following}} year potato blight brought famine which impinged on the Darwins' servants and workmen, and led to overthrow of the Corn Laws. Darwin welcomed this, but as a landowner now found that it affected his income from rent and {{he wrote to his}} agent that [...] "Although <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>on</b> principle a free-trader, of course I am not willing to make a larger reduction than necessary to retain a good tenant." [...] Despite his own illness recurring, Darwin pressed on with South America, having to jointly subsidise it with the publisher when the Treasury grant ran out, and it was completed by October 1846.|$|E

2500|$|When {{former head}} writer Megan McTavish rewrote Erica's {{abortion}} {{to not have}} been an abortion due to the antics of Dr. Greg Madden, it upset fans who {{felt that it was}} [...] "a disgrace" [...] to the ground-breaking abortion storyline Agnes Nixon had written three decades earlier. Colin Egglesfield, Josh's portrayer, when queried by Soap Opera Digest on the matter of possibly holding the record in daytime for the oddest way to be brought into the world, replied, [...] "Yeah, and it's kind of funny because when people ask me who <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>on</b> the show, I like to say, 'I'm the abortion of Erica Kane.'

Realizing his illness was terminal, he secured Zumwalt's permission to return to his command and serve as long as he could. [...] "I am a realist and know that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>on</b> borrowed time," [...] Colbert wrote his chaplain. [...] "I am convinced that the Lord has decided to give me some extra time to do some things in this, my last command, which might better insure a safer world. That is the gist of my prayers.

2500|$|Nadezhda von Meck was a professed atheist, {{which was}} not unusual in aristocratic Russia in the 1870s. Her fierce need for independence, on the other hand, was very unusual for {{a woman of the}} time. Her {{division}} between that and concern for her family resulted in contradictions between her beliefs and actions. Her views on affairs of the heart were strictly moral, but she did not believe in marriage as a social institution and regularly professed her hatred of it to Tchaikovsky. [...] "You may think, my dear Pyotr Ilyich, that I am a great admirer of marriage," [...] she wrote on 31 March 1878, [...] "but in order that you not be mistaken in anything referring to myself, I shall tell you that <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> <b>on</b> the contrary, an irreconcilable enemy of marriages, yet when I discuss another person's situation, I consider it necessary to do so from his point of view." [...] On another occasion, she stated more genially but no less forcefully, [...] "The distribution of rights and obligations as determined by social laws I find speculative and immoral." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1784, when Penniman was 24, she {{was living}} {{with her mother and}} step-father, Mr. Wall, in Westminster. He was {{probably}} attempting to recover some of the lost possessions of the family. But Brush’s vast acres had been sequestered to the state; even his library and furniture had been scattered. Gen. Ethan Allen, who had frequent occasion to visit Westminster, fell a victim to Penniman's charms. Gen. Allen was at this time a widower of 47, with three or four children. On February 16th, Gen. Allen entered Margaret’s apartment, and found Penniman in a morning gown, standing on a chair, arranging china on the shelves of a china-closet. After a few words of greeting, he said to her, “Fanny, if we are ever to be married, now is the time, for <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>on</b> my way to Arlington." [...] “Very well,” she replied, “if you will give me time to get my josie.” In a very short time she was ready, and together they entered the breakfast-room where a group of judges were sitting. Chief-Justice Robinson was asked by Allen to perform the ceremony. To Robinson’s astonished question “When?” the answer was “Now.” The judge suggested that {{it was a matter of}} importance which required due consideration, to which Allen replied, implying that with such a bride long consideration was unnecessary. The ceremony was performed, interrupted at one point by Allen, who when called upon to promise “agreeable to the law of God,” exclaimed after a glance out the window, [...] "The law of God as written in the Book of Nature? Yes, go on." [...] The ceremony concluded, the bride’s trunk and guitar-case were placed in the sleigh and they left for their home in Arlington.|$|E
