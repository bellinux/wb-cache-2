Spotnitz and the {{production}} crew, however, felt it was natural to suggest that Scully and Mulder's relationship may have evolved into a romantic one. The idea of heart chakra crop circles was included because Anderson wanted [...] "whatever Mulder was involved in that took him away from me, away from Washington, to somehow tie into what <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was going through—the journey that I was going through". As such, Anderson dedicated {{much of her time}} researching both crop circles and heart chakras, but she later gave additional credit to Spotnitz, who she noted was also heavily involved during the researching process.|$|E
500|$|When, {{several years}} after its passage, the 1873 law became a {{political}} issue, some {{of those involved in}} enacting it, including Sherman and Linderman, stated that there had been no intent to end bimetallism in the elimination of the authority for private citizens to have silver bullion coined into dollars. They argued that the 1853 legislation had ended the practice of having bullion struck into smaller-denomination coins; the 1873 act simply rectified an omission and eliminated a coin with a low mintage that did not circulate. They were not always consistent in their denials: Boutwell wrote in his memoirs that [...] "in 1873 I had come to believe that it was wise for every nation to recognize, establish, and maintain the gold standard... hence <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> determined to abandon the idea of a double [...] standard.|$|E

2500|$|By 1985, {{there was}} a {{considerable}} amount of conflicts between band members. Lead singer Joey Ramone {{went so far as to}} withdraw from the writing process despite being a vital part of it on previous records. Joey recalled, [...] "I'd had it with the Ramones. 'Mental Hell' is about that. Part of it came from breaking up with [...] Angela. The other part of <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had really had it with the band." [...] In later interviews, however, Joey stated that it was not the conflict that made him stop writing, but rather he had [...] "ideas on the backburner." [...] Bassist Dee Dee Ramone said lead guitarist Johnny Ramone was the reason for much of the stress, supposedly not wanting to do songs Joey would write for multiple reasons. Dee Dee related: [...] "Joey will present a great tune and Johnny won't do it because it's this or it's that. 'I'm not going to play minor chords. I'm not going to play lead. I'm not going to come to England.' For God's sake! That's why Joey gotta do his solo album." ...|$|E

2500|$|In February 2014, {{during a}} Q session for the album, at SONOS Studios in Los Angeles, California, Schoolboy Q {{described}} the song [...] "Prescription/Oxymoron", {{as the most}} personal: [...] "I came up selling OxyContin," [...] he said. [...] "The karma behind <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> never took an OxyContin before but I did get addicted to Percocets, Xanax, Codeine—shit like that. When my daughter was one and two , I used to get into sleep comas, like 'Xan comas'—just dead {{to the world and}} I put it into the music." [...] Schoolboy Q said he arranged the song to juxtapose the process of selling prescription pills and addiction: [...] "I put the OxyContin and selling it {{at the end of the}} relapse or the addiction," [...] he said. [...] "I sold OxyContin and then I got addicted [...] This way, I showed that I got addicted then I sold it. That was a crazy record. That's true shit—the first part of it when my daughter tried to wake me up and I was dead to the world. That was my little secret. I always had the cup with me. They just never knew I had a gang of pills in the other bottle. That was a little story about me and how I was addicted, too." ...|$|E
2500|$|I became {{terrified that}} I {{was going to}} be a full-time, bomb-throwing {{terrorist}} if I stayed [...] because it was the beginning of really bad times in America. It was '66–'67, it was the first police riot in Los Angeles.... In college my major was political science, so my brain worked that way.... And I drove around this little English Hillman Minx—top down—and every night I'd be hauled over by the cops. Up against the wall, and all this stuff. They had this monologue with me; it was never a dialogue. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was a long-haired drug addict living off some rich guy's foolish daughter. And I said, [...] "No, I work in advertising. I make twice as much as you do." [...] Which is a stupid thing to say to a cop....And it was like an epiphany. I suddenly felt what it was like to be a black or Mexican kid living in L.A. Before that, I thought I knew what the world was like, I thought I knew what poor people were, and then suddenly it all changed because of that simple thing of being brutalized by cops. And I got more and more angry and I just felt, I've got to get out of here—I'm a better cartoonist than I am a bomb maker. That's why so much of the U.S. is still standing.|$|E
2500|$|Brian Michael Bendis, Michael Avon Oeming and David W. Mack {{became friends}} while {{all three were}} working on {{individual}} small press projects. Bendis says that he also began to [...] "analyz why <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> [...] never attempted to write a superhero comic" [...] at the time, while he was writing crime books such as Jinx and Goldfish, despite his love of the genre. Concluding that Frank Miller's The Dark Knight Returns and Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons' Watchmen had sufficiently explored the genre, Bendis decided to work in other genres." [...] The series' concept was derived from his love of crime fiction and police procedurals in general, as well as specific works such as , Janis Joplin's biography, Taxi Driver, T-Men, Traffic and , and would {{take the form of}} a Behind the Music-type look at superheroes. Powers, Oeming says, is [...] "a superhero universe seen through the eyes of the police... observed by the media" [...] and everyday individuals. Bendis' intention was to view the [...] "cliches of the superhero genre through the harder eyes of the cops," [...] but with the added layer that (echoing [...] "Behind the Music") [...] "every arc has some footing in a famous rock star story." [...] Bendis' scripts are often compiled from [...] "a list of scenes," [...] eschewing [...] "the big exploding ending" [...] in favor of a [...] "character-driven or psychological ending." [...] Indeed, in experimenting with plots, the duo swiftly moved beyond 'mere' police procedurals (despite those being both creators' [...] "favorite stories"), constantly pushing each other creatively in new ways. In conceiving plots for the series, Bendis emphasizes the purpose and themes in the narrative over [...] "just being cool", and allowing the theme to dictate the direction of the story.|$|E
