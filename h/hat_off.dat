5|$|Simão de Andrade, {{brother to}} Fernão Pires, sailed from Malacca to China {{with a small}} crew on three junks in August 1519. Simão {{immediately}} made a bad impression upon the Chinese when he built a fort {{at the center of}} Tuen Mun, an island designated for all foreigners to trade. Soon after, Simão ceremoniously executed a Portuguese and barred other foreigners (mostly Siamese and other South East Asians) from trading on the island, which drew even more attention to him. When a Chinese official visited the island and began reasserting Ming authority over it, Simão became aggressive and hit him, knocking the official's <b>hat</b> <b>off.</b>|$|E
5|$|The fourth was {{performed}} at the Apollo Theater in 2002 and at the 50th American Bandstand Special in 2002 and is a variation of both {{the second and third}} version. There are clicking beats as with the 1999 mix, but only replacing the finger snaps in the beginning and the main beat begins as it does in the 1995 mix. Additionally during the performance at the 50th American Bandstand Special, Jackson briefly sang a section live towards the end and even threw his <b>hat</b> <b>off</b> along with the jacket. Jackson's performance at the Apollo Theather marks his last live performance ever.|$|E

25|$|Henry {{is said to}} have disliked {{his younger}} brother, Charles, and to have teased him, {{although}} this derives from only one anecdote: when Charles was nine years of age, Henry snatched the <b>hat</b> <b>off</b> a bishop {{and put it on the}} younger child's head, then told his younger brother that when he became king he would make Charles Archbishop of Canterbury, and then Charles would have a long robe to hide his ugly rickety legs.

25|$|In {{the early}} days of Hogwarts, the four founders {{hand-picked}} students for their Houses. When the founders worried how students would be selected after their deaths, Godric Gryffindor took his <b>hat</b> <b>off</b> and they each added knowledge to it, allowing the Sorting Hat to choose the students by judging each student's qualities and placing them in the most appropriate house. The student's own choices may affect the decision: the clearest example is the Hat telling Harry that he would do well in Slytherin in the first book, but ultimately selecting Gryffindor after Harry asks it not to put him in Slytherin.|$|E
25|$|In {{filming the}} pivotal gunfights, Leone largely removes {{dialogue}} {{to focus more}} on the actions of the characters, which was important during the film's iconic Mexican standoff. This style can also be seen in one of the film's protagonists, Blondie (aka The Man with No Name), which is described by critics as more defined by his actions than his words. All three characters can be seen as anti-heroes killing for their personal gain. Leone also employed stylistic trick shooting, such as Blondie shooting the <b>hat</b> <b>off</b> a person's head and severing a hangman's noose with a well-placed shot, in many of its iconic shootouts.|$|E

25|$|Scarlett and {{his command}} group, two aides and a trumpeter, {{were the first}} to reach the Russian cavalry. The rest of the brigade {{followed}} closely. As they neared the Russian line, they started to take carbine fire, which killed the Scots Greys' commander and took the <b>hat</b> <b>off</b> of its executive officer. The Scots Greys finally came abreast of the Inniskillings just short of the Russians and the two regiments finally were able to gallop. As the Inniskillings shouted their battle cry, Faugh A Ballagh, observers reported that the Scots Greys made an eerie, growling moan. The Scots Greys charged through the Russian cavalry, along with the Inniskilings, and disappeared into the melee among the mass of Russian cavalry. With both forces disordered by the charge, it became clear to the regimental adjutant of the Scots Greys that, to avoid be overwhelmed by Russian numbers, the Scots Greys had to reform. Pushed back from the centre of the mass, the Scots Greys reformed around the adjutant and drove again into the Russian cavalry. Seeing that the Scots Greys were again cut off, the Royal Dragoons, finally arriving to the fight after disobeying Scarlett's order to remain with the Light Brigade, charged to their assistance, helping to push the Russians back. Amid the hacking and slashing of the sabre battle, the Russian cavalry had had enough, and retreated back up the hill, pursued for a short time by the Scots Greys {{and the rest of the}} regiments.|$|E

500|$|Bush {{appeared}} {{on the cover of}} Time magazine on April 3, 1944. He toured the Western Front in October 1944, and spoke to ordnance officers, but no senior commander would meet with him. [...] He was able to meet with Samuel Goudsmit {{and other members of the}} Alsos Mission, who assured him that there was no danger from the German project; he conveyed this assessment to Lieutenant General Bedell Smith. In May 1945, Bush became part of the Interim Committee formed to advise the new president, Harry S. Truman, on nuclear weapons. It advised that the atomic bomb should be used against an industrial target in Japan as soon as possible and without warning. Bush was present at the Alamogordo Bombing and Gunnery Range on July 16, 1945, for the Trinity nuclear test, the first detonation of an atomic bomb. Afterwards, he took his <b>hat</b> <b>off</b> to Oppenheimer in tribute.|$|E
40|$|This {{quantitative}} research project {{set out to}} answer the question, “What type of advertising strategy, logos, ethos, or pathos, will be most effective in increasing donations to <b>Hats</b> <b>Off</b> for Cancer, a nonprofit organization?” By administering a survey including manufactured advertisements to potential donors through the <b>Hats</b> <b>Off</b> for Cancer e-newsletter, the <b>Hats</b> <b>Off</b> for Cancer Facebook page, and my own Facebook network, I received 44 responses. These responses indicated the participants’ involvement with the organization {{as well as their}} preferred advertising strategies and their reasoning for this. 79 percent of respondents felt that the advertisement using pathos was most effective while 19 percent said logos and 2 percent said ethos. These responses were valuable, and based on the respondents’ reasoning behind their preferences, I constructed three implications for <b>Hats</b> <b>Off</b> for Cancer’s future advertising endeavors...|$|R

500|$|Doctors {{were able}} to catch the disease early on before it spread, unlike the case of {{baseball}} and American football player Bo Jackson. As a result, in April, doctors announced an extremely successful surgery. Jackson spoke out about Emery, speculating {{that they were the}} only two athletes to come back after the disease. Jackson added, [...] "I take my <b>hat</b> <b>off</b> [...] I want him to know I am in his corner. It's a lot of hard work. To come back and play, it takes a very, very special and driven person. He's got a different makeup to want to do all the little things he needs to compete on a professional level." [...] Unlike Jackson, who required numerous hip replacements, Emery had the benefit of advancements in modern medicine, undergoing a very specialized and complex procedure that involved removing 13 centimetres from his right fibula, and then grafting it to the femur to re-introduce a proper blood supply to the area. Holmgren said that while the surgery went better than expected, he did not know exactly how long Emery's recovery would take.|$|E

500|$|Napoleon {{embarked}} {{aboard the}} brig Épervier {{early in the}} morning of 15 July, and made his way out to the Bellerophon. As he approached, the 74-gun Superb, flying Vice-Admiral Hotham's flag, was sighted approaching. Concerned that the brig might not reach Bellerophon before the Superb arrived, and that consequently Hotham would take over and receive Napoleon himself, Maitland sent Bellerophons barge to collect the former Emperor and transfer him to the ship. At some point between 6 and 7 am, the barge pulled alongside Bellerophon and General Henri Gatien Bertrand climbed aboard, followed by Napoleon. The marines came to attention, and Napoleon walked to the quarterdeck, took his <b>hat</b> <b>off</b> to Maitland and in French announced [...] "I am come to throw myself on the protection of your Prince and your laws." [...] Maitland bowed in response. With the former emperor in custody aboard a British warship, the Napoleonic Wars were finally over. To maritime historian David Cordingly, this moment was Bellerophons [...] "crowning glory [...] six weeks after the battle of Waterloo,... Napoleon, trapped in Rochefort, surrendered to the captain of the ship that had dogged his steps for more than twenty years." ...|$|E

She was initially reluctant {{to participate in}} the segment but agreed to after a visit from Timberlake in her dressing room. Beyoncé's choreographer, Frank Gatson Jr., expressed mixed emotions at the result, saying: [...] "I was upset because I know that Justin's a great dancer and if he learned the choreography, he could do it really well... If they're making parodies [...] just like they make parodies of politicians and presidents, that means it must be big time. So in that respect, I have to take my <b>hat</b> <b>off</b> to them for doing it." [...] Later, Joe Jonas of the pop rock band Jonas Brothers posted a video on their YouTube account where he imitated the dance in a black leotard and heels. Irish pop duo Jedward parodied Beyoncé's dance moves for the video of their cover version of [...] "All the Small Things". In London, one hundred dancers wearing leotards similar to the one worn by Beyoncé performed the choreography on April 20, 2009, to promote Trident Unwrapped gum. On November 20, 2009, BBC Newsreaders including Fiona Bruce, Sophie Raworth, Kate Silverton, and Susanna Reid performed [...] "Single Ladies" [...] in black military-style uniforms. They were later joined onstage by their male newsreader colleagues Bill Turnbull, Ben Brown, Nicholas Owen, and Charlie Stayt before taking on Diversity, winners of the third series of Britain's Got Talent, in a dance-off.
