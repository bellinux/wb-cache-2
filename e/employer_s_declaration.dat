Many others have presented arguments for and against the independent application of a state 2 ̆ 7 s rights guarantees 2 ̆ 7 or have classified and analyzed the various theories of state constitutionalism {{in the shadow of}} the United States Supreme Court.

This essay, in contrast, considers the Strategy from a European perspective, one that prefers pluralist dialogue to paternalist dictate. The discussion proceeds on the belief that to study U.

The United States attempted to stay out of the conflict but soon abandoned its isolationist policies to become the "defender of democracies. " Alongside the physical combat, the U.

40|$|Codifying, {{and then}} implementing, an {{international}} right to health, health care, or protection is beset with serious roadblocks - foremost among them being contentious issues of indeterminacy, justiciability, and progressive realization.

The central impediment to the recognition of such a right is determining {{the extent to which a}} sustained level of economic stability must be chartered before a state can be seen as either recognizing or enforcing a right to health of any kind and at any level of magnitude. Indeed, under the ICESCR, realization of economic social and cultural rights is to be effected only under a standard of progressivity. In other words, so long a states move 2 ̆ 2 progressively 2 ̆ 2 toward the realization of these rights, no actionable violations will be sustained. This, then, results in a flawed enforcement mechanism which allows any state signatory to this foundational covenant to pace enforcement of the rights under the ICESCR according to national standards of political will and differing levels of economic development and sustainability. Economic self-interest - not transnational principles and lofty aspirational goals - will determine ultimately, the extent to which health care protections are recognized as a integral part of social, cultural, political, or human rights...|$|R
