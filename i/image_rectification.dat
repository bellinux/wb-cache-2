This paper proposes an evaluation procedure for camera calibration methods {{for the case}} of 3 D reconstruction using rectified multi-stereo images. The evaluation {{is based on the}} accuracy of the rectification and of the 3 D reconstruction which are directly related to the calibration precision. Three methods are thus compared: Faugeras-Toscani, Zhang and a robust calibration algorithm. The procedure can be applied for computer vision systems with an arbitrary number of cameras and for any other calibration method. We show that, although the three methods provide significantly different intrinsic and stereo system parameter estimations, the rectified images of the planar target that we use for evaluation are relatively coherent and lead to close 3 D reconstruction errors...|$|R

50|$|With {{multiple}} cameras it can {{be difficult}} to find a corresponding point viewed by one camera in the image of the other camera (known as the correspondence problem). In most camera configurations, finding correspondences requires a search in two-dimensions. However, if the two cameras are aligned correctly to be coplanar, the search is simplified to one dimension - a horizontal line parallel to the line between the cameras. Furthermore, if the location of a point in the left image is known, {{it can be}} searched for in the right image by searching left of this location along the line, and vice versa (see binocular disparity). <b>Image</b> <b>rectification</b> is an equivalent (and more often used) alternative to perfect camera alignment. Even with high-precision equipment, <b>image</b> <b>rectification</b> is usually performed because it may be impractical to maintain perfect alignment between cameras.|$|E

40|$|Introduction Given {{a pair of}} stereo <b>images,</b> <b>rectification</b> determines a {{transformation}} of each image plane such that pairs of conjugate epipolar lines become collinear and parallel {{to one of the}} image axes. The rectified images {{can be thought of as}} acquired by a new stereo rig, obtained by rotating the original cameras around the optical centre. The important advantage of rectification is that computing correspondences, a 2 -D search problem in general, is reduced to a 1 -D search problem, typically along the horizontal raster lines of the rectified images. A good starting point to explore the literature on rectification includes [1, 5, 6, 8, 4, 9]. After reviewing some concepts related to the pinhole camera model and the epipolar geometry, we will discuss in detail the process of rectification. 2 Camera model and epipolar geometry We assume prior knowledge of the projective camera model, and of the epipolar geometry.

40|$|The {{availability}} {{of data from}} sensors operating in several different wavelength regions had {{led to the development}} of new techniques and strategies for both data management and image analysis. Work is ongoing to develop computer techniques for analysis of integrated data sets. These techniques include coregistration of multisensor <b>images,</b> <b>rectification</b> of radar <b>images</b> in areas of topographic relief to ensure pixel to pixel registration with planimetric data sets, calibration of data so that signatures can be applied to remote areas, normalization of data acquired with disparate sensors and determination of extended spectral signatures of surface units. In addition, software is being developed to analyze coregistrated digital terrain and image data so that automated stratigraphic and structural analyses can be performed. These software procedures include: strike and dip determination, terrain profile generation, stratigraphic column generation, stratigraphic thickness measurements, structural cross-section generation, and creation of 3 -D block diagrams. These techniques were applied to coregistered LANDSAT 4 Thematic Mapper (TM), Thermal Infrared Multispectral Scanner (TIMS), and multipolarization synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data of the Wind River Basin in Wyoming...|$|R
50|$|For a human, {{the eyes}} change their angle {{according}} to {{the distance to the}} observed object. To a computer this represents significant extra complexity in the geometrical calculations (epipolar geometry). In fact the simplest geometrical case is when the camera image planes are on the same plane. The images may alternatively be converted by reprojection through a linear transformation {{to be on the same}} image plane. This is called <b>image</b> <b>rectification.</b>|$|E
50|$|Stereo images may {{not always}} be {{correctly}} aligned to allow for quick disparity calculation. For example, the set of cameras may be slightly rotated off level. Through a process known as <b>image</b> <b>rectification,</b> both images are rotated to allow for disparities in only the horizontal direction (i.e. there is no disparity in the y image coordinates). This is a property that can also be achieved by precise alignment of the stereo cameras before image capture.|$|E
50|$|In {{the field}} of {{computer}} vision, any two images of the same planar surface in space are related by a homography (assuming a pinhole camera model). This has many practical applications, such as <b>image</b> <b>rectification,</b> image registration, or computation of camera motion—rotation and translation—between two images. Once camera rotation and translation have been extracted from an estimated homography matrix, this information {{may be used for}} navigation, or to insert models of 3D objects into an image or video, so that they are rendered with the correct perspective and appear to {{have been part of the}} original scene (see Augmented reality).|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{proposes a}} {{real-time}} HD stereo <b>images</b> <b>rectification</b> hardware design architecture {{in order to}} remove vertical parallax of images caused by distortion within the cameras and alignment between them. After calculating calibration parameters of images using Matlab Toolbox designed by J. Y Bouguet as a prior step for the above purpose, the researcher designed rectification hardware based on the algorithms of Heikkilä and Silven. When stereo cameras are installed, it becomes difficult to find corresponding points owing to geometric errors between the cameras. However, in case corresponding points {{are located in the}} same line in two images, corresponding points can be found only in the line and therefore calculation becomes simple and errors are reduced. The line where the corresponding points are situated is called an epipolar line. In order to make the lines become an epipolar line, geometric image transformation technique called rectification should be used. Here, in order to heighten precision of result images, the researcher employed a floating point calculator generated using a core generator of Xilinx. Through this, it was verified that rectification hardware which has higher precision than other rectification hardware designed using a look-up table and which operates on a real-time basis may be designed...|$|R

50|$|Although in many {{applications}} <b>image</b> <b>rectification</b> can be performed, e.g. by camera resectioning or calibration, {{it is sometimes}} impossible or impractical since the computational cost of accurate rectification models prohibit their usage in real-time applications. Moreover, none of these models is suitable when a camera lens displays unexpected distortions, such as those generated by raindrops, weatherproof covers or dust. By extending the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm, {{a line in the}} ‘left’ image can be associated to a curve in the ‘right’ image by finding the alignment with the highest score in a three-dimensional array (or matrix). Experiments demonstrated that such extension allows dense pixel matching between unrectified or distorted images.|$|E
50|$|The epipolar {{geometry}} is simplified {{if the two}} camera image planes coincide. In this case, the epipolar lines also coincide (EL-PL = ER-PR). Furthermore, the epipolar {{lines are}} parallel to the line OL-OR between the centers of projection, and can in practice be aligned with the horizontal axes of the two images. This means that for each point in one image, its corresponding point in the other image can be found by looking only along a horizontal line. If the cameras cannot be positioned in this way, the image coordinates from the cameras may be transformed to emulate having a common image plane. This process is called <b>image</b> <b>rectification.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{emerging}} market of digital 3 -D film productions in HD resolution {{leads to the}} need for high-quality equipment in the production chain. The incoming video streams of the two cameras require an <b>image</b> <b>rectification</b> due to unavoidable misalignments within the stereoscopic camera setup. This rectification can either take place in postprocessing of the recorded material or it can be applied in real time during the shooting.

The proposed architecture has been realized on a prototyping system based on an Altera STRATIX EP 1 S 60 FPGA resulting in a performance of 35 frames per second for a 1024 × 1024 pixels input image. 2. INDRODUCTION Modern applications such as robot assembling automation, upcoming mobile robot platforms for homes, and car safety features require both, 3 D perception and object classification, for navigation and object manipulation [9]. Real-time performance of approximately 30 frames per second is mandatory and a very critical design issue. Em-bedded stereo vision sensors, consisting of a sensor head and a calculation unit, are very well suited for stereoscopic perception but require huge computational effort. Due to mounting tolerances within the sensor head, resulting in a maximum relative shift and revolution of these two camera <b>images,</b> <b>rectification</b> is absolutely necessary to reduce the matching effort. In our employed method it is done by applying a remap with offline calculated coefficients.

40|$|Title {{from first}} page of PDF file (viewed November 19, 2010) Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 74) The work for this thesis is to develop an <b>image</b> <b>rectification</b> application that performs automatic image ortho-rectification for images taken by the Rotomotion robotic UAV helicopter. The application also geo-references the images with the geo-location and attitude data for use in other geographic image system (GIS) software. This thesis is {{in support of the}} "Robotic Helicopter for Monitoring Pollution and Habitat Restoration at Tijuana Estuary" project, which goal is to build and test a robotic helicopter that can fly to locations at Tijuana Estuary that are too dangerous or sensitive to reach on foot or on a boat, and capture high-resolution, geo-referenced images for use in monitoring pollution and habitat condition. Although there are many image processing applications available that can perform <b>image</b> <b>rectification,</b> most are based on non-parametric methods, which require users to input reference control points for each image. In addition, the proprietary format of the Rotomotion data and the large number of image files call for the need of an automated application that can perform <b>image</b> <b>rectification</b> and image geo-reference. Hence, the automatic <b>image</b> <b>rectification</b> application in this thesis has been developed to resolve these problems. For this thesis, a parametric based ortho-rectification algorithm is developed. The algorithm models the attitude error of the robotic helicopter and rectifies the geometric distortions. This process uses the GPS geo-location data and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) attitude data obtained from the helicopter's onboard flight computer during flight. In addition to the algorithm development, a windows application has been developed by implementing the parametric ortho-rectification algorithm. The <b>image</b> <b>rectification</b> application is fully automated and can process multiple images without any user intervention. Finally, several test flights were conducted near the Tijuana Estuary to validate the performance of the robotic helicopter and <b>image</b> <b>rectification</b> applications. The application provided a modest improvement on the rectification of the images, due to sensor in-accuracy and timing synchronization of the system...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Stereo <b>image</b> <b>rectification</b> is a {{pre-processing}} step of disparity estimation {{intended to}} remove image distortions and to enable stereo matching along an epipolar line. A real-time disparity estimation system needs to perform real-time rectification which requires solving {{the models of}} lens distortions, image translations and rotations. Look-up-table based rectification algorithms allow <b>image</b> <b>rectification</b> without demanding high complexity operations. However, they require an external memory to store large size look-up-tables. In this work, we present an intermediate solution that compresses the rectification information to fit the look-up-table into the on-chip memory of a Virtex- 5 FPGA. The low-complexity de-compression process requires a negligible amount of hardware resources for its real-time implementation. The proposed <b>image</b> <b>rectification</b> hardware consumes 0. 28 % of the DFF and 0. 32 % of the LUT resources of the Virtex- 5 XCUVP- 110 T FPGA, it can process 347 frames per second for a 1024 × 768 pixels image resolution, {{and it does not}} need the availability of an external memory...|$|E
