50|$|Due to Fox {{consolidating}} its cable {{sports rights}} {{on the new}} <b>general-interest</b> <b>channels</b> Fox Sports 1 and Fox Sports 2, and following the loss of United States television rights to broadcast Premier League soccer events to NBC, Fox Soccer was replaced on September 2, 2013 by FXX, an entertainment sister network to FX. The {{vast majority of the}} remaining sports programming from Fox Soccer has been moved to Fox Sports 1 and Fox Sports 2, which launched on August 17, 2013. Fox Soccer Plus, a spin-off channel which launched in 2010, will continue to operate.|$|R

5000|$|All such {{services}} are specifically limited {{in regard to}} the types, and often the amount of said types, of programming that can be carried; the CRTC does not permit national <b>general-interest</b> cable-only <b>channels</b> in the style of USA Network or Turner Network Television. For instance, TSN can only air sports or sports-related programming, while Bravo cannot air any sports. This differs from the U.S., where several cable/satellite services such as USA or TNT regularly air programs from nearly all categories, and where there are no restrictions on [...] "specialty" [...] services in one category, such as news/opinion channel MSNBC, from airing programming from another category such as sports, as that particular service has on occasion.|$|R
