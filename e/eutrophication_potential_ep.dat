Recovery of cardboard, either as material or energy, is believed to reduce the impacts on the environment from the global warming point of view. European Union has been promoting recycling which resulted in recycling {{of the majority of}} well-separated cardboard. Published life cycle assessment studies show that recycling can provide the best benefits to the environment. However, some other studies argue that incineration with energy recovery would bring more credits. The technological data and system boundaries of the studies were proved to affect the outcome of the recovery methods studied. The present thesis was carried out assuming high technology data for both recycling and incineration with energy recovery. The main focus was on global warming potential (GWP), but also acidification (AP) and <b>eutrophication</b> <b>potentials</b> (<b>EP)</b> were taken into consideration. Results of all three impact categories supported the option of energy recovery had higher benefits compared to material recovery. Even though recycling could reduce the environmental burdens in GWP, this method resulted in additional impacts on AP and EP. Full replacement of virgin fibers could offer better results than partial substitution for GWP but it was opposite for AP and EP. Sensitivity analysis supported the superiority of energy recovery as the recovery method always reduced GWP, AP and EP. Performance of the recycling was not as steady as energy recovery. When electricity from natural gas or grid mix was substituted, energy recovery provides lower savings than in the baseline scenario...|$|R
40|$|This master {{thesis is}} {{investigating}} environmental performance of different alternatives for Combined Heat and Power (CHP) production from Natural Gas (NG) at Mongstad oil refinery. An important {{objective is to}} evaluate CHP plants with Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), {{and the performance of}} these compared to a conventional CHP without such application. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is the applied methodology for environmental assessment. The LCA results are used to inspect changes in eco-efficiency at the refinery with introduction of a CHP plant. Three CHP configurations have been assessed: 1. 	Conventional CHP 2. 	Conventional CHP with Post-Combustion (PC) CCS 3. 	Autothermal Reforming (ATR) plant; CHP with pre-combustion CCSThe three alternatives are denoted Conventional, PC and ATR in the following. Global Warming Potential (GWP) emissions per MWh exergy produced from the three CHP s are 56, 100 and 337 kg CO 2 -equvivalents for the PC, ATR and Conventional respectively. It is concluded that up-and downstream emissions do not undermine the environmental benefit of applying CCS regarding GWP impacts. The CCS systems have significantly higher impacts of Human Toxicity (HTP), Acidification (AP) and <b>Eutrophication</b> <b>Potentials</b> (<b>EP).</b> HTP impacts are over 50 % higher for CCS systems compared to Conventional. Increased NH 3 and NOx emissions make up much of the 100 - 150 % rise in AP and EP impacts. It is considered possible that flue gas handling can mitigate a substantial fraction of the increased AP and EP impacts. The system expansion reveal that building a Conventional CHP at Mongstad will not lead to global CO 2 reductions if it substitutes renewable electricity production. The CCS systems unreservedly give net global CO 2 reductions, disregarding alternative electricity production technology. The GWP eco-efficiency at Mongstad is defined as total LCA emissions from refinery output products divided by the economic value of the products. Introducing a CHP with CCS would significantly improve the eco-efficiency. Installing a Conventional plant, however, would deteriorate eco-efficiency. Installing a CHP with CCS is hence considered a significant step towards a sustainable development at Mongstad refinery. Given improved flue gas handling of NOx and NH 3, additional environmental effects are not considered to have potential of jeopardizing this conclusion...|$|R

Results indicate that farm B was more environmentally friendly than farm A with respect to all impact categories. The environmental impacts per kg product for farm A were between 12 % (GWP) and 85 % (EP) higher. It is suggested that farm A could improve its environmental performance by (i) replacing its organic fertiliser imported from the Netherlands by locally produced composts and (ii) increasing its yield per hectare.

As an example, we evaluated the life cycle energy use, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and aqueous nutrient releases of the whole anthropogenic municipal water cycle starting from raw water extraction to wastewater treatment and reuse/discharge for five municipal water and wastewater systems. The assessed options included conventional centralized services and four alternative options following the principles of source-separation and water fit-for-purpose. The comparative life cycle assessment identified that centralized drinking water supply coupled with blackwater energy recovery and on-site greywater treatment and reuse was the most energy- and carbon-efficient water service system evaluated, while the conventional (drinking water and sewerage) centralized system ranked as the most energy- and carbon-intensive system. The electricity generated from blackwater and food residuals co-digestion was estimated to offset at least 40 % of life cycle energy consumption for water/waste services.

The main differences between the environmental balances of the two systems were relative to water use, <b>eutrophication</b> <b>potential</b> and energy use. Independently of the system used, feed is the key indicator in determining the environmental balance (notwithstanding <b>eutrophication</b> <b>potential</b> and water dependence) monitored by fish production, chemical products, buildings and energy consumption. Consequently, when considering the RSF with a lower feed conversion ratio (0. 8 versus 1. 1 for FTF), the environmental balance of the RSF is more favourable at both global and regional levels, except with regards to energy use. RSF water dependence is 93 % lower than the FTF and its <b>eutrophication</b> <b>potential</b> is 26 - 38 % lower due to reduced waste release. On the other hand, at 57, 659 MJ per ton of fish produced (16 kWh per kg), the RSF consumes 24 - 40 % more energy than the FTF, especially for aeration and water treatment. Nevertheless, the RSF has significant potential for energy reduction through improvements to airlift and biofilter designs which would reduce RSF energy use to a level {{similar to that of}} the FTF (34, 869 - 43, 841 MJ per ton of fish produced, corresponding to 10 and 12 kWh respectively).

The tree crops are traditionally cultivated in two representative areas in Greece, namely Aegina island, Attica region, for pistachios and Agia, East Thessaly region, central Greece, for apples and almonds. The impact categories considered include global warming potential (GWP), <b>eutrophication</b> <b>potential</b> (<b>EP),</b> acidification potential (AP) and cumulative energy demand (CED). Based upon the results obtained, it is deduced that pistachios and almonds show minor differences for all impact categories considered, while apples exhibit the best environmental profile. The phases of fertilizers production, irrigation system and field management were identified as the main “hot-spots” for all crops, exhibiting the highest environmental impacts and energy consumption. A sensitivity analysis was performed to explore actions that can be considered at farm scale, such as water desalination for irrigation purposes, transition to organic production and use of renewable energy, in order to reduce water requirements and promote energy conservation, especially in semi-arid and arid Mediterranean regions which suffer from water shortage and are prone to salinization.

In that context, we present a life cycle assessment of a palm oil production process yielding both biodiesel and cooking oil, incorporating the land-use impact and evaluating the effect of treating the palm oil mill effluent (POME) prior to disposal. The {{results show that the}} nonrenewable energy requirement, global warming potential (GWP; exclusive land-use change), and acidification potential are lower than those of the fossil alternative. However, the system triggers an increase in <b>eutrophication</b> <b>potential</b> (<b>EP)</b> compared to the fossil fuel reference. This system shows less energy requirement, global warming and acidification reduction, and less eutrophication increase compared to the reference than the same system converting all palm oil into biodiesel (no cooking oil production). The land occupation of palm oil triggers ecosystem quality (EQ) loss of 30 - 45 % compared to the potential natural vegetation. Furthermore, such land-use change triggers a carbon debt neutralizing the GWP reduction for 45 - 53 years. The POME treatment scenarios reveal a trade-off between GWP and EP.

Life Cycle Assessment methodology {{was used to evaluate}} the potential environmental impact through the following indicators: <b>Eutrophication</b> <b>Potential,</b> Acidification Potential, Global Warming Potential, Net Primary Production Use and Non Renewable Energy Use. Two methods were used to assess the farm's nitrogen, phosphorus and solids emissions: nutrient measurement accounting and nutrient balance modelling. The two methods gave similar results for solids and phosphorus emissions, while for nitrogen the measurement-based approach resulted in half the emissions predicted by the model. The uncertainty regarding the potential gaseous nitrogen emissions led us to assess impacts according to three scenarios, differing with respect to emissions of N 2, N 2 O and NH 3. This approach illustrates that the uncertainty concerning nitrogenous emissions to the atmosphere leads to uncertainty with respect to the production system's <b>Eutrophication</b> <b>Potential</b> and its Global Warming Potential. The comparison of our results with similar results for large rainbow trout production in a flow-through system points out the impacts associated with the high level of energy consumption in the studied re-circulating system (i. e.

Data related to energy consumption, effluent water quality, and sludge production of various treatment processes were obtained from “Sewage Statistics ” published by the Japan Sewage Works Association. The conventional activated sludge (CAS) process and modified processes for nutrient removal were selected for analysis, such as anaerobic–oxic, recycled nitrification– denitrification, anaerobic-anoxic–oxic, nitrification/endogenous denitrification, and step-feed nitrification–denitrification processes. Performance of the treatment processes was evaluated as the <b>eutrophication</b> <b>potential</b> (<b>EP)</b> calculated from the BOD, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus concentrations in treated effluent and NOX emission by electricity consumption. The global warming potential (GWP) of treatment processes was calculated from CO 2, CH 4, and N 2 O emissions by electricity consumption, and N 2 O and CH 4 emissions from the biological processes and water environment where effluent is discharged.

The analytical framework included the definition of functional unit, system boundaries, complimentary system design, waste management, and partial use of the energy. Three different municipal solid waste management scenarios, incineration, composting, and digestion were considered for the study.

Greenhouse gas emissions and total environmental impacts were quantified and evaluated their corresponding benefits compared to three different types of marginal energy production system. The {{results showed that the}} major greenhouse gas carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide emissions are greater in composting scenario, whereas methane emission is greater in digestion scenario. Composting scenario that uses additional coal fuel has greater global warming potential and acidification potential compared to other scenarios. Composting scenario using wood fuel additional energy has greater <b>eutrophication</b> <b>potential.</b> The highest reduction in global warming potential is achieved when digestion scenario replace coal energy.

40|$|Nitrogen and {{phosphorus}} present in sewage {{can be used}} for microalgae growth, possibiliting cost reduction in the production of microalgae {{at the same time that}} it decreases the <b>eutrophication</b> <b>potential</b> of the effluent. This research aimed at monitoring the native community of microalgae and coliform bacteria in a secondary effluent from anaerobic municipal sewage treatment. Two treatments (aerated and non-aerated) were performed to grow microalgae under semi-controlled conditions in semi-closed photobioreactors in a greenhouse. The results showed no significant pH and coliforms (total and Escherichia coli) variation between treatments. Nutrient concentrations were reduced supporting microalgae growth up to 107 cells. mL− 1 independent of aeration. Exponential growth was obtained from the first day for the non-aerated, but a 5 day lag phase of growth was obtained for the aerated. Chlorella vulgaris was the dominant microalgae (99. 9 %) in both treatments. In the aerated, 5 algae classes were detected (Chlorophyceae, Cyanophyceae, Chrysophyceae, Bacillariophyceae and Euglenophyceae), with 12 taxa, whereas in the non-aerated, 2 classes were identified (Chlorophyceae and Cyanophyceae), with 5 taxa. We concluded that effluent is viable for microalgae growth, especially Chlorella vulgaris, at the same time that the <b>eutrophication</b> <b>potential</b> and coliforms are decreased, contributing for better quality of the final effluent...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a general {{model for the}} carbon footprints analysis of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), using a life cycle assessment (LCA) approach. In previous research, the issue of global warming is often related to traditional industries with high carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions, such as power plants and transportation. However, the analyses of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) have drawn increasing attention, due to the intensive greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) from WWTPs. WWTPs have been listed in the 7 th place for both methane (CH 4) and nitrous oxide (N 2 O) total emissions. In addition, WWTPs indirectly contribute to {{a huge amount of}} CO 2 emissions. The final results have shown {{that more than half of}} the carbon footprints from the La Gavia WWTP are from the indirect emissions of CO 2, which is caused by the intensive energy consumption. The direct emissions of CH 4 and N 2 O combined contribute more than 30 percent of GHG emission. The finally section of the thesis compares the environmental impacts of the La Gavia WWTP with case of no WWTP at all. It has been concluded that although the La Gavia WWTP increased the total carbon footprints, it has much better control of <b>eutrophication</b> <b>potential</b> (<b>EP).</b> by Bo Dong. Thesis (M.

40|$|Production of pork, {{the most}} {{consumed}} meat globally, {{is estimated to}} emit 668 m tonnes CO 2 -eq of greenhouse gases each year. Amongst various production systems that comprise the pig industry, grainbased intensive production {{is widely regarded as}} the largest polluter of the environment, and thus it is imperative to develop alternative systems that can provide the right balance between sustainability and food security. Using an original dataset from the Republic of Ireland, this paper examines the life-cycle environmental impacts of representative pig farms operating under varying production efficiencies. For the baseline farm with an average production efficiency, global warming potential (GWP), acidifi- cation potential (AP) and <b>eutrophication</b> <b>potential</b> (<b>EP)</b> per kg carcass weight departing the slaughterhouse were estimated to be 3. 5 kg CO 2 -eq, 43. 8 g SO 2 -eq and 32. 1 g PO 4 -eq, respectively. For herds with a higher production efficiency, a 9 % improvement in feed conversion ratio was met by 6 %, 15 % and 12 % decreases in GWP, EP, AP, respectively. Scenario and sensitivity analyses also revealed that (a) a switch to high-protein diets results in lower GWP and higher AP and EP, and (b) reducing transportation distances by sourcing domestically produced wheat and barley does not lower environmental impacts in any notable manner. To improve cross-study comparability of these findings, results based on an auxiliary functional unit, kg liveweight departing the farm gate, are also reported...|$|E
40|$|A {{life cycle}} {{assessment}} (LCA) study was carried out to evaluate the environmental implications of the production and use of ethanol from three fast-growing wood crops: eucalyptus, black locust and poplar in flexi-fuel vehicles. The production of a blend rich in ethanol: E 85 (85 % ethanol and 15 % gasoline by volume) was assessed and the results {{compared with those of}} conventional gasoline (CG) in an equivalent car. The following environmental categories were evaluated: fossil fuels use (FF), global warming potential over 100 years (GWP 100), photochemical oxidant creation potential (POCP), acidification potential (AP) and <b>eutrophication</b> <b>potential</b> (<b>EP).</b> The use of ethanol derived from black locust was found to be the option with the lowest impact in most categories with reductions of 97 %, 42 %, 41 % and 76 % for GWP 100, AP, EP and FF respectively in comparison with CG. Concerning the production stage of ethanol (excluding the stages of blending and use), black locust has the lowest environmental impacts due to the low levels of agricultural inputs during its cultivation. The poplar scenario has higher impacts in AP and EP due to the emission of diffuse substances from fertilizer application and the eucalyptus scenario in GWP 100, POCP and FF due to the use and requirements of heavy machinery during harvesting. The use of the LCA methodology has helped to identify the key areas in the life cycle of ethanol. Special attention should be paid to ethanol production related activities and forest activities oriented to the feedstock production. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd...|$|E
30|$|Overall results, and, in particular, {{those of}} the {{indicators}} global warming <b>potentials,</b> <b>eutrophication</b> <b>potential</b> and human health carcinogenic, are being dominated by those environmental impacts relating to the use stage. These are caused by the impacts of the share of electricity, which is stored, but not being fed back because of efficiency losses and internal energy requirements of the installations. This means that the system efficiency and internal energy requirement of the examined technologies are crucial for the overall result, as they define electricity ‘lost’ in the 80  year use stage.|$|R
30|$|Impacts of {{decommissioning}} {{and disposal}} are barely visible. Impacts of the operational stage (“use stage”) dominate {{those of the}} production stage in all categories except for cumulative energy demand. Especially, the categories global warming <b>potential,</b> <b>eutrophication</b> <b>potential,</b> and human health carcinogenic show only a small contribution of the production stage to overall impacts.

These losses depend on efficiency losses and internal energy demands of the installations.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis review aims {{to give an}} {{overview}} of published environmental assessments using the life cycle assessment (LCA) approach. LCA was deployed in terms of five main subsystems in the poultry meat chain: poultry farm, slaughterhouse, meat processing plant, retail and household use. This review revealed that 15 different environmental potentials are used as environmental indicators for estimating environmental performance of the poultry meat chain. General finding is that further research should use the LCA approach to assess the environmental performance of an overall poultry meat chain, focusing on the global warming <b>potential,</b> acidification <b>potential,</b> <b>eutrophication</b> <b>potential</b> and ozone layer depletion...|$|R
