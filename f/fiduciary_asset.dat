50|$|Beyond outsourcing, {{pension fund}} {{investment}} teams have occasionally grown {{to take in}} other, unrelated, assets. Previously the Weyerhauser/Morgan Stanley and General Motors Asset Management examples were noted. Other examples include Owens-Illinois, General Electric and American Airlines. In 1987 Owens-Illinois’ investment management subsidiary, Harbor Capital Advisors, launched five mutual funds targeting defined contribution plans. American Airlines’ AMR Investment Services (now called Beacon Funds) has its own family of mutual fund products. GE Investments {{offers a variety of}} funds to others in addition to managing mutual funds. <b>Fiduciary</b> <b>Asset</b> Management, one of the early total plan outsourcers, instead of taking on additional outsourcing clients, created a team that invests in master limited partnership and now manages nearly $4 billion in external capital. <b>Fiduciary</b> <b>Asset</b> Management was previously owned by Piper Jaffray.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the first}} {{institutional}} scale investment outsourcing arrangements occurred in 1986. Three investment managers {{who had worked for}} IBM’s pension fund left the company and formed SASCO Capital. They managed a portion of the IBM pension plan but IBM also kept {{a large portion of the}} assets and investment team in-house. Another early example of pension fund investment outsourcing involved General Dynamics. In November 1994 General Dynamics became the first client when its treasurer formed a new outsourced investment firm, <b>Fiduciary</b> <b>Asset</b> Management. At the time of General Dynamics’ initial allocation, this was a $2.5 billion mandate. In 2001 another of the early large pension outsourcing arrangements occurred when Xerox hired General Motors Asset Management (GMAM) to manage its $4 billion defined pension plan. This move was prompted, in part, by the departure of two senior Xerox professionals to run other investment plans. As part of the arrangement, Xerox’s chief investment officer joined GMAM. Following GM’s bankruptcy, in 2010 Xerox took back the management of its pension assets.|$|E

That given, {{the application of the}} independent lien also offers much greater opportunities, such as for example the potential to combine it with the institution of <b>fiduciary</b> <b>asset</b> management and thereby offer new refinancing techniques to the Hungarian banking sector...|$|E

40|$|Corporate {{governance}} codes {{have been}} drafted to guide listed companies to improve corporate governance. Shareholders, in particular institutional investors, {{are being asked}} to {{play a critical role in}} safeguarding good corporate governance. However, addressing shareholders of Dutch listed companies through the Dutch Corporate Governance Code and describing their responsibilities as active owners has not so far resulted in a broad range of engagement of institutional investors with investee companies. This is possibly because there is a misalignment of key assumptions underlying the Dutch Code with actual capital market practices. Driven by those practices, institutional investors are first and foremost concerned with maximizing the returns on their investments. Enforcing institutional investors to take responsibility in improving corporate governance cannot be done through laws and codes alone. Passing laws and codes is one thing and enforcing them – and even inspiring buy in on the part of those they are aimed at – is something entirely different. Ultimately, enforceability is about the value that ultimate beneficiaries of institutional investors place on ‘stewardship’, and hold their (<b>fiduciary)</b> <b>asset</b> manager accountable for. This paper is a call to reconsider the ultimate function of corporate governance codes in a context of international capital market practice in which codes can never be a goal in itself, but more a means for improving corporate governance around the world...|$|E
40|$|The {{fiduciary}} guarantee {{agency is}} very helpful for the smoothness of business {{managed by the}} debtor, because the goods used as security for the repayment of its debts remains in its power. Fiduciary guarantee {{is a part of}} the material law, so the principles of material law must be adopted in the legal rules of the fiduciary guarantee agency, which is currently regulated in Act No. 42 / 1999, but this law needs to be revised, especially in relation to the registration of fiduciary collateral, fiduciary execution and the possibility of whether or not <b>fiduciary</b> <b>assets</b> should be used as a fiduciary guarantee again...|$|R

5000|$|We {{did what}} we thought was right. We felt like we had an {{obligation}}. Some people may feel like you can walk away from your contracts. We had an obligation to these people. Robert Rowling, UTIMCO Chairman In February 2009, UTIMCO drew criticism from the state's legislative and executive branches for awarding bonuses to employees despite the global financial crisis of 2008-2009. Robert Rowling, chairman of UTIMCO and vice chairman of the UT Austin Board of Regents, insisted that the bonuses he authorized were for the fiscal year ending 31 July 2008, in which the PUF net <b>fiduciary</b> <b>assets</b> decreased by 3.26%, or $383 million, as compared to nearly 14% for the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The Chairman of the Board of Regents defended Rowling, stating that the contracts obligated bonus payment and the large amounts, $1.05 million for the UTIMCO CEO and $2.3 million for other employees combined, were fairly inflexible.|$|R
40|$|The {{institutional}} asset-management {{industry is}} likely {{to be one of the}} largest and most dynamic parts of the global financial services sector in the years ahead. As of 1996, the global total of assets under management was estimated at close to $ 30 trillion, comprising some $ 8. 2 trillion in pension fund assets, about $ 5. 3 trillion in mutual fund assets, $ 6. 4 trillion in <b>fiduciary</b> <b>assets</b> controlled by insurance companies, and perhaps $ 7. 5 trillion in offshore private client assets. 2 Not only will this already massive industry experience an extraordinary rate of growth in comparison with other segments of the financial services sector, but cross-border volume C both regional and global C {{is likely to}} take an increasing share of that activity. Much of the action will be centered in Europe, which remains well behind the United States in institutional asset management and where many of the global pension problems reside, even as the rapid growth of performance- oriented managed funds alter the European financial landscape under EMU C including traditional approached to corporate control.

40|$|The modern {{institutional}} trustee in its incarnation {{as majority}} owner of American business has {{conflicts of interest}} of debilitating proportions. Notwithstanding the inveterate and unchanging rigour of trust law requiring the <b>fiduciary</b> to administer <b>assets</b> "for the exclusive benefit of plan participants", today's conglomerate - understandably enough {{in a world where}} there is no enforcement - persistently favours its own interest in pleasing present and potential customers. There has been no enforcement of breach of fiduciary obligations either by the executive or judicial branches of government. In light of the trend of some courts towards the Law & Economics policy of "efficient compliance", there must be some doubt as to whether courts will require compliance with trust law.

40|$|Modern {{portfolio}} {{theory is}} no longer quite the safe harbor for fiduciaries making investment decisions that it once was (Hawley et al. 2011). One {{reason for this is}} the prolonged uncertainty in the financial markets that was mentioned by chairman Bernanke in 2010 and which still seems to be with us two years (at the time of writing) down the line. In such an environment, the pension fiduciary faces both the external pressures stemming from a prolonged uncertain investment outlook, and the internal pressures stemming from employers and participants reacting to economic uncertainty and voicing their concerns related to the investment of pension <b>assets.</b> <b>Fiduciaries</b> have a duty to balance the interests of their different participant groups, and understanding the perspectives of those beneficiaries is critical to successful implementation of fiduciary obligations (Hawley et al. 2011; Berry and Scanlan 2014). From a practical perspective, unrecognized stakeholder expectations can pose risks to follow-through on implementation of investment strategies. How should the pension fiduciary act when the expected correlations among asset classes fail to materialize? How should the pension fiduciary interpret the apparently mixed signals from plan sponsors whose reactions to the sudden exposure to significant unfunded liabilities range all the way from derisking (by shifting more plan assets into fixed income investments) to seeking higher expected returns (by increasing the plan's exposure to hedge funds and private equities) ? What is the framework for making asset allocation decisions in such an environment...|$|R
