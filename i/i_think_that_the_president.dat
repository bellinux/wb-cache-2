60|$|ELIZABETH [When {{she likes}} {{she can be}} quite sweet.] Your wife. [He {{expected}} it.] We rather assumed [she appeals to the others with a gesture], <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> of the Man's League for the Extension of the Franchise to Women would regard it as a compliment.|$|E
60|$|MR. ROBERTS (timidly {{indicating}} a berth). <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> <b>the</b> one.|$|R
60|$|HIGGINS [as {{he shuts}} the last drawer] Well, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> <b>the</b> whole show.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{tears came}} then, {{but it was}} small wonder. There were tears in her eyes, too.|$|R
5000|$|In late June 2013, Former US President Jimmy Carter said: [...] "He's {{obviously}} {{violated the}} laws of America, for which he's responsible, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> the invasion {{of human rights and}} American privacy has gone too far ... <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> secrecy <b>that</b> has been surrounding this invasion of privacy has been excessive, so <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> bringing of it to the public notice has probably been, in the long term, beneficial." ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Root of the Wind is Water (2011): for computer-realized sound. Commissioned by the American Academy in Rome.|$|R
60|$|THE JUDGE. [Speaking to the reporters] Gentlemen of <b>the</b> Press, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> name of {{the female}} witness should not be reported.|$|R
6000|$|... "When {{they come}} {{we will talk}} of it, but <b>I</b> do not <b>think</b> <b>that</b> they will come; <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> sea has {{swallowed}} them all." ...|$|R
6000|$|By <b>the</b> way, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> villagers {{recognised}} {{this good}} lady's vinegary nature. At least, {{they used to}} call her [...] "Sour Sal." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly, Miss Thurwell. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> gentleman {{calling himself}} Mr. Brown will {{find himself in}} the murderer's dock before a month is out." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Her {{singing is}} exquisite. But {{her voice is}} not suited to <b>the</b> stage. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> artist's life has been made repugnant to her." ...|$|R
60|$|Is {{it because}} he has {{captured}} <b>the</b> takingest name? <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> that {{is only a small}} part of it. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> secret of his high prosperity lies elsewhere.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is, indeed," [...] I replied, [...] "a most dreary region. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> gorillas {{will not}} be {{disturbed}} by many hunters with white faces." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well, master. Then <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> risk will be {{less with}} the robbers, {{especially}} as we have not apparently much worth stealing upon us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then, there's {{the other}} explanation. It's simply <b>that</b> <b>the</b> girl's life hasn't {{affected}} her. Somehow, she has kept fresh and wholesome. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> <b>the</b> correct view." ...|$|R
30|$|I don’t {{know whether}} the guy is {{a man or a}} woman, but (based on some {{evidence}} or observations,) <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> guy is a man.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{said another}} dignitary, [...] "only <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{undertaking}} must be {{looked upon as}} conditional. I understand, well, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> money belongs to Mrs. Bull." ...|$|R
5|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> band went on... {{maybe not}} a tangent, {{but we had}} a goal in mind, {{and at the end of}} the {{recording}} process, we were so proud of how artistic we were. And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> we showed too much. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> maybe we were a little too jaded and a little too dark, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> lack of hope and faith that we put on this record made us a little less sparkly and light to people. But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> it's all part of our evolution. We all went a bit too far.|$|R
2500|$|... "Personally, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{unique and}} supreme delight {{lies in the}} {{certainty}} of doing 'evil'–and men and women know from birth that all pleasure lies in evil." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> <b>the</b> nicest {{thing you}} ever said to me! Only, of course, I {{should like to}} think I'm more of the Greek type--pagan, you know." ...|$|R
3000|$|... “Even if <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> clothes {{look nice}} on me, I ask {{the people who}} {{accompany}} me to inspect whether they see what I see (Participant B).” [...]...|$|R
6000|$|And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{moral of}} all, you'll say, [...] Is <b>the</b> {{sculptured}} legend <b>that</b> moulds away [...] On a tomb in the choir: [...] "Por el Rey." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Forrest," [...] he said, [...] "I cannot {{stand it}} any longer. This place is sending me mad. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{best thing we}} can do is to chuck it." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> bulk {{of those}} details {{can be found}} in Olive Schreiner's books, and she would not be accused of {{sketching}} the Boer's portrait with an unfair hand.|$|R
6000|$|On the {{threshold}} Martin stopped, and {{looking over his}} shoulder said, [...] "Master, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Heer is dead, do you still wish me to put him into the street?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘But for Mr. Honeythunder’s eloquence, I {{might have}} {{had no need to}} ask you what I am going to ask you. This Mr. Edwin Drood, sir: <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that’s</b> <b>the</b> name?’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Weel, weel, weel," [...] {{replied the}} domestic, {{somewhat}} embarrassed, {{in spite of}} his effrontery--"though <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> sort of truth that serves my master, may weel serve ony ane else." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Harry, my friend, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> <b>the</b> last of them [...] . . ." [...] said Wessex lightly as {{he finally}} put up {{his sword and}} mounted {{the steps to the}} platform.|$|R
5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> Rick Ross is resilient, and Meek Mill {{is a new}} hot rapper, who's really hot, one of my {{favorite}} new hip hop artists. Rick Ross, who's always been one of {{my favorite}}s, he's resilient. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that,</b> through <b>the</b> years, people try to count him out, and he always comes back, comes back harder, comes back with bigger and better records. So <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> theme of 'Triumphant,' <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> he fits <b>the</b> theme of <b>that</b> whole concept <b>the</b> best, really, because through it all, Rick Ross always comes out on top.|$|R
5000|$|... "Did <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> song would live? Yes, {{the last}} line shows I did: [...] "This song shall be our parting hymn". I hesitated a {{considerable}} time over this last line.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay, {{but certain}} {{of them are}} brought hither for burial. It is the {{privilege}} of the rulers of Kaloon; also, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Khania has questions to ask of its Oracle." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Be not so sure," [...] he answered, [...] "for <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Power follows us even {{down this}} dark gulf of death. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> also <b>that</b> <b>I</b> feel <b>the</b> sleepless eyes of Hes {{watching}} our secret souls." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{can imagine}} now," [...] he said, [...] "what I have been suffering. The desire for action {{sometimes}} is almost maddening. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> man who sits and waits has the hardest task." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Aaron's {{the man as}} bides in it," [...] Tommy {{continued}} hastily, [...] "at least <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> <b>the</b> name. Well, as you ken the house, you've maybe {{noticed a}} laddie that bides there too?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{in such a}} peace," [...] {{said her}} companion, with a firm voice, [...] "Miss Bellenden would not wish, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{interests}} of the people were sacrificed unreservedly {{to those of the}} crown?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Dearest, sweetest Miss Mountain!' says I. 'Oh, could <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> parting from me {{has brought}} tears to those lovely eyes! Indeed, I fear, I should be almost happy! Let them look upon your----' ...|$|R
