40|$|This {{project is}} {{a study of the}} unique {{linguistic}} situation in Norway. They have two official written languages namely, Nynorsk and Bokmål.

By applying sociolinguistic theories of language planning to the historical background of the two founders, the project will explain how the two languages were planned. The project shows that the linguistic <b>future</b> in Norway <b>will</b> most likely contain both languages due to the cultural significance that Nynorsk holds in Norway.

30|$|Most studies {{claim to}} know what China’s <b>future</b> <b>will</b> <b>look</b> like. As judging {{statements}} about the future to separate the true from the false ones is impossible, the loudest voice among different scientific studies about China’s future can create an illusion of knowledge. Such illusions sometimes have ideological traits {{so that they can}} “manifest themselves in, or underlie, the thought, speech, aims, interests, ideals, ethical standards, actions – in short, the behaviour – of an individual human being.“[4, 5]. Hence, the illusion of knowledge in thinking about future is a serious problem, especially because it affects the way we plan and act strategically to shape the future, for instance in foreign policy.|$|R

Not only do {{entrepreneurs}} have an {{idea that}} they must implemented, {{they know how to}} implement it and are realistic in the vision of implementing it. Drayton says that, [...] "Entrepreneurs have in their heads the vision of how society will be different when their idea is at work, and they can't stop until that idea is not only at work in one place, but is at work across the whole society." [...] This manifests through a clear idea of what they believe the <b>future</b> <b>will</b> <b>look</b> and a drive to make this come true. Besides this, entrepreneurs are not happy with the status quo; they want healthy change.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Two {{recently}} published books outline the main {{issues of the}} current debate on lexi-cography. The first, e-Lexicography edited by Fuertes-Olivera and Bergenholtz in 2011, presents the standpoints of the lexicographical function theory on the future developments of dictionaries, while, in some chapters, current innovative tools are described, tools which allow customizations according to the user's type of need. The second volume, Electronic Lexicography edited by Granger and Paquot in 2012, presents different opposing views on what the dictionaries of the <b>future</b> <b>will</b> <b>look</b> like, such as the linguistic-oriented stance of Hanks and that of Tarp concerning theoretical lexicography. The dictionary projects that are described within these pages offer an interesting basis of comparison with those developed by {{the representatives of the}} function theory...|$|R

The discipline of demand planning, also sometimes referred to as supply chain forecasting, embraces both statistical forecasting and a consensus process. An important, albeit often ignored aspect of forecasting, is the relationship it holds with planning. Forecasting can be described as predicting what the <b>future</b> <b>will</b> <b>look</b> like, whereas planning predicts what the future should look like. There is no single right forecasting method to use. Selection of a method should be based on your objectives and your conditions (data etc.).

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. The Navy is aggressively pursuing a capability for Fleet units to combine intelligence information into one common picture {{to allow for}} rapid correlation of multiple pieces of intelligence. This capability would contribute significantly to reducing the "sensor-to-shooter" timeline and significantly {{increase the likelihood of}} correctly classifying and striking a contact of interest. This capability {{comes in the form of}} a program called Joint Fires Network (JFN) and the concept was forged through several Fleet Battle Experiments (FBEs) as well as lessons learned from the Persian Gulf War. The objective of this thesis is to examine JFN within the Department of Defense's ISR architecture of the <b>future.</b> It <b>will</b> <b>look</b> at what is envisioned for the future of DoD's ISR systems and how well JFN will function as both a customer and provider of ISR information within a Joint Force architecture. This thesis uses the ISR Integrated Capstone Strategic Plan (ISR-ICSP) developed by the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence (C 3 I) as the foundation for what DoD's ISR architecture of the <b>future</b> <b>will</b> <b>look</b> like. This thesis looks at the Operational and System Level Architectures spelled out in this document and examines the Navy's stated requirements and existing programs which comprise JFN.
