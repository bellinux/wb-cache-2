30|$|The {{increasing}} use {{of silver}} compounds and silver-containing preparations in the industry such as disinfectants and photographic films has resulted in an increased silver content of environmental samples (<b>Kolthoff</b> <b>and</b> Elving 1966; Meian 1991). Thus, accurate determination of trace quantities of silver ions by simple methods is important in chemical and environmental analysis. Direct determination of silver ions of trace level is usually very limited due {{to the complexity of}} the sample matrix and the low concentrations of silver ions; therefore, there is a crucial need for the extraction and preconcentration of this element from the sample matrix before its analysis using atomic absorption spectrometry (Xie et al. 2005). The most widely used techniques for separation and preconcentration of trace amounts of silver ions are coprecipitation (Mao et al. 1998), solid-phase extraction (SPE) (Rofouei et al. 2009; Shamsipur et al. 2002; Safavi et al. 2004; Khayatian and Hassanpoor 2012 a), liquid–liquid extraction (LLE) (Koh and Sugimoto 1996), and cloud point extraction (CPE) (Manzoori et al. 2007 and Dalali et al. 2008). However, most of these methods are laborious, time-consuming, and require large volumes of toxic organic solvents.|$|R
40|$|Most {{methods for}} the {{colorimetric}} estimation of sodium {{depend upon the}} pre-cipitation of the metal as sodium zinc uranyl acetate, a reaction first proposed by Barber <b>and</b> <b>Kolthoff</b> (1928). The precipitated salt, after washing, is treated in various ways to give coloured solutions. There are thus three distinct stages which {{have to be considered}} in the estimation: (1) precipitation, (2) washing of the precipitate, and (3) final colour. Precipitation of Sodium Zinc Uranyl Acetate Among the precipitating reagents used are a 50 % alcoholic solution (McCance and Shipp, 1931), and aqueous solutions (Barber <b>and</b> <b>Kolthoff,</b> 1928; Butler <b>and</b> Tuthill, 1931; Weinbach, 1935) of zinc uranyl acetate, all in the presence of acetic acid. The triple salt is precipitated in a number of ways. McCance and Shipp (1931) treated 1 part of aqueous sodium solution with 10 parts of alcoholic zinc uranyl acetate at 00 C. for one hour, while Albanese and Lein (1948) used 1 to 4 parts of aqueous sodium solution and 10 parts of alcoholic reagent at 40 C. for 1 hour.

40|$|The {{ionization}} equilibria of dicarboxylic acids {{measured by}} K_ 1 /K_ 2 {{are expected to}} be substantially influenced by stabilization of the monoanion through intramolecular hydrogen bonding. However, except in sterically favorable cases, such as with maleic, 3, 4 -furandicarboxylic, 2, 3 -bicyclo[1. 2. 2]heptadienedicarboxylic and diethylmalonic acids, the K_ 1 /K_ 2 values for other dicarboxylic acids, where intramolecular hydrogen bonding of the monoanion might be expected, are relatively small at ∼ 100 in water. This research uses NMR to corroborate and extend the pioneering conductance measurements of K_ 1 /K_ 2 of dicarboxylic acids by <b>Kolthoff</b> <b>and</b> coworkers with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as solvent. In extending these measurements, we have determined K_ 1 /K_ 2 for 3, 4 -furandicarboxylic (1) and, 3 -bicyclo[1. 2. 2]heptadienedicarboxylic (2) acids, because these were predicted by McCoy to be especially sterically favorable for intramolecular hydrogen bonding in the form of their monoanions and, indeed, we have found K_ 1 /K_ 2 values for these acids in DMSO of 1  ×  10 ^(15) and 4  ×  10 ^(16) respectively.

40|$|The {{condensation}} of retinene 1 with opsin to form rhodopsin is optimal at pH about 6, a pH which {{favors the}} condensation of retinene 1 with sulfhydryl {{rather than with}} amino groups. The synthesis of rhodopsin, though unaffected by the less powerful sulfhydryl reagents, monoiodoacetic acid and its amide, is inhibited completely by p-chloromercuribenzoate (PCMB). This inhibition is reversed {{in part by the}} addition of glutathione. PCMB does not attack rhodopsin itself, nor does it react with retinene 1. Its action in this system is confined to the —SH groups of opsin. Under some conditions the synthesis of rhodopsin is aided by the presence of such a sulfhydryl compound as glutathione, which helps to keep the —SH groups of opsin free and reduced. By means of the amperometric silver titration of <b>Kolthoff</b> <b>and</b> Harris, it is shown that sulfhydryl groups are liberated in the bleaching of rhodopsin, two such groups for each retinene 1 molecule that appears. This is true equally of rhodopsin from the retinas of cattle, frogs) and squid. The exposure of new sulfhydryl groups adds an important element to the growing evidence that relates the bleaching of rhodopsin to protein denaturation. The place of sulfhydryl groups in the structure of rhodopsin is still uncertain. They may be concerned directly in binding the chromophore to opsin; or alternatively they may furnish hydrogen atoms for some reductive change by which the chromophore is formed from retinene 1. In the amperometric silver titration, the bleaching of rhodopsin yields directly an electrical variation. This phenomenon may have some fundamental connection with the role of rhodopsin in visual excitation, and may provide a model of the excitation process in general...|$|R

40|$|Thyroid hormones (TH) {{are prime}} {{molecular}} switches of endocrine pathways regulating cell metabolism, proliferation and differentiation. After entering the cell through TH-specific trans-membrane transporters (THTT), THs bind {{to their respective}} nuclear TH-receptor to alter the gene-expression pattern accordingly. Structural and mechanistic disparities in THTTs impede essential endocrine mechanisms, e. g. patients with inherited dysfunctional THTTs suffer from differently pronounced psychomotor retardation and muscular hypotonia (Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome). Likewise, {{it is crucial to}} disclose substances with effects on the functionality of THTTs (i. e. endocrine disruptors). These endocrine disruptors might impair the complex Hypothalamus-Hypophysis-Thyroid Axis, as observed with cancer patients who were treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors, e. g. Dasatinib. Currently, techniques used to study the functionality of THTTs employ radioactively labeled substrates that require special expertise and lab facilities with higher safety standards. Further, corresponding regulatory and disposal issues delay the experimental planning extensively. These drawbacks are not encountered with the newly introduced nonradioactive approach that implements the chemical reaction described by Izaak <b>Kolthoff</b> <b>and</b> Ernest Sandell in the 1930 s. Precisely because iodides catalyze this reaction, the uptake of any iodine-containing THTT substrate can be quantified by a colorimetric read-out, thus facilitates label-independent iodine-detection. For the validation of the non-radiometric method, we monitored the Monocarboxylate Transporter 8 (MCT 8) -mediated T 3 uptake in a physiological (primary murine astrocytes) and genetically modified cell model (MCT 8 -(overexpressing) MDCK- 1 cells), subsequently re-evaluating these setups with the radiometric method. In parallel, we elucidated the kinetics of the transporter-specific inhibitor Bromosulphthalein and confirmed the MCT 8 -specific substrate spectrum in MCT 8 -MDCK- 1 cells. Successively, all experimental setups underlined that the new methodology holds a great capability to deliver consistent and reproducible data that additionally aligned to radiometric assay results. Despite we observed assay sensitivity being finite, it is yet sufficient for an initial and simple functional testing of THTTs. The initial data obtained can then be verified in follow-up experiments applying orthogonal methods, e. g. LC-MS/MS. In summary, this work introduces a label-independent non-radiometric methodology that assists in characterizing essential aspects of THTTs. The recyclable reaction educts and technical advantages of the assay improved experimental handling, and extensively reduced workload, laboratory and material costs. Hence, this methodology encourages fast, initial functional testing of further THTTs, particularly in laboratories with restricted finances, expertise and facilities. By having minimized the non-radioactive assay format onto 96 -wells microtiter plates, the next goal is to explore its applicability in high-throughput screenings of compound libraries for THTT-specific endocrine disruptors...|$|R

40|$|There {{has been}} a well {{recognized}} need for an adequate method of measuring oxygen tension in small volumes during short time intervals without disturbing movement and without toxicity to living cells. Conventional polaro-. graphic technique provides the kind of data desired, but its dropping mercury electrode obviously fails to meet the requirements. The static platinum electrode {{has been used in}} polarographic analysis (Laitenen <b>and</b> <b>Kolthoff,</b> 1942) but a number of difficulties are encountered: (1) the long time required for observation, (2) instability, and (3) lack of reproducibility. In biological application of this electrode, Davies and Brink (1942) reported a day-to-day variability of 30 per cent and Roseman, Goodwin, and McCuUoch (1946) interpret only relative values for oxygen. The recessed electrode used by Davies and Brink improves the stability and reproducibility, but imposes a long time for restoration between successive observations. The rotating platinum electrode employed by Laitenen <b>and</b> <b>Kolthoff</b> (1942), though improving stability, not only introduces disturbing movement but lacks reproducibility. In like manner the flow system of Gigu~re and Lanzier (1945) imposes similar restrictions. In this investigation the possibility has been explored of overcoming the difficulties attendant {{on the use of the}} open, static platinum electrode through the employment of a suitable pattern of alternating potential with techniques arising from a special consideration of the time aspects involved. Because a good many other investigators have considered the possibility of an alternating potential, our observations over a wide range of frequency and pattern will be reported as well as the choice which has yielded the most satisfactory results.

40|$|In some {{preliminary}} polarographic experiments {{carried out in}} this laboratory with Dr. R. F.

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston UniversityIt {{has been}} {{reported}} in the literature that metals of the VIII group showed a catalytic effect on the discharge of hydrogen, giving rise to polarographic waves at less negative potentials. The case of platinum has been studied in detail and {{it was found that the}} waves were roughly proportional to the amount of the metal in solution. It was also observed that their heights depend on the concentration of the acid solution. Heyn found that if platinum was complexed with fluoride better waves were obtained that seemed to be linearly dependent on the concentration of the metal. West, Dean, and Breda showed the polarographic behavior of several ions including iridium and rhodium, using sodium fluoride as supporting electrolyte. No mention is made of the action of the other metals of the group. The aim of this research was to make a fundamental study of the polarographic behavior of the VIII b group metals, when complexed as fluorides. In the event that waves of analytical significance were obtained for any of the metals a quantitative method would be established. Only platinum and osmium gave waves of possible significance and an analytical method was developed for them, using the height of the catalytic waves obtained. Rhodium, iridium, ruthenium, and palladium showed erratic polarographic behavior under the conditions studied. The explanation for this failure in catalyzing the hydrogen evolution is attributed to formation of unreactive complexes of these metals with fluorides. The waves obtained for platinum in the preliminary experiments needed some improvements, in order to have analytical application. Three major drawbacks were observed: 1. the waves were not reproducible; 2. the wave heights were not linearly proportional to the concentration of platinum; 3. waves were characterized by erratic pen oscillations, making the accurate determination of the plateau very difficult. The variables that could have influence on the waves, such as effect of bubbling time of nitrogen, influence of the height of mercury column and concentration of fluoride were studied. The results led to a proposed method (see p. 23) which is much more sensitive than would be expected for a simple polarographic reduction due to the catalytic action of platinum. The presence of other platinum group metals which are not catalytically active masks the catalytic action of platinum and therefore interferes in its determination. Osmium in acid solution is known to react with the mercury of the cathode and therefore gives irreproducible waves. In an acetate buffer, <b>Kolthoff</b> <b>and</b> Perry reported that a quantitative method of restricted application was obtained. A special technique was employed to measure the current: a quick measurement was made at the potential corresponding to the maximum of the wave, and by comparison with a curve obtained with standard solutions the concentration at osmium was found. It was confirmed in this research that a reaction takes place between mercury and osmium tetroxyde in hydrochloric acid solution. But if osmium is complexed with fluoride, fairly good waves are obtained and a quantitative method could be set up. The polarograms have to be recorded as soon as the electrode is dipped into solution. If subsequent polarograms are run, with the same solution the height of the wave is found to be smaller. A precipitate appears in the solution after sometime and black specks, presumably osmium, are found on the surface of the mercury. The reaction mentioned above can be detected on the polarogram by an abrupt change on the shape of the wave. In view of these facts, a method was proposed (see pg. 36) which was again very sensitive, as in the case of platinum...|$|R
40|$|A gas chromatographic method {{suitable}} for determination of blood iodide in concentrations reported for burn patients treated with iodophors is described. The iodide is reacted with {{methyl isobutyl ketone}} to form an iodoketone, extracted into hexane containing an internal standard, and analyzed by gas chromatog-raphy using a packed column and an electron capture detector. In t roduct ion Iodine remains an inexpensive and effective antiseptic for ex-ternal use. Over the last decade, {{there have been several}} reports of possible systemic toxicity following absorption of topically applied iodine (i- 6). Extensively burned patients are at highest risk. Iodine is converted to iodide upon absorption and is ex-creted by the kidney. Renal failure increases the risk of toxicity. Excess iodide can be removed effectively by dialysis. Analysis of blood for iodide has been used to monitor absorption and excretion of iodide. The colorimetric method of Sandell <b>and</b> <b>Kolthoff</b> (7) has am-ple sensitivity to detect he absorption of iodine. In practice, it also has adequate specificity, although divalent cations in-cluding those of Cu, Ni, Co, Fe, Zn, Hg, Cr III, and Ag 1 can interfere (8). Inasmuch as the method requires careful atten-tion to timing, it is enhanced if used with automated analyzers.

Unfortunately chloric acid is a potential hazard, requiring an explosion-proof hood, among other precautions. We have developed a simple, convenient, and economic method for measuring urinary iodine by using 1 mol/L ammonium persulfate, a nonexplosive, nonhazardous chemical, as the oxidizing reagent. The oxidation procedure can be completed in 30 min at a temperature of 91 - 95 degrees C. The iodine in the urine is then measured by a modification of the traditional colorimetric method of Sandell <b>and</b> <b>Kolthoff.</b> Urine samples (110) collected from a mixed population of healthy males and females, {{ranging in age from}} 6 to 79 years and living in the US, were analyzed for urine iodine content by two methods: the proposed ammonium persulfate method and the chloric acid method. The ammonium persulfate method has an intraassay CV of 9. 1 % at 0. 42 +/- 0. 04 micromol/L (mean +/- SD), 7. 8 % at 1. 46 +/- 0. 11 micromol/L, and 4. 0 % at 3. 54 +/- 0. 14 micromol/L. The interassay CV is 10. 2 % at 0. 46 +/- 0. 05 micromol/L, and 7. 9 % at 3. 27 +/- 0. 26 micromol/L.
