It is the process in which continuous strands or filament of fibres are wound on the mandrel, which is more suitable for making high-pressure vessels, pipes, shaft and ducts.

40|$|From both {{theory and}} {{experimental}} evidence, an optimum solution for filament wound tubes subjected to hydrostatic pressure is the  55 ° laminate, maximising strength and allowing for satisfactory production rates. The usual strength criteria predict an equally good behaviour if a (0 °/ 90 ° 2) s laminate is adopted. Although the latter solution would imply dedicated <b>filament</b> <b>winding</b> <b>machines</b> and longer fabrication times, {{it would also}} provide a sensibly higher flexural stiffness in the circumferential direction, required when buried pipes are concerned. At this time, no data are available, comparing the performances of  55 ° and (0 °/ 90 ° 2) s on a common basis. This {{was one of the}} objectives of the present work, where Glass Fibre Reinforced Plastic (GFRP) pipes, made of E-glass and Synolite NP 244 polyester resin, were produced according to the lay-ups (90, 0, 90) n and ( 55) n, with n = 1 - 3, obtaining shell thicknesses in the range 1 to 3 mm. From the pipes, specially designed specimens were fabricated, suitable to yield valid failure modes. The samples were subjected to hydrostatic tests in a Hammel Sciteq P 400 machine, by which an internal pressure was applied through water inlet. During the mechanical characterisation tests, the specimens were continuously monitored by two Acoustic Emission (AE) sensors linked to a Vallen AMSY 4 system. The scope of AE analysis was twofold: a) to verify the usefulness of typical AE parameters [1 - 3], as the hits evolution, energy, and amplitude, in identifying the different failure modes occurring during loading; b) to attempt an effective localisation of the damage, rendered difficult by the acoustic anisotropy of the material [4]. After tests, some specimens were sectioned and microscopically examined, in order to verify their failure modes. It was found that, before the pipe burst, a dense network of resin microcracks, resulting in water leakage, is generated in the shell (Fig. 1 a). This phenomenon impairs the possibility of actually achieving burst with evident fibre failure. It was found that the critical stress for leakage of the 0 / 90 is slightly lower than its  55 counterpart. Further, the AE response is strongly influenced by the laminate type, with the  55 laminate emitting much more than the 0 / 90 laminate. In all cases, the resin microcracks were characterised by low amplitude signals...|$|E

It is a versatile and dexterous process especially well-suited for creating and optimizing parts with a linear rotational axis.

The winding itself is done through software solutions that generate a CNC {{program for the}} part in question. There are several such software solutions commercially available, all with different modes of operation and functionalities. However, they are also proprietary and offer little to no access into their inner logic. To optimise a part before production Finite Element Analysis software is often used. The part in question is modelled; material, forces and constraints are applied; and an analysis is run. Currently (June 2012), there are few options available for analysing filament wound products. Modelling a part with accurate <b>filament</b> <b>winding</b> layup generally {{has to be done}} manually, in a very time-consuming process.

40|$|<b>Filament</b> <b>winding</b> is {{a process}} for the {{placement}} of reinforcement fibres on to a rotating surface in a specified geometric pattern. A conventional straight line interpolation controller is not very appropriate for <b>filament</b> <b>winding</b> because the fibre pay-out-eye is at some distance away from the mandrel surface and its movement from one point to another may disturb the position of previously laid fibre on the mandrel. <b>Filament</b> <b>winding</b> demands a controller which can produce fast and smooth carriage movements, and have a path-anticipation capability so that while moving around curves the effect of pay-out-eye movement on previous fibre positions is minimised. This problem can be overcome by using an interpolation technique which determines the pay-out-eye path by considering more than two data points, and whose profile is continuous in nature up to its second derivative. In this project an IDM PC based <b>filament</b> <b>winding</b> controller, using B-spline interpolation technique, is developed. To test {{the performance of the}} controller a 3 -axis CNC <b>filament</b> <b>winding</b> <b>machine</b> was designed and manufactured. For optimum performance, emphasis was given to the low inertia of the machine carriage, {{while at the same time}} maintaining the system's structural stiffness.

In well intervention the high stiffness to weight ratio {{as well as the}} chemical resistance is being utilized to make a semi-stiff rod for logging purposes. The carbon rod has several advantages over its competitors, but the performance can be further improved for use in the horizontal sections of the well. As a solid carbon rod, the submerged weight causes the rod to press against the bottom of the casing generating friction which prevents the desired reach. By making the rod hollow, the submerged weight will reduce significantly and the rod will stay buoyant in the casing, hence extending the reach. The main focus {{of this study was to}} find and develop manufacturing methods for a continuous rod consisting of an inner layer of pure hoop and an outer layer of longitudinal fibers. One of the suggested methods included a filament wound hoop layer using a PPS thermoplastic impregnated carbon fiber tape with lay-up configuration corresponding to the previous tested rods based on epoxy resin. The PPS-rod was then tested with external overpressure and axial compression, the same tests performed on the epoxy-rod. The rods are considered as thick-walled tubes and had an outer diameter equal to 15 mm, which is the same as the current solid rod in field operation, and inner diameters at 12 mm. They were made using the <b>filament</b> <b>winding</b> <b>machine</b> at NTNU. The epoxy-rod was made with resin bath to ensure a good and even impregnation of the fibers, while a gas torch was used to melt the PPS-tape. Two rods were produced using a custom setup in the <b>filament</b> <b>winding</b> <b>machine.</b> Due to the provisional setup it is obvious the process and quality need more development. The rods were leaking under low pressure, and when sealed, the failure load was inconsistent and about 35 % of the failure load of the rod with made with epoxy. Microscopy shows many voids and cracks so the poor results are easily explained. Although the results could not be used to determine the potential of a rod based on a PPS matrix, the manufacturing method was proved to be a feasible way to produce a rod with the desired layup. The rod extracted easily from the mandrel and a continuous process seems feasible. Tensile tests on laminates of the PPS impregnated tape showed satisfying material properties. A study of different layups for the rod has also been conducted. Rods with layups [&# 177; 45 &# 176;] and [&# 177; 80 &# 176;/&# 177; 9 &# 176;] has been wound and tested with external overpressure and axial compression.

Due to the material?s properties, the composite material is well suited for many applications when dealing with conditions similar to the environment inside an oil well. It has a much higher stiffness to weight ratio than most materials, great thermal resistance and it is less subjected to fatigue. The material is non-corroding and may be designed for chemical resistance which is a huge benefit in the harsh conditions found for example subsea or in a well. The dominating load in an oil well environment is the extreme pressure. Carbon fiber reinforced polymers is a very strong material, and by customizing its laminate layup, its full strength can be utilized for any loadcase it may be subjected to. The main focus of this task was to study the behavior of relevant thick-walled fiber composite tubes subjected to external pressure employing both numerical and experimental methods. Three principal composite layups were analyzed, both numerically and experimentally by high pressure testing and axial compression tests. Test samples were produced and evaluated for these tasks, and compared with results from representative finite element models. Test samples with [&# 177; 80 &# 176;], [&# 177; 45 &# 176;] and [&# 177; 80 &# 176;,&# 177; 9 &# 176;] layups were analyzed. The experimental work for the [&# 177; 80 &# 176;] samples was done in a previous work, and only the results were presented in this thesis. The samples for the high pressure testing were 150 mm long, and the outer and inner diameters were 15 mm and 12 mm, respectively. The same diameters were used for the axial compression samples, but the length was reduced to 20 mm. The dimensions were determined by conventional design criteria for well intervention. The samples were produced by using the <b>filament</b> <b>winding</b> <b>machine</b> at NTNU, and an epoxy bath was used for impregnation. Puck?s failure criterion was implemented in the numerical calculations for material failure prediction. An eigenvalue buckling analysis procedure was conducted for buckling failure prediction. All samples for both test methods failed very close to the predicted failure loads with relatively low percentage difference. The differences were found to be between - 11. 1 % and 12. 7 %, and a discussion was conducted on possible sources of deviation. Due to the low deviation between predicted and factual failure loads, it could be concluded that the assumed strength and elasticity parameters of the material was reasonable and that the experimental testing procedures was well fitted {{for the study of the}} behavior of composites subjected to compression. Based on these results, a discussion of an optimized structure was conducted. The geometry analyzed in this thesis had much higher buoyancy than desired for the application. It could thus be concluded that the material has a great potential for the use in oil-well environment. </p...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} the mechanical properties of continuous fiber reinforced composite tubes, produced by <b>filament</b> <b>winding</b> technique. For this purpose, the full factorial experimental design was implemented. When designing <b>filament</b> <b>winding</b> composites three major factors are the most important: fiber orientation, fiber tension and velocity of the <b>filament</b> <b>winding.</b> The ultimate target is to achieve the composite pipes with good characteristics as bearing material for construction with the lowest possible weight. The <b>filament</b> <b>winding</b> composite pipes were made of glass fiber and epoxy resin. Glass fibers have good mechanical and thermal properties, and due to this reason, they are usually selected as the reinforcement material for <b>filament</b> <b>winding</b> technique. Thermoset or thermoplastic resin systems are usually used for impregnation of the continuous fibers in <b>filament</b> <b>winding.</b> Most commonly, epoxy resins are used due to their wide range of thermal and mechanical properties. The preparation of the composites was done by applying the 23 full factorial experimental design. For the purposes of these investigation, eight test specimen configurations are made and on the basis that, test results should provide material properties useful in the design stage. The velocity of the <b>filament</b> <b>winding</b> was taken to be the first factor, the second – fibre tension and the third – winding angle. The first factor low and high levels were chosen to be 5, 25 m/min and 21 m/min, respectively, for the second factor – 64 N and 110 N, respectively and for the third factor – 100 and 900, respectively. The effect of a filament-winding processing variables on longitudinal and hoop tensile and bending properties of the prepared composites will be investigated according to American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) standards. ...|$|R
