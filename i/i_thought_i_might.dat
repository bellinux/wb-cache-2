500|$|Doe joined Conference Premier club Weymouth on 1 July 2007, {{along with}} Swindon Town youth {{teammate}} Jon Stewart, where {{he signed a}} one-year contract. His debut for Weymouth was in the 3–0 home win during a pre-season friendly against League Two side Bournemouth on 17 July. He made his competitive debut for his new club on 15 September in the 3–1 away win at Droylsden, replacing Conal Platt as a substitute in the 65th minute. Doe's first start for Weymouth was against Torquay United on 25 September, in their 3–2 away defeat. His first goal for the club was scored on 26 January 2008, away at Rushden & Diamonds, as Weymouth were defeated 3–2. Paolo Vernazza took a free kick in the 25th minute after Stuart Beavon was fouled just outside the penalty area by Curtis Osano. Doe scored with a header, which took a slight deflection as the ball crossed the goal line. During Weymouth's 2–1 away defeat on 1 March to Halifax Town, Doe was controversially sent off three minutes into stoppage time. He was sent off for a tackle on Andy Campbell, but manager John Hollins claimed [...] "there {{is no doubt that}} Scott got the ball". Weymouth finished the season in 18th position, defying relegation, with Doe ending the 2007–08 season having made 33 appearances in the Conference, scoring once. Doe won the [...] "Supporters Player of The Year" [...] award, describing it as [...] "the best thing in the World". He admitted he did not expect to play more than 15 games during the season, saying [...] "when I first came to the club <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> play 15 games throughout the whole season but I have ended up playing over twice that and it has just been fantastic" [...] stated Doe.|$|E
2500|$|However, Nixon was {{selected}} as wicket-keeper for the England Lions team facing the West Indies before the tourists' one-day series against England. Nixon, along {{with a number of}} other fringe players, saw the selection as an opportunity to push for a place in the senior squad. He said, [...] "After the World Cup <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> not get another call-up to be honest, especially with the change of management, and Matt Prior has done so well since he came in." ...|$|E
2500|$|Wallace {{admitted}} {{she was nervous}} about reprising the role of Kat. Speaking to TVTimes, Wallace said she'd feared she forgot how to play Kat. She commented: [...] "I missed playing Kat," [...] she said. [...] "Now it feels like I've come home. I was nervous at first because <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> have forgotten how to play her, {{but as soon as}} I stepped back onto the Square she came back to me. Even when I was out of the show, people called me Kat every day in the street. I was flattered and now I'm having a great time. The recent scripts have been brilliant." ...|$|E
60|$|HAKE I was {{not sure}} of your arrangements. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> perhaps <b>I</b> <b>might</b> be wanted.|$|R
6000|$|... "Tis what I {{was about}} to ask you--what you are seeking; for that you seek is plain. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> perhaps <b>I</b> <b>might</b> assist you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, Lady Tringle. As I {{have come}} back from abroad <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>I</b> <b>might</b> as well come and call. I did see Sir Thomas in the City." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are very}} kind for coming, indeed, Sir Marmaduke;--very kind. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> explain {{something}} to you about my income." ...|$|E
60|$|MRS. CHEVELEY. Yes. I {{missed it}} when I {{got back to}} Claridge’s, and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> {{possibly}} have dropped it here.|$|E
6000|$|... "I floated {{down the}} river to the mouth, beyond your lines, last night; and then worked round here. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> find you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>thought</b> it best. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>I</b> <b>might</b> {{hear the}} truth--and so I have. I {{could not bear}} that Florence should be sacrificed while any thing {{remained}} undone that was possible." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well--well---- You see I jest {{come down}} to--to---- <b>I</b> <b>thought,</b> perhaps, <b>I</b> <b>might</b> find something, but it's time I was gettin' {{back to the}} fair, 'cause the folks will be needin' me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, sir, {{it is one}} I {{brought from}} England with me. I have been {{accustomed}} to its use, and {{as it is the}} regulation bore, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> perhaps <b>I</b> <b>might</b> carry it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, not to {{the same}} extent. You see, Lance knows {{everybody}} and everybody likes him. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> be welcome for his sake." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “No, thanks,” Jimmy {{answered}} quickly; and added, “I’m afraid it’s {{rather an}} intrusion, {{but as we}} go together, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> bring my friends.” ...|$|E
60|$|MRS. MEGAN. [Impassive.] You said {{something}} abaht makin' {{a picture of}} me. [With faint eagerness.] So <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> come, in case you'd forgotten.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. Sir Wingrave {{is going}} away, and doesn't want me. I must go somewhere, and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>I</b> <b>might</b> {{go over and}} take rooms near you all. Would you care to have me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not since dinner time. I know I had it then. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> {{possibly}} <b>I</b> <b>might</b> {{have dropped}} it here, and a dagger {{is not the}} sort of plaything one cares about giving to prisoners." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They have plenty," [...] Gregory said. [...] "I brought {{enough for}} a week with me. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>I</b> <b>might</b> be {{detained}} two or three days, here, and be obliged to make the journey by land to Abu Hamed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{beg your}} pardon,' he said; 'but <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> have {{led you to}} be hard on Lucy: I do believe it was against her will.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's pretty sore still," [...] Reuben replied, [...] "and I don't think I {{can walk}} about much; but <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> help {{in some other}} way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, no. I {{remembered that}} I {{wanted to get}} back to London; and as I had seen my friends, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> as well hurry away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{will set}} the thipdars upon us," [...] he said, [...] "and then we shall be killed; but--" [...] he hesitated--"I would take the chance if <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>I</b> <b>might</b> {{possibly}} escape and return to my own people." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Harry, blushing; [...] "as I was in town, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>I</b> <b>might</b> as well meet her. But, as you said, Lady Ongar {{is able to}} {{do without}} much {{assistance}} of that kind. I only just saw her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} out," [...] she admitted. [...] "I do not think, Capitaine Rotherby, that I {{must tell you}} where I have been, but I went to the one place where <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>I</b> <b>might</b> have news of him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I didn't ha'dly {{expect it}} myself; but I'd neva been to Yo'k, and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> as well come. Things ah' ratha slack at home, just now, anyway." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Indeed, I {{can hardly}} tell,' {{answered}} Lucy; 'I scarcely {{know what to}} think right and what wrong, but <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> be certain that it was safer to go home.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My aunt {{sends me}} out every day, when it's fine, for a drive," [...] she said. [...] "As the {{carriage}} passed close by, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> {{ask you a}} question." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was going}} to do that, but then I changed my mind and put 'em in a couple of boxes. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> maybe <b>I</b> <b>might</b> have a chance to train 'em--just like those mice we once saw in a show." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When I was comin' away," [...] {{concluded}} [...] "Bill," [...] "I pulled this off'n {{the bush}} {{by the front}} steps. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> maybe <b>I</b> <b>might</b> {{see you in the}} city, and I knowed you'd like somethin' from the old home." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A king's ransom {{would hardly}} have {{procured}} all that my other daughters asked." [...] he said: [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>I</b> <b>might</b> {{at least take}} Beauty her rose. I beg you to forgive me, for you see I meant no harm." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] he said, [...] "I {{finished}} my business {{up at the}} Castle, so <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> as well come home. By-the-by, Belle, I {{have a bit of}} news for you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have dodged {{figuring}} it up till yesterday; {{then things}} were so desperate, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> as well face the truth, so I overhauled my accounts, and there 's the result." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'If Percy and Theodora had {{not been}} reconciled, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> have done so. It did seem {{a long time to}} go on in doubt whether I had acted for her happiness.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{thinking}} of studying. Some social question. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> perhaps <b>I</b> <b>might</b> go and study social conditions as Mrs. Bailey did, go {{perhaps as a}} work-girl or see the reality of living in, but Mrs. Bailey thought perhaps it wasn't quite my work." ...|$|R
5000|$|He {{frequently}} addressed political {{themes in}} his artwork. When {{asked about this}} subject, he stated [...] "If <b>I</b> said what <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> sometimes, <b>I</b> <b>might</b> get sued so I paint to show what is going on, {{to bring out the}} truth and make people aware".|$|R
6000|$|... "It is not stolen," [...] {{replied the}} beetle, sulkily, [...] "and now belongs {{to no one}} but yourselves. When you saved my life <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> how <b>I</b> <b>might</b> reward you; and, knowing you to be poor, I decided gold would make you happier than {{anything}} else.|$|R
