40|$|The {{research}} on the longitudinal ultrasound absorption <b>in</b> <b>an</b> intermediate <b>state</b> <b>of</b> the high pure Gallium single crystal at the frequency of 50 - 190 MHz at the temperatures of 0, 37 - 0, 75 K, using the impulse method, is conducted. The new effects in the absorption <b>of</b> ultrasound <b>in</b> <b>an</b> intermediate <b>state</b> <b>of</b> the high pure type I superconductor are discovered. The big oscillations in the dependence of the ultrasound absorption on the magnetic field <b>in</b> <b>an</b> intermediate <b>state</b> <b>of</b> the high pure Gallium single crystal are experimentally observed at the magnitudes of magnetic field below the critical magnetic field. The maximum of the monotonic absorption of longitudinal ultrasound <b>in</b> <b>an</b> intermediate <b>state</b> <b>of</b> the high pure type I superconductor is also obtained. The possible original theoretical mechanisms to explain the nature of big oscillations in the dependence of the ultrasound absorption on the magnetic field <b>in</b> <b>an</b> intermediate <b>state</b> <b>of</b> the high pure type I superconductor are proposed.

5|$|According {{to church}} doctrine, the sacraments {{of the church}} require the proper form, matter, and intent to be validly {{celebrate}}d. In addition, the Canon Laws for both the Latin Church and the Eastern Catholic Churches govern who may licitly celebrate certain sacraments, as well as strict rules about who may receive the sacraments. Notably, because the Church teaches that Christ {{is present in the}} Eucharist, those who are conscious of being <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> mortal sin are forbidden to receive the sacrament until they have received absolution through the sacrament of Reconciliation (Penance). Catholics are normally obliged to abstain from eating {{for at least an hour}} before receiving the sacrament. Non-Catholics such are ordinarily prohibited from receiving the Eucharist as well.|$|E

Samus defeats the creature and retrieves the last remaining energy, causing Dark Aether to become critically unstable and collapse; however, her path out of the temple is blocked by a horribly altered and unstable Dark Samus. After defeating her foe, Samus escapes as the dark world disappears around her. Returning to U-Mos, she finds that the Luminoth were <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> hibernation but have now awakened. After a brief celebration, Samus leaves Aether in her repaired gunship. If the player completes the game {{with all of the}} items collected, Dark Samus is shown reforming herself above Aether.|$|E

A questionnaire consisted of 15 items concerning the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> health and 20 related elements of life habit was given to 155 male students in 1992. The main results were summarized as follows: 1. Three factors extracted by factor analysis could be named as follows: F 1 (social health), F 2 (mental health), F 3 (physical health). As the result, health check list consisited of 12 items. 2. Health life patterns were classified into four categories by the score of the health check list and life habit. The relation between each pattern and life habit were significant in many items. 3. The first pattern(type 1.) was <b>in</b> <b>a</b> good <b>state</b> <b>of</b> health and life habit. The second pattern (type 2.) was <b>in</b> <b>a</b> good <b>state</b> <b>of</b> health and bad <b>state</b> <b>of</b> life habit.
