40|$|The two {{dominant}} {{approaches to}} immigrant assimilation, segmented assimilation and "new" assimilation theories, {{have been successful}} at reporting and analyzing between-group differences in assimilation patterns. However, studies of assimilation generally <b>do</b> <b>not</b> address differences at the individual level. Current theories of assimilation cannot answer the simple question that gets {{to the heart of}} individual-level differences: how do you account for siblings in the same family assimilating in different ways? The usual suspect variables – parents’ educational attainment, income and occupational status, nationality/religion, context of reception and experiences of discrimination for the group in the host country – cannot address this question because these factors are the same within a family. So if those variables ultimately <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>explain</b> <b>assimilation</b> at the individual level, what does? We argue that peers will significantly affect variations in cultural and economic assimilation. We examine data from The Integration of the European Second Generation (TIES) survey, looking specifically at second-generation Turks across Western Europe. We find peer effects substantially affect cultural and economic assimilation, effects not predicted by either dominant theory of immigrant assimilation. We suggest that future researchers of second-generation immigrant assimilation take more seriously the effects of past and present peers. keywords - assimilation; integration; second-generation; peers; Turkish Muslims; Western Europ...|$|R

40|$|Current minimalism takes {{syntactic}} operations Agree and Move to {{be triggered}} by underlying feature checking requirements (Chomsky 1995, 2000, 2001, Pesetsky & Torrego 2004). This standard version of Agree/Move suffers from at least five problems: (i) it <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>explain</b> the existence of Reverse Agree; (ii) it <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>explain</b> the existence of Multiple Agree; (iii) it <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>explain</b> the behavior of Concord phenomena; (iv) it <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>explain</b> the triggering of intermediate steps in successive cyclic movement; and (v) the [EPP]-feature itself remains unmotivated. Moreover, I argue that two recent proposals (Pesetsky & Torrego 2007, Bošković 2007) solve some, {{but not all of}} these problems. Finally, I argue that all these problems disappear once a simpler version of Agree is adopted where uninterpretable features can only be checked if they are c-commanded by a matching interpretable feature and not the other way round...|$|R
