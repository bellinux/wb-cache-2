40|$|AbstractIn {{a visual}} search task, a target {{has to be}} found among distractors. For two given {{elements}} A and B, the search difficulty can depend on {{which of the two}} elements is defined as the target, a phenomenon called search asymmetry. Here, we study to what degree an element's ability to ‘win’ in a search asymmetry depends on its absolute contrast (first-stage signal) and to what degree it depends on its contrast difference from the background (second-stage signal). One quadrant contained a target texture (2 × 2 Gabor patches of contrast ctg), and the other three quadrants contained distractor textures (2 × 2 Gabor patches of contrast cdt). These four ‘foreground textures’ were embedded in a background texture consisting of patches with contrast cbg. The task was to identify which quadrant contained the target. Quadrants are referred to as increments (foreground contrast cfg>cbg), or decrements (cfg<cbg). We found that the second-stage signal determines which element wins the performance asymmetry, i. e. it is easier to find strong increments (decrements) among weak increments (decrements) than vice versa. A comparison of our data with the prediction of the independent-processing model [Vision Res. 40 (2000) 2677] shows that the observed performance asymmetries are in general too large to be attributed to noise differences alone. Rather, asymmetries might reflect a global competition between salient elements. Moreover, performance asymmetries can reverse during practice. We characterize a dipper-shaped nonlinearity on the second stage: discrimination of increment (<b>decrement)</b> <b>signals</b> x and x+Δx first improves for increasing x, and then deteriorates...|$|R

Postnatal maturational processes convert bistratifying ON-OFF RGCs to monostratifying ON and OFF RGCs. Although visual deprivation influences refinement of higher visual centers, no previous studies suggest that light regulates either {{the development of the}} visual-evoked signaling in retinal ON and OFF pathways, nor pruning of bistratified RGC dendrites. We find that dark rearing blocks both the maturational loss of ON-OFF responsive RGCs and the pruning of dendrites.

Yet, potential age-related <b>signalling</b> <b>decrements</b> have never been examined in direct parallel with impaired overload-induced muscle growth in any model. To this end, we used Western blotting to examine the contents and phosphorylation states of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and its downstream translational signalling intermediates, 70 kDa ribosomal protein S 6 kinase (S 6 k), ribosomal protein S 6 (rpS 6), eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF 2), and eukaryotic initiation factor 4 E-binding protein 1 (4 E-BP 1), in conjunction with impaired growth in 1 week overloaded fast-twitch plantaris muscles (via unilateral gastrocnemius ablation) of old (O; 30 months) versus young adult (YA; 8 months) male Fischer 344 × Brown Norway rats. The significantly (P ≤ 0. 05) diminished growth (assessed by total muscle protein content) in overloaded O muscles (5. 6 ± 1. 7 versus 19. 3 ± 2. 9 % in YA) was accompanied by significant impairments in the phosphorylation states of mTOR (Ser 2448), S 6 k (impaired at the mTOR-specific Thr 389 residue but not at Thr 421 /Ser 424), rpS 6 (Ser 235 / 236) and 4 E-BP 1 (gel shift), as well as deficits in total eEF 2 accretion. Moreover, in overloaded muscles across both age groups, phospho-S 6 k at Thr 389 (but not at Thr 421 /Ser 424), 4 E-BP 1 phosphorylation status, and total eEF 2 accretion were all positively correlated with percentage muscle hypertrophy, and negatively correlated with the phosphorylation (Thr 172) of 5 ′-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK; which inhibits translational signalling and {{protein synthesis}} in young muscle at rest). As previously published by ourselves, AMPK was hyperphosphorylated in O versus YA muscles used in the current investigation. The present results provide solid evidence that impaired overload-induced growth in aged fast-twitch muscle may partly result from multiple-level <b>decrements</b> in <b>signalling</b> pathway(s) controlling protein translation, and also provide an initial indication that AMPK hyperactivation with age may potentially lie upstream of these decrements...|$|R

50|$|The Mackworth Clock is an {{experimental}} device {{used in the}} field of experimental psychology to study the effects of long term vigilance on the detection of signals. It was originally created by Norman Mackworth as {{an experimental}} simulation of long term monitoring by radar operators in the British Air Force during World War II. The device has a large black pointer in a large circular background like a clock. The pointer moves in short jumps like the second hand of an analog clock, approximately every second. At infrequent and irregular intervals, the hand makes a double jump, e.g. 12 times every 30 seconds. The task is to detect when the double jumps occur by pressing a button. Typically, Mackworth's participants would do this task for two hours. The Mackworth Clock was used to establish one of the fundamental findings in the vigilance and sustained attention literature: the vigilance <b>decrement,</b> that is, <b>signal</b> detection accuracy decreases notably after 30 minutes on task.

40|$|Bipolar cells (BCs) are {{critical}} relay neurons in the retina that are organized into parallel signaling pathways. The three main signaling pathways in the mammalian retina are the rod, ON cone, and OFF cone BCs. Rod BCs mediate incrementing dim light signals from rods, and ON cone and OFF cone BCs mediate incrementing and <b>decrementing</b> brighter light <b>signals</b> from cones, respectively. The outputs of BCs {{are shaped by}} inhibitory inputs from GABAergic and glycinergic amacrine cells in the inner plexiform layer, mediated by three distinct types of inhibitory receptors: GABAA, GABAC, and glycine receptors. The three main BC pathways receive distinct forms of inhibition from these three receptors that shape their light-evoked inhibitory signals. Rod BC inhibition is dominated by slow GABAC receptor inhibition, while OFF cone BCs are dominated by glycinergic inhibition. The inhibitory inputs to BCs are also shaped by serial inhibitory connections betweenGABAergic amacrine cells that limit the spatial profile of BC inhibition. We discuss our recent studies on how inhibitory inputs to BCs are shaped by receptor expression, receptor properties, and neurotransmitter release properties and how these affect the output of BCs...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} way sleep {{deprivation}} effects on perceptual processes are modulated by knowledge of results (KR). In a choice-reaction task, signal quality was manipulated, combined {{with and without}} KR and under increasing levels of lack of sleep. It {{was found that the}} decrease of performance due to sleep deprivation was larger when stimuli were degraded. KR counteracted the effect of sleep deprivation; however, KR improved performance irrespective of signal quality. Hence, sleep deprivation seems to have a twofold effect on performance; one effect on perceptual processing, which is insensitive to KR, and another effect on some different processing stage, which is sensitive to KR. The results were interpreted in terms of a model of human performance (Sanders 1983) in which a distinction is made between two energetical mechanisms, ‘arousal’ and ‘activation’, subserving perceptual and motor stages of information processing, respectively. Thus, KR appears to compensate for the deficiency of one type of energetical mechanism, caused by sleep deprivation.

40|$|Much {{excitement}} {{has arisen}} from {{the observation that}} <b>decrements</b> in insulin-like <b>signaling</b> can dramatically extend lifespan in the nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans, and fruitfly, Drosophila melanogaster. In addition, there are tantalizing hints that the IGF-I pathway in mice may have similar effects. In addition to dramatic effects on lifespan, invertebrate insulin-like signaling also promotes changes in stress resistance, metabolism and development. Which, if any, of the various phenotypes of insulin pathway mutants are relevant to longevity? What are the genes that function in collaboration with insulin to prolong lifespan? These questions {{are at the heart}} of current research in C. elegans longevity. Two main theories exist as to the mechanism behind insulin's effects on invertebrate longevity. One theory is that insulin programs metabolic parameters that prolong or reduce lifespan. The other theory is that insulin determines the cell's ability to endure oxidative stress from respiration, thereby determining the rate of aging. However, these mechanisms are not mutually exclusive and several studies seem to support a role for both. Here, we review recently published reports investigating the mechanisms behind insulin's dramatic effect on longevity. We also spotlight several C. elegans genes that are now known to interact with insulin signaling to determine lifespan. These insights into pathways affecting invertebrate lifespan may provide a basis for developing strategies for pharmacological manipulation of human lifespan...|$|R

Previous work has indicated unsatisfactorily low within-subject reliability of amygdala activation fMRI measures. Based on basic science evidence for strong habituation of amygdala response to repeated stimuli, we investigated whether a quantification of habituation provides additional information beyond the usual estimate of the overall mean activity. We assessed the within-subject reliability of amygdala habituation measures during a facial emotion matching paradigm in 25 healthy subjects. We extracted the amygdala <b>signal</b> <b>decrement</b> across {{the course of the}} fMRI run for the two test–retest measurement sessions and compared reliability estimates with previous findings based on mean response amplitude. Retest-reliability of the session-wise amygdala habituation was significantly higher than the evoked amygdala mean amplitude (intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) = 0. 53 vs. 0. 16). To test the task-specificity of this finding, we compared the retest-reliability of amygdala habituation across two different tasks. Significant amygdala response decrement was also seen in a cognitive task (n-back working memory) that did not per se activate the amygdala, but was totally unreliable in that context (ICC~ 0. 0), arguing for task-specificity. Together the results show that emotion-dependent amygdala habituation is a robust and considerably more reliable index than the mean amplitude, and provides a robust potential endpoint for within-subject designs including pharmaco-fMRI studies...|$|R

40|$|Covertly {{attending}} to a location modulates {{the activity of}} visual areas {{even in the absence}} of visual stimulation. These effects are widespread, being found in the cortical representations of both attended and unattended portions of the visual field. It is not clear, however, whether preparatory modulations depend on subjects' expectation regarding the presence of additional nontarget stimuli in the visual field. Here, we asked subjects to endogenously direct attention to a peripheral location in the upper visual field, to identify the orientation of a low-contrast target stimulus, and we manipulated the number and behavioral relevance of other low-contrast nontarget stimuli in the visual field. Anticipatory (i. e., prestimulus) blood oxygenation level–dependent (BOLD) signal increments in visual cortex were strongest at the contralateral attended location, whereas <b>signal</b> <b>decrements</b> were strongest at the unattended mirror-opposite ipsilateral location/region of visual cortex. Importantly, these strong anticipatory decrements were not related to the presence/absence of nontarget low-contrast stimuli and did not correlate with either weaker target-evoked responses or worse performance. Second, the presence of other low-contrast stimuli in the visual field, even when potential targets, did not modify the anticipatory signal modulation either at target or nontarget locations. We conclude that the topography of spatial attention–related anticipatory BOLD signal modulation across visual cortex, specifically decrements at unattended locations, is mainly determined by processes at the cued location and not by the number or behavioral relevance of distant low-contrast nontarget stimuli elsewhere in the visual field...|$|R

40|$|Newborns and infants {{communicate}} {{their needs and}} physiological states through crying and emotional facial expressions. Little is known about individual differences in responding to infant crying. Several theories suggest that people vary in their environmental sensitivity with some responding generally more and some generally less to environmental stimuli. Such differences in environmental sensitivity {{have been associated with}} personality traits, including neuroticism. This study investigated whether neuroticism impacts neuronal, physiological, and emotional responses to infant crying by investigating blood-oxygenation-level dependent (BOLD) responses using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in a large sample of healthy women (N = 102) with simultaneous skin conductance recordings. Participants were repeatedly exposed to a video clip that showed crying infants and emotional responses (valence, arousal, and irritation) were assessed after every video clip presentation. Increased BOLD signal during the perception of crying infants was found in brain regions that are associated with emotional responding, the amygdala and anterior insula. Significant BOLD <b>signal</b> <b>decrements</b> (i. e., habituation) were found in the fusiform gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, Broca's homologue on the right hemisphere, (laterobasal) amygdala, and hippocampus. Individuals with high neuroticism showed stronger activation in the amygdala and subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) when exposed to infant crying compared to individuals with low neuroticism. In contrast to our prediction we found no evidence that neuroticism impacts fMRI-based measures of habituation. Individuals with high neuroticism showed elevated skin conductance responses, experienced more irritation, and perceived infant crying as more unpleasant. The results support the hypothesis that individuals high in neuroticism are more emotionally responsive, experience more negative emotions, and may show enhanced cognitive control during the exposure to infant distress, which may impact infant-directed behavior...|$|R
40|$|A {{system for}} the NDI' testing of the {{integrity}} of conposite materials and of adhesive bonds has been developed to meet industrial requirements. The vibration techniques used {{were found to be}} applicable to the development of fluid measuring transducers. The vibrational spectra of thin rectangular bars were used for the NDT work. A machined cut in a bar had a significant effect on the spectrum but a genuine crack gave an unambiguous response at high amplitudes. This was the generation of fretting crack noise at frequencies far above that of the drive. A specially designed vibrational decrement meter which, in effect, measures mechanical energy loss enabled a numerical classification of material adhesion to be obtained. This was used to study bars which had been flame or plasma sprayed with a variety of materials. It has become a useful tool in optimising coating methods. A direct industrial application was to classify piston rings of high performance I. C. engines. Each consists of a cast iron ring with a channel into which molybdenum, a good bearing surface, is sprayed. The NDT classification agreed quite well with the destructive test normally used. The techniques and equipment used for the NOT work were applied {{to the development of the}} tuning fork transducers investigated by Hassan into commercial density and viscosity devices. Using narrowly spaced, large area tines a thin lamina of fluid is trapped between them. It stores a large fraction of the vibrational energy which, acting as an inertia load reduces the frequency.

30|$|The {{process of}} {{identifying}} and dynamically adjusting the clock phase initiates after the PLL lock. After this step, the transmitter signals the receiver that the dynamic adjustment process has started by asserting high level to i_sync_start signal and starts sending a steady pattern of alternating 0 ’s and 1 ’s on the 32 -bit data bus. The hexadecimal representation of this pattern corresponds to “ 0 xAAAAAAAA 55555555 ”. Initially, the clock phase {{is set to}} 0 °. The receiver compares the received data on the bus with the expected pattern. While the phase shift controller does not recognize the expected pattern, its program phase shift increments through the PLL interface. The phasestep signal {{is responsible for the}} phase increment and <b>decrement.</b> The phaseupdown <b>signal</b> determines the phase shift direction. When phaseupdown is 0, phasestep generates an increment to the clock phase, otherwise a decrement. When the PLL has adjusted each generated pulse phase of the phasestep signal, it signals the end of this operation through the phasedone signal. When the pattern is recognized, the controller starts to count the number of increments given to the clock phase and keeps incrementing until the pattern stops to be recognized again. This counting allows the controller to get the exact size in degrees of the valid data window. The last step consists in performing decrements to the clock phase corresponding to half the number of increments performed before. This process ensures that data will be captured at exactly half of the valid data window. When this process ends, the receiver signals to the transmitter that the synchronization process has been completed through the o_sync_ready signal and begins the normal operation. If the data bus presents a configurable number of invalid transmissions, the dynamic adjustment of the clock phase runs again.|$|R

In response to this, we have developed transcanal sound recording (TSR) and spectro-temporal analysis (STA) for the objective diagnosis of VPT. By refining our initial method, {{we were able to}} apply TSR/STA to post-treatment outcome evaluation, as well as pre-treatment objective diagnosis. TSR was performed on seven VPT patients and five normal controls before and after surgical or interventional treatment. VPT was recorded using an inserted microphone with the subjects placed in both upright and supine positions with 1) a neutral head position, 2) head rotated to the tinnitus side, 3) head rotated to the non-tinnitus side, and 4) a neutral position with ipsi-lesional manual cervical compression. The recorded signals were analyzed in both time and time-frequency domains by performing a short-time Fourier transformation. The pre-treatment ear canal signals of all VPT patients demonstrated pulse-synchronous periodic structures and acoustic characteristics that were representative of their presumptive vascular pathologies, whereas those the controls exhibited smaller peaks and weak periodicities. Compared with the pre-treatment signals, the post-treatment signals exhibited significantly reduced peak- and root mean square amplitudes upon time domain analysis. Additionally, further sub-band analysis confirmed that the pulse-synchronous signal of all subjects was not identifiable after treatment and, in particular, that the <b>signal</b> <b>decrement</b> was statistically significant at low frequencies. Moreover, the post-treatment signals of the VPT subjects revealed no significant differences when compared to those of the control group. We reconfirmed that the TSR/STA method is an effective modality to objectify VPT. In addition, the potential role of the TSR/STA method in the objective evaluation of treatment outcomes in patients with VPT was proven. Further studies incorporating a larger sample size and more refined recording techniques are warranted...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Juvenile myoclonic {{epilepsy}} (JME) is a young-onset electroclinical syndrome, {{characterized by}} myoclonic, generalized tonic-clonic, and possibly typical absence seizures. Interictal electroencephalography (EEG) displays 3 - 6 Hz spike/polyspike and wave pattern. Photosensitivity is common. Our {{aim was to}} explore the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) response evoked by a highly provocative photic stimulus in a cohort of people with JME compared {{to a group of}} nonphotosensitive healthy controls, and to investigate the hemodynamic phenomena seen in patients with photosensitive JME. METHODS: We studied 13 JME patients and 18 healthy controls using EEG-functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) performed during low luminance intermittent photic stimulation (IPS). The BOLD response to IPS was investigated both in JME and control groups. In photosensitive JME subjects, we also performed a dynamic evaluation of BOLD signal changes evoked by the photoparoxysmal response (PPR) in a time frame ranging from 10 s before the onset of the EEG paroxysm up until 10 s afterward. RESULTS: The IPS evoked a positive BOLD response in striate and extrastriate visual areas, which was less in JME patients than in controls. Moreover, people with JME had a reduced positive BOLD response in the frontoparietal areas and putamen but a stronger negative BOLD response in the primary sensorimotor cortex (SM 1) and in cortical regions belonging to the default mode network (DMN). In JME, the dynamic evaluation of BOLD signal changes related to PPR revealed an early positive response in the putamen and SM 1, followed by BOLD <b>signal</b> <b>decrements</b> in the putamen, caudate nuclei, thalami, and SM 1. SIGNIFICANCE: Our results confirm the hypothesis that people with JME might have an altered interaction between the motor circuit and other neuronal networks, with prominent involvement of basal ganglia circuitry. The PPR could be a final expression of pathogenic phenomena occurring in the striato-thalamocortical system, possibly a core feature of system epilepsy JME.
