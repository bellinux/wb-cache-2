5|$|Before Live and Let Die {{had been}} published, the {{producer}} Alexander Korda <b>had</b> <b>read</b> a proof {{copy of the}} novel. He {{thought it was the}} most exciting story he <b>had</b> <b>read</b> for years, but was unsure whether it was suitable for a film. Nevertheless, he wanted to show the story to the directors David Lean and Carol Reed for their impressions, although nothing came of Korda's initial interest. In 1955, following the television broadcast of an adaptation of Fleming's earlier novel Casino Royale, Warner Bros. expressed an interest in Live and Let Die, and offered $500 for an option, against $5,000 if the film was made. Fleming thought the terms insufficient and turned them down.|$|E

His stories later also appeared between 1873–4 in The Citizen.|$|E
5|$|A key {{influence}} on the plot of The Calculus Affair was an article that Hergé <b>had</b> <b>read</b> in a February 1954 issue of the Belgian weekly La Face à Main, reporting {{that there had been}} a number of incidents along the road from Portsmouth to London in southern England in which motorists' car windscreens had spontaneously shattered; the article's author suggested that it may have been caused by experiments undertaken in a nearby secret facility. To develop this plot further, Hergé consulted Professor , an astrophysicist at Liège.|$|E

5|$|Because of Billingsley's long-standing {{friendship}} with Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) head J. Edgar Hoover, rumors persisted that the Stork Club was bugged. During {{his work on}} the Stork Club book, author and New York Times reporter Ralph Blumenthal was contacted by Jean-Claude Baker, one of Josephine Baker's sons. Having read an article by Blumenthal about Leonard Bernstein's FBI file, he indicated that he <b>had</b> <b>read</b> his mother's FBI file and by comparing the file to the tapes, said he thought the Stork Club incident was overblown.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the closure}} of the weekly title in 1993, the strip {{appeared}} in a relaunched monthly publication in September that year, with grittier storylines intended to attract teen and young adult fans who <b>had</b> <b>read</b> the weekly comic in their youth.

King quoted Tolstoy's War and Peace in 1959.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1877, Rimsky-Korsakov thought {{increasingly}} {{about the}} short story May Night by Nikolai Gogol. The story had long been a favorite of his, and his wife Nadezhda had encouraged him to write an opera based on it from the day of their betrothal, when they <b>had</b> <b>read</b> it together. While musical ideas for such a work predated 1877, now they came with greater persistence. By early 1878 the project took an increasing amount of his attention; in February he started writing in earnest, and he finished the opera by early November.|$|E
5|$|One {{consignment}} of 250 copies {{was stopped}} at Dover. Then the Chairman of the Board of Customs balked.

On 19 October he released the seized copies for delivery to Leopold Hill's premises, where the Metropolitan Police were waiting with a search warrant.

5|$|Terry Brooks {{has said}} that Tolkien's works were a major {{influence}} in his writing, though he has also said that Tolkien was not his only influence. Other influences included his editor Lester del Rey, {{as well as the}} many different books which he <b>had</b> <b>read</b> over his life. Also, mythology and ancient civilizations that he had learned about in school gave him a wealth of knowledge from which he drew. Many of these influences are reflected in Brooks' works.|$|E
5|$|The joke in {{the episode}} about Fox Mulder's {{predicted}} death being by autoerotic asphyxiation {{was inspired by}} previous jokes in the series about Mulder's interest in pornography.

While Morgan noted that he hypothesized {{that might be a}} way that Mulder would die, the line was meant as a joke.|$|E

5|$|Altman {{was then}} {{instructed}} to contact Newark Liberty International Airport, a directive he agreed to. However, {{he did not}} contact the tower at Newark. It later transpired that, in acknowledging the instruction to contact Newark, Altman <b>had</b> <b>read</b> back the wrong frequency (127.8MHz instead of 127.85), an error that the controller did not correct. Soon after, a controller at Newark who was concerned about aircraft in the Piper's path contacted the Teterboro controller and asked the him to attempt to re-establish contact. All attempts to contact Altman and change his aircraft's heading were unsuccessful. After the failure to contact Altman, a radar alert about a possible collision occurred in both the Newark and Teterboro towers. However, the two controllers did not remember seeing or hearing this alert.|$|E
