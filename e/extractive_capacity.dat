40|$|Several {{prominent}} {{recent works}} in comparative politics explore {{the relationship between}} democracy and economic inequality, centring on the expectation by economic elites that democratisation {{will lead to the}} redistribution of elite wealth. But, in practice, state <b>extractive</b> <b>capacity</b> is necessary for redistribution. Where <b>extractive</b> <b>capacity</b> is lacking, rational economic elites should not fear that the loss of political power would lead to effective redistribution. Thus, the effect of inequality on regime outcomes is conditional on state capacity. This prediction is confirmed through replication and extension of the analysis in Boix (2003), with the addition of the presence of a regularly implemented national census as a proxy for state <b>extractive</b> <b>capacity.</b> In strong states, the negative effect of inequality on regime change is confirmed. But, where the state is weak, inequality is shown to have no effect on regime change.

40|$|Abstract. CO 2 {{flooding}} {{process has}} been a proven valuable tertiary enhanced oil recovery (EOR) technique. In this paper, experiment on <b>extractive</b> <b>capacity</b> of CO 2 in oil saturated porous media was conducted under reservoir conditions. The main objectives of the study are to evaluate <b>extractive</b> <b>capacity</b> of CO 2 in oil saturated natural cores and improve understanding of the CO 2 flooding mechanisms, especially in porous media conditions. Experimental results indicated that oil production decreases while GOR increases with extractive time increases. the changes of the color and state of the production oil shows that oil component changes from light to heavy as extractive time increases. In addition, no oil was produced by water flooding after extractive experiment. Based on the experimental results and phenomena, the main conclusion drawn from {{this study is that}} under supercritical condition, CO 2 has very powerful <b>extractive</b> <b>capacity.</b> And the application of CO 2 flooding is recommended for enhancing oil recovery...|$|E

The results show that this proxy of <b>extractive</b> <b>capacity</b> positively affects the non-oil tax revenue of oil-producing countries, and these results are robust to various sensitivity checks. The persistence of the pre-existing extractive institutions as well as their subsequent privileged position explain why the elites have no interest in changing this scenario...|$|E

40|$|The {{provision}} of welfare services {{can be understood}} as an iterated public goods game in simplified terms. Individuals contribute via taxation while the state cooperates by the {{provision of}} welfare services as return for paid contributions. Focusing on welfare provision in low- and middle-income democracies, where we find decisive variation in state capacity and considerable inefficiencies such as high rates of income inequality, corruption, and a prosperous informal economy, the efficiency of the public goods game becomes uncertain. If the state is perceived as weak and untrustworthy because of lacking capacity to extract revenue and to deliver social services, why should individuals turn towards this low-capacity entity for provision of welfare services? Drawing upon the current debate on redistributive preferences in the political economy literature, the overall research question that this dissertation is concerned with therefore asks: what happens to individual social policy preferences when the context of high-income states dissolves? The dissertation analyses social policy preference formation in the context of increased uncertainty that is reflected by weaknesses in the distributive and <b>extractive</b> <b>capacities</b> of the state and inefficiency – that is, the informal economy.

The main problems of these metabolic engineering processes are plasmid instability and the low capability to accumulate lycopene in the cytoplasmic membrane from non-carotenogenic organisms (Wang et al. 2012). Hence, the in situ recovery of lycopene from a recombinant E. coli strain is the goal for achieving a competitive biotechnological process. To our knowledge there are few studies concerning lycopene extraction from E. coli. It has been reported an in situ process based on lycopene overproduction and recovery using octane and decane as extraction solvents (Yoon et al. 2008).

40|$|Carbon {{sequestration}} in sandstone saline reservoirs holds {{great potential}} for mitigating climate change, but its storage potential and cost per ton of avoided CO 2 emissions are uncertain. We develop a general model to determine the maximum theoretical constraints on both storage potential and injection rate {{and use it to}} characterize the economic viability of geosequestration in sandstone saline aquifers. When applied to a representative set of aquifer characteristics, the model yields results that compare favorably with pilot projects currently underway. Over a range of reservoir properties, maximum effective storage peaks at an optimal depth of 1600 m, at which point 0. 18 - 0. 31 metric tons can be stored per cubic meter of bulk volume of reservoir. Maximum modeled injection rates predict minima for storage costs in a typical basin in the range of $ 2 - 7 / ton CO 2 (2005 U. S. $) depending on depth and basin characteristics in our base-case scenario. Because the properties of natural reservoirs in the United States vary substantially, storage costs could in some cases be lower or higher by orders of magnitude.

Time course of cell suspension culture in a nonionic surfactant micelle aqueous solution indicated that product degradation as well as inhibition was eliminated at early stage (before reaching the extraction capacity of nonionic surfactant micelles) and then intracellular Monascus pigments were accumulated at the later stage (after reaching the extraction capacity of nonionic surfactant micelles, {{which is similar to}} traditional fermentation in an aqueous solution) (Fig.  3 a). Thus, extraction capacity of nonionic surfactant micelles was related to elimination of product degradation/inhibition and then related to product accumulation, which had been further confirmed by replacing nonionic surfactant with peanut oil as extractant (Fig.  3 b). Accumulation of high concentration of extracellular Monascus pigments was realized due to the plant oil phase with high <b>extractive</b> <b>capacity.</b> Furthermore, instable/toxic extracellular product can also be converted into relatively stable/nontoxic compound by enzymatic reaction (Willrodt et al. 2015) or non-enzymatic reaction (Xiong et al. 2015; Domaille et al. 2016; Wallace and Balskus 2016), which may be a more efficient strategy to make whole cell biocatalyst play its potential.|$|E
40|$|Research PaperEfficient {{management}} {{of natural resources}} hinges on our ability to monitor and assess {{the status of the}} resource stocks as well as the actions and economic performance of the agents utilizing such resources. The sustainability and viability (both in physical and economic terms) of our resource management plans can in part be assessed by estimating the <b>extractive</b> or productive <b>capacity</b> of economic agents relying on a given resource. However, because of the limitations and uncertainty associated with the available data, particularly in the fishing industry, estimating the capacity and capacity utilization of the agents using the resource can be a difficult endeavor. Compounding the difficulties of estimating capacity is the heterogeneous nature of the agents using the resource. Heterogeneity in the agents implies that multiple production processes may exist, which must be accounted for when attempting to measure capacity and capacity utilization. This research addresses this concern by estimating heterogeneous capacity and capacity utilization, using latent class regression analysis, {{in the context of a}} multi-species fishery and it illustrates the complexities that arise in the presence of heterogeneous production technologies - a common situation in multi-species, multi-gear fisheries. Our results indicate that there exists substantial heterogeneity in the production technologies possessed by fisherman within the Eastern Bering Sea flatfish fishery. This in turn translates to differences in the capacity estimates generated using the heterogeneous production frontier model when compared to the traditional homogeneous model. Given the superior empirical fit of the heterogeneous production frontier, this indicates that traditional homogeneous production frontier will overestimate production capacity when heterogeneity in production technologies exists...|$|R

The total phenolic content and antioxidant capacity of warm water, ethanol, and methanol extracts of the seeds and leaves of B. orellana were also evaluated. The brine shrimp lethality assay was conducted to assess the toxicity of the extracts.

40|$|The thesis has two aims. The {{first one}} is to {{contribute}} to the field of political and historical sociology through an understanding of the processes of state formation in a Third World country. The second aim is to describe and analyze the development of the Nicaraguan state from independence to 1990. In {{the first part of the}} dissertation theories of the nation-state and state formation are discussed and criticized. The Eurocentric origin and bias of the nation-state concept is seen as a significant problem in conceptualizing and understanding state formation in the Third World. Taking into consideration the experience of state formation in Western Europe, a theoretical frame work is presented that operationalize the concept of nation-state and the process of state formation. This frame work is further elaborated by discussions of some central aspects pertaining to countries of the Third World that differentiate them from the Western European experience. Nation-state formation is thus seen as a process in the international, "national" and state arenas encompassing the strengthening and the coordination of repressive, <b>extractive</b> and integrative <b>capacities</b> of the state. A central aspect in understanding state capacities is through the conceptual pair of infrastructural and despotic power. The empirical study focuses on the development (state formative processes) of the Nicaraguan state from independence in 1823 until the Sandinista electoral defeat in 1990. The role of the colonial legacy, the world capitalist economy and the international system of states in influencing the shape of the Nicaraguan state is analyzed. Through the history of Nicaraguan state formation, phases are outlined with different state formative characteristics. State disintegrative phases are represented by the city-states of early independent Nicaragua and the protectorate years at the beginning of the 20 th century. Reproductive peripheralness is seen as dominant during the second half of the 19 th century and the Somoza dynasty. Finally projects of nation-state formation are to be found during the Zelaya regime and during the Sandinista regime. The importance of the agroexport economy, foreign interventions and a fractured social formation is seen as an important factor blocking the development of a Nicaraguan nation-state. Through the notion of the peripheral state and frameworked in the concepts of extractive, repressive and integrative capacities the author provides new theoretical insights on Third World states dynamics in creating and maintaining a national arena, squeezed between international and local forces. The author shows that the peripheral state is not a traditional state form but a modern state form interdependent on the successful consolidation of nation-stateness in the First World...|$|R
40|$|Portulaca oleracea is a {{wild plant}} pest of {{orchards}} and gardens, {{but is also}} an edible vegetable rich in beneficial nutrients. It possesses many antioxidant properties due to the high content of vitamins, minerals, omega- 3 essential fatty acids and other healthful compounds; therefore, the intake of purslane and/or its bioactive compounds could help to improve the health and function of the whole human organism. Accordingly, in this work it was analyzed and compared to the <b>extractive</b> <b>capacity</b> of the antioxidant component of purslane leaves obtained by solid-liquid extraction techniques such as: hot-maceration, maceration with ultrasound, rapid solid-liquid dynamic extraction using the Naviglio extractor, and a combination of two techniques (mix extraction). The chromatographic analysis by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) of the methanolic extract of dried purslane leaves allowed the identification of various polyphenolic compounds for comparison with the standards. In addition, {{the properties of the}} different extracts were calculated on dry matter and the antioxidant properties of the total polyphenol components analyzed by the DPPH (2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl) assay. The results showed that mix extraction was the most efficient compared to other techniques. In fact, it obtained a quantity of polyphenols amounting to 237. 8 mg Gallic Acid Equivalents (GAE) / 100 g of fresh weight, while in other techniques, the range varied from 60 - 160 mg GAE/ 100 g fresh weight. In addition, a qualitative analysis by Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) of the phenolic compounds present in the purslane leaves examined was carried out. The compounds were identified by comparison of their molecular weight, fragmentation pattern and retention time with those of standards, using the "Multiple Reaction Monitoring" mode (MRM). Therefore, this study allowed the re-evaluation of a little-known plant that possesses as its beneficial properties, a great potential for use in both the food and the nutraceuticals and cosmetic field...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: A {{significant}} proportion of the world‟s population today live under some forms of authoritarian rule. In this paper, we present a model of environmental politics in the authoritarian world acknowledging the theme in the recent literature that authoritarian states differ from each other as much as they do from democracies. We start with the basic assumptions that rulers want to stay in power; and in order to achieve this, they need to deliver benefits to their key constituencies. Therefore, on average, the larger the size of the key constituencies, the more pressure there is for the ruler to deliver. For countries that lack ready access to revenue (domestic non-tax revenues and/or foreign aid), this often requires higher state capacity for more extensive resource extraction from the society, which is often {{at the expense of the}} environment, by limiting the efforts of the private sector and civil society to protect the environment. Large key constituencies plus strong state capacity, as our theoretical model predicts, are associated with bad environmental outcomes in authoritarian regimes. We test our theory by modelling three types of major air and water pollutants (SO 2, CO 2, and Biological Oxygen Demand or BOD) in authoritarian states as a function of regime types (which we use to proxy the size of key constituencies), the <b>extractive</b> <b>capacity</b> of the state, and a battery of relevant variables. The results strongly support our theory. State capacity is associated with higher levels of all three types of pollutants. Single-party regimes, which we assume to have the largest key constituencies among four types authoritarian regimes, are positively associated with SO 2 emissions. We also find strong evidence that the time horizon of the ruler (measured by regime duration) reduces SO 2 and CO 2 emissions...|$|E
40|$|Increasing {{tax revenue}} is {{imperative}} for development and good governance in Latin America. Governments {{throughout the region}} experienced continued revenue needs {{in the aftermath of}} market-oriented tax reforms implemented in the 1980 s and early 1990 s, yet tax policy outcomes varied widely, across countries, over time and across tax policy areas. This study explains variation in governments' tax reform agendas and the fate of reform proposals in Chile, Argentina, and Bolivia by analyzing the power of business, a key actor in tax politics in highly unequal societies. Many taxes directly or indirectly affect profits, and business associations may defend the interests of upper-income individuals as well as corporations. The classic concepts of structural power and instrumental power elaborate distinct means of business influence. Structural power arises from a perceived threat that a policy will lead to inadequate investment via market signals. Instrumental power entails deliberate political actions. Sources of instrumental power include relationships with decision-makers and resources that help business pressure policymakers more effectively. When either type of power is strong, taxing elites will be difficult, and reforms that policymakers view as desirable may even be eliminated from the agenda. In Chile, strong instrumental power kept significant tax increases off the agenda. Weaker business power in Argentina gave governments more leeway to increase taxation at the cross-sectoral level, although some powerful sectors prevented tax increases with sector-specific impact. Bolivia is a rare case where business's substantial power was challenged by counter-mobilization on tax issues and a radical threat from popular sectors to the existing political and economic system. The analysis is based on 82 tax proposals embedded in 48 reform packages. Cases in which policymakers decided not to propose tax reforms they viewed as important are also examined. Primary data sources include interviews with high-level government and tax agency officials, politicians, and business leaders, as well as congressional records, newspaper articles, tax agency reports, and tax return statistics. This research provides insights on building state <b>extractive</b> <b>capacity,</b> which has received insufficient attention in political science. It also contributes to theory on business politics by specifying mechanisms through which economic elites influence policy in democratic societies, observable sources of their power, and government strategies that can attenuate their influence on taxation...|$|E
