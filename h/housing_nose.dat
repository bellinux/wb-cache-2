5000|$|... 6051 was {{delivered}} in the Daylight paint scheme, with Farr-Aire intake grilles, a Pyle National Gyralight in the upper headlight <b>housing,</b> <b>nose</b> MU connections, dynamic braking, Nathan model M5R24 air horn (it currently sports a Nathan P5), a single Model 4740 steam generator producing 4500 lb. of steam per hour, a 1200 gal fuel tank, a 1350 gal boiler water tank, automatic transition, and a freight pilot. It weighed 336,000 lb and had 56,600 lb of Starting Tractive Effort. Gear ratio was 55:22, with the Locomotive Overspeed set at 83 mph. In May 1958, SP 6051 was painted in the experimental black with orange nose [...] "halloween" [...] paint scheme. It received the gray and scarlet [...] "bloody nose" [...] paint scheme shortly afterward, likely in 1959. SP 6051 was retired on December 24, 1969 and was donated to the Railway & Locomotive Historical Society {{at the end of}} the year along with Baldwin DRS-6-6-1500 5208 and EMD F7A 6402, largely through the efforts of SP Vice President Larry Hoyt. All three units were in turn deeded to the California State Railroad Museum on June 22, 1978 and placed on display near the Sacramento train station or stored at SP's Sacramento General Shops until the California State Railroad Museum was built. SP 6051 was cosmetically and mechanically restored in the early 1980s and is in its original 1955 appearance in the Daylight paint scheme. SP 6051 was also part of the 1981 [...] "Railfair" [...] festivities to celebrate the opening of the California State Railroad Museum.|$|E
60|$|Fledgeby knocked and rang, and Fledgeby {{rang and}} knocked, {{but no one}} came. Fledgeby crossed the narrow street {{and looked up at}} the house-windows, but nobody looked down at Fledgeby. He got out of temper, crossed the narrow street again, and pulled the housebell as if it were the <b>house's</b> <b>nose,</b> and he were taking a hint from his late experience. His ear at the keyhole seemed then, at last, to give him {{assurance}} that something stirred within. His eye at the keyhole seemed to confirm his ear, for he angrily pulled the <b>house's</b> <b>nose</b> again, and pulled and pulled and continued to pull, until a human nose appeared in the dark doorway.|$|R

50|$|Unarmed {{training}} version {{fitted with}} new <b>nose</b> <b>housing</b> cockpit for instructor, while the trainee {{sat in the}} normal cockpit. First flown 18 March 1950.|$|R
5000|$|P.57 Sea Prince T1 - Prince 3 {{with long}} <b>nose</b> <b>housing</b> radar, twin wheeled main {{undercarriage}} and lengthened engine nacelles for navigation and anti-submarine training, 41 built.|$|R
50|$|The Canada Aviation and Space Museum in Ottawa <b>houses</b> the <b>nose</b> and cockpit {{section of}} Arrow RL 206, along with various wing and {{fuselage}} components, {{and a complete}} Iroquois-2 engine, Serial Number 117. An example of an Iroquois-1 engine is found at the Canadian Warplane Heritage Museum in Mount Hope, near Hamilton, Ontario. Another Iroquois-2 engine is owned by a private collector in Fort St. John, British Columbia.|$|R
50|$|The {{removal of}} the engine in the nose made the {{aircraft}} more aerodynamic, improved visibility for the pilots, and allowed the fitting of four machine guns. Its long slim <b>nose,</b> <b>housing</b> the bombsight, gained it the nickname Pinocchio.|$|R
25|$|A {{total of}} 77 F-101As were built. They were {{gradually}} withdrawn from service starting in 1966. Twenty-nine survivors {{were converted to}} RF-101G specifications with a modified <b>nose,</b> <b>housing</b> reconnaissance cameras in place of cannons and radar. These served with the Air National Guard through 1972.|$|R
50|$|A {{well-known}} running gag in {{the cartoons}} involves Paw stepping on a loose lumber of their <b>house,</b> causing his <b>nose</b> {{to get stuck}} in the hole of that wood as it flips. His eldest son would try to help him by punching his nose.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Hans," [...] I said to him, [...] "what {{is the use}} of you? You are {{no better}} than a fraud. You pretend to be the best {{watchdog}} in Africa, and yet a woman comes into this <b>house</b> under your <b>nose</b> and in the grey of the morning, and you do not see her. Where is your reputation, Hans?" ...|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, Canada needed an {{all-weather}} interceptor (fighter) able {{to patrol the}} vast areas of Canada's north and operate in all weather conditions. The two-seat fighter crewed by a pilot and navigator was designed with two powerful engines and an advanced radar and fire control system <b>housed</b> in its <b>nose</b> that enabled it to fly in all-weather or night conditions.|$|R
500|$|The <b>nose</b> <b>housed</b> the {{armament}} of one [...] Nudelman N-37 autocannon and two [...] Nudelman-Suranov NS-23 autocannon. The N-37 {{could be}} replaced by a [...] Nudelman N-45. The aircraft carried 100 rounds for each NS-23 and 40 rounds for the N-37. Two [...] FAB-250 high explosive bombs could be carried underneath the forward fuselage, but the N-37 had to be dismounted to do so.|$|R
50|$|The Microplano had a flat sided, {{rectangular}} section fuselage. The <b>nose</b> <b>housed</b> a 115 kW (157 hp) Hispano-Suiza water-cooled engine, {{driving a}} two bladed propeller. Behind the underwing single seat open cockpit the fuselage narrowed strongly in both height and width. Both the near circular rudder and semi-circular tailplane were all-moving. There was a fixed conventional undercarriage with mainwheels on V-form struts, assisted by a tailskid.|$|R
50|$|The <b>nose</b> <b>housed</b> the {{armament}} of one 37 mm Nudelman N-37 autocannon and two 23 mm Nudelman-Suranov NS-23 autocannon. The N-37 {{could be}} replaced by a 45 mm Nudelman N-45. The aircraft carried 100 rounds for each NS-23 and 40 rounds for the N-37. Two 250 kg FAB-250 high explosive bombs could be carried underneath the forward fuselage, but the N-37 had to be dismounted to do so.|$|R
50|$|The {{fuselage}} of the MG-1 was steel {{framed and}} fabric {{covered with the}} exception of a glass fibre engine cowling. This <b>housed</b> a conventionally <b>nose</b> mounted, 74.5 kW (100 hp) flat four Continental O-200 piston engine driving a non-retractable propeller. Its cockpit seated two side by side under a rearward sliding canopy. The conventional undercarriage had main wheels with rubber cord shock absorbers and brakes, assisted by a steerable tailwheel.|$|R
50|$|While other OKB's were {{designing}} {{the next generation}} of all-weather interceptors, OKB-301 was tasked with fitting the new Sokol (Falcon) radar into the La-200. The result was Aircraft 200B, with a new fuselage <b>nose</b> <b>housing</b> the radar behind a large radome with three air intakes surrounding the radome. By mid 1953 the radar was working adequately but Aircraft 200B's performance was no longer good enough and further work was abandoned.|$|R
2500|$|... had {{a rather}} abrupt, {{dome-shaped}} <b>nose</b> <b>housing</b> the [...] Hispano-Suiza 8Fb water-cooled V-8 engine and its [...] turbo-supercharger. The engine was mounted with its output shaft low down in the nose and drove a two-blade propeller. [...] Though this was of the wooden, fixed-pitch type, it was intended {{that it would be}} replaced by a variable-pitch Lavasseur airscrew later. A single, roughly cylindrical Lamblin radiator was suspended below the engine, between the undercarriage legs.|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{that very}} easily, you know," [...] he explained. [...] "I just slip into my {{rooms in the}} Rue Jolivet, change myself into a snuffy and hunchback violin-maker, and {{walk out of the}} <b>house</b> under the <b>noses</b> of the spies. In the nearest wine-shop my English friends, in various disguises, are all ready to my hand: half a dozen of them are never far from where I am in case they may be wanted." ...|$|R
50|$|Gonzo is {{also the}} namesake to the CT-142 Bombardier Dash 8 used by the Canadian Armed Forces for Air Combat Systems Officer {{training}} due to the blue paint job and elongated <b>nose</b> <b>housing</b> a specialized radar. A similar flying example is the Gulfstream IV light jetliner bearing US registration N49RF, flown for severe weather research by the US Federal National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and is also named for Gonzo as portside nose art.|$|R
50|$|Apart from Indian payload, {{sounding}} rockets {{from many}} other countries (including United States, Russia, Japan, France, Germany) were also launched from Thumba, as part of mutual international collaboration. TERLS developed infrastructure for all aspects of rocketry, ranging from rocket design, rocket propellant, rocket motor casting, integration, payload-assembly, testing, evaluation besides building subsystems like payload <b>housing</b> and jettisonable <b>nose</b> cone. Fibre-reinforced plastic composite materials for nose cone were used in early programs at TERLS.|$|R
50|$|The AK3 {{is powered}} by a 58.8 kW (78.9 hp) Rotax 912 UL four {{cylinder}} horizontally opposed engine, <b>housed</b> in the <b>nose</b> under a carbon fibre cowling and driving a three blade propeller. It has a tricycle undercarriage, with glass/carcon fibre laminate cantilever spring main legs mounted onto the fuselage and a trailing link nose wheel on a forward angled cantilever leg. The mainwheels have hydraulic brakes and all wheels are faired.|$|R
2500|$|Construction of the V-12 first prototype, after {{exhaustive}} testing with test-rigs and mock-ups {{including a}} complete transmission system, began at Panki in 1965. The airframe was largely conventional, using stressed skin construction methods with high strength parts machined from solid. The large fuselage accommodated the [...] cabin and crew {{section in the}} extreme <b>nose,</b> <b>housing</b> pilot, co-pilot, flight engineer and electrical engineer in the lower cockpit, with the navigator and radio operator in the upper cockpit.|$|R
5000|$|As Beaufort units entered service, it {{was found}} that the {{defensive}} armament was inadequate and extra [...]303 in Vickers GO machine guns were fitted; two on a gimbal mounting in the forward nose and single guns on pivots on either beam. A remotely controlled [...]303 in Browning machine gun was fitted, firing to the rear under the <b>nose.</b> <b>Housed</b> in a clear blown transparency, {{it was found}} to be of little use and most operational units soon discarded them.|$|R
5000|$|Toe's {{older sister}} Stacey (Kat Dennings) arrives to tutor [...] "Nose" [...] Noseworthy (Jake Short), Toe's old, germaphobic friend. Nose picks his nose against his father's wishes and accidentally flicks the booger into his father's {{radioactive}} work study. Toe and Loogie, now friends, arrive at <b>Nose's</b> <b>house</b> {{in time to}} see Nose's booger mutate into a giant monster. After helping Nose's father (William H. Macy) capture the monster outside, Toe and Loogie take the rock and leave.|$|R
50|$|Construction of the V-12 first prototype, after {{exhaustive}} testing with test-rigs and mock-ups {{including a}} complete transmission system, began at Panki in 1965. The airframe was largely conventional, using stressed skin construction methods with high strength parts machined from solid. The large fuselage accommodated the 28.15 * 4.4 * 4.4 m cabin and crew {{section in the}} extreme <b>nose,</b> <b>housing</b> pilot, co-pilot, flight engineer and electrical engineer in the lower cockpit, with the navigator and radio operator in the upper cockpit.|$|R
50|$|In January 1953, the USAF {{had asked}} McDonnell {{to develop an}} unarmed {{photographic}} reconnaissance version of the F-101 Voodoo as a possible replacement for the Republic RF-84F Thunderflash. The first RF-101A was delivered to the 17th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron on 6 May 1957 {{as a replacement for}} the subsonic RF-84F. The RF-101A had a redesigned and longer <b>nose</b> <b>housing</b> four cameras designed for low-altitude photography. In addition, two high-altitude cameras were mounted behind the cockpit in place of the ammunition boxes of the fighter variant.|$|R
50|$|Owing to {{manufacturing}} difficulties envisaged {{with other}} all-new jet fighter developments, Focke-Wulf's second design {{was nothing more}} than a development of the Focke-Wulf Fw 190, but powered with a jet engine, positioned on a redesigned fuselage. This engine, a Jumo 004, was to be <b>housed</b> beneath the <b>nose.</b> A conventional undercarriage was used. The low position of the jet intake raised the likelihood of foreign matter being sucked up, and in any case, the engine would burn the runway. This design development ceased in March 1943.|$|R
50|$|Hewland Mk.III of 1962 {{became the}} first product for the public, which {{utilised}} the magnesium alloy case of the Beetle transaxle to house 5 pairs of bespoke straight-cut constant mesh spur gears with dog rings operated by custom-made brass shift forks. Gear selector shaft was located in the <b>nose</b> <b>housing,</b> unmodified as in the Beetle set up, facing rear-ward {{at the tail end}} of the box in the front-side-back position on a midship engine racing cars. The elimination of synchromesh parts provided the space for an additional pair of gears for the 5th speed.|$|R
50|$|The {{operational}} Dornier night fighter, redesignated J-1, {{before entering}} operations was powered by BMW 801L engines. It was {{fitted with a}} revised crew compartment housing a crew of three, with a solid <b>nose</b> <b>housing</b> four fixed 7.92 mm MG 17 machine guns, with four 20 mm MG FF/M cannon in the forward part of the ventral gondola. It retained the MG 131s in a dorsal turret and ventral position of the bomber, and could carry eight 50 kg bombs in the rear bomb-bay, with a fuel tank in the forward bomb-bay.|$|R
25|$|The {{airframe}} followed contemporary {{aircraft construction}} techniques, with weight savings {{from the use}} of advanced materials and the short airborne life of the missile. The fuselage was essentially tubular, tapering to a point at the <b>nose,</b> <b>housing</b> the guidance equipment, warhead and systems equipment. The engine was fed with air through a distinctive wedge shaped intake under the center fuselage. Its swept wings attached to its fuselage at the middle position, roughly halfway along its length, and a large swept fin attached {{to the top of the}} fuselage at the rear which was sometimes augmented by a large ventral fin at the extreme rear of the fuselage.|$|R
