25|$|There {{are many}} <b>ghost</b> <b>towns</b> or {{abandoned}} {{communities in the}} American Great Plains, the rural areas of which have lost {{a third of their}} population since 1920. Thousands of communities in the northern plains states of Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota became railroad <b>ghost</b> <b>towns</b> when a rail line failed to materialize. Hundreds more towns were abandoned when the US Highway System replaced the railroads as the favored mode of travel. <b>Ghost</b> <b>towns</b> are common in mining or mill towns in all the western states, and many eastern and southern states as well. Residents are compelled to leave in search of more productive areas when the resources that had created an employment boom in these towns were eventually consumed. Some unincorporated <b>towns</b> become <b>ghost</b> <b>towns</b> due to flooding caused by dam projects that created manmade lakes, such as Oketeyeconne. <b>Ghost</b> <b>towns</b> are particularly numerous in the southwestern state of New Mexico.|$|R

5|$|Four miles (6.4km) west of {{the pass}} {{is the site of}} Independence, the village whose {{establishment}} on July 4 led to the pass's current name. It has been a <b>ghost</b> <b>town</b> since the early 20th century. In 1973 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Most of its buildings were cannibalized for their building supplies, but a few log cabins remain. The Aspen Historical Society, in conjunction with the U.S. Forest Service, built an interpretive trail with plaques.|$|E
5|$|Harold Oliver {{was born}} to Cornish {{immigrants}} James Oliver and Sarah Mill in the gold mining town of Waukaringa. It was common for Cornish people, where mining was a key industry, to move to Australia and use their knowledge to attempt a better life as the economy in Cornwall was waning. During Oliver's childhood in the 1890s the town was home to 600 people. Today it is a <b>ghost</b> <b>town.</b>|$|E

5|$|San Francisco {{had been}} a tiny {{settlement}} before the rush began. When residents learned about the discovery, it at first became a <b>ghost</b> <b>town</b> of abandoned ships and businesses, but then boomed as merchants and new people arrived. The population of San Francisco exploded from perhaps about 1,000 in 1848 to 25,000 full-time residents by 1850. Miners lived in tents, wood shanties, or deck cabins removed from abandoned ships.|$|E
5|$|Some {{of these}} lava flows blocked rivers and streams, {{impounding}} small lakes and ephemeral ponds in the process. About 100,000years ago, basalt from the largest cinder cone in the park, Crater Hill, flowed over the area. The lava traveled into Coalpits and Scoggins Washes {{to the south}} and accumulated to a depth of over 400ft (122m) in the ancestral Virgin River valley near the present-day <b>ghost</b> <b>town</b> of Grafton, Utah. Water impounded behind the two blockages, forming Coalpits Lake and Lake Grafton respectively.|$|E

25|$|There are <b>ghost</b> <b>towns</b> {{in parts}} of British Columbia, Alberta, Ontario, Saskatchewan, Newfoundland and Labrador, and Quebec. Some were logging towns or dual mining and logging sites, often {{developed}} {{at the behest of}} the company. In Alberta and Saskatchewan, most <b>ghost</b> <b>towns</b> were once farming communities that have since died off due to the removal of the railway through the town or the bypass of a highway. The <b>ghost</b> <b>towns</b> in British Columbia were predominantly mining towns and prospecting camps as well as canneries and, in one or two cases, large smelter and pulp mill towns. British Columbia has more <b>ghost</b> <b>towns</b> than any other jurisdiction on the North American continent, with one estimate at the number of abandoned and semi-abandoned towns and localities upwards of 1500. Among the most notable are Anyox, Kitsault, and Ocean Falls.|$|R

5|$|Early August 8, 1840, the Comanches {{surrounded}} the small port of Linnville, Texas, {{which was the}} second largest port in the Republic of Texas at the time, and began pillaging the stores and houses. Linnville, which is now a <b>ghost</b> <b>town,</b> was located 3.5 miles northeast of present-day Port Lavaca. The Comanches reportedly killed three whites, including customs officer Hugh Oran Watts, who had delayed his escape to retrieve a gold watch at his home (reportedly a family heirloom). After killing Watts, the Comanche captured his wife of only three weeks, the former Juliet Constance, and a black woman and child.|$|E

By early morning the division commander, Brigadier General Fuad 'Aziz Ghali, was able to set up his command post there. Close quarter combat and even hand-to-hand fighting took place as the Egyptians cleared the <b>ghost</b> <b>town</b> building by building. Fighting was intense, {{and by the end}} of October 7, the town and its outskirts as well as two nearby fortifications of the Bar Lev Line were under Egyptian control.|$|E
5|$|The gorge widens {{where the}} highway passes by Castle Valley and Professor Valley, {{which have been}} the {{shooting}} locations for many western films (including Wagon Master and Rio Grande) and television commercials. Near {{the east end of}} the valley the highway crosses Onion Creek, a stream sourced by springs that contain naturally occurring minerals that produce a strong odor in the water. At the east end of the valley the highway has a view of the Fisher Towers, a set of dark red spires. After leaving the valley, the road winds farther up the river gorge until arriving at the Dewey Bridge, named for Dewey, a nearby <b>ghost</b> <b>town.</b>|$|E

5|$|Watie {{formed the}} Cherokee Mounted Rifles. He was a guerrilla fighter {{commanding}} Cherokee, Seminole, Creek, and Osage Indian soldiers.

He surrendered on June 23 at Fort Towson, in the Choctaw Nations area at the village of Doaksville (now a <b>ghost</b> <b>town)</b> of the Indian Territory, being the last Confederate general to surrender in the American Civil War.|$|E
5|$|Harrison Clark left South Africa in 1887, but it {{is unclear}} why; {{according}} to a story that may be apocryphal, he fled the country as an outlaw soon after his revolver fired—by accident, so the story goes—and killed a man. Whatever the truth, he travelled to Mozambique, then a Portuguese territory, where {{he made his way}} upriver along the Zambezi until he reached Feira, a long-abandoned Portuguese settlement at the confluence of the Zambezi and Luangwa Rivers, in what is today southern Zambia. Feira was founded by missionaries from Portugal in about 1720, but by 1887 it was a <b>ghost</b> <b>town.</b> Its last inhabitants had fled amid a native rising about half a century before, and since then it had been deserted.|$|E
5|$|Port Lavaca or Labaca, {{developed}} {{after the}} abandonment of Linnville. It grew substantially following the destruction of Indianola, and became a prominent shipping location and national leader in shrimp production. Across the bay and currently connected by Texas State Highway 35, the town of Point Comfort is found. It was incorporated in 1953 at a citywide vote and {{is known for its}} large aluminium and petrochemical plants built in the 1960s. The small town of Olivia, which was founded in 1892 as a Swedish Lutheran community, is located on the shores of Keller Bay. The unincorporated towns of Alamo Beach, established around 1900, and Magnolia Beach, founded sometime thereafter, and named for the Magnolia figs produced in the area, are found north of the remains of the <b>ghost</b> <b>town</b> of Indianola.|$|E
