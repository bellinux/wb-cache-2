5|$|In 1973, the {{publishing}} company Robert Hale brought out Valiente's second book, An ABC of Witchcraft, {{in which she}} provided an encyclopaedic overview of various topics related to Wicca and esotericism. In 1975, Hale published Valiente's Natural Magic, a discussion of what she {{believed to be the}} magical usages and associations of the weather, stones, plants, and other elements of the natural world. In 1978 Hale then published Witchcraft <b>for</b> <b>Tomorrow,</b> in which Valiente proclaimed her belief that Wicca was ideal for the dawning Age of Aquarius and espoused James Lovelock's Gaia hypothesis. It also explained to the reader how they could initiate themselves into Wicca and establish their own coven. In 1978 she offered a book of poetry to Hale, although they declined to publish it, believing that there would not be sufficient market for such a publication. In 1982 she then submitted a book of short stories, The Witch Ball, to Hale, but again they declined to publish it.|$|E
5|$|Upon the {{completion}} of Banjo-Kazooies development, Hollis immediately began another project. Originally set to be a tie-in <b>for</b> <b>Tomorrow</b> Never Dies, Rare was significantly outbid by another publisher, forcing Rare {{to develop a new}} concept with new characters. With a major emphasis on lighting, the game was named Perfect Dark. Hollis left Rare for Nintendo 14 months after the start of Perfect Darks development. Around the same time, numerous employees left the company and formed new studios. With major project leads departing, a new team took over its development and diminished the role of lighting in the game, making it a more straightforward first-person shooter. Despite the game's troubled development, it did not affect the progress of Rare's other teams. When Perfect Dark was still in development, Rare released two other titles, Jet Force Gemini and Donkey Kong 64. In 1999, Nintendo signed an agreement with Disney, and assigned Rare to develop several racing and adventure games featuring Mickey Mouse. The project later became Mickey's Speedway USA and Mickey Racing Adventure. Perfect Dark eventually resurfaced and it was released in 2000 to critical acclaim. The game sold approximately 2 million copies.|$|E

25|$|After {{the release}} of the album, Deaf Havana {{spent a lot of time}} touring as a support band; they would not play a {{headline}} tour until April 2012, 5 months after {{the release of}} Fools and Worthless Liars. They began by supporting Skindred on their headline tour across Europe, followed by acting as support, alongside Tek-One, to Architects on their UK tour. Speaking before their April 2012 headline tour, which featured The Swellers and The Dangerous Summer as support, James Veck-Gilodi said: 'We are so excited to finally get out on the road and headline again. We've spent the last year or so writing and recording the album and been lucky enough to have some amazing support shows... but to be able to go out and play songs from Fools and Worthless Liars and headline is going to be great'. The band are due to play another headline tour, at larger venues, in November 2012. Support will come from There <b>For</b> <b>Tomorrow</b> and Canterbury. Deaf Havana had been due to travel to the USA to support There <b>For</b> <b>Tomorrow</b> in September 2012, but due to a problem with the arrival of their visas, this did not take place.|$|E

25|$|The show starred Katherine Helmond and Cathryn Damon as sisters/matriarchs {{of their}} own families. The cast also {{included}} three former soap opera actors. Robert Mandan (Chester Tate) had previously appeared on Search <b>for</b> <b>Tomorrow</b> as a leading man for Mary Stuart, and Donnelly Rhodes (Dutch Leitner) had played the first husband of Katherine Chancellor on The Young and the Restless. Arthur Peterson, Jr. ("The Major") played Rev. John Ruthledge in the radio version of Guiding Light.|$|E
25|$|Pleased {{with its}} performance, ABC {{promoted}} {{the show to}} 12:30 PM (11:30 AM Central) on September 6, where it faced stronger challenges {{in the form of}} CBS' long-running Search <b>for</b> <b>Tomorrow</b> and NBC's The Who, What, or Where Game, which had been on for two years at this point. Nonetheless, Password held up well there for six months until the network moved it up a half-hour to 12:00 Noon (11:00 AM Central) on March 20, 1972 for the new Hatos-Hall game Split Second.|$|E
25|$|Long-running daytime dramas seen on NBC in {{the past}} include The Doctors (1963–1982), Another World (1964–1999), Santa Barbara (1984–1993), and Passions (1999–2007, later moving to The 101). NBC also aired the final 4½ years of Search <b>for</b> <b>Tomorrow</b> (1982–1986) after that series was {{initially}} cancelled by CBS, although many NBC affiliates did not clear the show during its tenure on the network. NBC has also aired numerous short-lived soap operas, including Generations (1989–1991), Sunset Beach (1997–1999), and the two Another World spin-offs, Somerset (1970–1976) and Texas (1980–1982).|$|E

25|$|When the one-hour 10th anniversary {{special in}} spring 1974 proved a massive ratings success, NBC and Procter and Gamble made the {{decision}} to expand to 60 minutes permanently on January 6, 1975, replacing the original version of the game show Jeopardy!, in a scheduling shuffle with the in-house-produced How to Survive a Marriage. Another World became the first serial to broadcast one hour daily, only some six years after the last two 15-minute soaps (CBS' Search <b>for</b> <b>Tomorrow</b> and Guiding Light, also Procter and Gamble shows) finally doubled their daily lengths.|$|E
25|$|The senatorial {{election}} {{was held in}} the Philippines on May 10, 2004. The major coalitions that participated are the Koalisyon ng Katapatan at Karanasan sa Kinabukasan (K4; Coalition of Truth and Experience <b>for</b> <b>Tomorrow)</b> composed of parties that support the candidacy of president Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, and the Koalisyon ng Nagkakaisang Pilipino (KNP; Coalition of United Filipinos), parties that support the candidacy of film actor Fernando Poe Jr. A third coalition, the Alyansa ng Pag-asa (Alliance of Hope) was made up of Aksyon Demokratiko and Reporma-LM. K4 won seven seats, while the KNP won the remaining five contested seats in the Philippine Senate.|$|E
25|$|The Koalisyon ng Katapatan at Karanasan sa Kinabukasan (Coalition of Truth and Experience <b>for</b> <b>Tomorrow)</b> or K-4, is {{the remnant}} of the People Power Coalition that was formed {{following}} the ascendancy of president Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo to power. Arroyo is seeking a complete term under this coalition with Sen. Noli de Castro, an independent, yet popular, politician, as her running mate. The leading party in this coalition is the ruling Lakas-CMD, of which Arroyo is a member. Other parties under this coalition are the Liberal Party, the Nacionalista Party, the Nationalist People's Coalition and the People's Reform Party.|$|E

25|$|The first exotic {{location}} shoot {{was made}} by All My Children, to St. Croix in 1978. Many other soap operas planned lavish storylines after {{the success of the}} All My Children shoot. Soap operas Another World and Guiding Light both went to St. Croix in 1980, the former show culminating a long-running storyline between popular characters Mac, Rachel and Janice, and the latter to serve as an exotic setting for Alan Spaulding and Rita Bauer's torrid affair. Search <b>for</b> <b>Tomorrow</b> taped for two weeks in Hong Kong in 1981. Later that year, some of the cast and crew ventured to Jamaica to tape a love consummation storyline between the characters of Garth and Kathy.|$|E
25|$|Mortensen {{made his}} first film {{appearance}} playing an Amish farmer in Peter Weir's Witness (Mortensen had actually acted {{in at least one}} prior film, The Purple Rose of Cairo, but his scenes were deleted from the final cuts). Also in 1985, he was cast in the role of Bragg on Search <b>for</b> <b>Tomorrow.</b> Mortensen's 1987 performance in Bent at the Coast Playhouse, Los Angeles, won him a Dramalogue Critics' Award. Coincidentally, the play, about homosexual concentration camp prisoners, was originally brought to prominence by Ian McKellen, with whom Mortensen later costarred in The Lord of the Rings. In 1987, Mortensen guest starred as a police detective on the hit series Miami Vice.|$|E
25|$|General Hospital rose {{rapidly to}} the top spot in the Nielsen ratings by 1979. As for One Life to Live, from its tenth {{birthday}} onward, its competitors declined in popularity. Search <b>for</b> <b>Tomorrow,</b> for instance, spent its last several months on CBS against {{the last half of}} One Life to Live. Its replacement, Capitol, did little better, and after its cancellation, CBS aligned As the World Turns against One Life to Live and Another World, a configuration that stayed in place until Another Worlds cancellation in 1999. The 1980s saw One Life to Live reach the height of its popularity, with an estimate of 9 million viewers early in the decade. The show typically ranked between the second and the fourth position in the 1980s.|$|E
