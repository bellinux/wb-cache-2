Conversely, if fair criticism is a defence to an allegation of contempt, the burden would be on the alleged contemnor to show on a balance of probabilities that the statement amounts to fair criticism.|$|E

Specifically, it focuses on their claims for war disablement pensions, exploring how they seek and challenge medical diagnoses. Detailing three veteran case studies, the article offers an ethnographic analysis of illness narratives. It explores how sufferers attempt to recast and reject the <b>evidential</b> <b>burdens</b> that they face in pension appeals, and identifies three narratives strategies that they deploy aimed at linking somatic realities to political etiologies.

40|$|In jurisdictions that {{subscribe}} to adversarial mode of litigation, burdens and standards of proof have significant {{roles in the}} adjudication and determination of criminal cases. The operation {{of the principle of}} presumption of innocence in such jurisdictions determines issues of who bears what burden and the extent thereof. The Ethiopian criminal procedure system predominantly exhibits adversarial features, and there is the need for the comprehension and enforcement of the respective burdens and standards of proof borne by litigants. The constraints in clarity are more pronounced in those criminal law provisions that embrace some form of presumptions such as provisions on corruption offences. This note highlights how issues of burden and standard of proof are allocated as between prosecuting authorities and accused persons. Apart from explaining the nexus between the principle of presumption of innocence, burdens of proof and standards of proof, it indicates the implications of the operation of the principle of presumption of innocence upon the allocation of <b>evidential</b> and persuasive <b>burdens</b> of proof as {{between the state and the}} accused.

The court read down the burden of proof as merely one of an <b>evidential</b> <b>burden</b> [...] meaning the defendant merely had to raise some evidence to support the defence, which it believed did not conflict with Article 6(2). However, in Sheldrake v DPP, the court instead requiring a persuasive burden, because it believed {{in the context of the}} motoring offence in the case, this was not disproportionate and did not conflict with Article 6(2).|$|E

5000|$|<b>Evidential</b> <b>burden</b> or [...] "production burden" [...] is the {{obligation}} to produce evidence to properly raise an issue at trial. Failure to satisfy the <b>evidential</b> <b>burden</b> means that an issue cannot be raised at a court of law.|$|E
5000|$|An <b>evidential</b> <b>burden</b> compels a {{party to}} produce {{evidence}} in support of an issue it seeks to raise, failing which the party shall not be permitted to raise it at all. This burden can rest on either party, although it usually relates to matters of defence raised by the accused. Some defences impose an <b>evidential</b> <b>burden</b> on the defendant. If the <b>evidential</b> <b>burden</b> is met, the prosecution then bears the burden of proof (which is not called an <b>evidential</b> <b>burden).</b> For example, if a person charged with murder pleads self-defence, the defendant must satisfy the <b>evidential</b> <b>burden</b> that there are some evidence suggesting self-defence. The burden of proof then falls on the prosecution to produce evidence to support their position. In such a case, a legal burden will always rest on the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant was not acting in self-defence. A legal burden is determined by substantive law, rests upon one party and never shifts.|$|E
