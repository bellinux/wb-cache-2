5|$|According to Sunni jurisprudence, in the {{application}} of local custom, custom that is accepted into law should be commonly prevalent in the region, not merely in an isolated locality. <b>If</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> absolute opposition to Islamic texts, custom is disregarded. However, <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> opposition to analogical reason, custom is given preference. Jurists also tend to, with caution, give precedence to custom over doctoral opinions of highly esteemed scholars. Shi'ite scholars do not consider custom as a source of jurisprudence, nor do the Hanbalite or Zahirite schools of Sunni jurisprudence.|$|E

Carnaby's black cockatoo is occasionally parasitised by the bird louse species Franciscoloa funerei.

5|$|In {{response}} to the criticism that NPC behavior had been too simplistic in Morrowind, Bethesda developed the Radiant A.I. system for Oblivion. NPCs were designed to make choices, rather than complete scripted routines, to achieve predetermined goals. The manner in which goals such as eating, sleeping, reading, and speaking to others are fulfilled is dependent upon the environment, the choices of other NPCs, and programmed personality values. For example, an NPC whose goal is to find food may eventually resort to stealing from others, if they are given the opportunity and <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> their character. These development mechanics allowed Bethesda to create NPCs who could engage in complex activities.|$|E

5|$|Several {{authors have}} {{regarded}} Geastrum indicum as the correct name for G.triplex. This is because G.indicum—a species described by Johann Friedrich Klotzsch in 1832 as Cycloderma indicum {{and then moved}} to Geastrum by Stephan Rauschert in 1959—may be the same species as Geastrum triplex. <b>If</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> fact the same species, the first published name (i.e., G.indicum) has nomenclatorial priority {{according to the rules}} of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature. More recently, several authors argue that G.indicum should be rejected as a nomen dubium and G.triplex maintained as the correct name for the species.|$|E

The Local Interstellar Cloud is an area of denser cloud in an otherwise sparse region known as the Local Bubble, an hourglass-shaped cavity in the interstellar medium roughly 300 light-years (ly) across. The bubble is suffused with high-temperature plasma, that suggests it is the product of several recent supernovae.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} in the High Court decided that {{although there was no}} right at common law to have publicly provided legal representation in all cases, in some cases representation is appropriate to ensure a fair trial.

5|$|Luther lists several criticisms {{advanced}} by laypeople against indulgences in theses 81–91. He presents these as difficult objections his congregants are bringing {{rather than his}} own criticisms. How should he answer those who ask why the pope does not simply empty purgatory <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> his power? What should he say to those who ask why anniversary masses for the dead, which were {{for the sake of}} those in purgatory, continued for those who had been redeemed by an indulgence? Luther claimed that it seemed strange to some that pious people in purgatory could be redeemed by living impious people. Luther also mentions the question of why the pope, who is very rich, requires money from poor believers to build St. Peter's Basilica. Luther claims that ignoring these questions risks allowing people to ridicule the pope. He appeals to the pope's financial interest, saying that if the preachers limited their preaching in accordance with Luther's positions on indulgences (which he claimed was also the pope's position), the objections would cease to be relevant. Luther closes the Theses by exhorting Christians to imitate Christ even if it brings pain and suffering. Enduring punishment and entering heaven is preferable to false security.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{formulation}} of Kant's ethics is the categorical imperative, {{from which he}} derived four further formulations. Kant made a distinction between categorical and hypothetical imperatives. A hypothetical imperative is one we must obey {{if we want to}} satisfy our desires: 'go to the doctor' is a hypothetical imperative because we are only obliged to obey it if we want to get well. A categorical imperative binds us regardless of our desires: everyone has a duty to not lie, regardless of circumstances and even <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> our interest to do so. These imperatives are morally binding because they are based on reason, rather than contingent facts about an agent. Unlike hypothetical imperatives, which bind us insofar as we are part of a group or society which we owe duties to, we cannot opt out of the categorical imperative because we cannot opt out of being rational agents. We owe a duty to rationality by virtue of being rational agents; therefore, rational moral principles apply to all rational agents at all times.|$|E
