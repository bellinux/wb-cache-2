50|$|All the {{above-mentioned}} microphone arrays take up considerable space, making them quite ineffective for field recordings. In this respect, the double MS (Mid Side) technique is quite advantageous. This array uses {{back to back}} cardioid microphones, one facing forward, the other backwards, combined with either one or two <b>figure-eight</b> <b>microphone.</b> Different channels are obtained by sum and difference of the figure-eight and cardioid patterns. When using only one <b>figure-eight</b> <b>microphone,</b> the double MS technique is extremely compact and therefore also perfectly compatible with monophonic playback. This technique also allows for postproduction changes of the pickup angle.|$|E
50|$|Here, two {{directional}} microphones are at {{the same}} place, typically pointing at an angle between 90° and 135° to each other. The stereo effect is achieved through differences in sound pressure level between two microphones. A difference in levels of 18 dB (16 to 20 dB) is needed for hearing {{the direction of a}} loudspeaker. Due to the lack of differences in time-of-arrival/phase ambiguities, the sonic characteristic of X-Y recordings has less sense of space and depth when compared to recordings employing an A-B setup. When two <b>figure-eight</b> <b>microphones</b> are used, facing ±45° with respect to the sound source, the X-Y setup is called a Blumlein Pair. The sonic image produced is realistic.|$|R
50|$|Specialized {{microphone}} arrays {{have been}} developed for recording purely the ambience of a space. These arrays are used in combination with suitable front arrays, or can be added to above mentioned surround techniques. The Hamasaki square (also proposed by NHK) is a well established microphone array used for the pickup of hall ambience. Four <b>figure-eight</b> <b>microphones</b> are arranged in a square, ideally placed far away and high up in the hall. Spacing between the microphones should be between 1-3 meters. The microphones nulls (zero pickup point) are set to face the main sound source with positive polarities outward facing, therefore very effectively minimizing the direct sound pickup as well as echoes {{from the back of the}} hall The back two microphones are mixed to the surround channels, with the front two channels being mixed in combination with the front array into L and R.|$|R
