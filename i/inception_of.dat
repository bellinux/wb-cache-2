40|$|PURPOSE: Our {{theoretical}} model proposes that insomnia, worry, and negative affect are important determinants of paranoid thinking. Anxiety produces anticipation of threat, depression increases {{the sense of}} vulnerability, worry leads to implausible ideas, and insomnia exacerbates negative affect and creates an altered perceptual state. The study objective was to examine {{for the first time}} these factors as predictors of the onset of new paranoid thinking and of the persistence of existing paranoid thinking. METHOD: A total of 2, 382 participants in the 2000 British National Psychiatric Morbidity Survey were followed-up 18  months after their first assessment. Baseline assessments were used to predict the development and persistence of paranoid thinking at follow-up. Data were weighted to be representative of the general household population. RESULTS: Insomnia, worry, anxiety, depression and depressive ideas were each substantial predictors both <b>of</b> new <b>inceptions</b> <b>of</b> paranoia and of the persistence of existing paranoid thinking. Worry and insomnia were the strongest predictors. For example, insomnia at the first assessment led to a more than threefold increase in later <b>inceptions</b> <b>of</b> paranoid thinking. CONCLUSIONS: The study indicates that insomnia, worry, anxiety and depression are potential risk factors for new <b>inceptions</b> <b>of</b> paranoid thinking. The results also corroborate an emerging literature indicating that anxiety, worry and depression may encourage the persistence of paranoid thinking. The study provides the first longitudinal evidence linking insomnia and paranoia. The important clinical implication is that the use of interventions for common mental health difficulties in people with psychosis may have the additional benefit of reducing paranoia...|$|R

40|$|Insomnia {{is common}} in people {{experiencing}} psychosis. It {{has been identified as}} a contributory cause of paranoia, but any causal relationship with hallucinations has yet to be established. We tested the hypotheses that insomnia i) has a cross-sectional association with hallucinations ii) predicts new <b>inceptions</b> <b>of</b> hallucinations and iii) that these associations remain after controlling for depression, anxiety, and paranoia. Data from the second (2000, N= 8580) and third (2007, N= 7403) British Psychiatric Morbidity Surveys were used to assess cross-sectional associations between insomnia and hallucinations. The 2000 dataset included an 18 month follow up of a subsample (N= 2406) used to test whether insomnia predicted new <b>inceptions</b> <b>of</b> hallucinations. Insomnia was associated with hallucinations in both cross-sectional datasets. Mild sleep problems were associated with 2 - 3 times greater odds of reporting hallucinations, whilst chronic insomnia was associated with four times greater odds. Insomnia was also associated with increased odds of hallucinations occurring de novo over the next 18 months. These associations remained significant, although with smaller odds ratios, after controlling for depression, anxiety and paranoia. This is the first longitudinal evidence that insomnia is associated with the development of hallucinatory experiences. Effective treatment of insomnia may lessen the occurrence of hallucinations...|$|R
