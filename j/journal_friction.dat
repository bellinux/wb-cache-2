[...] In locomotive and railroad car applications a journal bearing specifically referred to the plain bearing once used at the ends of the axles of railroad wheel sets, enclosed by journal boxes (axleboxes). Axlebox bearings today are no longer plain bearings but rather are rolling-element bearings.|$|E

At that time the principal sources of loss are identified as the energy remaining in water after being discharged from the bucket, The heat developed by impact of water in striking the bucket, The fluid friction {{of the water in}} passing over the surface of the bucket, The loss of head in the nozzle, The <b>journal</b> <b>friction</b> the resistance of the air. It was assumed that the effect from of above all the losses were negligible when deriving the Mathematical formula governing the performance of the Pelton wheels. And also it was assumed that the all the water escapes from the bucket with the same velocity. Among the various analytical studies that had been done on Pelton turbine hydraulics less {{attention has been paid to}} the friction along the buckets. In this paper the effect of bucket friction was analyzed using Boundary Layer theory. I...|$|E

40|$|Abstract [...] Based on the {{momentum}} and continuity equations for ferrofluid under an applied magnetic field, assuming linear behavior for the magnetic material of the ferrofluid, and using carrying current concentric finite wire magnetic field model, the magnetic force was calculated. A modified Reynolds equation is obtained. It is simultaneously solved {{with the energy}} equation numerically by the finite difference technique. The pressure and temperature distributions have been obtained under various couple stress parameter. The solution renders the bearing performance characteristics namely; load carrying capacity, attitude angle of the journal center, frictional force at the <b>journal</b> surface, <b>friction</b> coefficient and bearing side leakage. Based on the micro-continuum theory, and by {{taking into account the}} couple stresses due to the microstructure additives, the effects of couple stresses on the performance of a finite hydrodynamic journal bearings were studied. The results have shown that fluids with couple stresses are better than Newtonian fluids. Index Term [...] Magnetized journal bearings; Ferroflui...|$|R
40|$|Internal {{combustion}} engines (ICE) {{for the use}} in heavy-duty trucks and buses have to fulfil demanding requirements for both vehicle efficiency {{as well as for}} emission of greenhouse gases. Beside the piston assembly the journal bearings are among the largest contributors to friction in the ICE. Through a combination of measurements and validated simulation methods the <b>journal</b> bearing <b>friction</b> losses of a state-of-the-art heavy-duty Diesel engine are investigated for a large range of real world operating conditions. To this task recently developed and extensively validated simulation methods are used together with realistic lubricant models that consider the Non-Newtonian behaviour as well as the piezoviscous effect. In addition, the potential for further friction reduction with the use of ultra-low viscosity lubricants is explored. The results reveal a potential of about 8 % friction reduction in the journal bearings using a 0 W 20 ultra-low viscosity oil with an HTHS-viscosity (The HTHS-viscosity is defined as the dynamic viscosity of the lubricant measured at 150 °C and at a shear rate of 106...|$|R
40|$|This paper studies {{equilibrium}} {{selection in}} binary supermodular games based on perfect foresight dynamics. We provide complete characterizations of absorbing and globally accessible equilibria and {{apply them to}} two subclasses of games. First, for unanimity games, it is shown that our selection criterion is not in agreement with {{that in terms of}} Nash products, and an example is presented in which two strict Nash equilibria are simultaneously globally accessible when the friction is sufficiently small. Second, a class of games with invariant diagonal are proposed and shown to generically admit an absorbing and globally accessible equilibrium for small <b>frictions.</b> <b>Journal</b> of Economic Literature Classification Numbers: C 72, C 73...|$|R
40|$|Delacroix and Shi (Pricing and {{signaling}} with <b>frictions,</b> <b>Journal</b> of Economics Theory 2013) study a model featuring buyers with unit {{demands and}} sellers with unit supplies. The sellers may produce a high- or a low-quality good. The buyers get a signal about quality but the signalling technology is quite specific; the signal is either completely revealing or uninformative. The author studies {{the same model}} with a symmetric signalling technology where high and low signals are always got with positive probability. As a consequence, whenever high-quality goods are produced also low-quality goods are produced. Instead of price posting the author studies trading by auctions. There are two equilibria, and the author quantifies the efficiency loss due to asymmetric information...|$|R
40|$|This article {{deals with}} {{minimizing}} quadratic functions {{with a special}} form of quadratic constraints that arise in 3 D contact problems of linear elasticity with isotropic friction [Haslinger, J., Kučera, R. and Dostál, Z., 2004, An algorithm for the numerical realization of 3 D contact problems with Coulomb <b>friction.</b> <b>Journal</b> of Computational and Applied Mathematics, 164 / 165, 387 – 408. ]. The proposed algorithm combines the active set method with the conjugate gradient method. Its general scheme {{is similar to the}} algorithms of Polyak’s type that solve the quadratic programming problems with simple bounds. As the algorithm does not terminate in a finite number of steps, the convergence is proved. The implementation uses an adaptive precision control of the conjugate gradient loops. Numerical experiments demonstrate the computational efficiency of the method...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{atmosphere}} on the tribological properties of a plasma-sprayed chromium carbide based self-lubricating coating is reported. The coating contains bonded chromium carbide as the wear resistant base stock {{to which the}} lubricants silver and barium fluoride/calcium fluoride eutectic are added. It has been denoted as NASA PS 200. Potential applications for the PS 200 coating are cylinder wall/piston ring couples for Stirling engines and foil bearing <b>journal</b> lubrication. <b>Friction</b> and wear studies were performed in helium, hydrogen, and moist air at temperatures from 25 to 760 C. In general, the atmosphere {{had a significant effect}} on both the friction and the wear of the coating and counterface material. Specimens tested in hydrogen, a reducing environment, exhibited the best tribological properties. Friction and wear increased in helium and air but are still within acceptable limits for intended applications. A variety of X-ray analyses was performed on the test specimens in an effort to explain the results. The following conclusions are made: (1) As the test atmosphere becomes less reducing, the coating experiences a higher concentration level of chromic oxide at the sliding interface which increases both the friction and wear. (2) Beneficial silver transfer from the parent coating to the counter-face material is less effective in air than in helium or hydrogen. (3) There may be a direct relationship between chromic oxide level present at the sliding interface and the friction coefficient...|$|R
40|$|Stribeck's {{publications}} Wugellager fur beliebige Belastungen' and 'Die wesentlichen Eigenschaften der Gleit- und Rollenlager' were {{remarkable for}} their time. Many {{of the findings}} were revolutionary and are still considered quite modem. The method used by Stribeck to calculate load distribution between the balls within a ball bearing is still used today, otherwise, a full finite element analysis would be required. His measurements and analysis of bearing friction is also astonishingly accurate. Most of the ball-bearing types studied by Stribeck are not in use any more, but the deep-groove ball bearings he investigated were similar enough to be compared with modern deep-groove ball bearings. Stribeck measured the friction coefficient 0. 0015 and SKF gives the friction coefficient 0. 0015 for deep-groove ball bearings in the catalogue from 1989. For the first time, in the SKF catalogue from 1989, the life calculation method took into account contamination also. Stribeck had stated already 100 years ago that cleanliness was very important for bearing life and function. Stribeck's investigation of <b>journal</b> bearing <b>friction,</b> {{as a function of}} load and speed, was also extremely important, as he showed the possibility of finding a point of minimum friction for lubricated applications. He also showed that the friction for sliding bearings started at high friction at low speeds, decreased to a minimum friction when metal to metal contact stopped, and then increased again at higher speeds, which is the well known 'Stribeck curve'.
