50|$|Van der Waals is a lunar crater on the {{far side}} of the Moon. It is a heavily eroded feature with an <b>irregular</b> <b>outer</b> rim. The <b>edge</b> is lowest along the {{southern}} side where it is little more than a circular crest along the ground. It is more developed along the northern side, but the rim is notched and rugged. The satellite crater Van der Waals W is attached to the exterior of the northeast, and Van der Waals H intrudes into the rim along the southeast. The interior floor is relatively even and featureless, with only a few tiny craterlets to mark the surface.|$|R

50|$|The 24 <b>outer</b> <b>edges</b> {{cannot be}} flipped, since the {{interior}} shape of those pieces is asymmetrical. Corresponding <b>outer</b> <b>edges</b> are distinguishable, since {{the pieces are}} mirror images of each other. Any permutation of the <b>outer</b> <b>edges</b> is possible, including odd permutations, giving 24! arrangements. The 12 central edges can be flipped. Eleven can be flipped and arranged independently, giving 12!/2 × 211 or 12! × 210 possibilities (an odd permutation of the corners implies an odd permutation of the central edges, and vice versa, thus the division by 2). There are 24! × 12! × 210 possibilities for the inner and <b>outer</b> <b>edges</b> together.|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{photometric properties}} of spiral arms and stellar complexes/associations inside these {{arms in the}} grand design NGC 628 (M 74) galaxy. We analyze GALEX ultraviolet, optical UBVRI, and H-alpha? surface photometry data, including those obtained with 1. 5 m telescope at the Maidanak Observatory. In the longer arm, the large and bright stellar complexes are located at regular intervals along the arm, but only farther from the galaxy center. They are joined with the narrow lane of dust, visible only in the infrared bands. The usual dust lane along the stellar arm inner side is seen there only at distances closer to the galaxy center. It is well expressed in CO (H_ 2) image. We have found, that the second, short arm hosts two dust lanes, the strong and wide at the inner side, and narrow and <b>irregular</b> along its <b>outer</b> <b>edge.</b> This <b>outer</b> dust lane is well seen in IR images only. The shorter arm contains no star complexes at all. Gradients of age and luminosity of stars across both arms are missing (again excepting the parts of arms located closer to the center), which is confirmed by our photometric cuts across both arms. The drastic difference in the morphology of the two symmetric arms (grand design type) of a galaxy has now been confirmed by objective measurements {{in the case of}} M 74. It is unclear why about two third of galaxies with beaded arms host these "beads" (star complexes) in one arm only.
