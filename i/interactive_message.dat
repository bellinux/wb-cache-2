40|$|College males’ uptake {{of human}} {{papilloma}} virus (HPV) vaccination is low. Prior research indicates perceived susceptibility to HPV among college males is also low. Construal level theory may offer a framework to alter perceived susceptibility and intention to vaccinate, but {{little research has}} examined this potential. Construal level theory provides foundational elements including that low construal level of perceptions is associated with more proximal psychological distance (hypothetical, social, temporal and spatial). Research indicates a disparity in college males’ susceptibility estimates which suggests high hypothetical distance. A reduction in hypothetical distance should be indicated by a measured increase in perceived susceptibility. Additionally, if construal level primed by messages is consistently associated with stage of change, then movement through stages of change might be promoted by influencing construal level such that perceived hypothetical distance is reduced. Additionally, the impact of interactivity on construal level and associated outcomes was explored. This study included two online experiments. In the first, a message was presented in components based on construal level dimensions. The second experiment was a 2 x 2, including high construal <b>interactive</b> <b>message,</b> low construal <b>interactive</b> <b>message,</b> high construal non-interactive message, and low construal non-interactive message conditions. The outcome variables of interest in both cases are hypothetical distance, barrier construal, stage of change and intention to vaccinate for HPV. Construal level dimensions did not offer explanatory value {{to the relationship between}} barriers and stage of change, a temporal measure of vaccination intention. However, the results indicate that perceptions of messages as lower construal are associated with increases in perceived susceptibility and intention to vaccinate for HPV. Perceived interactivity was associated with reduced social distance and increase in intention to vaccinate. This study suggests that construal level theory may be useful in the formative evaluations for HPV-related campaigns targeting males. This study also supports the addition of interactive elements to health campaigns, however the exact type of interactivity warrants further research. Limitations and directions for future research are discussed. ...|$|E

Findings suggest a correlation between audience participation structure and message style, identifying two distinct styles – public and private – as well as a transitional style, termed “overhearing. ” The transitional style from public to private suggests that even among the same group of people, e-mail writers change their message style and language use according to the audience of the message.

40|$|Abstract. We propose an <b>interactive</b> <b>message</b> {{authentication}} protocol (IMAP) {{using two}} channels: an insecure broadband channel and an authenticated narrow-band channel. We consider {{the problem in}} the context of ad hoc networks, where it is assumed that there is neither a secret key shared among the two parties, nor a public-key infrastructure in place. The security of our IMAP is based on the existence of Interactive-Collision Resistant (ICR) hash functions, a new notion of hash function security. Our IMAP is based on the computational assumption that ICR hash functions exist. It performs better than message authentication protocols that are based on computational assumptions. That is, while achieving the same level of security, the amount of information sent over the authenticated channel in our IMAP is smaller than the most secure IMAP and Non-interactive Message Authentication Protocol (NIMAP) in the literature. In other words, if we send the same amount of information over the authenticated channel, we can allow much stronger adversaries compared to the existing protocols in the literature. Moreover, our IMAP benefits from a simple structure and works under fewer security assumptions compared to other IMAPs in the literature. The efficient and easy-to-use structure of our IMAP makes it very practical in real world ad hoc network scenarios...|$|E

40|$|Cryptographic hash {{functions}} {{have been}} used to a great extent in many applications; most importantly, as building blocks for digital signature schemes and message authentication codes (MACs), as well as in commitment schemes, password protection, key derivation, and almost every practical cryptographic protocol. Unlike many other cryptographic primitives which are usually intended to fulfill specific security notions, hash functions, as workhorses of cryptography, are often expected to satisfy a wide and application dependent spectrum of security notions, ranging from merely being a one-way function to acting as a truly random function or random oracle (ideal hash). In this Thesis, we revisit the theory and application of cryptographic hash functions. We provide new contributions to this field, which has been explored for over three decades, yet remains a highly active and interesting area of research. We pursue, in particular, a line of research considering essential theoretical questions in regard to the security features of hash functions, including formal definitions of security notions, the relationships among different security notions, and the possibility of designing property-preserving domain extension transforms for hash functions. First, we study notions of security for cryptographic hash functions. Our main goal in this part is to consider the two essential theoretical questions in regard to security notions for hash functions; namely, formal definitions of security notions and the relationships among different security notions. Our contribution in this part includes: a clear categorization of security notions, the introduction of a new set of enhanced security notions and, most importantly, a full picture of the relationships among the security notions. We then investigate the property preservation capabilities of domain extension transforms for hash functions. Almost all cryptographic hash functions are designed based on the following two-step approach: first, a compression function is designed which is only capable of hashing fixed-length messages, then, a domain extension transform is applied to obtain a full-fledged hash function. The possibility of designing a property-preserving domain extension transform, which is also known as a property-preserving mode of operation, is an important problem to be considered with regard to the construction of secure hash functions. We make the following two contributions. Firstly, we analyse the most powerful multi-property-preserving (MPP) domain extension transforms for hash functions in the literature, and provide a full picture of their MPP capabilities with regard to a large collection of known security notions. Secondly, we investigate the capabilities of several different domain extension transforms in regard to preserving an interesting recently proposed security notion, called enhanced target collision resistance (eTCR). Finally, as an interesting application of hash functions, we consider manual channel message authentication protocols using hash functions. In the manual channel model for message authentication, also known as the two-channel or SAS-based model, the sender and the receiver are assumed to have access to a low-bandwidth auxiliary channel, ensuring authentication, in addition to a typical insecure channel; however, neither they share any secret information nor there is any trusted public key infrastructure (PKI). We investigate the problem of random oracle instantiation for a three-round <b>interactive</b> <b>message</b> authentication protocol (IMAP). We also provide an efficient non-interactive message authentication protocol (NIMAP) in the manual channel model that is based on an eTCR hash function...|$|E

Since sport properties have become increasingly interested in fostering customer engagement on social media, {{the purpose of this}} research is {{to examine the effects of}} message orientation, interactivity, and valence in Twitter on customer engagement, relationship quality, and purchase-related outcomes in the context of a live sports broadcast. Specifically, it is hypothesized that <b>interactive</b> <b>messages</b> with positive valence and socioemotional orientation would have a positive influence on sport consumers? engagement behaviors, perceptions of relationship quality, and purchase intentions. A quantitative research design employing a quasi-experiment is utilized in this study. Study participants (N= 255) are randomly assigned to different viewing scenarios in which tweets using eight different communication strategies are seen. The viewing scenarios employed in this research involve a simulated live sports broadcast where tweets from an official team account accompanied the broadcast. After completing the viewing task, participants are asked to complete a questionnaire via Qualtrics online survey software. Univariate analysis of covariance is employed to investigate a series of testable hypotheses.
