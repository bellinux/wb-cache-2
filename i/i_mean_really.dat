The public warmed to her after the separation, and she became one of the key actresses of the 1990s. Her status has continued to grow; in 2008, journalist Sarah Sands stated that Thompson has improved with age and experience, and Mark Kermode said of her performances, [...] "There is something about her which is— you just trust her. You just think 'I'm in proper hands here.' ... She's up there with the great, <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>really</b> great, British female performers".|$|E
2500|$|As {{a result}} of her altered looks and weight gain from her {{rheumatoid}} arthritis treatment, The New York Times published this statement in 2005, [...] "Rumors began circulating that she was drinking too much. She later said in interviews that she didn't bother correcting the rumors because people in show business hire drunks all the time, but not people who are sick." [...] Turner has had well-publicized problems with alcohol, which she used as an escape from the pain and symptoms of acute rheumatoid arthritis. Turner has admitted that because of her illness, she was in constant unbearable agony and that as a result, the people she was closest to would suffer from it, as she was constantly drinking to relieve the pain and it made her a very difficult person. A few weeks after leaving the production of the play The Graduate in November 2002, Turner was admitted into the Marworth hospital in Waverly, Pennsylvania, for the treatment of alcoholism. [...] "I have no problem with alcohol when I'm working," [...] she explained. [...] "It's when I'm home alone that I can't control my drinking...I was going toward excess. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>really!</b> I think I was losing my control over it. So it pulled me back." ...|$|E

Or is it Diana who comes back or is it some other entity? You never know, but we'll see. We'll see if everyone is on-board to do a sequel. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> hope that that would happen." ...|$|R

2500|$|On June 19, 2012, Ichiro led off a {{game against}} the Arizona Diamondbacks with a single to center field, the 2,500th hit of his MLB career. Ichiro reached the {{milestone}} in the fourth-fewest games in major league history, after Al Simmons, Ty Cobb, and George Sisler. In a 13-inning road loss to the Oakland A's on July 8, Ichiro was placed second in the batting order and responded by going 2 for 6 to bring his season batting average to [...]261 heading into the All-Star break. In the previous night's game, Ichiro recorded two hits to break a career-worst 0 for 23 hitless streak. Ichiro had also been tried at the three-spot in the batting order during a season for which he earned $18 million. Former teammate Jay Buhner stated he felt Ichiro was the recipient of too much blame for the Mariners' difficulties but [...] "at the same time, they need help desperately." [...] Buhner stated that if Ichiro were awarded a three-year contract extension for somewhere between $35 million and $40 million, [...] "I'd vomit. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>really,</b> no offense. No offense, we've got to get this organization turned around. You can't be spending all the money on one guy." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "No; <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>really,</b> Tom is a good, steady, sensible, pious fellow. He got {{religion}} at a camp-meeting, four years ago; and I believe {{he really did}} get it. I've trusted him, since then, with everything I have,--money, house, horses,--and let him come and go round the country; and I always found him true and square in everything." ...|$|E
5000|$|When Schmit {{was asked}} about why there were less notable musicians {{compared}} to his last album, he said [...] "I decided {{to stay out of}} the real glamour studios and to keep the clientele down too. I did it on purpose mainly for less distractions. <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> knew what I wanted to do on this album and I decided purposely not to use my famous and semi-famous friends just to have it be more of what I can do on my own. And that's really the reason." ...|$|R

6000|$|Have {{you ever}} thought about--and, when I say thought about, <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>really</b> {{carefully}} considered the question of--the coolness, the cheek, or, if you prefer it, the gall with which Woman, as a sex, fairly bursts? I have, by Jove! But then I've had it thrust on my notice, by George, in a way I should imagine has happened to pretty few fellows. And the limit was reached by that business of the Yeardsley [...] "Venus." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, but <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>really</b> pretty, you know. I've {{always thought}} that all niggers had ugly flat noses an' thick blubber lips. But look at that one: her lips are scarce a bit thicker than those of many a good-looking lass in England, and they don't stick out at all, and her nose ain't flat a bit. It's quite as good as my Nancy's nose, an' that's sayin' a good deal, I tell 'ee. Moreover, she ain't black--she's brown." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, in {{the event}} of your ever being bribed"--he laughed again as with relief. And then as her face seemed to {{challenge}} the word: [...] "Why, to let anything--of your best!--ever leave Dedborough. By which <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>really</b> of course leave the country." [...] She turned again on this, and something in her air made him wonder. [...] "I hope you don't feel there is such a danger? I understood from you half an hour ago that it was unthinkable." ...|$|E

6000|$|Followed this waylaying! Its {{resolute}} character {{makes me}} {{think it was the}} chin's doing; that [...] "common mortal" [...] touch which stands in such good stead to some women. Because men, <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>really</b> masculine men, those whose generations have evolved an ideal woman, are often very timid. Who wouldn't be before the ideal? It's your sentimental trifler, who has just missed being nothing at all, who is enterprising, simply because it is easy to appear enterprising when one does not mean to put one's belief to the test.|$|E
60|$|Apropos, {{how do you}} like, <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>really</b> like, {{the married}} life? Ah, my friend! matrimony is quite a {{different}} thing from what your love-sick youths and sighing girls take it to be! But marriage, we are told, is appointed by God, and I shall never quarrel with any of His institutions. I am a husband of older standing than you, and shall give you my ideas of the conjugal state, (en passant--you know I am no Latinist-is not conjugal derived from jugum, a yoke?) Well, then, the scale of good wifeship I divide into ten parts. Good-nature, four; Good Sense, two; Wit, one; Personal Charms, viz., a sweet face, eloquent eyes, fine limbs, graceful carriage (I would add a fine waist too, but that is so soon spoilt, you know), all these, one; as for the other qualities belonging to, or attending on, a wife, such as Fortune, Connections, Education (I mean education extraordinary), Family blood, etc., divide the two remaining degrees among them as you please; only, remember that all these minor properties must be expressed by fractions, for there is not any one of them, in the aforesaid scale, entitled to the dignity of an integer.|$|E
6000|$|... '"This {{is where}} I was {{prisoner}} for three days," [...] he murmured to me (it {{was on the}} occasion of our visit to the Rajah), while we were making our way slowly through a kind of awestruck riot of dependants across Tunku Allang's courtyard. [...] "Filthy place, isn't it? And I couldn't get anything to eat either, unless I made a row about it, and then it was only a small plate of rice and a fried fish not much bigger than a stickleback--confound them! Jove! I've been hungry prowling inside this stinking enclosure with some of these vagabonds shoving their mugs right under my nose. I had given up that famous revolver of yours at the first demand. Glad {{to get rid of the}} bally thing. Look like a fool walking about with an empty shooting-iron in my hand." [...] At that moment we came into the presence, and he became unflinchingly grave and complimentary with his late captor. Oh! magnificent! I want to laugh when I think of it. But I was impressed, too. The old disreputable Tunku Allang could not help showing his fear (he was no hero, for all the tales of his hot youth he was fond of telling); and at the same time there was a wistful confidence in his manner towards his late prisoner. Note! Even where he would be most hated he was still trusted. Jim--as far as I could follow the conversation--was improving the occasion by the delivery of a lecture. Some poor villagers had been waylaid and robbed while on their way to Doramin's house with a few pieces of gum or beeswax which they wished to exchange for rice. [...] "It was Doramin who was a thief," [...] burst out the Rajah. A shaking fury seemed to enter that old frail body. He writhed weirdly on his mat, gesticulating with his hands and feet, tossing the tangled strings of his mop--an impotent incarnation of rage. There were staring eyes and dropping jaws all around us. Jim began to speak. Resolutely, coolly, and for some time he enlarged upon the text that no man should be prevented from getting his food and his children's food honestly. The other sat like a tailor at his board, one palm on each knee, his head low, and fixing Jim through the grey hair that fell over his very eyes. When Jim had done there was a great stillness. Nobody seemed to breathe even; no one made a sound till the old Rajah sighed faintly, and looking up, with a toss of his head, said quickly, [...] "You hear, my people! No more of these little games." [...] This decree was received in profound silence. A rather heavy man, evidently in a position of confidence, with intelligent eyes, a bony, broad, very dark face, and a cheerily of officious manner (I learned later on he was the executioner), presented to us two cups of coffee on a brass tray, which he took from the hands of an inferior attendant. [...] "You needn't drink," [...] muttered Jim very rapidly. I didn't perceive the meaning at first, and only looked at him. He took a good sip and sat composedly, holding the saucer in his left hand. In a moment I felt excessively annoyed. [...] "Why the devil," [...] I whispered, smiling at him amiably, [...] "do you expose me to such a stupid risk?" [...] I drank, of course, there was nothing for it, while he gave no sign, and almost immediately afterwards we took our leave. While we were going down the courtyard to our boat, escorted by the intelligent and cheery executioner, Jim said he was very sorry. It was the barest chance, of course. Personally he thought nothing of poison. The remotest chance. He was--he assured me--considered to be infinitely more useful than dangerous, and so [...] "But the Rajah is afraid of you abominably. Anybody can see that," [...] I argued with, I own, a certain peevishness, and all the time watching anxiously for the first twist of some sort of ghastly colic. I was awfully disgusted. [...] "If I am to do any good here and preserve my position," [...] he said, taking his seat by my side in the boat, [...] "I must stand the risk: I take it once every month, at least. Many people trust me to do that--for them. Afraid of me! That's just it. Most likely he is afraid of me because I am not afraid of his coffee." [...] Then showing me a place on the north front of the stockade where the pointed tops of several stakes were broken, [...] "This is where I leaped over on my third day in Patusan. They haven't put new stakes there yet. Good leap, eh?" [...] A moment later we passed the mouth of a muddy creek. [...] "This is my second leap. I had a bit of a run and took this one flying, but fell short. Thought I would leave my skin there. Lost my shoes struggling. And all the time I was thinking to myself how beastly it would be to get a jab with a bally long spear while sticking in the mud like this. I remember how sick I felt wriggling in that slime. <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>really</b> sick--as if I had bitten something rotten." ...|$|E
5000|$|It was cool. Nothing popped out. We didn't make out. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>I</b> didn't <b>really</b> hear it was controversial, but I {{went up to}} Twitter to {{see what}} my fans thought about it and they were really enjoyed seeing and Britney Spears up there together, so <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> {{there will be some}} people who will think that that was too sexy but you're always gonna find that, you know. People will always talk whether you're doing bad or good. You just have to do you." ...|$|R
5|$|It's a {{very passionate}} song. It's really, I think maybe, the most passionate {{one on the}} record. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> I'm <b>really</b> proud of it because that's really one that goes {{over-the-top}} {{in the sense that}} it's got images—it has religious imagery of resurrection, it's got images of fertility and rebirth, it has really very good sexual images, images of cars—which I always like.|$|R

5000|$|From Jesus Freak Hideout, {{they believe}} the release {{contains}} [...] "Strong acoustic and electric guitar hooks are accompanied by layers of beautifully woven instrumentation to create impressive dynamic musical backdrops.

5000|$|Drawing {{primarily}} upon influences from classic prog bands such as Kansas, Queen, Rush and Yes while unafraid to {{slip into}} an occasional 80s pop refrain or a classical passage, Jovian Storm created a theatrical style that contradicted the raw, minimalist style of grunge that dominated rock music in the mid-to-late 90s.
