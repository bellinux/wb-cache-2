Herein, we study such <b>intermittent</b> <b>patterns,</b> which we refer to as p-patterns. Our formulation of p-patterns takes into account imprecise time information (e. g., due to unsynchronized clocks in distributed environments), noisy data (e. g., due to extraneous events), and shifts in phase and/or periods. We structure mining for p-patterns as two sub-tasks: (1) finding the periods of p-patterns and (2) mining temporal associations. For (2), a level-wise algorithm is used. For (1), we develop a novel approach based on a chi-squared test, and study its performance in the presence of noise...|$|R

This fact is in stark contrast with predictions of classical fluid mechanics where the no-slip boundary condition is insensitive to the chemistry of the solid substrate. It has been shown that the influence on the flow caused by a steep change in the wettability of the solid substrate can be described in the framework of continuum mechanics using the interface formation theory. The present work extends this study to the case of <b>intermittent</b> <b>patterning.</b> Results show that variations in wettability of the substrate can significantly affect the flow, especially of thin films, which may have applications to the design of microfluidic devices...|$|R

Compared to the expert group consensus gold standard, the highest performance was by individual experts and the non-expert group consensus, followed by automated spindle detectors. This analysis showed that crowdsourcing the scoring of sleep data is an efficient method to collect large data sets, even for difficult tasks such as spindle identification.

40|$|The intermittency, or time {{gaps between}} {{criminal}} events, has received very little {{theoretical and empirical}} attention in developmental/life-course criminology. Several reasons account for lack of research on intermittency, including limited data sources containing information on the time between events and the prioritization of persistence-and especially desistance-in developmental/life-course criminology. This article sets out to provide a descriptive portrait of intermittency {{and in so doing}} aims to understand and explain intermittency within and between individuals, how it varies with age over the life course, and how it covaries with the seriousness of offending. Longer intermittency is characteristic of offenders with earlier onset {{as well as those who}} offend less frequently, whereas high-frequency/early-onset offenders have less intermittency. Findings suggest that intermittent gaps between offenses relate to offense seriousness. As offenders age, the gaps between offenses increase.

This paper investigates the spells between investment spikes in a discrete-time proportional hazard framework {{to estimate the}} probability of observing lumpy investment and factors underlying lumpy and <b>intermittent</b> <b>patterns</b> of investment. Duration models were estimated on two datasets: on an unbalanced panel and on average data of 10 'firm size' groups of Dutch greenhouse firms over the period 1975 - 1999. Two specifications of the model were estimated: one includes only theoretically grounded variables, and the other specification is extended by empirically grounded variables. Theoretically based models can explain the occurrence of investment spikes. Both specifications of model show an investment cycle of six[*]years. This is also confirmed for the average firm, which exhibits a higher hazard ratio in the 6 th, 12 - 13 th and 21 st years of duration. Copyright (c) 2008 The Authors.

40|$|Multiplicative random cascades (MRC) can parsimoniously {{generate}} highly <b>intermittent</b> <b>patterns</b> {{similar to}} those in rainfall. The elemental MRC model parameter is the cascade weight, which determines how rainfall at one scale is partitioned at the next smallest scale in the cascade. While it is known that the probability density of these weights may vary with both timescale and rainfall intensity, nearly all previous studies have considered either timescale or intensity separately. We examined the simultaneous dependency of the weights on both factors and assessed the impacts of explicitly including these dependencies in the MRC model. Based on the observed relationships between cascade weights and timescale and intensity, four progressively more “dependent ” models were constructed to disaggregate a long time series of daily rainfall to hourly intervals. We found that inclusion of the intensity dependency on the model parameters that generate dry intervals greatly improved performance. For the relatively small range of time scales over which the rainfall was disaggregated, varying model parameters with timescale resulted in minor improvement. 2 1...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{simulate}} intermittent turbulence (also {{known as}} bursting events) in stably stratified open-channel flows using direct numerical simulation. Clear signatures of this intriguing phenomenon are observed {{for a range}} of stabilities. However, the spatiotemporal characteristics of intermittency are found to be strongly stability dependent. In general, the bursting events are much more frequent near the bottom wall than in the upper-channel region. A steady coexistence of laminar and turbulent flows is detected at various horizontal planes in very stable cases. This spatially <b>intermittent</b> <b>pattern</b> is found to propagate downstream and strongly correlate with the temporal evolution of intermittency. Lastly, a long standing hypothesis by Blackadar (1979), i. e., the strong connection between local stability and intermittent turbulence, is corroborated by this modeling study...|$|E

We also computed the temporal variations of scale-averaged wavelet power and wavelet entropy (WE). An <b>intermittent</b> <b>pattern</b> is characterized by large amounts of power over very {{short periods of time}} separated by almost quiescent periods. Time-localized changes in WE further support the evidence of intermittency. The cause and significance of the intermittent beta activity are presently unclear.

Herein, we investigate the statistical {{properties of the}} swimming behavior {{of two of the}} most common freshwater and marine zooplankters, the cladoceran, Daphnia pulex, and the copepod, Temora longicornis. Both species undergo a very structured type of trajectory, with successive moves displaying intermittent ampli-tudes. We present an original statistical procedure, derived from the fields of turbulence and anomalous diffu-sion and specifically devoted to the characterization of <b>intermittent</b> <b>patterns.</b> We then show that the swimming paths belong to“multifractal random walks”, characterized by a nonlinear moment scaling function for distance versus time. This clearly differs from the traditional Brownian and fractional Brownian walks expected or previ-ously detected in animal behaviors. More specifically, we have identified differential behaviors in the horizontal and vertical planes. This suggests the existence of reminiscence of diel vertical migration as a predator-avoid-ance strategy or differential swimming behaviors related to mating, feeding, or predator-avoidance strategies. We also compare the structure of the swimming paths to the multifractal behavior of microscale phytoplankton distributions demonstrated in turbulent environments, and briefly discuss the potential causes of the observe...|$|R
40|$|In {{fluctuating}} aquatic environments such as intermittent streams, fish {{condition is}} often highly variable {{due to the}} associated fluctuating levels of food resources. Having the physiological capacity to both metabolise and catabolise lipids, fish can survive through droughts and rapidly gain condition during flows and floods. Dryland rivers continuously cycle through periods of boom and bust due to their <b>intermittent</b> <b>patterns</b> of rainfall and flow. To help {{gain an understanding of}} how fish respond physiologically to varying antecedent flow conditions, we examined body condition measured by percent tissue water content of two generalist fish species in an Australian dryland river. We predicted that fish would be in better condition following recent flows and poorer condition when there had been no recent flows. Our expectations were met for both species with low water tissue content after high flows and high tissue water content after significant drying. It was also found that strong juvenile recruitment was also evident when body condition was high, indicating that when there are food resource spikes driven by flow pulses fish can utilise resources both to produce offspring and to store as lipid for future survival.

40|$|A massive MIMO system, {{represented}} by a base station with hundreds of antennas, is capable of spatially multiplexing many devices and thus naturally suited to serve dense crowds of wireless devices in emerging applications, such as machine-type communications. Crowd scenarios pose new challenges in the pilot-based acquisition of channel state information and call for pilot access protocols that match the <b>intermittent</b> <b>pattern</b> of device activity. A joint pilot assignment and data transmission protocol based on random access is proposed in this paper for the uplink of a massive MIMO system. The protocol relies on the averaging across multiple transmission slots of the pilot collision events that result from the random access process.

Simplified bounds are obtained and used to optimize the device activation probability and pilot length.

The instrument, called a Computerized Electro-Oculograph (CEOG), is an integrated computer-controlled system which performs a series of important diagnostic tests. It can generate and control the stimulus, as well as record patient responses, testing both the visual and oculomotor systems, and also provide a regular pattern applicable to both clinical and research purposes. Visual evoked response and eye movement data is processed by computer for quantitative analysis and “strip chart” data is then displayed on a scrolling T. V. screen.

These discontinuous {{gas exchange}} cycles (DGCs) {{are known to}} have evolved independently within five insect orders, but their possible adaptive benefit and evolutionary origin remain an enigma. Current research is primarily concerned with testing three adaptive hypotheses: that DGCs originally evolved or are currently maintained to (1) limit respiratory water loss, (2) enhance gas exchange in subterranean environments, or (3) limit oxidative damage. These adaptive explanations fail to unite a range of apparently contradictory observations regarding the insects that display DGCs and the conditions under which they occur. Here we argue that DGCs are explained by circadian, developmental, or artificially induced reductions in brain activity.

However, the precise relationship between UVR and the risk of NMSC is complex, and the relationship may differ by skin cancer type. It has been hypothesized that <b>intermittent</b> <b>patterns</b> and childhood sunlight exposure are important for BCC while continuous (chronic) and lifelong (i. e. childhood and adulthood) sunlight exposure is important for SCC.

The goal of the research study was to evaluate the relationship between levels of sunlight exposure and BCC and SCC and to investigate differences in sunlight-associated BCC and SCC risk by genus-specific cutaneous HPV serostatus.
