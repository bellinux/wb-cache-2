40|$|ABSTRACT: Mises {{created an}} {{artificial}} construct, the evenly rotating economy (ERE), {{from which to}} ascertain the source of entrepreneurial profit and loss. In particular, the <b>ERE</b> is <b>characterized</b> by two distinct elements. First is {{the elimination of the}} temporal element, second is the removal of changing market data. The second point necessarily arises from the first. Is it possible that the efficient market hypothesis (EMH), despite its practical flaws, may be used as a similar theoretical construct? If we envision a similar state of affairs as under the ERE, is it possible to grasp more fully the effect that information has on prices? We argue that it cannot, for two main reasons.

40|$|The {{compounds}} of formula [Cu(Tsgly) (bpy) L] and anhydrous [Cu(Tsgly) (bpy) ] (Tsgly = N-tosylglycinate dianion; bpy= 2, 2 ’-bipyridine;L = EtOH, H 20) w <b>ere</b> synthesized and <b>characterized</b> {{by means}} of thermogravimetric, electronic, infrared,and EPR spectra. For one of them, the [Cu(Tsgly) (bpy) (EtOH) ] complex, the crystal structure was also determined. The structure consists of discrete molecular unitsof [Cu(Tsgly) (bpy) (EtOH) ]. The Cu atom shows tetrahedrally distorted square-pyramidal N 3 O 2 coordination. The Tsglydianion and the bpy molecule act as bidentate ligands in the equatorial plane, and the ethanol is bonded to the metal atomin the apical position. The thermogravimetric, EPR, and electronic results for the aquo and ethanol derivatives suggestthat {{the stability of the}} in-plane ligands permits successive substitution reactions at the apical position. The infrared spectrafor the aquo and ethanol adducts are consistent with the presence of a coordinated water or ethanol molecule...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn late 1996 in France, {{a severe}} {{digestive}} disease appeared in fattening domestic rabbits. Named the Epizootic Rabbit Enteropathy (ERE), this digestive syndrome {{has become the}} main cause of mortality in rabbit farming. The diagnosis in field conditions is difficult because co-infection with other common rabbit pathogens is frequent. By using specific pathogenic free (SPF) rabbits and starting from a field sample of intestinal contents of diseased animals, a virulent material (inoculum) was obtained free of almost all known pathogens but reproduced the symptoms and lesions of ERE. Four hundred and seven SPF rabbits were used in five trials to describe the disease. <b>ERE</b> is <b>characterized</b> by a high contagiousness, 30 to 40 % mortality in a few days and about 100 % morbidity whatever the dose of the inoculum used. Clinical signs and lesions evolved acutely with the first sign (rambling noise) appearing one day after inoculation and the disease peaking 4 to 6  days later. Growth was strongly lowered from the second day {{to the end of the}} second week. Rambling noise and distended abdomen were frequent, mucus excretion and cecal impaction were frequent but not constant. ERE at necropsy was characterized by the absence of any inflammatory or congestive lesions on the gut or on other organs but with the typical presence of a stomach and/or duodenum dilated by liquid and gas and by the absence of specific histological lesions. The etiological agent has not been identified yet, but we demonstrate that the intestinal content was infectious as early as the second day. This work constitutes the experimental basis for studies on this emerging disease within the framework of etiological research led in different European laboratories working with the infectious material...|$|R
