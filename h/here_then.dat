5|$|The coast now {{shows the}} open and ancient {{landscape}} of the Penwith district along a series of wild headlands such as Clodgy Point, Hor Point, Pen Enys Point, and Carn Naun Point. The Carracks lie just offshore, locally known as Seal Island (and seals can often be seen close to the shore opposite <b>here),</b> <b>then</b> there lies Zennor Head and Gurnard's Head as the Path leads into Morvah, although the village proper lies inland. Portheras Cove is a relief from the many small rocky bays along this coast but the cliffs then continue beyond the iconic, disused Crowns Mine at Botallack.|$|E

25|$|For about {{a century}} after {{achieving}} {{its status as a}} city in 1846, Hamilton has seen itself in terms of industrial production. It adopted or acquired such nicknames as the Ambitious City, Steel City and the Birmingham of Canada. However, after this period, other sectors of the economy took over and Hamilton became a post-industrial economy but failed to change its image and self-image to match. <b>Here</b> <b>then</b> follows the growth of the Hamilton {{until the end of the}} Second World War.|$|E
25|$|The {{philosophies of}} Torah Umadda and Religious Zionism {{are not in}} any direct conflict, and {{generally}} coexist sharing both values and adherents. However, more conservative Religious Zionists differ with Torah Umadda in its approach to secular knowledge. In this view, engagement with secular ideas and situations is permissible and encouraged, but only insofar as this benefits the State of Israel. <b>Here,</b> <b>then,</b> secular knowledge is viewed as valuable for practical ends, though not in and of itself. Thus, for example, in contrast to Torah Umadda, the study of literature and the humanities is discouraged here, whereas the study of engineering or medicine (and with subsequent practice in Israel) is deemed to be valuable.|$|E
25|$|<b>Here</b> <b>then</b> De Morgan {{had made}} a great advance by {{introducing}} quantification of the terms. At that time Sir William Hamilton was teaching in Edinburgh a doctrine of the quantification of the predicate, and a correspondence sprang up. However, De Morgan soon perceived that Hamilton's quantification was of a different character; that it meant for example, substituting the two forms The whole of A is the whole of B, and The whole of A {{is a part of}} B for the Aristotelian form All A's are B's. Hamilton thought that he had placed the keystone in the Aristotelian arch, as he phrased it. Although {{it must have been a}} curious arch which could stand 2000 years without a keystone. As a consequence he had no room for De Morgan's innovations. He accused De Morgan of plagiarism, and the controversy raged for years in the columns of the Athenæum, and in the publications of the two writers.|$|E
