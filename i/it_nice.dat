500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Part of Me" [...] was {{directed}} by Ben Mor. Filming began on February 16, 2012, and took place {{over the course of}} three days at USMC Camp Pendleton in Oceanside, California. Perry announced the video shortly after the song's release, tweeting, [...] "Holy power of the Grammy's, Part Of Me is already top 10 on itunes! U guys are killing <b>it!</b> <b>NICE!</b> Can't wait to shoot this video! #grateful." [...] Her preparation for the video shoot included vigorous training in military basics, including firepower, military etiquette, and combat training.|$|E

Cantrell is a lifelong Seahawks fan and often attends their games. In August 2015, Bassist Mike Inez said that the band had been [...] "throwing around riffs for a new record" [...] and [...] "taking <b>it</b> <b>nice</b> and slow." [...] The band toured {{in the summer of}} 2015 and the summer of 2016, including select shows opening for Guns N' Roses as part of the Not in This Lifetime... Tour.|$|E
500|$|... "Circle the Drain" [...] {{is a song}} by American singer Katy Perry, {{from her}} third studio album, Teenage Dream (2010). It was written by Perry, Christopher [...] "Tricky" [...] Stewart and Monte Neuble. Lyrically, [...] "Circle the Drain" [...] candidly focuses on a former lover's drug-addiction and the strains it put on both of them. Following its release, several media outlets {{reported}} it to {{have been inspired by}} her former relationship with Travie McCoy. Critics were divided on the track, with some finding Perry to be in a hypocritical position, given the album's other material. Other reviewers found <b>it</b> <b>nice</b> to see a different side to the singer.|$|E

500|$|The {{majority}} of [...] "Cog" [...] {{takes place in}} complete silence, the only sounds coming from the collisions of the pieces themselves. This is broken with the activation of the CD player from the Accord, which begins playing The Sugarhill Gang's 1979 single [...] "Rapper's Delight". The sequence ends when the button of an electronic key fob is pressed, closing the hatchback of a fully [...] assembled Honda Accord on a carefully balanced trailer. The car rolls off the trailer, and {{stops in front of}} a tonneau cover bearing the [...] "Accord" [...] marque, while narrator Garrison Keillor asks [...] "Isn't <b>it</b> <b>nice</b> when things just work?". The screen fades to white and the piece closes on the Honda logo and the brand's motto, [...] "The Power of Dreams".|$|E
500|$|Actor Joshua Jackson {{was pleased}} that Wyman directed, as he found <b>it</b> <b>nice</b> to have [...] "somebody who's in the writer's room day-in and day-out and knows the show so intimately, come in and jump behind the camera and are just a font of information." [...] Seth Gabel was also happy with Wyman's direction, as the two were able to discuss themes in the script {{as well as how}} Wyman planned to shoot certain scenes. Gabel remarked that the {{director}} [...] "wanted to do this fun thing that actually related to Lincoln's feelings about Olivia and how they were changing based on everything that's been happening. We played so many things that weren't in the script, that were between the lines in just looks, and he told me how he was gonna shoot it so I could really play with what the character was thinking and know that it would actually be seen in the end, and not end up on the cutting room floor because it wasn't in the script." ...|$|E
500|$|Stevenson {{suggested}} an alternative cover. He instructed the Polydor art department to design artwork using four statues from the Guards Memorial, from a photo session the band had recently done {{in front of}} the monument which commemorates the war dead of the First World War. Four of the soldier statues were cut out from the shot of the band. Siouxsie found the sleeve a workable solution, as she was drawn in by the imagery conjured up by the words for [...] "In Flanders Fields", which inspired [...] "Poppy Day". For her, it was the linchpin for the album. The poppy reproduced on the album cover is a symbol of Remembrance Day. The designer, Rob O'Connor, said about the layout: [...] "The wreath of poppies was devised to help add colour and create a graphic device". An embossed sleeve was planned, with the four soldiers inked in the card, but was not used because the band did not receive the proofs in time. Morris and McKay blamed Stevenson, Siouxsie and Severin, although it was Polydor that refused the extra expense at the last minute. Nevertheless, Severin succeeded in pushing for a gatefold cover: [...] "We wanted it all white because you were supposed to do it all black, and you were supposed to have blackmail lettering on it and so we had <b>it</b> <b>nice</b> and classic", he stated. Maybury's drawings of the band were used on the inner spread; it was {{the only part of the}} original design that survived.|$|E

500|$|The {{original}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Paul Hunter, known {{for his work on}} previous Michael Jackson and TLC clips. However, for unknown reasons, the video was scrapped, and Hilson re-shot a clip for the video with [...] "Knock You Down" [...] and [...] "Number One" [...] director Chris Robinson. Robinson told Rap-Up, [...] "Keri Hilson has a great personality and is a real girl. That’s what we want to get across." [...] He also talked about the premise and plot of the video, stating that the video portrays Hilson as a woman who doesn't take herself seriously, commenting, [...] "It’s a really sexy song, but we don’t want to fall into the typical love, love, love R vibe with that... it starts where you think, ‘Oh, it’s about her and being sexy.' She’s in her house and by herself, and you kind of think it could be serious, but the song drops out in the middle and her friends catch her being all sexy, basically like, ‘What the f**k [...] are you doing? You are not singing by yourself.’" [...] In an interview with That Grape Juice, when asked about the video and on the sensuality of the live performances compared to video, Hilson responded, [...] "Yeah. It is a bit of that, but it’s a bit toned down for the video, because you got so much censoring, I can’t do everything I do on stage (laughs). So when people come out they’re probably still gonna be a bit surprised to see it live, after seeing the video. But I’m very pleased with the video. I love the colours and it’s reminiscent of the whole late 70s early 80s era in music." [...] Chris Brown, Omarion, Monica, Melody Thornton, and Polow Da Don all appear in the video. The video begins with Hilson, dressed lavishly, arriving late to a Jeep full of the previous stated people. The clip flips back to what happened earlier that night, showing Hilson getting ready in a seductive fashion, as she chooses perfume and picks out clothes. Scenes of Hilson performing in front of a leather-like wall are interspersed in between her and her friends riding down a boulevard to the club. Once she arrives to the club, she is attracted to a particular man, and subsequently performs elaborate, sensual choreography with him and other dancers, before slow dancing. VIBE said, [...] "Keri Hilson is fine as wine. You know it. We know it. And she knows it. But for the doubters, she proves it once again with this seductive new video from In A Perfect World." [...] A writer for Rap-Up said that Hilson, [...] "takes <b>it</b> <b>nice</b> and slow in the video for 'Slow Dance.'" [...] The video ranked at number 80 on [...] Top 100 Videos of 2009 countdown.|$|E
2500|$|In 2003, Honda {{released}} its Cog advertisement in the UK {{and on the}} Internet. To make the ad, the engineers at Honda constructed a Rube Goldberg Machine made entirely out of car parts from a Honda Accord Touring. To the chagrin of the engineers at Honda, all the parts were taken from two of only six hand-assembled pre-production models of the Accord. The advertisement depicted a single cog which sets off {{a chain of events}} that ends with the Honda Accord moving and Garrison Keillor speaking the tagline, [...] "Isn't <b>it</b> <b>nice</b> when things just... work?" [...] It took 606 takes to get it perfect.|$|E
2500|$|On March 1, 2011, it was {{reported}} that the Statler Hilton building and the adjoining library had been sold to a developer, Leobardo Trevino, who intends to restore it. [...] "Right now," [...] he said, [...] "the plans are to clean it up and restore the exterior and make <b>it</b> <b>nice.</b> We'll gut it and take it down to the concrete...But our plans are to restore it to the original and make it look like it did in 1956. We love the property." [...] Trevino's group is also restoring 1600 Pacific Tower in downtown Dallas. In March 2012, it was revealed that a previously forgotten, 40-foot-long mural from 1956 had been discovered during renovation of the building.|$|E

2500|$|Voiceover {{artist for}} Honda UK's [...] "the Power of Dreams" [...] campaign. The campaign's most memorable {{advertisement}} is the 2003 Honda Accord commercial Cog, {{which features a}} Heath Robinson contraption (or Rube Goldberg Machine) made entirely of car parts. The commercial ends with Keillor asking, [...] "Isn't <b>it</b> <b>nice</b> when things just work?" [...] Since then, Keillor has voiced the tagline for {{most if not all}} UK Honda advertisements, and even sang the voiceover in the 2004 Honda Diesel commercial Grrr. His most recent ad was a reworking of an existing commercial with digitally added England flags to tie in with the World Cup. Keillor's tagline was [...] "Come on, England, keep the dream alive." ...|$|E
2500|$|When Benaderet {{was cast}} in Petticoat Junction, she was hailed as having [...] "finally" [...] become a star. She had {{previously}} played supporting roles throughout her career, usually as a next-door neighbor, and had been openly averse to leading roles. However, in January 1963, following CBS' acquisition of Petticoat Junction, she enthused to Eve Starr of The Mercury: [...] "Isn't <b>it</b> <b>nice?</b> After all these years. ... just {{never occurred to me}} that it might...golly, my own show!” During promotional interviews, Benaderet often discussed facets of the acting profession with reporters, and believed that leading a series required a [...] "feeling of responsibility", including her being more observant of on-set activity and her costars' performances, while continuously evolving her character.|$|E
2500|$|Shortly after Hudson's {{press release}} {{disclosing}} his infection, William M. Hoffman, {{the author of}} As Is, a play about AIDS that appeared on Broadway in 1985, stated: [...] "If Rock Hudson can have <b>it,</b> <b>nice</b> people can have it. It's just a disease, not a moral affliction." [...] At the same time, Joan Rivers was quoted as saying: [...] "Two years ago, when I hosted a benefit for AIDS, I couldn't get one major star to turn out. ... Rock's admission is a horrendous way to bring AIDS {{to the attention of}} the American public, but by doing so, Rock, in his life, has helped millions in the process. What Rock has done takes true courage." [...] Morgan Fairchild said that [...] "Rock Hudson's death gave AIDS a face." [...] In a telegram Hudson sent to a September 1985 Hollywood AIDS benefit, Commitment to Life, which he was too ill to attend in person, Hudson said: [...] "I am not happy that I am sick. I am not happy that I have AIDS. But if that is helping others, I can at least know that my own misfortune has had some positive worth." ...|$|E

A 1978 film starring Suzanne Somers was entitled Zuma Beach. In the 1990s and 2000s (decade), it was the setting for MTV Beach House, Malibu's Most Wanted, and Nickelodeon's Zoey 101. In the Coen Brothers 1998 motion picture The Big Lebowski, the fictional chief of police describes it thus: [...] "We've got a nice, quiet beach community here, and I aim to keep <b>it</b> <b>nice</b> and quiet".
