40|$|We {{intend to}} build a global {{environmental}} impact indicator of air pollution to assess transport infrastructures, technologies or flows. This indicator tries to be simple and transparent to facilitate its use in decision-making. The intention is for the indicator {{to be like the}} Global Warming Potential (GWP), which establishes a relationship between the emission of six greenhouse gases and the average temperature increase of the Earth. The indicator therefore allows estimating the global environmental impact of transport-generated air pollution, while simultaneously conserving the value of the environmental impact of each type of air pollution and the emission assessment. This work is based on an environmental impact typology, a set of indicators, and aggregation architecture of atmospheric pollution. The typology is established {{as a function of the}} specific and homogenous characteristics of each type of pollution in terms of pollutants, impact mechanisms, targets and environmental impacts. To ensure exhaustiveness and non-redundancy, 10 types of air pollution impact are proposed: greenhouse effect, ozone depletion, direct ecotoxicity (this type of pollution excludes greenhouse effects on nature, ozone depletion, eutrophication, acidification and photochemical pollution), eutrophication, acidification, photochemical pollution, restricted direct health effects (not taking into account welfare, and excluding the effects on health of the greenhouse effect, ozone depletion, acidification and photochemical pollution), sensitive pollution (annoyance caused by odours and fumes), and degradation of common and historical man-made heritage. Indicators similar to GWP can be identified in the literature for each type of atmospheric pollution, except for the degradation of common and historical man-made heritage, for which none indicator have been suggested. However, these indicators do not seem to have achieved wide scientific consensus, except for GWP, which may make it necessary to continue research in this field. Aggregating the different indicators is proposed by using an architecture composed of two structures that aggregate types of air pollution. One is based on the target affected, whereas the second has three dimensions, i. e. targets, space and time. This architecture allows also the indicator's users to establish a hierarchy of concerns for each type of atmospheric pollution. The indicator makes thus it possible to give a global value to impact of air pollutants, taking into account scientific assessment and social perception.

40|$|Agriculture {{is under}} {{environmental}} pressure since its modernization, mainly after the Second World War, which generated {{the use of}} large quantities of chemical products as pesticides and fertilizers. However, during the three last décades, {{the preservation of the}} quality of the environment progressively became a priority of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and different measures were successively implemented, some of them being compulsory and other ones not, or not yet. This paper focuses on the implementation of agricultural Policy measures at the regional level of Wallonia, the Southern part of Belgium, a founder state of the European Union. Three aspects are presented and analyzed: (1) the greening of the CAP, through the so-called "green payment" and its conséquences (permanent pasture maintenance, crop diversification, and the establishment of ecological focus areas); (2) the development of organic farming; and (3) the increasing number of specific quality labels. The paper argues that, supported by the CAP and the Walloon regional government through financial, research, education, extension, and advertising measures, the Walloon agriculture is farmed on the direction toward a more sustainable model, a more resilient onte to <b>environnemental</b> pressure.

40|$|Early damage {{detection}} of structure’s joints {{is essential in}} order to ensure the integrity of structures. Vibration-based methods are the most popular way of diagnosing damage in machinery joints. Any technique that is used for such a purpose requiers dealing with the variability inherent to the system due to manufacturing tolérances, <b>environnemental</b> conditions or aging. The level of variability in vibrational response can be very high for mass-produced complex structures that possess a large number of components. In this study, a simple and efficient time frequency method is proposed for detection of damage in connecting joints. The method suggests using singular spectrum analysis for building a reference space from the signals measured on a healthy structure and then compares all other signals to that reference space in order to detect the presence of faults. A model of two plates connected by a series of mounts is used to examine the effectiveness of the method where the uncertainty in the mount properties is taken into account to model the variability in the built-up structure. The motivation behind the simplified model is to identify the faulty mounts in trim-structure joints of an automotive vehicle where a large number of simple plastic clips are used to connect the trims to the vehicle structure...|$|E

Three levels of strategic highway development are presented. The first is the re-capitalization of existing park roads. Examples are presented from several national parks where parkways and low-volume roads were reconstructed or repaired in ways to reduce terrain impacts. The second {{is the development of}} the passing lane system on the Trans-Canada Highway in the Rocky Mountain national parks to defer twinning. The third example is the twinning of 18. 6 km of the Trans-Canada Highway. Twinning represents a logical next step following the passing lane phase. This paper {{describes how}} highway engineering improvements were developed to address and mitigate numerous potential twinning impacts identified during environmental assessment.

40|$|AbstractClostridium difficile is {{responsible}} for 15 – 25 % of cases of antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) and for virtually all cases of antibiotic-associated pseudomembranous colitis (PMC). This anaerobic bacterium {{has been identified as}} the leading cause of nosocomial infectious diarrhea in adults and can be responsible for large outbreaks. Nosocomial C. difficile infection results in an increased length of stay in hospital ranging from 8 to 21 days. Risk factors for C. difficile-associated diarrhea include antimicrobial therapy, older age (> 65 years), antineoplastic chemotherapy and length of hospital stay. Other interventions with high risk associations are enemas, nasogastric tubes, gastrointestinal surgery and antiperistaltic drugs. Prospective studies have shown that nosocomial transmission of C. difficile is frequent but often remains asymptomatic. Patients can be contaminated from <b>environnemental</b> surfaces, shared instrumentation, hospital personnel hands and infected roommates. Once an outbreak starts, C. difficile may be spread rapidly throughout the hospital environment where spores may persist for months. Measures that are effective in reducing incidence of C. difficile infections and cross-infection include: (i) an accurate and rapid diagnosis, (ii) appropriate treatment, (iii) implementation of enteric precautions for symptomatic patients, (iv) reinforcement of hand-washing, (v) daily environmental disinfection, and (vi) a restrictive antibiotic policy. C. difficile is a common cause of infectious diarrhea and should be therefore systematically investigated in patients with nosocomial diarrhea...|$|E

Awareness of the need to manage this vulnerable environment, has led in recent years, to an increase in surveillance activities of the environmental quality. Physico-chemical methods, although dominant and indispensable, reach their limits as a tool for environmental management. This is why other ways are being explored, such as evaluating the environmental quality by bio-indicators. It is in this perspective that SEMHABEL project is subscribed (Suivi <b>Environnemental</b> des Micro-HAbitats Benthiques de l’Estuaire de la Loire - Plan Loire Grandeur Nature 2007 - 2013 - FEDER). This is the first study in the Loire incorporating the use of benthic foraminifera as a new biological approach.

The data obtained allowed to represent and analyze the spatial distribution of communities of benthic foraminifera, along the upstream-downstream continuum and following geochemical and sedimentary evolutions. These results are the first support for the establishment of a database that will allow a better understanding of the actual functioning of this ecosystem.
