5000|$|... α-Ethyl{{tryptamine}} (αET, AET), {{also known}} as <b>etryptamine</b> (INN, BAN, USAN), is a psychedelic, stimulant, and entactogenic drug of the tryptamine class. It was originally developed and marketed as an antidepressant under the brand name Monase by Upjohn in the 1960s.|$|E
50|$|Amiflamine shows {{preference}} for inhibiting MAO-A in serotonergic relative to noradrenergic and dopaminergic neurons. In other words, at low doses, {{it can be}} used to selectively inhibit MAO-A enzymes in serotonin cells, whereas at higher doses it loses its selectivity. This property is attributed to amiflamine's higher affinity for the serotonin transporter over the norepinephrine and dopamine transporters, as transporter-mediated carriage is required for amiflamine to enter monoaminergic neurons. Other RIMAs such as Esfand, <b>etryptamine</b> & moclobemide would also be expected to behave similarly.|$|E
50|$|It is {{interesting}} to note that isoniazid also displayed activity as an antidepressant, even though it is not a MAOI. This led some people to question whether it is some property of the hydrazine, which is responsible for mediating the antidepressant effect, even going as far as to state that the MAOI activity could be a secondary side-effect. However, with the discovery of tranylcypromine (the first non-hydrazine MAOI), it was shown that MAOI is thought to underlie the antidepressant bioactivity of these agents. <b>Etryptamine</b> is another example of a non-hydrazine MAOI that was introduced.|$|E
