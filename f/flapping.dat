5|$|Hummingbirds {{are small}} birds capable of {{hovering}} in mid-air {{due to the}} rapid <b>flapping</b> of their wings. They are the only birds that can fly backward.|$|E

5|$|As in {{the wings}} of modern birds, the flight {{feathers}} of Archaeopteryx were somewhat asymmetrical and the tail feathers were rather broad. This implies that the wings and tail were used for lift generation, but {{it is unclear whether}} Archaeopteryx was capable of <b>flapping</b> flight or simply a glider. The lack of a bony breastbone suggests that Archaeopteryx was not a very strong flier, but flight muscles might have attached to the thick, boomerang-shaped wishbone, the platelike coracoids, or perhaps, to a cartilaginous sternum. The sideways orientation of the glenoid (shoulder) joint between scapula, coracoid, and humerus—instead of the dorsally angled arrangement found in modern birds—may indicate that Archaeopteryx was unable to lift its wings above its back, a requirement for the upstroke found in modern <b>flapping</b> flight. According to a study by Philip Senter in 2006, Archaeopteryx was indeed unable to use <b>flapping</b> flight as modern birds do, but it may well have used a downstroke-only flap-assisted gliding technique.|$|E
30|$|The palatal <b>flap</b> has {{different}} forms {{that can be}} classified by thickness, namely, mucoperiosteal, or by the direction of movement, namely, straight advancement <b>flap,</b> rotation advancement <b>flap,</b> hinged <b>flap,</b> pedicled island <b>flap,</b> anteriorly based <b>flap,</b> submucosal connective tissue pedicle <b>flap,</b> and submucosal island <b>flap.</b>|$|R
40|$|Covering {{soft tissue}} defects remains {{challenging}} for orthopaedic surgeons, {{especially those in}} resource-challenged facilities. Covering tissue defects follow a plan from simple to complex: primary closure, local <b>flap,</b> area <b>flap,</b> pedicle <b>flap,</b> and free <b>flap.</b> I will limit my discussion {{to the role of}} latter two. At the district-level hospital in Vietnam, pedicle <b>flaps</b> are generally more useful, so I will discuss free <b>flaps</b> only briefly. The choices of pedicle <b>flaps</b> include: kite <b>flap,</b> posterior interosseous <b>flap,</b> radial <b>flap</b> (Chinese <b>flap),</b> neurocutaneous <b>flap,</b> anterolateral thigh fasciocutaneous <b>flap,</b> gastrocnemius <b>flap,</b> sural <b>flap,</b> posterior leg flaps; we typically use a free <b>flap</b> with the latissimus dorsi. Soft tissue coverage with pedicle <b>flaps</b> has many advantages: reliability, relatively easy harvest, and good blood supply. Free <b>flaps</b> with microanastomosis have an important place in covering difficult medium- or large-sized soft tissue defects but also require more instruments and more highly trained surgeons...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the scheme to select alternative <b>flaps</b> {{limited to the}} region of the ipsilateral thigh when the perforator of the anterolateral thigh <b>flap</b> is not feasible. Total of 564 consecutive microsurgery cases using anterolateral thigh perforator <b>flap</b> was reviewed from March of 2001 to January of 2009. Total of 12 cases used a contingent <b>flap</b> due to anatomical and technical complications of the anterolateral thigh perforator. The alternatives were skin perforator <b>flaps</b> adjacent to the initial <b>flap</b> (3 cases of upper anterolateral thigh <b>flap,</b> 4 cases of anteromedial thigh <b>flap),</b> vastus lateralis muscle <b>flap</b> with skin graft (2 cases), and anterolateral thigh <b>flap</b> as septocutaneous <b>flap</b> without a prominent perforator on the septum (3 cases). All <b>flaps</b> survived and provided coverage as planned but one case using septocutaneous <b>flap</b> without a prominent perforator was noted with partial necrosis. Adjacent <b>flaps</b> around the anterolateral thigh perforator <b>flap</b> may provide useful alternative <b>flaps</b> in cases of failed elevation. Limiting the contingent secondary <b>flap</b> to this region may reduce further donor site morbidity and still provide an adequate <b>flap</b> for reconstruction...|$|R

40|$|This article {{attempts}} to put perforator <b>flaps,</b> as {{they apply to}} head and neck reconstruction, into perspective. The importance of existing <b>flaps</b> is emphasized. Specific indications for perforator <b>flaps</b> are highlighted. The deep inferior epigastric artery perforator <b>flap</b> is used as the <b>flap</b> of choice for subtotal glossectomy defects by the authors. The anterolateral thigh <b>flap</b> {{is the most common}} <b>flap</b> currently used. Indications for its use are highlighted. Facial artery perforator <b>flaps</b> are introduced, and their roles as local <b>flaps</b> in head and neck reconstruction are highlighted. With our better understanding of vascular anatomy, existing <b>flaps</b> such as the submental <b>flap</b> have been recategorized as perforator <b>flaps.</b> Its role in reconstruction, particularly of lower facial defects, is discussed. Finally the internal mammary artery perforator <b>flap</b> is described and its advantages over the deltopectoral <b>flap</b> and the pectoralis major <b>flap</b> outlined...|$|R
50|$|The <b>flaps</b> are {{operated}} by a ceiling-mounted <b>flap</b> handle with detents for 0, 15 and 30 degrees of deflection. The <b>flaps</b> are controlled directly with the handle attached to a <b>flap</b> centre-section behind the fuselage and the wing <b>flaps</b> plug into the <b>flap</b> centre-section. <b>Flaps</b> are normally set to 15 degrees for takeoff and 30 degrees for landing.|$|R
40|$|Despite {{the great}} number of pedicled and free <b>flaps</b> that are {{available}} for defect and contour repair, the number of fascia <b>flaps</b> with an axial blood supply are sparse. Such <b>flaps</b> with their gliding function are mandatory, whenever coverage with very thin, well-vascularized tissue is necessary. To the currently established fascia <b>flaps,</b> (the temporoparietal fascia <b>flap,</b> the radial forearm fascia <b>flap,</b> the lateral arm fascia <b>flap,</b> and the serratus anterior fascia <b>flap),</b> we want to add a new fascia <b>flap,</b> the interpectoral fascia <b>flap.</b> We dissected the interpectoral fascia <b>flap</b> from 20 cadavers. In each of the 40 hemichests, {{the trunk of the}} thoracoacromial vessels was selectively injected with red polyurethane and the tissue containing the pectoral branches was separated from the overlying pectoralis major muscle and converted into an independent fascia <b>flap.</b> The maximum <b>flap</b> length was 13. 5 cm and the maximum breadth was 10. 3 cm. The length of the vascular pedicle before entering the <b>flap</b> was 3. 9 cm ± 1. 4 cm with a range of 1. 5 - 6. 8 cm. Concerning the arc of rotation, all 40 <b>flaps</b> reached the posterior axillary fold, and 29 <b>flaps</b> (73 %) reached the mandibular border. This new fascia <b>flap</b> has applications as pedicled and as free <b>flap.</b> The pedicled <b>flap</b> is used in the neck region, in the axillary region and as gliding tissue between the nipple-areola complex and the pectoralis major muscle. The usage of the fascia <b>flap</b> as a free <b>flap</b> has similar characteristics as the other fascia <b>flaps...</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{technique}} of flight among procellariids depends on foraging methods. Compared {{to an average}} bird, all procellariids have a high aspect ratio (meaning their wings are long and narrow) and a heavy wing loading. Therefore, they must maintain a high speed {{in order to remain}} in the air. Most procellariids use two techniques to do this, namely, dynamic soaring and slope soaring. Dynamic soaring involves gliding across wave fronts, thus taking advantage of the vertical wind gradient and minimising the effort required to stay in the air. Slope soaring is more straightforward: the procellariid turns to the wind, gaining height, from where it can then glide back down to the sea. Most procellariids aid their flight by means of flap-glides, where bursts of <b>flapping</b> are followed by a period of gliding; the amount of <b>flapping</b> dependent on the strength of the wind and the choppiness of the water. Shearwaters and other larger petrels, which have lower aspect ratio, must make more use of <b>flapping</b> to remain airborne than gadfly petrels. Because of the high speeds required for flight, procellariids need to either run or face into a strong wind in order to take off.|$|E
5|$|This {{efficient}} long-distance travelling {{underlies the}} albatross's {{success as a}} long-distance forager, covering great distances and expending little energy looking for patchily distributed food sources. Their adaptation to gliding flight makes them dependent on wind and waves, however, as their long wings are ill-suited to powered flight and most species lack the muscles and energy to undertake sustained <b>flapping</b> flight. Albatrosses in calm seas are forced {{to rest on the}} ocean's surface until the wind picks up again. The North Pacific albatrosses can use a flight style known as flap-gliding, where the bird progresses by bursts of <b>flapping</b> followed by gliding. When taking off, albatrosses need to take a run up to allow enough air to move under the wing to provide lift.|$|E
5|$|Another dromaeosaurid species, Deinonychus antirrhopus, may display partial flight capacities. The {{young of}} this species bore longer arms and more robust {{pectoral}} girdles than adults, and which {{were similar to those}} seen in other <b>flapping</b> theropods, implying that they may have been capable of flight when young and then lost the ability as they grew.|$|E
40|$|Recently, {{combined}} tissues or <b>flaps</b> {{have been}} used for the repair of extensively massive or wide defects resulting from radical wide resection. To further advance the development of combined tissue transfers, they should be reclassified. Based on our cases with free tissue transfers, we have created a new classification of combined <b>flaps</b> composed of "bridge", "chimeric", "siamese", "mosaic", and "chain-circle" <b>flaps.</b> The bridge <b>flap</b> is fabricated out together of separate <b>flaps</b> with short vascular pedicles. These form a compound <b>flap</b> supplied with a solitary vascular source. The chimeric <b>flap</b> is compounded from multiple different <b>flaps</b> but consists of only a single different tissue form. Each of the <b>flaps</b> is usually supplied by different branches from the same source vessel. It differs from the bridge <b>flap</b> in that the pedicle of each <b>flap</b> or tissue has some length for its movement for transfer. The siamese connected <b>flap</b> has 2 adjacent <b>flaps</b> that are simultaneously elevated, and a disparate vascular pedicle for each <b>flap</b> must be reestablished. This connected <b>flap</b> has double isolated pedicles. Themosaic connected <b>flap</b> consists of 2 adjacent <b>flaps</b> that are simultaneously elevated, and the pedicle of the distal <b>flap</b> is anastomosed to the pedicle branch of the proximal <b>flap</b> in the "bridge" fashion. The vascular pedicle of the proximal <b>flap</b> is anastomosed to a single vascular source. The chain-circle <b>flap</b> has 2 or more <b>flaps</b> like the bridge and chimeric <b>flaps,</b> and the distal end of the vascular source is anastomosed to the branch of the recipient vessel. Based on results with our patients, the lateral circumflex femoral system seems to be the most suitable candidate for the axial pedicle of these combined <b>flaps,</b> because the system has several branches of large and small caliber, and several tissue components, such as the vascularized ilium, rectus femoris muscle, gracilis muscle, lateral femoral cutaneous nerve, and fascia lata, are located nearby...|$|R
40|$|Pedicled instep <b>flaps</b> are {{frequently}} used in weight-bearing plantar reconstruction, {{but may not}} be available after severe foot injuries. Although free instep <b>flaps</b> offer a viable option, they have scarcely been reported. A posttraumatic plantar forefoot defect was reconstructed with a sensate, instep free <b>flap,</b> because local <b>flaps</b> were not available and defect size did not require a distant free <b>flap,</b> and the current literature was reviewed for therapeutic options. The instep free <b>flap</b> yielded an excellent functional and aesthetic long-term result. In the literature, pedicled instep <b>flaps</b> are advocated for moderate size defects of the weight-bearing heel and sole, while free <b>flaps</b> from distant sites are preferred for large defects. Although skin-grafted muscle <b>flaps</b> and fasciocutaneous <b>flaps</b> yield similar results, reconstruction by like tissues appears favorable. We suggest the instep free <b>flap</b> for weight-bearing plantar foot reconstruction, when pedicled instep <b>flaps</b> are not available and distant free <b>flaps</b> are avoidabl...|$|R

With both types of <b>flap</b> the decrease in the angle of attack, for maximum section lift coefficient, with <b>flap</b> deflection is large for the NACA 27 - 212 airfoil as compared with the NACA 23012 airfoil.

40|$|Abstract Background and objectives: Perforator <b>flaps,</b> both pedicled {{and free}} <b>flaps,</b> are {{increasingly}} used in reconstructive surgery. However, the microvascular perfusion pattern within these <b>flaps</b> still remains essentially unknown. It {{is well known}} that in random-pattern <b>flaps,</b> <b>flap</b> length correlates directly with the width of the <b>flap</b> base. In perforator <b>flaps,</b> the importance of preserving a skin base is still an object of debate. We hypothesized that by dividing the skin base peripheral tissue perfusion in islanded perforator <b>flaps</b> increases. The abdominal panniculus in patients submitted to elective abdominoplasty was used to test and compare perforator <b>flaps</b> (intact skin bridge at the <b>flap</b> base in addition to a single perforator) and islanded perforator <b>flaps</b> (a single perforator located {{at the base of the}} <b>flap</b> only). Methods: <b>Flap</b> perfusion was measured using dynamic laser induced fluorescence videoangiography (IC-VIEW, PULSION medical systems AG, Munich, Germany). The abdominoplasty <b>flap</b> was used to create the intended <b>flaps</b> and the fluorescent dye indocyanine green (ICG) was injected intravenously. Special software (IC-CALC) was used for quantitative analysis. The fluorescence intensity was compared after 2 minutes of registration. The results are presented as mean ± SEM, and considered statistical significant when P < 0. 05. Results: An increase in mean pixel intensity represents an increase in tissue perfusion. After surgical release of the skin base in the perforator <b>flaps,</b> the ICG fluorescence increased in zone I (the most distal zone) in the islanded perforator <b>flaps</b> (n= 24, P< 0. 05 both compared to control and the <b>flaps</b> with skin base intact) Conclusions: Conversion of a perforator <b>flap</b> with skin base intact into an islanded perforator <b>flap</b> by dividing the skin base increases distal tissue perfusion. This finding could potentially enhance <b>flap</b> mobility and length- two major concerns in <b>flap</b> design...|$|R

30|$|The {{design of}} local pedicled perforator-based <b>flaps</b> can be broadly {{described}} by the movement that the <b>flap</b> makes.

40|$|Free tissue {{transfer}} has {{revolutionized the}} management of complex head and neck defects. Perforator <b>flaps</b> represent the most recent advance {{in the development of}} free <b>flap</b> surgery. These <b>flaps</b> are based on perforating vessels and can be harvested without significant damage to associated muscles, thereby reducing the postoperative morbidity associated with muscle-based <b>flaps.</b> Elevation of perforator <b>flaps</b> requires meticulous technique and can be more challenging than raising muscle-based <b>flaps.</b> Use of a Doppler device enables reliable identification of the perforating vessels and aids in the design of free-style free <b>flaps,</b> where the <b>flaps</b> are designed purely according to the perforator located. The major advantage of free-style free <b>flaps</b> is that an unlimited number of <b>flaps</b> can potentially be designed on much shorter pedicles. The anterolateral thigh <b>flap</b> is the most commonly used perforator <b>flap</b> in head and neck reconstruction.

40|$|Variable camber {{actuator}} assemblies {{broaden the}} range of speeds at which lift to drag performance is maximized for slotted <b>flap</b> wings.
