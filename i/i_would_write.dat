25|$|Sitting {{after dinner}} at Ilam {{about a month}} ago, I said I saw no hope for a better state of public policy here unless {{there was a new}} {{newspaper}} started which would tell the truth without fear or favour. In five minutes the thing was settled. If I would undertake the management of it, it was to be started and five hundred pound was put down on the spot; it was soon found there was a little press and some types to be bought. I promised <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>write</b> and would exercise a general superintendence over the matter... The first number appeared three weeks after the conversation referred to.|$|E
25|$|I thought <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>write</b> Memories and the City in six months, {{but it took}} me {{one year}} to complete. And I was working twelve hours a day, just reading and working. My life, because of so many things, was in a crisis; I don’t {{want to go into}} those details: divorce, father dying, {{professional}} problems, problems with this, problems with that, everything was bad. I thought if I were to be weak I would have a depression. But every day I would wake up and have a cold shower and sit down and remember and write, always paying attention to the beauty of the book. Honestly, I may have hurt my mother, my family. My father was dead, but my mother is still alive. But I can’t care about that; I must care about the beauty of the book.|$|E
500|$|Some {{songs were}} from McCartney's childhood, {{in which his}} father, Jim, would often be playing on the family piano. Most of the songs were played based on the sheet music, as LiPuma said that [...] "We'd have {{somebody}} write out a chord sheet for us, {{and then we went}} in and figured it out on the date". LiPuma also said McCartney wasn't unfamiliar with the group's way of recording, saying that McCartney said [...] "I love this. It reminds me of the way we used to do the Beatles. John [...] and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>write</b> a song, we'd have a date booked at Abbey Road, and neither George Martin, George Harrison or Ringo [...] knew what the songs were about. They'd work it out right there in the room".|$|E

500|$|Barlow's manager, Simon Fuller, chose Stephen Lipson {{to produce}} the song, seeing his success with 1980s artists like Grace Jones and Frankie Goes to Hollywood. Although the song did not sound like what Barlow would usually record, he {{nevertheless}} explained in an interview: [...] "It {{took me a while}} to get my interpretation right because Madonna had written from a female point of view. It's not the kind of song <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>write</b> myself. But as soon as I heard it, I thought 'This is a hit'." [...] A dance-pop song, [...] "Love Won't Wait" [...] is set in the time signature of common time with a tempo of 120 beats per minute. Barlow's voice spans between the nodes of Cm and A3 and has a basic chord progression of C–A–B–Cm in the pre-chorus and E–B–D–A–C–E–A–Cm in the chorus.|$|E
500|$|In 1881, Janáček {{founded and}} was {{appointed}} {{director of the}} organ school, and held this post until 1919, when the school became the Brno Conservatory. In the mid-1880s Janáček began composing more systematically. Among other works, he created the Four male-voice choruses (1886), dedicated to Antonín Dvořák, and his first opera, Šárka (1887–88). During this period he began to collect and study folk music, songs and dances. In {{the early months of}} 1887 he sharply criticized the comic opera The Bridegrooms, by Czech composer Karel Kovařovic, in a Hudební listy journal review: [...] "Which melody stuck in your mind? Which motif? Is this dramatic opera? No, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>write</b> on the poster: 'Comedy performed together with music', since the music and the libretto aren't connected to each other". Janáček's review apparently led to mutual dislike and later professional difficulties when Kovařovic, as director of the National Theatre in Prague, refused to stage Janáček's opera Jenůfa.|$|E
500|$|Cornell {{stated that}} the biggest two {{influences}} on [...] "You Know My Name" [...] were Tom Jones, who performed the theme for Thunderball, and Paul McCartney, who composed and performed the theme for Live and Let Die. [...] "I decided that I was going to sing it like Tom Jones, in that crooning style. I wanted people to hear my voice," [...] Cornell said. [...] "And 'Live and Let Die' is a fantastic song. Paul McCartney wouldn't have written it if not for that movie. I [...] {{wanted to write a}} song in its own universe. I knew I'd never have it again — a big orchestra — so I wanted to have fun with it." [...] Cornell did not put the film's title in the lyrics, because he [...] "couldn't imagine it fitting into a song lyric that would come out of my mouth". And he jokingly stated [...] "Casino Royale didn't make a good rock title, but <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>write</b> a song named Octopussy just for fun".|$|E

500|$|Cisneros {{was awarded}} a {{bachelor}} of arts degree from Loyola University Chicago in 1976, and received a master of fine arts degree from the Iowa Writers' Workshop at the University of Iowa in 1978. [...] It was while attending the Workshop that Cisneros discovered how the particular social position she occupied gave her writing a unique potential. She recalls being suddenly struck by the differences {{between her and her}} classmates: [...] "It wasn't as if I didn't know who I was. I knew I was a Mexican woman. But I didn't think it {{had anything to do with}} why I felt so much imbalance in my life, whereas it had everything to do with it! My race, my gender, and my class! And it didn't make sense until that moment, sitting in that seminar. That's when I decided <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>write</b> about something my classmates couldn't write about." [...] She cast aside her attempt to conform to American literary canons and adopted a writing style that was purposely opposite that of her classmates, realizing that instead of being something to be ashamed of, her own cultural environment was a source of inspiration. From then on, she would write of her [...] "neighbors, the people [...] saw, the poverty that the women had gone through." ...|$|E
2500|$|Fator {{announced}} in July 2008 {{that he was}} at work on a book. [...] "I never thought in my whole life <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>write</b> a whole book. It's called 'Who's the Dummy Now?'" [...] Fator announced at the 2008 Bloomsburg Fair on the week of September 20–27, 2008 that he finished his book.|$|E
2500|$|In 2003 {{he commented}} that his {{particular}} brand of political satire {{is more difficult}} in the modern world: [...] "The real issues I don't think most people touch. The Clinton jokes are all about Monica Lewinsky {{and all that stuff}} and not about the important things, like the fact that he wouldn't ban land mines... I'm not tempted to write a song about George W. Bush. I couldn't figure out what sort of song <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>write.</b> That's the problem: I don't want to satirise George Bush and his puppeteers, I want to vaporize them." ...|$|E

I wrote the letters and stuff and I kind of just started writing there on my down time. At lunch when I {{had nothing to do}} <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>write</b> about stuff.

2500|$|The Goons made a {{considerable}} {{impact on the}} humour of The Beatles, and especially on John Lennon. On 30 September 1973, Lennon reviewed the book The Goon Show Scripts for The New York Times. He wrote: [...] "I was 12 when The Goon Show first hit me, 16 when they finished with me. Their humour was the only proof {{that the world was}} insane. One of my earlier efforts at writing was a 'newspaper' called The Daily Howl. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>write</b> it at night, then take it into school and read it aloud to my friends. Looking at it now, it seems strangely similar to The Goon Show." [...] Lennon also noted that George Martin, the Beatles' long-time producer, had previously made records with both Spike Milligan and Peter Sellers.|$|E
2500|$|Of {{his early}} days, Capote related, [...] "I began writing {{really sort of}} seriously when I was about eleven. I say seriously {{in the sense that}} like other kids go home and {{practice}} the violin or the piano or whatever, I used to go home from school every day, and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>write</b> for about three hours. I was obsessed by it." [...] In 1935, he attended the Trinity School in New York City. He then attended St. Joseph Military Academy. In 1939, the Capote family moved to Greenwich, Connecticut, and Truman attended Greenwich High School, where he wrote for both the school's literary journal, The Green Witch, and the school newspaper. When they returned to New York City in 1942, he attended the Franklin School, an Upper West Side private school now known as the Dwight School, and graduated in 1943. That was the end of his formal education.|$|E

2500|$|In January 2016, Marvel {{announced}} that writer Kelly Thompson, who co-wrote A-Force vol. 2, #2, {{will take over}} the series with artist Ben Caldwell starting with issue 5. Thompson stated that while she respects the way Wilson built the team, {{in a world where}} women are the primary heroes, she does not intend on making stories that are [...] "unique to women". Thompson explained, [...] "It's a comic about super heroes saving the day, plain and simple, and I approach <b>writing</b> them like <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>writing</b> anyone. These ladies are heroes just like any of their male colleagues." ...|$|R
2500|$|Her {{literary}} efforts originated {{after the}} experience, according to her, of a life-defining moment on 29 December 2000. She, her son Benjamin, daughter Jemima {{and her two}} sons, plus her niece Lady Cosima Somerset and her two children were travelling to Kenya, when a passenger on their British Airways plane stormed into the cockpit and tried to seize the controls. The autopilot on the flight to Nairobi became temporarily disengaged and the jumbo was knocked off course, abruptly diving and plunging [...] below. [...] "Nobody on that plane thought, 'am I going to die?'" [...] she later recalled. [...] "They all thought, 'we are going to die'. It was horrible, horrible." [...] This near-death incident has been credited by Lady Annabel as the catalyst for her writings. [...] "I had always thought that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>write</b> a book", she claimed, [...] "but writing my memoirs didn't really come into my head until after that flight." [...] In the introduction to Annabel, she wrote: ...|$|E
2500|$|During the Fragile Tour, Wakeman bought {{four books}} {{at an airport}} bookstall in Richmond, Virginia, {{including}} one about Henry VIII and his six wives titled The Private Life of Henry VIII (1964) by Scottish writer Nancy Brysson Morrison. As he read about Anne Boleyn on the subsequent flight to Chicago, a theme he recorded in November 1971 ran through his mind which he wrote on some hand drawn ledger lines and played during the sound check and the subsequent concert. Said Wakeman, [...] "I had been searching for a style to write in and suddenly I found it in writing music about these six ladies...I would concentrate {{on one of the}} wives and then music just came into my head and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>write</b> it down. Sometimes I was flying, other times I was on stage, or {{just in front of the}} piano at home ... The six wives theme gave me the thread, the link, I needed to give me a reason for putting these pieces of music together." [...] He explains the album's concept further in its liner notes: [...] "The album is based around my interpretations of the musical characteristics of the wives of Henry VIII. Although the style may not always be in keeping with their individual history, it is my personal conception of their characters in relation to keyboard instruments." [...] Wakeman elaborated and wrote the music as if he was doing a surreal painting, [...] "sketches of how I felt about them at the time".|$|E
2500|$|In 1884, {{following}} his final term at Carlisle, Standing Bear, {{armed with a}} recommendation by Captain Pratt, returned home to the Rosebud Agency, Rosebud, South Dakota, where he was hired as an assistant at the reservation's school at the salary of three hundred dollars a year. In 1890, some time after Wounded Knee, Luther moved from Rosebud and followed his father and brother Ellis Standing Bear to Pine Ridge, South Dakota. [...] Pine Ridge provided a series of varying employment and family ventures. In 1891, Luther became principal of a reservation day school. Standing Bear also worked in his uncle’s little general store. [...] One day {{they were talking about}} the delay in mail delivery. [...] “I told my uncle that John Wanamaker, the man for whom I had worked in Philadelphia, was Postmaster-General, and that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>write</b> and see if we could not have a post office established at his camp. [...] I suggested that we call it Kyle. [...] It was a short name and easy to spell. [...] When Mr. Wanamaker received my letter, he replied immediately. [...] He was pleased with my suggestion, but said that he could not appoint me postmaster, as I was an Indian. [...] It would have to be some white man. [...] There was a Joseph Taylor who was one of our missionaries, and we sent his name. [...] He received the appointment, but I took care of the office.” [...] Later, Luther opened a dry goods store with his brother Ellis at Pass Creek and started a small ranch raising horses and cattle. Standing Bear organized public meetings at his dry goods store in Pine Ridge to discuss treaties and current events.|$|E
5000|$|Crabtree died on June 28, 1996. Waldrop noted [...] "It's a show...inspired by costumes--and, just by extension, the {{exuberance}} of Howard's {{spirit and}} {{his desire to}} just put it out there.... Without Howard, it's inconceivable that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have <b>written</b> a gay revue." ...|$|R
