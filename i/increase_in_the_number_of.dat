40|$|Clinical and roentgenological {{studies of}} lymph follicles of the {{terminal}} ileum were carried out <b>in</b> children. <b>The</b> results are summarized as follows : 1. Observations made in 52 normal, healthy children have revealed that lymph follicles are well developed in 5 to 8 years, that they begin to decrease in number and size in about 11 years, {{and that they are}} nearly completely degenerated in puberty. 2. Of 20 children with enlarged tonsils, 11 had larger numbers of lymph follicles of the ileum than normal. Roentgenograms revealed a marked <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> and size of lymph follicles <b>in</b> <b>the</b> terminal ileum of children whose tonsils were shown to contain markedly large numbers of lymph follicles on histologic examination. 3. Examinations of 8 children with dysentery showed a marked <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> and size of lymph follicles {{of the terminal}} ileum. 4. Of 10 children with acute nephritis concurrent with tonsillitis or impetigo, 5 showed an <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> and size of lymph follicles on roentgenographic examination. 5. Of children showing organic changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> gastrointestinal tract, those with cecum mobile, ascariasis, tuberculosis of the intestines or dolichocolon mobile were shown to be associated with an <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> and size of lymph follicles of the terminal ileum. 6. Of 80 children with recurrent colic pains <b>in</b> <b>the</b> umbilicus, 14 were attended with a marked <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> and size of lymph follicles of the terminal ileum, tenderness and hardening of the loop of the terminal ileum and disturbed peristalsis. It was shown that colic pains <b>in</b> <b>the</b> umbilicus were attributable to this condition. 7. There were 12 children who, having been operated on for possible acute or chronic appendicitis, proved on roentgenographic examination to be the cases of an <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> and size of lymph follicles of the terminal ileum. 8. Conservative treatment consisting in rest, regulation of the diet, application of poultice to the ileocecal region and administration of sulfamine and some adequate remedy for intestinal disturbances had effect on the condition resulting from an <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> and size of lymph follicles <b>in</b> <b>the</b> terminal ileum...|$|R

The first incarnation of the Antiquary ceased publication in 1933 with volume 62, number 783 (Dec. 1933), two years after Richard Temple's death in 1931. Several early volumes of the journal were reprinted by Swati Publications in Delhi, 1984.|$|E
