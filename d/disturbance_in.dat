5|$|A <b>disturbance</b> <b>in</b> the South Indian {{convergence}} zone near Seychelles persisted on October24 with {{an area of}} convection. It gradually organized while passing near Agaléga. On October27, it developed into a tropical depression, and after Dvorak classifications of 2.5, the system was named Arilisy. It became disorganized on October29, never having intensified beyond winds of 50km/h (30mph). After moving to the southwest for much of its duration, Arilisy dissipated on October30.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the five official tropical cyclones, a <b>disturbance</b> <b>in</b> the middle of September that tracked from east of the Lesser Antilles to {{off the coast of}} Canada was studied for potential classification. Despite producing gale-force winds, the system was likely extratropical in nature, and any time it may have spent as a tropical storm was brief.|$|E

The sign of these <b>disturbances</b> is <b>in</b> agreement with the GSM TIP calculations; however, the calculated positive and negative <b>disturbances</b> <b>in</b> foF 2 are much weaker than in the observations. IRI- 2000 is well reproducing the negative foF 2 disturbances above Millstone Hill (see Fig. 3) but not the positive disturbances.|$|R

Among other stories compared to Spirited Away, The Wonderful Wizard of Oz is seen to be more closely linked thematically.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Depression Sixteen-E {{formed from}} a <b>disturbance</b> <b>in</b> the {{intertropical}} convergence zone. Despite being {{located in a}} hostile environment, it managed to organize into a tropical depression on November 14. It was briefly forecast to strengthen into a tropical storm. However, wind shear prevented that from occurring. Consequently, the depression degenerated into a remnant low on November 16 and dissipated soon after that.|$|E
5|$|A <b>disturbance</b> <b>in</b> the Indian Ocean {{intertropical}} {{convergence zone}} became evident southeast of the Chagos Archipelago on March16 after two cyclones {{moved away from the}} region. Based on analysis from MF, the system slowly organized while moving westward, its movement influenced by a subtropical ridge to the south. On March17, the JTWC also began tracking the system. Due to cool, dry air, the system initially did not intensify, although its passage over warmer sea surface temperatures on March19 allowed for strengthening. On March19, MF classified the disturbance as Tropical Storm Nadia after rainbands developed. A day later, the JTWC designated Nadia as Tropical Cyclone 23S.|$|E

5|$|Based on {{analysis}} from Météo-France (MFR), a <b>disturbance</b> <b>in</b> the Indian Ocean {{intertropical convergence zone}} became evident south of the Chagos Archipelago on February6, after Cyclone Geralda struck Madagascar and {{moved away from the}} region. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) assessed it as developing a day prior in the same general area. Later on February6, a circulation developed concurrently with an area of organized convection. On February8, the system intensified into Tropical Storm Hollanda as it moved southwestward, its motion influenced by a ridge to its south. A trough turned the storm to the south-southwest, and Hollanda intensified into a tropical cyclone– the equivalence of a hurricane– on February9.|$|E

The station owner, Harold Power, hired him to run the company's laboratory, at a salary greater than that which Bush drew from Tufts. In 1917, following the United States' entry into World War I, {{he went to work}} with the National Research Council. He attempted to develop a means of detecting submarines by measuring the <b>disturbance</b> <b>in</b> the Earth's magnetic field. His device worked as designed, but only from a wooden ship; attempts to get it to work on a metal ship such as a destroyer failed.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Greta {{originated}} out of {{a tropical}} <b>disturbance</b> <b>in</b> the Intertropical Convergence Zone near Jamaica on October30, 1956. A Navy reconnaissance plane recorded sustained winds of 35mph (55km/h) and found an area of low pressure. Around this time, the system was classified as a tropical depression. Although a ship near the system discovered a cold-core circulation—a feature of non-tropical cyclones—it was classified as tropical. By October31, the depression passed near {{the western edge of}} Haiti and later crossed the eastern tip of Cuba before entering the Atlantic Ocean. By the afternoon of November1, the depression had moved through the central Bahamas and turned towards the northeast.|$|E

5|$|On February10, MFR began {{tracking}} {{a tropical}} <b>disturbance</b> <b>in</b> the Mozambique channel near Juan de Nova Island. The system tracked generally south-southwestward, gradually intensifying. Given the name Imboa, the storm reached peak winds of 95km/h (60mph) on February13 while passing near Europa Island. After executing a small loop, Imboa {{turned toward the}} southeastern African coastline and approached the eastern coasts of Mozambique and South Africa as a weakened system. A ridge caused the storm {{to turn to the}} east and northeast, dissipating on February19.|$|E
5|$|On November 29 a <b>disturbance</b> <b>in</b> the ITCZ began gaining {{organization}} near Palmyra Island, {{which the}} ITCZ had been near {{for a week}} prior. The weather station on the island reported southwestern surface winds of 50mph and a pressure of 1002.7mbar and that during the night, the wind velocity peaked at 70mph. Because of an irregular schedule for reporting, the last report received from the weather station, obtained eighteen hours earlier, had reported only small winds and 1004.7mb pressure. Most noteworthy about this report was the 3-hour pressure tendency, which reported -3.2mbar. Post-analysis revealed that this tendency was an indication of tropical cyclone development.|$|E
5|$|On October9, {{the fifth}} {{tropical}} {{depression of the}} 1910season formed from a tropical <b>disturbance</b> <b>in</b> the extreme southern Caribbean, {{to the north of}} Panama. It tracked steadily northwestward, and attained tropical storm intensity on October 11. It continued to strengthen, and became a hurricane the next day. On October13, the storm was observed to the southwest of Cuba. Early on October 14, the hurricane briefly reached an intensity corresponding to Category 3 status on the modern-day Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale before tracking ashore along the western tip of Cuba. However, it weakened somewhat after crossing the island. Upon emerging into the Gulf of Mexico, the hurricane slowed considerably.|$|E
40|$|This study {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the ground-based observations and model simulations of ionospheric electron density disturbances at three longitudinal sectors (eastern European, Siberian and American) during geomagnetic storms that occurred on 26 – 30  September  2011. We use the Global Self-consistent Model of the Thermosphere, Ionosphere and Protonosphere (GSM TIP) to reveal the main mechanisms influencing the storm-time behavior of the total electron content (TEC) and the ionospheric F 2 peak critical frequency (fo F 2) during different phases of geomagnetic storms. During the storm's main phase the long-lasting positive <b>disturbances</b> <b>in</b> TEC and fo F 2 at sunlit mid-latitudes are mainly explained by the storm-time equatorward neutral wind. The effects of eastward electric field can only explain the positive ionospheric storm in the first few hours of the initial storm phase. During the main phase the ionosphere was more changeable than the plasmasphere. The positive <b>disturbances</b> <b>in</b> the electron content at the plasmaspheric heights (800 – 20   000  km) at high latitudes can appear simultaneously with the negative <b>disturbances</b> <b>in</b> TEC and fo F 2. The daytime positive <b>disturbances</b> <b>in</b> fo F 2 and TEC occurred at middle and low latitudes and at the Equator due to n (O)  ∕  n (N 2) enhancement during later stage of the main phase and during the recovery phase of the geomagnetic storm. The plasma tube diffusional depletion and negative <b>disturbances</b> <b>in</b> electron and neutral temperature were the main formation mechanisms of the simultaneous formation of the positive <b>disturbances</b> <b>in</b> fo F 2 and negative <b>disturbances</b> <b>in</b> TEC at low latitudes during the storm's recovery phase...|$|R

5|$|Super Typhoon Angela, {{known in}} the Philippines as Typhoon Rubing, was an intense {{tropical}} cyclone that formed in late September 1989.

The termite assemblages were considerably different among sites, with a conspicuous reduction in both diversity and abundance with increased disturbance, related to the reduction of tree density and soil cover, and with the intensity of trampling by cattle and goats. The wood-feeders were the most severely affected feeding group.|$|E
