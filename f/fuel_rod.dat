5|$|Neutron {{penetration}} into materials makes californium {{useful in}} detection instruments such as <b>fuel</b> <b>rod</b> scanners; neutron radiography of aircraft and weapons components to detect corrosion, bad welds, cracks and trapped moisture; and in portable metal detectors. Neutron moisture gauges use californium-252 to find water and petroleum layers in oil wells, as a portable neutron source for {{gold and silver}} prospecting for on-the-spot analysis, and to detect ground water movement. The major uses of californium-252 in 1982 were, in order of use, reactor start-up (48.3%), <b>fuel</b> <b>rod</b> scanning (25.3%), and activation analysis (19.4%). By 1994 most californium-252 was used in neutron radiography (77.4%), with <b>fuel</b> <b>rod</b> scanning (12.1%) and reactor start-up (6.9%) as important but distant secondary uses.|$|E
5|$|MOX fuel {{improves}} total burnup. A <b>fuel</b> <b>rod</b> is reprocessed {{after three}} years of use to remove waste products, which by then account for 3% of the total weight of the rods. Any uranium or plutonium isotopes produced during those three years are left and the rod goes back into production. The presence of up to 1% gallium per mass in weapons-grade plutonium alloy has the potential to interfere with long-term operation of a light water reactor.|$|E
5|$|Many of Bond's adversaries {{meet their}} deaths {{at the hands}} of Bond who often uses his {{environment}} or equipment to kill his opponent. Mr. Big was killed when Bond force-fed him a pellet of compressed gas, causing him to inflate and explode whilst Hugo Drax was ejected into outer space. Very few villains actually survive the course of Bond's assignment, and their deaths often come in the final scenes of the film. Lindner has noted that a number of the villains or henchmen have met their deaths through Bond using the technology of the villains against themselves and these include Alec Trevelyan being speared by part of the communications dish, Elliot Carver impaled by his sea-drill and Renard skewered by a nuclear <b>fuel</b> <b>rod.</b>|$|E

40|$|AmerGen Energy Company, LLC (AmerGen) {{plans to}} {{irradiate}} four M 5 clad <b>fuel</b> <b>rods</b> to end-of life rod average burnups ranging from about 63 to 69 GWd/mtU. Irradiation of these <b>fuel</b> <b>rods</b> will provide data on fuel and material performance that will support industry goals of extending the current fuel bumup limits, and will provide data to address Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) {{questions related to}} fuel performance behavior at high burnups. These <b>fuel</b> <b>rods</b> are currently in their third cycle of irradiation (TMI Unit 1 Operating Cycle 13), and will have cumulative rod average burnups ranging from approximately 42 to 48 GWd/mtU. The <b>fuel</b> <b>rods</b> will replace some of the original <b>fuel</b> <b>rods</b> in a twice-burned fuel assembly, which will then be irradiated for one additional cycle in TMI Unit 1. As detailed in Attachment 1, {{the use of these}} <b>fuel</b> <b>rods</b> will be fully evaluated as part of the TMI Unit 1 normal reload design process to ensure that all design criteria will be satisfied. Although the proposed irradiation of this limited number of <b>fuel</b> <b>rods</b> to high burnup does not require any Technical Specification changes, a specific safety evaluation will be performed for the condition consistent with the existing core reload program to ensure that no unreviewed safety question exists as defined by 10 CFR 50. 59.

25|$|The reactor is {{equipped}} with a <b>fuel</b> <b>rod</b> leak detector. A scintillation counter detector, sensitive to energies of short-lived fission products, is mounted on a special dolly and moved over the outlets of the fuel channels, issuing an alert if increased radioactivity is detected in the steam-water flow.|$|E
25|$|About 80–85% of {{the core}} thermal power is removed by the <b>fuel</b> <b>rod</b> coolant channels, via the {{graphite}} rings. The rest of the heat is removed by the control rod channel coolant. The gas circulating in the reactor {{plays the role of}} enabling the heat transfer to the coolant channels.|$|E
25|$|After almost 80minutes of slow {{temperature}} rise, {{the primary}} loop's four main reactor coolant pumps began to cavitate as a steam bubble/water mixture, rather than water, passed through them. The pumps were shut down, {{and it was}} believed that natural circulation would continue the water movement. Steam in the system prevented flow through the core, and as the water stopped circulating it was converted to steam in increasing amounts. About 130minutes after the first malfunction, the top of the reactor core was exposed and the intense heat caused a reaction to occur between the steam forming in the reactor core and the Zircaloy nuclear <b>fuel</b> <b>rod</b> cladding, yielding zirconium dioxide, hydrogen, and additional heat. This reaction melted the nuclear <b>fuel</b> <b>rod</b> cladding and damaged the fuel pellets, which released radioactive isotopes to the reactor coolant, and produced hydrogen gas that is believed to have caused a small explosion in the containment building later that afternoon.|$|E

25|$|At 16:12 JST, Self Defence Force (SDF) Chinook {{helicopters}} {{were preparing}} to pour water on Unit 3, where white fumes rising from the building {{was believed to be}} water boiling away from the <b>fuel</b> <b>rod</b> cooling pond {{on the top floor of}} the reactor building, and on Unit 4 where the cooling pool was also short of water. The mission was cancelled when helicopter measurements reported radiation levels of 50 mSv. At 21:06 pm JST, the government reported that major damage to Reactor 3 was unlikely but that it nonetheless remained their highest priority.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, the fission {{neutrons}} are thoroughly slowed down {{before they reach}} another <b>fuel</b> <b>rod,</b> meaning that it takes neutrons a longer time to get {{from one part of}} the reactor to the other. Thus if the chain reaction accelerates in one section of the reactor, the change will propagate itself only slowly {{to the rest of the}} core, giving time to respond in an emergency. The independence of the neutrons' energies from the nuclear fuel used is what allows for such fuel flexibility in a CANDU reactor, since every fuel bundle will experience the same environment and affect its neighbors in the same way, whether the fissile material is uranium-235, uranium-233 or plutonium.|$|E
25|$|At {{approximately}} 14:30 TEPCO announces its {{belief that}} the <b>fuel</b> <b>rod</b> storage pool of unit 4 – which is located outside the containment area — may have begun boiling, raising the possibility that exposed rods could reach criticality. By midday NHK TV is reporting white smoke rising from the Fukushima I plant, which officials suggest is likely coming from reactor 3. Shortly afterwards all but {{a small group of}} remaining workers at the plant are placed on standby because of the radiation rising to a dangerous level of up to 1Sv/h. TEPCO temporarily suspended operations at the facility. A TEPCO press release states that workers had been withdrawn at 06:00 JST because of abnormal noises coming from one of the reactor pressure suppression chambers. Late in the evening Reuters reports that water is being poured into reactors 5 and 6.|$|E

25|$|Pressurized water reactor (PWR) fuel {{consists}} of cylindrical rods put into bundles. A uranium oxide ceramic is formed into pellets and inserted into Zircaloy tubes that are bundled together. The Zircaloy tubes are about 1cm in diameter, and the fuel cladding gap {{is filled with}} helium gas to improve the conduction of heat from the fuel to the cladding. There are about 179-264 fuel rods per fuel bundle and about 121 to 193 fuel bundles are loaded into a reactor core. Generally, the fuel bundles consist of fuel rods bundled 14×14 to 17×17. PWR fuel bundles are about 4 meters long. In PWR fuel bundles, control rods are inserted through the top directly into the fuel bundle. The fuel bundles usually are enriched several percent in 235U. The uranium oxide is dried before inserting into the tubes to try to eliminate moisture in the ceramic fuel {{that can lead to}} corrosion and hydrogen embrittlement. The Zircaloy tubes are pressurized with helium to try to minimize pellet-cladding interaction which can lead to <b>fuel</b> <b>rod</b> failure over long periods.|$|E

The average outlet-temperature of cooling gas is constantly kept at 850 °C, the radial power distribution is varied independently and uniformly to permit a comparison for all cores.
