40|$|Given {{the level}} of its {{production}} in the U. S., a firm that produces more abroad tends to have fewer employees in the U. S. and to pay slightly <b>higher</b> <b>salaries</b> and <b>wages</b> to them. The most likely explanation {{seems to be that}} the larger a firm's foreign production, the greater its ability to allocate the more labor-intensive and less skill-intensive portions of its activity to locations outside the United States. This relationship is stronger among manufacturing firms than among service industry firms, probably because services are less tradable than manufactured goods or components, and service industries may therefore be less able to break up the production process to take advantage of differences in factor prices. ...|$|R

Key facts The National Accounts (Income and Expenditure) release provides {{information on}} domestic production and the resulting income that is available for spending and saving. It also provides an insight into how saving is used and invested between different sectors of the economy. Provisional estimates for the year ended March 2014 : 	New Zealand’s gross domestic product (GDP) was $ 231. 0 billion. 	Growth was reflected in higher operating profits for businesses, which drove up national income and saving. 	Higher global milk prices resulted in higher business profits, export earnings, and household income from farming. 	Revised estimates show positive household saving since 2010. 	Government saving increased, due to higher tax revenue, driven by <b>higher</b> <b>salaries</b> and <b>wages,</b> household consumption, and business profits.

40|$|Excerpt] Management {{of sales}} {{organization}} views sales force retention {{as a critical}} objective. The total {{costs associated with the}} quit decision of a single salesperson (recruiting, training and opportunity costs of lost sales from unmanned positions) is in the $ 50, 000 -$ 75, 000 range. Clearly, the adverse impact of salesforce turnover on both the profitability of the organization as well as the motivation level of the salesforce can be substantial. Therefore, it is urgent as well as crucial for sales organizations to develop retention strategies to incentivize sales representatives to stay with the company. The most crucial reason for voluntary turnover among salesforce is <b>higher</b> <b>wages.</b> <b>Salary</b> growth effects on turnover were greatest for high performers, that is, <b>high</b> <b>salary</b> growth significantly reduced turnover for high performing employees. However, besides salary, there are still a wide range of other strategies that companies can adopt to retain the salesforce...|$|R
40|$|It {{is widely}} feared that, once prices are decontrolled in the {{formerly}} centrally–planned economies, households’ release of previously accumulated money will trigger a hyperinflation. This paper finds, instead, that whether a country’s fiscal, monetary, and labor market policies are destabilizing typically {{does not depend}} on the money stock. However, the release of a monetary overhang can precipitate a large initial real wage shock. To the extent such a shock is not feasible politically, there is a motive for monetary reform, which must be weighed against the cost of reduced public confidence in money.

50|$|At 3:30 in {{the morning}} of June 14, 2006, the {{striking}} teachers of Section 22 of the Mexican National Educational Workers Union (SNTE) who had occupied the Zócalo (main square) of Oaxaca de Juárez (the capital city of the state of Oaxaca) were evicted by 3500 Oaxacan municipal police, some local firefighters and troops from the Policía Federal Preventiva (Federal Preventative Police) supported by helicopters in an attempt by the state government to dislodge the strikers. The teachers had been on strike for 23 days with demands for <b>higher</b> <b>wages,</b> <b>salary</b> rezonification in the state, and increased educational resources. At many points in the altercation tear gas and shots were fired by the police. After hours of conflict, the teachers were able to take {{the center of the city}} as their own and begin to construct a system of barricades that would make it impossible for the police to return via the roads. Reports vary as to the number of casualties the teachers sustained in the struggle. Amnesty International has since confirmed that there were over one hundred people hospitalized.|$|R

5000|$|For the {{argument}} that wages are not taxable, some tax protesters—including convicted tax offender Irwin Schiff—incorrectly attribute to the U.S. Supreme Court the following language {{in connection with the}} leading tax case of Lucas v.

Not only this, but it is directly opposed to provisions of the Act and to regulations of the U.S. Treasury Department, which either prescribed or permits that compensations for personal services not be taxed as an entirety and not be returned by the individual performing the services. It is to be noted that, by the language of the Act, it is not <b>salaries,</b> <b>wages,</b> or compensation for personal services that are to be included in gains, profits, and income derived from <b>salaries,</b> <b>wages,</b> or compensation for personal services.|$|R
