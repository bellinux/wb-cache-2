500|$|Taylor {{withstood}} {{a tremendous}} amount of punishment throughout the game. At one point in the first quarter, he bit his tongue while being tackled by Huff, causing him to swallow blood {{for the rest of the}} game. He also required six stitches at halftime to close a gash on his elbow. Some players wondered if he could even play in the second half. [...] "Taylor isn't human," [...] said Huff. [...] "No human being could have taken the punishment he got today." [...] Taylor described the contest in the locker room after the game, saying, [...] "I never took a worse beating on a football field. The Giants hit me hard, and then I hit the ground hard. I got it both ways. This was the toughest game I've ever played ... I just rammed it down their throats by letting my running do my talking. They couldn't rattle me ... I think Huff <b>hit</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> his elbow after a tackle. Anyway, I cut my tongue of all things." [...] Additionally, Taylor was playing while sick; two weeks later, he learned he had hepatitis, which contributed to his 15-pound weight loss prior to the game.|$|E
500|$|In {{the first}} {{appearance}} of the Nightmaster, a fat man {{who seems to be}} a closet homosexual gay basher repeatedly calls Jim Rook a [...] "cutie pie", compliments his hair, and grabs his girlfriend, saying (to Rook) [...] "And what? You gonna <b>hit</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> your purse?" [...] after which his friends start hitting Rook with a chair. The first obviously gay character featured by DC was Extraño, an effeminate Peruvian man whose name means [...] "strange" [...] in Spanish, created by Steve Englehart and Joe Staton, and appeared in Millennium and New Guardians in 1987. New Guardians was not successful, but during its short run it also featured one team member, Jet, contracting AIDS. The series was controversial, as several characters on the team were infected with HIV through the scratch of a character called the Hemo-Goblin. Many angry letters were printed in response to this misinformation about HIV transmission, along with some gay readers complaining that Extraño was too stereotypical. An official aftermath to Millennium, The Spectre (vol. 2) #11, depicted a [...] "mostly male and mostly gay" [...] AIDS rally. Several characters, including the Enchantress (describing them as [...] "filthy disgusting men") and a police helicopter pilot named Ed (screaming about [...] "fags") are influenced into attempting to crush the rally by a seven-headed spirit. Thanks to the actions of the Spectre, Doctor Fate, Deadman, Madame Xanadu (later herself revealed to be bisexual), and Ben Turner, the men are saved.|$|E

Their first two albums, <b>Hit</b> <b>Me</b> <b>with</b> the Surreal Feel (October 1988) and Just Because You Can't See It ... Doesn't Mean It Isn't There (February 1990), were {{described}} by McFarlane {{as having a}} [...] "dark, confrontational sound powered by Salmon's scratchy, neurotic guitar and snarling vocals". Also in 1990 Salmon issued his debut solo single, [...] "Lightning Scary", which appeared on the Surrealists third album, Essence, in September of the following year.|$|E
2500|$|During Frazier's amateur career, he won Golden Gloves Heavyweight Championships in 1962, 1963 and 1964. His only loss {{in three}} years as an amateur was to Buster Mathis. Mathis {{would prove to be}} Joe's biggest {{obstacle}} to making the 1964 U.S. Olympic Boxing team. They met in the final of the U.S. Olympic Trial at the New York World's Fair in the summer of 1964. Their fight was scheduled for three rounds and they fought with 10oz gloves and with headgear, even though the boxers who made it to Tokyo would wear no headgear and would wear 8oz gloves. Joe was eager to get back at Mathis for his only amateur loss and KO'd two opponents to get to the finals. But once again, when the dust settled, the judges had called it for Mathis, undeservedly Joe thought. [...] "All that fat boy had done was run like a thief- <b>hit</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> a peck and backpedal like crazy." [...] Joe would remark.|$|E

He also announced for the first time an album to be called The Nacirema Dream ("American" [...] spelled backwards) was in the planning. However, in September 2007, DJ Kay Slay revealed that he and Papoose had left Jive, commenting that they had [...] "almost [...] victims of A hell." [...] This was due to Jive wanting Papoose to be a more commercial artist. He would say, [...] "The business part and the politics of the game kinda got in the way. A lot of people were <b>hitting</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> ideas about doing this and that and got in the way. I can't really blame them, I blame myself for letting it happen." [...] In December 2009 DJ Kay Slay would confirm the album was still coming.|$|R

Chisora {{challenged}} Haye {{to tell him}} that to his face and approached Haye sparking a melee with Haye throwing the first punch with {{what appeared to be a}} glass bottle in his hand, as the brawl progressed Haye was seen swinging a camera tripod. After order was restored, a furious Chisora stated multiple times that he would [...] "shoot" [...] David Haye and claimed Haye [...] "glassed" [...] him. Haye's former manager Adam Booth emerged from the fracas with a facial wound and Chisora suggested to Booth that Haye hit him with a bottle by mistake while Booth insisted it was one of Chisora's entourage that had hit him with a bottle [...] During an interview at the Chisora vs. Haye press conference Booth was asked [...] "how did you end up with a cut on your head?" [...] to which he replied [...] "David <b>hit</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> a tripod" [...] but also added [...] "he bought me a new S-Class Mercedes as an apology".|$|E

His offense: stepping over a line, painted on the floor of his cell, while his lunch was being passed through the food slot of his door."Suddenly the riot police came," [...] he recounted. [...] "No one in the cellblock knew who for. They closed all the windows except mine. A female soldier came in with a big can of pepper spray. Eventually I figured out they were coming for me.

60|$|I {{first heard}} of her death from Minver at the club, and I heard with still greater astonishment that Alderling was down there alone where she had died. Minver said that {{somebody}} ought {{to go down and}} look after the poor old fellow, but nobody seemed to feel it exactly his office. Certainly I did not feel it mine, and I thought it rather a hardship when a few days after I found a letter from Alderling at the club quite piteously beseeching me to come to him. He had read of my arrival home, in a stray New York paper, and he was firing his letter, he said, at the club, with one chance in a thousand of <b>hitting</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> it. Rulledge was by when I read it, and he decided, with that unsparing activity of his, where other people are concerned, that I must go; I certainly could not resist such an appeal as that. He had a vague impression, he said, of something weird in the situation down there, and I ought to go and pull Alderling out of it; besides, I might find my account in it as a psychologist. I hesitated a day, out of self-respect, or self-assertion, and then, the weather coming on suddenly hot, in the beginning of September, I went.|$|R

He said, `Take of this whatever you wish so you may have enough (i.e. buy enough food) to fill your stomach, for you have burnt me.’ I said to him, `You have surely been kind to your kin! If this wealth is an inheritance which you have inherited, or a giver gave it to you personally, or you earned it from a trade deal, I would then be one of two: I may either take of it or simply thank you for your offer not accept it, or I may refrain so I may work hard (to earn my living). But if it is a wealth that belongs to Allah, and the Muslims are to partake of it, and so are the orphans and the wayfarers, then by Allah, you have no right to give me any of it, nor do I have any right to take any of it.’ He said, `I, by Allah, insist that you should do what you have refused to do.’ Then he kept <b>hitting</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> the rod.
