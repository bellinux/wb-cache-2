30|$|The Tauc <b>slope</b> <b>B</b> {{indicates}} {{the sharpness of}} the band edges and {{is related to the}} width of the band tails. This denotes the film disorder in terms of bond angle and bond length distribution [24, 25]. Usually, B is inversely proportional to the width of the tail states, which widen with an increase in disorder indicated by the Urbach energy (E u). The typical value of B is close to 700 (cm*eV)− 0.5 for pure a-Si:H [18]. The higher the B factor, the higher is the structural order of the film [25]. According to the relation between electronic density and the B factor, one can estimate the crystalline fraction from the observed value of the Tauc <b>slope</b> (<b>B).</b> As seen in Table  1, the <b>slope</b> (<b>B)</b> of the Tauc plot decreases with increase in hydrogen dilution for the films with thick nanocrystalline silicon layers. This indicates that with larger thickness and increased hydrogen dilution, the crystalline volume fraction increases. The films with lower nc-Si:H silicon layer thickness show increase in value of Tauc <b>slope</b> <b>B</b> with increased hydrogen dilution and hence reduction in crystalline volume fraction can be predicted.|$|R

While formation of <b>B</b> 2 <b>O</b> 3 (g) is well understood, {{many questions about}} the formation of <b>B</b> 2 <b>O</b> 2 (g) remain. Previous studies using B(s) + <b>B</b> 2 <b>O</b> 3 (l) have led to inconsistent thermodynamic data. In this study, {{it was found that}} after heating, B(s) and <b>B</b> 2 <b>O</b> 3 (l) appear to separate and variations in contact area likely led to the inconsistent vapor pressures of <b>B</b> 2 <b>O</b> 2 (g). To circumvent this problem, an activity of boron is fixed with a two-phase mixture of FeB and Fe 2 B. Both second and third law enthalpies of formation were measured for <b>B</b> 2 <b>O</b> 2 (g) and <b>B</b> 2 <b>O</b> 3 (g). From these the enthalpies of formation at 298. 15 K are calculated to be - 479. 9 +/- 41. 5 kJ/mol for <b>B</b> 2 <b>O</b> 2 (g) and - 833. 4 +/- 13. 1 kJ/mol for <b>B</b> 2 <b>O</b> 3 (g).

40|$|In {{the study}} of organic {{substances}} found in sewage or other geographical environments where pollution by bacteria and the waste matter often happens, one inrariably encounters a problem of {{the choice of the}} methods of test: Which is better, a method based on the measurement of biochemical oxygen demand (<b>B.</b> <b>O.</b> D.) or a method based on the estimation of chemical oxygen demand (C. O. D.) ? In an attempt to compare and correlate the results of experiments with <b>B.</b> <b>O.</b> D. and C. O. D., the author carried out tests on both <b>B.</b> <b>O.</b> D. and C. O. D. of the organic matter contained in the samples of sea water, river water, sewage and night soil. The results are summarized as follows : (1) Both <b>B.</b> <b>O.</b> D. and C. O. D. of the samples of river water obtained at low tide were higher than those of the samples obtained at high tide. At both low and high tides, the samples of the surface water of a river showed higher <b>B.</b> <b>O.</b> D. and C. O. D. values than those of the water obtained from its bottom. It appeared that a slight shower caused <b>B.</b> <b>O.</b> D. and C. O. D. of river water to fall, a medium rainfall caused them to rise and prolonged rain lasting several days caused them to fall. (2) Like samples of river water, those of sea water showed higher <b>B.</b> <b>O.</b> D. and C. O. D. values at low tide than at high tide. (3) Tests for comparison of <b>B.</b> <b>O.</b> D. and C. O. D. of the samples of sewage and those of the 1 : 2 dilution of identical samples, both kept to stand at a room temperature, showed that the decrease of <b>B.</b> <b>O.</b> D. and C. O. D. and the decrease of the ratio <b>B.</b> <b>O.</b> D. / C. O. D. were more marked in the latter than in the former. (4) It was shown that the degree of dilution of any samples of raw night soil and its supernatant paralleled the fall in the values of their <b>B.</b> <b>O.</b> D. and C. O. D. the rate of fall being a little smaller than the degree of dilution. (5) Tests in which samples of supernatant of night soil and their dilutions were kept standing at 30 ℃ and 37 ℃ in incubators showed that <b>B.</b> <b>O.</b> D. and C. O. D. of the samples kept at 37 ℃ fell earlier than those of the samples kept at 30 ℃. (6) It was shown that, from the standpoint of stochastics, there were significant differences between <b>B.</b> <b>O.</b> D. and C. O. D. in all the samples from river water, sea water, sewage and night soil. This indicates that there will be an agreement between the result of tests by chemical method of oxygen demand based on the use of KMnO_ 4 and the result of tests by biochemical method of determination of oxygen demand, if organic matters to be tested are of similar character...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is {{study the effects of}} a {{grassland}} fire in vegetation recuperation according to fire severity, slope exposition and position. We designed two experimental plots, one located in an east faced slope (Slope A) and other in a west faced (<b>Slope</b> <b>B).</b> Vegetation recuperation was assessed 10, 17, 31 and 46 days after the fire. The results showed that fire severity was higher in <b>slope</b> <b>B,</b> than in <b>slope</b> A. In both slopes vegetation recuperation was different according position. Bottom positions recovered faster than slope and upslope positions, that it is attributed to fire severity (higher in slope and upslope areas) and ash and soil transport and deposition in bottom areas. The vegetation recuperated faster in <b>slope</b> <b>B</b> and 46 days after the fire, 100 % of the plot was covered. This was attributed to higher severity, more complex topography, and inclination of Slope A, that delayed the vegetation recover...|$|R
