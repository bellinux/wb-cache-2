40|$|Patients with 41 {{implanted}} non-competitive pacemakers were investigated. A {{variety of}} domestic electrical equipment, a motor-car, and a physiotherapy <b>diathermy</b> <b>apparatus</b> were each operated in turn at various ranges from the patient. Interference effects on pacemaker function were assessed on the electrocardiograph. Medtronic demand 5841 pacemakers were stopped by diathermy while Cordis Ectocor pacemakers developed a fast discharge rate. Cordis triggered pacemakers (both Atricor and Ectocor) were sensitive to interference from many items of domestic {{equipment and the}} motor car. The Elema EM 153 ran at an increased rate when an electric razor was running close to the pacemaker. The Devices demand 2980 and the Medtronic demand 5841 were not affected by the domestic equipment tested. The significance of interference effects is discussed in relation to pacemaker design...|$|E
40|$|Background: This {{study was}} {{designed}} to investigate the incidence of technical equipment problems during lap-aroscopic procedures. Methods: A video-capturing system was used, consisting of an analog video recorder with three camera image inputs and a microphone. Problems with all technical equipment used by the surgical team, such as the insufflator, <b>diathermy</b> <b>apparatus,</b> monitors, light source, camera and camera unit, endoscope, suction devices, and instruments, were registered. Results: In total, 30 procedures were randomly video-taped. In 87 % (26 / 30) of the procedures, one or more incidents with technical equipment (49 incidents) or instruments (9 incidents) occurred. In 22 of those inci-dents (45 %) the technical equipment was not correctly positioned or not present at all; in the other 27 (55 %), the equipment malfunctioned {{as a result of a}} faulty connection (9), a defect (5), or the wrong setting of the equipment (3). In 10 (20 %) cases the exact cause of equipment malfunctioning was unclear. Conclusions: The incidence of problems with laparo-scopic technical equipment is high. To prevent such problems, improvement and standardization of equip-ment is needed, combined with the incorporation of checklist use before the start of a surgical procedure. Future research should be aimed at development, implementation, and evaluation of these measures into the operating room...|$|E
40|$|The {{feasibility}} of combining local heat treatment with wholebody hypothermia {{in an effort}} to improve therapeutic gain was assessed. Superficial, non perfused phantom tumors were fashioned in eight anesthetized mongrel dogs by transplantation of the spleen from the abdomen to a subcutaneous site on the hind limb. After pretreatment of the animal with the vasodilator hydralazine (0. 5 mg/kg, IV) to enhance normal tissue perfusion, the spleen implant was heated with a 2450 -MHz microwave <b>diathermy</b> <b>apparatus,</b> first with the animal 2 ̆ 7 s core body temperature in the normal range (39 °C) and then after the animal had been packed in ice to reduce core temperature to 30 °C. Applied power density and temperatures in both the phantom tumor and underlying muscle tissue were recorded during brief interruptions of diathermy until steady-state temperatures had been achieved. Under normothermic conditions with time-averaged applied power of 0. 038 W/ml to phantom tumor and 0. 014 W/ml to underlying muscle, tumor temperature rose to 45. 9 ± l. 8 °C, while muscle temperature remained at 40. 5 ± 0. 7 °C. During whole-body hypothermia applied power could be increased to 0. 114 W/ml in phantom tumor and to 0. 025 W/ml in muscle. Muscle temperature rose only to 33. 8 ± l. 6 °C, while that of the nonperfused phantom tumor rose to 53. 6 ± 4. 3 °C with systemic hypothermia. These results are in agreement with predictions based on the bioheat transfer equation, i. e., heat extraction from well-perfused normal tissues is greatly augmented by cooling of the arterial blood, allowing greater power input to the tumor-bearing region, higher tumor temperatures, and enhanced therapeutic gain during local heat treatments of poorly perfused tumor nodules...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} value of {{endoscopic}} polypectomy {{in the treatment of}} family adenomatous polyposis of the colon. Materials and methods. A total of 7 patients with diffuse adenomatosis of the colon family, who were treated at the proctological department of Hospital № 8 in Saratov from 2004 to 2006 on the stage of diagnosis all patients underwent double-contrast irrigoscopy and fibrocolonoscopy with biopsy. Endoscopic removal of polyps performed by electroscission through fibrocolonoscope «Olympus CF-E 3 L» with a standard loop <b>diathermy</b> and electrosurgical <b>apparatus</b> «Endothelial- 1 ». Results. Total rehabilitation after endoscopic polyp from retained sections of the colon and adequate comprehensive preoperative patients are routinely carried out successfully three right-left-sided hemicolec-tomy and 4 on the diffuse polyposis of the colon, complicated by recurrent bleeding or malignancy of polyps. Conclusion. Non-radical surgery in combination with endoscopic polypectomy does not relieve the patient diffuse polyposis of the colon family of high risk of colorectal cancer. In the case of diffuse polyposis, endoscopic polypectomy family is of limited value, as not able to eliminate completely a potential substrate of the disease, which is the entire mucosa of the colo...|$|R
