25|$|Three Oxford University colleges: Corpus Christi, Magdalen and Brasenose. {{have owned}} land and {{property}} in the parish. A connection with Queen's College comes from the 15th century when student John Copcot, walking in Shotover Forest reading his Aristotle, was attacked by a wild boar. <b>He</b> <b>thrust</b> the volume down the animal's throat and 'the boar expired'. The college ceremony of carrying in the Boar's Head at Christmas is derived from this, as is the stained glass window in St Giles church, presented in 1740 by the President of Magdalen to commemorate the Copcot Legend.|$|E
25|$|Some Irish legends {{involve the}} Oilliphéist, the Caoránach, and the Copóg Phádraig. During his evangelising journey back to Ireland from his parent's home at (perhaps) Birdoswald, he is {{understood}} to have carried with him an ash wood walking stick or staff. <b>He</b> <b>thrust</b> this stick into the ground wherever he was evangelising and at the place now known as Aspatria (ash of Patrick), {{the message of the}} dogma took so long to get through to the people there that the stick had taken root {{by the time he was}} ready to move on.|$|E
500|$|Rumfoord, who {{is based}} on Franklin D. Roosevelt, also {{physically}} resembles the former president. Rumfoord is described, [...] "he put a cigarette in a long, bone cigarette holder, lighted it. <b>He</b> <b>thrust</b> out his jaw. The cigarette holder pointed straight up." [...] William Rodney Allen, in his guide to Vonnegut's works, stated that Rumfoord foreshadowed the fictional political figures who would play major roles in God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater and Jailbird.|$|E

500|$|The Mahabharata {{describes}} him thus: Kabandha was [...] "as {{big as a}} mountain, dark as a black cloud, with pointed hairs {{all over}} his body and looked fierce with a voice as loud as thunder. He had an eye on his stomach, round and yellow, emitting a glare like a fire-name. Looking wicked <b>he</b> <b>thrust</b> his big tongue out of his huge mouth licking the sides." [...] The Ramayana presents a similar description of Kabandha. Kabandha had a broad chest and was without a head or neck. He had only one eye {{on his chest and}} a mouth on his belly. He used his long arms to draw his prey closer. Kabandha is often depicted as a tree.|$|E
2500|$|After <b>he</b> <b>thrust</b> it {{into the}} ground, all were {{astonished}} to see it suddenly become a green plant with leaves growing out of the top. Heaven had decided the matter. So Wamba [...] "went with the heralds to the electoral congress". Once there, however, he again tried to refuse the throne. At this, one of the Visigothic chieftains drew his sword and threatened to behead Wamba {{if he did not}} accept the crown. Wamba relented and consented.|$|E
2500|$|Tennyson was {{not quite}} finished. [...] "Now, Jack, a final letter. To the Hon. L H Tennyson, captain, Hampshire County CC, Trent Bridge, Nottinghamshire. `Dear Skipper, I humbly regret my behaviour, and so on,' you confounded old villain; and don't let us have a {{repetition}} of your disgraceful conduct. And, good evening to you, Jack, and, damn you, take this." [...] <b>He</b> <b>thrust</b> a five pound note– a considerable sum in those days– into Newman's hands.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay," [...] {{said the}} General, [...] "that were stooping {{too low for}} revenge. His sword had no more power than had <b>he</b> <b>thrusted</b> with a tobacco-pipe. Eagles stoop not at mallards, or wild-drakes either." ...|$|R

2500|$|Lee Smart had {{tossed the}} {{gasoline}} as Jerry Myles lit {{a match to}} a torch he had constructed from a mop. [...] <b>He</b> <b>thrust</b> the mop at the guard, who froze in fear.

[...] He quickly surrendered his keys and rifle and allowed himself to be led to the hole.|$|E
2500|$|.....upon all {{of these}} Cromwell's record was a lasting bane. By an uncompleted process of terror, by an iniquitous land settlement, by the virtual proscription of the Catholic religion, by the bloody deeds already described, he cut new gulfs between the nations and the creeds. 'Hell or Connaught' were the terms <b>he</b> <b>thrust</b> upon the native inhabitants, and they for their part, across three hundred years, have used as their keenest {{expression}} of hatred 'The Curse of Cromwell on you.'... Upon all of us there still lies 'the curse of Cromwell'.|$|E
2500|$|The {{game was}} played on a wet and {{slippery}} field that handicapped the offensive players. The Detroit Free Press reported that players had difficulty untracking themselves in [...] "the mire that lay over the gridiron like custard." [...] The teams played to a scoreless tie in a first half that featured a punting duel between Steketee and Rife. Michigan's first touchdown {{was set up by}} a 73-yard punt from Steketee that [...] "stuck fast in the mud" [...] at Ohio State's two- or three-yard line. Michigan's defense held, and Rife was forced to punt from his end zone. In the outstanding play of the game, Goetz blocked the punt and recovered it in the end zone for a touchdown. The Detroit Free Press described the key play as follows:"The pass from center was perfect and {{there seemed to be no}} fear that Rife would not get it away. [...] But Goetz, one man who has starred in every game the Maize and Blue played this year, shattered the line and rammed the Buckeye punter. Leather and Goetz collided and the pigskin went bounding away with Goetz in hot pursuit. Three scarlet-robed athletes tried to block Goetz's path to the ball, but <b>he</b> <b>thrust</b> them aside and went to earth with it just as his rivals in the race catapulted themselves at the leather." ...|$|E

2500|$|Wes Craven {{said his}} {{inspiration}} for the basis of Freddy Krueger's power stemmed from several stories in the Los Angeles Times about a series of mysterious deaths: All the victims had reported recurring nightmares and died in their sleep. Additionally, Craven's original script characterized Freddy as a child molester, which Craven said was the [...] "worst thing" [...] he could think of. The {{decision was made to}} instead make him a child murderer in order to avoid being accused of exploiting the spate of highly publicized child molestation cases in California around the time A Nightmare on Elm Street went into production. Craven's inspirations for the character included a bully from his school during his youth, a disfigured homeless man who had frightened him when he was 11, and the 1970s pop song [...] "Dream Weaver" [...] by Gary Wright. In an interview, he said, [...] "When I looked down there was a man very much like Freddy walking along the sidewalk. He must have sensed that someone was looking at him and stopped and looked right into my face. He scared the living daylights out of me, so I jumped back into the shadows. I waited and waited to hear him walk away. Finally I thought he must have gone, so I stepped back to the window. The guy was not only still looking at me but <b>he</b> <b>thrust</b> his head forward as if to say, 'Yes, I'm still looking at you.' The man walked towards the apartment building's entrance. I ran through the apartment to our front door as he was walking into our building on the lower floor. I heard him starting up the stairs. My brother, who is ten years older than me, got a baseball bat and went out to the corridor but he was gone." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{fighting}} between the squadrons and the bombarding of Tripoli lasted three hours, with Preble's squadrons emerging victorious. [...] However, success and promotion were overshadowed by an unfortunate {{turn of events}} for Decatur. During the fighting Decatur's younger brother, James Decatur, in command of a gunboat, was mortally wounded by a Tripolitan captain during the boarding of a vessel feigning surrender. Midshipman Brown, who was next in command after James, managed {{to break away from}} the ambushing vessel and immediately approached Decatur's gunboat bringing the news of his brother's death. Decatur had just captured his first Tripolitan vessel and upon receiving the news turned command of his captured prize over to Lieutenant Jonathan Thorn and immediately set out to avenge his brother's treacherous death. After catching up with and pulling alongside the Tripolitan ship, Decatur was the first to board the enemy vessel with Midshipman Macdonough at his heels along with nine volunteer crew members. [...] Decatur and his crew were outnumbered 5 to 1 but were organized and kept their form, fighting furiously side by side. [...] Decatur had little trouble singling out the corsair captain, the man responsible for James' death, and immediately engaged the man. He was a large and formidable man in Muslim garb, and armed with a boarding pike <b>he</b> <b>thrust</b> his weapon at Decatur's chest. Armed with a cutlass Decatur deflected the lunge, breaking his own weapon at the hilt. [...] During the fight Decatur was almost killed by another Tripolitan crew member, but his life was spared by the already wounded Daniel Frazier, a crewman who threw himself over Decatur just in time, receiving a blow intended for Decatur to his own head. The struggle continued, with the Tripolitan captain, being larger and stronger than Decatur, gaining the upper hand. Armed with a dagger the Tripolitan attempted to stab Decatur in the heart, but while wrestling the arm of his adversary, Decatur managed to take hold of his pistol and fired a shot point-blank, immediately killing his formidable foe. When the fighting was over, 21 Tripolitans were dead with only three taken alive.|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't {{very well}} miss them," [...] he muttered to himself, as <b>he</b> <b>thrust</b> his gun through a loophole, and fired. Without {{waiting to see}} the result, <b>he</b> <b>thrust</b> another gun out, aimed, and fired.|$|E
