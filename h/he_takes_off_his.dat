5|$|Stan {{leads the}} kids to Terrance and Phillip, who have been cornered by the US army. La Resistance forms a human shield while Kyle tries to persuade the army and his mother against killing the two. Sheila refuses and shoots Terrance and Phillip, which results in Satan, his minions, and Saddam attacking Earth. As a result, Sheila regrets everything. Saddam tries to usurp Satan's authority, but is sent back to Hell and killed, thanks to Cartman's {{malfunctioning}} V-Chip and Kenny's encouragement. Satan then grants Kenny a wish; Kenny asks for everything to return to how {{it was before the}} war, even though it means he will {{have to go back to}} Hell. <b>He</b> <b>takes</b> <b>off</b> <b>his</b> hood to say goodbye to his friends, but instead of returning to Hell, Kenny ascends to Heaven due to his act of sacrifice. Everything returns to normal in South Park.|$|E
25|$|Early {{the next}} morning, Bullitt drives home. As {{he walks up}} to his apartment, he spots Cathy's car. He looks in and sees her {{sleeping}} in his bedroom, {{but he does not}} wake her. <b>He</b> <b>takes</b> <b>off</b> <b>his</b> gun and balances it on a banister. As he begins to wash up at the bathroom sink, he looks up into his own reflection and contemplates himself for a long moment.|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "You Make Me Wanna..." [...] {{was directed by}} Bille Woodruff. It starts with Usher sitting in an orange wall recess, reaching for a guitar, before cutting to a scene of him standing in a white-and-purple circular room, wearing an open shirt. It moves to a blue backdrop where Usher advances, flanked by four dancers. The scene is replaced by five clones of Usher dancing and sitting on chairs. The video continues with the singer performing dance routines throughout; interspersed are scenes of Usher singing the song on a background of blue pipes. Toward {{the end of the}} video, <b>he</b> <b>takes</b> <b>off</b> <b>his</b> shirt in the circular room, and finally Usher and his backup dancers step out of their shoes and walk away.|$|E
60|$|He {{looked at}} <b>his</b> feet. Then <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>his</b> overcoat. His mother {{wondered}} if he were drunk.|$|R
60|$|My {{companion}} laughed softly. <b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>his</b> spectacles, {{and wiped}} {{them with a}} silk handkerchief.|$|R
60|$|With her {{assistance}} <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>his</b> coat, the arm {{of which}} was saturated with blood.|$|R
500|$|Diana asks Paul {{to prove}} to her how far he is {{prepared}} to go to create an alliance between them and to prove his loyalty he proposes that they sleep together. Diana suspects that Paul is not being genuine, but Paul insists that he is and describes Rebecca as [...] "collateral damage." [...] Paul believes that sleeping with Diana is the only option he has got to keep her on side. Dennis added that Paul feels guilty when <b>he</b> <b>takes</b> <b>off</b> <b>his</b> wedding ring and terrible about betraying Rebecca. Badler said that the situation is an [...] "ego thing" [...] for Diana and afterwards she makes it clear that her plans to destroy Paul have not changed. Badler said she enjoyed working with Stefan Dennis and said he is [...] "fantastic" [...] and that she felt comfortable with him. She said [...] "I kind of felt like it was a well-played tennis match â€“ every time you zing him something, he zings it right back. He's right there for you, so I absolutely loved working with him.|$|E
2500|$|A {{recurring}} joke, {{which was}} first shown in [...] "Radio Bart", is that Groundskeeper Willie {{appears to have}} a pot belly, but whenever <b>he</b> <b>takes</b> <b>off</b> <b>his</b> shirt, he is very muscular. One of Groundskeeper Willie's trademarks is a gruffly-spoken insulting retort, which take the writers {{a long time to come}} up with, although they do not consider them that funny.|$|E
60|$|BLOOM: I have {{forgotten}} for the moment. Ah, yes! (<b>He</b> <b>takes</b> <b>off</b> <b>his</b> high grade hat, saluting) Dr Bloom, Leopold, dental surgeon. You {{have heard of}} von Blum Pasha. Umpteen millions. Donnerwetter! Owns half Austria. Egypt. Cousin.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>his</b> hat to Isabel, {{nodded to}} Moody, and pursued {{his way to}} the farm.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>his</b> {{coat and}} hung it up. The {{children}} were peeping at him round the corner.|$|R
60|$|The chauffeur {{surveyed}} the three Rovers in amazement. Then <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>his</b> coat {{and shook it}} briskly.|$|R
6000|$|My mother {{opens the}} door softly as we alight. She does not speak, only looks her question. [...] "It's all over, Maggie," [...] answers my father very quietly, as <b>he</b> <b>takes</b> <b>off</b> <b>his</b> coat and lays it across a chair; [...] "we've got to begin the world afresh." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Oh yes,' {{says the}} General. An' <b>he</b> <b>takes</b> <b>off</b> <b>his</b> hat, an' Jone says good-night to me an' shuts the door. Our room {{was better than}} Mrs. General Jackson's, so I takes her in there, an' the fust thing she does is to turn on all the gases.|$|E
6000|$|... "Gosh {{blame them}} darned mules," [...] says Straw-top, {{in a voice}} so good that I nearly apologized; [...] "they're a'lus bustin' loose." [...] And then {{he looks at me}} close, and then <b>he</b> <b>takes</b> <b>off</b> <b>his</b> hayseed hat, and says, in a {{different}} voice: [...] "I'd like to shake hands with Parleyvoo Pickens, the greatest street man in the West, barring only Montague Silver, which you can no more than allow." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>his</b> silk hat and, {{blowing out}} impatiently his bushy moustache, welshcombed his hair with raking fingers.|$|R
60|$|She followed, {{and they}} sat side by side. <b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>his</b> hat {{and laid it}} on the ground.|$|R
60|$|As she meditated, {{at about}} nine o'clock, {{he opened the}} door and came in, slinking, and yet sulky. She said not a word. <b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>his</b> coat, and slunk to his armchair, where <b>he</b> began to <b>take</b> <b>off</b> <b>his</b> boots.|$|R
60|$|The {{driver of}} the pack-horses is afraid. The fear is always there in him, {{in spite of his}} sturdy, healthy robustness. His soul is not sturdy. It is blenched and whitened with fear. The {{mountains}} are dark overhead, the water roars in the gloom below. His heart is ground between the mill-stones of dread. When he passes the extended body of the dead Christ <b>he</b> <b>takes</b> <b>off</b> <b>his</b> hat to the Lord of Death. Christ is the Deathly One, He is Death incarnate.|$|E
60|$|All {{this is done}} very, very quietly, very impressively. No one in {{the theater}} has ever seen a man lay a silk hat on a table before, {{and so there is}} a breathless hush. Then <b>he</b> <b>takes</b> <b>off</b> <b>his</b> gloves, one by one, not two or three at a time, and lays them in his hat. The {{expectancy}} is almost painful. If he had thrown his gloves into the mica fire {{it would have been a}} relief. But he doesn't.|$|E
6000|$|If {{you meet}} {{a member of that}} select club, [...] "The Twelve True Fishermen," [...] {{entering}} the Vernon Hotel for the annual club dinner, you will observe, as <b>he</b> <b>takes</b> <b>off</b> <b>his</b> overcoat, that his evening coat is green and not black. If (supposing that you have the star-defying audacity to address such a being) you ask him why, he will probably answer that he does it to avoid being mistaken for a waiter. You will then retire crushed. But you will leave behind you a mystery as yet unsolved and a tale worth telling.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>his</b> soutane, beneath {{which he}} was wearing {{close-fitting}} breeches and a cloth waistcoat, and began changing his attire.|$|R
60|$|Roy Beeman's low laugh was significant. <b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>his</b> sombrero {{and stood}} silent. The old driver smothered a loud guffaw.|$|R
60|$|Johnson {{had been}} finding it chilly {{a short time}} ago but <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>his</b> hat now and mopped his forehead.|$|R
6000|$|BRODIE. Saved! And the alibi! Man, but you've been near it this time--{{near the}} rope, near the rope. Ah, boy, {{it was your}} neck, your neck you fought for. They were closing hell-doors upon me, swift as the wind, when I slipped through and shot for heaven! Saved! The dog that sold me, I settled him; and the other dogs are staunch. Man, but your alibi will stand! Is the window fast? The {{neighbours}} must not see the Deacon, the poor, sick Deacon, up and stirring at this time o' night. Ay, the good old room in the good, cosy old house ... and the rat a dead rat, and all saved. (He lights the candles.) Your hand shakes, sir? Fie! And you saved, and snug and sick in your bed, and it but a dead rat after all? (<b>He</b> <b>takes</b> <b>off</b> <b>his</b> hanger and lays it on the table.) Ay, it was a near touch. Will it come to the dock? If it does! You've a tongue and you've a head, and you've an alibi; and your alibi will stand. (<b>He</b> <b>takes</b> <b>off</b> <b>his</b> coat, takes out the dagger, and with a gesture of striking.) Home! He fell without a sob. [...] "He breaketh them against the bosses of His buckler!" [...] (Lays the dagger on the table.) Your alibi ... ah, Deacon, that's your life!... your alibi, your alibi. (He takes up a candle and turns towards the door.) O!... Open, open, open! Judgment of God, the door is open! ...|$|E
60|$|The farmer is {{of a much}} ruder and rougher mould {{than his}} brother,-- heavier in frame and mind, and far less cultivated. It was on this account, probably, that he labored as a farmer, instead of setting up a shop. When it is warm, as yesterday, <b>he</b> <b>takes</b> <b>off</b> <b>his</b> coat, and, not minding whether or no his shirt-sleeves be soiled, goes in this guise to meals or {{wherever}} else,---not resuming his coat {{as long as he}} is more comfortable without it. His shoulders have a stoop, and altogether his air is that of a farmer in repose. His brother is handsome, and might have quite the aspect of a smart, comely young man, if well dressed.|$|E
6000|$|VALENTINE (instantly {{changing}} his tone {{for one of}} cordial sincerity, as if he frankly accepted her terms and was delighted and reassured by her principles). Oh, then that's a point of sympathy between us already. I quite agree with you: the conditions are most unfair. (<b>He</b> <b>takes</b> <b>off</b> <b>his</b> hat and throws it gaily on the iron table.) No: what I want is {{to get rid of}} all that nonsense. (He sits down beside her, so naturally that she does not think of objecting, and proceeds, with enthusiasm) Don't you think it a horrible thing that a man and a woman can hardly know one another without being supposed to have designs of that kind? As if there were no other interests---no other subjects of conversation---as if women were capable of nothing better! ...|$|E
60|$|Monsieur Bril bored to {{the last}} page of the poems. Then <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>his</b> spectacles, and wiped them with his handkerchief.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{hear your}} boss!" [...] cried Webb sardonically. <b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>his</b> hat, and bowed until it touched the floor before his wife.|$|R
60|$|So saying, <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>his</b> {{cup with}} much gravity, {{at the same}} time shaking his head at the intemperance of the Scottish harper.|$|R
6000|$|Suppose {{yourself}} one {{of half a}} dozen children, and {{you hear}} the cry, [...] "Father Morris is coming!" [...] You run to the window or door, and you see a tall, bulky old man, with a pair of saddle bags on one arm, hitching his old horse with a fumbling carefulness, and then deliberately stumping towards the house. You notice his tranquil, florid, full-moon face, enlightened by a pair of great round blue eyes, that roll with dreamy inattentiveness on all the objects around; and as <b>he</b> <b>takes</b> <b>off</b> <b>his</b> hat, you see the white curling wig that sets off his round head. He comes towards you, and as you stand staring, with all the children around, he deliberately puts his great hand on your head, and, with deep, rumbling voice, inquires,-- ...|$|E
60|$|After dinner I {{found in}} the billiard-room a {{resident}} whom I had known somewhere else in the world, and presently made some new friends and drove with them out into the country to visit his Excellency {{the head of the}} State, who was occupying his country residence, to escape the rigors of the winter weather, I suppose, for it was on breezy high ground and much more comfortable than the lower regions, where the town is, and where the winter has full swing, and often sets a person's hair afire when <b>he</b> <b>takes</b> <b>off</b> <b>his</b> hat to bow. There is a noble and beautiful view of ocean and islands and castellated peaks from the governor's high-placed house, and its immediate surroundings lie drowsing in that dreamy repose and serenity which are the charm of life in the Pacific Islands.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, well," [...] Evan said, [...] "it don't make no odds {{whether they}} was Turks or Americans. However, the butler says as how the Captain Bayley what lived in those days, {{he saw a}} red Injun a-crawling to stab the king, who was a-lying asleep in his tent, and just as his hand was up to stick in the knife, Captain Bayley he gives a cut with his sword which whips off two of the fingers, and before the Injun could turn round and go at him he gives another cut, and takes off his hand at the wrist, and the next cut <b>he</b> <b>takes</b> <b>off</b> <b>his</b> head; so the hand with three fingers holding a dagger was given him to carry as a crest. I suppose after a time the hand got wore out, or got bad, so as he couldn't have carried it about no longer, and instead of that, {{as a kind of}} remembrance of the affair, he 'as them put on his forks and spoons." ...|$|E
60|$|Girdlestone was {{staggered}} for {{a moment}} by this unexpected counter. Then <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>his</b> broad-brimmed hat and bowed his head with drooping lids.|$|R
6000|$|Then <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>his</b> hat to {{the uniformed}} figure which led the advance. [...] "Ye're surely lang in comin', Sergeant, dear," [...] he said.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>his</b> funnel hat {{and from}} beneath it {{produced}} a tiny white piglet, which he held aloft that all might see it clearly.|$|R
