40|$|Differential {{scanning}} calorimetry (DSC), temperature programmed desorption {{mass spectrometry}} (TPD-MS) and small angle neutron scattering (SANS) {{were used to}} investigate CO 2 uptake by the Wyodak coal. Adsorption of carbon dioxide on Wyodak coal was studied by DSC. The <b>exotherms</b> evident at low temperatures {{are associated with the}} uptake of CO 2 suggesting that carbon dioxide interacts strongly with the coal surface. Reduction {{in the value of the}} <b>exotherms</b> between the first and second runs for the Wyodak coal suggests that some CO 2 is irreversibly bound to the structure even after heating to 200 °C. DSC results also showed that adsorption of CO 2 on the coal surface is an activated process and presumably at the temperature of the <b>exotherms</b> there is enough thermal energy to overcome the activation energy for adsorption. The adsorption process is instantly pursued by much slower diffusion of the gas molecules into the coal matrix (absorption). Structural rearrangement in coal by CO 2 is examined by change in the glass transition temperature of coal after CO 2 uptake at different pressures. The amount of gas dissolved in the coal increases with increasing CO 2 pressure. TPD-MS showed that CO 2 desorption from the Wyodak coal follows a first order kinetic model. Increase in the activation energy for desorption with pre-adsorbed CO 2 pressure suggests that higher pressures facilitate the transport of CO 2 molecules through the barriers therefore the amount of CO 2 uptake by the coal is greater at higher pressures and more attempts are required to desorb CO 2 molecules sorbed at elevated pressures.

40|$|Controlled {{release of}} sodium lauryl {{sulphate}} (SLS) from monolithic elastomeric pellets represents one way of achieving long-term inhibition of bacterial oxidation of pyrite. The degree of cure of elastomeric formulations influences the rate of release of SLS. Vulcanization decreases the permeability of the elastomeric matrix and results in slower release of SLS. The effect of SLS loading on the vulcanization of natural rubber and synthetic cis- 1, 4 -polyisoprene has been studied by DSC. Dynamic temperature scans show that the heat of reaction (ΔH), which {{is a measure of}} the area of the exothermic peak, decreases with increasing SLS content. The decrease in ΔH is not very significant at SLS levels up to 15 %, but is clearly noticeable at levels of 25 %. In the case of formulations which contain 35 % SLS, no curing <b>exotherms</b> are observed. It is therefore concluded that rubber formulations which contain 35 % or more SLS are unvulcanized. Analysis of curing <b>exotherms</b> by means of the Borchardt and Daniels DSC kinetics data analysis program gives inconclusive results.
