5|$|Catalysis is {{performed}} in two stages. First, the activated nucleophile attacks the carbonyl carbon and forces the carbonyl oxygen {{to accept an}} electron, leading to a tetrahedral intermediate. The build-up of negative charge on this intermediate is typically stabilized by an oxanion hole within the active site. The intermediate then collapses back to a carbonyl, ejecting {{the first half of}} the substrate, but leaving the second half still covalently bound to the enzyme as an acyl-enzyme intermediate. The ejection of this first leaving group is often aided by <b>donation</b> <b>of</b> a proton by the base.|$|E
