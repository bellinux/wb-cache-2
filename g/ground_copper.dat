This paper aims at studying the electromechanical effect the droplet experiences when subdued to an external AC voltage.

A simulated model has been completed on COMSOL, multi-physics software, to gather an understanding of the forces produced on the droplet due to the application of an external electric field. Thus far, the major force acting on the droplet is due to the Maxwell Stress, a force accompanied with the application of an electric field.

40|$|Effects of polymer {{heatsink}} {{materials on}} electromagnetic interference (EMI) noise in converters {{have not been}} adequately investigated. Heatsinks provide a path to ground for the common-mode (CM) noise. Selecting an appropriate heatsink material can therefore help reduce CM noise by increasing noise path impedance. The critical parameter is the heatsink-to-device capacitance and accurate models of the heatsink impedance need to be developed. This is necessary for results that are accurate enough to allow prequalification of a converter as would happen in an accredited environment. However, simplified CM and differential-mode models of the step-down DC-DC converter are adequate to predict {{the effects of the}} heatsink on the conducted noise. This study will demonstrate that compared to a solid aluminium material, using polymer material incorporating conductive fillers can greatly lower the device-to-heatsink capacitance, and still be adequate for heat dissipation in low power converters. This in turn reduces CM noise in the frequency band below 30 MHz. The measurement test setup is configured according to MIL-STD- 461 F standard. It consists of a wideband two-port line impedance stabilising network (LISN), a properly <b>grounded</b> <b>copper</b> sheet, a suspended feed-line from the LISN to the device under test and an oscilloscope recording the data.

40|$|Cold Atmospheric Plasma Jet (CAPJ), with ion {{temperature}} close to room temperature, has tremendous potential in biomedical engineering, and can potentially offer a therapeutic option that allows cancer cell elimination without damaging healthy tissue. We developed a hand-held flexible device for {{the delivery of}} CAPJ to the treatment site, with a modified high-frequency pulse generator operating at a RMS voltage of < 1. 2 kV and gas flow in the range 0. 3 - 3 l/min. The aims of our study were to characterize the CAPJ emitted from the device, and to evaluate its efficacy in elimination of cancer cells in-vitro and in-vivo. The power delivered by CAPJ was measured on a floating or <b>grounded</b> <b>copper</b> target. The power did not drastically change over distances of 0 - 14 mm, and was not dependent on the targets resistance. Temperature of CAPJ-treated target was 23 °- 36 ° C, and was dependent on the voltage applied. Spectroscopy indicated that excited OH- radicals were abundant both on dry and wet targets, placed at different distances from the plasma gun. An in-vitro cell proliferation assay demonstrated that CAPJ treatment of 60 seconds resulted in significant reduction in proliferation of all cancer cell lines tested, and that CAPJ activated medium was toxic to cancer cells. In-vivo, we treated cutaneous melanoma tumors in nude mice. Tumor volume was significantly decreased in CAPJ-treated tumors relatively to controls, and high dose per fraction was more effective than low dose per fraction treatment. Importantly, pathologic examination revealed that normal skin was not harmed by CAPJ treatment. This preliminary study demonstrates the efficacy of flexible CAPJ delivery system against melanoma progression both in-vitro and in-vivo.
