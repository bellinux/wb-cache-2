40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effect of monetary policy development on <b>equity</b> <b>prices</b> in the Nigerian Stock Exchange Market using annual data from 1985 to 2010. The ordinary least square regression (OLS) was run using five monetary policy variables including minimum re-discount rate, treasury bill rate, interest rate, exchange rate and consumer price index (proxy for inflation) on the <b>equity</b> <b>prices</b> (proxied by all share price index). The first investigation {{of this study is}} that minimum rediscount rates and Treasury bill rates are highly correlated and cannot be applied simultaneously in monetary policy management. As a consequence, the Treasury bill rates were dropped in the course of further analysis. The general result of the analysis showed a weak correlation between monetary policy and <b>equity</b> <b>prices.</b> This reflected in the explanatory variables which accounted only 15. 6 % in the changes of <b>equity</b> <b>prices</b> in Nigeria. All the explanatory variables are negatively and insignificantly related to <b>equity</b> <b>prices,</b> except the consumer price index that has insignificant positive relationship with <b>equity</b> <b>prices.</b> The study has revealed that monetary policy has not made significant influence over the <b>prices</b> of ordinary <b>equities</b> in Nigeria.

50|$|Changes in term {{structure}} {{form one}} of the most important sources of risk in a portfolio. Unlike an <b>equity</b> <b>price,</b> which just moves one-dimensionally, the price of a fixed-income security is calculated from sum of discounted cash flows, where the discount rate used depends on the interest rate at that maturity. The magnitude and shape of curve changes are therefore of major importance to fixed-income managers.|$|E
40|$|We {{show that}} the default event defined by {{endogenous}} credit-risk models (i. e. low asset values) can likewise be {{described in terms of}} low <b>equity</b> <b>prices</b> and negative net cash-flows (high debt service and/or negative earnings). Specifically, distance-to-default (DD), a volatility-adjusted measure of leverage, is given by the ratio of <b>equity</b> <b>prices</b> to negative net cash flows. This implies that the probability of default is the probability of this ratio becoming small, which then depends on the path of these two variables. This helps to explain why just <b>equity</b> <b>prices</b> (price per share, past return, and volatility) and firm’s debt and profitability are significant in reduced-form models that predict default while Merton’s DD becomes redundant if we control for them [Campbell et al. (2008) ]. In endogenous models, default is triggered by depressed <b>equity</b> <b>prices</b> and a negative flow to shareholders (rather than low asset value). And, inversely, default concerns are readily lessened by easing refinancing costs (e. g. sovereigns for which default is costly and which regularly roll over their debts), lowering the principal (underwater mortgages or subprime consumer loans, which increases equity value), or raising equity (troubled banks). credit-risk, default-risk, Merton’s distance-to-default, <b>equity</b> <b>prices</b> to negative net cash-flow ratio, endogenous defaul...|$|R

40|$|Using {{static and}} dynamic panel data analysis, we examine how {{interest}} rates influenced <b>equity</b> <b>prices</b> of European banks {{and insurance companies}} between 2006 and 2015. Identification and quantification of effects of the low yield environment, which {{is a consequence of}} decreasing interest rates, are crucial for regulators and policy makers. Our static and dynamic models show that decreasing short-term interest rates had a negative impact both on banks and insurers. In this thesis, dynamic models are estimated by means of the Blundell- Bond system GMM estimator and we consider their results superior to the results of static models because all underlying assumptions of the dynamic models are met here. Results obtained by employing the Blundell-Bond system GMM estimator suggest that life insurers were effected more than banks, while banks were effected more than non-life insurers. In case of a 1 percentage point decrease in short-term interest rates, <b>equity</b> <b>prices</b> of life insurers are estimated to decrease on average by 18 %, <b>equity</b> <b>prices</b> of banks by 8 %, and <b>equity</b> <b>prices</b> of non-life insurers by 3 %.

40|$|We {{develop a}} model for pricing {{securities}} whose value may depend simultaneously on equity, interest-rate, and default risks. The framework may {{also be used to}} extract probabilities of default (PD) functions from market data. Our approach is based entirely on observables such as <b>equity</b> <b>prices</b> and interest rates, rather than on unobservable processes such as firm value. The model stitches together in an arbitrage-free setting a CEV equity model (to represent the behavior of <b>equity</b> <b>prices</b> prior to default), a default intensity process, and a Heath-Jarrow-Morton model for the evolution of riskless interest rates. The model captures several stylized features such as a negative relation between <b>equity</b> <b>prices</b> and <b>equity</b> volatility, a negative relation between default intensity and <b>equity</b> <b>prices,</b> and a positive relationship between default intensity and equity volatility. We embed the model on a discrete-time, recombining lattice, making implementation feasible with polynomial complexity.

50|$|A swap is a {{derivative}} {{in which two}} counterparties exchange cash flows of one party's financial instrument for {{those of the other}} party's financial instrument. The benefits in question depend on the type of financial instruments involved. For example, {{in the case of a}} swap involving two bonds, the benefits in question can be the periodic interest (coupon) payments associated with such bonds. Specifically, two counterparties agree to exchange one stream of cash flows against another stream. These streams are called the legs of the swap. The swap agreement defines the dates when the cash flows are to be paid and the way they are accrued and calculated. Usually at the time when the contract is initiated, at least one of these series of cash flows is determined by an uncertain variable such as a floating interest rate, foreign exchange rate, <b>equity</b> <b>price,</b> or commodity price.|$|E
