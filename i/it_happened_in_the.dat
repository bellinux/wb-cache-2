25|$|The {{theory of}} new Liberalism {{did not seem}} much more piquant or fertile than the respectable old.

25|$|Injuries to the genital {{areas can}} be swelling, lacerations, and bruising. Common genital {{injuries}} are anal injury, labial abrasions, hymenal bruising, tears of the posterior fourchette and fossa. Genital injuries are {{more prevalent in}} post-menopausal women and prepubescent girls. Internal injuries to the cervix and vagina can be visualized using colposcopy. Using colposcopy has increased the detection of internal trauma from six percent to fifty-three percent. Genital injuries to {{children who have been}} raped or sexually assaulted differ in that the abuse may be on-going or <b>it</b> <b>happened</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past after the injuries heal. Scarring is one sign of the sexual abuse of children.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the lockout-shortened 1998–99 season, the Knicks traded Charles Oakley to the Toronto Raptors for Marcus Camby {{while also}} trading John Starks {{in a package}} to the Golden State Warriors for 1994's 1st team all league {{shooting}} guard Latrell Sprewell (whose contract was voided by the Warriors after choking Warriors' head coach P. J. Carlesimo during the previous season). After barely getting into the playoffs with a 27–23 record, the Knicks started a Cinderella run. It started with the Knicks eliminating the #1 seeded Heat {{in the first round}} after Allan Houston bounced in a running one-hander off the front of the rim, high off the backboard, and in with 0.8 seconds left in the deciding 5th game. This remarkable upset marked {{only the second time in}} NBA history that an 8-seed had defeated the 1-seed in the NBA playoffs, and also the first time <b>it</b> <b>happened</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Eastern Conference. After defeating the Atlanta Hawks in the second round four games to none, they faced the Pacers yet again in the Eastern Conference Finals. Despite losing Ewing to injury for the rest of the playoffs prior to Game 3, the Knicks won the series (aided in part to a four-point play by Larry Johnson in the final seconds of Game 3) to become the first eighth-seeded playoff team to make it to the NBA Finals. However, in the Finals, the San Antonio Spurs, with superstars David Robinson and Tim Duncan, proved too much for the injury-laden Knicks, who lost in five games. The remarkable fifth game of this Finals is remembered for its 2nd half scoring duel between the Spurs' Tim Duncan and the Knicks' Latrell Sprewell, and was decided by a long jumper by Avery Johnson with 47 seconds left to clinch the title for the Spurs.|$|E

[...] This egg was also the key to unlocking the hidden character Smoke when <b>it</b> <b>happened</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Portal stage. In Mortal Kombat 4, Forden would say [...] "Toasty! 3D!" [...] after Scorpion did his burn Fatality, a reference to the fact that it is the first 3D game of the series. [...] "Toasty!" [...] is also found in Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks, appearing randomly after the character pulls off a chain of hits, though the picture of Forden was removed for that title, but brought back for the 2011 Mortal Kombat game.|$|E
500|$|Lovering {{appeared}} in the 2006 documentary loudQUIETloud, which covered the Pixies' 2004 reunion tour. His father died midway during the tour, and Lovering began drinking heavily as a result. According to Thompson, Lovering [...] "messed {{up a couple of}} songs" [...] during a number of live shows. [...] "It was all caught on film", said Thompson, [...] "but they re-edited this to look like <b>it</b> <b>happened</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle of our tour and it looked like this whole tour careened into this drunken stupor with David. It really wasn't like that at all". He toured with the Pixies throughout 2005 and 2006, while performing at the Magic Castle on Friday nights with The Unholy Three. In 2007, Lovering played a benefit concert for Wally Ingram as part of The Martinis. Later that year, he formed a new band called The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, with Los Angeles musicians Amit Itelman and Oscar Rey.|$|E
500|$|The {{scope of}} the Act's {{provisions}} is set out in Section 12. For someone to fall within the Act's purview, they must have either committed a crime inside the United Kingdom, or acted outside of the United Kingdom {{in a way which}} would have constituted a crime had <b>it</b> <b>happened</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> UK. For a prosecution in the latter case, the person must have a [...] "close connection" [...] to the UK, which includes being a British citizen, resident or protected person, a company incorporated in the UK, or a Scottish partnership. Section 13 provides the only defence available with the general bribery offences—that the conduct was necessary for the proper functioning of the intelligence services or, when engaged in active service, the armed forces. Under Section 14, senior officers or directors in a company which commits a general bribery offence will also be liable {{for the purposes of the}} Act. In the case of an offence committed by a partnership, Section 15 provides that the prosecution must be brought in the name of the partnership and not in the name of any of the partners.|$|E

500|$|Harold {{appears to}} have died late in the battle, {{although}} accounts in the various sources are contradictory. William of Poitiers only mentions his death, without giving any details on how it occurred. The Tapestry is not helpful, as it shows a figure holding an arrow sticking out of his eye next to a falling fighter being hit with a sword. Over both figures is a statement [...] "Here King Harold has been killed". It is not clear which figure {{is meant to be}} Harold, or if both are meant. The earliest written mention of the traditional account of Harold dying from an arrow to the eye dates to the 1080s from a history of the Normans written by an Italian monk, Amatus of Montecassino. William of Malmesbury stated that Harold died from an arrow to the eye that went into the brain, and that a knight wounded Harold at the same time. Wace repeats the arrow-to-the-eye account. The Carmen states that Duke William killed Harold, but this is unlikely, as such a feat would have been recorded elsewhere. The account of William of Jumièges is even more unlikely, as it has Harold dying in the morning, during the first fighting. The Chronicle of Battle Abbey states that no one knew who killed Harold, as <b>it</b> <b>happened</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> press of battle. A modern biographer of Harold, Ian Walker, states that Harold probably died from an arrow in the eye, although he also says it is possible that Harold was struck down by a Norman knight while mortally wounded in the eye. Another biographer of Harold, Peter Rex, after discussing the various accounts, concludes that {{it is not possible to}} declare how Harold died.|$|E
