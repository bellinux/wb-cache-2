25|$|Triploidy may be {{the result}} of either digyny (the extra haploid set is from the mother) or diandry (the extra haploid set is from the father). Diandry is mostly caused by {{reduplication}} of the paternal haploid set from a single sperm, but may also be the consequence of dispermic (two sperm) fertilization of the egg. Digyny is most commonly caused by either failure of one meiotic division during oogenesis leading to a diploid oocyte or failure to extrude one polar body from the oocyte. Diandry appears to predominate among early miscarriages, while digyny predominates among triploid zygotes that survive into the <b>fetal</b> <b>period.</b> However, among early miscarriages, digyny is also more common in those cases <8.5 weeks gestational age or those in which an embryo is present. There are also two distinct phenotypes in triploid placentas and fetuses that are dependent on the origin of the extra haploid set. In digyny, there is typically an asymmetric poorly grown fetus, with marked adrenal hypoplasia and a very small placenta. In diandry, a partial hydatidiform mole develops.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Di-(2 -ethylhexyl) {{phthalate}} (DEHP) {{has been}} widely used in polyvinyl chloride products and is ubiquitous in developed countries. Although maternal exposure to DEHP during <b>fetal</b> and/or neonatal <b>periods</b> reportedly affects reproductive and developmental systems, its effects on allergic diseases in offspring remain to be determined. OBJECTIVES: In the present study, we examined whether maternal exposure to DEHP during <b>fetal</b> and/or neonatal <b>periods</b> in NC/Nga mice affects atopic dermatitis-like skin lesions related to mite allergen in offspring. METHODS: We administered DEHP at a dose of 0, 0. 8, 4, 20, or 100 µg/animal/week by intraperitoneal injection into dams during pregnancy (gestation days 0, 7, and 14) and/or lactation (postnatal days 1, 8, and 15). Eight-week-old male offspring of these treated females were injected intradermally with mite allergen into their right ears. We then evaluated clinical scores, ear thickening, histologic findings, and protein expression of eotaxin in the ear. RESULTS: Maternal exposure to a 100 -µg dose of DEHP during neonatal periods, but not during <b>fetal</b> <b>periods,</b> enhanced atopic dermatitis-like skin lesions related to mite allergen in males. The results were concomitant with the enhancement of eosinophilic inflammation, mast cell degranulation, and protein expression of eotaxin in overall trend. CONCLUSION: Maternal exposure to DEHP during neonatal periods can accelerate atopic dermatitislike skin lesions related to mite allergen in male offspring, possibly via T helper 2 (TH 2) -dominant responses, which can be responsible, at least in part, for the recent increase in atopic dermatitis.

40|$|In early fetal development, the testis secretes – {{independent}} of pituitary gonadotropins – androgens and anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) {{that are essential}} for male sex differentiation. In {{the second half of}} fetal life, the hypothalamic–pituitary axis gains control of testicular hormone secretion. Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) controls Sertoli cell proliferation, responsible for testis volume increase and AMH and inhibin B secretion, whereas luteiniz-ing hormone (LH) regulates Leydig cell androgen and INSL 3 secretion, involved in the growth and trophism of male external genitalia and in testis descent. This differential regu-lation of testicular function between early and late <b>fetal</b> <b>periods</b> underlies the distinct clinical presentations of fetal-onset hypogonadism in the newborn male: primary hypogonadism results in ambiguous or female genitalia when early fetal-onset, whereas it becomes clini-cally undistinguishable from central hypogonadism when established later in fetal life.

Our objective was to verify effects of CSF 2 on blastocyst yield, determine posttransfer survival, and evaluate properties of the blastocyst formed after CSF 2 treatment. In vitro, CSF 2 increased the percentage of oocytes that became morulae and blastocysts. Blastocysts that were treated with CSF 2 tended to have a greater number of inner cell mass cells and had a higher ratio of inner cell mass to trophectoderm cells. There was no effect of CSF 2 on the incidence of apoptosis. Treatment with CSF 2 from d 5 to 7 after insemination increased embryonic survival as indicated by improved pregnancy rate at d 30 – 35 of gestation. Moreover, treatment with CSF 2 from either d 1 – 7 or 5 – 7 after insemination reduced pregnancy loss after d 30 – 35. Results indicate that treatment with CSF 2 can affect embryonic development and enhance embryo competence for posttransfer survival.

We used doublestaining with antibodies specific to pan-neural markers (neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and S 100 protein) and to hormones of pancreatic endocrine cells. NSE and S 100 -positive nerves and ganglia were identified in the human fetal pancreas from gestation week (gw) 10 onwards. Later the density of S 100 and NSE-positive fibers increased. In adults this network was sparse. The islets innervation started to form from gw 14. NSE-containing endocrine cells were identified from gw 12 onwards. Additionally, S 100 -positive cells were detected both in the periphery and within some of the islets starting at gw 14. The analysis of islets innervation has shown that the fetal pancreas contained neuro-insular complexes and the number of these complexes was reduced in adults. The highest density of neuro-insular complexes is detected during middle and late <b>fetal</b> <b>periods,</b> when the mosaic islets, typical for adults, form.

Free amino acid concentrations were measured in homogenates of placental villi, in samples of coelomic and amniotic fluid, and in the maternal serum from 17 normal pregnancies between 7 and 11 weeks of gestation. Significant positive relationships between maternal serum and placental tissue were found for 10 amino acids, indicating that active amino acid transport and accumulation by the human syncytiotrophoblast occurs as early as 7 weeks of gestation. The transplacental flux of most amino acid transport from maternal blood to the exocoelomic cavity was against a concentration gradient. The highest placental amino acid concentrations were found for taurine, glutamic acid, glycine and alanine. The amniotic fluid contained lower mean concentration of all amino acids than coelomic fluid and maternal serum. The concentration distribution of individual amino acids in coelomic and amniotic fluid were related indicating a passive transfer through the amniotic membrane. A coelomic-maternal gradient was observed in 19 out of 24 amino acids measured and positive correlations were found between maternal serum and coelomic fluid for concentrations of α-aminobutyric acid, tyrosine and histidine, suggesting that these amino acids are only partially retained and/or transferred more rapidly by the early placenta.

To overcome these problems, we exploited 2 different approaches, both of which allowed temporally and spatially restricted expression of BRAFV 600 E in the thyroid glands. First, we generated conditional transgenic mice harboring the loxP-neoR-loxP-BRAFV 600 Einternal ribosome entry site-green fluorescent protein sequence [Tg(LNL-BRAFV 600 E) ]. The double transgenic mice (LNL-BRAFV 600 E;TPO-Cre) were derived from a high expressor line of Tg(LNLBRAFV 600 E) mice and TPO-Cre mice; the latter expresses Cre DNA recombinase under the control of thyroid-specific thyroid peroxidase (TPO) promoter and developed PTC-like lesions in early life under normal serum TSH levels due to mosaic recombination. In contrast, injection of adenovirus expressing Cre under the control of another thyroid-specific thyroglobulin (Tg) promoter (Ad-TgP-Cre) into the thyroids of LNL-BRAF V 600 E mice did not induce tumor formation despite detection ofBRAFV 600 EandpERKin a small fraction of thyroid cells.

To assess the expression pattern of mstn in relation to myogenic proliferative (Pax 7 and MyoD) and differentiative (myogenin) markers, we evaluated muscles with different myosin heavy-chain compositions sampled during pre- and post-natal development and on myogenic cells isolated from the same muscles.

The wide distribution of mstn was also confirmed by immunohistochemistry experiments supporting evidence for cytoplasmic staining in early <b>fetal</b> <b>periods</b> as well as the localization in type 1 fibers at the end of the gestation period. Extraocular muscles, in contrast, did not exhibit decreasing mRNA levels for mstn or other genes even in adult samples and expressed higher levels of both mstn mRNA and protein compared with skeletal muscles.
