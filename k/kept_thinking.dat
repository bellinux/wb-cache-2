25|$|I {{had watched}} Ken Barrington – a great Test batsman – {{as a boy}} and when I broke into the England side in the late Seventies he became a father figure. In fact, he was a mentor {{to a lot of}} us then – myself, David Gower, Ian Botham, Mike Gatting. Ken was an England {{selector}} and assistant manager on the West Indies tour of 1981. There were no official coach in those days but it was to Ken that most of us turned. Unlike many retired pros, he never used the words, 'In my day...' On the first night of the Test, he suffered a heart attack in our hotel. I was woken the next morning at around 8am by tour manager Alan Smith and captain Ian Botham. I knew something was wrong, because Both was never up before then. They told me the news. I had tears in my eyes when we went out on to the pitch for the minute's silence and again when I was batting in the second innings. We needed over 500 to win and it soon became apparent that we weren't going to get them. But I <b>kept</b> <b>thinking</b> of him and managed to make a hundred. Kenny was a counsellor, a friend and an inspiration.|$|E

500|$|At {{the age of}} nine, Swift became {{interested}} in musical theater and performed in four Berks Youth Theatre Academy productions. She also traveled regularly to New York City for vocal and acting lessons. Swift later shifted her focus toward country music inspired by Shania Twain's songs, which made her [...] "want to just run around the block four times and daydream about everything". She spent her weekends performing at local festivals and events. After watching a documentary about Faith Hill, Swift felt sure {{that she needed to}} go to Nashville, Tennessee, to pursue a music career. At the age of eleven, she traveled with her mother to visit Nashville record labels and submitted a demo tape of Dolly Parton and Dixie Chicks karaoke covers. However, she was rejected since [...] "everyone in that town wanted to do what I wanted to do. So, I <b>kept</b> <b>thinking</b> to myself, I need {{to figure out a way}} to be different".|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Brian Iles. He was assisted by James Purdum and Peter Shin worked as the supervising directors for the episode. Other crew members that collaborated in the animation of the episode included Deborah Cone who directed the retake of the episode and Kenji Ono who was the {{assistant director of the}} episode. Iles sketched out several clothing ideas for Peter to wear. He got ideas by flipping through catalogs. The name of all the horses at the race track are named after canceled Fox shows from May 2005 until this episode aired. It is a tribute to a similar mentioning of canceled shows when Family Guy came back on the air in May 2005 in the episode [...] "North by North Quahog". When the episode got close to airing, MacFarlane <b>kept</b> <b>thinking</b> they should remove the cutaway gag with Matt Damon, due to MacFarlane liking Damon's criticism of Sarah Palin.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by George Meyer. It is one of The Simpsons creator Matt Groening's {{favorite}} episodes of the earlier seasons {{because he thought it}} took the show to another level. Meyer said he has a [...] "deep suspicion of social institutions and tradition in general," [...] which affected the way he wrote the episode. Al Jean and Mike Reiss, who had written for The Simpsons {{since the start of the}} show, took over as show runners for the third season. Their first episode as show runners was [...] "Mr. Lisa Goes to Washington" [...] and they felt a lot of pressure about running the show. Jean and Reiss were so pressured that they did six to seven rewrites of the script to make it funnier. Jean said [...] "one reason for doing all these rewrites is because I <b>kept</b> <b>thinking</b> 'It's not good enough. It's not good enough'," [...] and Reiss added that [...] "we were definitely scared. We had never run anything before, and they dumped us on this." ...|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reaction}} {{towards the}} character was generally mixed. In a DVD {{review of the}} first series, Michael Mackenzie of Home Cinema thought Macfadyen {{was not a very}} good actor and believed [...] "he seems to be in some sort of contest with Keanu Reeves to see how long he can maintain the same lifeless facial expression," [...] but thought the character himself, particularly his personal life, mostly worked well for the most part as it continues [...] "as a standard soap opera." [...] In review of the second series, Dennis Landmann of MovieFreak praised the [...] "drama and intensity that builds around his character," [...] noting Tom's somewhat [...] "haunted soul" [...] and the last five minutes of the last episode [...] "were so powerful they affected how I felt {{for the next couple of}} days; I <b>kept</b> <b>thinking</b> about the character and the tragic events that happened to him." [...] In the third series, Mackenzie praised the episode where Tom tries to clear his name, but thought his exit was [...] "not particularly satisfying." [...] However, David Blackwell of Enterline Media thought that his farewell scene was [...] "one of [...] best moments of the first two episode (in addition to the way Tom acts in the opening episode)." ...|$|E

500|$|Emmy Award winner Terence Winter, who {{had served}} as {{executive}} producer and writer on the critically acclaimed HBO series The Sopranos, was hired to adapt the novel Boardwalk Empire: The Birth, High Times, and Corruption of Atlantic City on June 4, 2008. Winter had been interested in creating a series set in the 1920s, feeling that it had never properly been explored before. It was {{for this reason that}} he decided to focus his adaption of the novel on the Prohibition era section. On September 1, 2009, it was announced that Academy Award-winning director Martin Scorsese would direct the pilot. It would be {{the first time he had}} directed an episode of television since an episode of Steven Spielberg's Amazing Stories in 1986. The production would be very ambitious, with some even speculating it would be too large scale for television. [...] "I <b>kept</b> <b>thinking</b> 'This is pointless. How can we possibly afford a boardwalk, or an empire? says creator Terence Winter. [...] "We can't call it 'Boardwalk Empire' and not see a boardwalk." [...] The production would eventually build a [...] boardwalk in an empty lot in Brooklyn, New York at the cost of five million dollars. Despite a reported budget of up to $50 million, the pilot's final budget came in at $18 million.|$|E
500|$|Lucas based the CGI on the {{character}} as he originally appeared in Return of the Jedi. In this film, Jabba the Hutt is an immense, sedentary, slug-like creature designed by Lucas's Industrial Light & Magic Creature Shop. Design consultant Ralph McQuarrie claimed, [...] "In my sketches Jabba was huge, agile, sort of an apelike figure. But then the design went into another direction, and Jabba became more like a worm kind of creature." [...] According to the 1985 documentary From Star Wars to Jedi, Lucas rejected initial designs of {{the character}}. One made Jabba appear too human—almost like a Fu Manchu character—while a second made him look too snail-like. Lucas finally settled on a design that was a hybrid of the two, drawing for further inspiration on an O'Galop cartoon figure flanking an early depiction of Bibendum (also known as the [...] "Michelin Man"). Return of the Jedi costume designer Nilo Rodis-Jamero commented, My vision of Jabba was literally Orson Welles when he was older. I saw him as a very refined man. Most of the villains we like are very smart people. But Phil Tippett kept imagining him {{as some kind of}} slug, almost like in Alice in Wonderland. At one time he sculpted a creature that looked like a slug that's smoking. I <b>kept</b> <b>thinking</b> I must be really off, but eventually that's where it led up to." ...|$|E
500|$|Daavettila {{graduated}} from Michigan Tech in 2008 and tried {{out for the}} Flint Generals of the International Hockey League (IHL). He appeared in two games for the Generals {{at the end of}} the season (for only about three shifts), and did not register a point. Daavettila had not originally planned to pursue a professional hockey career, but said [...] "When I got one skate with Flint, it kind of sparked my interest and I decided to give it a try". During the off-season, Daavettila worked for a structural engineering firm in Saginaw, Michigan. He used vacation time at the start of the next hockey season later in 2008 to try out for the Grand Rapids Griffins of the American Hockey League (AHL) and the Muskegon Lumberjacks (IHL), though he was rejected by both teams. Tryouts with two more IHL teams, the Kalamazoo Wings and the Bloomington PrairieThunder, did not result in a contract either. Daavettila assumed his hockey career was over and went back to his engineering job, but he continued to skate a couple times a week. He had left an impression on Kalamazoo coach Nick Bootland, however, who called Daavettila back in March 2009 after his team was depleted by injuries. [...] "You could see he had a skill set," [...] said Bootland. [...] "But I thought the way he held on to the puck, he was going to get himself killed. ... You <b>kept</b> <b>thinking</b> he was going to make a mistake. Then he'd pop a guy for a breakaway." ...|$|E

The sight of you has somehow brought back a lot of things.... I can't explain it.

500|$|As Seen On TV was {{a highly}} {{acclaimed}} show in the United Kingdom {{by the time it}} ended in 1987. Wood, having just received a BAFTA for the first series, said at the time: [...] "I was very pleased to win, but it really put pressure on me. I was already writing the new series and every time I looked at the award I <b>kept</b> on <b>thinking</b> that people would be expecting so much more now and I just wouldn't be able to live up to it. In the end, I just put the thing away." [...] The series then went on to win BAFTAs for its entire run.|$|R
500|$|After {{the success}} of his 2002 {{documentary}} Spellbound, Jeffrey Blitz was encouraged by his agents to write fiction because of the larger revenue brought in by fiction films. Blitz began to piece together a story that had come to him while he had been filming Spellbound: [...] "I <b>kept</b> <b>thinking,</b> what if we met a kid that was just an amazing lover of words? What if we met a kid that was lured into the spelling bee because {{he was in love with}} a girl?" [...] He had compiled a mental list of characters who he expected to encounter while making Spellbound, several of whom eventually became Rocket Science characters. Despite claiming to be [...] "allergic" [...] to autobiographical films, he was persuaded by HBO executive Maud Nadler to write a screenplay based on his own adolescence when he told her that, as a teenager, he joined his school's debate team to try and overcome his stutter. He says that he is uninterested in teen films, so [...] "the only way I was going to do a teen movie is if I felt like I could try to be more honest about what the actual experience of being a teenager is like." [...] He was aware of the clichés in teen films, so [...] "tried to undo them without wrecking them". Blitz wrote the script [...] "off and on" [...] over a year in between stints of commercial directing. He cites directors Hal Ashby and Billy Wilder as his greatest influences with their absurdist comedies, though critics have suggested influence from Gary Larson, Alexander Payne, Mike Nichols and Wes Anderson—the latter despite Blitz specifically saying, [...] "I did not want a Wes Andersen [...] snowglobe artificial world." ...|$|E

But the rest of the time, I couldn’t get a job.” Between football seasons Smukler could only make money doing piecework as a glove cutter. “It was enough to discourage any man, and I <b>kept</b> <b>thinking</b> about what I was going to do when I couldn’t play football anymore.

[...] Kerry has also received some criticism from African Americans because his campaign inner circle was entirely white. Kerry also remarked on Bill Clinton's close relationship with African Americans: [...] "President Clinton was often known as the first black president.

The Razorbacks got the ball with ten minutes left in the fourth quarter and scored two touchdowns in a span of 4½ minutes. The tying touchdown was a 92-yard touchdown pass to Richard Smith from Matt Jones.
