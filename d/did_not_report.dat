5|$|At {{the time}} of the invasion, many units of the 4th Army were still at their {{mobilisation}} centres or in their concentration areas, and {{only a small number of}} units had actually deployed into their planned positions to defend the border. A significant number of conscripts <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>report</b> to their mobilisation centres. The logistics of the 4th Army were in a poor state, mainly due to a lack of livestock and vehicles for transport, but also due to fifth column sabotage by the Ustaše and their sympathisers, to the extent that many units did not even have 10 per cent of their transport needs. It was also equipped poorly, lacking in many tools of modern warfare, including tanks, light artillery, anti-aircraft weapons and air support. These deficiencies affected both its fighting power and morale.|$|E
