In 1932, Cavendish laboratory scientists John Cockcroft and Ernest Walton split the atomic nucleus, James Chadwick discovered the neutron, and Patrick Blackett and Giuseppe Occhialini confirmed the existence of the positron.

50|$|They {{observed}} the same spontaneous fission activities as those {{observed in the}} reaction between bismuth-209 and chromium-54 and again assigned them to 261Bh and 257Db. Later evidence indicated that these should be reassigned to 258Db and 258Rf (see above). In 1983, they repeated the experiment using a new technique: measurement of alpha decay from a decay product that had been separated out chemically. The team were able to detect the alpha decay from a decay product of 262Bh, providing some evidence {{for the formation of}} bohrium nuclei. This reaction was later studied in detail using modern techniques by the team at LBNL. In 2005 they measured 33 decays of 262Bh and 2 atoms of 261Bh, providing an <b>excitation</b> <b>function</b> for the reaction emitting one neutron and some spectroscopic data of both 262Bh isomers. The <b>excitation</b> <b>function</b> for the reaction emitting two neutrons was further studied in a 2006 repeat of the reaction.

The analysis of the 1000 proton spectra recorded {{in the course of the}} experiment was performed entirely by computers. It was found that the angular distributions change rapidly with incident proton energy, and that the reaction <b>excitation</b> <b>functions</b> exhibit structure of the intermediate type. Cross-correlation analysis revealed that there is significant correlation between the structures associated with the different reaction <b>excitation</b> <b>functions.</b> The experimental data were compared with the predictions of the doorway state theory of intermediate structure.
