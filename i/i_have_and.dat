500|$|By December 2011, Romney assumed an {{even more}} {{prominent}} role in the campaign, {{as she tried to}} offer a more rounded and compelling portrait of her husband while he fell behind Newt Gingrich for a stretch in polls. [...] Her emphasis on their 42years of marriage and his steadfastness following the onset of her disease offered an implicit but clear contrast with Gingrich's own personal history. [...] She had long been known within the family as the [...] "Mitt-stabilizer", due to the calming effect she had on her husband, and continued to perform that role during the up-and-down campaign. [...] In particular, she began appearing with him more often during February 2012 as he dueled with Rick Santorum during the Republican presidential primaries. [...] Regarding the couple's net worth, she alluded to her health problems and said, [...] "Look, I don't even consider myself wealthy, which is an interesting thing, it can be here today and gone tomorrow. And how I measure riches is by the friends <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>and</b> the loved ones that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>and</b> the people that I care about in my life." ...|$|E
500|$|Waldron's own {{assessment}} of his style {{was that it}} was partly a reflection of his personality: [...] "It's part of my personality to be very economical with what <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>and</b> to use it in all variations before I move to the next set of notes". He acknowledged the influences of Holiday (on his conception of space and playing behind the beat), Mingus (for the importance of individuality), and Roach (on the value of time signatures other than the usual 4/4), as well as pianists Duke Ellington, Monk, Powell and Art Tatum.|$|E
500|$|Designer Milton Knight {{recalled}} that [...] "audiences actually wanted a wilder, raunchier Cool World. The premiere audience I saw it with certainly did." [...] The critical {{reaction to the}} film was generally negative. Roger Ebert wrote, [...] "The DJ who was hosting the radio station's free preview of Cool World leaped onto the stage and promised the audience: 'If you liked Roger Rabbit, you'll love Cool World!' He was wrong, but you can't blame him—he hadn't seen the movie. <b>I</b> <b>have,</b> <b>and</b> I will now promise {{you that if you}} liked Roger Rabbit, quit while you're ahead." [...] The film was a box-office disappointment. While other film projects followed, Bakshi began to focus more attention on painting.|$|E

500|$|In July 2007, it was {{announced}} that Jackson had signed a recording contract with Island Records, after her five-album deal with Virgin Records America was fulfilled with the release of her album 20 Y.O. Jackson's tenth studio album, Discipline, which was an acknowledgment of Jackson's commitment, focus and dedication to her career, was released on February 26, 2008 under the supervision of label head L. A. Reid. Jackson commented, [...] "I wanted to name the album Discipline because {{it has a lot of}} different meanings for me but the most important would be work—to have done this for as long as <b>I</b> <b>have...</b> <b>And</b> to have had the success that I've had—not excluding God by any means—but it takes a great deal of focus." ...|$|E
500|$|..... And when Michel {{gets his}} strokes of genius and, {{in the video}} for [...] "Army of Me", wants a dentist that's a gorilla to find a diamond in my mouth, some people call it nonsense. But it's {{probably}} the most realistic way of expressing what situation I'm in - all these people trying to take things away from me, and the gorilla finding a diamond that I don't know <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>and</b> then stealing it. [...] "Army of Me" [...] is so much about me actually learning that I have to defend myself. I {{have to stand up}} and fight the fucking gorilla. Once I've got the diamond and I run away with it, it becomes massive 'cos it's mine. But if the gorilla had kept it, it would have gone really tiny. That's surrealism for me.|$|E

[...] "Some people in the American Medical Association, a certain group of them, didn't even know that I was a physician.

2500|$|Boardman {{retired after}} the Olympics, {{at the age}} of 32. In an {{interview}} Boardman admitted that {{the last two years of}} his professional career were the most difficult, especially because of his debilitating condition and marital issues. Boardman was diagnosed with osteoporosis by the time he was 30, a condition which is uncommon for someone as young as he was.

2500|$|During {{his early}} career, Ó Domhnaill played a dark journeyman's Guild {{dreadnought}} guitar {{on stage and}} on recordings. In 1977, he commissioned a custom-made guitar from luthier Kenny White who was based out of Portland, Oregon. During the 1990s, he played a 1975 Martin D-28, which he used on his later recordings and stage appearances. In a 1996 interview, Ó Domhnaill observed, [...] "It's gotten louder, fuller, clearer, and more bell-like. It wasn't a great instrument when I bought it, {{but it was a}} Martin, and I knew it would improve if I played it. <b>I</b> <b>have,</b> <b>and</b> it's worked." [...] Ó Domhnaill also owned a custom-made guitar by another Portland luthier Terry Demezas. He preferred medium-gauge phosphor-bronze strings, and used a large triangular Fender medium flatpick when not fingerpicking. For much of his career, he performed with a small quiver of tin whistles and a pedal harmonium.|$|E

Darren Hayes said of the recording; [...] "It's a long time ago, but my recollection is I was writing about the relationship that <b>I</b> <b>have,</b> <b>and</b> continue to have, with the women in my life. From my Sister to my Mother and all the friends and the wonderful female relationships in my life. I know I'm indebted to these incredibly strong women who loved me and taught {{me what it was}} like to be strong and succeed in a world where you sometimes feel underestimated." [...] The album also includes a bonus DVD of Australian and international music video releases. It accompanies a major re-release of their two studio albums with bonus tracks and live performances, the first time their catalogue has received such treatment.|$|E

2500|$|My Everything is a pop-R album. It revisits the '90's retro-R style {{present in}} Grande's debut album Yours Truly: Annie Zaleski from The A.V. Club, {{described}} the album as a [...] "slick throwback to melodramatic ’80s and ’90s pop." [...] The album's tracks include EDM, hip hop tunes and piano-driven ballads. The album opens with [...] "Intro", in which Grande addresses her fans: [...] "I'll {{give you all}} <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>and</b> nothing less, I promise". The second track is the lead single [...] "Problem", an uptempo dance-pop song influenced by R, jazz, hip hop and funk. Rap-Up described the track as an [...] "infectious horn-heavy jam" [...] that features a [...] "carefree" [...] Grande [...] "declaring her independence". It includes [...] "an empowering verse from Iggy Azalea and a whispering Big Sean on the hook." [...] "One Last Time" [...] is a dance-pop and EDM-light song. The album continues with [...] "Why Try", co-written and co-produced by Ryan Tedder and Benny Blanco and features the lyrics [...] "Now we're screaming just to see who's louder". Some critics expressed an opinion that the song has a similar composition with Beyoncé's [...] "XO" [...] (2013; also produced by Tedder).|$|E
2500|$|One of the {{passengers}} of the bus approached Treviño Morales weeping and saying: [...] "Please, sir. I {{do not want to}} do this. I will give you all the money <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>and</b> my own house, but please let us go." [...] Treviño Morales stared at him firmly, took away his club and then said, [...] "Okay, stupid asshole. Leave," [...] and while the crying man was walking away, Treviño Morales swung his bat and hit him {{in the back of the}} head—and then struck him more than 20 times until his head was completely destroyed. He then turned around and said to the kidnapped victims: [...] "This is what you have to do. Have some balls (courage). Anyone who does not want to can tell me and I will beat the hell out of you." [...] All of the men started fighting. Several other Zeta members, who were still on a bus with other passengers, ordered the women whom they considered the most beautiful to descend the vehicle so they could rape them. Then they took away the children from their mothers, and shot the rest of the bus passengers. The women were taken to a warehouse where many other women were held captive. Inside a dark room, the women were reportedly raped and beaten, while one heard the screams of the women and of the children being put in acid. A driver of one of the buses was then asked to turn on the bus engine, and then ordered to move the bus to where the kidnapped victims were handcuffed and laid down on the dirt floor. [...] "Drive on top of them," [...] one of the killers told the bus driver, who stood there motionless. [...] "Drive on top of them or I will put you there too, asshole," [...] the killer repeated. As the driver rode over his passengers with the bus, he felt like the vehicle was passing over speed bumps, but the only difference was that the bus driver and {{the passengers}} could actually hear the cries of the people as they were being run over. The gunmen, once the driver was finished, shot him in the head and shot the rest on board. The bus was then set on fire by the Zetas. Treviño Morales then gathered all the Zetas and said, [...] "We have had enough fun for tonight. Bring the winners." [...] His men brought all of those who had passed the gladiator-like competitions, and they were gathered in front of Treviño Morales.|$|E
