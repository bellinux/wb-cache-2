5000|$|The article {{begins by}} {{discussing}} <b>the</b> crucial concept <b>of</b> “entitlements,” which {{are defined as}} the rights established and protected by law, <b>the</b> absence <b>of</b> which {{would result in a}} “might makes right” world where either the strongest or shrewdest emerge victorious in any conflict. Thus, as the authors point out, the fundamental thing that law (<b>the</b> setting <b>of</b> <b>entitlements)</b> does is to decide which <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conflicting parties will be entitled to prevail. The authors also point out, however, that successfully enforcing these <b>entitlements</b> (<b>the</b> law) is as important as establishing them {{in order to avoid the}} “might makes right” world. From this notion, the authors consider three types of entitlements: entitlements protected by property rules, entitlements protected by liability rules, and inalienable entitlements. According to Calabresi and Melamed, an entitlement protected by a property rule is one that must be bought in a voluntary transaction in which <b>the</b> value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>entitlement</b> is agreed upon by the buyer and seller. With an entitlement protected by property rule, a collective decision is made as to who is to be given <b>the</b> initial <b>entitlement,</b> but not as to <b>the</b> value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>entitlement</b> itself. An entitlement protected by a liability rule, however, involves a collective decision as to <b>the</b> value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>entitlement</b> without <b>the</b> need for a voluntary transaction. A destroyer of an initial entitlement protected by a liability rule must pay an objectively valued sum to <b>the</b> holder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>entitlement.</b> <b>The</b> final <b>entitlement</b> <b>the</b> authors consider in the article is an entitlement protected by an inalienability rule. As the authors define it, an entitlement is inalienable to the extent that its transfer is not permitted between a willing buyer and a willing seller. Under this rule, the state intervenes to determine <b>the</b> initial <b>entitlement,</b> to forbid its sale or purchase, and to determine compensation to be paid if it is sold or destroyed. To conceptualize these three <b>entitlements,</b> <b>the</b> authors use <b>the</b> example <b>of</b> an individual homeowner whose house may be protected by a property rule where another individual wishes to purchase it, a liability rule where the government seizes the home by eminent domain, or an inalienability rule where the homeowner is drunk or incompetent. Having defined <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> <b>entitlements</b> and laid out the three rules that they will focus on, the article proceeds to explore the following two questions: (1) In what circumstances should a particular entitlement be granted? And, (2) In what circumstances should a property, liability or inalienability rule be used to protect an entitlement? ...|$|R

40|$|Legal {{scholars}} have extensively analyzed legal entitlements {{in terms of}} more fundamental component parts, most notably with the remedial structures entailed by property and liability rules. Contrary to the claim made by some scholars, I argue that <b>the</b> negligence <b>entitlement</b> is not fully constituted by property rules, liability rules, or any combination thereof. <b>The</b> <b>entitlement</b> that generates <b>the</b> negligence rule, though partially constituted by both property and liability rules, is best described as a behavioral rule that obligates duty-holders to exercise reasonable care. <b>The</b> breach <b>of</b> this primary duty creates a second-order duty to pay compensation for the proximately caused physical harms, but <b>the</b> payment <b>of</b> compensatory damages does not fully exhaust or satisfy <b>the</b> underlying <b>entitlement.</b> This component <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>entitlement</b> explains why duty-holders are subject to punitive damages and perhaps even criminal negligence liability {{if they choose to}} act unreasonably in exchange for <b>the</b> payment <b>of</b> compensatory damages. <b>The</b> <b>entitlement</b> takes this form due to <b>the</b> inherent inadequacy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> compensatory damages remedy, an inadequacy that is most pronounced in cases of wrongful death but applies more generally to many instances <b>of</b> physical harm. <b>The</b> article concludes by identifying <b>the</b> distinctive features <b>of</b> <b>the</b> negligence <b>entitlement</b> that must be accounted for by any normative theory seeking to adequately explain tort liability, a condition that is not satisfied by prominent interpretations of tort law, including leading accounts based on the fault principle, pluralism, allocative efficiency, and corrective justice. The underlying rationale for tort liability cannot be derived from a structural (non-normative) analysis <b>of</b> <b>entitlements,</b> but <b>the</b> <b>entitlement</b> structure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> negligence rule still has important implications for <b>the</b> normative theory <b>of</b> tort law...|$|R
