40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is {{to design and fabricate}} a smart rack gadget for the use of wiremen that is portable and multifunction as well. This smart rack gadget is multifunctional as it possesses extra features such as a removable small tool box and extension plugs. The smart rack gadget can be used to store tools and equipment which used by wiremen such as test pen, wire stripper, Phillips screwdriver and so on. The smart rack gadget can uphold a maximum load of 25 Kg. The material selected for fabrication process is Galvanized iron sheets as it is cheap and easy to be fabricated. Other materials that are used in fabricating this smart rack gadget are <b>handle,</b> <b>lock,</b> and door slot, fasteners such as screws and rivets. The process have been involved in this project are cutting, bending, drilling, welding, riveting, and finishing. Solidwork Simulation Xpress software is used to simulate the stress analysis which occurs at critical part of the smart rack gadget such as the handle. Friction analysis is carried out to find the friction force that occurs at the trolley. Lastly, the {{objective of}} the project is achieved since the new smart rack gadget is portable and multifunction as well. It would ease the work of wiremen during their working hours...|$|E
40|$|Vehicle {{security}} {{system has been}} a topic of great interest over the years due to the increasing vehicle theft cases reported all over the world. Most of the advanced vehicle {{security system}}s best suit the four wheelers. As of the security system for two wheelers is concerned, the systems available in market are of no match to the well equipped thieves. When under attack, these systems can only immobilize the engine and sound a loud alarm. It is a serious limitation. In this {{paper we propose a}} reliable and robust design of Two Wheeler Vehicle Security System (TWVSS) with features enhancing the security of the vehicle and ensuring the safety of the rider. In our proposed security system various new features are included in addition to the engine immobilizer and alarm. Few of the important features supported by our system are alerting owner by SMS about the theft attempt, allowing user to control the system remotely by SMS, tracking the location of vehicle using GPS technology, Remote Keyless System, servo motor operated locking system (<b>handle</b> <b>lock,</b> fuel lock and rear wheel lock) and side stand indicator. Redundancy is maintained to make the system reliable even in the worst case scenario, but due to cost constraints a tradeoff between cost and redundancy was necessary. Our system is designed to be compatible with almost all the brands of vehicle...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is {{to design and fabricate}} a smart mousetrap to improve product in the market to catch more than one mouse and the mousetrap is safe for human and pets at home. This mousetrap is easy to use and not complicated. It also can be use oftenly, which mean that it can be use over and over again. The mousetrap also has no any poisonous or harmful substance use and the most important is that the mousetrap is safe to human where it will not injure the user. It also can catch up to maximum of four mouse. The material used in fabricating this mousetrap is galvanized iron sheet because the galvanized iron is cheap and easy to fabricate. Other materials that are used in fabricating this mousetrap are Perspex, fastener such as screws and rivet, <b>handle,</b> <b>lock</b> and door slot. The process {{have been involved in the}} project are cutting, bending, drilling and riveting. Solidwork Simulation Xpress software is used to simulate the stress analysis on critical part of the mousetrap. From the observation, handle support will be a critical part to sustain a maximum load. Lastly, the {{objective of}} this project has been achieved where the mousetrap can catch up to more than one mouse and it is safe to be use where it does not bring harm or any injury to the user and also pets at hom...|$|E

5000|$|In theory, {{the architects}} of the Macintosh system {{software}} were free to change the [...] "flags in the high byte" [...] scheme to avoid this problem, and they did. For example, on the Macintosh IIci and later machines, HLock (...) and other APIs was rewritten to implement <b>handle</b> <b>locking</b> in a way other than flagging the high bits of handles. But, many Macintosh application programmers {{and a great deal of}} the Macintosh system software code itself accessed the flags directly rather than using the APIs, such as HLock (...) , which had been provided to manipulate them. By doing this they rendered their applications incompatible with true 32-bit addressing, and this became known as not being [...] "32-bit clean".|$|R

Door <b>handles,</b> <b>locks,</b> and window cranks were modernized and less protruding, the door pockets were elastic, the rear-view mirror frame was chrome instead of black plastic, and the side view mirrors became more angular.
