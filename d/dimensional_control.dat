40|$|In {{this paper}} it is {{considered}} a class of infinite-dimensional control systems in a variational setting. By using a Faedo-Galerkin method, a sequence of approximating finite <b>dimensional</b> <b>controlled</b> differential equations is defined. On each of these systems a variable structure control is applied to constrain the motion on a specified surface. Under some growth assumptions the convergence of these approximations to an ideal sliding state for the infinite-dimensional system is shown. Results are then applied to the Neumann boundary control of a parabolic evolution equation. ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAn {{implicit}} Lyapunov-based {{approach is}} proposed for generating trajectories of a finite <b>dimensional</b> <b>controlled</b> quantum system. The main difficulty {{comes from the}} fact that we consider the degenerate case where the linearized control system around the target state is not controllable. The controlled Lyapunov function is defined by an implicit equation and its existence is shown by a fix point theorem. The convergence analysis is done using LaSalle invariance principle. Closed-loop simulations illustrate the performance of such feedback laws for the open-loop control of a test case considered by chemists...|$|R

Experiment III provided groups equated in number of reinforcers with groups in Experiment I and two 8 -min duration groups.

These subject the rock to multiple point loading, inducing stress into the material to exploit any natural weaknesses. At the second stage, material is broken in tension by being subjected to a three-point loading, applied between the front tooth faces on one rotor, and rear tooth faces on the other rotor. Any lumps of material that still remain oversize, are broken as the rotors chop through the fixed teeth of the breaker bar, thereby achieving a three <b>dimensional</b> <b>controlled</b> product size.|$|R
40|$|Pigeons {{were exposed}} to {{discrimination}} training procedures using one-key multiple schedules of reinforcement and to generalization testing along dimensions of the two training stimuli. In the first two experiments using intradimensional discrimination training, both extinction and signalled reinforcement suppressed key-peck rate in one component and produced positive behavioural contrast, but only the extinction-trained group showed peak shift. Interdimensional training {{was used in the}} next four experiments and again the effects of stimulus control were compared. Both procedures resulted in excitatory <b>dimensional</b> stimulus <b>control</b> around the stimulus associated with the unchanged component but only the extinction procedure resulted in inhibitory <b>dimensional</b> stimulus <b>control</b> around the conditioned inhibitory stimulus, during generalization testing in extinction. <b>Dimensional</b> stimulus <b>control</b> was also investigated using two further types of generalization test, viz. combined-cue and resistance-to-reinforcement. However, these did not in general add anything to the analysis based on generalization testing in extinction.

40|$|THE AIM of {{this paper}} is to {{initiate}} a semigroup theory-based approach to characterization of optimal Markov controls for controlled semilinear stochastic evolution equations. (It may be recalled that Markov controls are those that depend only on the current state at each time.) For finite <b>dimensional</b> <b>controlled</b> stochastic differential equations with a nondegenerate diffusion matrix, this task is traditionally achieved through the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation of dynamic programming associated with the problem and an accompanying verification theorem. The latter states that an optimal Markov control can be explicitly obtained by the pointwise minimization of a Hamiltonian derivable from the solution of the HJB equation. Moreover, any optimal Markov control is obtainable in this manner...|$|R

It describes the basic principles of CT metrology, putting emphasis on issues as accuracy, traceability to the unit of length (the meter) and measurement uncertainty. It provides a state of the art (anno 2011) and application examples, showing the aptitude of CT metrology to: (i) check internal dimensions that cannot be measured using traditional coordinate measuring machines and (ii) combine <b>dimensional</b> quality <b>control</b> with material quality control in one single quality inspection run. status: publishe...|$|R

While this is an advantage in impoverished areas, purpose-built hives offer certain advantages in pest control, durability, and defensibility.

50|$|In some {{pressing}} operations, such as hot {{isostatic pressing}} (HIP) compact formation and sintering occur simultaneously. This procedure, together with explosion-driven compressive techniques, is used extensively {{in the production of}} high-temperature and high-strength parts such as turbine blades for jet engines. In most applications of powder metallurgy the compact is hot-pressed, heated to a temperature above which the materials cannot remain work-hardened. Hot pressing lowers the pressures required to reduce porosity and speeds welding and grain deformation processes. It also permits better <b>dimensional</b> <b>control</b> of the product, lessens sensitivity to physical characteristics of starting materials, and allows powder to be compressed to higher densities than with cold pressing, resulting in higher strength. Negative aspects of hot pressing include shorter die life, slower throughput because of powder heating, and the frequent necessity for protective atmospheres during forming and cooling stages.|$|E

50|$|He {{worked on}} the Milam Residence, which was {{designed}} and constructed between 1959 and 1961. It still stands today on Florida's eastern coast, outside Jacksonville. Here, the only <b>dimensional</b> <b>control</b> {{was the size of}} standard concrete blocks that were used (8 x 8 x 16 in), fair-faced, for structural and partition walls alike. The large blocks provide shade for the windows, allowing the Florida home to be easily cooled. This house's seaside facade of stacked rectangles exemplifies the sculptural nature of Rudolph's work during this period. From inside the structure, Rudolf wanted the inhabitants to locate themselves according to mood, so the large two-story window in the living room contrasts other areas of the home which feel more cave-like and secluded. Rudolph's fascination with European Modernism and the neo-Classical theory made this a difficult building to construct. Rudolph had to show concern for multiple influences as well as his own style. At the time, Rudolph was working independently and would later become an icon in European Modernism.|$|E
