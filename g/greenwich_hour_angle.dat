50|$|Using a {{nautical}} almanac, the declination (celestial latitude), and the <b>Greenwich</b> <b>hour</b> <b>angle</b> (celestial longitude) {{are obtained}} {{of the observed}} object for the time of observation. The assumed longitude is now added or subtracted to the <b>Greenwich</b> <b>Hour</b> <b>Angle</b> of the object to obtain the local hour angle, that is the difference in longitude between the DR position and the geographical position of the object.|$|E
50|$|With B the {{latitude}} (+N/S), L the longitude (+E/−W), LHA = GHA + L {{is the local}} hour angle, Dec and GHA are the declination and <b>Greenwich</b> <b>hour</b> <b>angle</b> of the star observed, and Hc the calculated altitude. Z is the calculated azimuth of the body.|$|E

50|$|Alternatively {{to right}} ascension, <b>hour</b> <b>angle</b> (abbreviated HA or LHA, local <b>hour</b> <b>angle),</b> a left-handed system, {{measures}} the angular distance {{of an object}} westward along the celestial equator from the observer's meridian to the hour circle passing through the object. Unlike right ascension, <b>hour</b> <b>angle</b> is always increasing with the rotation of Earth. <b>Hour</b> <b>angle</b> may be considered a means of measuring the time since upper culmination, the moment when an object contacts the meridian overhead.|$|R
50|$|Being B the {{latitude}} (+N/S), L the longitude (+E/-W). LHA = GHA + L {{is the local}} hour angle, Dec and GHA are the declination and <b>Greenwich</b> <b>hour</b> <b>angle</b> of the star observed. And Ho is the true or observed altitude, that is, the altitude measured with sextant corrected for dip, refraction, parallax.|$|E

Also depicted are the star's right ascension and <b>Greenwich</b> <b>hour</b> <b>angle</b> (GHA), the local mean sidereal time (LMST) and Greenwich mean sidereal time (GMST). The symbol ʏ identifies the vernal equinox direction.|$|E
5000|$|This only calculates a {{longitude}} at {{the assumed}} latitude though a position {{line can be}} drawn. The observer is somewhere along the position line.Time sight is a general method for determining longitude by celestial observations using a chronometer; these observations are reduced by solving the navigational triangle for meridian angle and require known values for altitude, latitude, and declination; the meridian angle is converted to local hour angle and compared with <b>Greenwich</b> <b>hour</b> <b>angle.</b>|$|E
50|$|To {{calculate}} the azimuth {{of the sun}} or a star given its declination and <b>hour</b> <b>angle</b> at our location, we modify the formula for a spherical earth. Replace φ2 with declination and longitude difference with <b>hour</b> <b>angle,</b> and change the sign (since the <b>hour</b> <b>angle</b> is positive westward instead of east).|$|R
50|$|Negative <b>hour</b> <b>angles</b> {{indicate}} the {{time until the}} next transit across the meridian; an <b>hour</b> <b>angle</b> of zero means the object is on the meridian.|$|R
50|$|A {{culminating}} {{star on the}} observer's meridian {{is said to have}} a zero <b>hour</b> <b>angle</b> (0h). One sidereal hour (approximately 0.9973 solar hours) later, Earth's rotation {{will carry}} the star {{to the west of the}} meridian, and its <b>hour</b> <b>angle</b> will be +1h. When calculating topocentric phenomena, right ascension may be converted into <b>hour</b> <b>angle</b> as an intermediate step.|$|R
50|$|In astronomy, {{hour angle}} {{is defined as}} the angular {{distance}} on the celestial sphere measured westward along the celestial equator from the meridian to the hour circle passing through a point. It may be given in degrees, time, or rotations depending on the application.In celestial navigation, the convention is to measure in degrees westward from the prime meridian (<b>Greenwich</b> <b>hour</b> <b>angle,</b> GHA), from the local meridian (local hour angle, LHA) or from the first point of Aries (sidereal hour angle, SHA).|$|E
50|$|A {{nautical}} almanac is a publication describing {{the positions of}} a selection of celestial bodies {{for the purpose of}} enabling navigators to use celestial navigation to determine the position of their ship while at sea. The Almanac specifies for each whole hour of the year the position on the Earth's surface (in declination and <b>Greenwich</b> <b>hour</b> <b>angle)</b> at which the sun, moon, planets and first point of Aries is directly overhead. The positions of 57 selected stars are specified relative to the first point of Aries.|$|E
50|$|The angle {{subtended}} at P between Z and X is the Local Hour Angle (LHA)of X. If Z {{is on the}} Greenwich Meridian, {{then that}} Angle must be the <b>Greenwich</b> <b>Hour</b> <b>Angle</b> (GHA) of X. If Z {{is not on the}} Greenwich Meridian, then you have the Local Hour Angle (LHA) of X, and if you know the GHA of X, {{all you need to do}} is add subtract the LHA of X accordingly, to discover the Longitude of Z. As you are usually standing on the point Z, you have your Longitude. If the sum comes to more than 360 degrees, simply subtract 360, the answer is simple.|$|E
50|$|Sidereal <b>hour</b> <b>angle,</b> used in {{celestial}} navigation, {{is similar}} to right ascension, but increases westward rather than eastward. Usually measured in degrees (°), it is the complement of right ascension with respect to 24h.It {{is important not to}} confuse sidereal <b>hour</b> <b>angle</b> with the astronomical concept of <b>hour</b> <b>angle,</b> which measures angular distance of an object westward from the local meridian.|$|R
50|$|The cosine of the <b>hour</b> <b>angle</b> (cos(h)) {{is used to}} {{calculate}} the solar zenith angle. At solar noon, h = 0.000 so cos(h)=1, and before and after solar noon the cos(± h) term = the same value for morning (negative <b>hour</b> <b>angle)</b> or afternoon (positive <b>hour</b> <b>angle),</b> i.e. the sun is at the same altitude in the sky at 11:00AM and 1:00PM solar time, etc.|$|R
5000|$|Eacott's work <b>Hour</b> <b>Angle</b> {{works in}} a similar way to Floodtide, yet its {{notation}} is generated by calculating the movement of the sun. [...] <b>Hour</b> <b>Angle</b> performances include the summer solstice of 2010 at Royal Observatory Greenwich.|$|R
50|$|Longitude by {{chronometer}} is a method, in navigation, {{of determining}} longitude using a marine chronometer, which {{was developed by}} John Harrison {{during the first half}} of the eighteenth century. It is an astronomical method of calculating the longitude at which a position line, drawn from a sight by sextant of any celestial body, crosses the observer's assumed latitude. In order to calculate the position line, the time of the sight must be known so that the celestial position i.e. the <b>Greenwich</b> <b>Hour</b> <b>Angle</b> (Celestial Longitude - measured in a westerly direction from Greenwich) and Declination (Celestial Latitude - measured north or south of the equational or celestial equator), of the observed celestial body is known. All that can be derived from a single sight is a single position line, which can be achieved at any time during daylight, when both the sea horizon and the sun are visible. To achieve a fix, more than one celestial body and the sea horizon must be visible. This is usually only possible at dawn and dusk.|$|E
5000|$|X is {{the point}} where center of {{celestial}} body lies on celestial sphere: The Sun, The Moon, The Planets, The Stars. Some of these points appear to move relative to the celestial sphere (The Sun, The Moon, The Planets), but the Stars' declination remain's more or less same as they are very far away but their hour angle(GHA or LHA) change constantly, in fact their hour angle changes by 360 degree in every 23 hour 56 minutes and 04.1 second of mean solar time. X is {{described in terms of}} its angular height above or below the equator, known as its Declination (corresponding to its Latitude), and its 'Hour angle', the angle between its meridian and the Greenwich meridian (corresponding to its Longitude). This angle, known as the Greenwich Hour Angle', gives its Longitude. If you are standing on the Greenwich meridian, the angle between your meridian and that of X will be its <b>Greenwich</b> <b>Hour</b> <b>Angle,</b> measured in degrees. However, if you are somewhere else, then the angle between you and the object is known as its Local Hour Angle.|$|E
50|$|Observing the sun from earth, {{the solar}} <b>hour</b> <b>angle</b> is an {{expression}} of time, expressed in angular measurement, usually degrees, from solar noon. At solar noon the <b>hour</b> <b>angle</b> is 0.000 degree, with the time before solar noon expressed as negative degrees, and the local time after solar noon expressed as positive degrees. For example, at 10:30 AM local apparent time the <b>hour</b> <b>angle</b> is -22.5° (15° per hour times 1.5 hours before noon).|$|R
5000|$|In {{this case}} the X point is the {{illuminating}} pole of the observed star, and the angle θ is its azimuth. The equation of the isoazimuthal curve for a star with coordinates (Dec, Gha), -Declination and <b>Greenwich</b> <b>Hour</b> Angle-, observed under an azimuth Z is given by: ...|$|R
50|$|Next, the {{altitude}} and azimuth of the celestial body are computed for a selected position (assumed position or AP). This involves resolving a spherical triangle. Given the three magnitudes: local <b>hour</b> <b>angle</b> (LHA), observed body's declination (dec), and assumed latitude (lat), {{the altitude}} Hc and azimuth Zn must be computed. The local <b>hour</b> <b>angle,</b> LHA, {{is the difference}} between the AP longitude and the <b>hour</b> <b>angle</b> of the observed object. It is always measured in a westerly direction from the assumed position.|$|R
