40|$|Departing {{from the}} case of textile and {{clothing}} trade dispute between the EU and China in 2005, it has been noticed that the EU’s policy in textile trade {{to a large extent}} has been situated in a position of dilemma. On the one hand, the growing global impetus of liberalization in the sector forces the EU to open up its market to cheap textile imports from the developing countries; on the other hand, the fierce protectionist pressures come from the domestic producers and slow down the paces towards liberalization, or sometimes even take setback towards more conservative performances. By placing this case in a broader context, the <b>EU’s</b> <b>external</b> <b>trade</b> policy is confronted with the similar dilemma, swaying between the trade liberalization and trade protection. Consequently, does the EU emerge in the current multilateral trading system of the WTO as a force for trade liberalization or a force for trade protectionism? Bearing this question in mind, the general climate of global trade under the GATT/WTO and the <b>EU’s</b> <b>external</b> <b>trade</b> policy will firstly be examined. Then, the EU’s trade protectionism is about to be explained by strategic trade theory, the high political content of the <b>EU’s</b> <b>external</b> <b>trade</b> policy and the fragmentation in the EU’s policy networks; while the EU’s inclination towards trade liberalization will be explained by the implications from the conventional trade theory and new institutionalism, and as well as the impacts from the general climate of global trade. The results shows that the <b>EU’s</b> <b>external</b> <b>trade</b> policy under the global trade liberalization is a mixture, neither pure liberalization nor pure protectionism. With regard to the trade issues concerning to the vital interests, the Union without exception inclines to conservative protectionism; whereas concerning the issues of less importance, compromises and concessions always lead the outcomes of the policy to the inspiring liberalization...|$|R

The existence of informal technical meetings in <b>EU</b> <b>external</b> <b>trade</b> negotiations – a classic example of principal-agent relations – illustrates that there is room in the principal-agent model for rectifying the anti-agent bias and the single-minded focus on goal conflict.

Apart of the headline indicators and flagship initiatives, the successful implementation of the Europe 2020 strategy depends from number of the framework polices of the EU, such as single market, budget, but also the external economic relations. The external economic relations depend directly to the theories of economic growth, in sense of the classical growth theory, inspired by two great economists Adam Smith and David Ricardo, which has considered internationalization and opening of the economies {{as one of the}} core growth factors. According to the survey of economic experts, implementation of Europe 2020 strategy will depend in equal parts, both from internal, but also from the external polices of EU. In this regard, external economic relations provide for very good framework continuous, as <b>EU</b> <b>external</b> <b>trade</b> grew over the years 2011 – 2012 significantly, the export increased by 71 % and import – by 74 %. Related to the <b>EU</b> <b>external</b> <b>trade</b> policies in general, they are manifold, starting from the negotiations of the international trade conditions within frames of World Trade Organization, stretching to the framework EU initiatives of Generalizes system of preferences (Everything but arms/EBA, GSP+) and bilateral trade agreements, which, as from year 2006 became the preferred international trade policy of EU.

40|$|Since the mid- 1990 s the European Union (EU) {{has been}} at the {{forefront}} of attempts to strengthen and promote the social dimension of globalisation through trade, focusing chiefly on the promotion of labour standards internationally through increased cooperation with the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and through its <b>external</b> <b>trade</b> policies. In a recent Communication on trade, growth and development the European Commission (2012) mentioned the need for change in order to foster growth, to develop synergies between trade and development policies and the importance of projecting the EU?s values and interests in the world, highlighting how the respect for human rights represents one of its core values in its external action. This is seen as part of the EU 2020 Strategy. In addition, the reform of the EU?s Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) to be implemented in 2014 is said to help the poorest developing countries. However, this stated different and more humane approach to trade begs an apparently very simple question: who are the beneficiaries of such change? In the current multi-polar system in which the EU no longer constitutes the centre stage of global policy making and in the context of the EU?s ?deep trade agenda?, namely the push for further trade liberalisation focusing on the removal of domestic non-tariff regulatory measures, as well as the escalation of the euro-zone crisis which is also unravelling, among other problems, the lack of solidarity among EU Member States and the inability to fight protectionism in situ, the legitimacy and credibility of EU action is called into question. The chapter explores the role the EU has committed itself to in relation to the promotion of social rights and international labour standards in its Common Commercial Policy (CCP). In particular, it seeks to critically examine who the real beneficiaries of the social conditionality imposed by the Commission in the <b>EU?s</b> <b>external</b> <b>trade</b> policy are. Indeed, the injection of a human rights agenda in the <b>EU?s</b> <b>external</b> <b>trade</b> policy raises many complex questions in relation to competence, coherence, effectiveness and legitimacy of the EU as a global actor. Furthermore, the conception of labour rights as human rights remains a moot and controversial question. This explains why at present there is little understanding of how to ensure the protection and promotion of social rights effectively through the <b>EU?s</b> <b>external</b> <b>trade</b> policy. In turn, this makes it all the more difficult to fully grasp what the role of the EU can be in developing a linkage between trade and the social, thus ensuring a system of trade promoting more equitable global trade and sustainability, which is founded on discourses of social responsibility and justice in addition to free trade and open market economies. This analysis is particularly prominent and made necessary by fundamental changes introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon (TL) specifically in relation to the CCP as well as the EU?s envisaged accession to the ECHR and the conferral of the same legal value of the Treaties to the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, which combined with other key institutional changes, will impact on the EU internal policies as well as the <b>EU?s</b> <b>external</b> action. In the light of these constitutional, institutional and substantive changes, the chapter explores whether it is possible to develop a legitimate and effective CCP in a globalised economy and draw some tentative conclusions as to what the above role of the <b>EU</b> in its <b>external</b> <b>trade</b> relations may tell us more generally about the EU?s humaneness...|$|R
40|$|About 90 % of the <b>EU’s</b> <b>external</b> <b>trade</b> and 40 % of {{internal}} trade is transported by sea. This corresponds to 3. 5 billion tonnes of freight loaded and unloaded in EU ports each year i. While individual port security breaches may cause much damage in themselves, the disruption that such security incidents cause to the supply chains can also become very costly. Thus, port security remains {{of paramount importance}} for Europe both due to direct threats to life and property {{as well as the}} potential for crippling economic damage arising from the effects on the supply chains. Ports represent significant challenges when implementing new security measures. They cover large geographical areas, they have very complex operations, they service large numbers of passengers and they process large volumes of goods. Maintaining high efficiency in the transportation of goods and passengers is vital to the port. As well as efficient surveillance and access control, this requires efficient organisational and technological interfaces, linking ports to border control authorities, the police, other intervention forces, and transport and logistics operators. Ports also represent the intersection between supply chain security measures (e. g., the USA CTPAT and CSI initiatives and the WCO SAFE Framework ii) and ship and port facility security measures (e. g., through the International Ship and Port Facility Security (ISPS) Code).

40|$|This chapter {{analyzes}} {{the difficulties of}} creating a viable legal framework for ‘cloned food’ in the EU combining a legal perspective with insights from the interdisciplinary research on risk governance. Animal cloning offers an instructive example for the challenges of designing regulatory frameworks for scientific innovations in the EU, especially {{in the area of}} food safety. It presents a nebulous combination of challenges to devising effective regulation: scientific uncertainty about risks to human health and the environment; strong international trade interest in the free circulation of ‘cloned foods’ on the EU market; and other concerns (e. g. ethics) as well as societal resistance and negative consumer preferences that affect the legitimacy of regulatory approaches. This mix of circumstances has hampered the establishment of new legal rules for animal cloning under the EU Novel Foods legal framework. The analysis of this paper reveals that the establishment of viable EU legal rules in this area has been afflicted with problems due to the complexity and multi-sectoral nature of animal cloning regulation. Moreover, strong pressure from the international trade market and international trade rules has resulted in persistent institutional disagreement over animal cloning. This indicates that legal and political pressure from <b>EU’s</b> <b>external</b> <b>trade</b> partners hampers the willingness and ability of the EU to establish precautionary and responsive risk frameworks...|$|R

40|$|This article {{analyses}} the EU’s Common Commercial Policy (CCP) at {{the level}} of Treaty revision and particularly focuses on the last Treaty negotiations that led to the Treaty of Lisbon. The analysis is based on a revised neofunctionalist framework that the author developed in previous work.

Insights into the dynamics and countervailing forces driving Treaty revisions considerably deepen our understanding of the Common Commercial Policy, as <b>EU</b> <b>external</b> <b>trade</b> policy-making is substantially affected by the parameters set by the Treaty. The analysis indicates that the revised neofunctionalist framework can broadly account for the changes of the Common Commercial Policy during the last Treaty revision. It is further suggested that integration in the area of trade policy cannot be explained exclusively by rational choice dynamics, such as utility maximizing actors with fixed preferences, but that socialization through deliberation also needs to be taken into account...|$|E

Expanding EU-China {{institutional}} {{cooperation in the}} energy sector has been matched by a parallel process of stronger economic ties between European and Chinese companies in the renewable energy (RE) sector (particularly wind and photovoltaics).

Although the role of EU-China energy cooperation has grown tremendously in the context of <b>EU</b> <b>external</b> <b>trade</b> policy and EU strategy to boost its energy independence and international climate policy, the potential of civil society collaboration in this partnership has remained rather unexploited.

Short Sea Shipping (SSS) represents approximately 33 % of intra-EU exchanges in terms of ton kilometers (European Union 2017).

Overall, SSS is an important transport mode in Europe, and policymakers expect it to facilitate more freight transport in order to relieve congestion on European roads and to increase sustainability (European Union 2011).|$|R

40|$|Research Highlights and Abstract Within the European Union (EU), the {{neoliberal}} trade policy {{has not only}} survived the global financial crisis (GFC) and Eurozone crisis, but has been reinforced throughout these crises. This has been helped by a legitimizing discourse by the European Commission that has continuously depicted free trade in a favourable relationship vis-a-vis the GFC and the Eurozone crisis. Empirically, this article shows how between 2008 and 2012, the EU trade discourse has been subtly adapted to the changing crisis environment: from defensive, over offensive-desirable and offensive-necessary towards necessary-but-not-sufficient {{at the time of}} writing. In the tradition of critical discourse analysis, we also point at the problematic assumptions and logics held by the discourse. Theoretically, it is shown how subtly adapting discourse to a fluctuating context can effectively limit policy change and legitimize continuity. The crisis starting in 2008 has not led to the demise but to the reinforcement of neoliberalism, not least within the European Union (EU). We argue that this can also be observed in the <b>EU's</b> <b>external</b> <b>trade</b> policy, where the European Commission's discourse has continued to legitimize neoliberal trade through subtle re-articulations of the relationship between free trade and the crisis. In this respect four stages can be discerned: defensive, offensive-desirable, offensive-necessary and necessary-but-not-sufficient. These subtle adaptations are articulated as coherent with the internal Eurozone crisis, although we show that their assumptions can be challenged. Theoretically, we engage in a critical analysis of the Commission's trade discourse {{in the context of the}} crisis. Empirically, we focus on the different EU Trade Commissioners' discourses between 2008 - 2012.

This paper analyses the macroeconomic impacts of the proposal. It employs three models: HERMES, GEM-E 3, and E 3 ME. All models confirm that the proposal will have positive macroeconomic impacts when the tax revenues are used to reduce social security contributions paid by employers. For the EU as a whole, both GDP and employment {{are expected to be}} higher, and CO 2 emissions are 0. 9 % to 1. 6 % lower. The positive EU-wide effects can be observed in practically all member states. The sector impacts are modest, with the energy sector expected to face the most negative impacts. Differences between model results are due to the model type (general equilibrium or macro-econometric), the EU countries covered, and the way tax exemptions were handled.

40|$|Starting {{from the}} concept of {{delegation}} of power in external trade policy, this paper aims to investigate the dynamics surrounding the European Union’s position in international trade negotiations. The analysis centres {{on the role of}} the European Commission (the agent), which by means of Treaty-based delegation and as mandated by the Council (the principal) acts as the sole trade negotiator in the international sphere on behalf of the European Union (EU). The broader negotiating process is thus conceptualised as a threelevel game, where the Commission holds an intermediary position between the European and international levels and also interacts with the Member States in the Council. After an insight into the European decision-making process for external trade, the paper further analyses the Commission’s role during the multilateral trade negotiations of the Doha Development Round. By applying the principal-agent theory to international trade negotiations in general, and subsequently to the controversial agricultural negotiations, this paper seeks to investigate some of the potential sources of autonomy that the Commission can draw upon while upholding an EU position at the international level, in addition to the “hardball” job of balancing the interests of the Member States with those of World Trade Organisation (WTO) partners. Along these lines, the paper finally aims to contribute to the literature concerning agency autonomy in <b>EU</b> <b>external</b> <b>trade</b> relations but also to provide a better understanding of inter-institutional relations within the EU as they may unfold in practice...|$|E

40|$|The mass of {{material}} consumed by a population {{has become a}} useful proxy for measuring environmental pressure. The “raw material equivalents” (RME) metric {{of material}} consumption addresses the issue of including the full supply chain (including imports) when calculating national or product level material impacts. The RME calculation suffers from data availability, however, as quantitative data on production practices along the full supply chain (in different regions) is required. Hence, the RME is currently being estimated by three main approaches: (1) assuming domestic technology in foreign economies, (2) utilizing region-specific life-cycle inventories (in a hybrid framework), and (3) utilizing multi-regional input−output (MRIO) analysis to explicitly cover all regions of the supply chain. While the first approach {{has been shown to}} give inaccurate results, this paper focuses on the benefits and costs of the latter two approaches. We analyze results from two key (MRIO and hybrid) projects modeling raw material equivalents, adjusting the models in a stepwise manner in order to quantify the effects of individual conceptual elements. We attempt to isolate the MRIO gap, which denotes the quantitative impact of calculating the RME of imports by an MRIO approach instead of the hybrid model, focusing on the RME of <b>EU</b> <b>external</b> <b>trade</b> imports.

40|$|The {{conclusion}} of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) constitutes a priority and key component of the external trade policy of the European Union (EU). It is also an immediate follow-up to several years of regulatory cooperation between the two global trade powers. In an era of megaregionals, services is the only area where significant negotiating traction exists at the bilateral and multilateral level. However, recent {{events such as the}} imminent Brexit and the withdrawal of the USA from the Transpacific Partnership (TPP) cast doubt on the future of trade deals. Even so, services remain a key sector of export interest for the EU and thus completing agreements such as the TTIP or the Trade in Services Agreement (TiSA) is of crucial importance, allowing the EU to create new opportunities for service suppliers but also to reshape the regulatory philosophy governing the future regulation of global trade in services. With respect to TTIP, the EU Commission, backed by the EU executive, has advanced an ambitious agenda and submitted a conditional offer to the US, hoping for further liberalization on {{the two sides of the}} Atlantic. Against this backdrop, this article offers a critical account of the <b>EU</b> <b>external</b> <b>trade</b> policy, focusing on the EU’s recent external action with respect to services liberalization. The article advances three theses: first, that such ambitious agreements mark a new era of offensive services strategy which, however, is contained by internal conflicts and disagreements regarding certain still sensitive silos such as audiovisual or public services and Brexit shall exacerbate such internal conflicts in the medium run; second, that megaregionals can be used to accelerate domestic regulatory reform and openness in the service sector; and third, that TiSA will constitute a litmus test for the EU’s commitment to the World Trade Organization (WTO) cause.

40|$|Defense date: 18 / 01 / 2010 Examining Board: Marise Cremona (EUI, Law Department), Christopher Hill (University of Cambridge), Erik Jones (Johns Hopkins, Bologna), Pascal Vennesson (EUI/RSCAS) (Supervisor) The {{aim of the}} PhD Thesis is to {{ascertain}} whether the EU is able to exert a political influence through its international trade agreements. Since the Union has always been considered as an economic giant and a political dwarf at the global level, {{the objective is to}} evaluate whether the <b>EU</b> <b>external</b> <b>trade</b> may be considered as a useful tool to address the gap between its economic and political relevance. If the EU is effectively able to wiled a political influence through trade also beyond the neighbourhood area, where it uses the membership card chip, the EU might have a greater global role. The conceptual analysis of the Thesis is based on the distinction between the EU trade Power (i. e. Resources, Institutions and Values), EU trade Policy activity and its final Influence in order to disentangle the 'levers' from the 'leverage' exercised by the EU through its external trade policy. The potential for political influence of the EU ultimately relies on the ability to change the norms, beliefs, rules and regulations in EU partner countries, during and after the trade negotiations. The empirical side of the research focuses on two bilateral agreements: the EU-Mexico Partnership Agreement (2000), and the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between the EU and South Korea (2009). Despite the strong differences between the case studies (in terms of their geographic location, production and export patterns, timing of the negotiations, etc.), Mexico and South Korea share four basic similarities: i) neither is an EU neighbouring country (i. e. the EU cannot use the membership card); ii) both are strongly dependant and receive their primary influence in economic, political and security terms from the United States; iii) both have strongly endorsed neoliberal and free market principles; and finally iv) each of them might be a potential gateway for the EU in its macro-region. Furthermore, Mexico and South Korea share also a more specific strategic value for the EU in three main respects. First, in both cases the rationale for EU to conclude the agreements was the same: economic and defensive vis-à-vis US previous trade agreements (the NAFTA and the US-South-Korea FTA). Second, the basic objectives of the EU in both countries tend to correspond to a great extent: the achievement of the commercial parity treatment of EU for its exporters vis-à-vis US’ exporters. Third, the overall political influence of the EU in the countries might thus be not only limited, but also fairly comparable. The theoretical structure and the empirical work highlight interesting indications. First, in terms of Power, neither the EU trade power, nor the conclusion of trade agreements is sufficient for the EU to exert, by default, a political influence in the countries considered. Second, in terms of Policy, during Peter Mandelson’s tenure as EC Trade Commissioner, the Union downsized the normative and political ambition of its external trade action in respect to the past, focusing on the achievement of commercial-parity objectives vis-à-vis other major global actors (i. e. a defensive trade strategy in relation to that of the US). Finally, in terms of Influence, both cases indicate that the EU has still a limited capacity to exert a political influence via its trade policy in nonneighbouring countries. Four main reasons help to explain this: 1) Internal institutional constraints within the EU; 2) The bilateral level of trade negotiation; 3) The weakness of EU’s Common Foreign and Security Policy and of its Common Security and Defence Policy; 4) The defensive rather than proactive global projection of the EU. The Thesis concludes that although the EU foreign economic policy can be a means to address the capability-expectations gap that affects the EU as an international actor, there is still ample scope to improve the EU political influence through trade in countries beyond the neighbourhood area in economic, political and/or normative terms...|$|E
40|$|The {{principal}} {{aim of the}} Lisbon Treaty is to address the pre-Lisbon concerns about the coherence of EU action. In this regard, coherence is the simple litmus test for <b>EU</b> <b>external</b> action in the post-Lisbon era. This thesis investigates the coherence of <b>EU</b> <b>external</b> action towards Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) in the post-Lisbon era {{in light of the}} requirement of coherence in <b>EU</b> <b>external</b> relations law and the introduction of the HR/VP and the EEAS in her service with the aim of enhancing coherence in <b>EU</b> <b>external</b> action. The principle of coherence governs the interaction between various policy strands of <b>EU</b> <b>external</b> action (horizontal coherence). The importance of coherence is linked to visibility and efficiency based on the effective use of EU resources, {{as well as to the}} credibility of the Union. This thesis concentrates on coherence in the interaction between EU policies towards SSA using the key EU policies towards the region namely development policy, trade policy, the CFSP and the CSDP. The regional context facilitates the analysis of the different strands of external action policies where, despite of or perhaps due to the Treaty of Lisbon, the different instruments of EU foreign policy and lines of competence demarcation between their institutions are still mired in complexity. Although the focus is on coherence, the specialised regional focus of the thesis also facilitates a broader understanding of the nuances in the implementation of <b>EU</b> <b>external</b> relations law and <b>EU</b> <b>external</b> policies in different contexts especially in the post-Lisbon era. Using Mali as a case study, the thesis submits that while it can be argued that policy coherence for development (which is a key requirement in <b>EU</b> <b>external</b> action towards SSA) cannot be certainly determined, Mali clearly illustrates incoherence vis-à-vis synergy in the sequencing of available policy options in <b>EU</b> <b>external</b> action towards SSA. The thesis also discussed the limits and prospects of coherence in <b>EU</b> <b>external</b> action despite the changes made at Lisbon...|$|R
40|$|Rule of law, whose core is „the {{access to}} an {{independent}} judiciary and judicial review”, fulfills in <b>EU</b> <b>external</b> policy two functions. Firstly, according to the art.   21 of TEU, all <b>EU</b> <b>external</b> actions have to be subdued {{to the rule of}} law. Secondly, promoting and consolidating the rule of law is one the objectives of <b>EU</b> <b>external</b> action. In most constitutional systems, a wide margin of appreciation is left as regards to foreign policy and judicial review is considerably limited. In case of EU, the Court’s jurisdiction over <b>EU</b> <b>external</b> policy is differentiated and reflects the old pillar structure. The question which arises here is whether it can be accommodated with the disposition of the art.   2 of TEU, which states that the European Union which is a single legal entity „is founded on the value of rule of law”, and with the principle of <b>EU</b> <b>external</b> policy coherence...|$|R
