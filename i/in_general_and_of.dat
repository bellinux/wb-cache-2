He and his fellow-travellers extolled {{the natural beauty of}} the basalt columns <b>in</b> <b>general</b> <b>and</b> <b>of</b> the island's main sea cavern, which Banks renamed 'Fingal's Cave'. Their visit was followed by those of many other prominent personalities throughout the next two centuries, including Queen Victoria and Felix Mendelssohn. The latter's Hebrides Overture brought further fame to the island, which was by then uninhabited. It is now in the care of the National Trust for Scotland.|$|E

25|$|The {{treatise}} {{is divided}} into 14 chapters, and this division dates from the 13th century at the latest, since even Mordecai ben Hillel cites it by chapters (Mordekai on M.

The tractate contains almost complete instructions as {{to the treatment of}} the dying and the dead, from the commencement of the death-agony to the arrangement of the grave which receives the remains. Numerous examples from current practice are cited. A large number of haggadot also are included.

25|$|The responsa of the epoch {{came from}} various countries, and from schools having {{different}} tendencies, thus showing {{the position and}} the type of spiritual life <b>in</b> <b>general</b> <b>and</b> <b>of</b> Talmudic learning in particular, since all these factors prevailed in the different countries at the time. Especially noteworthy is the divergence between the French and the Spanish school in the twelfth century, the second half of this period. For the most part the rulings of this period receive their basis or their confirmation from a passage in the Talmud, and in this motivation the difference between the French and the Spanish exegesis of the Talmud is clearly shown. The Spanish school was the more logical, and strove for brevity and lucidity in the deduction of its rulings from the Talmud, while the French school was more dialectic, and frequently gave full play to casuistry at the expense of clearness.|$|E

[...] Miller notes, [...] "Not only did many of the lyrics not rhyme, {{but many of the}} songs didn't really have endings, just a slowing down and stopping, so the audience didn't know when to applaud....

However, by backing down {{in the face of a}} strong US declaration of a strong interpretation of the Monroe Doctrine, Britain tacitly accepted the Doctrine, and the crisis thus provided a basis for the expansion of US interventionism in the Americas. Leading British historian Robert Arthur Humphreys later called the crisis [...] "one of the most momentous episodes in the history of Anglo-American relations <b>in</b> <b>general</b> <b>and</b> <b>of</b> Anglo-American rivalries in Latin America in particular." ...|$|E

500|$|Koht {{spoke of}} {{language}} in a social context <b>in</b> <b>general</b> <b>and</b> <b>of</b> the class struggle in particular. He eventually used the Labour Party {{as a vehicle for}} his language activism, especially after being asked by the party to write Arbeidarreising og målspørsmål in 1921. In it, he synthesised the class struggle and language struggle in Norway, and because he was an integrationist he wanted a popular gathering around one written language. Koht became a member of Rettskrivingsnemnda in 1934, and in 1936 the Labour Party agreed that a language reform should be carried out, moving the two language forms Bokmål and Nynorsk closer to one another. The language reforms took place in 1938 and promoted the Samnorsk ideal. The reforms were reversed in 1941 under Nazi rule; the original changes were reinstated {{after the end of the}} occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany. According to historian Kåre Lunden, Koht was much hated by many because of his language reforms, which were routinely perceived as attacks and degradations on their preferred language. His ideals were dubbed [...] "det kohtske knot", i.e. [...] "the Kohtian mishmash". For his own part, Koht often used spellings that contrasted with both Nynorsk and Bokmål. The definite article, which is formally the suffix [...] "-et", was substituted with the suffix [...] "-e", such as in the titles of his publications Det vitskapelege grunnlage for målstræve and Sosialdemokratie.|$|E
