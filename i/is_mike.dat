5000|$|This is in {{contrast}} to an argument like [...] "Fred <b>is</b> <b>Mike's</b> brother's son. Therefore Fred <b>is</b> <b>Mike's</b> nephew." [...] Since this argument depends on the meanings of the words [...] "brother", [...] "son", and [...] "nephew", the statement [...] "Fred <b>is</b> <b>Mike's</b> nephew" [...] <b>is</b> a so-called material consequence of [...] "Fred <b>is</b> <b>Mike's</b> brother's son," [...] not a formal consequence. A formal consequence must be true in all cases, however this is an incomplete definition of formal consequence, since even the argument [...] " [...] is 's brother's son, therefore [...] is 's nephew" [...] is valid in all cases, but is not a formal argument.|$|R
