50|$|More {{research}} {{is being done}} on <b>in-vitro</b> <b>meat,</b> and although the production of <b>in-vitro</b> <b>meat</b> does not require techniques of genetic engineering, there is discussion among researchers about utilizing such techniques {{to improve the quality}} and sustainability of <b>in-vitro</b> <b>meat.</b> Fortifying <b>in-vitro</b> <b>meat</b> with nutrients such as beneficial fatty acids is one improvement that can be facilitated through genetic modification. The same improvement can be made without genetic modification, by manipulating the conditions of the culture medium. Genetic modification may also {{play a role in the}} proliferation of muscle cells. The introduction of myogenic regulatory factors, growth factors, or other gene products into muscle cells may increase production past the capacity of conventional meat.|$|E
50|$|Techniques {{of genetic}} engineering, such as insertion, deletion, silencing, activation, or {{mutation}} of a gene, {{are not required}} to produce <b>in-vitro</b> <b>meat.</b> Furthermore, <b>in-vitro</b> <b>meat</b> is composed of a tissue or collection of tissues, not an organism. Therefore, it is not a GMO (Genetically Modified Organism). Since in-vitro meats are simply cells grown in a controlled, artificial environment, some have commented that cultured meat more closely resembles hydroponic vegetables, rather than GMO vegetables.|$|E

Ehrenreich Prize for Healthcare Ethics Research of the International Association of Bioethics and the Pacific Center for Health Policy and Ethics at the University of Southern California {{for the paper}} 'UK Legislation on Embryo Research, Justified or Not?', presented at the 7th World Congress of Bioethics, Sydney, November 2004. He is an Associate Editor for the Journal of Bioethical Inquiry. He is also an expert for 'Bioethics Beyond Borders', The Division of Ethics of Science and Technology, Sector for Social and Human Sciences, UNESCO. In 2014 Deckers was awarded a 'Society and Ethics' grant from the Wellcome Trust to convene a conference on 'An ethical discussion of <b>in-vitro</b> <b>meat</b> {{and the production of}} flesh from animals with enhanced properties.' ...|$|E
40|$|The <b>in-vitro</b> <b>meat</b> (IVM) {{research}} field remains small {{with perhaps}} 50 or so scientists active globally. These scientists {{are in the}} Netherlands, the US, the UK, Sweden, Israel and Norway, with some interest expressed in Denmark and {{by a group of}} bioreactor engineers in Portugal. The main groups involved in supporting this innovation domain are: New Harvest, a US based pro-IVM campaign group that raises funds through donations for small scale research work, discusses IVM in the media and organises conference panels; the <b>In-Vitro</b> <b>Meat</b> Consortium, established by Dutch and Norwegian scientists in 2008 as a networking device with presence at conferences, although, now with limited activity; the US animal rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA). The most high profile laboratories are those of Mark Post at Maastricht University and the New York based private company Modern Meadow, both of which have become relatively financially secure research sites over the last three years. The aim of the Epinet case study was to explore and interact with these epistemic communities / networks that have been developing, implementing, supporting and promoting IVM technologies. The study team consisted of expertise in sociotechnical evaluations, systems and uncertainty analysis, ethics and media studies. The team identified early on a small set of policy considerations around the issues of public funding and the social shaping of IVM. The {{question of whether or not}} IVM research should be publicly funded has had to be viewed in relation to how IVM technologies are represented, understood, shaped and reshaped and, accordingly, what sort of IVM activities should be funded. When the case study commenced in 2012, government policy makers had only twice chosen to fund IVM laboratory work, i. e., a section of the Dutch government interested in environmental issues and protein (2005 - 2009; 2010 - 2014), and NASA (2000). In addition to that, the European Science Foundation (ESF) funded a two day blue skies conference in Gothenburg, Sept. 2011. Other funders include PETA, New Harvest, and private donators...|$|E
40|$|In {{the faster}} pace {{of life and}} more {{consciousness}} of consumers about food safety and security, nanotechnology may be the important tool to augment the livestock products to fulfil the future demand. By the exploitation {{of the use of}} nanoparticles we can produce meat, milk and poultry products in much faster pace with high safety. Nanotechnology may serve the purpose of vegetarians who are willing to eat high proteinous food without killing the animals in form of <b>in-vitro</b> <b>meat,</b> cultured meat or laboratory grown meat. The nutritional quality along with quantity to fulfil the stomach of hungry peoples in the coming year’s nanotechnology may be the modern weapon. The transportability of livestock products with freshness is a great concern which may be meet out by the use of nanoparticles in form of flexible pouches, laminates and eatable coatings. Besides, this technology is having enormous scope in the livestock based industry...|$|E

40|$|EPINET was a EU funded project {{under the}} seventh {{framework}} program, coordinated by the Centre {{for the studies}} of the sciences and humanities, University of Bergen. The Joint Research was a partner at this project. The project looked critically at the great diversity of methods for assessing the impacts {{of science and technology}} on society and the environment. It explored new ways for bringing more of these methodologies into concert with each other, {{as well as with the}} concerns of innovators, policy makers and citizens. EPINET introduced the concept of epistemic networks as a way of conceptualizing complex developments within emerging fields of sociotechnical innovation. EPINET uses this concept to study four cases: 1. 	Wearable sensors for activity and physiological monitoring 2. 	Cognitive technical systems (mainly robotics) 3. 	Synthetic/ <b>in-vitro</b> <b>meat</b> 4. 	Smart grids for power supply The JRC deployed knowledge assessment methodologies as ways to explore the quality of policy proposals in a concerted and holistic manner, applying those methodologies to the wearable sensors and smart grids cases. In the case of wearable sensors, knowledge assessment methodologies sustain the following: (1) there is a need for connecting multiple visions and practice of different stakeholders: our social research showed the disconnects between policy makers, researchers, user communities and their visions of what WS should or can do; there is a growing DIY movement at all fronts of techno-science that will substitute the call for dialogue as institutions get more hermetic. (2) Policy making needs to account for sources of knowledge other than scientific, including by engaging and including more stakeholders, allowing the process of extended peer review to take place. Our research has shown that policy papers predominantly reflect research from industry and neglect other sources. (3) There is a need for more responsible and not so naïf big promises of healthcare revolution suggesting that electronic devices and services are key developments for improved care, while there are still high uncertainties of social and ethical nature. In the case of smart grids, the results have shown that on some levels, there are disconnects between different stakeholders, especially between policy makers and industry on one side, and citizens on the other. The application of knowledge assessment methodologies to assessing smart grids policy documents lead us to observe that: (1) there is strong alignment between the policy proposals and the aspirations from industry; we suggest that these alignments are made totally transparent in policy documents and not masked with grand justifications of sustainability, security and the like. (2) more technical studies carried out outside the industry realm and social studies should be used to support the claims made; a great deal of stakeholders’ knowledge is not being considered in the policy discussions or proposals. (3) there is poor involvement of the civil society in these discussions. As the smart grids model precludes an important involvement of citizens, the model should be open to more discussions. JRC.
