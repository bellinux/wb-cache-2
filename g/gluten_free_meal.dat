40|$|The {{topic of}} this {{bachelor}} thesis is gluten-free diet - reality in schools facilities. The {{goal of this}} work {{was to determine the}} number of school cafeterias in the Vysocina Region which provide gluten-free meals, to evaluate awareness of the canteen staff about preparation of the gluten-free diet and to describe the cooperation between the school cafeteria and family of the pupil with gluten-free diet. School meals are important to provide optimal intake of nutrition during the time the child spends in school, to establish proper eating habits and to better integrate the child into the group of its peers. Gluten-free diet is a necessary medical precaution especially for those with coeliac disease, in which case gluten can lead to villous atrophy, and for those with gluten allergy for whom gluten intake can cause anaphylactic shock. Adherence to the gluten-free diet is recommended also to those with non-coeliac gluten sensitivity diagnosis, although gluten causes only short-term complications, usually intestinal. The method of quantitative and qualitative research was used to make this thesis. The research sample consisted of 8 school cafeterias from the Vysocina Region which provide gluten-free meal to their pupils. Awareness about gluten-free diet principles of the managers of the cafeterias or of the cooks responsible for preparation of gluten-free meal was determined by means of semi-structured interviews. The calculation of the two-day menu of each cafeteria by means of the Nutriservis Profesional program was also part of this thesis. The results were compared with the recommended daily intake of energy, proteins, fat, and saccharides for pupils of elementary and secondary schools. The results of the quantitative research show that gluten-free diet is provided by {{only a small percentage of}} school cafeterias in the Vysocina Region. The qualitative research prove sufficient awareness of the cooks about gluten-free diet, with awareness of those cooks directly responsible for preparation of gluten free meals being at much higher level. It was also determined that the cooperation with parents of pupils with gluten-free diet is a usually one time occasion limited to an arrangement of nonperishable <b>gluten</b> <b>free</b> <b>meal</b> packages...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{consumption}} of <b>gluten</b> <b>free</b> foods is increasing in today’s society and consumers are demanding more from their <b>gluten</b> <b>free</b> products. Consumers {{are also looking}} for local alternatives to conventionally produced foods. This study compares the sensory aspects of industrially processed <b>gluten</b> <b>free</b> bread and locally produced, artisanal <b>gluten</b> <b>free</b> bread. Three breads were purchased from grocery stores and three from local bakeries. Global Napping® and ultra flash profiling were used to identify the overall {{differences between the two}} different categories of <b>gluten</b> <b>free</b> breads. Partial Napping® and ultra flash profiling were also used to determine if there were any differences between flavor and texture of the breads. Twelve panelists, who regularly consume bread, evaluated all six of the bread samples. Both methods indicated that there are many differences between the industrially processed and artisanal <b>gluten</b> <b>free</b> breads. The main differences being artisanal breads were associated with a wide array of flavors and a dry texture, while the industrially processed breads were found to be bland in flavor and moist. Overall, the artisanal <b>gluten</b> <b>free</b> breads were associated with more negative characteristics than that of industrially processed breads...|$|R

40|$|Commercially {{available}} <b>gluten</b> <b>free</b> breads are of {{low quality}} {{and have a}} rapid staling during storage, therefore {{attempts were made to}} obtain <b>gluten</b> <b>free</b> bread of improved structure properties and extended shelf-life. For this purpose laboratory obtained bean starch, both native or hydrothermally modified, was added to a <b>gluten</b> <b>free</b> formulation. Texture results revealed differences between the bottom-harder, and upper-softer part of fresh bread containing native bean starch. Modified starch reduced the hardness and diminish the differences between the upper and the bottom part of bread slice. Independently of storage duration breads were crumbly. Considerable decrease of the peak and final viscosity was observed with the increase of the storage time in sample with native bean starch, whereas the presence of modified starch induced the opposite tendency. The addition of native starch increased the tendency of amylopectine to retrograde during storage, whereas the presence of modified starch decreased the retrogradation enthalpy by 16 %. PRACTICAL APPLICATION <b>Gluten</b> <b>free</b> breads exhibite dry crumbling crumb, poor mouthfeel and flavour. To gain approval, <b>gluten</b> <b>free</b> bread need to resemble wheat flour bread.

40|$|Tolerable gluten {{thresholds}} in <b>gluten</b> <b>free</b> {{products have}} long been debated together with issues of cross contamination of <b>gluten</b> <b>free</b> cereals during the milling process.

It is estimated that daily consumption of gluten from contaminated <b>gluten</b> <b>free</b> foods is in the range of 5 to 50 mg. We believe evidence is mounting that it may be possible for some coeliac patients to tolerate gluten above the limits considered permissible at threshold levels. Conversely, it seems there is evidence that some patients might have a much lower threshold for gluten. Whatever would be the individual threshold, GFD may be of benefit to any symptomatic patients even those with milder enteropathy like microscopic enteritis...|$|R

A significant correlation was found between splenic size and duration of treatment; those patients who had been taking a <b>gluten</b> <b>free</b> diet for the longest time had the smallest spleens. Blood films from 11 of these 28 patients taken before treatment with a <b>gluten</b> <b>free</b> diet were compared with those taken between two and 15 years after the start of treatment. There was no tendency for the hyposplenic changes to regress. In the majority, the changes became more prominent despite strict adherence to the <b>gluten</b> <b>free</b> diet. These findings suggest that splenic atrophy in adult coeliac disease is not reversed by treatment with a <b>gluten</b> <b>free</b> diet and is unlikely {{to be related to the}} state of the jejunal mucosa or the duration of initial exposure to gluten...|$|R

[...] 26 diapositivasNowadays, {{the design}} of <b>gluten</b> <b>free</b> bakery products, namely bread, is still a challenge. Main {{difficulties}} rely {{on the lack of}} a viscoelastic matrix and in addition, <b>gluten</b> <b>free</b> cereals are unable to hold the carbon dioxide released during proofing. Enzymes have been very useful as processing aids or improvers in breadmaking of gluten containing products. Nevertheless, the development of <b>gluten</b> <b>free</b> products is facing differences in ingredients and processes in comparison with gluten making products. Therefore, the goals requested to enzymes in <b>gluten</b> <b>free</b> making are different. Particularly, enzymes have been applied either to create in situ networks (transglutaminase, glucose oxidase, phenol oxidase) or to modify protein functionality (proteases), but also carbohydrate hydrolases have been useful for improving bread technological quality and lately for changing nutritional quality.

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} a <b>gluten</b> <b>free</b> diet on bone mineral density in untreated adult patients with coeliac disease, 63 patients (17 - 79 years, 35 women) were examined at diagnosis and after one year taking a <b>gluten</b> <b>free</b> diet. Bone mineral density was measured in the forearm using single photo absorptiometry and in the lumbar spine, femoral neck, and trochanter using dual energy x ray absorptiometry. The values for each patient were compared with those of 25 healthy controls, matched for sex, age, and menopausal state. Before being given a <b>gluten</b> <b>free</b> diet bone mineral density in the total group was reduced at all sites (p < 0. 001). Age adjusted bone mineral density was inversely correlated with age. During the first year taking a <b>gluten</b> <b>free</b> diet bone mineral density increased at all sites (p < 0. 01). This was seen in patients of all ages and in patients who were without symptoms of malabsorption (weight loss or diarrhoea) before treatment. Low bone mineral density in patients with untreated coeliac disease increases rapidly when treatment with a <b>gluten</b> <b>free</b> diet is followed.
