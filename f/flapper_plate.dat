5000|$|The {{set point}} is {{transmitted}} through the <b>flapper</b> <b>plate</b> via the fulcrum {{to close the}} orifice and increase the chamber pressure. The feedback bellows resists and the output signal goes to the control valve which opens with increasing actuator pressure. As the flow increases, the process value bellows counteracts the set point bellows until equilibrium is reached. This will be a value below the set point, as there must always be an error to generate an output. The addition of an integral or [...] "reset" [...] bellows would remove this error.|$|E
5000|$|The {{operating}} principle {{makes use of}} the high gain effect when a [...] "flapper" [...] plate is placed a small distance from a small pressurised nozzle emitting a fluid. The example shown is pneumatic. At sub-millimetre distances a small movement of the <b>flapper</b> <b>plate</b> results in a large change in flow. The nozzle is fed from a chamber which is in turn fed by a restriction, so changes of flow result in changes of chamber pressure. The nozzle diameter must be larger than the restriction orifice in order to work. The high gain of the open loop mechanism can be linearised using a pressure feedback bellows on the flapper to create a force balance system with a linear output. The [...] "live" [...] zero of 0.2 bar or 3 psi is set by the bias spring which ensures that the device is working in its linear region.|$|E
