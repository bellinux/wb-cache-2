The effects of geometric {{changes on the}} amplification of first <b>mode</b> <b>instability</b> waves in an external supersonic boundary layer were investigated using numerical techniques. Boundary layer stability was analyzed at Mach 6 conditions similar to freestream conditions obtained in quiet ground test facilities so that results obtained in this study may be applied to future test article design to measure first <b>mode</b> <b>instability</b> waves. First, geometric parameters such as nose radius, cone half angle, vehicle length, and surface curvature for an axisymmetric cone geometry were examined separately to determine the individual effects on the first mode amplification. The DAKOTA optimization software package was then used to optimize the geometry to maximize the amplification of waves at first mode frequencies and to minimize the amplification of the waves at second mode frequencies, as computed by the 2 D STABL hypersonic boundary layer stability analysis tool. This was accomplished by allowing all geometric parameters in the sensitivity study to vary to produce a shape optimized to maximize the amplification of first <b>mode</b> <b>instability</b> waves while minimizing the amplification of second <b>mode</b> <b>instability</b> waves. During this process, boundary layer edge properties were recorded to investigate any correlations.

40|$|<b>Mode</b> <b>instabilities</b> have {{quickly become}} the most {{limiting}} effect {{when it comes to}} scaling the output average power of fiber laser systems. In consequence, there is an urgent need for effective strategies to mitigate it and, thus, to increase the power threshold at which it appears. Passive mitigation strategies can be classified into intrinsic, which are related to the fiber design, and extrinsic, which require a modification of the setup. In order to evaluate the impact of mitigation strategies, a means to calculate its power threshold and predict its behavior is required. In this paper we present a simple semi-analytic formula that is able to predict the changes of the <b>mode</b> <b>instability</b> threshold by analyzing the strength of the thermally-induced waveguide perturbations. Furthermore, we propose two passive mitigation strategies, one intrinsic and one extrinsic, that should lead to a significant increase of the power threshold of <b>mode</b> <b>instabilities...</b>|$|R
