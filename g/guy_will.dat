500|$|The Parents Television Council {{declared}} the episode worst {{show of the}} week, {{saying that it was}} significantly distasteful to involve The Simpsons because although that series is rated PG, Family Guy aims [...] "to reach the most extreme and outlandish conclusion of any joke, no matter how harsh the punchline may be. For subjecting viewers to jokes about rape, cartoon nudity, and disturbing acts of violence, Fox's Family <b>Guy</b> <b>will</b> remain the Worst TV Show of the Week".|$|E

500|$|After Obama {{secured the}} nomination, Bayh {{endorsed}} the Senator from Illinois and was {{mentioned as a}} possible running mate. He was included on the initial shortlist, which was then whittled down to four names: Bayh, Senator Joe Biden of Delaware, Governor Tim Kaine of Virginia and Governor Kathleen Sebelius of Kansas. On August 22, the eve of Obama's scheduled unveiling of his running mate, NBC News reported that Bayh and Kaine had been informed {{that they were not}} chosen. Obama opted instead for Biden. Obama's campaign manager David Plouffe later wrote in his book The Audacity to Win, which was published in November 2009, that Bayh had been a [...] "coin toss" [...] away from becoming Obama's running mate. Plouffe and David Axelrod had interviewed the finalists and Plouffe said that Bayh's answers were [...] "substantively close to perfect, if cautiously so." [...] He recalled {{that at the time of}} the interview he thought to himself, [...] "there's no way this <b>guy</b> <b>will</b> color outside the lines... Bayh's up side and down side are probably the closest spread of the three", compared to Biden, who could [...] "reach higher heights but could cause us real pain." [...] As Obama approached a decision, he told Plouffe [...] "it's a coin toss now between Bayh and Biden, but Kaine is still a distinct possibility." [...] On August 17, Obama told Axelrod simply, [...] "I've decided. It's Biden." ...|$|E
