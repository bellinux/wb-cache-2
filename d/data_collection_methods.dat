25|$|Among PEF's major {{political}} initiatives {{at this time}} were a cost-of-living increase for worker pensions. Benson also said he would seek improvements to job security; accrual (rather than use-or-lose) for overtime, sick leave, and vacation; eliminate tiers in the pension plan; seek an end to penalties for early retirement; new workplace safety protections; {{an increase in the}} size of the state workforce; and new restrictions on contracting out. The state replied that it would seek a four-year wage freeze. Angered by the state's response in a time of budget surpluses, Benson led PEF workers in an extensive lobbying effort. He also said PEF would seek a three-year rather than four-year contract, and 5 percent per year wage increases. Benson also replaced the union's top negotiator in order to adopt a more aggressive stand with the state. The state countered with a 3 percent per year salary increase over four years, coupled with new restrictions on time off for union business, higher health care costs, and new worktime reporting requirements (all of which PEF rejected). At a rally at the state capital on January 5, 2000, some 5,000 (state estimate) to 25,000 (PEF estimate) workers peacefully confronted 25 Albany police and 300 New York State troopers. PEF revised its wage offer to 12 percent over three years. Benson accused the state in March 2000 of dragging out the negotiations, and began a statewide radio advertising campaign against the governor. In April, PEF accepted a contract with the New York State Canal Corporation with a 3 percent per year salary hike. Days later, after another state union accepted a contract containing a 13.6 percent raise over four years, about 2,000 PEF members held a noisy rally outside the governor's offices demanding faster negotiations. Two weeks afterward, PEF agreed to end its advertising campaign and rallies as a spur to negotiations. A week later, Governor George Pataki agreed to wage and pension COLAs. A tentative agreement reached on June 10, 2000, incorporated a 13 percent wage hike over four years, rejected the new working time <b>data</b> <b>collection</b> <b>methods,</b> and imposed slight increases in member health care payments. Union members approved the contract by a vote of 33,899 to 2,876.|$|E

In addition, the effects of DW management strategies and of monitoring the behavior of workers on the actual generation of DW were analyzed. The results showed that when monitoring was implemented, the estimates of DW obtained from the DWGRs that were surveyed immediately before demolition and the actual quantities of DW reported by the demolition contractors had an error rate of 0. 63 % when the results were compared. Therefore, this study has shown that the proper <b>data</b> <b>collection</b> <b>method</b> (i. e., <b>data</b> were collected immediately before demolition) applied in this paper and monitoring on the demolition site {{have a significant impact on}} waste generation...|$|R
