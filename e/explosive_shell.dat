5|$|Neddermeyer {{discarded}} Serber and Tolman's initial {{concept of}} implosion as assembling {{a series of}} pieces in favor of one in which a hollow sphere was imploded by an <b>explosive</b> <b>shell.</b> He was assisted in this work by Hugh Bradner, Charles Critchfield, and John Streib. L. T. E. Thompson was brought in as a consultant, and discussed the problem with Neddermeyer in June 1943. Thompson was skeptical that an implosion could be made sufficiently symmetric. Oppenheimer arranged for Neddermeyer and Edwin McMillan to visit the National Defense Research Committee's Explosives Research Laboratory near the laboratories of the Bureau of Mines in Bruceton, Pennsylvania (a Pittsburgh suburb), where they spoke to George Kistiakowsky and his team. But Neddermeyer's efforts in July and August at imploding tubes to produce cylinders tended to produce objects that resembled rocks. Neddermeyer {{was the only person}} who believed that implosion was practical, and only his enthusiasm kept the project alive.|$|E
5|$|She was of one several Chinese ships {{caught in}} the harbour of Weihaiwei when the Japanese laid siege over the winter in early 1895 in the Battle of Weihaiwei. Huang refused to leave Jiyuan to seek {{treatment}} for injuries sustained during the battle; instead his wounds were dressed and he continued in his duties. He was then shot through the thigh, and continued to refuse treatment. A few minutes later {{he was killed by}} an <b>explosive</b> <b>shell</b> fired by a Japanese vessel. Admiral Ding Ruchang, in command of the fleet, surrendered on 12 February, and committing suicide shortly afterwards. In exchange for the surrender of all war material including the fleet, good behaviour was promised by the Japanese. Jiyuan was later commissioned into the Imperial Japanese Navy as Saien, the same Chinese character name.|$|E
25|$|The E-3 was {{replaced}} by the E-4 (with many airframes being upgraded to E-4 standards starting {{at the beginning of the}} Battle of Britain), which was different in some small details, most notably by using the modified 20mm MG-FF/M wing cannon and having improved head armour for the pilot. With the MG FF/M, it was possible to fire a new and improved type of <b>explosive</b> <b>shell,</b> called Minengeschoß (or 'mine-shell'), which was made using drawn steel (the same way brass cartridges are made) instead of being cast as was the usual practice. This resulted in a shell with a thin but strong wall, which had a larger cavity in which to pack a much larger explosive charge than was otherwise possible. The new shell required modifications to the MG FF's mechanism due to the different recoil characteristics, hence the MG FF/M designation.|$|E
50|$|The {{arrival of}} <b>explosive</b> <b>shells</b> in the 19th century led {{to yet another}} stage in the {{evolution}} of fortification. Star forts did not fare well against the effects of high explosive and the intricate arrangements of bastions, flanking batteries and the carefully constructed lines of fire for the defending cannon could be rapidly disrupted by <b>explosive</b> <b>shells.</b>|$|R

25|$|After the Continuation War {{ended with}} Moscow Armistice Allied Control Commission demanded that all coastal guns larger than 120mm in calibre east of Porkkala {{had to be}} removed and placed in storage. This {{included}} the coastal fortifications around Porkkala, fortifications of the capital Helsinki (18 152mm guns) and the Kotka-Hamina area forts (17 152/45 C guns). This restriction was lifted in 1947 after signing of the Paris Peace Treaty. 152/45 C guns were badly worn out after the war, and several had cracked or broken barrels. An investigation of the barrel failures concluded that the guns could not withstand the pressures created by the gunpowder used. This led to a development of a new light weight high <b>explosive</b> <b>shell</b> which could be fired by a half-charge of gunpowder. The worn out gun barrels were replaced with newly developed 50 caliber 152 50 Tampella barrels.|$|E
25|$|Cameron's generalship in New Zealand was, {{with minor}} exceptions, {{of a very}} high standard. In particular, he was a general who welcomed new ideas and {{technology}} and quickly put them into action. Cameron ordered prefabricated, steel-clad gunboats from Australia, which were assembled and finished in New Zealand. Both the gunboats and the army were equipped {{with the very latest}} Armstrong artillery, which were light, mobile, very accurate and fired an <b>explosive</b> <b>shell.</b> He appreciated the importance of irregular troops and allowed the creation of the Forest Rangers, who had their own unique organisation, uniform and lightweight arms including Bowie knives, revolvers and breech-loading carbines. In 1862, the telegram was first introduced to New Zealand, 18 years after its invention by Morse, and in 1863 a military telegraph was built from Auckland to Drury and later extended to the Waikato, allowing rapid communication between the front and Auckland. Cameron was quick to realise the importance of local knowledge and used Gorst, a missionary from the Waikato who spoke the Māori language, as a guide. He also used Waikato Māori who remained loyal to the crown as guides and to man a redoubt at Rangiriri once the Kingites had been defeated. A kūpapa Māori, familiar with the shallow waters of the Waikato Heads was used to guide the first gunboats through the Waikato River shoals. Cameron appreciated the importance of the surface coal seams at Huntly, which he used as fuel for his gunboats and supply steamers.|$|E
