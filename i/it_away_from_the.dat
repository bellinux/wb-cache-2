5|$|By the 11th century {{mainland}} southern Longobard and Byzantine {{powers were}} hiring Norman mercenaries, who were {{descendants of the}} Vikings; it was the Normans under Roger I who conquered Sicily, taking <b>it</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Arab Muslims. After taking Apulia and Calabria, Roger occupied Messina with an army of 700 knights. In 1068, Roger I of Sicily and his men defeated the Muslims at Misilmeri but the most crucial battle was the siege of Palermo, which led to Sicily being completely under Norman control by 1091.|$|E
5|$|In 1845 and 1846, a {{line from}} Malden to Salem via Saugus and Lynnfield was {{proposed}} but did not pass the legislature due to bitter objections from the Eastern. Instead, the Saugus Branch Railroad opened from Malden to Lynn Common on February 1, 1853. Affiliated with the Eastern's primary rival, the Boston and Maine Railroad (B), it did not initially have a connection with the Eastern. In 1855, the Eastern acquired the majority stock of the Saugus Branch Railroad to keep <b>it</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> B The connection to the B at Malden was severed, and it {{was connected to the}} Eastern at South Malden (Everett) and West Lynn. Lynn became the primary turnback point for the Saugus Branch after 1855, though a limited number of trains continued to Salem until World War I.|$|E
5|$|In July 1170, Becket and {{the king}} were {{reconciled}} {{and the king}} agreed that the archiepiscopal estates would be returned to Becket's control. But difficulties dragged on and Becket accused de Broc of stripping the estates of the recent harvest and storing <b>it</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> archbishop's control. In November, John of Salisbury was sent by Becket to England to inspect the estates prior to Becket's return from exile. John claimed that although de Broc had originally returned custody of the estates to Becket's officials, shortly before John's arrival de Broc had regained control of the estates and expelled Becket's officials. De Broc was also accused of seizing a cargo of the archbishop's wine and destroying the ship carrying it.|$|E

5|$|Jupiter's {{internal}} {{magnetic field}} prevents the solar wind, {{a stream of}} ionized particles emitted by the Sun, from interacting directly with its atmosphere, and instead diverts <b>it</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> planet, effectively creating a cavity in the solar wind flow, called a magnetosphere, composed of a plasma {{different from that of}} the solar wind. The Jovian (i.e. pertaining to Jupiter) magnetosphere is so large that the Sun and its visible corona would fit inside it with room to spare. If one could see it from Earth, it would appear five times larger than the full moon in the sky despite being nearly 1700 times farther away.|$|E
5|$|One night, a cargo {{aircraft}} {{from the}} kingdom of Tolmekia crashes in the Valley. Its sole passenger, Princess Lastelle of Pejite, pleads with Nausicaä to destroy the cargo and dies. The cargo is an embryo of a Giant Warrior, one of the lethal humanoid bioweapons that caused the Seven Days of Fire. Tolmekia, a military state, seized the embryo and Lastelle from Pejite, but their plane was attacked by mutant insects and crashed. One of the insects emerges wounded from the wreckage and seems poised to attack the villagers, but Nausicaä uses a small bullroarer to calm it and guides <b>it</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> village.|$|E
5|$|Towing two scows at {{the time}} of the collision, Stella Maris responded {{immediately}} to the fire, anchoring the barges and steaming back towards Pier 6. The tug's captain, Horatio H. Brannen, and his crew realized they were not equipped to fight the fire with their one small hose and quickly backed off from the burning Mont Blanc. They were approached by a whaler from HMS Highflyer and later a steam pinnace belonging to HMCS Niobe. Captain Brannen and Albert Mattison of Niobe agreed to secure a line to the French ship's stern so as to pull <b>it</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> pier to avoid setting it on fire. The five-inch (127-millimetre) hawser initially produced was deemed too small and orders for a ten-inch (254-millimetre) hawser came down. It was at this point that the blast occurred.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{holding a}} {{monopoly}} on cases in the Court of Common Pleas, Serjeants also took most of the business in the Court of King's Bench. Although required to make the Common Pleas their principal place of work, {{there is evidence of}} Serjeants who did not; one, Robert Mennell, worked entirely in the North of England after his creation in 1547 and was not known in Westminster, where the Common Pleas was located. This was also a time of great judicial success for the Serjeants; since only Serjeants could be appointed to the common law courts, many also sat in the Exchequer of Pleas, a court of equity. This period was not a time of success for the profession overall, however, despite the brisk business being done. The rise of central courts other than the Common Pleas allowed other lawyers to gain advocacy experience and work, drawing <b>it</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Serjeants, {{and at the same time}} the few Serjeants could not handle all the business in the Common Pleas, allowing the rise of barristers as dedicated advocates.|$|E
5|$|Handled {{the ball}} was {{formerly}} one of the methods of dismissing a batsman in the sport of cricket, but was integrated into the Law on obstructing the field when the Laws of Cricket were rewritten in 2017. It dictated that either batsman can be given out if they intentionally touch the ball with a hand that is not holding their bat. An exception was given if the batsman handled the ball to avoid injury. It was governed by Law 33 of the 2000 Edition of the Laws, and was a rare way for a batsman to be dismissed: {{in the history of}} cricket, there have been 61 instances in first-class matches and 5 occasions in List A games. In most cases this occurred when a batsman thought that {{the ball was}} going to hit their wicket, and knocked <b>it</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> stumps with their hand.|$|E
5|$|Intermittent deep {{convection}} {{continued to}} fire up, keeping the storm afloat {{for the next}} day and turning <b>it</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Azores. Danielle also changed direction and meandered slightly to the northwest, away from the Azores, due to very weak steering currents. After holding on as a minimal tropical storm, Danielle finally lost its deep convection due to high upper-level vertical shear and was downgraded to a tropical depression on the afternoon of August 20. The depression turned once again to the north, and continued to lose organization over cooler water. It degenerated into a remnant low on the afternoon of August 21 as the convection was completely sheared away from the center of Danielle. The remnant low remained in the open ocean, remaining devoid of any deep convection, until August 24 when it dissipated west-southwest of the Azores.|$|E

5|$|Napoleon {{knew that}} the French fleet could not defeat the Royal Navy in a {{head-to-head}} battle, so he planned to lure <b>it</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> English Channel through diversionary tactics. The main strategic idea involved the French Navy escaping from the British blockades of Toulon and Brest and threatening to attack the West Indies. In {{the face of this}} attack, it was hoped, the British would weaken their defense of the Western Approaches by sending ships to the Caribbean, allowing a combined Franco-Spanish fleet {{to take control of the}} channel long enough for French armies to cross and invade. However, the plan unraveled after the British victory at the Battle of Cape Finisterre in July 1805. French Admiral Villeneuve then retreated to Cádiz instead of linking up with French naval forces at Brest for an attack on the English Channel.|$|E
5|$|The {{lifeboats}} were lowered {{every few}} minutes on each side, {{but most of the}} boats were greatly under-filled. No.5 left with 41 aboard, No.3 had 32 aboard, No.8 left with 39 and No.1 left with just 12 out of a capacity of 40. The evacuation did not go smoothly and passengers suffered accidents and injuries as it progressed. One woman fell between lifeboat No.10 and the side of the ship but someone caught her by the ankle and hauled her back onto the promenade deck, where she made a second successful attempt at boarding. First-class passenger Annie Stengel broke several ribs when an overweight German-American doctor and his brother jumped into No.5, squashing her and knocking her unconscious. The lifeboats' descent was likewise risky. No.6 was nearly flooded during the descent by water discharging out of the ship's side, but successfully made <b>it</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> ship. No.3 came close to disaster when, for a time, one of the davits jammed, threatening to pitch the passengers out of the lifeboat and into the sea.|$|E
5|$|Thompson was a {{stand-up}} goaltender, rarely falling on both knees {{to stop a}} puck. He {{was one of the}} first NHL goaltenders to catch the puck with his hand to make a save, and helped popularize the technique. Using gloves that were smaller than those of other players, he was among the best puck-catchers of his era. He stood in the way of the puck with minimal padding, risking being struck when moving to catch it instead of simply deflecting <b>it</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> net. His signature technique, very often featured in photographs of him, involved dropping to one knee with the paddle of his goalstick covering the five-hole, and extending his glove to cover the left side of the net. Although he caught the puck with his glove, he did so without gloves resembling the modern blocker and trapper glove combination. Thompson was described by Johnny Bower, a former goaltender who was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame, as a good puckhandler, and one of the best of his time at forward passing. In the 1935–36 season, Thompson became the first goaltender to get an assist by intentionally passing the puck with his stick to a fellow player.|$|E

Elly, inside Deus, tries to move <b>it</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> planet and Fei, in his Xenogears, follows to save her, but both disappear in the rift. Krelian confronts them, telling Fei he only sought to end {{the pain and suffering}} that comes with human existence by reverting everything back to when it all began, when all was one, to ascend to the realm of God. Fei rejects Krelian's ideology with his love for Elly, but Krelian challenges Fei, telling him to prove this love that could make him independent of God, and calls forth Urobolus, a gigantic serpent-like incarnation of Miang. Xenogears appears and Fei uses it to defeat Urobolus. Krelian releases Elly and reveals to Fei that he had planned to become one with God along with Elly. During her time with Krelian, Elly had seen inside his heart and realized it was full of sadness and despair for all the atrocities he had committed. Despite everything, Elly says that Krelian truly loved people more than anyone else. Because no one will forgive his sins, he declines Fei's offer to return and ascends to a higher plain of existence along with the Wave Existence, telling Fei and Elly that he envies them. Fei and Elly then return to their planet along with Xenogears and reunite {{with the rest of the}} party.|$|E
5|$|Leading {{up to the}} 2010 Winter Olympics, {{to be held in}} Luongo's NHL {{hometown}} of Vancouver, Luongo and Brodeur were considered locks to be named to the national team heading into the summer orientation camp in August 2009 and speculation began as to who would be appointed the starting position. On December 31, 2009, Luongo was selected to Team Canada, along with Brodeur and Marc-André Fleury of the Pittsburgh Penguins as the three goaltenders. Luongo was given the start for the first game against Norway. He recorded his first Olympic shutout, making 15 saves in an 8–0 win to open the tournament. After Brodeur surrendered four goals in a 5–3 loss to the United States in their final preliminary game, Luongo replaced him as the starting goalie. He helped Canada to four consecutive single-elimination game wins against Germany, Russia, Slovakia and the United States to capture the gold medal. During the semifinal against Slovakia, Luongo made a game-saving stop against Canucks teammate Pavol Demitra with nine seconds to go in regulation. With Slovakia's goaltender pulled and down by a goal, the puck bounced to Demitra {{by the side of the}} net. Out of position, Luongo managed to get his glove on the puck, deflecting <b>it</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> net and preserving the win. In the subsequent gold medal game, Luongo made 34 saves in Canada's overtime win against the United States.|$|E
