[...] The report, {{mentioned in the}} preceding section, concluded that IT products are more expensive in Australia because of [...] "regional pricing strategies implemented by major vendors and copyright holders". 10 recommendations were made including the removal of <b>geo-blocking</b> restrictions and lifting restrictions on parallel importing. An amendment to the Competition and Consumer Act which would make contracts or terms of service which seek to enforce <b>geo-blocking</b> to become void was suggested as was {{the education of the}} Australian public on ways to circumvent <b>geo-blocking</b> mechanisms.

50|$|Due to {{contracts}} with U.S. {{cable and satellite}} carriers for Al Jazeera America the official Al Jazeera English live stream was <b>geo-blocked</b> in the United States on 18 August 2013. With the launch of Al Jazeera America, Al Jazeera English was excluded from all US services carrying or providing the channel, including YouTube, with Al Jazeera America material replacing all Al Jazeera English video content and live streams. Most Al Jazeera English video content was no longer officially available in the United States.|$|R
50|$|Al Jazeera Media Network {{originally}} planned {{to launch an}} internet-only TV channel in 2010 {{as part of its}} social media strategy but later became pre-occupied with the Arab Spring. Plans for an internet-only channel were re-launched upon the launch of Al Jazeera America when Al Jazeera Media Network had to <b>geo-block</b> most video from Al Jazeera English including the channel's live stream to satisfy concerns from cable and satellite providers in the United States. The move was met with dissatisfaction from both viewers and Al Jazeera English producers and hosts.|$|R

50|$|As {{with other}} forms of {{internet}} censorship, <b>geo-blocking</b> can be circumvented. When IP address-based <b>geo-blocking</b> is employed, virtual private network (VPN) and anonymizer services are often used to evade geo-blocks. A user can, for example, access a website using a U.S. IP address in order to access content or services that are not available from outside the country. Measurement-based techniques {{on the other hand}} could be harder to circumvent, especially when the measurements are performed on higher layers than the IP (e.g., the Application layer). Client Presence Verification (or CPV) is an example measurement-based technique that aims at verifying clients' geographic locations over the Internet.|$|E

50|$|More than 30 million Netflix {{subscribers}} use {{the service}} via a proxy server or {{virtual private network}} (VPN); doing so can make a user appear to be located in a country {{other than the one}} they are actually in, thus allowing them to use the service to access content that Netflix cannot offer in their region, due to geographical licensing restrictions. It is unclear whether or not accessing <b>geo-blocked</b> content via VPN violates local copyright laws, but content providers and other broadcasters have asserted that it is illegal because it infringes local rights to content that may have been sold to a competitor. GlobalWebIndex showed about 20 million of such VPN users came from China alone. As of November 2013, Canadian Netflix offered 3,600 titles compared to the U.S. service which had more than 10,000 which results in Canadians using VPNs so they can access the larger U.S. content selection.|$|R

He wore four jumpers at different stages during the show. 120,000 people applied for audience tickets for the show with only 200 tickets being made available. For the 2nd year running, TV3 showed a rival version of the toy show. This time called the Christmas Toy Show and shown a week before the actual Toy Show to avoid clashing with it. The show was streamed live worldwide on the RTÉ Player, where anyone anywhere in the world could watch the show as it was not <b>geo-blocked.</b> The show had a Chitty Chitty Bang Bang theme.The show featured a record number of children, 269 performers and toy testers. 200 toys were featured and more than 300 were used for the set design.|$|R
50|$|<b>Geo-blocking</b> or geoblocking {{is a form}} of {{technological}} protection measure where access to Internet content is restricted based upon the user's geographical location. In a <b>geo-blocking</b> scheme, the user's location is calculated using geolocation techniques, such as checking the user's IP address against a blacklist or whitelist; the result of this check is used to determine whether the system will approve or deny access to the content. The term is most commonly associated with its use to restrict access to premium multimedia content on the internet, such as films and television shows, primarily for copyright and licensing reasons. There are other uses for geoblocking, such as blocking malicious traffic or to enforce price discrimination, location-aware authentication, fraud prevention, and online gambling (where gambling laws vary by region).|$|E

The 2013 toy show featured a record breaking 237 toys. Over 231 performers and demonstrators took to the stage, with 34 of them performing a special opening number from Mary Poppins. The opening song on the show was Chim Chim Cher-ee and featured Ryan Tubridy dancing. In advance, a week before the show, Tubridy received a letter from a young boy from County Cavan named Fergal Smith, who begged to co-host the show with him. Tubridy at first rejected the letter but that same week, he changed his mind and called him live on air and agreed to let him host. Fergal later appeared on the show wearing a similar jumper and also helped Tubridy to introduce youngters who demonstrated ride on toys.A rival version of the toy show was shown on TV3 on the same day at the earlier times of 10.00am and 8:00pm called Showpal Christmas Toys, the 30-minute programme was presented by Alan Hughes.Robbie Keane was a guest on the show when he surprised a young fan whilst he was playing a game of FIFA 14.Bosco also made an appearance on the show.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} what effects, if any, the Elementary Science Study has on selected science skills of Educable Mentally Retarded students. The science skills chosen were observing, inferring, and communicating across four educational levels [...] primary, intermediate, junior high, and senior high EM students [...] of the Northwest Indiana Special Education Cooperative. This Cooperative consists of ten school corporations: Highland, Griffith, hake Ridge, Fast Gary, Hobart Township, Hobart, Ross Township, Hanover Community, Crown Points, and Tri-Creek. These corporations have joined together to provide comprehensive programming in special education. The data were collected from 307 EM students (chronological ages 6 - 19 years) taught by twenty-six teachers who participated in the study. Two experimental groups were used. One, labeled the Perceptual Group, consisted of nine teachers and their students using six FBS units comprised of Tangrams, Mirror Cards, Pattern Blocks, Attribute Games, <b>Geo-Blocks,</b> and Tracks. A second experimental group, labeled the Psychomotor Group, consisted of nine teachers and their students using six FSS units comprised of Sink or Float, Mystery Powders, Ice Cubes, Clay Boats, Primary Balancing, and Batteries and Bulbs. A third group, which served as the control, consisted of eight teachers and their students. The Illinois Test of Psycholinguistic Abilities Verbal Expression Sub-Test was modified by this researcher and used as the evaluation instrument. The science skill of communicating was determined by the regular ITPA score while the science skills of observing and inferring were determined by the modified ITPA. Eight school psychologists administered and scored the instrument. Multivariate and Univariate Analyses of Covariance were used for the statistical analyses. General and specific findings were noted for each educational level. There were statistically significant differences between the experimentals and controls in both multivariate and univariate analyses of the data. Both perceptual ESS units and psychomotor ES S units were found to improve at least one of the three science skills in some educational levels. There was an increase in the frequency of mean verbal expression scores and the frequency of mean observations made by students. There was a corresponding decrease in the mean frequency of inferences made by students from primary through senior high. In combining all educational levels (primary, intermediate, junior high, and senior high) the Experimental Group displayed a significantly higher frequency in mean verbal expression and mean observation scores. There was no significant difference between the Experimental and Control Groups in the mean frequency of inferences. In general, MM students exposed to ESS units demonstrated a higher level of verbal ability. Thesis (D. Ed. ...|$|R
50|$|The {{legality}} of circumventing <b>geo-blocking</b> to access foreign video services under local copyright laws is unclear and varies by country. Members {{of the entertainment}} industry (including broadcasters and studios) have contended {{that the use of}} VPNs and similar services to evade <b>geo-blocking</b> by online video services is a violation of copyright laws, as the foreign service does not hold the rights to make their content available in the user's country—thus infringing and undermining the rights held by a local rightsholder. Accessing online video services from outside the country in which they operate is typically considered a violation of their respective terms of use; some services have implemented measures to block VPN users, despite there being legitimate uses for such proxy services, under the assumption that they are using them to evade geographic filtering.|$|E

50|$|Internet Protocol (IP) address blocking: Access to {{a certain}} IP address is denied. If the target Web site is hosted in a shared hosting server, all {{websites}} on the same server will be blocked. This affects IP-based protocols such as HTTP, FTP and POP. A typical circumvention method is to find proxies that {{have access to the}} target websites, but proxies may be jammed or blocked, and some Web sites, such as Wikipedia (when editing), also block proxies. Some large websites such as Google have allocated additional IP addresses to circumvent the block, but later the block was extended to cover the new addresses.

5000|$|In April 2015, a {{group of}} media {{companies}} in New Zealand, including MediaWorks, Spark, Sky Network Television, and TVNZ, jointly sent cease and desist notices to several ISPs offering VPN services {{for the purpose of}} evading <b>geo-blocking,</b> demanding that they pledge to discontinue the operation of these services by April 15, 2015, and to inform their customers that such services are [...] "unlawful". The companies accused the ISPs of facilitating copyright infringement by violating their exclusive territorial rights to content in the country, and misrepresenting the alleged legality of the services in promotional material. In particular, Spark argued that the use of VPNs to access foreign video on demand services was cannibalizing its own domestic service Lightbox. At least two smaller providers (Lightwire Limited and Unlimited Internet) announced that they would pull their VPN services in response to the legal concerns. However, CallPlus, the parent company of Slingshot and Orcon, objected to the claims, arguing that the Global Mode service was [...] "completely legal", and accused the broadcasters of displaying protectionism. Later that month, it was reported that the broadcasters planned to go forward with legal action against CallPlus. On 24 June 2015, it was announced that the media companies reached an out-of-court settlement, in which ByPass Network Services, who operates the service, would discontinue it effective 1 September 2015.|$|E
5000|$|On April 9, 2015, Bell Media's {{president}} Kevin Crull {{stepped down}} {{and was replaced}} by Mary Ann Turcke, the subsidiary's former head of media sales. The move came following allegations reported by The Globe and Mail that, after the CRTC's March 2015 decision to mandate that pay television providers offer a la carte packages, Crull ordered all Bell-owned news properties, including CTV News, not to air any interviews with or footage depicting CRTC head Jean-Pierre Blais during reports regarding the decision. Although the CTV News Channel program Power Play and a report aired on local evening newscasts complied with Crull's order, the CTV National News that night defied Crull's demand by airing a story on the changes that included remarks by Blais. CTV News president Wendy Freeman, Ottawa bureau chief Robert Fife, and the program's anchor Lisa LaFlamme felt that the inclusion of remarks by Blais were necessary {{due to the nature of}} the story.

40|$|This study {{assesses the}} {{relationship}} between <b>geo-blocking</b> and the internal market. <b>Geo-blocking</b> refers to technical measures, which restrict access to copyright protected audiovisual content from outside of the licensed territory. Territorial nature of copyright and agreements between right holders and service providers are main reasons behind <b>geo-blocking.</b> Digital Single Market Strategy and related competition law investigation aim to abolish <b>geo-blocking</b> practices. Aim {{of this study is}} to assess whether or not such agreements infringe competition law of the EU. In order to answer the question, {{the relationship between}} free movement of services and <b>geo-blocking</b> is also examined. Relevant case law, including Coditel cases and Murphy, is profoundly scrutinized. A legal test based on substantial and geographical dimensions of copyright is used to assess compatibility. Relevancy of underlying regulatory context is one of the main findings of the study. The study concludes that <b>geo-blocking</b> agreements do not infringe competition law as long as copyright is regulated by the “country of destination” approach. However, if copyright is regulated by the “country of origin” principle, there is a breach of competition law in principle. In that case, only economic context can justify <b>geo-blocking.</b> The study maintains that there is a chance that economic characteristics of audiovisual products can justify such restrictions...|$|E

40|$|From the {{perspective}} of the ‘Digital Single Market’ <b>geo-blocking</b> widely frustrates the increasingly high expectations of European citizens to access culture, services and entertainment on a EU-wide basis. <b>Geo-blocking</b> also makes hugely demanded content such as films and TV series inaccessible in a legitimate way, with a consequential rise in appeal of online piracy. This article identifies the barriers raised by such technical restrictions and explains why the licensing of copyright works on a country-by-country basis may still be justified, on objective grounds. It also argues that the current emphasis on <b>geo-blocking</b> solely in relation to copyright is misleading since copyright is not the only reason why the exploitation of creative works (in particular films) is still rigidly territorial in Europe. On the one hand, the need to adapt and make content accessible to Europe’s culturally and linguistically diverse audiences may justify a separate exploitation on a territorial basis. On the other hand, factors such as a persisting digital divide, a different availability of bandwidth across the EU and {{a significant difference in the}} purchasing power of European consumers have a partitioning effect of the Single Market. This article takes the view that a progressive reduction of <b>geo-blocking</b> measures and an effective Europeanization of markets for digital content would urgently require a clarification of the conditions under which territorial restrictions may still be considered as a necessary tool to preserve cultural diversity and the remuneration of opportunities (e. g. advertising) associated with a particular territory. In all other cases EU policy makers should feel free to let the logic of the Digital Single Market progressively prevail...|$|E
