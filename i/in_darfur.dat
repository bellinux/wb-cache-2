Bush enacted economic sanctions against Sudan to pressure the government to end the genocide <b>in</b> <b>Darfur,</b> Biden momentarily shifted focus from Iraq to the crisis <b>in</b> <b>Darfur.</b> He released a statement {{on the campaign trail}} that expressed his belief that Bush was right to enact the sanctions. However, Biden argued that it was not enough, calling for a No-Fly Zone over the region and a possible commitment of United States forces to the nation.|$|E

5|$|Horses {{have been}} used in warfare for most of {{recorded}} history. The first archaeological evidence of horses used in warfare dates to between 4000 and 3000 BC, and the use of horses in warfare was widespread {{by the end of the}} Bronze Age. Although mechanization has largely replaced the horse as a weapon of war, horses are still seen today in limited military uses, mostly for ceremonial purposes, or for reconnaissance and transport activities in areas of rough terrain where motorized vehicles are ineffective. Horses {{have been used}} in the 21st century by the Janjaweed militias in the War <b>in</b> <b>Darfur.</b>|$|E
5|$|Boustead was {{promoted}} {{to the rank of}} captain on 1 March 1927 and served as a General Staff Officer, Third Grade from 22 July 1929 to 26 November 1930.

5|$|For example, Sudan’s {{famine in}} the 1980s was {{completely}} intentional, {{and was only}} a pawn for a varied collection of different elites to improve their political and economic statuses. These political parties weren’t the only beneficiaries, though. Merchants were also known to hoard grain and buy livestock at inappropriately low prices when the famines shifted the terms of trade. Western Sudanese merchants during the famine of 1987 were described as heartless because they refused to sell grain to needy villages <b>in</b> <b>Darfur</b> at reasonable prices. Ergo, the Sudanese Famine was another example of food power in which food was and used as a policy, and which completely ignored {{the needs of the}} people and fostered the political and power-hungry intentions of opposite warring forces in the country.|$|E

5|$|In 2006 Déby won a third mandate in {{elections}} {{that the opposition}} boycotted. Ethnic violence in eastern Chad has increased; the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has warned that a genocide like that <b>in</b> <b>Darfur</b> may yet occur in Chad. In 2006 and in 2008 rebel forces have attempted to take the capital by force, but have on both occasions failed. An agreement {{for the restoration of}} harmony between Chad and Sudan, signed 15 January 2010, marked the end of a five-year war. The fix in relations led to the Chadian rebels from Sudan returning home, the opening of the border between the two countries after seven years of closure, and the deployment of a joint force to secure the border. In May 2013, security forces in Chad foiled a coup against President Idriss Deby that had been in preparation for several months.|$|E
