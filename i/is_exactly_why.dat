The police, who have been watching Green's house, intervene and take Tom home before anyone is harmed. Black apologizes for keeping information from Tom, but warns him that his outburst <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>why</b> he did so. Watts has meanwhile tracked forensic evidence from the abandoned car to a cabin in the woods; blood found there matches both Green and Helen, and a ring is discovered which is identified as Helen's wedding ring.|$|E
500|$|Sam Marx, {{writing for}} Comicosity, called The Fade Out the creators' [...] "most ambitious series yet" [...] and praised {{their ability to}} set a scene. Reviewing for Comic Book Resources, Greg McElhatton gave Brubaker credit for {{avoiding}} excessive exposition {{at the start of}} the story, but felt some of the characters seemed stereotypical. The first issue was placed on the Entertainment Weekly [...] "Must List". Chase Magnett of Comics Bulletin described the ending as [...] "an anti-climax with no big showdown, revelations, or death", but went on to say that the [...] "sense of disappointment <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>why</b> it's great". McElhatton agreed, saying a happy ending would have [...] "felt like a cheat", but that the [...] "central mystery [...] a proper amount of closure".|$|E
500|$|Destructoid noted her {{unconventional}} {{design in}} Heroes of the Storm {{was similar to}} her Overwatch design, writing that [...] "she has the same basic abilities, and even powers up her Heroic [...] just like an ultimate [...] – by dealing damage". A Heroic ability in Heroes of the Storm is a player-chosen ability, accessible to players once the hero reaches level 10. However, in Heroes of the Storm, players {{had no control over}} Tracer's Heroic ability, which was also unlocked immediately. Her core skillset is teleportation, [...] "which includes a quick blink strike in any direction and the 'Recall' mechanic that rewinds her back to the location she was at three seconds ago." [...] Chris Thursten of PC Gamer wrote that [...] "the fact that she literally runs circles around certain heroes, coupled with the notion that she defies the rules of the game, <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>why</b> [...] impressed by her design". Acknowledging that she can be an [...] "absolute terror to the enemy team," [...] Blizzard rolled out a nerfed version of the character on May 4, 2016, {{less than a month after}} her introduction into the game.|$|E

Now he'd wait again--dear Bid was thoroughly worth it.|$|R

6000|$|... but {{the truth}} is that woman always varies, and that <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>why</b> we always trust her. To correct every {{adventure}} and extravagance with its antidote in common-sense is not (as the moderns seem to think) to be in the position of a spy or a slave. It is to be in the position of Aristotle or (at the lowest) Herbert Spencer, to be a universal morality, a complete system of thought. The slave flatters; the complete moralist rebukes. It is, in short, to be a Trimmer in the true sense of that honorable term; which for some reason or other is always used in a sense exactly opposite to its own. It seems really to be supposed that a Trimmer means a cowardly person who always goes over to the stronger side. It really means a highly chivalrous person who always goes over to the weaker side; like one who trims a boat by sitting where there are few people seated. Woman is a trimmer; and it is a generous, dangerous and romantic trade.|$|E

His {{character}} was initially described as [...] "a handsome and masculine but sensitive therapist who loves his family but has hurt his wife."

2500|$|Flaum {{pointed to}} Schmuck's motion for a {{directed}} verdict after the prosecution finished its case. One of the defendant's arguments {{had been that}} the mailings were not only not necessary to the fraud, they were actually counterproductive to his scheme because they increased the chance that his crime would be discovered. The district judge had denied it as properly {{a question for the}} jury to decide, a decision Flaum called correct. But that denial, he continued, <b>was</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>why</b> the jury needed to be able to consider odometer tampering as a lesser included charge. [...] "Because this rational possibility existed based on the record assembled at trial, the defendant was entitled to a lesser instruction on odometer tampering." ...|$|R

Those who are {{faithful}} know only the trivial side of love: {{it is the}} faithless who know love's tragedies." [...] And Lord Henry struck a light on a dainty silver case, and began to smoke a cigarette with a self-conscious and satisfied air, {{as if he had}} summed up the world in a phrase. There was a rustle of chirruping sparrows in the green lacquer leaves of the ivy, and the blue cloud-shadows chased themselves across the grass like swallows. How pleasant it was in the garden! And how delightful other people's emotions were!--much more delightful than their ideas, it seemed to him. One's own soul, and the passions of one's friends--those were the fascinating things in life. He pictured to himself with silent amusement the tedious luncheon that he had missed by staying so long with Basil Hallward. Had he gone to his aunt's he would have been sure to have met Lord Goodbody there, and the whole conversation would have been about the feeding of the poor, and the necessity for model lodging-houses. Each class would have preached the importance of those virtues, for whose exercise there was no necessity in their own lives. The rich would have spoken on the value of thrift, and the idle grown eloquent over the dignity of labour. It was charming to have escaped all that! As he thought of his aunt, an idea seemed to strike him. He turned to Hallward, and said, [...] "My dear fellow, I have just remembered." ...|$|E
6000|$|Can {{anything}} be more absurd {{than the}} copy of The Echo which contains a notice {{of the performance of}} my play? It is edited by a gentleman who, having devoted his life to work of the Shaftesbury type, exposes social evils and clamors for their reform in every column except one; and that one is occupied by the declaration of the paper's kindly theatre critic, that the performance left him [...] "wondering what useful purpose the play was intended to serve." [...] The balance has to be redressed by the more fashionable papers, which usually combine capable art criticism with West-End solecism on politics and sociology. It is very noteworthy, however, on comparing the press explosion produced by Mrs Warren's Profession in 1902 with that produced by Widowers' Houses about ten years earlier, that whereas in 1892 the facts were frantically denied and the persons of the drama flouted as monsters of wickedness, in 1902 the facts are admitted and the characters recognized, though it is suggested that this <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>why</b> no gentleman should mention them in public. Only one writer has ventured to imply this time that the poverty mentioned by Mrs Warren has since been quietly relieved, and need not have been dragged back to the footlights. I compliment him on his splendid mendacity, in which he is unsupported, save by a little plea in a theatrical paper which is innocent enough to think that ten guineas a year with board and lodging is an impossibly low wage for a barmaid. It goes on to cite Mr Charles Booth as having testified that there are many laborers' wives who are happy and contented on eighteen shillings a week. But I can go further than that myself. I have seen an Oxford agricultural laborer's wife looking cheerful on eight shillings a week; but that does not console me for the fact that agriculture in England is a ruined industry. If poverty does not matter {{as long as it is}} contented, then crime does not matter as long as it is unscrupulous. The truth is that it is only then that it does matter most desperately. Many persons are more comfortable when they are dirty than when they are clean; but that does not recommend dirt as a national policy.|$|E

50|$|It <b>is</b> unclear <b>exactly</b> <b>why</b> {{and when}} the Vlach migrations into what is today Czech Republic and Slovakia occurred. The Vlachs, at first Romance-speaking and Orthodox Christian, were transhumant pastoralists {{originating}} in Transylvania.
