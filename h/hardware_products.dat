40|$|Abstract: In general, {{research}} on software development outsourcing, which implicitly assumes application software development, tends to ignore <b>hardware</b> <b>product</b> characteristics. However, in embedded software development, {{the skills and}} knowledge required of engineers can differ depending on <b>hardware</b> <b>product</b> characteristics. This study employs the data from an interview-based survey to identify the impact of <b>hardware</b> <b>product</b> characteristics on software development outsourcing. In the case of embedded software, engineers at companies that undertake outsourced work must possess not only knowledge of software developed by the outsourcer but also technical information and knowledge regarding <b>hardware</b> <b>product</b> characteristics that can only be acquired from the same client. This accumulation of firm-specific knowledge and information occurs on a continual basis, and is necessary for this type of outsourcing business. Thus, maintaining a low engineer turnover is important...|$|R

2500|$|An {{editorial}} {{article in}} The Verge in September 2016 by technology journalist Thomas Ricker explored {{some of the}} public's perceived lack of innovation at Apple in recent years, specifically stating that Samsung has [...] "matched and even surpassed Apple in terms of smartphone industrial design" [...] and citing the belief that Apple is incapable of producing another breakthrough moment in technology with its products. He goes on to write that the criticism focuses on individual pieces of hardware rather than the ecosystem as a whole, stating [...] "Yes, iteration is boring. But it's also how Apple does business. [...] It enters a new market and then refines and refines and continues refining until it yields a success". He acknowledges that people are wishing for the [...] "excitement of revolution", but argues that people want [...] "the comfort that comes with harmony". Furthermore, he writes that [...] "a device is only {{the starting point of}} an experience that will ultimately be ruled by the ecosystem in which it was spawned", referring to how decent <b>hardware</b> <b>products</b> can still fail without a proper ecosystem (specifically mentioning that Walkman didn't have an ecosystem to keep users from leaving once something better came along), but how Apple devices in different hardware segments are able to communicate and cooperate through the iCloud cloud service with features including Universal Clipboard (in which text copied on one device can be pasted on a different device) as well as inter-connected device functionality including Auto Unlock (in which an Apple Watch can unlock a Mac in close proximity). He argues that Apple's ecosystem is its greatest innovation.|$|E
