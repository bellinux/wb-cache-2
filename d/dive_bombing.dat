5|$|The {{concept of}} <b>dive</b> <b>bombing</b> became so popular among the {{leadership}} of the Luftwaffe that it became almost obligatory in new aircraft designs. Later bomber models like the Junkers Ju 88 and the Dornier Do 217 were equipped for <b>dive</b> <b>bombing.</b> The Heinkel He 177 strategic bomber was initially supposed to have <b>dive</b> <b>bombing</b> capabilities, a requirement that contributed to the failure of the design, with the requirement not rescinded until September 1942 by Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring.|$|E
5|$|The {{aircraft}} {{was capable of}} performing <b>dive</b> <b>bombing,</b> and could be fitted with a single bomb or depth charge on a hardpoint under each wing for the mission, or for anti-submarine warfare. Gun armament consisted of two M2 Browning machine guns, one mounted in a fixed position firing forwards through the propeller using synchronizer gear, while the other was in a flexible position in the observer's cockpit for rear defense.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1936, {{the ship}} was used to {{evaluate}} a dozen Aichi D1A dive bombers and dive-bombing tactics. She also embarked at that time 24 A4N1 fighters, plus four and eight spare aircraft respectively. In September, Ryūjō resumed her role as flagship of First Carrier Division, now commanded by Rear Admiral Saburō Satō. Her air group now consisted of a mixture of B3Y1 torpedo bombers, D1A1 dive bombers and A2N fighters, but her torpedo bombers were transferred after fleet maneuvers in October demonstrated effective <b>dive</b> <b>bombing</b> tactics. Captain Katsuo Abe assumed command of the ship on 16 November.|$|E
50|$|On 22 August {{the group}} {{attacked}} three Luftwaffe airfields near Laon. The 392d Squadron <b>dive</b> <b>bombed</b> and destroyed two hangars on one airfield but were jumped by twelve Focke-Wulf Fw 190s as they completed their attack. Eighteen Messerschmitt Me 109s and FW 190s engaged the 393d Squadron as it reformed from its <b>dive</b> <b>bomb</b> run. After bombing its target, the 394th Squadron turned {{to reinforce the}} 392d. The group claimed fourteen enemy aircraft against a loss of one Lightning.|$|R

50|$|PQ 12 {{arrived at}} Murmansk on 12 March. No ships were lost, though the escort {{suffered}} one whaler lost, Shera, capsized by ice buildup, and one destroyer, Oribi, damaged by pack ice. On 24 March the Lancaster Castle was <b>dive</b> <b>bombed</b> alongside the quay in Murmansk. Eight men were killed. It was towed out and moored in the river. The crew {{continued to live}} on board. A few days later it was <b>dive</b> <b>bombed</b> again and received five direct hits. There were no casualties but the crew moved to shore.|$|R
5|$|Loring AFB {{was named}} in 1954 for Major Charles J. Loring, Jr., USAF, a Medal of Honor {{recipient}} during the Korean War. During {{the morning of}} 22 November 1952, he led a flight of F-80 Shooting Stars on patrol over Kunwha. After beginning a <b>dive</b> <b>bombing</b> run and getting hit, he entered into a controlled dive and destroyed a Chinese gun emplacement on Sniper Ridge that was harassing United Nations troops. Limestone Air Force Base was renamed in his honor.|$|E
5|$|The {{course at}} SFTS {{typically}} {{consisted of two}} streams, intermediate and advanced, and included such techniques as instrument flying, night flying, advanced aerobatics, formation flying, <b>dive</b> <b>bombing,</b> and aerial gunnery. The total duration of training varied during the war as demand for aircrew fluctuated. Initially running for 16 weeks, the course was cut to 10 weeks (which included 75 hours flying time) in October 1940. A year later it was raised to 12 weeks (including 100 hours flying time), and again to 16 weeks two months later. It continued to increase after this, peaking at 28 weeks in June 1944.|$|E
5|$|No.457 Squadron's {{movement}} to Morotai was delayed until early 1945. The squadron's ground crew departed Darwin by sea on 18January and {{arrived on the}} island on 1February. The Spitfires departed Sattler on 6February and arrived at Morotai two days later. No.457 Squadron flew its first operations from Morotai on 10February. The squadron's main roles in this period were to conduct ground attack missions against Japanese camps and shipping as well as escorting other aircraft engaged in attacking these targets. This involved a heavy workload, and the squadron flew over 293 operational sorties between February {{and the end of}} April. From May No.457 Squadron's Spitfires began using <b>dive</b> <b>bombing</b> tactics as well as strafing targets with their guns.|$|E

5|$|Calais was {{virtually}} razed {{to the ground}} during World War II. In May 1940, it was a key objective of the invading German forces and became {{the scene of a}} last-ditch defence—the Siege of Calais—which diverted a sizable amount of German forces for several days immediately prior to the Battle of Dunkirk. 3,000 British and 800 French troops, assisted by Royal Navy warships, held out from 22 to 27 May 1940 against the 10th Panzer Division. The town was flattened by artillery and precision <b>dive</b> <b>bombing</b> and only 30 of the 3800-strong defending force were evacuated before the town fell. This may have helped Operation Dynamo, the evacuation of Allied forces at Dunkirk, as 10th Panzer would have been involved on the Dunkirk perimeter had it not been busy at Calais. Between 26 May and 4 June 1940, some 330,000 Allied troops escaped from the Germans at Dunkirk.|$|E
5|$|I./StG 77 were {{to strike}} at Thorney Island with 28 Ju 87s; 28 II./StG 77 were {{assigned}} to Ford; and 31 III./StG 77 Ju 87s were to destroy Poling radar station. A fourth unit, Sturzkampfgeschwader 3 (StG 3 or <b>Dive</b> <b>Bombing</b> Wing 3), sent 22 Ju 87s to attack Gosport. The dive-bombers were supported by 157 Bf 109s; 70 from JG 27; 32 from JG 53 acting as close escort; and 55 from JG 2 which was to sweep the Portsmouth area {{in advance of the}} main raid independently. The Ju 87s were based around Caen, too far away for the attacks. So in the morning the Stukas were moved into closer airfields around Cherbourg, right on the Channel coast. There, fuel tanks were filled, bombs loaded, and crews given a final briefing.|$|E
5|$|Nagatos {{presence}} at Yokosuka was {{revealed to the}} Allies by photographs taken during the 10July raid on the Tokyo area. On 16July Halsey and Vice Admiral Bernard Rawlings, the commander of TF37, met to plan raids on the Tokyo area. Halsey was determined to sink {{the remnants of the}} IJN, and placed a particularly strong emphasis on attacking Nagato as she had been Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto's flagship during the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941. Due to the battleship's position within a well defended harbor, the Third Fleet's planners assessed that aircraft which attempted the straight and level flight needed to launch torpedoes against her would suffer heavy losses, and so decided to use <b>dive</b> <b>bombing</b> tactics instead. As the landward side of the naval base was mountainous, the approaches which could be used by dive bombers were limited.|$|E
50|$|Terror was {{subjected}} to <b>dive</b> <b>bomb</b> attacks by German Junkers Ju 88 bombers on 22 February 1941 after leaving Benghazi. She was badly damaged by near misses and abandoned by her crew. Although taken under tow, she sank off Derna, Libya before reaching the Royal Navy's Mediterranean Fleet base at Alexandria, Egypt.|$|R
50|$|Common {{enemies of}} {{harriers}} are Australian magpies, masked lapwings which <b>dive</b> <b>bomb</b> and European starlings which mob individuals. They {{have been known}} to kill young kārearea and have also been heavily blamed and persecuted for killing chickens, pheasants and ducklings. Swamp harriers have been historically used for falconry in New Zealand; quarry is usually pukeko and young rabbits.|$|R
50|$|Walker's {{first solo}} record, Nevertheless, {{released}} in 1994, launching his solo career in Europe. David Prater produced four {{songs from the}} CD, the rest was produced by Walker or co-written and produced by Jonathan Cain. The CD was released on Empire Records in Europe and Japan, and reached the top-40 national sales charts in Scandinavia. Nevertheless, was again released in 2012 on <b>Dive</b> <b>Bomb</b> Records.|$|R
5|$|Reconnaissance by Junkers Ju 86 {{aircraft}} {{had identified}} the airfields as fighter bases. The high altitude and poor {{resolution of the}} photographs meant the aircraft on the ground could not be identified properly and the Germans mistakenly believed them to be fighter fields. In fact, none of the airfields belonged to Fighter Command. Gosport housed a torpedo development unit, Thorney Island housed No. 59 Squadron RAF and No. 235 Squadron RAF with Bristol Blenheims assigned to RAF Coastal Command. Ford was a naval air station and housed No. 829 Squadron Fleet Air Arm which was working up with Fairey Albacore aircraft at the time. These targets were given to Sturzkampfgeschwader 77 (StG 77 or <b>Dive</b> <b>Bombing</b> Wing 77). The Geschwader committed 109 Junkers Ju 87 Stuka dive-bombers to the raid. It was the largest concentration of Ju 87s to operate over Britain to date.|$|E
5|$|Thanks to {{the thick}} {{straight}} wing the Thunderjet rapidly reached its Mach 0.82 limitation at full throttle and low altitude. The aircraft had sufficient power to fly faster, but exceeding the Mach limit at low altitudes {{resulted in a}} violent pitch-up and structural failure causing the wings to break off. Above 15,000ft (4,600m), the F-84 could be flown faster but {{at the expense of}} severe buffeting. Fortunately, the airspeed was sufficiently easy to control to make safe <b>dive</b> <b>bombing</b> from 10,000ft (3,000m) possible. The top speed limitation proved troublesome against Soviet Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15s in Korea. Slower than the MiG, the F-84 was also unable to turn tightly with a maximum instantaneous-turn load of only 3Gs followed by rapid loss of airspeed. One F-84E pilot credited with two MiG kills achieved his second victory by intentionally flying his aircraft into pitch-up. The MiGs chasing him were unable to follow the violent maneuver and one crashed into the ground. Luckily for the F-84E pilot, the aircraft did not disintegrate but the airframe did suffer heavy warping. The F-84 was a stable gun platform and the computing gunsight aided in accurate gunnery and bombing. Pilots praised the aircraft for Republic's legendary ruggedness.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the rapid}} {{expansion}} of the Vengeance force, by late 1942 the RAAF was aware that the type was obsolete and other Allied air forces' experiences had demonstrated that <b>dive</b> <b>bombing</b> was an inefficient tactic. Combat experience in Europe showed that dedicated dive bombers were highly vulnerable to attack from fighter aircraft, especially when preparing to dive on targets. Few USAAF officers regarded dive bombers as effective, though they were frequently used by the United States Navy. A USAAF squadron equipped with Douglas A-24 Banshee dive bombers was deployed to New Guinea in April 1942, but was withdrawn from combat at the end of May that year after flying only a few combat sorties. The USAAF regarded this type as unsuited to conditions in the theatre, though the US Navy operated it very successfully from its aircraft carriers as the Douglas SBD Dauntless. The USAAF preferred to use fighter-bombers and light bombers to support ground troops in New Guinea, fighter-bombers especially as they could strafe and skip bomb Japanese positions as well as employ dive-bombing tactics. Similarly, by late 1942 the RAAF preferred to use the light bombers that it was now beginning to receive to provide tactical support for the Army. An order for 150 Curtis Shrike dive bombers was cancelled after the first ten of these aircraft were delivered to Australia in November 1942, making the Vengeance the only dedicated dive bomber operated by the RAAF.|$|E
5000|$|However in May 1940 she {{was ordered}} to Dunkirk, but then {{diverted}} to Saint Malo to destroy some radio masts, which was successfully achieved. While she was alongside the quay she was <b>dive</b> <b>bombed</b> blowing {{in the side of}} the ship and flooding the engine room. The engines being out of action, a “V&W” destroyer, [...] towed her back to Devonport in two days for repairs.|$|R
5000|$|The {{squadron}} {{also provided}} support for reconnaissance operations. It deployed to Corsica in August 1944 to support Allied Forces in Operation Dragoon, {{the invasion of}} Southern France. The unit continued to fly long range missions to strafe and <b>dive</b> <b>bomb</b> targets in an arc from France to the Balkan Peninsula until the surrender of Germany in May 1945. [...] The squadron was inactivated in Italy in September of that year.|$|R
50|$|Astal also {{includes}} a 2-Player cooperative mode, with a second player controlling the bird. The bird can strike at the enemy with wings and beak using the B button, launch an arrow attack by holding down and then releasing the B button, or <b>dive</b> <b>bomb</b> the enemy by pressing and holding the C button while using left and right on the D-pad to control direction. The bird can also dash across the screen by pressing left or right twice and holding.|$|R
5|$|Late in {{the morning}} of November 22, 1952, Loring led a flight of four F-80s on patrol over Kunwha. Upon radioing a forward air controller, he was told a T-6 Texan flying over Sniper Ridge had spotted a {{concentration}} of artillery near the ridge which was pinning down UN ground troops on the ridge. He was also told the artillery concentration was surrounded by a heavy presence of anti-aircraft guns. Loring ordered the flight to the location, spotting the artillery concentration. Immediately after Loring began his <b>dive</b> <b>bombing</b> run, he was spotted by the anti-aircraft batteries. The Chinese crews operating them were highly skilled, and even at a distance, the batteries fired an extremely accurate barrage which struck Loring's aircraft several times on the nose and fuselage. The fire disabled the aircraft. His wingmen, noting the damage, suggested he abort the bombing mission, as the flight was not far behind the lines and Loring's aircraft could have attempted the return trip. Instead, Loring ceased radio contact, and resumed {{what appeared to be the}} standard bombing mission. At , however, Loring accelerated his aircraft at a 40-degree angle in what appeared to be a controlled maneuver, lining up the Chinese batteries. The other pilots reported they watched, stunned, as Loring dove his damaged aircraft into the battery position. Loring was killed instantly in the impact, but his action resulted in the complete destruction of the battery position.|$|E
25|$|After various early assignments, Davis {{reported}} to Naval Air Station Pensacola in Pensacola Florida, for flight training. He was designated a naval aviator in 1923. Duties at the U.S. Navys Bureau of Aeronautics and Bureau of Ordnance soon followed. While there, Davis became {{a pioneer of}} dive bombing; he developed <b>dive</b> <b>bombing</b> techniques and in 1925, he designed a bombsight for use in <b>dive</b> <b>bombing.</b>|$|E
25|$|Arthur Cayley Davis (14 March 1893 – 10 February 1965) was an admiral of the United States Navy. His career {{included}} {{service in}} World War II and the Cold War. He {{was a pioneer}} of <b>dive</b> <b>bombing.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Wild Weasel {{mission was}} to precede strike flights, {{sanitizing}} the target area of radar guided Surface-to-Air Missile SA-2 'Guideline' threats, leaving the threat area last, which sometimes would result in 3.5-hour missions, before returning to Royal Thai Air Force Bases. This was achieved by turning toward the air defense site in a threatening manner, firing radar homing missiles at the site, or visually locating the site to <b>dive</b> <b>bomb</b> it. These tactics were attempted while under attack by MiGs and anti-aircraft artillery.|$|R

5000|$|The {{introduction}} to [...] "Long Way Back from Hell" [...] {{begins with the}} use of the <b>dive</b> <b>bomb</b> guitar technique. Guitarist John Christ explained: “We worked on the beginning of that song for a long time before we finally got it right - it always sounded too empty. But when Eerie came in with that galloping bass-line, it all kind of fell into place. It has a lot of energy to it and was probably one of the best songs on that album.” ...|$|R
