5000|$|Rover made {{an attempt}} {{to break into the}} North American market with the P6, {{beginning}} with the Rover 2000 TC. One version of the P6 that was exported was the NADA (North American <b>Dollar</b> <b>Area)</b> model, equipped to a higher standard than UK cars. These are also often referred to today as being [...] "Federal Specification". Notable differences outside the car were wraparound bumpers, three air scoops {{on the top of the}} bonnet, front and rear wing reflectors and the [...] "Icelert" [...] on the front grill. The [...] "Icelert" [...] was a sensor which warned the driver of falling outside temperatures and the possibility of ice forming on the road. Inside, depending on the location, the US 3500S was also equipped with electric windows, power steering and air conditioning, all of which are extremely unusual in UK market P6 cars. The NADA P6 introduced features which would later appear on the UK Mark II car including a new instrument cluster and seat piping. Despite being badged as [...] "3500S" [...] cars, the export models were all fitted with the Borg Warner 35 automatic transmission. The cars were not popular with American buyers, but were sold in Europe instead as they were already converted to left-hand drive. In true British Leyland fashion, several UK cars also ended up with single scoops on their bonnets in {{an attempt to}} use up the surplus parts from the now defunct export models. Rover discontinued selling the P6 in North America in 1971: in that year the US had taken fewer than 1,500 Rovers. The company told their US dealers that modifying their cars to meet new US federal safety and pollution requirements would be prohibitively expensive, while experience elsewhere suggests that the Rover four-cylinder engine was particularly hard to adapt for reduced octane lead-free fuels without an unacceptable reduction in the car's performance.|$|E

This study investigates the effects of currency area exchange rate changes on trade balances of individual members instead of the area as a whole. A member country's trade is classified into trade inside and outside of the area. Adding the characteristics of trade by currency area, the formula for the change in trade balance are derived. From this formula, it is concluded that whether a member country's trade balance will be improved (worsened) as a consequence of area devaluation (appreciation) depends on the proportionate change in the exchange rate, price elasticities of demand for and supply of imports and exports by currency area, initial patterns of trade by currency area, and the proportionate change of imports and exports within the area to which this country belongs. Using the derived formula, the effects of the 1971 currency realignment are evaluated empirically. Countries are classified into three currency areas: the U. S. <b>dollar</b> <b>area,</b> the area devaluing against the dollar, and the area appreciating against the dollar. Three countries of the <b>dollar</b> <b>area,</b> the U.

40|$|The {{adoption}} of Euro {{as a common}} currency of twelve European countries has meant a considerable change in the Italian exchange rate policy. In the past, before Italy entered the EMS and again in 1992 - 96 when Italy temporarily left the EMS, the Italian monetary authorities enacted a policy of managed exchange rates, aiming at keeping the dollar rate stable, while letting the Italian lira depreciate vis-a-vis the German mark. By so doing, the danger of imported inflation was reduced (the <b>dollar</b> <b>area</b> was then a major import area) {{and at the same}} time the Italian exports to Europe were made easier. In the presence of a regime of fixed exchange rates in the European area, Italian industry is trying to make its exports more competitive by means of a reduction in costs. This means moving segments of production to small or middle-size firms, located in Italy as well as in developing countries. A further help is coming from the gradual but consistent depreciation of the Euro against the US dollar. The relevance of the <b>dollar</b> <b>area</b> in Italian exports has been correspondingly increasing. ...|$|E

The secular process of private sector currency substitution (‘dollarisation’) stimulated by successive financial shocks now poses serious challenges for the conduct of North American monetary policy. Although the monetary calculus for a potential <b>dollar</b> <b>area</b> yields a positive outcome for peripheral members, historical experience suggests that the asymmetric impact of external shocks will require specific arrangements to contain the economic and social results. Further, the consequences of currency unification for capital markets under the gold standard, the sterling area, currency boards and the euro-zone have all meant that inter-governmental agreements for liquidity provision and prudential regulation have become necessary. This is the ‘winner’s curse’: the success of North American market integration is necessarily leading to a degree of institutional co-operation that US legislators have desired to avoid. ...|$|E

We concentrate on four such mechanisms, relative wage adjustment, migration, net fiscal flows and bank flows. Only in Latvia was there any relative wage adjustment. Intra-EU migration has increased, but is more costly for those involved in the EU (than in the USA). Net federal financing helped Arizona and Latvia in the crisis, but not Spain. The locally focussed structure of banking amplified the crisis in Spain, whereas the role of out-of-state banks eased adjustment in Arizona and Latvia.

40|$|The {{downward}} {{movement in the}} total gold and dollar holdings of foreign countries that began in mid- 1951 was reversed during {{the early part of}} 1952. At {{the end of the year}} these holdings were 1. 2 billion dollars larger than a year earlier. The improvement resulted primarily from a substantial reduction in the United States export surplus, as exports declined and imports of goods and services increased. Loans and grants from the United States Government to foreign countries declined somewhat and the flow of private capital abroad remained near its 1951 level. Renewed progress toward monetary stability in most countries helped to bring about the upward movement in foreign reserves. This movement also reflected improved supply conditions abroad and, in some countries, tightening of import restrictions on goods from the <b>dollar</b> <b>area.</b> Total gold and dollar holdings of foreign countries, after falling 900 million dollars during the second half of 1951, declined a further 250 million in the first quarter of 1952.

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} the {{international}} monetary system will evolve into a bipolar structure consisting of a <b>dollar</b> <b>area</b> and a euro area, each of which attracting other countries to their gravitational centers. A deepening and widening of NAFTA and the EU will enlarge the sphere of influence of both currencies; trade wars will restrict them. The yen is a big question mark. The deep and still unresolved financial crisis in Japan works against the enlargement of the yen; deregulation of its financial markets, with the attendant decline in transaction costs, goes in the opposite direction. Our conclusion is that the yen area will be {{much smaller than the}} dollar and the euro area and, consequently, the two large blocs will shape the international monetary system of the 21 st century in a critical way. We also discuss feasible scenarios of interaction between currency blocs. A large EMU works in favor of cooperation because fewer players imply lower decision-making costs in reaching a cooperative solution. The relative closeness of the EMU and the United States, on the other hand, works against cooperation and in favor of benign neglect. Exchange-rate agreements are fragile unless supported by strong commitment to economic policy cooperation, and such a commitment may well be premature.

40|$|Creating the European {{monetary}} union between diverse and unequal nation states is arguably {{one of the}} biggest social experiments in history. This book offers an explanation of how the euro experiment came about and was sustained despite a severe crisis, and provides a comparison with the monetary-financial history of the US. The euro experiment can be understood as risk-sharing through a currency that is issued by a supranational central bank. A single currency shares liquidity risks by creating larger markets for all financial assets. A single monetary policy responds to business cycles in the currency area as a whole rather than managing the path of one dominant economy. Mechanisms of risk-sharing become institutions of monetary solidarity if they are consciously maintained, but they will periodically face opposition in member states. This book argues that diversity of membership is not an economic obstacle {{to the success of the}} euro, as diversity increases the potential gains from risk sharing. But political cooperation is needed to realize this potential, and such cooperation is up against collective action problems which become more intractable as the parties become more diverse. Hence, risk-sharing usually comes about as a collective by-product of national incentives. This political-economic tension can explain why the gains from risk-sharing are not more fully exploited, both in the euro area and in the US <b>dollar</b> <b>area.</b> This approach to monetary integration is based on the theory of collective action when hierarchy is not available as a solution to inter-state cooperation. The theory originates with Keohane and Ostrom (1995) and it is applied in this book, taking into account the latest research on the inherent instability of financial market integration...|$|E

40|$|With {{a growth}} rate of only 1 ½ percent in real terms, {{economic}} activity was weak in the EU in 1996. The strong upturn {{after the end of}} the recession of 1992 - 93 faltered as early as in the first half of 1995 on account of unstable exchange rates, high interest rates, and restrictive fiscal policies. Demand and production remained flat until the first half of 1996. The recovery setting in then, slow and fragile at first, was mostly driven by an expansion in exports. Import demand from important trading partners of the EU, mainly the USA and East-Central Europe, was lively; at the same time, the competitive position of European exporters vis-à-vis the <b>dollar</b> <b>area</b> improved with the strengthening of the dollar. Trade between the member countries of the EU is also estimated to have expanded at a lively pace. Production expectations and business climate indicators in manufacturing improved markedly since the middle of the year. The austerity policy pursued by the majority of the EU countries at the same time – public deficits had soared after the recession of 1992 - 93 – tended to depress each country's domestic consumption and investment demand and, by dampening import demand, also export demand in other EU countries, an effect that was reinforced by the tight linkage between the EU economies. Consumer confidence was subdued in most countries. Economic growth in Europe was too weak to relieve the strains in the labor market; employment stagnated and the unemployment rate rose to 11 percent. The development of the labor market was more favorable in those countries with an above-average expansion of production and demand, such as Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands, Spain, and the U. K. The highest increase in the unemployment rate, by about ¾ percentage point, was recorded in Germany, France, and Sweden. The slow growth in revenues and the rise in expenditures on unemployment relief, both a result of the weakness in economic activity, impeded fast progress in the consolidation of public sector budgets. Despite comprehensive discretionary measures with regard to taxes and expenditures, public sector deficits declined only marginally to 4 ½ percent of GDP (1995 5 percent). Inflation continues to follow a downward trend. The inflation rate was 2 percent in the EU on average. The decrease was particularly pronounced in countries with high inflation; in Italy, the rate of price increase declined from 5. 6 percent in December 1995 to 2. 7 percent in December 1996.

40|$|The Euroland {{economy is}} in a strong upswing. Last year, real GDP {{increased}} at a rate roughly {{equal to that of}} potential output in spite of the export losses {{in the wake of the}} crises in various countries of the world. There have been considerable impulses from monetary policy. Because of the strength of the economy, the ECB has started to tighten its policy. Nevertheless, monetary conditions in the euro area are still favorable. In 2000, real GDP is likely to increase by 3. 2 percent; this is the highest rate in the past ten years. After a weak start, the economy gained considerable momentum in the course of 1999. While the strong export performance was responsible for the turnaround, domestic demand growth also accelerated somewhat. In the second half of 1999, real GDP increased at an annual rate of 3. 5 percent, and capacity utilization should have reached its normal level by now. Inflation picked up in the course of 1999 with rates between 1. 5 and 2. 0 percent, thus coming close to the upper limit of the target range tolerated by the ECB. The driving force so far were higher import prices. Since November, the ECB has raised key interest rates by 100 basis points to 3. 50 percent. This is the first tightening of monetary policy since the fall of 1997. The expansion of M 3, however, indicates that monetary policy continues to be expansionary. Last year, the reference value for money growth was exceeded considerably. The interest rate hikes must be seen against this background. They were the logical consequence in the concept which is based on money growth. In the present situation, rules for monetary policy also suggest a tightening. The McCallum Rule pertains to the growth rate of the money stock M 3 that is compatible with the inflation target and the trend changes in output and velocity. Since early 1999, money growth has been higher than the rate implied by the rule. If this tendency continued, inflation would exceed 2 percent. In order to avoid this, interest rates have to go up. Similarly, the Taylor Rule suggests that interest rates need to be higher because capacity utilization is at its normal level and will rise further. The countries in the euro area have come closer to the target of the Stability and Growth Pact as budget deficits have declined. Next year, fiscal policy will be characterized by tax cuts in a number of countries. The strongest impulse will come from the tax reform in Germany. For Euroland as a whole, the stance of fiscal policy will thus become expansionary. In general, there appears to be a shift in the strategy of fiscal policy: While deficits were reduced on the road to EMU also by increases in taxes and contributions, the revenue/GDP ratio will decline in the coming three years according to the plans of governments. Spending is supposed to decline even more so that deficits will shrink. Such a strategy can be highly recommended. According to empirical estimates, fiscal policy has contributed to the decline in the potential growth rate in the past 30 years by expanding the share of government spending in GDP. While leading indicators point to a strong expansion of economic activity in the near future, several factors will lead to a moderate slowdown of the upswing later this year and in 2001. The recovery in the world economy will lose some momentum and the effect of the weaker euro will gradually fade. Furthermore, the ECB will raise interest rates again. An impulse for the upswing, however, will result from the turnaround of fiscal policy. All in all, real GDP growth will amount to 3. 2 percent this year and will go down to 2. 8 percent in 2001. The unemployment rate will continue to fall; next year, it'will drop to below 9 percent for the first time since 1992. Consumer prices will rise a lot faster than in 1999. Although the inflation rate will decline somewhat in the course of this year because import prices will moderate, the core rate of inflation will go up due to the marked rise in capacity utilization. The Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices will increase by 1. 9 percent this year and by 1. 8 percent next year. The weakness of the euro has a stimulating effect on output in the euro area which is equivalent to roughly half a percentage point of GDP. If the trade links of the individual EMU countries with the <b>dollar</b> <b>area</b> are taken into account, it can be shown that the effects are spread more or less symmetrically across the economies.
