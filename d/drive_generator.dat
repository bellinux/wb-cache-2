40|$|The {{trend in}} wind energy is towards large {{offshore}} wind farms. This trend {{has led to}} the demand for high reliability and large single unit wind turbines. Different energy conversion topologies such as multiple stage geared generators, single stage geared generators and gearless (direct <b>drive)</b> <b>generators</b> have been coupled to the wind turbine in the last decades. Direct <b>drive</b> <b>generators</b> based on permanent magnet technology have a high efficiency, less components and lower speeds that can translate to high energy yield and less maintenance demand. However, the mass of such direct <b>drive</b> <b>generators</b> can be significantly higher than of other geared generators.

The pressure probes and vanes {{that make up}} the air data sensors is an optical and flush air data system, position of the sensors is in linear/rotary optical encoders. Importantly, actuators - currently electro-hydraulic/direct drive - could be electro-hydrostatic to accurate substantive weight savings on the AMCA. The aircraft has integrated radio and navigation system supported by IRNSS, where all burdens earlier borne by analogue circuits will be carried out by digital processors. Communication systems are based on software radio ranging from UHF to K band, with data links for digital data/voice data and video footage. The aircraft is equipped with AMAGB gearbox, which is designed and produced by CVRDE. The castings are made of magnesium alloy and the gearbox has its own self-contained lubrication system. AMAGB operates in two modes. In the starter mode, it aids in starting the engine through jet fuel starter. In accessory mode, it drives two hydraulic pumps and an integrated <b>drive</b> <b>generator.</b> These accessories, in turn, generate hydraulic and electrical power for the aircraft.|$|E

The deaerator is a component of the Integrated <b>Drive</b> <b>Generator</b> (IDG). The Integrated <b>Drive</b> <b>Generator</b> is used in aircrafts as the main power generator. Oil is used in the IDG as a lubricant and coolant. Air is trapped in the oil due to high suction forces of the oil pumps. The entrained air adversely affects the lubricative and thermal properties of oil. Centrifugal forces inside the deaerator are used to remove this entrained air from the oil. Hamilton Sundstrand has several different deaerator models, but has been unable to evaluate the efficiency of oil separation for different designs. Our goal is to evaluate the efficiency of two deaerator models. The evaluation will be based on experimental and theoretical data. The experimental data will be collected using an actual deaerator setup. The theoretical data will be collected using computational fluid dynamic (CFD) software models. ANSYS CFX software will be used for CFD models. The experimental results will then be compared to the theoretical results. An analysis of both results will lead {{to a better understanding of}} flow separation. B. S. (Bachelor of Science...|$|E

Deaerator is a component of integrated <b>drive</b> <b>generator</b> (IDG), which is used to separate air from oil. Integrated <b>drive</b> <b>generator</b> is the main power generation unit used in aircrafts to generate electric-power and must be cooled to give maximum efficiency. Mob Jet Oil II is used in these IDGs as a lubricant and coolant. So, in order to get high-quality oil, a deaerator is used to remove trapped air from this Mob Jet Oil II using the centrifugal principle. The reason for entrapment of air may be due to operation of vacuum and high-pressure pumps. In this study, 75 / 90 IDG generic and A 320 classic deaerator performance evaluation was done based on both experimental and numerical techniques. Experimental data was collected from deaerator test rig and numerical data was attained using CFD simulations (software used for CFD simulation is ANSYS CFX). Both experimental and numerical results were compared and also deaerator 75 / 90 generic and A 320 classic was compared in this study.

The work in this thesis can, thus, be categorized into two general topics, generator technology and optimization.

40|$|As wind {{turbines}} increase in power output, {{their size and}} mass grows as well. The development of offshore wind farms demands higher reliability to minimise the maintenance cost. Direct drive electrical generators offer a reliable alternative to conventional doubly fed induction generator machines since they omit the gearbox from the drive train. A fundamental issue for these generators is their large size which makes them difficult to manufacture, transfer and assemble. This study will investigate an analytical and a finite element analysis optimisation technique developed for minimising the structural mass of a direct <b>drive</b> <b>generator.</b> Both tools seek to minimise the mass of three different permanent magnet direct drive (PMDD) generators with 5 MW nominal power output while keeping a set of deflection criteria under limitations.

For the purpose of support such magnetic bearings in wind turbines, this thesis gives a complete control system. This control system includes electrical circuits and decentralized control method. The implementation of the electrical circuits is distributed into two PCBs. The decentralized control method is designed with six PID controllers.

40|$|A {{low-speed}} {{permanent magnet}} (PM) cable wound generator for electrical energy conversion from marine or tidal currents {{has been designed}} and constructed. A key feature of this variable speed direct <b>drive</b> <b>generator</b> is its capability to efficiently generate electricity from tidal currents with very low velocities, {{in the order of}} 1 m/s. In arriving at an appropriate design for the generator typical characteristics of tidal currents were considered. Using these characteristics as input, and accounting for the electromagnetic losses, detailed computer simulations using a finite-element method software were carried out {{to come up with the}} final design. Various parameters that can influence the generator design are presented. An experimental set-up has been constructed based on the above-mentioned design in order to study the electrical and mechanical performance of the generator through a variety of experiments. The power input for this set-up is a variable speed motor, capable of operating the generator at rotational speeds of 0 – 16 r/min, representing tidal currents with very low velocities.
