5|$|Boruto's {{character}} has received mixed critical responses. His {{relationship with his}} father has been criticized due to reviewers finding the concept overused in the Naruto manga. In Boruto: Naruto the Movie, his development was praised due to his action scenes and how <b>he</b> <b>understood</b> his father's actions.|$|E
5|$|General Wavell was {{familiar}} with desert warfare, having been a liaison officer with the Egyptian Expeditionary Force during the First World War, and <b>he</b> <b>understood</b> and endorsed Bagnold's suggested concept. Wavell assisted in equipping the force.|$|E
5|$|Another of Paco de Lucía's {{contributions}} was {{the inclusion}} of the cajón, an Afro-Peruvian instrument Caitro Soto exposed to him during his visit to Peru in the late 1970s. <b>He</b> <b>understood</b> this instrument, which he saw as a permanent solution to the need for percussion in flamenco. Along with Rubem Dantas, he added its percussive elements and it became an essential tool of contemporary flamenco and later, other international musical trends.|$|E

In a similar manner: <b>He</b> <b>understands</b> the ear and sounds ... the organ of smell and odors ... the organ of taste and flavors ... the organ of touch and tactual objects ... the consciousness and mental objects....|$|R
5|$|Because of his {{leadership}} at Yarmouk, Khalid ibn al-Walid {{is considered one}} of the finest generals in history and his use of mounted warriors throughout the battle showed just how well <b>he</b> <b>understood</b> the potential strengths and weaknesses of his mounted troops. His mobile guard moved quickly from one point to another, always changing the course of events wherever they appeared, and then just as quickly galloping away to change the course of events elsewhere on the field.|$|E
5|$|Clarke {{also had}} a good {{appreciation}} of the complex interplay between Operations and intelligence in deception operations. <b>He</b> <b>understood</b> how to manipulate enemy intelligence agencies {{to build up the}} story he was trying to sell, and saw the importance of getting Operations, on his own side, to fit into those stories.|$|E
5|$|Disraeli {{refused to}} cast {{blame for the}} defeat, which <b>he</b> <b>understood</b> {{was likely to be}} final for him. He wrote to Lady Bradford that it was just as much work to end a {{government}} as to form one, without any of the fun. Queen Victoria was bitter at his departure as Prime Minister. Among the honours he arranged before resigning as Prime Minister on 21 April 1880 was one for his private secretary, Montagu Corry, who became Baron Rowton.|$|E

5000|$|Nabors {{joined the}} {{minority}} {{staff of the}} powerful House Appropriations Committee {{at the end of}} the Clinton Administration. Appropriations Chair Dave Obey promoted him to minority staff director in 2004. When the Democrats won the House in 2006, Nabors became majority staff director. [...] "'He was just the best man for the job,' says Appropriations Committee Chairman Dave Obey, 'and <b>he</b> <b>understands</b> the House, <b>he</b> <b>understands</b> the committee, <b>he</b> <b>understands</b> the town, <b>he</b> <b>understands</b> the bureaucracy, and he doesn’t take any crap from anybody. His demeanor is very nice and very cool, but he doesn’t take any crap from people.'" [...] Nabors said it was his job not just to [...] "recite" [...] budget numbers but to [...] "own the information" [...] and understand the human meanings behind the numbers.|$|R

5|$|For many at the indaba, {{the most}} {{pressing}} motivator was Matabeleland's security. While Lobengula considered the Transvaalers more formidable battlefield adversaries than the British, <b>he</b> <b>understood</b> that Britain was more prominent on the world stage, and while the Boers wanted land, Rudd's party claimed to be interested only in mining and trading. Lobengula reasoned that if he accepted Rudd's proposals, he would keep his land, and the British would be obliged {{to protect him from}} incursions by the Boers.|$|E
5|$|He {{said that}} <b>he</b> <b>understood</b> my impatience with such small demands {{as a few}} hours less a day, or a few dollars more a week.... But what were men of his age to do? They were not likely to {{live to see the}} {{ultimate}} overthrow of the capitalist system. Were they also to forgo the release of perhaps two hours a day from the hated work? That was all they could hope to see realized in their lifetime.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, he {{published}} his treatise on violin playing, Szigeti on the Violin.

5|$|In October 2001 Adams left Brighton {{to become}} {{assistant}} manager to Dave Bassett at Leicester City. Peter Taylor, the former Leicester manager, was drafted in to complete Brighton's promotion campaign. Adams chose the move {{in an attempt}} to get closer to his dream of managing a Premiership club. <b>He</b> <b>understood</b> that Bassett was to move 'upstairs' {{at the end of the}} season, leaving Adams free to take the management job for 2002–03.|$|E
5|$|Another {{strike in}} Szczecin broke out on 22 January 1971. In a risky move, Gierek went to Szczecin on 24 January and to Gdańsk the next day. He met the workers personally, apologizing for the {{mistakes}} of the past and saying that as a former worker himself <b>he</b> <b>understood</b> their plight and would now govern Poland for the people. Workers striking in Szczecin formulated demands in the area of freely elected worker councils and union representatives. Gierek agreed, but the authorities soon marginalized and eliminated the worker leaders from the legally existing structures and their places of employment. The February 1971 Łódź strikes followed and concentrated on economic demands. Afterwards prices were lowered, wage increases were announced, and sweeping economic and political changes were promised.|$|E
5|$|Burnside {{was offered}} {{command of the}} Army of the Potomac {{following}} Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan's failure in the Peninsula Campaign. He refused this opportunity because of his loyalty to McClellan {{and the fact that}} <b>he</b> <b>understood</b> his own lack of military experience, and detached part of his corps in support of Maj. Gen. John Pope's Army of Virginia in the Northern Virginia Campaign. He received telegrams at this time from Maj. Gen. Fitz John Porter which were extremely critical of Pope's abilities as a commander, and he forwarded on to his superiors in concurrence. This episode later {{played a significant role in}} Porter's court-martial, in which Burnside appeared as a star witness.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the lack}} of aerial reconnaissance, Liman von Sanders had fairly {{accurate}} knowledge on 17 September 1918, regarding the forces deployed against his Fourth, Seventh and Eighth Armies. <b>He</b> <b>understood</b> there to be five infantry divisions and a French detachment facing the Eighth Army with another two divisions facing the Seventh Army and two mounted divisions facing the Fourth Army. Liman von Sanders was not surprised by the strength and location of the attack. He shifted all his available reserves and reinforcements to the west, not to the east. The strategically vital coastal plain was the most strongly defended sector of the front line. Here Liman von Sanders deployed his most experienced infantry divisions supported by heavy artillery.|$|E
5|$|Eugenio Espejo was an autodidact, and {{he claimed}} with pride {{that he never}} left any book in his hands unread, and if he did, he would {{make up for it}} by observing nature. However, his desire to read {{everything}} indiscriminately sometimes led him to hasty judgments, which appear in his manuscripts. Through his own written work, it can be inferred that Espejo considered education as the main means for popular development. <b>He</b> <b>understood</b> that reading was basic {{in the formation of the}} self, and his conscience drove him to critiques of the establishment, based on observation and in the application of the law of his time.|$|E
5|$|Galileo {{showed a}} modern {{appreciation}} for the proper relationship between mathematics, theoretical physics, and experimental physics. <b>He</b> <b>understood</b> the parabola, {{both in terms of}} conic sections {{and in terms of the}} ordinate (y) varying as the square of the abscissa (x). Galilei further asserted that the parabola was the theoretically ideal trajectory of a uniformly accelerated projectile in the absence of air resistance or other disturbances. He conceded that there are limits to the validity of this theory, noting on theoretical grounds that a projectile trajectory of a size comparable to that of the Earth could not possibly be a parabola, but he nevertheless maintained that for distances up to the range of the artillery of his day, the deviation of a projectile's trajectory from a parabola would be only very slight.|$|E

5|$|George was {{ridiculed}} by his British subjects; {{some of his}} contemporaries, such as Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, {{thought him}} unintelligent {{on the grounds that}} he was wooden in public. Though he was unpopular in Great Britain due to his supposed inability to speak English, such an inability may not have existed later in his reign as documents from that time show that <b>he</b> <b>understood,</b> spoke and wrote English. He certainly spoke fluent German and French, good Latin, and some Italian and Dutch. His treatment of his wife, Sophia Dorothea, became something of a scandal.|$|E
5|$|Hammond was {{selected}} for the M.C.C. tour of Australia in 1932–33. Known as the Bodyline series, it became notorious for the controversial English tactic of bowling short on the line of leg stump, making the ball rise towards the batsman's body to create deflections that could be caught by leg-side fielders. Hammond, {{one of the first}} players selected, was part of the selection committee on tour, and the M.C.C. captain, Douglas Jardine, may have discussed tactics with him on the outward journey. Hammond disapproved of Bodyline bowling, believing it to be dangerous, although <b>he</b> <b>understood</b> some of the reasons for its use. He kept his feelings hidden during the tour, preferring to go along with his captain {{and the rest of the}} team. It was not until 1946 that he openly voiced his opinion.|$|E
5|$|In 1706, the Elector of Bavaria was {{deprived}} of his offices and titles for siding with Louis against the Empire. The following year, George was invested as an Imperial Field Marshal with {{command of the}} imperial army stationed along the Rhine. His tenure was not altogether successful, partly because he was deceived by his ally, the Duke of Marlborough, into a diversionary attack, and partly because Emperor Joseph I appropriated the funds necessary for George's campaign for his own use. Despite this, the German princes {{thought that he had}} acquitted himself well. In 1708 they formally confirmed George's position as a Prince-Elector in recognition of, or because of, his service. George did not hold Marlborough's actions against him which <b>he</b> <b>understood</b> were part of a plan to lure French forces from the main attack.|$|E
