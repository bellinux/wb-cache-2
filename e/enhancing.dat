40|$|Contrast and {{lightness}} {{measures are}} used to first classify the image as being one of non-turbid and turbid. If turbid, the original image is <b>enhanced</b> to generate a first <b>enhanced</b> image.

The non-turbid image is <b>enhanced</b> to generate a second <b>enhanced</b> image when a poor contrast/lightness score is associated therewith. When the second <b>enhanced</b> image has a poor contrast/lightness score associated therewith, this image is <b>enhanced</b> to generate a third <b>enhanced</b> image. A sharpness measure is computed for one image that is selected from (i) the non-turbid image, (ii) the first <b>enhanced</b> image, (iii) the second <b>enhanced</b> image when a good contrast/lightness score is associated therewith, and (iv) the third <b>enhanced</b> image.

30|$|Firstly, the {{original}} gray scale image {{is subjected to}} the transformation function in Eq. (1) to obtain a supposed <b>enhanced</b> image. The transformation function is applied based {{on a set of}} initial parameter values selected by the CSO algorithm in a random manner. These parameter values are used in the transformation function in order to obtain a supposed <b>enhanced</b> image. This <b>enhanced</b> image is then passed to the EF were a specific value is computed for the <b>enhanced</b> image as described in Section 2.3. This EF value is one of several possible values computed for different <b>enhanced</b> images belonging to a population of possible <b>enhanced</b> images. Thus, each <b>enhanced</b> image in the population is subjected to the transformation function using different sets of parameter values and then passed to the EF to obtain a fitness value. The best (or largest) EF value from among a population of different <b>enhanced</b> images is selected per generation (or iteration). The iteration proceeds until no better value is obtained. Thus, the <b>enhanced</b> image that produces the highest EF value after several number of iterations (or generation) is outputted as the best <b>enhanced</b> image.|$|R

The evolving depth <b>enhanced</b> panorama is rendered continually to provide immediate operator feedback.

5|$|Camas pocket gophers cause {{significant}} economic losses, so may {{be treated as}} an agricultural pest. Crops damaged include clover, alfalfa and vetch. The gophers may eat these crops or damage the roots while burrowing. This can injure the roots and expose them to air, causing them to dry out. Subterranean activity can also damage the roots of fruit trees. Root crops are particularly susceptible to damage and consumption; potatoes, carrots, parsnips and other crops may be eaten on site or dragged off by the gopher for caching in the burrow. Excavated soil can cover grass and limit lifestock grazing; freshly sprouted grains may be similarly damaged. An estimate of impact from camas pocket gopher activities in the Willamette Valley in 1918 amounted to $1.5million annual losses. Gopher activities can provide a benefit of soil aeration, <b>enhancing</b> water retention after rain or snowmelt. Buried vegetation can also compost, <b>enhancing</b> organic soil content to provide additional benefits.|$|E
