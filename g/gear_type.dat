25|$|Many {{types of}} gear {{have been used}} to catch blue crabs along the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts. Initially people used very simple {{techniques}} and gear, which included hand lines, dip nets, and push nets among a variety of other gear types. The trotline, a long baited twine set in waters 5–15 feet deep, was the first major <b>gear</b> <b>type</b> used commercially to target hard crabs. Use of commercial trotlines is now mostly limited to the tributaries of the Chesapeake Bay. In the Gulf of Mexico, trotline use drastically declined after invention of the crab pot in 1938. Crab pots are rigid boxlike traps made of hexagonal or square wire mesh. They possess between two and four funnels that extend into the trap, with the smaller end of the funnel inside of the trap. A central compartment made of smaller wire mesh holds bait. Crabs attracted by odorant plumes from the bait, often an oily fish, enter the trap through the funnels and cannot escape.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} a bioeconomic model is {{developed}} {{for a commercial}} fishery with multiple <b>gear</b> <b>types</b> {{in the case of}} two independent fish species. Where most bioeconomic fishery models focus on either multiple <b>gear</b> <b>types</b> or multiple species (mostly predator-prey relationships) this model combines both aspects for four <b>gear</b> <b>types</b> and two independent fish species. The objective of the paper is to find the optimal allocation of four <b>gear</b> <b>types</b> per period to obtain the highest net benefits while harvesting at a sustainable rate. This is done by developing a discrete time LP-model for a sole owner fishery, given a Total Allowable Catch for the two fish species. The model is applied to the Chippewas of Nawash First Nation commercial fishery in Lake Huron and Georgian Bay (Ontario, Canada).

Five cases drawn from various time periods illustrate the range of gear bans.

40|$|In studies {{evaluating}} the condition and general {{health status of}} fish stocks, the method used for catching the fish is seldom considered as a factor of importance. In this study, condition indices were compared between cod caught in pots, gillnets, and on hooks in the same geographical area. The results showed that cod (Gadus morhua) caught on baited <b>gear</b> <b>types</b> (pots and hooks) generally displayed a lower condition and an older age (i. e. suggesting a lower growth rate) compared to cod caught in gillnets. It is unclear whether these results merely illustrate divergent behavioural responses in fish originating from one single population, or if these divergent behavioural components represent distinct subpopulations displaying different mean conditions and growth rates. Regardless of the underlying causes, the results not only show that parts of the Baltic cod stock are in extremely poor condition, they also indicate that different <b>gear</b> <b>types</b> {{used in the same}} area could target similar-sized conspecifics exhibiting large differences in condition and size-at-age. The potential impact of the difference in condition between the pots and other <b>gear</b> <b>types</b> could hamper the implementation of the cod pot as a potentially seal-safe and sustainable fishing method...|$|R

40|$|Population {{estimates}} of crabs in commercial fisheries are traditionally {{based on the}} reported catch and effort, with supplementary sampling by researchers. This study investigated the four <b>gear</b> <b>types</b> most commonly used by fishers and researchers to determine whether their catches {{are representative of the}} populations. The selectivity of a large mesh trap, a small-mesh trap, a seine net and an otter trawl catching Portunus pelagicus (blue swimmer crab) in Peel-Harvey Estuary, Western Australia, was examined. Both the seine net and otter trawl caught a wide size range of crabs, although most of the catch was larger than the size at sexual maturity. The sex ratio of crabs caught by these two <b>gear</b> <b>types</b> was close to parity. However, traps caught a narrow size range, almost all of the catch were larger than the size at sexual maturity, and catches were heavily biased towards large males. Therefore, although favored by commercial fishers and for sampling crustacean populations in sensitive and protected areas, trap catches are not representative of the population sampled for blue swimmer crabs. Seine nets or otter trawls should thus be considered in the research assessment of stocks as their catches are more representative of the population. Catchability of all four <b>gear</b> <b>types</b> was found to vary seasonally. The size and sex bias of trap catches appear to be attributable to behavioural differences...|$|R

40|$|Many Caribbean reef {{fisheries}} {{have been}} overexploited {{for decades and}} often their decline has been accelerated by a loss of habitat. Improved management of Caribbean reef fisheries is vital to ensure their future sustainability. Reef fisheries in the Caribbean are difficult to manage due {{to the use of}} multiple fishing <b>gear</b> <b>types,</b> the number of species harvested, and the dispersed landing sites used by the fishers. Additionally, there is very little published information available on Caribbean reef fisheries and limited research into the effects of management. This review provides a synthesis of the published literature on four gears commonly used in Caribbean reef fisheries: fish traps, spears, hook and line, and beach seines, summarizing evidence on best management practices for each gear.

40|$|I used {{multiple}} mark-recapture experiments for British Columbia (B.

Notable differences in selectivity were observed among <b>gear</b> <b>types</b> with the longline fishery selecting for large sablefish, the trap fishery selecting for intermediate-sized sablefish, and the trawl fishery selecting for small sablefish below the minimum size limit. Empirical estimates of gear selectivity were incorporated into yield-per-recruit (YPR) and spawner biomass-per-recruit models to evaluate the effects of at-sea discarding on long-term fishery yield. My results suggest that up to 49 % of the total YPR is potentially lost because of at-sea discarding. Fishery regulations that minimize the capture of sub-legal sablefish in combination with economic incentives that encourage the retention of legal-sized sablefish can help to mitigate potential losses in fishery yield resulting from at-sea discarding...|$|R
