30|$|As {{vehicles}} move at {{high speed}} in the motorway, the topology formed by vehicles is always changing. The highly dynamic topology results in a frequent disconnection of link between two vehicles. Based on this, the DENM messages are classified into two types in the paper: the emergency message and the <b>inquiry</b> <b>message.</b> This paper proposes a data Dissemination Service for Broadcasting and on-Demand unicast in the VANETs (DSV-BD). We use different transmission methods to deliver different types of messages. For emergency messages, a proposed broadcasting algorithm can make the emergency messages cover a limited network domain rapidly. On the other hand, if some vehicles request real-time messages of personal interest, an on-demand unicast mechanism is proposed to reduce network load.|$|E
40|$|A Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is {{a network}} of {{spatially}} distributed autonomous devices that depend on their sensors to monitor environmental or physical conditions and report to a base station. The topology of any network is important and wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are no exception. In order to effectively model an energy-efficient routing algorithm, the topology of the WSN must be factored in. There has been much research into regular topologies for WSNs, to efficiently save energy and hence extend the lifetime of the network. However, little {{work has been done}} on routing within patterned WSNs, except for the shortest path first (spf) routing algorithms. The issue with the spf algorithm is that it requires global location information from the sensor network, which proves to be a drain on the network resources. In this paper a Biased Random Energy-Efficient Routing Algorithm is proposed (BREERA). It is based on random walk and probability. It uses probability theory to acquire all the information it needs to route packets based on the energy resources in each node and thus does not require any global information from the network. It is shown in this paper that BREERAuses the same energy as the shortest path first routing in cases where the message to be sent is comparatively small in size compared with the <b>inquiry</b> <b>message</b> among the neighbors. It is also shown to balance the load (i. e. the packets to be sent) among the nodes in the network. In most of the WSN applications the messages sent to the base station are very small in size. Therefore BREERA is viable and can be used in sensor networks employed in such applications.

40|$|The {{original}} publication {{is available}} at www. springerlink. comTopology {{is one of the}} most important characteristics for any type of networks because it represents the network’s inherent properties and has great impact on the performance of the network. For wireless sensor networks (WSN), a well-deployed regular topology can help save more energy than what a random topology can do. WSNs with regular topologies can prolong network lifetime as studied in many previous work. However, little work has been done in developing effective routing algorithms for WSNs with regular topologies, except routing along a shortest path with the knowledge of global location information of sensor nodes. In this paper, a new routing protocol based on random walk is proposed. It does not require global location information. It also achieves load balancing property inherently for WSNs which is difficult to achieve by other routing protocols. In the scenarios where the message required to be sent to the base station is in comparatively small size with the <b>inquiry</b> <b>message</b> among neighboring nodes, it is proved that the random walk routing protocol can guarantee high probability of successful transmission from the source to the base station with the same amount of energy consumption as the shortest path routing. Since in many applications of WSNs, sensor nodes often send only beep-like small messages to the base station to report their status, our proposed random walk routing is thus a viable scheme and can work very efficiently especially in these application scenarios. The random walk routing provides load balancing in the WSN as mentioned, however, the nodes near to the base station are inevitably under heavier burden than those far away from the base station. Therefore, a density-aware deployment scheme is further proposed to guarantee that the heavy-load nodes do not affect the network lifetime even if their energy is exhausted. The main idea is deploying sensors with different densities according to their distance to the base station. It will be shown in this paper that incorporating the random walk routing protocol with the density-aware deployment scheme can effectively prolong the network lifetime.

40|$|A {{wireless}} {{sensor network}} (WSN) is made of tiny sensor nodes usually deployed in high density within a targeted area to monitor a phenomenon of interest such as temperature, vibration or humidity. The WSNs can be employed in various applications (e. g., Structural monitoring, agriculture, environment monitoring, machine health monitoring, military, and health). For each application area there are different technical issues and remedies. Various challenges {{need to be considered}} while setting up a WSN, including limited computing, memory and energy resources, wireless channel errors and network scalability. One way of addressing these problems is by implementing a routing protocol that efficiently uses these limited resources and hence reduces errors, improves scalability and increases the network lifetime. The topology of any network is important and {{wireless sensor network}}s (WSNs) are no exception. In order to effectively model an energy-efficient routing algorithm, the topology of the WSN must be factored in. However, little work has been done on routing for WSNs with regular patterned topologies, except for the shortest path first (SPF) routing algorithms. The issue with the SPF algorithm is that it requires global location information of the nodes from the sensor network, which proves to be a drain on the network resources. In this thesis a novel algorithm namely, BRALB (Biased Random Algorithm for Load Balancing) is proposed to overcome the issues faced in routing data within WSNs with regular topologies such as square-base topology and triangle-based topology. It is based on random walk and probability. The proposed algorithm uses probability theory to build a repository of information containing the estimate of energy resources in each node, in order to route packets based on the energy resources in each node and thus does not require any global information from the network. It is shown in this thesis by statistical analysis and simulations that BRALB uses the same energy as the shortest path first routing as long as the data packets are comparable in size to the inquiry packets used between neighbours. It is also shown to balance the load (i. e. the packets to be sent) efficiently among the nodes in the network. In most of the WSN applications the messages sent to the base station are very small in size. Therefore BRALB is viable and can be used in sensor networks employed in such applications. However, one of the constraints of BRALB {{is that it is not}} very scalable; this is a genuine concern as most WSNs deployment is large scale. In order to remedy this problem, C-BRALB (Clustered Biased Random Algorithm for Load Balancing) has been proposed as an extension of BRALB with clustering mechanism. The same clustering technique used in Improved Directed Diffusion (IDD) has been adopted for C-BRALB. The routing mechanism in C-BRALB is based on energy biased random walk. This algorithm also does not require any global information apart from the initial flooding initiated by the sink to create the clusters. It uses probability theory to acquire all the information it needs to route packets based on energy resources in each cluster head node. It is shown in this thesis by using both simulations and statistical analysis that C-BRALB is an efficient routing algorithm in applications where the message to be sent is comparable to the <b>inquiry</b> <b>message</b> among the neighbours. It is also shown to balance the load (i. e. the packets to be sent) among the neighbouring cluster head nodes...|$|E

Mrs. Sweeney {{is one of the}} race of professed laundresses, and is the compiler of a remarkable manuscript volume entitled 'Mrs. Sweeney's Book,' from which much curious statistical information may be gathered respecting the high prices and small uses of soda, soap, sand, firewood, and other such articles.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2002 Text {{messaging}} on {{the mobile}} phone {{is a recent}} and significant global phenomenon requiring an <b>inquiry.</b> Billions of <b>messages</b> are sent each month worldwide. One may question what the act of exchanging short text messages on the mobile phone (I call it m-mail), with seemingly trivial content, really does for the user. Rather than trying to construct {{a long list of}} possible uses and motives for m-mail, in this study I examine whether m-mail is related to relationship development by comparing Japanese m-mail users with their Swedish counterparts. I posed four research questions (RQ). RQ# 1, concerning frequency of m-mail and message content, is the basic information required to understand the phenomenon. The results of RQ# 1 become the context for RQ# 2, the primary focus of this study [...] -a possible link between m-mail and relationship maintenance. RQ# 3 specifically looked at in-country variations and RQ# 4 examined variance between countries. Because a single theory was unlikely to explain the phenomenon, I looked for various possible components in the literature in the fields of CMC, interpersonal relationships, and the mobile phone. I used an administered survey and Q-methodology with a purposive and snowball sample of 96 people [...] - 40 in Stockholm and 56 in Tokyo. Q factor analysis identified respondents' types [...] -four types in each country and five types in the combined sample. Type was found {{to be related to the}} key concepts of this study: frequency of m-mail use, message content, and the idea as to whether m-mail helps users to maintain relationships with friends and family. Occupation, that is, whether the respondent is a student or non-student, is the most clearly differentiating demographic variable for the Swedish sample. For the Japanese sample, occupation, age and household are almost equally significant. M-mail is an efficient communication tool for people with busy life style, but it is used for more than convenience and practical purposes.

40|$|Nearly {{a decade}} after the 9 / 11 Commission issued its report on the {{greatest}} act of terrorismon U. S. soil, one of its most significant recommendations has not been acted upon. The call for consolidated Congressionaloversight of the U. S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is, in the words of Commission co-chair Thomas H. Kean, "maybe the toughest recommendation" because Congress does not usually reform itself. To underscore the importance of this reform, The Annenberg Foundation Trust at Sunnylands and the Aspen Institute's Justice and Society Program convened a task force in April 2013, including 9 / 11 Commission cochairs Kean and Lee H. Hamilton, former DHS officials under Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush, and members of Congress (Appendix). While the failure to reform DHS oversight may be invisible to the public, it is not without consequence or risk. Fragmented jurisdiction impedes DHS' ability to deal with three major vulnerabilities: thethreats posed by small aircraft and boats; cyberattacks; and biological weapons. "I think we've been distinctly less securefrom a biological or chemical attack than wewould have been had we had a more rationaland targeted program of identifying the most serious threats," said former Sen. BobGraham (D., Fla.). As the 9 / 11 Commission Report noted: "So long as oversight is governed by current Congressional rules and resolutions, we believe that the American people will not get the security they want and need. " Earlier work by policy groups such as the Heritage Foundation and Brookings Institution attests to the consensus that consolidated oversight of DHS is needed. Among the concerns: More than 100 Congressional committees and subcommittees claim jurisdiction over it. In 2009, the department spent the equivalent of 66 worky ears responding to Congressional <b>inquiries.</b> Moreover, the <b>messages</b> regarding homeland security that come out of Congress sometimes appear to conflict or are drowned outaltogether. As former DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff noted, "When many voices speak, it's like no voice speaks. " The task force recommends that: DHS should have an oversight structure that resembles the one governing other critical departments, such as Defenseand Justice. Committees claiming jurisdiction over DHS should have overlapping membership. Since a new committee structure cannot be implemented until the 114 th Congress is seated in 2015, the task force also recommends these interim steps toward more focused oversight: Time-limiting subcommittee referrals to expedite matters of national security.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} presents novel {{tools to}} help instructors measure students linking of content {{knowledge and the}} actions students perform for studying {{in the context of}} post-secondary General Chemistry. The first tool described in this work is Creative Exercises (CEs), an open-ended assessment that has the potential to promote students making connections across the content covered in General Chemistry. Students are given a simple prompt that describes a chemistry situation, and asked to write as many statements as they can that are correct, distinct and relevant to the prompt and the course content. The written responses to CEs from both in-class exams and homework assignments are examined for evidence of linking chemistry concepts. The findings indicate that students are able to use a wide range of topics to answer CEs based on the prompts. Also, from student responses to CEs, students’ misunderstandings of chemistry models are uncovered. To determine the prevalence of links and facilitate implementation in large classes, the second tool termed Measure of Linked Concepts (MLCs) is developed and implemented in General Chemistry. MLCs provide similar prompts as CEs and also a series of statements developed from prior student responses to CEs. Students are asked to evaluate the legitimacy of these statements. Students’ performance on MLCs is examined and the results show that the majority of students show proficiency in prior knowledge. However, a sizeable proportion of students can’t recognize the situation where a chemistry model is misused. Student responses to the above two assessments (CEs and MLCs) provide evidence for linking chemistry concepts of students in General Chemistry, both correctly and incorrectly. They also serve as tools for showing the relevance of prior topics and subsequent topics throughout the course and communicating with students for learning chemistry as a theme instead of separated facts. Finally, text message inquires are used to explore student study habits in General Chemistry. Study habits are defined as the frequency and type of actions taken toward studying outside the classroom in this work. The evidence for the feasibility of using text <b>message</b> <b>inquiries</b> as a data collection tool and the validity of the collected data is presented. Students in General Chemistry are characterized as three clusters based on their study habits. The cluster of students who reported studying in addition to the required course material outperform the other two clusters of students, who knowingly do not study and who reported studying only required course materials. By tracking study habits of a common group of students, we observe the signs of adapting. In addition, study habits of students at-risk of failing the course based on incoming SAT scores are explored in this work. The results indicate both frequency and quality play a role in students’ academic performance, and quality may be more important than frequency. These results provide a path for at-risk students to improve success rates in General Chemistry...|$|R
