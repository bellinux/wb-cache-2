5|$|In July 2013, archaeologists {{found the}} remains of 44 submarines, {{including}} UB-17, off the United Kingdom's southern and east coasts, near the county of Suffolk. The find was made up mostly of vessels from the German Imperial Navy dating to World War I. Der Spiegel reported divers located 41 German U-boats, and three of English submarines, found at depths of up to 50 <b>feet,</b> <b>off</b> England's southern and eastern coasts.|$|E
5|$|In Washington, sea otters {{are found}} almost {{exclusively}} on the outer coasts. They can swim as close as six <b>feet</b> <b>off</b> shore along the Olympic coast. Reported sightings of sea otters in the San Juan Islands and Puget Sound almost always {{turn out to be}} North American river otters, which are commonly seen along the seashore. However, biologists have confirmed isolated sightings of sea otters in these areas since the mid-1990s.|$|E
5|$|The barren desert {{surface of}} Ceti Alpha V was {{simulated}} on stage 8, the largest sound stage at Paramount's studio. The set was elevated 25 <b>feet</b> <b>off</b> {{the ground and}} covered in wooden mats, over which tons of colored sand and powder were dumped. A cyclorama was painted and wrapped around the set, while massive industrial fans created a sandstorm. The filming was uncomfortable for actors and crew alike. The spandex environmental suits Koenig and Winfield wore were unventilated, and the actors had to signal by microphone when they needed air. Filming equipment was wrapped in plastic to prevent mechanical troubles and everyone on set wore boots, masks, and coveralls as protection from flying sand.|$|E

5|$|Prior to {{the main}} event match, Piper {{revealed}} that the fan humiliated by Lawler in the King's Court segment would be in Piper's corner during the match. Piper started the match by throwing his kilt in Lawler's face and attacking him. The match consisted mainly of brawling, and Lawler was frequently distracted by the fan who was standing in Piper's corner. Lawler gained the advantage by performing a sleeper hold and a piledriver on Piper. He attacked Piper with a foreign object, which knocked Piper to the mat. Then, while trying to pin Piper, Jerry Lawler placed {{his feet on the}} ropes for leverage. The fan at ringside pushed Lawler's <b>feet</b> <b>off,</b> however, which allowed Piper to perform a back suplex and get the victory.|$|E
5|$|Speaker {{guided the}} 1920 Indians {{to their first}} World Series win. In a crucial late season game against the second-place White Sox, Speaker caught a hard line drive hit to deep right-center field by Shoeless Joe Jackson, ending the game. On a dead run, Speaker leaped with both <b>feet</b> <b>off</b> the ground, snaring the ball before {{crashing}} into a concrete wall. As he lay unconscious from the impact, Speaker still held the baseball. In the 1920 World Series against Brooklyn, Speaker hit an RBI triple in the deciding game, which the Indians won 3–0. Cleveland's 1920 season was also significant due {{to the death of}} Ray Chapman on August 17. Chapman died after being hit in the head by a pitch from Carl Mays. Chapman had been asked about retirement before the season, {{and he said that he}} wanted to help Speaker earn Cleveland's first World Series victory before thinking of retirement.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} of the crashed plane, in which Hank discovers a dead pilot and the $4.4 million in cash, was filmed on a soundstage. A second plane, designed to have frosted windows, was attached to a gimbal, about five <b>feet</b> <b>off</b> the ground. To match the interior with footage shot in Wisconsin, the art department built a set with real trees and a painted backdrop. To depict Hank being attacked by a flock of crows inside the plane, puppets were used to attack Paxton as he appeared on screen, while two live crows were used to attack an animatronic replica of the actor. A separate soundstage was used to create two sets depicting the interiors of the Mitchell home, where Hank and his wife Sarah (Fonda) reside. The first set was the main floor an exterior entrance way, and the second was created for the upstairs bedrooms. Principal photography concluded on March 13, 1998, after 55 days of filming.|$|E

5|$|The {{next night}} at 1945 hrs, a craft {{similar to the}} one the night before {{approached}} the base. In addition to being tracked on radar, it hovered around the area for 30 minutes, with characteristics of movement similar to a helicopter. Additionally, it hovered above the weapons storage area at the same altitude as the night before. At this time, possibly another object (it is unclear if it was the same one as the over the weapons storage area, but it is possible) was spotted over the flightline. The cigar-shaped object was described as hovering in mid-air, jerking around, and turning on and off its lights once. During the blackout, it traveled from the flightline, to the northern end of the runway. According to one service member, the object was chased, and eventually discovered to be hovering five <b>feet</b> <b>off</b> the ground. During this time, it was determined that the object was four car lengths long.|$|E
5|$|The second Avrocar had logged about 75 {{flight hours}} {{at the end of}} the flight testing. Judged by its performance, the Avrocar was an abject failure: it couldn't lift itself safely more than a few <b>feet</b> <b>off</b> the ground, and its bulbous design {{limiting}} high-speed performance accompanied by unbearable heat and screaming exhaust noise, made it impractical for the military. Although considered a technical failure, its design would be prophetic: it was a rubber skirt shy of being one of the world's first hovercraft, the Saunders Roe SR.N1 also taking off in 1959. Nevertheless, company designer John Frost applied for a number of patents in Canada, the UK and the U.S. that established the pivotal role that the Avrocar and related Avro experimental vehicles made in the VTOL world.|$|E
5|$|There {{are four}} rounds in a match of Blitz, where two teams of four {{computer}} or human players score points for each energized Blitz disc thrown through their opponent's hoop, which is eight <b>feet</b> <b>off</b> the ground. Players pass and travel with the disc across the arenas, {{and the game}} continues without pause between points scored. The team with the most points {{at the end of}} a match wins. Players can choose to brawl when not scoring points. Fighting depletes character health, depending on who takes the blows. Once his health is completely depleted, a character is removed from the game, and teams with all players knocked out are disqualified (though players can be substituted between rounds). If a player tends towards belligerence, the game's artificial intelligence will compensate and exact revenge for its teammates. Friendly fire, where teammates can intentionally or inadvertently hurt each other with attacks meant for their opponents, is permitted.|$|E

5|$|While {{moving slowly}} {{for a few}} days, Hurricane Fernanda {{produced}} high surf along the eastern shores of the Hawaiian Islands. The rough waves prompted the closure of several beaches in Maui and the Big Island. Wave heights reached 10 to 15 feet (3 to 4.5 m) in most places, while portions of Maui experienced up to 20 foot (6 m) waves. The surf damaged coastal roads along most of the islands, and some homes were flooded. One home in Maui was moved several <b>feet</b> <b>off</b> of its foundation due to the waves. In the harbor at Hilo, one boat was damaged and another was destroyed, and in the Puna district, 12 homes were damaged. Although the hurricane remained away from the islands, moisture from Fernanda combined with an upper-level trough to produce rainfall across the state. Precipitation was heaviest in Kauai, where some minor flooding was reported. After Fernanda became extratropical in the shipping lanes of the north Pacific, several vessels reported gale force winds.|$|E
25|$|Some penny-farthing riders {{used only}} back {{pedalling}} and got off {{and walked down}} steep hills, but most also used a brake. Having a brake meant that riders could coast down hill by taking their <b>feet</b> <b>off</b> the pedals and placing the legs over the handlebars, although most riders preferred to dismount and walk down steep hills. Putting the legs under the handlebars with the <b>feet</b> <b>off</b> the pedals placed on foot-rests on the forks had resulted in serious accidents caused by the feet getting caught in the spokes.|$|E
