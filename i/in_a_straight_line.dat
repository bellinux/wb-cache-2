5|$|Based on the {{arrangement}} of effects in New England, meteorologist William C. Redfield deduced that the wind field and center of tropical cyclones are circular; previously the winds {{were believed to be}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>straight</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E
5|$|Linear motions (or {{translatory}} motions), which {{move in a}} {{line between}} two points. Rectilinear motion is motion <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>straight</b> <b>line</b> between two points, whereas curvilinear motion is motion following a curved path.|$|E

50|$|In 1847 the London and South Western Railway {{opened its}} line between Bishopstoke in Hampshire and Milford station at Salisbury, {{following}} {{the route of}} the canal but <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>straighter</b> <b>line.</b> The railway remains open as part of the Wessex Main Line from Salisbury to Southampton.|$|R
50|$|The pier's {{construction}} {{took over}} 40 years (1854-1895). In 1898 the original curved design proved inadequate against a great storm and the centre section was destroyed. The pier was rebuilt <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>straighter</b> <b>line</b> and completed <b>in</b> 1909. <b>A</b> companion pier at South Shields protects the southern {{flank of the}} river mouth.|$|R

5|$|Galileo {{put forward}} the basic {{principle}} of relativity, {{that the laws}} of physics are the same in any system that is moving at a constant speed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>straight</b> <b>line,</b> regardless of its particular speed or direction. Hence, there is no absolute motion or absolute rest. This principle provided the basic framework for Newton's laws of motion and is central to Einstein's special theory of relativity.|$|E
5|$|Green rosellas are {{generally}} encountered in pairs or small groups, though young birds may gather {{in groups of}} 20 or more outside the breeding season. They sometimes share the company of eastern rosellas. They fly <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>straight</b> <b>line,</b> making rapid shallow wingbeats and gliding briefly in between.|$|E
5|$|That {{road was}} built {{due to the}} threat of American attack to provide quick access from Fort Erie, and, like other {{military}} roads in Upper Canada (e.g. Dundas Street or Yonge Street), it travelled <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>straight</b> <b>line,</b> in this case parallel to the Lake Erie shoreline.|$|E
25|$|As an object's {{speed or}} {{momentum}} increases, arcs tend to flatten out in moving ahead and broaden in turns. <b>In</b> baseball, <b>a</b> fastball {{would tend to}} move <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>straighter</b> <b>line</b> than other pitches; while a figure skater moving at top speed {{would be unable to}} turn as sharply as a slower skater, and would need to cover more ground to complete the turn.|$|R
50|$|The male of {{the eastern}} form is even whiter in summer than the western bird, but as a rule may be {{distinguished}} by the line which extends across {{the base of the}} bill. Black-throated individuals of this race have a greater amount of black on the throat and face than on the western birds, and the black generally terminates more abruptly or <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>straighter</b> <b>line.</b>|$|R

5|$|A worm whose ruleset {{begins with}} 0 {{continues}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>straight</b> <b>line</b> forever. This is a trivial case, {{so it is}} usually stipulated that the worm must turn when it encounters a point with only uneaten gridlines. Furthermore, to avoid mirror-image symmetrical duplicates, the worm's first turn must be a right hand turn. A worm dies if it returns to its origin a third time, because there are then no untraversed edges available. Only the origin can be lethal to the worm.|$|E
5|$|Flies tend to fly <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>straight</b> <b>line</b> {{then make}} a rapid change in {{direction}} before continuing on a different straight path. The directional changes are called saccades and typically involve an angle of 90°, being achieved in 50 milliseconds. They are initiated by visual stimuli as the fly observes an object, nerves then activate steering muscles in the thorax that cause a small change in wing stroke which generate sufficient torque to turn. Detecting this within four or five wingbeats, the halteres trigger a counter-turn and the fly heads off in a new direction.|$|E
5|$|The {{strategy}} {{appears to}} work equally well in insects and in vertebrates. Simulations show that motion camouflage {{results in a}} more efficient pursuit path than classical pursuit (i.e. the motion camouflage path is shorter), whether the target flies <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>straight</b> <b>line</b> or chooses a chaotic path. Further, where classical pursuit requires the attacker to fly faster than the target, the motion camouflaged attacker can sometimes capture the target despite flying more slowly than it.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of {{increased}} sales of hybrid electric vehicles in several countries, {{some members of the}} blind community have raised concerns about the noise reduction when those vehicles operate in all-electric mode, as blind people or the visually impaired consider the noise of combustion engines a helpful aid while crossing streets and feel quiet hybrids could pose an unexpected hazard. Although a 2009 study found no statistically significant difference in pedestrian crashes involving quiet hybrid vehicles when compared to noisier vehicles when both types of vehicles were travelling <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>straight</b> <b>line,</b> it found a doubling of hybrid vehicle pedestrian crashes when reversing or parking etc. at slow speeds.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of its decommissioning, Highway44 began at a {{junction}} with Highway15 (Christian Street) {{on the west side of}} Almonte. It crossed the Mississippi River, where it became Main Street and passed through the central portion of the town. In the eastern edge of Almonte, it was known Ottawa Street until Appleton Sideroad, where it became March Road and continued eastward <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>straight</b> <b>line</b> through farmland in the Ottawa Valley. It also passed through several forests as well as south of Greensmere Golf and Country Club before meeting what was then Highway17 at an intersection but is now an interchange with Highway417 (Exit155).|$|E
5|$|Ellie Victoria Cole {{was born}} in the Melbourne suburb of Lilydale on 12 December 1991. Her mother and {{grandfather}} were both swimmers, and her father was athletic. At two years of age, she was diagnosed with a rare tumour, a sarcoma that was wrapped around the nerves of her right leg. After unsuccessful attempts to treat her cancer with chemotherapy, her right leg was amputated above the knee on 14 February 1994. Eight weeks after the surgery, as part of her rehabilitation, Cole's mother Jenny enrolled her in swimming lessons. Cole's instructors expected her to take up to a year to learn how to swim <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>straight</b> <b>line,</b> but it took her two weeks.|$|E

5|$|Grant {{continued}} his coaching {{success in the}} NFL as he took over from original coach, Norm Van Brocklin. Over his tenure as Vikings head coach, Grant was known for instilling discipline in his teams and displaying a lack of emotion during games. He believed that football is a game of controlled emotion and teams would not follow the coach's lead {{if he were to}} panic or lose his poise {{during the course of a}} game. He required his team to stand at attention <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>straight</b> <b>line</b> during the entire national anthem played before the game and even had national anthem practice. Grant required outdoor practice during the winter to get players used to the cold weather and would not allow heaters on the sidelines during games.|$|E
5|$|In 1975, {{the first}} year of pipelaying, Alyeska set a goal of {{completing}} 45 percent of the 800-mile route. This would not be laid <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>straight</b> <b>line,</b> since it was expected that river crossings would take longer to complete than portions of the pipeline on dry land. Work on the pumping stations and the Valdez Marine Terminal, which had begun in the fall of 1974, also was expected to take longer than laying pipe. Conversely, work on those two projects could proceed during the winter, when pipelaying could not take place due to the frozen ground.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} shown that the couple created by gravity and the ground {{reaction}} forces is necessary for a bicycle to turn at all. On a custom built bicycle with spring-loaded outriggers that exactly cancel this couple, so that the bicycle and rider may assume any lean angle when traveling <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>straight</b> <b>line,</b> riders find it impossible to make a turn. As soon as the wheels deviate from a straight path, the bicycle and rider begin to lean in the opposite direction, {{and the only way to}} right them is to steer back onto the straight path.|$|E
50|$|Typically, {{a circle}} route will connect at several {{locations}} {{with one or}} more cross-city routes or radial routes offering services <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>straighter</b> <b>line</b> into or out of a city or town centre. When a circle route orbits <b>a</b> CBD <b>in</b> <b>a</b> large arc, it will often provide transverse (or lateral) links between suburbs or satellites, either on its own or in combination with other routes. Such connections assist travelers by reducing travel times, avoiding congested CBD centers, and sometimes reducing the number of transfers. Similar benefits may also be achieved by half circle routes or peripheral cross-city routes.|$|R

5|$|SR 11 {{continues}} {{north toward}} Ashtabula, meeting interchanges for SR 82 and an access {{road to the}} Youngstown-Warren Regional Airport. Urban areas transition back into rural areas here. It later intersects SR 305 and SR 5 at diamond interchanges near Cortland. The route then enters Ashtabula County, and travels <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>straight</b> <b>line,</b> passing through US 322, a rest area, US 6, and SR 307. Mostly forests and fields are between the highway. The route slowly bends northwest, and meets I-90 at a cloverleaf interchange. The route crosses over Ashtabula River, and bypasses Ashtabula. It ends at SR 531, part of the Lake Erie Circle Tour, at a stop sign.|$|E
5|$|SR364 {{starts at}} SR705, on the Darke–Shelby county line. The route goes north <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>straight</b> <b>line,</b> through of Mercer County, and {{continues}} onto the Auglaize–Shelby county line. SR364 continues into Auglaize County, where it passes by the St. Joseph Catholic Church, a historic site. The highway intersects SR119 in Minister and SR274 in New Bremen. Later, SR364 intersects SR219, and travels northeast, {{adjacent to the}} eastern side of the Grand Lake. Here, the farmland transitions into forests. The route meets at an T-intersection with SR703. The SR364 and SR703 concurrency travels northwestward, and SR364 splits and heads north, after slightly more than a mile. SR364 crosses a railroad track, and ends at an diamond interchange at SR29. The road continues as County Road15 after this point.|$|E
5|$|Swimming {{behavior}} in mantas differs across habitats: when travelling over deep water, they swim {{at a constant}} rate <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>straight</b> <b>line,</b> while further inshore they usually bask or swim idly around. Mantas may travel alone or in groups of up to 50. They may associate with other fish species as well as sea birds and marine mammals. Mantas sometimes breach, leaping partially or entirely out of the water. Individuals in a group may make aerial jumps one after the other. These leaps come in three forms: forward leaps where the fish lands head first, similar jumps with a tail first re-entry or somersaults. The reason for breaching is not known; possible explanations include mating rituals, birthing, communication, or the removal of parasites and commensal remoras (suckerfish).|$|E
50|$|In the {{petroleum}} industry, true vertical depth, abbreviated as TVD, is the measurement {{from the surface}} {{to the bottom of}} the borehole (or anywhere along its length) <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>straight</b> perpendicular <b>line</b> represented by line (<b>a)</b> <b>in</b> the image.|$|R

3000|$|The Pearson {{correlation}} coefficient {{is the most}} commonly used correlation method to measure a two-way linear correlation, calculated by dividing covariance of two variables by the product of their standard deviations’. Its value is represented by (r_xy) <b>in</b> <b>a</b> range between −  1 and 1. If the points (x_i, y_i [...]) are <b>in</b> <b>a</b> perfect <b>straight</b> <b>line</b> and the slope of that line is positive, (r_xy)= 1. If the points are <b>in</b> <b>a</b> perfect <b>straight</b> <b>line</b> and the slope is negative, (r_xy) = - 1. If there is no systematic relation between X and Y at all, (r_xy) ≃ 0, and (r_xy) differs from zero only because of random variation in the sample points.|$|R
