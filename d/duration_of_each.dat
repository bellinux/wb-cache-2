5|$|The {{depth and}} <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> stop is {{calculated}} {{to reduce the}} inert gas excess in the most critical tissues to a concentration which will allow further ascent without unacceptable risk. Consequently, {{if there is not}} much dissolved gas, the stops will be shorter and shallower than if there is a high concentration. The length of the stops is also strongly influenced by which tissue compartments are assessed as highly saturated. High concentrations in slow tissues will indicate longer stops than similar concentrations in fast tissues.|$|E

5|$|The <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> touring {{show was}} {{traditionally}} {{split into two}} acts of an hour each separated by a 30-minute interval; however, as of 2014, due to cost cutting issues, the shows have now {{been reduced to a}} shorter 55-minute first act followed by a 50-minute second act, still including a 30-minute interval. Permanent shows are usually 90 minutes in length without any intermission. This excludes Joyà (the permanent show in Riviera Maya, Mexico), which is only 70 minutes in length. Typically touring shows as well as resident shows perform a standard 10 shows a week. Touring shows usually have one 'dark day' (with no performances) while resident shows have two.|$|E
5|$|The brain {{controls}} {{the rate of}} breathing, mainly by respiratory centres in the medulla and pons. The respiratory centres control respiration, by generating motor signals that are passed down the spinal cord, along the phrenic nerve to the diaphragm and other muscles of respiration. This is a mixed nerve that carries sensory information back to the centres. There are four respiratory centres, three with a more clearly defined function, and an apneustic centre with a less clear function. In the medulla a dorsal respiratory group causes the desire to breathe in and receives sensory information directly from the body. Also in the medulla, the ventral respiratory group influences breathing out during exertion. In the pons the pneumotaxic centre influences the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> breath, and the apneustic centre seems to have an influence on inhalation. The respiratory centres directly senses blood carbon dioxide and pH. Information about blood oxygen, carbon dioxide and pH levels are also sensed {{on the walls of}} arteries in the peripheral chemoreceptors of the aortic and carotid bodies. This information is passed via the vagus and glossopharyngeal nerves to the respiratory centres. High carbon dioxide, an acidic pH, or low oxygen stimulate the respiratory centres. The desire to breathe in is also affected by pulmonary stretch receptors in the lungs which, when activated, prevent the lungs from overinflating by transmitting information to the respiratory centres via the vagus nerve.|$|E

40|$|A {{study is}} {{reported}} of {{the perception of}} random-dot two-frame apparent motion in which the <b>durations</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> exposure and the interstimulus interval between them were varied.

30|$|Time-{{cooperative}} jamming can {{be divided}} into time-synchronized cooperative jamming and time-circulating cooperative jamming according to the different interference <b>durations</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> jammer. Time-synchronized cooperative jamming means that the radar would be simultaneously deceived by each jammer during the penetration process. Time-circulating cooperative jamming refers to the jamming mode in which the radar would be deceived by each jammer in turn, and the interference formed at the radar spans the entire jamming period. The jammer is turned on to deceive the radar when the protected target reaches the vicinity of the jammer.|$|R
25|$|A simple example: If one sends {{a million}} symbols per second using {{conventional}} single-carrier modulation over a wireless channel, then the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> symbol {{would be one}} microsecond or less. This imposes severe constraints on synchronization and necessitates the removal of multipath interference. If the same million symbols per second are spread among one thousand sub-channels, the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> symbol can be longer {{by a factor of}} a thousand (i.e., one millisecond) for orthogonality with approximately the same bandwidth. Assume that a guard interval of 1/8 of the symbol length is inserted between each symbol. Intersymbol interference can be avoided if the multipath time-spreading (the time between the reception of the first and the last echo) is shorter than the guard interval (i.e., 125 microseconds). This corresponds to a maximum difference of 37.5 kilometers between the lengths of the paths.|$|E

25|$|One key {{principle}} of OFDM {{is that since}} low symbol rate modulation schemes (i.e., where the symbols are relatively long compared to the channel time characteristics) suffer less from intersymbol interference caused by multipath propagation, it is advantageous to transmit a number of low-rate streams in parallel instead of a single high-rate stream. Since the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> symbol is long, it is feasible to insert a guard interval between the OFDM symbols, thus eliminating the intersymbol interference.|$|E
25|$|To help redress these losses, {{a number}} of minor Crusading expeditions left Europe for the East. The {{abortive}} Crusade of Louis IX of France to Tunis in 1270 was one such attempt. The minor Ninth Crusade of Prince Edward (later King Edward I) of England in 1271–1272 was another. Neither of these expeditions was capable of giving any sound assistance to the beleaguered Latin states.

40|$|The <b>durations</b> <b>of</b> syllabic {{intervals}} in sentences {{with different}} rhythmic structure were examined. Rhythmic structure {{was defined as}} the organization of stressed and unstressed syllables into metrical feet- in this case, iambs and anapests. Each sentence contained three metrical feet, and each foot could be either an iamb or an anapest; hence, there were eight sentences of different rhythm types. Six native speakers <b>of</b> American English <b>each</b> read 24 versions <b>of</b> <b>each</b> <b>of</b> the 8 rhyth. m types (192 sentences). The utterances were recorded and the <b>durations</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> syllable <b>of</b> <b>each</b> foot were measured from sound spectrograms. Statistical analysis indicated that the <b>durations</b> <b>of</b> some syllables were affected by the structure of the foot that containcd them. There was also, in most cases, a significant shortening of the stressed syllable of a foot when the following foot was an anapest rather than an iamb. The results were interpreted as indicating that the process by which speech is produced is not strictly concatenative but involves planning which extends to at least two metrical feet at a time.

25|$|The most {{comprehensive}} early study of binocular rivalry {{was conducted by}} B. B. Breese (1899, 1909). Breese quantified the amount of rivalry by requiring his observers to press keys while observing rivalry for 100-second trials. An observer pressed one key whenever and {{for as long as}} he or she saw one rival stimulus with no trace of the other, and another key whenever and {{for as long as he}} or she saw the other rival stimulus with no trace of the first. This has come to be known as recording periods of exclusive visibility. From the key-press records (Breese's were made on a kymograph drum), Breese was able to quantify rivalry in three ways: the number of periods of exclusive visibility of each stimulus (the rate of rivalry), the total duration of exclusive visibility of each stimulus, and the average <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> period of rivalry.|$|E
500|$|The {{depth and}} <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> stop is {{dependent}} on many factors, primarily the profile of depth and time of the dive, but also the breathing gas mix, the interval since the previous dive and the altitude of the dive site. The diver obtains the depth and <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> stop from a dive computer, decompression tables or dive planning computer software. A technical scuba diver will typically prepare more than one decompression schedule to plan for contingencies such as going deeper than planned or spending longer at depth than planned. Recreational divers often rely on a personal dive computer {{to allow them to}} avoid obligatory decompression, while allowing considerable flexibility of dive profile. [...] A surface supplied diver will normally have a diving supervisor at the control point who monitors the dive profile and can adjust the schedule to suit any contingencies as they occur.|$|E
30|$|An HMM and a {{duration}} {{model for}} each state are first learned for <b>each</b> segment <b>of</b> the training set.

The observation vectors consist of static and dynamic parameters, that is, the values of articulatory parameters and their temporal derivatives. The HMM parameter estimation is based on Maximum-Likelihood (ML) criterion [22]. Usually, for each phoneme in context, a 3 -state left-to-right model is estimated with single Gaussian diagonal output distributions. The state <b>durations</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> HMM are usually modeled as single Gaussian distributions. A second training step can also be added to factor out similar output distributions among the entire set of states, that is, state tying. This step is not used here.|$|R
