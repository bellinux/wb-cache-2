40|$|<b>Katabatic</b> <b>winds</b> {{dramatically}} {{affect the}} climate of the McMurdo dry valleys, Antarctica. Winter wind events can increase local air temperatures by 30 °C. The frequency of <b>katabatic</b> <b>winds</b> largely controls winter (June to August) temperatures, increasing 1 °C per 1 % increase in katabatic frequency, and it overwhelms the effect of topographic elevation (lapse rate). Summer <b>katabatic</b> <b>winds</b> are important, but their influence on summer temperature is less. The spatial distribution of <b>katabatic</b> <b>winds</b> varies significantly. Winter events increase by 14 % for every 10 km up valley toward the ice sheet, and summer events increase by 3 %. The spatial distribution of katabatic frequency seems to be partly controlled by inversions. The relatively slow propagation speed of a katabatic front compared to its wind speed suggests a highly turbulent flow. The apparent wind skip (down-valley stations can be affected before up-valley ones) {{may be caused by}} flow deflection in the complex topography and by flow over inversions, which eventually break down. A strong return flow occurs at down-valley stations prior to onset of the <b>katabatic</b> <b>winds</b> and after they dissipate. Although the onset and termination of the <b>katabatic</b> <b>winds</b> are typically abrupt, elevated air temperatures remain for days afterward. We estimate that current frequencies of <b>katabatic</b> <b>winds</b> increase annual average temperatures by 0. 7 ° to 2. 2 °C, depending on location. Seasonally, they increase (decrease) winter average temperatures (relative humidity) by 0. 8 ° to 4. 2 ° (− 1. 8 to − 8. 5 %) and summer temperatures by 0. 1 ° to 0. 4 °C (− 0. 9 % to − 4. 1 %). Long-term changes of dry valley air temperatures cannot be understood without knowledge of changes in <b>katabatic</b> <b>winds...</b>|$|R

500|$|Daytime {{heating and}} {{nighttime}} cooling of the hilly slopes lead to day to night {{variations in the}} airflow, similar {{to the relationship between}} sea breeze and land breeze.

[...] This is known a <b>katabatic</b> <b>wind</b> or mountain breeze. [...] If the slopes are covered with ice and snow, the <b>katabatic</b> <b>wind</b> will blow during the day, carrying the cold dense air into the warmer, barren valleys.

40|$|The {{wind regime}} at Syowa Station, {{located on the}} East Ongul Island 4 km apart from the coast of Antarctica, is {{analyzed}} to explain the seaward effect of <b>katabatic</b> <b>winds.</b> 1. Rather strong (6 - 17 m/s) easterly <b>winds</b> of <b>katabatic</b> origin prevail at night in summer season. The type of diurnal variation of wind velocity, then, {{is quite different from}} the ordinary type observed at middle to lower latitudes. 2. Disturbances of synoptic scale often destroys such a diurnal variation, though weak disturbances sometimes accelerate the night-time <b>winds</b> of <b>katabatic</b> origin. 3. <b>Winds</b> of <b>katabatic</b> origin can be distinguished from those by synoptic scale disturbances through the following points : (a) Regularity of the time of onset and end. (b) Decrease in temperature with increase in wind velocity. (c) A slight clockwise deviation of wind direction compared with the prevailing direction by synoptic scale phenomena. 4. The diurnal variation of wind velocity vanishes in winter season, when the persistent northeast-easterly <b>winds</b> of <b>katabatic</b> origin blow day and night. These winds, in most cases in winter, are associated with the synoptic scale disturbances, and it is difficult to distinguish pure <b>katabatic</b> <b>winds</b> from the latter. 5. Typical behaviours of <b>katabatic</b> <b>winds,</b> as exemplified by the sudden onset and end, abrupt changes in pressure and extraordinary intensity of winds, are not observed at Syowa Station where the phenomena are generally mild compared with those at other Antarctic stations. It is supposed that the location of Syowa Station is at about the critical distance of the seaward effect of <b>katabatic</b> <b>winds,</b> so that the effect reaches Syowa Station only when the conditions on the ice slope of the continent are favourable enough to cause the katabatic "type 2 " in BALL 2 ̆ 7 S theory, and that the base is covered with the seaward moving air of higher depth beyond the hydraulic jump line. 6.

40|$|In {{a valley}} {{sheltered}} from strong synoptic effects, {{the dynamics of}} the valley atmosphere at night is dominated by <b>katabatic</b> <b>winds.</b> In a stably stratified atmosphere, these winds undergo temporal oscillations, whose frequency is given by for an infinitely long slope of constant slope angle, being the buoyancy frequency. Such an unsteady flow in a stably stratified atmosphere may also generate internal gravity waves (IGWs). The numerical study by Chemel et al. (Meteorol Atmos Phys 203 : 187 - 194, 2009) showed that, in the stable atmosphere of a deep valley, the oscillatory motions associated with the IGWs generated by <b>katabatic</b> <b>winds</b> are distinct from those of the <b>katabatic</b> <b>winds.</b> The IGW frequency was found to be independent of and about. Their study did not consider the effects of the background stratification and valley geometry on these results. The present work extends this study by investigating those effects {{for a wide range of}} stratifications and slope angles, through numerical simulations for a deep valley. The two oscillatory systems are reproduced in the simulations. The frequency of the oscillations of the <b>katabatic</b> <b>winds</b> is found to be equal to times the sine of the maximum slope angle. Remarkably, the IGW frequency is found to also vary as, with in the range -. These values for are similar to those reported for IGWs radiated by any turbulent field with no dominant frequency component. Results suggest that the IGW wavelength is controlled by the valley depth...|$|R
40|$|A {{correction}} for <b>katabatic</b> <b>winds</b> and {{polar easterlies}} is developed {{to deal with}} their dramatic underestimation by the atmospheric component of a coarse-resolution global coupled climate model. This correction relies on a comparison of the atmospheric surface circulation simulated by the model with the one provided by a regional atmospheric model, and consists of wind stress modifications {{in the vicinity of the}} Antarctic coast. Corrections are spatially varying and different for both wind components. The impacts of the correction on the modelled Antarctic sea ice and World Ocean's properties on long timescales are assessed, showing that <b>katabatic</b> <b>winds</b> thin sea ice and strongly enhance its production along the continent. Consequently, the formation rate, salinity and temperature of the Antarctic Bottom Water are increased. This leads to model results in better agreement with observations, especially in the deep ocean where the mean errors in temperature and salinity decrease by 9 % and 37 %, respectively. Hence, correcting <b>katabatic</b> <b>winds</b> seems to be an appropriate way to improve the representation of sea ice-related surface processes around Antarctica. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

40|$|Five {{winter months}} (April-August 1988) of thermal {{infrared}} satellite images were examined {{to investigate the}} occurrence of dark (warm) signatures across the Ross Ice Shelf in the Antarctic continent. These features are inferred to be generated by <b>katabatic</b> <b>winds</b> that descend from southern Marie Byrd Land and then blow horizontally across the ice shelf. Significant mass is added to this airstream by <b>katabatic</b> <b>winds</b> blowing from the major glaciers that flow through the Transantarctic Mountains from East Antarctica. These negatively buoyant <b>katabatic</b> <b>winds</b> can reach the northwestern edge of the shelf - a horizontal propagation distance of up to 1, 000 km - 14 percent of the time. Where the airstream crosses from the ice shelf to the ice-covered Ross Sea, a prominent coastal polynya is formed. Because the downslope buoyancy force is near zero over the Ross Ice Shelf, the northwestward propagation of the katabatic air mass requires pressure gradient support. The study shows that the extended horizontal propagation of this atmospheric density current occurred {{in conjunction with the}} passage of synoptic cyclones over the southern Amundsen Sea. These cyclones can strengthen the pressure gradient in the interior of West Antarctica and make the pressure field favorable for northwestward movement of the <b>katabatic</b> <b>winds</b> from West Antarctica across the ice shelf in a geostrophic direction. The glacier winds from East Antarctica are further accelerated by the synoptic pressure gradient, usually undergo abrupt adjustment beyond the exit to the glacier valley, and merge into the mountain-parallel katabatic air mass...|$|R
