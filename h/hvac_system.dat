5|$|Energy {{efficient}} and sustainability features designed {{into the project}} led to a LEED Gold certification from the U.S. Green Building Council. Elements {{that led to this}} include landscaping that reduces runoff from rainwater, lots of natural light, a more efficient <b>HVAC</b> <b>system</b> that is located under the floors, and a location near public transit. Landscaping includes using drought resistant native species to reduce the need for irrigation. The floor-based <b>HVAC</b> <b>system</b> is more energy {{efficient and}} helps keep the temperature of the entire building more even and uses radiant heating and cooling. Additionally, the construction used environmentally friendly sealants, carpets, paints, and adhesives as well as preventing 90% of the construction waste from entering landfills. Also, potable water usage is reduced by 40% due to the use of low-flow sinks, showers, and toilets. The contractor also recycled 90% of the materials from the building that previously occupied the site.|$|E

Rosecroft drew 400 to 500 patrons on its opening day.

40|$|<b>HVAC</b> <b>systems</b> are {{the major}} energy {{consumers}} in buildings. Operation and control of <b>HVAC</b> <b>systems</b> have significant impacts on the energy or cost efficiency of buildings besides their designs. Buildings nowadays are mostly equipped with comprehensive building automation systems (BASs) and building energy management control systems (EMCSs) that allow the possibility of enhancing and optimizing the operation and control of <b>HVAC</b> <b>systems.</b> Supervisory and optimal control, which addresses the energy or cost-efficient control of <b>HVAC</b> <b>systems</b> while providing the desired indoor comfort and healthy environment under the dynamic working conditions, is attracting more attention of the building professionals and the society and provides incentives to make more efforts in developing more extensive and robust control methods for <b>HVAC</b> <b>systems.</b> This paper provides a framework for categorizing the main supervisory and optimal control methods and optimization techniques developed and/or utilized in the HVAC field.

25|$|In February 2010, Dr. Cheryl K. Crawley, Great Falls Public Schools Superintendent, {{established}} {{a task force}} to study the physical plant at GFHS. The task force's charge is to recommend improvements and changes to the buildings, grounds, and physical plant of the high school so that the school can continue to provide a high-quality education while remaining at near-capacity in terms of enrollment. Dr. Crawley's report noted that GFHS currently has dining facilities too small for the size of the student body; requires students, faculty, staff, and the public to walk outdoors during winter weather to move between buildings (a safety hazard); does not integrate the South Campus with the Upper Campus; lacks an adequate <b>HVAC</b> <b>system</b> (particularly in moving fresh air into the interior, as well as moving air around inside the building); cannot accommodate high-bandwidth computer or phone lines; and has poor cell phone, television, and radio reception. The building also lacks zoned heat regulation, which makes some areas of the building too hot and others too cold and reduces energy efficiency. School officials also say the Old Gym <b>HVAC</b> <b>system</b> is not functioning well, there are aging light fixtures throughout the building, and the hallways on the second and third floors are dark. Additionally, student traffic flows throughout the building are poor (especially in the skywalk leading to the industrial arts annex), and the industrial arts annex suffers from safety problems.|$|E

The car's body panels were made of plastic rather than metal, making the car lightweight and dent resistant. The vehicle was fitted with Anti-lock brakes and a traction control system.

It included a 6MW Thermax air conditioning (cooling) vapour absorption machine (VAM). The £6m <b>HVAC</b> <b>system</b> reduced energy costs by 35%, and paid for itself within three years. A second turbine was added, without a second chimney. However, in 2008 the BBC admitted that the energy system was being used for emergency purposes only as it had become cost-ineffective to use full-time. Excess electricity produced at night has not been returned to the National Grid, as originally planned. In November 2003, the turbine's chimneys caught fire, bringing TV output to a halt.

25|$|The <b>HVAC</b> <b>system</b> uses an AC {{induction}} motor {{to drive a}} sealed-system scroll compressor, a design principle not usually used in automotive applications. Using a scroll compressor increases {{the efficiency of the}} system, while driving it with an AC {{induction motor}} makes the system more flexible, so the AC can run while the engine is off. Because the oil used with the refrigerant gas also flows {{in the area of the}} high-voltage motor-windings, the fluid must be electrically insulating to avoid transmitting electric current to exposed metal parts of the system. Therefore, Toyota specifies a POE oil (designated ND11) is required for repairs. The system cannot be serviced with equipment normally employed for regular cars, which typically use PAG oils, as the equipment would contaminate the ND11 oil with PAG oil. According to SAE J2843 the oil provided from maintenance equipment must contain less than 0.1% PAG when filling. One percent PAG oil may result in an electrical resistance drop by a factor of about 10.|$|E

500|$|The {{exterior}} of the building was also radically changed. The celebrated key visual feature of the building, its exterior vertical white marble ribbing, was completely removed after it {{was found to be}} bowed from age and weather. Although this fundamentally changed the nature of Durrell's building, there was almost no public outcry. It was replaced by an energy-efficient, all-glass facade. Perhaps the most significant renovation feature was the structure's use of a chilled beam <b>HVAC</b> <b>system,</b> which uses chilled or heated water circulated in strategically placed columns in the interior space to cool and warm the building. To test the efficiency of the chilled beam technology, the system was installed in the penthouse of the building and tested for a full year. The architect agreed to use the system after the test outperformed specifications. The installation represented the first large-scale use of the chilled beam technology in the United States. Other energy-saving enhancements included motion and daylight detectors to turn lights off when not needed, and special exterior windows which automatically dim to prevent daytime heating. The building's ventilation system was also upgraded. The renovation left the structure with [...] of interior space. The final cost of the renovation was pegged at $250 million.|$|E
