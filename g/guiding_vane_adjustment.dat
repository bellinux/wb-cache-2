The three-dimensional time-averaged incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are adopted to numerically simulate the internal flow field of a tubular pump with fixed and adjustable <b>guide</b> <b>vanes,</b> respectively.

40|$|In {{this project}} two pump mode tests {{has been carried}} out on a model RPT in the Waterpower Laboratory at NTNU. The {{measurement}} set up and execution of the tests were the same, except for the method of dissipating energy in the system. In the first test one of the feed pumps in the basement was used as energy dissipator. In the second test a throttle valve was used as energy dissipator. The objective has been to see how the Waterpower Laboratory is suited for such a test. It was also important to test the two different dissipation methods and evaluate which should be preferred when performing a pump mode test. During the tests it was observed that the <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> angle kept changing. When the results were processed it became evident that the variations in <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> angle during the tests had a big influence on the measured pump curves. Variations in <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> angle has not previously been observed during turbine mode testing. It is presumed that the variation in <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> angles is due to play in the <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> system and the design of the <b>guide</b> <b>vanes.</b> The <b>guide</b> <b>vanes</b> are Francis vanes, and not RPT vanes. It is assumed that it is the sharp trailing edge of the <b>guide</b> <b>vanes</b> that causes turbulence over the vanes in pump mode, thus making the <b>guide</b> <b>vanes</b> move about within the play of the <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> system.

Due to the tip clearance of the <b>guide</b> <b>vanes</b> and the defect of the traditional <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> profiles, the mass flow regulation of VIGV is limited, resulting in a large waste of compressed gas.

40|$|Numerical {{simulations}} {{were performed}} to investigate pressure fluctuations in the S-shaped region of a pump-turbine model. Analyses focused on pressure fluctuations in the draft tube and in {{the gap between the}} <b>guide</b> <b>vanes</b> and runner. Calculations were made under six different operating conditions with a constant <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> opening, and the best efficiency point, runaway point, and low-discharge point in the turbine brake zone were determined. The simulated results were compared with experimental measurements. In the draft tube, a twin vortex rope was observed. In the gap between the <b>guide</b> <b>vanes</b> and runner, a low frequency component was captured at both the runaway and low-discharge points in the turbine brake zone, which rotated at 65 % of the runner frequency. This low frequency component was induced by the rotating stall phenomenon. At the runaway point, a single stall cell was found in the gap between the <b>guide</b> <b>vanes</b> and runner, while at the low-discharge point, four stall cells were observed...|$|R
40|$|CFD {{analysis}} of the flow within a high-swirl lean premixed gas turbine combustor and over the 1 st row nozzle <b>guide</b> <b>vanes</b> is presented. The focus of the investigation is the fluid dynamics at the combustor/turbine interface {{and its impact on}} the turbine. For the configuration in question, temperature indicating paint observations of the nozzle <b>guide</b> <b>vanes,</b> acquired during engine development tests, show features consistent with the presence of a highly rotating vortex core emerging from the combustor. The configuration was modelled by a fully compressible reacting CFD analysis, whose domain stretched from the exit of the combustor swirl generator to downstream of the 1 st row nozzle <b>guide</b> <b>vanes.</b> The CFD analysis, when using a Reynolds stress turbulence model, predicted a highly rotating vortex core. The predicted interaction between the core and the nozzle <b>guide</b> <b>vanes</b> were consistent with the temperature indicating paint observations. The interaction is dominated by the vortex core being attracted to the locus of lowest static pressure...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the current research was to analyze the flow through the air intake system of 1. 6 L Proton Waja engine by adding <b>guide</b> <b>vane.</b> The pressure drop across the air intake system {{is known to have}} a significant influence on the indicated power of the SI engine. The pressure drop along the intake system is proportional to the engine speed and cross sectional area. The <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> is placed in the system to reduce the pressure drop across the system. It was found that the <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> help to reduce pressure drop across the air intake system where it increases the capabilities of air induction system to suck more air to the engine. The geometry of air intake system of Proton Waja 1. 6 L engine was used in the modeling approach. The study was focused on different engine speed. This analysis was done in CFD using a model setup with appropriate speed of the Proton Waja 1. 6 L engine from maximum speed to minimum speed. The CFD results of air intake system with the <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> are validated against the CFD result of real air intake system of Proton Waja 1. 6 L which do not have <b>guide</b> <b>vane...</b>|$|R
