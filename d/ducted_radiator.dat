2500|$|Construction on K5054 {{started in}} December 1934, {{although}} several modifications {{were to be}} incorporated into the prototype as construction continued. The most obvious change was to the Merlin engine's cooling system, which was now to use pure ethylene glycol rather than water, and the incorporation of a <b>ducted</b> <b>radiator</b> designed using the results of research conducted by Frederick Meredith of the Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough. At the time of her first flight on 5 March 1936, K5054 was unpainted and the undercarriage had no fairings fitted and was fixed down. The first engine was a prototype Merlin C engine of 990hp (738kW), with six flush-fitting exhaust ports each side, driving an Aero-Products [...] "Watts" [...] two-bladed, wooden fixed-pitch propeller. The carburettor air intake was shorter and flatter than that of the Mk Is, and was recessed into the centre-section.|$|E

To find improved geometries of ducted fans, a design method is developed consisting of a validated singularity method and an optimization code.

50|$|An {{aircraft}} radiator {{contained in}} a duct heats the air passing through, causing the air to expand and gain velocity. This is called the Meredith effect, and high-performance piston aircraft with well-designed low-drag radiators (notably the P-51 Mustang) derive thrust from it. The thrust was significant enough to offset the drag of the <b>duct</b> the <b>radiator</b> was enclosed in and allowed the aircraft to achieve zero cooling drag. At one point, there were even plans to equip the Spitfire with an afterburner, by injecting fuel into the exhaust <b>duct</b> after the <b>radiator</b> and igniting it. Afterburning is achieved by injecting additional fuel into the engine downstream of the main combustion cycle.|$|R

40|$|Electro-magnetic losses {{within a}} hydro-generator are sources of heat which heat the generator, {{and then have}} to be {{conducted}} away. This may, however, cause a temperature rise of the stator bars thus reducing the life-span of the insulation materials. Therefore, any temperature rise of the stator windings is limited.

Temperature measurements performed on a generator showed some deviations from the design temperatures, especially at full-power operation. Thus, an attempt was made to analyse the operation of a cooling-system, and to eventually increase its cooling capacity. It was impossible to perform any complex measurements during the generator’s operation, due to safety reasons. Therefore, our work was limited to 3 D CFD simulations using ANSYS CFX 11 solver.

However this system proved almost impossible to operate properly with the BMW 139; early prototypes of the Fw 190 demonstrated terrible cooling problems.

The intercooler, which was separate from the engine cooling system, with its own supply of glycol and water coolant, was mounted in the induction system, between the outlet of the second-stage supercharger and behind the cylinder blocks. The hot air-fuel mixture from the supercharger was circulated though and around the coolant tubes and was then {{passed on to the}} main induction manifold, through which it was fed into the cylinders. The intercooler also circulated coolant through passages in the supercharger casing and between the impellers.

The Thermal Energy Conversion Branch has most recently concentrated its Brayton studies on electric propulsion for Prometheus. One piece of software used for evaluating such designs over a limited tradeoff space has been the Closed Cycle Engine Program (CCEP). The CCEP originated in the mid- 1980 s from a Fortran aircraft engine code known as the Navy/NASA Engine Program (NNEP). Components such as a solar collector, heat exchangers, <b>ducting,</b> a pumped-loop <b>radiator,</b> a nuclear heat source, and radial turbomachinery were added to NNEP, transforming it into a high-fidelity design and performance tool for closed-Brayton-cycle power conversion and heat rejection.

A test section that has the capability of interfacing with both the wind tunnel in the Thermal Science Lab and a radiator {{will be used to}} facilitate the necessary experiments. The wind tunnel is powered by fan controlled by a variable frequency drive that can induce a range of air flow rates through the <b>duct</b> and <b>radiator.</b> Five tests will be performed, whose goals are as follows: Determine mass flow rate of the cooling water {{as a function of the}} crank shaft rotational speed. Determine heat rejected from the engine to the cooling water as a function of crank shaft rotational speed. Determine the mass flow rate of air through the core as a function of car speed. Determine static pressure drop of the air across the radiator core at varying air mass flow rates. Determine the heat rejection rate associated with a test radiator as a function of both the mass flow rate of air through the core and the mass flow rate of cooling water. These tests will develop relationships that will ultimately allow the formula team to predict the heat rejection necessary at every car speed as well as the ability of a particular radiator to reject heat at those speeds. A guided process will be presented that will aid the team in designing the cooling system to be used on the formula competition car. By performing these tests, the FSAE team can choose an appropriate radiator type and face area for the racecar’s specific cooling needs each year. This process will allow the team to minimize the radiator’s size and optimize cooling to increase performance.

Hamiltons time was well inside the 4 minutes 48 seconds maximum time, however this was the slowest in the GTP class. The organisers for the race, then decided to reduce the field to 55 cars, which meant losing the slowest car in each class, which would have meant RHAM/1 would have been dropped. But one of the other GTP class racers had broken the rules and were cut instead, to the relief of Hamilton who only found out 5 hours before the race.|$|R
5000|$|In 1996, Toyota Motor Sports {{funded the}} {{development}} of an experimental Le Mans Prototype, which was officially known as the TOM'S Toyota LMP. As Toyota were primarily focusing on their Championship Auto Racing Teams (CART) engine, which first ran that year, the LMP project was run on a tight budget of approximately $500,000. Due to this tight budget, the car, christened the [...] "Lumpy", reused Toyota's 3S-GT engine in the 88C Group C specification, which was a 2.1-litre turbocharged straight-four engine, producing this engine was coupled to an Xtrac gearbox from a Peugeot Group C car. The chassis tub was designed to be simple but strong, and the bodywork was also simple; the tight budget meant that the LMP never saw a wind tunnel. The bodywork was designed to minimize lift over the upper body of the car, and had much simpler brake cooling than on most Le Mans Prototypes; the <b>radiator</b> <b>ducts</b> were used, via a scoop, to cool the brakes. After the LMP was completed, Tom Kristensen tested it on at least one occasion, whilst project director Andy Thorby recalled it being tested a total of three times; he stated that the car was very reliable, had lower fuel consumption than the 88C Group C car had (with the same engine), and that it also appeared to be quick. Following the completion of the tests, the car was despatched to Toyota Team Europe's Cologne workshop, stored under a tarpaulin and eventually destroyed. Toyota would return to sportscar racing in 1998, with the André de Cortanze-designed Toyota GT-One.|$|R
2500|$|... 1976 models {{featured}} steel {{floor panels}} shielding the catalytic converter exhaust. These steel floor panels weighed {{less than the}} previous fiberglass floor and reduced interior noise levels. Horsepower rose to [...] for the base L-48 engine; [...] for the optional L-82. To further reduce cabin noise levels, cowl induction was dropped {{in favor of the}} air cleaner <b>ducted</b> over the <b>radiator,</b> picking up outside air {{from the front of the}} car, thus reducing wind turbulence at the base of the windshield. The hood was carried over, with its cowl vent grille and induction system opening becoming non-functional. The optional cast aluminum wheels were finally made available, which reduced the unsprung weight of the car by 32pounds. Nearly 15% of the cars were ordered with the new wheels at a cost of $299. A standard steel rim spare was used. This was the last year for optional white striped tires, as 86% of the cars were being delivered with the optional white lettered tires. A new rear nameplate for the rear bumper cover was introduced, eliminating the individual [...] "Corvette" [...] letters used since 1968. An unwelcome change was the [...] "Vega GT" [...] 4-spoke steering wheel, although its smaller diameter did provide extra room and eased entry/exit. The steering wheel, color-keyed to the interior, continued on 1977 through 1979 models, limited to non-tilt wheel cars only. GM's [...] "Freedom" [...] battery, a new sealed and maintenance-free unit, was now installed in all cars. The rear window defroster option was changed from the forced-air type of previous years to the new [...] "Electro-Clear" [...] defogger, an in-glass heated element type. Even without a convertible model, the Corvette still set new sales records.|$|R
