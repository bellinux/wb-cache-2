5|$|A {{pattern of}} {{irregularities}} {{has been discovered}} concerning the updating of the list when citizens of Croatia turn 18 or die. In 2005, {{it was estimated that}} the register contained a large number of irregularities and erroneous entries. Since then, public attention was directed to the issue by NGOs monitoring elections through roundtables and advertising campaigns; according to GONG—a NGO specializing in election monitoring—although the register was improved, there <b>is</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> further improvement. The 2011 census also indicated a large number of voters in the registry who should not be there, leading to claims that up to a half-million voters in the registry should not be included.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there is}} no clear {{evidence}} that the flower's name derives directly from the Greek myth, this link between the flower and the myth became firmly part of western culture. The narcissus or daffodil is the most loved of all English plants, and appears frequently in English literature. Many English writers have referred to the cultural and symbolic importance of Narcissus). No flower has received more poetic description except the rose and the lily, with poems by authors from John Gower, Shakespeare, Milton (see Roman culture, above), Wordsworth, Shelley and Keats. Frequently the poems deal with self-love derived from Ovid's account. Gower's reference to the yellow flower of the legend has been assumed to be the daffodil or Narcissus, though as with all references in the older literature to the flower that sprang from the youth's death, there <b>is</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> some debate as to the exact species of flower indicated, some preferring Crocus. Spenser announces the coming of the Daffodil in Aprill of his Shepheardes Calender (1579).|$|E
5|$|As a young man, Manuel {{had been}} {{determined}} to restore by force of arms the predominance of the Byzantine Empire in the Mediterranean countries. By the time he died in 1180, 37 {{years had passed since}} that momentous day in 1143 when, amid the wilds of Cilicia, his father had proclaimed him emperor. These years had seen Manuel involved in conflict with his neighbours on all sides. Manuel's father and grandfather before him had worked patiently to undo the damage done by the battle of Manzikert and its aftermath. Thanks to their efforts, the empire Manuel inherited was stronger and better organised than at any time for a century. While it is clear that Manuel used these assets to the full, it is not so clear how much he added to them, and there <b>is</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> doubt as to whether he used them to best effect.|$|E

25|$|The {{separation}} of powers brings its merits in just governance. However, where each branch wields more power than it legitimately should, there <b>is</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> abuse, leaving {{the rest of the}} society open to the potential of being ruled by tyranny of the majority. Hence it is important that a system of checks and balances is in place to ensure that power will not be abused {{to the detriment of the}} people.|$|E
25|$|Boatmen {{reported}} that {{it was easier to}} navigate in the slackwaters than the aqueducts, since there <b>was</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> the water to move around the boat. Places like aqueducts, where there <b>was</b> little <b>room</b> <b>for</b> the water to move, were difficult for the mules to pull the boat through.|$|R

25|$|Thomas Waugh {{argues that}} Natan {{revolutionized}} pornographic film in France. He {{was one of}} the first, and certainly the most prominent, filmmaker to include bisexuality and homosexuality in his films, and introduced masochism to French adult film as well. Joseph Slade, who originally claimed that Natan unquestionably produced {{some of the most important}} hardcore film of the 1920s, now admits there <b>is</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> doubt over whether Natan worked in pornography at any time after 1910.|$|E
25|$|Another {{alternative}} is to read the books in their original order of publication, since reading the Foundation prequels prior to reading the Foundation Trilogy fundamentally alters the original narrative structure of the trilogy by spoiling what were originally presented as plot surprises. In that same Author's Note, Asimov noted that there <b>is</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> a book between Robots and Empire (5) and The Currents of Space (6), {{and that he could}} follow Foundation and Earth (15) with additional volumes.|$|E
25|$|Behavioural change {{theories}} are not universally accepted. Criticisms include the theories' emphases on individual behaviour {{and a general}} disregard for the influence of environmental factors on behaviour. In addition, as some theories were formulated as guides to understanding behaviour while others were designed as frameworks for behavioural interventions, the theories' purposes are not consistent. Such criticism illuminates {{the strengths and weaknesses}} of the theories, showing that there <b>is</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> further research into behavioural change theories.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} build the 225‑m-long, 24‑m-wide train hall and its even more immense piggy-backing ticket hall, it was {{necessary}} to excavate a cavity 40 m wide, 20 m high and 250 m longand this 30 m underneath the busy city centre in unstable waterlogged sedimentary rock. The resulting station is cathedral-like in proportions, with a ticket hall so spacious that there <b>is</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> a mezzanine. The entire construction is waterproofed on both sides by a 7‑m-thick, 10‑m-high abutment of concrete which contains escalators linking the two levels.|$|E
25|$|Other {{advantages}} are {{that because it}} empties near the heart, medications can also be quickly distributed {{to the rest of}} the body. As there <b>is</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> multiple parallel compartments (lumen) within the catheter, so that multiple medications can be delivered at once even if they would not be chemically compatible within a single tube. Caregivers can also measure central venous pressure and other physiological variables through the line. It is commonly believed that fluid can be pushed faster through a central venous catheter but as they are often divided into multiple lumens then the internal diameter is less than that of a large-bore peripheral cannula. They are also longer, which as reflected in Poiseuille's law, requires higher pressure to achieve the same flow, all other variables being equal.|$|E
25|$|PWRs are {{designed}} to be maintained in an undermoderated state, meaning that there <b>is</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> increased water volume or density to further increase moderation, because if moderation were near saturation, then a reduction in density of the moderator/coolant could reduce neutron absorption significantly while reducing moderation only slightly, making the void coefficient positive. Also, light water is actually a somewhat stronger moderator of neutrons than heavy water, though heavy water's neutron absorption is much lower. Because of these two facts, light water reactors have a relatively small moderator volume and therefore have compact cores. One next generation design, the supercritical water reactor, is even less moderated. A less moderated neutron energy spectrum does worsen the capture/fission ratio for 235U and especially 239Pu, meaning that more fissile nuclei fail to fission on neutron absorption and instead capture the neutron to become a heavier nonfissile isotope, wasting one or more neutrons and increasing accumulation of heavy transuranic actinides, some of which have long half-lives.|$|E

500|$|For {{specific}} and more advanced usage scenarios, PHP offers a well defined and documented way for writing custom extensions in C or C++. [...] Besides extending the language itself {{in form of}} additional libraries, extensions are providing a way for improving execution speed where it is critical and there <b>is</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> improvements by using a true compiled language. [...] PHP also offers well defined ways for embedding itself into other software projects. [...] That way PHP can be easily used as an internal scripting language for another project, also providing tight interfacing with the project's specific internal data structures.|$|E
500|$|Biofuel {{development}} and use is a complex issue {{because there are many}} biofuel options which are available. [...] Biofuels, such as ethanol and biodiesel, are currently produced from the products of conventional food crops such as the starch, sugar and oil feedstocks from crops that include wheat, maize, sugar cane, palm oil and oilseed rape. Some researchers fear that a major switch to biofuels from such crops would create a direct competition with their use for food and animal feed, and claim that {{in some parts of the}} world the economic consequences are already visible, other researchers look at the land available and the enormous areas of idle and abandoned land and claim that there <b>is</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> a large proportion of biofuel also from conventional crops.|$|E
500|$|Charles van Commenee's {{appointment}} {{as head coach}} of UK Athletics brought a change of approach towards Chambers as both the new coach and Niels De Vos welcomed him back to compete internationally. The pair judged that he had served his sentence – van Commenee was especially complimentary, stating: [...] "He is a likeable guy and a damned fine athlete". That month Chambers appeared at a [...] "Tackling Doping in Sport" [...] conference and told of the damage drugs had caused to his career, health, and finances. The Olympic ban remained in place, however, and London 2012 chairman Sebastian Coe said: [...] "I am clear cut on the Chambers case – I don't think there <b>is</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> drugs cheats in sport".|$|E

500|$|The {{majority}} {{declined to}} find Rutherford and Cross guilty {{of any wrongdoing}} beyond poor judgment, though its findings were hardly flattering: [...] "As there <b>is</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> doubt that the inference of personal interest is the only reasonable inference {{to be drawn from}} the circumstances related, and in view of the positive denial, it can only be said that, in the opinion of your commissioners, the evidence does not warrant the finding that there was or is any personal interest on the part of Dr. Rutherford or Mr. Cross". [...] Its findings with regards to Cornwall were similar: his receipt of $14,500 and his expectation of $10,500 more constituted [...] "suspicious circumstances", but these [...] "point to no definite conclusion; and he has denied that he received any other benefit, or was interested in any other way in the enterprise, and it must be held that the evidence does not establish the contrary." ...|$|E
500|$|At the 2004 San Diego Comic-Con International, she {{encountered}} now-former Tokyopop editors Mark Paniccia and Lillian M. Diaz-Przybyl, who helped to pitch 12 Days to their publisher. Kim later expressed surprise for her successful pitch of 12 Days, and commented: [...] "It made me believe there <b>is</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> diverse stories." [...] Resuming work on 12 Days in early 2005, Kim felt that her [...] "slow speed, other projects and family matters" [...] delayed [...] its production. Additionally, the South Korean-native Kim, who speaks Korean, English, and Japanese fluently, {{would think of}} ideas in Korean that did not translate well over to English, ultimately leading her to change her method of thinking for the comic. She considered her creation of a global manga [...] "a bit ironic," [...] because she [...] "wanted {{to do something different}} from manhwa or manga," [...] which she had grown up around. Completed in the middle of August 2006, 12 Days was published by Tokyopop in North America in November of the same year. However, in May 2011, Tokyopop shut down its North American branch, with the status of global manga titles left unclear. 12 Days is also published in Germany by Tokyopop Germany.|$|E
