40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{whether the}} disclosure of <b>purchase</b> obligations <b>in</b> the MD&A section of 10 -K filings provides useful information to investors. Firms are predicted to enter into additional purchase obligations when they expect an increase in demand for their products. As such, growth <b>in</b> <b>purchase</b> obligations is predicted {{to be associated with}} higher future sales and earnings. The evidence is consistent with these predictions. This suggests that {{the disclosure of}} purchase obligations is useful for predicting firm performance. Further tests document a positive contemporaneous relation between stock returns and the growth <b>in</b> <b>purchase</b> obligations, consistent with the information <b>in</b> <b>purchase</b> obligations being value-relevant. However, the investor response appears to be incomplete. Results show that the change <b>in</b> <b>purchase</b> obligations is positively associated with future abnormal stock returns. Additional tests provide evidence suggesting that analyst forecasts also do not appear to fully reflect the implications of the change <b>in</b> <b>purchase</b> obligations. *I would like to thank Patricia Dechow, who provided much inspiration and encouragement through this project. I {{would also like to thank}} Richard Sloan for his guidance and insightful comments; Nicole Bastia...|$|R

5|$|When the Super Nintendo Entertainment System was conceived, the Rare {{studio was}} not yet ready for the change. Rare limited their {{releases}} to some Battletoads games and decided to invest their significant NES profit <b>in</b> <b>purchasing</b> expensive Silicon Graphics workstations to make three-dimensional models. This move made Rare the most technologically advanced developer in the UK, and situated them high in the international market. Their priority also changed at that time, as the team decided to focus on quality instead of quantity.|$|E
5|$|After Scott B. Smith had {{published}} {{a short story}} for The New Yorker, the magazine's fiction editor learned of his then-unpublished novel A Simple Plan before reading it and forwarding it to an agent. Shortly thereafter, Smith learned that Mike Nichols was interested <b>in</b> <b>purchasing</b> the film rights to his novel. Nichols spent a weekend reading the book, before contacting Smith's agent, and finalizing a deal the following Monday morning. Nichols purchased the rights for his production company Icarus Productions for $250,000, with an additional $750,000 to come later from a studio interested in pursuing the project. Smith’s manuscript of A Simple Plan was optioned for development at an independent film studio, Savoy Pictures. However, due to scheduling conflicts with a planned film adaptation of All the Pretty Horses, Nichols {{stepped down from the}} project.|$|E

In November 1916, Germany had inquired to find out if Austria-Hungary were interested <b>in</b> <b>purchasing</b> existing German submarines because Germany was having a hard time finding trained submarine crews. After protracted negotiations, which had stalled over the outflow of Austro-Hungarian gold reserves to Germany, an agreement to purchase two submarines—UB-43 and UB-47—was reached in June 1917.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the most}} {{powerful}} individual in the Roman Empire, Augustus wished to embody the spirit of Republican virtue and norms. He also wanted to relate to and connect with {{the concerns of the}} plebs and lay people. He achieved this through various means of generosity and a cutting back of lavish excess. In the year 29BC, Augustus paid 400 sesterces each to 250,000 citizens, 1,000 sesterces each to 120,000 veterans in the colonies, and spent 700 million sesterces <b>in</b> <b>purchasing</b> land for his soldiers to settle upon. He also restored 82 different temples to display his care for the Roman pantheon of deities. In 28BC, he melted down 80 silver statues erected in his likeness and in honor of him, an attempt of his to appear frugal and modest.|$|E
5|$|Armstrong studied whether {{replacing}} the 12-inch guns with seven 15-inch guns would be feasible, but Brazil was probably already attempting {{to sell the}} ship. In the tension building up to the First World War, many countries, including Russia, Italy, Greece, and the Ottoman Empire, were interested <b>in</b> <b>purchasing</b> the ship. While Russia quickly dropped out, Italy and the rival Greeks and Ottomans were all highly interested. The Italians seemed close to purchasing the ship until the French government decided to back the Greeks—rather than allow the Italians, who were the principal naval rivals of the French, to obtain the ship. The Grecian government made an offer for the original purchase price plus an additional £50,000, but as the Greeks worked to obtain an initial installment, the Ottoman government was also making offers.|$|E

Following the USDA announcement to allow choices <b>in</b> <b>purchasing</b> decisions for ground beef, many school districts stated that they would opt out of serving ground beef with LFTB.

By May, Folkestone Town Council had decided not to purchase Lympne and Silver City Airways again expressed an interest <b>in</b> <b>purchasing</b> the airport at a reasonable price. In November, it was announced that Air Kruise had been given permission to operate a scheduled service from Lympne and/or Ramsgate to Birmingham. The service was to be seasonal between April and September, with permission to run the service lasting until 1960. Air Kruise moved its operations to Ramsgate Airport in 1953.|$|E

5|$|To {{develop the}} company, Kosmos and Norsk Air bought the Kirkenes-based airline Norving, that also {{operated}} flights from Skien Airport, Geiteryggen—about one hour's drive from Sandefjord—to Bergen, Trondheim and Stavanger. Norving had seven types of aircraft, but was losing {{large amounts of}} money, although the Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communications covered their losses on some state-subsidized regional routes. The purchase of Norving caused an internal organization conflict between the two organizations. The operations from Skien were merged into Norsk Air, {{while the rest of}} Norving was sold. The latter went bankrupt in 1993. Norsk Air also showed interested <b>in</b> <b>purchasing</b> Widerøe, but none of the large owners were interested in selling.|$|E
