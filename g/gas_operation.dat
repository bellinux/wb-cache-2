25|$|HK has {{a history}} of {{innovation}} in firearms, {{such as the use of}} polymers in weapon designs and the use of an integral rail for flashlights on handguns. HK also developed modern polygonal rifling, noted for its high accuracy, increased muzzle velocity and barrel life. Not all of its technologically ambitious designs have translated into commercially successful products (for instance, the advanced but now abandoned G11 military rifle, which fired caseless high-velocity ammunition). In its extensive product range, HK has used the following operating systems for small arms: blowback operation, short-recoil, roller-delayed blowback, gas-delayed blowback, and <b>gas</b> <b>operation</b> (via Short-stroke piston).|$|E
2500|$|M1917 Lewis. Savage {{produced}} {{a version of}} the Lewis Mk I for US forces, rechambered for the [...]30-06 round and with a modified <b>gas</b> <b>operation</b> due to the greater power of the US ammunition.

2500|$|The {{advantage}} of the <b>gas</b> <b>operation</b> {{is that it allows}} the use of far more powerful cartridges than traditional semi-automatic pistol designs. [...] Thus it allows the Desert Eagle to compete in an area that had previously been dominated by magnum revolvers. Downsides of the gas-operated mechanism are the large size of the Desert Eagle, {{and the fact that it}} discourages the use of unjacketed lead bullets, as lead particles sheared off during firing could clog the gas release tap, preventing proper function.|$|E

2500|$|The major {{difference}} between the two designs was that the BSA weapons were chambered for [...]303 British ammunition, but the Savage guns were chambered for [...]30-06 cartridges, which necessitated some difference in the magazine, feed mechanism, bolt, barrel, extractors, and <b>gas</b> <b>operation</b> system. Savage did make Lewis guns in [...]303 British calibre, though. The Model 1916 and Model 1917 were exported to Canada and the United Kingdom, and a few were supplied to the US military, particularly the Navy. The Savage Model 1917 was generally produced in [...]30-06 caliber. A number of these guns were supplied to the UK under lend-lease during the Second World War.|$|E
2500|$|Suncor Energy, a Canadian {{firm with}} a natural <b>gas</b> <b>operation</b> in Syria worth $1.2 billion as of August 2011, said on 18 August 2011 that it would comply with Canadian and United States {{economic}} sanctions. On 11 December 2011, Suncor CEO Rick George declared force majeure and said the company had suspended Syrian operations. [...] "The current situation in Syria is very concerning", said George, who said Suncor had determined it fell under European Union sanctions because its subsidiaries working in Syria were based in the Netherlands. According to Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister John Baird, the shutdown of Suncor's Elba natural gas plant in Homs was expected to cut off electricity to [...] "hundreds of thousands" [...] of Syrian homes.|$|E
50|$|The {{blowback}} principle may {{be considered}} a simplified form of <b>gas</b> <b>operation,</b> since the cartridge case behaves like a piston driven by the powder gases.

5000|$|Relating {{blowback}} {{to other}} types of automatic firearm operation, George M. Chinn wrote that: [...] "In the larger sense, blowback might well be considered a special form of <b>gas</b> <b>operation.</b> This is reasonable because the cartridge case may be conceived of {{as a sort of}} piston driven by the powder gases. Actually, blowback involves so many special problems that it is best considered to be in a class by itself. The question whether or not it should be included within the more general class of <b>gas</b> <b>operation</b> or recoil operation is purely academic. The important point is that it partakes some of the properties of both classes and, depending on the particular problem at hand, may be considered to be either one." ...|$|E

50|$|Upon closing, {{the bolt}} goes forward into barrel {{extension}} or locking recesses in the receiver, and then rotates; {{at this point}} it is locked in place. The bolt remains locked until the action is cycled, either manually by the operator, or mechanically by delayed blowback, recoil operation or <b>gas</b> <b>operation</b> which then rotates the bolt and unlocks it from the breech {{so that it can be}} withdrawn in order to extract and eject the spent casing, and the next round can be chambered. In <b>gas</b> <b>operation,</b> the gas port, which meters a portion of the combustion gases into the action in order to cycle the weapon, is typically located either midway down the barrel or near the muzzle of the weapon. In this way it functions as a delay, ensuring that the bolt remains locked until chamber pressure has subsided to a safe level.|$|E
