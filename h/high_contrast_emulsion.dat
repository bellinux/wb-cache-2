40|$|A {{study was}} {{undertaken}} to gain {{information concerning the}} mechanism by which a <b>high</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>emulsion</b> is developed to a significantly increased exposure latitude, without loss of toe speed. Developer properties were altered through variations in pH, bromide ion concentration, developing agent concentration, and the Phenidone */hydroquinone ratio. The {{results indicate that the}} bromide ion concentration is the predominant factor reducing both the exposure latitude and the toe speed. The experimental evidence suggests that the bromide reduces the rate of development throughout the exposure range. The other facts investigated produced primarily changes in development rate without affecting the latitude at a given contrast, until the rate and exposure are sufficient so that exhaustion of available silver occurs. The ability to increase the useful exposure scale without loss of toe speed depends upon maintaining a relatively constant rate of development over the desired exposure range, and having no soluble bromide present. *Ilford trademark...|$|E
50|$|Fully {{rigorous}} electromagnetic solutions {{exist for}} gratings, {{which tends to}} involve heavy mathematical formulism. A simple analytical formulism to explain the various properties of <b>high</b> <b>contrast</b> grating has been developed. A computational program based on this analytical solution has also been developed to solve the electromagnetic properties of <b>high</b> <b>contrast</b> grating, named <b>High</b> <b>Contrast</b> Grating Solver. The following provides {{a brief overview of}} the operation principle of <b>high</b> <b>contrast</b> grating.|$|R
5000|$|<b>High</b> <b>contrast</b> {{gratings}} {{have been}} employed in many optoelectronic devices. It has been incorporated as the mirrors for vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers. The light-weight of <b>high</b> <b>contrast</b> grating enables fast microelectromechanical structure actuation for wavelength tuning. The reflection {{phase of the}} <b>high</b> <b>contrast</b> grating is engineered to control the emission wavelength of vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers. By locally changing each grating dimension while keeping its thickness the same, planar, single-layer lenses and focusing reflectors with high focusing power have been obtained. Besides its high reflectivity, the <b>high</b> <b>contrast</b> grating has been designed as a high quality factor resonator. Low-loss hollow-core waveguide are made with <b>high</b> <b>contrast</b> gratings with <b>high</b> reflectivity at oblique incident angle. Applications such as slow light [...] and optical switch [...] can be built on the hollow-core waveguide by using the special phase response and resonance property of <b>high</b> <b>contrast</b> grating. <b>High</b> <b>contrast</b> grating can effectively manipulate the light propagation - directing light from surface-normal to in-plane index-guided waveguide and vice versa.|$|R

40|$|Low {{contrast}} Bailey-Lovie {{visual acuity}} (LCBL) and <b>high</b> <b>contrast</b> Bailey-Lovie visual acuity (HCBL) were measured {{in subjects with}} age-related macular degeneration (ARM) and subjects with normal visual function.

40|$|In this {{research}} we did quantification of contrast level for various general and biomedical images. Here we considered two novel techniques under evaluation {{first one is}} Histogram Flatness Measure (HFM) and second one is Histogram Spread (HS). In case of HFM {{the values of the}} measure are found to be inconsistent in the sense that even for low contrast images also the value of HFM are higher than original images being inconsistent to identify whether it is <b>high</b> <b>contrast</b> or low contrast image with respect to original image. When it comes to HS the values of the measure are coming as for <b>high</b> <b>contrast</b> images <b>high</b> values of HS and low contrast images low values of HS with respected to the value of Original Image. Here we observed the values in terms of taking the images of <b>high</b> <b>contrast</b> at certain level to fully <b>high</b> <b>contrast</b> (histogram equalized images). For all the <b>high</b> <b>contrast</b> images HS found to be high values and low contrast images HS found to be low values and being highly consistent and specifically useful than HFM. The standardization of HS can be useful in database management, visualization, image classification. As par the images we put into application for the evaluation of Novel metric ‘HS’, then we may standardize the notion “High <b>contrast</b> <b>high</b> value and low contrast low value”. Then we did want to analyze the images of <b>high</b> <b>contrast</b> which follow the notion along with images of histogram equalized <b>high</b> <b>contrast</b> images for every image under consideration, in terms of image contrast enhancement Image Quality Assessment (IQA) measures, and we would like to find out the image whether if it is higher level of <b>high</b> <b>contrast</b> or lower level of <b>high</b> <b>contrast</b> with respected to the fully <b>high</b> <b>contrast</b> (histogram equalized) image, so that we can have an idea of the given partially <b>high</b> <b>contrast</b> (towards histogram equalization) image that how much near it is to Fully <b>high</b> <b>contrast</b> image. One advantage of this observation is that, if the image is <b>high</b> <b>contrast</b> and if it is far from fully <b>high</b> <b>contrast</b> image, then we can become cautious especially In the case of Biomedical Images, Cosmological images that the images have to be carefully preserved. Here we have found the Computational time in milliseconds for each IQA measure for all the images so that we can have an idea of which measure we can choose for any hardware design of the performance measure by using tradeoffs basing on the required application of interest of any high speed Digital Image Processor Hardware Implementation for any Real time Medical Device. The image quality measures we considered are Peak Signal–to-Noise-Ratio (PSNR), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Absolute Mean Brightness Error (AMBE), Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR), Contrast to Noise Ratio (CNR), Universal Quality Index (UQI), Noise Quality Measure (NQM), Structural SIMilarity (SSIM), Mean SSIM(MSSIM), Information Fidelity Criterion(IFC), Visual Information Fidelity (VIF), Visual Information Fidelity in Pixel Domain (VIFP), Visual Signal-to-Noise Ratio (VSNR), Wavelets Based SNR (WSNR), Feature similarity Metric (FSIM), Riesz Transform FSIM (RFSIM). One more observation we made is that partially <b>high</b> <b>contrast</b> images are having low computational time of performance metrics when compared to fully <b>high</b> <b>contrast</b> (histogram equalized) images. So in some applications, where no need of fully <b>high</b> <b>contrast</b> images, we can utilize these reasonably <b>high</b> <b>contrast</b> images instead of fully <b>high</b> <b>contrast</b> images for reducing the computational time and also it is highly useful in the case of Digital Image Processing hardware design for saving time and to get a high speed processor, which is highly useful observation.
