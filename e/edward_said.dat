40|$|International audienceIt {{has become}} commonplace to {{consider}} orientalism as a particularly spectacularform of cultural imperialism. <b>Edward</b> <b>Said's</b> work dealt more specifically with theMiddle East (Said, 1978) but his theses were extended to India, especially by RonaldInden (1990). However, as David Ludden remarked, {{we must first}} clarify themeaning and {{the scope of the}} term “orientalism” (LUDDEN, 1994, pg. 252). Thisquestion is particularly important for the period I’m dealing with.

25|$|The term Orientalism {{has come}} to acquire {{negative}} connotations in some quarters and is interpreted {{to refer to the}} study of the East by Westerners shaped by the attitudes of the era of European imperialism in the 18th and 19th centuries. When used in this sense, it often implies prejudiced, outsider-caricatured interpretations of Eastern cultures and peoples. This viewpoint was most famously articulated and propagated by <b>Edward</b> <b>Said</b> in Orientalism (1978), a critical history of this scholarly tradition. In contrast, the term has also been used by some modern scholars to refer to writers of the Imperialist era who had pro-Eastern attitudes, as opposed to those who saw nothing of value in non-Western cultures.|$|E

25|$|According to <b>Edward</b> <b>Said</b> Later, Beidas's novels {{played an}} {{important}} role in the 'construction of a Palestinian national identity, particularly with regard to the influx of Zionist settlers. His first literary venture into this genre was al—Warith (The Inheritor/The heir) in 1920. The book dealt with a subject, the partition of Palestine and the creation of the state of Israel, which appeared only occasionally down to 1948, but whose significance for writers who survived the debacle only emerged after that date, retrospectively. In this work, in which a Jew gets rich via usury and decent people are exploited. It is one of the two Palestinian novels of note written before the nakba of 1948, the other being A Chicken's Memoirs (1943) by Ishaq Musa al-Husaini. He {{played an important}} role also in the 1930s in the development of Palestinian theatre, which thrived down to 1948.|$|E
25|$|Beidas {{was born}} in Nazareth, Palestine in 1874 and studied at the Russian Orthodox al-Muskubīya (presently, {{according}} to <b>Edward</b> <b>Said,</b> a detention and interrogation centre predominantly for Palestinians) and the Russian Teachers' Training Centre in Nazareth (now an Israeli police station), which had been founded in that town in 1886. There were no tuition fees for Palestinian students, and though teaching was in Arabic, high importance was placed on studying Russian. In his recollections, Beidas stated that:'In those days, Russian schools in Palestine were, without doubt, the best.' He graduated in 1892. Beidas' education was on a basis of classical Arab culture, and, though a Christian, Beidas achieved renown as a hafiz. In his early twenties, Beidas was appointed headmaster of Russian missionary schools {{in many parts of}} Syria and Palestine. Later, he became the senior Arabic teacher at Anglican-run St. George's School in Jerusalem.|$|E
25|$|Stone-throwers also employ catapults, slings and slingshots {{armed with}} readily {{available}} materials at hand: stones, bricks, bottles, pebbles or ball bearings, and sometimes rats or cement blocks. Slingshots are often loaded with large ball bearings instead of stones. Since the 1987 uprising, {{the technique is}} favoured as one which, to foreign eyes, will invert the association of modern Israel with David, and her enemies with Goliath, by casting the Palestinians as David to Israel's Goliath, Despite there having been frequent acts of protest all over the Palestinian territories, the number of shooting incidents has been less than 3%. Nonetheless, the international press and media focused on the aspect of Palestinian stone-throwing, which garnered more headline attention than other violent conflicts in the world, so that it became iconic for characterizing the uprising. According to <b>Edward</b> <b>Said,</b> a total cultural and social form of anti-colonial resistance by the Palestinian people is commodified for outside consumption simply as delinquent stone throwing or mindless terroristic bombings.|$|E
