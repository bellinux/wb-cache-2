5|$|The {{game was}} created to not have direct {{connections}} to the first Shin Megami Tensei, to ensure that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>interesting</b> independently; this led character designer Kazuma Kaneko to create {{the concept of a}} story vaguely based on Shin Megami Tensei future. Reviewers enjoyed the gameplay and the lowered difficulty compared to the prior game; some appreciated the plot and themes, but some thought that certain themes, while fresh at the time of release, felt clichéd in retrospect.|$|E

JFK was the first president who really understood television, and similarly, Obama is the first president to fully understand the power of social media. Obama has recognized social media is about creating relationships and connections and therefore used social media {{to the advantage of}} presidential election campaigns, in which Obama has dominated his opponents in terms of social media space.|$|E

The film garnered generally unfavorable critical reviews, but was a box-office success, earning $133million worldwide. Her next role was a supporting role in 2001 film Serendipity as Hally, the fiancée of John Cusack's character.|$|E

I've always wanted to do a Scotland Yard detective who was a woman. I also thought it was an interesting chance to use Amanda Pays and make a villainess of her". Executive producer Robert Goodwin felt that the episode [...] "was a hard one. Any kind of a fire stunt is a major undertaking, because it involves so many overlapping things.

500|$|Matt Richenthal of TV Fanatic complimented the {{performances}} by Betsy Brandt and Aaron Paul, and {{said of the}} latter, [...] "Seriously, does any actor on TV convey more by saying less than Aaron Paul?" [...] He also compared Skyler's increasingly calculated approach to Walter's drug dealing to Gus' personality. New York magazine writer Logan Hill praised Brandt's performance and said <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>interesting</b> to see an episode so focused on Skyler and Marie on a show usually dominated by the male characters. However, he said Skyler's transformation from concerned wife to competent criminal partner felt too sudden. Not all reviews were positive. Slate writers June Thomas and Jessica Grose both enjoyed Marie in [...] "Open House", but both felt the scenes at Jesse's house were too over-the-top and that Skyler's concerns about Walter's safety seemed out of character.|$|E

On June 24, 2013 the band announced that former Sanctity rhythm guitarist and vocalist Jared MacEachern has joined the band as their new bassist. Robb Flynn said of MacEachern: [...] "Monte Conner recommended Jared since he {{was already on the}} tour, and that ended up being a great call. Jared flew out {{a few days before the}} tour and rehearsed with us and did great." [...] Phil Demmel continued: — [...] "There were dozens of amazing players, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>interesting</b> to watch each one take on our tunes.

500|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Power & Control" [...] {{was directed by}} Casper Balslev; it was released on 30 May 2012 as the sixth installment of her eleven-part [...] "The Archetypes" [...] video series. A blue tint is applied throughout the clip; it takes place in an empty mansion, presumably the same location where the music video for [...] "Primadonna" [...] was filmed. A blonde Diamandis is seen engaging {{in a series of}} mind games with her romantic interest. Rich Juzwiak from Gawker appreciated a reference to the music video for [...] "Freedom! '90" [...] by George Michael, which he complimented as [...] "a nice touch". Bradley Stern from MuuMuse stated that the clip was [...] "absolutely gorgeous" [...] despite its simplistic concept; he enjoyed the appearance of a Newton's cradle {{in the beginning of the}} video, and felt that it represented the lyrics [...] "you can't have peace without a war" [...] by exemplifying that the concept that [...] "for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction". Writing for WhatCulture, Josh Webb thought that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>interesting</b> to see an [...] "understated" [...] Diamandis in the clip, and stated that the overall product was an [...] "aesthetically very pleasing" [...] visual. Referencing the emptiness of the mansion, Eliot Glazer from Vulture jokingly offered to [...] "suggest an interior decorator".|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} of Rita {{has been well}} received by critics, who praised Benz’s portrayal. Eric Goldman of IGN has said, “Dexter does a solid job of developing {{the roles of the}} supporting cast, with Rita, Deb, Doakes and LaGuerta all getting a good amount of development”. [...] He added, “There were a couple of forced moments in [...] "Popping Cherry", most notably the drug dealer who came to Rita's house, in broad daylight, demanding money for her ex-husband's debts; it was all a bit over the top and cliché. On the other hand, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>interesting</b> to note Dexter's inaction in that scene, making one wonder if perhaps he fears that any public display of physical defense, even for Rita, might result in him going too far and revealing what he is." [...] Jarett Wieselman of the New York Post has said, [...] "Rita always felt like the light in that dark show", and [...] "In the beginning Rita was the vessel through which the audience could love Dexter." [...] UGO.com placed Rita Bennett 7th on a list of [...] "Top 11 Girlfriends on TV". Zap2it created a poll entitled [...] "Best Mom" [...] as part of their [...] "Greatest TV Characters" [...] series of polls; Rita was voted 12th on a list of 14 characters.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} also subject to less {{favorable}} reviews from critics who were {{disappointed with the}} gaps in Michael and Walt's story. Steve Heisler of Time Out [...] "wasn't all-too-pleased", citing the story's predictability. TMZ's Daniel called [...] "Meet Kevin Johnson" [...] "solid, but not spectacular" [...] {{and gave it a}} grade of a [...] "C+", writing that [...] "this episode fell a little short … I feel like we were kind of robbed of half of the 'What Happened to Michael?' story. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>interesting</b> to see how far into depression he sunk … And they did give him a pretty good reason for working for Ben … But I can't shake the feeling that we missed a good opportunity". He further commented that [...] "Tom would make a great football coach—his motivational speeches are awesome." [...] TV Squad's Erin Martell was unsatisfied with Michael's flashback and the lack of Walt, asking [...] "What was their cover story when they got back to the mainland? … they couldn't do a genuine flashback scene because of … Kelley's growth spurt, but they could have worked around that." [...] Oscar Dahl of BuddyTV ranked it as the second worst episode of the season; his colleague John Kubicek was also critical, and commented that the flashback [...] "essentially tells us things we already know without telling us much more." ...|$|E

In a review for Fuse, Jeff Benjamin described [...] "Say Yes" [...] as a [...] "gospel-island hybrid". He felt that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>interesting</b> to hear Williams {{as the lead}} vocalist instead of Beyoncé, who had previously served as the lead vocalist of Destiny's Child. Benhamin finished his review, concluding, [...] "It all sort of makes us want to twerk and throw our hands to heavens at the same time." [...] Brownie Marie of Christian Today praised Williams' vocal performance during the song's hook, along with the [...] "well-controlled riffs". She also wrote that Beyoncé is [...] "vocally subdued on the track, and truly lets Williams' voice receive the attention". Hayen Manders from Refinery29 felt that the song was Williams' [...] "turn to shine". In a more mixed review, Vulture columnist Lindsey Weber wrote that the song is not [...] "a total mess" [...] and that listeners might sing the praises in the song along with it. At the 2014 Soul Train Music Awards, [...] "Say Yes" [...] is currently nominated in the category for Best Gospel/Inspirational Song.|$|E
500|$|Mike is {{hurt when}} new love {{interest}} Bronwyn Davies (Rachel Friend) {{chose to be}} with Henry Ramsay (Craig McLachlan). He incorrectly believes he and Jane {{have a chance of}} reconciling because when Jane and Des share a meal to discuss Mike, but Jane believed Des had invited her with romantic intentions in mind. Des does feel drawn to Jane and Jones told Darren Devlyn from the magazine that her character is [...] "really upset" [...] when Des wants to discuss Mike. Jane is nearly hit by a car and this makes Des realise that he is in love with Jane and asks her to marry him. Mike is left feeling worse that both women in his life have chosen other men. Jones told Devlyn that Des' friends still believe he is attached to the memory of his late wife Daphne Clarke (Elaine Smith). She explained that because of Daphne [...] "it's natural that the proposal comes as a big shock." [...] Both characters had been left emotionally damaged from previous relationships but Jones believed the duo had no hesitations once they made the commitment. The actress added [...] "it's great that Des is finally over his mourning." [...] She was also looking forward to her character taking the role of step-mother to Jamie. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>interesting</b> for her to see how Jane copes with the responsibility of looking after a child. Keane was happy with the storyline because he believed it was time for Des to move on. He was also excited to work more closely alongside Jones on the storyline.|$|E

[...] George went on to describe the album as [...] "intimate", which according to her gives [...] "the magic of Beyoncé — even when she's speaking to the masses, she's really speaking to you, and you alone." [...] She finished her review saying that the album gives a personal evening with Beyoncé along with [...] "absolute grace and ultimate humility." [...] Sian-Pierre Regis of MTV described the album as a [...] "glitzy doc-style flick" [...] and noted that Beyoncé shows her [...] "softer" [...] side while also calling her a [...] "gift that keeps on giving." [...] Entertainment Weeklys Melissa Maerz wrote that [...] "According to... DVD Live at Roseland: Elements of 4... finds Beyoncé telling her life story through her songs... has done a whole lot of amazing things in her life." [...] Gordon Smart of The Sun praised the romance between Beyoncé and Jay-Z during the DVD, noting that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>interesting</b> to see Beyoncé talking about her love life because she has always kept her private life in secret. J. J. Anisiobi and Donna Mcconnell of Daily Mail praised the fact that the DVD shows Beyoncé [...] "from eager five-year-old music fan to a consummate entertainer".|$|E
500|$|In the {{conclusion}} of the segment Bender stated, [...] "The big climactic cave sequence was hugely complex, and although it's very scary that this really terrifying thing is happening to our characters, {{at the end of the}} day I think the emotion from what we are experiencing is hopefully going to be the shock that people will stay with," [...] referring to Hodor's implied death. In an interview with Kristian Nairn (Hodor), he described filming the scene, [...] "It was a really heavy day — you’ve got these 100-mile-per-hour winds being blown into your face with false snow. I was really holding the door — there were like eight people pushing from the other side and I was really holding them back. It’s definitely Method acting. It was a very intense day but one of the nice things was they let Isaac wrap me. He got to come over and say [...] "Mr. Nairn, that’s a wrap." [...] It was very emotional. It’s always been a little group of us together and it felt like our little group was breaking up." [...] Ellie Kendrick (Meera Reed) spoke about the filming of her part of the sequence, saying [...] "A lot of what's happening in that scene, in Meera's head, comes down to adrenaline. There's just no way she can stop and consider logically what's happening. If you have an army of the undead chasing after you, you're only going to be thinking one thing: [...] "Run!" [...] <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>interesting,</b> having the challenge of creating that adrenaline and fear and sadness of Hodor, but not being able to process it at all. Having to recreate that feeling of immediacy, in a stuffy studio at 4 p.m. on a Thursday when you've been filming the same scene for a couple of days, it was difficult. But it was an exciting challenge, to constantly inject the energy those characters must be feeling in that moment." ...|$|E
500|$|Left Behind {{was written}} {{to focus on}} the {{relationship}} between Ellie and Riley, and to recount the events that defined their later personalities. Riley was chronologically introduced to Ellie in , a comic book written by creative director Neil Druckmann and artist Faith Erin Hicks. The team used the comic as a reference point when developing the relationship between Ellie and Riley, becoming particularly interested in having the chance to see more of their relationship; Druckmann felt that they would not have developed Left Behind if American Dreams hadn't been written. Druckmann felt that the story of Joel and Ellie's relationship in The Last of Us dealt with survival, loyalty and love, and that Ellie and Riley's relationship in Left Behind deals with similar themes. Straley felt that the themes involve love, loss and devotion, pondering the extent that one goes to protect those one cares about. Ashley Johnson portrayed Ellie in Left Behind, reprising her role from The Last of Us. To portray Riley, the team cast Yaani King; Johnson has noted that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>interesting</b> to act against someone different, and that King fit the role immediately. King felt intimidated to become part of a large project, and was worried about [...] "fit in". The team found it interesting {{to tell the story of}} Riley, as players of The Last of Us were already aware of the effect that she had on Ellie; Left Behind sees Riley's behavior change Ellie, resulting in the latter's focus to fight in order to save those close to her. The team were also interested in Ellie's behavior around Riley; she is perceived as being more playful. In Left Behind, Ellie and Riley share a kiss; the team explored omitting the kiss from the game, but felt that it was imperative to the story, and that it strengthened the relationship. Though initially he only felt that Ellie viewed Riley as an influence, Druckmann later considered her romantic appeal, and decided to explore the concept.|$|E
