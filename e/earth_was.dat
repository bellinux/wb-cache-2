5|$|Irving's {{writings}} on Columbus are {{a mixture of}} history and fiction, a genre now called romantic history. Irving based them on extensive research in the Spanish archives, but also added imaginative elements aimed at sharpening the story. The first of these works {{is the source of}} the durable myth that medieval Europeans believed the <b>Earth</b> <b>was</b> flat. (See Myth of the flat earth.) According to the popular book, Columbus proved the <b>Earth</b> <b>was</b> round.|$|E
5|$|Another early {{application}} of the Reuleaux triangle, by Leonardo da Vinci circa 1514 (or possibly {{by one of his}} followers at his direction), was a world map in which the spherical surface of the <b>earth</b> <b>was</b> divided into eight octants, each flattened into the shape of a Reuleaux triangle.|$|E

5|$|Another pet project Johnson {{supported}} {{was prompted}} by his friendship with John Cleves Symmes, Jr., who proposed that the <b>Earth</b> <b>was</b> hollow.

5|$|Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the <b>Earth</b> <b>was</b> {{released}} on October 24, 2005 for the Xbox, and on March 27, 2006 for the PC. The game contains {{a number of}} software bugs, which have never been officially patched; these bugs are generally intermittent, and restoring from an earlier saved game can be enough to get past them. There is also an unofficial patch available that fixes some glitches and lowers the game's overall difficulty level. The Xbox version is officially compatible with the Xbox 360 in certain regions.|$|E
5|$|For natural uranium, about 49% of its {{alpha rays}} are emitted {{by each of}} 238U atom, and also 49% by 234U (since the latter is formed from the former) and about 2.0% of them by the 235U. When the <b>Earth</b> <b>was</b> young, {{probably}} about one-fifth of its uranium was uranium-235, but the percentage of 234U was probably much lower than this.|$|E
5|$|In September 2013 an {{unreleased}} Dreamcast {{version of}} ToeJam & Earl III: Mission to <b>Earth</b> <b>was</b> {{found on a}} Katana Development Kit.

50|$|Likewise, {{believing that}} the <b>Earth</b> <b>is</b> a sphere is less wrong than {{believing that the}} <b>Earth</b> <b>is</b> flat, but wrong nonetheless, since it is really an oblate {{spheroid}} or a reasonable approximation thereof. As the state of knowledge advanced, the statement of the Earth's shape became more refined, and each successive advance required a more careful and subtle investigation. Equating the wrongness of {{the theory that the}} <b>Earth</b> <b>is</b> flat with the wrongness of the theory that the <b>Earth</b> <b>is</b> a perfect sphere is wronger than wrong.|$|R

5|$|In {{development}} since 1999, {{the project}} was repeatedly delayed, going through several revisions and having {{some of its most}} ambitious and immersive features abandoned and the initially planned PlayStation 2 version cancelled. Although well received by most critics and regarded by some {{as one of the best}} horror video games of all time, Dark Corners of the <b>Earth</b> <b>was</b> a commercial failure. At least two additional Cthulhu Mythos games were planned by Headfirst Productions, including a direct sequel titled Call of Cthulhu: Destiny's End, but both were never completed due to Headfirst's bankruptcy.|$|E
5|$|In the Christian world {{prior to}} Galileo's {{conflict}} with the Church, the majority of educated people subscribed either to the Aristotelian geocentric view that the <b>earth</b> <b>was</b> {{the center of the}} universe and that all heavenly bodies revolved around the Earth, or the Tychonic system that blended geocentrism with heliocentrism. Nevertheless, following the death of Copernicus and before Galileo, heliocentrism was relatively uncontroversial; Copernicus's work was used by Pope Gregory XIII to reform the calendar in 1582.|$|E
5|$|On 11 July 2011, Neptune {{completed}} its first full barycentric orbit since its discovery in 1846, {{although it did}} not appear at its exact discovery position in the sky, because <b>Earth</b> <b>was</b> in a different location in its 365.26-day orbit. Because of {{the motion of the}} Sun in relation to the barycentre of the Solar System, on 11 July Neptune was also not at its exact discovery position in relation to the Sun; if the more common heliocentric coordinate system is used, the discovery longitude was reached on 12 July 2011.|$|E

5|$|Scientific {{investigation}} {{has resulted in}} several culturally transformative shifts in people's view of the planet. In the West, belief in a flat <b>Earth</b> <b>was</b> displaced {{by the idea of}} spherical Earth, credited to Pythagoras in the 6th century BC. <b>Earth</b> <b>was</b> further believed {{to be the center of}} the universe until the 16th century when scientists first theorized that it was a moving object, comparable to the other planets in the Solar System. Due to the efforts of influential Christian scholars and clerics such as James Ussher, who sought to determine the age of Earth through analysis of genealogies in Scripture, Westerners before the 19th century generally believed Earth to be a few thousand years old at most. It was only during the 19th century that geologists realized Earth's age was at least many millions of years.|$|E
5|$|The Cassini–Huygens {{mission was}} not {{equipped}} to provide evidence for biosignatures or complex organic compounds; it showed an environment on Titan that is similar, in some ways, to ones theorized for the primordial Earth.

5|$|The castle {{earthworks}} {{were built}} up from local chalk; the ditches dug around the fortification {{would not have}} provided enough for the mound itself, and local tradition suggests {{that much of the}} <b>earth</b> <b>was</b> quarried instead from the nearby Gallows Pits in the town. The castle was constructed by hand, using workers digging with wooden shovels, and probably without pickaxes.
