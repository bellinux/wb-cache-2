25|$|During the Second World War the {{air raid}} warning {{organisation}} No 32 Group Carlisle Royal Observer Corps operated {{in the city}} centre controlled from RAF Kingstown. The association with Kingstown developed further in 1962 when the ROC ceased its aircraft spotting role for the RAF and took on a new role plotting nuclear explosions and warning the public of radioactive fallout for the United Kingdom Warning and Monitoring Organisation (UKWMO). A new administration building and a protected, hardened Nuclear Reporting bunker was built at RAF Carlisle. The nuclear bunker was a standard above-ground structure and both the bunker and headquarters <b>hutting</b> were on a separate site at Crindledyke outside the main gates of RAF Carlisle. The Carlisle group was redesignated no 22 Group ROC.|$|E

6000|$|I may {{remark that}} {{soldiers}} might {{be trained to}} {{a great deal of}} <b>hutting</b> practice in a very inexpensive way, if they were drilled at putting together huts, whose roofs and walls were made of planks lashed together by this simple hitch, and whose supports were short scaffolding poles planted in deep holes, dug, as explained in the chapter on [...] "Wells," [...] with the hand and a small stick. The poles, planks, and cords might be used over and over again for an indefinite time. Further, bedsteads could be made in a similar way, by short cross-planks lashed together, and resting on a framework of horizontal poles, lashed to uprights planted in the ground. The soldier's bedding would not be injured by being used on these bedsteads, as much as if it were laid on the bare ground. Kinds of designs and experiments in <b>hutting</b> could be practised without expense in this simple way.|$|E

They marched without tents, however, it being well understood that they were going into a region where the axe could at any time cover thousands of men, in about the time that a camp could be laid out, and the canvass spread. <b>Hutting</b> was the usual mode of placing an army under cover in the forest; and a dozen marches would take the battalion {{to the point where it}} was intended it should remain, as a support to two or three other corps still further in advance, and to keep open the communications.|$|E
6000|$|We halted {{a day at}} Gudingaras, {{wishing to}} see the {{migration}} of a tribe. Before dawn, on the 30th November, the Somali Stentor proclaimed from the ridge-top, [...] "Fetch your camels!--Load your goods!--We march!" [...] About 8 A.M. we started in the rear. The spectacle was novel to me. Some 150 spearmen, assisted by their families, were driving before them divisions which, in total, might amount to 200 cows, 7000 camels, and 11,000 or 12,000 sheep and goats. Only three wore the Bal or feather, which denotes the brave; several, however, had the other decoration--an ivory armlet. [24] Assisted by the boys, whose heads were shaved in a cristated fashion truly ridiculous, and large pariah dogs with bushy tails, they drove the beasts and carried the colts, belaboured runaway calves, and held up the hind legs of struggling sheep. The sick, of whom there were many,--dysentery being at the time prevalent,--were carried upon camels with their legs protruding in front from under the hide-cover. Many of the dromedaries showed the Habr Awal brand [25]: laden with <b>hutting</b> materials and domestic furniture, they were led by the maidens: the matrons, followed, bearing their progeny upon their backs, bundled in the shoulder-lappets of cloth or hide. The smaller girls, who, {{in addition to the}} boys' crest, wore a circlet of curly hair round the head, carried the weakling lambs and kids, or aided their mammas in transporting the baby. Apparently in great fear of the [...] "All" [...] or Commando, the Bedouins anxiously inquired if I had my [...] "fire" [...] with me [26], and begged us to take the post of honour--the van. As our little party pricked forward, the camels started in alarm, and we were surprised to find that this tribe did not know the difference between horses and mules. Whenever the boys lost time in sport or quarrel, they were threatened by their fathers with the jaws of that ogre, the white stranger; and the women exclaimed, as they saw us approach, [...] "Here comes the old man who knows knowledge!"

40|$|Background: Head-up tilt (<b>HUT)</b> {{testing is}} used to {{establish}} the diagnosis of neurally mediated syncope (NMS). Adenosine administration during <b>HUT</b> testing is useful for inducing NMS. However, no comparison between adenosine <b>HUT</b> testing and <b>HUT</b> testing using other drugs has been reported. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the clinical usefulness of adenosine compared with isoproterenol (ISP) and isosorbide (ISDN) during <b>HUT</b> testing. Methods: The subjects comprised 103 consecutive patients with unexplained syncope who underwent adenosine and isoproterenol (ISP) <b>HUT</b> tests following a negative response in a drug-free <b>HUT</b> test. Subjects were first tilted upright at an 80 ° angle for 30  min and shown to have a negative response in drug-free <b>HUT</b> test. Subsequently, a continuous bolus of 0. 1 - or 0. 2 -mg/kg adenosine was administered while the subjects remained upright and were observed for 5  min (adenosine <b>HUT</b> test). Next, they were tilted upright for 15  min during a continuous infusion of 0. 01 – 0. 02  mg/kg min ISP (ISP <b>HUT</b> test). Lastly, they were tilted upright for 15  min after 1. 25 -mg ISDN infusion (ISDN <b>HUT</b> test). Results: The diagnostic yield of the adenosine <b>HUT</b> test was 18. 1 % (18 / 99) and that of the ISP <b>HUT</b> test was 6. 0 % (6 / 99; p=N. S.). Sixty-one of 99 patients underwent ISDN <b>HUT</b> testing, and 17 patients had a positive response. The diagnostic yield of the adenosine <b>HUT</b> test was 14. 7 % (9 / 61) and that of ISDN <b>HUT</b> test was 27. 8 % (p< 0. 05). Five patients had positive responses in both adenosine and ISDN <b>HUT</b> tests. Conversely, 4 patients had a positive response in the adenosine <b>HUT</b> test and a negative response in the ISDN <b>HUT</b> test. Conclusion: The adenosine <b>HUT</b> test was effective in the diagnosis of NMS and is useful as the ISP <b>HUT</b> test for inducing NMS. The diagnostic yield of the adenosine <b>HUT</b> test was not higher than that of the ISDN <b>HUT</b> test. However, the adenosine <b>HUT</b> test took only a few minutes and induced NMS in some of the patients in whom NMS was not induced by the ISDN <b>HUT</b> test. Therefore, performing adenosine <b>HUT</b> testing is worthwhile...|$|R

40|$|Experimental <b>huts</b> are simplified, {{standardized}} {{representations of}} human habitations that provide model systems to evaluate insecticides used in indoor residual spray (IRS) and long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) to kill disease vectors. <b>Hut</b> volume, construction materials {{and size of}} entry points impact mosquito entry and exposure to insecticides. The performance of three standard experimental <b>hut</b> designs was compared to evaluate insecticide used in LLINs. Field studies were conducted at the World Health Organization Pesticide Evaluation Scheme (WHOPES) testing site in Muheza, Tanzania. Three East African <b>huts,</b> three West African <b>huts,</b> and three Ifakara <b>huts</b> were compared using Olyset(®) and Permanet 2. 0 (®) versus untreated nets as a control. Outcomes measured were mortality, induced exophily (exit rate), blood feeding inhibition and deterrence (entry rate). Data were analysed using linear mixed effect regression and Bland-Altman comparison of paired differences. A total of 613 mosquitoes were collected in 36 nights, of which 13. 5  % were Anopheles gambiae sensu lato, 21  % Anopheles funestus sensu stricto, 38  % Mansonia species and 28  % Culex species. Ifakara <b>huts</b> caught three times more mosquitoes than the East African and West African <b>huts,</b> while the West African <b>huts</b> caught significantly fewer mosquitoes than the other <b>hut</b> types. Mosquito densities were low, very little mosquito exit was measured {{in any of the}} <b>huts</b> with no measurable exophily caused by the use of either Olyset or Permanet. When the <b>huts</b> were directly compared, the West African <b>huts</b> measured greater exophily than other <b>huts.</b> As unholed nets were used in the experiments and few mosquitoes were captured, {{it was not possible to}} measure difference in feeding success either between treatments or <b>hut</b> types. In each of the <b>hut</b> types there was increased mortality when Permanet or Olyset were present inside the <b>huts</b> compared to the control, however this did not vary between the <b>hut</b> types. Both East African and Ifakara <b>huts</b> performed in a similar way although Ifakara <b>huts</b> allowed more mosquitoes to enter, increasing data power.
