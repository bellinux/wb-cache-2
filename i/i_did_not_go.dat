5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>go</b> {{to church}} anymore... I guess {{you might say}} I've come around to secular humanism, an {{obligation}} I believe all humans have to others and {{the world we live}} in.|$|R

5000|$|This is sphere, {{every point}} {{of which is}} its center, where <b>I</b> would <b>not</b> <b>go,</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>go</b> beyond its {{geometric}} size. I always stay in place, in the center. But I'm getting old. Why? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of that I {{am quite}} aware--you have said so several times. I have passed my words, and <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>go</b> back upon my bargains. The stars are with you, and, come what may, I obey them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'If I {{might only}} have stayed at home--even if <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>go</b> to the wedding,' sighed Nuttie, {{who had only}} half listened to the Canoness's wisdom.|$|E

6000|$|... "No," [...] replied Francois, [...] "I saw no geese; but <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>go</b> {{out of my}} way to {{look for}} them. I was more taken up with the timber than {{replenishing}} the kettle." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{it is as}} far as I can go myself, and be {{fair and}} conscientious. I have always {{regarded}} him as a doubtful dog, and so has Potter. Potter is the great Dane.
