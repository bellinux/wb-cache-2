Included are an analysis of the Christian church and of his ancestral home, as well as a text about ornamentation and comments on the design of a desk.|$|E

5|$|Raoul Wallenberg's half-brother, Guy von Dardel, a {{well-known}} physicist, retired from CERN, {{was dedicated to}} finding out his half-brother's fate. He traveled to the Soviet Union about fifty times for discussions and research, including {{an examination of the}} Vladimir prison records. Over the years, Professor von Dardel compiled a 50,000-page archive of interviews, <b>journal</b> <b>articles,</b> letters, and other documents related to his quest. In 1991, Dardel initiated a Swedish-Russian working group to search eleven separate military and government archives from the former Soviet Union for information about Wallenberg's fate, but the group was not able to find conclusive information. Many, including Professor von Dardel and his daughters Louise and Marie, do not accept the various versions of Wallenberg's death. They continue to request that the archives in Russia, Sweden, and Hungary be opened to impartial researchers.|$|E
5|$|Scholars have {{discussed}} Not in Front of the Children in academic <b>journal</b> <b>articles,</b> and characterized it {{as a work}} which balances education policy against {{the negative consequences of}} censorship. In an article for Journal of Sex & Marital Therapy, Middlebury College women's studies professor Deborah Grant compared the book to Harmful to Minors by Judith Levine. Grant characterized both books as significant works emphasizing the importance of allowing youths access to informative educational resources. She classed Heins' monograph as a thorough and important survey of the chronology of censorship. Perry L. Glanzer wrote in English Journal that Heins had a valid viewpoint to engage students on controversial topics in literature classes, and he added it was necessary to teach them all perspectives of a debate. Ellen P. Goodman wrote for Berkeley Technology Law Journal that Heins was critical of prior articles which attempted to show negative impact from violence as portrayed on television programs.|$|E
5|$|From 1927 {{through to}} 1946 {{he worked as}} the Abercromby Professor of Archaeology at the University of Edinburgh, and then from 1947 to 1957 as {{director}} of the Institute of Archaeology, London. During this period he oversaw excavation of a number of archaeological sites in Scotland and Northern Ireland, focusing in particular on the society of Neolithic Orkney by excavating the settlement of Skara Brae and the chambered tombs of Maeshowe and Quoyness. Throughout, he continued to publish prolifically, producing excavation reports, <b>journal</b> <b>articles,</b> and books. With Stuart Piggott and Grahame Clark he co-founded The Prehistoric Society in 1934, becoming its first president. Remaining committed to his socialist ideals, he embraced Marxism, and used Marxist ideas as an interpretative framework for archaeological data. He also became a noted sympathiser with the Soviet Union and visited the country on a number of occasions, although grew sceptical of Soviet foreign policy following the Hungarian Revolution of 1956. His beliefs resulted in him being legally barred from entering the United States, despite being repeatedly invited to lecture there. Upon retirement, he returned to Australia's Blue Mountains, there committing suicide.|$|E
