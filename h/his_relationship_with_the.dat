5|$|After {{attending}} the Far Eastern People's Conference in the Soviet Union, Nosaka returned to Japan in 1922, and {{helped found the}} Japanese Communist Party (JCP) that same year. Nosaka was more secretive about <b>his</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Communist Party {{than he had been}} in Britain, and kept his membership a secret from Bunji Suzuki and other moderate labour leaders. After his return, Nosaka worked as a trade unionist and editor of the JCP's official newspaper, Musansha Shimbun.|$|E
5|$|Basiliscus was {{the brother}} of Empress Aelia Verina, who was the wife of Emperor Leo I (457–474). <b>His</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Emperor allowed him to pursue a {{military}} career that, after minor initial successes, ended in 468, when he led the disastrous Roman invasion of Vandal Africa, {{in one of the}} largest military operations of Late Antiquity.|$|E

5|$|After {{a series}} of civil wars, Ladislaus's main focus was the {{restoration}} of public safety. He introduced severe legislation, punishing those who violated property rights with death or mutilation. He occupied almost all Croatia in 1091, which {{marked the beginning of}} an expansion period for the medieval Kingdom of Hungary. Ladislaus's victories over the Pechenegs and Cumans ensured the security of his kingdom's eastern borders for about 150 years. <b>His</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Holy See deteriorated during the last years of his reign, as the popes claimed that Croatia was their fief, but Ladislaus denied their claims.|$|E
5|$|Chronicles {{edited by}} Kogălniceanu and Costache Negruzzi were {{the source of}} {{inspiration}} for several historical novelists, beginning with Alexandru Odobescu. <b>His</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> peasant representative to the ad hoc Divan, Ion Roată, is briefly mentioned in an anecdote authored by Ion Creangă (Moș Ion Roată). He is also {{the subject of a}} short writing by Ion Luca Caragiale (first published by Vatra in 1894). Symbolist poet Dimitrie Anghel, whose father, the National Liberal parliamentarian Dimitrie A.

The book is known for revealing many secrets about his father's private life, including <b>his</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> actress Gyda Christensen. Like his father, Hambro translated many books from English to Norwegian, among them The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand in 1949, First Among Equals by Jeffrey Archer in 1985, and A Sport of Nature by Nadine Gordimer in 1988.|$|E
5|$|He is {{predominantly}} a left footed player. During a match he will often drift {{to the left}} wing, with his teammate, {{in the case of}} Bayern Munich, Franck Ribéry, switching over to the right. Another factor in his playing style is <b>his</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> right-fullback. At Bayern, this partnership with Philipp Lahm has had benefits for the team's efficiency and chemistry. Robben's defensive work improved when he went to Bayern where he often tracks back and covers for his partner when he pushes forward and becomes a temporary right back.|$|E

50|$|The suicide {{scene is}} a {{depiction}} of extreme masochism, {{but it also}} concludes {{the story of the}} character's sexual dysfunction, existential crisis, and social isolation.

5|$|In Aqil's absence, a {{garrison}} of Kurdish irregulars {{based in}} Damascus {{had been left}} in charge of security in the Galilee. They were commanded by Shamdin Agha, but their employment was terminated by Aqil in 1855. Meanwhile, scores of Bedouin tribesmen from Faiyum with kinship ties to Aqil's tribal irregulars had migrated to the Levant {{as a result of}} their suppression by Sa'id Pasha of Egypt. Aqil welcomed their membership into his tribal band and their numbers subsequently swelled. He consecrated <b>his</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> new arrivals by marrying a daughter of one of their sheikhs. In May 1856, he defeated the Abd al-Hadi clan of Arraba in a major clash that ended encroachments by the Abd al-Hadis on Aqil's territory.|$|E
5|$|Mugabe {{focused on}} the {{propaganda}} war, making regular speeches and radio broadcasts. In these, he presented himself as a Marxist-Leninist, speaking warmly of Marxist-Leninist revolutionaries like Vladimir Lenin, Joseph Stalin, and Fidel Castro. Despite his Marxist views, Mugabe's meetings with Soviet representatives were unproductive, for they insisted on Nkomo's leadership of the revolutionary struggle. <b>His</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> People's Republic of China was far warmer, as the Chinese Marxist government supplied ZANLA with armaments without any conditions. He also sought support from Western nations, visiting Western embassies in Mozambique, and travelled to both Western states like Italy and Switzerland and Marxist-governed states like the Soviet Union, China, North Korea, Vietnam, and Cuba.|$|E
5|$|Not {{content with}} his part, Despenser used <b>his</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> king to impinge on {{the lands of}} other Marcher lords. This caused resentment among such men as Hereford and Roger Mortimer, who rose up in {{rebellion}} in 1321. The rebellion was crushed, but resistance continued under the Marcher lords' ally Thomas of Lancaster, who was defeated at the Battle of Boroughbridge in 1322, and executed. Although this victory temporarily secured Edward's position on the throne, he was eventually deposed in 1326 by Roger Mortimer, {{with the help of}} the king's wife, Isabella of France. The title of Earl of Gloucester was recreated by EdwardII's son EdwardIII in 1337, for Hugh de Audley.|$|E

5|$|On 17 January 1968, the Khmer Rouge {{launched}} their first offensive. It was aimed more at gathering weapons and spreading propaganda than in seizing territory since, at that time, the adherents {{of the insurgency}} numbered no more than 4–5,000. During the same month, the communists established the Revolutionary Army of Kampuchea as the military wing of the party. As early {{as the end of}} the Battambang revolt, Sihanouk had begun to reevaluate <b>his</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> communists. His earlier agreement with the Chinese had availed him nothing. They had not only failed to restrain the North Vietnamese, but they had actually involved themselves (through the Khmer Rouge) in active subversion within his country.|$|E
5|$|Prokofiev {{had been}} {{considering}} making an opera out of Leo Tolstoy's epic novel War and Peace, when {{news of the}} German invasion of Russia on 22June 1941 made the subject seem all the more timely. Prokofiev took two years to compose his original version of War and Peace. Because of the war he was evacuated together {{with a large number}} of other artists, initially to the Caucasus where he composed his Second String Quartet. By now, <b>his</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> 25-year-old writer and librettist Mira Mendelson (1915–1968) had finally led to his separation from his wife Lina, although they never divorced: indeed Prokofiev had tried to persuade Lina and their sons to accompany him as evacuees out of Moscow, but Lina opted to stay.|$|E
5|$|The car was {{initially}} designed in 1979 as a short notice {{replacement for the}} team's Alfa Romeo-engined BT48, after Brabham team owner Bernie Ecclestone decided to end <b>his</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Italian engine manufacturer. The BT49 was created in only six weeks using elements of the BT48 chassis together with the widely used Cosworth DFV engine. It is a single seater with an open cockpit and exposed wheels. The monocoque chassis is made from aluminium alloy and carbon fibre composites. The car was fitted with controversial hydropneumatic suspension and water-cooled brakes {{at different points in}} its life.|$|E
50|$|Napoleon and Love was a 1974 British {{television}} series originally aired on ITV and lasting for 9 episodes from 5 March to 30 April 1974.

50|$|Theodore Fielding is an {{enthusiastic}} opportunist, whose pretensions tend to cause conflict in <b>his</b> <b>relationships</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> others, despite <b>his</b> good intentions.

5|$|To {{instruct}} new Pakistani {{students in}} the methods of archaeology, in early 1950 Wheeler ran a training excavation at Mohenjo-daro; there, he was joined by the British student Leslie Alcock, who spoke both Punjabi and Urdu and who was appointed a site supervisor by Wheeler. This excavation {{proved to be the}} only one for which Wheeler would not write and publish a full excavation report. Instead, he made reference to its findings in his book The Indus Civilization, published as part of the series The Cambridge History of India. <b>His</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Pakistani government had become strained, and so he declined to return to work for them for a third year.|$|E
5|$|Władysław IV owed nominal {{allegiance}} to the Imperial Habsburgs {{as a member of}} the Order of the Golden Fleece. <b>His</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Habsburgs was relatively strong; although he was not above carrying some negotiations with their enemies, like France, he refused Cardinal Richelieu's 1635 proposal of an alliance and a full-out war against them, despite potential lure of territorial gains in Silesia. He realized that such a move would cause much unrest in a heavily Catholic Commonwealth, that he likely lacked the authority and power to push such a change of policy through the Sejm, and that the resulting conflict would be very difficult. From 1636 onward, for the next few years, Władysław strengthened his ties with the Habsburgs.|$|E
5|$|Blaine’s {{earliest}} expressions in {{the foreign}} policy sphere were those of a reactionary Anglophobe, {{but by the end}} of his career <b>his</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> United Kingdom had become more moderate and nuanced. A dispute over seal hunting in the waters off Alaska was the cause of Blaine’s first interaction with Britain as Harrison’s Secretary of State. A law passed in 1889 required Harrison to ban seal hunting in Alaskan waters, but Canadian fishermen believed they had the right to continue fishing there. Soon thereafter, the United States Navy seized several Canadian ships near the Pribilof Islands. Blaine entered into negotiations with Britain and the two nations agreed to submit the dispute to arbitration by a neutral tribunal. Blaine was no longer in office when the tribunal began its work, but the result was to allow the hunting once more, albeit with some regulation, and to require the United States to pay damages of $473,151. Ultimately, the nations signed the North Pacific Fur Seal Convention of 1911, which outlawed open-water seal hunting.|$|E
