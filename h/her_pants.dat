5|$|Confronting Joyce {{about the}} story, Lois {{questions}} her intentions, with Joyce revealing {{that the two}} attended high school together, where she was known as Joyce Chevapravatdumrong. She also reveals that Lois humiliated {{her in front of}} the entire school, by placing a hotdog in her mouth and pulling down <b>her</b> <b>pants</b> while blindfolded (revealing her pink underwear), and has sought revenge ever since. At church the next day, Lois and her family enter, and are immediately demanded to leave by the preacher. Becoming extremely depressed, Lois is eventually coaxed by Brian to face her mistake by showing it to the church. The porno causes the church to reaccept her and admit the Griffin family back into their congregation due to a positive opinion of the film, much to Joyce's anger. Stewie in the meantime develops suspicions of having been conceived through the creation of the porno, heightened when he sees that one of the actors has a football-shaped head like his.|$|E
5|$|The Kat {{then began}} an {{on-screen}} rivalry with Terri Runnels, although neither were fully trained wrestlers. At WrestleMania 2000, Runnels (accompanied by The Fabulous Moolah) defeated The Kat (with Mae Young) in a catfight. Val Venis was the special guest referee, {{but he was}} distracted during the match when Young kissed him, which allowed Moolah to pull The Kat out of the ring. When Venis saw {{her out of the}} ring, he declared Runnels the winner. Post-match, The Kat attacked Runnels by stripping off <b>her</b> <b>pants</b> to expose her thong. The feud continued, and the duo had an arm wrestling match at Insurrextion. Carter was victorious, but after the match, Runnels pulled The Kat's top off, exposing her breasts, which Carter allowed instead of acting disgusted or embarrassed. The two women continued to feud throughout the summer, often in mixed tag matches. In June 2000, Carter attempted to regain the Women's Championship by entering a battle royal to become the #1 contender, but she was eliminated by her rival Terri. The feud resurfaced in a 'Thong Stink Face' match at SummerSlam, which The Kat won by performing a stinkface on Runnels.|$|E

During her time with Team Xtreme, Lita became the only female to ever be physically involved in a Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match in WWF.|$|E

500|$|The second chapter, [...] "The Human Body", {{describes}} {{what happens to}} Mundin, Yolanda and Sofia in the dirty shed near the house. Yolanda plays with her boy cousin, Mundin, and {{in exchange for a}} Human Body doll and a modeling clay, shows him her genitals. Sofia also follows suit. ' [...] "Go on," [...] Mundin ordered impatiently. Fifi had caught on and lowered <b>her</b> <b>pants</b> and panties to her ankles. I gave my sister a defiant look as I lifted up my cowboy skirt, tucked it under my chin, and yanked my panties down (Alvarez, 235).' ...|$|E
500|$|The seventh {{match was}} between Melina and Torrie Wilson (managed by Candice Michelle, {{who was also}} the guest referee), in a Bra and Panties match. The only way to win a [...] "Bra and Panties" [...] match is for a wrestler to strip her {{opponent}} down to her underwear. At {{the start of the}} match, Melina pulled off Wilson's shirt to reveal her bra, but Wilson retaliated and pulled off Melina's shirt. Wilson then lifted Melina to her shoulders and dropped her to the mat, while she attempted to pull off <b>her</b> <b>pants,</b> but Melina countered the attack by pulling Wilson's pants off to win the match. Afterward, Michelle stripped Melina and then removed her own clothes, as well.|$|E
500|$|At one point, {{the project}} was nearly {{abandoned}} because Peirce was not satisfied {{with most of the}} people who auditioned. In 1996, after a hundred female actors had been considered and rejected, the relatively unknown actor Hilary Swank sent a videotape to Peirce and was signed on to the project. Swank successfully passed as a boy to the doorman at her audition. During her audition, Swank, who was 22, lied to Peirce about her age. Swank said that like Brandon she was 21 years of age. When Peirce later confronted her about her lie, Swank responded, [...] "But that's what Brandon would do". Swank's anonymity as an actor persuaded Peirce to cast her; Peirce said she did not want a [...] "known actor" [...] to portray Teena. In addition, Peirce felt that Swank's audition was [...] "the first time I saw someone who not only blurred the gender lines, but who was this beautiful, androgynous person with this cowboy hat and a sock in <b>her</b> <b>pants,</b> who smiled and loved being Brandon." ...|$|E

500|$|The local show [...] "Pawnee Today" [...] digs up an old {{video of}} Leslie {{shaking hands with}} Dexhart and overanalyzes {{every aspect of the}} short clip. Ann brings Dexhart to her home, where Ann and Leslie demand he clear Leslie's name. Dexhart refuses because the fake scandal is so docile {{compared}} to his real transgressions that it is actually positive press for him. Soon after, Ann is horrified to discover that a news crew secretly followed Dexhart to her home and took a photograph of the meeting, resulting in speculation that Ann is Leslie's lesbian lover in a three-way relationship with Dexhart. A furious Leslie schedules an appearance on [...] "Pawnee Today" [...] to clear her name once and for all. On the show, host Joan Callamezzo (Mo Collins) surprises Leslie by bringing out Dexhart, who tries to prove their affair by claiming that Leslie has a mole on her buttocks. To finally end the scandal, Leslie pulls down <b>her</b> <b>pants</b> on live television and moons Callamezzo. Since there is no mole, Dexhart is forced to admit that he fabricated the sex scandal.|$|E
500|$|Disney has {{gradually}} been introducing new, modified versions of princess costumes at the Walt Disney Parks and Resorts. In September 2016, Jasmine's outfit received a [...] "modest" [...] makeover at; a redesigned, less revealing {{version of the}} character's blue outfit from the film debuted at both Disney World and Disneyland after 24 years. The costume consists of long sleeves, new shoes, full-length top concealing her midriff, high neckline, and a modified hairstyle while retaining the original turqoise-green color from the films. <b>Her</b> <b>pants</b> have been replaced with a floor-length dress. A gold belt featuring an embroidered design of Raja's face has also {{been added to the}} costume. Jasmine introduced her new outfit to guests with a public appearance at the first Mickey’s Not-So-Scary Halloween Party. Although similar modifications were made to Pocahontas and Mulan's costumes, Jasmine's redesign has inspired the most controversial response from the public. When questioned, park attendants and cast members explain that the redesigns were made to be more accurate to the cultures from which the characters hail, although Jasmine is from a fictional kingdom, Agrabah. Rachel Paige of Hello Giggles identified the main reason for the dramatic modifications is because several park guests were complaining about the character's exposed midriff and its effects on young girls; Paige defended that the outfit is in accordance to the location and time period in which the film is set. The redesign is expected to gradually begin to appear at other Disney theme parks around the world as well.|$|E
2500|$|On February 1, 2000, {{according}} to a statement provided by Detective Jose McCallion of the Manhattan Special Victims Bureau, Lachele Covington, who was 20 {{years old at the}} time, filed a criminal complaint against Cosby alleging that on January 28, 2000, at Cosby's Manhattan townhouse, Cosby tried to put her hands down his pants and then exposed himself. Covington also alleged that Cosby grabbed her breasts and tried to put his hands down <b>her</b> <b>pants</b> at his home. Cosby was questioned and insisted [...] "it was not true". The police referred her complaint to the D.A., but they declined to prosecute.|$|E

2500|$|Juri's {{shirt was}} modeled after a spider, {{and left the}} sides of her breasts exposed at Ono's suggestion. <b>Her</b> <b>pants</b> were {{designed}} to give a [...] "silhouette that looks like a taekwondo uniform." [...] The black trim on <b>her</b> <b>pants</b> was added to set her apart from other Street Fighter characters who wear similar uniforms. Her colour scheme was originally plain. However, when lined up with other characters, she didn't stand out; as a result, they employed hot pink, a colour not used in any other female character in the game. They added black details to her outfit to make it less [...] "frivolous." [...] A pink crystal, known as the Feng Shui Engine, was added as a replacement inside her left eye after deciding to align her with Seth, in order to more closely tie her character to the organization. The crystal was originally in her stomach, similar to Seth. Other ideas were considered, including having it in one of her palms, one of her legs, or one of her ankles. They eventually settled on putting it in her eye, with design director Kamei commenting that a [...] "big globe in the stomach of a female character wasn't going to look very attractive." [...] He also commented that an eye is a logical place to have an artificial replacement, as well as already being spherical. Initially, Juri was designed to be chubbier and cuter. Gradually the design was made slimmer, though the team noted at some point they had realized they had overdone it and reversed the changes slightly. She was given full legs, and a slender upper body in order to show the contrast. Kamei wanted to make her even more slender, but decided that if she was too small, her kicks would lack impact. Several designs were considered for her face, going through about seven versions before settling on her current appearance, though time constraints played a part in the decision.|$|E
2500|$|Garvey's {{body was}} found on July 1, 1982, in Baytown, Texas, one month after she went missing. Authorities were unable to {{identify}} her body, but could determine that the victim was a white female between fifteen and twenty years old with blue eyes and had curly red hair. The {{cause of death was}} determined to be strangulation. The girl also had an inverted left nipple, O positive blood type, a scar on one foot, was approximately five feet one to [...] tall and had one of her ears pierced. Her {{body was found}} wearing brown clothing, including a long-sleeved, button-down shirt with a distinct horse embroidery on the breast pocket. <b>Her</b> <b>pants</b> were made of corduroy material. The body was disposed of in a field after she died, possibly merely hours after her murder. She was buried near two other unidentified murder victims, the Harris County Does.|$|E
2500|$|A {{garbage bag}} {{was used to}} suffocate her, as it was found around her head. She had also been {{physically}} abused and raped. Creek had been bitten on the neck and was beaten and slashed in the facial area. The bite had caused compression to her neck, which {{played a role in}} her death. The word [...] "hi" [...] was written on the girl's palm, which was raised in an upward position. A price tag from a bookstore was observed to have been present on one of her arms. She wore few clothes, as some were likely removed in the process of the assault, including her jacket and backpack containing personal items. Her underwear was later discovered inside of <b>her</b> <b>pants</b> pocket. A possible explanation to why some of her belongings were not found at the scene is that the murderer may have taken souvenirs. Authorities surmise that Creek may have been murdered by someone that may have received prostitution services from her.|$|E

2500|$|The album's {{cover is}} {{a photo of}} Amos holding a large rifle, sitting {{in a rocking chair}} on the porch of an old wooden building. One of her legs is out of <b>her</b> <b>pants</b> and flung {{over the side of the}} chair. A snake coils around the chair and a large rooster hangs from the roof of the porch. The image is a nod to her song [...] "Me and a Gun," [...] which appears on the album Little Earthquakes and recounts a rape she sustained. [...] "Well, it's [...] a {{reference}} to Me and a Gun, a song I wrote that was on Little Earthquakes. And the idea that there's a dead cock on my right and alive snake on my left. And the idea is that death and life... creation... what it's taken me to get here with men, and I don't want to be angry anymore. And you turn it over and you put the gun down, but I'm not pretending what it's taken to get me here. But no more resentment." [...] It was taken by Cindy Palmano in October 1995 in New Orleans.|$|E
2500|$|Nathan (Jimmy Bennett) and Amanda (Chloë Grace Moretz) are {{watching}} television after school at Nathan's house as their first [...] "middle school" [...] date. When {{they begin to}} kiss, his older brother Mikey (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) enters {{the living room and}} makes fun of them. Amanda then discovers she is menstruating and tries to hide it, and when Nathan sees blood on <b>her</b> <b>pants,</b> he panics and believes her to be bleeding to death, causing a debacle, which would later have Nathan and Mikey's father Steve (Patrick Warburton) and Amanda's father (Matt Walsh) involved. Amanda calls them out on their stupidity and feels embarrassed to know that she's getting her first period {{in front of them and}} they don't know what to do about it. When she leaves with her father, Nathan yells that the process of keeping the lining of her internal organs intact by inserting his erect phallus into her vagina is much too complicated and Mikey agrees. Steve cheers them up by farting in front of them. As Mikey goes to the bathroom, Nathan and Steve watch a game on television, which has a very graphic Tampax commercial in which a girl gets eaten by a shark due to her menstruating.|$|E
2500|$|In May 2008, Davis free soloed the North Face (5.11b) of the Castleton Tower, {{making her}} {{perhaps the first}} woman to have free-soloed at the 5.11+ grade. The route is rated 5.11a and is [...] of climbing. It is a famous {{formation}} in Castle Valley, Utah. After Davis climbed it, she BASE jumped from the top. In describing this climb, she referred to her climb and jump as [...] "the cleanest possible style". Davis prepared by climbing the route multiple times in April and waiting for the perfect weather conditions. BASE jumping requires specific conditions, especially around Moab, where the cliffs are so short. On 4 May, the weather and Davis' mental state coincided and she was ready to free solo the route. Although she woke up with a cold, for her the mental state was more important than the physical. However, while climbing she accidentally stepped on the cuff of <b>her</b> <b>pants,</b> which she unusually had unrolled due to cool temperatures and slipped; because she had such good hand and arm placement, however, she did not fall. The climb was filmed by a close friend, Jim Hurst. Davis has {{said in an interview that}} while she had always refused to have her free solos filmed in the past because she has known him so long and because he knows how she climbs, having him film was not an imposition. There was no communication between them during the filming.|$|E
