40|$|This {{contribution}} {{examines the}} degree of policy space the WTO leaves its Members to support <b>export</b> <b>credits</b> for non-agricultural goods. In the light of existing case law, it illustrates that <b>export</b> <b>credit</b> support offered by <b>export</b> <b>credit</b> agencies that aims at complementing the private trade finance market would in principle be prohibited under the SCM Agreement. However, while some low-income countries can rely on a specific exception on the prohibition on export subsidies, all WTO Members can, {{on the basis of}} the Illustrative List of Export Subsidies, justify certain subsidized <b>export</b> <b>credits</b> that are in accordance with the interest rate provisions of the OECD Arrangement. But, as the case law and the OECD Arrangement currently stand, subsidized <b>export</b> <b>credit</b> guarantees and <b>insurance</b> as well as subsidized short-term <b>export</b> <b>credits</b> cannot rely on this safe haven. Hence, the article shows that <b>export</b> <b>credit</b> agencies, except for those of some low-income countries, cannot play a complementary role to the private market in offering such support. Moreover, this contribution demonstrates that <b>export</b> <b>credit</b> support in accordance with the safe haven might still be countervailable and actionable. Finally, it is argued that an exception which can be modified by a subgroup of WTO Members, like the safe haven, can no longer be accepted. status: publishe...|$|R
