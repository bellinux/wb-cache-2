40|$|The {{following}} bacteriological {{studies of}} <b>Impetigo</b> <b>Contagiosa</b> {{were made by}} the author. The conclusion reached was as follows, The staphylococci derived from every case of <b>Impetigo</b> <b>Contagiosa</b> show agreement in thei characters, that is, the coagulation of milk, lique faction of gelatine, formation of haemolysin, coagulation of blood plasma, toxic action in mice, formation of acid from sugar and resistance for heat. Most of them belong to the saprophitic staphylococci. After his investigation of the decomposition of sugar the author recognizes that the factors concerned in the decomposition were nothing but the pathogene staphylococci which are classified as staphylococci by YOSHIOKA beeause they decompose sugar. They composed mannose, trehalose, mannite, galactose and lactose, but on the ther hand arabinose, raffinose and salicin were not influenced by them. Every staphylococcus derived from air had quite different characters from the coccimentioned above and there are no qualities common to each stammes...|$|E

KG, Limburg (Lahn), Germany Abstract: Infection {{is common}} in many chronic, {{inflammatory}} skin conditions but {{is often difficult to}} treat, in part due to growing bacterial resistance to antibiotics. Liposomal polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) -iodine hydrogel has a unique mode of action, combining the antiseptic and anti-inflammatory actions of PVP-iodine with the drug delivery and moisturizing properties of liposomes. We investigated the utility of liposomal PVP-iodine to treat infective dermatoses. In this prospective, single-arm (uncontrolled), open-label Phase II pilot study, patients with acne vulgaris (n= 30), atopic dermatitis (n= 20), <b>impetigo</b> <b>contagiosa</b> (n= 10), and rosacea (n= 10) received PVP-iodine (3 %) hydrogel for ≤ 4 weeks. Global Clinical Severity score improved for all dermatoses (range: 0. 5 for acne vulgaris [p< 0. 001] to 1. 0 for <b>impetigo</b> <b>contagiosa</b> [p= 0. 011]). Improvements in pain, quality of life, (Freiburg Life Quality Assessment), and Eczema Area and Severity Index scores were also seen. Treatment was well tolerated; most frequent adverse events were burning (14 %) or itching (9 %) sensations. Thus, liposomal PVP-iodine hydrogel has potential utility as an effective treatment for inflammatory skin conditions associated with bacterial colonization.

40|$|Impetigo is {{the most}} common {{bacterial}} infection of the skin, and is usually seen in children. Almost always, it is caused by Staphylococcus aureus or streptococci, or a combination of the two. 1 The source of these infections is mainly nasal or perianal colonisation, and infection is acquired by skin-to-skin contact, or from contact with nasal carriers. There are two types of impetigo: • <b>Impetigo</b> <b>contagiosa,</b> which presents as crusted lesions and characteristic honey-coloured exudates. The most affected area is the face, especially around the nose and mouth (see Figure 1). • Bullous impetigo is usually caused by Staphylococcus aureus. It presents with blisters that contain a turbid fluid. These blisters rupture and leave a “collarette ” of scale surrounding the blister roof at the periphery of th...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: Many {{hundreds}} of plant extracts {{have been tested}} for in vitro antibacterial activity. This review is a critical evaluation of controlled clinical trials of herbal medicines with anti-bacterial activity. Methods: Four electronic databases were searched for controlled clinical trials of antibacterial herbal medicines. Data were extracted and validated in a standardized fashion, according to predefined criteria, by two independent reviewers. Results: Seven clinical trials met our inclusion criteria. Four of these studies were randomized. Three trials of garlic and cinnamon treatments for Helicobacter pylori infections reported no significant effect. Bacterial infections of skin were treated in four trials. Positive results were reported for an ointment containing tea leaf extract in <b>impetigo</b> <b>contagiosa</b> infections. Two trials of tea tree oil preparations used for acne and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and one trial of Ocimum gratissimum oil for acne, reported results equivalent to conventional treat-ments. Conclusions: Few controlled clinical trials have been published and most are methodologically weak. The clinical efficacy of none of the herbal medicines {{has so far been}} demonstrated beyond doubt. This area seems to merit further study through rigorous clinical trials...|$|E
40|$|Five {{hundred and}} seventy cases of pyoderma were studied {{clinically}} and bacteriologically. Of these, 58. 8 % cases were of primary pyoderma, {{and the rest}} were secondary pyoderma. Primary pyoderma consituted <b>impetigo</b> <b>contagiosa</b> (21. 4 %), bullous impetigo (3. 3 %), ecthyma (4. 4 %), superficial folliculitis (12. 3 %), chronic folliculitis of legs (8. 8 %); forunculosis (3. 7 %) carbuncle (1. 8 %), folliculitis decalvans (0. 4 %), sycosis barbae (0. 4 %) and abscess (2. 5 %). Secondary pyderma cases were infected scabies (23. 9 %), infected wound (1. 1 %), infectious eczematoid dermatitis (12. 6 %), intertrigo (0. 4 %) and miscellaneous (3. 3 %). In 85 samples, no organism was isolated. Out of 485 samples, 75. 9 % grew a single organism and the rest (24. 1 %) gave multiple organisms.

40|$|T H E recent {{outbreak}} of staphylococcal {{toxic epidermal necrolysis}} (TEN; “ fitter’s type ” of TEN) in the Glasgow area, described by Lyell, Dick and Alexander (1969), prompted us to consider whether strains of Staphylococcus aureus isolated from TEN differ in any obvious way from strains isolated from impetigo. The histology of fitter’s type of TEN, in particular the absence of polymorphonuclear leucocytic reaction and of stainable organisms, suggested that the extensive splitting of the epidermis, which resembles the effect of scalding, {{might be due to}} a diffusible product of the staphylococcus rather than local massive proliferation of the organism. It therefore seemed of interest to investigate the patterns of toxins and enzymes produced by isolates from TEN and impetigo. At the outset it was realised that probably no single product of the staphylococcus is responsible for this particular manifestation of disease. Equally the possibility that factors specific to individual hosts may {{play a significant role in}} TEN must be acknowledged, although these have not been investigated in this study which is concerned only with the properties of the staphylococci isolated. Previous studies of staphylococci from skin infections have emphasised the association of phage-type 71 staphylococci with <b>impetigo</b> <b>contagiosa</b> (Parker...|$|E
