25|$|A {{lot of the}} {{physical}} side of it is conveyed in things like, the vampire will touch <b>her</b> <b>forearm</b> or run a hand over skin, and she just flushes all hot and cold. And for girls, that's a shorthand for all the feelings that they're not {{ready to deal with}} yet.|$|E
25|$|Like the {{two other}} examples, in plaster and stone, L'Âme de la France in bronze is a statue 3.20 m high. It depicts a helmeted female warrior {{stretching}} her two arms toward the sky, her right hand ending in a delicate little spray of flowers and, by contrast, her left fist forcefully gripping a shield slipped onto <b>her</b> <b>forearm.</b>|$|E
5000|$|IN-GA 44: Cross' assistant. She {{is a human}} replica droid, {{but without}} the hair or synthiskin {{that would make her}} seem human. Has weapons in <b>her</b> <b>forearms</b> and jets in her calves.|$|R
6000|$|It held. She {{went down}} the next two hills easily. But she was through. <b>Her</b> <b>forearms</b> and brain were equally numb. She appealed to Milt, [...] "I can't seem to go on any more. It's so dark, and I'm so tired----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{shall be}} glad {{when you can}} arrange matters. It is horrible to {{me to think of}} him still lying there." [...] She shuddered and buried her face in her hands. As she did so, the loose gown fell back from <b>her</b> <b>forearms.</b> Holmes uttered an exclamation.|$|R
500|$|A public announcement, {{posted on}} July 12, 2013, {{revealed}} {{plans for an}} ArtRave event {{the night before the}} release of Artpop, unveiling projects Gaga had been working on in collaboration with the Haus of Gaga, Dutch photographer duo Inez van Lamsweerde and Vinoodh Matadin, avant-garde theater director Robert Wilson, performance artist Marina Abramović, and Koons. The announcement featured Gaga covering her bare breasts with her arms, with <b>her</b> <b>forearm</b> [...] "Artpop" [...] tattoo in plain sight, wearing a visor designed by London College of Fashion alumna Isabell Yalda Hellysaz. Another promotional image showed Gaga with long brown hair, sporting a pair of spectacles, sitting completely naked on a chair crafted from motherboards as she displays her unicorn thigh tattoo.|$|E
2500|$|... "Selfridge {{was badly}} cut and {{sustained}} a concussion {{of the brain}} being rendered insensible. [...] He did not regain consciousness until this morning. Mrs. Selfridge was cut about the face and two bones in <b>her</b> <b>forearm</b> were broken. [...] The senior Mrs. Selfridge (Lois) and Miss Selfridge (Rosalie junior) were badly bruised.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Vegetable slice: A {{cucumber}} (or similar vegetable) is held on {{the bare}} skin of the assistant's body (usually the inside of <b>her</b> <b>forearm).</b> [...] A series of knives are thrown around the assistant, ending with a knife that slices the cucumber in half. [...] This stunt was performed by Jack Dagger on History Channel's More Extreme Marksmen and The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien.|$|E
60|$|The knife {{was lying}} in her lap. She let it slip into the fold of her dress, and laid <b>her</b> <b>forearms</b> with clasped fingers over her knees, which she pressed desperately together. The dreaded thing {{was out of sight}} at last. She felt a {{dampness}} break out all over her.|$|R
50|$|She {{turns to}} her right and begins rubbing <b>her</b> <b>forearms</b> together, then waves her hands out to her sides with palms flat and fingers outstretched, while bowing forward {{slightly}} and rocking gently. This can all be seen through the door, which remains open. After she backs to the wall again and walks away to the left, it finally closes.|$|R
60|$|His hand crept along <b>her</b> bare <b>forearm</b> and up {{and partly}} under the elbow-sleeve.|$|R
2500|$|One {{interpretation}} posits the Lamia {{may have}} been a seductress, as in Philostratus' Life of Apollonius of Tyana, where the philosopher Apollonius reveals to the young bridegroom, Menippus, his hastily married wife is really a lamia, planning to devour him. Some harlots were named [...] "Lamia". The connection between Demetrius Poliorcetes and the courtesan Lamia was notorious. In a 1909 painting by Herbert James Draper, the Lamia who moodily watches the serpent on <b>her</b> <b>forearm</b> appears to represent a hetaera. Although the lower body of Draper's Lamia is human, he alludes to her serpentine history by draping a shed snake skin about her waist. In Renaissance emblems, Lamia has the body of a serpent and the breasts and head of a woman, like the image of hypocrisy.|$|E
2500|$|On December 25, 2012, Gaga {{announced}} a documentary celebrating [...] "life, {{the creation of}} Artpop + you", which she described {{as a gift to}} her fans. The documentary was directed by Terry Richardson, a previous collaborator on the photography book Lady Gaga x Terry Richardson, but remained unreleased. A public announcement, posted on July 12, 2013 on the singer's social media, revealed plans for an [...] "ArtRave" [...] event the night before the release of Artpop, unveiling projects Gaga had been working on in collaboration with the Haus of Gaga, Dutch photographer duo Inez van Lamsweerde and Vinoodh Matadin, avant-garde theater director Robert Wilson, performance artist Marina Abramović and artist Jeff Koons.

60|$|She {{stopped with}} a sudden sob. <b>Her</b> <b>forearm</b> fell upon the mantelpiece, and her {{forehead}} upon <b>her</b> <b>forearm.</b> In an instant Maude was by her side, the tears running down her cheeks, for the sight of grief was always grief to her, and her nerves were weakened by this singular interview.|$|E
30|$|The {{fractures}} {{were treated}} nonoperatively with elastic tubular bandage. The patient was advised to avoid pulling herself up the banister with <b>her</b> <b>forearms.</b> Occupational rehabilitation therapy was organised, and {{changes were made}} to her home setup {{so that she could}} negotiate stairs with a stair lift instead of using her arms. Both fractures healed well with conservative management by 12  weeks.|$|R
60|$|She {{was a tall}} girl; {{the fence}} was low, and she could spread her elbows on the top. Her hands would be red with the bit of washing she had done, but <b>her</b> <b>forearms</b> were white and shapely, and she would look at her father's {{landlord}} in silence--in an informed silence which had an air of knowledge, expectation and desire.|$|R

60|$|She sat very still, and {{his eyes}} rested on that {{ornament}} for a moment, and then travelled slowly to her wrist and the soft lines of <b>her</b> <b>forearm.</b>|$|E

60|$|She held it out, {{the blood}} making her {{conscious}} of her weakness. Stewart's fingers felt so firm and sure. Swiftly he ripped the wet sleeve. <b>Her</b> <b>forearm</b> {{had been cut}} or scratched. He washed off the blood.|$|E
60|$|Saxon shuddered, then {{resigned}} {{herself to}} Billy's playful {{demonstration of the}} weak points in the human anatomy. He pressed {{the tip of a}} finger into the middle of <b>her</b> <b>forearm,</b> and she knew excruciating agony. On either side of her neck, at the base, he dented gently with his thumbs, and she felt herself quickly growing unconscious.|$|E
60|$|Forgetful of safety, of his {{own life}} itself, entranced by the wonder of the unthinkable and unguessable thing, he raised his knife to strike heavily from a long stroke, but was {{prevented}} by Balatta. She upreared on her own knees in an agony of terror, clasping his knees and supplicating him to desist. In the intensity of her desire to impress him, she put <b>her</b> <b>forearm</b> between her teeth and sank them to the bone.|$|E
2500|$|Lawrence Singleton, who raped a teenaged {{girl and}} cut off <b>her</b> <b>forearms,</b> spent a year on parole in a trailer {{on the grounds of}} San Quentin between 1987 and 1988 because towns in California would not accept him as a parolee.

She managed to pull herself back up the cliff and alert a passerby, who {{took her to a}} hospital. By the time of Singleton's arrest, Vincent wore {{prosthetic}} arms.|$|R
50|$|In Elseworld's Finest: Supergirl & Batgirl, where Barbara Gordon is Batgirl {{after her}} father was killed saving the Waynes and Bruce is {{essentially}} her Alfred rather than Batman, she initially wore the standard Batgirl costume from the comics.

6000|$|... 'What a devil!' he exclaimed. But {{it was as}} if he had had {{knowledge}} of her in the long red rent of <b>her</b> <b>forearm,</b> so silken and soft. He did not want to touch her. He would have to make himself touch her, deliberately. The long, shallow red rip seemed torn across his own brain, tearing the surface of his ultimate consciousness, letting through the forever unconscious, unthinkable red ether of the beyond, the obscene beyond.|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't {{know what}} life was till I could do that." [...] She took up a large {{dumb-bell}} and, extending it at arm's length, whirled it back and forth. <b>Her</b> <b>forearm,</b> white and smooth, swelled into strong action, and her supple hands had the unwavering power and pressure of an athlete, and withal Ware thought: [...] "She is feminine.

60|$|She {{had taken}} a lesson from him. Instead of holding the heavy weapon extended, the butt of it and <b>her</b> <b>forearm</b> rested on the table, the muzzle pointed, not at his head, but his chest. And he, looking coolly and obeying her commands, {{knew there was no}} chance of the kick-up of the recoil {{producing}} a miss. Also, he saw that the revolver did not wabble, nor the hand shake, and he was thoroughly conversant with the size of hole the soft-nosed bullets could make. He had eyes, not for her, but for the hammer, which had risen under the pressure of her forefinger on the trigger.|$|E
