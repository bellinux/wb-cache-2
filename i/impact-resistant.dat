2500|$|The Akdal MKA 1919 is a gas operated, {{semi-automatic}} shotgun {{that resembles}} the M16 rifle and mimics the layout and placement {{of some of}} the controls. It was created by Turkish company Akdal Arms. [...] The MKA 1919 uses a conventional gas-operated action which is located around the support tube that runs below the barrel. The return spring is also located around the same support tube which is concealed by an enlarged polymer handguard. The MKA 1919 barrel can be quickly removed from upper receiver. To charge the rifle, the charging handle on the receiver must be pulled. The upper receiver is manufactured from an aluminum alloy while the lower receiver, along with pistol grip and shoulder stock, is manufactured as one piece from <b>impact-resistant</b> polymer. Akdal MKA 1919 semi-automatic rifle has a 5-round detachable box magazine. It has a bolt release identical in location and [...] function to the one on the M16. Manual safety also duplicates M16-style being located {{on the left side of}} the receiver above the pistol grip. Standard sights include a front post installed on the M16-style removable base and a detachable M16A2-style carrying handle with built-in diopter sight. On the upper receiver, an integral Picatinny rail exists which will accept detachable carrying handle or optional red-dot or other optical sight attachments.|$|E
2500|$|The , [...] lane is bordered {{along its}} length by semicylindrical {{channels}} called [...] "gutters", which {{are designed to}} collect errant balls. The overall width of the lane including the channels is [...] [...] The narrow lane prevents bowling a straight line at the angle required to consistently carry (knock down) all ten pins for a strike. Most skillful bowlers will roll a side spinning (hook shape reaction) ball to overcome this. A foul line is marked at the seam of {{the start of the}} lane and end of the approach. If any part of a bowler's body touches the line itself or beyond (anywhere on the actual lane surface or any adjoining areas including walls and other lanes) after the ball is delivered, the bowl is a foul and any pins knocked over by that delivery are scored as zero (0). The bowler is allowed one shot at a new rack of ten pins if s/he fouled on the first roll of a frame, and if all ten pins are knocked down on this shot, it is scored as a spare. Behind the foul line is an [...] "approach" [...] approximately [...] long used to gain speed and leverage on the ball before delivering it. [...] from the foul line, where the lane terminates, it is joined to a roughly [...] deep by [...] wide surface of durable and <b>impact-resistant</b> material called the [...] "pin deck", upon which each rack of pins is set.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} Grand Am {{was introduced}} in the fall of 1972 as a 1973 model. It was based on the GM A platform (A-body) along with other cars such as the Chevrolet Chevelle, Pontiac LeMans, Pontiac GTO, Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme, and the Buick Century. The GM A-body platform had major design revisions in 1973 that included the elimination of pillarless hardtops due to proposed Federal rollover standards, but with frameless windows similar to that of a hardtop. No convertibles were produced due to the rollover standards (that never were enacted). In addition to Federal emissions regulations, new safety standards required a 5 mi/h km/h <b>impact-resistant</b> front bumper and a 2.5 mi/h km/h <b>impact-resistant</b> rear bumper, which increased to 5 mi/h km/h for 1974.|$|E

5000|$|Metals can be {{heat-treated}} {{to alter}} the properties of strength, ductility, toughness, hardness and/or resistance to corrosion. Common heat treatment processes include annealing, precipitation strengthening, quenching, and tempering. The annealing process softens the metal by heating it and then allowing it to cool very slowly, which gets rid of stresses in the metal and makes the grain structure large and soft-edged {{so that when the}} metal is hit or stressed it dents or perhaps bends, rather than breaking; it is also easier to sand, grind, or cut annealed metal. Quenching is the process of cooling a high-carbon steel very quickly after heating, thus [...] "freezing" [...] the steel's molecules in the very hard martensite form, which makes the metal harder. There is a balance between hardness and toughness in any steel; the harder the steel, the less tough or <b>impact-resistant</b> it is, and the more <b>impact-resistant</b> it is, the less hard it is. Tempering relieves stresses in the metal that were caused by the hardening process; tempering makes the metal less hard while making it better able to sustain impacts without breaking.|$|E
