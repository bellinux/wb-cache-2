Understanding {{the complex}} {{interactions}} between <b>gametes,</b> <b>embryos</b> <b>and</b> the maternal tract is required knowledge for combating infertility and developing newmethods of contraception. Here we present somemain aspects of spermatozoa {{interactions with the}} mammalian oviduct before fertilisation and discuss how computational modelling {{can be used as}} an invaluable aid to experimental investigation in this field. A complete predictive computational model of <b>gamete</b> <b>and</b> <b>embryo</b> interactions with the female reproductive tract is a long way off. However, the enormity of this task should not discourage us from working towards it. Computational modelling allows us to investigate aspects of maternal communication with <b>gametes</b> <b>and</b> <b>embryos,</b> which are financially, ethically or practically difficult to look at experimen-tally. In silicomodels of maternal communication with <b>gametes</b> <b>and</b> <b>embryos</b> can be used as tools to complement in vivo experiments, {{in the same way as}} in vitro and in situ models...|$|R

Cryopreservation provides an efficient and effective way to maintain these unique genetically modified rodent lines. However, there is a great risk of transmitting various diseases via the cryopreserved <b>gametes</b> <b>and</b> <b>embryos.</b> To investigate which of the commonly found murine pathogens contaminate mouse <b>gametes</b> <b>and</b> <b>embryos,</b> seven commonly found pathogens in research mice were evaluated in semen, oocyte-cumulus complexes <b>and</b> <b>embryos</b> collected from naturally infected mice {{in the first part of}} my study. These seven pathogens are: mouse parvovirus, Helicobacter, Mycoplasma pulmonis, Pasteurella pneumotropica, murine norovirus, mouse hepatitis virus and Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus.

40|$|International audiencePremise of the study: Many {{flowers are}} pollinated by {{potentially}} hungry insects, yet flowers also contain <b>gametes</b> <b>and</b> <b>embryos</b> {{which must be}} protected from predation. Microscopic calcium oxalate crystals in plant tissues have been proposed to protect against herbivory. Aroids, which have an unusual diversity of such crystals, also exhibit diverse pollination strategies. Many species have pollinators that do not feed while visiting the flowers, while other species, especially those pollinated by beetles, offer sterile staminodia as food rewards. We examined flowers of 21 aroid species with various pollination strategies {{to test the hypothesis}} that crystals protect vital <b>gametes</b> <b>and</b> <b>embryos</b> while allowing consumption of food bribes. Methods: Aroid inflorescences collected from the field or from greenhouse material were sectioned, cleared, and examined by bright field and polarization microscopy. Key results: All species examined, regardless of pollination strategy, arrayed crystals around unshed pollen and ovules. Less vital tissues, such as odoriferous appendages, had few crystals. Staminodia offered as food to beetle pollinators, however, differed greatly between species in their crystal contents. Some had minimal crystals; some had crystals in patterns suggesting they limit beetle feeding; still others had abundant crystals in no obvious pattern. Conclusions: The results are consistent with crystals protecting against insect predation of <b>gametes</b> <b>and</b> <b>embryos.</b> However, the role of crystals in food-bribe staminodia is unclear. They may limit and direct feeding by beetles in some species, while in others they might have no protective role...|$|R
40|$|The {{social and}} legal {{acceptability}} of third-party reproduction varies around the world. In Australia, <b>gamete</b> <b>and</b> <b>embryo</b> donation <b>and</b> surrogacy are permitted within {{the regulatory framework}} set out by federal and state governments. The aim {{of this paper is}} to describe the social context and regulatory framework for third-party reproduction in Australia. This is a review of current laws and regulations related to third-party reproduction in Australia. Although subtle between-state differences exist, third-party reproduction is by and large a socially acceptable and legally permissible way to form a family throughout Australia. The overarching principles that govern the practice of third-party reproduction are altruism; the right of donor-conceived people to be informed of their biological origins; and the provision of comprehensive counselling about the social, psychological, physical, ethical, financial and legal implications of third-party reproduction to those considering donating or receiving <b>gametes</b> or <b>embryos</b> <b>and</b> entering surrogacy arrangements. These principles ensure that donors are not motivated by financial gain, donor offspring can identify and meet with the person or persons who donated <b>gametes</b> or <b>embryos,</b> <b>and</b> prospective donors and recipients are aware of and have carefully considered the potential consequences of third-party reproduction. Australian state laws and federal guidelines prohibit commercial and anonymous third-party reproduction; mandate counselling of all parties involved in <b>gamete</b> <b>and</b> <b>embryo</b> donation <b>and</b> surrogacy arrangements; and require clinics to keep records with identifying and non-identifying information about the donor/s to allow donor-conceived offspring to trace their biological origins...|$|R

40|$|In vitro culture, storage, <b>and</b> {{manipulation}} of <b>gametes</b> <b>and</b> <b>embryos</b> require meticulously adjusted {{conditions to avoid}} or minimize {{the harmful effects of}} uncontrolled stress. However, recent work indicates that a well-defined and properly applied stress may induce general adaptation and increase tolerance to various in vitro procedures. The aim of this review is to summarize reports on the effects of stress on <b>gametes</b> <b>and</b> <b>embryos</b> of several species. Treatment with sublethal doses of high hydrostatic pressure (HHP), or osmotic, heat, or oxidative stress resulted in increased morphological survival, fertilizing ability, or developmental potential after various in vitro or in vivo procedures. HHP treatment of spermatozoa, oocytes, <b>embryos,</b> <b>and</b> embryonic stem cells increased fertilizing ability, developmental competence, and differentiation and improved results after cryopreservation, parthenogenetic activation, intracytoplasmic sperm injection, and somatic cell nuclear transfer. Osmotic stress of oocytes resulted in higher developmental rates after cryopreservation, parthenogenetic activation, and somatic cell nuclear transfer. Heat shock was reported to increase developmental competence of parthenogenetically activated oocytes. Although cellular and subcellular mechanisms supposedly contributing to these processes require further research, the new principle, i. e., to improve the stress tolerance by a defined sublethal stress, may outline a completely new strategy in mammalian embryology, as well as cryopreservation of other cells and tissues with remarkable theoretical and practical consequences...|$|R
40|$|After a {{long journey}} {{travelling}} up the maternal tract the spermatozoa will meet the oocyte.

These short but vital journeys of <b>gametes</b> <b>and</b> <b>embryos</b> are accompanied by important changes in the maternal tract. In particular, from the oviduct, which provides an optimal environment for <b>gamete</b> maturation <b>and</b> transport, fertilization <b>and</b> early <b>embryo</b> development. In fact, to achieve a successful pregnancy the oviduct should keep a fruitful dialogue with the gametes followed by an appropriate communication with the embryo(s). In the present review, the transcriptomic and proteomic changes induced by <b>gametes</b> <b>and</b> <b>embryos</b> in the oviduct {{as a result of}} this early dialogue will be reported.

40|$|The {{continued}} {{significance of}} {{human embryonic stem}} cell research and recent advances in human somatic cell nuclear transfer <b>and</b> human <b>gamete</b> <b>and</b> <b>embryo</b> gene editing have given rise to renewed debates on the donation and use of human <b>embryos</b> <b>and</b> oocytes for research, therapies, and commercial applications. Sociological studies of cell and tissue donation have also indicated that the ethical procedures and social and moral values that surround the donation and use of human reproductive tissues for research do often differ across countries. This chapter addresses the donation of human embryos for human {{embryonic stem cell research}} in China. The chapter is based on interviews with 15 IVF clinicians, 15 stem cell researchers, and 15 IVF patients who were asked to donate their embryos for hESC research. Part I focuses on the role and enactment of informed consent procedures. A question that I ask in this respect is what ideas are communicated to potential embryo donors, so that the donation of their spare embryos for hESC research appears reasonable and justifiable? Based on interview data I will illustrate a variety of rhetorical practices and strategies that underpin informed consent procedures. These range from the responsible facilitation of informed choice that emphasizes patient autonomy and the right to refuse donation to more problematic rhetorical practices that involve the provision of false facts and patient deception. Part II discusses these findings in light of the regulatory context in which human embryonic stem cells are produced, banked, and distributed in China. To illustrate the specific effects of this regulatory system, I will draw on a comparison with the regulatory situation in the UK. The chapter concludes that there is often a significant gap between {{the ways in which the}} value and use of donated embryos is described to patients and the actual forms of value that these tissues gain in the context of research, distribution, and commercial use. With the renewed importance of human <b>gametes</b> <b>and</b> <b>embryos</b> for human genome editing, these findings indicate that there is the need for more, critical in-depth research into actual donation practices of <b>gametes</b> <b>and</b> <b>embryos</b> <b>and</b> into the needs and perceptions of human tissue donors...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThere is {{a natural}} curiosity about how organisms give rise to {{offspring}} like themselves {{through a series of}} reproducible developmental events and how, once mature, these offspring mate and continue the process giving rise the next generation. In the mid- 1800 s investigators started using <b>gametes</b> <b>and</b> <b>embryos</b> to explore this process. Although the observations and experimental approaches changed over time, embryologists and developmental biologists after them, sought understanding of development and inheritance through the study of <b>gametes</b> <b>and</b> <b>embryos.</b> It is argued here that in their quests to understand these processes embryologists made major conceptual advances that were seminal to the origins of genetics and to the origins of molecular biology. Furthermore these advances derived from the distinct perspective of those investigators with focused interest {{on the development of the}} organism. In this essay fundamental discoveries that originated with the sea urchin embryo as an experimental system are used to illustrate this position. The sea urchin has a long and uninterrupted history as a model organism that helped prepare the ground for the emergence of genetics and contributed important aspects to understanding of the central dogma of molecular biology.

40|$|Non-invasive <b>gamete</b> <b>and</b> <b>embryo</b> {{assessment}} {{is considered an}} important focus in assisted reproductive technologies (ART). Currently, the selection of embryos for transfer is based on morphological indices. Though successful, the field of ART would benefit from a non-invasive quantitative method of viability determination. Omics technologies, including transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics, have already begun providing evidence that viable <b>gametes</b> <b>and</b> <b>embryos</b> possess unique molecular profiles with potential biomarkers that can be utilized for developmental and/or viability selection. Unlike the human genome that is relatively fixed and steady throughout the human body, the human proteome, estimated at over a million proteins, is more complex, diverse and dynamic.

Of particular interest in ART is the secretome, those proteins that are produced within the <b>embryo</b> <b>and</b> secreted into the surrounding environment. Defining the human embryonic secretome has the potential to expand our knowledge of embryonic cellular processes, including the complex dialogue between the developing <b>embryo</b> <b>and</b> its maternal environment, and may also assist in identifying those embryos with the highest implantation potential.

40|$|Currently, {{even the}} most {{sophisticated}} methods of assisted reproductive technology (ART) allow us to achieve live births in only approximately 30 % of patients, indicating that {{our understanding of the}} fine mechanisms underlying reproduction is far from ideal. One of the main challenges associated with studies of <b>gamete</b> structure <b>and</b> function is that these cells are remarkably resistant towards the uptake of exogenous substances, including 'molecular research tools' such as drugs, biomolecules and intracellular markers. This phenomenon can affect not only the performance of reproductive biology research techniques, but also the outcomes of the in vitro handling of gametes, which forms the cornerstone of ART. Improvement of intra-gamete delivery in a non-aggressive fashion is vital for the investigation of <b>gamete</b> physiology, <b>and</b> the advancement of infertility treatment. In this review, we outline the current state of nanomaterial-mediated delivery into <b>gametes</b> <b>and</b> <b>embryos</b> in vitro, <b>and</b> discuss the potential of a novel exciting drug delivery technology, based upon the use of targeted 'natural' nanoparticles known as extracellular vesicles (EVs), for reproductive science and ART, given the promising emerging data from other fields. A comprehensive electronic search of PubMed and Web of Science databases was performed using the following keywords: 'nanoparticles', 'nanomaterials', 'cell-penetrating peptides', 'sperm', 'oocyte', 'egg', 'embryo', 'exosomes', 'microvesicles', 'extracellular vesicles', 'delivery', 'reproduction', to identify the relevant research and review articles, published in English up to January 2015. The reference lists of identified publication were then scanned to extract additional relevant publications. Biocompatible engineered nanomaterials with high loading capacity, stability and selective affinity represent a potential versatile tool for the minimally invasive internalization of molecular cargo into <b>gametes</b> <b>and</b> <b>embryos.</b> However, it is becoming increasingly clear that the translation of these experimental tools into clinical applications is likely to be limited by their non-biodegradable nature. To allow the subsequent use of these methodologies for clinical ART, studies should utilize biodegradable delivery platforms, which mimic natural mechanisms of molecular cargo trafficking as closely as possible. Currently, EVs represent the most physiological intracellular delivery tools for reproductive science and medicine. These natural mediators of cell communication combine the benefits of engineered nanomaterials, such as the potential for in vitro production, targeting and loading, with the essential feature of biodegradability. We anticipate that future investigations into the possibility of applying EVs for the intentional intracellular delivery of molecular compounds into <b>gametes</b> <b>and</b> <b>embryos</b> will open new horizons for reproductive science and clinical ART, ultimately leading to improvements in patient care...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Transport of <b>gametes</b> <b>and</b> <b>embryos</b> is an {{important}} function of the Fallopian tube. Both muscular contractions and cilia activity {{are involved in the}} transportation. Prostaglandins (PGs) are known mediators of muscular contractility. PG receptors have previously been demonstrated in the human Fallopian tube. The aim was to study the effect of PGs and progestagens, antiprogestin, hCG and oxytocin on muscular contractions in the human Fallopian tube, and the hormonal regulation of PG receptors. METHODS: Twenty-two healthy women oper-ated for benign causes were included in the study. The ampullary-isthmic junction of the Fallopian tubes was excised and used for in vitro contractility studies. The effect of PGE 1, PGE 2, PGF 2 a, progesterone, mifepristone, levonorges-trel, oxytocin and hCG on contractility was studied. Explants of Fallopian tubes were cultured for 24 h to study the effect of progestagens and hCG on the expression of PG receptors using immunohistochemistry and real-time PCR. RESULTS: Muscular contractions increased after treatment with PGF 2 a and PGE 2 (P < 0. 05). The contractions decreased after PGE 1, progesterone, levonorgestrel, mifepristone, oxytocin and hCG (P < 0. 05). In tubal explant studies, relative mRNA expression of EP 1, EP 2, EP 3 and FP increased after levonorgestrel treatment (P < 0. 05). Mifepristone and levonorgestrel treatment increased immunostaining intensity of EP 1 and EP 2 protein, in lumen, muscle and vessels. Progesterone and mifepristone increased immunostaining of FP in vessels.

40|$|In several species, {{a family}} of nuclear receptors, the {{peroxisome}} proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) composed of three isotypes, is expressed in somatic cells and germ cells of the ovary {{as well as the}} testis. Invalidation of these receptors in mice or stimulation of these receptors in vivo or in vitro showed that each receptor has physiological roles in the gamete maturation or the embryo development. In addition, synthetic PPAR gamma ligands are recently used to induce ovulation in women with polycystic ovary disease. These results reveal the positive actions of PPAR in reproduction. On the other hand, xenobiotics molecules (in herbicides, plasticizers, or components of personal care products), capable of activating PPAR, may disrupt normal PPAR functions in the ovary or the testis and have consequences {{on the quality of the}} <b>gametes</b> <b>and</b> the <b>embryos.</b> Despite the recent data obtained on the biological actions of PPARs in reproduction, relatively little is known about PPARs in <b>gametes</b> <b>and</b> <b>embryos.</b> This review summarizes the current knowledge on the expression and the function of PPARs as well as their partners, retinoid X receptors (RXRs), in germ cells <b>and</b> preimplantation <b>embryos.</b> The effects of natural and synthetic PPAR ligands will also be discussed from the perspectives of reproductive toxicology and assisted reproductive technology...|$|R
40|$|The {{mammalian}} oviduct {{provides an}} optimal {{environment for the}} maturation of <b>gametes,</b> fertilization, <b>and</b> early embryonic development. Secretory cells lining the lumen of the mammalian oviduct synthesize and secrete proteins that {{have been shown to}} interact with and influence the activities of <b>gametes</b> <b>and</b> <b>embryos.</b> We hypothesized that the presence of gametes in the oviduct alters the oviductal secretory proteomic profile. We used a combination of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to identify oviductal protein secretions that were altered in response to the presence of gametes in the oviduct. The oviductal response to spermatozoa was different from its response to oocytes as verified by Western blotting. The presence of spermatozoa or oocytes in the oviduct altered the secretio...|$|R
40|$|Most embryo {{research}} {{takes place in}} the context of assisted reproductive technology (ART) and as a result, discussion of <b>embryo</b> research ethics <b>and</b> policy falls primarily within that context. In addition, because {{embryo research}} involves the use of tissues of men and women, some issues of concern are also discussed in the context of human subjects research policy and regulation. Enshrined throughout the governing guidelines and policy documents are the principles of free and informed consent, human dignity, the health and welfare of women and children, non-commercialization of <b>gametes</b> <b>and</b> <b>embryos,</b> respect for privacy and confidentiality, and a respect for embryos that requires limits on their use and creation. Accordingly, Canada’s governance of stem cell researc...|$|R
