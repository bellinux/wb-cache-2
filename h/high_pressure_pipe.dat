The use of micro-turbines or pumps operating as turbines (PT) seem to be an alternative and sustainable solution to either control the pressure as well to produce energy.

40|$|AbstractAn {{integrated}} 3 D CFD based {{model to}} calculate the leak rates of supercritical CO 2 from high pressure tanks and pipelines and its subsequent atmospheric dispersion is developed. The first component of the model {{takes into account the}} transition flow of supercritical CO 2 under the action of large pressure changes through small flow passages such as orifices and leaks in <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>pipe</b> walls. It considers steep changes in transport and thermodynamic properties using appropriate equations of state for the wide range of pressures involved. The second component of the model calculates the large scale dispersion through the ambient air. This model includes consideration of the formation of dry ice due to sudden expansion and subsequent sublimation of dry ice due to entrainment of relatively hot ambient air. It also takes into account the effects of surrounding wind field using an atmospheric boundary layer model. The first model is validated by comparing the computed mass flow rates with the experimental data for transition flow through short-tube orifices and then for a high pressure tank of CO 2 emptied through a small orifice.

The spray impact force of each nozzle hole of a conventional injection system of pump-line-nozzle for diesel engine (based on the spray momentum flux) and the injection pressure (on a fuel injection pump test rig) were measured. With varying fuel injection quantities and pump speed, the effects of the {{inner diameter}} of the <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> fuel <b>pipe</b> on fuel injection process and the fuel injection characteristics of each nozzle hole were analyzed. It was noted from experimental results that the fuel injection pressure changes with variations in the inner diameter of the <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> fuel <b>pipe</b> and also the injection duration gradually increases with increase in the inner diameter. At low injection pump speed, even with the same geometric fuel deliver rate, the injection duration also increases gradually. Due to throttling effect and reduction in injection pressure, the fuel injection quantities of the injection nozzle were relatively minimal when the inner diameters of the <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> fuel <b>pipe</b> were respectively small and large. The optimum injection pipe inner diameter for the right quantity for fuel injection falls between the two cases (between small and large).

The sensors are created inside optical fibres (usually standard telecommunication fibres); the optical fibres technology allows to install the sensors on structures working in harsh environments, since the materials are almost insensitive to corrosion, the monitoring system can be positioned far away from the sensors without sensible signal losses, and there is no risk of electric discharge. FBG sensors can be used to create strain gages, thermometers or accelerometers, depending on the coating on the grating, on the way the grating is fixed to the structure, and on the presence of a specifically designed interface that can act as a transducer.

40|$|Diesel {{combustion}} and {{the formation}} of pollutants are directly influenced by the spatial and temporal distributions of the fuel within the combustion chamber of an internal combustion engine. The requirements for more efficient and responsive diesel engines have led to the introduction and implementation of multiple injection strategies. However, the effects of such injection modes on the hydraulic systems, such as the <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>pipes</b> and fuel injectors, must be thoroughly examined and compensated for. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the effects of fuel injection equipment characterisation and optimisation on diesel combustion and emissions with two-stage fuel injection. The fuel injection system was characterised and optimised through the measurement of the fuel injection rate and quantity, in particular, the interaction between the two injection events was quantified and compensated for. The effects of twin and variable split two-stage injection and dwell angle on diesel combustion and emissions were investigated in a high-speed direct injection single-cylinder optical diesel engine using heat release analysis and high-speed fuel spray and combustion visualisation technique. The results indicated that two-stage injection has the potential for simultaneous reduction of NO and soot emissions. Nevertheless, the studied two-stage strategies resulted in higher soot emission, mainly due to the interaction between two consecutive fuel injection events, whereby the fuel sprays during the second injection were injected into burning regions, generating fuel-rich combustion. In addition, the variable two-stage strategies produced high levels of uHC emission in comparison to single and twin split injection cases. This was mainly attributed to firstly greater fuel quantity injected during the second injection and secondly poor mixing and air utilisation during the second fuel injection event. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|In {{this work}} {{designing}} and pricing {{of the recovery}} boiler were studied. The main goal was {{to find out how}} furnace screen heat transfer surface affects the recovery boiler price and performance. Two different boiler sizes were studied. Four different boilers were designed in both boiler sizes. One boiler was designed without furnace screen and three others with different size of furnace screens. The boilers were desinged so that they reached the same performances and were comparable. The furnace screen is an effective heat transfer surface and by adding the furnace screen the furnace can be designed lower. Furnace height has a significant effect on the total price of the boiler. On the other hand, the reduced furnace height yields shorter flue gas residence time, which can lead to incomplete combustion resulting e. g. increased emissions. Combustion air ratio and mixing of reactants with the air jets have a great effect on the combustion efficiency. In this study, the reduced residence time was compensated by the higher combustion air ratio by feeding more combustion air into the furnace. This way the effective mixing and the complete combustion were ensured. In order to find out the required amount of combustion air for the complete combustion CFD simulations and field data analysis were made. The target was to find out the effect of the combustion air ratio and the residence time on the CO emissions. According to these results boilers with the different heights could be designed so that they achieve also the same CO emissions. The designed boilers were priced and compared.

40|$|AbstractThe {{water hammer}} hazards are mainly in four aspects: the <b>high</b> water <b>pressure</b> {{bursting}} <b>pipes,</b> the vacuum flattening pipes and leading to water pollution, the cavitation damaging the pipes and pump impellers, {{as well as}} the transient force loosing the pipe joints. We presented a method to calculate five risk factors: the above four factors plus a composite risk factor. The pipe rupture risk assessment method and procedure were proposed through a water supply pipe network risk prediction flow chart. A real engineering case of CD city of China was used to illustrate the assessment method. The technology was proved correct, and the pipe rupture risk prediction and classification maps can be used to provide technical guidance for the water distribution network design and operation maintenance...|$|R
