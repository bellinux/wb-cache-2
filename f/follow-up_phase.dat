40|$|Background. Dysmenorrhea and {{accompanying}} symptoms {{can have a}} negative impact on academic achievement, physical activity and functioning, and quality of life. Unfortunately, stress increases the sensitivity and severity of pain, activating sympathetic responses while inhibiting parasympathetic responses. Objective. This study used objective, physiological measurements to evaluate the effects of auricular acupressure on menstrual pain and menstrual distress in young college students with primary dysmenorrhea across two menstrual cycles. The aim was to determine if significant differences could be detected between the intervention and <b>follow-up</b> <b>phases</b> after controlling life stress. Design. A one-group experimental research design was used, and repeated measurements and followups were done. Thirty-two women completed questionnaires and physiological parameters were measured. Results. Significant differences between the intervention and <b>follow-up</b> <b>phases</b> were found for high frequency (HF) and blood pressure on day 1 and no significant differences in menstrual pain and menstrual distress, heart rate variability, low frequency (LF), LF/HF ratio, or heart rate. Conclusion. Auricular acupressure effectively increases parasympathetic activity to maintain autonomic function homeostasis in young women with primary dysmenorrhea and may have a value in alleviating menstrual pain and menstrual distress in a high-stress life. Future studies should consider stress, stimulus dose of auricular acupressure, severity of menstrual pain, and a longitudinal research design...|$|R

50|$|The {{goals of}} genetic {{counseling}} are to increase understanding of genetic diseases, discuss disease management options, {{and explain the}} risks and benefits of testing. Counseling sessions focus on giving vital, unbiased information and non-directive assistance in the patient's decision-making process.

The initial contact phase is when the counselor and families meet and build rapport. The encounter phase includes dialogue between the counselor and the client about the nature of screening and diagnostic tests. The summary phase provides all the options and decisions available for the next step. If counselees wish to go ahead with testing, an appointment is organized and the genetic counselor acts as the person to communicate the results.|$|E

40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVES: A high-strain job (a {{combination}} of high job demands and low job control) {{is expected to}} increase the risk of health problems, whereas an active job (high demands and high control) can be hypothesised to be associated with a greater capacity to learn. We tested associations between high-strain and active jobs and cognitive function in middle-aged men and women. METHODS: Data on 4146 British civil servants (2989 men and 1157 women) aged 35 - 55 years at baseline came from the Whitehall II study. Cumulative exposure to both high-strain and active jobs was assessed at phases 1 (1985 - 1988), 2 (1989 - 1990) and 3 (1991 - 1993). Cognitive performance was assessed at phases 5 (1997 - 1999) and 7 (2003 - 2004) using the following tests: verbal memory, inductive reasoning (Alice Heim), verbal meaning (Mill Hill), phonemic and semantic fluency. Analyses were adjusted for age, sex and employment grade. RESULTS: Longer exposure to high job strain and shorter exposure to active jobs were associated with lower scores in most of the cognitive performance tests. However, these associations disappeared on adjustment for employment grade. Phonemic fluency was an exception to this pattern. Associations between exposure to an active job and phonemic fluency at both <b>follow-up</b> <b>phases</b> were robust to adjustment for employment grade. However, there was no association between exposure to active jobs and change in phonemic fluency score between the <b>follow-up</b> <b>phases</b> after adjustment for employment grade. CONCLUSIONS: In these data, associations between cumulative exposure to high-strain or active jobs and cognition are largely explained by socioeconomic position...|$|R
50|$|Gain-of-function H3K27M {{mutations}} in protein histone H3 lead to inactivation of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) methyltransferase {{and result in}} global hypomethylation of H3K27me3 and transcriptional derepression of potential oncogenes. About 40% of these mutation are associated with gain of function or amplifications {{mutations in}} the PDGFRA gene in cases of pediatric diffuse Gliomas of the pons.

40|$|In this paper, we aim {{to better}} {{understand}} the factors that contribute to the substantive performance of EIA systems in low and middle income countries. Substantive performance is defined as {{the extent to which the}} EIA process contributes to the EIA objectives for the long term, namely environmental protection or, even more ambitious, sustainable development. We have therefore developed a conceptual model in which we focus on the key actors in the EIA system, the proponent and the EIA authority and their level of ownership as a key capacity to measure their performance, and we distinguish procedural performance and some contextual factors. This conceptual model is then verified and refined for the EIA phase and the EIA <b>follow-up</b> <b>phase</b> (permitting, monitoring and enforcement) by means of 12 case studies from Ghana (four cases) and Georgia (eight cases), both lower-middle income countries. We observe that in most cases the level of substantive performance increases during the EIA phase but drops during the EIA <b>follow-up</b> <b>phase,</b> and as a result only five out of 12 operational cases are in compliance with permit conditions or national environmental standards. We conclude, firstly that ownership of the proponent is the most important factor explaining the level of substantive performance; the higher the proponent's level of ownership the higher the level of substantive performance. The influence of the EIA authority on substantive performance is limited. Secondly, the influence of procedural performance on substantive performance seems less important than expected in the EIA phase but more important during the EIA <b>follow-up</b> <b>phase.</b> In order to improve substantive performance we learned two lessons. Firstly, increasing the proponent's level of ownership seems obvious, but direct change is probably difficult. However, where international finance institutes are involved they can increase ownership. Despite the limited influence of the EIA authority, a proactive strategy of, for example, working together with international finance institutes has a slightly larger influence than a reactive strategy. </p...|$|E

This study evaluates {{the effects of}} a tailored Incredible Years Teacher Classroom Management (IYTCM) programme aimed to improve participating children’s on-task behaviour and literacy performance, as well as reducing ADHD symptoms in a group of 6 to 10 year old children with ADHD in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Nine children, who were identified with ADHD symptoms on the basis of teacher and parental reports, were involved in the IYTCM-ADHD programme. The children’s behaviour symptoms were assessed using the Conners 3 -T, Conners 3 -P(S), SESBI-I, ECBI and SDQ. Ten teachers received the IYTCM-ADHD training in a full-day session once a week for 6 weeks. The children received individual behaviour plans implemented by their teachers with close supervision. A single-subject design was implemented to record the behaviour changes over time: at baseline, during teacher training with the IYTCM-ADHD programme, and at both immediate and long-term follow-ups. The on-task behaviour of children with ADHD and normative comparison children was recorded using Behavioural Observation of Students in Schools (BOSS). In addition to visual analysis, a non-parametric test Percentage of All Non-Overlapping Data (PAND) was used to examine the magnitude of effect in each child. The result of the study indicated that on-task behaviour of all the children with ADHD improved an average of 78 % during the teacher training and this maintained during the <b>follow-up</b> <b>phases.</b> The children’s on-task behaviour also generalised to classrooms with non-trained teachers.
