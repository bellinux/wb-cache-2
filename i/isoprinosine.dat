5000|$|Treatment {{of chronic}} fatigue {{syndrome}} (CFS) is variable and uncertain, and the condition is primarily managed rather than cured. [...] Only two treatments, cognitive behavioral therapy and graded exercise therapy, have demonstrated reproducible evidence for their efficacy people with CFS who are walking. There are no Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved medications for ME/CFS treatment, although medications are used without approval for the illness (off-label). Drugs {{have been used in}} experimental studies of the illness that haven't been approved for market for any condition in the United States (for example, <b>isoprinosine</b> and rintatolimod). Other proposed treatments include medical treatments and alternative medicine. Even when treated, the prognosis of CFS is often poor. [...] In one study, poor early management was reported to be a main risk factor for severe CFS (delayed diagnosis, poor response to analgesics, physiotherapy, or alternative medicine), with associated variables including a poor relationship with the GP before and after diagnosis, and the involvement of a psychiatrist in initial treatment.|$|E
40|$|The {{need for}} agents {{designed}} to modify immune {{response in the}} treatment of patients with viral infection, immunodeficiency, or cancer prompted the present study on the mechanisms of action of <b>isoprinosine,</b> a compound developed for antiviral use and whose therapeutic activity may involve the immune system. The effect of <b>isoprinosine</b> on in vitro proliferation of human peripheral blood lymphocytes stimulated by phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and on lymphocyte levels of cyclic adenosine 3 ', 5 '-monophosphate and cyclic guanosine 3 ', 5 '-monophosphate was analyzed. Over a concentration range from 0. 2 to 250 mug/ml, <b>isoprinosine</b> augmented PHA-induced proliferation; maximal stimulation was observed between 25 to 50 mug/ml. <b>Isoprinosine</b> in the absence of PHA had no effect on proliferation. The relative lack of effect of <b>isoprinosine</b> during a 90 -min exposure and the lack of effect on lymphocyte cyclic nucleotide levels indicate that <b>isoprinosine</b> potentiates the PHA response by a mechanism different than a number of hormonal agents and such immunopotentiators as levamisole, polyadenylic-acid, and endotoxin. Further evaluation of <b>isoprinosine</b> as an immunopotentiator is indicated...|$|E
40|$|Anti-herpesvirus {{effects of}} <b>Isoprinosine</b> {{were found to}} be condition-dependent in vitro and in vivo. A herpes type 1 strain, grown in primary rabbit kidney cells, was not {{susceptible}} to <b>Isoprinosine</b> when cytopathic effect was evaluated, but was modestly inhibited when plaque-forming methocel overlay was used in the same cell line. However, the growth of a herpes type 2 strain was inhibited by <b>Isoprinosine</b> in this system when cytopathic effect was evaluated. Both viruses produced an encephalitis in hamsters after application by corneal abrasion. The encephalitis produced by a 1. 5 mean lethal dose of herpesvirus was strikingly suppressed by large doses of <b>Isoprinosine</b> given ad libitum in the drinking water; this protection was not seen, however, at 15 mean lethal doses. Anti-herpes effects of <b>Isoprinosine</b> were suppressed by additional treatment with cortisone, both in tissue culture and in vivo. <b>Isoprinosine,</b> in the absence of virus infection, produced significant effects on the metabolism, structure, and function of brain ribosomes. In vivo, RNA components were labeled more rapidly and gave up their radioactivity more slowly after treatment with <b>Isoprinosine.</b> This enhanced cytoplasmic radioactivity was associated with a loss of incorporated radioactivity located in the nucleus and an increase in radioactivity located in a ribonucleo-protein fraction > 4 S and < 18 S. Ribosomes from treated brains gave physical evidence of being more compact (less orthochromic). <b>Isoprinosine</b> treatment increased the incorporation of [14 C]phenylalanine into nascent protein in a cell-free system examining protein synthesis in brain polyribosomes. The addition of the exogenous messenger ribonucleic acid, polyuridylic acid, produced a significant age-dependent inhibition in the incorporation of [14 C] phenylalanine. This inhibition was significantly greater when ribosomes were isolated from animals pretreated with <b>Isoprinosine.</b> These and other observations suggest that the <b>Isoprinosine</b> stimulation of host ribonucleic acid metabolism may be coupled to the production of ribosomes that do not effectively translate exogenous messenger ribonucleic acid...|$|E
40|$|Summary: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the use of the biologic immune activation markers neopterin and ß 2 -microglobulin in monitoring human immunodeficiency virus (HlV) -positive patients without acquired immu-nodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) treated with <b>isoprinosine</b> and placebo. Serum samples obtained at the commence-ment of study and samples obtained after 24 weeks were available from 277 HIV-positive patients in the Scandina-vian multicentre <b>isoprinosine</b> trial. After 24 weeks ' treatment, the concentrations of ß 2 -microglobulin and neopterin had increased both in the <b>isoprinosine</b> group and the placebo group. However, in the <b>isoprinosine</b> group the relative increase within ß 2 -microglobulin was significantly smaller. Within neopterin, the increase from baseline level was small and not significantly different from the change in the placebo group. The ß 2 -microglobulin data might reflect a suppressive effect of <b>isoprinosine</b> on the HIV-induced activation of the cellular immune system. Because of the minor changes, there is no real evidence of neopterin and ß 2 -microglobulin being valuable as surrogate markers in monitoring therapy effects of <b>isoprinosine...</b>|$|E

40|$|Objective Sub acute Sclerosing Pan Encephalitis (SSPE), a {{progressive}} neurological disorder characterized by {{inflammation of the}} brain (encephalitis), {{is the result of}} an inappropriate immune response to the measles virus or measles vaccination. SSPE usually develops 2 to 10 years after the original viral attack. Some of the major signs and symptoms are mental deterioration, jerky movements, and seizures specially myoclonic type, involuntary movements, and/or behavioral changes, difficulty in walking, speech, and loss of cognition, respiratory distress and death. Materials and Methods During the ten years, from July 1991 to July 2001, we admitted 45 cases of (SSPE), at different stages of the disorder. Regardless of their stage of disease, for intervention, randomly, we used one of three drugs; Amantadin, Interferon alfa and <b>Isoprinosine,</b> administered to the patients, for between one month to one year. Fourteen cases received Amantadin, 15 Alfa interferon, and 16 were given <b>Isoprinosine.</b> Results While the results show all three drugs to be relatively effective, <b>Isoprinosine</b> showed four times more effectiveness than Amantadin and twice as much as Interferon.

40|$|The {{effects of}} an immunopotentiating drug Inosine Pranobex (<b>isoprinosine)</b> were {{investigated}} in an experimental cutaneous leishmaniasis model. The highly susceptible BALB/c mice treated orally with <b>isoprinosine</b> developed significantly delayed onset of disease when infected with Leishmania major compared to untreated mice. The drug itself is not toxic to the parasite up to millimolar levels in vitro. The increase in resistance to L. major infection {{is accompanied by a}} marked decrease in the CD 4 +/CD 8 + ratio and the leishmanial antigen-specific proliferative response of the spleen cells of isoprinosine-treated mice compared to untreated mice. There was {{a significant increase in the}} production of IFN-gamma but a decrease in the secretion of IL- 3 and IL- 4 by the spleen cells of isoprinosine-treated mice in response to concanavalin A with or without L. major infection compared to untreated controls. There was, however, no significant difference in the level of IL- 2 production by the spleen cells between mice with or without <b>isoprinosine</b> treatment. These data are consistent with the interpretation that <b>isoprinosine</b> potentiates the resistance to leishmanial infection by up-regulating the host-protective Th 1 cells and down-regulating the disease-promoting Th 2 cells or, alternatively, by increasing CD 8 + T-cell function...|$|E
40|$|Since {{clinical}} trials are being planned with the immunomodulating drug <b>isoprinosine</b> {{combined with the}} antiviral drug 3 '-azido- 3 '-deoxythymidine (AZT) in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and AIDS-related complex, {{it is important to}} determine the type of antiviral interaction produced by these drugs in vitro. Such a combined modality may not only produce enhanced antiviral effects but also may have a valuable immunorestorative action. The interaction of several ratios of AZT and <b>isoprinosine</b> on the replication of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells was determined by reverse transcriptase assay of disrupted virus obtained from supernatants of cells that were exposed to virus and the drugs separately and in combination and by a human immunodeficiency virus type 1 p 24 enzyme immunoassay of the same supernatants. The correlation between the reverse transcriptase and enzyme immunoassay data was high. The antiviral activity of AZT alone was neither diminished nor augmented when AZT was used in combination with <b>isoprinosine.</b> <b>Isoprinosine</b> did not enhance virus yield when used alone or in combination with AZT in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, nor did it affect the growth of uninfected cells. The in vitro results indicate that this combination did not decrease the efficacy of AZT or exacerbate virus replication...|$|E
40|$|NZB/NZW F 1 hybrid mice {{treated for}} long periods with type beta {{interferon}} developed early symptoms of autoimmune disease. In these animals the level of anti-dsDNA antibody begins to increase at 4 - 6 months while untreated NZB/NZW mice do not display similar levels until 12 months. The concomitant administration of <b>isoprinosine</b> and interferon delays the early appearance of autoimmune disorders. In interferon-treated NZB/NZW mice the cytotoxic activity of natural killer lymphocytes is maintained at high levels {{until the age of}} 5 months. Nevertheless, the natural killer activity is even stronger and detected until at least 7 months in NZB/NZW mice receiving a single dose of interferon 16 hr prior to the test. Lymphoblastoid ascitic tumours appeared early (2 - 3 months) during interferon treatment in all groups of NZB/NZW mice.

40|$|<b>Isoprinosine</b> {{has been}} {{reported}} to decrease progression to AIDS, primarily by preventing Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP), in human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients, but the mechanism of action is unknown. para-Acetamidobenzoic acid (PAcBA), one component of <b>isoprinosine,</b> is structurally related to para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), a precursor of de novo folate synthesis. This pathway is known to be important for P. carinii because sulfonamides, which are effective anti-P. carinii agents, inhibit incorporation of PABA into folate precursors by the enzyme dihydropteroate synthetase (DHPS). Inhibition of P. carinii DHPS by PAcBA was investigated by using two assays. In short-term cultures of P. carinii from rats, [3 H]PABA incorporation into reduced folates was inhibited by both <b>isoprinosine</b> (mean +/- standard error 50 % inhibitory concentration [IC 50], 20 +/- 8. 4 microM) and PAcBA free acid (IC 50, 240 +/- 100 microM); a soluble PAcBA salt was more potent than PAcBA free acid alone (IC 50, 29 +/- 48 microM). The activity of PAcBA free acid was confirmed in a cell-free DHPS inhibition assay (IC 50, 120 +/- 120 microM). Inosine and dimethylaminopropanol, two other components of <b>isoprinosine,</b> were poor inhibitors of PABA incorporation (IC 50, > 1, 000 microM). PAcBA free acid also showed activity in inhibiting the DHPS of Toxoplasma gondii, but was a poor inhibitor of the DHPSs of Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In a rat model of PCP, the PAcBA salt administered intraperitoneally demonstrated no activity against established PCP either alone or when used in combination with trimethoprim; the lack of efficacy in this model {{may be due to the}} rapid metabolism of the drug. Prevention of PCP by PaCBA through inhibition of P. carinii DHPS may explain the activity of <b>isoprinosine</b> in decreasing the progression to AIDS in human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients...|$|E

The mechanism of action and the therapeutic effects of azathioprine, glucocorticosteroids, cyclophosphamide, cyclosporin A, and anticancer drugs will be discussed. The im-munotoxic actions of benzene, polychlorinated and polybrominated biphenyls, tetrachlorodibenzo-para-dioxin, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, various insecticides, metals and abused drugs or drugs with side effects are also described. Immunorestorative approaches are discussed in the second part, based on our current knowledge of the immune system and the lymphokines and hormones involved in its function. The usefulness of thymic hormones, interleukin 2, macrophage growth factorkolony stimulating factor, and interferons as immunotherapeutic agents is considered. In addition, we address chemically defined drugs, such as levamisole, diethyldithiocarbamate, <b>isoprinosine,</b> muramyl dipeptides, azimexon, ciamexon, bestatin, tuftsin, and pyrimidinoles, and finally conclude that combined use of different immunostimulants may be {{the most effective way to}} treat the above mentioned immunodeficiencies.

40|$|The {{in vitro}} effects of <b>isoprinosine</b> (ISO) on interleukin- 2 (IL- 2) production, the {{expression}} of Tac antigen (IL- 2 receptor) on lymphocytes, {{and the ability of}} Leu 3 (+) cells to absorb interleukin- 1 (IL- 1) were investigated in 10 patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). In 9 of the 10 patients, production of IL- 2 from mononuclear cells and Leu 3 (+) cells was depressed; expression of Tac antigen on mononuclear cells and Leu 2 (+) cells was found to be depressed in 9 of 10 patients. The ability of the Leu 3 (+) lymphocytes to absorb IL- 1 was depressed in all (four of four) patients studied. After ISO treatment, IL- 2 production, Tac antigen expression and IL- 1 absorption were restored to normal or near normal levels in most of the patients. These results suggest that ISO has an immunostimulating capacity in AIDS patients and that the potential of ISO in immune response restoration in AIDS patients deserves critical consideration...|$|E
