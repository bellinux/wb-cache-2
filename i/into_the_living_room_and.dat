500|$|On May 11, around 1 a.m., Clemmons {{appeared}} {{naked in}} his living room and ordered two female relatives, ages 11 and 12, to fondle him. The two reportedly complied out of fear, and the 11-year-old fled the house afterward. Clemmons took the 12-year-old into his bedroom along with Clemmons' wife. Clemmons repeatedly referred to himself as Jesus, and said his wife was Eve. He released the 12-year-old girl after his wife begged him to let her go. However, around 4 a.m. that same morning, he gathered his family back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> demanded they strip naked together. He later left the house, claiming the world {{was coming to an end}} and that he was [...] "going to fly to heaven". A family member called 911 and police found Clemmons at a nearby second house he was building, but Clemmons fled on foot and escaped. He failed to appear the next day for an arraignment on his May 9 charges. Child Protective Services investigated and substantiated the sexual abuse complaint. Latanya Clemmons, Clemmons's sister, told authorities he had undergone a change and was [...] "not in his right mind".|$|E
2500|$|Like {{many houses}} {{designed}} by Wright, {{it proved to}} be better as an aesthetic work than as a livable dwelling. [...] Water tended to flow over the central lawn and <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room,</b> <b>and</b> the flat roof terraces were conceived without an understanding of Los Angeles' rains. [...] The cantilevered concrete also has not stood up well to the area's earthquakes.|$|E
2500|$|... "My father... {{took us to}} see one of {{the first}} talking pictures, The Singing Fool, in which Al Jolson sang [...] "Sonny Boy". In a way, you could say that Jolson was my {{earliest}} influence as a singer. I was so excited by what I saw that I spent hours listening to Jolson and Eddie Cantor on the radio. In fact, I staged my first public performance shortly after seeing that movie... to imitate Jolson... I leaped <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> announced to the adults, who were staring at me in amazement, 'Me Sonny Boy!' The whole family roared with laughter." ...|$|E

2500|$|Lennon, being {{mindful of}} Elvis Presley's [...] "All Shook Up", wanted {{something}} equally as stirring: [...] "I don't {{know where the}} 'yeah yeah yeah' came from [...] I remember when Elvis did 'All Shook Up' {{it was the first}} time in my life that I had heard 'uh huh', 'oh yeah', and 'yeah yeah' all sung in the same song". The song also included a number of falsetto [...] "wooooo"'s, which Lennon acknowledged as being inspired by the Isley Brothers' recording of [...] "Twist and Shout", which the Beatles had earlier recorded, and which had also been inserted into the group's previous single, [...] "From Me to You". As Lennon later said: [...] "We stuck it in everything". McCartney recalls them playing the finished song on acoustic guitars to his father Jim at home immediately after the song was completed: [...] "We went <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> said 'Dad, listen to this. What do you think? And he said 'That's very nice son, but there's enough of these Americanisms around. Couldn't you sing 'She loves you, yes, yes, yes!'. At which point we collapsed in a heap and said 'No, Dad, you don't quite get it!'". EMI recording engineer Norman Smith had a somewhat similar reaction, later recounting, [...] "I was setting up the microphone when I first saw the lyrics on the music stand, 'She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah, She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah, She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah, Yeah!' I thought, Oh my God, what a lyric! This is going to be one that I do not like. But when they started to sing it—bang, wow, terrific, I was up at the mixer jogging around." ...|$|E
2500|$|She {{rang the}} wall-crank phone two times before being shot {{twice in the}} face from the same window. One bullet entered her right cheek and exited behind her left ear. The other went in her lower jaw just below the lip, {{breaking}} it and splintering out several teeth before lodging under her tongue. She dropped to her knees but soon managed to get on her feet. She ran to get a pistol from the living room, but she was blinded by her own blood. She heard the killer tearing loose the rusted screen wire on the back porch. She {{thought she was going}} to be killed, so she stumbled toward her bedroom near the front of the house to leave a note. Meanwhile, the killer ran to the back of the house and made his way up the steps and into the side-screened porch through the back screen door. She heard the killer coming through the kitchen window, so she turned around and ran through the dining room, through the bedroom, down a hallway, through another bedroom, and then <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> out the front door, leaving behind a [...] "virtual river of blood" [...] and teeth throughout the house and across the street. Barefooted and still in her blood-soaked nightgown, she ran across the street to her sister and brother-in-law's house. Since no one was home, she ran 50yards more to A. V. Prater's house. Prater answered her call for help. She gasped, [...] "Virgil's dead", then collapsed. Prater shot a rifle in the air to summon another neighbor, Elmer Taylor. Prater called to Taylor to bring his car because Mr. and Mrs. Starks had been shot. Taylor, along with Mr. and Mrs. Prater and their baby, rode with Mrs. Starks to Michael Meagher Hospital (now Miller County Health Unit) at 503 Walnut Street. Mrs. Starks gave Mr. Taylor, the driver, one of her teeth with a gold filling. She was in a semi-conscious state, slumping forward on the front seat. Although she lost a considerable amount of blood, she showed no signs of going into shock and her heart rate remained normal. Miller County Sheriff W. E. Davis, who became head of the investigation, questioned Mrs. Starks in the operating room at Michael Meagher Hospital. The news was printed on the front page the next morning, on Saturday May 4, reading [...] "MURDER ROCKS CITY AGAIN; FARMER SLAIN, WIFE WOUNDED". Four days later, Sheriff Davis talked with Mrs. Starks again at the hospital. Mrs. Starks discounted a rumor that was circulating about Virgil hearing a car outside his home several nights in a row, fearing of being killed.|$|E

6000|$|The Weldons {{and their}} guests were greeted at their door by a maid, for {{there were no}} men among the house servants, and as Louise ushered <b>the</b> party <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> {{she said to the}} girl: ...|$|R
60|$|They walked <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room,</b> <b>and</b> Lew Flapp made an {{inspection}} of the pantry and then of Captain Starr's private apartment.

6000|$|He {{sat down}} on the bed, {{thrusting}} his feet among the scattered roses with a sort of grim satisfaction. [...] "I never dreamt," [...] he repeated, and the flimsy basket kicked by his swinging foot hopped indignantly through the folding doors <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> left a trail of blood-red petals.|$|E
6000|$|He {{stood up}} resolutely. He kicked the {{scattered}} roses {{out of his}} way and dived beneath the bed for his portmanteau. Ethel neither spoke nor moved, but remained watching his movements. For a time the portmanteau refused to emerge, and he marred his stern resolution by a half audible [...] "Come here--damn you!" [...] He swung it <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> returned for his box. He proposed to pack in that room.|$|E
50|$|The main {{entrance}} is a wooden paneled {{door with a}} brass knocker. The arched vestibule it opens <b>into</b> has <b>the</b> original floor tiles. Another transomed doorway opens <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room,</b> with a fireplace on the north wall.|$|R

5000|$|... "The Boys Are Back in Town", is a {{song that}} Loveless links her album to the {{traditional}} community dance, held in someone's home after the furniture and carpet had been picked up. In effect, the listener is invited <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room.</b>|$|R
60|$|His {{call and}} the noise from outside aroused Gif and Spouter, as well as Fred, and soon the four cadets were hurrying <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room.</b> They wore nothing but their pajamas, and slippers, but now each slipped hastily into his overcoat.|$|R
60|$|No such {{invitation}} was needed, for {{as soon as}} {{the door}} was opened wide enough Bill Glutts staggered <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room,</b> followed by his crony. A swirl of snow followed them, and continued until Gif and Jack managed to close the door once more.|$|R
50|$|One of the {{advantages}} of the closet-bed was that it could be built <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> closed off during the day, making a separate bedroom unnecessary. The other main advantage was that, during the winter, the small area of the closet-bed would be warmed by body heat. This meant the stove would not need to be kept stoked at night. The door would not be shut completely, but left open a bit.|$|E
50|$|He {{then begins}} {{to paint the}} whole living room white, but finds that the {{bristles}} on his paintbrush are dried solid. He uses a hammer to attempt soften them, but when he goes <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> dips the brush into the paint, the bristles disappear into the paint, annoying Bean. In a cruel improvisation, he shoves the brush handle into Teddy's rear and uses his head to paint the walls. However, he manages to only get a few lines of paint done before accidentally dripping paint onto things.|$|E
5000|$|According to Alan Lloyd Smith, {{a concept}} of {{domestic}} abjection is one that [...] "disturbs identity, order, and system". This {{is exactly what the}} new radio does in the Westcott household. When Mrs. Westcott sees the new radio in the large gumwood cabinet, she does not like its enormousness. The Gumwood cabinet is [...] "dark" [...] and does not fit in with the living room furnishings and colors that Irene had personally chosen. This cabinet is dark and ugly, bringing darkness <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> their lives. Eventually, Irene identifies herself with the object.|$|E
