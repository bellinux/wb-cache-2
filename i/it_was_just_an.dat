25|$|The {{peak of the}} X Club's {{influence}} was from 1873 to 1885 as Hooker, Spottiswoode and Huxley were Presidents of the Royal Society in succession. Spencer resigned in 1889 after a dispute with Huxley over state support for science. After 1892 <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>an</b> excuse for the surviving members to meet. Hooker died in 1911, and Lubbock (now Lord Avebury) was the last surviving member.|$|E

However, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>an</b> extension of London–Karachi flight of the Imperial Airways. In 1915, the first Indian airline, Tata Sons Ltd, started a regular airmail service between Karachi and Madras without any patronage from the government, marking the beginning of air transportation in the southern part of India.|$|E

500|$|The biggest {{trouble that}} we've had {{basically}} {{is that the}} song, [...] "Hold me Now" [...] was a huge hit, it was really big here, it was really big all over the world. Which is great, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>an</b> accidental thing. It was just a song that we wrote. But after that then, we got everybody—managers, the record company—on our back to write [...] "Hold me Now, Part 2" [...] and harassing you {{to try and find}} a formula. But we can't really. We'll never find a formula for what we did. And that upsets some of them.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the end of}} {{the second}} season, Taylor decided to remove the Kazon as the series' primary antagonists, having found the effort to develop the alien species to be unsuccessful. She felt that they never grew into a {{compelling}} adversary, despite their appearances in multiple episodes. Taylor argued that the Kazon limited the potential of the series, saying: [...] "It created the curious implication that we are standing still in space, when our franchise is that we are going at incredible speeds toward the Alpha Quadrant – we keep running into the same people over and over again! <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>an</b> oddity, and I don't think the Kazon have served us well." [...] While discussing their role in the future episodes, she explained that it was her [...] "intention to leave them behind and to find new and I hope more interesting aliens".|$|E
500|$|Various {{episodes of}} the show have {{generated}} controversy. The Simpsons visit Australia in [...] "Bart vs. Australia" [...] (season six, 1995) and Brazil in [...] "Blame It on Lisa" [...] (season 13, 2002) and both episodes generated controversy and negative reaction in the visited countries. In the latter case, Rio de Janeiro's tourist board—which claimed {{that the city was}} portrayed as having rampant street crime, kidnappings, slums, and monkey and rat infestations—went so far as to threaten Fox with legal action. Groening was a fierce and vocal critic of the episode [...] "A Star Is Burns" [...] (season six, 1995) which featured a crossover with The Critic. He felt that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>an</b> advertisement for The Critic, and that people would incorrectly associate the show with him. When he was unsuccessful in getting the episode pulled, he had his name removed from the credits and went public with his concerns, openly criticizing James L. Brooks and saying the episode [...] "violates the Simpsons' universe." [...] In response, Brooks said, [...] "I am furious with Matt,... he's allowed his opinion, but airing this publicly in the press is going too far.... his behavior right now is rotten." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{subjects}} {{focused on}} in the album's lyrics include Vanilla Ice's abusive childhood and drug addiction. He stated that [...] "I wrote 'Fuck Me' 'cause I know how I've been perceived. [...] "I can {{look back at the}} whole Vanilla Ice thing, and it was played way out. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>an</b> image thing. I was always real to the music. But it built a huge hurdle for me to get over musically. A lot of people didn't even want to admit they bought a Vanilla Ice record." [...] "Too Cold" [...] is a rap rock remake of Vanilla Ice's biggest hit, [...] "Ice Ice Baby". Vanilla Ice stated that he remade the song because [...] "I wanted to let people know that I'm not running from anything. This is me. This is what I'm about. I think the music speaks for itself. If the music was whack, nobody'd even care to hear anything about no Vanilla Ice. I just think the music is so strong people are kinda comin' out of the closet. It's like, 'You know, hey, I bought it back in the day, and the new stuff is slammin'.' I think there's some hip-hop influenced, stage-diving, body piercing, tattooed white boys out there who are embracing this new sound." [...] "Too Cold" [...] was originally intended to be released as a hidden track or B-side.|$|E
500|$|The cast of FOX musical series Glee {{performed}} {{this song}} on the episode [...] "Blame It on the Alcohol", with Heather Morris' character, Brittany Pierce, taking the lead. The episode revolved around teen drinking and its dangers. The members of Glee Club are asked to perform at the school's alcohol awareness assembly, in which [...] "Tik Tok" [...] {{is one of the}} songs performed. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club wrote that the song's inclusion in the episode was superfluous, stating that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>an</b> excuse to get a Kesha song on Glee. VanDerWerff however, wrote that he [...] "REALLY liked Heather Morris'" [...] rendition of the song. Sandra Gonzalez of Entertainment Weekly praised Brittany's choreography and overall performance in [...] "Tik Tok", writing, [...] "The huge star of this number was clearly Brittany, who more and more every week proves that she needs to be moved to the forefront of this show's big performances and storylines." [...] Gonzalez gave the cover version of [...] "Tik Tok" [...] a B, calling it [...] "pure, fun entertainment up until we got to the part straight out of the mind of Gordie LaChance. So even though the purple vomit was a bit too much for this weak viewer, the performance made me add a Ke$ha song to my iTunes, which I never thought would happen." [...] Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone gave the cover version of [...] "Tik Tok" [...] a mostly positive review, writing, [...] "Love Brittany as we do, we wish Rachel or Mercedes stepped up to the mic. The performance is less risqué than their Pep Rally [...] "Push It" [...] but winds up causing more controversy when Brittany pukes on Rachel and Santana also vomits up grey slush. It's a fitting end to the song, and the episode." ...|$|E

2500|$|One of the marvellous {{things about}} John Bonham which made things very easy [...] {{was the fact}} that he really knew how to tune his drums, and I tell you what, that was pretty rare in drummers in those days.

2500|$|David uses {{inscriptions}} {{to reinforce}} the symbolism in eight of his known works: [...] Bélisaire asking for Alms, Andromache Mourning Hector, The Death of Marat, The Furrier of Saint-Fargeau (lost), Napoleon Crossing the Alps, Sappho and Phaon, Napoleon in his Study, and Leonidas at Thermopylae. In The Death of Marat, the dying revolutionary holds a page {{with the name of}} his assassin, Charlotte Corday. Léonidas in Thermopyles shows a Spartan engraving details of their sacrifice on a wall. In this picture, the rocks bear the names of Hannibal and Charlemagne alongside Bonaparte, linking them by their crossing of the Alps, and portraying Napoleon as their successor. The inclusion of Charlemagne and the [...] "IMP" [...] (signifying Imperator, i.e. Emperor) raises doubts as to the level of Bonaparte's involvement with the addition of the inscriptions. Was it coincidence or a hint of his ambitions? There is however, the possibility that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>an</b> indication of Charlemagne's status as emperor of the Holy Roman Empire.|$|E

This is what I love.'" [...] She said, [...] "To have all that material and to be there in the moment ... I didn't want to be in any other place." [...] She found it exciting. Having waited for the moment [...] "for a long time," [...] {{it turned out to be}} [...] "a big pay-off." [...] She added: But I was a little nervous because this was definitely a very, very special episode. That was the biggest challenge to me; I was going in there knowing, 'This is the moment.' I kept having to make myself laugh and leave set and play with my friends in the hair and makeup room and just sort of try to view the day as though <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>an</b> average taping day because the last thing those scenes needed from my character's perspective was that sense of gravity, that feeling of, 'This is so important.' Because it was not a big deal for my character — she had no idea what was coming.|$|E

2500|$|The {{opening track}} on the album, Clark's [...] "Full Circle", had {{initially}} given the album its working title, but Clark {{was concerned that}} the public might mistakenly assume that the song had been written specifically for The Byrds' reunion. [...] The song's wheel of fortune motif certainly seemed applicable but the song actually predated the reunion, as Clark explained during a 1979 [...] interview: [...] "I'd already recorded that song {{a couple of years}} earlier and it wasn't really written about anything specific. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>an</b> idea I had." [...] Not only had the song been written by Clark prior to The Byrds' reunion, but by the time that Byrds was released, it had also recently been issued under the alternate title of [...] "Full Circle Song" [...] on Clark's Roadmaster album. [...] The Byrds' reunion album also included a second Clark original, [...] "Changing Heart", which served as a meditation on the pitfalls of stardom. [...] Clark was also featured singing lead vocals on the album's pair of Neil Young covers. [...] The decision to cover Young's [...] "Cowgirl in the Sand" [...] and [...] "(See the Sky) About to Rain" [...] was made by Clark, who had long admired the Canadian singer–songwriter, and not by Young's CSNY bandmate David Crosby, as was assumed by the press at the time. [...] "Cowgirl in the Sand" [...] made striking use of the band's crystal clear harmonies, while Clark's harmonica playing lent the song a distinctive country flavor, perfectly in keeping with the song's subject matter. [...] "(See the Sky) About to Rain", on the other hand, featured some attractive mandolin playing from the band's bassist Chris Hillman and climaxed with a chiming finalé, featuring The Byrds' signature jangling Rickenbacker guitars.|$|E
2500|$|Taylor had {{thoughts}} of retiring {{by the time}} he played the Rock in Rio festival in Rio de Janeiro in January 1985. He was encouraged by the nascent democracy in Brazil at the time, buoyed by the positive reception he got from the large crowd and other musicians, and musically energized by the sounds and nature of Brazilian music. [...] "I had... sort of bottomed-out in a drug habit, my marriage with Carly had dissolved, and I had basically been depressed and lost for a while," [...] he recalled in 1995. [...] "I sort of hit a low spot. I was asked to go down to Rio de Janeiro to play in this festival down there. We put the band together and went down and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>an</b> amazing response. I played to 300,000 people. They not only knew my music, they knew things about it and were interested in aspects of it that to that point had only interested me. To have that kind of validation right about then was really what I needed. It helped get me back on track." [...] The song [...] "Only a Dream in Rio" [...] was written in tribute to that night, with lines like I was there that very day and my heart came back alive. The October 1985 album, That's Why I'm Here, from which that song came, started a series of studio recordings that, while spaced further apart than his previous records, showed a more consistent level of quality and fewer covers, most notably the Buddy Holly song [...] "Everyday", released as a single reached No. 61. On the album track [...] "Only You," [...] the backing vocals were performed by an all star duo of Joni Mitchell and Don Henley.|$|E
2500|$|In {{her book}} Soap Stars, Debbie Foy refers to Tony as having lived through several {{dramatic}} episodes. Foy {{went on to}} describe Tony as being famous for his [...] "many on-screen relationships, affairs and engagements" [...] but always has plenty of heartache. The Daily Star described Tony as going [...] "through more women than he’s served hot meals in his restaurant Gnosh" [...] before adding {{that he is a}} [...] "loser-in-love". They commented that after dumping Cindy [...] "this time he’s only got himself to blame". On the character Sky said: [...] "Tony Hutchinson is our fave character on the show. Probably because he's been on it the whole time since it started in 1995". An Inside Soap critic responded negatively to a plot centring on Tony catering for the college ball saying [...] "Just who do the Hollyoaks writers think they are catering for with a plot like this? Do us a favour and serve up something decent!" [...] The Liverpool Echos Caroline Corcoran reviewed Hollyoaks: Movin' On saying the spinoff provided [...] "an insight in to Tony's character that we don't get in Hollyoaks, and I actually found myself feeling for a character that is normally written to be deliberately irritating". Another critic for Inside Soap felt Hollyoaks was back to a high standard before adding that [...] "Tony Hutchinson has been on fine comedy form following the disastrous transformation of his garden by 'Charlie Dimmock'". Inside Soaps Lucy said that [...] "You've got to feel sorry for Hollyoaks's Tony Hutchinson ... Give the man a break!" [...] Following Tony's relationship with Mandy becoming troubled. Lucy's colleague Sam also reviewed the storyline saying: [...] "Feel sorry for Tony? Oh get over it! He deserves everything he's got coming to him. What is Mandy doing with him anyway? He's far too old, a total fuddy duddy, and has had the same naff hairstyle for seven years!" [...] While reflecting on [...] "some of soap's more memorable business ideas", an Inside Soap writer, on Tony's business ideas, said: [...] "Tony Hutchinson, {{is not so much the}} king of money-making schemes - more of an old skin-flint ... he came up with the idea of recycling all his guest's used water ... When his recycling racket was discovered, his claims that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>an</b> innovative method of being environmentally friendly wouldn't wash - we all knew it was just his cheap-skate way of reducing his water bill! However, to this day his roses continue to bloom strangely well". Inside Soap critic Sam expressed disinterest in a storyline in which Tony and Ruth kiss, questioning if they have [...] "gone back in time or something?" [...] Merle Brown of the Daily Record bemoaned the lack of realism in Tony's storylines saying: [...] "why on earth would Izzy go out with Tony? Yes, she's slightly irritating, but in the real world would a man like Tony honestly have a constant stream of girlfriends?" [...] Jaci Stephen of the Daily Mail felt that [...] "Asking Tony for guidance is the equivalent of asking the obese for dieting tips, such a fat lot of good he is". Stephens later said Tony has [...] "enjoyed the company of as many women as Hugh Hefner". During the Enjoy The Ride storyline, Inside Soaps Sarah said [...] "there are standout performances from some of my all-time favourite Hollyoaks stars" [...] which she said included Pickard.|$|E
