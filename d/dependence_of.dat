40|$|Bachelor {{thesis is}} focused on theory and methods of {{adhesive}} bonding. Experimental part {{is focused on}} two topics: determining <b>dependences</b> <b>of</b> bonded joint shear tension on a cure time and determining <b>dependences</b> <b>of</b> bonded joint shear tension on a size of contact area. Loctite SI 5399 RD acetoxy silicone one component glue was used for these experiments. At determining <b>dependences</b> <b>of</b> bonded joint shear tension on a size of contact area tension is raising, but the grow wasn’t directly proportional on the grow of size of contact area. Determining <b>dependences</b> <b>of</b> bonded join shear tension on a cure time it was proved, that tension is raising first 24 hours very quickly. After this period is process slowing down and tension is increasing to its maximum. After 18 hours bond tension is solid enough to be handling, but 24 hours of curing time is more secured...|$|R

The PL {{intensity of the}} E 2 band is much weaker than that with the SiO 2 barrier, which was previously reported[22]. Therefore, we consider that this E 2 band originates from oxygen-related surface or interface states of the Si NDs, {{and we would like}} to discuss mainly about the E 1 emission. In the low-temperature regime below 150 K, the PL intensity is almost constant. The intensity increases toward 200 K and peaks at a maximum around 250 K. The PL intensity then decreases monotonically with further increasing temperature. Quantitative discussion about these temperature <b>dependences</b> <b>of</b> the PL intensity will be made later.|$|R
