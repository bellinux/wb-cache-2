50|$|Beagles {{are one of}} {{the main}} enemies in the game. Beagles can jump around onto ledges and fences, some are {{assigned}} to one place and <b>just</b> <b>jump</b> <b>in</b> two spots. Other dogs can bark at the player releasing an icon that must be avoided. It is noted that the barks move with the screen. If coming from the back, they are very dangerous.|$|E

If we are lucky we find an image we can hold on to, {{but most of the time}} we are puzzled and lost in the process. If we are lucky we understand the project when it is built, but sometimes we still cannot grasp its meaning. We can communicate with clients and contractors (of course) but we do that in the language which everybody understands.|$|R
5000|$|It {{reminded}} me of a rodeo song with Olivia Newton-John singing. I love Olivia Newton-John, but for Whitney Houston it didnt seem right. I felt the song needed a much more funkier feel. I slept, dreaming about it, {{woke up in the morning}} thinking about it, wondering what am I gonna do with this dance song. So, we <b>just</b> <b>jumped</b> <b>in</b> the water and lo and behold a magic record was born, Houston just knocked it out and then I knew we had a good record.|$|R
50|$|A Bigger Splash {{is a large}} pop art {{painting}} by British artist David Hockney. Measuring 242.5 cm by 243.9 cm, it depicts a swimming pool beside a modern house, disturbed by a large splash of water created by an unseen figure who has apparently <b>just</b> <b>jumped</b> <b>in</b> from a diving board. It was painted in California between April and June 1967, when Hockney was teaching at the University of California, Berkeley. Jack Hazan's fictionalised 1974 biopic, A Bigger Splash, concentrating on the breakup of Hockney's relationship with Peter Schlesinger, was named after the painting.|$|R
5000|$|During his Senate {{re-election}} race in October 2014, while discussing {{immigration and}} foreign policy issues with a reporter from The Weekly Standard, Graham said : “If I get through my general election, if nobody steps up in the presidential mix, if nobody’s out there talking [...] [...] [...] I may <b>just</b> <b>jump</b> <b>in</b> to get to make these arguments.” [...] And on March 7, 2015, at a “Politics and Pies” forum, Graham advocated the reversal of defense spending cuts and quipped: [...] "If I were President of the United States, I wouldn't let Congress leave town until we fix this. I would literally use the military {{to keep them in}} if I had to." ...|$|E
5000|$|Ryan Gilbey, {{reviewing}} the film for The Guardian, noted that, [...] "Actors who try their hand {{as a director}} typically start off with something small-scale - a sensitive coming-of-age story, say, such as Jodie Foster’s Little Man Tate or Robert De Niro’s A Bronx Tale. With Lost in London, Harrelson went as far {{in the opposite direction}} as one can imagine. This was edge-of-the-seat, seat-of-the-pants film-making. He didn’t <b>just</b> <b>jump</b> <b>in</b> at the deep end: he did so into shark-filled waters." [...] Overall, Gilbey wrote, [...] "Bumps and wrinkles in the film would doubtless have been remedied with the luxury of reshoots. … Nothing, though, will quite match the sensation of having watched the messy but miraculous birth of a genuine oddity: part celebrity satire, part mea culpa, part site-specific, one-night-only art installation." ...|$|E
5000|$|Tyler {{looks for}} a legendary valley, in Blackfoot territory, [...] "so full of beaver that they <b>just</b> <b>jump</b> <b>in</b> the traps." [...] Running Moon leaves her abusive husband, a {{ruthless}} Blackfoot warrior named Heavy Eagle, and comes across the two trappers in the dying days of the fur trapping era. While at first Bill only wants {{to take her to}} safety at the rendezvous, she eventually becomes his woman. While trapping Bill and Henry are attacked by Blackfeet and Henry is scalped by Heavy Eagle in front of Bill. Bill runs back to camp and he and Running Moon flee only to be caught. Later, Bill (thinking Running Moon has also been killed) is given a chance to run (similar to the real life event of John Colter) and is chased by warriors whom he initially eludes by hiding in a beaver den. They pursue him until he and Heavy Eagle fall into a raging river. Heavy Eagle makes it to shore and Bill goes over a waterfall. Heavy Eagle tries to make Running Moon his woman again which he cannot do. He knows Bill Tyler survived and will come for her as he had done.|$|E
5000|$|Asked about [...] "Tomorrow", O'Riordan told Billboard that [...] "it's {{about the}} way we {{sometimes}} hyper over-escalate things in our minds, overthink about things...when sometimes spontaneity and <b>just</b> <b>jumping</b> <b>in</b> is better. Tomorrow you might not have that moment back again. So it's really about moving on and also about kind of looking at the younger generation and how they worry about all kinds of silly things. They don't think they're silly, but when you're older you know better." [...] A one-minute preview of the song was released on 31 July 2011.|$|R
5000|$|A staged [...] "flash mob"-like {{event at}} the station in early 2009, {{featuring}} the song [...] "Do-Re-Mi" [...] from the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical The Sound of Music, became a viral video.

At {{the start of}} the fight, it was clear that Heiland's left leg was injured. Charlo first dropped Heiland in round 2 with a left to the head. In round 4, Charlo landed another left hook to the head which dropped Heiland again. Heiland beat the count, but as he was getting up, he stumbled around due to the injury. Referee Benji Esteves stopped the fight immediately at 2:13 of the fourth round to ensure Heiland took no more punishment. Charlo spoke to Showtime's Jim Gray in the post fight interview, “Sometimes the injury can be a decoy. You never want to <b>just</b> <b>jump</b> <b>in</b> and think it’s part of his game plan. My coach Shields told me to stay behind my job like I did, continue to work and it’s gonna come.” The ringside doctor checked Heiland's leg before the fourth round but let the action continue. Heiland stated that his leg was okay before the fight an the injury occurred in the opening round. Charlo earned $350,000 compared to Heiland who had $200,000 purse.

I was feeling too guilty about just sitting and realized there was no reason I couldn’t just walk laps around the pool while she swam. I found that it took 15 laps to equal 1000 steps! I realized I can do this every morning (or afternoon or whenever) {{for the rest of the}} summer when she wants to swim. I can do it in my bathing suit and then <b>just</b> <b>jump</b> <b>in</b> the pool afterward and swim with her for two more exercises.

40|$|Welcome {{everyone}} to our second learner-led e-dialogue on eco-modeling, leadership {{and social change}} by Roberta Martell. I would like to kick start this one by asking each of you to post {{what you think the}} characteristics of a good leader are? Karen Dawson on January 09, 2004, 05 : 03 PM: What a juicy question with which to begin. Hi gang, I'm going to be brave and <b>just</b> <b>jump</b> <b>in.</b> An effective leader is courageous, self-aware, a learner, a listener, and cares about making {{the world a better place}} [...] . no matter what part of the world that might be. I think I'll stop there. Feeling rather like I could go on but I don't want to piss you off before we've even really started. Judy Lorinczi on January 09, 2004, 05 : 03 PM: Hi Anne! I recently engaged in an e-dialogue where I described my impression of what the characteristics of leaders are. This is what I came up with: Leaders are all around us. They are people from all walks of life whose engaging influence can stir within us the emergence of sometimes previously dormant emotions. Leaders may inspire us to such degree that we can surprise ourselves with the powerful engagement of our emotion...|$|E

5000|$|Robert Forster {{in a later}} {{interview}} {{described as}} a song he loved, [...] "I really like the powerful build-up, it hits the line about lightning and then it’s like a crescendo.It’s written by Grant and he wrote it probably two years or something before he died, and I think it’s {{one of the best}} five to 10 songs he ever did. Magnificent song. I wrote most of the lyric." [...] "He wrote the chorus thing and I asked if I could write the verse lyric. It was so fresh; he played it to me and he’d only written it a week or two ago. He’d written the chorus and he was just making stuff up in the verses. I asked him - it just hit me so hard, I could hear it and I drove away from that session and I had that song in my head. I got home and I just wrote the lyric. Phoned him up and said, “I’m sorry but I <b>just</b> <b>jumped</b> <b>in</b> on this.” He said, “Great, bring it over to me.” A couple of days later I had it all on a sheet and he put the sheet beside his guitar, sang it first time through, put in his chorus - all that lightning stuff is his as well, that middle eight is all him as well. He just put his chorus and middle eight to my three verses and bang, you know? It’s a real collaborative piece of songwriting." ...|$|R

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} carried out to study the unsteady nature of flow phenomenon in thrust optimized parabolic rocket nozzles {{as a function of}} nozzle pressure ratio especially during the transition phase during which the separation shock jumps downstream at a certain nozzle pressure ratio. The study was conducted using wall pressure measurements both in axial and circumferential directions, color Schlieren images of exhaust plume and surface oil visualization technique. The experiments reveal the <b>jump</b> <b>in</b> separation front during the transition phase to be asymmetric (for the first time) that is accompanied by violent fluctuations of the separation shock. Such an unsteady asymmetric transition process seems to be the prime cause of considerably high side-loads observed earlier rather than <b>just</b> the downstream <b>jump</b> <b>in</b> separation front...|$|R
