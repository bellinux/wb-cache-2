2500|$|In medieval Europe, {{local laws}} on weights and {{measures}} were set by trade guilds on a city-by-city basis. For example, the ell or elle was a unit of length commonly used in Europe, but its length varied from 40.2centimetres {{in one part of}} Germany to 70centimetres in The Netherlands and 94.5centimetres in Edinburgh. A survey of Switzerland in 1838 revealed that the foot had 37 different regional variations, the ell had 68, there were 83 different measures for <b>dry</b> <b>grain,</b> 70 measures for fluids and 63 different measures for [...] "dead weights". When Isaac Newton wrote Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica in 1687, he quoted his measurements in Parisian feet so readers could understand the size. Examples of efforts to have local intercity or national standards for measurements include the Scottish law of 1641, and the British standard imperial system of 1824, which is still commonly used in the United Kingdom. At one time Imperial China had successfully standardised units for volume throughout its territory, but by 1936 official investigations uncovered 53 values for the chi varying from 200millimetres to 1250millimetres; 32 values of the cheng, between 500millilitres and 8litres; and 36 different tsin ranging from 300grams to 2500grams. However, revolutionary France was to produce the definitive International System of Units which has come to be used by most of the world today.|$|E

In Exp. 1, 60 Angus heifers (278 ± 16 kg) were individually fed diets consisting of 58 % ground corn cobs, 12 % sorghum silage, and 30 % distillers <b>dried</b> <b>grains</b> (DM basis) in Calan electronic gates. Urea replaced distillers <b>dried</b> <b>grains</b> at 0, 0. 4, 0. 8, 1. 2, or 1. 6 % of diet DM. In Exp. 2, 48 crossbred heifers were fed meadow hay ad libitum and 1. 4 kg (DM) distillers <b>dried</b> <b>grains</b> to which was added either 0 or 45 g urea/ heifer daily. In both experiments, no response in animal weight gain or feed efficiency was observed when urea {{was added to the}} diet. Based on retrospective NRC (1996) model analysis of diets, metabolizable protein was in excess of requirements.

The mean weight of the earthworms under the three different treatments was significantly different (P < 0. 05); with earthworms fed brewers <b>dried</b> <b>grain</b> recording the highest mean weight (1. 03 ± 0. 50). No significant difference was observed in the percentage crude fibre, crude protein and moisture between A. millsoni from different treatments; whereas a significant difference (P < 0. 05) was observed in the percentage crude fat and ash between A. millsoni from the different treatments with A. millsoni fed brewers <b>dried</b> <b>grain</b> recording the highest percentage crude fat. Weight of worms was significantly and positively correlated to feed source (P < 0. 05).

50|$|There is {{potential}} for loss throughout the grain harvesting and agricultural marketing chains. During stripping of maize grain from the cob, known as shelling, losses can occurwhen mechanical shelling is not followed up by hand-stripping of the grains that are missed. Certain shellers {{can damage the}} grain, making insect penetration easier. For crops other than maize, threshing losses occur {{as a result of}} spillage, incomplete removal of the grain or by damage to grain during the threshing. They can also occur after threshing due to poor separation of grain from the chaff during cleaning or winnowing. Incomplete threshing usually occurs in regions with high labour costs, particularly at harvest time, when labour is too scarce and expensive to justify hand-stripping after an initial mechanical thresh. Certain mechanical threshers are designed only for <b>dry</b> <b>grain.</b>|$|E

50|$|Multiple layer drying method {{refers to}} the use of LP heat or natural gas in drying corn. Compared to {{low-temperature}} methods, multiple-layer drying requires higher temperatures, which results in a shorter allowable storage time.Multiple-layer drying without stirring is the basic multiple-layer drying method, in which airstream is entered through an LP heater by a fan. Usually, the temperature rise after the LP burner is remained low in order to avoid over drying in the bottom layers in the bin. As soon as corn is dried in the bin, the burner is turned off and the fan is used to bring the corn to ambient temperature. The advantages of multiple-layer drying without stirring are little handling of corn, and bin can be used as either dryer or storage; the disadvantages are slow filling and over drying in the bottom layers (Bern and Brumm, 2010).Multiple-layer drying with stirring can not only <b>dry</b> <b>grain</b> equilibrium from top to bottom, but also decrease the air resistance of the grain. Moreover, using stirring system can avoid over drying in bottom layer problem and give a uniform grain moisture content in the whole bin. When drying is complete, the burner is turned off while the fan and stirrer are used to mix the corn to achieve equal moisture content and temperature. The advantages of adding stirring are preventing over drying and accelerating drying and allowable fill rate; the disadvantages of stirring system are additional expenses and decreasing bin capacity.|$|E
50|$|In-storage drying methods {{refers to}} those grain is dried {{and stored in}} the same container. Low-temperature drying, also known as near-ambient drying, is one of in-storage drying methods. There are four major factors which {{influence}} low temperature drying: the variability of weather, the harvest moisture content, the air flow in the storage bin {{and the amount of}} heated air. Most low-temperature dryers are built to <b>dry</b> <b>grain</b> as slowly as possible, while in the same time less spoilage on the grain. It is suggested that low temperature drying system is better operated when the average daily temperature is between 30 °C and 50 °C. Rather than control the drying air temperature, the low-temperature drying focuses on the relative humidity in order to achieve equilibrium moisture content (EMC) in all grain layers. Low-temperature drying process usually takes 5 days to several months depends on several important variables: weather, airflow, initial moisture content and amount of heat used. Among which, airflow is the key factor. Without appropriate airflow rate, spoilage will occur before drying is completed. By using heated air (LP heat, electric heat and solar heat), the relative humidity of the drying air is better controlled to achieve the desired moisture content. Usually, heated air dryer is used when the relative humidity larger than 70%. In electric heat dryers, an electrical resistant heater is usually placed before the fan to heat the airstream. In some case, a humidistat is employed to control the heater. In solar heat dryers, the drying air passes through the solar collector first to be heated (usually 10 to 12 °F rise), then enters the bin through the fan and motor. The advantages of in-storage low temperature drying are quick filling, high quality product, less equipment requirement; while the disadvantages are long drying time, electrical demand if using electric heat, high management skills and uncertain harvest moisture content.|$|E

In the first experiment, cows were bred to calve in spring, summer or fall. Calves from each system were managed as calf-feds or yearlings and followed through finishing. Altering calving season impacted cow BW and BCS but did not affect re-breeding performance or the percent of cows to calve. However, fall calving cows produced fewer weaned calves compared to spring and summer calving cows. In addition, there was a significant effect of calving season on calf finishing performance and economics. Wintering system did not affect performance or profitability of cow systems. The second study evaluated <b>dried</b> distillers <b>grain</b> supplementation to steers grazing cool season meadow. Results from this study suggest that lower levels of DDGS supplementation (0. 6 % BW) do not effect summer ADG or ending BW. However, when supplementation was increased (1. 2 % BW) ADG and ending BW were increased. In addition, supplementing <b>dried</b> distillers <b>grains</b> to calves grazing cool season meadow did not affect subsequent feedlot performance but BW at harvest was greater for steers supplemented <b>dried</b> distillers <b>grains.</b> The third study, evaluated <b>dried</b> distillers <b>grains</b> supplementation to cattle in forage based growing systems across multiple studies. Results from this study indicate that cattle supplemented <b>dried</b> distillers <b>grains</b> have greater gains during summer grazing.
