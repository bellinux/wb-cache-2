5|$|The {{design for}} the album's artwork was by Hipgnosis, the company {{responsible}} for previous Wings album covers such as Venus and Mars (1975) and the recent Wings Greatest compilation (1978). The front cover depicts the five members of Wings in a room, looking down through space at Planet Earth through an open <b>hatchway</b> in the floor; the picture was taken by photographer John Shaw at his London studio. Photos of the individual band members appeared on the back cover, credited to Linda and Paul McCartney.|$|E
5|$|A hatch or <b>hatchway</b> is {{the opening}} {{at the top of}} a cargo hold. The {{mechanical}} devices which allow hatches to be opened and closed are called hatch cover. In general, hatch covers are between 45% and 60% of the ship's breadth, or beam, and 57% to 67% of the length of the holds. To efficiently load and unload cargo, hatches must be large, but large hatches present structural problems. Hull stress is concentrated around the edges of the hatches, and these areas must be reinforced. Often, hatch areas are reinforced by locally increasing the scantlings or by adding structural members called stiffeners. Both of these options have the undesired effect of adding weight to the ship.|$|E
5|$|The ship {{also carried}} a {{contingent}} of 31 marines of the New South Wales Marine Corps, comprising lieutenants Thomas Davey and Thomas Timins, five non-commissioned officers, and 24 privates. Sixteen of the marines embarked with their wives, and there were six children. Discipline was poor. In June 1787 two marines were court-martialed for disobeying orders; one received 300 lashes. Later in the voyage, two sergeants refused to share a mess after one insulted the other's wife. Drunkenness was also common. In June one drunken marine sergeant fell through an open <b>hatchway</b> and injured the pregnant wife of another marine, for which offence he was placed in legcuffs for two weeks and then transferred to Alexander. Then in late October, First Lieutenant James Maxwell, who had recently transferred aboard from Charlotte, was found incoherently drunk on duty and promptly returned to Charlotte.|$|E
6000|$|Happily a fresh {{burst of}} riotous clamour, {{from one of}} the <b>hatchways,</b> {{interrupted}} the intention; and then was heard the cry of,--- ...|$|R
50|$|According to the Annexes to the Convention, {{also taken}} into account are the {{potential}} hazards present in different zones and different seasons and additional safety measures concerning doors, <b>hatchways</b> etc.|$|R
60|$|The {{bursting}} of a thunder-clap, {{the explosion}} of a powder-magazine, could not have more effectually awakened the slumberers than this abrupt stoppage of the ship's engines. Instantly all the <b>hatchways</b> poured forth anxious inquirers.|$|R
25|$|Although many real dungeons {{are simply}} a single plain {{room with a}} heavy door or with access only from a <b>hatchway</b> or {{trapdoor}} in {{the floor of the}} room above, the use of dungeons for torture, along with their association to common human fears of being trapped underground, have made dungeons a powerful metaphor in a variety of contexts. Dungeons, in the plural, have come to be associated with underground complexes of cells and torture chambers. As a result, the number of true dungeons in castles is often exaggerated to interest tourists. Many chambers described as dungeons or oubliettes were in fact storerooms, water-cisterns or even latrines.|$|E
25|$|Barrett went {{up along}} a <b>hatchway</b> {{to reach the}} {{starboard}} side of A Deck where {{there were only two}} lifeboats left. He escaped the sinking ship on lifeboat 13, which was filled with about 65 or 70 people. Lifeboat 15 nearly came down on top of their lifeboat, but they got out in time. He was put in charge of the lifeboat for about an hour, until he got cold he had to let someone else take over. At one point a woman put a cloak over him, and he was unable to remember anything that took place after that in the lifeboat. At 4:45am Barrett and the others in the lifeboat were rescued by the RMS Carpathia.|$|E
25|$|Docking to Harmony/Pressurized Mating Adapter-2 {{occurred}} {{a couple}} of minutes ahead of schedule at 16:51 UTC. The joined spacecraft were orbiting 220 miles above Earth at the time of docking, above Australia and Tasmania. After leak checks, the <b>hatchway</b> between Atlantis and the space station was opened at 18:28 UTC. The traditional welcome ceremony and the station safety briefing followed, and shuttle and station crews began their joint operations for the rest of day. The astronauts worked to move the spacewalking suits carried up on Atlantis over to the Quest airlock for use in the EVAs. After the hatch opening, astronaut Nicole Stott’s tenure as a station Expedition 21 flight engineer came to an end as she joined the Atlantis crew.|$|E
60|$|The <b>hatchways</b> of some armed {{vessels are}} but poorly secured in bad weather. This was peculiarly {{the ease with}} those of the Neversink. They were merely spread over with an old tarpaulin, cracked and rent in every direction.|$|R
50|$|Because of the {{extraordinary}} length of the building - which {{reminds us of the}} speicher in Bremen - the design included two main stairs leading to the higher floors seven elevators, eight lifts and two internal <b>hatchways</b> connected with the cellar.|$|R
60|$|But {{all this}} availed not {{to check the}} flames. The men were quickly driven upon deck, and it soon became evident that the vessel must perish. The fire burst through the <b>hatchways,</b> and {{in a short time}} began to leap up the rigging.|$|R
25|$|The {{force of}} the blast ripped most of the {{branches}} from the Survivor Tree. Glass and debris were embedded in its trunk and fire from the cars parked beneath it blackened what was left. Most thought the tree could not survive. Almost {{a year after the}} bombing, family members, survivors, and rescue workers gathered for a memorial ceremony by the tree noticed it was beginning to bloom again. The Survivor Tree now thrives, and the Outdoor Memorial design includes a mandate to feature and protect the tree. For example, one of the roots that would have been cut by the wall surrounding the tree was placed inside a large pipe so it could reach the soil beyond the wall without being damaged. The decking around the tree was raised several feet to make an underground crawlspace; workers enter through a secure <b>hatchway</b> and monitor the health of the tree and maintain its very deep roots.|$|E
25|$|The lantern {{room with}} {{hemispherical}} dome roof sits {{on top of}} the tower and is accessed via a <b>hatchway</b> in the floor which is lined with lead. All optics have been removed from the lantern, but a pedestal similar to the original has been recently installed. The cylindrical lantern base is constructed from 4.5mm thick steel plates, with a hatch door on the northern side to allow access to the exterior gallery. Its middle section consists of eight trapezoidal frames, five of which are glazed. The remaining three frames (on the western side) are filled with galvanized sheeting with diagonal bracing. The dome is made from eight steel segments bolted together with additional bar stiffeners. It is painted red on the exterior and topped with a ventilator cowl. The narrow gallery that encircles the lantern has a hardwood timber floor supported by cast iron brackets, and a lightweight tubular balustrade, also painted red.|$|E
25|$|They {{were pretty}} good sea boats, {{although}} very wet, {{there was a}} saying that they submerged at the Heads and surfaced down at Gabo Island. We worked mainly four on, four off. Turn to, to ‘shoot away’, pick up and store the catch and clean up. We worked bloody long hours. I think there were six deckies, four firemen, one engineer, one wireless operator and the master and mate. The galley was right aft with the mess room beneath. You would get your feed, climb down the <b>hatchway</b> to the mess room below. We would get {{a bucket of water}} from the galley to take to the forecastle where we bunked. By the time we got forward we would have only half a bucket of hot water to wash in but after a couple of days you didn’t worry about washing. You were wet through most of the time so it didn’t matter.|$|E
25|$|On 22 May Telegraph {{came into}} Plymouth. A gale {{a few days}} earlier had put Telegraph on her beam ends for several minutes with water up to the combing of her <b>hatchways.</b> It was only when the fore top-mast and the {{bowsprit}} went that she righted.|$|R
60|$|That same night, {{when the}} first watch was set, the men in a body drove the two boatswain's mates from their {{stations}} at the fore and main <b>hatchways,</b> and unshipped the ladders; thus cutting off all communication between the gun and spar decks, forward of the main-mast.|$|R
50|$|The cellar, fully excavated, {{was another}} large, {{open space and}} at each end were stone arches to support {{the weight of the}} {{fireplaces}} and chimneys above. Access to the cellar, for storage of crops, was by way of two outside <b>hatchways</b> (since removed) built into the front foundation.|$|R
25|$|Four {{explosion}}s {{were clearly}} detected. The fourth explosion {{was so strong}} that the stern of the Cuban ship was submerged and water came in through the <b>hatchway</b> of the engine room. At that time the hydrophones reported a sound similar to a liquid bubbling when it comes from a submerged container that is suddenly opened. The sounds indicated that the U-boat had been hit. To finish the U-boat off, the patrol boat launched two more depth charges, set to explode at 250 feet. A few minutes later, a dark stain was observed {{on the surface of the}} water. A spurt of a black and viscous substance smelling like gasoline came up from the deep. Although there was little doubt that the U-boat had been sunk, Delgado was ordered to take a sample of the contaminated seawater to confirm the victory. But even then it wasn't until after the war, when the Allies seized Germany's naval records, that proof of U-176s sinking was found. According to the seized documents, U-176 was under the command of Captain Lieutenant Reiner Dierksen, had sunk eleven enemy ships in her career, and was herself sunk with all hands lost.|$|E
500|$|The British {{had cleared}} the upper decks of American resistance, {{and most of}} Chesapeakes crew had taken refuge on the berth deck. A musket or pistol shot from the berth deck killed a British marine, William Young, who was {{guarding}} the main <b>hatchway.</b> The furious British crewmen then began firing through the <b>hatchway</b> at the Americans crowded below. Lieutenant Charles Leslie Falkiner of Shannon, {{the leader of the}} boarders who had rushed the maindeck, restored order by threatening to blow out the brains of the next person to fire. He then demanded that the Americans send up the man who had killed Young, adding that Chesapeake was taken and [...] "We have three hundred men aboard. If there is another act of hostility you will be called up on deck one by one– and shot." [...] Falkiner was given command of Chesapeake as a British prize-vessel.|$|E
500|$|Little {{is known}} about West Apaums {{subsequent}} civilian career. In {{the first quarter of}} 1927, it is known that West Apaum was sailing on a New York – Rotterdam route. While in this service, The New York Times, in one of just a few mentions the ship received in contemporary news coverage, reported on the transfer of one of West Apaums crew members to the United States Lines ocean liner [...] at sea. The crewman had fallen into an open <b>hatchway</b> and had fractured his skull. The two ships, located some [...] west of New York, came within [...] of each other and the injured man was loaded onto a boat from Republic in the heavy seas. The crewman, though successfully transferred to Republic, died several hours later.|$|E
60|$|We had {{scarcely}} time to draw breath {{after the}} violence of this shock, {{when one of the}} most tremendous waves I had then ever known broke right on board of us, sweeping the companion-way clear off, bursting in the <b>hatchways,</b> and filling every inch of the vessel with water.|$|R
50|$|In England, Ireland, {{and other}} areas {{with large numbers of}} {{livestock}} fences and walls in areas through which people walk on footpaths, stiles often have wooden, lift-up dog <b>hatchways</b> next to them, because dogs are not good at climbing stile steps and are often too heavy to lift over a fence.|$|R
60|$|At length, {{when the}} last pint is casked, and all is cool, then the great <b>hatchways</b> are unsealed, {{the bowels of the}} ship are thrown open, and down go the casks to their final rest in the sea. This done, the hatches are replaced, and {{hermetically}} closed, like a closet walled up.|$|R
500|$|Lieutenant Ludlow, who {{had been}} {{slightly}} wounded and had gone down to Chesapeakes cockpit for treatment, now returned to the upper decks, rallying some of the American crew as he did so. Lieutenant Budd joined him with a band of men he had led up the fore-hatch. Ludlow led them in a counter-attack which pushed the British {{back as far as}} the binnacle. However, a wave of British reinforcements arrived, Ludlow received a mortal wound from a cutlass, and the Americans were again thrown back. James Bulger, one of Shannons Irishmen, charged into the Americans wielding a boarding pike and shouting Gaelic curses - [...] "And then did I not spit them, beJaysus!" [...] Lacking officers to lead them (Lieutenant Budd had also been wounded by a cutlass) and lacking support from below, the Americans were driven back by the boarders. American resistance then fell apart, {{with the exception of a}} band of men on the forecastle and those in the tops. A number of the Americans driven from the upper decks jostled each other to get down the main <b>hatchway</b> to the comparative safety of the berth deck. Seeing this, Lt. Cox called to them, [...] "You damned cowardly sons of bitches! What are you jumping below for?" [...] When asked by a nearby midshipman if he should stop them by cutting a few down, Cox replied, [...] "No sir, it is of no use." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1976, Ontario singer-songwriter Gordon Lightfoot wrote, composed, and {{recorded}} the song [...] "The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald" [...] for his album Summertime Dream. On NPR's Saturday Morning Edition on February 14, 2015, Gordon Lightfoot {{said he was}} inspired to write the song {{when he saw the}} name misspelled [...] "Edmond" [...] in Newsweek magazine two weeks after the sinking; Lightfoot said he felt that it dishonored the memory of the 29 who died. Lightfoot's popular ballad made the sinking of Fitzgerald one of the better-known disasters in the history of Great Lakes shipping. The original lyrics of the song show a degree of artistic license compared to the events of the actual sinking: it states the destination as Cleveland instead of Detroit and, in light of new evidence about what happened, Lightfoot has modified one line for live performances, changing “When suppertime came the old cook came on deck / Saying ‘Fellas, it’s too rough to feed ya.’ / At 7 p.m. a main <b>hatchway</b> caved in / He said, ‘Fellas, it's been good to know ya.” to “When suppertime came the old cook came on deck / Saying ‘Fellows it’s too rough to feed ya.’ / At 7 p.m. it grew dark, it was then / He said, ‘Fellas, it's been good to know ya.’” The song has been covered by many performers. The Toronto rock band Rheostatics recorded it for their second album, Melville, and their live album Double Live. The Dandy Warhols also covered the song in their The Black Album in 2004.|$|E
500|$|The worst {{cells for}} {{confinement}} as a punishment for inmates who {{stepped out of}} line were located {{at the end of}} D-Block in cells 9–14, known as [...] "The Hole". The cells were devoid of light and colder {{than the rest of the}} prison, and prisoners sent here were regularly stripped, beaten, and tortured and often starved, forced to sleep on the cold concrete floor wearing nothing but light underwear. In turn, guards were abused, and often had faeces, urine or food thrown at them or were spat at. Inmates held in the hole were limited to just one 10-minute shower and an hour of exercise in the yard a week. The five cells of [...] "The Hole" [...] had nothing but a sink and toilet and the very worst cell was nicknamed [...] "The Oriental" [...] or [...] "Strip Cell", the final cell of the block with nothing but a hole in the floor as a toilet, in which prisoners would often be confined naked with nothing else for two days. The guards controlled the flushing of the toilet in that cell. A <b>hatchway</b> in the floor on D-Block also led to the dungeon in the basement which contained several cells. The worst behaved inmates would be locked inside their cells in the dungeon, chained to the walls. They were given a meager diet of bread and water each day, and one regular meal every three days, although the quantity and duration often varied relative to the extent of the punishment. Denied of proper toilet facilities, they were given a bucket as a toilet, emptied once a week, and stripped and chained to the wall standing at nights; according to Alvin J. Esau, prisoners in solitary confinement were [...] "placed on a starvation diet and made to stand nine hours each day with hands tied and their feet barely touching the floor." [...] After completing the punishment in the hole, the prisoner could then return to his cell but be tagged; a red tag, third grade, denoted a prisoner who was restricted from leaving his cell for perhaps 3 months. At second grade the prisoners could receive letters, and if after 30 days they remained behaved, they would then be restored full prison privileges.|$|E
60|$|A {{quarter of}} an hour; and yet no response. The moon is shining clearly now. They can see her <b>hatchways,</b> the stumps of her masts, great tangles of rigging swaying and lashing down across her deck; but that {{delicate}} upper curve is becoming more ragged after every wave; and the tide is rising fast.|$|R
60|$|Sir Oliver {{sat down}} upon a coil of rope, his guard about him, {{an object of}} curious {{inspection}} to the rude seamen. They thronged the forecastle and the <b>hatchways</b> to stare at this formidable corsair who once had been a Cornish gentleman and who had become a renegade Muslim and a terror to Christianity.|$|R
6000|$|Morning {{brings a}} summons. Whistling it calls, Shrilled through the pipes of the boatswain's [...] four aids; Trilled down the <b>hatchways</b> along the dusk [...] halls: Muster to the Scourge!--Dawn of doom and [...] its blast! As from cemeteries raised, sailors swarm before [...] the mast, Tumbling up the ladders from the ship's nether [...] shades.|$|R
2500|$|Releasing the {{leaflets}} can be {{as simple}} as having one or more of the aircraft's crew throw bundles of paper from an open <b>hatchway.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Boreas was {{commissioned}} {{for the first}} time in August 1757 under Captain Robert Boyle, who was to command her for the next two years. Her rigging and fitout were completed by September and she was sailed to Portsmouth to take on her guns. Flaws in her design were apparent even at this early stage; in December 1757 Captain Boyle advised Admiralty that the fir planks adjacent to the hatchways were already badly worn, as were the strakes along the hull. Boyle unsuccessfully recommended that the <b>hatchway</b> timbers and the hull be re-covered with elm. He also observed that the aft <b>hatchway</b> had been constructed directly above the entrance to the magazine, which [...] "may be of fatal consequence in time of action." [...] Further, the sides of the vessel above the level of the deck were too low, leaving the crew exposed to enemy fire should Boreas run alongside an opposing ship.|$|E
2500|$|In March 2010, Lightfoot {{changed a}} line during live {{performances}} to reflect new findings {{that there was}} no crew error involved in the sinking. The line originally read, [...] "At 7 p.m. a main <b>hatchway</b> caved in; he said..."; it is now sung as [...] "At 7 p.m. it grew dark, it was then he said...". Lightfoot learned about the new research when contacted for permission to use his song for a History Channel [...] documentary that aired on March 31, 2010. Lightfoot has stated that {{he has no intention of}} changing the original copyrighted lyrics; instead from now on, he will simply sing the new ones during live performances.|$|E
60|$|The {{gratings}} are square {{frames of}} barred wood-work, sometimes {{placed over the}} <b>hatchways.</b> One of these squares was now laid on the deck, close to the ship's bulwarks, and while the remaining preparations were being made, the master-at-arms assisted the prisoners in removing their jackets and shirts. This done, their shirts were loosely thrown over their shoulders.|$|R
25|$|On {{the morning}} of 2 April, while about 30 miles to the {{south-east}} of Cape St. Sebastian, thick smoke was seen coming from the fore and main <b>hatchways.</b> Attempts were made to find {{the source of the}} fire but no flames could be discovered. Orders were given to throw the ship's gunpowder overboard and an unsuccessful attempt was made to flood the magazine.|$|R
50|$|To {{prevent the}} suit ballooning, the Yastreb suit {{featured}} a pulley-and-cable articulation system. Wide metal rings around the gray nylon canvas undersuit's upper arms served as anchors {{for the upper}} body articulation system. The Yastreb had a regenerative life support system in a rectangular white metal box placed on the chest and abdomen to facilitate movement through the Soyuz's <b>hatchways.</b>|$|R
