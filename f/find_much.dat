5|$|Over {{the next}} four seasons, the Colts won 48 of 64 games, but still could not <b>find</b> <b>much</b> success in the postseason. In 2002, they were blown out 41–0 in the wild card round by the New York Jets. In 2003, they won their first two playoff games behind {{impressive}} offensive performances, and reached the AFC title game. There, they lost to the eventual champion New England Patriots 24–14, with Manning throwing four interceptions. In 2004, the Colts {{had one of the}} most spectacular offensive seasons in NFL history, scoring 522 points and gaining 6,582 yards, while Manning set NFL records for most touchdown passes and highest passer rating. But again the Patriots' defense (and snowy conditions) proved too formidable, as they lost 20–3 in the divisional round of the playoffs.|$|E
5|$|On {{his return}} from National Service in 1962 Dibnah {{retrieved}} his tools from storage, bought a 1927 350cc AJS motorcycle for 21guineas and looked for more work. Bolton, however, {{was in the midst}} of post-industrial decline; between 1957 and 1965 about 70mills were closed in the town, leaving only 37mills operational and about 50disused. Initially he was unable to <b>find</b> <b>much</b> work and existed on smaller, domestic jobs, until he earned enough to buy his own set of ladders and secured his first commission while working at a local mill. He was paid £140 to point a mill tower, which he did at weekends. He struggled, however, to get any more meaningful work, until he met Lonsdale Bonner, one of his teachers from art college. The two agreed a deal whereby Bonner would be paid a commission for each job he got for Dibnah. His first job was dismantling a chimney alongside the Manchester and Bolton Railway, a difficult proposition, as a mistake could force the temporary closure of the railway. The two managed to gain commissions for several jobs, but their relationship was terminated when Dibnah was called upon to undertake another six months of National Service.|$|E

25|$|The 1751 Carnival in Dresden saw the {{retirement}} of Faustina from operatic performance. Hasse continued to produce new operas throughout the decade, including a setting of Metastasio's Il re pastore, a text later used by Mozart. In 1756 the Seven Years' War compelled the court at Dresden to move to Warsaw, though Hasse himself lived mostly in Italy, travelling to Poland solely to supervise productions of his operas, if at all. In the autumn of 1760 he moved to Vienna, where he stayed {{for the next two}} years, returning to Dresden in 1763 to <b>find</b> <b>much</b> of his home destroyed and the musical apparatus of the court opera wrecked. Hasse's main patron at Dresden, king Augustus III of Poland and Saxony died soon after and his successor, who also died quickly, deemed elaborate musical events at the court superfluous.

In April 2008, the then-Bobcats reached a naming rights deal with Time Warner Cable, the Charlotte area's major cable television provider; the arena was named for the cable provider in exchange for the release of the team's television rights, which had been on the TWC co-owned Carolinas Sports Entertainment Television for its first season, which failed to <b>find</b> <b>much</b> cable coverage in the Charlotte market outside of Time Warner systems and went dark after a year, and then News 14 Carolina which was limited to only the North Carolina side of the market, until the arena naming rights deal was made.

Shortly after being acquired by Charter, the arena was renamed to Spectrum Center.|$|E

In this he differed from Johnson, who thought Shakespeare best at comedy.

As he expressed it at the end of [...] "Lear", tragedy describes the strongest passions, and [...] "the greatest strength of genius is shewn here in describing the strongest passions: for the power of the imagination, in works of invention, must be in proportion to the force of the natural impressions, which are the subject of them." ...|$|E
