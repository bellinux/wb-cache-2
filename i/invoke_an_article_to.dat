50|$|In {{several dozen}} communes in the Vaslui County, mayors and local councils have banned shale gas exploitation, {{arguing that it}} would harm the environment, or {{drinking}} water. The decisions approved by local councils and supported by resident population are considered out-of-scope (and thus not legally binding) by the Government. In this way, the communes were urged to revoke bans on shale gas exploitation. More than that, Vaslui County Prefecture brought to court 11 decisions made by local councils, that disagree with the exploitations. The Prefecture <b>invokes</b> <b>an</b> <b>article</b> of the Constitution, according to which deposits are owned {{by the state and}} local council approval is not required. In reply, mayors of the communes where derricks will be installed say they will not abandon the idea of banning the Canadian company's presence in the areas they lead.|$|R
