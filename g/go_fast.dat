5|$|The {{incident}} between Lehto and Lamy {{caused the}} safety car to be deployed, {{with all the}} remaining competitors holding position behind it while travelling at a reduced speed. During this period, {{as a result of}} travelling at slower speeds, tyre temperatures dropped. At the drivers' briefing before the race, Senna, along with Gerhard Berger, had expressed concern that the safety car (itself only reintroduced in Formula One in 1993 and only the third time used since then, the other occurrences being the 1993 Brazilian Grand Prix and the 1993 British Grand Prix) did not <b>go</b> <b>fast</b> enough to keep tyre temperatures high. Senna was also worried by a procedure introduced at the 1994 Pacific Grand Prix, whereby the safety car would lead the grid on the formation lap, rather than letting the race leader choose the pace of the formation lap. The procedure was removed for this race.|$|E
5|$|Acid {{digestion}} is a two-stage process, {{involving the}} use of up to 93% sulfuric acid at 210–230°C. First, 60% sulfuric acid is added, thickening the reaction mixture as products are formed. Then, fuming sulfuric acid is added and the mixture is kept at the same temperature for another five hours to reduce the volume of solution remaining after dilution. The concentration of the sulfuric acid is selected based on reaction rate and viscosity, which both increase with concentration, albeit with viscosity retarding the reaction. Increasing the temperature also speeds up the reaction, but temperatures of 300°C and above must be avoided, because they cause insoluble thorium pyrophosphate to form. Since dissolution is very exothermic, the monazite sand cannot {{be added to the}} acid too quickly. Conversely, at temperatures below 200°C the reaction does not <b>go</b> <b>fast</b> enough for the process to be practical. To ensure that no precipitates form to block the reactive monazite surface, the mass of acid used must be twice that of the sand, instead of the 60% that would be expected from stoichiometry. The mixture is then cooled to 70°C and diluted with ten times its volume of cold water, so that any remaining monazite sinks to the bottom while the rare earths and thorium remain in solution. Thorium may then be separated by precipitating it as the phosphate at pH 1.3, since the rare earths do not precipitate until pH 2.|$|E
25|$|SLOW RACE (50 metres of the track); six competitors. This {{race was}} very amusing; the riders tried their {{best not to}} <b>go</b> <b>fast,</b> without stopping; their {{contrary}} movements made them fall except for Mr. J. Darenty, student of the Grand Gymnasium, who won the prize.|$|E

So Spotty the Turtle, who has to carry his house with him, was a long, long way behind the others. But he kept right on going.|$|R

2500|$|Miller's autobiography, Bode: <b>Go</b> <b>Fast,</b> Be Good, Have Fun, co-written {{with his}} friend Jack McEnany, was {{published}} by Villard/Random House on October 18, 2005. Miller also became the first American alpine skier since Tommy Moe to endorse a video game when Bode Miller Alpine Racing was released for mobile phones on January 30, 2006, followed by Bode Miller Alpine Skiing for PlayStation 2 and Windows. [...] In 2006 Miller {{was the subject of}} a biographical film produced by the Coruway Film Institute, Flying Downhill, which looks at the people and the place Miller comes from, and where exactly each fits within his philosophy.|$|E
2500|$|Mussolini was {{an admirer}} of Friedrich Nietzsche. According to Denis Mack Smith, [...] "In Nietzsche he found {{justification}} for his crusade against the Christian virtues of humility, resignation, charity, and goodness." [...] He valued Nietzsche's concept of the superman, [...] "The supreme egoist who defied both God and the masses, who despised egalitarianism and democracy, who believed in the weakest going {{to the wall and}} pushing them if they did not <b>go</b> <b>fast</b> enough." [...] On his 60th birthday, Mussolini received a gift from Hitler of a complete twenty-four volume set of the works of Nietzsche.|$|E
2500|$|Miller first gained {{widespread}} recognition {{after winning}} two silver medals at the 2002 Salt Lake City Winter Olympics in the giant slalom and combined events, {{though he had}} been known to skiing fans since he burst onto the international scene as an 18-year-old in 1996. Miller is known for his reckless style, often risking crashes to increase his chances of winning a given race; in his book, Bode: <b>Go</b> <b>Fast,</b> Be Good, Have Fun, Miller stated that his goal as a skier was not to win medals, but rather to ski [...] "as fast as the natural universe will allow." [...] In 2006, Miller also became famous for his reclusive (but outspoken) personality and his attention-getting statements.|$|E

2500|$|The jekt {{was used}} as a freight vessel along the Norwegian coast from around the 17th century and until the early 20th century, when the use {{steadily}} declined. The vessel type was built from Hardanger in the south to Beiarn in the north. At most around 200 jekts sailed from Northern Norway to Bergen with stockfish. The jekt had a distinct appearance and was a sturdy freighter with a large capacity for cargo. Under good conditions the voyage could <b>go</b> <b>fast,</b> there are stories about voyages from Lofoten to Bergen in around three days, which makes a speed around 8 knots.

[...] "Our ardor had cooled a little by the time we got to drive the cars— then we went nuts all over again.
