5|$|A {{graduate}} of Ringgold High School and the University of Maryland, Zolak was selected 84th in the 1991 NFL Draft by the New England Patriots. He {{did not play}} in 1991, but started four games in 1992 and had his most productive season statistically. When Drew Bledsoe was drafted in 1993, Zolak became his backup {{for the next six}} seasons. He appeared as a replacement for Bledsoe when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>hurt,</b> but only started three games during this time. He was released {{at the end of the}} 1998 season, and signed with the New York Jets and Miami Dolphins in 1999, playing in one game for Miami before retiring. After his retirement, he became a sportscaster and football analyst in the New England area.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{before the}} Second World War, MacLaren's wife {{inherited}} {{a large sum}} of money which enabled them to live in comfort. They bought an estate on which MacLaren had a house built, and the couple were able {{to live in the}} extravagant manner he had always wanted. Around this time, on a visit to America, MacLaren made a brief appearance in the Hollywood film The Four Feathers, which starred his friend, former cricketer C. Aubrey Smith. In the 1940s, his health began to fail. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>hurt</b> in a car crash and then contracted cancer. He died on 17 November 1944, aged 72; his wife died a few months later.|$|E
5|$|The Brooklyn native {{began the}} busier fighter, using the jab {{and trying to}} land uppercuts {{for the first two}} rounds, while Matthysse worked on the body. In round three, a clash of heads opened a cut outside of the left eye of Judah. Matthysse {{displayed}} more aggression and became the aggressor in the third and the fourth round and Judah switched to a defensive tactic. In the next two rounds, the American boxer picked up the pace, beginning to land more combinations. The seventh round was less active but in the eight, Judah landed some hard right counter shots. Judah continued to box throughout the ninth round but Matthysse began to show more power in the tenth, focusing on the head of his opponent and knocking down the American boxer after a hard right hand to the jaw. Judah got up but <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>hurt,</b> and the Argentine fighter tried to press the attack after the knockdown. However, Judah held and worked on the defensive and managed to finish the bout. Two judges scored the fight 114–113 for Judah, while the other judge scored it 114–113 for Matthysse.|$|E

25|$|In 1992, Khadr {{sustained}} severe shrapnel wounds which tore apart {{his right}} side, puncturing his bladder and a kidney. The exact {{cause of the}} wounds is debated, Human Concern International maintains that Khadr was inside one of their refugee camps when he stepped on a landmine, while his son Abdurahman has said that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>hurt</b> by a bomb during the ongoing battles between warlords.|$|E
25|$|Despite a {{successful}} acting and singing career, Einstein considered himself shy and a homebody. In {{one of his}} songs he sang that his greatest pleasure was staying home {{with a cup of}} lemon tea and his books, and in this he was sincere. In a candid TV interview he said that performing in front of big crowds was difficult for him (without the help of a few glugs of cognac beforehand). For this reason he ceased to perform public concerts after 1981, despite many attractive offers which in the late 1990s even reached seven figures. In 1982 <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>hurt</b> in a major car accident. His wife was also hurt, and another friend lost her life. Following the accident Einstein's eyesight, which was already myopic, got worse and he spent less time in public.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} courageous efforts at the SCG was John Sattler's {{performance}} in the 1970 grand final between South Sydney and the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles. In the first ten minutes of the game, South's captain Sattler had his jaw broken by a punch from Manly forward John Bucknall in an off-the-ball incident. Sattler went down but pulled himself up on teammate Michael Cleary, asking the winger to help him so that the other players would not know <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>hurt.</b> In an act of supreme courage Sattler played on, refusing treatment at half time and pleas from teammates {{not to take the}} field again, to lead Souths to a famous 23–12 win. It was not until well after the game that he went to hospital. The Australian side to tour Britain was selected that night and, but for his injury, Sattler would have been picked as captain.|$|E

25|$|After {{facing a}} {{relatively}} low level of opposition for his first 17 fights in Argentina, Martínez fought overseas for the first time, travelling to the United States to face Antonio Margarito on the undercard to the first Érik Morales vs Marco Antonio Barrera bout. The fight took place on 19 February 2000 at the Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas. The contest started badly for Martínez as Margarito scored a knockdown in the first round. Although Martínez recovered and had some success in the early rounds, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>hurt</b> {{by a number of}} punches in round seven leading to a stoppage by the referee, thus handing Martínez his first loss. Following the Margarito fight, Martínez returned to Argentina and fought eight times, all victories, from April 2000 – February 2002. During this run of fights he won the Argentina welterweight title after outpointing Javier Alejandro Blanco. He successfully defended the title once, knocking out Sergio Ernesto Acuna in the seventh round, before being stripped of the title.|$|E
25|$|Andy Hug's eight fight win streak {{was brought}} to an end by then-two-time K-1 Grand Prix {{champion}} Peter Aerts {{in the first of}} their four meetings at K-1 Kings '97 on March 16, 1997. Soundly beaten inside the opening stanza, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>hurt</b> by Aerts' right hand a number of times before being put away with a combination of an uppercut and a knee. He then fought to a five-round split draw with Sam Greco at K-1 Braves '97 on April 29, 1997 before having his fourth and final battle with Mike Bernardo in his first WKA world super heavyweight title defence on June 7, 1997 at K-1 Fight Night '97 in Zurich. Bernardo registered a knockdown of Hug with a powerful left hook at the end of round two but it was not enough as Hug took the unanimous decision in the only fight of their 2-2 series to go the distance.|$|E
500|$|Regarding the {{resolution}} of the character at season four and dropping of Kartheiser from regular cast, Minear says that they had an idea at the conception of teenage Connor that he would only last a season, and [...] "it was time to end the character's story". But, they changed his original [...] "violent, morbid" [...] sendoff to a relatively happy one, citing their likability of actor and character as the reason. Also it was [...] "nice to give someone a happy ending for once." [...] Kartheiser was satisfied with the sendoff, particularly because the issue between Angel and Connor was confronted: [...] That to me is the soul of the character. The name of the show is Angel so it all comes back to him. For Connor, everything stems from this place with Angel and Holtz, and when we got the opportunity for him to let that out, I think he came out of his tough shell and showed a little bit of his sensitivity. He showed that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>hurt</b> by his father and that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>hurt</b> by Holtz. The last scene of Angel watching memory-wiped Connor dine with his new family and slipping away quietly was Whedon's idea, derived from 1937's classic movie Stella Dallas: [...] "I've given up my child. I see my child is happy, and does not know me, and I'm happy. That is the thing that made Stella Darlas the greatest, the thing that made this episode work." ...|$|E

500|$|The Democrats {{nominated}} Senator Silas Wright {{as their}} gubernatorial candidate, and former Tennessee governor James K. Polk for president. [...] Although Fillmore worked to gain support among German-Americans, a major constituency, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>hurt</b> among immigrants {{by the fact}} that New York City Whigs had supported a nativist candidate in the mayoral election earlier in 1844 Fillmore and his party were tarred with that brush. He was not friendly to immigrants, and after his defeat blamed it on [...] "foreign Catholics". Clay was beaten as well. [...] Fillmore's biographer Paul Finkelman suggested that the hostility to immigrants and weak position on slavery defeated him for governor.|$|E
500|$|Friday's {{technical}} ability made him very popular among Reading supporters and pressmen alike. The Reading Evening Post report of Reading's 4–1 victory over Exeter City on 10 February 1974, Friday's first match as a professional, described his performance as [...] "sheer magic" [...] as he scored twice. The report also called Friday's first {{goal of the}} day [...] "glorious": he collected the ball wide on the left wing, took it past four Exeter defenders and then fired the ball low and hard into the opposite corner {{from the edge of}} the penalty area. Friday was conspicuous in the professional ranks for never wearing shin pads, and for his resistance to physical harm; no matter how badly <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>hurt</b> he would always get up and continue.|$|E
500|$|After the season, Ross {{resigned}} as head coach. He expressed frustration over the university's failure to improve Byrd Stadium {{and its associated}} facilities. Ross had shown recruits stadium and facility renovation plans {{as an indication of}} the program's direction, and when they did not come to fruition, he felt that he had misled the players. Ross also stated that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>hurt</b> by [...] "innuendo, insinuation, and guilt by association" [...] with respect to the cocaine-induced death of Maryland basketball star Len Bias. He said, [...] "I feel the football team has represented the university well, {{both on and off the}} field." [...] The athletics department investigation report had commended the propriety of the football program, but university chancellor John B. Slaughter did not offer his vocal support for Ross until a month later.|$|E

500|$|Cardus {{was not an}} [...] "establishment" [...] figure. His friends {{encountered}} initial resistance {{when they}} sought his election to the MCC, although he was eventually accepted in 1958. He was denied the civic honour of the Freedom of the City of Manchester, and although he made light of this omission <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>hurt</b> by it. Long after his death, the city named a pathway close to the rebuilt Summer Place [...] "Neville Cardus Walk". Aside from formal institutional recognition, Cardus was highly regarded by prominent individual cricketers and musicians, {{as indicated by the}} [...] "tribute book" [...] he received at his 70th birthday celebration lunch. The book included contributions from Wilfred Rhodes, Jack Hobbs and Len Hutton, and also from Klemperer, Elisabeth Schwarzkopf and Bruno Walter. He managed to maintain close friendships with both Beecham and Sir John Barbirolli, though the two conductors cordially disliked one another.|$|E
500|$|At the {{beginning}} of July, Gilligan played for the Gentlemen against the Players at the Oval. In the first innings, he was struck heavily over his heart by a delivery from Frederick Pearson; {{it was obvious that}} <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>hurt,</b> and he was out shortly afterwards. Although the Gentlemen v Players match at the Oval was less prestigious than its Lord's counterpart and generally mattered less to participants, Gilligan chose to bat the next day and scored a century batting at number 10. Even so, the Gentlemen lost the game by six wickets. Gilligan was never again as effective a cricketer, and he later conceded that batting in the second innings was a mistake. It is likely that the strain of the innings did as much harm as the original blow, although Gibson later wrote that Gilligan's subsequent long life suggests that he was not too badly hurt, and that it is unlikely too much damage was done. Nevertheless, Gibson concludes [...] "there is no doubt that he was badly shaken up, and whatever the reason, the magic departed".|$|E
500|$|Patton {{arrived at}} the {{hospital}} the same day, accompanied {{by a number of}} medical officers, as part of his tour of the U.S. II Corps troops. He spoke to some patients in the hospital, commending the physically wounded. He then approached Kuhl, who {{did not appear to be}} physically injured. Kuhl was sitting slouched on a stool midway through a tent ward filled with injured soldiers. When Patton asked Kuhl where <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>hurt,</b> Kuhl reportedly shrugged and replied that he was [...] "nervous" [...] rather than wounded, adding, [...] "I guess I can't take it." [...] Patton [...] "immediately flared up," [...] slapped Kuhl across the chin with his gloves, then grabbed him by the collar and dragged him to the tent entrance. He shoved him out of the tent with a kick to his backside. Yelling [...] "Don't admit this son of a bitch", Patton demanded that Kuhl be sent back to the front, adding, [...] "You hear me, you gutless bastard? You're going back to the front." ...|$|E

500|$|Star Trek Into Darkness {{director}} J.J. Abrams {{stated in}} September 2013 that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>hurt</b> by the game's poor reception and quality, {{saying that it}} was [...] "obviously a big disappointment". He also claimed it hurt Star Trek Into Darkness by being released shortly before the film. Later, in November 2013, Digital Extremes creative director Stephen Sinclair said to IGN that he was [...] "kind of surprised [...] to see one of the most awesome, popular and successful film directors working today slagging on that project". Video game insiders linked the poor reception of the game to the departure of Brian Miller in his role as the Senior Vice President of Paramount, as he had been heavily involved in the marketing for the game. Insiders had specifically attributed issues with the game to the [...] "ego" [...] of both Miller and his predecessor Lesinski, [...] "insisted this hallowed and cherished franchise was a key brand extension in the gaming vertical only to be compromised by disastrous results and reviews".|$|E

[...] The car was relatively quick and often qualified in the midfield, Villeneuve even ran in 3rd place in the Spanish Grand Prix for a short while. [...] However the car suffered from chronic unreliability, Villeneuve started the year with 11 straight retirements, and failed to finish a race until the Belgian Grand Prix that August. Zonta missed three races due to an injury and managed only a best finish of 8th.
