40|$|Abstract—Twenty-nine arylisopropylamines, {{substituted}} at the b-position {{of their}} side chain by an oxo, hydroxy, or methoxy group, were evaluated in vitro as MAO-A and MAO-B inhibitors.

50|$|Seeing as six member {{rings are}} {{routinely}} enlarged by the TDR, {{one might expect}} the reaction to occur. However instead of the anticipated ring enlargements, only diols are seen as products. Interestingly enough, five member analogues to the above substituted reagents enlarge under TDR conditions. Alkyl substitutions as opposed to <b>aryl</b> <b>substitutions</b> result in diminished TDRs. Smith and Baer assert that these observations support their mechanism. Since substitution stabilizes the carbonium ion after daminification, the resulting carbonium ion {{is more likely to}} react with a nucleophile present (water in this case) and not undergo rearrangement. Five member rings rearrange due to the ring strain encouraging the maneuver. This strain makes the carbocation unstable enough to cause a carbon to shift.|$|R

To address the BET selectivity issue, X-ray crystal structures of the lead compound bound to the CREB binding protein (CBP) and the first bromodomain of BRD 4 (BRD 4 (1)) were used to guide the design of more selective compounds.
