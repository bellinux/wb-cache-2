40|$|Enclosing objects <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hand</b> is {{a common}} and {{efficient}} way of haptic exploration. Recently, the importance of grasping for more realistic haptic perception of virtual objects has been recognised in haptic interface design. While several studies on haptic perception have addressed haptic exploration of a single object, perception of several objects grasped together <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hand</b> has received almost no attention yet. In this study {{we focus on the}} importance of freedom to manipulate <b>the</b> objects <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hand</b> for three-dimensional shape perception. Furthermore, we investigate differences in detection speed for different positions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> grasping <b>hand.</b> Subjects were asked to search for a cube among spheres or for a sphere among cubes. Response times were measured for different locations of target shape <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hand.</b> Also, <b>the</b> way <b>in</b> which <b>the</b> items were fixed was varied from allowing small displacements and rotation of the shapes to rigidly fixed. There were only differences in search times between <b>the</b> different positions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hand,</b> when <b>the</b> centre item was difficult to access because of the surrounding items. Finally, we show that search was faster when the items were rigidly fixed than when displacement and rotation was possible. This shows that more exploratory freedom does not necessarily make search for a three-dimensional shape faste...|$|R
