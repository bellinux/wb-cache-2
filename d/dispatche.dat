40|$|Background The trauma {{centre of}} the Trauma Center Region North-West Netherlands (TRNWN) has {{consensus}} criteria for Mobile Medical Team (MMT) scene dispatch. The MMT can be dispatched by the EMS-dispatch centre or by the on-scene ambulance crew and is transported by helicopter or ground transport. Although much {{attention has been paid}} to improve the dispatch criteria, the MMT is often cancelled after being dispatched. The aim of this study was to assess the cancellation rate and the noncompliant dispatches of our MMT and to identify factors associated with this form of primary overtriage.

40|$|When the {{function}} of the family does not work adequately, and the value of society is confusing, teachers become important promoters to turn this situation into a clear direction, and their behaviors can deeply influence their students. However, teachers are not isolated individuals left to fight alone or to concentrate only on their own work without having regard with {{what is happening in the}} outside world. They need resources from the sharing of the experience of peers, interaction within a social network, and social support for encouragement. A teacher with well-being can build self-confidence and hold an optimistic attitude and will present his or her best to their students. In addition, principal leadership plays a very important role in the operation of a school, and it will profoundly impact a teacher’s service morale, teaching attitude, and effectiveness. Principal leadership is also a critical factor to decide whether the implementation of school affairs will succeed or not. The study aims to examine the impacts of social support, well-being, principal leadership on teaching effectiveness, the mediating effect of well-being between social support and teaching effectiveness, and the moderating effect of principal leadership between social support and teaching effectiveness. The study uses a questionnaire as the survey method to collect data from Chiayi County elementary school teachers in Taiwan. The authors <b>dispatche...</b>|$|E
40|$|Introduction In The Netherlands {{there is}} no {{consensus}} about criteria for cancelling helicopter emergency medical services (HEMS) dispatches. This study assessed the ability of the primary HEMS dispatch criteria to identify major trauma patients. The predictive power of other early prehospital parameters was evaluated to design a safe triage model for HEMS dispatch cancellations. Methods All trauma-related dispatches of HEMS during a period of 6 months were included. Data concerning prehospital information and inhospital treatment were collected. Patients were divided into two groups (major and minor trauma) according to the following criteria: injury severity score 16 or greater, emergency intervention, intensive care unit admission, or inhospital death. Logistic regression analysis was used to design a prediction model for the early identification of major trauma patients. Results In total, 420 trauma-related dispatches were evaluated, of which 155 concerned major trauma patients. HEMS was more often cancelled for minor trauma patients than for major trauma patients (57. 7 % vs 20. 6 %). Overall, HEMS dispatch criteria had a sensitivity of 87. 7 % and a specificity of 45. 3 % for identifying major trauma patients. Significant differences were found for vital sign abnormalities, anatomical components and several parameters of the mechanism of injury. A triage model designed for cancelling HEMS correctly identified major trauma patients (sensitivity 99. 4 %). Conclusion The accuracy of the current HEMS dispatch criteria is relatively low, resulting in high cancellation rates and low predictability for major trauma. The new HEMS cancellation triage model identified all major trauma patients with an acceptable overtriage and will probably reduce unjustified HEMS <b>dispatche...</b>|$|E
