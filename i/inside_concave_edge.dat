40|$|AbstractThree {{methods are}} {{investigated}} {{to remove the}} concavity at the boundary edges and/or vertices during polyhedral mesh generation by a dual mesh method. The non-manifold elements insertion method is the first method examined. Concavity can be removed by inserting non-manifold surfaces along the <b>concave</b> <b>edges</b> and using them as an internal boundary before applying Delaunay mesh generation. Conical cell decomposition/bisection is the second method examined. Any concave polyhedral cell is decomposed into polygonal conical cells first, with the polygonal primal edge cut-face as the base and the dual vertex on the boundary as the apex. The bisection of the concave polygonal conical cell along the <b>concave</b> <b>edge</b> is done. Finally the cut-along-concave-edge method is examined. Every concave polyhedral cell is cut along the <b>concave</b> <b>edges.</b> If a cut cell is still concave, then it is cut once more. The first method is very promising but not many mesh generators can handle the non-manifold surfaces especially for complex geometries. The second method is applicable to any concave cell with a rather simple procedure but the decomposed cells are too small compared to neighbor non-decomposed cells. Therefore, it may cause some problems during the numerical analysis application. The cut-along-concave-edge method is the most viable method at this time. In this paper, discussions are presented with the boundary conforming Delaunay primal mesh to reduce the complexity that may be expected at the boundary. Polygonal prism mesh generation at the viscous layer is also investigated...|$|R

40|$|We propose an {{approach}} for representing an object by its constituent parts and their spatial connections. The approach {{is based on}} a set of primitive volumes called geons. We utilize the edge-junction graph of an object range image as input. This is a graph whose nodes are the junctions and whose arcs are the edges detected from the range image. The three-dimensional geometrical information at T junctions allows us to group pairs of corresponding T junctions. By following occluding, limb, <b>concave</b> <b>edges</b> and linking pairs of corresponding T junctions, we decompose the edge-junction graph into different subgraphs. Each of these subgraphs then corresponds to a constituent part of the object. For each part, edge curvature and type guide us to an inference regarding the corresponding geon shape. Also, the spatial connections among these parts can be deduced from <b>concave</b> <b>edges</b> and pairs of corresponding T junctions. Finally, the object is described by a directed graph whose nodes represent the part shapes and whose directed arcs represent the spatial connections...|$|R

40|$|Extracellular {{matrices}} in vivo are heterogeneous structures containing gaps that cells {{bridge with}} an actomyosin network. To understand {{the basis of}} bridging, we plated cells on surfaces patterned with fibronectin (FN) -coated stripes separated by non-adhesive regions. Bridges developed large tensions where <b>concave</b> cell <b>edges</b> were anchored to FN by adhesion sites. Actomyosin complexes assembled near those sites (both actin and myosin filaments) and moved towards {{the centre of the}} non-adhesive regions in a treadmilling network. Inhibition of myosin-II (MII) or Rho-kinase collapsed bridges, whereas extension continued over adhesive areas. Inhibition of actin polymerization (latrunculin-A, jasplakinolide) also collapsed the actomyosin network. We suggest that MII has distinct functions at different bridge regions: (1) at the <b>concave</b> <b>edges</b> of bridges, MIIA force stimulates actin filament assembly at adhesions and (2) in the body of bridges, myosin cross-links actin filaments and stimulates actomyosin network healing when breaks occur. Both activities ensure turnover of actin networks needed to maintain stable bridges from one adhesive region to another...|$|R

A primary face is one with multiple boundaries (also called [...] "hole-loops") or mixed concave and convex boundaries. A concave boundary {{is a set of}} <b>concave</b> <b>edges,</b> where the solid angle over the edge is more than 180. Secondary faces are all other faces.

40|$|We {{investigate}} a continuum mechanical model for an adherent cell on two dimensional adhesive micropatterned substrates. The cell is modeled as an isotropic and homogeneous elastic material subject to uniform internal contractile stresses. The build-up of tension from cortical actin bundles at the cell periphery is incorporated by introducing an energy cost for bending {{of the cell}} boundary, resulting to a resistance to changes in local curvature. Integrin-based adhesions are modeled as harmonic springs, that pin the cell to adhesive patches of a predefined geometry. Using Monte Carlo simulations and analytical techniques we investigate the competing effects of bulk contractility and cortical bending rigidity in regulating cell shapes on non-adherent regions. We show that the crossover from convex to <b>concave</b> cell <b>edges</b> {{is controlled by the}} interplay between contractile stresses and boundary bending rigidity. In particular, the cell boundary becomes concave beyond a critical value of the contractile stress that is proportional to the cortical bending rigidity. Furthermore, the intracellular stresses are found largely concentrated at the <b>concave</b> <b>edge</b> of the cell. The model can be used to generate a cell-shape phase diagram for each specific adhesion geometry...|$|R
40|$|During the {{hot-rolling}} {{of aluminium}} ingot into sheet, the material elongates {{in the rolling}} direction as it is reduced vertically. The spread which occurs in the lateral direction during the multiple pass schedules used in industry is minimal. However, the deformation on these edges is important. During the initial passes a concave profile develops - the material near the surfaces spreads outward while the material at the centre moves inward. The concave profile can lead to defects in the final product; these are the 'roll over' of material from the edges {{to the top and}} bottom surfaces, the fold over of material in the centre of the edge, and the formation of vertical edge cracks. To remove these the edges are trimmed {{at the end of the}} process. Research work in this area was motivated by the possibility of identifying means of reducing the amount of material that needs to be trimmed. The objectives of this thesis are to develop techniques of simulating the rolling, and to use these to investigate the deformation mechanisms which lead to the <b>concave</b> <b>edge</b> profile. Models of the rolling were developed using the general purpose, non-linear finite element code ABAQUS. To reproduce the edge profiles accurately requires large three-dimensional models, for which the explicit dynamic method was found to be the most suitable. The results of the analyses were used to investigate the mechanisms which lead to the <b>concave</b> <b>edge</b> profile. In the roll-gap the work-load arches through the ingot; and for roll passes with small reductions a stress pattern occurs which leads to the <b>concave</b> <b>edge</b> profile. In this pattern the stresses of highest magnitude at the surfaces are compressive stresses in the vertical direction, while in the centre of the ingot they are orientated in the rolling direction and are tensile. Thus deformation occurs by vertical compression near the surfaces, and by stretching in the rolling direction at the centre. At the edges the material is not constrained laterally; and due to the Poisson effect, the material spreads outward near the surfaces, and moves inward at the centre. The effect of certain variables on the edge profile were investigated with the modelling. The friction between the work-rolls and the ingot was found to have significant influence on the amount of lateral surface spread. Work hardening, strain rate and temperature effects in the material lead to variations in the yield stress through the height of the ingot. These effects were included in the modelling and were found to affect the shape of the profile, but to a lesser extent than the friction...|$|R
