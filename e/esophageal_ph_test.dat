40|$|OBJECTIVES: <b>Esophageal</b> <b>pH</b> {{monitoring}} using {{a wireless}} pH capsule {{has been suggested}} to generate less adverse symptoms resulting in improved patient acceptance compared with the catheter-based method although evidence to support this assumption is lacking. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate and compare the subjective experience of patients undergoing both techniques for <b>esophageal</b> <b>pH</b> monitoring. METHODS: Using a randomized study design, patients referred for <b>esophageal</b> <b>pH</b> <b>testing</b> underwent both wireless and traditional catheter-based 24 -h pH recording with a 7 -day interval. The wireless pH capsule was placed during endoscopy and followed by 48 -h pH recording. All patients answered a questionnaire, including a 10 -cm visual analog scale (VAS), which described the perceived severity of symptoms and the degree of interference with normal daily activities during the <b>pH</b> <b>tests.</b> RESULTS: Thirty-one patients, 16 women and 15 men, were included in the analysis. The severity of all adverse symptoms associated with the wireless technique was significantly lower compared with the catheter-based technique (median VAS 2. 1 vs 5. 1, P < 0. 001). Wireless pH recording was associated with less interference with off-work activities and normal daily life, median VAS 0. 6 and 0. 7 compared with 5. 0 and 5. 7, respectively, for the catheter-based technique (P < 0. 001). Patients actively working during both tests reported less interference with normal work during the capsule-based test than during the catheter-based <b>pH</b> <b>test</b> (median VAS 0. 3 vs 6. 8, P = 0. 005). Twenty-seven patients (87 %) stated that, if they had to undergo <b>esophageal</b> <b>pH</b> monitoring again, they preferred the wireless test over the catheter-based <b>pH</b> <b>test</b> (P < 0. 0001). CONCLUSIONS: This randomized study showed that a significant majority of patients undergoing <b>esophageal</b> <b>pH</b> monitoring preferred the wireless pH capsule over the traditional catheter-based technique because of less adverse symptoms and less interference with normal daily life...|$|R
40|$|CONTEXT: Helicobacter pylori {{has been}} {{associated}} with worsening of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of H. pylori eradication in GERD patients. METHODS: We conducted a prospective, randomized, controlled trial performing symptom evaluation, endoscopy, histology, manometry and <b>esophageal</b> <b>pH</b> <b>testing</b> on GERD patients. Patients infected with H. pylori were randomized to: 1) eradication treatment plus proton pump inhibitors treatment, or 2) proton pump inhibitors alone. Patients not infected constituted a negative control group. After 3 months, patients were re-evaluated by symptom assessment, endoscopy, histology and manometry. RESULTS: GERD treatment resulted in significantly higher lower esophageal sphincter pressure, as measured by mean expiratory pressure, in H. pylori negative patients. There was significantly lower proportion of hypotensive waves and significantly higher proportion of normotensive waves in non-eradicated patients. All symptom scores were significantly reduced in the post-treatment period compared to baseline, to values that were similar among the three groups, in the post-treatment period. In the post-treatment period, erosive esophagitis was significantly less frequent on those not eradicated. CONCLUSION: Manometric, clinical and endoscopic data showed no benefit in eradicating H. pylori in GERD. Our data supports the hypothesis that H. pylori eradication does not influence GERD...|$|R
40|$|Background. Gastroesophageal reflux {{disease is}} a common {{condition}} with increasing prevalence worldwide. The disease encompasses {{a broad spectrum of}} clinical symptoms and disorders from simple heartburn without esophagitis to erosive esophagitis with severe complications, such as esophageal strictures and intestinal metaplasia. Diagnosis is based mainly on ambulatory <b>esophageal</b> <b>pH</b> <b>testing</b> and endoscopy. There has been a long-standing debate about the best treatment approach for this troublesome disease. Methods and Results. Medical treatment with PPIs has an excellent efficacy in reversing the symptoms of GERD, but they should be taken for life, and long-term side effects do exist. However, patients who desire a permanent cure and have severe complications or cannot tolerate long-term treatment with PPIs are candidates for surgical treatment. Laparoscopic antireflux surgery achieves a significant symptom control, increased patient satisfaction, and complete withdrawal of antireflux medications, in the majority of patients. Conclusion. Surgical treatment should be reserved mainly for young patients seeking permanent results. However, the choice of the treatment schedule should be individualized for every patient. It is up to the patient, the physician and the surgeon to decide the best treatment option for individual cases. Copyright © 2009 Theodore Liakakos et al.

40|$|BACKGROUND/AIMS: All methods {{currently}} used {{to quantify the}} temporal relationships between symptoms and episodes of gastroesophageal reflux, as assessed by 24 -hour pH monitoring, have major shortcomings. The {{aim of this study}} was to develop and validate a simple, all-comprising statistical method to calculate the probability that gastroesophageal reflux episodes and symptoms are associated. METHODS: The 24 -hour pH signal was divided into consecutive 2 -minute periods. These periods and the 2 -minute periods preceding the onset of symptoms were evaluated for the occurrence of reflux. Fisher's Exact Test was then applied to calculate the probability (P value) that reflux and symptom episodes were unrelated. Finally, the symptom-association probability (SAP) was calculated as (1. 0 - P) x 100 %. The SAP values found in 184 24 -hour <b>esophageal</b> <b>pH</b> <b>tests</b> were compared with the symptom index and the symptom sensitivity index. RESULTS: Discordance between the SAP and the symptom index was found in 21 patients (11 %) and discordance between the SAP and the symptom-sensitivity index in 28 (15 %). False-positive and false-negative symptom index values occurred preferentially in patients with small and large numbers of symptom episodes during the test, respectively (P < 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: The SAP is a single, simple, quantitative measure of the strength of the association between symptoms and reflux episodes that is devoid of the disadvantages inherent to previously used method...|$|R

40|$|AbstractEosinophilic {{bronchitis}} is {{a recently}} described condition {{in patients with}} chronic cough, sputum eosinophilia, normal spirometry and no evidence of bronchial hyperreactivity. The aim {{of the study was}} to assess the causes of chronic cough and to identify the prevalence of eosinophilic bronchitis as a cause of chronic cough. Thirty-six patients [mean age 45. 4 ± 14. 3 years (range 16 – 69 years), M/F: 4 / 32] with an isolated chronic cough lasting for more than 4 weeks were recruited from the outpatient clinic. In all patients, after a full history and physical examination, blood eosinophil count, eosinophilic cationic protein (ECP), serum total and specific IgE levels were measured. Spirometry, methacholine provocation test, skin prick tests, ear, nose and throat examination, induction of sputum and <b>esophageal</b> <b>pH</b> <b>testing</b> were performed. The mean duration of cough was 31. 3 ± 52. 3 months. Sputum eosinophilia greater than 3 % was present in 12 (33. 3 %) patients and they were diagnosed as eosinophilic bronchitis. Their induced sputum had a mean eosinophil count of 8. 3 % and a mean ECP level of 98. 5 mg. l−- 1, which were higher than the others (P= 0. 003, both). The diagnosis of the remaining patients were postnasal drip syndrome in eight, gastroesophageal reflux disease in eight, post-infectious cough in two and cough-variant asthma in one patient. In conclusion, eosinophilic bronchitis is an important cause of chronic cough and should be considered in the assessment of patients before regarding them as having idiopathic chronic cough...|$|R
40|$|Ten {{infants who}} {{were less than}} nine months of age and had chronic nonbilious {{vomiting}} were evaluated for gastroesophageal reflux. Upper gastrointestinal series in all showed delayed gastric emptying, a funnel-shaped antrum, absent antral peristalsis, and gastroesophageal reflux. None had evidence of anatomic obstruction in the stomach or duodenum. Manometric studies of the esophagus revealed either normal (4 patients) or elevated (6 patients) lower esophageal sphincter pressures. One-hour <b>esophageal</b> <b>pH</b> probe <b>tests</b> were negative in seven of the ten infants. This obstruction to gastric emptying appears to represent a disorder of antral motility. Medical management, which consisted of small frequent feedings and postural therapy, was successful in six of the infants. The remaining four patients required pyloroplasty. All of the infants are now asymptomatic and gaining weight at either a normal or accelerated rate for their ages. Familiarity with this previously undescribed disorder should prevent the incorrect diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux secondary to lower esophageal sphincter incompetence and the resulting inappropriate surgical reconstruction...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Wireless capsule pH-metry (WC) {{is better}} tolerated than {{standard}} nasal pH catheter (SC), but endoscopic placement is expensive. Aims: {{to confirm that}} non-endoscopic peroral manometric placement of WC is as effective and better tolerated than SC and to perform a cost analysis of the available esophageal pH-metry methods. Methods Randomized trial at 2 centers. Patients referred for <b>esophageal</b> <b>pH</b> <b>testing</b> {{were randomly assigned to}} WC with unsedated peroral placement or SC after esophageal manometry (ESM). Primary outcome was overall discomfort with pH-metry. Costs of 3 different pH-metry strategies were analyzed: 1) ESM[*]+[*]SC, 2) ESM[*]+[*]WC and 3) endoscopically placed WC (EGD[*]+[*]WC) using publicly funded health care system perspective. Results 86 patients (mean age 51 [*]±[*] 2 [*]years, 71 % female) were enrolled. Overall discomfort score was less in WC than in SC patients (26 [*]±[*] 4 [*]mm vs 39 [*]±[*] 4 [*]mm VAS, respectively, p[*]=[*] 0. 012) but there were no significant group differences in throat, chest, or overall discomfort during placement. Overall failure rate was 7 % in the SC group vs 12 % in the WC group (p[*]=[*] 0. 71). Per patient costs ($Canadian) were $ 1475 for EGD[*]+[*]WC, $ 1014 for ESM[*]+[*]WC, and $ 906 for ESM[*]+[*]SC. Decreasing the failure rate of ESM[*]+[*]WC from 12 % to 5 % decreased the cost of ESM[*]+[*]WC to $ 991. The ESM[*]+[*]SC and ESM[*]+[*]WC strategies became equivalent when the cost of the WC device was dropped from $ 292 to $ 193. Conclusions Unsedated peroral WC insertion is better tolerated than SC pH-metry both overall and during placement. Although WC is more costly, the extra expense is partially offset when the higher patient and caregiver time costs of SC are considered.

40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} {{the efficacy of}} Stretta procedure with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) based on symptom control, medication changes and oesophagitis grade. METHODS: Ninety patients {{with a history of}} GERD underwent Stretta procedure from June 2007 to March 2010. All patients with GERD diagnosed by the presence of endoscopically evidenced oesophagitis or abnormal <b>esophageal</b> <b>pH</b> <b>testing.</b> We evaluated GERD-health-related quality of life, satisfaction, medication use and endoscopy at baseline, 6, 12 mo after treatment. Complications of the procedure were analyzed. RESULTS: We found that patients experienced significant changes in symptoms of GERD after Stretta procedure. The onset of GERD symptom relief was less than 2 mo (70. 0 %) or 2 to 6 mo (16. 7 %). The mean GERD-HRQL score was 25. 6 (baseline), 7. 3 (6 mo, P < 0. 01), and 8. 1 (12 mo, P < 0. 01). The mean heartburn score was 3. 3 (baseline), and 1. 2 (12 mo, P < 0. 05). The percentage of patients with satisfactory GERD control improved from 31. 1 % at baseline to 86. 7 % after treatment, and patient satisfaction improved from 1. 4 at baseline to 4. 0 at 12 mo (P < 0. 01). Medication usage decreased significantly from 100 % of patients on proton pump inhibitors therapy at baseline to 76. 7 % of patients showing elimination of medications or only as needed use of antacids/H 2 -RA at 12 mo. An improvement in endoscopic grade of oesophagitis was seen in 33 of the 41 patients. All patients had either no erosions or only mild erosive disease (grade A) at 6 mo. CONCLUSION: The experience with Stretta procedure confirms that it is well tolerated, safe, effective and durable in the treatment of GERD.

40|$|BackgroundLower esophageal {{sphincter}} (LES) {{electrical stimulation}} therapy (EST) {{has been shown}} to improve outcome in gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) patients at 1  year. The aim of this open-label extension trial (NCT 01578642) was to study the 2 -year safety and efficacy of LES-EST in GERD patients. MethodsGERD patients responsive partially to proton pump inhibitors (PPI) with off-PPI GERD health-related quality of life (HRQL) of ≥ 20, 24 -hour esophageal pH ≤ 4. 0 for > 5 % of the time, hiatal hernia ≤ 3  cm, and esophagitis LA grade C or lower participated in this trial. Bipolar stitch electrodes and a pulse generator (EndoStim BV, The Hague, The Netherlands) were implanted laparoscopically. LES-EST at 20  Hz, 215 μs, 3 - 8 mAmp was delivered over 30 -minute sessions, 6 - 12 sessions per day, starting on day 1 after implantation. Patients were evaluated using GERD-HRQL, symptom diaries, Short Form- 12, and <b>esophageal</b> <b>pH</b> <b>testing</b> at regular intervals. Stimulation sessions were optimized based on residual symptoms and <b>esophageal</b> <b>pH</b> at follow-up. ResultsTwenty-five patients (mean age [SD] =  52 [12] years; 14 men) were implanted successfully; 23 patients participated in the 2 -year extension trial, and 21 completed their 2 -year evaluation. At 2  years, there was improvement in their median GERD-HRQL on LES-EST compared with both their on-PPI (9 vs 0; P = . 001) and off-PPI (23. 5 vs 0; P < . 001) baseline scores. Median 24 -hour distal esophageal acid exposure improved from 10 % at baseline to 4 % (per-protocol analysis; P < . 001) at 2  years with 71 % demonstrating either normalization or a ≥ 50 % decrease in their distal esophageal acid exposure. All except 5 patients (16 / 21) reported complete cessation of PPI use; only 2 patients were using a PPI regularly (≥ 50 % of days). There was significant improvement in sleep quality and daily symptoms of heartburn and regurgitation on LES-EST. At baseline, 92 % of the subjects (22 / 24) reported that they were “unsatisfied” with their condition off-PPI and 71 % (17 / 24) on-PPI compared with 0 % (0 / 21) “unsatisfied” at the 24 -month visits on LES-EST. There were no device- or therapy-related serious adverse events and no untoward sensation or dysphagia reported with LES-EST. ConclusionLES-EST is safe and effective for treating patients with GERD over a period of 2  years. LES-EST resulted in a significant and sustained improvement in GERD symptoms, and esophageal acid exposure and eliminated PPI use in majority of patients (16 of 21).

40|$|Introduction: Gastroesophageal reflux {{disease is}} named when {{gastroesophageal}} reflux becomes symptomatic, influences the life comfort, {{and results in}} morbidity. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the patients admitted with GER-associated symptoms with demographic characteristics, 24 -hour <b>esophageal</b> <b>pH</b> monitorization results, and responses to different treatment protocols. Materials and Method: The data of patients who admitted to Uludag University Pediatrics Outpatient Clinic between January 2008 and September 2009 with GERD-associated symptoms and underwent <b>esophageal</b> <b>pH</b> monitorization was collected retrospectively. The associations between initial symptoms, 24 -hour <b>esophageal</b> <b>pH</b> monitorization results, presence of accompanying disease, sociocultural conditions, and therapy responses were evaluated. Results: Ninety-two patients (37 female, 55 male) were included and mean age was 4. 42 ± 4. 33 (1 mo- 18 years). The frequency of cough, vomiting and abdominal pain at admission were 49. 5 %, 47. 3 % and 22 % respectively. <b>Esophageal</b> <b>pH</b> monitorization diagnosed GERD in 21 patients (22. 8 %). The frequency of symptoms in GERD patients who diagnosed with <b>esophageal</b> <b>pH</b> monitorization was; cough (n: 15, 33. 4 %), vomiting (n: 11, 25. 6 %), and abdominal pain (n: 5, 22. 3 %). Among all complaints, cough {{was found to be}} significantly associated with GERD (p= 0. 041). Accompanying neurological disease was present in 13. 1 % (n: 12), immunodeficiency 13. 1 % (n: 12) and bronchial reactivity 13. 1 % (n: 12). Therapy success was achieved in 57. 7 % of patients. Therapy response were similar with different therapy protocols (proton pump inhibitor+prokinetic+sucralfate, proton pump inhibitor+prokinetic, H 2 receptor blocker+sucralfate, proton pump inhibitor+sucralfate, H 2 receptor blocker+ prokinetic, monotherapy with proton pump inhibitor or H 2 receptor blocker) (p= 0. 068).

Results The prevalence of each reflux and dyspeptic symptom did not differ significantly between patients with positive and negative <b>pH</b> <b>tests.</b> After the PPI treatment, epigastric burning, acid regurgitation, heartburn, nausea, vomiting and chest discomfort scores were significantly improved compared to pretreatment values (P < 0. 05), whereas postprandial abdominal fullness, early satiation, belching and food regurgitation were not. The proportion of patients who responded to the PPI treatment did not differ significantly between patients with positive and negative <b>pH</b> <b>tests.</b> The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV and accuracy of 2 -week high dose rabeprazole treatment for diagnosing gastroesophageal reflux disease were 47 %, 38 %, 50 %, 35 % and 43 %, respectively...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To present {{indications}} {{and results}} of prolonged <b>esophageal</b> <b>pH</b> monitoring in diagnosing pathologic gastroesophageal reflux in newborns during their {{stay in the}} neonatal unit. METHODS: This retrospective descriptive-analytical study of 85 prolonged <b>esophageal</b> <b>pH</b> monitoring in neonates was performed, between October 1995 and March 1998, in a tertiary intensive care unity. A Digitrapper MKIII device, pH probes {{with one or two}} channels, and antimony electrodes were utilized. The probe was placed 3 cm above the gastroesophageal junction. RESULTS: The main indications of this <b>esophageal</b> <b>pH</b> study were hypoxemia episodes demanding supplemental oxygen, and caffeine resistant apnea. The means -/+ SD of birth-weight and gestational age in the patients evaluated were, respectively, 1, 204 -/+ 460 g and 30. 5 -/+ 2. 9 weeks. There was no statistical difference observed in newborns with and without pathologic gastroesophageal reflux according to clinical manifestations and monitoring conditions. Forty-eight newborns (56. 4 %) presented 17. 6 -/+ 9. 1 % of the whole examination time with a pH below 4. Of these patients, 31. 1 % presented birth-weight below 1, 000 g. Duodenogastroesophagic was diagnosed in two cases. Of the studied premature with chronic lung disease, 66. 7 % presented pathologic reflux. CONCLUSION: Prolonged <b>pH</b> <b>esophageal</b> monitoring is helpful in the differential diagnosis of the unspecific and very frequent clinic manifestations in very low birth-weight infants...|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{assess the}} {{occurrence}} of gastric acid reflux into the esophagus in endoscopically confirmed prolapse gastropathy syndrome (PGS). METHODS: Using ambulatory <b>esophageal</b> <b>pH</b> measurement (BRAVOTM wireless <b>esophageal</b> <b>pH</b> monitoring system), twenty-six patients with PGS were compared with twenty-one patients with erosive esophagitis (EE) as controls. We assessed several reflux parameters, including the percentage of total time at pH 5 min, the total time with pH 14. 72), there was {{no statistically significant difference}} between the two groups in the incidence of pathologic acid reflux (P = 0. 11). CONCLUSION: There was no statistically significant difference in pathologic acid reflux between the PGS and EE group. These data suggest that endoscopically diagnosed PGS might be a predictor of pathologic acid reflux...|$|R
40|$|AIM: To study {{a cohort}} of {{patients}} undergoing 48 h Bravo <b>pH</b> <b>testing</b> receiving deep sedation with propofol. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the charts of 197 patients (81 male, 116 female) who underwent Bravo <b>esophageal</b> <b>pH</b> monitoring from July 2003 to January 2008. All patients underwent Bravo pH probe placement via esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and received propofol for sedation. Patients on a proton pump inhibitor (89 patients) were excluded. Acid reflux variables measured included the total, upright, and supine fractions of time at pH < 4 and DeMeester score, and were compared between day 1 and day 2. RESULTS: Of the 108 patients that {{were included in the}} study, the most common indication for Bravo pH monitoring was heartburn, with chest pain being the second most common. A signed rank test revealed no statistically significant difference between day 1 and day 2 reflux episodes.

40|$|Acid reflux and/or {{esophagitis}} may {{be responsible}} for inconsolable crying in infants. We evaluated prospectively the presence of occult acid reflux disease, esophagitis and the accuracy of pH monitoring in the prediction of esophagitis in a population of distressed infants. A 24 -hour <b>esophageal</b> <b>pH</b> monitoring with an antimony electrode and an upper gastro-intestinal tract endoscopy with grasp biopsies were performed on 60 distressed infants, aged 1 to 6 months, after failure of a cow's milk elimination diet. A 24 -hour <b>esophageal</b> <b>pH</b> monitoring was considered abnormal (> 5 % of investigation time with a pH 5 % in 10 (38 %). Histology of the esophagus was normal in 10 (50 %) children with an abnormal pH monitoring. The mean reflux index was similar in the group with (4. 66 %) and without esophagitis (5. 00) (p=NS). The sensitivity and specificity to predict esophagitis with a reflux index of 5. 0 % or more was 38. 5 and 70. 6, respectively. There was not a reflux index that could be related to a clinical useful sensitivity and specificity to predict esophagitis. Acid gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GER) and/or histological esophagitis were diagnosed in 33 % and 43 % of distressed infants, respectively. The reflux index does not accurately predict esophagitis and normal histology does not accurately exclude acid gastro-esophageal reflux disease. <b>Esophageal</b> <b>pH</b> monitoring and endoscopy provide additional information.
