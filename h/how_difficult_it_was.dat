5|$|A {{television}} {{broadcast of the}} concert, titled Madonna: The MDNA Tour, aired on Epix in the United States on June 22, 2013. The concert premiered at 8 p.m. EST on Epix's TV network and online at EpixHD.com and on Epix apps. On June 18, the concert special had a world premiere screening at The Paris Theater, in New York City, with Madonna attending the event {{in a press conference}} with the media, celebrities, and fans. A contest was released just for US residents, who had the chance to win two invitations for the special event. The singer wore a black tuxedo and a top hat to the premiere, the ensemble being a tribute to actress Marlene Dietrich and her similar attire in the 1930 film, Morocco. During the Q, Madonna recalled <b>how</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> to sometimes perform on the tour, but she and her troupe nevertheless did it. At the end of the session, she showed a trailer from her secretprojectrevolution film with photographer Steven Klein; the one-minute clip featured her background dancers and showed the singer being dragged on the floor. Other shots included Madonna wielding a gun, her dancers in underwear, and religious iconography.|$|E

Through Cal, scholar Angela Pattatucci Aragon stated, Eugenides opines that the 1876 system devised by Edwin Klebs that used gonad tissue to determine sex provides the most accurate answer.|$|E

[...] Mouly researched the role comics could play in promoting literacy in young children, and encouraged publishers to publish comics for children. [...] Disappointed by publishers' lack of response, from 2008 she self-published a line of easy readers called Toon Books, by artists such as Spiegelman, Renée French, and Rutu Modan, and promotes the books to teachers and librarians for their educational value. [...] The imprint provides support materials for teachers tied into the Common Core State Standards Initiative.

500|$|The first {{mention of}} a bishop in Finland is from a papal letter in 1209. It was sent to Archbishop Anders of Lund by Pope Innocent III as a reply to the Archbishop's earlier letter which has not survived. According to the Archbishop, the Bishop of the newly {{established}} church in Finland was dead, apparently from natural causes since his passing away is mentioned to have been [...] "lawful", and the see had been vacant for some time. The Archbishop had complained to the Pope <b>how</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> to get anyone to be a bishop in Finland and planned to appoint someone without formal adequacy, who was already working in Finland. The Pope approved of Archbishop's suggestion without questioning his opinions. It is noteworthy that the Archbishop of Uppsala, Valerius (1207–1219/1224), was also in Denmark at the time, temporarily exiled from Sweden after having allied with the deposed King Sverker, yet another exile in Denmark.|$|E

It was very hard for a girl photographer in the 60s {{to be accepted}}. In the end I gave up. I've hardly taken a photo since 1967." [...] Kirchherr was quoted as saying that When We Was Fab (Genesis Publications 2007), would be her last book of photographs: [...] "I have decided it is time to create one book in which I am totally involved so that it contains the pictures I like most, printed the way I would print them, even down to the text and design....

GQ magazine describes a typical customer as having spent weeks trying to get past the always full answering machine that serves as Schwa's primary reservation system.

One couple got so frustrated with the system that they drove down to the restaurant to make a reservation in person. Upon arrival, they were told they had to call it in. Despite their frustration, the couple kept trying and when they finally got in they remarked, [...] "You know what? It was worth it." [...] According to Carlson, most customers' first comment when they arrive at Schwa is either to complain about <b>how</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> to get a reservation or to ask for another one. Schwa will not seat customers without a reservation, even if the restaurant is empty.|$|E

500|$|Johnson {{also contributed}} {{significantly}} to children's literature. His publication of Barbauld's Lessons for Children (1778–79) spawned {{a revolution in the}} newly emerging genre. Its plain style, mother-child dialogues, and conversational tone inspired a generation of authors, such as Sarah Trimmer. Johnson encouraged other women to write in this genre, such as Charlotte Smith, but his recommendation always came with a caveat of <b>how</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> to write well for children. For example, he wrote to Smith, [...] "perhaps you cannot employ your time and extraordinary talents more usefully for the public & your self , than in composing books for children and young people, but I am very sensible it is extreamly [...] difficult to acquire that simplicity of style which is their great recommendation". He also advised William Godwin and his second wife, Mary Jane Clairmont, on the publication of their Juvenile Library (started in 1805). Not only did Johnson encourage the writing of British children's literature, but he also helped sponsor the translation and publication of popular French works such as Arnaud Berquin's [...] (1782–83).|$|E
500|$|Raimi and {{the studio}} clashed {{several times during}} production. The first {{disagreement}} between the director and the executives stemmed from the latter's insistence on casting a [...] "Hollywood" [...] actor in the lead role instead of Raimi's long-time collaborator and friend Campbell. In his 2002 autobiography If Chins Could Kill: Confessions of a B Movie Actor, Campbell commented about <b>how</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> working with more established producers; [...] "jumping into the big time meant dealing with the excruciatingly specific and alternately vague demands of a studio,... Hollywood executives {{took an interest in}} everything." [...] Campbell was surprised that he had to audition for the lead role, as {{he did not have to}} test for The Evil Dead. [...] Campbell and his photographer friend Mike Ditz used a 16 mm film camera and shot a scene to show to the producers. Upon viewing it, the producers asserted that [...] "Campbell will not star in this film". [...] In retaliation, Raimi lengthened a supporting role and gave it to Campbell: the character of Renaldo [...] "The Heel". This allowed for Campbell to be present through the production.|$|E
500|$|Following The Inside, Nichols {{found work}} on the fifth season of the serial action series Alias in 2005, being cast that July. Nichols starred as Rachel Gibson, a {{computer}} expert who thought she {{was working for the}} CIA when in fact she was working for a dangerous terrorist organization—a situation {{similar to that of the}} series' main character Sydney Bristow (Jennifer Garner) in the first season. Discovering the truth, Gibson joins the real CIA and becomes Bristow's protégée. Of working on Alias, Nichols said that [...] "to say it's the nicest set on the planet is an understatement". Her role involved multiple fight sequences, as did Garner's. Nichols worked with Garner's personal trainer; she said she [...] "already knew that [...] job was extremely hard. But I didn't know <b>how</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> until I started training for just one fight." [...] Nichols was being groomed to replace Garner as the main character due to the latter's pregnancy, which had been written into the storyline. But Alias was canceled in November 2005, making its fifth season its final. [...] "I think everybody knew that the show wouldn't work without Jennifer", Nichols said, [...] "But still, they were grooming me, so it was heartbreaking when it happened." ...|$|E

500|$|A Famitsu writer {{said that}} they enjoyed solving puzzles, and that it gave {{them a sense of}} accomplishment; similarly, Goergen, Petit, Schilling and Arendt called the puzzles {{satisfying}} to solve. Goergen found some puzzles to be cleverly done, but said that some were esoteric. Ponce and Petit liked that the puzzles never became [...] "pixel hunts", and how everything is visible as long as the player looks carefully; because of this and the lack of red herrings, time limits and dead ends, Ponce found it to be better than other escape-the-room games. He applauded the large amount of content, saying that even someone only buying the game for the puzzles would be satisfied. Schilling and Thomas appreciated the puzzles, but found some solutions and hints to be too obvious or explanatory. Kemps found the puzzles excellently done and challenging, but disliked <b>how</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> to reach the true ending. Kemps and Schreier appreciated how the puzzles felt logical, while they, along with Thomas and Arendt, criticized how the player has to re-do puzzle sequences upon subsequent playthroughs. Goergen, Schreier, Thomas and Arendt all appreciated the fast-forward function, as it made repeated playthroughs more bearable, but Thomas felt that it didn't go far enough in speeding up the process.|$|E
500|$|In the {{alternate}} timeline, Shannon {{does not go}} back with Boone. In [...] "LA X", Boone goes back alone on Flight 815 and sits beside Locke, where he finds out about Locke supposedly going on a Walkabout in Australia. In a parallel with the island timeline, Boone tells Locke if they crashed, he would follow him. Once the plane lands, Boone shakes Locke's hand and exits the plane. Boone reappears in the final episode of Lost. In [...] "The End", we see Hurley and Sayid talking in a car on a dark street, and they witness a thug beating up a guy (Boone) outside of a bar. Shannon shouts [...] "Leave my brother alone," [...] and Sayid {{gets out of the}} car to intervene. His and Shannon's memories are restored the moment they touch. Boone, having conspired with Hurley to bring Shannon and Sayid together, wanders over to the car. He jokes with Hurley about how he had to take a beating and [...] "thanks for taking your time." [...] He also comments <b>how</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> to get Shannon to return from Australia with him, but he and Hurley agree the effort was worth it for this moment to have her and Sayid's memories restored.

500|$|Upon publication, [...] "Al Aaraaf" [...] and {{the other}} poems in Poe's {{collection}} drew harsh criticism because of <b>how</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> to understand. Among the early reviewers was John Hill Hewitt, who wrote of Poe that [...] "no man has been more shamefully overestimated". In trying to explain the title poem, he wrote, [...] "all our brain-cudgeling could not compel us to understand it line by line or the sum total". A reviewer for the Baltimore Minerva and Emerald asked, [...] "Has the poet been struck dumb with palsy?" [...] Before publication, Poe had sought the advice of William Wirt, who had {{earned a reputation as}} a distinguished man of letters in Baltimore. On [...] "Al Aaraaf", Wirt wrote that he was not the best judge of poetry but believed that it might be accepted by modern-thinking readers. As he wrote, [...] "but to deal candidly... (as I am bound to do) I should doubt whether the poem will take with old-fashioned readers like myself". Sarah Josepha Hale of Godey's Lady's Book noted that [...] "Al Aaraaf" [...] must have been written by a young author because it was [...] "boyish, feeble, and altogether deficient in the common characteristics of poetry". Nevertheless, she still called the author a genius. A reviewer for the American Ladies' Magazine also commented on the poet's age: [...] " [...] author who appears to be very young, is evidently a fine genius, but he wants judgment, experience, tact".|$|E

500|$|Relic Entertainment {{was founded}} in Vancouver, Canada, on June 1, 1997, and began work on Homeworld as their first title. Relic co-founders Alex Garden and Luke Moloney served as the {{director}} and lead programmer for the game, respectively, while Erin Daly was the designer and Aaron Kambeitz the lead artist. Writer David J. Williams is credited with the original story concept, while the script itself was written by Martin Cirulis and the background lore was written by author Arinn Dembo. Cirulis and Dembo, credited jointly as [...] "Marcus Skyler", were selected by the publisher, Sierra Studios, partway through development to expand the story concept of Relic and Williams. Sierra agreed to publish the game early in development based on, according to Garden, [...] "two whiteboard presentations and no demo". The development of the game took over two years; the game systems were largely complete by the final eight months, which Relic spent polishing and improving the game, including adding the whole-map Sensors Manager view. The game was initially expected to be released {{at the end of}} 1998; Garden stated in a 1999 interview that the team found creating the core game itself much easier than getting it to the quality level they wanted, and that if they had known <b>how</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> going to be they may have chosen not to do the project. Several ideas for the game, including ship customization, convoy routes, and different unit types for the Kushan and Taidann fleets were cut during development as they could not be done well enough for the project.|$|E
