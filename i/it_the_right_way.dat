25|$|At the loft, Regina has a {{chat with}} Henry about Emma, and tells him {{that he should be}} proud of his mother for having magic, then heals his ear. Henry mourns {{the fact that he is}} normal and has no special powers, but Regina insists that he {{possesses}} the heart of the truest believer and tells him that he is just as powerful as either one of his mothers, even without magic. Regina then goes downstairs to talk to Mary Margaret and David after overhearing that they believe Emma is doing the right thing in getting rid of her powers. Regina talks them out of it by saying that her powers are part of her and that they are her gift. She insists that she only needs to channel <b>it</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>way</b> and use it to protect the town. The two eventually agree with Regina and as they decide to search again for their daughter, they notice that the locator spell and Emma's scarf missing. Then, they also notice that Elsa is gone.|$|E

If you didn't do <b>it</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>way,</b> he would tear you up, really get you. It was bad. Real bad." [...] Both of Jackson's parents have rejected the longstanding allegations of child abuse by saying that spankings were common when disciplining children back then. The child abuse allegations polarized some of the siblings, with some of them rejecting the claims.|$|E
500|$|Before his {{departure}} from Jive, Big Boi planned {{to release the}} album in 2008. In January 2010, he announced a March 23 release through his Twitter account. In April, its release was pushed back to July 6 in the United States. However, in June, Jive attempted to block its release, claiming that Def Jam could not issue songs featuring both Big Boi and André 3000, as OutKast was represented as a duo by the former label. In a June 7 interview for GQ, Big Boi responded to a question concerning the blocking of his recordings with André 3000 for Sir Lucious Left Foot, stating [...] "Au contraire! They cannot block it. Au contraire. Either they're going to do <b>it</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>way,</b> or they're {{going to do it}} my way... The fans' thirst will be quenched. You know, I'm no stranger to that Internet, baby. So you already know what time it is. The thirst of the fans will be quenched". On June 10, his website released the album's track listing, which excluded tracks featuring André 3000. Of his songs with André 3000, he told GQ, [...] "We're gonna keep one of them for the next OutKast record".|$|E

500|$|Although it {{had been}} {{reported}} for several years that Jackson had an abusive childhood, he first spoke openly {{about it in a}} 1993 interview with Oprah Winfrey. He grimaced when speaking of the childhood abuse at the hands of his father; he stated he had missed out on much of his childhood, admitting that he often cried from loneliness. In the same interview, speaking of his father, Jackson said, [...] "There were times when he'd come to see me, I'd get sick...I'd start to regurgitate. I'm sorry...Please don't be mad at me...But I do love him". In Jackson's other high-profile interview Living with Michael Jackson (2003), he covered his face with his hand and began crying when talking about his childhood abuse. Jackson recalled that Joseph sat in a chair as the group rehearsed, saying, [...] "He had this belt in his hand. If you didn't do <b>it</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>way,</b> he would tear you up, really get you. It was bad. Real bad". When Jackson received his Living Legend award—presented to him by Janet Jackson—at the 1993 Grammys, he said, [...] "I don't read all the things written about me, I wasn't aware the world thought I was so weird and bizarre. But when you grow up like I did in front of 100million people since the age of five, you're automatically different...My childhood was completely taken away from me. There was no Christmas, no birthdays. It was not a normal childhood, no normal pleasures of childhood. Those were exchanged for hard work, struggle and pain, and eventual material and professional success".|$|E
500|$|Jackson had {{a troubled}} {{relationship}} with his father. In 2003, Joe acknowledged that he regularly whipped him as a boy. Joe was also said to have verbally abused his son, often {{saying that he had}} a [...] "fat nose". Jackson stated that he was physically and emotionally abused during incessant rehearsals, though he credited his father's strict discipline with playing a large role in his success. In an interview with Martin Bashir for the 2003 documentary Living with Michael Jackson, Jackson recalled that Joe often sat in a chair with a belt in his hand as he and his siblings rehearsed, and that [...] "if you didn't do <b>it</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>way,</b> he would tear you up, really get you." [...] Jackson's parents have disputed the longstanding allegations of abuse, with Katherine stating that while whipping is considered abuse today, it was a common way to discipline children at the time. Jackie, Tito, Jermaine and Marlon have also said that their father was not abusive and that the whippings, which were harder on Michael because he was younger, kept them disciplined and out of trouble. Speaking openly about his childhood in an interview with Oprah Winfrey broadcast in February 1993, Jackson acknowledged that his youth had been lonely and isolating. His deep dissatisfaction with his appearance, his nightmares and chronic sleep problems, his tendency to remain hyper-compliant, especially with his father, and to remain childlike in adulthood are consistent with the effects of the maltreatment he endured as a child.|$|E

I've known him for years and years. He swore he'd let me make <b>it</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>way.</b>|$|E

2500|$|After {{the album}} and two {{supporting}} tours, Schuldiner put Death aside to pursue Control Denied with Christy and Hamm. Clendenin was dropped {{in favor of}} Steve Di Giorgio, who was once again available, and an underground power metal singer named Tim Aymar. Though the line-up and writing style was largely the same, Schuldiner created Control Denied {{in large part because}} he was displeased with the harsher vocals for Death. However, rather than betray what the band Death meant and sounded like to the fans, he opted to create a new band: [...] "For me, it {{is just a matter of}} evolving, doing <b>it</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>way.</b> I didn't put out a Death record with this stuff on it. I made the right choice and changed the name of the band. I tried to do everything the right way." [...] As Schuldiner finished Control Denied's debut album, he was diagnosed with brain cancer, forcing the band to scrap plans for a U.S. and Canadian tour. As he worked on the second release, Schuldiner's condition improved, but the tumor left him in a weakened, vulnerable state. He contracted pneumonia and was placed in a hospital. On December 13, 2001, Schuldiner was released and returned home an hour later, where he died. His death was exactly three years after Death's final concert.|$|E

The judges scored the bout 115-115, 115-114, 115-114; a majority decision. Groves, who believed he proved many critics wrong, welcomed the idea of a rematch in the future, [...] "I will fight him again.

6000|$|At length she {{put me to}} practice. She {{had shown}} me her art, and I had several times {{unhooked}} a watch from her own side with great dexterity.

She goes {{on one side of the}} lady, and pretends, just as she came to the steps, to fall, and fell against the lady with so much violence as put her into a great fright, and both cried out terribly. In the very moment that she jostled the lady, I had hold of the watch, and holding <b>it</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>way,</b> the start she gave drew the hook out, and she never felt it. I made off immediately, and left my schoolmistress to come out of her pretended fright gradually, and the lady too; and presently the watch was missed.

60|$|I saw him go, on my side, with relief. It {{would be}} more {{interesting}} to learn how our relation seemed to Mapiao. His exigence, we may suppose, was merely loyal.

He had his dinner laid out; watched it, as was fit, the while he worked; ate it at the fit hour; was in all things served and waited on; and could take his hire in the end with a clear conscience, telling himself the mystery was performed duly, the beards rightfully braided, and we (in spite of ourselves) correctly served. His view of our stupidity, even he, the mighty talker, must have lacked language to express. He never interfered with my Tahuku work; civilly praised it, idle as it seemed; civilly supposed that I was competent in my own mystery: such being the attitude of the intelligent and the polite. And we, on the other hand--who had yet the most to gain or lose, since the product was to be ours--who had professed our disability by the very act of hiring him to do it--were never weary of impeding his own more important labours, and sometimes lacked the sense and the civility to refrain from laughter.|$|E
