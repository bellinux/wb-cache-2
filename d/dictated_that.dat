5|$|The Yugoslav {{emphasis}} on anti-aircraft defense meant that Split {{could only have}} a single funnel to allow the guns as much freedom to fire as possible, which <b>dictated</b> <b>that</b> the boiler rooms were adjacent to the engine room. This meant that a single torpedo hit in the machinery spaces could immobilize the ship.|$|E
5|$|In 87, Vestal Virgins {{were found}} to have broken their sacred vows of lifelong public chastity. As the Vestals were {{regarded}} as daughters of the community, this offense essentially constituted incest. Accordingly, those found guilty of any such transgression were condemned to death, either by a manner of their choosing, or according to the ancient fashion, which <b>dictated</b> <b>that</b> Vestals should be buried alive.|$|E
5|$|Several design {{proposals}} were submitted, all calling for heavy main guns, between 30.5cm(12in) and 34.3cm(13.5in) calibers. However, financial limitations <b>dictated</b> <b>that</b> smaller, less expensive weaponry {{would be used}} instead. The final design therefore used the same 28cm(11in) double turret introduced {{for the last two}} s— hydraulic elevated Drh LC/1907 instead of electrical elevated Drh LC/1906. In compensation, the design was given a relatively heavy secondary armament.|$|E

5|$|The teaser poster, {{featuring}} Anakin {{with his}} shadow forming Darth Vader's silhouette, {{was released on}} November 10, 1998. After Lucas opted for a drawn theatrical poster, Drew Struzan, the artist responsible for the Special Edition posters, was commissioned to illustrate, and the poster was unveiled on March 11, 1999. Lucasfilm <b>dictated</b> <b>that,</b> contractually, Struzan's illustration was the only art the foreign distributors could use, and other than the text, {{it could not be}} modified in any way.|$|E

The group was founded and managed by Stephen Toback. Real Adventures maintained the classic show's realistic violence, featuring off-screen deaths of villains and allies. Japan-based Mook Studios exclusively animated the second season without digital post-processing. The show's format <b>dictated</b> <b>that</b> title sequences be aired first, followed by a short introduction, the first act, and the second act, with commercial breaks between.|$|E
5|$|Around 1844, {{she married}} a free black man named John Tubman. Although {{little is known about}} him or their time together, the union was {{complicated}} because of her slave status. Since the mother's status <b>dictated</b> <b>that</b> of children, any children born to Harriet and John would be enslaved. Such blended marriages – free people of color marrying enslaved people – were not uncommon on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, where by this time, half the black population was free. Most African-American families had both free and enslaved members. Larson suggests that they might have planned to buy Tubman's freedom.|$|E

5|$|For {{the first}} {{fifty years after}} 1945, every {{published}} description and drawing of the Little Boy mechanism assumed that a small, solid projectile was fired {{into the center of}} a larger, stationary target. However, critical mass considerations <b>dictated</b> <b>that</b> in Little Boy the larger, hollow piece would be the projectile. The assembled fissile core had more than two critical masses of uranium-235. This required one of the two pieces to have more than one critical mass, with the larger piece avoiding criticality prior to assembly by means of shape and minimal contact with the neutron-reflecting tungsten carbide tamper.|$|E
5|$|The Smuts {{family were}} {{traditional}} Afrikaner farmers. As such, questions {{of property and}} family affairs were extensively governed by custom. Custom <b>dictated</b> <b>that</b> it was upon the first son that family expectations fell; the family would strive, so far as their means allowed, to provide him with the best possible education {{with the goal of}} paving the way for his entry into one of the professions. As for the others, they would be put to work on the farm, {{while at the same time}} receiving a rudimentary home education. As the second son this was to be Jan's role. While he remained at the farm, his elder brother, Michiel, was sent to begin his schooling in Riebeek West, destined, like his uncle Boudewyn, for a future as a predikant in the Dutch Reformed Church.|$|E
5|$|The US Army's basic wartime racial policy, {{established}} in 1937, <b>dictated</b> <b>that</b> both whites and African Americans {{were to be}} inducted into the Army in equal proportions and strength, but that they were to be assigned to segregated units. Black soldiers could be led by white officers, but not vice versa, and unit composition was to be strictly controlled by the War Department. The mix of combat and support service units was, in theory, to be roughly equal between both groups. This caused tension between the Department and operational commanders, with the latter generally unwilling to provide places for black combat units. In practice, almost all combat units in the pre-war period were white.|$|E

Due to the ripeness of the cheese, they remained glued to the wall for the rest of the service.|$|E
5|$|According to oral history, Rainilaiarivony {{was born}} on a {{day of the week}} {{traditionally}} viewed as inauspicious for births. Custom in much of Madagascar <b>dictated</b> <b>that</b> such unlucky children had to be subjected to a trial by ordeal, such as prolonged exposure to the elements, since it was believed the misfortune of their day of birth would ensure a short and cursed life for the child and its family. But rather than leave the child to die, Rainilaiarivony's father reportedly followed the advice of an ombiasy (astrologer) and instead amputated a joint from two fingers on his infant son's left hand to dispel the ill omen. The infant was nonetheless kept outside the house to avert the possibility that evil might still befall the family if the child remained under their roof. Relatives took pity and adopted Rainilaiarivony to raise him within their own home. Meanwhile, Rainilaiarivony's older brother Rainivoninahitriniony enjoyed the double privilege of his status as elder son and freedom from a predestined evil fate. Rainiharo selected and groomed his elder son to follow in his footsteps as Commander-in-Chief and Prime Minister, while Rainilaiarivony was left to make his way in the world by his own merits.|$|E
5|$|After {{being kept}} in the Forbidden City for 27 days of mourning, on 3 March 1661 the emperor's corpse was transported in a lavish {{procession}} to Jingshan 景山 (a hillock {{just north of the}} Forbidden City), after which a large amount of precious goods were burned as funeral offerings. Only two years later, in 1653, was the body transported to its final resting place. Contrary to Manchu customs at the time, which usually <b>dictated</b> <b>that</b> a deceased person should be cremated, the Shunzhi Emperor was buried. He was interred in what later {{came to be known as}} the Eastern Qing Tombs, 125 kilometers (75 miles) northeast of Beijing, one of two Qing imperial cemeteries. His tomb is part of the Xiaoling (孝陵) mausoleum complex (known in Manchu as the Hiyoošungga Munggan), which was the first mausoleum to be erected on that site.|$|E

50|$|From the {{cognitive}} perspective, the brain perceives auditory stimuli as music according to gestalt principles, or “principles of grouping.” Gestalt principles include proximity, similarity, closure, and continuation. Each of the gestalt principles illustrates a different element of auditory stimuli that {{cause them to}} be perceived as a group, or as one unit of music. Proximity <b>dictates</b> <b>that</b> auditory stimuli that are near to each other are seen as a group. Similarity <b>dictates</b> <b>that</b> when multiple auditory stimuli are present, the similar stimuli are perceived as a group. Closure is the tendency to perceive an incomplete auditory pattern as a whole—the brain “fills in” the gap. And continuation <b>dictates</b> <b>that</b> auditory stimuli are more likely {{to be perceived as}} a group when they follow a continuous, detectable pattern.|$|R
5|$|By 22:00, the Rangers and ex-POWs {{arrived at}} Plateros, where they rested {{for half an}} hour. A radio message was sent and {{received}} by Sixth Army at 23:00 that the mission had been a success, {{and that they were}} returning with the rescued prisoners to American lines. After a headcount, it was discovered that POW Edwin Rose, a deaf British soldier, was missing. Mucci <b>dictated</b> <b>that</b> none of the Rangers could be spared to search for him, so he sent several guerrillas {{to do so in the}} morning. It was later learned that Rose had fallen asleep in the latrine before the attack. Rose woke early the next morning, and realized the other prisoners were gone and that he was left behind. Nevertheless, he took the time to shave and put on his best clothes that he had been saving for the day he would be rescued. He walked out of the prison camp, thinking that he would soon be found and led to freedom. Sure enough, Rose was found by passing guerrillas. Arrangements were made for a tank destroyer unit to pick him up and transport him to a hospital.|$|E
5|$|Fifteen {{years after}} its last album, in November 2008, Guns N' Roses {{released}} Chinese Democracy exclusively via the electronics retailer Best Buy. Rose did {{not contribute to the}} album's promotion; by December, he had reportedly been missing for at least two months and had not returned phone calls or other requests from his record label. In a subsequent interview, Rose stated that he felt he had not received the necessary support from Interscope Records. A year after the album's release, in December 2009, Guns N' Roses embarked on another two-and-a-half years of touring, including a headlining performance at Rock in Rio 4. Rose was subsequently sued by former band manager Irving Azoff, who sought $1.87million in unpaid fees related to the tour. In a countersuit, Rose alleged Azoff had deliberately mismanaged the band and their album's promotion to force him to join his former bandmates for a reunion tour. Both cases were settled. According to Rose in 2011, part of the settlement agreement <b>dictated</b> <b>that</b> Rose and the current Guns N' Roses had to do a number of performances with Azoff's company Live Nation as the promoter.|$|E
5|$|Goebel's and Beckham's {{challenges}} to the election results were received by the General Assembly on January 2. The following day, the Assembly appointed a contest committee to investigate the allegations contained in the challenges, voter fraud and illegal military intimidation of voters among them. The {{members of the committee}} were drawn at random, although the drawing was likely rigged—only one Republican joined ten Democrats on the committee. (Chance <b>dictated</b> <b>that</b> the committee should have contained four or five Republicans.) The joint committee on the rules recommended that the contest committee report at the pleasure of the General Assembly, that debate was limited once the findings were presented, and that the report be voted on in a joint session of the Assembly. The rules further provided that the speaker of the House would preside over this joint session instead of the lieutenant governor, as was customary. The Republican minority fought these provisions, but the Democratic majority passed them over their opposition.|$|E

5|$|Handled {{the ball}} was {{formerly}} one of the methods of dismissing a batsman in the sport of cricket, but was integrated into the Law on obstructing the field when the Laws of Cricket were rewritten in 2017. It <b>dictated</b> <b>that</b> either batsman can be given out if they intentionally touch the ball with a hand that is not holding their bat. An exception was given if the batsman handled the ball to avoid injury. It was governed by Law 33 of the 2000 Edition of the Laws, and was a rare way for a batsman to be dismissed: {{in the history of}} cricket, there have been 61 instances in first-class matches and 5 occasions in List A games. In most cases this occurred when a batsman thought that {{the ball was}} going to hit their wicket, and knocked it away from the stumps with their hand.|$|E
5|$|On 31 August 1957, the British {{territory}} of Malaya received {{its independence from}} the Crown {{as a part of}} Britain's colonial withdrawal from the Far East, after nearly a decade of tortuous counter-insurgency warfare by British and Commonwealth troops against Malayan rebels in the Malayan Emergency. British plans <b>dictated</b> <b>that</b> the new state would be federated with the British colonies of Sarawak, Sabah, and Brunei in northern Borneo in order to better protect British military and economic interests in those regions. Brunei did not join, but Sarawak, Sabah, and Singapore had all agreed to join the new Federation by 1963. This project, labeled the 'Grand Design' by politician Malcolm MacDonald in the 1950s, became the cornerstone of British strategic thinking concerning Southeast Asia, and led to the initial federation of the numerous Malayan states in spite of their multifarious differences, with Singapore and the Borneo states to join later. This plan also earned the support of the Malaysian government, which hoped to forestall claims from Indonesia on Borneo.|$|E
5|$|Slow {{transportation}} and food preservation techniques (based on drying, salting, smoking and pickling) made long-distance trade of many foods very expensive. Because of this, the nobility food was {{more prone to}} foreign influence than the cuisine of the poor; it was dependent on exotic spices and expensive imports. As each level of society imitated the one above it, innovations from international trade and foreign wars from the 12th century onwards gradually disseminated through the upper middle class of medieval cities. Aside from economic unavailability of luxuries such as spices, decrees outlawed consumption of certain foods among certain social classes and sumptuary laws limited conspicuous consumption among the nouveaux riches. Social norms also <b>dictated</b> <b>that</b> the food {{of the working class}} be less refined, since it was believed there was a natural resemblance between one's labour and one's food; manual labour required coarser, cheaper food.|$|E
