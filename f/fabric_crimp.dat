40|$|This paper aims {{to better}} {{understand}} the nature of flax/epoxy hot melt prepreg systems as well as the mechanical properties of their cured composites. Two uncured systems were subjected to thermal gravimetric analysis and compaction experiments. Composites were then produced in an autoclave at pressures of 1, 3 and 5 bars. Void analysis was carried out on the cured laminates by optical microscopy and void contents ranging from below 1 % to over 20 % were obtained by image analysis. The primary source of voids was shown to be resin starvation {{based on the results of}} the compaction tests. Tensile properties were shown to be strongly degraded by <b>fabric</b> <b>crimp.</b> Short beam tests revealed a 16 % decrease in interlaminar shear strength with a 3. 5 % increase in void content. Similarly, water absorption tests showed a significant increase in rate of absorption likely due to the presence of voids. The results suggest that in order for flax/epoxy prepregs to reach their full potential, the level of crimp and the evacuation of moisture during cure should be of primary concern. status: publishe...|$|E

This thesis presents a simulation program allowing a reliable calculation of the non- linear deformation of woven fabrics under tensile stress. The calculations {{are based on the}} finite elements method, whose procedures and algorithms have been adapted, or newly developed, to conform to the special requirements of the fabric calculation. To allow for an application-oriented utilization and easy handling of the program, all data entry will follow the usual principles and guidelines for fabric construction. The calculation results for technical woven fabrics, considering different weaves, as well as different materials, clearly show that our development target has been achieved. The accuracy of all the calculated variations is sufficiently high to describe the force-elongation characteristics, as well as the values of the peak tension and the elongation at peak tension. Especially the range of initial strain; which, due to the <b>fabric</b> <b>crimp,</b> deviates strongly from the fiber characterization, is well displayed by the simulation program. Based on this newly developed simulation environment weaving mills could reduce the personnel intensive and time consuming weaving tests, used to determine the mechanical properties of woven fabrics.

This thesis provides an initial evaluation of quality and mechanical properties of components made from stitched multilayer 3 D non <b>crimp</b> <b>fabric</b> preforms using RTM.

The dynamic delamination response under Mode I is investigated using visual and force measurements as well as numerical analysis to minimize errors due to the dynamics of this test. For loading speed larger than 3 m/s the double cantilever beam (DCB) is subjected to mixed Mode loading (Mode I/II). This result is inherent {{to the nature of}} the test and the impactor that introduced the load in the lower DCB arm. Numerical simulations show that this effect would also occur for UD laminates. Consequently the validity of the tests is limited to loading speeds below 3 m/s until which pure Mode I loading is achieved. For those loading rates optical analysis shows rate effects only at the crack initiation state which are stronger for the tufted interface. To avoid mixed mode effects at higher loading rates (> 3 m/s), the DCB specimen must be loaded at both arms simultaneously.

The 15 0; off-axis case returns a p-value of 7. 4 % and the 20 0; off-axis case gives a p-value of 21. 3 %. It can be concluded that the effect is small and not statistically significant. It means that remaining off-axis testing in the larger context can proceed with the nominal width of 12 mm...|$|R
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{one-step}} co-curing process of carbon fiber reinforced plastics (CFRP) joined with a steel plate to form a hybrid structure. In this process CFRP laminate and bond to the metal are realized simultaneously by resin infusion, such that the same resin serves for both infusion and adhesion. For comparison, the commonly applied two-step process of adhesive bonding is studied. In this case, the CFRP laminate is fabricated in a first stage through resin infusion of Non <b>Crimp</b> <b>Fabric</b> (NCF) and joined to the steel plate in a further step through adhesive bonding. For this purpose, the commercially available epoxy-based Betamate 1620 is applied. CFRP laminates were fabricated using two different resin systems, namely the epoxy (EP) -based RTM 6 and a newly developed fast curing polyurethane (PU) resin. Results show comparable mechanical performance of the PU and EP based CFRP laminates. The strength of the bond of the co-cured samples {{was in the same}} order as the samples adhesively bonded with the PU resin and the structural adhesive. The assembly adhesive with higher ductility showed a weaker performance compared to the other tests. It could be shown that the surface roughness had the highest impact on the joint performance under the investigated conditions...|$|R
40|$|For the {{development}} of a composite main landing gear fitting in carbon fiber reinforced plastics the behavior and performance of Ultra Thick Laminate components is investigated. Material thicknesses exceeds 60 mm. For the purpose of validation a test program is arranged using T-cross sections subjected to multiple load cases. The components are manufactured entirely with non <b>crimped</b> <b>fabrics</b> (NCF) using an adapted open mould manufacturing process. In addition to these T-Sections large full scale subcomponents of the entire fitting are manufactured and tested. As main topic of this paper standard FE methods are investigated and validated for thick structures using the generated test results. Due to the presence of transverse shear and normal stresses a 3 D modeling approach is chosen. Transverse shear and normal stresses are indentified as main failure cause and failure is mainly initiated in the curved regions. Solid composite brick elements offer an efficient way to model thick structures. These are incapable of calculating accurate shear stresses on a ply level; usable results are however achieved by discretisation of the component with multiple elements over thickness. In addition stress gradients in the failure region are small; stress variations on a ply level are minimal. Out of plane material properties are not available and initial assumptions are made. Material correction factors (degradation) are introduced and discussed. QC 20101216 </p...|$|R
