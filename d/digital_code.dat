40|$|Abstract: Both <b>digital</b> <b>codes</b> in {{computers}} and nucleotide codes in cells are protected against mutations. Here we explore how mutation protection affects the random change and selection of <b>digital</b> and nucleotide <b>codes.</b> We illustrate our findings {{with a computer}} simulation {{of the evolution of}} a population of self replicating digital amoebae. We show that evolutionary programming of <b>digital</b> <b>codes</b> is a valid model for the evolution of nucleotide codes by random change within the boundaries of mutation protection, not for evolution by unbounded random change. Our mutation protection perspective enhances the understanding of the evolutionary dynamics of <b>digital</b> and nucleotide <b>codes</b> and its limitations, and reveals a paradox between the necessity of dysfunctioning mutation protection for evolution and its disadvantage for survival. Our mutation protection perspective suggests new directions for research into mutational robustness...|$|R

Due to limitations of electronics circuitry, there was no (MPEG) source coding at the time to lower the overall bit rates.

The collector's edition contained the REQ bundle, dossiers, Guardian statue, and Fall of Reach, plus a commemorative statue of Master Chief and Agent Locke. The collector's edition comes with a <b>digital</b> <b>code</b> rather than a physical disc; fan feedback led Microsoft to offer a free trade-in program so collector's edition buyers could have the disc instead.|$|E

The spike trains can be symbolized by <b>digital</b> <b>codes</b> based on spike-position modulation. It is theoretically clarified that {{different types of}} codes (e. g., binary and Gray number codes) can be realized by adjusting system parameters. We also present a multiplex com-munication system. A transmitter neuron can map multiple dig-ital codes into a single spike train. A pulse-coupled network of the neurons accepts the spike train and can retrieve the <b>digital</b> <b>codes</b> based on a synchronization phenomenon. Typical phenomena are confirmed by HDL simulation. Index Terms—Pulse position modulation, pulse-coupled net-work, shift register, spiking neuron. I...|$|R

40|$|Analog error {{correction}} codes, by relaxing the source {{space and the}} codeword space from discrete fields to continuous fields, present a generalization of <b>digital</b> <b>codes.</b> While linear codes are sufficient for <b>digital</b> <b>codes,</b> they are not for analog codes, and hence nonlinear mappings must be employed to fully harness the power of analog codes. This paper demonstrates new ways of building effective (nonlinear) analog codes from a special class of nonlinear, fast-diverging functions known as the chaotic functions. It is shown that the "butterfly effect" of the chaotic functions matches elegantly with the distance expansion condition required for {{error correction}}, and that the useful idea in <b>digital</b> turbo <b>codes</b> can be exploited to construct efficient turbo-like chaotic analog codes. Simulations show that the new analog codes can perform on par with, or better than, their digital counter-parts when transmitting analog sources.
