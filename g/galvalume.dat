50|$|<b>Galvalume</b> {{was invented}} by Bethlehem Steel in 1972. It is a trademarked name, but many people {{use it as a}} generic term to {{describe}} a metal roofing product consisting of steel coil coated with a metal alloy. That alloy is 45% zinc and 55% aluminum and looks similar to galvanized steel, but the visible crystals are smaller and close together, giving it a smoother appearance. <b>Galvalume</b> has a cousin, <b>Galvalume</b> Plus. The only difference is Plus has a thin, clear acrylic coating. Because <b>Galvalume</b> Plus can be roll-formed dry without vanishing oil, it is very easy to form and install safely.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Galvalume</b> is an {{excellent}} product for long-life roofing and siding material. The aluminum additive, along with the zinc, allows small particle areas to form within this coating. Any corrosion that occurs does so within these open particle areas. Galvanized metal corrodes in a linear fashion and eventually depletes the zinc coating entirely. <b>Galvalume,</b> {{on the other hand}} experiences some corrosion, but on a smaller and less significant scale. <b>Galvalume</b> will not breakdown completely, as galvanized will.|$|E

50|$|<b>Galvalume</b> {{steel sheet}} is carbon steel sheet coated with aluminium-zinc alloy by a {{continuous}} hot-dip process. The nominal coating composition is 55% aluminium and 45% zinc. A small but important addition of silicon {{is included in}} the coating alloy. It is added not to enhance the corrosion performance, but to provide good coating adhesion to the steel substrate when the product is roll-formed, drawn, or bent during fabrication.Galvalume steel sheet combines the excellent barrier corrosion protection of aluminium with the galvanic protection of zinc. The result is a coating that lasts a long time, a coating that provides cut-edge protection along sheared edges, and therefore, a coating that offers excellent protection to steel sheet. Although there are a few exceptions, for most applications in most types of environment, <b>Galvalume</b> steel sheet is the preferred product when long-term resistance to atmospheric corrosion is desired. It outlasts a galvanized coating of comparable thickness, and offers cut-edge protection that is not available with aluminium-coated sheet. This cut-edge protection means there is less rust-staining along sheared edges, at scratches, and other imperfections in the coating. Also, since the coating is so resistant to corrosion, it retains a very bright surface appearance when exposed to most atmospheres. These attributes make <b>Galvalume</b> steel sheet the preferred material for roofing. The superior corrosion resistance of <b>Galvalume</b> steel sheet is achieved by the presence of microscopic zinc-rich and aluminium-rich areas within the coating. The aluminium-rich areas, which corrode very slowly, provide the long-term durability while the zinc-rich areas, which corrode preferentially, provide galvanic protection. <b>Galvalume</b> metals are made with steel panels having a coating of corrosion resistant aluminium-zinc alloy applied by a continuous hot dip process. The nominal composition of the coating is 55% aluminium, 43.5% zinc and 1.5% silicon. <b>Galvalume</b> is the trade name for this patented sheet steel product. The alloy coating of aluminium and zinc combines the best properties of both metals. It has the corrosion resistance and heat reflectivity characteristic of aluminium coatings, with the formability and galvanic protection of cut edges characteristic of zinc coatings.|$|E

A series of immersion tests were undertaken to understand the dross formation mechanisms and surface reactions. The various steps involved {{in the formation of}} the intermetallic dross layer and the behavior of silicon during this process were studied. Growth of the intermetallic dross layer and its composition were analyzed using SEM/EDS. The results indicated that the initial rate of dross formation was retarded due to the formation of a silicon-rich inhibition zone on the stainless steel substrate surface. However, samples immersed longer than 40 minutes showed a breakdown of the silicon-rich layer and accelerated rate of dross formation. Growth of the intermetallic dross layer continued to increase over time due to agglomeration of the dross particles formed on the roll surface. These results suggest that initial dross removal on a sink roll (by a scraper) should be carried out within 30 - 40 minutes after the roll is placed in the <b>galvalume</b> bath, and a strategy of more frequent (or even continuous) dross removing action with less scraping pressure may be beneficial...|$|E

The corrosion resistance of 316 L and Fe 3 AI {{is similar in}} Aluminizing bath. In static tests, FeCrSi shows the ' best corrosion resistance in pure Zn, Zn- 55 AI ~ and AI- 8 Si baths. The corrosion resistance of 316 L is better than that of Fe 3 Al. In Zn- 5 AI bath, 316 L shows no thickness loss after the test. For the same bath composition, the corrosion rates of the alloys in industrial baths are higher than those in static baths. Bath temperature and chemical composition play important roles in corrosion and intermetallic layer formation. Increasing bath temperature accelerates the corrosion process and changes the nature of intermetallic layers. A small amount of aluminum reduces the corrosion process by reducing the activity of Zn and forming inhibition layer. However, after aluminum content reaches the critical point, the dominant corrosion process changes from Zn-Fe reaction to AI-Fe reaction, and, consequently, the corrosion process accelerates by increasing aluminum content in the bath.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} results from experimental research conducted at FSEC's Flexible Roofing Facility {{in the summer of}} 2002. The Flexible Roof Facility (FRF) is a test facility in Cocoa, Florida designed to evaluate a combination of five roofing systems against a control roof using dark shingles. The intent of the testing is to evaluate how roofing systems impact residential cooling energy use. Recent testing emphasizes evaluation of how increasingly popular metal roofing systems, both finished and unfinished, might compare with other more traditional roofing types. All of the test cells had R- 19 insulation installed on the attic floor except in the double roof configuration which had R- 19 of open cell foam blown onto the underside of the roof decking. The test results were used to determine relative thermal performance of various roofing systems under typical Florida summer conditions. Measured impacts included changes to ceiling heat flux and attic air temperature which influences loads from unintended attic air leakage and duct heat gain. We also develop an analysis method to estimate total cooling energy benefits of different roofing systems considering the various impacts. The results show that all the options perform better than dark composition shingles. White metal performs best with an estimated cooling energy reduction of about 15 %, but the spectrally selective metal shingles (12 %) and unfinished <b>Galvalume</b> roofs (11 %) do surprisingly well. Galvanized roofing did less well than <b>Galvalume</b> (7 % reduction) and worse performance in the second year of exposure was observed due to corrosion of the zinc surface.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of {{high tensile steel}} sheet to {{permit the use of}} thinner gauge in large pressings has increased the occurrence of the forms of elastic distortion known as springback and side-wall curl, and has increased, likewise, the need to control these by appropriate changes to the selection of process parameters when they lead to an unsightly product, or, more significantly, to a product in which loss of dimensional accuracy causes loss of function. They may also affect manufacture by making the stripping of the tooling more difficult. The use of thin sheet of high unit cost has increased the need for protection by zinc or aluminium/zinc (<b>galvalume)</b> coatings, and their effect on springback and side-wall curl under conditions appropriate to the pressing of large shallow panels is the subject of the present investigation. It is concluded that the resulting modification of friction does not significantly change the behaviour of steel sheet. Generally, any change in friction which increases the transverse stress gradient increases springback and side-wall curl. It appears that differences in the reported effect of tool geometry on springback and side-wall curl can be attributed largely to differences in the rate of work hardening of the sheet tested. It is confirmed that springback and side-wall curl increase with yield strength and work-hardening rate and with tool radius and tool clearance. © 1989...|$|E

Assuming broad implementation of project results, energy savings in 2020 were projected to be 10 trillion BTU/year, with cost savings of approximately $ 100 million/year. The project team was comprised of materials research groups from West Virginia University and the Missouri University of Science and Technology formerly University of Missouri – Rolla, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, International Lead and Zinc Research Organization, Secat and Energy Industries of Ohio. Industry partners included six suppliers to the hot dip galvanizing industry, four end-user steel companies with hot-dip Galvanize and/or <b>Galvalume</b> lines, eight refractory suppliers, and seven refractory end-user companies. The results of the project included the development of: (1) New families of materials more resistant to degradation in hot-dip galvanizing bath conditions were developed; (2) Alloy 2020 weld overlay material and process were developed and applied to GI rolls; (3) New Alloys and dross-cleaning procedures were developed for <b>Galvalume</b> processes; (4) Two new refractory compositions, including new anti-wetting agents, were identified for use with liquid aluminum alloys; (5) A new thermal conductivity measurement technique was developed and validated at ORNL; (6) The Galvanizing Energy Profiler Decision Support System (GEPDSS) at WVU; Newly Developed CCW Laser Cladding Shows Better Resistance to Dross Buildup than 316 L Stainless Steel; and (7) A novel method of measuring the corrosion behavior of bath hardware materials. Project in-line trials were conducted at Southwire Kentucky Rod and Cable Mill, Nucor-Crawfordsville, Nucor-Arkansas, Nucor-South Carolina, Wheeling Nisshin, California Steel, Energy Industries of Ohio, and Pennex Aluminum. Cost, energy, and environmental benefits resulting from the project are due to: i) a reduced number of process shutdowns to change hardware or lining material, ii) reduced need to produce new hardware or lining material, iii) improved product quality leads to reduced need to remake product or manufacturing of new product, iv) reduction in contamination of melt from degradation of refractory and metallic components, v) elimination of worn hardware will increase efficiency of process, vi) reduced refractory lining deterioration or formation of a less insulating phase, would result in decreased heat loss through the walls. Projected 2015 benefits for the U. S. aluminum industry, assuming 21 % market penetration of improved refractory materials, are energy savings of approximately 0. 2 trillion BTU/year, cost savings of $ 2. 3 billion/year and carbon reductions of approximately 1. 4 billion tons/year. The carbon reduction benefit of the project for the hot-dip galvanize and aluminum industries combined is projected to be approximately 2. 2 billion tons/year in 2015.

40|$|The {{interaction}} of {{the surface of a}} pure metal or an alloy with the surrounding atmosphere occurs in a highly complex interfacial regime. During atmospheric corrosion this interfacial regime involves the metal surface, often covered by a naturally formed oxide layer of a few nanometers thickness; an aqueous adlayer, typically with a thickness of a few to a few tens of nanometers, and the atmosphere from which airborne particles, oxygen, and gaseous pollutants dissolve into the adlayer and influence the atmospheric corrosion process. This thesis work is mainly concerned with the initial atmospheric corrosion of zinc and brass induced by carboxylic acids (120 parts per billion of formic, acetic, or propionic acid) in laboratory air with 90 % relative humidity. This model system has been chosen to mimic indoor corrosion with carboxylic acids as major corrosion stimulators. The study forms part of a broader research program with the ultimate goal to provide a computer model of the early stages of atmospheric corrosion of copper, zinc and copper-zinc alloys, induced by carboxylic acids. Particular emphasis has been given to identify and quantify the corrosion products formed and to determine their lateral distribution over the corroding surface. This has been accomplished through a multi-analytical approach in which two main techniques are infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (IRAS) which can identify and quantify corrosion products with a relative accuracy of about 10 %, and confocal Raman microspectroscopy (CRM) which can identify and resolve corrosion products with a surface lateral resolution of better than one micrometer. The corrosion products identified on pure zinc are zinc oxide (ZnO) and various forms of Zn-carboxylates. On brass, the main corrosion products identified are a cuprite (Cu 2 O) -like phase and various forms of Zn-carboxylates. For pure zinc and brass the formation rates of corrosion products in presence of the investigated acids depend, among others, on their deposition velocity and acid strength. The {{interaction of}} pure zinc and brass with humidified air containing carboxylic acids follows two spatially separated main pathways: a proton-induced dissolution of metal ions followed by the formation of oxides, and a carboxylate-induced dissolution followed by the deposition of metal carboxylates. When applying this multi-analytical approach, it has been possible to distinguish between anodically and cathodically active areas for brass, but not for pure zinc. Galvanic effects have been shown to play a significant role during the initial corrosion of brass.   Further evidence of the selective formation of corrosion products has been found when exploring the more complex heterogeneous surface of <b>Galvalume,</b> a commercial aluminum-zinc alloy coating. This material has been exposed to humidified laboratory air with additions of carbon dioxide (CO 2) and sodium chloride (NaCl) and to a marine atmospheric environment. Initiated in the interdendritic zinc-rich areas, a uniform aluminum oxide (Al 2 O 3) layer is formed. This oxide exhibits an inhibiting effect on the subsequent formation of other corrosion products, including aluminum oxyhydroxide (AlOOH), aluminum hydroxide (Al(OH) 3), ZnO, zinc hydroxycarbonate and zinc hydroxychloride.  QC 2011060...|$|E
