25|$|Panic {{disorder}} is an anxiety disorder characterized by recurrent unexpected panic attacks. Panic attacks are sudden periods of intense fear that may include palpitations, sweating, shaking, shortness of breath, numbness, or a <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>something</b> really bad {{is going to}} happen. The maximum degree of symptoms occurs within minutes. There may be ongoing worries about having further attacks and avoidance of places where attacks {{have occurred in the}} past.|$|E
25|$|In Japan, Ryu Hayabusa is {{approached}} by Hayate and joins him and Ayane. Helena informs {{them that the}} Phase Four will see a mass production of Kasumi clones to sell them to top militaries in the world. <b>Feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>something</b> is wrong with Kasumi, Hayate orders Ayane to follow her and discover her real intentions. Frustrated with her failure to track down Alpha, Kasumi returns to Helena, demanding to be told the truth, and Helena directs her to the platform. There, Hayate wins the right to follow her from Bayman. Kasumi discovers the lab, with Alpha-152 in it, and appears to destroy her clone. However, she is then attacked and mortally wounded by Hayate and Ayane, and dies in Ryu's arms. This Kasumi is revealed to be merely a clone herself, but Ryu regrets her death anyway. Ryu destroys attacking helicopters (of the kind that attacked the rig earlier), while Hayate is captured in the lab by Rig, who {{turns out to be}} working with Donovan. Ryu sends a falcon with a message for the true Kasumi, who has been sheltering with Murumasa all that time; she immediately joins them up at the platform. In the lab, they defeat Rig, who escapes after saying it was a plan to lure them there. Lisa, dismayed to find out that Project Epsilon has been reactivated, frees Hayate. Alpha-152 then appears, taking forms of not only Kasumi but also of Hayate and Ryu, but Hayate and Ayane, Ryu and ultimately Kasumi succeed in destroying her along with the lab.|$|E
500|$|After {{they viewed}} the final {{cut of the}} episode, Shiban and Spotnitz decided that they were [...] "far from the end". <b>Feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>something</b> was missing, the two decided to frame the happenings of the episode with two scenes {{featuring}} Scully in a church confessional. Vancouver producer J.P. Finn was chosen {{to play the role}} of the priest in the scene, due to his [...] "hushed delivery and map-of-Ireland features". Initially, Gillian Anderson was sent the script for the last-minute shot—which comprised two-and-a-half pages—well in advance. On the night before the reshoot, however, the crew sent her the further rewrites, which were much greater. Anderson refused to rush her performance, noting that, not only would it be difficult for her to memorize her lines, it would also undermine the emotion she was supposed to put into the scene. The crew ended up shooting a day later. Due to this, Finn never actually filmed with Anderson. In order to make up for the added scenes—a total of seven pages worth—the first cut of the episode had to be trimmed [...] "scene by scene and line by line".|$|E
6000|$|... "And yet, somehow," [...] said Billie, {{plaiting}} her hair, [...] "do {{you ever}} have presentiments? I can't get rid of an awful <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>something's</b> {{going to happen to}} spoil everything." ...|$|R
50|$|Ephraim {{throws a}} party {{for the birth of}} what he {{considers}} his new son. Abbie sits in a chair, pale and unmoving. She keeps asking where Eben is. The party guests keep hinting that they know the son is Eben's but neither Abbie nor Ephraim catch on. Abbie goes upstairs and finds Eben, they kiss, and she says the baby looks just like him. Ephraim goes outside for air, and with a <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>something's</b> not at rest, goes to sleep with the cows.|$|R
5000|$|Jay Hedblade of the Chicago Tribune {{had a more}} mixed sentiment, saying: [...] "Bernard Butler {{offers more}} textured, {{palatable}} rock cast in a classic mode. Like his debut, People Move On, Butler demonstrates he's adept at building gorgeous mile-high melodies that hit all the right buttons, yet as agreeable as it is, there's still a nagging <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>something's</b> missing." [...] Although he did say the album had [...] "brilliant moments", he concluded by saying: [...] "elsewhere Butler spends too much time waxing poetic without the verbal dexterity {{to hold up the}} grand nature of the tunes." ...|$|R
500|$|As {{the police}} claimed {{that there were}} no {{surviving}} papers in the case, and the senior investigating officers had since died, Chand relied largely upon newspaper cuttings to piece together what had happened. Chand, who acted pro bono for Hodgson, said of his investigation: [...] "The search was the most difficult thing I have encountered in my personal and professional life. It was like finding a needle in a haystack. I spent months chasing false leads and implacable bureaucracy but I was not prepared to accept this, as instinct told me that the samples would be somewhere. I persevered because I had a gut <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>something</b> was wrong." [...] Eventually, Chand's probing led to the rediscovery of an archive of evidence on an industrial estate in the Midlands [...] "which they appeared to have forgotten about". Stored here were all of the swabs taken by the pathologist in December 1979. In December 2008 the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) notified Julian Young of the initial results of the DNA analysis, and on 30January 2009 it was confirmed that the semen detected on the vaginal and the anal swabs could not have originated from Hodgson.|$|E
500|$|Obsidian drew {{on older}} {{computer}} RPGs for inspiration on the storyline and gameplay, like Fallout and the Ultima series. Obsidian CEO Feargus Urquhart said [...] "We've {{been thinking about}} a lot of older RPGs, and we have this <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>something</b> has been lost with recent RPGs." [...] He compared Neverwinter Nights 2 to Baldur's Gate II, stating that he wanted to expand upon the city of Neverwinter as Baldur's Gate II had done with its setting, Athkatla. [...] "We're looking at how to make Neverwinter a really intriguing place to be, and make it a place where you go and come back to and go and come back to and have it really be a center for the game," [...] Urquhart said. The game's story, while still revolving around the city of Neverwinter, would be unrelated to Neverwinter Nights. Instead of starting the game as a powerful, important character, players would begin Neverwinter Nights 2 as nobodies. Obsidian wanted realism in the game and concrete consequences for the player's actions. The story would be centered on the player character, who would have to gradually earn the respect of Lord Nasher and the city of Neverwinter.|$|E
500|$|Several reviews {{praised the}} game's setting. GameSpy's David Chapman called it [...] "a truly {{remarkable}} experience. And, while {{the game itself}} may not have broken any new ground, the world it introduces more than makes up for that. It will leave gamers hungry for more." [...] According to Game Informer, [...] "in terms of gameplay quality, this may be another middle-of-the-road shooter, but the unique premise sets it aside from everything else out there." [...] Greg Bemis of G4TV wrote that the biggest draw in Darkwatch is the [...] "different enough" [...] setting that [...] "does fall back on tired video game clichés {{from time to time}} like big-breasted, leather-clad babes who speak in aggressive sexually suggestive double entendres, but it’s nice to see something--anything--that’s a little off the beaten path." [...] GameShark's Will Jayson Hill wrote that [...] "about the sharpest criticism that can be leveled at Darkwatch is that it really adds nothing original in the gameplay department. Aside from its extremely well executed western/horror environment, Darkwatch is a pretty generic FPS game with a weaker multiplayer mode." [...] On the other hand, some reviews thought that the gameplay was actually the strongest part of the game. Official UK PlayStation 2 Magazine stated Darkwatch [...] "has a few neat ideas but wins us over by doing solid shooting well. Fast-paced with cool guns, what's not to like?" [...] GameZone's Mike David wrote that only a [...] "weak plot pacing and that <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>something</b> is missing" [...] kept it from being given a score of 9/10.|$|E
5000|$|The band {{released}} the EP Samples on Collagen Rock Records in 2008. Music critic John Sakamoto of the Toronto Star described their sound as [...] "a compelling {{tug of war}} between wanting to dance and <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> there's <b>something</b> else you're supposed to be doing." ...|$|R
60|$|Sir Thomas {{passed the}} whole of that day in his own room; but during a great portion of the day either his wife, or sister, or son was with him. They endeavoured not to leave him alone with his own thoughts, <b>feeling</b> {{conscious}} <b>that</b> <b>something</b> preyed upon his mind, though ignorant as to what <b>that</b> <b>something</b> might be.|$|R
60|$|WINSOR. Very little. Oh! by the way, {{the numbers}} of those two notes were given, and I see they're {{published}} in the evening papers. I suppose the police wanted that. I tell you what I find, Graviter--a general <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> there's <b>something</b> behind it all that doesn't come out.|$|R
500|$|Commentators {{around the}} world sought to {{interpret}} {{the relationship between the}} Na'vi and humans in the film, mostly agreeing with Maxim Osipov, who wrote in the Hindustan Times and The Sydney Morning Herald: [...] "The 'civilised humans' turn out as primitive, jaded and increasingly greedy, cynical, and brutal—traits only amplified by their machinery—while the 'monkey aliens' emerge as noble, kind, wise, sensitive and humane. We, along with the Avatar hero, are now faced with an uncomfortable yet irresistible choice between the two races and the two worldviews." [...] Osipov wrote that it was inevitable that the audience, like the film's hero, Jake, would find that the Na'vi's culture was really the more civilized of the two, exemplifying [...] "the qualities of kindness, gratitude, regard for the elder, self-sacrifice, respect for all life and ultimately humble dependence on a higher intelligence behind nature." [...] Echoing this analysis, psychologist Jeffery Fine in The Miami Herald urged [...] "every man, woman and child" [...] to see the film and wake up to its message by making the right choice between commercial materialism, which is [...] "steamrolling our soul and consciousness", and reconnection with all life as [...] "the only... promise of survival" [...] for humanity. [...] Similarly, an Angolan critic saw the film as a message of hope, writing, [...] "With this union of humans and aliens comes a <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>something</b> better exists in the universe: the respect for life." [...] Cameron confirmed that [...] "the Na'vi represent the better aspects of human nature, and the human characters in the film demonstrate the more venal aspects of human nature." ...|$|E

2500|$|Mario Ferrandi, {{a militant}} of Prima Linea, nicknamed [...] "Coniglio" [...] (Rabbit), later {{said that when}} {{the news of the}} {{kidnapping}} and the killing of the bodyguards spread during a workers' demonstration {{there was a moment of}} amazement, followed by a moment of euphoria and anxiety because there was a <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>something</b> would happen so big that things would not be quite the same. He recalled that students present at the event spent the money of Cassa del circolo giovanile to buy champagne and toast with workers of the canteen.|$|E
500|$|The plan {{behind the}} scenes was to create an {{intriguing}} visual signature. [...] To serve the subtleties of the script and to help personify death, production designer John Willet developed the concept of [...] "skewing" [...] the sets. [...] "What I've tried {{to do with the}} sets themselves, with their design and with various color choices, is to make things just a little unnatural," [...] Willet explained. [...] "Nothing that calls attention to itself, but instead creates a sense of uneasiness—the unsettling <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>something's</b> not quite right". [...] To achieve this mystique, Willet designed two versions of virtually every set—one version was used before the crash and the other sets were used for scenes after the jet explodes.|$|R

60|$|She {{had been}} quick enough to note that, at mention of Gaston's name, his eyes {{suddenly}} wore a curious shamefaced expression and avoided meeting her own. She pressed her point more carelessly, <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> there was <b>something</b> <b>that</b> {{he would only}} tell her, if she was perfectly calm and natural in her questionings.|$|R
6000|$|The {{universal}} <b>feeling</b> was <b>that</b> <b>something</b> was amiss, and mamma {{was in the}} secret. Amy looked wistfully at her, but Mrs. Edmonstone only {{gazed at}} the window, and so they continued for some minutes, while an uninteresting exchange of question and answer was kept up {{between her and her}} nephew until at length the dressing-bell rang, and cleared the room. Mrs. Edmonstone lingered till her son and daughters were gone, and said,-- ...|$|R
60|$|A {{dark night}} {{was chosen for}} the attempt, and the Indian woman went off with the horses {{to the place where}} {{firewood}} for the camp was usually cut. Unfortunately the suspicion of that wily savage Mahtawa had been awakened, and he stuck close to the hunters all day--not knowing what was going on, but <b>feeling</b> convinced <b>that</b> <b>something</b> was brewing which he resolved to watch, without mentioning his suspicions to any one.|$|R

5000|$|The character's {{diagnosis}} with Multiple Sclerosis {{has also}} helped educate New Zealanders about the illness. Sufferers of multiple sclerosis praised the show, pleasing producer Jason Daniel who said; [...] "The story has already examined the impact her diagnosis has on her personally and professionally. And {{in the future}} it will explore how she learns {{to live with her}} MS. I’m very pleased that the MS Society approves of our efforts so far, and I hope that audiences will continue to find Sarah's story inspiring and uplifting." [...] Billing was pleased that fans of the show were so supportive of Sarah and TK and believed they saw their own families in the coupling, [...] "I'm stoked that the audience is so supportive of them getting back together. Maybe it's because we all want Mum, Dad and the kids to be together." [...] Billing believed that the love triangle between Sarah, TK and Roimata was relatable, [...] "Everyone's had the experience of <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>something's</b> getting in the way." ...|$|R
