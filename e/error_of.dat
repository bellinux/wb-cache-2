However, this distinction is debatable, and the view has been taken that courts sometimes simply regard a matter as one involving an <b>error</b> <b>of</b> law if they wish to adopt an interventionist approach, and seek to allow judicial review to take place.|$|E

The result of this research are 518 total <b>errors,</b> from types <b>of</b> <b>error</b> there are 261 (50. 38 %) <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> Misorder, 146 (28. 18 %) <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> Omission, 102 (19. 69 %) <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> Misformation, and 9 (1. 73 %) <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> Addition.

The writer got interested in making a study to out the types of English subject most of the students of SMAK PIRNGADI find hard to learn. In this study, the writer used the theory of Contra-stive Analysis which has the concepts that errors are caused by the interference of the learners' NL; the theory <b>of</b> <b>error</b> Analysis which states that most errors learn-ers make indicate they are gradually building an rule system; the theory of Interlanguage which refers to the structure system the learner constructs at any given stage in his development; the theory of the kinds of subjects of English sentences used to develop and analyze the test items. In constructing the instruments of this research, the writer made an objective test consisting of 80 items which was tried out and proved to be valid and reliable. Then the writer used the same test as the research test. The data obtained i. e the errors made by the students were classified into eight types: <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> nouns, <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> adjectives, <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> adverbs, <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> gerunds, <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> infinitives, <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> phrases, <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> clauses, <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> passive verbals.
