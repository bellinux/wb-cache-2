5|$|The {{effect of}} these acts on {{aboriginal}} title in California has been a subject of litigation for 150 years. Regardless, the United States never again pursued treaty negotiations with California Indians, instead favoring legislation and <b>executive</b> <b>orders.</b> By statute, Congress created several Indian reservations. Congress gave the executive the discretion to create further reservations. By 1986, Presidents had used this discretion to create 117 reservations totalling 632,000 acres.|$|E
5|$|Waters Davis stipulated in his sale to Deering {{that the}} Cape Florida {{lighthouse}} be restored. Deering {{wrote to the}} U.S. government seeking specifications and guidelines for the lighthouse. Government officials were {{taken aback by the}} request, wondering how a federal lighthouse could have passed into private hands. An Act of Congress and two <b>Executive</b> <b>Orders,</b> in 1847 and 1897, had reserved the island for the federal lighthouse and for military purposes. Patient legal work eventually convinced the U.S. Congress and President Woodrow Wilson to agree to recognize Matheson's and Deering's ownership of Key Biscayne.|$|E
5|$|The United States Code Congressional and Administrative News (U.S.C.C.A.N.) is a West Group {{publication}} that collects selected congressional and administrative materials {{for publication in}} a single resource.

5|$|The {{inauguration of}} Barack Obama as the 44th President {{took place on}} January 20, 2009. In his first few days in office, Obama issued <b>executive</b> <b>orders</b> and presidential memoranda {{directing}} the U.S. military to develop plans to withdraw troops from Iraq. He ordered {{the closing of the}} Guantanamo Bay detention camp, but Congress prevented the closure by refusing to appropriate the required funds and preventing moving any Guantanamo detainee into the U.S. or to other countries. Obama reduced the secrecy given to presidential records. He also revoked President George W. Bush's restoration of President Ronald Reagan's Mexico City Policy prohibiting federal aid to international family planning organizations that perform or provide counseling about abortion.|$|E
5|$|Despite DOMA, Clinton was {{the first}} {{president}} to select openly gay persons for administrative positions, and he is generally credited as being the first president to publicly champion gay rights. During his presidency, Clinton issued two substantially controversial <b>executive</b> <b>orders</b> on behalf of gay rights, the first lifting the ban on security clearances for LGBT federal employees and the second outlawing discrimination based on sexual orientation in the federal civilian workforce. Under Clinton's leadership, federal funding for HIV/AIDS research, prevention and treatment more than doubled. Clinton also pushed for passing hate crimes laws for gays and {{for the private sector}} Employment Non-Discrimination Act, which, buoyed by his lobbying, failed to pass the Senate by a single vote in 1996. Advocacy for these issues, paired with the politically unpopular nature of the gay rights movement at the time, led to enthusiastic support for Clinton's election and reelection by the Human Rights Campaign. Clinton came out for gay marriage in July 2009 and urged the Supreme Court to overturn DOMA in 2013. He was later honored by GLAAD for his prior pro-gay stances and his reversal on DOMA.|$|E
25|$|Roosevelt {{extensively}} used <b>executive</b> <b>orders</b> on {{a number}} of occasions to protect forest and wildlife lands during his tenure as President. By the end of his second term in office, Roosevelt used <b>executive</b> <b>orders</b> to establish 150 million acres of reserved forestry land. Roosevelt was unapologetic about his extensive use of <b>executive</b> <b>orders</b> to protect the environment, despite the perception in Congress that he was encroaching on too many lands. Eventually, Senator Charles Fulton (R-OH) attached an amendment to an agricultural appropriations bill that effectively prevented the president from reserving any further land. Before signing that bill into law, Roosevelt used <b>executive</b> <b>orders</b> to establish an additional 21 forest reserves, waiting until the last minute to sign the bill into law. In total, Roosevelt used <b>executive</b> <b>orders</b> to establish 121 forest reserves in 31 states. Prior to Roosevelt, only one president had issued over 200 <b>executive</b> <b>orders,</b> Grover Cleveland (253). The first 25 presidents issued a total of 1,262 <b>executive</b> <b>orders.</b> Roosevelt issued 1,081.|$|E

2500|$|The Clinton, Bush, and Obama administrations {{have each}} taken action to either rescind or {{reinstate}} this <b>Executive</b> <b>Order.</b> President Bill Clinton issued <b>Executive</b> <b>Order</b> 12836 on February 1, 1993, which revoked <b>Executive</b> <b>Order</b> 12800. The Labor Department subsequently withdrew its Bush-era regulations on union financial reporting on December 21, 1993. President George W. Bush then issued <b>Executive</b> <b>Order</b> 13201 on February 16, 2001, largely reinstating <b>Executive</b> <b>Order</b> 12800 and ordering DOL to re-issue its regulations. A coalition of unions sued to enjoin {{enforcement of the}} <b>Executive</b> <b>Order.</b> [...] The United States district court for the District of Columbia overturned the <b>Executive</b> <b>Order</b> {{on the grounds that}} the NLRA gave the NLRB exclusive jurisdiction over Beck rights, but the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, the Supreme Court refused to hear the case, and <b>Executive</b> <b>Order</b> 13201 went into effect. The last action was taken on January 30, 2009, when President Barack Obama issued <b>Executive</b> <b>Order</b> 13496, revoking E.O. 13201 and the DOL regulations yet again.|$|R

25|$|Obama also issued several <b>executive</b> <b>orders</b> and his {{administration}} issued regulatory rulings designed to help workers. One included raising the salary threshold above which employers {{do not have to}} pay overtime, from $455 to $913 per week. This would have increased the earnings of as many as 4.2 million workers beginning December 1, 2016, but it was blocked by a federal judge. The Labor Department also issued guidelines for employers on whether to treat contractors as employees; the latter receive additional pay and benefits. President Obama also issued <b>executive</b> <b>orders</b> to raise pay at companies that receive government contracts.|$|E

25|$|Workers {{in federal}} {{agencies}} had formed craft-based unions {{on the local}} level beginning in the early 1880s. The growing power of these and other unions in the federal government led President Theodore Roosevelt to issue two <b>Executive</b> <b>Orders</b> (in 1902 and 1906) essentially banning unions in the federal civil service. Under Congressional pressure, President William H. Taft made the <b>Executive</b> <b>Orders</b> less onerous in 1912. Unhappy with Taft's refusal to rescind the orders entirely, Congress passed the Lloyd-La Follette Act (§6, 37 Stat. 555, 5 U.S.C. § 7511) on August 24, 1912, declaring establishing the right of federal employees to join unions (albeit not the right for them to bargain collectively). Five years later, the American Federation of Labor (AFL) acted to bring the various local unions together to form a single national union, the National Federation of Federal Employees, in September 1917.|$|E
