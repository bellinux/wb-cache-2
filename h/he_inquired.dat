Gröning was informed that money taken from interned Jews was not actually returned to them. When <b>he</b> <b>inquired</b> further, his colleagues confirmed that the Jews were being systematically exterminated and that this had included the transport of prisoners who had arrived the previous night.|$|E
5|$|Lorković succeeded Pavelić as Foreign Minister on 9 June 1941. Shortly {{after taking}} office, <b>he</b> <b>inquired</b> with the French {{authorities}} {{about the fate}} of three Ustaše implicated in the 1934 assassination of King Alexander in Marseilles and sentenced to life imprisonment. The actual assassin was a Bulgarian mercenary, Vlado Chernozemski, who was killed after the deed by French security forces. Two of the men died in prison, but the third, Milan Rajić, was returned to the NDH in early 1942 through the intervention of the German occupation forces in France, where he was later killed allegedly on Pavelić's orders.|$|E
5|$|The 19-year-old Geoff Emerick was {{promoted}} to replace Norman Smith as engineer on the first session for the Revolver album. This started at 8pm on 6 April 1966, in Studio Three at Abbey Road. Lennon told producer Martin {{that he wanted to}} sound like a hundred chanting Tibetan monks, which left Martin the difficult task of trying to find the effect by using the basic equipment they had. The effect was achieved by using a Leslie speaker. When the concept was explained to Lennon, <b>he</b> <b>inquired</b> if the same effect could be achieved by hanging him upside down and spinning him around a microphone while he sang into it. Emerick made a connector to break into the electronic circuitry of the cabinet and then re-recorded the vocal as it came out of the revolving speaker.|$|E

25|$|Fleva's term {{as deputy}} also coincided with {{historical}} events {{relating to the}} Russo-Turkish War and Romanian independence. On May 9, 1877, <b>he</b> <b>inquired</b> Foreign Minister Kogălniceanu about the Russian attack on the Ottoman Empire; Kogălniceanu confirmed that Romania considered itself independent from her Ottoman sovereign. Although taken by some to mean that Romania was free as of May 9, this carefully staged discussion was rather a preamble to the actual independence declaration of May 10.|$|E

He was immediately assigned to illustrate the script for a ten-page Donald Duck story for the monthly Walt Disney's Comics and Stories. At the publisher's invitation he revised the storyline and the improvements impressed the editor sufficiently to invite Barks to try his hand at contributing both the script and the artwork of his follow-up story. This set the pattern for Barks' career in that (with rare exceptions) he provided art (pencil, inking, solid blacks and lettering) and scripting for his stories.|$|E

In December 1941, <b>he</b> <b>inquired</b> Pântea about his alleged employment of political suspects, which Pântea categorically denied. In 1942, government embarked on a complex, but erratic, investigation into the presence of former Komsomolists among Odessa's public sector employees. Allegations regarding Pântea's complicity in some acts of corruption prompted additional surveillance from Romanian Special Intelligence. Its subsequent reports accused the Mayor and some in his staff of keeping company with covert communists, and of trading {{on the black market}} of Chișinău. Later, sources adverse to Pântea claimed that he was the main beneficiary of trade in Moldovan wine and used goods, and that he had vested interest in aiding the Transnistrian Jews, who were his business partners.|$|E

25|$|Captain John G. Foster, a Union Army {{engineering}} officer observing from Fort Sumter, wrote {{reports to}} his superiors {{about the progress}} of the battery construction. Foster's assessment of the battery was dismissive, “...I think it can be destroyed by our fire before it has time to do much damage...” and he followed a few days later with, “...I do not think this floating battery will prove very formidable...” Nonetheless, his superior, Major Robert Anderson was apprehensive enough that <b>he</b> <b>inquired</b> for specific instructions from Washington regarding the threat of the battery. He was instructed that if he became convinced that the battery was advanced for the purpose of immediate attack then he would be justified in firing on it but if it was only being moved for the purposes of general emplacement that he should exercise forbearance.|$|E
25|$|Abraham settled between Kadesh and Shur in {{the land}} of the Philistines. While he was living in Gerar, Abraham openly claimed that Sarah was his sister. Upon {{discovering}} this news, King Abimelech had her brought to him. God then came to Abimelech in a dream and declared that taking her would result in death because she was a man's wife. Abimelech had not laid hands on her, so <b>he</b> <b>inquired</b> if he would also slay a righteous nation, especially since Abraham had claimed that he and Sarah were siblings. In response, God told Abimelech that he did indeed have a blameless heart and that is why he continued to exist. However, should he not return the wife of Abraham back to him, God would surely destroy Abimelech and his entire household. Abimelech was informed that Abraham was a prophet who would pray for him.|$|E
25|$|Haig {{wanted to}} delay his attack until May to {{coincide}} with Italian and Russian attacks, but {{was told by the}} government to take over French line as requested, to live up to both the “letter” and “spirit” of the agreement with the new French Commander-in-Chief Nivelle, to be ready no later than 1 April, and not cause delays, almost certainly a result of private lobbying by Nivelle. Robertson was worried about Nivelle forcing the British to attack before the ground dried, although when Haig blamed the poor state of the railways (he demanded twice the railway requirements for half as many troops as the French), <b>he</b> <b>inquired</b> (28 January) whether Haig’s staff had obtained an exaggerated figure by simply adding together the highest estimate of every subordinate formation. Haig demanded a meeting between British and French ministers to resolve matters, although Robertson urged him (14 February) to resolve them in a face-to-face meeting with Nivelle and keep the politicians out of it.|$|E

That party-goer later alleged that, upon being told who she was, Thornton stated that he had been intimate with her sister three times, and would also be with Mary Ashford, or he would die for it. Thornton later denied this statement, which was a major source of the public animus towards him following his arrest. During the course of the evening, he was very attentive to Ashford, and she appeared to enjoy his company.|$|E

500|$|Taylor {{arrived at}} the studio one day {{after a series of}} {{meetings}} began to select the musical pieces for The Concert Feature. Disney made story writers Joe Grant and Dick Huemer gather a preliminary selection of music and along with Stokowski, Taylor, and the heads of various departments, discussed their ideas. Each meeting was recorded verbatim by stenographers with participants being given a copy of the entire conversation for review. As selections were considered, a recording of the piece was located and played back at the next gathering. Disney did not contribute much to early discussions; he admitted that his knowledge of music was instinctive and untrained. In one meeting, <b>he</b> <b>inquired</b> about a piece [...] "on which we might build something of a prehistoric theme... with animals". The group was considering The Firebird by Igor Stravinsky, but Taylor noted that his [...] "Le Sacre du printemps would be something on that order", to which Disney replied upon hearing a recording, [...] "This is marvelous! It would be perfect for prehistoric animals. There would be something terrific in dinosaurs, flying lizards, and prehistoric monsters. There could be beauty in the settings." ...|$|E
500|$|The Fountains {{theme of}} fear of death is [...] "a {{movement}} from darkness into light, from black to white" [...] that traces the journey of a man scared of death and moving toward it. The film begins with a paraphrase of Genesis 3:24, the Biblical passage that reflects The Fall of Man. Hugh Jackman {{emphasized the importance of}} the Fall in the film: [...] "The moment Adam and Eve ate of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, humans started to experience life as we all experience it now, which is life and death, poor and wealthy, pain and pleasure, good and evil. We {{live in a world of}} duality. Husband, wife, we relate everything. And much of our lives are spent not wanting to die, be poor, experience pain. It's what the movie's about." [...] Aronofsky also interpreted the story of Genesis as the definition of mortality for humanity. <b>He</b> <b>inquired</b> of the Fall, [...] "If they had drank from the Tree of Life [...] what would have separated them from their maker? So what makes us human is actually death. It's what makes us special." ...|$|E

500|$|Koussevitzky {{then decided}} to perform all of Sibelius's symphonies in the Boston Symphony's 1932–33 season, with {{the world premiere of}} the Eighth as the culmination. In June 1932 Sibelius wrote to Koussevitzky {{suggesting}} that the Eighth be scheduled for the end of October. A week later he retracted: [...] "I am very disturbed about it. Please do not announce the performance." [...] Further promises, for December 1932 and January 1933, brought forth no scores. Koussevitzky was by now losing hope, yet <b>he</b> <b>inquired</b> once more, in the summer of 1933. Sibelius was evasive; he made no promise of delivery but would [...] "return to the matter at a later date". So far as Koussevitzky and the Boston Symphony were concerned, the matter ended there. Sibelius had made agreements with other conductors; he had promised the European premiere to Basil Cameron and the Royal Philharmonic Society, and the first Finnish performance to Georg Schnéevoigt, who had recently taken over direction of the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra. These arrangements were, however, subject to the illusory Boston premiere, and thus were stillborn. Later in the decade, Eugene Ormandy, a fervent admirer of Sibelius who directed the Philadelphia Orchestra from 1936, is thought to have lobbied strongly for the right to perform the premiere, should the symphony in due course emerge.|$|E
500|$|The band Nirvana {{started to}} become a name in the music scene at the time, {{creating}} [...] "big, seismic shifts in pop culture" [...] according to Yankovic. Yankovic felt that the band's 1991 album Nevermind, which featured [...] "Smells Like Teen Spirit", was [...] "really great", but feared that at its release the band was not popular enough to warrant a parody. By early 1992, Nevermind had reached platinum certification and led the Billboard charts, which led Yankovic to start working on a parody. Yankovic noted {{that much of the}} publicity around Nevermind dealt with the inability to comprehend the songs' lyrics, both in their phrasing {{and the manner in which}} they were sung by the lead vocalist Kurt Cobain. Yankovic decided to use this as the basis for his parody. Yankovic noted, [...] "I try not to go the obvious route all the time, but sometimes the most obvious is actually the best." [...] Yankovic had initial difficulty getting permission for the parody, as his manager claimed he was unable to get through to the group numerous times. When Yankovic learned that Nirvana would be performing on the January 11, 1992 show of Saturday Night Live, he called his UHF co-star, Victoria Jackson, at the time a regular cast member of the show. Jackson got Cobain on the phone so that Yankovic could make his request. Cobain agreed, though initially <b>he</b> <b>inquired</b> if the song would be about food, a common theme in many of Yankovic's songs. Yankovic explained that the song would be about Cobain's incomprehensible lyrics, to which Cobain replied, according to Yankovic, [...] "Oh, sure, of course, that's funny." ...|$|E
