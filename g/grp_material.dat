The yard was {{best known for the}}ir fantastic small wooden boats in the 1960s, and converted to <b>GRP</b> <b>material</b> in 1965. First they updated the present range of Vindö 30, but the newcomer - the 35 ft long Vindö 50 made the little yard famous. The combination of GRP hull and fine quality teak and mahogany structures demanded for newer boats, and the 29 ft long Vindö 32 was launched in 1973. Shortly after came the 31 ft long Vindö 40 - best known for the reversed topsides of the hull. In 1982 came Vindö 45 - a 34 ft long boat with more modern lines - and a greater volume. This was shortly followed by the first of many bankruptcies, and the yard stopped production of new boats in 1990.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe work {{deals with}} the use of <b>GRP</b> <b>material</b> in {{suspension}} electrical insulators. The mechanical behavior of this material is modelized, and the model inserted in a finite element program in order to estimate stress distributions in these composite insulators and describe their failure mode. The material is assumed typically orthothropic with transverse isotropy. A three-dimensional failure criterion, based on the fracture strength along the different axis of the material, is used to predict the location of failure and the distribution of stress components at the occurence of this event. Some elastic properties and strength characteristics of GRP rod were obtained experimentally and used as inputs in the FEM program. The FEM prediction concerning the location and orientation of fracture compares well with the insulator destructive test results.

The bolted joints were failed in tension after being immersed in water at three temperatures for two periods of time. Two joint geometries, defined in terms of end distance and width to bolt diameter, were tested with the pultrusion and tension axes coincident. The reductions in the load capacities of the joints due to the hot–wet conditions were quantified and shown to be very large. For example, it was found that more than 60 % of the load carrying capacity of a single-bolt tension joint was lost after being immersed in water for 6. 5 weeks at 60 °C.

40|$|Current {{techniques}} {{available for}} GRP tank design are time consuming and use either highly analytical formulations {{that are based}} on assumptions, or rely on expensive destructive experimental tests. Because of the variety of loading conditions that these tanks are subjected to when underground, a high factor of safety is usually appied to compensate for discrepancy between theory and practice. This results in sometimes unnecessarily increasing the material cost, wright and manufacturing time. The objective of this work is to find a more deterministic design approach based on experimental and analytical methods in order to predict the properties, integrity and performance of underground GRP tanks. The design methodology is the result of correlation between computational (linear and non-linear FE analysis), analytical and experimental procedures. The methodology should lead to an empirical description for mechanical characteristics of GRP tanks. Once tested it can be proposed as a standard method that can lead to a complete solution for GRP tank design, applied {{to a wide range of}} tank sizes and laminate lay-ups and properties. This replaces the needs for the expensive field tests that are specified in the current standards. It is also expected to prevent the excessive usage of composite material (due to applying high safety factors), and at the same time, prevents the underestimation of the effect of severe loading conditions. In this research <b>GRP</b> <b>material</b> properties used for underground tanks were estimated by using experimental (ie mechanical testing of samples ytaken from GRP tanks), analytical and numerical methods. An empirical description for the determination of elastic properties of <b>GRP</b> <b>material</b> is proposed using FEA method. A series of experiments on full size tanks were designed and tested to generate repeatable data to be used for correlation with simple linear elastic analysis using FEA to establish the validity of FEA as an alternative tool. Correlation between the two types of data showed the correct modelling technique and its limitations. This investigation helped to establish the confidence level required when using a FEA method. Buckling analysis of GRP tanks both experimentally (by vacuum testing of tanks to destruction) and numerically (using geometrically non-linear FEA) was concluded and failure loads and failure modes were compared for all tests with experimental results, British (BS 4995) and European (CEN) standards. Comparison has shown a good agreement with the numerical method, however, both standards results have been shown to be unreliable when used with anisotropic material. An individual investigation of the parameters that contribute to buckling failure has led to the development of an empirical design description for predicting buckling failure of GRP vesels based on a novel and numerical analysis. Finally based on the above work, a complete design methodology is proposed for the design of underground GRP tanks, and a computer program was developed to help the manufacturer to design an optimum vessel for the required application...|$|E
40|$|The Glass fiber Reinforced Plastic (<b>GRP)</b> <b>material</b> is {{considered}} {{as the most}} prominent material for small boat industry due to the convenience of workmanship and light weight. Although the technology of GRP boat construction has been developed immensely {{for the last three}} decades, the technology related to the periodic assessment of GRP hull has not been developed in the same way compared to the steel and aluminum boat construction industry due to the inhomogeneous nature of the GRP structure. At the designing stage of GRP boat, number of factors such as compressive modulus, tensile modulus, ultimate flexural strength, ultimate compressive strength and ultimate tensile strength will be considered {{in order to meet the}} level of performance expected by the end user. However the deterioration of the boat structure with the age, reduces the level of confidence to deploy the boat under same role. In general flexural strength of GRP is measured destructively. However the destructive tests make the structure unusable, as such this study focuses on estimating flexural strength through nondestructive method with the aid of ultrasound technology. The objective of this study; is to develop two independent relationships such as “Number of repeated blows Vs. Percentage Echo height” and “Number of repeated blows Vs.

40|$|AbstractSix {{water mist}} {{suppression}} experiments {{were conducted in}} an ISO 9705 size room lined with GRP panels with a small wooden crib as a fire initiation source. A four-nozzle water mist suppression system was used to extinguish the fires. Heat release rate (HRR) from the fires was measured, as well as: room temperature; wall surface temperature of GRP panels, and; heat flux to the wall at specific locations within the room. The concentration of oxygen, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide was also measured {{in one corner of}} the room. It was found that the mist suppression method used was an effective system for extinguishing fires from 500 kW – 1. 5 MW in magnitude. However, in one experiment in which only a single, centrally located nozzle was used the fire could not be completely extinguished. The <b>GRP</b> <b>material</b> was characterised using thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and cone calorimetry. The TGA results showed that the resin component of the GRP underwent pyrolysis over a temperature range of 225 °C to 450 °C when most of the resin mass was gasified leaving a solid char. The char material was completely consumed over a temperature range of 375 °C to 430 °C when heated in air. The DSC showed that, when heated in air, these two degradation steps released large amounts of energy. Cone calorimetry tests were conducted to measure the combustion behavior of the panel material (e. g. heat release rate (HRR) and time to ignition) when subjected to a constant incident radiant heat flux. The results showed that the panel material was flammable with a peak HRR of between 350 – 400 kW/m 2 and the minimum heat flux for ignition was determined to be 16. 5 kW/m...|$|E
40|$|Equipment and {{components}} {{made of plastics}} and composites are widely used in highly corrosive environments in the processing industry. Examples are the storage tanks, pumps and pipes for chemical transport and stacks in combustion plants. The demand for reliable nondestructive testing of plastic process equipment has increased significantly in recent years. Glass fiber reinforced plastics (GRP) is a common construction material for process equipment in the chemical industry. It can be used both as structural bearing in a dual laminate with a thermoplastic material as a corrosion barrier or as a solid GRP. In the latter case, the laminate is generally built up with a resin rich corrosion barrier (about 2. 5 to 5 mm thick) with a low content of glass closest to the chemical. The glass fiber in this layer is usually a surface veil and chopped strand mats (CSM), i. e. it has no general fiber orientation. Outside this is the structural bearing layer with much higher glass content, usually wound fiber and / or woven fiber mats with a preferential fiber direction. The corrosion barrier is not load bearing and corrosion of this layer can be allowed. However, no corrosion can be permitted in the structural support layer. Because of this {{it is important to}} measure the thickness of the corrosion barrier for quality control but also to determine how far an attack has reached in the corrosion barrier. Today there is no non-destructive testing method that can answer this. Instead destructive sampling (often a drill core) must be made. This is difficult, expensive and sometimes impossible. There is thus a great interest in a method that, preferably at any time during operation, can provide answers to these questions. Due to the heterogeneity of the <b>GRP</b> <b>material</b> in terms of amount, type and direction of the fibers, conventional algorithm for ultrasound imaging will not work. One aim of our work is thus to develop new signal processing methods to handle this heterogeneity.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Non-destructive testing (NDT) of glass-fibre reinforced polyester (<b>GRP)</b> composite <b>materials</b> has been becoming increasingly important due to their wide applications in engineering components and structures. Electronic Speckle Pattern Interferometry (ESPI) has promising potential in this context {{because it is a}} non-contact, whole-field and real-time measurement system. This potential has never been fully exploited and there is only limited knowledge and understanding available in this area. This reality constrains the wide popularity and acceptance of ESPI as a novel NDT technique. Therefore it is of considerable importance to develop an understanding of the capability of ESPI with respect to damage evaluation in <b>GRP</b> composite <b>materials.</b> The research described in this thesis is concerned with an investigation into the applicability of ESPI in the NDT of <b>GRP</b> composite <b>materials.</b> Firstly, a study was carried out to determine excitation techniques in terms of practicality and effectiveness in the ESPI system. Three categories of defects were artificially introduced in <b>GRP</b> composite <b>materials,</b> namely holes, cracks and delaminations each with different geometrical features. ESPI was then employed to evaluate the three kinds of defects individually. It has been found that cracks and holes on back surfaces can be defined when the technique is used in conjunction with thermal excitation. Internal Temperature Differential (ITD) induced fringe patterns were more efficient than External Thermal Source (ETS) induced fringe patterns with regard to detecting the presence of holes and cracks. In the case of delamination, ESPI was found to be capable of detecting the damage when used in combination with mechanical excitation originating from a force transducer hammer. The geometrical features and magnitudes of delaminations were also established as being quantifiable. The validation of ESPI as an NDT technique was carried out in an attempt to establish a better understanding of its suitability and have more confidence in its applications. Four damaged specimens were Subjected to ESPI examination in conjunction with visual inspection, ultrasonic C-scan and sectioning techniques. The geometrical features and magnitudes of damage evaluated using ESPI showed a good correlation with those evaluated by conventional techniques. Poor visibility and readability is an inherent problem associated with ESP! due to an overlapping between the noise and signal frequencies. An improvement of image quality is expected in an attempt to achieve a wide acceptance of ESPI as a novel NDT technique. It has also been demonstrated that this problem can be tackled using optical phase stepping techniques in which optical phase data can be extracted from the intensity fringes. A three-frame optical phase stepping technique was employed to produce the "wrapped" and "unwrapped" phase maps which are capable of indicating internal damage with high visibility and clarity. Finally ESPI was practically employed to evaluate damage in GRP composites introduced by quasi-static and dynamic mechanical loading. It was found that ESP! was capable of monitoring the progressive damage development of specimens subjected to incremental flexural loading. The initial elastic response, damage initiation, propagation and ultimate failure of specimens were clearly characterised by the abnormal fringe pattern variations. In a similar manner, ESPI was employed to evaluate the low velocity falling weight impact induced damage. A correlation was established between the magnitude of damage and the impact event parameters as well as the residual flexural properties...|$|R

40|$|The {{recovery}} and reuse of end-of-life GRP in an environmentally friendly, cost-effective manner {{is one of}} the most important challenges facing the composites industry. In 2015 the global consumption of reinforcement grade E-glass fibre (GF) exceeded 5 million tons. Associated with this global GF consumption is the production of 0. 5 - 1 million tons of GF manufacturing waste most of which is landfilled. Furthermore, approximately 70 % of reinforcement GF is used to manufacture thermoset based composites (GRP) which also produces approximately 15 % manufacturing waste. Consequently it can be shown that there is actually sufficient GF available in current manufacturing waste and end-of-life GRP to meet approximately 50 % of the global demand for GF reinforcements. However, such GF and <b>GRP</b> <b>materials</b> (both end-of-life and manufacturing waste) are difficult to recycle in an efficient manner and have historically also been disposed of in landfills. Such landfilling is rapidly becoming untenable due to legislative and landfill pricing developments. A number of processes for recycling GRP are available or under development. However, nearly all options deliver recycled glass fibres (RGF) which are not cost-performance competitive due to the huge drop in performance of RGF compared to its original state. A breakthrough in the regeneration of RGF performance has the potential to totally transform the economics of recycling GRP waste and end-of-life composites. This presentation will review the status of the ReCoVeR project which is focussed on enabling cost-effective regeneration of the performance and value of glass fibres obtained from thermal recycling of end-of-life GRP and GRP manufacturing waste.

40|$|In {{this work}} the {{mechanical}} behaviour of a core reinforced composite sandwich structure is studied. The sandwich employs a Glass Reinforced Polymer (<b>GRP)</b> orthotropic <b>material</b> {{for both the}} two external skins and the inner core web. In particular, the core is designed in order {{to cooperate with the}} GRP skins in membrane and flexural properties by means of the addition of a corrugated laminate into the foam core. An analytical model has been developed to replace a unit cell of this structure with an orthotropic equivalent thick plate that reproduces the in plane and out of plane behaviour of the original geometry. Different validation procedures have been implemented to verify the quality of the proposed method. At first a comparison has been performed between the analytical model and the original unit cell modelled with a Finite Element mesh. Elementary loading conditions are reproduced and results are compared. Once the reliability of the analytical model was assessed, this homogenised model was implemented within the formulation of a shell finite element. The goal of this step is to simplify the FE analysis of complex structures made of corrugated core sandwiches; in fact, by using the homogenised element, the global response of a real structure can be investigated only with the discretization of its mid-surface. Advantages are mainly in terms of time to solution saving and CAD modelling simplification. Last step is then the comparison between this FE model and experiments made on sandwich beams and panels whose skins and corrugated cores are made of orthotropic cross-ply GRP laminates. Good agreement between experimental and numerical results confirms the validity of the proposed model...|$|R
40|$|E-glass {{has been}} widely used as a {{reinforcing}} material for years, especially as a plastic reinforcer {{in the production of}} GRP (Glass Reinforced Plastic). Failure of <b>GRP</b> <b>materials</b> under stress came in to the picture quite recently. Since then studies have been conducted in an attempt to understand the causes and the underlying behaviour. Except for the last section of the research (analysis using a kinetic approach) where glass fibre was cut out to weigh approximately 1. 0 g, standard sized specimens were soaked in the required acid solutions of desired concentrations for varying temperatures and time frames. Wherever tensile strength retention was measured, LLOYD instrument was employed. Leaching of the cations were analysed using Inductively Coupled Plasma – Optical Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-OES and also know and ICP-AES). The scope of this project can be divided in to four sections; first section involved investigating the effects of malonic acid. The study of malonic acid was narrowed to investigating the trend in strength retention. A rapid strength loss was observed initially followed by a much steady decline in the strength. However the continuation of the loss of strength was unmistakable throughout the time period of exposure. Furthermore, temperature can be observed as a facilitating factor in this degradation reaction. Secondly the corrosive effect of glyoxylic acid on E-glass fibre was studied. This was explored at two different temperatures for two specific time frames using various concentrations of the acid of interest. The influence of this acid on the glass fibre was found out in terms of strength retention and loss of cations from the glass matrix. The mildness of this acid was accentuated by the fact that 70 % or more of the strength was retained at all the conditions employed. A minima in strength retention was observed at 2 M acid concentration similar to the trends observed in the past (Betz and Jones 2003 and Jones and Chandler 1986). Leaching of cations reflected this trend. The large strength retention could be related to the fewer amounts of Ca and K leached from the glass matrix (Kumosa and Qui, 1997). Similar to malonic acid, an unusually large amount of B was leached out that could be due to the favourable orientation of the anion with the trivalent ions during the complex formation. Yet again temperature was found to enhance the degradation process. Next the extent of passivation (if any) showed by malonic acid was investigated using E-glass fibre pre-treated in 5 M malonic acid and post treated in known corrosive acids hydrochloric acid and oxalic acid. Passivation of malonic acid was put to test through examination of strength retention of the fibres under these conditions. This segment was carried out as an extension of a finding (a behaviour synonymous to passivation) shown by malonic that surfaced the previous year by the present researcher. Increasing the pre-treatment time showed a great improvement in the retained strength for all the post-treatment acid mediums. Furthermore, while Jones and Betz (2004) featured 20 - 40 % strength retention within a short time frame in 3 M HCl, the immense amount of strength retention (60 - 70 %) preceding pre-treatment should definitely be noted. Similarly strength retention of about 80 % was observed when post-treated with the severely corrosive oxalic acid. Hence its is clear that passivation can be induced through prolonged pre-treatment in 5 M malonic acid that could inhibit the attack of corrosive acid at least {{for a period of time}}. The last fragment of the study focussed on understanding and working out the mechanism behind the reactions between the E-glass fibre and acid medium in terms of kinetics. The acids utilized were 1. 5 M malonic acid and 3 M glyoxylic acid and the assessments were made through the analysis of the weight changes brought about by the acid medium at various temperatures and time frames. In addition leaching patterns of cations were evaluated as this could contribute in achieving the objective. Maximum weight loss reached 4 % in glyoxylic acid while that for malonic acid exceeded 20 %. The general trend was that the glass fibres lost weight in both acids for a period of time followed by an evident weight gain. Furthermore the weight loss results fit the first order rate law. While the leaching of cations reflects the weight loss for the shorter time frames, steady loss of ions was visible even for the longer time frames where the weight has increased. The weight gain could be explained in terms of binding of anions to certain cations on the glass surface, accounting for the hindrance in the loss of cations at the longer time frames as well. About 50 % of weight loss was associated to Ca while 20 % was to Al, leaving 6 % to B where as the rest of the ions had shown almost insignificant contribution to the weight loss...|$|R
40|$|The {{interaction}} of microorganisms with glass-reinforced polyester resins(GRP), both under laboratory and simulated operating conditions, has been examined following reports of severl! fungal biodeterioration. Although GRP was not previously associated with substantial microbial growth, {{small amounts of}} microbial activity would pose problems for products associated with comestible materials. The microbiology of the raw materials was investigated, two ingredients were supportive to microbial populations whilst five materials were biostatic or inhibitory in their action. Production laminate was not susceptible to microbial deterioration or inhibitory to microbes. Incorporation of zinc stearate, one of the supportive ingredients, at 300 % manufacturing level or drastic undercuring produced laminate capable of supporting microbial growth but only after a non-biotic stage of degradation. Study of the long-term population dynamics of cisterns of <b>GRP</b> and competitive <b>materials</b> under conditions simulating in-service conditions, monitoring microbial numbers within the experimental vessels and comparing with the populations of the supply water, suggests that the performance of GRP cisterns is slightly superior to conventional competitive materials. An investigation of the biological performance of GRP cisterns in an isolated area of known microbiological hazard was conducted. Severe biodeterioration had been experienced with Preform GRP articles moulded using different production techniques, but substitution of current GRP articles resulted in no recurrence of the problem. All attempts to establish the fungal isolate responsible for the phenomena in cisterns under controlled conditions failed. Scanning Electron Microscopy of GRP surfaces showed that although differences exist between current and Preform laminates, these could not satisfactorily explain the differences in service behaviour.

40|$|Installation of seabed {{equipment}} represents {{approximately one}} third of the capital expenditures (CAPEX) for subsea developments. This report is based on investigating into new designs of subsea production system (SPS) structures that can appear to be cost-effective concerning seabed installation. Firstly, the principle of modularization of subsea production structures is considered. Secondly, an investigation into the use of non-metallic materials for construction elements in the subsea structures is carried out. Thus, in addition to the already existing integrated template structure (ITS), a new modularized tight cluster design, called X-Cat, is regarded through the report. Due to the high weight and large footprint of an ITS, only large and costly vessels can be mobilized for the installation of the structure. However, the X-Cat contains smaller modules, which increases the potential of the possibility of using smaller and lighter installation vessels. If the unit-weight of the limiting X-Cat module is reduced accordingly, it will increase the potential of using even smaller and lighter installation vessels. The first approach in the investigation was to suggest three new designs with lower unit-weights for the limiting X-Cat module. The suggested designs were developed by changing the material of selected construction elements from steel to fiberglass, which would reduce the unit-weight significantly. Furthermore, installation cost estimations were performed for the installation of the suggested designs and, subsequently, the effect of reducing vessel size was demonstrated by cost comparisons. In addition, as the alternative structures contained suction anchor technology, a further sensitivity analysis on suction anchor installations with regards to critical pressures were carried out. From the results, installation duration estimates demonstrated that a single ITS could be installed almost twice as fast as a single X-Cat. However, it was observed that if SPS construction elements could be designed in glass-reinforced plastic (GRP) instead of steel, the structures could {{have a positive impact on}} the installation costs, as smaller and lighter vessels from a much larger vessel pool could potentially be mobilized for the operations. Concerning the sensitivity analysis on suction anchor installations, the results demonstrated that the suction caisson belonging to the X-Cat should be designed with significantly larger skirt thickness relative to the ITS suction anchors. This report concludes that a material change from steel to fiberglass in construction elements for a modularized SPS design will reduce the unit weight of the structure, and further reduce the installation design load; by reducing the weight of the structure by using <b>GRP</b> as construction <b>material,</b> the corresponding installation cost reduction of the X-Cat could potentially exceed 50 %. Further work should involve looking into the manufacturing costs of SPS construction elements made in GRP. It should also include an evaluation and assessment concerning the seastate of large fiberglass structures during subsea installations. </p...|$|R
