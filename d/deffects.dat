But {{it was decided}} that the ship was put into operation on 1 October 1949. In October, The steamer commenced maiden voyage after repair and was carrying cargo for fishermen. Most of the crewmembers were newcomers and came out at sea for the first time. On the first day the ship entered the gale which did not stop for a few days. The waves flooded the deck, parted the tackle, but the people did not leave their posts. Steering gear was damaged during the storm. The team repaired it immediately and underway. Also other <b>deffects</b> of other mechanisms were mended underway. When the northern areas received supply, the ship went to Ossorsk and Ukinsk combines, where they met a heavy solid ice. Successfully overcoming it, the ship arrived at the scheduled points timely. The annual plan of 1949 year was completed by this voyage anticipatorily. The best crew members received commendation due to excellent voyage management.|$|E

The ethambutol-induced red-green colour vision <b>deffect</b> in goldfish was argued to {{originate in the}} retina because after ethambutol application: (1) inhibitive interactions in red-green (double) opponent ganglion cells are lost [Van Dijk & Spekreijse, 1982 (Investigative Ophthalmology and Visual Science, 24, 128 – 133); Wietsma & Spekreijse, 1992 (Investigative Ophthalmology and Visual Science Suppl., 33, 1032) ] and (2) the depolarizing responses to red light in the biphasic horizontal cells are reduced. To account for these findings Spekreijse, Wietsma and Neumeyer [(1991) Vision Research, 31, 551 – 562] suggested that ethambutol induced dark adaptation in the retina. In this paper the dark adaptation hypothesis is tested with the following results:(1) ethambutol changes only transiently the receptive field size and spectral sensitivity of horizontal cells;(2) the spectral characteristics of horizontal cells do not change in long-term ethambutol-treated goldfish;(3) formation of spinules on horizontal cell dendrites in cone terminals, a parameter for light adaptation, remains unaffected.

For the Gulf Stream in the North Atlantic Ocean, weakly and strongly <b>deffected</b> paths near the coast of South Carolina have been observed. This suggests that bimodal behavior may occur in the Gulf Stream as well, although less pronounced than in the Kuroshio. Evidence from a high resolution ocean general circulation model (OGCM) and intermediate complexity models is given to support the hypothesis that multiple mean paths of both the Kuroshio and the Gulf Stream are dynamically possible. These paths are found as multiple steady states in an intermediate complexity shallow-water model. In the OGCM, transitions between similar mean paths are found, with the patterns having similarity to the ones in the observations as well. To study whether atmospheric noise can induce transitions between the multiple steady states, a stochastic component is added to the annual mean wind stress forcing in the intermediate complexity model and differences between the transition behavior in the Gulf Stream and Kuroshio are considered...|$|R

Using this system, {{it was possible}} to identify tumor suppressor p 27 as a repressor of Sox 2 during differentiation. This led to the demonstration that defects in the repression of Sox 2 can contribute to tumor development. The members of the retinoblastoma family of pocket proteins, pRb, p 107 and p 130, are negative regulators of the cell cycle with tumor suppressor activity and with roles in differentiation. In this work we studied the relative contribution of the retinoblastoma family members to the regulation of Sox 2 expression. We found that deletion of Rb or p 130 leads to impaired repression of Sox 2, a <b>deffect</b> amplified by inactivation of p 53. We also identified binding of pRb and p 130 to an enhancer with crucial regulatory activity on Sox 2 expression. Using cellular reprogramming we tested the impact of the defective repression of Sox 2 and confirmed that Rb deficiency allows the generation of iPSCs in the absence of exogenous Sox 2. Finally, partial depletion of Sox 2 positive cells reduced the pituitary tumor development initiated by Rb loss in vivo.

40|$|Abstract. It {{was found}} that osmium {{introduced}} into a polynucleotide chain represents a suitable electroactive marker, which can be very sensitively detected by means of differential pulse polarography. Osmium-containing single-stranded DNA yields several reduction DPP peaks, one of them probably being of a catalytic nature. The height of this peak depends linearly on the concentration of denatured DNA {{in the range of}} 0. 5 — 200 fig/ml. Single-stranded synthetic polynucleotides containing pyrimidine bases behave in a similar way. Homopolynucleotides con taining only purine bases are inactive. Up to now it has been supposed that native double-helical DNA (in contrast to single-stranded DNA) does not react with Os 0 4. It was demonstrated in this study that double-helical DNA reacts to a certain extent with O s 0 4 : the extent of the modification of double-helical DNA depends on the content of structural <b>deffects</b> (double-stranded distorted regions) in the DNA molecule. Suitable conditions for the modification of both native and denatured DNA with O s 0 4 and conditions for their DPP measurement were found.

Manganese concentrations and POE in YOL declined markedly and rapidly in plants transferred to solutions without manganese, while chlorophyll concentrations of YOL and plant DM yield responded more weakly and more slowly. As a result, a level of manganese deficiency which depressed POE in young leaves by more than 50 per cent had no effed on DM production. In youngleaves (YOL, YOL + 1, YOL- 1), POE declined when their manganese concentrations were < 20 μg g - 1 DM. Iron supply did not affect this rdationship. When learn with < 20 μg Mn g - 1 DM were detached and incubated for 24 h in solutions containing high concentrations of manganese, their POE increased to normal rates; leaves with higher manganese concentrations did not respond. It is suggested that the value of 20 μg Mn g - 1 DM is the functional manganese requirement for POE in young subterranean clover leaves It is also suggested that this value may be used as a critical value for indicating manganese deficiency in subterranean clover. Functional nutrient requirements determined in this way by correlation of nutrient concentrations in young leaves with their biochemical or physiological activities appear to offer more accurate and consistent standards for use an critical values for diagnosis of plant nutrient status than do the critical values determined in the usual way by correlation with plant dry weight...|$|R
