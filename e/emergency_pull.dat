5000|$|<b>Emergency</b> <b>pull</b> switchPoOps (Emergency power off, EPO) sends an EPO {{signal to}} every I/O channel, then turns off {{power to the}} {{processor}} complex. Because EPO bypasses the normal sequencing of power down, damage can result, and the EPO control has a mechanical latch {{to ensure that a}} customer engineer inspects the equipment before attempting to power it back on.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike {{nursing homes}} or assisted-living communities, {{independent}} retirement living communities {{do not provide}} skilled nursing or assistance with daily activities such as bathing, dressing, eating, or taking medication. However, residents of Holiday Retirement can use outside home health care services to meet additional needs. Holiday Retirement apartments also include <b>emergency</b> <b>pull</b> cords that notify managers of emergency situations.|$|E
6000|$|Then came a {{day when}} the {{strength}} was gone from the hand, and the mind wandered, and the tongue babbled pathetic incoherences. This was a sore dilemma for the poor aunts. There were no love-notes for the mother. They {{did not know what to}} do. Hester began a carefully studied and plausible explanation, but lost the track of it and grew confused; suspicion began to show in the mother's face, then alarm. Hester saw it, recognized the imminence of the danger, and descended to the <b>emergency,</b> <b>pulling</b> herself resolutely together and plucking victor from the open jaws of defeat. In a placid and convincing voice she said: ...|$|R
25|$|Baller (2006) {{examines}} {{family dynamics}} and mobilization for the Revolution in central Massachusetts. He reports that warfare and the farming culture were sometimes incompatible. Militiamen found that {{living and working}} on the family farm had not prepared them for wartime marches and the rigors of camp life. Rugged individualism conflicted with military discipline and regimentation. A man's birth order often influenced his military recruitment, as younger sons went to war and older sons {{took charge of the}} farm. A person's family responsibilities and the prevalent patriarchy could impede mobilization. Harvesting duties and family <b>emergencies</b> <b>pulled</b> men home regardless of the sergeant's orders. Some relatives might be Loyalists, creating internal strains. On the whole, historians conclude the Revolution's effect on patriarchy and inheritance patterns favored egalitarianism.|$|R
5000|$|... "Red Cord Cards" [...] help {{to improve}} safety in {{accessible}} toilets. The cards created by Euan's Guide {{are designed to}} be easily attached to <b>emergency</b> red <b>pull</b> cords in toilets. They inform people of the importance of leaving the cords untied and reaching {{all the way to the}} floor.|$|R
5000|$|The tunnel {{was opened}} on 27 March 1980. [...] When it opened, it was Norway's longest road tunnel. [...] Eikefet has rated poorly in safety testing by the European Tunnel Assessment Programme. This {{is due to}} long {{distances}} between <b>emergency</b> <b>pull</b> off areas and emergency phones; poor lighting; few escape routes; poor fire safety; and lanes that are only 3 m wide.|$|E
50|$|Medical {{gas supply}} systems in hospitals, {{and most other}} {{healthcare}} facilities, are essential for supplying piped oxygen, nitrous oxide, nitrogen/surgical air, carbon dioxide, oxygen/nitrous oxide 50/50, medical vacuum, anaesthetic gas scavenge/waste anesthetic gas disposal and medical air to {{various parts of the}} facility. Source equipment systems are monitored by central/source alarm systems, at the point of supply with multiplexed repeater alarms throughout the facility and for monitoring high and low gas pressure in particular areas such as general ward, operating theatres, ICU/ITU/CCU/NICU, recovery, major treatment rooms, etc. Equipment is connected to the medical gas supply system via station outlets. For emergency gas control area zone service valves are installed in order to prevent contaminated gas going to patient or to stop gas flowing to an area in the event of fire. Valves are positioned at the entrance to all departments and can be accessed via <b>emergency</b> <b>pull</b> out windows.|$|E
5|$|A release {{mechanism}} was provided on the gas-bag, such that, in an <b>emergency,</b> a <b>pull</b> on the attached rope would release hydrogen from the gas-bag. This rope {{was attached to}} ballast, {{so that it would}} also be activated automatically {{in the case of a}} catastrophic loss of ballast. Failure to attach this rope was to play a pivotal role in the loss of the Patrie.|$|R
50|$|In large ships, an <b>emergency</b> {{stop button}} <b>pulls</b> the {{countershaft}} for the fuel pumps to the stop position, {{cutting off the}} fuel supply and stopping the engines. With a controllable-pitch propeller, the stop button may declutch the engine from the propeller.|$|R
50|$|The runaway {{cars had}} {{travelled}} {{for almost three}} kilometres before they ploughed into the incoming express, and the speed was probably around 60 km/h. The express train was moving at 70-75 km/h, {{in spite of its}} <b>emergency</b> brake being <b>pulled</b> in the seconds before the collision.|$|R
5000|$|On 27 February 2002, {{the train}} was stopped outside Godhra Junction railway station because of the <b>emergency</b> chain being <b>pulled.</b> The train was then {{attacked}} and four coaches were burned by a large mob. It has been alleged that the attack {{was the result of}} a conspiracy hatched by local Muslims.|$|R
50|$|Around 7:10 AM the <b>emergency</b> cord was <b>pulled</b> on {{the local}} train Groningen-Zwolle. The traindriver, Hans Braam, was {{immediately}} murdered. When {{on the third day}} the Dutch government had not given the hijackers what they wanted, 22-year-old national serviceman Leo Bulter was murdered and both bodies were thrown out of the train on the rails. That night 14 hostages managed to escape from the train.|$|R
50|$|The <b>emergency</b> brake was <b>pulled,</b> and {{the train}} {{came to a stop}} a {{thousand}} or so meters from the blast, 8 kilometers from the northern entrance and 10 from the southern. Train conductor Gian Claudio Bianconcini - on his last journey before retiring - was wounded in the nape of his neck, but managed to reach a service telephone and call for help. Passengers were scared and stranded in the cold Apennines' winter.|$|R
5000|$|Helicopters {{were first}} {{introduced}} {{to the role of}} air-sea rescue in the 1940s. The United States Coast Guard (USCG) was the first agency to evaluate the potential of helicopter rescue assistance, beginning in 1938. USCG Commander William J. Kossler witnessed a helicopter demonstration flight by Igor Sikorsky, flying the Vought-Sikorsky VS-300, equipped with pontoons for water landings and at once saw the advantages of helicopter-equipped search and rescue squadrons. Two early Sikorsky R-4s were acquired in 1941, and training was initiated at Coast Guard Station Brooklyn in New York. In 1942, Royal Air Force and Royal Navy fliers trained in Brooklyn after which the British bought a large number of [...] "hoverflies" [...] from Sikorsky to re-organize 705 Naval Air Squadron. The first helicopter air-sea rescue was carried out in 1946 when a Sikorsky S-51 being demonstrated to the U.S. Navy was used in an <b>emergency</b> to <b>pull</b> a downed Navy pilot from the ocean.|$|R
50|$|On October 24, 2004, Bradley Harrison {{was driving}} an SUV {{with a friend}} near Kirkland Lake, Ontario. They were driving from Vancouver to Toronto. Constable Bertoncello of the Ontario Provincial Police {{observed}} that the vehicle had no front license plate, an offence if the car is registered in Ontario. Bertoncello activated his <b>emergency</b> lights and <b>pulled</b> the car over. He then realized the vehicle was registered in Alberta and was not required to have a front license plate. He was also informed by radio dispatch that the vehicle had been rented in Vancouver. At that time, Bertoncello has no grounds to believe any offence was being committed.|$|R
50|$|As {{soon as the}} {{conductor}} leaves the car, Sylvester proceeds to stack various articles of baggage to reach Tweety's cage. When Sylvester tries to grab Tweety again, Tweety finds the <b>emergency</b> cord, and <b>pulls</b> it, but causes the train to screech to an instant halt and sends poor Sylvester sailing through the air across several passenger cars, until he lands in the engine's furnace with the tender behind it. Sylvester quickly leaps out the firebox and runs back to the baggage car, and as he angrily stalks Tweety, Tweety pulls the cord again, and restarts the train, but sends Sylvester through the air into a garbage can lid that Tweety hinds. Sylvester starts chasing Tweety, but is stopped by {{the conductor}}, who interrupts the chase and orders Sylvester back into his cage.|$|R
40|$|Social media {{transformed}} {{the process of}} crisis communication. This technology enables the user to communicate with emergency officials {{as well as the}} whole virtual world in a click of a button. The emergence of social media in emergency management and its role in raising situational awareness is growing tremendously, making it important for emergency officials to better understand the users 2 ̆ 7 needs and perceptions. ^ This study 2 ̆ 7 s goal is {{to gain a better understanding}} of the expectations and perceptions that Purdue associates have regarding the use of social media as it relates to emergencies. The set of interviews conducted in this study provided several insights into the research question as well as direct implications for Purdue emergency officials who seek to utilize social media during emergencies. The findings of this study indicated that there are three main factors that influence the user 2 ̆ 7 s decision to resort to social media, which are proximity, severity, and the number of people affected by the emergency. The research findings also demonstrated that people resort to social media during times of need to cope, reach a large crowd, to gain information from unfiltered points of view, and for guidance and direction. Moreover, depending on the type of <b>emergency,</b> users <b>pull</b> or push information, as well as cross check information with other sources. ...|$|R
40|$|Hospitals are {{now using}} {{electronic}} medical records and computer applications {{in order to provide}} more efficient and thorough care for their patients. The Mobile Emergency Triage system provides doctors with decision support for <b>emergency</b> care by <b>pulling</b> information from a patient's health record and a medical literature database. In order to achieve compliance with privacy legislations PIPEDA and PHIPA, security and privacy measures must be put in place. A new encryption technology called policy-based encryption proves to be quite useful within a health care environment for providing both encryption and access control. We describe a current policy-based encryption system to be used by MET-A 3 Support [...] -a multi-agent clinical decision support system. We offer a Java implementation of the policy-based encryption algorithms. We also give details about how this system will be integrated with MET-A 3 Support to protect the privacy of patient health information...|$|R

5000|$|... watchOS 3.0 was {{announced}} at WWDC 2016, with a priority on performance. Users {{are able to}} keep apps running in memory as well as receive background updates and refreshed information. Other updates include a new Dock invoked with the side button to replace the performance-laden Glances, an updated Control Center, and new reply options on Messages. Several new watch faces have also been added, including Minnie Mouse, along {{with the ability to}} switch watch faces from the lock screen simply by swiping. A new feature called SOS allows users to hold the dock button to make a call to the local <b>emergency</b> line and <b>pull</b> up the user's Medical ID. Another feature is Activity Sharing, which allows sharing of workouts with friends and even sending their heartbeats to one another. A new app called Breathe guides users through breathing exercises throughout the day, with visuals and haptic feedback. watchOS 3.0 was released to developers on June 13, 2016 and was made available to the public on September 13, 2016.|$|R
5000|$|The {{fire started}} {{approximately}} one minute after impact and an oxygen bottle behind the First Officer's seat leaked, {{contributing to the}} strength of the fire. Despite a dislocated shoulder, First Officer Warmerdam used the cockpit fire axe to cut through the thick cockpit glass. David McCorkell, a surviving passenger, later assisted by pulling the axe out of the cockpit through the hole Warmerdam had created and struck the glass from the outside in order to increase the size of the hole and help Warmerdam escape. While he was being rescued, Warmerdam said to fire chief Steve Chadwick, [...] "Tell my wife, Amy, that I love her." [...] Chadwick replied, [...] "No sir, you tell her that you love her, because I'm getting you out of here." [...] The <b>emergency</b> crews successfully <b>pulled</b> Warmerdam out of the aircraft, but Captain Gannaway was knocked unconscious in the crash landing and never regained consciousness, eventually succumbing to the fire. In an ambulance, Warmerdam consoled paramedic Joan Crawford, who believed Warmerdam would soon die. Crawford had undressed him to cool him down and pinned his badge to his underwear, to help with identification later. Despite his injuries, Warmerdam survived the plane crash.|$|R
