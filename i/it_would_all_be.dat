500|$|The {{atmosphere}} in the studio was described by contributor Evian Christ as [...] "very focused," [...] and West once again brought in several close collaborators. Producer Hudson Mohawke noted the inclusive [...] "group" [...] atmosphere of the sessions, in which multiple contributors would work on similar pieces, with different elements ultimately selected from each. All involved were given a song to work on and return {{the next day to}} sit and critique, a process Anthony Kilhoffer compared to an art class. Producer Arca described being initially asked to send West music, noting that [...] "I made sure to send maybe the strangest stuff I had, and it just so happened that Kanye was excited by that." [...] Describing West's collaborative style, Arca stated:It was a lot of coming up with design, like solving riddles. If the song called for something aggressive, it was up to three or four people to design what in their head was the best solution for that aggression in that moment. Everyone would approach it in completely different ways, and ultimately, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>all</b> <b>be</b> edited by Kanye himself. In a weird way, he kind of produced it. Not only did he select it, but he stylized it. Determined to [...] "undermine the commercial," [...] several tracks were left off the finished product that were deemed too melodic or more in line with West's previous material. West set parameters regarding sound and style, insisting that there be no [...] "bass wobbles" [...] reminiscent of dubstep. The album's recording process was described as [...] "very raw" [...] by Thomas Bangalter of the French electronic duo Daft Punk, who produced four songs for the album, adding that West was [...] "rapping – kind of screaming primally, actually." [...] While previous albums, particularly Dark Fantasy, took considerable time in the studio, Yeezus was described by Kilhoffer as [...] "the fastest record we ever made." [...] In May 2013, Def Jam executives listened to the [...] "final product," [...] (only later to be changed) describing the album as [...] "dark." ...|$|E

60|$|Maybe {{a certain}} Grössenwahn is {{inherent}} in the German nature. If only nations would realize that they have certain natural characteristics, if only they could understand and agree to each other's particular nature, how much simpler <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>all</b> <b>be.</b>|$|E

60|$|From Madura, {{after some}} repose {{and on a}} {{convenient}} day, Mr. Jones and party would make the real start. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>all</b> <b>be</b> plain sailing. Schomberg undertook to provision the boat. The greatest hardship the voyagers need apprehend would be a mild shower of rain. At that season of the year there were no serious thunderstorms.|$|E

6000|$|... "If {{they only}} could go away together, somewhere," [...] said Miss Panney to herself, [...] "that would be grand; that would settle everything. It {{would not be}} long before Dora and Miriam would be the dearest of chums, and with Ralph's sister away, that Drane girl would have to go. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>all</b> <b>be</b> so natural, so plain, so beautiful." ...|$|E

60|$|The {{sight of}} the ballroom, with its gleaming floor, gave her a feeling of joy, of triumph, for she loved dancing, and when dancing she floated, so light was she, like a strenuous, eager little spirit. He would surely ask her to dance, and if he danced with her <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>all</b> <b>be</b> as it was before. She looked about her eagerly.|$|E
60|$|A bright-eyed {{young woman}} {{of five or}} six and twenty in a pink print appeared, a little flushed from cooking, and wiped a hand on an apron and shook hands and smiled, and said <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>all</b> <b>be</b> ready in a minute. She went on to say she had heard of Kipps and his luck, and {{meanwhile}} Sid vanished to draw the beer, and returned with two glasses for himself and Kipps.|$|E
6000|$|If Louisa recovered, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>all</b> <b>be</b> well again. More than former {{happiness}} {{would be}} restored. There {{could not be}} a doubt, to her mind there was none, of what would follow her recovery. A few months hence, and the room now so deserted, occupied but by her silent, pensive self, might be filled again with all that was happy and gay, all that was glowing and bright in prosperous love, all that was most unlike Anne Elliot! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I knew <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>all</b> {{right from}} the first time you spoke to me! Yes, indeed, I knew {{directly}} you came up to me that evening. I knew <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>all</b> right, if you only cared to make it so; but of course I could not tell if you meant it. 'Command me,' you said. Funny thing for a man like you to say. Did you really mean it? You weren't making fun of me?" ...|$|R

60|$|On a {{circular}} piece of iron four {{inches in diameter}} and pierced by the pole for the tang of the blade, poor K----, who died last Friday, had sketched {{the figure of a}} coolie trying to fold up a cloth which was bellying to a merry breeze--not a cold wind, but a sportive summer gust. The coolie was enjoying the performance, and so was the cloth. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>all</b> <b>be</b> folded up in another minute and the coolie would go on his way with a grin.|$|E
60|$|So I passed on, {{through the}} old, low, broad-eaved houses that cringe {{down to the}} very street, {{out into the open}} again. The air was fierce and savage. On one side was a moorland, level; on the other a sweep of naked hill, curved concave, and {{sprinkled}} with snow. I could see how wonderful <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>all</b> <b>be,</b> under five or six feet of winter snow, skiing and tobogganing at Christmas. But it needed the snow. In the summer there is to be seen nothing but the winter's broken detritus.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, but listen!" [...] {{continued}} Mr. Moss. [...] "You do {{not know}} how the profits run away into the pockets of impresarios and lessees and money-lenders. We should have it all ourselves. I have £30,000 of my own, and my respectable parent in New York has as much more. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>all</b> <b>be</b> the same as ours. Only think! Before long we would have a house on the Fifth Avenue so furnished that all the world should wonder; and another at Newport, where the world should not be admitted to wonder. Only think!" ...|$|E

5000|$|... "I've {{always dreamed}} of playing for a top club abroad, but I could have stayed at Kyiv, picked up an injury and <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>all</b> have <b>been</b> over for me.

6000|$|My horror passed insensibly. I have to {{feel the}} dreadfulness of these things, I told myself, because {{it is good for}} such a {{creature}} as I to feel them dreadful, but if one understood <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>all</b> <b>be</b> simple. Not dreadful at all. I clung to that and repeated it,--"it would all be perfectly simple." [...] It would come out no more horrible than the things that used to frighten me as a child,--the shadow on the stairs, the white moonrise reflected on a barked and withered tree, a peculiar dream of moving geometrical forms, an ugly illustration in the [...] "Arabian Nights." ...|$|E
60|$|It was a ray {{of light}} upon all Marian's perplexities; showing her what course to take, and filling her with hope. Her {{confidence}} in Edmund's power of setting everything right was still unchanged, and when Gerald's case was fully before him, he would know how to judge, and what to do; <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>all</b> <b>be</b> safe and off her mind. She felt sure that this had been the very reason of his writing; and full of gratitude, and infinitely relieved, she opened her desk, as if to answer was the easiest and most comfortable thing in the world.|$|E
6000|$|... "That ugly bottle {{looked like}} gold and {{diamonds}} when I {{found it in}} Fairyland," [...] said Randal, [...] "and the water in it smelled as sweet as roses. But when I touched my eyes with it, a drop that ran into my mouth was as salt as the sea, and immediately everything changed: the gold bottle became this glass thing, and the fairies became like folk dead, and the sky grew grey, and all turned waste and ugly. That's the way with fairy gold, nurse; and if you found it, even, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>all</b> <b>be</b> dry leaves and black bits of coal before the sun set." ...|$|E
5000|$|The old {{ruling class}} {{came back with}} new ideas and new outlooks which were attuned to {{economic}} growth and expansion and facilitated {{in the long run}} the development of a fully capitalist economy. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>all</b> have <b>been</b> very different if Charles I had not been obliged to summon that Parliament to meet at Westminster on November 3rd, 1640.|$|R
