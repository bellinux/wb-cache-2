A nuclear island, an {{evolution of the}} integral fast reactor, utilizes all the Transuranics (Pu plus minor actinides) produced in power production, and it eliminates all spent fuel shipments {{to and from the}} site. This latter attribute requires that fuel reprocessing occur on each site and that fast reactors be built on-site to utilize the TRU. All commercial spent fuel shipments could be eliminated by converting all LWR nuclear power sites to nuclear islands. Existing LWR sites have the added advantage of already possessing a license to produce nuclear power. Each could contribute to an increase in the nuclear power production by adding one or more fast reactors. Both the TRU and the depleted uranium obtained in reprocessing would be used on-site for fast fuel manufacture. Only fission products would be shipped to a repository for storage.

Carcass price was principally associated with body mass, with little evidence that taxonomic group (primate, rodent, ungulate, or mammalian carnivore) affected price. Moreover, meat condition was not consistently associated with price. However, some individual species were more expensive throughout the region than would be expected for their size. Prices were weakly positively correlated with human settlement size and were highest in urban areas. Supply did not increase proportionally as human settlement size increased, such that per capita supply was significantly lower in urban centers than in rural areas.

However, in spite of their well-recognized robustness and potential as a source of calories and protein for populations in drought-prone and marginal areas, cultivation is in decline and there is a high risk of genetic erosion. [Scope] In this review, current and past taxonomic treatments of the Lathyrus genus are assessed and its current status is examined together with future prospects for germplasm conservation, characterization and utilization. A particular emphasis is placed on the importance of diversity analysis for breeding of L. sativus and L. cicera. [Conclusions] Efforts for improvement of L. sativus and L. cicera should concentrate on the development of publicly available joint core collections, and on high-resolution genotyping.

How such a behavioral shift is hormonally controlled remains unknown. The possible involvement of corticosterone and prolactin was examined by characterizing the nutritional and hormonal states of king penguins at egg abandonment. Further, we tested if these states differ according to whether an egg or a chick is abandoned, {{and according to the}} timing of breeding. In every case of abandonment, birds were in phase III fasting characterized by accelerated protein catabolism. However, body condition at egg abandonment was lower in early than in late breeders, suggesting that king penguins are willing to tolerate a larger energy depletion when their potential breeding success is high. At egg and chick abandonment, plasma corticosterone levels were, respectively, increased by 2 - and 4 -fold, whereas plasma prolactin levels were, respectively, depressed by 3 - and 1. 4 -fold. The increase in plasma corticosterone and the decrease in plasma prolactin could be involved in the control of abandonment by, respectively, stimulating the drive to re-feed and diminishing the drive to incubate or brood. The smaller decrease in prolactin levels and the greater increase in corticosterone levels observed at chick vs egg abandonment suggest that, in addition to nutritionally-related stimuli, tactile or audible stimuli from the egg or chick could intervene in the endocrine control of abandonment...|$|R

40|$|Penguins {{are often}} {{considered}} to be as ecologically and behaviourally homogenous as their morphology. Their structural morphology and associated physiological adaptations are governed by the demands of operating as flightless, subsurface marine predators. However, within the very strict constraints of this lifeform, penguins show considerable ecological and behavioural heterogeneity, although some of this undoubtedly relates to the range of latitudes and biotopes in which penguins breed. In this paper we: (i) briefly summarise and review {{some of the main}} features of the breeding biology, ecology and demography of penguins; (ii) identify consistent patterns across species in the grouping of these features – and highlight anomalies; (iii) suggest explanations/hypotheses for some of the potential links between ecology, behaviour and demography within these groupings; (iv) investigate six topics containing potential paradoxes, namely: migration, fasting, mate fidelity, brood reduction, demography and duration of breeding seasons. We conclude that in many biological and ecological traits penguins can be divided into two groups: (i) resident species, feeding inshore with short <b>fasts</b> ashore, <b>breeding</b> at an early age and having low divorce rates, and; (ii) migrant species, feeding offshore with long <b>fasts</b> ashore, <b>breeding</b> at older ages and having higher divorce rates. The placement of Magellanic Spheniscus magellanicus and Gentoo Pygoscelis papua Penguins in opposite groups to their congeners is particularly intriguing. We suggest that trade-offs between the year-round abundance and predictability of prey and the latitudinally-influenced time available for breeding are important determinants of these patterns. Considerably improved basic biological and ecological data on penguins and careful testing of explicit hypotheses will be required to investigate further both the suggested patterns and the remaining paradoxes...|$|R

The approach used in this thesis {{is a combination of}} the above mentioned genetic approach with classical conditioning experiments. The genetic techniques are by far best possible in mice because of their <b>fast</b> <b>breeding</b> and the availability of genetically well characterized inbred strains. Often gene function is tested by creating transgenic or knockout mice. In transgenic mice, artiﬁcial DNA is introduced in the genome of a mouse, which will lead to expression of the transgene in the adult animal. In knockout mice a targeted gene is completely deleted from the genome. The protein that was coded by this gene will no longer be expressed. To be able to study the effect of genetic lesions on classical conditioning we needed a system that could reliably measure the performance of a mouse on such a learning task. Some studies using mice in eyeblink conditioning tasks already existed. All these studies used electromyographic (EMG) recordings of the MOO muscle to assess responsiveness on the training paradigm. Attempts to repeat this procedure led to the realization that to obtain reliable EMG recordings of the MOO muscle in a mouse over a number of consecutive days is close to impossible, simply because of the small size of a mouse eyelid. We therefore developed a new system that could reliably measure eyelid position over time in mice.

In Britain over this peri-od, the ranges of several species have contracted and expanded again with the rise and partial decline in game preservation, with temporary expansions during two wars wh, en gamekeepers were otherwise employed. Persecution is still restricting the breeding range of the Golden Eagle, the Buzzard, and the Hen Harrier in the British Isles to about half the potential.

Recovery rates were as high (or higher) for some Eu-ropean raptors as for many game-bird and waterfowl populations exposed to regular hunting seasons.

40|$|For smaller organisms with <b>faster</b> <b>breeding</b> cycles, {{artificial}} selection {{can be used}} to create sub-populations with different phenotypic traits. Genetic tests can be employed to identify the causal markers for the phenotypes, as a precursor to engineering strains with a combination of traits. Traditional approaches involve analyzing crosses of inbred strains to test for co-segregation with genetic markers. Here we take advantage of cheaper next generation sequencing techniques to identify genetic signatures of adaptation to the selection constraints. Obtaining individual sequencing data is often unrealistic due to cost and sample issues, so we focus on pooled genomic data. We explore a series of statistical tests for selection using pooled case (under selection) and control populations. The tests generally capture skews in the scaled frequency spectrum of alleles in a region, which are indicative of a selective sweep. Extensive simulations are used to show that these approaches work well {{for a wide range of}} population divergence times and strong selective pressures. Control vs control simulations are used to determine an empirical False Positive Rate, and regions under selection are determined using a 1 % FPR level. We show that pooling does not have a significant impact on statistical power. The tests are also robust to reasonable variations in several different parameters, including window size, base-calling error rate, and sequencing coverage. We then demonstrate the viability (and the challenges) of one of these methods in two independent Drosophila populations (Drosophila melanogaster) bred under selection for hypoxia and accelerated development, respectively. Testing for extreme hypoxia tolerance showed clear signals of selection, pointing to loci that are important for hypoxia adaptation. Overall, we outline a strategy for finding regions under selection using pooled sequences, then devise optimal tests for that strategy. The approaches show promise for detecting selection, even several generations after fixation of the beneficial allele has occurred...|$|R

The original vitality of the infective stage of nematode is one of the important factors that affects the field activity of EPNs. Many elements such as copper (Cu), iron (Fe), cobalt (Co), selenium (Se), and zinc (Zn) occur in trace amounts in living organisms and are essential for their growth, development, health, and vitality. Due to their importance to nematode vitality, elements have long been the subject of nematological research. Most of this research has focused on the effect of external exposure to elements on nematode. In vitro tests carried out in a laboratory revealed that vitality and infectivity of the EPNs are affected in the presence of nontoxic metal ions (Jaworska et al., 1997 b). Manganese (Mn) and magnesium (Mg) reduced mortality of Steinernema carpocapsae and Heterorhabditis bacteriophora infective juveniles (IJs) intoxicated with lead (Pb) ions and increased their infectivity against Galleria mellonella (Jaworska et al., 1997 b). In contrast, cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), zinc (Zn), lead (Pb), and copper (Cu) decreased reproduction of Steinernema feltiae, S. carpocapsae, and H. bacteriophora and lowered their virulence against the wax moth, G. mellonella (Jaworska and Gorczyca, 2002 and 2009 and Sun et al., 2016). However, much less is known about the natural levels of elements in IJs or their roles in EPN biology. In vivo studies on the level of metal and elements in IJs are very important as the quantitative differences between essential amounts and biological excesses of such elements are very small and determined the physiological state and vitality of IJs of EPN.|$|R

In Sweden the heifers tend to be older if you compare with Denmark or United States where the custom heifer raising is well known and growing. One reason can be the Swedish laws regarding outside grassing for all cows during the summer months. This complicates the insemination work, and often does not the heifer get pregnant until it its back inside the barn in the fall.

40|$|The {{improvement}} of habitat quality and reproductive success through {{the implementation of}} artificial breeding structures {{is one of the}} most widespread in situ conservation strategies applied to the recovery of declining wildlife populations. Several past studies have monitored the use of artificial breeding structures in the wild, but virtually none of them have investigated which demographic and environmental factors actually determine their effectiveness in facilitating reproductive success. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to identify those factors influencing breeding success in artificial structures. With this purpose we surveyed a declining population of a keystone species of Mediterranean ecosystems, namely the European wild rabbit. In Doñana National Park, we sampled during the course of two years the breeding success of wild rabbits from 47 artificial warrens, experimentally provided under different demographic and environmental conditions. In order to determine the relative importance of such factors, we applied an AIC model selection procedure to alternative biological hypothesis groups, postulating that breeding success in artificial structures would primarily depend on population density, food availability and/or predator limitation. We found that the efficiency of artificial warrens in facilitating rabbit reproductive success can vary, with an increase associated with greater pasture availability. Predator limitation by fencing also positively affected rabbit reproduction, but only in combination with high pasture availability. On their own, fencing treatment and population reinforcements had low and null effectiveness facilitating reproduction, respectively, as well as entailing significant economic and biological costs. The best way to improve breeding success in artificial structures, therefore, was through their strategic placement in potential high-quality habitats, i. e. with suitable pasture availability. We suggest that vegetation management can effectively increase carrying capacity and consequently the target species’ reproductive success, especially in <b>fast</b> <b>breeding</b> species like the European wild rabbit. The provision of artificial breeding structures for conservation purposes may significantly benefit from the elaboration of concurrent experimental studies similar to the present research, which can help establish useful guidelines for optimizing future conservation efforts.

The {{chemical}} composition of the nuclear fuel affects the performance of several key properties important for the overall operation and safety performance of the reactor. The energy-producing reactors presently operational in the world utilize oxide-based nuclear fuel, which has been the dominating fuel form throughout the history of commercial nuclear power. The concept of nitride-based nuclear fuel is not new and development in the field, together with studies on actinide nitride properties, has been conducted for 50 - 60 years, although in limited scale compared to oxides. Nitride-based nuclear fuel possess properties making it an interesting fuel form in light water reactors as well as liquid metal cooled reactors envisioned for fourth generation nuclear power systems. In generation four reactor systems nitride-based fuel is an interesting fuel option both in UN-based liquid metal cooled <b>breeding</b> <b>reactors</b> as well as in reactors dedicated to the burning of transuranic actinides present in the used fuel of current light water reactors. This thesis focuses on the studies of inert matrix fuels mainly for non-breeding reactor purposes. In this work preparation and characterization of nitride fuel matrices of ZrN, ZrPuN and PuN have been studied. The internal gelation method has been applied for formation of oxide microsphere precursor material and carbothermal reduction has been applied for nitride production. Nitride fuel pellet purity and final density have been studied through cold pressing and sintering as well as ZrCN pellet formation from microspheres through spark plasma sintering. Investigations of nitride purity estimations through powder X-ray diffraction data has been performed. Am losses during the production route of PuN pellets by both internal gelation and powder synthesis has been investigated. Production of reasonably pure PuN through carbothermal reduction is possible and purities up to PuN 0. 99 C 0. 01 have been reached. Carbide formed in ZrN was more stable and in the Zr system nitride purities of about ZrN 0. 85 C 0. 15 were achieved. Conventional pressing and sintering of ZrCN microspheres did not reach densities above about 50 % of theoretical density while spark plasma sintering of ZrCN of similar purity reached about 85 % TD. PuN powder could be conventionally pressed and sintered to almost 80 % of TD. It has been shown that ZrCN materials can be accurately composition estimated by XRD data while quaternary (Zr,Pu) (C,N) material estimations overestimated nitride purity somewhat. During PuN synthesis about 4 % Am was lost during carbothermal reduction. Sintering in N 2 atmosphere resulted in total losses of about 11 % Am while sintering in Ar atmosphere yielded losses of about 50 % Am...|$|R
40|$|The in situ <b>breeding</b> {{and burning}} <b>reactor</b> (ISBBR), which {{makes use of}} the {{outstanding}} breeding capability of metallic pellet and the excellent irradiation-resistant performance of SiCf/SiC ceramic composites cladding, can approach the design purpose of ultralong cycle and ultrahigh burnup and maintain stable radial power distribution during the cycle life without refueling and shuffling. Since {{the characteristics of the}} fuel pellet and cladding are different from the traditional fuel rod of ceramic pellet and metallic cladding, the multiphysics behaviors in ISBBR are also quite different. A computer code, named TANG, to model the specific multiphysics behaviors in ISBBR has been developed. The primary calculation results provided by TANG demonstrate that ISBBR has an excellent comprehensive performance of GEN-IV and a great development potential...|$|R
40|$|The tritium {{technology}} requirements {{created by}} the controlled thermonuclear research program to develop a demonstration fusion power reactor by the year 2000 are reviewed. It is found {{that the majority of}} the technological advances which are needed to ensure adequate tritium containment in a tritium <b>breeding</b> power <b>reactor</b> need to be demonstrated on a pilot scale by approximately 1983, so that they may be incorporated into EPR-II, the second of two planned experimental power reactors. The most important advances include development of containment materials with permeabilities to tritium well below measured values for stainless steel; large scale, low inventory deuterium-tritium separation systems; and improved monitoring and assay systems. There are less critical requirements for information about the effects of tritium and helium on the mechanical properties of materials, the effects of tritium on biological systems, and data on physical and chemical properties of tritium. Substantial progress needs to be made on these problems early enough to permit possible solutions to be tested on EPR-I. In addition, major improvements in tritium handling equipment are required for EPR-I. Those technological problems for which solutions have not yet been demonstrated by EPR-II must be solved by 1989 if they are to be assured successful application in the demonstration reactor.

50|$|Genetic {{modification}} of plants {{is achieved by}} adding a specific gene or genes to a plant, or by knocking down a gene with RNAi, to produce a desirable phenotype. The plants resulting from adding a gene are {{often referred to as}} transgenic plants. If for genetic modification genes of the species or of a crossable plant are used under control of their native promoter, then they are called cisgenic plants. Sometimes genetic modification can produce a plant with the desired trait or traits <b>faster</b> than classical <b>breeding</b> because the majority of the plant's genome is not altered.|$|R
