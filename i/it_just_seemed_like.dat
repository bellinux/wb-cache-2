The 45-minute film audible visions of (sic)nesses features Slipknot during and in-between gigs on the All Hope Is Gone World Tour. Shawn Crahan stated that, [...] "Going in and filming this, <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> {{there was no way}} it could fail. It {{was going to be in}} the top five best shows of our careers, and that's basically what it was: we got off the stage and all nine of us [...] felt the same thing, we knew that we destroyed 80,000 people. Watching it back just brings tears to my eyes".|$|E
500|$|Introspection {{was also}} listed {{as one of}} the {{foundational}} themes prevalent on the album, along with [...] "genuine statements of personal and careerist reflection scattered among the posturing of 'Bitch I'm Madonna' and 'Unapologetic Bitch'" [...] according to Slant Magazines Sam C. Mac as well as her [...] "obsessive self-regard". Madonna explained to Jon Pareles of The New York Times that although she has never looked back at her past endeavors, reminiscing about it felt right for Rebel Heart. [...] "And it's bittersweet for me to think about that. <b>It</b> <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> a time where I wanted to stop and look back. It's kind of like survivor guilt. How did I make it and they didn't?" [...] During the album's development phase, she became comfortable expressing her ideas in front of a few people, comparing it to: [...] "writing your diary in front of somebody and reading it out loud... It was almost like an acting exercise, you know, just putting myself in a room and letting ideas flow even if I didn't feel so connected to the people".|$|E
500|$|Gary Anderson's missed kick {{has been}} singled out as the main {{contributing}} factor to the Vikings' loss, as the Falcons were able {{to capitalize on the}} late shift in momentum produced by an unexpected opportunity to tie and eventually win the game. Considering this impact on the game's outcome and the historic performances of Anderson and the 1998 Vikings team, the miss has since been noted as a memorable moment in the greater history of the NFL. Paul Allen, the play-by-play radio announcer for the Vikings, and Dan Barreiro both consider the miss {{as one of the most}} devastating moments in the history of Minnesota sports. According to Chad Hartman, another sports radio host based in Minneapolis, [...] " [...] will always be known as the guy who was a part of screwing up the Vikings' trip to the Super Bowl, even though he had this magnificent season." [...] ESPN voted the miss as the most memorable play in Vikings history, and ESPN contributor Ben Goessling believes that the miss influenced misfortunes that the franchise faced in subsequent years, including two further NFC Championship losses in 2000 and 2009. Cunningham concurred by claiming, [...] "With that kick, <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> the whole franchise went wide left." ...|$|E
5000|$|Pitchfork was critical, writing, [...] "Beyond the melodies that dont {{stick in}} my head and the beats that dont make me want to dance, the only real problem with Souljacker ... is that <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> an underachievement." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{would have}} laughed over it so happily if I had my baby," [...] she sobbed to Marilla. [...] "But when I haven't <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> wanton cruelty--though I know Phil wouldn't hurt me for the world. Oh, Marilla, I don't see how I can EVER be happy again--EVERYTHING will hurt me {{all the rest of}} my life." ...|$|R
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>just</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> a feel-good record {{but when}} you really listen to the lyrics, it's about me growing up. In my household, I didn't go all of the parties and I didn't {{do all the things}} {{that a lot of the}} other teenage girls did because I was so in love with my radio and my music. I was so in love with this radio and my parents were happy that I was into {{something}} positive.|$|R
500|$|During {{the latter}} half of 2005, Working Title {{approached}} several towns in South West England looking for an appropriate filming location. Pegg commented, [...] "We're both [...] from the West Country so <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> it was the perfect and logical thing to drag those kind of ideas and those genres and those clichés back to our beginnings to where we grew up, so you could see high-octane balls-to-the-wall action in Frome". Stow-on-the-Wold was considered amongst others, but after being turned away, the company settled upon Wells in Somerset, Wright's hometown, of which he has said [...] "I love it but I also want to trash it". Wells Cathedral was digitally painted out of every shot of the cathedral city, as Wright wanted the Church of St. Cuthbert to be the centre building for the fictional town of Sandford; however, the Bishop's Palace is identifiable in some shots (and was itself used as the setting for some scenes). While shooting scenes in their uniforms, Pegg and Frost were often mistaken for genuine police officers and asked for directions by passers-by. Filming also took place at the Hendon Police College, including the driving school skid pan and athletic track. Filming commenced on 19 March 2006 and lasted for eleven weeks. After editing, Wright ended up cutting half an hour of footage from the film.|$|E
2500|$|Sally Preston: a topless feminist MP. She's {{decided to}} serve {{her time in}} office topless as a {{political}} statement. Ullman on Sally: [...] "In Europe, {{there are lots of}} topless protesters and <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> a topless member of British Parliament would be the next thing. So I just played her like a mom going to work." [...] On the subject on the character's prosthetic breasts, Ullman revealed that production asked if she wanted a molding of her actual breasts. [...] "I thought, 'No, no, no!'" [...] Ullman praised the BBC for agreeing not to pixelate the character's nipples. [...] "t was very tough to wear those prosthetic breasts and talk to the crew. You either had the people who stared at your tits — or the ones who are determined to look you in your eyes. My director, bless him, never ever looked at me below neck on those shooting days." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1998, Foo Fighters {{traveled}} to Grohl's {{home state of}} Virginia to write music for its third album. However, Grohl and Stahl were unable to co-operate as songwriters; Grohl told Kerrang! in 1999, [...] "in those few weeks <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> {{the three of us}} were moving in one direction and Franz wasn't". Grohl was distraught over the decision to fire Stahl, as the two had been friends since childhood. Shortly after that, Mendel called Grohl to say he was quitting the band to reunite with Sunny Day Real Estate, only to reverse his decision the next day. The remaining trio of Grohl, Mendel, and Hawkins spent the next several months recording the band's third album, There Is Nothing Left to Lose, in Grohl's Virginia home studio that he bought and built. The album spawned several singles, including [...] "Learn to Fly", the band's first single to reach the US Billboard Hot 100. Other singles included [...] "Stacked Actors", [...] "Generator", [...] "Next Year" [...] and [...] "Breakout".|$|E
5000|$|<b>It</b> <b>just</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> {{the most}} fun thing in the world. I've never met people who have kids who haven't {{looked me in the}} eye and been like, [...] "It's the {{greatest}} thing that's ever happened." ... I think it's biological. I'm 30. I'm not that young, right? I'm not, like, 24 or 22. I'm no longer in the phase of my life where I talk about everything as in the future. Like, I'm in the future.|$|R
5000|$|On August 15, 2017, Parton {{formally}} {{announced the}} album's upcoming release {{at a press}} conference at her management's Nashville office in front of reporters and their children, saying [...] "I love kids and I am so excited. <b>It</b> <b>just</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> the right time release a children's album since I'm getting so old, I'm getting back into my second childhood." [...] She also revealed the album's cover and revealed the track listing, as well as singing three songs from the album and reading a story to the children.|$|R
50|$|Remembering his {{childhood}} Dave said: “It was tougher back then; I’ve {{had a rough}} life. But I can remember everything. From horse and cart days right up until today; jet planes and computers. When I was a boy there weren’t even any fences. No electricity lines or phone lines. No roads, nothing. You could just head out across country and you wouldn’t have to open any gates or anything like that. All just open prairie. The world has changed so quickly in <b>just</b> one lifetime. <b>It’s</b> so short a time. I’ve had a long life but <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> yesterday”.|$|R
2500|$|Hodgson {{decided to}} leave the series halfway through Season Five due to his dislike of being on-camera and his {{disagreements}} with producer Mallon over creative control of the program. Hodgson also stated that Mallon's insistence to produce a feature film version of the show led to his departure, giving up his rights on the MST3K property to Mallon. Hodgson later told an interviewer: [...] "If I had {{the presence of mind to}} try and work it out, I would rather have stayed. 'Cause I didn't want to go, <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> I needed to." [...] Though they held casting calls for a replacement for Hodgson on camera, the crew found that none of the potential actors really fit the role; instead, having reviewed a test run that Nelson had done with the 'bots, the crew agreed that having Nelson (who had already appeared in guest roles on the show) replace Hodgson would be the least jarring approach. [...] The replacement of Joel by Mike would lead to an oft-jokingly [...] "Joel vs Mike flame war" [...] among fans, similar to the [...] "Kirk vs Picard" [...] discussions in the Star Trek fandom.|$|E
6000|$|... "Bears are {{harmless}} {{if you let}} 'em alone," [...] she said, [...] "and the mountain-lion is a {{great big}} bluff. He won't fight, you can't make him fight; but the mother lion will. She's dangerous when she has cubs--most animals are. I was out hunting grouse one day with a little twenty-two rifle, when all at once, as I looked up along a rocky point I was crossing, I saw a mountain-lion looking at me. First I thought I'd let drive at him; but the chances were against my getting him from there, so I climbed up above him--or where I thought he was--and while I was looking for him I happened to glance to my right, {{and there he was}} about fifty feet away looking at me pleasant as you please. Didn't seem to be mad at all--'peared like he was just wondering what I'd do next. I jerked my gun into place, but he faded away. I crawled around to get behind him, and just when I reached the ledge on which he had been standing a few minutes before, I saw him just where I'd been. He had traded places with me. I began to have that creepy feeling. He was so silent and so kind of pleasant-looking I got leery of him. <b>It</b> <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> as though I'd dreamed him. He didn't seem real." ...|$|E
5000|$|We hadn't {{thought at}} all about the Nazi implications. <b>It</b> <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> a very anarchic, stylish thing to do.|$|E
5000|$|Carter Dotson of TV Fanatic {{gave the}} episode {{three and a}} half stars out of five, saying [...] "I was {{wondering}} if there was anything in particular that would cause this episode to be delayed a week after the Sandy Hook tragedy, and perhaps {{it was the fact that}} King Herod’s forces were trying to kill a baby that did it, though little else seemed particularly offensive. However, there were a lot of pauses and general delay tactics that might have served as ways to edit out other potentially-insensitive content. But otherwise, <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> was <b>just</b> pushed back because Fox didn’t want to air something crass right after such a tragedy. Probably a good idea." ...|$|R
5000|$|In a later interview, Josh commented {{about this}} time [...] "I became a Christian in May 1998 and I quit the Popes in January 1999. I tried to {{incorporate}} my faith into {{what we were doing}} in the Popes, but <b>it</b> <b>just</b> didn't <b>seem</b> <b>like</b> a good fit." ...|$|R
5000|$|The film {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics, with praise and criticism focused on Franco's methods of presenting Faulkner's complex narrative. Kyle Smith of The New York Post was very harsh, declaring, [...] "Franco dilutes the drama with first-year-film-student gimmicks, like split screens and slow motion, <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> a dull collection of pointless monologues from actors who can’t even {{be bothered to}} match up their accents." [...] A.O. Scott of The New York Times said, [...] "But in rushing in where wise men might fear to tread, Mr. Franco has accomplished something serious and worthwhile. His “As I Lay Dying” is certainly ambitious, {{but it is also}} admirably modest. The script, written by Mr. Franco with Matt Rager, tries to pare Faulkner’s multivoiced narrative to a manageable essence." ...|$|R
5000|$|Martin Ayres, one {{of several}} who wrote their first {{articles}} for Sporting Cyclist {{and went on to}} edit cycling magazines of their own, said that Wadley's discursive, first-person style looked simple but [...] "I tried to copy Jock's style once or twice when I was editor of Cycling, but when I did it, <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> name-dropping.' ...|$|E
5000|$|Hamlin {{said after}} the race {{that he was doing}} all he [...] "could to pace (Larson). I knew he had a very fast car. <b>It</b> <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> {{we were able to get}} off the corner pretty good and I just ran kind of a pace there which I felt {{comfortable}} with. And just in case we had a restart, they wanted to burn the tires up." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Cowboys {{is where}} {{everybody}} came into their own, {{along with the}} full-blown Pantera sound", [...] "That was actually the first song we wrote for the record. Basically it was about us coming out of Texas and being out of place. People don't think of Texas as being a hot spot for heavy metal, they think of New York or L.A. or something like that, so <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> an obvious concept for us." [...] Vinnie Paul ...|$|E
5000|$|Once the {{qualifying}} session completed, Stewart commented, [...] "I {{was watching}} guys' lap times, {{and looking at}} the sheet to seeing what they practiced, and it wasn't as much an increase as what we've seen. I think, obviously, we've had a lot of cloud cover today and cool temperatures here the last couple of days, so I don't think the track changed as much and got as hot during the day as what we typically see here. I think that's the reason that we didn't have the big pick-ups. But you still anticipate that, at night, the guys are going to pick up speed. <b>It</b> <b>just</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> the air's a little muggier right now. I don't know whether that hurt horsepower or even created more drag and kind of evened everything out." ...|$|R
500|$|Gabler {{credits the}} studio's {{marketing}} team for being [...] "really creative". Fox saw {{the film as}} [...] "counterprogramming" [...] on the weekend Superman Returns was released. While {{they knew that the}} material and Hathaway would help draw a younger female audience that would not be as interested in seeing that film, [...] "e didn’t want <b>it</b> to <b>just</b> <b>seem</b> <b>like</b> a chick flick coming out." ...|$|R
5000|$|Forty-four {{cars are}} entered for {{qualifying}}, but only forty-three could {{qualify for the}} race because of NASCAR's qualifying procedure. McMurray clinched his first pole position of the season, {{with a time of}} 19.621 seconds. He was joined on the front row of the grid by Newman. Kasey Kahne qualified third, Logano took fourth, and Hamlin started fifth. Allmendinger, Labonte, Reutimann, Harvick and Regan Smith rounded out the top ten. However, in the qualifying session, only 43 cars attempted to qualify (Setzer withdrew). Following the session, McMurray commented, [...] "We've had really good cars. <b>It</b> <b>just</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> we've had really bad luck, so I'm hoping. ... I've always been a little superstitious of green, and I showed up, and I saw my car, and I was like, 'Wow, that's not really what I was expecting to see.' But I hope this turns it around for us." ...|$|R
5000|$|Norman {{says the}} feeling of being {{different}} goes back as far as she can remember. In a cover story for New York Magazine she said [...] " [...] <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> I was living in the wrong body. I always felt female." [...] For Norman her life at home as well as school was not easy. She had a father who was battling cancer and a family who she was afraid to come out to.|$|E
50|$|Lane {{identifies}} as bisexual. She stated I think the hardest time {{was coming to}} terms with my bisexuality. That was probably the hardest thing. I was brought up that I was going to burn for it. Once I got over that and realized I didn't have to live under my family's thumb any more and that I was an adult and made my own decisions, I sought out the adult industry, being a natural exhibitionist. <b>It</b> <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> the right thing.|$|E
5000|$|I got to {{the point}} where I didn’t really know what else we could do, but I don't think that was as much a factor as I just didn’t feel very {{comfortable}} in it any more. I was 33 at the time, and playing songs that were written 10 years before, and <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> this wasn't what I wanted to do; I didn't really know what I wanted to do, but I was just becoming more and more aware that I didn't want to do that.|$|E
5000|$|.....Wildboyz {{probably}} could've {{kept going}} after Season 4. <b>It</b> <b>just</b> didn't <b>seem</b> <b>like</b> {{there was a}} point. Over time it had essentially evolved back into Jackass. During our final trip to Russia there were no stunts that wouldn't have fit in just as easily on Jackass. Knoxville came along on that trip too, which contributed even more to that vibe." ...|$|R
5000|$|Sean McKenna from TV Fanatic, gave a 3.9 {{star rating}} out of 5, stating: [...] "Will God appear on Supernatural? It's a {{question}} I'm sure many viewers {{have continued to}} ask, especially with what <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> the numerous mentions of the character on Supernatural Season 11. And with the way Supernatural Season 11 Episode 18 ended, it certainly feels more likely... right? On one hand, <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> the right time with God's sister showing up and causing problems that God would finally reveal himself and get involved. Granted, we've seen lots of bad things happen on Earth over the seasons from the apocalypse to the Leviathan arriving, etc., and we haven't heard a peep from him. So, would Amara using Lucifer to draw out God really work? That's what's {{going to get him}} to reveal himself? The idea sounds exciting, but I also worry that the execution of him arriving might be more of a letdown." ...|$|R
5000|$|Entertainment Weekly's Hilary Busis {{liked the}} episode, but somehow {{questioned}} the show creators' sudden inclusion of characters that {{were written in}} the 1800s into the storylines: [...] "Maybe it's best not to anger the all-powerful sorcerers. Instead, let's talk about their televised creation: 'The Doctor,' which revealed that Dr. Whale was once known as Dr. Horrible—I mean, Dr. Victor Frankenstein. Though I know {{that not all of}} Once's 'fairy land' characters actually hail from folklore—like Frankenstein, Pinocchio and the Mad Hatter are both inventions of 19th century novelists—I've still got mixed feelings about bringing Mary Shelley's classic into OUAT's potent public domain stew. If any and all stories are fair game, where will the show's writers draw the line? Will future episodes feature Emma befriending Elizabeth Bennet and Jo March, then trying to reunite Romeo and Juliet? <b>It</b> <b>just</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> expanding the show's world beyond fairy tales and Disney properties—like Captain Hook—has the potential to turn Once into a giant, fanfiction-y mess." ...|$|R
5000|$|On February 14, 2014 {{the band}} re-released the album with Tory Edwards on violin and mandolin, stating {{that they had}} {{received}} many requests to remix the record. The band had experienced difficulties in obtaining the master tapes of the 1988 album and as such, decided to re-record the album. Of the decision, the band commented that [...] "The aim was not really to change but to enhance it with the opportunity {{with the use of}} new tools. We have the time available as well, and <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> a no-brainer." ...|$|E
5000|$|Dave Williams {{explained}} how album {{got its name}} in MTV interview: [...] "I got that tattoo tattooed before we named the record. We {{were working on the}} song [...] "Sinner," [...] and our A&R guy said, [...] "That would be a good name for the record." [...] We all just {{looked at each other and}} said, [...] "Wow, OK." [...] It was just a natural progression that became the whole theme of the record. There are a lot of religious issues on the record and a lot of relationship issues. <b>It</b> <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> it would fit." ...|$|E
5000|$|Long {{reportedly}} {{decided that}} he didn't {{want to go to}} Iraq after talking to people who had been there: [...] "These people came back and were telling these horrific stories and our superiors were egging people on, some people were actually volunteering to go over there and <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> justified homicide", he said in the interview. [...] "It didn't sit right in my stomach. I morally couldn't do it." [...] Long was ordered in March 2005 to report to Iraq for service. [...] In 2005, he left his military base in Colorado Springs, and went to Toronto.|$|E
5000|$|At {{a congressional}} hearing on May 23, 2013, on an {{abortion}} bill that would ban the procedure after 20 weeks of pregnancy, Gohmert {{told the story of}} another couple he knew that decided to go through with their pregnancy despite learning of fetal anomalies. He told Zink, a woman witness, that she should have gone through with her pregnancy despite some doctor's opinion that the brain function was impaired, and then have a better assessment of the baby's health once it was born. Gohmert explained: [...] "Ms. Zink, having my great sympathy and empathy both, I still come back wondering, shouldn't we wait, like that couple did, and see if the child can survive before we decide to rip him apart? ... So these are ethical issues, they're moral issues, they’re difficult issues, and the parents should certainly be consulted. But <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like,</b> <b>it’s</b> a more educated decision if the child is in front of you to make those decisions", Gohmert said.|$|R
5000|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} at Architekt Music Studios in Butler, New Jersey. Witherspoon {{stated that the}} album's title was chosen due a dream of his, stating, [...] "In the dream, the sun was going away and I was just looking for safety before it happened and not necessarily knowing what would [...] when it blacked out but just knowing that something was scary. I guess <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>seems</b> more <b>like</b> {{the feeling of the}} unknown." ...|$|R
2500|$|A {{review of}} the album on Punknews.org was far more {{critical}} of the album, stating [...] "there is [...] "substance" [...] here—there are guitar solos, tempo changes, gang vocals—but there isn't substance. There's no authenticity; <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> the songs were built from a collection of [...] "brutal" [...] ideas written on pieces of paper, put together in a hat, and splashed out on the floor." [...] The album received a 1.5 out of 5 rating. A review on AbsolutePunk was also critical of the album, stating that while some songs were [...] "heavy, but catchy" [...] and [...] "sounds like {{it would have a}} room full of people moshing until they drop", at some points it feels like the band is [...] "half-arseing it", going on to say [...] "Sometimes you wish they would throw in some thrash beats, and fast riffing. This can disappoint and I feel like a few solo's wouldn't go amiss." [...] However, the reviewer concludes by saying [...] "All in all, Suicide Season has impressed me. The boys from BMTH have come back and shown they aren't just a generic haircuts band." ...|$|R
