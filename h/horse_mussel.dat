The aims were to obtain relevant information for assessing the risk of transmission of enteric viruses by shellfish and to investigate the potential of various indicator viruses in routine screening. Noroviruses were detected in 6. 8 % of the samples, and the indicators were detected in 23. 8 % (F-RNA phages), 18. 6 % (adenoviruses), and 8. 0 % (circoviruses) of the samples. A seasonal variation was observed, with the exception of circoviruses, with more positive samples in the winter. A positive correlation was found between F-RNA phages and noroviruses. However, F-RNA phages were present in only 43 % of the norovirus-positive samples.

40|$|Concerns {{over the}} fate of {{pharmaceuticals}} and personal care products (PPCP) within the environment have been growing with the advent of more precise analytical methods. The discharge of municipal wastewater has been identified as a significant source of these contaminants, particularly where wastewater treatment is minimal. Here we present results from a comprehensive monitoring regime located around Victoria, BC, Canada. Samples were collected between 2009 and 2016 {{from a variety of sources}} including marine water, sediment and biota adjacent to two major untreated sewage outfalls, as well as the sewage itself. PPCP concentrations within the untreated sewage were high, and the sediment surrounding the outfalls showed corresponding contamination. However, this contamination dropped quickly with distance from the outfall such that by 800 m distance most PPCPs were below detection limits. Tissue samples of resident Northern <b>Horse</b> <b>mussels</b> (Modiolus modiolus) collected adjacent to one of the major sewage outfalls showed high single sample concentrations of the antimicrobial triclosan (317 ng g− 1 dry weight), the antibiotic ciprofloxacin (176 ng g− 1 dry weight), as well as the antidepressant sertraline (84. 1 ng g− 1 dry weight). Reference stations from around the region showed very low concentrations of contamination with almost all PPCP concentrations being below detection limits.

40|$|Biogenic habitats, such as coral reefs, {{facilitate}} diverse communities. In aquatic systems, aggregations {{of mobile}} benthic species {{may play a}} similar ecological role to that of typically sessile biogenic habitats; however, this has rarely been considered. We quantified the abundance of sessile <b>horse</b> <b>mussels</b> Modiolus modiolus and aggregating brittle stars Ophiothrix fragilis and tested for correlations between the density of mussels (live and dead) and brittle stars each with (1) abundance, biomass, diversity, and assemblage structure of associated benthic macrofauna; and (2) percent organic matter of the sediment. We found that the abundance of live M. modiolus was positively associated with the abundance and biomass of macrofauna. The positive association between M. modiolus and macrofaunal abundance was further amplified {{with an increase in}} brittle stars and a decrease in dead mussel shells. Macrofaunal biomass was lower with a higher percentage of dead mussel shells, and macrofaunal diversity increased with greater abundances of live M. modiolus and brittle stars. Sediment organic matter was positively related to brittle star density, but not to the abundance of live or dead mussels. The positive relationship between brittle stars and sediment organic matter suggests that brittle stars could enhance rates of benthic- pelagic coupling. Given the importance of understanding the functional role of threatened habitats, it is essential that the underlying community patterns be understood through robust observational studies to then derive testable hypotheses to determine drivers. These findings provide novel insight into the ecological role of aggregations of mobile species, which is essential to prioritize conservation and restoration strategies...|$|R

40|$|Southeast Asia has a {{relatively}} long tradition in mollusc culture. The mollusc species of commercial significance {{in this region}} are the blood cockles (Anadara granosa), the green mussels (Perna viridis), the oysters (Crassostrea spp.) and the <b>horse</b> <b>mussels</b> (Modiolus sp.). Mollusc production has been observed to fluctuate dramatically in recent years due mainly to the inconsistent seed supply from the wild, which varies geographically and annually. These variations are often associated with pollution and also the uncontrolled harvesting of adults irrespective of their sizes, which reduces chances of spawning among adults. Production of the above-mentioned species in Southeast Asia in 1997 amounted to 73 820, 62 073, 36 779 and 5 300 mt., respectively. The culture of these bivalves is still dependent on traditional methods of obtaining seeds from the wild and transplanting them to culture sites for grow-out. Culture techniques for these bivalves are basically the same all over Southeast Asia, except for minor variations {{in the use of}} structures and materials to suit the local conditions. Whilst efforts are geared towards developing new technologies to promote mollusc culture in the region, it is important to facilitate and stimulate environmentally acceptable developments and sustainable management practices. Although hatchery propagation techniques have been developed for these cultured and other non-cultured species, the technologies have yet to be taken up commercially. Some of the common problems confronted by the region, which varies greatly by species and location, are inconsistent seed supply, lack of suitable areas for expanding culture activities, poor post harvest handling techniques, demand levels being below production capacity, environmental pollution, vagaries of nature, low price and lack of access to export markets...|$|R
40|$|Marine inshore communities, {{including}} biogenic habitats {{have undergone}} dramatic changes {{as a result}} of exploitation, pollution, land-use changes and introduced species. The Firth of Forth on the east coast of Scotland was once home to the most important oyster (Ostrea edulis Linnaeus, 1758) beds in Scotland. 19 th and early 20 th century fisheries scientists documented the degradation and loss of these beds, yet transformation of the wider benthic community has been little studied. We undertook archival searches, ecological surveys and shell community analysis using radioisotope dated sediment cores to investigate the history of decline of Forth oyster beds over the last 200 years and the changes to its wider biological communities. Quadrat analysis of the present day benthos reveal that soft-sediment communities dominate the Firth of Forth, with little remaining evidence of past oyster beds in places where abundant shell remains were picked up by a survey undertaken in 1895. Queen scallops (Aequipecten opercularis Linnaeus, 1758) and <b>horse</b> <b>mussels</b> (Modiolus modiolus Linnaeus, 1758) were once common within the Forth but have also markedly decreased compared to the earlier survey. Ouranalyses of shell remains suggest that overall mollusc biomass and species richness declined throughout the 19 th century and early 20 th century, suggesting broader-scale community change as human impacts increased and as habitats degraded. Inshore communities in the Firth of Forth today are less productive and less diverse compared to past states, with evidence suggesting that most of the damage was done by early bottom trawling and dredging activities. Given the pervasive nature of intensive trawling over the past 150 years, the kind of degradation we document for the Firth of Forth is likely to be commonplace within UK inshore communities...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of sea otters (Enhydra lutris) on nearshore marine communities {{has been widely}} studied in kelp-forest ecosystems, however less is known about their impacts in other systems. In Southeast Alaska, the recolonization by sea otters into areas {{where they have been}} long absent (~ 100 years), provides a natural experiment with which to examine the response of soft-substrate intertidal prey communities to the return of a top predator. Sea otter abundance in Glacier Bay, Alaska increased from zero in 1993 to > 8, 500 individuals in 2012. Their aggregated diet from intertidal foraging bouts consisted predominantly of clam (56 %), <b>horse</b> <b>mussels</b> (15 %) and urchins (18 %) and was found to diversify over space and time as sea otters colonized and persisted. To assess intertidal community response to sea otters 45 intertidal sites were sampled prior to, or concurrent with sea otter colonization, and again up to 12 years later. Using GIS and aerial surveys I estimated the cumulative density of the sea otters at each site. At a sea otter density of roughly 6 -otters/km 2 clam populations were found to have 50 % probability of population decline, and preferred prey species such as Saxidomus giganteus were found to likely decline at sea otter densities 2. At sites where sea otters were at low densities or absent, clam biomass generally remained unchanged or increased. Energy recovery rates decreased significantly with cumulative otter density from roughly 20 kcal/min at 0. 36 otters/km 2 to 9 kcal/min at 4. 54 otters/km 2, requiring individual otters {{to increase the amount of}} energy they expend foraging. The effect of sea otters on intertidal clam populations in soft-sediment was consistent with findings in other habitats, where reduced densities and sizes of prey were documented. This study established the occurrence of top-down structuring in soft-sediment systems over a multi-decadal time scale...|$|R
