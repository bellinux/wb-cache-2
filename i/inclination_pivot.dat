40|$|Deducing the weir flow stage-discharge {{relationship}} is a classical hydraulic problem. In this regard Buckinghamâ€™s theorem of dimensional analysis {{can be used}} to find simple and accurate formulas to obtain the rating curves of different weir types. At first, in this review paper the rectangular weir that is a very common hydraulic structure is studied. It is indicated that the crest shape, approach channel width, obliquity (angle between the weir crest and the direction normal to the flow motion) and vertical <b>inclination</b> (<b>pivot</b> weir) are the key-parameters affecting the flow over the rectangular weirs. The flow over the triangular, labyrinth, parabolic, circular, elliptical, and W-weirs are also studied using dimensional analysis and incomplete self-similarity concept. For all mentioned weirs the stage-discharge relationships are presented and the application limits are discussed. The results of this paper can be used and implemented by the irrigation and drainage network designers to simplify the procedure of weir design...|$|E
50|$|One of the {{earliest}} forms of fixed railway signal is the semaphore. These signals display their different indications to train drivers by changing the angle of <b>inclination</b> of a <b>pivoted</b> 'arm'. Semaphore signals were patented in the early 1840s by Joseph James Stevens, and soon became {{the most widely used}} form of mechanical signal. Designs have altered over the intervening years, and colour light signals have replaced semaphore signals in most countries, but in few they remain in use. Note that this article doesn't represent a worldwide view of the semaphore.|$|R
