5|$|Herodotus recounts that, {{according}} to the Athenians, as the battle began the Corinthians hoisted their sails and began sailing away from the battle, northwards up the straits. However, <b>he</b> <b>also</b> <b>says</b> <b>that</b> other Greeks denied this story. If this did in fact occur, one possible interpretation is that these ships had been a decoy sent to reconnoitre the northern exit from the straits, in case {{the arrival of the}} encircling Egyptian detachment was imminent (if indeed this also occurred). Another possibility (not exclusive of the former) is that the departure of the Corinthians triggered the final approach of the Persians, suggesting as it did that the Allied fleet was disintegrating. At any rate, if they indeed ever left, the Corinthians soon returned to the battle.|$|E
5|$|Many of Poe's conclusions, however, are {{speculative}} {{due to his}} {{rejection of}} analytic logic and emphasis on intuition and inspiration. Further, Eureka contains many scientific errors. In particular, Poe's suggestions opposed Newtonian principles regarding the density and rotation of planets. <b>He</b> <b>also</b> <b>says</b> <b>that</b> Johannes Kepler came to his conclusions not through science but through guesswork. For this reason, {{it has been suggested}} that what Poe demands is true in Eureka is not actually about this universe, but a parallel fictitious one Poe creates. If this is the case, as interpreted by poet Richard Wilbur, Poe is criticizing this world, suggesting it has fallen away from God by elevating scientific reason above poetic intuition.|$|E

Zane criticized comments made by Weinberger, saying [...] "He not only was completely unfair to Bruce Bawer, <b>he’s</b> <b>also</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> {{those of us who}} put the book on the finalist list are racist or too stupid to know we’re racist." ...|$|R

Associating the Praedenecenti with the [...] "Ostabtrezi", <b>he</b> <b>also</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> their homeland was a well-fortified region, because the Bavarian Geographer stated that there were [...] "more than 100 fortresses" [...] on the Ostabtrezi's land. <b>He</b> <b>also</b> proposes that the Bavarian Geographer may have referred to the ancient earthworks {{to the east of}} the Tisza, which are now known as Devil's Dykes.|$|R

Crassus crucified 6,000 of Spartacus' followers hunted down and captured after his defeat in battle. Josephus tells a story of the Romans crucifying people along the walls of Jerusalem. <b>He</b> <b>also</b> <b>says</b> <b>that</b> the Roman soldiers would amuse themselves by crucifying criminals in different positions. In Roman-style crucifixion, the condemned could take up to a few days to die.|$|E
25|$|Vn.Shankar Narayan {{suggests}} that the origin of vegetarianism in India developed from the idea that balance needed to be restored. He claims, “Along with the development in civilisation, savagery also increased {{and those who were}} helpless and voiceless among both humans and non-human animals were more and more exploited and killed to satiate human needs and greed thus disturbing the balance of nature. But fortunately, there were many serious attempts to bring back the humanity to sanity and restore balance from time to time.” <b>He</b> <b>also</b> <b>says</b> <b>that</b> the idea of living in harmony with nature became central to the leaders.|$|E
25|$|The {{author of}} Bichitra Natak, {{believed}} to be Guru Gobind Singh, praises his own (Guru's) soldiers, {{as well as those}} of the enemy forces. According to him, the Guru's soldiers included the five sons of Bibi Viro (the daughter of Guru Har Gobind): Sango Shah, Jit Mall, Gulab Chand, Mahri Chand and Ganga Ram. Sango Shah fell down after killing Najbat Khan of the opposing army. The Guru praises the heroism of Daya Ram, and equates him to Dronacharya of Mahabharata. <b>He</b> <b>also</b> <b>says</b> <b>that</b> his maternal uncle Kirpal fought like a true Kshatriya and killed one Hayat Khan with his Kutka (mace).|$|E

25|$|Verbitsky {{says that}} Bishop Victorio Bonamín, Caggiano's {{associate}} {{in the military}} vicariate general, {{was one of the}} instructors in the course, but not Caggiano himself. <b>He</b> <b>also</b> <b>says</b> <b>that</b> in the course of counter-insurgency classes cadets at the Navy Mechanics School were shown the film The Battle of Algiers (1966), made by Italian communist director Gillo Pontecorvo. The film, which was censored in France, showed the methods used by the French colonial army in Algeria, including the systemic use of torture. The naval chaplain (again, not Caggiano) introduced the film and added a commentary from the religious point of view, reportedly justifying the use of torture as a weapon.|$|E
25|$|The {{practices}} of Maharishi Ayur-Veda {{are said to}} be authentic, though Francis Zimmerman says that they are biased toward gentleness, avoiding violent or painful treatments that were historically part of ayurveda in early India. <b>He</b> <b>also</b> <b>says</b> <b>that</b> Maharishi Ayur-Veda involves an ideological confusion of Ayurvedic categories. In 1985, Maharishi Ayurveda doctors met with outside consultants, who suggested that some traditional Ayurvedic remedies would not be accepted by American consumers. The principal difference between Maharishi Ayur-Veda and traditional Ayurveda is the emphasis on the role of consciousness and the use of Transcendental Meditation, as well as the highlighting of the need to express positive emotions and attuning one's life to the natural rhythms of the body.|$|E

500|$|In his autobiography, I, Me, Mine, Harrison {{states that}} [...] "the 'you' in 'Long Long Long' is God."

500|$|Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic {{said that}} the song {{was a part of}} the side that he calls the very best of the album. <b>He</b> <b>also</b> <b>says</b> <b>that</b> the side is [...] "so strong that it makes the {{remaining}} tracks — all enjoyable, but rather pedestrian — charming by their association with songs so brilliantly alive", and that it was [...] "astonishing it is consistency." [...] Kurt Loder of Rolling Stone said that Lauper [...] "does an almost tasteful reading" [...] of the song.

The band explained the meaning of the title track, which they said is based on a [...] "whirlwind rocker about the pressures on the band members" [...] and how they have changed as they have aged after the release of Ocean Avenue. Key also commented that when he was preoccupied with making the album, there were distractions while in the process; he simply referred to the distractions as [...] "lights and sounds", which ultimately resulted in the band naming the album just that. <b>He</b> <b>also</b> <b>says</b> <b>that</b> the main reason behind that was how it affected the band during that particular time.|$|E

500|$|Herodotus {{reports that}} there were 378 triremes in the Allied fleet, and then breaks the numbers down by city state (as {{indicated}} in the table). However, his numbers for the individual contingents only add up to 371. He does not explicitly say that all 378 fought at Salamis ("All of these came to the war providing triremes...The total number of ships...was three hundred and seventy-eight"), and <b>he</b> <b>also</b> <b>says</b> <b>that</b> the Aeginetans [...] "had other manned ships, but they guarded their own land with these and fought at Salamis with the thirty most seaworthy". Thus it has been supposed {{that the difference between}} the numbers is accounted for a garrison of 12 ships left at Aegina. According to Herodotus, two more ships defected from the Persians to the Greeks, one before Artemisium and one before Salamis, so the total complement at Salamis would have been 373 (or 380).|$|E
500|$|McCain {{acknowledges}} {{having said}} intemperate things in years past, though <b>he</b> <b>also</b> <b>says</b> <b>that</b> many {{stories have been}} exaggerated. One psychoanalytic comparison suggests that McCain {{was not the first}} presidential candidate to have a temper, and cultural critic Julia Keller argues that voters want leaders who are passionate, engaged, fiery, and feisty. McCain has employed both profanity and shouting on occasion, although such incidents have become less frequent over the years. Lieberman has made this observation: [...] "It {{is not the kind of}} anger that is a loss of control. He is a very controlled person." [...] Senator Thad Cochran, who has known McCain for decades and has battled him over earmarks, expressed concern about a McCain presidency: [...] "He is erratic. He is hotheaded. He loses his temper and he worries me." [...] Ultimately Cochran decided to support McCain for president, after it was clear he would win the nomination.|$|E
500|$|Derek Elley from Variety said [...] "A character-driven meller that's a {{treat for}} the eyes, with {{performances}} to match, [...] "Parineeta" [...] is high-end Bollywood near its best". <b>He</b> <b>also</b> <b>says</b> <b>that,</b> [...] "though the climax is still emotionally powerful, it comes over as overcooked." [...] A mixed review from Mid-Day [...] says [...] "Pradeep Sarkar weaves the story like magic, {{especially in the}} first half... excelling in the detailing... the vintage look of the film (that stood out) with authentic costumes, props and the roads of Kolkata". However, the review criticised the film's climax terming it as amateur, thereby diluting the whole film's impact. Another such review came from The Hindu which begins by saying [...] "A simple enough story, but Sarkar tells it well, with some great shots of Shekhar and Lalita together." [...] The review eventually says [...] "Except for the end... where it {{is too much to}} bear." ...|$|E
5000|$|De Jong {{came under}} severe {{criticism}} in 1995 during the European Speed Skating Championships for Men. Although De Jong desired a softer track for the 500 metres and a superhard surface for the 5000 metres, his machinery proved incapable {{of producing a}} decent surface {{for any of the}} races (though the high number of cigarette-smoking spectators was also cited as a factor). Dutch skater Rintje Ritsma was the only skater who managed to cope with the ice, winning the European title, though <b>he</b> <b>also</b> complained, <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> calling the ice [...] "super soft" [...] was an understatement. De Jong took the blame: [...] "I have made one serious mistake in 28 years, and that was today." ...|$|R
5000|$|Zachary Lockman [...] is critical. He <b>says</b> <b>that,</b> as it {{was already}} known that Labor Zionism {{followed}} a national course, Sternhell offers little new perspectives. <b>He</b> <b>also</b> <b>says</b> Sternhell ignores <b>that</b> [...] "the evolving discourse and practices of labor Zionism were profoundly shaped by the concrete circumstances in which would-be Jewish workers found themselves in early twentieth-century Palestine and, above all, by the 'Arab question', the inescapable reality that Arabs constituted {{the great majority of}} the country's population, dominated its labor market, and owned most of its arable land." ...|$|R
