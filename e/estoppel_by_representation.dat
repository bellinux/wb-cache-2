2500|$|A {{representation}} {{can be made}} by statement or conduct.

50|$|Both Halsbury's and Spencer Bower (see below) {{describe}} {{these three}} estoppels collectively as <b>estoppels</b> <b>by</b> <b>representation.</b> More simply, one party must {{say or do}} something and see the other party rely on what is said or done to change behavior.|$|R

[...] Both Halsbury's and Spencer Bower (see below) describe all three estoppels collectively as <b>estoppels</b> <b>by</b> <b>representation.</b> [...] These <b>estoppels</b> can be invoked when a promisee/representee wishes to enforce a promise/representation when no consideration was provided by him.

[...] Estoppel when invoked in such a manner is often considered a rival or alternative to the doctrine of consideration under contract law. [...] Only proprietary estoppel can create a cause of action in English law, though the other two can act in support of a cause of action or a reply to a defence.

2500|$|Estoppel by {{convention}} as {{understood in}} English law (also known as estoppel by agreement) occurs where two parties negotiates or operates a contract {{based on a}} shared assumption or mutual understanding of a legal effect (or interpretation) of that contract, they are bound by that belief, assumption or understanding if (i) they both knew the other operated under the same, and (ii) they both regulated their subsequent dealings on the same.

2500|$|There are a huge {{array of}} {{different}} types of estoppel which can arise under English law. [...] It has been judicially noted on more than one occasions that the link between them is often tenuous. [...] Treitel on Contracts notes that [...] "unconscionability ... provides the link between them." [...] But they nevertheless have [...] "separate requirements and different terrains of application." [...] The courts have generally abandoned any attempt to create a single general underlying rationale or principle; in First National Bank plc v Thompson [...] Ch 231 Lord Millett said: [...] "the attempt... to demonstrate that all estoppels... are now subsumed in the single and all-embracing <b>estoppel</b> <b>by</b> <b>representation</b> and that they are all governed by the same principle [...] never won general acceptance." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{common law}} {{doctrine}} of <b>estoppel</b> <b>by</b> acquiescence is applied when one party gives legal notice {{to a second}} party of a fact or claim, and the second party fails to challenge or refute that claim within a reasonable time. The second party {{is said to have}} acquiesced to the claim, and is estopped from later challenging it, or making a counterclaim. The doctrine is different from <b>estoppel</b> <b>by</b> laches to the extent that a lache may be involuntary but acquiescence involves an intentional act of the party who is accused of aquiescence.|$|R

5000|$|The {{status of}} <b>estoppel</b> <b>by</b> <b>representation</b> of fact {{is less clear}} in Australia. Two seminal {{decisions}} purport to fuse common law and equitable estoppels into a single unified doctrine, but the New South Wales Court of Appeal continues to treat <b>estoppel</b> <b>by</b> <b>representation</b> at common law as distinct from equitable estoppel.
