40|$|The {{design-build}} {{construction industry}} has recognized {{the advantages of}} a collaborative contracting method; however {{it has yet to}} create information systems that can truly support the industry. Many software applications have been created to assist the Design-Builder; however no software provider has created an application that can completely manage the design-build process from beginning to end. Although some software providers have attempted to <b>integrate</b> data <b>between</b> various project management activity modules (estimating, scheduling, accounting, etc), no software provider has resolved the need to <b>integrate</b> data <b>between</b> <b>both</b> project management activity modules and the various phases of the design-build life cycle. The advancements of the design-build industry method of contracting will never be fully achieved until an information system is designed to specifically support the industry. This paper details the conceptual development of a management control system designed to not only integrate data among various project management activities modules but also to <b>integrate</b> data <b>between</b> all phases of the design-build project life cycle.

40|$|The corpus callosum, {{which is}} the largest white matter {{structure}} in the human brain, connects the 2 cerebral hemispheres. It plays a crucial role in maintaining the independent processing of the hemispheres and in <b>integrating</b> information <b>between</b> <b>both</b> hemispheres. The functional integrity of interhemispheric interactions can be tested electrophysiologically in humans by using transcranial magnetic stimulation, electroencephalography, and functional magnetic resonance imaging. As a brain structural imaging, diffusion tensor imaging has revealed the microstructural connectivity underlying interhemispheric interactions. Sex, age, and motor training in addition {{to the size of the}} corpus callosum influence interhemispheric interactions. Several neurological disorders change hemispheric asymmetry directly by impairing the corpus callosum. Moreover, stroke lesions and unilateral peripheral impairments such as amputation alter interhemispheric interactions indirectly. Noninvasive brain stimulation changes the interhemispheric interactions <b>between</b> <b>both</b> motor cortices. Recently, these brain stimulation techniques were applied in the clinical rehabilitation of patients with stroke by ameliorating the deteriorated modulation of interhemispheric interactions. Here, we review the interhemispheric interactions and mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of these interactions and propose rehabilitative approaches for appropriate cortical reorganization...|$|R
40|$|Within public health, {{there is}} a {{tradition}} of co-operation between researchers and communities in planning and implementation of health promotion programs. As a consequence, public-health organizations are characterized by having complex multidisciplinary structure and dynamic organizational goals. In this paper, we discuss the economic impacts {{from the use of}} Participatory Design for development of public-health information systems. Creation of systems that have both utility and usability is suggested to be highlighted as the central goal. The identified prerequisites for a positive impact are that the new system should be of high quality, appropriate {{to the nature of the}} health promotion tasks, and to how activities are coordinated and <b>integrated</b> <b>both</b> <b>between</b> and within the stakeholder groups involved. We argue further that a method that minimizes the information asymmetry in the development process is necessary for avoiding market failures 1. The conclusion is that participatory design will diminish transaction costs, will help to avoid sunk costs, and will contribute to rich efficient use of human and economic resources in public-health organizations...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Complex older adults, such {{as those}} with hip fracture, {{frequently}} require care from multiple professionals {{across a variety of}} settings. <b>Integrated</b> care <b>both</b> <b>between</b> providers and across settings is important to ensure care quality and patient safety. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the core factors related to poorly integrated care when hip fracture patients transition between care settings. Methods: A qualitative, focused ethnographic approach was used to guide data collection and analysis. Patients, their informal caregivers and health care providers were interviewed and observed at each care transition  A total of 45 individual interviews were conducted. Interview transcripts and field notes were coded and analysed to uncover emerging themes in the data. Results:  Four factors related to poorly integrated transitional care were identified: confusion with communication about care, unclear roles and responsibilities, diluted personal ownership over care, and role strain due to system constraints.   Conclusions: Our research supports a broader notion of collaborative practice that extends beyond specific care settings and includes an appropriate, informed role for patients and informal caregivers. This research can help guide system-level and setting-specific interventions designed to promote high-quality, patient-centred care during care transitions. </p...|$|R
40|$|A Manufacturing Execution System (MES) is {{a highly}} complex, large, {{multi-task}} application {{that is used to}} manage production in companies and factories. It monitors and tracks every aspect of all factory-based manufacturing processes. One of the challenges of a MES is to find ways of integrating it with other information techology (IT) systems; i. e., business process management (BPM) systems, so that compatible information may be shared <b>between</b> <b>both</b> systems. This work studies the integration of a local company MES into a BMP to assist with budgeting, in which a data set is gathered from the MES and a soft computing model helps the expert with cost-level estimation. Various modelling methods are used, such as fuzzy rule based ones, in order to determine whether white box or black box models are suitable for the task. The results of the study show how information may be <b>integrated</b> <b>between</b> manufacturing and business management software...|$|R

40|$|We have {{identified}} two genomic islands, that is, BCEGI- 1 and BCEGI- 2, in the genome of Bacillus cereus ATCC 10987, based on comparative analysis with Bacillus cereus ATCC 14579. Furthermore, {{by using the}} cumulative GC profile and performing homology searches between the two genomes, the integration sites of the two genomic islands were determined at single-nucleotide resolution. BCEGI- 1 is <b>integrated</b> <b>between</b> 159705 bp and 198000 bp, whereas BCEGI- 2 is <b>integrated</b> <b>between</b> the end of ORF BCE 4594 {{and the start of}} the intergenic sequence immediately following BCE 4626, that is, from 4256803 bp to 4285534 bp. BCEGI- 1 harbors two bacterial Tn 7 transposons, which have two sets of genes encoding TnsA, B, C, and D. It is generally believed that unlike the TnsABC+E pathway, the TnsABC+D pathway would only promote vertical transmission to daughter cells. The evidence presented in this paper, however, suggests a role of the TnsABC+D pathway in the horizontal transfer of some genomic islands...|$|R
