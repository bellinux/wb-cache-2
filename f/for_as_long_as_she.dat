This was also confirmed by bookkeeper William Goulden in his testimony, who added that Whelan had offered to sell his pistol just six weeks before McGee was killed. Other evidence suggested that Whelan owned the pistol as he was fond of sport shooting.|$|E

At the same time, according to Brennan, Jobs [...] "started to seed people with the notion that I slept around and he was infertile, which meant that this could not be his child."

[...] Four days later, Obama responded to the controversy in a 37-minute speech, speaking openly about race and religion in the United States.

[...] The speech was regarded as [...] "breathtakingly unconventional" [...] in its political strategy and tone, and it received generally positive reviews in the press. The New York Times weighed in with an editorial: [...] "Senator Barack Obama, who has not faced such tests of character this year, faced one on Tuesday.

But years go on. I missed a year in my career—I didn't play that year.
