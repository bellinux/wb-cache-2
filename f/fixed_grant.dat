40|$|This article aims {{to review}} the {{regulatory}} framework governing the Belgian ostomy appliance market {{in the light of}} the experience of Denmark, France, the Netherlands and Ontario (Canada) with regulation of ostomy appliances. Information about the regulatory framework was derived from the international literature, analysis of legal texts and a survey completed by national experts. The comparative analysis revealed that these countries have adopted varying approaches towards regulating their domestic ostomy appliance market. Strategies to keep down prices include public procurement in Denmark, maximum prices in France and exclusion of expensive appliances from reimbursement in the Netherlands. To contain public expenditure on ostomy appliances, consumption patterns are monitored in the Netherlands, the quantity of reimbursed appliances is limited in Belgium and public reimbursement is restricted in Ontario. Ostomy appliances are generally distributed by community pharmacies and medical equipment shops. In countries that emphasise home care delivery such as Denmark, domiciliary distributors dominate the market to the detriment of community pharmacies which do not seem to be able to offer this service at a competitive price. An avenue for reforming the Belgian ostomy appliance market is proposed which valorizes the role of ostomy care nurses in guiding the choice of ostomy appliances. Furthermore, it is recommended that a competitive tendering process determines the price of ostomy appliances, that reimbursement for service provision by distributors is separated from reimbursement of appliances, and that patients receive a <b>fixed</b> <b>grant</b> from the third-party payer to buy ostomy appliances. status: publishe...|$|E

This article analyzes the dynamics of hospital {{emergency services}} in terms of the key products and cost drivers. It reviews the currently available systems for categorizing emergency activity and evaluates their applicability for funding purposes with particular emphasis on the susceptibility to gaming of both triage and disposition, it identifies and evaluates 3 models for use in single-payer health systems for funding hospital emergency services (fully variable, fully fixed, and mixed variable/fixed) in terms of the key products and cost drivers in the ED. Approaches to the setting and rebasing of <b>fixed</b> <b>grants</b> are considered.

40|$|In {{rangeland}} areas, improved biodiversity management can {{be achieved}} by changing the financial incentives facing land managers. Competitive tenders and <b>fixed</b> price <b>grants</b> can both be applied to achieve the same environmental outcomes. In the case study described in this paper, the efficiencies of the two methods are compared. Operationally, the two mechanisms are similar in both cost and process. Both mechanisms have very important indirect benefits of building skills and knowledge in both landholders and the implementing agency, and building trust between the two. However, the heterogeneity in landholders’ opportunity costs revealed in the competitive tender trial means a discriminatory price mechanism is more efficient at matching program costs with direct environmental benefits. In terms of transfer payments, the competitive tender was 30 % more cost efficient than a <b>fixed</b> price <b>grant</b> scheme. While the initial design and development costs of a tender may be greater than a grant, {{there was no evidence of}} any difference in operating costs in this case study. There was also little evidence of any indirect costs associated with the tender process, but it may be too early to make a realistic assessment...|$|R

M.A.O College Aligarh stressed more upon English language and the modern science subjects whereas Darl-Ul-Uloom Deoband neglected the modern western knowledge altogether.

Under these circumstances, Nadva aimed at producing the graduate well versed in both Western knowledge and religious education.

Generally, the firm's choice coincides with three social aims: First, a project that the firm would conduct in any case should not be subsidized. Second, a project should not be subsidized if its social value is negative. Third, the subsidy should provide an incentive to maximize a project's social value. Using a simulation over a range of hypothetical research projects it is shown that the efficiency of conditional loans and normal grants declines drastically as the government's information about project parameters becomes poorer, while the incentive subsidy performs consistently well...|$|R
