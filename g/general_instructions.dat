5|$|In his {{published}} score Monteverdi lists around 41 {{instruments to}} be deployed, with distinct groups of instruments used to depict particular scenes and characters. Thus strings, harpsichords and recorders represent the pastoral fields of Thrace with their nymphs and shepherds, while heavy brass illustrates the underworld and its denizens. Composed {{at the point}} of transition from the Renaissance era to the Baroque, L'Orfeo employs all the resources then known within the art of music, with particularly daring use of polyphony. The work is not orchestrated as such; in the Renaissance tradition instrumentalists followed the composer's <b>general</b> <b>instructions</b> but were given considerable freedom to improvise.|$|E
500|$|On 22 July 1908, the Newport Conference was held; this {{included}} the General Board, {{the staff of}} the Naval War College, President Theodore Roosevelt—who had a keen interest in naval matters—and other officers. This conference examined a series of issues relating to existing battleships and new designs; the first of these new ships would become the Wyoming class. The Board on Construction received <b>general</b> <b>instructions</b> from the Newport Conference; those at the conference favored adopting the 14-inch gun, as the British Royal Navy had already traded their 12-inch guns for [...] pieces. The Bureau of Ordnance (BuOrd) estimated that design work on the new gun, production, and testing would take two years. On 26 August, the Secretary of the Navy, Victor Metcalf, issued a request for eight- and ten-gun battleships armed with the 14-inch weapons to the Bureau of Construction and Repair (C). Speed was to be at least , with as much armor as could be accommodated.|$|E
500|$|The Beetons partly {{followed}} {{the layout of}} Acton's recipes, although with a major alteration: whereas the earlier writer provided the method of cooking followed by {{a list of the}} required ingredients, the recipes in The Englishwoman's Domestic Magazine listed the components before the cooking process. Isabella's standardised layout used for the recipes also showed the approximate costs of each serving, the seasonality of the ingredients and the number of portions per dish. According to the twentieth-century British cookery writer Elizabeth David, one of the strengths of Isabella's writing was in the [...] "clarity and details of her <b>general</b> <b>instructions,</b> her brisk comments, her no-nonsense asides". Margaret Beetham, the historian, sees that one of the strengths of the book was the [...] "consistent principle of organisation which made its heterogeneous contents look uniform and orderly", and brought a consistent style in presentation and layout. Whereas Daly and Forman consider such an approach as [...] "nothing if not formulaic", Hughes sees it as [...] "the thing most beloved by the mid Victorians, a system".|$|E

500|$|On 19 July 1941 Himmler {{assigned}} Fegelein's regiments to {{the general}} command of HSSPF Erich von dem Bach-Zelewski for the [...] "systematic combing" [...] of the Pripyat swamps, an operation designed to round up and exterminate Jews, partisans and civilians in that area of Byelorussian SSR. Himmler's orders for the operation were passed to Fegelein via SS-Brigadefuhrer , who met with him and Bach-Zelewski on 28 July in their new quarters at Liakhovichi in Byelorussia. <b>General</b> <b>instructions</b> were given to [...] "cleanse" [...] the area of partisans and Jewish collaborators. Jewish {{women and children were}} to be driven away. Fegelein interpreted these orders as follows: Enemy soldiers in uniform were to be taken prisoner, and those found out of uniform were to be shot. Jewish males, {{with the exception of a}} few skilled workers such as doctors and leather workers, would be shot. Fegelein split the territory to be covered into two sections divided by the Pripyat River, with the 1st Regiment taking the northern half and the 2nd Regiment the south. The regiments worked their way from east to west through their assigned territory, and filed daily reports on the number of people killed and taken prisoner. In a meeting with Bach-Zelewski on 31 July, Himmler announced the amalgamation of the two regiments into the SS Cavalry Brigade. Additional units such as a bicycle reconnaissance detachment were formed and added to the brigade's complement. On 5 August Himmler assigned leadership of the brigade to Fegelein.|$|E

2500|$|A reduced {{instruction}} set computer, or RISC (pronounced 'risk', [...] ), is one whose {{instruction set}} architecture (ISA) has {{a set of}} attributes that allows it to have a lower cycles per instruction (CPI) than a {{complex instruction set computer}} (CISC). Various suggestions have been made regarding a precise definition of RISC, but the general concept is that of a computer that has a small set of simple and <b>general</b> <b>instructions,</b> rather than a large set of complex and specialized instructions. Another common RISC trait is their load/store architecture, where memory is only accessed through specific instructions, rather than as a part of most instructions.|$|E

2500|$|The {{main road}} across the Maya Pass ascends from the French side {{to reach the}} Spanish village of Urdax. From Urdax, the road rises to the pass before {{descending}} toward Elizondo. Farther east the Gorospil path rises from the French village of Espelette before passing near the Aretesque knoll. Then the path turns west along the Maya ridge and crosses the main road. The Gorospil path later {{became known as the}} Chemin des Anglais after the British improved it. There was a lot of dead ground in front of the Maya ridge and d'Erlon resolved to take advantage of it. D'Erlon sent Maransin's division up the main road but gave that <b>general</b> <b>instructions</b> to stay out of sight until the other two divisions seized the east end of the ridge. That morning, Darmagnac's division marched from Espelette on the Gorospil path with Abbé's division following right behind.|$|E
2500|$|British {{planning}} for the battle introduced daily objectives, which led GHQ and the Fourth Army headquarters setting objectives and leaving corps and divisional commanders, discretion about the means to achieve them. By June, each corps was liaising with neighbouring corps and divisions, an example being that divisions were asked to send in wire-cutting timetables, so that the heavy artillery (under corps command) could refrain from bombarding the same areas, reducing visibility needed to observe {{the effect of the}} divisional artillery. In VIII Corps, the plan ran to [...] with [...] including details for infantry companies. (Despite being one of the three corps to use a creeping barrage, none of the VIII Corps objectives were reached.) Other corps made similar plans but went into less detail than VIII Corps, all conforming to the <b>general</b> <b>instructions</b> contained in the Fourth Army Tactical Notes. Planning in the Third Army for the attack on Gommecourt, showed a similar pattern of discussion and negotiation between divisions, corps and army headquarters. Lieutenant-General T. O. Snow the VII Corps commander, made representations to the Third Army that Gommecourt was the wrong place for a diversion but was over-ruled, because the staff at GHQ considered the protection of the left flank of VIII Corps from artillery-fire from the north, to be more important.|$|E
2500|$|The series {{score is}} {{composed}} by Wendy Melvoin and Lisa Coleman, with music engineer Michael Perfitt and vocals provided by Shankar. Each episode averages thirty to thirty-five minutes of music. Melvoin and Coleman {{became involved with}} Heroes from their previous work with executive producer Allan Arkush. Kring gave <b>general</b> <b>instructions</b> to the pair, including the emotion and direction for each character. Kring wanted incredibly unusual music and gave Melvoin and Coleman a lot of freedom and permission to experiment. In the pilot episode, Kring suggested that a [...] "dreamy" [...] cue {{be used in the}} scene involving Claire Bennet running into a burning train. The [...] "dreamy" [...] cue has since become a signature piece of the show. Melvoin and Coleman developed musical cues for each character. Claude's theme involved wind and voices to create the feeling of a ghost-like presence. Sylar's involves marimbas and bassoons with staccato to re-create the sound of clocks ticking in reference to the character's power. Matt Parkman's theme involves voices being played backwards when he uses his power of telepathy. Peter Petrelli's theme involves marcato strings. Niki Sanders's theme was based on her character's alter-ego named Jessica and involved winds and Indian voices chanting in an underscore to give a feeling that she was possessed. Mohinder Suresh's theme is the piano composition that plays at the end of some episodes.|$|E
