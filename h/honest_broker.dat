500|$|In June 1973 Hordern {{appeared}} on radio for the BBC as Jeeves in an adaption of P.G. Wodehouse's [...] "Jeeves" [...] stories, alongside Richard Briers as Bertie Wooster. The following year, Hordern narrated several other, one-off programmes for the broadcaster, including The <b>Honest</b> <b>Broker,</b> The Last Tsar, and Tell the King the Sky Is Falling. In 1975 Hordern played {{the judge in}} Howard Barker's play Stripwell at the Royal Court Theatre. Hordern described the character as [...] "a man wracked by guilt, full of self-doubt and pessimism". It was a role which the actor found to be too close to his own personality for comfort. [...] His time in the play was marred by personal problems; he and Eve had briefly separated and the actor was forced to rent a small flat in Sloane Square from the actor Michael Wilding after being banished from the family home. Hordern and Eve soon reconciled, {{but it was a}} time which he was keen to forget, including the play. Critics were complimentary of his performance, with one writing: [...] "Stripwells ambiguities are therefore viewed half affectionately and half contemptuously and this comes over well in Michael Hordern's portrayal of bumbling, sometimes endearing ineffectiveness, as skilful and accomplished a performance as one would expect from this actor." ...|$|E
2500|$|Having unified his nation, Bismarck now devoted {{himself to}} {{promoting}} peace in Europe with his skills in statesmanship. He {{was forced to}} contend with French revanchism, the desire to avenge the losses of the Franco-Prussian War. Bismarck, therefore, engaged in a policy of diplomatically isolating France while maintaining cordial relations with other nations in Europe. He {{had little interest in}} naval or colonial entanglements and thus avoided discord with Great Britain. Historians emphasize that he wanted no more territorial gains after 1871, and vigorously worked to form cross-linking alliances that prevented any war in Europe from starting. A. J. P. Taylor, a leading British diplomatic historian, concludes that, [...] "Bismarck was an <b>honest</b> <b>broker</b> of peace; and his system of alliances compelled every Power, whatever its will, to follow a peaceful course." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hasluck granted Whitlam {{a double}} {{dissolution}} in April 1974 (with an election on 18 May) when the Liberal Opposition threatened {{to block the}} Budget bills in the Senate. Hasluck's term as Governor-General was due to expire in July 1974. Whitlam had offered to extend his term, but Hasluck declined, citing his wife's refusal to remain at Yarralumla longer than the originally agreed five years. Historians of the period are certain that if Hasluck had still been Governor-General in 1975, the constitutional crisis of that year would have ended differently. Hasluck himself implied this in his book, The Office of Governor-General, {{and also in the}} Queale Lecture. [...] He was even more explicit in his 1985 interview with Clyde Cameron for the National Library of Australia's Oral History series, which was not released until 2010. [...] He said he doubted he would have discussed with anyone but Whitlam the Senate's 1975 refusal to approve Supply; that Kerr erred in taking advice from Malcolm Fraser prior to appointing him as prime minister; and that [...] "the function of the governor-general is not to be the <b>honest</b> <b>broker</b> in political situations".|$|E

2500|$|In a March 2016 {{speech at}} the University of Ottawa, Dion used [...] "responsible conviction" [...] – a term syncretized {{from the work of}} German {{sociologist}} Max Weber – to describe the Trudeau government's foreign policy. Dion sought re-engagement with the world, including authoritarian regimes such as Russia and Iran and a focus on multilateralism, climate change, and the United Nations. Dion indicated that Canada would oppose capital punishment for Canadians imprisoned abroad and would change its contribution to the fight against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant from providing airstrikes to providing special forces trainers. Dion also tied the concept of responsible conviction to continuing some policies of the previous Stephen Harper government in a modified manner, such as continuing its maternal and newborn health initiative but with new funding for abortion and family planning. He also justified continuing a $15 billion sale of light armored vehicles to Saudi Arabia despite its human rights abuses to protect Canadian jobs and preserve Canada's credibility in signing major international deals, but committed to reassessing the rules on Canadian export permits so that future deals would conform to Canadian interests such as human rights promotion. Dion ended his speech by rejecting the concept of Canada as an <b>honest</b> <b>broker,</b> because that term had become too associated with moral relativism and lack of conviction, instead saying that Canada had to be [...] "a fair-minded and determined peace builder." ...|$|E
2500|$|Chrétien was {{the chief}} {{negotiator}} {{of what would be}} called the [...] "Kitchen Accord", an agreement which led to the agreement of nine provinces to patriation. In the Kitchen Accord, Chrétien, Roy McMurtry and Roy Romanow came up with the compromise of Section 33, the so-called [...] "notwithstanding clause" [...] allowing Parliament and provincial legislatures to overrule the courts in Charter cases. Chrétien remembered that Trudeau [...] "hated" [...] the idea of Section 33 and that he had to tell him: [...] "Pierre, if you don’t take the notwithstanding clause, you don’t have the Charter." [...] Trudeau only accepted Section 33 when the Ontario Premier Bill Davis, who together with New Brunswick Premier Richard Hatfield, were the only premiers supporting the federal government phoned him to say he would join the [...] "Gang of 8" [...] if Trudeau did not accept Section 33, which Chrétien remembered changed Trudeau's attitude completely. In a 2012 interview, Chrétien defended the controversial Section 33, saying: [...] "Because some would argue that in a society the elected people have to be supreme — not judges — and I subscribe to that. Look at what happened in the United States where the judges reign according to their so-called philosophy. That is not the tradition here." [...] With the exception of Parti Québécois Quebec Premier René Lévesque, all of the [...] "Gang of 8" [...] premiers accepted the compromise of Section 33. Chrétien's role in the dealings, however, would not be forgotten in his native province of Quebec, which did not ratify the Constitution Act of 1982 (although the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that Quebec was bound by it). One of Trudeau's aides Barry Strayer later said about Chrétien's role in the constitutional battle: [...] "He was able to contemplate compromises that Trudeau would have been able to. Everybody saw him as a <b>honest</b> <b>broker.</b> Without him you could argue it would not have happened".|$|E

40|$|Presidents attract {{extremely}} smart, ambitious {{people to}} serve in the White House, but the quality of the advice the president receives depends upon how he or she uses the available talent. Chief executives face daunting challenges in evaluating the onslaught of information, judging the perspectives of their subordinates, and ensuring that they receive advice based on presidential perspectives rather than the priorities of their subordinates. Political scientists who study presidential decision making have come to consider several factors as central to understanding White House organization and process: the level of central-ization, the extent of multiple advocacy, and the use of <b>honest</b> <b>brokers</b> to manage advice to the president. This article examines President Obama’s decision-making style with respect to these three factors and uses several case studies to illustrate them: economic policy, detainee policy, and decision making on the war in Afghanistan. Centralization, Multiple Advocacy, and <b>Honest</b> <b>Brokers</b> Presidents have dealt with the challenges of obtaining useful information and advice in a variety of ways.

But {{on all sides}} there came evidence that those preparations for war which had been quietly going on even before the Jameson Raid were now being hurriedly perfected. For so small a State enormous sums were being spent upon military equipment. Cases of rifles and boxes of cartridges streamed into the arsenal, not only from Delagoa Bay, but even, to the indignation of the English colonists, through Cape Town and Port Elizabeth. Huge packing-cases, marked 'Agricultural Instruments' and 'Mining Machinery,' arrived from Germany and France, to find their places in the forts of Johannesburg or Pretoria. As early as May the Orange Free State President, who was looked upon by the simple and trustful British as the <b>honest</b> <b>broker</b> {{who was about to}} arrange a peace, was writing to Grobler, the Transvaal official, claiming his share of the twenty-five million cartridges which had then been imported.

60|$|The Marquis of Villarel had {{of course}} gone long before. The {{man who was}} there was another type of Carlist altogether, and his {{temperament}} {{was that of a}} trader. He was the chief purveyor of the Legitimist armies, an <b>honest</b> <b>broker</b> of stores, and enjoyed a great reputation for cleverness. His important task kept him, of course, in France, but his young wife, whose beauty and devotion to her King were well known, represented him worthily at Headquarters, where his own appearances were extremely rare. The dissimilar but united loyalties of those two people had been rewarded by the title of baron and the ribbon of some order or other. The gossip of the Legitimist circles appreciated those favours with smiling indulgence. He was the man who had been so distressed and frightened by Doña Rita’s first visit to Tolosa. He had an extreme regard for his wife. And in that sphere of clashing arms and unceasing intrigue nobody would have smiled then at his agitation if the man himself hadn’t been somewhat grotesque.|$|E

30|$|Practical {{considerations}} for {{making such a}} proposal work would be paramount, and so experimentation is necessary. Competition could be structured so that firms doing well in providing advice and counseling according to workforce performance measures gain market share. Individuals registering for training would be referred to one of several providers of counseling. More effective providers will be given progressively more referrals, by reallocating the flow of beneficiaries over time, while ineffective providers will see their client base decrease. Considerable attention {{would need to be}} devoted to preventing selection of particular trainees by providers. Referrals could be assigned randomly, or on a rotational basis, to allow direct comparisons of the average performances of different providers (Bartik [1995]). Finally, to avoid conflicts of interest, it would also be necessary that these intermediaries have no connection to the underlying service providers. A regulatory firewall could prohibit financial ties between providers and employers with whom individuals are placed, to solidify the counselors’ role as <b>honest</b> <b>brokers.</b> It could be possible for government and private providers to operate in the same market, with each receiving fixed funding per person served.|$|R

40|$|Ethical {{practices}} in ecological field research {{differ from those}} in laboratory research in more than the technical set-ting and the important distinction between population-level and individual-based concerns. The number of stakeholders affected by the conduct of field research is far larger; private landholders, public water utilities, public land managers, local industries, and communities large and small are only {{some of those who}} may be impacted. As research review boards move to establish specific ethical practices for field biologists, the process of identifying appropriate standards will affect the degree to which research will ultimately be disrupted.

Already, standards that have conflicted with the primary val-ues of a key interest have resulted in disruptions to research and scientific progress. One way to manage this problem of deeply competing interests is to avoid the deepest offenses to any relevant interest group in the design of a proposed study. This is an application of the precautionary principle and is likely to generate a more sustainable balance among compet-ing interests. Unfortunately, this process is also likely to be a never-ending, consensus-seeking process. Fortunately, scien-tists can have enormous influence on the process if they choose to engage in it early.

40|$|Understanding the {{diverging}} {{opinions of}} academic experts, stakeholders {{and the public}} is important for effective conservation management. This is especially so when a consensus is needed for action to minimize future risks but the knowledge upon which to base this action is uncertain or missing. How to manage non-native, invasive species (NIS) is an interesting case in point: the issue has long been controversial among stakeholders, but publicly visible, major disagreement among experts is recent. To characterize the multitude of experts’ understanding and valuation of non-native, NIS we performed structured qualitative interviews with 26 academic experts, 13 of whom were invasion biologists and 13 landscape experts. Within both groups, thinking varied widely, not only about basic concepts (e. g., non-native, invasive) but also about their valuation of effects of NIS. The divergent opinions among experts, regarding both the overall severity {{of the problem in}} Europe and its importance for ecosystem services, contrasted strongly with the apparent consensus that emerges from scientific synthesis articles and policy documents. We postulate that the observed heterogeneity of expert judgments is related to three major factors: (1) diverging conceptual understandings, (2) lack of empirical information and high scientific uncertainties due to complexities and contingencies of invasion processes, and (3) missing deliberation of values. Based on theory from science studies, we interpret the notion of an NIS as a boundary object, i. e., concepts that have a similar but not identical meaning to different groups of experts and stakeholders. This interpretative flexibility of a concept can facilitate interaction across diverse groups but bears the risk of introducing misunderstandings. An alternative to seeking consensus on exact definitions and risk assessments would be for invasive species experts to acknowledge uncertainties and engage transparently with stakeholders and the public in deliberations about conflicting opinions, taking the role of <b>honest</b> <b>brokers</b> of policy alternatives rather than of issue advocates...|$|R

It deserves a closer look It’s called the Australian Infrastructure Plan, but it really isn’t one. The report {{released}} on Wednesday by Infrastructure Australia, the little engine of whom we expect so much, reveals that it has had time to evaluate only two of the ninety-three infrastructure proposals that state and territory governments have proposed for federal funding. That’s not surprising. This financial year Infrastructure Australia had its average staffing level increased by almost 40 per cent: from eleven to fifteen. The Productivity Commission has a staff of 167. Yes, Infrastructure Australia has another twelve people on its board who are pretty cluey on infrastructure issues, and a larger budget for consultants than for staff.
