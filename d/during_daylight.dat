5|$|An {{unexpected}} {{adverse effect}} of {{daylight saving time}} {{may lie in the}} fact that an extra part of morning rush hour traffic occurs before dawn and traffic emissions then cause higher air pollution than <b>during</b> <b>daylight</b> hours.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, it was {{reported}} that N.rajah has a similar mutualistic relationship with the summit rat (Rattus baluensis). Whereas the mountain treeshrew visits pitchers <b>during</b> <b>daylight</b> hours, the summit rat is primarily active at night; this may be an example of resource partitioning. Daily scat deposition rates were found to be similar for both mammalian species.|$|E

5|$|The 5th Cavalry Division {{remained}} to garrison Afulah, {{where they were}} rejoined later that day by the 15th Imperial Service Cavalry Brigade and their divisional artillery, which had been left the night before {{to move through the}} Abu Shusheh pass <b>during</b> <b>daylight.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{magnitude}} of winds offshore are {{nearly double the}} wind speed observed onshore. This is attributed to the differences in friction between land masses and offshore waters. Sometimes, there are even directional differences, particularly if local sea breezes change the wind on shore <b>during</b> <b>daylight</b> hours.|$|E
5|$|A {{parabolic}} trough {{consists of a}} linear parabolic reflector that concentrates light onto a receiver positioned along the reflector's focal line. The receiver is a tube positioned right above {{the middle of the}} parabolic mirror and is filled with a working fluid. The reflector is made to follow the sun <b>during</b> <b>daylight</b> hours by tracking along a single axis. Parabolic trough systems provide the best land-use factor of any solar technology. The SEGS plants in California and Acciona's Nevada Solar One near Boulder City, Nevada are representatives of this technology.|$|E
5000|$|The service still {{continues}} {{to carry out}} non-emergency hospital transfers <b>during</b> both <b>daylight</b> and darkness hours.|$|R
50|$|Kizukuri Station has {{a single}} {{ground-level}} side platform serving a single bi-directional line. The station building is attended <b>during</b> normal <b>daylight</b> operating hours.|$|R
5000|$|Nat dokkaebi (낮도깨비; {{literally}} day dokkaebi): Unlike other dokkaebi, these appear <b>during</b> the <b>daylight.</b> They {{are known}} to give dokkaebi gamtus to humans.|$|R
5|$|Another {{factor was}} the weather within the {{operational}} theater. The cyclical monsoon patterns {{meant that the}} weather was deplorable for flight operations eight {{months of the year}} (from late September to early May) when rain and fog tended to conceal targets. Lack of adequate all-weather and night-bombing capability made it necessary for the majority of U.S. missions to be conducted <b>during</b> <b>daylight</b> hours, thereby easing the burden on the air defense forces of North Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|Considering {{the weight}} of attack against airfields, hardly any fighters were {{destroyed}} on the ground. Figures indicated just two Spitfires and six Hurricanes were lost in this manner. The main reason for this was the high state of readiness of RAF units <b>during</b> <b>daylight.</b> The command depended on radar and the Observer Corps warning them in advance, giving them {{plenty of time to}} get airborne. The successful strafing attack by Bf 109s of JG 52 on Manston depended on a combination of circumstances and chance which did not occur often during the battle.|$|E
5|$|Dromedaries {{are mainly}} active <b>during</b> <b>daylight</b> hours. They form herds of about 20 individuals, which {{are led by}} a {{dominant}} male. This camel feeds on foliage and desert vegetation; several adaptations, {{such as the ability}} to tolerate losing more than 30% of its total water content, allow it to thrive in its desert habitat. Mating occurs annually and peaks in the rainy season; females bear a single calf after a gestation of 15 months.|$|E
50|$|The Charles C. Jensen Botanical Gardens are {{botanical gardens}} located at 8520 Fair Oaks Boulevard, Carmichael, California. They are open <b>during</b> the <b>daylight</b> hours without charge.|$|R
50|$|The band segment 10.120 to 10.140 {{may only}} be used for SSB {{transmissions}} {{in the area of}} Africa south of the equator <b>during</b> local <b>daylight</b> hours.|$|R
50|$|This band {{supports}} both {{long distance}} (DX) communications between late afternoon {{and a few}} hours after sunrise, and short distance NVIS contacts <b>during</b> most <b>daylight</b> hours.|$|R
5|$|Early in {{the morning}} of 28January, the 4thDestroyer Flotilla resumed its journey south and put into Bergen. Z31 entered one of the town's docks to be {{repaired}} while Z34 and Z38 departed on the evening of 28January. The two ships were attacked from the air the next day, but did not suffer any damage and sheltered in a fjord south of Stavanger <b>during</b> <b>daylight</b> hours. They put to sea again on the evening of 29January and eventually reached Kiel in Germany on 1February.|$|E
5|$|From {{the time}} of the battle until several months later, almost all Allied {{supplies}} and reinforcements sent to Guadalcanal came by transports in small convoys, mainly <b>during</b> <b>daylight</b> hours, while Allied aircraft from the New Hebrides and Henderson Field and any available aircraft carriers flew covering missions. During this time, Allied forces on Guadalcanal received barely enough ammunition and provisions to withstand the several Japanese drives to retake the islands.|$|E
5|$|Naked eye {{observations}} of Venus <b>during</b> <b>daylight</b> hours exist in several anecdotes and records. Astronomer Edmund Halley calculated its maximum naked eye brightness in 1716, when many Londoners were alarmed by its {{appearance in the}} daytime. French emperor Napoleon Bonaparte once witnessed a daytime apparition of the planet while at a reception in Luxembourg. Another historical daytime observation of the planet {{took place during the}} inauguration of the American president Abraham Lincoln in Washington, D.C., on 4 March 1865. Although naked eye visibility of Venus phases is disputed, records exist of {{observations of}} its crescent.|$|E

50|$|Capped herons move {{frequently}} between feeding sites, sometimes flying up to 100m. They may be crepuscular, {{but have}} been observed foraging <b>during</b> broad <b>daylight,</b> unlike the night-herons. They usually hunt solitarily.|$|R
50|$|Mutsu-Morita Station has a dual opposed side {{platform}}s, but one {{platform is}} not in use, and the other serves bi-directional traffic. The station building is attended <b>during</b> normal <b>daylight</b> operating hours.|$|R
5|$|The University Parks are a 70-acre (28 ha) parkland {{area in the}} {{northeast}} of the city. It {{is open to the}} public <b>during</b> <b>daylight</b> hours. As well as providing gardens and exotic plants, the Parks contains numerous sports fields, used for official and unofficial fixtures, and also contains sites of special interest including the Genetic Garden, an experimental garden to elucidate and investigate evolutionary processes.|$|E
5|$|The {{originally}} intended 12-pounder guns were exchanged for sixteen 4-in (102mm) QF Mk III guns {{early in the}} construction process. They were positioned in the superstructure and on turret roofs in open mounts as they were {{not expected to be}} manned in a ship-to-ship engagement <b>during</b> <b>daylight.</b> During 1914–15 the turret roof guns were transferred to the superstructure and the total number of guns was reduced to twelve. All of the remaining guns were enclosed in casemates and given blast shields at that time to better protect the gun crews from weather and enemy action.|$|E
5|$|The willie wagtail {{is almost}} always on the move and rarely still {{for more than a}} few moments <b>during</b> <b>daylight</b> hours. Even while {{perching}} it will flick its tail from side to side, twisting about looking for prey. Birds are mostly encountered singly or in pairs, although they may gather in small flocks. Unlike other fantails, much of its time is spent on the ground. It beats its wings deeply in flight, interspersed with a swift flying dip. It characteristically wags its tail upon landing after a short dipping flight.|$|E

5000|$|The {{plan for}} {{operation}} of the yacht was to leave Portland at night, so that the Columbia River bar could be crossed <b>during</b> the <b>daylight</b> of early morning. The return to Portland would be made <b>during</b> the <b>daylight,</b> with a stop at Astoria, so that passengers who wished could disembark and take the train back to Portland. [...] It was intended to make the run from Portland to Tillamook three times per week. [...] At the yacht's anticipated speed of 18 miles per hour, was about a four-hour sea voyage {{from the mouth of}} the Columbia river to the wharf at Bay Ocean.|$|R
50|$|It {{generally}} rests <b>during</b> the <b>daylight,</b> {{with fewer}} than twelve other bats in a cave, although a cave was once found with thirty-five bats. It also shares its food via regurgitation, mouth to mouth.|$|R
5|$|With an {{apparent}} magnitude of +0.08, Capella is {{the brightest star}} in the constellation Auriga, the sixth-brightest star in the night sky, the third-brightest star in the northern celestial hemisphere (after Arcturus and Vega), and the fourth-brightest star {{visible to the naked eye}} from the latitude 40° N. It appears to be a rich yellowish-white color, although the yellow color is more apparent <b>during</b> <b>daylight</b> observation with a telescope, due to the contrast against the blue sky.|$|E
5|$|With {{the bowl}} game, Maryland {{finished}} {{the season with}} an 8–5 record. The win was Maryland's 600thin school history. Ralph Friedgen's postseason record improved to 4–2, which gave him twice as many bowl wins as any other head coach in school history. For the 2008 season, Maryland stood 5–1in games decided by seven points or less and 8–0in games kicked off <b>during</b> <b>daylight</b> hours.|$|E
5|$|After hatching, {{the larvae}} spend another 72 hours absorb their yolk sacs and {{developing}} their fins {{before they become}} free-swimming fry. The fry forage <b>during</b> <b>daylight</b> in a dense school {{and return to the}} cave or crevice for the night. Like other cichlids, the parents retrieve their young just before dark, sucking up three or four at a time and delivering them into the nest. The parents anticipate night, using a sense of time; in laboratory experiments convict cichlids continued to retrieve young as night approached {{even in the absence of}} any signal, such as dimming light. During the night, the fry bunch up at the bottom of the cave or nest, where the parents fan them.|$|E
