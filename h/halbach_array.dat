40|$|Cylindrical linear {{synchronous}} motor. Abstract. The proposed {{magnetic circuit}} precisely evaluates magnetic fluxes between the field magnets of dual <b>Halbach</b> <b>arrays.</b> In {{the case that}} an actuator is configured with the dual Halback arrays and the armature coils between them, the air gap length between the dual <b>Halbach</b> <b>arrays</b> gives {{the maximum number of}} interlinkage magnetic fluxes with the armature coil through algebraic approach. The new design method is {{on the basis of the}} proposed magnetic circuit. This method makes it clear that the air gap length should be more than 1. 2 times longer than the permanent magnet poles length. The utility of this design method is verified through designing cylindrical linear synchronous motor provided with the dual <b>Halbach</b> <b>arrays...</b>|$|R

40|$|The Inductrack {{magnetic}} levitation system, {{developed at the}} Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, is being studied for its possible use for launching rockets. Under NASA sponsorship, a small model system is being constructed at the Laboratory to pursue key technical aspects of this proposed application. The Inductrack is a passive {{magnetic levitation}} system employing special arrays of high-field permanent magnets (<b>Halbach</b> <b>arrays)</b> on the levitating carrier, moving above a "track" consisting of a close-packed array of shorted coils with which are interleaved with special drive coils. <b>Halbach</b> <b>arrays</b> produce a strong spatially periodic magnetic field on the front surface of the arrays, while canceling the field on their back surface. Relative motion between the <b>Halbach</b> <b>arrays</b> and the track coils induces currents in those coils. These currents levitate the carrier cart by interacting with the horizontal component of the magnetic field. Pulsed currents in the drive coils, synchronized with {{the motion of the}} carrier, interact with the vertical component of the magnetic field to provide acceleration forces. Motional stability, including resistance to both vertical and lateral aerodynamic forces, is provided by having <b>Halbach</b> <b>arrays</b> that interact with both the upper and the lower sides of the track coils. In its completed form the model system that is under construction will have a track approximately 100 meters in length along which the carrier cart will be propelled up to peak speeds of Mach 0. 4 to 0. 5 before being decelerated. Preliminary studies of the parameters of a full-scale system have also been made. These studies address the problems of scale-up, including means to simplify the track construction and to reduce the cost of the pulsed-power systems needed for propulsion...|$|R
40|$|In {{the paper}} {{presented}} here the optimization of <b>Halbach</b> <b>arrays</b> as storage media for mechanical potential energy is investigated with numerical simulations using FEMM and analytical calculations using the Maxwell stress tensor. Two opposing <b>Halbach</b> <b>arrays</b> form a "magnetic spring" and mechanical potential energy is stored when this structure is compressed. It is here {{seen that the}} wavelength of the magnetization in the material and the dimensions greatly influence the stored energy density. A clear region of maximum is identified which leads to important conclusions on how the material should be employed. The suggested approach for storing energy have advantages and approximately 250 kJ/m 3 can be reached. The main drawback is the large prize of rare earth metals such as Neodymium.

40|$|This paper proposes and investigates an {{analytical}} method {{for assessing the}} risk of potential, irreversible demagnetisation in the PMs of electrical machines, equipped with n-stages, <b>Halbach</b> <b>arrays.</b> The higher risk of demagnetisation, synonymous with <b>Halbach</b> <b>arrays</b> imposes that the method be both load and temperature dependant. In fact, the proposed method studies the magnetic field distribution in the air-gap and PM region, for various operating temperatures and expresses these fields as analytical expressions for the no-load and peak load conditions. The model can cater for <b>Halbach</b> <b>arrays</b> with up to n stages, thus making it a versatile tool that can be utilised for various Halbach configurations. Finite element analysis is used to validate the method. The analytical tool is then used for the design and analysis of a high torque density, outer rotor, traction motor. The motor is for an aerospace application and its operating duty cycle imposes very high, short time, peak load conditions at elevated temperatures, posing an elevated risk of irreversible, PM demagnetisation. The model is used to investigate various Halbach configurations for this application, {{in order to reduce}} the demagnetisation risk and also improve the general performance of the machine. The analytical method thus provides a computationally efficient tool that can be used to predict and prevent demagnetisation in Halbach-equipped, electrical machines operating in harsh environments such as the aerospace sector...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel analytical model that accurately predicts the current–force {{characteristic of a}} 2 degrees-of-freedom moving magnet linear motor (MMLM), where its translator is formed by a Halbach permanent magnet (PM) array. Unlike existing theoretical models, the uniqueness of this proposed model {{is based on a}} derived magnetic field model that accounts for the magnetic flux leakage {{at the edges of the}} <b>Halbach</b> PM <b>array.</b> Hence, it can be used to model an MMLM that employs a low-order <b>Halbach</b> PM <b>array</b> effectively. To implement the proposed model in high sampling rate control system, a model-based approximation approach is proposed to simplify the model. The simplified model minimizes the computation complexity while guarantees the accuracy of the current–force prediction.
