500|$|The {{white flesh}} is [...] fibrous and thick, though thins with age. Somewhat brittle, it can {{sometimes}} turn brown when cut or bruised. The smell {{has been reported}} as indistinct or [...] "earthy and sweet", and the taste [...] "sweet and sour". The spore-bearing undersurface is irregularly <b>folded,</b> <b>forked</b> or ridged rather than gilled and is pale buff or yellowish to whitish in color. These ridges are up to [...] high, and are decurrent—they extend below and run down the cap's attachment to the stipe, though irregularly so. The spore print is brownish, the spores ellipsoid with dimensions of 12.4–16.8 × 5.8–7.3μm. The spore surface is roughened with ornamentations {{that can be made}} visible under the microscope by staining with methyl blue.|$|R
50|$|In either arrangement, {{the napkin}} may either rest <b>folded</b> {{underneath}} the <b>forks,</b> {{or it may}} be folded and placed on the dinner plate.|$|R
50|$|In Akihabara, vending {{machines}} distribute warm ramen in a steel can, known as ramen kan (らーめん缶). It {{is produced by}} a popular ramen restaurant and contains noodles, soup, menma, and pork. It is intended as a quick snack, and includes a small <b>folded</b> plastic <b>fork.</b> There are few kinds of flavor such as tonkotsu and curry.|$|R
50|$|Fruit {{bodies of}} Turbinellus species are wrinkled, with a turbinate shape-like an {{inverted}} cone or funnel. The flesh is thick and cork-like. The hymenium (the fertile surface where spores are produced) have an irregular texture with <b>folds</b> that are <b>forked</b> and reticulate.|$|R
50|$|A hinge in {{the frame}} may allow the rear {{triangle}} and wheel to be folded down and flipped forward, under the main frame tube, as in the Bike Friday, Brompton Mezzo Folder, and Swift Folder. Such a flip hinge may be combined with a <b>folding</b> front <b>fork,</b> as in the Birdy. Swing and flip hinges may be combined on the same frame, as in the Brompton Mezzo Folder and Dahon, which use a folding steering column. Folding mechanisms typically involve latches and quick releases, which affect {{the speed of the}} fold/unfold. Bike Friday offers a model, the Tikit, featuring a cable-activated folding mechanism requiring no quick releases or latches, for increased folding speed.|$|R
50|$|Description: A gold color {{metal and}} enamel device 1 3/16 inches in height overall {{consisting}} of an oval its upper half blue and containing a gold star in center, {{the lower half}} divided into seven stripes alternately white and red. Bordering {{the bottom of the}} oval, a semicircular gold scroll inscribed with the words HAEC PROTEGIMUS in black, the scroll ends <b>folded</b> twice and <b>forked</b> with the points up below a border of gold oak leaves terminating at either side of a gold acorn with point up at top center, crossed in front two swords their gold hilts emerging from the folds of the scroll and their white blades terminating outside the oak leaf border.|$|R
5000|$|On August 4, 1864, the Brigade, and the Regiment, {{were ordered}} to join Major General William Sherman’s Army near Atlanta, Georgia, and with them they {{took part in the}} Siege of Atlanta until August 25. On the 21st of that month Colonel Grower {{received}} orders for the Regiment to join the 1st Brigade, 2nd Division, of the 14th Army Corps. During the siege of Atlanta in August 1864 Colonel Grower displayed his regular coolness in action and under fire, an example of this is given by First Sergeant William Westervelt of Company K of the Regiment who wrote: “We remained until the afternoon of the 20th, and were continually under fire. No part of our position was safe. Our Major had put up a temporary shelter in the safest point he could fin, and one morning invited our Colonel to breakfast, telling him as an inducement that he could offer him some butter, which was almost an unknown article in the army at that time. Just as they seated themselves at the table, a ten pound shot came through the roof of their quarters, and cut off one corner of the table. Major Martin did what any ordinary man would do under the circumstances - he turned a back somersault off his camp stool and hugged the ground close, thinking it was a shell and would likely explode. Not so with Col. Grower. He coolly laid down his knife and <b>fork,</b> <b>folded</b> his hands, and leaning back on his stool, with an air of offended dignity remarked, “Major Martin, that {{is a great way to}} treat a man when invited to breakfast.” ...|$|R
40|$|The North Fork terrane is an {{assemblage}} of ophiolitic and other oceanic volcanic and sedimentary rocks that has been internally imbricated and folded. The ophiolitic rocks form a north-trending belt through {{the central part of}} the region and consist of a disrupted sequence of homogeneous gabbro, diabase, massive to pillowed basalt, and interleaved tectonitic harzburgite. U-Pb zircon age data on a plagiogranite pod from the gabbroic unit indicate that at least this part of the igneous sequence is late Paleozoic in age. The ophiolitic belt is flanked on either side by mafic volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks, limestone, bedded chert, and argillite. Most of the chert is Triassic, including much of Late Triassic age, but chert with uncertain stratigraphic relations at one locality is Permian. The strata flanking the east side of the ophiolitic belt face eastward, and depositional contacts between units are for the most part preserved. The strata on the west side of the ophiolitic belt are more highly disrupted than those on the east side, contain chert-argillite melange, and have unproven stratigraphic relation to either the ophiolitic rocks or the eastern strata. Rocks of the North Fork terrane do not show widespread evidence of penetrative deformation at elevated temperatures, except an early tectonitic fabric in the harzburgite. Slip-fiber foliation in serpentinite, phacoidal foliation in chert and mafic rocks, scaly foliation in argillite, and mesoscopic folds in bedded chert are consistent with an interpretation of large-scale anti-formal folding of the terrane about a north-south hinge found along the ophiolitic belt, but other structural interpretations are tenable. The age of <b>folding</b> of North <b>Fork</b> rocks is constrained by the involvement of Triassic and younger cherts and crosscutting Late Jurassic plutons. Deformation in the North Fork terrane must have spanned a short period of time because the terrane is bounded structurally above and below by Middle or Late Jurassic thrust faults. The North Fork terrane appears to contain no arc volcanic rocks or arc-derived detritus, suggesting that it neither constituted the base for an arc nor was in a basinal setting adjacent to an arc sediment source. Details of the progressive accretion and evolutionary relationship of the North Fork to other terranes of the Klamath Mountains are not yet clear...|$|R
