5|$|Despite their {{relationship}} having declined from friendship to hatred, Bogdan-Pitești's style and his mundane interests are occasionally seen {{as sources of}} inspiration for Caragiale's only novel, Craii de Curtea-Veche (completed in 1928). Some have noted that Bogdan-Pitești has {{a lot in common}} with {{at least one of the}} three protagonists. He and his wife were both characters in Ion Vinea's novels Venin de mai ("May Venom") and Lunatecii ("The Lunatics")—Alexandru as Adam Gună, Domnica as wife Iada Gună. Both novels portray the Bogdans' cultural circle, allude to their influence in making young people reject all conventionalism, and show them promoting vice as virtue. This lifestyle <b>has</b> <b>taken</b> <b>its</b> toll on Adam Gună, who is a physical ruin and slowly loses his hold on reality. Vinea's books repeat claims that Bogdan-Pitești was abusing drugs, and that Domnica was originally a prostitute.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the unique}} {{structures}} of Igbo culture was the Nsude Pyramids, at the Nigerian town of Nsude, northern Igboland. Ten pyramidal structures were built of clay/mud. The first base section was 60ft. in circumference and 3ft. in height. The next stack was 45ft. in circumference. Circular stacks continued, till it reached the top. The structures were temples for the god Ala/Uto, who was believed to reside at the top. A stick was placed at the top to represent the god's residence. The structures were laid in groups of five parallel to each other. Because it was built of clay/mud like the Deffufa of Nubia, time <b>has</b> <b>taken</b> <b>its</b> toll requiring periodic reconstruction.|$|E
25|$|Ecclesiastes <b>has</b> <b>taken</b> <b>its</b> {{literary}} {{form from}} the Middle Eastern {{tradition of the}} fictional autobiography, in which a character, often a king, relates his experiences and draws lessons from them, often self-critical: Kohelet likewise identifies himself as a king, speaks of his search for wisdom, relates his conclusions, and recognises his limitations. It belongs to the category of wisdom literature, the body of biblical writings which give advice on life, together with reflections on its problems and meanings—other examples include the Book of Job, Proverbs, {{and some of the}} Psalms. Ecclesiastes differs from the other biblical Wisdom books in being deeply skeptical of the usefulness of Wisdom itself. Ecclesiastes in turn influenced the deuterocanonical works, Wisdom of Solomon and Sirach, both of which contain vocal rejections of the Ecclesiastical philosophy of futility.|$|E
25|$|The fort had {{a typical}} {{rectangular}} 'Playing Card' shape and had four gates, {{being surrounded by}} a ditch. Despite never having systematically excavated the site, archaeologists have found {{the remains of the}} headquarters buildings, a bathhouse and some barracks buildings through the use of geophysical survey. Remains of a nearby vicus have been found, and its traces can be seen through aerial photography. A cemetery was also discovered in the 20th century to the southwest of the fort, with examples of stone-lined burials and cremations sites. The fact that the fort is located on fields that have not been ploughed means its condition is remarkable, although stone robbing <b>has</b> <b>taken</b> <b>its</b> toll.

25|$|The city’s and municipality’s {{recent history}} has {{centered}} on violence related to drugs and the environment. Drug-related violence of {{the past several decades}} <b>has</b> <b>taken</b> <b>its</b> toll as tourism is down, fewer come to shop in the city and many residents stay indoors for fear of a stray bullet. The violence and threats of violence have left streets empty after 7 pm. Pickups and SUVs with darkened windows are a common sight. These vehicles are associated with the many shootings and even grenade attacks that have taken place in and around the city in recent years. The violence {{is not limited to the}} city of Petatlán; it also occurs in its small rural communities such as La Morena, El Camalote and Las Humedades. A number of these have been partly or fully abandoned as drug-related violence grows. The violence is among local drug lords over turf.|$|E

500|$|Other {{philosophers}} and writers identified as influences include Arthur Schopenhauer, Friedrich Nietzsche, Ray Brassier, Emil Cioran, and Eugene Thacker. Mathijs Peters, {{in a piece}} for Film International, argued that True Detective probes Schopenhauerian philosophy through its approach to individuality, self-denial, the battle between dark and light, and so forth. Ben Woodard noted the show's evolving philosophy, which examines a setting where culture, religion, and society are direct by-products of biological weakness. Woodward wrote, [...] "Biological programming gets recuperated and socially redistributed visions, faiths, and acerbic personalities take the reins of uncertain ends creating a world where 'people go away'." [...] Even the setting, Fintan Neylan argued, emphasizes a world [...] "where the decrepitude of human ordering cannot be hidden." [...] He stated, [...] "This {{is not a place}} where hope fled; {{it is a place where}} hope could never take root. It is with these people and environs that the real horror is sourced." [...] Yet Neylan observed that Cohle's actions are not motivated by misanthropy, rather a drive to challenge [...] "those who try to either disguise or manipulate this frailty of humans for their own benefit." [...] And in doing so, Cohle ultimately confronts [...] "an entire philosophical history which <b>has</b> <b>taken</b> <b>its</b> task as that of sweeping frailty away." [...] Christopher Orr at The Atlantic said True Detective was [...] "Fincherian in the best sense", a fusion of Se7en (1995) and Zodiac (2007), because of its subject matter, sleek cinematography, and [...] "vivid, unsettling" [...] aura.|$|E
