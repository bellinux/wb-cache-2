5|$|The elderly Caxias, almost 72 and widowed since 1874, was in {{poor health}} and could serve {{only as a}} figurehead {{president}} of the government formed on 25 June 1875. Cotejipe was the de facto president. The Caxias-Cotejipe cabinet attempted to dissipate the discord created by the previous cabinet. Their measures included <b>financial</b> <b>aid</b> <b>to</b> coffee farmers, an amnesty for the convicted bishops, and, to please the pro-slavery Conservatives, the selection of new ministers and a call for elections. Caxias, who was a Freemason but also a staunch Catholic, threatened to resign if the Emperor did not grant the amnesty, which PedroII grudgingly issued in September 1875.|$|E

5|$|Romanticism {{reached its}} apogee between the late 1850s {{and the early}} 1870s as it divided into several branches, {{including}} Indianism and sentimentalism. The most influential literary style in 19th-century Brazil, {{many of the most}} renowned Brazilian writers were exponents of Romanticism: Manuel de Araújo Porto Alegre, Gonçalves Dias, Gonçalves de Magalhães, José de Alencar, Bernardo Guimarães, Álvares de Azevedo, Casimiro de Abreu, Castro Alves, Joaquim Manuel de Macedo, Manuel Antônio de Almeida and Alfredo d'Escragnolle Taunay. In theater, the most famous Romanticist playwrights were Martins Pena and Joaquim Manuel de Macedo. Brazilian Romanticism did not have the same success in theater as it had in literature, as most of the plays were either Neoclassic tragedies or Romantic works from Portugal or translations from Italian, French or Spanish. After the opening of the Brazilian Dramatic Conservatory in 1845, the government gave <b>financial</b> <b>aid</b> <b>to</b> national theater companies in exchange for staging plays in Portuguese.|$|E
5|$|The outer rainbands of {{the storm}} first began {{affecting}} Guatemala and southeastern Mexico late on June 1. In Mexico, the peak 24-hour rainfall total was 4.96inches (126mm) in Huixtla, and across southeastern Mexico, the rainfall led to above normal levels in many rivers. An automatic surface station in Puerto Madero, Mexico recorded sustained winds of 36mph (58km/h) with gusts of 53mph (85km/h) shortly after landfall. In most locations, damage from the storm was minor, limited to downed light posts, some damaged roofs, and a brief power outage. However, winds and rains from the storm caused moderate to severe crop damage in the mountain range of southern Chiapas. About 35sq.miles (90km²) of banana crops were destroyed, with about 4sq.miles (10km²) of coffee damaged. The passage {{of the storm}} also resulted in damage to cocoa beans, mango, coconut, and other vegetables, with crop damage totaling about 200million pesos (2007MXN, $55million 2007USD). As {{a result of the}} crop damage, the government of Mexico provided 108million pesos (2007MXN, $10million 2007USD) in <b>financial</b> <b>aid</b> <b>to</b> the affected farmers.|$|E

5|$|With no {{counterpart}} to the south, the Kansas Turnpike ended {{at the state}} line, at an at-grade intersection with E0010 Road. Just across the state line was an oat field, into which many inattentive motorists crashed. This abrupt end became nationally famous after Wyoming governor Milward L. Simpson and his wife crashed in mid-1957. The oat farmer plowed the field to provide a safer landing, and the KTA was persuaded to install a huge wooden barrier {{at the end of}} the highway. However, within a day, three more drivers had crashed and destroyed the barrier, so the KTA closed the turnpike south of the South Haven interchange. KTA provided the state of Oklahoma with <b>financial</b> <b>aid</b> <b>to</b> construct its portion of a temporary road leading to the interchange. The lack of continuity in the highway was one of the primary reasons that the road did not generate much revenue in the years following the opening; another reason was a lack of education on the part of motorists as to the concept of a toll road.|$|E
5|$|The {{first phase}} of the Cold War began {{in the first two years}} after the end of the Second World War in 1945. The USSR {{consolidated}} its control over the states of the Eastern Bloc, while the United States began a strategy of global containment to challenge Soviet power, extending military and <b>financial</b> <b>aid</b> <b>to</b> the countries of Western Europe (for example, supporting the anti-communist side in the Greek Civil War) and creating the NATO alliance. The Berlin Blockade (1948–49) was the first major crisis of the Cold War. With the victory of the communist side in the Chinese Civil War and the outbreak of the Korean War (1950–53), the conflict expanded. The USSR and USA competed for influence in Latin America and the decolonizing states of Africa and Asia. Meanwhile, the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 was stopped by the Soviets. The expansion and escalation sparked more crises, such as the Suez Crisis (1956), the Berlin Crisis of 1961, and the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962. Following the Cuban Missile Crisis, a new phase began that saw the Sino-Soviet split complicate relations within the communist sphere, while US allies, particularly France, demonstrated greater independence of action. The USSR crushed the 1968 Prague Spring liberalization program in Czechoslovakia, and the Vietnam War (1955–75) ended with the defeat of the US-backed Republic of Vietnam, prompting further adjustments.|$|E
5|$|The Labour Party {{came into}} {{government}} {{under the leadership}} of Tony Blair in May 1997 after the electoral wipeout of the Conservative government, led by John Major; this ended 18 years of Conservative rule. Having secured a landslide victory with 418 seats in the House of Commons, the Party had a working majority of 179 seats, and {{went on to win the}} 2001 and 2005 elections. During its first term in office Blair's government introduced many popular policies, including legislation to establish a national minimum wage, reducing the length of hospital waiting lists, and devolving lawmaking powers to Scotland and Wales. Blair also played a key role in the Northern Ireland peace process. But his decision to commit British troops to the 2003 invasion of Iraq turned public opinion against him and lost him the support of some of his own MPs. When Blair stepped down as Prime Minister in June 2007 he was succeeded by his Chancellor, Gordon Brown. Blair's decade-long premiership had been a time of economic boom for the United Kingdom, but Brown's tenure as Prime Minister was dominated by the global recession of the latter part of the 2000s. Although commentators perceived Brown to have made some good decisions during the economic crisis, such as providing <b>financial</b> <b>aid</b> <b>to</b> several UK banks which found themselves in difficulty, his fiscal policy of borrowing and spending led to a dramatic increase in the country's national debt. He was also viewed by the media as someone who lacked interpersonal skills. Another major event that occurred during Brown's time in government was the 2009 scandal involving MPs expenses, which damaged the public's trust in politicians.|$|E
