5|$|Boron carbide and cubic {{boron nitride}} powders {{are widely used}} as abrasives. Boron nitride is a {{material}} isoelectronic to carbon. Similar to carbon, it has both hexagonal (soft graphite-like h-BN) and cubic (hard, diamond-like c-BN) forms. h-BN {{is used as a}} high temperature component and lubricant. c-BN, also known under commercial name borazon, is a superior abrasive. Its hardness <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>slightly</b> smaller than, but its chemical stability is superior, to that of diamond. Heterodiamond (also called BCN) is another diamond-like boron compound.|$|E

5|$|Samarium is a {{chemical}} element with symbolSm and atomic number62. It is a moderately hard silvery metal that readily oxidizes in air. Being a typical {{member of the}} lanthanide series, samarium usually assumes the oxidation state +3. Compounds of samarium(II) are also known, most notably the monoxide SmO, monochalcogenides SmS, SmSe and SmTe, as well as samarium(II) iodide. The last compound is a common reducing agent in chemical synthesis. Samarium has no significant biological role but <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>slightly</b> toxic.|$|E

The element's atomic radius is the third largest among all the lanthanides but <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>slightly</b> greater than those of the neighboring elements. It is the only exception to the general trend of the contraction of the atoms with increase of atomic radius (caused by the lanthanide contraction) that is not caused by the filled (or half-filled) 4f-subshell.|$|E
5|$|Similarly to all inner {{satellites}} of Jupiter, Thebe rotates synchronously {{with its}} orbital motion, thus keeping one face always {{looking toward the}} planet. Its orientation is such that the long axis always points to Jupiter. At the surface points closest to and furthest from Jupiter, the surface {{is thought to be}} {{near the edge of the}} Roche lobe, where Thebe's gravity <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>slightly</b> larger than the centrifugal force. As a result, the escape velocity in these two points is very small, thus allowing dust to escape easily after meteorite impacts, and ejecting it into the Thebe gossamer ring.|$|E
5|$|The {{middle toe}} is greatly elongated, and the hind one <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>slightly</b> developed, while the talons {{of all the}} toes are {{comparatively}} straight and blunt. The feet are thus more adapted to walking, and are of little use as weapons or organs of prehension as in birds of prey and Old World vultures. The beak is hooked, and adapted to tear rotting meat. The irises of the male are brown, while those of the female are deep red. The eyelids lack eyelashes. Contrary to the usual rule for sexual dimorphism among birds of prey, the female is smaller than the male.|$|E

5|$|An owl's {{eyes are}} {{placed at the}} front of the head and have a field overlap of 50–70%, giving it better {{binocular}} vision than diurnal birds of prey (overlap 30–50%). The tawny owl's retina has about 56,000 light-sensitive rod cells per square millimetre (36million per square inch); although earlier claims that it could see in the infrared part of the spectrum have been dismissed, it is still often said to have eyesight 10 to 100 times better than humans in low-light conditions. However, the experimental basis for this claim is probably inaccurate by at least a factor of 10. The owl's actual visual acuity <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>slightly</b> greater than that of humans, and any increased sensitivity is due to optical factors rather than to greater retinal sensitivity; both humans and owl have reached the limit of resolution for the retinas of terrestrial vertebrates.|$|E

5|$|Lithium {{naturally}} only {{occurs in}} traces in biological systems {{and has no}} known biological role, but does have effects on the body when ingested. Lithium carbonate {{is used as a}} mood stabiliser in psychiatry to treat bipolar disorder (manic-depression) in daily doses of about 0.5 to 2grams, although there are side-effects. Excessive ingestion of lithium causes drowsiness, slurred speech and vomiting, among other symptoms, and poisons the central nervous system, which is dangerous as the required dosage of lithium to treat bipolar disorder <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>slightly</b> lower than the toxic dosage. Its biochemistry, the way it is handled by the human body and studies using rats and goats suggest that it is an essential trace element, although the natural biological function of lithium in humans has yet to be identified.|$|E

5|$|Moons in {{retrograde}} orbits cannot form in {{the same}} region of the solar nebula as the planets they orbit, so Triton must have been captured from elsewhere. It might therefore have originated in the Kuiper belt, a ring of small icy objects extending outwards from just inside the orbit of Neptune to about 50AU from the Sun. Thought to be the point of origin {{for the majority of}} short-period comets observed from Earth, the belt is also home to several large, planet-like bodies including Pluto, which is now recognized as the largest in a population of Kuiper belt objects (the plutinos) locked in orbital step with Neptune. Triton <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>slightly</b> larger than Pluto and nearly identical in composition, which has led to the hypothesis that the two share a common origin.|$|E
5|$|The {{chemistry}} of polonium {{is similar to}} that of tellurium, although it also shows some similarities to its neighbor bismuth due to its metallic character. Polonium dissolves readily in dilute acids but <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>slightly</b> soluble in alkalis. Polonium solutions are first colored in pink by the Po2+ ions, but then rapidly become yellow because alpha radiation from polonium ionizes the solvent and converts Po2+ into Po4+. This process is accompanied by bubbling and emission of heat and light by glassware due to the absorbed alpha particles; as a result, polonium solutions are volatile and will evaporate within days unless sealed. At pH about 1, polonium ions are readily hydrolyzed and complexed by acids such as oxalic acid, citric acid, and tartaric acid.|$|E
5|$|The incisive {{foramina}} (openings in {{the front}} part of the palate) are long, sometimes extending to between the first molars (M1). The bony palate is broad and short, with the posterior margin between the third molars (M3). Nephelomys levipes is the only other oryzomyine with such a short palate, although that of Eremoryzomys polius <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>slightly</b> longer. The posterolateral palatal pits (openings in the back part of the palate near the M3) vary from small to fairly large and are located in slight fossas (depressions). In Eremoryzomys, these fossas are deeper. The roof of the mesopterygoid fossa, the opening behind the palate, is completely closed or contains small sphenopalatine vacuities. The vacuities are much larger in Eremoryzomys. The alisphenoid strut, a piece of bone that separates two foramina (openings), is present in all Drymoreomys specimens examined, except in one juvenile specimen.|$|E

5|$|Triaenops goodmani is an extinct bat from Madagascar in {{the genus}} Triaenops. It is known from three lower jaws {{collected}} in a cave at Anjohibe in 1996, and described as a new species in 2007. The material is at most 10,000 years old. A bat humerus (upper arm bone) from the same site could not be identified as either T.goodmani or the living T.menamena. T.goodmani is identifiable {{as a member of}} Triaenops or the related genus Paratriaenops by a number of features of the teeth, such as the single-cusped, canine-like fourth premolar and the presence of a gap between the entoconid and hypoconulid cusps on the first two molars. T.goodmani is larger than the living species of Triaenops and Paratriaenops on Madagascar, and on the first molar the protoconid cusp <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>slightly</b> higher than the hypoconid, not much higher as in the other species.|$|E
5|$|Triaenops goodmani {{is known}} from three mandibles (lower jaws): {{one with the}} fourth premolar (p4) and first and second molars (m1–2) and two with {{the second and third}} molars (m2–3). The jaw is {{relatively}} robust. The p4 resembles a canine, having a single cusp that is about as high as the highest cusp on m1 and lacking accessory shelves or cusps. The molars are narrow-crowned and longer than in T.menamena, P.auritus, and P.furculus. Length of m2 ranges from 1.55 to 1.57mm and width from 0.98 to 1.02mm. On m1, the trigonid (front group of cusps) is narrower and slightly higher than the talonid at the back. The protoconid, one of the main cusps in the trigonid, is the highest cusp, but <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>slightly</b> higher than the hypoconid (a cusp in the talonid); in living Madagascan Triaenops and Paratriaenops, the protoconid is substantially higher than the hypoconid. The paraconid, metaconid (both cusps in the trigonid), and entoconid (a cusp in the talonid) are lower than in Paratriaenops auritus. The hypoconulid (part of the talonid) is small but distinct and is the lowest cusp. It is separated from the entoconid by a gap. T.goodmani lacks a ridge, the preentocristid, connecting the entoconid to the metaconid. There is a crest (cingulum) at the front and back of the tooth. The last two molars are similar to m1, but in m2 the talonid <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>slightly</b> wider than the trigonid and in m3 the two are of equal width. In addition, a shelf is present between the protoconid and hypoconid on m2 and m3 is smaller, lacks the gap between the entoconid and hypoconulid, and has a weak ridge between the entoconid and metaconid. These characteristics are typical of Triaenops and Paratriaenops.|$|E
