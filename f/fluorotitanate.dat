40|$|AbstractThe {{scope of}} the {{research}} {{is the possibility of}} winning titanium metal using electrolysis in molten alkali metals at the temperature of 550 [...] 700 deg. C. The resulting powder Ti composition is determined using spectral analysis methods and mass spectrometry with inductively coupled plasma. There is proven evidence that titanium metal can be recovered from ammonium <b>fluorotitanate</b> akin to the zirconium metal process...|$|E
40|$|Two {{types of}} novel {{framework}} materials, including six organically templated silicogermanates and five hybrid fluorotitanates, have been synthesized, and their structures have been determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction. Their structures and {{the interactions between}} the organic and inorganic species are discussed in some detail. The frameworks of the six silicogermanates, SU- 9, SU- 10, SU- 11, SU- 12, SU- 14 and SU- 21, are built up from either tetrahedra exclusively, or from mixed polyhedra. SU- 9, SU- 10 and SU- 11 consist only of tetrahedra, and SU- 12, SU- 14 and SU- 21 are built up from mixed polyhedra. In all silicogermanates, Si and Ge share the tetrahedrally coordinated positions, and only Ge occupies the 5 - and 6 -coordinated positions. The frameworks of SU- 9, SU- 10 and SU- 11 belong to zeolite frameworks. SU- 9 and SU- 10 are built up from the same periodic building units (PBUs) that are formed by 4 / 4 - 4 units, and they adopt the known zeolite framework types AST and ASV, respectively. SU- 11 is built up from 5 - 1 units and adopts the known zeolite framework type MFI. This {{is the first time}} that the frameworks of AST, ASV and MFI have been prepared in silicogermanate form. The 3 -D frameworks of SU- 12 and SU- 14 contain (Ge,Si) 7 composite building units that form one-dimensional 24 -ring channels along the c axis. Their structures contain intersecting channels. SU- 12 contains 8 -, 10 - 12 - and 24 -ring channels; while SU- 14 has 9 -, 10 -, 12 - and 24 -ring channels. SU- 21 is a two-dimensional framework structure containing 10 -ring channels. It is the first silicogermanate with the template covalently bonded to Ge. All silicogermanates were synthesized by using organic amines as templates. The templates play a very important role in directing the structure of the inorganic framework. The obtained five hybrid fluorotitanates are SUF- 1, SUF- 2, SUF- 3, SUF- 4 and SUF- 5. Their hybrid frameworks are built up from <b>fluorotitanate</b> anions, N-containing cations and crystal water/oxonium cations. Zero-dimensional <b>fluorotitanate</b> clusters are normally obtained when cyclic organic amines such as 1, 4 -diazabicyclo[2, 2, 2]octane (DABCO) and piperazine are used. Increasing the pH value of the starting solutions led to more condensed <b>fluorotitanate</b> anions, from isolated octahedra to pairs and eventually chains of octahedra. The formation of the hybrid frameworks of fluorotitanates is strongly dependent on hydrogen bonds between the <b>fluorotitanate</b> anions, N-containing organic cations and water molecules/oxonium ions...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} is {{focussed}} at establishing an appropriate electrolyte system for developing electrochemically stable and fluorine (F) containing titania (F-TiO 2) films on Cp Ti by micro-arc oxidation (MAO) technique. To fabricate the F-TiO 2 films on Cp Ti, different electrolyte solutions of chosen concentrations of tri-sodium orthophosphate (TSOP, Na 3 PO 4 center dot I 2 H 2 O), potassium hydroxide (KOH) and various F-containing compounds such as ammonium fluoride (NH 4 F), potassium fluoride (KF), sodium fluoride (NaF) and potassium <b>fluorotitanate</b> (K 2 TiF 6) are employed. The structural and morphological characteristics, thickness and elemental composition of the developed films have been assessed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) techniques. The in-vitro electrochemical corrosion behavior of the films was studied under Kokubo simulated body fluid (SBF) environment by potentiodynamic polarization, long term potential measurement and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) methods. The XRD and SEM-EDS {{results show that the}} rutile content in the films vary in the range of 15 - 37 wt% and the F and P contents in the films is found to be in the range of 2 - 3 at% and 2. 9 - 4. 7 at% respectively, suggesting that the anatase to rutile phase transformation and the incorporation of F and P into the films are significantly controlled by the respective electrolyte solution. The SEM elemental mapping results show that the electrolyte borne F and P elements are incorporated and distributed uniformly in all the films. Among all the films under study, the film developed with 5 g TSOP+ 2 g KOH+ 3 g K 2 TiF 6 electrolyte system exhibits considerably improved in-vitro corrosion resistance and therefore best suited for biomedical applications.
