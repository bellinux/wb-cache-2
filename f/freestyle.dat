5|$|<b>Freestyle</b> {{skiing is}} one of the six skiing {{disciplines}} contested at the Winter Olympic Games, and one of the youngest. In 1924, the first Winter Olympics featured Nordic skiing disciplines (cross-country skiing, ski jumping, and Nordic combined), while alpine skiing was first contested in 1936. Only at the 1992 Winter Olympics, in Albertville, France, were <b>freestyle</b> skiing events first held as official medal events. Before that, <b>freestyle</b> skiing was contested at the 1988 Winter Olympics as a demonstration sport, consisting of events {{for both men and women}} in three variants: moguls, aerials and ski ballet. In Albertville, moguls was the first-ever official <b>freestyle</b> skiing medal event; aerials and ski ballet were also held but still as demonstration events. The growing popularity of aerials convinced the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to add this <b>freestyle</b> discipline to the 1994 Winter Olympics official program. Moguls and aerials have thus been contested at every Winter Games since. Ski cross inclusion in the Winter Olympics program was approved at an IOC Executive Board meeting in November 2006, and the first events were held at the 2010 Winter Olympics.|$|E
5|$|Growing up {{in eastern}} Sydney, Windle was trained by Frank Guthrie {{from the age}} of 12. Windle's first major {{swimming}} competition was the 1960 Australian Championships. Aged 15, his second-place finish in the 1650yd <b>freestyle</b> earned him a place on the team for the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome. However, the Australian coaches only took him along to gain experience and he did not compete. He won his first national title in 1961—the 1650yd freestyle—and claimed the 220–440–1650yd treble in 1962. Windle made his international debut at the 1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Perth, winning gold in the 4×220yd <b>freestyle</b> and silver and bronze in the 1650 and 440yd <b>freestyle</b> respectively. In 1963, he won four individual national titles, adding the 880yd event to the successful defence of his three titles. He won three individual titles in 1964 and proceeded to the Tokyo Olympics where he was eliminated in the heats of the 400m <b>freestyle</b> after attempting to save energy for the final. In response, Windle took an aggressive approach in the 1500m and set Olympic records in the heats and final to win gold. He added a bronze in the 4×100m <b>freestyle</b> relay.|$|E
