500|$|One {{point of}} dispute was the {{calculation}} of Malay equity. Although officially, as of 1992, the Malays controlled 18% of the economy, some dismissed this figure as misleading. It was argued that as in reality, much of this amount comprised equity held by government agencies, therefore it belonged to Malaysians as a whole. The practice of awarding public works contracts mainly to Bumiputras was argued to be stifling Malay competency by providing little incentive to improve. Many Bumiputra contractors in turn subcontracted their jobs to others, who were in some cases Chinese; [...] "Ali Baba" [...] arrangements with [...] "the Malay [...] using his privileges to acquire licences and permits denied the non-Malay, then accepting a fee to be the front-man while the non-Malay [...] ran the business," [...] were prevalent. Some suggested that the NEP [...] "might have worked, if the Malay had actually wanted to learn the ropes. But more often than not, <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> to be rich." ...|$|E

After the shoot, Abrams cut out some scenes of Kirk and Spock as children, including seeing the latter as a baby, as well as a subplot involving Nero being imprisoned by the Klingons and his escape: this explanation for his absence during Kirk's life confused many to whom Abrams screened the film. Other scenes cut out explained that the teenage Kirk stole his stepfather's antique car because he had forced him to clean it before an auction; and that the Orion he seduced at the Academy worked in the operations division.

500|$|Wilco guitarist Jay Bennett {{recorded}} the entire album with Chris Brickley, and agreed with Tweedy that O'Rourke {{would be a}} good choice to mix the album, after a failed attempt by Bennett and Brickley to mix a few of the songs at CRC and after hearing O'Rourke's [...] "audition mix". One of the conflicts, exhibited in the film , was over the ten-second transition between [...] "Ashes of American Flags" [...] and [...] "Heavy Metal Drummer". Bennett attempted to explain to Tweedy that there were several slightly different ways to approach the transition, each of which would yield slightly different results, but Tweedy explained that <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> the problem fixed, and was not concerned with understanding the different approaches. Bennett focused on the individual songs, while Tweedy focused on larger conceptual and thematic issues—a tried and true division of labor that had worked well on the four releases on which they co-wrote the material. In order to achieve the band's musical goals, Tweedy invited Jim O'Rourke into the studio to mix [...] "I Am Trying to Break Your Heart" [...] (...) , and the results impressed the band members. O'Rourke was then asked to mix the rest of the album.|$|E
