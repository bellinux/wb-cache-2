5|$|Later, {{when they}} gather to congratulate {{the bride and}} groom, the friends joke {{that they should be}} able to kiss the bride. The husband says that anybody who wants to kiss the bride has to kiss <b>him</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> first. Ching-teng grabs the groom and pushes him onto the table, kissing him like he would kiss Chia-yi. During their kiss, he remembers how he regrets their fight from years ago, and what could have {{happened}} had he apologized for being childish.|$|E
500|$|Blamey liked {{officers}} {{who spoke to}} <b>him</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> The effect was soon felt: ...|$|E
500|$|Easy Jet was euthanized in 1992 due to laminitis, {{a disease}} of the hoof. He was buried in his paddock on Walter Merrick's 14 Ranch near Sayre, Oklahoma. Merrick was unable to bring himself to see the horse before he was put down. He said, [...] "I couldn't go, I just couldn't see <b>him</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> He was too good a friend". Easy Jet was {{inducted}} into the AQHA Hall of Fame in 1993.|$|E
60|$|He {{was rather}} abrupt. Jemima Puddle-duck {{had never heard}} <b>him</b> speak <b>like</b> <b>that.</b>|$|R
60|$|Harris said I {{encouraged}} him. I didn’t encourage <b>him.</b> A dog <b>like</b> <b>that</b> don’t {{want any}} encouragement. It’s the natural, original sin that is born in him that makes <b>him</b> do things <b>like</b> <b>that.</b>|$|R
60|$|Helen {{glanced at}} him with some {{surprise}} when {{he went back to}} the fence. She had not seen <b>him</b> look <b>like</b> <b>that.</b>|$|R
60|$|The sudden {{appearance}} of Alice Faraday always affected <b>him</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b>|$|E
60|$|A YOUTH. Why {{need you}} have cheeked <b>him</b> <b>like</b> <b>that?</b> [He goes grumbling].|$|E
60|$|NORA. It's a {{shame to}} make game of <b>him</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> He's a gradle more good in him than Barney Doran.|$|E
60|$|No, {{probably}} {{it was only}} the Earl's unfortunate manner. Perhaps he suffered from some muscular weakness of the face which made <b>him</b> smile <b>like</b> <b>that.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Miss Macroyd was {{not going}} to let <b>him</b> off <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> [...] "You don't know how she came, or you don't know whether she was coming?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'd <b>like</b> to see <b>'im</b> talk <b>like</b> <b>that</b> to me, I would," [...] {{said the}} cook defiantly, but her cooking {{from that moment}} showed a marked improvement.|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{was very}} brave of you, Billy. But, seriously, Kirk, you shouldn't hug <b>him</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> Think what Aunt Lora would say!" ...|$|E
60|$|Why did {{she look}} at <b>him</b> <b>like</b> <b>that?</b> Ugly girl! How hateful ugly people were! When she was gone, he reopened {{the door of}} the waiting-room, and listened.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's all right," [...] said Veronica. [...] "I don't {{really mean}} any harm. He's a sailor, and I {{have to talk}} to <b>him</b> <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> else he don't know he's being talked to." ...|$|E
50|$|Mourdella, Mastodon, Get Damned, Dead Register, Boondak Syndicate, Palaces, Red Rocket Deluxe, Light Pupil Dilate, Magnificent Bastard, LoudPackets, Iron Whip, Night Time. Go see <b>him,</b> he <b>likes</b> <b>that.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Fleur, who {{had never}} heard <b>him</b> laugh <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> thought: 'Then it is deep! Oh! what is it?' And putting her hand through his arm she said lightly: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not much. She {{hates to}} think of my uncle. She was very much {{attached}} to him, and to have <b>him</b> disappear <b>like</b> <b>that</b> makes her shudder and feel very bad." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The dog {{is not a}} brute, as {{you mean}} it. But I should not speak of <b>him</b> <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> if I were you. He is {{sensible}} as a human being, and might resent it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was rather}} a shame," [...] said Linton to Dunstable, {{as they went}} back to their study, [...] "rushing <b>him</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> I shouldn't wonder if he's quite a good sort, when one gets to know him." ...|$|E
60|$|This last action made Dick's heart sink, figuratively speaking, to his shoes. How could {{a fellow}} hope {{to play and}} win with his girl cutting <b>him</b> <b>like</b> <b>that?</b> But then {{of a sudden he}} shut his teeth hard.|$|E
50|$|In {{the next}} number, the {{audience}} is introduced to the nobly-born and beautiful yet childlike Fleur-de-Lys, to whom Phoebus is {{engaged to be married}} ("Ces Diamants-La"); her love for <b>him</b> is <b>like</b> <b>that</b> of Juliet for Romeo.|$|R
60|$|When he {{came home}} to supper, he was silent and morose. Lillie came running to meet him; but he threw her off, saying he was tired. She was frightened; {{she had never seen}} <b>him</b> look <b>like</b> <b>that.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'Deary!' {{said the}} old woman then. 'Alice! Handsome gall Ally!' She gently shook her sleeve to arouse her attention. 'Will you let <b>him</b> go <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> when you can wring money from him? Why, it's a wickedness, my daughter.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... --In a knockingshop it was {{count of}} a tryon between two smugglers. Fellow hid behind a door, {{come up behind}} <b>him.</b> <b>Like</b> <b>that.</b> Prepare to meet your God, says he. Chuk! It went into his {{back up to the}} butt.|$|E
60|$|The {{cadence of}} that voice--its {{peculiarity}} {{seemed to come}} home to <b>him</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> of some notes of the northern birds on his return to his native clime, as an old natural thing renewed, yet not particularly noticed as natural before that renewal.|$|E
6000|$|Kit noted two {{boats that}} had {{obviously}} been damaged while the steamer hammered on the reef, {{and the white}} crust of salt on the funnel; but Mayne resumed: [...] "Say, the old man looks shaky; never seen <b>him</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> You want to get him home." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mother!" [...] {{cried the}} young woman, issuing from the hut at the moment, [...] "don't you dare to go an' tempt <b>him</b> again <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> Our hands are black enough already; don't {{you try to}} make them red, else I'll blab!" ...|$|R
60|$|The {{stream of}} words seemed to fall {{away from her}} lips. There was a touch of Jocelyn Thew's other manner--perhaps more than a touch. She {{looked at him and}} she shivered. She had seen <b>him</b> look <b>like</b> <b>that</b> once before.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ungrateful little devil!" [...] said Bickley. [...] "Here we've fed and petted {{him from}} puppyhood, {{or at least}} you have, and yet he skips off with the first stranger. I never saw <b>him</b> behave <b>like</b> <b>that</b> to any woman, except your poor wife." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{think that}} Jantje likes you, Meinheer Muller," [...] said Bessie, spitefully, [...] "and I do not wonder at {{it if you}} talk to <b>him</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> He told me the other day that he had known you for twenty years," [...] and she looked at him inquiringly.|$|E
6000|$|Lord Southminster {{raised his}} rifle again; but the Maharajah shouted aloud in an angry voice: 'Don't fire! Don't fire! You will kill the lady! You can't aim at <b>him</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> The beast is rocking {{so that no}} one can say where a shot will take effect. Down with your gun, sir, instantly!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No;--but {{the man was}} so queer. He did nothing, you know. We hardly saw him, if you remember, at Turin. All he did was to tie the shawls at Bologna. What can any man {{want with}} another man about with <b>him</b> <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> unless he is cracked either in body or mind?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Worth {{twenty pounds}} if a penny," [...] he muttered to himself. [...] "If I couldn't get ten pounds for <b>him,</b> just <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> with a thank-you-ma'am, I'm a sucker that don't know a terrier from a greyhound.--Sure, ten pounds, in any pub on Sydney beach." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'The gentleman's {{always for}} doing something,' said the other, forcing him along as he spoke. 'I <b>like</b> <b>him</b> for <b>that.</b> I do <b>like</b> <b>him</b> for that.' ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{surveyed}} {{this sentence}} {{for some time}} before going on. [...] "I wonder," [...] she said, [...] "why one writes <b>him</b> sentences <b>like</b> <b>that?</b> It'll have to go," [...] she decided, [...] "I've written too many already." [...] She went on, with {{a desperate attempt to}} be easy and colloquial: ...|$|R
