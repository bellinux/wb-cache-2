5|$|Another {{factor was}} the weather within the {{operational}} theater. The cyclical monsoon patterns {{meant that the}} weather was deplorable for flight operations eight {{months of the year}} (from late September to early May) when rain and fog tended to conceal targets. Lack of adequate all-weather and night-bombing capability made <b>it</b> <b>necessary</b> for the majority of U.S. missions to be conducted during daylight hours, thereby easing the burden on the air defense forces of North Vietnam.|$|E

5|$|Many organs, {{particularly}} those {{built in the}} early 20th century, are contained {{in one or more}} rooms called organ chambers. Because sound does not project from a chamber into the room as clearly as from a freestanding organ case, enchambered organs may sound muffled and distant. For this reason, some modern builders, {{particularly those}} building instruments specializing in polyphony rather than Romantic compositions, avoid this unless the architecture of the room makes <b>it</b> <b>necessary.</b>|$|E
5|$|The goal of {{his policy}} was to {{withdraw}} all the U.S. forces from Europe.

Although there was a {{possible}} agreement between Carteret and Walpole over ending the patent, Swift found <b>it</b> <b>necessary</b> to publish this defence of the fourth letter to ensure that Walpole would not back down from his promise of removing the patent. It has also been seen as a letter celebrating Harding's release from being tried for printing the Drapier's letters.|$|E
5|$|A third {{attempt was}} planned for September 13; bad weather delayed {{attempts}} until September 16. However, General Schuyler was {{by this time}} so ill that he thought <b>it</b> <b>necessary</b> to withdraw to Ticonderoga. He left that day, turning full command of the invasion over to Montgomery. Schuyler {{was not the only}} one falling ill; the bad weather, and the swampy, malaria-infested terrain of Île-aux-Noix was also taking a toll on the troops, as more of them became ill as well. The bad news was tempered by good; an additional 250 troops, in the form of a company of Green Mountain Boys under Seth Warner, and another company of New Hampshire men under Colonel Timothy Bedel, arrived at Île-aux-Noix.|$|E

5|$|British Expeditionary Force {{commander}} General Douglas Haig and Second Army commander General Herbert Plumer both believed <b>it</b> <b>necessary</b> {{to expel}} the Germans from the captured positions. In {{view of the}} preparations for the Somme offensive, Haig {{did not wish to}} divert more forces than were necessary. Support was limited to a number of additional artillery units and an infantry brigade from the 20th (Light) Division. It was suggested that the next counterattack be carried out with the infantry available, with a particularly large emphasis placed on artillery.|$|E

5|$|Costume {{designer}} Anthony Powell {{found it}} a challenge to create Connery's costume because the script required the character to wear the same clothes throughout. Powell thought about his own grandfather and incorporated tweed suits and fishing hats. Powell felt <b>it</b> <b>necessary</b> for Henry to wear glasses, but {{did not want to}} hide Connery's eyes, so chose rimless ones. He could not find any suitable, so he had them specially made. The Nazi costumes were genuine and were found in Eastern Europe by Powell's co-designer Joanna Johnston, to whom he gave research pictures and drawings for reference.|$|E
5|$|For Native Americans, Pontiac's War {{demonstrated}} {{the possibilities of}} pan-tribal cooperation in resisting Anglo-American colonial expansion. Although the conflict divided tribes and villages, the war also saw the first extensive multi-tribal resistance to European colonization in North America, {{and was the first}} war between Europeans and Native North Americans that did not end in complete defeat for the Native Americans. The Proclamation of 1763 ultimately did not prevent British colonists and land speculators from expanding westward, and so Native Americans found <b>it</b> <b>necessary</b> to form new resistance movements. Beginning with conferences hosted by Shawnees in 1767, in the following decades leaders such as Joseph Brant, Alexander McGillivray, Blue Jacket, and Tecumseh would attempt to forge confederacies that would revive the resistance efforts of Pontiac's War.|$|E
5|$|Gregorio Leti's Papal Nepotism, or the True Relation of the Reasons Which Impel the Popes to {{make their}} Nephews Powerful (1667) {{is one example of}} {{contemporary}} criticism of the institution of the cardinal-nephew; Leti holds the rare distinction of having all of his publications on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum ("List of Prohibited Books"). The Catholic Encyclopedia of 1913 defended the institution of the cardinal-nephew as a necessary countermeasure to the intrigue of the old Church. According to Francis A. Burkle-Young, 15th century Popes in particular found <b>it</b> <b>necessary</b> to elevate their relatives to the College of Cardinals due to their distrust of the crown-cardinals, Roman baronial families, and Italian princely families who also populated the college.|$|E

5|$|Images 4 and 5 assume an {{overhead}} stream {{that is totally}} condensed into a liquid product using water or air-cooling. However, in many cases, the tower overhead is not easily condensed totally and the reflux drum must include a vent gas outlet stream. In yet other cases, the overhead stream may also contain water vapor because either the feed stream contains some water or some steam is injected into the distillation tower (which {{is the case in}} the crude oil distillation towers in oil refineries). In those cases, if the distillate product is insoluble in water, the reflux drum may contain a condensed liquid distillate phase, a condensed water phase and a non-condensible gas phase, which makes <b>it</b> <b>necessary</b> that the reflux drum also have a water outlet stream.|$|E
5|$|In Australia, however, {{public opinion}} about the matter was divided with many Australians opposed to the issue on moral grounds, feeling that the {{situation}} was not desperate enough to require such a drastic measure, while others felt <b>it</b> <b>necessary</b> {{in order to achieve}} final victory. The Hughes Labor government decided to hold a plebiscite on the matter and on 28 October 1916 the matter was decided by a narrow margin of 51 per cent to 49 per cent, with the no vote prevailing. Despite the result, the issue split the Labor Party and the pro-conscription prime minister, Billy Hughes, ultimately left the party and joined with members of the opposition that supported conscription to form a new party, known as the Nationalist Party.|$|E
5|$|In United States v. Amedy (1826), the Court {{held that}} the federal {{criminal}} insurance fraud statute was no subjected to the same formalities as civil insurance fraud claims.

Second, {{there was no need to}} prove the existence of the insurance company (i.e., that its stock had actually been subscribed) because it was not a party.
