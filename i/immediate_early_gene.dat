2500|$|The Histone code {{hypothesis}} {{suggests the}} idea that patterns of post-translational modifications on histones, collectively, can direct specific cellular functions. Chemical modifications of histone proteins often occur on particular amino acids. This specific addition of single or multiple modifications on histone cores can be interpreted by transcription factors and complexes which leads to functional implications. This process is facilitated by enzymes such as HATs and HDACs that add or remove modifications on histones, and transcription factors that process and [...] "read" [...] the modification codes. The outcome can be activation of transcription or repression of a gene. For example, the combination of acetylation and phosphorylation have synergistic effects on the chromosomes overall structural condensation level and, hence, induces transcription activation of <b>immediate</b> <b>early</b> <b>gene.</b>|$|E

When expressed in A 431 cells, the wild type receptor {{and to a lesser}} extent the mutant receptor that associates with PLCgamma (Y 1021) was able to up-regulate c-fos, junB, and KC mRNA expression. In contrast, the receptor mutant that engages PI 3 K (Y 740 / 51) poorly stimulated c-fos mRNA expression and did not significantly stimulate expression of either JunB or KC. Receptor mutants that did not associate with either PI 3 K or PLCgamma were dramatically compromised or unable to increase expression of any of these <b>immediate</b> <b>early</b> <b>genes.</b> The differential ability of the Y 1021 and Y 740 / 51 receptors to activate c-fos correlated well with an apparent difference in their ability to engage distinct protein kinase C family members. However there did appear to be a degree of redundancy in the cytoplasmic signaling pathways initiated by PI 3 K and PLCgamma, since both the Y 1021 and Y 740 / 51 receptors were able to activate an AP- 1 -responsive element. We conclude that recruitment of signal relay enzymes to the betaPDGFR is necessary for PDGF-dependent activation of at least some <b>immediate</b> <b>early</b> <b>genes.</b> In addition, whereas the betaPDGFR activates multiple signaling enzymes capable of activating the same nuclear response (activation of c-fos), these signaling cascades do not appear to converge in the cytoplasm but arrive at the nucleus as distinguishable inputs. status: publishe...|$|R

In contrast to work with woodmice, Zambian mole-rats do not exhibit different orientation behavior when a visual cue such as the sun is present, a result that has been suggested is due to their subterranean lifestyle. Further investigation of mole-rat magnetoreception lead to the finding that exposure to magnetic fields leads to an increase in neural activity within the superior colliculus as measured by <b>immediate</b> <b>early</b> <b>gene</b> expression. The activity level of neurons within two levels of the superior colliculus, the outer sublayer of the intermediate gray layer and the deep gray layer, were elevated in a non-specific manner when exposed to various magnetic fields. However, within the inner sublayer of the intermediate gray layer (InGi) there were two or three clusters of responsive cells. The more time the mole rats were exposed to a magnetic field the greater the <b>immediate</b> <b>early</b> <b>gene</b> expression within the InGi. However, if Zambian mole-rats were placed in a field with a shielded magnetic field only a few scattered cells were active. Therefore, it has been proposed that in mammals, the superior colliculus is an important neural structure in the processing of magnetic information.|$|E

We demonstrate that SRF is not an essential factor for liver ontogenesis. However, adult mutant mice show impaired liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy, associated with a blunted up-regulation of various SRF target IEGs.

40|$|Long-term {{recognition}} memory requires protein synthesis, {{but little}} is known about the coordinate regulation of specific genes. Here, we examined expression of the plasticity-associated <b>immediate</b> <b>early</b> <b>genes</b> (Arc, Zif 268, and Narp) in the dentate gyrus following long-term object-place recognition learning in rats. RT-PCR analysis from dentate gyrus tissue collected shortly after training did not reveal learning-specific changes in Arc mRNA expression. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry were therefore used to assess possible sparse effects on gene expression. Learning about objects increased the density of granule cells expressing Arc, and to a lesser extent Narp, specifically in the dorsal blade of the dentate gyrus, while Zif 268 expression was elevated across both blades. Thus, object-place recognition triggers rapid, blade-specific upregulation of plasticity-associated <b>immediate</b> <b>early</b> <b>genes.</b> Furthermore, Western blot analysis of dentate gyrus homogenates demonstrated concomitant upregulation of three postsynaptic density proteins (Arc, PSD- 95, and ÃÅ½ÃÂ±-CaMKII) with key roles in long-term synaptic plasticity and long-term memory...|$|R

T cells from four human donors were stimulated with Con A and anti-CD 28 on board the ISS. An on-board centrifuge was used to generate a 1 g simultaneous control to isolate the effects of Î¼g from other variables of spaceflight. Microarray expression analysis after 1. 5 h of activation demonstrated that Î¼g- and 1 g-activated T cells had distinct patterns of global gene expression and identified 47 genes that were significantly, differentially down-regulated in Î¼g. Importantly, several key <b>immediate</b> <b>early</b> <b>genes</b> were inhibited in Î¼g. In particular, transactivation of Rel/NF-ÎºB, CREB, and SRF gene targets were downregulated. Expression of cREL gene targets were significantly inhibited, and transcription of cREL itself was reduced significantly in Î¼g and upon anti-CD 3 /anti-CD 28 stimulation in simulated Î¼g. Analysis of gene connectivity indicated that the TNF pathway is a major early downstream effector pathway inhibited in Î¼g and may lead to ineffective proinflammatory host defenses against infectious pathogens during spaceflight.

Although it was known that the brain's circadian clock could influence physiological outputs such as sleep and wakefulness, metabolic rate, and body temperature, Eskin suggested that the circadian clock may play another role as a regulator for memory formation. He and his lab have shown that an aplysia's ability to form long-term memory is dependent on the time of day, namely that aplysia are able to form long-term memories during the day, but are unable to at night. This was done via regulation of several factors, including neurotransmitter release, MAPK signaling, and <b>immediate</b> <b>early</b> <b>gene</b> expression.

5000|$|Motor theory: This {{hypothesis}} {{suggests that}} cerebral systems that control vocal learning in distantly related animals evolved as specializations of a pre-existing motor system inherited {{from a common}} ancestor. Thus in avian vocal learners, {{each of the three}} groups of vocal learning birds evolved cerebral vocal systems independently, but the systems were constrained by a previous genetically determined motor system inherited from the common ancestor that controls learned movement sequencing. Evidence for this hypothesis was provided by Feenders and colleagues in 2008 as they found that EGR1, an <b>immediate</b> <b>early</b> <b>gene</b> associated with increases in neuronal activity, was expressed in forebrain regions surrounding or directly adjacent to song nuclei when vocal learning birds performed non-vocal movement behaviors such as hopping and flying. In non-learners, comparable areas were activated, but without the adjacent presence of song nuclei. EGR1 expression patterns were correlated with the amount of movement, just as its expression typically correlates with the amount of singing performed in vocal birds. These finding suggest that vocal learning brain regions developed from the same cell lineages that gave rise to the motor pathway, which then formed a direct projection onto the brainstem vocal motor neurons to provide greater control.|$|E
