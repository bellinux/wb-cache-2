500|$|Popke {{noted that}} {{although}} he saw little connection between {{the music and the}} film, Moore [...] "expresses the mood of each scene brilliantly." [...] He found that watching Age 13 with Graveyard Mountain Home as the soundtrack enhanced the film: [...] "Age 13 is not necessarily an enjoyable film to watch... but viewing it with the Chroma Key soundtrack makes an odd experience even odder yet wholly compelling, with a mysterious filmstrip allure that freezes a bygone era."

Whilst interviewed by the Llanelli Star, Anderson described Charlie's responsibilities stating: [...] "Charlie is very passionate about her work. She cares about Ruby more than life itself and is responsible for her, so these are priorities over a finding a man. I don't think it's a matter of need for her but she <b>definitely</b> <b>would</b> like someone to share her life with and that romantic element is a good balance in Charlie's somewhat serious life." ...|$|E
