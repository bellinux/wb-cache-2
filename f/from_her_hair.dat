5|$|The Duke and Duchess of York (later George V and Queen Mary) visited New Zealand in 1901. At an {{official}} Māori welcome in Rotorua, a guide took a huia tail feather <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>hair</b> {{and placed it}} in the band of the Duke's hat as a token of respect. Many people in England and New Zealand wanted to emulate this royal fashion and wear huia feathers in their hats. The price of tail feathers was soon pushed to £1, making each bird worth £12, and some feathers sold for as much as £5. Female huia beaks were also set in gold as jewellery. Shooting season notices ceased listing the huia as a protected species in 1901, and a last-ditch attempt to reinforce government protection failed when the solicitor general ruled that there was no law to protect feathers.|$|E
5|$|The Secret River is a {{story of}} Magical realism, {{blending}} real life and fantasy. Young Calpurnia is an aspiring poet living in rural Central Florida during the Great Depression. Hard times have come to her people; the animals have disappeared, her father is unable to catch fish to sell, and everyone in the community is too weak from hunger to work. Calpurnia bravely leaves home with her little dog, Buggy-Horse, to find the secret river that her neighbor Mother Albirtha has told her about. She intends to catch fish for her father to sell in his shop. When she finds the river she politely asks it to allow her to catch some fish and uses her creativity, and the pink ribbons <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>hair,</b> to catch them. On her way home, an owl, a bear and a panther each challenge her, and she has to give away some of her catch to get home. She also shares some fish with Mother Albirtha and takes the rest to her father, who gives them to the starving people in return for future payment. Strengthened by the fish, people begin working again. When the crisis is past Calpurnia searches for the river again, but cannot find it, as she no longer really needs it. Still, she realizes nothing is lost to us forever, and the book ends with one of her poems, expressing this sentiment:Secret River is in my mind.|$|E

500|$|The video {{opens with}} a three-second film {{countdown}} and proceeds with shots of several empty rooms and televisions in a big mansion. Most of the scenes were shot at the Villa de Leon. Beyoncé is seen driving a car and eventually arriving at the mansion while a song is played in the background. She enters inside the building with two luggages embellished with the letter [...] "B" [...] and throws her coat on the ground while a servant is seen lighting a cigarette she had previously taken <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>hair.</b> He hands her a key and the singer is seen climbing up the stairs.

She is the CEO of the Revocs Corporation, a conglomerate that manufactures and supplies a preponderance of the world's clothing. Ragyo is also the Director of Honnouji Academy. She is a figure of great elegance and power; her appearances are typically accompanied by multicolored light which also emanates <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>hair.</b> She has merged her body with the Life Fibers, able to heal any injuries she receives and even survive being decapitated, so long as a single Life Fiber thread remains. One of her abilities is Mind Stitch which uses the Life Fibers to control humans like puppets. She eventually dons the ultimate kamui, Shinra-Kotetsu, which allows her to perform , an area attack that renders opposing Goku Uniforms and kamui powerless. After Ryuko reverses the Life Fiber takeover, Ragyo, unwilling to accept defeat on anyone's terms but her own, crushes her own heart, but not before she warns Ryuko that the other Life Fibers in the universe will come.|$|E
2500|$|The {{concept of}} {{creating}} her outfit {{out of her}} hair was intended to fit into her design as a witch, which the development team felt meant she derived power <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>hair.</b> It was designed to both be a [...] "means of adornment and protection" [...] while also giving her appear [...] "fashionable" [...] and accentuate the movement of her limbs. During this process {{it was decided that}} as she summoned creatures to attack her enemies during the game she would lose partial control of her hair and end up in more [...] "comfortable" [...] attire; Shimazaki noted this as one of the aspects of the character she loved. Kamiya in addition wanted to avoid giving her large breasts and cleavage, feeling that normal sized breasts were adequate and that being mysterious was more attractive than [...] "baring it all". The character's model was created by Kenichiro Yoshimura, who observed non-Japanese models to keep her proportions authentic, giving particular focus to her backside which, as a result, led to it being made wider and more rounded than the typically slim-hipped female characters designed by Japanese artists. While the character Jeanne came to be better liked by most of the team, Bayonetta was Shimazaki's favorite character, while Kamiya referred to her as his [...] "ideal woman".|$|E
2500|$|On September 28, 2016, on an AfterBuzz TV live stream, Scout Durwood {{said that}} MTV had a [...] "no {{appropriation}} policy" [...] that forbid <b>her</b> <b>from</b> wearing <b>her</b> <b>hair</b> in cornrows in {{an episode of}} Mary + Jane.

2500|$|Her outfit in Bayonetta 2 {{was again}} {{designed}} by Shimazaki. It was generally designed more around straight lines than curves. All her jewelry and accessories were designed around this initiative apart from her glasses. There was debate {{about where to}} show skin, {{but when it was}} decided to create a cape {{at the front of the}} outfit, the front of her outfit was closed and instead they opted to show a large area of her back. For her new look, blue became a key color as opposed to the first game, where it was red: this was because water was a key theme for the second game and Hashimoto requested blue to become the design's key color. This eventually proved difficult as, combined with the black and silver incorporated into her outfit and the game's general color palette, it did not have the sharp qualities of her former appearance. Shimazaki described trying to make her stand out in her black outfit as [...] "a nightmare". Her overall design theme was [...] "solid". The character's hairstyle underwent a major redesign. Hashimoto's main reason behind this was that [...] " [...] personality is the type that would not want to remain stagnant. She would want to change her style, taste in fashion, and her costumes. Down the line in the series, she may make further changes to her appearance." [...] The texture of her outfit was designed to appear similar to leather, despite it still being made <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>hair.</b> Her new guns, Love is Blue, were also difficult to design, as making them too large or too similar in color to other elements of Bayonetta's outfit would not have fitted her. In the end, they were made a more striking shade of blue, as well as being given some gold to match Bayonetta's chestpiece and a silver sheen. Each of the guns, Night, Jealous, Eye and Life, were given antique charms adorned with flower designs and named according to their color and the ideas they evoked to further promote and augment the new look.|$|E

60|$|Peter did {{remember}} it. Cecily neither fainted nor failed {{when it came}} her turn. She recited {{her little}} piece very well, though somewhat mechanically.

The prevailing excitement had made bright her eye and flushed her cheeks rosily--too rosily, perhaps. I heard a Carlisle woman behind me whisper that Cecily King looked consumptive, just like her Aunt Felicity; and I hated her fiercely for it.|$|R
