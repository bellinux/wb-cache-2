Wallace and other anti-vaccinationists pointed out that vaccination, which at the time was often done in a sloppy and unsanitary manner, could be dangerous.|$|E

5|$|Biogeography has a {{long history}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> {{sciences}} concerning the spatial distribution of plants and animals. Ecology and evolution provide the explanatory context for biogeographical studies. Biogeographical patterns result from ecological processes that influence range distributions, such as migration and dispersal. and from historical processes that split populations or species into different areas. The biogeographic processes that result <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> splitting of species explains much of the modern distribution of the Earth's biota. The splitting of lineages in a species is called vicariance biogeography and it is a sub-discipline of biogeography. There are also practical applications in the field of biogeography concerning ecological systems and processes. For example, the range and distribution of biodiversity and invasive species responding to climate change is a serious concern and active area of research in the context of global warming.|$|E
5|$|He {{also carried}} out studies on {{education}} and on human behavior, in a social-science tradition.

These views gained him some critics, as he was seen as a priest who had abandoned religion.|$|E

5|$|Patterns {{in nature}} are visible regularities of form found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> world. These {{patterns}} recur in different contexts and {{can sometimes be}} modelled mathematically. Natural patterns include symmetries, trees, spirals, meanders, waves, foams, tessellations, cracks and stripes. Early Greek philosophers studied pattern, with Plato, Pythagoras and Empedocles attempting to explain order in nature. The modern understanding of visible patterns developed gradually over time.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the oldest}} and most common {{objections}} to evolution dispute whether evolution can truly account for all the apparent complexity and order <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> world.

5|$|A {{fundamental}} {{influence on}} Durkheim's {{thought was the}} sociological positivism of Auguste Comte, who effectively sought to extend and apply the scientific method found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> sciences to the social sciences. According to Comte, a true social science should stress for empirical facts, as well as induce general scientific laws from the relationship among these facts. There were many points on which Durkheim agreed with the positivist thesis. First, he accepted {{that the study of}} society was to be founded on an examination of facts. Second, like Comte, he acknowledged that the only valid guide to objective knowledge was the scientific method. Third, he agreed with Comte that the social sciences could become scientific only when they were stripped of their metaphysical abstractions and philosophical speculation. At the same time, Durkheim believed that Comte was still too philosophical in his outlook.|$|E

5|$|Americium is {{produced}} mostly artificially in small quantities, for research purposes. A tonne of {{spent nuclear fuel}} contains about 100grams of various americium isotopes, mostly 241Am and 243Am. Their prolonged radioactivity is undesirable for the disposal, and therefore americium, together with other long-lived actinides, must be neutralized. The associated procedure may involve several steps, where americium is first separated and then converted by neutron bombardment in special reactors to short-lived nuclides. This procedure is well known as nuclear transmutation, {{but it is still}} being developed for americium. The transuranic elements from americium to fermium occurred naturally <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> nuclear fission reactor at Oklo, but no longer do so.|$|E

The following year two study skins arrived <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Natural</b> History Museum, London, followed soon after by another skin and a specimen in spirits. Physician Percy Lowe was then able to use the skins to describe the species. He did so, briefly, {{at a meeting of the}} British Ornithologists' Club, in 1923.|$|E
