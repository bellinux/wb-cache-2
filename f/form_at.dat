If reversing the machine is not practical, then interrupting the cut is another possible solution.|$|E

40|$|The {{chemical}} and physical differences of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) <b>formed</b> <b>at</b> select isothermal temperatures (278 K, 300 K, and 313 K) are explored {{with respect to}} density, particle volatility, particle hygroscopicity, and elemental chemical composition. A transition point in SOA density, volatility, hygroscopicity and elemental composition is observed near 290 – 292 K as SOA within an environmental chamber is heated from 278 K to 313 K, indicating {{the presence of a}} thermally labile compound. No such transition points are observed for SOA produced at 313 K or 300 K and subsequently cooled to 278 K. The SOA <b>formed</b> <b>at</b> the lowest temperatures (278 K) is more than double the SOA <b>formed</b> <b>at</b> 313 K. SOA <b>formed</b> <b>at</b> 278 K is less hydrophilic and oxygenated while more volatile and dense than SOA <b>formed</b> <b>at</b> 300 K or 313 K.
