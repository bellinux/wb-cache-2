25|$|Kemp-Welch left {{full-time}} cricket {{at the end}} of the 1932 season, {{though he}} played <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>more</b> first-class games in the years up to 1936, mostly for the MCC and for the itinerant Free Foresters. He returned to Warwickshire only twice in that period, but on one of those appearances, when he captained the side against Glamorgan in 1934, he made an unbeaten 123, his only century for the county.|$|E
25|$|Best did {{go on to}} {{represent}} West Indies <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>more</b> one-day matches, with four innings played in a 'World Series' triangular tournament in Australia in 1991–92; he failed to exceed 30 {{in any of the}} innings, played against the hosts and India. He remained popular in Barbados: grievances leading to a boycott of the Barbados Test in a series in 1991–92 included Best's non-selection, as well as perceived slights to other locals Anderson Cummins, Malcolm Marshall and Desmond Haynes. Only a few hundred spectators attended each of the five days of the match, which cost the host cricket board an estimated £100,000.|$|E
25|$|A {{right-handed}} opening batsman, Angell {{made a lot}} of runs in club cricket for the Lansdown Cricket Club in Bath, but {{his record}} in first-class cricket was less successful. He played for Somerset in matches at Bath in both 1947 and 1948, and <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>more</b> games in 1949, before joining the county club's staff in 1950. Playing mostly as the opening partner to the ebullient Harold Gimblett, Angell was a restrained, neat batsman and made 933 runs in his first full season, though his average was only 20 and he passed 50 only three times. There was a very similar record in 1951, with 975 runs, again at an average of 20. In 1952, Angell made his highest score of 90 in the match against Derbyshire at Derby. But three weeks later he was dropped from the side and, as Somerset hit the bottom of the County Championship table for what would prove to be the first of four consecutive last-place finishes, he was not re-engaged {{at the end of the}} 1952 season.|$|E

500|$|Julie Benz, who portrayed Darla, {{originally}} {{auditioned for}} the role of Buffy. However, Benz was later offered the minor role of Darla in the pilot episode. Although the character (originally an unnamed minor vampire) was supposed to die in the pilot, Whedon liked her performance so well that he named her and her character appeared <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>more</b> episodes. Benz went on to portray Darla in several episodes of Buffys spin-off television series, Angel. She later went on to say: ...|$|E
500|$|The {{rationale}} behind Asda's initial press release remains uncertain. [...] Neill Denny, commentator for thebookseller.com, opined that [...] "the whole episode has the whiff of a badly-conceived PR stunt by ill-briefed senior executives at Asda {{out of touch}} with the subtleties of the book world." [...] Ralph Baxter of Publishing News concurred: [...] "For Asda... it may be seen as mission accomplished, a high-risk strategy to maximise publicity for its Harry Potter offer rewarded with television, radio, Internet and newspaper coverage. And the association of Asda with low prices has no doubt been entrenched <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>more</b> minds." ...|$|E
500|$|Julie Benz {{initially}} {{auditioned for}} the role of Buffy Summers, but that later went to Sarah Michelle Gellar, who had previously won the part of Cordelia Chase. Benz was offered the small role of the vampire Darla in the pilot episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Her performance was so well-received that her character appeared <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>more</b> episodes. In an interview with TheTVAddict.com, Benz said of her casting: [...] "I was supposed to die in the pilot, but about halfway through the pilot Joss Whedon was like, 'We're giving you a name and we're not going to kill you.' And he did that for a while until it finally came time to kill me, and kill me, and kill me and killed [...] me." [...] She later went on to say: ...|$|E

500|$|Having {{started out}} as an able-bodied skier, Mayberry took up the {{disability}} sport. He made his national team debut in 2005, {{and went on to}} represent Australia at the 2006 Winter Paralympics the following year, when he did not medal. [...] With the aid of a prosthesis, adjustments were made to his skiing legs, and he competed in several skiing competitions during 2007, 2008 and 2009. He was selected for the Australian 2010 Winter Paralympics team at a ceremony in Canberra in November 2009. Between then and the start of the Games, he participated <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>more</b> competitions, including one where he picked up a gold medal, and participated in a national team training camp. [...] He was selected as Australia's flag bearer for the opening ceremony. [...] In competition, he earned a silver medal in the men's downhill standing event, finished 24th in the Super-G, was disqualified from the slalom, and failed to finish in the giant slalom. [...] Following the games, he retired from skiing.|$|E
500|$|... "Freddy Spaghetti" [...] {{marked the}} second {{appearances}} by Adam Scott and Rob Lowe as state auditors sent to solve Pawnee's budget problems. Lowe's Chris Traeger character is energetic, eccentric and overly cheerful, whereas Scott's Ben Wyatt is more pragmatic and realistic. Scott was always intended {{to become a}} regular cast member starting in the third season, while Lowe was originally expected to appear only <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>more</b> episodes in a guest role. However, after those episodes were filmed, Lowe later joined the show as a regular cast member. Lowe improvised many aspects of his character, including when he handed Ben a water bottle and said, [...] "You should hydrate," [...] and when he clapped after Leslie sang at the concert, [...] "If you're happy and you know it, clap your hands." [...] Additionally, the episode was the second appearance of Natalie Morales as Lucy, a Pawnee bartender and romantic interest for Tom. [...] "Freddy Spaghetti" [...] also included appearances by recurring guest stars Jama Williamson, who plays Tom Haverford's ex-wife Wendy, and Cooper Thornton, who plays the sarcastic and deadpan Dr. Harris, who tended to Andy's broken arm. Comedian and writer Brian McCann portrayed Freddy Spaghetti himself in the episode. While singing at the concert, McCann improvised {{a great deal of}} non-child-friendly dialogue that could not be used in the final episode. Among them were a song about how he pays too much alimony to his wife, and another about meeting all the children's mothers backstage after the show. Guy Stevenson, a MADtv writer and friend of Parks and Recreation cast member Retta, played the man who shouted during a municipal meeting, [...] "With the government shut down, who's going to stop Al-Qaeda?" ...|$|E
500|$|After The Gondoliers {{closed in}} 1891, Gilbert and Sullivan were estranged for a time. [...] Barrington {{appeared}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>more</b> roles at other theatres, including as Robert Plushly {{in his own}} piece, A Swarry Dansong, a duologue with music by Solomon. [...] He {{then returned to the}} Savoy to star as Punka, the Rajah of Chutneypore, in Dance, Desprez, and Solomon's The Nautch Girl. [...] In August 1891, Barrington and Jessie Bond took a leave of absence from that show to tour a series of [...] "musical duologues" [...] (written by Barrington and composed by Edward Solomon) throughout Britain, returning to the Savoy in November. In 1892, Barrington played the title role of the Reverend William Barlow, in Grundy and Solomon's The Vicar of Bray and then toured with that show. In September 1892, he created the role of Rupert Vernon in Grundy and Sullivan's Haddon Hall, making a critical splash. [...] For example, The Figaro wrote: [...] "Barrington... kept the audience in shouts of laughter the whole time [...] on the stage." [...] In 1893, he created the role of the Proctor in J. M. Barrie, Arthur Conan Doyle, and Ernest Ford's Jane Annie, which was unsuccessful at the Savoy but ran more successfully on tour. [...] Barrington, a lifelong golf enthusiast, speculated that one reason for the failure of Jane Annie in London was that the game of golf was not yet popular there. Despite the failure of the piece, Barrington was singled out for critical praise. Barrington next created the role of King Paramount I in Gilbert and Sullivan's Utopia, Limited, opening in October of that year. [...] Barrington's comedy, Bartonmere Towers, was also produced at a matinee at the Savoy in 1893, with Barrington playing Sir James Hanbury.|$|E

2500|$|By 1925 Nazimova {{could no}} longer afford to invest in more films; and {{financial}} backers withdrew their support. Left with few options, she gave up on the film industry, returning to perform on Broadway, notably starring as Natalya Petrovna in Rouben Mamoulian's 1930 New York production of Turgenev's A Month in the Country and an acclaimed performance as Mrs. Alving in Ibsen's Ghosts, which the critic Pauline Kael [...] later described as the greatest performance she had ever seen on the American stage. In the early 1940s, she appeared <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>more</b> films, playing Robert Taylor's mother in Escape (1940) and Tyrone Power's mother in Blood and Sand (1941). This late return to motion pictures fortunately preserves Nazimova and her art on sound film.|$|E
2500|$|Ned {{drove in}} his first race in 1952 at Hickory Motor Speedway (North Carolina). He drove a Sportsman (now XFinity) series Ford that he co-owned with his brother-in-law, and {{finished}} tenth. [...] This did not go over well with his father. [...] His father {{told him he could}} work on cars but not drive them. Once, his brother-in-law was sick for a race and asked Ned to fill in for him. Ned used his brother-in-law's name and came in second in that race. That worked out so smoothly that Ned drove <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>more</b> races under an assumed name, but was finally caught by his father after winning a race. His father told him {{if he was going to}} drive to at least use his own name.|$|E
2500|$|Bridge {{made his}} debut {{at the age}} of 17 in a single match in 1955 and played <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>more</b> first-team matches in 1956 before disappearing from {{first-class}} cricket for two years on National Service. He returned to Warwickshire in 1959 and after being omitted from the first team in the opening games was brought into the side before the end of May and then played regularly across the rest of the season. In June, bowling in tandem with his rival for the spinning role in the team, Geoffrey Hill, he took eight-second-innings Cambridge University wickets for 56 runs (11 for 109 in the match), and these remained the best bowling figures of his career. In the season as a whole, he took 85 wickets at an average of 22.60. [...] Wisden Cricketers' Almanack noted [...] "the increased usefulness of Bridge... whose ability to keep a length when under heavy fire rendered him a great asset on easy pitches".|$|E

VCD received a sold out record of more than 200,000 copies. From this film, she was also a nominee for [...] "Best Actress" [...] as well as taking part in singing the [...] "Best original film song" [...] in the 2001 Hong Kong Film Award.
