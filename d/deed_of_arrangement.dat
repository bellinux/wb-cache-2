50|$|A map made of Leeds in 1834 {{shows the}} area that is now Chapeltown was pasture land between Chapel Allerton and Potternewton villages and Leeds. Through the centre of this farmland, which was already {{earmarked}} at this time as a planned 'New Town of Leeds' suburb, ran the Leeds-Harrogate Turnpike Road which later became Chapeltown Road. Much of this land, called 'Squire's Pastures' was part of Earl Cowper’s estate. The Earl first sold this land for development in 1825, but planning and building was slow, and the sale was not completed until 1873. Before selling his land, the Earl also set out a <b>Deed</b> <b>of</b> <b>Arrangement</b> defining the residential character of any future building including the limitation of livestock, heavy industry and public houses in the area.|$|E

The company works with various stage artists and dancers. Its composition varies for each production. Hans Van den Broeck's main productions for the company are Almost Dark (2004), En Servicio '(2006), We were them (2009) and Messiah Run! (2012). In addition, {{there are also a}} series of other productions, including <b>Deed</b> <b>of</b> <b>Arrangement</b> (2003), Durchgang (2005) and Café Prückel (2010). One of his latest productions is The Lee Ellroy Show (Hans Van den Broeck / SOIT, 2014), inspired by the novel My Dark Places, in which the American author James Ellroy describes the emotional impact of the unsolved murder of his mother Jean. This production and other recent productions (e.g., Celestial Commute (Hans Van den Broeck / SOIT, 2015) and the open improv evenings Roseland 2013, Roseland 2014 and Roseland 2017 (all Hans Van den Broeck / SOIT) are made in co-production or in collaboration with les Brigittines - Contemporary Arts Centre for Movement, Brussels. Hans van den Broeck himself describes his work as raw, visceral, uncompromising, committed, suggestive, poetic, visual and cinematographic. His interest lies in creating both multidisciplinary {{performing arts}} and video projects. He also regularly conducts workshops, which he himself calls 'workshows' because they usually result in a public performance in a professional environment. Cooperation and exploration are central. Together they form a trilogy, consisting of Settlement, Nomads, and Homeland.|$|E
40|$|Introduction of the {{statutory}} voluntary administration (VA) process in mid 1993 represented {{a significant change}} to corporate insolvency law in Australia in providing greater opportunity for companies to attempt to resolve their financial distress. The final decision regarding the administration outcome is determined by company creditors, who can conclude the relatively short administration period by supporting a deed of company arrangement (DOCA) or have the company wound-up in a statutory liquidation. The focus {{of this paper is}} on the relationship between financial information available at the time a company enters VA and the VA outcome. In particular, we explore how financial information that indicates a company’s capacity to restructure its debt contracts and assets relates to the VA outcome. Cluster analysis is used to explore the financial profiles of companies that have three different VA outcomes, which are: liquidation, a <b>deed</b> <b>of</b> <b>arrangement</b> that provides for company reorganisation, or a <b>deed</b> <b>of</b> <b>arrangement</b> (or liquidating deed) that provides for sale of the company’s business or assets. Our analysis indicates that (1) different financial profiles at the time of entering VA are associated with different VA outcomes and, (2) a company’s ability to restructure its debt contracts and issue new financial claims against assets are critical to the VA outcome...|$|E

40|$|This article {{reviews the}} {{operation}} <b>of</b> <b>deeds</b> <b>of</b> company <b>arrangement</b> in Australia since {{the introduction of}} the corporate rescue mechanism following the Australian Law Reform Commission’s General Insolvency Inquiry in 1988. Part 5. 3 A of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) followed the Report titled, “Administration of a Company’s Affairs with a View to Executing a <b>Deed</b> <b>of</b> Company Arrangement” and operates from 23 June 1993. The <b>deed</b> <b>of</b> company <b>arrangement</b> allows for the creditors and the company debtor to come to an alternate arrangement between themselves to enable the chances of a company within the zone of insolvency a chance of survival and as an alternative to liquidation of the company. This fresh start ideal is a key underpinning feature of modern insolvency and bankruptcy law. The Australian corporate rescue provisions however have been in place for over 20 years and remain largely unaltered. Whilst this is a testament to inter alia clarity of drafting, there are signs that perhaps {{now is the time to}} review the operation <b>of</b> the <b>deed</b> <b>of</b> company <b>arrangement</b> provisions, especially in the light of court judgments regarding secured credit and <b>deeds</b> <b>of</b> company <b>arrangement</b> that appear to be at odds with the purpose and drafting of rescue provisions speciﬁcally and corporate insolvency generally. This article examines the relevant decisions around previously unanticipated circumstances in the light of the philosophy of the law relating to rescue, particularly the fresh start ideal, and questions whether it is time for a review of the provisions so that the rescue ideal is more easily aligned by stakeholders participating in <b>deeds</b> <b>of</b> company <b>arrangement...</b>|$|R
