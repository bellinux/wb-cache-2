2500|$|In America, Atlas {{gained an}} early lead in track manufacturing, and their sectional, flex, and turnout track dominates the US market. In the UK, Peco's line of flex track and [...] "Electrofrog" [...] (powered frog) and [...] "Insulfrog" [...] (<b>insulated</b> <b>frog)</b> {{turnouts}} are more common. Atlas, Bachmann, and Life-Like all manufacture inexpensive, snap-together track with integral roadbed. Kato also manufactures a full line of [...] "HO Unitrack", however {{it has not}} yet caught on as their N scale Unitrack has.|$|E
5000|$|Peco Streamline is for {{the more}} {{experienced}} modeller. The range includes {{a wider variety of}} points and crossings, at different radii. Most of these are available with 'live' (metal) or <b>insulating</b> (plastic) <b>frogs.</b> The [...] "Electrofrog" [...] points require more complex wiring, to avoid short-circuits, but are designed to give more reliable operation of locomotives. There are no other rigid track components. Plain track is supplied in 3 foot (914 mm) lengths (2 foot for Z gauge), to be cut to length as required. It is flexible (laterally), allowing the modeller to use it for straight track or any radius curve, to suit the needs of the model. The Streamline range is supplied with different types of rail, identified by code numbers indicating the height of the rail in thousands-of-an-inch. For 00/H0 track, 'Code 100' rail is the original type, and is designed for older ready-to-run models. 'Code 83' is designed to be compatible with North American track systems. 'Code 75' is designed for 'fine-scale' models, with smaller wheel flanges, to give a more-scale appearance. N gauge Streamline track comes in code 80 and code 55.|$|R
