5|$|The {{trade with}} the North German towns lasted until the 1707 Act of Union, when high salt duties {{prevented}} the German merchants from trading with Shetland.

5|$|The Phillies {{have had}} five {{compensatory}} and seven supplementary picks since {{the institution of}} the First-Year Player Draft in 1965. These additional picks are provided when a team loses a particularly valuable free agent in the prior off-season, or, more recently, if a team fails to sign a draft pick from the previous year. The Phillies have failed to sign their first-round pick twice. The first occurrence was in 1965 (Mike Adamson); however, compensatory picks were not awarded at that time. The second occurrence was in 1997, when outfielder J. D. Drew, at the advice of agent Scott Boras, refused to sign a contract worth less than $10 million. Drew sat out of affiliated baseball in 1997, playing instead <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>independent</b> St. Paul Saints of the Northern League, and re-entered the 1998 Draft the following year. The Phillies were awarded an additional pick in that draft, with which they selected outfielder Eric Valent.|$|E
