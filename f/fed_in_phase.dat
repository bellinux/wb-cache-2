40|$|The {{rates of}} growth and {{nitrogen}} efflux (total nitrogen and ammonia) of individual C. garicpinus (n: = 32. 2 g; S. U. = 4. 8 g) kept under 4 feeding regimens, following a 48 h imposed fast (phase l), were measured pcriodically. ln phase 2 (35 d), groups A, B and C wcrc fed a 49. 75 %, 45. 55 % or 41. 10 % protein diet respectively at a ration of 0. 5 % body weight (1 d- '). Group D were not <b>fed.</b> <b>In</b> <b>phase</b> 3 (25 d) al 1 groups were fed the 41. 10 % diet. In phase 1, thc ammonia efflux rates were lower {{than any of the}} values found in either phase 2 and 3. In phase 2, group A (49. 75 %) had a higher mean ammonia efflux rates than the other groups and ammonia comprised 60 - 100 % of the total nitrogen efflux in al 1 groups. Group D showcd a direct relationship betwccn ammonia efflux rate and length of fast. In phase 3, refeeding with the 41. 1 % protein diet causcd the ammonia efflux rates of groups B and D to converge within 7 days to values no different from thosc of group C, but group A maintained a significantly higher mean value until day 25. During phase 2, the growth rates in B (45. 55 %) were greatest, but, none of the among groups differences were significant. Group D fish (unfed) lost approximately 30 % of their initial weight during phase 2. Nitrogcn efflux rates, notably ammonia, showed a pattern of excretion that was directly related to the protein content of the diet, but that the source of dietary protein, dietary energy and the total available cnergy also infiuenced nitrogen metabolism. The small differences in growth found were related to between diet differences in composition. The weight loss in the unfed group of fish was probably attributable to the utilisation of lipid ancilor protein rescrves as metabolic fuels...|$|E
40|$|A 4 -week feeding {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} evaluate effects of distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS) and lactose on growth performance of nursery pigs. Ninety-six pigs (age, 23 + 2 days; initial body weight, 14. 15 + 0. 11 lb) were randomly allotted into each of 16 pens by gender, ancestry, and weight (6 pigs/pen; 4 pens/treatment). <b>In</b> <b>phase</b> 1 (weeks 1 and 2), pigs were fed 1 of the 4 treatments: A) control (no DDGS and lactose), B) 15 % DDGS, C) 20 % lactose, D) 15 % DDGS + 20 % lactose. <b>In</b> <b>phase</b> 2 (weeks 3 and 4), all pigs were fed a common diet containing 15 % DDGS and 10 % lactose. Diets were formulated to contain 1. 47 and 1. 42 % true ileal digestible Lys <b>in</b> <b>phase</b> 1 and 2, respectively. Pigs receiving DDGS <b>in</b> <b>phase</b> 1 (Treatments B and D) had greater ADG and ADFI (P = 0. 05 and 0. 004, respectively) during phase 2 compared to non-DDGS <b>fed</b> pigs <b>in</b> <b>phase</b> 1 (Treatment A and C); however, no DDGS effects were observed on ADG, ADFI, and G:F <b>in</b> <b>phase</b> 1. Pigs receiving lactose <b>in</b> <b>Phase</b> 1 (Treatments C and D) had 21 % greater ADG, 12 % greater G:F (P = 0. 01), and a trend of increased ADFI (P = 0. 07) during phase 1, but decreased ADG during phase 2 (P = 0. 09) compared to pigs that did not receive lactose <b>in</b> <b>phase</b> 1 (Treatments A and B). In conclusion, {{although there was no}} interaction between DDGS and lactose <b>in</b> any <b>phase</b> of this experiment, it appeared that lactose can be incorporated in nursery diets containing DDGS and have growth performance maintained...|$|R
40|$|We used 144 growing-finishing pigs (72 barrows and 72 gilts; {{initially}} 85 lb) {{to determine}} the effects of calcium to total phosphorus (Ca:P) ratio on growth performance. Pigs were housed in an environmentally regulated finishing building with two pigs per pen and nine pens per sex per treatment in a randomized complete block design. Pigs were blocked by initial weight and sex, and then allotted to one of four dietary treatments. The dietary treatments were corn-soybean meal-based diets <b>fed</b> <b>in</b> three <b>phases.</b> <b>In</b> each <b>phase,</b> diets consisted of a 1 : 1; 1. 25 : 1; 1. 5 : 1, and 2 : 1 Ca:P ratio. Diets were formulated to contain 0. 44 %, 0. 39 %, and 0. 34 % phosphorus from 70 to 130, 130 to 190, and 190 to 250 lb, respectively. All diets contained 0. 05 % phytase, providing 300 FTU/kg of feed. For the overall experiment, increasing Ca:P ratio decreased ADG (quadratic P< 0. 03) and ADFI (linear P< 0. 05). However, the greatest decrease in ADG and ADFI was observed when Ca:P increased from 1. 5 : 1 to 2 : 1. Feed to gain was not affected by Ca:P ratio. These results suggest that in growing-finishing diets containing 300 FTU/kg phytase, a Ca:P ratio greater then 1. 5 : 1 will decrease ADG and ADFI...|$|R
