40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} and identify threshold concepts that are the essential conceptual content <b>of</b> <b>finance</b> <b>programmes.</b> Design/methodology/approach – Conducted in three stages with finance academics and students, the study uses threshold concepts as both a theoretical framework and a research methodology. Findings – The study identifies ten threshold concepts in finance that are clearly endorsed by finance academics. However, the extent to which students are explicitly aware of the threshold concepts in finance is limited. Research limitations/implications – As well as informing further research into the design and delivery <b>of</b> <b>finance</b> <b>programmes,</b> the findings <b>of</b> the study inform the use of threshold concepts as a theoretical framework and a research methodology. The study does not explore the bounded, discursive, reconstitutive and liminal aspects of threshold concepts. Implications include the lack of recognition of more modern concepts in finance, and the need for input from industry and related disciplines. Practical implications – The threshold concepts in finance provide the starting point for finance educators in the design and delivery <b>of</b> <b>finance</b> <b>programmes.</b> In particular, the threshold concepts in finance need to be made more explicit to students. Social implications – Using the threshold concepts in finance as well as the other findings of this study to inform to finance curriculum design and delivery is likely to achieve better quality educational outcomes for finance students as well as better prepare them for professional finance roles. Originality/value – The finance curriculum is under researched and for the first time this study identifies the threshold concepts in finance to inform the design <b>of</b> <b>finance</b> <b>programmes.</b> 16 page(s...|$|R

40|$|The {{decision-making}} {{basis in}} health and medicine needs to be expanded by economic evaluations on public health programmes, to avoid that these are rejected without grounds when priorities are established. The first aim of this thesis is thus to assess the cost-effectiveness of three public health programmes, which were implemented in the Metropolitan area of Stockholm, Sweden during the period 1995 - 2004. The programmes evaluated represent different stages in the historical development <b>of</b> public health <b>programmes,</b> where the focus has shifted from healthcare sector-based to community-based that seek to create supportive environments for health. The smoking cessation program (Quit smoking, Gals; study I) was estimated to lead to societal cost-savings four times the programme costs and to health gains measured in QALYs (qualityadjusted life-years). The elderly safety promotion programme (Safe Seniors in Sundbyberg; study II) was estimated to impose zero societal costs and QALY gains. The diabetes prevention programme (SDPP; study III) might have been cost-effective in one programme area, cost-saving but without health gains in another area, and not cost-effective in the third programme area. The analyses were performed with the methodology recommended for economic evaluations of pharmaceuticals in Sweden to enable comparisons with other medical technologies. The thesis has shown that different types <b>of</b> public health <b>programme</b> can be cost-effective and that similar programmes potentially constitute {{a good way to}} use societal resources. Cost-effectiveness, however, is not a necessary condition for implementation <b>of</b> public health <b>programmes,</b> but financing is. The <b>financing</b> <b>of</b> community-based <b>programmes</b> was explored from two angles: the economic on incentives and resource allocation and the public health on whether local community participation had been achieved. Programme costs might be used as an indicator of local community participation, whereas a subsector financial analysis showed that the key local collaborator in Sweden, the municipalities, have clear financial incentives to collaborate in community-based elderly safety promotion programmes (study IV). The second aim of the thesis is to explore the appropriateness of the cost-effectiveness methodology for public health programmes, and both constraints and opportunities with the methodology were revealed. The monetary consequences <b>of</b> the <b>programmes</b> revealed opportunities to discuss the <b>financing</b> <b>of</b> community-based <b>programmes.</b> The constraints were found in the programme effects included in the cost-effectiveness analyses. Several valued outcomes from public health programmes that affect societal welfare and individual wellbeing are not reflected adequately, which lead to underestimates of the societal value of successful public health programmes. There are alternative methods for economic evaluations which might better reflect the societal value <b>of</b> public health <b>programmes,</b> currently discussed internationally and in Sweden. It remains an important task for future research to investigate whether, and which, alternative methods are more appropriate for public health programmes...|$|R

An attempt is made to identify and discuss the conditions necessary for sustaining the <b>financing</b> <b>of</b> MSME’s sub-sector while the prospects of its financial sustenance is also assessed.

40|$|Background: Integrated {{care has}} emerged {{in a variety of}} forms in industrialised {{countries}} during the past decade. It is generally assumed that these new arrangements result in increased effectiveness and quality of care, while being cost-effective or even costsaving at the same time. However, systematic evaluation, including an evaluation of the relative costs and benefits of these arrangements, has largely been lacking. Objectives: To stimulate fruitful dialogue and debate about the need for economic evaluation in integrated care, and to outline possibilities for undertaking economic appraisal studies in this relatively new field. Theory: Key concepts, including e. g. scarcity and opportunity costs, are introduced, followed by a brief overview of the most common methods used in economic evaluation <b>of</b> health care <b>programmes.</b> Then a number of issues that seem particularly relevant for economic evaluation of integrated care arrangements are addressed in more detail, illustrated with examples from the literature. Conclusion and discussion: There is a need for well-designed economic evaluation studies of integrated care arrangements, in particular in order to support decision making on the long-term <b>financing</b> <b>of</b> these <b>programmes.</b> Although relatively few studies have been done to date, the field is challenging from a methodological point of view, offering analysts a wealth of opportunities. Guidance to realise these opportunities is provided by the general principles for economic evaluation, which can be tailored to the requirements of this particular field.

40|$|Summary: A {{comparison}} of two {{images of the}} French audiovisual landscape, with an interval of twenty years between them (1972 - 92), reveals {{that the development of}} broadcasting law {{during the past two decades}} has been broadly consistent, it has promoted the constitution of a private pole along with public services henceforth freed from political control, and the replacement of a statutory approach by regulation entrusted to an independent authority disposing of the required legal and material means. This evolution did not, however, take place without prevarication. For three steps forwards there was at least one step amiss, or even backwards. Many questions remain unanswered, whether on the role of the regulatory authority, the contents and <b>financing</b> <b>of</b> public service <b>programmes,</b> the status <b>of</b> communications firms or, more generally, the responsibilities of the public authorities in this sector.
