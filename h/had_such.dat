5|$|Stefanie Rabatsch (née Isak; born 28 December 1887 – died unknown, after 1973) was an Austrian {{woman who}} was alleged by August Kubizek {{to have been an}} unrequited love of then-teenage Adolf Hitler.

5|$|A {{pioneering}} {{work of the}} fantasy genre was The King of Elfland's Daughter, a 1924 novel by Lord Dunsany. The Elves of Middle-earth {{played a central role}} in Tolkien's legendarium, notably The Silmarillion and The Lord of the Rings; this legendarium was enormously influential on subsequent fantasy writing. Tolkien's writing <b>had</b> <b>such</b> influence that in the 1960s and afterwards, elves speaking an elvish language similar to those in Tolkien's novels became staple non-human characters in high fantasy works and in fantasy role-playing games. Post-Tolkien fantasy elves (which featured not only in novels but also role-playing games such as Dungeons & Dragons) are often portrayed as being wiser and more beautiful than humans, with sharper senses and perceptions as well. They are said to be gifted in magic, mentally sharp and lovers of nature, art, and song. They are often skilled archers. A hallmark of many fantasy elves is their pointed ears.|$|E
5|$|According to Congress, {{the federal}} court for the Western District of Arkansas was to meet in four {{separate}} terms each year: in February, May, August, and November. The court <b>had</b> <b>such</b> a large caseload that the four terms ran together. Parker's court sat {{six days a week}} {{in order to ensure that}} they tried as many cases as possible each term, and often up to ten hours each day. In 1883, Congress reduced the jurisdiction of the court, reassigning parts of the Indian Territory to federal courts in Texas and Kansas; however, the increasing number of settlers moving into the Indian Territories actually increased the court's workload.|$|E

5|$|After World War II, the US Navy {{sought to}} acquire a nuclear strike capability, and the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Air, Rear Admiral Arthur W. Radford wanted them to operate from {{aircraft}} carriers. There were practical problems with this. Nuclear weapons at that time were bulky and required a large aircraft to carry them. After Operation Crossroads, Radford asked Hayward if the Navy <b>had</b> <b>such</b> an aircraft, and Hayward suggested modifying the Lockheed P2V Neptune for carrier operations using jet-assisted takeoff (JATO) rocket boosters. It was an interim solution, as it a could not carry a Fat Man, but only the smaller Little Boy bomb; {{it could only be}} operated by the large Midway class aircraft carriers, which still had to be modified for the task; and initially had no tailhook, so it was unable to land on a carrier, and a mission would have to end with it either landing at a land base or ditching at sea.|$|E
5|$|Although {{this period}} had been productive, the bad weather <b>had</b> <b>such</b> a {{detrimental}} effect on Chopin's health that Sand determined {{to leave the}} island. To avoid further customs duties, Sand sold the piano to a local French couple, the Canuts. The group traveled first to Barcelona, then to Marseilles, where they stayed {{for a few months}} while Chopin convalesced. In May 1839 they headed for the summer to Sand's estate at Nohant, where they spent most summers until 1846. In autumn they returned to Paris, where Chopin's apartment at 5 rue Tronchet was close to Sand's rented accommodation at the rue Pigalle. He frequently visited Sand in the evenings, but both retained some independence. In 1842 he and Sand moved to the Square d'Orléans, living in adjacent buildings.|$|E
5|$|As {{the power}} and {{reputation}} of Pietro II grew, the Venetian people {{began to wonder if}} he was secretly planning to establish a hereditary monarchy. Their fears were confirmed when his son, Otto Orseolo (named after Otto III), assumed the title of Doge upon Pietro II's death in 1009, thereby becoming the youngest Doge in Venetian history at the age of 16. Scandal marked much of Otto's reign as he showed a clear inclination toward nepotism by elevating several relatives to positions of power. In 1026, he was deposed by his enemies and exiled to Constantinople, but his successor, Pietro Barbolano, <b>had</b> <b>such</b> difficulty in attempting to unite the city that it seemed infighting would once again seize Venice.|$|E

5|$|Diplodocus had an {{extremely}} long tail, composed of about 80 caudal vertebrae, which are {{almost double the}} number some of the earlier sauropods had in their tails (such as Shunosaurus with 43), and far more than contemporaneous macronarians <b>had</b> (<b>such</b> as Camarasaurus with 53). Some speculation exists {{as to whether it}} may have had a defensive or noisemaking (by cracking it like a coachwhip) function. The tail may have served as a counterbalance for the neck. The middle part of the tail had 'double beams' (oddly shaped chevron bones on the underside, which gave Diplodocus its name). They may have provided support for the vertebrae, or perhaps prevented the blood vessels from being crushed if the animal's heavy tail pressed against the ground. These 'double beams' are also seen in some related dinosaurs.|$|E

Robert and his clerks were permitted to enjoy the profits from the fees of their office. Burnell was also responsible for the decision to force the Court of Chancery to settle in London, rather than following the king and his court around the country. A Chancery memorandum of 1280 records that the chancellor, {{along with the other}} ministers, now had the duty of sorting the many petitions that came into the government and only passing on the most urgent to the king.|$|E

The 29th Infantry Division lost 3,887 killed in action, 15,541 wounded in action, 347 missing in action, 845 prisoners of war, in addition to 8,665 non-combat casualties, during 242 days of combat. This amounted to over 200 percent of the division's normal strength. The division, in turn, took 38,912 German prisoners of war.|$|E

As Matt Rutherford (Dijon Talton) is absent, Will {{is forced to}} take his place and sing with Rachel (Lea Michele), who develops a crush on him. Will is dismayed, remembering Suzy Pepper (Sarah Drew), the last student who <b>had</b> <b>such</b> strong feelings for him. When her feelings were not reciprocated, she was so distraught she ate an extremely hot pepper from Mexico, was hospitalized, and had to have an esophagus transplant. Rachel visits Will's apartment, where his wife Terri (Jessalyn Gilsig) puts her to work cooking and cleaning. After an encounter with Suzy Pepper, during which Suzy explains {{that the two of them}} are similar and that chasing after Will won't repair Rachel's self-esteem, Rachel realizes her feelings for Will reflect her concerns about her own self-worth, and apologizes for her behavior. Afterward, Will assures her that she will find the man of her dreams who loves her for who she is.|$|E
5|$|Historically, Skye was {{overwhelmingly}} Gaelic-speaking, {{but this}} changed between 1921 and 2001. In both the 1901 and 1921 censuses, all Skye parishes {{were more than}} 75 per cent Gaelic-speaking. By 1971, only Kilmuir parish had more than three quarters Gaelic speakers {{while the rest of}} Skye ranged between 50 and 74 per cent. At that time, Kilmuir was the only area outside the Western Isles that <b>had</b> <b>such</b> a high proportion of Gaelic speakers. In the 2001 census Kilmuir had just under half Gaelic speakers, and overall, Skye had 31 per cent, distributed unevenly. The strongest Gaelic areas were in the north and south-west of the island, including Staffin at 61 per cent. The weakest areas were in the west and east (e.g. Luib 23 per cent and Kylerhea 19 per cent). Other areas on Skye ranged between 48 per cent and 25 per cent.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, Savenko {{stated that}} the passed law on the state expert {{activity}} {{and the introduction of}} the profession of forensic expert psychiatrist actually destroyed adversary-based examinations and that the Serbsky Center turned into the complete monopolist of forensic examination, which it had never been under Soviet rule. Formerly, the court could include any psychiatrist in a commission of experts, but now the court only chooses an expert institution. The expert has the right to participate only in commissions that he is included in by the head of his expert institution, and can receive the certificate of qualification as an expert only after having worked in a state expert institution for three years.

5|$|In Southeast Asia and Indonesia, male {{long hair}} was valued in until the seventeenth century, when the area adopted outside {{influences}} including Islam and Christianity.

They were also confused at the short hairstyles among women in certain areas, such as Thailand, and struggled to explain why women in the area <b>had</b> <b>such</b> short hair.

5|$|Kessiakoff {{moved into}} his highest overall {{position}} after stage 12, occupying third overall just nine seconds behind the race leader. Kessiakoff at last cracked on stage 14, finishing 21st two minutes off the pace on La Farrapona. He <b>had</b> <b>such</b> time in {{hand over the}} bulk of the field, however, that he slipped only to sixth overall. Kessiakoff badly cracked in the next stage, losing almost 22 minutes and falling to 26th overall. Kiserlovski then became the team's top overall rider. He took ninth on stage 18 into Noja, part of a breakaway that took over seven minutes against the race's top riders. The result installed him into 16th place overall. He ended the Vuelta in 18th, as Astana's best-placed rider. Kessiakoff's final position was 34th, and Kashechkin was 89th.|$|E
5|$|Lillehammer {{received}} its first indoor ice rink in 1988, {{with the opening}} of Kristins Hall.

Håkons Hall is named for Haakon Haakonarson, a medieval king of Norway who as a child was transported across by mountains by skiers. Kristin and Håkon became the mascots for the Olympics, and the twin arenas at Stampesletta were named accordingly.
