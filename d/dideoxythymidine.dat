The insert is created by PCR using Taq DNA polymerase, a polymerase that lacks 3' to 5' proofreading activity and with a high probability adds a single, 3'-adenine overhang to each end of the PCR product. It is best if the PCR primers have guanines at the 5' end as this maximizes probability of Taq DNA polymerase adding the terminal adenosine overhang.

40|$|Abstract. Full‐grown blastocysts were cultured for 707 – 92 h in Dulbecco's {{modified}} Eagle's medium {{supplemented with}} fetal calf serum. They {{were treated with}} (1) aphidicolin, a specific inhibitor of eucaryotic DNA polymerase α, (2) <b>dideoxythymidine</b> (d 2 Thd), the precursor of <b>dideoxythymidine</b> triphosphate (d 2 TTP), a specific inhibitor of DNA polymerase β and (3) d 2 TTP itself. Cytophotometric measurements of both the DNA content and the nuclear areas were performed. The results show firstly that trophectoderm differentiation into primary giant trophoblast cells is already irreversibly programmed at the blastocyst stage and {{does not depend on}} any DNA replication cycle from that stage onwards. Secondly, the typical enlargement of the trophoblastic nuclei, which occurs at the peri‐implantation period, is not related to a proportional increase in DNA content. Thirdly, the onset and progress of DNA endoreduplication in trophoblastic cells is carried out by DNA polymerase α during the first part of gestation instead of DNA polymerase β, as has previously been shown to be the case for mid‐gestation rat trophoblast cells.

40|$|Using 'caged' DNA break {{trapping}} agents {{as well as}} {{the equivalent}} uncaged reagents and an automated apparatus, we have measured time courses of incorporation of radiolabelled nucleotides into HL 60 cellular DNA in the early stages after 248 UV laser damage. These time courses show two distinctive phases, one between 0 and 120 seconds and another after 120 secs following damage. The first phase consists of a transient which shows a rapid initial incorporation of radiolabel followed by a sharp fall in incorporated label. This occurs with TTP as well as ddATP, which suggests that an excision activity which results in removal of recently incorporated bases is not solely provoked by the incorporation of an unnatural base, but also by the incorporation of an incorrectly paired base in a phase of what may be low fidelity repair. The second phase consists of a more steady state of incorporation. Both phases are dose dependent and show higher incorporation at higher doses. The transient is most apparent at does which cause some lethality. It may represent a form of emergency or 'panic' repair where it seems that there may be an immediate effort to maintain strand continuity in the damaged DNA. Results of experiments with polymerase inhibitors suggest that a polymerase which is sensitive to aphidicholin and which shows some sensitivity to <b>dideoxythymidine</b> is active during the transient phase of repair. Since excision of newly incorporated radiolabel takes place very rapidly during the first phase this would imply that a polymerase with an associated proof-reading nuclease is active at this stage. Polymerases alpha, delta, and epsilon all have this property but delta and epsilon have a higher sensitivity to <b>dideoxythymidine</b> than does alpha. Since the transient burst phase shows significant inhibition by <b>dideoxythymidine,</b> {{it is more likely that}} delta or epsilon are active at this stage.

Relative to transfection with unmodified plasmid, a reduced transformation efficiency was observed using alkylation-damaged plasmid, N-methyl-N-nitrosourea causing the greatest inhibition. Treatment of recipient cells with arabinosyl cytosine or <b>dideoxythymidine</b> during the expression period following transfection by the ‘damaged’ plasmid reduced transformation efficiency, suggesting that DNA repair 4 – 6 h post-transfection was required for gene expression...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA multienzyme complex {{consisting}} of DNA polymerase and several DNA precursor-synthesizing enzymes was solubilized by gentle lysis of cultured human cells. This complex channelled the distal precursor [3 H]dTMP into DNA. The patterns of inhibition {{of the complex}} by aphidicolin and <b>dideoxythymidine</b> triphopshate (ddTTP) suggested that the complex contained the replicative DNA polymerase, polymerase α. Inhibition by ddTTP was competitive with dTTP. This was exploited to estimate the effective concentration of [3 H]dTTP {{at the site of}} DNA synthesis during channelling of [3 H]dTMP into DNA.

The enzymes of both viruses exhibited optimal activities in the same range of pH, ionic strength, and MgCl 2 concentration. Like human hepatitis B virus DNA polymerase, the woodchuck hepatitis virus DNA polymerase was strongly inhibited by phosphonoformic acid but not by phosphonoacetic acid and aphidicolin. Similar inhibition patterns for both enzymes were observed with arabinofuranosyl nucleotides (9 -beta-D-arabinofuranosyladenine- 5 '-triphosphate, 1 -beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine- 5 '-triphosphate, 1 -beta-D-arabinofuranosylthymine- 5 '-triphosphate) and <b>dideoxythymidine</b> triphosphate, whereas no effect was obtained with corresponding nucleosides.

40|$|Nuclei {{isolated}} from suspension cultures of soybean cells {{are able to}} replicate DNA in vitro for short periods of time. The reaction is not blocked by <b>dideoxythymidine</b> triphosphate, suggesting that DNA polymerase alpha is involved. Reassociation kinetics, restriction analysis, and isopycnic centrifugation of the DNA synthesized in vitro show that repeated sequences are preferentially replicated in isolated nuclei. However, some repeated sequences are not replicated in vitro, including those coding for ribosomal RNA. The addition of cytoplasmic or yeast extracts clearly stimulates DNA replication in vitro but does not improve the ability of nuclei to replicate single copy DNA. Incubation of cells with cytokinins prior to the isolation of nuclei modifies the pattern of replication of repeated sequences in vitro. These experiments suggest that the replication of single copy and repeated nuclear sequences have different requirements and may be controlled {{in a different way}} in plant cells...|$|E
40|$|A DNA {{polymerase}} from cauliflower (Brassica oleracea var. botrytis) inflorescence {{has been}} purified to near homogeneity through five successive column chromatographies, and temporally designated cauliflower polymerase 1. Cauliflower polymerase 1 is a monopolypeptide with a molecular mass of 100 kDa. The enzyme efficiently uses synthetic DNA homopolymers and moderately activated DNA and a synthetic RNA homopolymer as template-primers. The enzyme is strongly sensitive to <b>dideoxythymidine</b> triphosphate and N-ethylmaleimide, {{but it is}} insensitive to aphidicolin. It was stimulated with 250 mM KCl. Its mode of DNA synthesis is high-processive with or without proliferating-cell nuclear antigen. A 3 ' [...] > 5 ' exonuclease activity is associated with cauliflower polymerase 1.

40|$|An {{oligonucleotide}} primer {{is necessary}} to initiate polymerization of nucleotides by the DNA polymerase of avian myeloblastosis virus. The role of the primer was investigated by synthesizing the acid-soluble oligonucleotide [5 '-^(32) P](dT) _(10). Conversion of this primer to an acid-insoluble form by the DNA polymerase {{in the presence of}} poly(A) indicated that the primer was physically incorporated into the product. The phosphate residue at the 5 '-terminus of the primer remained sensitive to alkaline phosphatase, and synthesis therefore appeared to proceed by addition of mononucleotides at the 3 '-OH of the primer. Inhibition of DNA polymerase activity by <b>dideoxythymidine</b> triphosphate was observed using templates containing AMP or when the enzyme was copying the viral RNA found in the virion. Copying of poly(C) by the DNA polymerase was not sensitive to the analogue. These results corroborate the conclusion that the polymerase adds nucleotides to the 3 '-OH of a primer and further indicate that copying of the endogenous viral RNA involves only polymerization on 3 '-OH groups...|$|E
40|$|An {{adenovirus}} (Ad) DNA replication complex {{extracted from}} infected HeLa nuclei could be purified {{free of the}} bulk of intracellular DNA polymerase activity by sedimetation in neutral sucrose gradients. However, the replication complex still retained some alpha and gamma DNA-polymerase activity. Since this complex is inhibited by 2 ', 3 ' dideoxythymidine- 5 '-triphosphate (ddTTP), an inhibitor of DNA polymerase gamma, a functional role for this enzyme in Ad DNA replication is suggested. Similar inhibition by ddTTP in intact Ad infected nuclei and comparable inhibition of Ad DNA synthesis in whole cells by <b>dideoxythymidine</b> (ddThy) are consistent with a role for DNA polymerase gamma. Uninfected HeLa nuclei or whole cells are not similarly inhibited by ddTTP or DDThy respectively. Such data does not rule out an additional functional role for other DNA polymerases, and recent experiments from this laboratory (1) suggest that DNA polymerase alpha is also involved in Ad DNA synthesis...|$|E

Among the chemicals tested, 3 '-dA (3 '-deoxyadenosine) and ara-A (9 -beta-D-arabinofuranosyladenine) were most potent inhibitors of PLDR at their slightly toxic doses. N 6 -butyryl- 3 '-dA and 3 '-dG (3 '-deoxyguanosine) were the most effective in suppressing PLDR at non-toxic doses. A specific inhibitor of DNA polymerase beta, 2 ', 3 '-ddT (<b>dideoxythymidine)</b> was intermediately effective. However, possibly due to the lower intracellular incorporation or phosphorylation, 3 '-deoxy-pyrimidine analogues and formycin B were less or non-effective. The enhancement of antitumor effect of cyclophosphamide by ara-A and 3 '-dG was observed in SCC VII tumors in vivo. The involvement of DSB (or chromosome aberration) and SSB as well as base damage or crosslinks in PLD is suggested, since recently they have been shown not to be rejoined when treated with various agents such as hyperthermia and ara-A...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} group II introns from {{eukaryotic}} organelles and prokaryotes contain open reading frames for polypeptides with homology to retroviral reverse transcriptases (RTs). We {{have used the}} yeast transposon (Ty) system to express ORFs for RTs from eukaryotic organelles. This includes the mitochondrial coxI intron i 1 from the fungus Podospora anserina, the plastid petD intron from the alga Scenedesmus obliquus and the mitochondrial RTL gene from the alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. The ORFs were fused with the TYA ORF from the yeast retrotransposon Ty to produce virus-like particles in the recipient strains with detectable amounts of the RT-like polypeptides. Analysis of the heterologous gene products revealed biochemical evidence that the P. anserina intron encodes an RNA-directed DNA polymerase with properties typically found for RTs of viral or retrotransposable origin. In vitro assays showed that the intron encoded RT is sensitive to RT inhibitors such as N-ethylmaleimide and <b>dideoxythymidine</b> triphosphate but is insensitive against the DNA polymerase inhibitor aphidicolin. The direct biochemical evidence provided here supports the idea that intron encoded RTs are involved in intron transposition events...|$|E
40|$|Bacteriophage T 7 DNA {{polymerase}} efficiently incorporates dideoxynucleotides into DNA, {{resulting in}} chain termination. <b>Dideoxythymidine</b> (ddT) {{present in the}} medium at levels not toxic to Escherichia coli inhibits phage T 7. We isolated 95 T 7 phage mutants that were resistant to ddT. All contained a mutation in T 7 gene 1. 7, a nonessential gene of unknown function. When gene 1. 7 was expressed from a plasmid, T 7 phage resistant to ddT still arose; analysis of 36 of these mutants revealed that all had a single mutation in gene 5, which encodes T 7 DNA polymerase. This mutation changes tyrosine- 526 to phenylalanine, which is known to increase dramatically the ability of T 7 DNA polymerase to discriminate against dideoxynucleotides. DNA synthesis in cells infected with wild-type T 7 phage was inhibited by ddT, suggesting that it resulted in chain termination of DNA synthesis {{in the presence of}} gene 1. 7 protein.

Replicative intermediates were isolated from reaction mixtures that contained <b>dideoxythymidine</b> triphosphate, thus limiting the average extent of in vitro synthesis. Analysis of HinfI-cleaved intermediates demonstrated that the origin of replication is included within a 443 -bp fragment. Replication proceeds unidirectionally {{in the same direction as}} transcription of plasmid mRNAs. Isolation of deletion derivatives allowed us to define the replication origin of pLS 1 within a region of 284 bp. Replication of pLS 1 occurs through single-stranded intermediates by a rolling circle mechanism. Cleavage of supercoiled plasmid DNAs with endonuclease S 1 followed by restriction mapping, allowed the positioning of three major specific S 1 sites in regions of high potential to form secondary structures. One of these inverted repeats is located in the region where the origin of replication of pLS 1 has been defined...|$|E
40|$|Nuclei {{isolated}} from {{herpes simplex virus}} (HSV) type 2 -infected KB cells were examined for their capacity {{to serve as an}} in situ source of herpes DNA polymerase. In contrast to purified enzymes with added template, approx. 80 % of the DNA synthesized in isolated nuclei was viral. The average size of DNA fragments labeled in vitro was 3. 2 [middle dot] 106 Da. Based on an increase in DNA density when nuclei were incubated in the presence of BrdUTP rather than dTTP, 16 % of the nucleotides were added during the in vitro reaction. Sucrose gradient analysis of DNA polymerase activity in extracts of isolated nuclei demonstrated the nearly exclusive presence of herpes DNA polymerase. Km concentrations for the four dNTPs were from 0. 14 to 0. 55 [mu]M. DNA synthesis was inhibited competitively by the 5 '-triphosphates of ara-A and ara-C (Ki = 0. 03 and 0. 22 [mu]M, respectively) but not by the 5 '-triphosphate of <b>dideoxythymidine.</b> aATP also served as a substrate (Km = 0. 014 [mu]M) for the reaction.

40|$|Porcine liver DNA {{polymerase}} gamma {{has been}} demonstrated to preferentially incorporate dTMP over dUMP during in vitro DNA synthesis. When polymerase activity was measured in standard reactions containing saturating levels of either dTTP or dUTP, the polymerization rate was slightly faster in the reaction containing dTTP. However, under conditions where both dTTP and dUTP competed, at an equal molar concentration, approximately 3 -times more thymine residues were incorporated than uracil residues into DNA. Similarly, preferential incorporation of dTMP was observed on several substrates including poly (dA). oligo p(dT), poly (rA). oligo p(dT) and poly (dA-dT). The discrimination against dUMP incorporation was even more apparent with reduced levels of dUTP. These observations {{were consistent with the}} finding that the Km for DNA polymerase gamma was about 3 -fold lower for dTTP (0. 4 microM) than for dUTP (1. 1 microM). On the other hand, the Vmax for these two reactions was very similar. Discrimination against dUMP incorporation was also observed during inhibition of polymerase gamma by dideoxyribonucleoside triphosphates. <b>Dideoxythymidine</b> triphosphate preferentially inhibited dUMP incorporation compared to that of dTMP, whereas ddATP, ddCTP and ddGTP inhibited both reactions equally...|$|E

The purified enzyme {{consists of a}} single 120 -kDa polypeptide, which contains polymerase and 3 ' [...] > 5 ' exonuclease activities. Exonuclease activity is inhibited by deoxynucleoside triphosphates, suggesting that the polymerase and exonuclease activities are coupled. The polymerase is more active with poly(dA-dT) than with activated DNA or poly(dA) /oligo(dT) as template. It shows a low degree of processivity with poly(dA) /oligo(dT). The polymerase is sensitive to aphidicolin and carbonyldiphosphonate but resistant to N 2 -[p-(n-butyl) phenyl]- 2 -deoxyguanosine triphosphate, 2 -[p-(n-butyl) anilino]- 2 -deoxyadenosine triphosphate, and <b>dideoxythymidine</b> triphosphate. The 120 -kDa polypeptide can be distinguished from the large subunit of Drosophila DNA polymerase alpha {{on the basis of}} the peptides generated by partial cleavage with N-chlorosuccinimide and by its failure to react with a monoclonal antibody directed against the large subunit of DNA polymerase alpha. The DNA polymerase is inhibited by 200 mM NaCl and is unable to use poly(rA) /oligo(dT) as a template, thus differentiating it from DNA polymerase gamma. On the basis of these properties, we propose that the DNA polymerase that we have purified from 0 - to 2 -hr Drosophila melanogaster embryos is DNA polymerase delta...|$|E
40|$|Soluble {{extracts}} prepared from monkey cells (COS- 1 or BSC- 40) {{infected with}} simian virus 40 (SV 40) catalyze the efficient replication of exogenously added plasmid DNA molecules containing the cloned SV 40 origin of replication. Extracts prepared from uninfected monkey cells also support origin-dependent replication in vitro {{but only in}} the presence of added SV 40 large tumor (T) antigen. Very little DNA synthesis is observed when the cloned viral origin contains a 4 -base-pair deletion mutation known to abolish SV 40 DNA replication in vivo or when the parental plasmid vector lacking SV 40 sequences is employed as template. The in vitro replication reaction proceeds via branched intermediates (theta structures) that resemble in vivo replication intermediates. Replication is sensitive to aphidicolin but relatively resistant to <b>dideoxythymidine</b> triphosphate. The product of the reaction consists of covalently closed circular DNA molecules that contain full-length daughter strands hydrogen bonded to the parental template. These observations support the conclusion that replication in the in vitro system closely resembles SV 40 DNA replication in vivo.

40|$|We {{report a}} {{modification}} to the peak-height encoded DNA sequencing technique of Tabor and Richardson. As {{in the original}} protocol, the sequencing reaction uses modified T 7 polymerase with manganese rather than magnesium to produce very uniform incorporation of each dideoxynucleoside. To improve sequencing accuracy, two fluorescently labeled primers are employed in separate sequencing reactions. As an example, one sequencing reaction uses a FAM-labeled primer with dideoxyadenosine triphosphate and dideoxycytosine triphosphate; the concentrations of ddATP and ddCTP are adjusted to produce a 2 : 1 variation in the relative intensity of fragments. The second sequencing reaction uses a TAMRA labeled primer with <b>dideoxythymidine</b> triphosphate and dideoxyguanidine triphosphate; the concentrations of ddTTP and ddGTP are adjusted to produce a 2 : 1 variation in relative intensity of fragments. The pooled reaction products are separated by capillary gel electrophoresis and identified by one of three different detector systems. Use of a 2 : 1 peak height ratio typically produces a sequencing accuracy of 97. 5 % for the first 350 bases; a 3 : 1 peak height ratio improves accuracy to 99. 5 % for the first 400 bases. For these experiments, capillary electrophoresis is performed at an electric field of 200 V/cm; {{two to three hours}} are required to separate sequencing fragments up to 400 nucleotides in length...|$|E
40|$|Inhibition of {{visna virus}} {{replication}} in vitro by several compounds previously reported to inhibit replication of {{human immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV) was examined. Ribavirin concentrations as high as 1 mM reduced virus production by less than 50 % relative to controls. The concentration of phosphonoformate reducing virus replication by 50 % was 80 microM. 2 ', 3 '-Dideoxynucleosides were potent inhibitors of visna virus replication. The 50 % inhibitory concentrations for dideoxyguanosine, dideoxyadenosine, and dideoxycytidine were 0. 1, 0. 2, and 0. 3 microM, respectively. In contrast, weak inhibition was produced by 100 microM <b>dideoxythymidine.</b> These {{results are consistent with}} the reported susceptibility of HIV replication to inhibition by these compounds in vitro. The interaction of visna virus reverse transcriptase with several inhibitors was also examined. Reverse transcriptase was inhibited by phosphonoformate, ribavirin 5 '-triphosphate, ddATP, ddCTP, ddGTP, and ddTTP. The last four compounds inhibited incorporation of homologous 2 '-deoxynucleoside 5 '-triphosphates into polynucleotides by a competitive mechanism. In view of the biological similarities between visna virus and HIV and the similar in vitro susceptibility of visna virus replication to known inhibitors of HIV, visna virus may provide a good model for studying the inhibition of HIV replication in vitro. Because visna virus is not pathogenic to humans, this model may facilitate the identification of compounds for further investigation into the treatment of HIV-induced disease...|$|E
40|$|DNA repair {{synthesis}} can be specifically {{measured in}} osmotically opened, confluent cultured human fibroblasts after exposure to DNA damaging agents such that both induction and mediation of DNA repair synthesis {{can take place}} in this cell-free system. Alternatively, by utilizing osmotically shocked, log phase cells and altering the DNA precursors, pH and ionic strength, replicative DNA synthesis can be specifically monitored. Autoradiographic studies show that {{virtually all of the}} nuclei from the lysates of the confluent, UV-iradiated cells are lightly labeled in the fashion characteristic of DNA repair. By contrast, only a fraction of nuclei is labeled in a population of unperturbed, opened log phase cells and the labeling is heavy and characteristic of replicative synthesis. Furthermore, equilibrium density gradient sedimentation shows that DNA synthesis in lysates of log-phase cells is semiconservative, whereas that with UV-irradiated cells is repair synthesis. This open cell system has been used to study the enzymology of DNA repair. Thus, <b>dideoxythymidine</b> triphosphate, a specific inhibitor of DNA polymerases beta and gamma, does not inhibit either replicative or repair synthesis. By contrast, aphidicolin, a specific inhibitor of DNA polymerase alpha, inhibits DNA repair and replicative synthesis in both intact and permeabilized cells.

40|$|DNA {{replication}} fidelity {{has been}} assayed {{by using a}} modified DNA sequencing reaction. In one experimental approach, dideoxycytidine 5 '-triphosphate (ddCTP) {{was used as a}} chain terminator during replication of M 13 phage DNA by the large fragment of DNA polymerase I. The deoxyribonucleotide analogue BrdUTP was used to compete against ddCTP-induced chain terminations as an assay for B X G base mispairing (B represents bromodeoxyuridine when the analogue is present as a base pair or base mispair). By comparing BrdUTP to dCTP for competition against ddCTP, an average misincorporation frequency for BrdUMP of 0. 2 % was found. A similar average misincorporation frequency has been measured previously for the incorporation of radioactively labeled BrdUMP and dCMP into the synthetic template-primer poly-[d(G,T) ] X oligo(dA). The advantage of the sequencing method is that an error frequency is determined for each template guanine in a defined DNA sequence, thus providing information on the effect of neighboring base sequences on fidelity. Misincorporation frequencies varied no more than 5 -fold among 50 template guanines tested. The approach used here is not limited for use with nucleotide analogues but is generally applicable in determining misincorporation frequencies and sequence specificities for any deoxynucleoside triphosphate substrate. In a second experimental approach, base mispairing between bromouracil and guanine was demonstrated directly by using 5 -bromodideoxyuridine 5 '-triphosphate (BrddUTP). A comparison of chain terminations attributable to BrddUTP and to <b>dideoxythymidine</b> 5 '-triphosphate (ddTTP) revealed that B X A and T X A base pairs formed at about the same rate, whereas B X G mispairs occurred 4 - 10 times more frequently than T X G. The elevation in the frequency of B X G over T X G mispairs is consistent with the mutagenic behavior of the base analogue...|$|E

We previously determined the structure of a ternary complex of the large fragment of DNA polymerase I from Thermus aquaticus (Klentaq 1) bound to a primer/template DNA and a dideoxycytidine 5 ′-triphosphate (ddCTP). In this report, we present the details of the 2. 3 -Å resolution crystal structures of three additional ternary complexes of Klentaq 1 bound to a primer/template DNA and a dideoxyguanosine 5 ′-triphosphate (ddGTP), a <b>dideoxythymidine</b> 5 ′-triphosphate (ddTTP), or a dideoxyadenosine 5 ′-triphosphate (ddATP). Comparison of the active site of the four ternary complexes reveals that the protein residues around the nascent base pair (that formed between the incoming dideoxynucleoside triphosphate [ddNTP] and the template base) form a snug binding pocket into which only a correct Watson-Crick base pair can fit. Except in the ternary complex bound to dideoxyguanosine 5 ′-triphosphate, there are no sequence specific contacts between the protein side chains and the nascent base pair, suggesting that steric constraints imposed by the protein onto the nascent base pair is the major contributor to nucleotide selectivity at the polymerase active site. The protein around the polymerase active site also shows plasticity, which may be responsible for the substrate diversity of the enzyme. Two conserved side chains, Q 754 and R 573, form hydrogen bonds with the N 3 atom in the purine base and O 2 atom in the pyrimidine base at the minor groove side of the base pair formed by the incorporated ddNMP and the corresponding template base in all the four ternary complexes. These hydrogen-bonding interactions may provide a means of detecting misincorporation at this position...|$|E
