5|$|Writer Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) and {{producer}} Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) {{of the show}} TGS with Tracy Jordan have decided to rig the TGS auditions—in which they are {{in search of a}} new cast member on the show—by planning to add bad actors so that their preferred choice, Jayden Michael Tyler (Nick Fondulis), gets hired by their boss, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin). TGS cast member Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) learns that the auditions are taking place and worries that her position on the show will be lessened with the arrival of a new actor. Although Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan), the star of the show, reassures Jenna that the two have nothing to worry about, she remains uneasy. Later, Jenna discovers that Liz and Pete want Jayden to be cast, but she pleads with Liz to pull Jayden out of his audition. Jenna hates him for humiliating her after working together on a play, but Liz does not change her mind about Jayden. Jenna eventually figures out what Liz and Pete are scheming, so she and Tracy <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>find</b> people (Angela Grovey and David Perlman) and bring them to the TGS auditions.|$|E
500|$|With the film's success, it was {{immediately}} decided to finish Superman II. Ilya and Alexander Salkind and Pierre Spengler {{did not ask}} Donner to return because Donner had criticized them during the film's publicity phase. Donner commented in January 1979, [...] "I'd work with Spengler again, but only on my terms. As long as {{he has nothing to}} say as the producer, and is just liaison between Alexander Salkind and his money, that's fine. If they don't want it on those terms, then they need to <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>find</b> another director, it sure as shit ain't gonna be me." [...] Kidder, who portrayed Lois Lane, was dissatisfied by the producers' decision, and also criticized the Salkinds during publicity. As a result, Kidder was only given a cameo appearance for Superman III, and not a main supporting role. Jack O'Halloran, who portrayed Non, stated, [...] "It was great to work with Donner. Richard Lester was as big an asshole as the Salkinds." [...] Two more films, Superman III (1983) and [...] (1987), were produced. Superman Returns was released in 2006. Director Bryan Singer credited the 1978 Superman as an influence for Superman Returns, and used restored footage of Brando as Jor-El. [...] also was released in 2006.|$|E

I happen to believe that we need to continue to do all that we can to discourage drug use, especially with our youth. I would like to see, though, law enforcement prioritize its time and resources and not go out and bust a guy in his house, maybe smoking a joint, who's not doing anybody else any harm, and, in the meantime, <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>find</b> the bad guys and you know, try to help keep society safe that way.

2500|$|Having {{signed the}} {{pre-contract}} with Real Madrid, McManaman still had five months {{left on his}} contract at Liverpool. New manager Gérard Houllier, who had replaced Evans as full coach following the failure of their joint-managerial role, was widely believed to {{want to get rid}} of the [...] "Spice Boys" [...] mentality and cavalier attitudes at the club having told many players they were surplus to requirements (including Jason McAteer, Phil Babb, Rob Jones, Stig Bjornebye and Paul Ince). While stating that he would have preferred that the player stayed, he said that the club had to respect McManaman's decision to exercise his right to leave at the end of his contract. Houllier said, [...] "It wasn't unexpected. Steve had always maintained that he wanted to move abroad and I have to respect that... Emotionally we will miss him because he's a Liverpool lad, and needless to say as a player you can't fault him because he has immense ability... I will have to replace him, it's my job to <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>find</b> another Steve McManaman." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1958, Crews {{joined the}} UC Berkeley English Department, where he taught for 36 years before {{retiring}} as its chair in 1994. Crews was an anti-war activist from 1965 to about 1970 and advocated draft resistance as co-chair of Berkeley’s Faculty Peace Committee. Though he shared the widespread assumption during the mid-1960s that psychoanalytic theory was a valid account of human motivation {{and was one}} of the first academics to apply that theory systematically to the study of literature, Crews gradually came to regard psychoanalysis as a pseudoscience. This convinced him that his loyalty should not belong to any theory but rather to empirical standards and the skeptical point of view. Throughout his career, Crews has brought his concern for rational discourse to the study of various issues, from the controversy over recovered memory, the credibility of the Rorschach test, and belief in alien abductions to the Theosophical Society, creationism, and “intelligent design.” He has also advocated for clear writing based on standards of sound argument and rhetorical effectiveness rather than adherence to rigid school-book rules. “What interests me is general rationality,” said Crews,General rationality requires us to observe the world carefully, to consider alternative hypotheses to our own hypotheses, to gather evidence in a responsible way, to answer objections. These are habits of mind that science shares with good history, good sociology, good political science, good economics, what have you. And I summarize all this in what I call the [...] "empirical attitude." [...] It's a combination of feeling responsible to the evidence that is available, feeling responsible to <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>find</b> that evidence, including the evidence that is contrary to one's presumptions, and responsibility to be logical with one's self and others. And this is an ideal that is not so much individual as social. The rational attitude doesn't really work when simply applied to one's self. It is something that we owe to each other.|$|E
50|$|With {{a warrant}} in hand, and two fellow {{officers}} in tow, Joe returns {{to search the}} lodger's room.

Joe recognizes this woman as the Avenger's first victim. The lodger is arrested, despite Daisy's protests, but he manages to run off into the night. Daisy <b>goes</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>finds</b> him, handcuffed, coatless, and shivering.

If Glenn was well again he must have vastly changed from the moody, stone-faced, and haunted-eyed man who had so worried and distressed her.

Secondly, Entrance into communion with the inhabitants and privileges of this city; in both which the gates do signify Christ: for as no man {{can come to the}} knowledge and enjoyment of the God, and glorious Saviour, but by and through the Lord Christ; so no man can come into true and spiritual communion with these inhabitants, but by him also: 'I am the way,' saith he, 'and the truth, and the life; no man cometh unto the Father but by me': and again, 'I am the door, by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall <b>go</b> in <b>and</b> <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> <b>find</b> pasture' (John 10:1-9; 14:6).|$|R

I don't know now how we happened to want all that money at one time; I only know we had to have it.

He didn't seem to have any doubt that we would succeed, but I knew that that was his religion working in him; I hadn't the same confidence; I hadn't any idea where to turn to raise all that bullion, and I said so. I think he was ashamed of me, privately, because of my weak faith. He told me to give myself no uneasiness, no concern; and said in a simple, confident, and unquestioning way, [...] "the Lord will provide."

I did fail in every honest thing I touched," [...] he continued, bitterly. [...] "Then I tried a bold experiment. It was the last thing offered, the last {{wonderful}} chance. I took it, and I won. Then I returned. I paid him back the money which he had lent me--I did my best to seem grateful. It was of no use. He mistrusted me from the first. In his own house I was the butt for his scornful speeches. I was even bidden to leave. I ventured to speak to the woman with whom he is slavishly in love, and he came to me like a fury. If I had been a hairdresser posing as a duke, he {{could not have been more}} violent. He wanted me to promise never to speak to her again--her or you. I refused. Then he declared war, and, Lois, there are weak joints in my armor. You see, I admit it to you--never to him. When he finds his way there, he will thrust. That is why I struck first." ...|$|E
40|$|Peer review, {{our current}} system for {{determining}} which papers {{to accept and}} which to reject by journals and conferences, has limitations that impair the quality of scientific communication. Under the current system, reviewers have only {{a limited amount of}} time to devote to evaluating papers and each paper receives an equal amount of attention regardless of how good the paper is. We propose to implement a new system for conference peer review based on ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithms. In our model, each reviewer has a set of ants that <b>goes</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>finds</b> articles. The reviewer assesses the paper that the ant brings according to the criteria specified by the conference organizers and the ant deposits pheromone that is proportional {{to the quality of the}} review. Each subsequent ant then samples the pheromones and probabilistically selects the next article based on the strength of the pheromones. We used an agent-based model to determine if an ACO-based paper selection system will direct reviewers’ attention to the best articles and if the average quality of papers increases with each round of reviews. We also conducted an experiment in conjunction with the 2011 UNM Computer Science Graduate Student Association conference and compared the results with our simulation. To assess the usefulness of our approach, we compared our algorithm to a greedy algorithm that always takes the best un-reviewed paper and a latent factor analysis recommender-based system. We found that the ACO-based algorithm was better than either of the greedy or recommender algorithms at directing users’ attention to the better papers.

40|$|The Complete Birder, A Guide to Better Birding, Jack Connor, {{illustrated}} by Margaret LaFarge, xiii + 285 pp., Houghton Mifflin Co., Boston, softcover 8. 95. The Complete Birder {{is divided into}} twelve chapters that can aid both the serious birder and the beginning birder. Connor opens with a chapter entitled 2 ̆ 2 The Sporting Science 2 ̆ 2. In this chapter he unequivocally states outright that birding is not easy, no matter how experienced one is nor how well equipped. He does say, and I tend to agree, that 2 ̆ 2 birding can be exhilarating, enlightening, evocative, or exasperating [...] and often all of these at once He uses this chapter to historically relate his development as a birder. The process was a slow, prolonged, tortuous development. Excellent chapters on optics and acoustics follow. Connor explains all the details to look for when buying the right binoculars, spotting scopes, and tripods. He states that the road to good birding is done by upgrading the binoculars the birder uses. To do this involves comparison shopping and careful analysis of the technical information. One needs to know what one wants {{to do as a}} birder. Then one <b>goes</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>finds</b> the binoculars <b>and</b> other equipment that best suit one 2 ̆ 7 s needs. Once one has binoculars, one needs to use them in the field on a regular basis. Becoming a good birder cannot be accomplished by resting on the living room sofa {{in front of the television}} set. Birding experience is gained through contact with nature. In addition, the author leads the reader though the various ways the reader can use the bird songs and calls to become a better birder. This requires practice and a number of other fine-honed mnemonic skills. These skills are not acquired overnight...|$|R
