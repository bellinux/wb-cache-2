The incurred footprint applies to both the individual unit (vessel, column or tank) and the collection (or array) of units/vessels in a skid.

40|$|Master's thesis in Environmental TechnologyProduced {{water quality}} {{has become an}} {{increasingly}} large area {{of concern for the}} oil production industry. A great deal of scientific research has been carried out to determine the consequences of long term exposure of produced water on the environment. Some of this research has given alarming results. It is reported that some of the toxic components in produced water may cause irreversible damage to the surrounding environment. Because of this potential risk, very considerable efforts are being expended by the oil companies operating in the North-East Atlantic into developing new techniques to better manage produced water. Production facilities have been re-evaluating their conventional approaches to oil removal from water due to increasing water cuts caused by the maturation of their oil wells, as well as a need for cleaner water for re-injection or disposal purposes. Over the years a variety of oil/water separation methods have been developed throughout the world, including gravity separation, corrugated plate interceptors, centrifugal separation, hydrocyclones, <b>induced</b> <b>gas</b> <b>flotation</b> and many other emerging technologies. With increasingly tight legislative limits on OIW (Oil in Water) discharges, it is important that oil and gas operators have an effective produced water treatment system. To meet these required limits for discharges depends largely on the choice of technology system. However, there are different technologies used for produced water treatment but this thesis takes {{a closer look at the}} various flotation technologies commonly used by many industries for produced water treatment...|$|E

The process floats solids, oils and other contaminants to the surface of liquids. Once on the surface these contaminants are skimmed off and removed from the liquids. Oil and gas production facilities have used flotation systems to remove oil and solids from their produced and processed water (wastewater) for many years.The relative density of candle wax is 0.93, hence objects made of wax float on water.|$|R
40|$|Water {{contaminated}} with hydrocarbons often results during {{the production of}} oil. The polluted water, which may be naturally occurring or a result of water or steam flooding operations, must be cleaned before disposal or re-injection. These brines are usually {{contaminated with}} emulsified oil droplets, 2 - 10 microns in diameter. Conventional phase separation techniques are often inadequate in cleaning such waters. Presently, gas floatation combined with chemical additives to promote oil droplet flocculation are used to purify these waters. However, if stricter discharge limits are imposed by the Environmental Protection Agency, the <b>gas</b> <b>flotation</b> method {{is likely to be}} inadequate. A new process was developed which utilizes carbon dioxide to clean oilfield brines. The new treatment method, described in this work, is actually an enhancement of existing <b>gas</b> <b>flotation</b> technology. The enhancement results from the use of carbon dioxide as the sweeping gas combined with its ability to lower the pH of the aqueous system. The reduction of pH neutralizes the charge {{on the surface of the}} drop, thus de-stabilizing the emulsion and enhancing phase separation. The water is simply neutralized by flashing the treated water to ambient pressure. The important discoveries of this study and an economic comparison of the carbon dioxide treatment process with other potential processes are presented in this paper...|$|R
40|$|Produced {{water is}} the largest waste stream {{produced}} in the recovery of oil and gas. The processing of produced water occurs in several stages including <b>gas</b> <b>flotation.</b> Gas flotation is separation by gravity {{and the effectiveness of}} <b>gas</b> <b>flotation</b> is dependant {{on the size of the}} gas bubble, the distribution of bubbles and the degree of dispersion. The concentration of oil and the chemical content of the produced water play a role, a long with the pH, viscosity and the interfacial properties between the oil, gas and brine. Interfacial tension, wettability and spreading coefficient is interfacial properties that are important for the effectiveness of <b>gas</b> <b>flotation.</b> The aim of this thesis is to see how dynamic adsorption of heteroatoms affects the interfacial tension and properties of solutions with different concentrations and at different pH values. The chemicals used in this thesis are Pyridine, Phenol and 3 -cyclopentyl propionic acid. The interfacial tension measurements were done on a Maximum Bubble Pressure Tensiometer, which measures the interfacial tension at short time scales. Throughout this thesis three chemicals with different properties, concentrations and various pH have been used. Each chemical shows different behaviour in both MQ-water and synthetic brine. Pyridine shows similar behaviour for all the six concentrations at pH 2 in both MQ-water and synthetic brine compared to the other pH values. For pH 7 and pH 10 the influence of concentration is more sever. The influence of pH at the higher pH values is almost non-existing for Pyridine in MQ-water. For Phenol in MQ-water an increase in concentration will lead to a decrease in surface tension. The influence of pH on Phenol indicates that at lower pH values Phenol is more soluble. For Phenol in synthetic brine the changes in pH has no affect on the surface tension. When comparing the result for Phenol in synthetic brine and MQ-water it is clear that the solubility of Phenol decreases in synthetic brine, leading to more sever decrease in surface tension in MQ-water than in synthetic brine. For 3 -cyclopentyl propionic acid the influence of concentration on surface tension is clear. The decrease in surface tension before equilibrium values are reached is larger for this acid, due to the size of the molecule. The surface tension for this acid seems to be dependent on pH at low and at high concentrations...|$|R

50|$|The soil vapor {{extraction}} remediation technology uses vacuum blowers and extraction wells to <b>induce</b> <b>gas</b> {{flow through}} the subsurface, collecting contaminated soil vapor, which is subsequently treated aboveground. SVE systems can rely on gas inflow through natural routes or specific wells may be installed for gas inflow (forced or natural). The vacuum extraction of soil <b>gas</b> <b>induces</b> <b>gas</b> flow across a site, increasing the mass transfer driving force from aqueous (soil moisture), non-aqueous (pure phase), and solid (soil) phase into the gas phase. Air flow across a site is thus a key aspect, but soil moisture and subsurface heterogeneity (i.e., a mixture of low and high permeability materials) can result in less gas flow across some zones. In some situations, such as enhancement of monitored natural attenuation, a passive SVE system that relies on barometric pumping may be employed.|$|R

40|$|Ion induced {{pressure}} instability {{is a potential}} problem for the ILC positron damping ring (DR) if the chosen pumping scheme does not provide sufficient pumping. The ion {{induced pressure}} instability effect results from ionisation of residual gas molecules by the beam particles, their acceleration in the field of the beam towards the vacuum chamber walls, causing ion <b>induced</b> <b>gas</b> desorption from vacuum chamber walls; these gas molecules in their turn can also be ionised, accelerated and cause further gas desorption. If the pumping is insufficient, this effect may cause a pressure instability, in which the pressure in the beam chamber grows rapidly to an unacceptable level. To analyse the ion induced pressure instability in the ILC positron DR the energy gained by ions was calculated for the appropriate beam parameters; {{it was found that the}} energy gain of ions will be about 300 eV. The ion <b>induced</b> <b>gas</b> desorption was estimated, and pumping solutions to avoid the ion induced pressure instability are suggested.

40|$|The design beam {{lifetime}} of 100 h for LHC imposes stringent requirements on the residual gas density in the vacuum chamber. This density can strongly increase due to ion <b>induced</b> <b>gas</b> desorption, {{as it was}} observed {{for the first time}} in the ISR. In the LHC, the ion <b>induced</b> <b>gas</b> desorption may lead to pressure runaway and, consequently, to the loss of the proton beam. The beam current that can be stored is limited, being the residual gas ionisation rate proportional to the beam current. Given the geometry and the pumping speed of the chamber, there is a critical current, above which the gas density diverges. In this paper, the gas density profile and the stability conditions are evaluated for different sections of the LHC, both for the elements at cryogenic and room temperature. For the cryogenic elements, it is found that the stability at ultimate beam current (0. 85 A) can be guaranteed if a beam screen is interposed between the proton beam and the cold bore vacuum chambers. In the warm sections, baking and discharge cleaning can ensure stability if the appropriate pumping is provided. ...|$|R

The pathogenesis is hypothesized to be a relationship of the multifaceted factors causing PI (St. Peter et al. 2003). One of these factors is vascular disease as an underlying disease.

40|$|Produced {{water is}} water co-produced {{with oil and}} gas during {{petroleum}} production. It {{is a very complex}} mixture and contains different compounds that can have negative impact on the environments. It is therefore important that the hazardous constituents are removed from the produced water in order to comply with the environmental regulations that the governments require. As the fields mature the amount of produced water will increase and it is thus crucial to handle this by-product efficiently. The produced water is either re-injected into the reservoir or discharged to the sea. There exist several techniques for separating the oil and the water and one common method is <b>gas</b> <b>flotation,</b> where dispersed oil and particles adhere to rising gas bubbles. The efficiency of this method is largely dependent on the spreading coefficient which needs to be positive to achieve effective <b>gas</b> <b>flotation.</b> The aim of this study was therefore to investigate the surface tension between produced water and gas bubbles at short time scales. The produced water was prepared with various crude oils, various brine compositions and various pH values and the effect of these parameters on the surface tension were studied. The produced water samples were prepared by mixing crude oil and brine and then separating the two phases. Three different crude oils and three different brines in addition to pure water with various pH values were used. The surface tension of the samples was measured by a bubble pressure tensiometer (BP 100) and {{it was found that the}} changes in surface tension were largely dependent on the crude oil composition. The produced water samples made with crude oil I had most influence on surface tension at high pH values whereas the change in brine composition did not seem to influence the surface tension significantly. The samples made with crude oil B had similar effect on the surface tension regardless of the pH and composition of the brine. This indicates that other surface active compounds than acids and bases contribute to the change in surface tension. The samples made with crude oil F did not show any obvious trend regarding the surface tension for the various pH values and brine composition and the reason for this is not clear. In addition to surface tension measurements the samples were analyzed with the UV-visible spectroscopy method to get an indication of the concentration and type of compounds that was present in the produced water samples. Two samples were also measured with the IR spectroscopy method to get more information about the contents of the samples. There should be done more IR analysis and also other analysis like TOC to get more information about the contents of the produced water samples in the future. </p...|$|R

40|$|Two {{case studies}} {{completed}} {{under the direction}} of Jacobs Engineering are presented and discussed. In the first case study, the economics of the installation of an oil cooler are examined. A vapor recovery unit (VRU) for an enhanced oil recovery (EOR) facility in Grieve, WY, will be installed to capture the vapors from an oil tank. With the installation of the VRU, a question arose: would an oil cooler proposed to be installed before the oil tank be necessary? A simulation and economic analysis of the process suggests that oil cooler installation is still economically favorable. When the low pressure (LP) separator is operated at the typical temperature of 140 °F, nine additional barrels of oil per day (BOPD) are recovered through the use of an oil cooler. The net present worth (NPW) of oil cooler installation is calculated to be 248, 000.

40|$|The {{amount of}} {{produced}} water during oil production is increasing as oil fields mature. Produced {{water is the}} largest source of pollution in the production phase, and can be treated by a method known as <b>gas</b> <b>flotation.</b> To increase the efficiency of this method, the surface tension between the produced water and air should {{be as high as}} possible. In this study, acid solutions were used as model produced water to investigate how salinity, pH, and the structure and concentration of surfactants influence the surface tension. The acids studied are 4 -heptylbenzoic acid, decanoic acid, and 3 -cyclopentylpropionic acid. Two models are used to investigate the limiting transport mechanisms of short-time-limit adsorption. The measurements were done by means of a Du N&# 246;uy ring tensiometer and a maximum bubble pressure tensiometer. The results indicate that the surface tension of the surfactants decrease when salt is added to the solution. The structure of the surfactant is highly important, as longer chained surfactants have shown to have a higher tendency to adsorb at the interface. The presence of a benzene ring in the hydrocarbon chain has shown to reduce the surface tension. Increasing the pH of a solution of 3 -cyclopentylpropionic has shown to cause an increase in surface tension. The results also indicate that an adsorption barrier is present at concentrations above the CMC, and in surfactant solutions in absence of salt. </p...|$|R
