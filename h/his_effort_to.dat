5|$|Earlier travels had exposed Géricault {{to victims}} of {{insanity}} and plague, and while researching the Méduse <b>his</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> be historically accurate and realistic led to an obsession with the stiffness of corpses. To achieve the most authentic rendering of the flesh tones of the dead, he made sketches of bodies in the morgue of the Hospital Beaujon, studied the faces of dying hospital patients, brought severed limbs back to his studio to study their decay, and for a fortnight drew a severed head, borrowed from a lunatic asylum and stored on his studio roof.|$|E

When he accidentally injures a construction worker, the court deems him a public menace, ordering him to move to a retirement home. However, Carl resolves to keep his promise to Ellie by turning his house into a makeshift airship, using thousands of helium balloons.

5|$|Initially {{supported}} by Irish Catholics in <b>his</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> regain the thrones, James launched {{an expedition to}} Ireland in March 1689. He abandoned it upon his defeat at the Battle of the Boyne in 1690. During James's campaign, Mary supported his cause throughout the British Isles: she sent three French supply ships to Bantry Bay and £2,000 to Jacobite rebels in Dundee. She financed those measures by selling her jewellery. Money problems plagued the Stuart court-in-exile, despite a substantial pension from Louis XIV of 50,000 livres. Mary tried her best to assist those of her husband's followers living in poverty, and encouraged her children to give part of their pocket money to Jacobite refugees.|$|E
5|$|Potemkin then {{embarked}} on a period of city-founding. Construction started at his first effort, Kherson, in 1778, {{as a base for}} a new Black Sea Fleet he intended to build. Potemkin approved every plan himself, but construction was slow, and the city proved costly and vulnerable to plague. Next was the port of Akhtiar, annexed with the Crimea, which became Sevastopol. Then he built Simferopol as the Crimean capital. His biggest failure, however, was <b>his</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> build the city of Ekaterinoslav (lit. The glory of Catherine), now Dnipropetrovsk. The second most successful city of Potemkin's rule was Nikolayev (now better known as Mykolaiv), which he founded in 1789. Potemkin also initiated the redesign of Odessa after its capture from the Turks; it was to {{turn out to be the}} greatest.|$|E

Legend has it that Goddess Saraswati helped him in <b>his</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> compete with a rival in the kings court. Jinasena was the spiritual preceptor and guru of Amoghavarsha I. A theologian, his contributions are Dhavala and Jayadhavala (written with another theologian Virasena). These writings are named after their patron king who was also called Athishayadhavala. Other contributions from Jinasena were Adipurana, later completed by his disciple Gunabhadra, Harivamsha and Parshvabhyudaya.|$|E
5|$|Although {{some historians}} have belittled Grant's cabinet as being mediocre, {{according}} to biographers Jean Edward Smith and Ron Chernow, it had distinguished members, including former congressmen, senators, governors, and judges. Without senatorial consultation, Grant's unconventional cabinet choices sparked both criticism and approval. In <b>his</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> create national harmony, he purposely avoided choosing Republican Party leaders, selecting several non-politicians. Grant chose two close friends for important posts: Elihu B. Washburne for Secretary of State and John A. Rawlins as Secretary of War; Washburne was soon appointed minister to France {{and replaced by}} conservative New York statesman Hamilton Fish. Rawlins died in office after serving only a few months, replaced by William W. Belknap of Iowa. For Treasury, he appointed wealthy New York merchant Alexander T. Stewart, who was found ineligible and replaced by Representative George S. Boutwell, a Massachusetts Radical Republican. Grant appointed Philadelphia businessman Adolph E. Borie Secretary of Navy, who soon resigned, {{and was replaced by}} a relative unknown, George M. Robeson. Grant's nomination of James Longstreet, a former Confederate general, to the position of Surveyor of customs of the port of New Orleans, was met with general amazement, and was largely seen as a genuine effort to unite the North and South. Other cabinet appointments—Jacob D. Cox (Interior), John Creswell (Postmaster General), and Ebenezer Rockwood Hoar (Attorney General)—were well received.|$|E
5|$|Buemi elected not {{to change}} tyres and gained the overall lead. Conway later served a drive-through penalty for his {{collision}} with Shaytar. The repairs to Van der Garde's vehicle meant he was stationary in his pit stall for four minutes which allowed Merhi to inherit fifth position in LMP2. Tréluyer reported to Audi that his car had no front downforce, while Buemi went off the track at Raidillon in <b>his</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> push hard to extend his lead over Bernhard. Buemi was held up {{by one of the}} SMP entrants and an Aston Martin at Fagnes causing his advantage to be reduced to 1.015 seconds. The Toyota driver missed his braking point at the Bus Stop chicane and went wide at La Source shortly afterwards, causing him to lose the first position to Bernhard. Buemi reclaimed the position at Eau Rouge but temporarily fell to second again after Bernhard overtook him on the Kemmel straight and retook the place before the entry to Les Combes. At Blanchimont corner, Bernhard avoided colliding heavily with the rear-end of Buemi's car after the latter slid while lapping Gulf Racing's Porsche entry.|$|E

5|$|Moses Hazen {{had served}} as a {{lieutenant}} in the 44th Regiment during the French and Indian War and was receiving a half-pay pension for his British service. In 1775, while he was living on this plus the income from his estate in St. Jean, Quebec, the colonial army invaded. Nevertheless, Hazen was arrested by the British on suspicion of spying for the Americans. He was held a prisoner for 54 days, until he was finally released by General Montgomery after the fall of Montreal in November. Hazen then joined the American cause, and took part in the battle of Quebec. Following the American failure to take the city, Hazen and Edward Antill, an American expatriate, traveled to Philadelphia to report on the battle. Congress partially compensated Hazen by establishing the 2nd Canadian Regiment. He accepted the command, thus forfeiting his British half-pay. Antill was made lieutenant colonel of the regiment. Although John Duggan, one of Livingston's captains, had been promised a regiment by Benedict Arnold, Hazen and Antill reached Philadelphia before Duggan, and Hazen smeared his name in <b>his</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> get command of the regiment.|$|E
5|$|Nasir al-Dawla {{was born}} al-Hasan ibn Abdallah, {{the eldest son}} of Abu'l-Hayja Abdallah ibn Hamdan (died 929), son of Hamdan ibn Hamdun ibn al-Harith, who gave his name to the Hamdanid dynasty. The Hamdanids were {{a branch of the}} Banu Taghlib, an Arab tribe {{resident}} {{in the area of the}} Jazira (Upper Mesopotamia) since pre-Islamic times. The Taghlibs had traditionally controlled Mosul and its region until the late 9th century, when the Abbasid government tried to impose firmer control over the province. Hamdan ibn Hamdun was one of the most determined Taghlibi leaders in opposing this move. Notably, in <b>his</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> fend off the Abbasids, he secured the alliance of the Kurds living in the mountains north of Mosul, a fact which would be of considerable importance in his family's later fortunes. Family members intermarried with Kurds, who were also prominent in the Hamdanid military.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps the {{greatest}} controversy of Sanford's presidency was <b>his</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> establish the presidential library of former US President Richard Nixon at Duke. Sanford raised {{the subject with}} Nixon {{during a visit to}} the former president at Nixon's New York City office on July 28, 1981. Sanford continued to seek Nixon's advice on multiple issues within the months that followed. The library proposal became public in mid-August, creating considerable controversy at the university. Though Sanford enjoyed some support for his effort, most of the faculty were against the proposal, the largest concern being that the facility would be a monument to Nixon rather than a center of study. Sanford tried to engineer a compromise, but the proposal by the Duke Academic Council of a library only a third the size of that which Nixon wanted and their rejection of a Nixon museum to accompany it, ultimately led Nixon to decline Sanford's offer and site his library in the city of his birth, Yorba Linda, California, instead; it was dedicated there in 1990.|$|E

Smith served until 2007 and Davies until 2010; additionally, Leigh Hampton (previously co-executive producer in the later days of the network version and in the syndicated version's first two seasons) served as an executive producer from 2004 to 2010. Rich Sirop, who was previously a supervising producer, became the executive producer in 2010 and held that position until 2014, when he left Millionaire to hold the same position with Vieira's newly launched syndicated talk show, {{and was replaced by}} James Rowley. Vincent Rubino, who had previously been the syndicated Millionaires supervising producer for its first two seasons, served as that version's co-executive producer for the 2004–05 season, after which he was succeeded by Vieira herself, who continued to hold the title until her departure in 2013 (sharing her position with Sirop for the 2009–10 season).|$|E

Alonso maintained the lead throughout the remainder of the event and crossed the start/finish line on lap 67 to secure the 23rd victory of his Formula One career. Massa finished second 4.1 seconds behind, and was ahead of Vettel in third. Hamilton secured fourth, with teammate Button in fifth. Webber reduced his pace and managed to finish in sixth place. Kubica, Rosberg, Schumacher and Petrov rounded out the points-scoring positions. Kobayashi {{was the first of the}} non-points scorers in eleventh, followed by Barrichello and Hülkenberg.

5|$|As {{the fall}} of Thessalonica {{appeared}} imminent, Pope Honorius excommunicated Theodore, ordered an embargo on horses, troops, and supplies from the Adriatic ports, and sent letters to Constantinople urging assistance to Demetrius. Demetrius himself went to Italy to seek aid, being received by the Pope in Rome in March 1222 and by Emperor Frederick II (r. 1220–50) soon after. A crusade was proclaimed against Theodore, and troops began to gather in Italy. In the meantime, the Latin Empire, now under Robert of Courtenay (r. 1221–28), was once more embroiled in warfare with Nicaea as it supported Laskaris' brothers in their challenge against the new Nicaean emperor, John III Doukas Vatatzes (r. 1222–54). The first detachments of the assembling crusade, under Count Oberto II of Biandrate, arrived at Thessalonica in summer 1222 and joined the de facto regent, Guy Pallavicini. Theodore now hastened his move against Thessalonica. After preliminary operations in late 1222, in early 1223 he laid siege to the city. Honorius excommunicated him again, and redoubled <b>his</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> promote the crusade, which {{had come to a}} standstill in the meantime. At the Pope's urging, Venice and Emperor Frederick promised aid. Robert of Courtenay also pledged to assist, while Honorius called upon the Latin princes of southern Greece to join in the effort. The crusade finally assembled at Brindisi in March 1224. In his instructions to his legate, however, Honorius did not rule out the possibility of Theodore {{coming to terms with the}} Crusaders. True to his word, in April 1224 Robert of Courtenay sent an army to besiege Serres. During the siege, the Latin generals learned of the disastrous defeat of the main Latin army at the hands of John III Doukas Vatatzes at the Battle of Poimanenon. They lifted the siege and hastened back to Constantinople, only to be intercepted by Theodore's men; most of the Latin army were killed or taken prisoner.|$|E

5|$|Duval {{recorded}} the race's fastest lap on the 30th lap, completing a circuit of {{one minute and}} 22.600 seconds, earning him one championship point. Rosenqvist drove at reduced speed as he was struggling to conserve his battery's energy usage, allowing Bird to close up to him. Bird drafted in Rosenqvist's slipstream and overtook him under braking for second place at the eleventh corner on lap 31. Rosenqvist focused on continuing <b>his</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> preserve electrical energy usage to {{reach the end of}} the event. On the final lap, after Piquet locked his brakes, Evans ran wide, drove off the circuit, and hit the barriers lining the track; he was able to continue. Duval stopped his car for the second time on the same lap. Buemi held the lead {{for the rest of the}} race to secure the victory. Bird finished second, ahead of the third-placed Rosenqvist. Prost took fourth, with di Grassi in fifth. Abt and Turvey overtook Vergne on the final lap to claim the sixth and seventh positions. Heidfeld and López rounded out the top-ten points scoring positions. Frijns, Sarrazin, d'Ambrosio, Carroll and Ma filled the next five places, with Piquet, Evans and Duval the last of the classified finishers. It was Buemi's second consecutive victory of the season, and his eighth in Formula E. There were four lead changes in the race; two drivers reached the front of the field. Rosenqvist's 26 laps led was the highest of any competitor. Buemi led twice for a total of seven laps.|$|E
5|$|Ganteaume's fleet {{remained}} off the Cape Derna for {{the next}} six days, performing repairs to the captured vessel to make it seaworthy. Detachments of sailors were taken from all of the ships in the squadron and transferred to the prize, and on 30 June Ganteaume's force was ready to sail northwest once again, eventually reaching Toulon without further incident on 22 July. Ganteaume used the capture of Swiftsure to excuse the failure of <b>his</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> reinforce Egypt, which was invaded and captured by a British expeditionary force {{in the spring and summer}} of 1801. While in captivity, Hallowell wrote a letter that was published in Britain praising the treatment he and his men had received while prisoners of war under Ganteaume, and he and his officers were released on parole the following month. On 18 August they faced a court martial on board HMS Genereux at Port Mahon in Menorca to investigate the loss of their ship, and were all honourably cleared of any blame. He was also praised for detaching the convoy, which otherwise might have also been lost. Hallowell subsequently returned to naval service in 1803 at the start the Napoleonic Wars, operating in the Caribbean and Mediterranean and eventually becoming a rear-admiral in 1811. Swiftsure, one of only five British ships of the line to be captured by the French during the entire war, was subsequently commissioned into the French Navy and remained in service {{for the next}} four years until recaptured at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805.|$|E
