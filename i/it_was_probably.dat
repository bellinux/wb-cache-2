5|$|Her uncle Ásmundr {{probably}} {{died in the}} Battle of Fýrisvellir, in the 980s, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> at {{the side}} of king Eric the Victorious. Özurr had entered into the service of a more powerful liege and died for the Byzantine Emperor. Halfdan may have died either on Bornholm or in a holmgang, whereas where Kári died remains uncertain. The most likely interpretation may be that he died on Od, the old name for the north-western cape of Zealand, but {{it is also possible that}} it was at Dundee in Scotland. Búi's location of death is not given, but Larsson (2002) comments that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> in a way that was not considered as glorious as those of his brothers.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> in the {{aftermath}} of his victory (if not before) that the Thessalians appointed Philip archon of Thessaly. This was an appointment for life, and gave Philip control over all the revenues of the Thessalian Confederation, and furthermore made Philip leader of the united Thessalian army.|$|E

5|$|Most of Leonardo's {{writings}} are in mirror-image cursive. While secrecy {{is often}} suggested {{as the reason}} for this style of writing, it may have been more of a practical expediency. Since Leonardo wrote with his left hand, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> easier for him to write from right to left.|$|E
5|$|The Beds of Nogon-Tsav are {{considered}} to be the same age as the Nemegt Formation. This geologic formation has never been dated radiometrically, but the fauna present in the fossil record indicate <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> deposited during the Maastrichtian stage, {{at the end of the}} Late Cretaceous.|$|E
5|$|The western {{terminus}} of {{the early}} medieval linear earthwork Nico Ditch is in Hough Moss, just {{to the east of}} Stretford; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> used as an administrative boundary and dates from the 8th or 9th century.|$|E
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> {{the most}} {{cultivated}} of all dryandras.|$|R

5|$|To the {{south-west}} of Constantine's lands lay {{the kingdom}} of Strathclyde. This extended north into the Lennox, east to the River Forth, and south into the Southern Uplands. In 900 <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> ruled by King Dyfnwal.|$|E
5|$|A brick privy with a {{gabled roof}} clad in {{corrugated}} asbestos sheeting is located {{to the north}} of the cottage building. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> constructed circa 1930. Further north is the workshop building, which also housed the electricity generators at one point, dating from the 1950s. It features a flat and skillion roof, and concrete mounting blocks. Its most recent use was as a fishermen's cabin.|$|E
5|$|After {{the fall}} of Constantinople in 1453, the codex was brought to Florence by an émigré scholar. It belonged to Niccolo Ridolpho († 1550) Cardinal of Florence. After his death <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> bought by Piero Strozzi, an Italian {{military}} leader, for Catherine de' Medici. Catherine brought it to France {{as part of her}} dowry, and from the Bourbon royal library it came to rest in the Bibliothèque nationale de France, Paris. The manuscript was bound in 1602.|$|E

5|$|As a diplodocid, it is {{probable}} that Dinheirosaurus possessed a whip-tail. If it did, it is likely that its tail could be used like a bullwhip, with supersonic speed. Being related to both Apatosaurus and Diplodocus, Dinheirosaurus probably possessed a squared snout. This means that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> a non-selective ground-feeding sauropod.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} part of the Commonwealth period, he {{continued}} to serve on Parliamentary committees. However, he attracted accusations of corruption. In September 1650, these accusations led to him giving up his post at Tilbury Fort. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> around this time that he married his second wife, Joanna van Tromp.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the death}} in 1361 of William de Cambuslang, Bishop of Dunblane, Walter {{was elected by}} the Dunblane cathedral chapter {{to be the new}} bishop. On his election, Walter possessed no benefices in the diocese, and had had none since giving up his Abernethy prebend a decade before. However, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> the diocese of his birth, and he had almost become archdeacon of the diocese in 1345.|$|E

5|$|In 1294, {{however, the}} Welsh leader Madoc ap Llywelyn mounted a major revolt across Wales. Richard Fitzalan, the Earl of Arundel, was ordered in mid-October {{to ensure that}} the castle was secure, but by late October the castle was under siege from Madoc's forces. Robert FitzWalter, the castle's constable, was sent to lead a relief expedition. The final fate of Castell y Bere is uncertain, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> taken by Welsh forces in late 1294 and {{subsequently}} burnt.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not clear}} when Roskilde became a market town but it was {{certainly}} enjoying trading privileges under King Eric II who reigned from 1134 to 1137. These privileges were firmly established when the Roskilde City Council granted market town status to other towns on Zealand on 15 June 1268. By that time, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> {{the largest and most}} important town in Denmark. In 1370, the city owned 2,600 farms throughout Zealand.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> Amenhotep I {{who founded}} the {{artisans}} village at Deir el-Medina, whose inhabitants were responsible {{for much of the}} art which filled the tombs in the Theban Necropolis for the following generations of New Kingdom rulers and nobles. The earliest name found there is that of Thutmose I, however Amenhotep was clearly an important figure to the city's workmen since he and his mother were both its patron deities.|$|E

5|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> {{introduced}} into Britain in the Tudor period by 1500 and was first {{recorded in the}} wild in 1632 in Kent. The date of its first introduction into Ireland is unclear, but the oldest specimen in Ireland is in County Cavan and dates from the seventeenth century. It was {{introduced into}} Sweden around 1770 with seeds obtained from Holland.|$|E
5|$|Launceston Castle {{was built}} after the Norman conquest of England, {{probably}} following {{the capture of}} Exeter in 1068. It was built at a strategic location, then called Dunhevet, controlling the area between Bodmin Moor and Dartmoor, and the access over the Polson ford into Cornwall. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> constructed by Robert, the Count of Mortain, who was granted the earldom of Cornwall by William the Conqueror.|$|E
5|$|Most of the equipment, arms, and {{machinery}} at the Little Rock Arsenal was removed to {{east of the}} Mississippi River by order of Maj. Gen. Earl Van Dorn in April and May 1862, and accountability for it is lost at that point. By all appearances, the equipment was sent down the river to Napoleon, Arkansas, {{and from there to}} Jackson Mississippi, where <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> destroyed during the Vicksburg campaign in the early summer of 1863.|$|E
