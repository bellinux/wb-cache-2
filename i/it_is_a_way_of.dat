Social influence takes place when one's thoughts, actions and feelings are affected by other people. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> interaction that affects individual behavior and can occur within groups and between groups. It is a fundamental process that affects ways of socialization, conformity, leadership and social change.|$|E
25|$|Critical {{understanding}} is a cerebral mode of comprehension, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> thinking, {{and thus is}} not dependent upon external expression. Yet it requires external manifestation {{in order to be}} communicated. The expression of critical understanding can take various forms including formal or informal speech, academic writing, creative prose or poetry or visual outcomes. It can take different forms in different cultures and this needs to be taken into consideration when assessing critical results.|$|E
25|$|However, some Japanese fans {{of hip-hop}} find it {{embarrassing}} and ridiculous that these blackface fans {{do this because}} {{they feel like they}} shouldn't change their appearance to embrace the culture. In some instances it {{can be seen as a}} racist act, but for many of the young the Japanese fans <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> immersing in the hip hop culture the way they see fit. For example, the Japanese hip hop group Soul'd Out is extremely imitative of African American culture. Looking at Soul'd Out, their appearance stands out. Their wardrobe undoubtedly reminds one of African American fashion.|$|E

25|$|The {{geometric}} or floral, interlaced forms, taken together, {{constitute an}} infinitely repeated pattern that {{extends beyond the}} visible material world. To many in the Islamic world, they symbolize the concept of infinite proves of existence of one eternal God. The repetitiveness, simplicity contrasted with complexity and percision suggests that our complex universe {{is only one of}} the many manifestations of the infinitely obvious and present Allah, the one God. Furthermore, the Islamic artist conveys a definite spirituality without the iconography of Christian art. Non-figural ornaments are used in mosques and buildings around the Muslim world, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> decorating using beautiful, embellishing and repetitive Islamic art instead of using pictures of humans and animals (which some Muslims believe is forbidden (Haram) in Islam).|$|E
25|$|The {{objective}} is also cultural. The movement aims {{to bring a}} new look on Syria by focusing on its cultural diversity and richness, beyond ubiquitous images of despair. According to Leila Shahid for La Marseilleise, Syria is a great cultural nation, a pluricultural leader of artistic creation. Journalist Alain Laurens commented that the Syrian cultural caravan’s involvement makes the public forget during the performance about all the bombings in Aleppo and Damascus and {{make room for a}} humane and fraternal communion. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> showing that the Syrian cultural scene and its artists is alive and thriving. Finally, the road trip allows the Cultural Caravan to make art and culture come to the people, therefore going upstream of artistic and cultural centralisation. Most of the time, the exhibition is set up outside, making it accessible to a greater number.|$|E
25|$|Typically, {{older men}} and women {{maintaining}} interest in sexual interest and activity could be therapeutic; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> expressing their love and care for one another. Factors such as biological and psychological factors, diseases, mental conditions, boredom with the relationship, and widowhood {{have been found to}} contribute with the common decrease in sexual interest and activity in old age. National sex surveys given in Finland in the 1990s revealed aging men had a higher incidence of sexual intercourse compared to aging women and that women {{were more likely to report}} a lack of sexual desire compared to men. Regression analysis, factors considered important to female sexual activity included: sexual desire, valuing sexuality, and a healthy partner, while high sexual self-esteem, good health, and active sexual history were important to male sexual activity. Both aging genders agreed they needed good health, good sexual functioning, positive sexual self-esteem, and a sexually skilful partner to maintain sexual desire.|$|E

25|$|Jewish {{communities}} in Yemen, {{prior to their}} immigration to the Land of Israel, did not place headstones over the graves of the dead, except only on rare occasions, choosing rather to follow the dictum of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel who said: “They do not build monuments (i.e. tombstones) for the righteous. Their words, lo! They are their memorial!” Philosopher and Halachic decisor, Maimonides, likewise, ruled {{that it is not}} permissible to raise headstones over the graves of righteous men, but permits doing so for ordinary men. In contrast, the more recent custom of Spanish Jewry, following the teachings of the Ari z”l (Shaʿar Ha-Mitzvot, Parashat Vayeḥi), is to build tombstones over the grave, seeing it as part of the complete atonement and amendment for those who have died. Likewise, Rabbi Shelomo b. Avraham Aderet (RASHBA) wrote that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> showing honor to the dead. In this manner the custom did spread, especially among the Jews of Spain, North Africa and Ashkenaz. Today, in Israel, all Jewish graves are marked with headstones.|$|E
