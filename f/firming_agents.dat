In order to impart a proper firm texture to the meat cold blanching the skinless boneless meat in 15 % brine containing 0. 25 % calcium chloride was found necessary. Increasing the concentration of calcium chloride beyond 0. 25 % resulted in impairing the quality of meat, the texture becoming more fibrous and the flavour being adversely affected.

40|$|The {{need for}} {{increasing}} {{improvements in the}} quality of food products conducted to an increased interest in osmotic treatment. This technology involves the partial dehydration of a water-rich solid foodstuff, either whole or in pieces, through immersion in an osmotic solution. In fact, osmotic treatment is applied with the goal of modifying the composition of food material through partial water removal and impregnation of solutes, without affecting the structural integrity of products. Three kinds of osmotic treatments have been used, depending on the pressure applied on the system: OD (osmotic dehydration at atmospheric pressure), VOD (osmotic dehydration at vacuum pressure) and PVOD (pulsed vacuum osmotic dehydration). However, the most common are OD and VOD technologies. Some of the potential applications of osmotic treatment in food technology include: (i) the development of compositionally formulated products by introducing functional food ingredients, such as <b>firming</b> <b>agents,</b> antioxidants, antimicrobial and nutraceuticals; (ii) preserving color, texture, natural flavor and aroma and any heat-sensitive nutrient components; and (iii) pre-treatment before freeze-drying for improving final product quality. However, the osmotic treatment on this wide range of applications requires an appropriate choice and control of operating conditions, such as processing temperature, pressure, time, composition, geometry of the food pieces and contact between the food pieces and the solution. The purpose of this chapter is to analyze the main effects of operating conditions and responses of the porous fruits to osmotic treatment, both at atmospheric and vacuum pressure, and to describe the important developments related to this technology in the fruit industry. Quality aspects of osmotic treatments on processed fruits, as well as technical challenges of this technique will also be discussed...|$|E
40|$|Stabilization of mango slices (var. Arka anmol) in pre-cut {{form was}} {{achieved}} by using additive based minimal processing and modified atmosphere storage. The pre-treatments included use of <b>firming</b> <b>agents</b> {{in the form of}} calcium salt (1 %), antimicrobials such as benzoate and sorbate (0. 045 %), ascorbic acid as anti browning agent (0. 02 %), mild acidification (0. 4 % citric acid) and UV conditioning (2. 5 kJ m - 2). The pre-treated mango slices were subjected to different Modified Atmospheric (MA) conditions i. e., active with gas mixture flushing (4 % O 2 + 6 % CO 2 + 90 % N 2) in polythene pouches; passive MA with air in polythene pouches; passive MA in PET bottles with silicone membrane window (2. 25 cm 2) and passive MA in plastic trays, over wrapped with cling film. The pre-treated produce was also subjected to storage under controlled atmosphere (CA) in a continuous gas mixture flushing system (3 % O 2 + 8 % CO 2 + 89 % N 2) at 8 ± 1 °C. The pre-treated samples in combination with MAP or CA showed significant (p<= 0. 05) physical, physiological and microbiological stability in terms of respiratory drift without anaerobiosis and retention of ascorbic acid as well as carotenoids. The kinetic model for L, a, b colour coordinates and shear strength followed first order linear model during storage of the product at low temperature (8 ± 1 °C) with high correlation coefficients ranging from 0. 824 to 0. 987 and 0. 942 to 0. 993 for tristimulus colour and shear force values, respectively. Microbial safety was also ascertained in terms of SPC, Coliforms, yeast and molds during storage. Shelf life of 14 - 46 days was obtained for pre-treated mango slices stored in the MA/CA at 8 ± 1 °C. The control samples without pre-treatment kept under similar storage conditions showed restricted shelf life (8 - 12 days) at 8 ± 1 °C. The study highlights synergistic effect of physical conditioning in combination with additives based minimal processing and MA/CA storage conditions to give longer shelf life and suitability of the mango variety for minimal processing and MA/CA storage in pre-cut form...|$|E

In contrast, the principal designs compensation to enable cultures that exploit naive customers...|$|R

The results suggest that institutional monitoring is associated with valuation effects when both observable and unobservable aspects of the relationship between institutions and firms are taken into account.

Thus, other shareholders do not necessarily benefit from relationships between institutions and managers, and they could be hurt when the institutional <b>agents</b> watching <b>firm</b> <b>agents</b> have conflicts of interest with other shareholders...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} how individual agents affect house selling prices and {{time on the}} market while controlling for brokerage firm-specific effects as well as supply and demand conditions that vary by neighborhood. Firm size effects disappear once <b>firm</b> specialization and <b>agent</b> characteristics {{are taken into account}} but geographic concentration by firms leads to higher selling prices. For individual agents, neither sex nor selling own listings affects price or selling time, but there are gains from partnering transactions across <b>firms.</b> <b>Agents</b> who specialize in listing properties obtain higher prices for their sellers while those who specialize in selling obtain lower prices for their buyers. Houses nearer to other transactions of an agent sell for higher prices. Finally, greater scale of listing and selling activity by an agent tends to lower selling price or lengthen the time on the market.
