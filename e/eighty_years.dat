5|$|The {{traditional}} {{struggle with}} the See of Rome continued through the Macedonian period, spurred by the question of religious supremacy over the newly Christianised state of Bulgaria.

5|$|Article Two, {{initially}} {{ratified by}} seven states through 1792 (including Kentucky), was not ratified by another state for <b>eighty</b> <b>years.</b> The Ohio General Assembly ratified it on May 6, 1873 {{in protest of}} an unpopular Congressional pay raise. A century later, on March 6, 1978, the Wyoming Legislature also ratified the article. Gregory Watson, a University of Texas at Austin undergraduate student, started a new push for the article's ratification with a letter-writing campaign to state legislatures. As a result, by May 1992, enough states had approved Article Two (38 of the 50 states in the Union) for it to become the Twenty-seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution. The amendment's adoption was certified by Archivist of the United States Don W. Wilson and subsequently affirmed {{by a vote of}} Congress on May 20, 1992.|$|E

5|$|In a study {{published}} in December 2000, the star's diameter was measured with the Infrared Spatial Interferometer (ISI) at mid-infrared wavelengths producing a limb-darkened estimate of 55.2±0.5milliarcseconds (mas)—a figure entirely consistent with Michelson's findings <b>eighty</b> <b>years</b> earlier. At the time of its publication, the estimated parallax from the Hipparcos mission was 7.63 ± 1.64mas, yielding an estimated radius for Betelgeuse of 3.6AU. However, an infrared interferometric {{study published}} in 2009 announced that the star had shrunk by 15% since 1993 at an increasing rate without a significant diminution in magnitude. Subsequent observations suggest that the apparent contraction may be due to shell activity in the star's extended atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to a fire station, the building housed a police station, an ambulance station, a bank, a coroner's court, and a gas-meter testing station. The fire station operated for <b>eighty</b> <b>years,</b> housing the firemen, their families, and the horse-drawn appliances that were replaced by motorised vehicles {{a few years after}} its opening. It was visited by royalty in 1942, in recognition of the brigade's wartime efforts. After the war it became a training centre and in 1952 became the first centre equipped to record emergency calls. However, the fire station became expensive to maintain and after council reorganisation decline set in.|$|E

A case is presented of an <b>eighty</b> <b>year</b> old male who had complained {{of pain in}} the right shoulder of several days duration. History and clinical examination were consistent with mechanical joint pain. Following an appropriate course of conservative care the patient continued to improve until a re-injury occurred 3 months later. At that time, radiographs revealed an ill-defined moth-eaten lesion in the proximal humeral head. Subsequent evaluation demonstrated {{it to be a}} rare histologic sub-type of lymphoma.

5|$|The {{construction}} of the Manchester Ship Canal and the Manchester Docks {{led to the development}} of Trafford Park as the largest industrial estate in Europe, and brought employment to the area for the next <b>eighty</b> <b>years.</b> By the 1960s however, the UK had begun to lose its position as an industrial world power. By the mid-20th century, the UK cotton industry had gone into decline because of low-cost competition from Asian manufacturers. The decline of heavy industry in the area, the increasing size of freight-carrying ships, and competition from road transport, brought about the decline of the terminal docks at Salford, which closed in 1982.|$|E
5|$|Devika and Himanshu Rai {{returned}} to India, where Himanshu produced a film titled Karma (1933). The film {{was his first}} talkie, and like his previous films, it was a joint production between people from India, Germany and the United Kingdom. Rai, who played the lead role, decided to cast Devika Rani as the female lead, and this marked her acting debut. Karma is credited as having been the first English language talkie made by an Indian. It {{was one of the}} earliest Indian films to feature a kissing scene. The kissing scene, involving Himanshu Rai and Devika Rani, lasted for about four minutes, and <b>eighty</b> <b>years</b> later, this stands as the record for duration of a kissing scene in Indian cinema as of 2014. Devika Rani also sang a song in the film, a bi-lingual song in English and Hindi. This song is said to be Bollywood's first English song.|$|E
5|$|Slavery {{did not end}} in New York State until July 4, 1827, and, {{like many}} men of his day, Stanton's father was a slaveowner. Peter Teabout, a slave in the Cady {{household}} who was later freed in Johnstown, took care of Stanton and her sister Margaret. While she {{makes no mention of}} Teabout's position as a slave in her family's household, he is remembered with particular fondness by Stanton in her memoir, <b>Eighty</b> <b>Years</b> & More. Among other things, she reminisces about the pleasure she took in attending the Episcopal church with Teabout, where she and her sisters enjoyed sitting with him {{in the back of the}} church rather than alone in front with the white families of the congregation. It seems it was, however, not immediately the fact that her family owned at least one slave, but her exposure to the abolition movement as a young woman visiting her cousin, Gerrit Smith, in Peterboro, New York, that led to her staunch abolitionist sentiments.|$|E

5|$|Amazing was published, {{with some}} interruptions, for almost <b>eighty</b> <b>years,</b> {{going through a}} half-dozen owners and many editors as it {{struggled}} to be profitable. Gernsback was forced into bankruptcy and {{lost control of the}} magazine in 1929, and by 1938 it was purchased by Ziff-Davis, who hired Raymond A. Palmer as editor. Palmer made the magazine successful though it was not regarded as a quality magazine within the science fiction community. In the late 1940s Amazing presented as fact stories about the Shaver Mystery, a lurid mythos that explained accidents and disaster as the work of robots named deros, which led to dramatically increased circulation but widespread ridicule. Amazing switched to a digest size format in 1953, shortly {{before the end of the}} pulp-magazine era. It was sold to Sol Cohen's Universal Publishing Company in 1965, which filled it with reprinted stories but did not pay a reprint fee to the authors, creating a conflict with the newly formed Science Fiction Writers of America. Ted White took over as editor in 1969, eliminated the reprints and made the magazine respected again: Amazing was nominated for the prestigious Hugo award three times during his tenure in the 1970s. Several other owners attempted to create a modern incarnation of the magazine in the following decades, but publication was suspended after the March 2005 issue. A new incarnation appeared in July 2012 as an online magazine.|$|E
5|$|With the {{publication}} of his Principia roughly <b>eighty</b> <b>years</b> later (1687), Isaac Newton provided a physical theory that accounted for all three of Kepler's laws, a theory based on Newton's laws of motion and his law of universal gravitation. In particular, Newton proposed that the gravitational force between any two bodies was a central force F(r) that varied as the inverse square of the distance r between them. Arguing from his laws of motion, Newton showed that the orbit of any particle acted upon by one such force is always a conic section, specifically an ellipse if it does not go to infinity. However, this conclusion holds only when two bodies are present (the two-body problem); the motion of three bodies or more acting under their mutual gravitation (the n-body problem) remained unsolved for centuries after Newton, although solutions to a few special cases were discovered. Newton proposed that the orbits of planets about the Sun are largely elliptical because the Sun's gravitation is dominant; to first approximation, the presence of the other planets can be ignored. By analogy, the elliptical orbit of the Moon about the Earth was dominated by the Earth's gravity; to first approximation, the Sun's gravity and those of other bodies of the Solar System can be neglected. However, Newton stated that the gradual apsidal precession of the planetary and lunar orbits was due to the effects of these neglected interactions; in particular, he stated that the precession of the Moon's orbit was due to the perturbing effects of gravitational interactions with the Sun.|$|E
