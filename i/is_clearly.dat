5|$|A Polish Nobleman is a 1637 {{painting}} by Rembrandt depicting {{a man in}} a costume of either Polish szlachta or boyar nobility. The identity of the subject of the painting is unclear, and has given rise to several different interpretations. The view that the figure's dress <b>is</b> <b>clearly</b> Polish is not universally held and {{it may have been a}} self-portrait.|$|E
5|$|As the {{pregnancy}} progresses, Juno {{struggles with the}} emotions she feels for the baby's father, Paulie, who <b>is</b> <b>clearly</b> in love with Juno. Juno maintains an outwardly indifferent attitude toward Paulie, but when she learns he has asked another girl to the upcoming prom, she angrily confronts him. Paulie reminds Juno that it is at her request they remain distant and tells her that she broke his heart.|$|E
5|$|Characteristics of {{the tail}} {{vertebrae}} {{and the presence of}} osteoderms indicate that Ampelosaurus belongs to Lithostrotia, a group of derived titanosaurians which also includes Alamosaurus and Saltasaurus. Many other paleotologists have classified Ampelosaurus as belonging to Titanosauria, Saltasauridae, and Titanosauridae. Ampelosaurus may have an uncertain classification, but it <b>is</b> <b>clearly</b> a titanosaur, with many features found in titanosaurs.|$|E
50|$|These SDOH <b>are</b> <b>clearly</b> {{related to}} health outcomes, are {{closely tied to}} public policy, and <b>are</b> <b>clearly</b> {{understandable}} by the public. They tend to cluster together - for example, those living in poverty also experience numerous other adverse social determinants. The quality and equitable distribution of these social determinants in Canada and the USA <b>are</b> <b>clearly</b> well below the standards seen in other developed nations.|$|R

5000|$|Texture {{gradient}} : Fine {{details on}} nearby objects can <b>be</b> seen <b>clearly,</b> whereas such details are not visible on faraway objects. Texture gradients are grains of an item. For example, {{on a long}} gravel road, the gravel near the observer can <b>be</b> <b>clearly</b> seen of shape, size and colour. In the distance, the road's texture cannot <b>be</b> <b>clearly</b> differentiated.|$|R
5|$|Gymnopils maritimus <b>is</b> <b>clearly</b> a {{different}} species from {{other members of}} its clade, despite their close relation. All other species in the clade grow upon dead wood and have well-developed rings on their stems. The spores also differ; {{in the case of}} G.junonius and G.spectabilis (often considered synonymous), as well as G.pampeanus, they are narrower, {{and in the case of}} G.imperialis, they are wider. Of the other members of the clade, only G.junonius and G.spectabilis also grow in Europe.|$|E
5|$|Imelda Staunton voiced the Tall Flower Faces. Though {{there are}} many flowers that appear around Underland, {{only one of them}} speaks and one of them <b>is</b> <b>clearly</b> a {{caricature}} of Staunton. Staunton only speaks three lines that are heard very briefly {{at the beginning of the}} film.|$|E
5|$|The diamond allotrope {{of carbon}} <b>is</b> <b>clearly</b> nonmetallic, being {{translucent}} {{and having a}} low electrical conductivity of 10−14 to 10−16S·cm−1. Graphite has an electrical conductivity of 3 × 104S·cm−1, a figure more characteristic of a metal. Phosphorus, sulfur, arsenic, selenium, antimony and bismuth also have less stable allotropes that display different behaviours.|$|E
50|$|By {{applying}} the Coase Theorem two possible solutions arise for internalizing this externality. These solutions can occur because the positive external benefits <b>are</b> <b>clearly</b> identified and {{we assume that}} 1) transaction costs are low; 2) property rights <b>are</b> <b>clearly</b> defined.|$|R

5|$|The floury {{baker is}} {{distinguished}} {{from a similar}} undescribed species A. sp. nr curvicosta (the little floury baker) by {{the structure of the}} male genitalia and an audibly distinct call. Members of Aleeta and Tryella are easily distinguished from other Australian cicadas as they lack tymbal covers, while the costal margin of their forewings gets larger toward the point where the wing is attached to the body. In these genera it <b>is</b> <b>clearly</b> wider than the costal vein.|$|E
5|$|The known {{expansion}} {{rate of the}} Homunculus Nebula provides an unusual geometric method for measuring its distance. Assuming that the two lobes of the nebula are symmetrical, the projection of the nebula onto the sky depends on its distance. Values of 2,300, 2,250 and 2,300parsecs have been derived for the Homunculus, and Eta Carinae <b>is</b> <b>clearly</b> at the same distance.|$|E
5|$|When {{early in}} the film {{newspaper}} clippings {{from around the globe}} are shown, in the Japanese newspaper the iconic silhouette of Godzilla <b>is</b> <b>clearly</b> visible. Similarly, during the New York sequence when Sky Captain deploys a bomb to stop a giant robot, the shape of King Kong can be seen on the Empire State Building in the background.|$|E

5|$|While {{the core}} was under construction, a {{corridor}} was left open {{leading into the}} shaft where the grave chamber was built separately and later covered by leftover stone blocks and debris. This construction strategy <b>is</b> <b>clearly</b> visible in later unfinished pyramids, in particular the Pyramid of Neferefre. This technique also reflects the older style from the 3rd Dynasty seemingly coming back into fashion after being temporarily abandoned by the builders of the five great pyramids at Dahshur and Giza during the 4th Dynasty.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{alterations}} are {{visible to the}} naked eye as pentimenti. A piece of paper draped over the edge of the table <b>is</b> <b>clearly</b> visible in outline, despite having been painted over with detailing of the table itself. Sigismunda's index finger which was bent towards and perhaps touching the heart has been straightened, but the outline of the tip is still visible on the surface of the heart. A looped cord in the top right-hand corner is poorly concealed under the topmost layer of paint. It is also known that, to attempt to appease critics, Hogarth repainted the fingers of Sigismunda so that the blood that was previously there would no longer be visible.|$|E
5|$|Assuming for the {{purposes}} of argument, however, that evolution is a religion or religious tenet, the remedy is to stop the teaching of evolution, not establish another religion in opposition to it. Yet it <b>is</b> <b>clearly</b> established in the case law, and perhaps also in common sense, that evolution is not a religion and that teaching evolution does not violate the Establishment Clause, Epperson v. Arkansas, supra, Willoughby v. Stever, No. 15574-75 (D.D.C. May 18, 1973); aff'd. 504 F.2d 271 (D.C. Cir. 1974), cert. denied , 420 U.S. 924 (1975); Wright v. Houston Indep. School Dist., 366 F.

5|$|Carabane {{has many}} {{historic}} sites, {{such as the}} Catholic mission house built in 1880 which has since {{been turned into a}} hotel, a Brittany-style church building which is no longer in use, and a former slave-trade building. There is also a French cemetery where a Troupes de marine-Captain with the name Aristide Protet was shot with a poisoned arrow and buried standing {{up in front of the}} sea, according to his last wishes. Some tour guides falsely claim that this was Auguste Léopold Protet, the founder of the city of Dakar, but the name Aristide Protet <b>is</b> <b>clearly</b> shown on the tomb's plaque.|$|E
5|$|Carvings in the Decorated Gothic style may {{be found}} in the eastern end of the buildings, where there are many carved bosses. In the chapter house, the carvings of the fifty-one stalls include {{numerous}} small heads of great variety, many of them smiling or laughing. A well-known figure is the corbel of the dragon-slaying monk in the chapter house stair. The large continuous capital that encircles the central pillar of the chapter house is markedly different in style to the stiff-leaf of the Early English period. In contrast to the bold projections and undercutting of the earlier work, it has a rippling form and <b>is</b> <b>clearly</b> identifiable as grapevine.|$|E
5|$|Eta Carinae {{is a close}} binary {{and this}} complicates the {{evolution}} of both stars. Compact massive companions can strip mass from larger primary stars {{much more quickly than}} would occur in a single star, so the properties at core collapse can be very different. In some scenarios, the secondary can accrue significant mass, accelerating its evolution, and in turn be stripped by the now compact Wolf–Rayet primary. In the case of Eta Carinae, the secondary <b>is</b> <b>clearly</b> causing additional instability in the primary, making it difficult to predict future developments.|$|E

Twin runways <b>are</b> <b>clearly</b> visible, along with the round perimeter track and many dispersal hardstands. Parking ramps <b>are</b> <b>clearly</b> in evidence, along with the remains of the bomb/storage/supply dump and the remains of buildings in the technical site away from the airfield. Many connecting streets are visible in aerial imagery, however all of the above <b>are</b> <b>clearly</b> worn and decayed by the desert sands.|$|R
5|$|Etty did not base The Combat on {{any single}} {{incident}} from history or literature, or on any existing artwork, {{but on his}} own imagination; this was a highly unusual step to take regarding history paintings, which generally depicted themes from literature or religion. He had been considering the topic as early as 1821, and his plans took shape following his visit to Italy. During this visit Etty had met Antonio Canova and been very impressed by him; The Combat <b>is</b> <b>clearly</b> influenced by his work. As well as drawing inspiration from classical sculpture, he was also strongly influenced by the composition of Old Master works he had seen while in Italy. As with many of Etty's works, the models posed for him separately in his studio, {{rather than as a}} group.|$|E
5|$|From there, the Arabs turned west towards Nicaea, {{the chief}} city of Bithynia and {{capital of the}} {{powerful}} Opsician Theme. The Arabs arrived before the city in late July, with al-Battal's vanguard preceding the main army. The Byzantines, probably {{under the command of}} the Count of the Opsicians, Artabasdos, did not meet them in the field, but instead retreated behind the city's walls. The Arabs assaulted the city for forty days, employing siege engines which destroyed a part of the walls, but eventually failed to take it. In late August, they raised the siege and departed, taking along many captives and much booty. The 12th-century chronicle of Michael the Syrian claims that the city's inhabitants abandoned it and fled by ship through Lake Ascania, whereupon the Arabs destroyed Nicaea, but this <b>is</b> <b>clearly</b> an error.|$|E
5|$|Il ritorno, says Carter, <b>is</b> <b>clearly</b> {{influenced}} by Monteverdi's earlier works. Penelope's lament in Act I is close in character to the lament from L'Arianna, while the martial episodes recall Il combattimento. Stile concitato is {{prominent in the}} fight scenes and in the slaying of Penelope's suitors. In L'incoronazione, Monteverdi represents moods and situations by specific musical devices: triple metre stands for the language of love; arpeggios demonstrate conflict; stile concitato represents rage. There is continuing debate about {{how much of the}} extant L'incoronazione music is Monteverdi's original, and how much is the work of others (there are, for instance, traces of music by Francesco Cavalli).|$|E
