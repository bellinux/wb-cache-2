25|$|A {{group of}} neurons can also {{generate}} oscillatory activity. Through synaptic interactions the firing patterns of different neurons may become synchronized and the rhythmic changes in electric potential caused by their action potentials will add up (constructive interference). That is, synchronized firing patterns result in synchronized input into other cortical areas, which {{gives rise to}} large-amplitude oscillations of the local field potential. These large-scale oscillations can also be measured outside the scalp using electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG). The <b>electric</b> <b>potentials</b> generated by single neurons are far {{too small to be}} picked up outside the scalp, and EEG or MEG activity always reflects the summation of the synchronous activity of thousands or millions of neurons that have similar spatial orientation. Neurons in a neural ensemble rarely all fire at exactly the same moment, i.e. fully synchronized. Instead, the probability of firing is rhythmically modulated such that neurons are more likely to fire at the same time, which gives rise to oscillations in their mean activity (see figure at top of page). As such, the frequency of large-scale oscillations does not need to match the firing pattern of individual neurons. Isolated cortical neurons fire regularly under certain conditions, but in the intact brain cortical cells are bombarded by highly fluctuating synaptic inputs and typically fire seemingly at random. However, if the probability of a large group of neurons is rhythmically modulated at a common frequency, they will generate oscillations in the mean field (see also figure at top of page). Neural ensembles can generate oscillatory activity endogenously through local interactions between excitatory and inhibitory neurons. In particular, inhibitory interneurons {{play an important role in}} producing neural ensemble synchrony by generating a narrow window for effective excitation and rhythmically modulating the firing rate of excitatory neurons.|$|E
500|$|Since plasmas {{are very}} good {{electrical}} conductors, <b>electric</b> <b>potentials</b> play an important role. The potential as it exists on average {{in the space between}} charged particles, independent of the question of how it can be measured, is called the [...] "plasma potential", or the [...] "space potential". If an electrode is inserted into a plasma, its potential will generally lie considerably below the plasma potential due to what is termed a Debye sheath. The good electrical conductivity of plasmas makes their electric fields very small. This results in the important concept of [...] "quasineutrality", which says the density of negative charges is approximately equal to the density of positive charges over large volumes of the plasma (...) , but on the scale of the Debye length there can be charge imbalance. In the special case that double layers are formed, the charge separation can extend some tens of Debye lengths.|$|E

2500|$|One early theory {{proposed}} for the acceleration of auroral electrons {{is based on an}} assumed static, or quasi-static, electric field creating a uni-directional potential drop. No mention is provided of either the necessary space-charge or equi-potential distribution, and these remain to be specified for the notion of acceleration by double layers to be credible. Fundamentally, Poisson's equation indicates {{that there can be no}} configuration of charge resulting in a net potential drop. [...] Inexplicably though, some authors still invoke quasi-static parallel electric fields as net accelerators of auroral electrons, citing interpretations of transient observations of fields and particles as supporting this theory as firm fact. [...] In another example, there is little justification given for saying 'FAST observations demonstrate detailed quantitative agreement between the measured <b>electric</b> <b>potentials</b> and the ion beam energies...., leaving no doubt that parallel potential drops are a dominant source of auroral particle acceleration'.|$|E
2500|$|Although action {{potentials}} {{are generated}} locally on patches of excitable membrane, the resulting currents can trigger action potentials on neighboring stretches of membrane, precipitating a domino-like propagation. [...] In contrast to passive spread of <b>electric</b> <b>potentials</b> (electrotonic potential), action potentials are generated anew along excitable stretches of membrane and [...] propagate without decay. Myelinated sections of axons are not excitable {{and do not}} produce action potentials and the signal is propagated passively as electrotonic potential. [...] Regularly spaced unmyelinated patches, called the nodes of Ranvier, generate action potentials to boost the signal. [...] Known as saltatory conduction, this type of signal propagation provides a favorable tradeoff of signal velocity and axon diameter. [...] Depolarization of axon terminals, in general, triggers the release of neurotransmitter into the synaptic cleft. In addition, backpropagating action potentials have been recorded in the dendrites of pyramidal neurons, which are ubiquitous in the neocortex. These {{are thought to have}} a role in spike-timing-dependent plasticity.|$|E

The active method uses the <b>electric</b> <b>potential</b> distribution observed {{on the surface}} of the body under electric current application to identify the cracks and defects. The inverse analysis methods were constructed based on comparison between the measured <b>electric</b> <b>potential</b> and that calculated using the boundary element method. The passive <b>electric</b> <b>potential</b> CT method, which does not require the application of the electric current, can be constructed by gluing piezoelectric film {{on the surface of}} a cracked structure subjected to mechanical load.
