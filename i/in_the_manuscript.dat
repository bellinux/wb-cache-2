5|$|After a lacuna <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>manuscript</b> of the poem, Hymiskviða {{abruptly}} {{picks up}} again with Thor and Hymir in a boat, out at sea. Hymir catches a few whales at once, and Thor baits his {{line with the}} head of the ox. Thor casts his line and the monstrous serpent Jörmungandr bites. Thor pulls the serpent on board, and violently slams him in the head with his hammer. Jörmungandr shrieks, and a noisy commotion is heard from underwater before another lacuna appears <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>manuscript.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the novel, {{the protagonist}} {{and a female}} {{accomplice}} rent a home like the one Cox and Hauck rented in Atlanta. The character then opens accounts at several banks in the area {{so that he can}} use them for money laundering purposes, which Cox did. Then, Cox, like the character <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>manuscript,</b> forged a document, claiming that the mortgage on the home—which he did not even own—was paid off. The character <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>manuscript</b> then contacted lenders, and told them he owned the property outright. Cox is in prison for this same crime.|$|E

5|$|A {{trend towards}} greater {{authenticity}} began after Hammond's orchestrations in the 1970s provided {{a basis for}} staging the work in its original form. This process was further aided by the discovery in the 1990s of Bizet's 1863 conducting score. In this, the orchestral parts were reduced to six staves, but notes and other markings <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>manuscript</b> provided additional clues to the original orchestration. These new finds {{became the basis for}} Brad Cohen's critical edition of the score, published by Edition Peters in 2002.|$|E

5|$|Ralph wrote {{a sermon}} for {{the feast of}} the Assumption of the Virgin and it survives in some fifty Latin manuscripts, {{probably}} because it was thought to have been written by Anselm of Canterbury, until shown to be Ralph's in 1927. A surviving English translation of the sermon is also preserved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>manuscript</b> British Library, Cotton Vespasian D. xiv. The Latin version, which Ralph was a translation of his originally spoken French version, has been edited and published in 1997. Ralph also had the monks of Christ Church, Canterbury search for documents relating to the privileges of Canterbury and had those documents copied into a manuscript which still survives, BM MS Cotton Cleopatra E. His seal {{is one of the first}} to take the usual form for bishop's seals, with Ralph standing, in full vestments including a mitre, and performing a benediction with his right hand while holding his crosier in his left. The seal took the form of a pointed oval.|$|E
5|$|The {{only other}} 11th-century {{cartulary}} surviving from England is the Oswald cartulary, also compiled at Worcester. Historian M. T. Clanchy {{has suggested that}} the form English cartularies took may have originated at Worcester, although fellow historian Robin Fleming has argued that Christ Church Canterbury's surviving cartulary is also an 11th-century compilation. Who owned the manuscript after it left Worcester Cathedral Priory, presumably with the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the 1540s, is unknown, but the manuscript was in the possession of Robert Cotton by 1612, when it is recorded as being loaned by Cotton to Arthur Agarde. There are annotations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>manuscript</b> by John Joscelyn, who was secretary to Matthew Parker (d. 1575), the Elizabethan Archbishop of Canterbury, but whether Parker owned the manuscript is uncertain. The manuscript thus became part of the Cotton library, which passed into public ownership in 1702 on the death of Cotton's grandson on the basis of an act of Parliament of 1701. The manuscript itself is now part of the British Library's holdings.|$|E

5|$|Hemming was {{the author}} of the second and later part, a {{collection}} of lands and rights belonging to the cathedral chapter of Worcester, as well as a narrative of the deeds of Wulfstan, the Bishop of Worcester who died in 1095, and Archbishop Ealdred of York. In this part of the work is a preface known as the Enucleatio libelli, where Hemming names himself as the person responsible for compiling the work, and names Wulfstan as the inspiration for his work. Another section, known as the Prefatio istius libelli, now much later <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>manuscript</b> but possibly meant as an introduction to the Codicellus, is a shorter introduction that gives the purpose of the collection. Historians usually take the two prefaces to mean that Wulfstan commissioned the work, but it is unclear whether it was created before or after Wulfstan's death. It may have been produced during the vacancy after Wulfstan's death, and before the appointment of the next bishop, Samson. Historian Nicholas Brooks, along with Vivian Galbraith, argues that Hemming's work was a response to the problems encountered by the diocese during the vacancy, when royal officials administered the lands of the bishopric. According to Brooks, the claim that Wulfstan ordered the composition of the cartulary was inaccurate, and was made to appeal to the authority of the bishop. The historian Julia Barrow believes that the inspiration for the work was the creation of the Domesday Book in 1086, although she agrees that the work was completed after Wulfstan's death. Hemming's work contains over 50charters, some of which are duplicates of ones in the Liber.|$|E
25|$|The {{two most}} {{remarkable}} and accomplished poems <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>manuscript</b> are both long exercises in a late form of alliterative verse with a superimposed rhyme-scheme: Pater Noster and The Three Dead Kings.

25|$|The Qutb Shahi rulers invited many Persian {{artists like}} Shaykh Abbasi and Muhammad Zaman in their court, which left a {{profound}} impact of different phases of Iranian art on the miniature paintings of this period. The earliest miniature paintings like the 126 illustrations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>manuscript</b> of Anwar-i-Suhayli (c. 1550–1560) in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London and the illustrations in Sindbad Namah in the India Office Library, London and Shirin and Khusrau in the Khudabaksh Library, Patna most probably belong to the period of reign of Ibrahim Quli Qutb Shah. First 6 of the total 8 illustrations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>manuscript</b> of Kulliyat-i-Mohammad Quli Qutb Shah (c. 1590–1600) in Salar Jung Museum, Hyderabad are masterpieces. The 5 illustrations in a manuscript of the Diwan-i-Hafiz (c.1630) in the British Museum, London belonged to the period of reign of Abdullah Qutb Shah. The most outstanding surviving Golkonda painting probably is the Procession of Sultan Abdullah Qutb Shah riding an elephant (c. 1650) in Saltykov-Shtshedrine State Public Library, St. Petersberg.|$|E
