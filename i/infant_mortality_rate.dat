40|$|Background <b>Infant</b> <b>mortality</b> <b>rates</b> in the US exceed {{those in}} all other {{developed}} countries and in many less developed countries, suggesting political factors may contribute. Methods Annual time series on overall, White and Black <b>infant</b> <b>mortality</b> <b>rates</b> in the US were analysed over the 1965 – 2010 time period to ascertain whether <b>infant</b> <b>mortality</b> <b>rates</b> varied across presidential administrations. Data were de-trended using cubic splines and ana-lysed using both graphical and time series regression methods. Results Across all nine presidential administrations, <b>infant</b> <b>mortality</b> <b>rates</b> were below trend when the President was a Democrat and above trend when the President was a Republican. This was true for over-all, neonatal and postneonatal mortality. Regression estimates show that, relative to trend, Republican administrations were character-ized by <b>infant</b> <b>mortality</b> <b>rates</b> that were, on average, 3 % higher than Democratic administrations. In proportional terms, effect size is similar for US Whites and Blacks. US Black rates are {{more than twice as}} high as White, implying substantially larger absolute ef-fects for Blacks. Conclusions We found a robust, quantitatively important association between net of trend US <b>infant</b> <b>mortality</b> <b>rates</b> and the party affiliation of the president. There may be overlooked ways by which macro-dynamics of policy impact microdynamics of physiology, suggesting the political system is a component of the underlying mechanism generating health inequality in the USA...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Although {{national}} health insurance plans and social programs introduced in the 1960 s led to reductions in regional disparities in <b>infant</b> <b>mortality</b> in Canada, it is unclear if such patterns prevailed in the 1990 s when the health care and related systems were under fiscal duress. This study examined regional patterns of change in <b>infant</b> <b>mortality</b> in Canada in recent decades. Methods We analysed regional changes in crude <b>infant</b> <b>mortality</b> <b>rates</b> and in <b>infant</b> <b>mortality</b> <b>rates</b> among live births with a birth weight ≥ 500 g and ≥ 1, 000 g in Canada from 1945 to 2002. Associations between baseline <b>infant</b> <b>mortality</b> <b>rates</b> in the provinces and territories (e. g., in 1985 – 89) and the change observed in <b>infant</b> <b>mortality</b> <b>rates</b> over the subsequent period (e. g., between 1985 – 89 and 1995 – 99) were assessed using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. Trends in regional disparities were also assessed by calculating period-specific rate ratios between provinces/territories with the highest versus the lowest <b>infant</b> <b>mortality.</b> Results Provincial/territorial <b>infant</b> <b>mortality</b> <b>rates</b> in 1945 – 49 {{were not correlated with}} changes in <b>infant</b> <b>mortality</b> over the next 10 years (rho = 0. 01, P = 0. 99). However, there was a strong negative correlation between <b>infant</b> <b>mortality</b> <b>rates</b> in 1965 – 69 and the subsequent decline in <b>infant</b> <b>mortality</b> (rho = - 0. 85, P = 0. 002). Provinces/territories with higher <b>infant</b> <b>mortality</b> <b>rates</b> in 1965 – 69 (Northwest Territories 64. 7 vs British Columbia 20. 7 per 1, 000 live births) experienced relatively larger reductions in <b>infant</b> <b>mortality</b> between 1965 – 69 and 1975 – 79 (53. 7 % decline in the Northwest Territories vs a 36. 6 % decline in British Columbia). This pattern was reversed in the more recent decades. Provinces/territories with higher <b>infant</b> <b>mortality</b> <b>rates</b> ≥ 500 g in 1985 – 89 experience relatively smaller reductions in <b>infant</b> <b>mortality</b> between 1985 – 89 and 2000 – 02 (rho = 0. 82, P = 0. 004). The <b>infant</b> <b>mortality</b> ≥ 500 g rate ratio (contrasting the province/territory with the highest versus lowest <b>infant</b> <b>mortality)</b> was 3. 2 in 1965 – 69, 2. 4 in 1975 – 79, 2. 2 in 1985 – 89, 3. 1 in 1995 – 99 and 4. 1 in 2000 – 02.

The Malagasy fertility rate in 2009 was 4.6children per woman, declining from 6.3 in 1990. Teen pregnancy rates of 14.8percent in 2011, much higher than the African average, are a contributing factor to rapid population growth. In 2010 the maternal mortality rate was 440 per 100,000 births, compared to 373.1 in 2008 and 484.4 in 1990, indicating a decline in perinatal care following the 2009 coup.

The health care infrastructure {{is divided into three}} tiers– the primary health care network, a secondary care system comprising district and sub-divisional hospitals and tertiary hospitals providing speciality and super speciality care. As of 2010–11, there are 17 hospitals, 11 rural hospitals and community health centres, 79 primary health centres, 635 sub-centres/dispensaries, 7 blood banks and 7 blood storage centres in the state. Homeopathic and Ayurvedic styles of medicine are also popular in the state. The National Family Health Survey– 3 conducted in 2005–06 revealed that 20 per cent of the residents of Tripura do not generally use government health facilities, and prefers private medical sector. This is overwhelmingly less compared to the national level, where 65.6 per cent do not rely on government facilities. As in the rest of India, Tripura residents also cite poor quality of care as the most frequent reason for non-reliance over public health sector. Other reasons include distance of the public sector facility, long waiting time, and inconvenient hours of operation. As of 2010, the state's performance in major public health care indices, such as birth rate, <b>infant</b> <b>mortality</b> <b>rate</b> and total fertility rate is better than the national average.
