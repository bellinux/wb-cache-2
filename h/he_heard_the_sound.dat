5|$|Earlier in {{the morning}} Dupont had {{proceeded}} with his column south and east along the river, from Marbach, according to instructions. Even {{before the arrival of}} Mortier's courier, <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of artillery in the distance and sent riders ahead to discover the cause. They came back to report that a Russian column (Dokhturov's) was descending from the mountains to take the road to Dürenstein. Realizing this would separate him from the forward division, Dupont hustled his troops toward the sound of battle and deployed them to take the Russians in the flank. The French assault, heralded by cannon fire, caused Dokhturov's troops to turn their attention from Gazan's beleaguered force to face these new assailants. Although superior in numbers, Dokhturov's column had no supporting artillery, and the narrow space prevented them from taking advantage of their size. It was Dokhturov's turn to face attackers at his front and rear, until the arrival of Schmitt's column, which wended its way through the mountains in the west.|$|E
25|$|Murray met no {{resistance}} at Whalers Gate, {{but as he}} approached Waireka <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of rapid firing towards the coast. He entrenched his men and opened fire on the Kaipopo pā with a rocket tube. The gunfire Murray heard was being exchanged between about 200 Māori warriors—who, armed mostly with double-barrel shotguns and some rifles, were firing from the cover of bush and flax in the river gully—and the militia and Volunteers, who had retreated {{to the safety of}} the farmhouse of settler John Jury. Most of the battle took place on the flat farm land below the pa.|$|E
25|$|Infuriated {{that his}} orders were being defied and a golden {{opportunity}} was being lost, Bragg issued new orders for Hindman to attack early September 11. Cleburne, who was not sick as Hill had claimed, cleared the felled timber from Dug Gap and prepared to advance when <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of Hindman's guns. By this time, however, Baird's division had reached Negley's, and Negley had withdrawn his division to a defensive position {{just east of the}} crossroads. The two Union divisions then withdrew to Stevens Gap. Hindman's men skirmished with Baird's rear guard, but could not prevent the withdrawal of the Union force.|$|E

60|$|It was {{not until}} <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> of {{preparation}} for departure that he left the skeleton's tent, and then, with Mr. Stubbs clasped tightly to his breast, he hurried over to the wagon where Old Ben was nearly ready to start.|$|R
60|$|For answer, Umslopogaas {{took her}} by the hand and fled towards the river; but before he reached it <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> of <b>the</b> fray, the war-cry of the Slayers as they poured upon the People of the Axe, the howl of his brother, the Wolf, when the battle joined--ay, and the crash of the Watcher as the blow went home.|$|R
25|$|The next morning, either June 17 or 18, {{the band}} of about 30 Native Americans {{returned}} to their hidden positions and awaited the settlers. When the settlers awoke, Brigham and Phillips went onto the porch of Ament's cabin where they conversed for a few minutes, failing to notice the moccasin tracks around the property. Phillips {{decided to go to}} his cabin, about a half mile (.8km) from Ament's property, to finish a letter to his parents. Brigham, intending to accompany Phillips, entered his cabin for a moment, and once inside <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of musket fire outside. Phillips, mortally wounded, fell to the ground, struck by two musket balls. The band of raiding Native Americans immediately descended upon him with their tomahawks.|$|E
25|$|The en echelon attack {{continued}} with Anderson's {{division in the}} center. At about 2:45p.m., {{the same time that}} Maney's first attack was being repulsed on the Open Knob, the brigade of Col. Thomas M. Jones began its attack across a valley commanded by a large sinkhole. Jones had no orders to attack from Anderson or Hardee, but moved forward on his own initiative when <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of firing to his right. As they entered the valley, his men were cut down by musketry and fire from twelve artillery pieces on the next ridge, where the Union 9th Brigade (Rousseau's division) under Col. Leonard A. Harris was posted. Confederate artillery attached to Jones's brigade, Capt. Charles Lumsden's Alabama Light Artillery, returned fire, but due to an optical illusion that made two successive ridges look the same, were unable to fix on the appropriate range and their fire had no effect on the Federal line. At 3:30p.m., the Confederate brigade of Brig. Gen. John C. Brown moved up {{to take the place of}} Jones's retreating men. By this time, most of the Union artillery had had to withdraw to replenish their ammunition, so Brown's men did not suffer the same fate as Jones's. Nevertheless, they made no headway against the infantry units in place until successes on the Confederate left put pressure on the Union position.|$|E
500|$|Grant {{was about}} [...] downriver at Savannah, Tennessee, when <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of {{artillery}} fire. (On April 4, {{he had been}} injured when his horse fell and pinned him underneath. He was convalescing and unable to move without crutches.) Before leaving Savannah, Grant ordered Bull Nelson's division to march along {{the east side of}} the river, to a point opposite Pittsburg Landing, where it could be ferried over to the battlefield. Grant then took his steamboat, Tigress, to Crump's Landing, where he gave Lew Wallace his first orders, which were to wait in reserve and be ready to move. Grant proceeded to Pittsburg Landing, arriving about 8:30a.m.; most of the day went by before the first of these reinforcements arrived. (Nelson's division arrived around 5p.m.; Wallace's appeared about 7p.m.) Wallace's slow movement to the battlefield would become particularly controversial.|$|E
60|$|Everything {{seemed so}} different, so unreal. There seemed {{no reason why}} people should go along the street, and houses pile up in the daylight. There seemed no reason why these things should occupy the space, instead of leaving it empty. His friends talked to him: <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds,</b> and <b>he</b> answered. But why there should be the noise of speech he could not understand.|$|R

500|$|By December 1941, Finn was {{stationed}} at Naval Air Station Kaneohe Bay {{on the island}} of Oahu in Hawaii. As a chief aviation ordnanceman, {{he was in charge of}} twenty men whose primary task was to maintain the weapons of VP-11, a PBY Catalina flying boat squadron. At 7:48a.m. on the morning of Sunday, 7 December 1941, Finn was at his home, about a mile from the aircraft hangars, when <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of gunfire. Finn recalled how a neighbor was the first to alert him, when she knocked on his door saying, [...] "They want you down at the squadron right away!" [...] He drove to the hangars, catching sight of Japanese planes in the sky on the way, and found that the airbase was being attacked, with most of the PBYs already on fire.|$|E
500|$|Lamb {{described}} the incident for Dolan in far more detail. He {{said that on}} 25 June he had finished his woodworking job at 15:00, refused to work overtime (having put in 62 hours that week), then drunk six beers at home during the afternoon and gone to sleep at 21:00. He woke up soon after, he said, and loaded his uncle's shotgun, intending to kill himself. [...] "Next thing I knew," [...] he continued, [...] "I was on the street." [...] He told Dolan {{that he had seen}} people [...] "as if they were on television". <b>He</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of a gun being fired as if it were coming from far away, and remembered a voice that was not his own saying [...] "Put up your hands". He then remembered hearing the dim, far-off gun again, a vision of a terrified man standing before him, then yet another shot. He told Dolan he remembered crossing the street, seeing a girl's outline in a doorway and [...] "somehow" [...] shooting at her. Lamb then said he had fired at a passing car, and that [...] "everything seemed unreal." [...] He said that the next thing he had memory of was confronting an elderly lady at a house nearby, suddenly thinking [...] "what the hell am I in here for" [...] and leaving. He concluded his account by saying that he had hailed a cab from the corner of Pillette and Tecumseh Road and gone back to his uncle's house.|$|E
500|$|Gen. Grey {{had been}} {{instructed}} not to attack until <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of firing from Howe's column, but after several hours, he became impatient {{and decided to}} proceed on his own. [...] He formed his column into three divisions, with the Queen's Rangers were on the left, the Jägers {{on each side of}} the road, and the light infantry of the Guards on the right, and headed in the direction of Tyson's Tavern on Limekiln Road. [...] As Grey advanced toward the American center, his troops took fire from American militia on Edge Hill. The militia were quickly routed, with between twenty and thirty killed, and fifteen of them taken as prisoners. Gens. John Cadwalader and Joseph Reed, out reconnoitering on horse near Twickenham, the country estate of Thomas Wharton Jr., attempted to rally the Potter's fleeing Pennsylvania militia. Lieut. Col. Sherman, the officer in charge of the 2nd Connecticut Continentals, resented Reed's assumption of command, and later complained to Washington that it put [...] "...Officers and Men into such confusion that it rendered it impossible to keep that regularity so necessary when going into Action." [...] The British soon had them surrounded and outnumbered, and the Pennsylvania militia again panicked and fled. [...] The 2nd Connecticut Continentals made a stand, firing between two and five rounds per man; Sherman only gave the order to retreat when the Jägers were within 15–20 yards of his position. [...] At some point, Cadwalader and Reed became separated from the militia, and Reed's horse was shot out from under him. A body of Hessians charged at the two officers with bayonets, but Capt. McLane rode up with a few dragoons and ordered a charge that scattered the Hessians. McLane then took the two officers to safety.|$|E
50|$|His mother {{sent him}} to study sculpture, {{painting}} and ceramics at the art academy in Oaxaca. It was there that <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> of classical music and learned to play cello on a borrowed instrument. He then switched to a guitar which {{was a gift from}} his brother, because his family could not afford a cello. At the Benito Juarez Autonomous University in Oaxaca, Gutiérrez studied classical guitar and his musical interests spread to diverse genres including classical, flamenco, son cubano and jazz.|$|R
5000|$|The Aleut peoples {{knew of the}} Pribilofs {{long before}} westerners {{discovered}} the islands. They called the islands Amiq, Aleut for [...] "land of mother's brother" [...] or [...] "related land". According to their oral tradition, {{the son of an}} Unimak Island elder found them after paddling north in his boat in an attempt to survive a storm that caught him out at sea; when the winds finally died, he was lost in dense fog—until <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> of Saint Paul's vast seal colonies.|$|R
2500|$|The 3rd Division of Davout's 3rd Corps, {{temporarily}} {{commanded by}} his Chief of Staff Fournier, {{had been ordered}} to pursue a Russian column apparently retiring on Pułtusk. [...] Concerned about {{the strength of the}} Russian cavalry force which was escorting guns and stores, Fournier had pursued but not engaged. [...] He was preparing to stop for <b>the</b> night when <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> of combat to his right, and so marched his men towards Pułtusk. [...] Due the state of the roads he was only able to bring up one gun.|$|R
2500|$|Jouett, {{twenty-seven years}} old, lay {{asleep on the}} lawn of the Cuckoo Tavern (although an account by Thomas Jefferson says Jouett was at his father's house) in Louisa County, Virginia, {{on the night of}} June 3, 1781. During the night, <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of {{approaching}} cavalry and spotted the [...] "White Coats," [...] the British cavalry unit led by Colonel Tarleton.|$|E
2500|$|The rowboat was {{displaying}} a light at its bow, {{but according to}} Colby, no light could be seen displayed by the launch.

[...] Colby called out to alert the launch to turn aside, {{but this was not}} availing. [...] Although the rowboat was overturned and the four people in it thrown in the water, fortunately no one was drowned.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the time}} the tunnel {{collapsed}} there were a total of 15 people and five items of plant inside. [...] According to the Railway Inspectorate report, shortly before 3:45am the duty Railway Works Inspector noticed some small pieces of rock flaking away from the tunnel wall, approximately 90 metres from the southern portal. He decided {{that it would be}} wise to shore up the affected piece of the tunnel and was making his way towards the site office to arrange this when <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of the tunnel collapsing behind him.|$|E

2500|$|Wheeler fell {{seriously ill}} during the {{campaign}} and turned over command of the division to Brig. Gen. Samuel S. Sumner. Wheeler was still incapacitated in July when the Battle of San Juan Hill began but once <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of guns, the [...] "War Child" [...] returned to the front despite his illness. Being the senior officer present at the front he first issued orders to the 1st Division, under Jacob F. Kent, before returning to his own command. Upon taking the heights, Wheeler assured General William R. Shafter that the position could be held against a possible counterattack. He led the division through the Siege of Santiago and was {{a senior member of}} the peace commission.|$|E
2500|$|It {{was after}} 8:00am {{by the time}} the march started again, mostly because the rangers took their time {{breaking}} camp. Not long after, the Americans heard the sound of Mexican bugles in the distance, sounding the retreat. Heintzelman ordered his men to make haste but no more Cortinistas were found. The major assumed correctly that he had successfully dispersed Cortina's army so he turned the column around and went back to Fort Brown, arriving later that evening. The Texas Rangers burned down several abandoned homes during the return march. According to Heintzelman; [...] "The Texas Rangers were burning all - friends and foes.... We would undoubtedly have done better without the Rangers." [...] Heintzelman later found that Cortina himself was not in charge of the rebels during the battle. He had gone north with 200 of his men, to conduct an ambush, and left his lieutenant, Teodoro Zamora, in command. However, when <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of cannon fire, Cortina rushed to the scene but apparently arrived too late to engage.|$|E
2500|$|There is some {{dispute over}} the {{circumstances}} of Shivaji's withdrawal (treaty or escape) and his destination (Ragna or Vishalgad), but the popular story details his night movement to Vishalgad and a sacrificial rear-guard action {{to allow him to}} escape. Per these accounts, Shivaji withdrew from Panhala by cover of night, and as he was pursued by the enemy cavalry, so his Maratha sardar Baji Prabhu Deshpande of Bandal Deshmukh, along with 300 soldiers, volunteered to fight to the death to hold back the enemy at Ghod Khind ("horse ravine") to give Shivaji {{and the rest of the}} army a chance to reach the safety of the Vishalgad fort. In the ensuing Battle of Pavan Khind, the smaller Maratha force held back the larger enemy to buy time for Shivaji to escape. Baji Prabhu Deshpande was wounded but continued to fight until <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of cannon fire from Vishalgad, signalling Shivaji had safely reached the fort, on the evening of 13 July 1660. [...] Ghod Khind (khind meaning [...] "a narrow mountain pass") was later renamed Paavan Khind ("sacred pass") in honour of Bajiprabhu Deshpande, Shibosingh Jadhav, Fuloji, and all other soldiers who fought in there.|$|E

2500|$|By the {{afternoon}} of April 7, Mahone and Gordon had entrenched on high ground at Cumberland Church and soon were joined by {{the remainder of the}} Confederate Army. Upon his II Corps being shelled when they approached the Confederate line, Humphreys attacked the Confederate position bringing on the Battle of Cumberland Church. Not realizing that other Union infantry could not cross the Appomattox River at Farmville and reinforce him, Humphreys made a second futile attack when <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of battle nearby, which he thought was another Union infantry attack on the Confederate line. He had heard what has sometimes been called the Battle of Farmville rather than part of the Battle of Cumberland Church, which was an engagement between part of Crook's cavalry division and Confederate cavalry guarding a wagon train headed west. The Confederate cavalry surprised the leading Union troopers and inflicted 74 casualties, among which were many prisoners including Union Brigadier General J. Irvin Gregg. Either the Confederates drove the Union force back across the river, or coincidentally at about this time, Sheridan recalled Crook to Farmville and, in any event, Sheridan directed Crook to move his division to Prospect Station, [...] west of Farmville. Crook's division arrived at Prospect Station about midnight.|$|E
2500|$|In April 2014, The Guardian {{published}} evidence implicating Jan van Risseghem, {{a military}} pilot who {{served with the}} RAF during World War II, later with the Belgian Air Force and became famous as the pilot of Moise Tshombe in Katanga. [...] The article claims that an American NSA employee, former naval pilot Commander Charles Southall, working at the NSA listening station in Cyprus in 1961 shortly after midnight {{on the night of}} the crash, heard an intercept of a pilot's commentary in the air over Ndola – 3,000 miles away. Southall recalled the pilot saying: [...] "I see a transport plane coming low. All the lights are on. I'm going down to make a run on it. Yes, it is the Transair DC-6. It's the plane," [...] adding that his voice was [...] "cool and professional". Then <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of gunfire and the pilot exclaiming: [...] "I've hit it. There are flames! It's going down. It's crashing!" [...] Based on aircraft registration and availability with the Katangese Air Force, registration KAT-93, a Fouga CM.170 Magister would be the most likely aircraft used and the website http://www.belgian-wings.be/ claims that van Risseghem piloted the Magisters for the KAF in 1961.|$|E
