40|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{efficacy}} of 5 -aminolevulinic acid-based (ALA) photodynamic therapy (PDT), different ALA derivatives are presently being investigated. ALA esters are more lipophilic and therefore may <b>have</b> <b>better</b> <b>skin</b> penetration properties than ALA, possibly resulting in enhanced protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) production, In previous studies it was shown that ALA pentyl ester (ALAPE) does considerably enhance the PpIX production in cells in vitro compared with ALA, We investigated the in vivo PpIX fluorescence kinetics after application of ALA and ALAPE to hairless mice with and without UVB-induced early skin cancer. ALA and ALAPE (20 % wt/wt) were applied topically to the mouse skin and after 30 min, the solvent was wiped off and PpIX fluorescence was followed in time with in vivo fluorescence spectroscopy and imaging. At 6 and 12 h after the 30 min application, skin samples of visible lesions and adjacent altered skin (UVB-exposed mouse skin) and normal mouse skin were collected for fluorescence microscopy. From each sample, frozen sections were made and phase contrast images and fluorescence images were recorded. The in vivo fluorescence kinetics showed that ALAPE induced more PpIX in visible lesions and altered skin of the UVB-exposed mouse skin, {{but not in the}} normal mouse skin. In the microscopic fluorescence images, higher ALAPE-induced PpIX levels were measured in the stratum corneum, but not in the dysplastic layer of the epidermis, In deeper layers of the skin, PpIX levels were the same after ALA and ALAPE application. In conclusion, ALAPE does induce higher PpIX fluorescence levels in vivo in our early skin cancer model, but these higher PpIX levels are not located in the dysplastic layer of the epidermi...|$|E
40|$|The present {{investigation}} aimed at formulation, performance evaluation, and stability studies of new vesicular drug carrier system protransfersomes for transdermal {{delivery of the}} contraceptive agent, levonorgestrel. Protransfersome gel (PTG) formulations of levonorgestrel were prepared and characterized for vesicle shape, size, entrapment efficiency, turbidity, and drug permeation across rat skin and were evaluated for their stability. The system was evaluated in vivo for biological assay of progestational activity including endometrial assay, inhibition {{of the formation of}} corpora lutea, and weight gain of uterus. The effects of different formulation variables (type of alcohol, type and concentration of surfactant) on transdermal permeability profile were assessed. The optimized PTG formulation showed enhanced in vitro skin permeation flux of 15. 82 ± 0. 37 μg/cm 2 /hr as compared to 0. 032 ± 0. 01 μg/cm 2 /hr for plain drug solution. PTG also showed good stability and after 2 months of storage there was no change in liquid crystalline nature, drug content, and other characteristic parameters. The peak plasma concentration of levonorgestrel (0. 139 ± 0. 05 μg/mL) was achieved within 4 hours and maintained until 48 hours by a single topical application of optimized PTG formulation. In vivo performance of the PTG formulation showed increase in the therapeutic efficacy of drug. Results indicated that the optimized protransfersomal formulation of levonorgestrel <b>had</b> <b>better</b> <b>skin</b> permeation potential, sustained release characteristic, and better stability than proliposomal formulation...|$|R
40|$|Background/aims  Lactobionic acid (LA) is a newer {{cosmeceutical}} active {{belonging to}} the class of alpha-hydroxyacids (AHAs), showing advantages over them. The aim of part I {{of this study was}} to compare efficacy and irritation potential of LA vs. glycolic acid (GA) from two types of vehicles – gel and emulsion. In part II, effects of LA-containing emulsions based on a new, natural emulsifier of alkylpolyglucoside (APG) type were evaluated. Methods  Skin bioengineering was used on 77 healthy volunteers to assess: color as erythema and melanin (MI) index, transepidermal water loss, electrical capacitance and pH of the skin. In part I of the study, the parameters were measured after occlusion and periodically during 2 weeks of test samples application; in part II parameters were measured periodically during 4 weeks.

40|$|A higher milking frequency, as a {{consequence}} of milking with an automated milking system, incorporates a threat to teat condition. To study the effect of transition from conventional to automated milking on teat skin and teat end condition, 40 lactating Holstein-Friesian cows and heifers from a high yielding dairy herd were randomly allocated to either a conventional or an automated milking system group. In the latter group, automated milking was initiated during the study period, while conventional milking was continued in the control group. Teat skin and teat end condition were evaluated weekly on quarter level for all animals from 5 wk before until 8 wk after transition. A high emollient iodine teat dip was used on all cows during the study period. Teat skin condition of the animals in the automated milking system group was consistent from before and during milking with the automated milking system. Rear teats <b>had</b> a <b>better</b> <b>skin</b> and end condition than front teats. Evolution of teat end condition over time between the automated and conventional milking groups was not statistically different. Heifers, however, seemed to be more sensitive to the change than multiparous cows, as their teat end condition slightly decreased.

Lidocaine (LID) combined with prilocaine (PRI) {{has been used as}} a topical preparation for dermal anesthesia for treatment of conditions such as paresthesia. Materials and methods: In this study, for combination anesthesia and overcoming the drawbacks of LID and PRI, respectively, LID- and PRI-loaded solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) were prepared and characterized by determination of their particle size, drug loading capacity, stability, in vitro drug release behavior and in vitro cellular viability. Ex vivo skin permeation and in vivo anesthesia analgesic efficiency of these two systems were also evaluated and compared. Results: Results revealed that combination delivery of the dual drugs exhibited more remarkable efficiency than signal drug-loaded systems. SLN systems <b>have</b> <b>better</b> ex vivo <b>skin</b> permeation ability than NLCs. NLC systems revealed a stronger in vivo anesthesia analgesic effect than SLN systems. Conclusion: It can be concluded that SLNs and NLCs have different advantages, and that both carriers are promising dual drug delivery systems for topical anesthetic analgesic therapy.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The pilgrimage (Hajj) to {{the holy}} mosque {{in the city of}} Makkah takes place once every year and during this huge {{gathering}} skin diseases are quite common due to hot weather and over crowding. The aim {{of this study was to}} collect and report data regarding different dermatological problems occurring during the holy month of Zil-hajj. METHODS: Data regarding skin diseases was collected from pilgrims which were examined and diagnosed clinically at the Department of Dermatology King Abdul Aziz Hospital, during the month of Zil-Hajja of the year 2000. These patients were referred from various primary health centers, medical hajj missions of various countries and Children and Maternity hospital in Makkah. RESULTS: During the month of Zil-hajja of the year 2000, 1510 cases were seen, of these 1143 were males and 367 were females. The criteria for diagnosis for most of the cases were mainly clinical. The highest number of patients was in the age group of 20 - 50 years. Eczemas of different types were the most common skin disease observed in these pilgrims, intertrigo was the next most common presenting condition this was followed by fungal and bacterial infections. CONCLUSION: A high frequency of skin diseases such as eczemas, intertrigo, pyoderma and fungal infections was found among the pilgrims.

40|$|In Degree {{dissertation}} titled “Differences in {{some physical}} characteristics and motor abilities at dance active and dance inactive children” we compared some physical characteristics and motor abilities {{in the two}} groups of children: the ones that are taking the interests in dance and the ones that are not interested in dance. In theoretical part of dissertation we presented the offer of dance schools in Slovenia, projects School dance festival, recognition of dance in elementary schools, influence of dance regarding the children growth, motor abilities and sport measurement data of the children. There were 339 children from first to fifth class of elementary school included in the research who presented us, by the parents permission, their sport measurements data. In the whole pattern there are 150 children who have interests in dance and 189 children who do not have interests in dance. In the empirical part we tried to establish if there are differences between those two groups regarding the test results for sport measurement data basis. The data were edited by SPSS and Microsoft Office Excel. From the acquired data we established that there are some differences in certain areas. The dancers are better in following tests of motor abilities: •	Testing ground with obstacles moving backward (coordination), •	Standing long jump (swift and explosive strenght), •	Bent over on the bench (body flexibility forward), •	Contracted arm hang (muscular endurance of shoulders and arms) and •	Running on 600 meters course (general endurance). Statistically known characteristic differences were also shown in range of physical characteristics which are measurement of skin fold on upper arm where the dancers compared with non-dancers <b>had</b> <b>better</b> results (thinner <b>skin</b> fold). ...|$|R
