Urticaria may be complicated by other pathological conditions, affecting the respiratory system: asthma and rhinitis. A cohort of 735 health workers examined at the Allergy Surgery of the Department of Environmental Medicine and Public health has been studied. All people (295 subjects, 40, 1 %) who experienced symptoms were examined. Latex exposure data were recorded, dividing the cases into three risk categories, high, medium and low, together with allergic symptoms and previous story of allergic diseases. In the group of 295 symptomatic patients, 130 workers (44. 0 %) reported symptoms of urticaria associated with occupational exposure. About half (46. 1 %) of these subjects were sensitized to natural latex.

40|$|The Ibizan wall lizard, Podarcis pityusensis, was {{the subject}} of several {{documented}} 25 translocations by the German herpetologist Martin Eisentraut, in 1930. He aimed to initiate 26 long-term experiments into the evolution of melanism and other morphological traits and 27 accordingly reported introductions into five islets that (he believed) contained no lizards. In 28 this study, we analysed the genetics and morphological characteristics of individuals we found 29 there. We found no lizards on two of the islets, namely Escull de Tramuntana or Galera, but 30 for the first time, detected a large population on a third, Es Vaixell. Analyses of microsatellite 31 DNA placed individuals from a fourth islet, Dau Gran, with those from the islet of Escull 32 Vermell. They are also morphologically close to individuals from Escull Vermell. This 33 suggests that selection pressures could have favoured the Escull Vermell phenotype following 34 introduction. Eisentraut founded the Es Vaixell population with non- melanic Ibizan 35 specimens, but the present day population of Es Vaixell was found to be fully melanic. Genetic 36 markers support a strong similarity between Es Vaixell and Na Gorra, and indicate that, <b>in</b> <b>all</b> 37 <b>likelihood,</b> the individuals introduced by Eisentraut have left no descendants. It is likely that 38 Es Vaixell already contained lizards prior to this introduction.

40|$|Pathogen genes {{involved}} in interactions with their plant hosts {{are expected to}} evolve under positive Darwinian selection or balancing selection. In this study a single copy avirulence gene, AvrP 4, in the plant pathogen Melampsora lini, was used to investigate the evolution of such a gene across species. Partial translation elongation factor 1 -alpha sequences were obtained to establish phylogenetic relationships among the Melampsora species. We amplified AvrP 4 homologues from species pathogenic on hosts from different plant families and orders, across the inferred phylogeny. Translations of the AvrP 4 sequences revealed a predicted signal peptide and towards the C-terminus of the protein, six identically spaced cysteines were identified <b>in</b> <b>all</b> sequences. Maximum <b>likelihood</b> analysis of synonymous versus non-synonymous substitution rates indicated that positive selection {{played a role in}} the evolution of the gene during the diversification of the genus.

5|$|Since a {{proposal}} by Butinov and Knorozov in the 1950s, {{the majority of}} philologists, linguists and cultural historians have taken the line that rongorongo was not true writing but proto-writing, that is, an ideographic- and rebus-based mnemonic device, such as the Dongba script of the Nakhi people, which would <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>likelihood</b> {{make it impossible to}} decipher. This skepticism is justified not only by the failure of the numerous attempts at decipherment, but by the extreme rarity of independent writing systems around the world. Of those who have attempted to decipher rongorongo as a true writing system, the vast majority have assumed it was logographic, a few that it was syllabic or mixed. Statistically it appears to have been compatible with neither a pure logography nor a pure syllabary. The topic of the texts is unknown; various investigators have speculated they cover genealogy, navigation, astronomy, or agriculture. Oral history suggests that only a small elite were ever literate, and that the tablets were considered sacred.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Cost-effectiveness is an {{increasingly}} {{important factor in the}} choice of a test or therapy. OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of various methods routinely used for the diagnosis of stable coronary disease in Portugal. METHODS: Seven diagnostic strategies were assessed. The cost-effectiveness of each strategy was defined as the cost per correct diagnosis (inclusion or exclusion of obstructive coronary artery disease) in a symptomatic patient. The cost and effectiveness of each method were assessed using Bayesian inference and decision-making tree analyses, with the pretest likelihood of disease ranging from 10 % to 90 %. RESULTS: The cost-effectiveness of diagnostic strategies was strongly dependent on the pretest likelihood of disease. In patients with a pretest likelihood of disease of ≤ 50 %, the diagnostic algorithms, which include cardiac computed tomography angiography, were the most cost-effective. In these patients, depending on the pretest likelihood of disease and the willingness to pay for an additional correct diagnosis, computed tomography angiography may be used as a frontline test or reserved for patients with positive/inconclusive ergometric test results or a calcium score of > 0. In patients with a pretest likelihood of disease of ≥ 60 %, up-front invasive coronary angiography appears to be the most cost-effective strategy. CONCLUSIONS: Diagnostic algorithms that include cardiac computed tomography angiography are the most cost-effective in symptomatic patients with suspected stable coronary artery disease and a pretest likelihood of disease of ≤ 50 %. In high-risk patients (pretest likelihood of disease ≥ 60 %), up-front invasive coronary angiography appears to be the most cost-effective strategy. <b>In</b> <b>all</b> pretest <b>likelihoods</b> of disease, strategies based on ischemia appear to be more expensive and less effective compared with those based on anatomical tests. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

5|$|After {{an anxious}} journey of nine days {{during which they}} were honoured in some towns and refused entry to others, Metternich, his wife, and son Richard arrived in the Dutch city of Arnhem.

On 20 April they landed at Blackwall in London, where they stayed in the Brunswick Hotel in Hanover Square for a fortnight until they found a permanent residence. Metternich largely enjoyed his time in London: the Duke of Wellington, now nearly eighty, tried to keep him entertained, and there were also visits from Palmerston, Guizot (now also in exile) and Benjamin Disraeli, who enjoyed his political conversation. The sole disappointment was that Victoria herself did not acknowledge his presence in the capital. The trio leased a house, 44 Eaton Square, for four months. The younger children joined them in the summer. He followed events in Austria from afar, famously denying ever having erred; in fact, he declared the turmoil in Europe to be vindication of his policies. In Vienna, a hostile post-censorship press continued to attack him; in particular, they accused him of embezzlement and accepting bribes, prompting an investigation. Metternich was eventually cleared of the more extreme charges, and searches for evidence of the lesser ones came up empty handed. (<b>In</b> <b>all</b> <b>likelihood</b> Metternich's large expense claims were merely a product of the necessities of early 19th century diplomacy.)

Resting state EEGs were recorded <b>in</b> <b>all</b> subjects. Synchronisation <b>likelihood</b> (SL) between local cortical areas was compared in the alpha and beta band according to ApoE ε 4 status and diagnosis. Results: ApoE ε 4 carriers had higher SL values in lower and upper alpha band, in both diagnostic groups.

Conclusion: The effects of AD and ApoE ε 4 on functional connectivity are opposite and independent.
