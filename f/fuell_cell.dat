40|$|Alkaline based {{fuel cells}} {{are among the}} most {{efficient}} due to the enhanced kinetics of oxygen reduction in alkaline media. In space applications, they have demonstrated efficiencies near 60 %, with the potential to generate electricity with efficiencies at nearly 70 %. One of the largest hurdles to overcome in the general uptake of hydrogen fuel cells is the ability to store hydrogen fuel in a form with sufficient energy density to allow for mobile systems to be truly viable. This often means that hydrogen has to be stored at very high pressure (around 70 MPa) in bulky tanks to provide sufficient capacity. Clearly this is not suitable for smaller vehicles or portable systems. Partly to address this, there has been considerable interest in direct oxidation liquid <b>fuelled</b> <b>cells</b> due to the very high specific energy density of liquid fuels. A very compact variant of the liquid <b>fuelled</b> <b>cell</b> which has received little attention is the alkaline dissolved fuel cell where the fuel is dissolved in the electrolyte and the system relies on a selective cathode for efficient operation. Borohydrides present a particularly good option for an alkaline dissolved fuel system, having high energy densities, a low standard potential for the oxidation to borax (an 8 electron process) and good stability in alkaline conditions. A key area in the success of a fuel cell utilizing borohydride is the development of an anode which can make use of the full 8 electron oxidation to borax directly oxidising the borohydride with as little of the hydrolysis reaction occurring as possible. This is in addition to common requirements of high activity, high stability, good electronic conductivity and transport of reactants and products. Here we present investigations into the oxidation of borohydride in alkaline media under various conditions for a selection of candidate materials in different forms using an RDE (rotating disc electrode) based procedure. Results demonstrate that hydrolysis or an indirect oxidation mechanism reduces the coulombic efficiency of the oxidation reaction observed for the materials investigated so far. There is also a significant difference in behaviour between candidate materials. The best performing materials from the RDE studies will be used to develop suitably active and durable functional fuel cell electrodes using scalable processes such as screen printing...|$|R

40|$|Among the {{possible}} systems investigated for energy production with low environmental impact, polymeric electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) are very promising as electrochemical power sources for application in portable technology and electric vehicles. For practical applications, operating FCs at temperatures above 100 Â°C is desired, both for hydrogen and methanol <b>fuelled</b> <b>cells.</b> When hydrogen {{is used as}} fuel, an increase of the cell temperature produces enhanced CO tolerance, faster reaction kinetics, easier water management and reduced heat exchanger requirement. The use of methanol instead of hydrogen as a fuel for vehicles has several practical benefits such as easy transport and storage, but the slow oxidation kinetics of methanol needs operating direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) at intermediate temperatures. For this reason, new membranes are required. Our strategy to achieve the goal of operating at temperatures above 120 Â°C is to develop organic/inorganic hybrid membranes. The first approach {{was the use of}} nanocomposite class I hybrids where nanocrystalline ceramic oxides were added to Nafion. Nanocomposite membranes showed enhanced characteristics, hence allowing their operation up to 130 Â°C when the <b>cell</b> was <b>fuelled</b> with hydrogen and up to 145 Â°C in DMFCs, reaching power densities of 350 mW cm- 2. The second approach was to prepare Class II hybrids via the formation of covalent bonds between totally aromatic polymers and inorganic clusters. The properties of such covalent hybrids can be modulated by modifying the ratio between organic and inorganic groups {{and the nature of the}} chemical components allowing to reach high and stable conductivity values up to 6. 4 Ã 10 - 2 S cm- 1 at 120 Â°C.

Microtubular SOFC present {{significant}} {{advantages in}} comparison with the traditional planar SOFC configuration. In particular, the tubular design facilitates sealing and also reduces thermal gradients. As a consequence, rapid starts up times are possible. In addition, another advantage of the microtubular configuration is their higher power density per unit volume. Due to these properties, those devices are especially attractive for portable applications. There has been a great interest in microtubular SOFCs in the recent years, mainly using anode supported cells. Electrolyte supported cells have also been reported, but there are relatively few investigations using the cathode as the support. In the present paper, Nd 1. 95 NiO 4 +Î´ (NNO) has been chosen as the cathode support, as it presents superior oxygen transport properties {{in comparison with}} other commonly used cathode materials, such as LSCF or LSM, and these material has been proven as an excellent cathode for SOFC and SOEC applications. Results on the fabrication and characterization of NNO cathode supported SOFC will be presented. The tubes were fabricated by cold isostatic pressing (CIP) using NNO powders and corn starch as the pore former. The electrolyte (GDC based) was deposited by wet powder spray (WPS) on top of the pre-sintered tubes and then co-sintered. Finally, a NiOGDC paste was dip-coated as the anode.

A single labile DOC compound was periodically added to the experimental culture and its degradation by a monospecific marine bacterial strain was followed. The measured variables were DOC and bacterial biomass determined from the particulate organic carbon values. Experimental dynamics showed a repetition of 2 successive patterns after each DOC pulse:(1) substrate consumption and bacterial growth {{in the first few}} hours after substrate addition, followed by(2) bacterial reduction(organic carbon-related) and associated non-labile DOC release within the next few hours.

40|$|Photosynthetic organisms {{have evolved}} to use light {{efficiently}} by scheduling their cellular processes, such as growth and cell division, at specific times of the day. During the day, fixed carbon is used for growth and is partially stored as carbohydrates (e. g., starch). It is commonly assumed that this accumulated starch is essential for <b>fuelling</b> up <b>cell</b> division at night. To test this hypothesis, this study investigates growth, cell division and presence of a transitory energy storage (TES) in both the wild-type and starchless mutant strain of Acutodesmus obliquus under light/dark (LD) cycles and nitrogen replete conditions. A. obliquus (formerly known as Scenedesmus obliquus) wild-type utilized light 20 % more efficiently under LD regimes compared with continuous light. When exposed to LD regimes, the wild-type scheduled cell division in a 4 -hour period starting 2 h before âsunsetâ. Starch acted as the major transitory energy storage (TES) compound: it was accumulated during {{the last part of}} the light period and was consumed throughout the entire dark period. The slm 1 mutant, with a blocked starch synthesis pathway, showed diurnal rhythms in growth and cell division. However, no other carbohydrates nor triacylglycerols took over the role of TES compound in slm 1. Therefore, in contrast to what is generally acknowledged, this study shows that neither starch nor any other major alternative TES is required for synchronized growth and cell division in A. obliquus. The starchless mutant did show a reduced growth and cell division rate compared to the wild-type. Starch, thus, plays a major role in efficient harnessing of light energy over LD cycles, likely because the ability to accumulate starch enhances biomass production capacity and accelerates cell division rate in A. obliquus. </p...|$|R

A LPEI foi funcionalizada por meio de sÃ­ntese do tipo "paralela" com grupos etanÃ³licos e octÃ­licos. Para a seleÃ§Ã£o dos melhores estabilizantes das Ag-NPs utilizou-se uma abordagem de processamento rÃ¡pido e foram selecionados dois estabilizantes: F 1 (LPEI funcionalizada com 0, 4 eq. cloroetanol) e F 12 (LPEI funcionalizada com 0, 4 eq. cloroetanol e 0, 5 eq. bromoctano). Para a otimizaÃ§Ã£o das condiÃ§Ãµes de sÃ­ntese das Ag-NPs utilizou-se planejamento fatorial. EntÃ£o, as NPs bimetÃ¡licas foram sintetizadas utilizando-se a banda SPR das Ag-NPs como um probe in situ. As F 1 -AgPd-NPs se mostraram completamente esfÃ©ricas e ocas, enquanto as NPs preparadas a partir das F 12 -Ag-NPs se apresentam como esferas porosas. Por fim, foram determinadas as atividade catalÃ­ticas: (i) das Ag-NPs na reaÃ§Ã£o de reduÃ§Ã£o do p-nitrofenol utilizando-se NaBH 4 como agente redutor, onde foram obtidas as maiores constantes catalÃ­ticas encontradas na literatura; e (ii) das AgPd-NPs na reaÃ§Ã£o de oxidaÃ§Ã£o do Ã¡cido fÃ³rmico, onde apenas o sistema F 1 -AgPd-NPs foi eficiente, apresentando a maior atividade por Ã¡rea encontrada na literatura. As NPs foram caracterizadas por meio de diversas tÃ©cnicas. The goal of {{this work}} was the synthesis, {{characterization}} and catalytic study of silver and bimetallic silver-palladium nanoparticles (NPs) having the modified linear polyethylene imine (LPEI) as stabilizer. In order to achive this goal, the methodoly used was based on five steps: (i) the LPEI functionalization with chloroethanol and bromoctane; (ii) selection of the best Ag-NPs stabilizers using a high-throughput in situ screening; (iii) optimization of the conditions to synthetize the Ag-NPs using a multivariate analysis; (iv) synthesis of bimetallic NPs using the Ag-NPs SPR band as a probe in situ; e (v) determination of Ag-NPs catalytic activity over the p-nitrophenol (Nip) reaction using NaBH 4 as a reducing agent and AgPd-NPs catalytic activity over the formic acid oxidation reaction. The NPs were characterized by UV-Vis, TEM, HR-TEM, EDX, XRD, SAXS e DLS techniques. The Ag-NPs were synthesized using two stabilizers: F 1 (LPEI functionalized with 0. 4 equivalents of chloroethanol) and F 12 (LPEI functionalized with 0. 4 eq. of chloroethanol and 0. 5 eq. of bromoctane). For the Nip reduction reaction (used {{as a model for}} the M-NPs catalytic study) with NaBH 4 and F 1 - and F 12 -Ag-NPs as catalysts the rate constant normalized to the surface area of the NPs per unit volume found were 1. 66 and 0. 37 s- 1 m- 2 L, respectively. These values are among the highest ones found in literature. A full kinetic analysis based on the Langmuir model indicates that all species are likely adsorbed and accommodated on the surface before they take part in any reaction, and the Nip molecules hava a much stronger adsorption affinity than BH 4 - ions for the Ag-NP surface. Finally, using the Ag-NPs as templates, the silver-palladium nanoparticles (AgPd-NPs) were obtained by adding palladium acetate in the reaction medium. These NPs were also fully characterized by the UV-Vis, TEM, HR-TEM, EDX and XRD techniques, and it was possible to verify that the F 1 -AgPd-NPs are spherical and hollow, while the F 12 -AgPd-NPs are spherical and solid. The bimetallic NPs were used as catalysts for the formic acid oxidation reaction (for further use in <b>fuell</b> <b>cells),</b> but only the F 1 -AgPd-NPs system was active. For this system, the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) found was 1. 28 m 2 g- 1, and the area activity was 61 mA cm- 2, the highest value found in the literature, even when compared with nanocatalysts based only in Pd...|$|R
40|$|Here we {{investigated}} {{the change of}} the extracellular matrix and cardiac inflammation {{as well as the}} influence of these factors on LV function in experimental models of heart failure with normal ejection fraction as well as in endomyocardial biopsies of patients with heart failure with normal ejection fraction (HFNEF). In all works presented here we show that cardiac left ventricular stiffness is associated with the amount of cardiac collagen. In this regard we document in human biopsies from patients with HFNEF a positive correlation between cardiac collagen and stiffness. Furthermore, in diabetic animal models as well as in HFNEF patients cardiac inflammation defined as invading inflammatory cells can be found. We present evidence that inflammatory cells induce cardiac remodeling by paracrine-acting transforming growth factor beta, which induces the transdifferentiation of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts and thus lead to a cardiac collagen accumulation. Furthermore, in the experimental models as well as in patients the collagen degradation system was less active, so that existing collagen was degraded slower. Here too, the inhibitory effect of inflammation on the degradation system could be documented using human samples. The essence of the work submitted is that cardiac inflammation changes remodeling of the extracellular matrix with collagen accumulation, and thus promotes LV stiffness. One of the possible mechanisms is the transdifferentiation of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts, which is <b>fuelled</b> by inflammatory <b>cells...</b>|$|R
40|$|Low-carbon power {{generation}} receives increasing interest due to climate warming concerns. The present article analyses three low-carbon power cycles. The {{focus is on}} the feasibility of CO 2 capture and opportunities for energy and mass integration. The first power cycle is a zero-carbon solid biomass fuelled multi-step gasification gas turbine power cycle which applies multi-step solid biomass conversion being a more reversible process than one-step biomass combustion. The second zero-carbon coal fuelled oxy-gasification steam chemical looping combustion gas turbine cycle benefits from (i) improved cycle efficiency due to the increased reversibility of a chemical looping combustion process, (ii) cycle mass and energy integration due to several recirculation loops involved and (iii) extremely high CO 2 capture rate due to purity of CO 2 /H 2 O mixture achieved at the outlet from a syngas reactor. The last power cycle - a biogas <b>fuelled</b> oxy-reforming fuel <b>cell</b> cycle - is superior in the feasibility of CO 2 capture, i. e. CO 2 is captured from CO 2 -enriched streams and due to the utilisation of renewable biogas, negative net CO 2 atmospheric emissions are achieved. It is concluded that high CO 2 capture rates are feasible from pressurised CO 2 -enriched streams comprising either water or hydrogen, thus necessitating oxy-fuel power cycles. Opportunities for mass and energy integration are found to be increased in systems involving closed mass and energy recirculation loops. The discussions also emphasises that low-carbon power cycles could achieve minimised exergy losses by applying more reversible energy conversion processes...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{dynamics}} of cell renewal {{in the normal}} adult liver remains an unresolved issue. We investigate the possible contribution of a common biliary precursor cell pool to hepa-tocyte turnover in the chimeric long-term repopulated rat liver. The retrorsine (RS) -basedmodel ofmassive liver repopulation was used. Animals not expressing the CD 26 marker (CD 26 -) were injected with RS, followed by transplantation of 2 mil-lion syngeneic hepatocytes isolated from a normal CD 26 -expressing donor. Extensive (80 - 90 %) replacement of resi-dent parenchymal cells was observed at 1 year post-transplantation and persisted at 2 years, as expected. A panel of specific markers, including cytokeratin 7, OV 6, EpCAM, claudin 7 andÎ±-fetoprotein, was employed to locate the in situ putative progenitor and/or biliary epithelial cells in the stably repopulated liver. No overlap was observed between any of these markers and the CD 26 tag identifying transplanted cells. Exposure to RS was not inhibitory to the putative progenitor and/or biliary epithelial cells, nor did we observe any evidence of cell fusion between these cells and the transplanted cell population. Given the long-term (> 2 years) stability of the donor cell phenotype in this model of liver repopulation, the present findings suggest that hepatocyte turnover in the repopulated liver is <b>fuelled</b> by a <b>cell</b> lineage distinct {{from that of the}} biliary epithelium and relies largely on the differentiated parenchymal cell population. These results support the solid biological foundation of liver repopulation strategies based on the transplantation of isolated hepatocytes...|$|R
40|$|The water-gas shift (WGS) {{is one of}} {{the major}} steps for H 2 prodn. from gaseous, liq. and solid hydrocarbons. It is used to produce {{hydrogen}} for ammonia synthesis, to adjust the hydrogen-to-carbon monoxide ratio of synthesis gas, to detoxify gases. The WGS reactor is widely used as a part of fuel processors which produce hydrogen-rich stream from hydrocarbon-based fuels in a multi-step process. The WGS unit is placed downstream the fuel reformer in order to increase overall efficiency of hydrogen prodn. and to lower CO content in reformate. Fuel processors stand for considerable option for <b>fuelling</b> PEM fuel <b>cells</b> for both portable and stationary applications. Micro-structured reactors are used with benefits of process miniaturization, intensification and higher heat and mass transfer rates compared with conventional reactors. Micro-structured reactor systems are essential for processes where potential for considerable heat transfer exists as well as for kinetic studies of highly exothermic reactions at near-isothermal conditions. Modeling and simulation of a microchannel reactor for the WGS reaction is presented. The math. models concern a single reaction channel with porous layer of catalyst deposited on the metallic wall of the microstructure unit. Simplified one-phase and more sophisticated two-phase models, with sep. mass and energy balances for gas and solid phase at different levels of complexity, were developed. The models were implemented into gPROMS process modeling software. The models were used for an estn. of parameters in a kinetic expression using exptl. data obtained with a new WGS catalyst. The simulations provide detailed information about the compn. and temp. distribution in gas phase and solid catalyst inside the channel...|$|R
40|$|DNA {{damage is}} a key factor both in the {{evolution}} and treatment of cancer. Genomic instability is a common feature of cancer <b>cells,</b> <b>fuelling</b> accumulation of oncogenic mutations, while radiation and diverse genotoxic agents remain important, if imperfect, therapeutic modalities. Cellular responses to DNA damage are coordinated primarily by two distinct kinase signaling cascades, the ATMâChk 2 and ATRâChk 1 pathways, which are activated by DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and single-stranded DNA respectively. Historically, these pathways were thought to act in parallel with overlapping functions; however, more recently it has become apparent that their relationship is more complex. In response to DSBs, ATM is required both for ATRâChk 1 activation and to initiate DNA repair via homologous recombination (HRR) by promoting formation of single-stranded DNA at sites of damage through nucleolytic resection. Interestingly, cells and organisms survive with mutations in ATM or other components required for HRR, such as BRCA 1 and BRCA 2, but {{at the cost of}} genomic instability and cancer predisposition. By contrast, the ATRâChk 1 pathway is the principal direct effector of the DNA damage and replication checkpoints and, as such, is essential for the survival of many, although not all, cell types. Remarkably, deficiency for HRR in BRCA 1 - and BRCA 2 -deficient tumors confers sensitivity to cisplatin and inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), an enzyme required for repair of endogenous DNA damage. In addition, suppressing DNA damage and replication checkpoint responses by inhibiting Chk 1 can enhance tumor cell killing by diverse genotoxic agents. Here, we review current understanding of the organization and functions of the ATMâChk 2 and ATRâChk 1 pathways and the prospects for targeting DNA damage signaling processes for therapeutic purposes...|$|R
40|$|Introduction : For {{the past}} decade, three {{dimensional}} (3 D) culture {{has served as}} a foundation for regenerative medicine study. With an increasing awareness of the importance of cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions which are lacking in 2 D culture system, 3 D culture system has been employed for many other applications namely cancer research. Through development of various biomaterials and utilization of tissue engineering technology, many in vivo physiological responses are now better understood. The cellular and molecular communication of cancer cells and their microenvironment, for instance can be studied in vitro in 3 D culture system without relying on animal models alone. Predilection of prostate cancer (CaP) to bone remains obscure due to the complexity of the mechanisms and lack of proper model for the studies. In this study, we aim to investigate the interaction between CaP cells and osteoblasts simulating the natural bone metastasis. We also further investigate the invasiveness of CaP cells and response of androgen sensitve CaP cells, LNCaP to synthetic androgen. [...] - Method : Human osteoblast (hOB) scaffolds were prepared by seeding hOB on medical grade polycaprolactone-tricalcium phosphate (mPLC-TCP) scaffolds and induced to produce bone matrix. CaP cell lines namely wild type PC 3 (PC 3 -N), overexpressed prostate specific antigen PC 3 (PC 3 k 3 s 5) and LNCaP were seeded on hOB scaffolds as co-cultures. Morphology of cells was examined by Phalloidin-DAPI and SEM imaging. Gelatin zymography was performed on the 48 hours conditioned media (CM) from co-cultures to determine matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity. Gene expression of hOB/LNCaP co-cultures which were treated for 48 hours with 1 nM synthetic androgen R 1881 were analysed by quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR). [...] - Results : Co-culture of PCC/hOB revealed that the morphology of PCCs on the tissue engineered bone matrix varied from homogenous to heterogenous clusters. Enzymatically inactive pro-MMP 2 was detected in CM from hOBs and PCCs cultured on scaffolds. Elevation in MMP 9 activity was found only in hOB/PC 3 N co-culture. hOB/LNCaP co-culture showed increase in expression of key enzymes associated with steroid production which also corresponded to an increase in prostate specific antigen (PSA) and MMP 9. [...] - Conclusions : Upregulation of MMP 9 indicates involvement of ECM degradation during cancer invasion and bone metastases. Expression of enzymes involved in CaP progression, PSA, which is not expressed in osteoblasts, demonstrates that crosstalk between PCCs and osteoblasts may play a part in the aggressiveness of CaP. The presence of steroidogenic enzymes, particularly, RDH 5, in osteoblasts and stimulated expression in co-culture, may indicate osteoblast production of potent androgens, <b>fuelling</b> cancer <b>cell</b> proliferation. Based on these results, this practical 3 D culture system may provide greater understanding into CaP mediated bone metastasis. This allows the role of the CaP/hOB interaction with regards to invasive property and steroidogenesis to be further explored. ...|$|R
40|$|Several aspects make todayâs {{transport}} system non-sustainable: â¢ Production, transport and combustion {{of fossil fuels}} lead to global and local environmental problems. â¢ Oil dependency in the transport sector may lead to economical and political instability. â¢ Air pollution, noise, congestion and land-use may jeopardise public health and quality of life, especially in urban areas. In a sustainable urban {{transport system}} most trips are made with public transport because high convenience and comfort makes travelling with public transport attractive. In terms of emissions, including noise, the vehicles are environmentally sustainable, locally as well as globally. Vehicles are energy-efficient and the primary energy stems from renewable sources. Costs are reasonable for all involved, from passengers, bus operators and transport authorities to vehicle manufacturers. The system is thus commercially viable on its own merits. This thesis presents the results from three projects involving different concept buses, all with different powertrains. The first two projects included technical evaluations, including tests, of two different fuel cell buses. The third project focussed on development of a series hybrid-bus with internal combustion engine intended for production around 2010. The research on the fuel cell buses included evaluations of the energy efficiency improvement potential using energy mapping and vehicle simulations. Attitudes to hydrogen fuel cell buses among passengers, bus drivers and bus operators were investigated. Safety aspects of hydrogen as a vehicle fuel were analysed {{and the use of}} hydrogen compared to electrical energy storage were also investigated. One main conclusion is that a city bus should be considered as one energy system, because auxiliaries contribute largely to the energy use. Focussing only on the powertrain is not sufficient. The importance of mitigating losses far down an energy conversion chain is emphasised. The Scania hybrid fuel cell bus showed the long-term potential of fuel cells, advanced auxiliaries and hybrid-electric powertrains, but technologies applied in that bus are not yet viable in terms of cost or robustness over the service life of a bus. Results from the EU-project CUTE show that hydrogen <b>fuelled</b> fuel <b>cell</b> buses are viable for real-life operation. Successful operation and public acceptance show that focus on robustness and cost in vehicle design were key success factors, despite the resulting poor fuel economy. Hybrid-electric powertrains are feasible in stop-and-go city operation. Fuel consumption can be reduced, comfort improved, noise lowered and the main power source downsized and operated less dynamically. The potential for design improvements due to flexible component packaging is implemented in the Scania hybrid concept bus. This bus and the framework for its hybrid management system are discussed in this thesis. The development of buses for a more sustainable urban transport should be made in small steps to secure technical and economical realism, which both are needed to guarantee commercialisation and volume of production. This is needed for alternative products to have a significant influence. Hybrid buses with internal combustion engines running on renewable fuel is tomorrowâs technology, which paves the way for plug-in hybrid, battery electric and fuel cell hybrid vehicles the day after tomorrow.

30|$|Biomass {{is one of}} the {{renewable}} {{and potentially}} sustainable energy sources and has many possible applications varying from heat generation to the production of advanced secondary energy carriers. It has almost zero or very low net CO 2 emission since carbon and energy are fixed during the biomass growth [1]. There are different types of technologies for converting biomass to electricity or to a secondary fuel such as thermal conversion, chemical conversion and bio-chemical conversion [2]. However, thermo-chemical methods such as gasification have a great potential in producing a syngas mainly composed of H 2 and CO with traces of different gases such as CH 4 in different proportions [3]. The produced fuel gas can be flexibly utilized in boilers, engines, gas turbines or fuel cells [4]. Smaller scale gasification systems with internal combustion engines can now be used for thousands of hours to give reasonably high electrical efficiencies and limited emissions [5]. However, fuel cells have the potential to operate at higher electrical efficiency and with lower emissions compared with traditional power generation techniques. Fuel cells are emerging as a leading alternative technology to the more polluting internal combustion engines in vehicle and stationary distributed energy applications. In addition, the future demand for portable electric power supplies is likely to exceed the capability of current battery technology. Hydrogen-powered fuel cells emit only water and have virtually no pollutant emissions, even nitrogen oxides, because they operate at temperatures that are much lower than internal combustion engines [6]. However, even fuel <b>cells</b> <b>fuelled</b> by hydro- carbon fuels have the potential to provide efficient, clean and quiet energy conversion, which can contribute to a significant reduction in greenhouse gases and local pollution. When heat generated in fuel cells is also utilized in combined heat and power (CHP) systems, an overall efficiency of 85 Â % in excess can be achieved [7]. DifferentÂ types of fuel cells suitable for severalÂ energy applications at varying scales have been developed, but all share the basic design of two electrodes (anode and cathode) separated by a solid or liquid electrolyte or a membrane. Hydrogen (or a hydrogen-containing fuel) and air are fed into the anode and cathode of the fuel cell, and the electrochemical reactions assisted by catalysts take place at the electrodes [8]. The electrolyte enables transport of ions between the electrodes while the excess electrons flow through an external circuit to provide electrical power. Fuel cells are classified according to the nature of their electrolyte, which also determines their operating temperature, the type of fuel and a range of applications [9]. The electrolyte can be acid, base, salt or a solid ceramic or polymeric membrane that conducts ions.|$|R
40|$|Royal Society of Chemistry 2008 This Update {{refers to}} papers {{published}} approximately between September 2005 and August 2006. In {{a new development}} we have introduced a section specifically to discuss the emerging field of metallomics. This allows the inclusion not just of the essential analytical work but also applications involving the structural and functional roles of metals and metalloids. This work is directed towards understanding the metabolism of elements, their involvement in the biochemistry of molecules such as proteins and nucleic acids, and their mechanisms of action. In the period covered by this review {{we can see the}} development of several elegant but complex methods to provide for an integral approach which links the quantitative analysis with information about structural and functional activity. At a time when analytical equipment is so sophisticated it should not be necessary to ask questions on the validity of published results. However, as those who review submitted papers will appreciate, this can never be taken for granted and it has been demonstrated that the quality of data (judged by the spread of normal results) is related to the attention devoted to quality control in the written report. A number of new pieces of work were seen in this review period. Use of exhaled breath as a novel biological sample type was reported. A preconcentration column located in the arm of an autosampler used for ETAAS was applied to measurements of Pt in foods and beverages. Interferences associated with the determination of Cd in urine by ETAAS were removed with a neat piece of manipulation. The sample was placed in the furnace and Cd concentrated onto Pd modifier using an electrolytic process, after which the sample solution, together with interferents, was drawn back into the capillary and sent to waste. The popularity of ICP-MS continues to grow, largely <b>fuelled</b> by collision <b>cell</b> applications and by work on getting the right gas for the job. Following on from the considerable Pb in bone work achieved with in vivo XRF, this technique is now being used to measure Cd, although the sensitivity requires improvement if normal concentrations are to be determined. Work on selenium is as popular as ever in both the clinical and food areas, with several reviews seen and fundamental work on sample stability, extraction, speciation, bioavailability, and the identification of novel compounds in yeast and other samples, many of which involve Se/S substitutions. Selenosugars are recognised as important metabolites and now arsenosugars have been identified. In recent years we have looked without much success for data related to organically produced food but now there are some data for milk. Of 45 elements measured, Mo was increased while Ba, Eu, Mn and Zn were reduced, when compared with conventional cows milk. Among the more unusual studies seen were measurements of Pb in alligator bones and essential elements in royal jelly. Andrew Taylor, Simon Branch, Martin P.
