One program treats the fixed-stepsize linear case with complex variable solutions, and generates plots to show accuracy and error response to step driving function of a numerical solution.

40|$|International audienceThe digital {{computation}} of 3 D fields poses {{problems on}} two levels: {{there is a}} large quantity of data and many results to store; difficulties in representing 3 D objects on a <b>graphic</b> <b>terminal.</b> The Boundary Integral Equation Method (BIEM) allows us to solve certain fields problems from fictitious source densities uniquely situated over the modelized objects surface: this practically means the gain of one dimension. The numerical discretization of the integral equations is achieved by classical finite element techniques.

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis {{is concerned with the}} design and development of low cost terminals for data information systems, particularly those employing a large central computer or data storage unit served by a large number of remote <b>graphic</b> <b>terminal</b> stations. The design objective is to achieve a substantial reduction in the cost of such terminals without reduction of function. Display terminals restricted by design solely for use in alphanumeric information systems were not considered. The thesis is divided into two parts. The; first five chapters form an essay designed to set out the requirements for computing utility terminals with a review of the techniques currently espoused by manufacturers of terminal display devices. The following six chapters describe the experimental terminal that was constructed with indications of the performance obtained. The primary objective of the development, i. e., low cost of the terminal equipment required ingenuity in exploiting existing technology rather than fundamental research. An experimental approach was made to the terminal design thus emphasising the arts and skills of engineering rather than abstract science. The authors principal contributions to the development work of the project {{are to be found in}} Chapter 4 in the analysis of cost-organisation relations and in Chapters 7, 8, 9, and 10 in the design and construction of the experimental <b>graphic</b> <b>terminal</b> comprising the TV waveform generator, the terminal logic and the raster stylus.

40|$|An {{algorithm}} is described for displaying three-dimensional objects with hidden parts removed. An object {{can be regarded}} as being made up of a number of planes (e. g, a cube is formed by six square planes) and therefore the whole picture can be visualized as only a collection of planes. To complete the picture, it is necessary to remove those parts of a plane that are covered by the other planes as viewed in a certain direction, and this can be achieved by considering only two of-the planes at any one time. This paper describes a FORTRAN program for producing an isometric view of an arbitrary collection of objects as viewed in any given direction. A perspective view of the picture is also possible by using a suitable projection, and is described in a later section. The program is implemented by a PDP 11 computer using 28 k and the <b>graphic</b> <b>terminal</b> used is Tetronik 4010. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
