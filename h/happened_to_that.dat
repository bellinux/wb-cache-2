500|$|Scott Shetler of Pop Crush {{noted that}} the song was {{indirectly}} about Lopez's ex-boyfriends and husbands. He commented that the song was [...] "obviously condemning several exes" [...] and wrote [...] "A logical reading of the lyrics, though, reveals that the “bad boy” is probably Lopez’s former long-term boyfriend and Bad Boy Records founder Diddy, while the guy J. Lo danced with until saying “I do” is her second husband Cris Judd, a professional dancer and choreographer. The lyrics go on to reference two more men, who {{would seem to be}} Ben Affleck (“went nowhere but kept the ring”) and Lopez’s current husband, Marc Anthony (“he sang to me.”)" [...] Allison Stewart from The Washington Post said that [...] "One Love" [...] examines all of her high-profiled relationships, and commented that Lopez is not [...] "trying to gin up controversy with these red-meat tidbits about her personal life. She honestly thought you might be curious about Ben Affleck and whatever <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> huge engagement ring he gave her all those years ago, during Bennifer’s dark reign." ...|$|E

2500|$|Reading the words, [...] "Aaron's rod {{swallowed}} up their rods," [...] in [...] Rabbi Eleazar observed {{that it was}} a double miracle (as Aaron's serpent first became a rod again, and as a rod it {{swallowed up}} their serpents). When Pharaoh saw this, he was amazed and expressed his fear of what would happen if Moses now told the rod to swallow up Pharaoh and his throne. Rabbi Jose bar Hanina taught that a great miracle <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> rod, for although it swallowed up all the rods that had been cast down, sufficient to make ten heaps, still the rod did not all become any thicker, and all who saw it recognized it as Aaron's rod. On this account, Aaron's rod became a symbol for all the miracles and wonders that were to be performed for Israel throughout the generations.|$|E

[...] Troubled {{by the fact that}} large corporations were not donating to his SuperPAC, [...] Potter explained that corporations prefer to support political causes when the corporations can remain anonymous. [...] Therefore, he helped Colbert set up a 501(c)(4) Delaware Shell corporation in which donations can be given anonymously without limit and used for political purposes. Colbert asked what the difference was between that and money laundering. [...] Potter answered, [...] "It's hard to say." [...] On November 12, Colbert shut down his Super PAC, citing the death of his fictional advisor Ham Rove. [...] Potter advised him that by making a check with the remaining funds out to his 501(c)(4), with an [...] "Agency Letter" [...] telling it to transfer that money to a second anonymous 501(c)(4), he would not have to tell anyone - even the IRS - what <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> money.|$|E

2500|$|Tension between Wayne and American rapper, Pusha T, {{had been}} going on for years, {{beginning}} soon after Clipse and Birdman worked on [...] "What <b>Happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>That</b> Boy", the latter's 2002 single. In 2006, Wayne felt the Clipse song [...] "Mr. Me Too" [...] was directed at him which caused more tension between the two. In 2012 after much speculation that Pusha T was subliminally dissing Canadian rapper and Wayne's Young Money signee Drake in several songs, the speculation heightened after the release of Pusha T's [...] "Exodus 23:1" [...] song. Lil Wayne quickly responded on online social networking service Twitter and later released a diss track titled [...] "Goulish". In the first verse Wayne raps [...] "Fuck Pusha T and anybody that love him / His head up his ass, I'mma have to head-butt him". Pusha T has called Wayne's diss track [...] "horrible" [...] and said he felt it didn't deserve a response. Both men have downplayed the feud, with Wayne saying he's over it. However, in late November, Pusha T dissed Wayne and Birdman on a new Ludacris song titled [...] "Tell Me What They Mad For". However, once the feud between Lil Wayne and Birdman arose, Pusha T sent out a tweet encouraging Lil Wayne to sign to G.O.O.D. Music, which also insulted Birdman for his hand-rubbing habit.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the start}} of [...] (2009), the Hub is {{destroyed}} and Torchwood relocate to London as fugitives. Torchwood itself is later destroyed {{by the end of}} the serial. Fans were left asking the fate of, among other things, the Rift. The [...] of Torchwood relocates primarily to the United States. When asked in an interview with SFX magazine, Davies stated [...] "I like to think that when [...] Steven Moffat so thoughtfully closed all those cracks in the universe, the Rift in Cardiff closed up at the same time. I used to wonder what the hell <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> Rift and now it's all solved. When I watched those cracks seal up I was like, 'Oh, thank you.'" [...] This refers to the events of the 2010 Doctor Who episode [...] "The Big Bang", which was written by Steven Moffat. However, Torchwood media in 2011 since provided a direct explanation for the Rift. In the radio drama [...] "The House of the Dead", Jack visits a haunted location where the Rift allows ghosts, including the deceased Ianto Jones, to enter into the living world. To close the Rift forever and seal an ancient evil on the other side of it, Jack creates a device designed to seal the Rift. The device will also provide Jack an end to his cycle of resurrections. However, Ianto's spirit tricks Jack into leaving, and detonates the device himself, closing the Rift [...] "forever" [...] and with it the barrier between the living and the dead.|$|E
2500|$|In November 2013, Schoolboy Q {{expressed}} he {{felt there}} were no more gangsta rappers. In an interview, Schoolboy Q discussed his status as a gangsta rapper: [...] "I'm not one of them rappers that's scared to put a title on their name," [...] Schoolboy Q said during an interview with MTV." [...] Conscious rappers never like to be called conscious rappers and a lyrical rapper never like to be a party rapper. I'm a gangsta rapper, that's who I am. I happen to make fun records at the same time, that's what I do. I joke, I bag on niggas, my personality is like that, but I am a gangsta rapper and that's what I'm gonna bring to the table." [...] During the interview, Schoolboy Q then added that gangsta rappers are nowhere to be found today: [...] "There's no more gangsta rappers. It's just trap music now. So I wanna get that old feeling back that I do naturally. I'm not necessarily trying to bring gangsta rap back. I'm just trying to let you know it's still here and I'm a part of it. I feel like I'm the only one out of the coast that's doing this gangsta rap shit the way that it used to be done...how niggas used to put detail in their music, not just going to the club and turning up." [...] Schoolboy Q said {{that he is going to}} bring that style in Oxymoron: [...] "I'm just telling my story and what I grew up around and what I seen and what I did and I wanna put that in the light instead of everybody just smiling. Like Eminem said, 'Whatever happened to wildin' out and being violent? / Whatever happened to catchin a good-ol' fashioned passionate ass-whoopin' and getting your shoes coat and your hat tooken?' [...] "I'm one of them niggas," [...] Schoolboy Q continued. [...] "Whatever <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>that?</b> I don't want niggas to get beat up or no shit like that, but at the end of the day, that is a part of life and I like that type of music. That's what pushed West Coast music to where it was at like when Dre, Snoop and all them...Dogg Pound. That's what they was doin' and that's what they was talking about and that's what I was raised off of." ...|$|E

Then, though he was not of a melancholy and brooding nature, in this moment of bereavement he could not drive from his mind the consciousness that there had long been hanging over his home a dark lot, as it were, of progressive adversity.
