5|$|The convent, {{which was}} built around 1854, {{was used as the}} central {{residence}} of Jesuit missionaries in Bohol. It was built parallel to the transept and was an unusual three-storey structure, with a two-storey outdoor gallery (called a volada) and thick walls. It is the only convent in the Philippines with three storeys. An extension perpendicular to the convent was built {{in the middle of the}} 19th century. The convent was also adorned with paintings on its walls and ceilings, and with colored <b>glass</b> <b>on</b> its windows and cornices on the kitchen. The roof was replaced with galvanized iron in 1888. The third floor of the convent is now used as an ecclesiastical museum (known as Loboc Museum), containing several religious artifacts, such as a 1786 silver missal and 18th century wooden Santo Niño.|$|E
5|$|The first {{hurricane}} of {{the season}} was first noted in the central Atlantic Ocean on August21. Slowly intensifying, the system initially moved towards the west. On August22, a steamship in the vicinity was sustained some structural damage. After attaining hurricane strength on August24, the system turned northwestward, and reached Category3 intensity on August 25 with maximum sustained winds of 125mph (205km/h) as it grazed Bermuda. Recurving to the northeast, a French cruise liner encountered the hurricane while it was a Category2 hurricane. A large wave struck the ship, shattering <b>glass</b> <b>on</b> the vessel and injuring 40passengers. Although still a Category2 hurricane, the system became extratropical shortly after on August28. The extratropical storm was tracked due east towards the Azores {{for a few days}} while gradually weakening before abruptly turning to the north and dissipating.|$|E
5|$|The foyer of {{the tower}} was {{originally}} planned to be an open-air forecourt between {{the building and the}} remains of the Palace Hotel, however extensive aeroelastic wind testing of the structure by the Institute of Environmental Sciences at Murdoch University forced this area to be covered with a glass canopy. Mocks of the curtain walls {{to be used in the}} tower were also tested to 1.5 times the proof load to ensure they could withstand cyclone-force weather and seismic shocks. The building is clad with green-tinted double-pane <b>glass</b> <b>on</b> windows, with the service core and structure of the building covered with aluminium sheeting skin coated with a light grey fluoropolymer paint.|$|E

25|$|The Queen Anne {{elements}} on the house, {{influenced by}} the Eastlake principles, include: the ornamental iron fences, geometric squares and scrollwork, the etched and frosted <b>glass</b> <b>on</b> the main entrance, incised flowers {{on the porch and}} bay windows and the spindles lining the porch rails. In particular the ornamental iron fencework shows Eastlake influence in its medieval design.|$|E

His 1994 play Tulip Futures concerned Tulip mania, the 17th century speculation on tulips which nearly bankrupted the Dutch economy. Tulip Futures was nominated for the Peggy Ramsay Award.|$|E

25|$|The primary {{methods for}} {{controlling}} wind-excited sways are {{to increase the}} stiffness, or increase damping with tuned/active mass dampers. To a design by Arup, its fully triangulated perimeter structure makes the building sufficiently stiff without any extra reinforcements. Despite its overall curved glass shape, {{there is only one}} piece of curved <b>glass</b> <b>on</b> the building, the lens-shaped cap at the apex.|$|E
25|$|Mihran Mesrobian {{retired in}} the early 1950s and lived in 7410 Connecticut Avenue in Chevy Chase, Maryland in a house he {{designed}} himself in 1941.

The front facade is asymmetrical with a wall of <b>glass</b> <b>on</b> {{the right and the}} front door on the left.|$|E
25|$|The west facade has a {{basement}} entrance and tripartite window, again with diamond-paned colored <b>glass,</b> <b>on</b> the apse flanked by pointed {{windows on the}} pent-roofed sides, with another octagonal oculus in the rear gable field above where the apse projects.

In March 2013 there was a Red Nose Day tea in the chapter house, and local people played pranks, wearing their children's school uniform.|$|E
25|$|Exterior glass— The {{exterior}} <b>glass</b> <b>on</b> {{the west}} and south sides of the building provides an aesthetically pleasing view {{of the river and}} downtown and also provides natural lighting. This feature proved challenging for those designing an energy efficient structure. They found a solution with a custom-designed white dot pattern on the glass and strategically placed columns to maximize views, minimize glare and reduce solar heat gain by 50 percent.|$|E
25|$|When Ruetten {{returned}} {{home in the}} evening, he found his garage door open and broken <b>glass</b> <b>on</b> the driveway. In addition, Ruetten discovered that the BMW he had bought for Rasmussen as an engagement gift was missing. Because of her morning plans, he found it strange that Rasmussen would have later gone out without letting him know. The house's answering machine had not been activated, despite both of them usually activating it when leaving the house unoccupied.|$|E
