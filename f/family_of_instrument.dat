Ganassi gives fingerings for three recorders with different makers marks, and advises the reader to experiment with different fingerings, as recorders vary in their bore. The makers mark of one of the recorders, {{in the form of a}} stylized letter [...] "A", has been associated with the Schnitzer <b>family</b> <b>of</b> <b>instrument</b> makers in Germany, leading Hermann Moeck to suppose that Ganassi's recorder might have been Northern European in origin.

40|$|Musical {{instruments}} today {{exhibit a}} split between old and new. On one side, {{there are a}} modest number of canonical forms that have slowly evolved over millennia; they are now extremely familiar and a few can reasonably be labelled “iconic”. However, rather than idealized or even near-optimal designs, they are necessarily the product of compromise between incompatible acoustical and human factors, and therefore invariably imperfect. For some musicians and composers these limitations {{are a source of}} creative stimulation (Eno 1996; Strauss 2004), but many more rarely deeply consider their interaction possibilities — good or bad. In either case there may be little to no demand for changes {{to be made in the}} design of an individual instrument, let alone to a <b>family</b> <b>of</b> <b>instrument...</b>|$|E
