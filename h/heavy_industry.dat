5|$|The Pasadena–Baytown area, {{including}} Deer Park and La Porte, {{straddles the}} Houston Ship Channel {{and has since}} the world wars been defined by the <b>heavy</b> <b>industry</b> along its shores. The two towns have distinct histories with Baytown having become tied to the oil industry earlier and Pasadena having a longer history tied to ranching and agriculture before petrochemicals came to dominate. But in modern times their fortunes have been closely tied by their cores of <b>heavy</b> <b>industry.</b>|$|E

After World War II, industrial restructuring and the shifts in <b>heavy</b> <b>industry</b> resulted in Indiana's becoming part of the Rust Belt.|$|E

5|$|In the 1990s, after Estonia regained independence, {{the country}} {{underwent}} a {{restructuring of the}} economy, causing {{the collapse of a}} large part of the <b>heavy</b> <b>industry</b> sector. This collapse led to a decrease in the consumption of electricity and thus a decrease in the need for the oil shale that was mined to produce it. Electricity and shale oil export to former Soviet markets largely ceased. Due to a decrease in demand, the Tammiku and Sompa mines closed in 1999 and those at Kohtla and Ahtme closed in 2001.|$|E
