30|$|A country’s trade {{relation}} {{is understood}} as a product–destination pair {{in the case of}} exports and a product–supplier pair in the case of imports. Given an initial and a final period, if a pair is active in both periods it is classified as a continuing pair. If country A <b>imported</b> (<b>exported)</b> a given product from (to) country B in the first period and then does not in the second period, but it still <b>imports</b> (<b>exports)</b> the product in question from (to) a third country, we have an exit of supplier (destination). If a similar situation occurs, but in the second period the product in question is not <b>imported</b> (<b>exported)</b> from (to) any other country, then it is classified as an exit of product. If in the second period, country A <b>imports</b> (<b>exports)</b> a product that was not <b>imported</b> (<b>exported)</b> from (to) {{any other country in the}} first period, then this new relation is classified as an enter of product. If in the second period, country A starts to <b>import</b> (<b>export)</b> from (to) country B a product that was already <b>imported</b> (<b>exported)</b> in the first period from (to) a third country, then this new relation is classified as an entry of supplier (destination).|$|R
