30|$|The model shows good {{performance}} {{in predicting the}} number of daily views based on the viewership received in the previous week (p=q= 7), with an average MRE error of 15 %. The main limitation of this method {{is that it has}} a very high computational cost as it requires one ARMA model for each video. To improve the scalability of the model the authors use principal component analysis (PCA) as follows: 1) use PCA to find the main principal components that can approximate the time series for the <b>entire</b> collection <b>of</b> <b>videos</b> and 2) apply ARMA modeling to the principal components instead of the individual time series. This solution significantly improves the scalability of the model (e.g., it requires 20 ARMA models to make predictions for the <b>entire</b> collection <b>of</b> <b>videos)</b> and shows a minor decrease in the prediction accuracy (MRE = 0.12 when using individual ARMA models compared to MRE = 0.14 when using principal component analysis).|$|R

40|$|Video is an {{effective}} medium for capturing {{the events in the}} real world around us. There exist a vast amount <b>of</b> <b>video</b> materials covering a wide range of applications. However, wide spread use <b>of</b> <b>video</b> in computer applications is often impeded by the lack of effective tools to manage video information systematically. This paper discusses the design and implementation <b>of</b> a frame-based <b>video</b> retrieval and sequencing system (VRSS). The system is designed to support the <b>entire</b> process <b>of</b> <b>video</b> information management: segmenting, indexing, retrieving and sequencing <b>of</b> <b>video</b> data. A semi-automatic tool is developed to divide video sequence into meaningful shots. Each video shot is logged using text descriptions, audio dialogue and cinematic attributes. A twolayered concept-based model is used as the basis to accurately retrieve relevant video shots based on users' free-text query. A cinematic rule-based virtual editing tool is also developed to sequence the video shots retrieved for presentation within a specified time constraint. The system has been tested on a video documentary on the NUS engineering faculty. The results <b>of</b> <b>video</b> retrieval experiments are encouraging...|$|R

40|$|In Scalable Video Coding (SVC), motion {{estimation}} and inter-layer prediction {{play an important}} role in elimination of temporal and spatial redundancies between consecutive layers. This paper evaluates the performance of widely accepted block matching algorithms used in various video compression standards, with emphasis on the performance of the algorithms for a didactic scalable video codec. Many different implementations of Fast Motion Estimation Algorithms have been proposed to reduce {{motion estimation}} complexity. The block matching algorithms have been analyzed with emphasis on Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) and computations using MATLAB. In addition to the above comparisons, a survey has been done on Spiral Search Motion Estimation Algorithms for Video Coding. A New Modified Spiral Search (NMSS) motion estimation algorithm has been proposed with lower computational complexity. The proposed algorithm achieves 72 % reduction in computation with a minimal (< 1 dB) reduction in PSNR.

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{considerable}} empirical and legislative {{effort has been}} made to ensure that identification procedures by witnesses are both sensitive and fair. High sensitivity increases the likelihood of offender identification, whereas a fair method reduces the likelihood of an innocent suspect identification. In the UK, the preferred method of lineup presentation requires the witness to sequentially view the suspect and eight foils in 15 -sec video clips. The <b>entire</b> sequence <b>of</b> <b>videos</b> is viewed twice. A first experiment was designed to examine whether viewing the second video ‘lap’ induces a response bias by comparing outcomes when the sequence was shown twice with those when it was shown once. A second experiment was designed to contribute to the debate in the literature as to the relative fairness and sensitivity of sequential and simultaneous lineups in which all members are displayed at the same time. This research has primarily employed photographs. However, videos should provide more identity cues than photographs and this issue was examined by comparing outcomes of simultaneous photo and sequential photo and video lineups, as well as what {{is believed to be the}} first empirical test <b>of</b> simultaneous <b>video</b> lineups.

40|$|We present ongoing work on {{a project}} for {{automatic}} recognition of spontaneous facial actions (FACs). Current methods for automatic facial expression recognition assume images are collected in controlled environments in which the subjects deliberately face the camera. Since people often nod or turn their heads, automatic recognition of spontaneous facial behavior requires methods for handling out-of-image-plane head rotations. There are many promising approaches {{to address the problem}} of out-of-image plane rotations. In this paper we explore an approach based on 3 -D warping of images into canonical views. Since our goal is to explore the potential of this approach, we first tried with images with 8 handlabeled facial landmarks. However the approach can be generalized in a straight-forward manner to work automatically based on the output of automatic feature detectors. A front-end system was developed that jointly estimates camera parameters, head geometry and 3 -D head pose across <b>entire</b> sequences <b>of</b> <b>video</b> images. Head geometry and image parameters were assumed constant across images and 3 -D head pose is allowed to vary. First a a small set of images was used to estimate camera parameters and 3 D face geometry. Markov chain Monte-Carlo methods were then used to recover the most-likely sequence of 3 D poses given a sequence <b>of</b> <b>video</b> images. Once the 3 D pose was known, we warped each image into frontal views with a canonical face geometry. We evaluate the performance of the approach as a front-end for an spontaneous expression recognition task...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Partial caching {{of large}} media {{objects such as}} video £les has been {{proposed}} in recent proxy caching schemes, as the caching <b>of</b> <b>entire</b> <b>videos</b> can exhaust proxy storage resources within few requests. In this work the idea <b>of</b> segmenting <b>videos</b> {{into a number of}} chunks and replacement decisions be taken at the chunk level rather than based on the entire objects is adopted. In particular a video segmentation scheme called Variable Chunk Size is presented. This scheme uses the request frequencies to dynamically adjust the size of the chunk and it is shown to be capable of combining a high BHR with small response time to demand changes. Video segmentation is also considered as a mechanism to provide for caching differentiation based on access costs. By employing access cost dependent chunk sizes an overall access cost reduction is demonstrated. I...|$|R

30|$|To {{test for}} {{a link between}} gaze and change detection, we tested whether {{duration}} of gaze at pre- and post-change properties predicted change detection.

In video  2, the changing property was visible for the <b>entire</b> duration <b>of</b> the <b>video,</b> so we limited the assessed fixation durations to the 10 [*]s {{before and after the}} change. These gaze durations were entered as predictors into a generalized estimating equations analysis with video, pre-change gaze duration, and post-change gaze duration predicting change detection. Increases in post-change (X 2 (1)[*]=[*] 11.580, p[*]=[*] 0.001) but not pre-change (X 2 (1)[*]=[*] 1.246, p[*]=[*] 0.264) gaze duration significantly predicted increased change detection.|$|R
50|$|As {{noted above}} BPP {{represents}} the average bits per pixel.

This CBR video is suitable for real-time, non-buffered, fixed bandwidth video streaming (e.g. in videoconferencing). Noting that not all frames can be compressed {{at the same level}} because quality is more severely impacted for scenes of high complexity some algorithms try to constantly adjust the BPP. They keep it high while compressing complex scenes and low for less demanding scenes. This way one gets the best quality at the smallest average bit rate (and the smallest file size accordingly). Of course when using this method the bit rate is variable because it tracks the variations of the BPP.|$|R
