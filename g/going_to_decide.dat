5|$|After {{two people}} find Chip Diller (David Tom), the {{president}} of the Pig Sigma fraternity, passed out, Veronica gets hired as a photographer for the Hearst newspaper. Logan (Jason Dohring) requests that Veronica stop looking into the serial rapist case, but she denies and they fight. The Hearst board of trustees is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> whether or not to shut down the fraternities, but an important member, Selma Rose, goes missing {{in the middle of the}} party. Dean O’Dell (Ed Begley, Jr.) immediately believes that she’s gone missing, asking Veronica and Keith to help.

Veronica speaks to Dick (Ryan Hansen), who says that Chip Diller had a Roman numeral easter egg implanted in his anus, and Veronica suspects the Lilith House girls.|$|E

The gods of the four corners of the world are reunited to talk about [...] "the future matters of the East" [...] ("as cousas futuras do Oriente"); in fact, what they are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> is whether the Portuguese will be allowed to reach India and what will happen next.|$|E
2500|$|On 17 February 2008, Kosovo {{declared}} {{its independence from}} Serbia, a move Serbia rejects. Kosovo has been recognized by {{a substantial number of}} UN members, including the United States and most members of the European Union, but not by Israel. At the time of the declaration, an Israeli Foreign Ministry official stated: [...] "We haven't decided when we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>decide,</b> and instead will monitor events and consider the issue". Israel is reluctant to recognize Kosovo's independence, {{in part because of the}} possibility of Palestinians using recognition of Kosovo to justify their own unilateral declaration of independence.|$|E

Asked whether Obama's proposed $250,000 tax threshold would affect him, Wurzelbacher replied: [...] "Not right now at presently, but (...) he's going to do that now for people who make $250,000 a year. When's he <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> that $100,000 is too much? (...) You're on a slippery slope here. You vote on somebody who decides that $250,000 and you're rich?

2500|$|... 11 bullets is a {{very bad}} cricket team of North Kolkata. The team is formed {{with the people of}} the {{locality}}, who have various professions. The film starts with a match between 11 bullets and a cricket team of South Kolkata. The hero, named Abir, alone smashes 11 bullets. The team members of 11 bullets are then abused by the people of their locality. In the meantime, Abir comes with his family to stay at Dorjipara, which is the locality of 11 bullets. But, due to huge cultural deference between North Kolkata and South Kolkata, Abir becomes irritated to stay over there. The niece of the landlord of Abir's tenant house, stars having regular quarrels with Abir. Then one day, Abir comes to know that some political leader is trying to grab Dorjipara, and for that, the leader wants the tenant house, which the landlord doesn't want to sell. When Abir teaches the 11 bullets people, that without protesting against these political evils, {{they will not be able}} to survive, slowly, those people come close to Abir, and vice versa. Then slowly, Abir gets intimate with Rani, which her brother Rajat doesn't like. A Person, Shankar, who is attached to that leader comes and gets involved with the unmarried, frustrated, elder sister of Rani, named Ratna. But, when Shankar says that, he wants to marry Rani, and not Ratna. Then Ratna commits suicide.

2500|$|Death is {{inevitable}} and temporally unpredictable. Kierkegaard believed that individuals needed to sincerely and intensely come to realize the truth of that fact {{in order to live}} passionately. Kierkegaard accuses society of being in death-denial. Even though people see death all around them and grasp as an objective fact that everyone dies, few people truly understand, subjectively and inwardly, that they will die someday. For example, in Concluding Unscientific Postscript, Kierkegaard notes that people never think to say, [...] "I shall certainly attend your party, but I must make an exception for the contingency that a roof tile happens to blow down and kill me; for in that case, I cannot attend." [...] This is jest as far as Kierkegaard is concerned. But there is also earnestness involved in the thought of death. Kierkegaard said the following about death in his Three Upbuilding Discourses, 1844. [...] We shall not decide which life fights the good fight most easily, but we all agree that every human being ought to fight the good fight, from which no one is shut out, and yet this is so glorious that if it were granted only once to a past generation under exceptional circumstances-yes, what a description envy and discouragement would then know how to give! The difference is about the same as that in connection with the thought of death. As soon as a human being is born, he begins to die. But the difference is that there are some people for whom the thought of death comes into existence with birth and is present to them in the quiet peacefulness of childhood and the buoyancy of youth; whereas others have a period in which this thought is not present to them until, when the years run out, the years of vigor and vitality, the thought of death meets them on their way. Who, now, is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> which life was easier, whether it was the [...] life of those who continually lived with a certain reserve because the thought of death was present to them or the life of those who so abandoned themselves to life that they almost forgot the existence of death? ...|$|E

5000|$|There was {{speculation}} that the right foot injury Wang sustained during the 2008 season caused him to compensate {{with the rest of}} his pitching motion, leading to his 2009 struggles. Following the April 18 game manager Joe Girardi said, [...] "We have some time. We have a day off, I think Thursday, and we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> what's best for Chien-Ming Wang and the team." [...] On April 22, General Manager Brian Cashman, at a Q&A at Southern Connecticut State University, confirmed Wang's release point was 5 inches higher than the same time the previous season.|$|R

25|$|Both Championships were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>decided</b> in Australia and Mansell took pole {{ahead of}} Schumacher, Hill, Häkkinen, Barrichello and Irvine.

Schumacher and Hill, separated by a second pulled away at an astonishing rate from the field.|$|R

5000|$|In July 2006, Val was {{contacted}} by Playboy about doing a centerfold for the magazine.

And it's just these trifles, as far as I can make out, that are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> the thing." ...|$|E

60|$|Nathan Dresser is here, {{and speaks}} {{as though the}} contest between Hardin and me is to be {{doubtful}} in Menard County. I know he is candid and this alarms me some.

You remember you wrote me that he would be neutral. Nathan also said that some man, whom he could not remember, had said lately that Menard County was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> the contest and that made the contest very doubtful.

60|$|And so {{the long}} day faded itself {{away in the}} hot sweltering court, and his lordship, at about seven o'clock, {{declared}} his intention of adjourning. Of course a cause célèbre such as this was not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> itself in one day. Alaric's guilt was clear as daylight to all concerned; but {{a man who had}} risen to be a Civil Service Commissioner, and to be entrusted with the guardianship of twenty thousand pounds, was not to be treated like a butcher who had merely smothered his wife in an ordinary way, or a housebreaker who had followed his professional career to its natural end; more than that was due to the rank and station of the man, and to the very respectable retaining fee with which Mr. Gitemthruet had found himself enabled to secure the venom of Mr. Chaffanbrass. So the jury retired to regale themselves en masse at a neighbouring coffee-house; Alaric was again permitted to be at large on bail (the amiable policeman in mufti still attending him at a distance); and Mr. Chaffanbrass and his lordship retired to prepare themselves by rest for the morrow's labours.|$|E
