40|$|We {{manipulated}} {{two variables}} predicted by models of team performance to affect team processes and performance: team organization and task load. In one team organization the team leader {{served as a}} manager only, without responsibility for prosecuting <b>hostile</b> <b>tracks.</b> In the other organization the team leader served as a player-manager. Task load was established by varying the number of <b>hostile</b> <b>tracks.</b> As hypothesized, teams performed at a higher level, that is took less time to act, when task load was low than high. Counter to predictions no performance {{differences were found between}} the two team organization conditions, but as anticipated, performance differed among team members by task load. Additionally, teams in which the team leader was a manager only were more proactive and transferred more information to other teammates without requests to do so, a communication pattern that has been shown to be indicative of high-performing teams...|$|R

60|$|A dozen {{voices were}} {{instantly}} raised in objections to this proposal.

30|$|Third, {{because all}} hostile {{aircraft}} were programmed {{to hit the}} ship, participants were instructed to defend the ship against <b>hostile</b> <b>tracks</b> by launching an anti-aircraft missile. In real life, of course, there would be many safeguards and intermediate steps before an aircraft could be engaged; however, this was substantially simplified {{for the purpose of}} our experiment and required participants only to select the aircraft they wanted to neutralize and then click on the “Engage” button to launch the missile. The weapon was represented by a small white dot on the radar screen. Only one anti-aircraft missile projectile could be airborne at one time.|$|R
50|$|RISAT-2 is India's first heavy {{satellite}} with {{a synthetic}} aperture radar. It possess day-night {{as well as}} all-weather monitoring capability. Potential applications include <b>tracking</b> <b>hostile</b> ships at sea that are deemed a military threat to India.|$|R
50|$|In {{military}} airborne applications, the Doppler {{effect has}} 2 main advantages. Firstly, the radar is more robust against counter-measure. Return signals from weather, terrain, and countermeasures like chaff are filtered out before detection, which reduces computer and operator loading in hostile environments. Secondly, against a low altitude target, filtering on the radial speed {{is a very}} effective way to eliminate the ground clutter that always has a null speed. Low-flying military plane with countermeasure alert for <b>hostile</b> radar <b>track</b> acquisition can turn perpendicular to the hostile radar to nullify its Doppler frequency, which usually breaks the lock and drives the radar off by hiding against the ground return which is much larger.|$|R
5|$|The {{gameplay}} of Snake Eater {{is similar}} to that of previous games in the Metal Gear Solid series. Snake, controlled by the player, must move undetected through a hostile, enemy-filled environment. Although Snake acquires various weapons (ranging from handguns to rocket propelled grenades), the emphasis is on using stealth to avoid confrontations. A number of objects and gadgets can be found along the way to aid in this, including motion detectors to <b>track</b> <b>hostile</b> soldiers, and the Metal Gear series' trademark cardboard box, which Snake can hide under to avoid visual detection.|$|R
50|$|Church {{was allowed}} to recruit Native Americans after he and other leaders {{realized}} that traditional European military tactics were ineffective in frontier warfare. He also persuaded many neutral or formerly hostile Indians to surrender and join his unit, where they operated skillfully as irregular troops. Some of these men had converted to Christianity in settlements before the war. They were known as Praying Indians. After being organized by Church, these troops <b>tracked</b> <b>hostile</b> Indians into the forests and swamps, and conducted effective raids and ambushes on their camps.|$|R

5000|$|The ARTHUR detects <b>hostile</b> {{artillery}} by <b>tracking</b> projectiles in flight. The original ARTHUR Mod A {{can locate}} guns at 15 - 20 km and 120 mm mortars at 30 - 35 km with a {{circular error probable}} of 0.45% of range. This is accurate enough for effective counter-battery fire by friendly artillery batteries. ARTHUR can operate as a stand-alone medium-range weapons locating radar or a long-range weapon locating system, consisting of two to four radars working in coordination. This flexibility enables the system to maintain a constant surveillance of an area of interest.|$|R

5000|$|The {{majority}} of the airships operated by the US Army during the 1920s and 30s were of the [...] "TC" [...] Class, designed for coastal patrol duty, because the US Army had long held the primary responsibility for coastal and harbor defense of the USA. The airship was seen as capable of searching for <b>hostile</b> ships and <b>tracking</b> those ships until they could be engaged by coastal defenses or Army bombers. One TC class blimp, the C-41, was used for various public relation experiments in the 1930s, including landing on the Washington D.C. mall to lay a wreath at the Lincoln Memorial and experimenting with picking up mail from a moving train.|$|R
5000|$|The South African Hunter Group {{was formed}} in 1968, and renamed the Reconnaissance Commando Reserve in 1976. Combat tracker and bushcraft {{instruction}} was provided to an exemplary few, though this meant extending training by a harsh twelve months.

The success of this unit culminated {{in the formation of}} the subsequent 1 Reconnaissance Commando near Oudtshoorn on 1 October 1972. Operators in the aptly named [...] "1 Recce" [...] had to be capable of collecting intelligence at great distances behind <b>hostile</b> lines while <b>tracking</b> larger enemy units. In 1976 its headquarters, the Reconnaissance Commando School, was founded and the laurel blade emblem was adopted, along with the motto, [...] "We fear naught but God".|$|R

50|$|Enlisted Crow Scouts {{were first}} {{used by the}} United States Army in 1876 during the Great Sioux War. Because the Crow tribe was {{peaceful}} with the Americans and in particular, because parts of the old Crow country was flooded with hostile Lakotas, Northern Cheyennes and Arapahoes (Northern Arapaho), the army was able to enlist Crow warriors to help <b>track</b> <b>hostile</b> Native Americans. Already in 1873, the Crows had called for U.S. military actions against the Indian invaders in the Crow reservation. They were just waiting to offer their expertise. A small group of Crow scouts witnessed General George A. Custer's defeat at the Battle of the Little Bighorn in the Crow reservation. Many Crows served against the Nez Percés in 1877, {{and again in the}} Bannock War the next year. Crow scouts rode along with Assiniboines, Bannocks and Cheyennes during Colonel Nelson A. Miles search for Sitting Bull north of the Missouri in 1879. Some former scouts fought in the Crow War of 1887.|$|R
40|$|Plan {{recognition}} {{is the problem}} of inferring an agent’s hidden state of plans, or intentions, based on the pattern of his observable actions. Among many potential applications, intention recognition can be particularly useful for intelligence analysis and homeland security related problems. While most of the existing work in plan recognition has focused on studying overt agents, problems from the intelligence domain usually have different settings, where hostile agents operate covertly in a large population of otherwise benign entities. In this paper we formulate a problem of detecting and <b>tracking</b> <b>hostile</b> intentions in such an environment − a virtual world where a large number of agents are involved in individual and collective activities. Most of the agents are benign, while a small number of them have malicious intent. We describe our initial effort for building a probabilistic framework for detecting hostile activities in this system, and provide some initial results for simple scenarios...|$|R
5|$|Following peak intensity, Saomai's eye became cloud-filled, and {{the storm}} {{began to develop}} {{concentric}} eyewalls. Shortly after 1000UTC on September12, the typhoon made landfall on central Okinawa, Japan with sustained winds of 140km/h (85mph) and a pressure of 945mbar (hPa; 27.91inHg). Saomai quickly passed over the island, and concurrently its weakening phase came to a halt. After tracking into the East China Sea, the typhoon began to track towards the northeast {{in response to a}} mid-latitude trough. At its westernmost point along its track, Saomai was located approximately 345km (215mi) east of Wenzhou, China. Atmospheric conditions became increasingly more <b>hostile</b> as Saomai <b>tracked</b> northeast, and the typhoon became elongated and ragged in appearance. At 1200UTC on September15, Saomai was downgraded to severe tropical storm intensity as the cyclone began to undergo extratropical transition. At around 2030UTC that day, Saomai made its final landfall as a tropical system west of Pusan, South Korea; after emerging into the Yellow Sea the storm was declared extratropical at 0600UTC the next day. These remnants later tracked inland near Vladivostok, Russia before dissipating on September19.|$|R

30|$|ZnO is {{emerging}} as a potential candidate due to its direct wide bandgap {{and its ability to}} tailor electronic, magnetic, and optical properties through doping and alloying. One significant property that has brought ZnO and its alloys with Mg to the forefront of a flurry of research activity is the large exciton binding energy (60 meV when compared to 25 meV for GaN) for use in UV lasers. ZnO has been widely reported as a visible-blind UV sensor [7] over a wide range of applications in military and non-military arenas [8] that includes missile plume detection for <b>hostile</b> missile <b>tracking,</b> flame sensors, UV source monitoring, and calibration. However, recent research in nanostructures of ZnO has proved that the reduced dimensions have the potential to provide more untapped properties if harnessed in a systematic manner. Many simple fabrication techniques [9], devices [10, 11], and applications [12] have been demonstrated and reproduced. ZnO nanoscale structures such as one-dimensional nanowires are attracting more attention because of their enormous potential as fundamental building blocks for nanoscale electronic [13] and photonic devices due to the enhanced sensitivity offered by quantum confinement effects [14]. In this work, we address the prominent defect-related property (could be sum or individual defects due to non-crystallinity, surface charge imbalance, or substrate to film interface strains) that affects the electrical properties of the ensuing device. The phenomenon of persistent photoconductivity (PPC) is a situation in which a photo-induced current in the device continues to flow even after the exciting photon source is turned off. PPC is a major issue in device operation that became a topic of intense research interest during development of GaN [15, 16] and AlGaN [17] photodetectors. The motivation of the present work is to understand the origin of PPC in ZnO by employing a simple device configuration consisting of a metal–semiconductor–metal structure. PPC is very difficult to observe in bulk materials and needs to be measured at very low temperature, which in turn complicates the carrier transport mechanisms, thus limiting the ability to extract and interpret the exact cause of the problem [18]. This phenomenon is observable in both macro and nanostructured films; however, the effects are more prominent in nanostructured materials due to singularity in their joint density of states, thus allowing a bulk phenomenon to be observable clearly even at room temperature.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{advances}} in integrated electronic devices motivated {{the use of}} Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) in many applications including domain surveillance and mobile target tracking, where a number of sensors are scattered within a sensitive region to detect the presence of intruders and forward related events to some analysis center(s). Obviously, sensor deployment should guarantee an optimal event detection rate and should reduce coverage holes. Most of the coverage control approaches proposed in the literature deal with two-dimensional zones and do not develop strategies to handle coverage in three-dimensional domains, which is becoming a requirement for many applications including water monitoring, indoor surveillance, and projectile tracking. This paper proposes efficient techniques to detect coverage holes in a 3 D domain using a finite set of sensors, repair the holes, and <b>track</b> <b>hostile</b> targets. To this end, we use the concepts of Voronoi tessellation, Vietoris complex, and retract by deformation. We show in particular that, {{through a set of}} iterative transformations of the Vietoris complex corresponding to the deployed sensors, the number of coverage holes can be computed with a low complexity. Mobility strategies are also proposed to repair holes by moving appropriately sensors towards the uncovered zones. The tracking objective is to set a non-uniform WSN coverage within the monitored domain to allow detecting the target(s) by the set of sensors. We show, in particular, how the proposed algorithms adapt to cope with obstacles. Simulation experiments are carried out to analyze the efficiency of the proposed models. To our knowledge, repairing and tracking is addressed {{for the first time in}} 3 D spaces with different sensor coverage schemes...|$|R
