2500|$|In flash memory, each {{memory cell}} resembles a {{standard}} MOSFET, {{except that the}} transistor has two gates instead of one. On top is the control gate (CG), as in other MOS transistors, but below this there is a <b>floating</b> <b>gate</b> (FG) insulated all around by an oxide layer. The FG is interposed between the CG and the MOSFET channel. Because the FG is electrically isolated by its insulating layer, electrons placed on it are trapped until they are removed by another application of electric field (e.g. Applied voltage or UV as in EPROM). Counter-intuitively, placing electrons on the FG sets the transistor to the logical [...] "0" [...] state. Once the FG is charged, the electrons in it screen (partially cancel) the electric field from the CG, thus, increasing the threshold voltage (VT1) of the cell. This means that now a higher voltage(VT2) must {{be applied to the}} CG to make the channel conductive. In order to read a value from the transistor, an intermediate voltage between the threshold voltages (VT1 & VT2) is applied to the CG. If the channel conducts at this intermediate voltage, the FG must be uncharged (if it was charged, we would not get conduction because the intermediate voltage is less than VT2), and hence, a logical [...] "1" [...] is stored in the gate. If the channel does not conduct at the intermediate voltage, it indicates that the FG is charged, and hence, a logical [...] "0" [...] is stored in the gate. The presence of a logical [...] "0" [...] or [...] "1" [...] is sensed by determining whether there is current flowing through the transistor when the intermediate voltage is asserted on the CG. In a multi-level cell device, which stores more than one bit per cell, the amount of current flow is sensed (rather than simply its presence or absence), in order to determine more precisely the level of charge on the FG.|$|E

50|$|Both <b>floating</b> <b>gate</b> {{flash and}} charge {{trapping}} flash use a stacked gate structure {{in which a}} <b>floating</b> <b>gate</b> or charge trapping layer lies immediately above the channel, and below a control gate. The <b>floating</b> <b>gate</b> or charge trapping layer is insulated from the channel by a tunnel oxide layer and from the control gate by a gate oxide layer. Materials {{for all of these}} layers are the same {{with the exception of the}} storage layer, which is conductive polysilicon for the <b>floating</b> <b>gate</b> structure and is typically silicon nitride for the charge trap.|$|E
50|$|As {{processes}} {{continue to}} shrink, this becomes increasingly problematic. For this reason the control gate in modern NAND flash has been reconfigured to cap the <b>floating</b> <b>gate.</b> In a cap structure the control gate is extended {{to form a}} barrier between adjacent floating gates in a conventional <b>floating</b> <b>gate</b> cell (see Figure 5.) This serves to reduce coupling to the adjacent <b>floating</b> <b>gate</b> while increasing the coupling between the <b>floating</b> <b>gate</b> and the control gate. One drawback is that the control gate couples to the channel, so measures {{must be taken to}} minimize this coupling.|$|E
50|$|The light {{produced}} by germicidal lamps {{is also used}} to erase EPROMs; the ultraviolet photons are sufficiently energetic to allow the electrons trapped on the transistors' <b>floating</b> <b>gates</b> to tunnel through the gate insulation, eventually removing the stored charge that represents binary ones and zeroes.|$|R

5000|$|Basic OperationAs {{shown in}} Fig.2, the FJG device {{generally}} consists of one <b>floating</b> <b>gate</b> NMOS and one MOS gated diode. The <b>floating</b> <b>gate</b> NMOS has different threshold voltages at different logic states. By charging or discharging the <b>floating</b> <b>gate</b> via the current {{path through the}} gated diode, the threshold voltage of the <b>floating</b> <b>gate</b> NMOS is changed. Since the <b>floating</b> <b>gate</b> is connected to a p-n junction, this cell is called a [...] "floating junction gate (FJG)" [...] cell. When reading the cell, with the same voltage conditions on the control gate, the NMOS has different sense current at different logic states.

50|$|Flash {{is based}} on the <b>floating</b> <b>gate</b> concept, {{essentially}} a modified transistor. Conventional flash transistors have three connections, the source, drain and gate. The gate is the essential component of the transistor, controlling the resistance between the source and drain, and thereby acting as a switch. In the <b>floating</b> <b>gate</b> transistor, the gate is attached to a layer that traps electrons, leaving it switched on (or off) for extended periods of time. The <b>floating</b> <b>gate</b> can be re-written by passing a large current through the emitter-collector circuit.|$|E

30|$|Although {{conventional}} (continuous) floating-gate {{memory is}} the major technical advancement, there are many challenges as device scaling continues [35]. First, the tunneling layer thickness should be reduced, but itis very difficult to have a thin layer with sufficient charge retention and stress-induced leakage current characteristics. Other requirements also {{should be considered as}} the distance between layers becomes closer, such as the decrease of the coupling ratio owing to the increased parasitic capacitance and increased cell-to-cell interference. The scaling down of tunneling layer thickness can decrease the memory window margin as well as resulting in VTh shift of memory cell [36]. Furthermore, with the smaller dimensions of <b>floating</b> <b>gates,</b> the amount of charge stored is reduced, resulting in very tight margins for the memory window. Therefore, many {{attempts have been made to}} solve these problems by inserting metal NPs into the storage layer. In this case, the problem originating from the use of continuous conducting <b>floating</b> <b>gates</b> can be effectively solved.|$|R

50|$|NAND flash {{has been}} scaling very aggressively (Figure 4.) As {{processes}} migrate, {{the width of}} the interface of the control gate and the <b>floating</b> <b>gate</b> shrinks in proportion to the square of the shrink, and the spacing between floating gates shrinks in proportion to the process shrink, but the floating gate’s thickness remains the same. (The thinner the <b>floating</b> <b>gate</b> is made the less tolerant the cell becomes to electron loss.) This means that the coupling between adjacent floating gates becomes larger than the coupling between the control gate and the <b>floating</b> <b>gate,</b> leading to data corruption between adjacent bits.|$|E
50|$|Like the <b>floating</b> <b>gate</b> memory cell, {{a charge}} {{trapping}} cell uses a variable charge between the control gate {{and the channel}} to change the threshold voltage of the transistor. The mechanisms to modify this charge are relatively similar between the <b>floating</b> <b>gate</b> and the charge trap, and the read mechanisms are also very similar.|$|E

This is the root cause of flash wear-out (see Flash memory#Memory wear), which is specified as the chip’s “endurance.” In order to reduce the occurrence of such short circuits, <b>floating</b> <b>gate</b> flash is manufactured using a thick tunnel oxide (~100Å), but this slows erase when Fowler-Nordheim tunneling is used and forces the design to use a higher tunneling voltage, which puts new burdens on other parts of the chip.|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} 4 {{different}} ultra low voltage (ULV) flip-flops are presented. <b>Floating</b> <b>gates</b> {{has been exploited}} to significantly increase the drain-source current. This technique has proved to decrease the delay significantly and shown that these flip-flops can perform at high speed operations for near subthreshold voltages (300 mV). The ULV flip-flops proved to be faster, with a delay up to 20 times faster, than other flip-flop topologies presented in this thesis. The ULV flip-flops also proved to have very little setup and hold times. With regards to yield, the ULV flip-flops proved to be better at higher frequencies, above 1 MHz, than the other flip-flop topologies. One of the ULV flip-flops outperformed the others with a much better yield at all frequencies and supply voltages. In terms of EDP the ULV flip-flops revealed very good properties. Overall the ULV flips-flops had significantly better EDP, at all frequencies and all supply voltages, than the comparison flip-flop. One of the flip-flops has been selected for layout design. For the layout the <b>floating</b> <b>gates</b> have been implemented by using MIM capacitors to create crosstalk between two metal strips in the same layer.
