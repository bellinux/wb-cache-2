5|$|In 1982, Ian Gillan {{announced}} the band would fold, as {{he needed to}} rest his damaged vocal cords. The tone and style of his singing changed considerably when he eventually returned. <b>His</b> <b>voice</b> <b>had</b> a more nasal tone and this can be heard on albums he has made from 1983 to the present day. His use of multi-tracked backing vocals also became highly prominent. The rest of the band Gillan, particularly McCoy and Towns, were not happy at the sudden disbanding of the group so soon after the success of Magic, and sued Gillan for royalties.|$|E

25|$|The game is not {{a direct}} {{adaptation}} of the 1983 film directed by Brian De Palma, but is instead an unofficial pseudo-sequel which changes {{the end of the}} film so that Tony Montana (originally played by Al Pacino) survives, and sets about exacting revenge on those who ousted him from power by re-establishing his drug empire in Miami. The game features Al Pacino's likeness in the character of Montana, but Pacino does not voice the character, as he and the game's producers felt <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> <b>had</b> changed too much since 1983. Instead, Montana is voiced by André Sogliuzzo, who was personally selected by Pacino himself. Actors from the original film who did voice work for the game include Steven Bauer, Robert Loggia and Al Israel.|$|E

25|$|In April 1970, Lake left King Crimson and {{reunited with}} Emerson, along with drummer Carl Palmer of The Crazy World of Arthur Brown and Atomic Rooster {{to form the}} {{progressive}} rock supergroup, Emerson, Lake & Palmer. Lake began with a Fender bass before he switched to a Gibson Ripper. As well as bass, Lake contributed acoustic and electric guitar work to Emerson Lake & Palmer, and <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> <b>had</b> a wider and more diverse range than anything The Nice had recorded. Emerson, Lake & Palmer {{became one of the}} most successful groups in the 1970s. Lake became known for performing on a Persian carpet on stage, which originally sold for £1,500 and, by 1976, had increased its value to £7,000. In addition, Lake would change his guitar strings after each show on tour.|$|E
25|$|Efron’s career {{reached a}} turning point with the teen musical {{television}} film High School Musical (2006), which premiered on the Disney Channel in January 2006. The film, which {{has been described as}} a modern adaptation of Romeo and Juliet, saw Efron playing the male lead Troy Bolton, a high school basketball player who feels conflicted when he finds himself interested in participating in the school musical with Gabriella Montez (Vanessa Hudgens), a girl from the scholastic decathlon team. The film, which also starred Ashley Tisdale, Lucas Grabeel, Corbin Bleu, and Monique Coleman in pivotal roles, became a major success and helped Efron gain recognition among teenage audiences. The film’s soundtrack was certified quadruple platinum by the RIAA, making it one of the best-selling albums of the year in the United States. Efron’s singing talents were disputed when it was revealed that <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> <b>had</b> been blended with Drew Seeley’s on the soundtrack, but Efron clarified that the songs (written for a tenor) were written before he was cast and therefore did not suit his more baritone vocal range. In his subsequent musical films, Efron did his own singing.|$|E
25|$|Two {{institutions}} may be {{said even}} under the Second Empire to have retained their freedom: the Institute of France and the Protestant Consistory. In both of these Guizot continued to the last {{to take an active}} part. He was a member of three of the five academies into which the Institute of France is divided. The Academy of Moral and Political Science owed its restoration to him, and he became in 1832 one of its first associates. The Academy of Inscriptions and Belles Lettres elected him in 1833 as the successor to Dacier, and in 1836 he was chosen a member of the Académie Française, the highest literary distinction of the country. In these learned bodies Guizot continued for nearly forty years to take a lively interest and to exercise a powerful influence. He was the jealous champion of their independence. <b>His</b> <b>voice</b> <b>had</b> the greatest weight in the choice of new candidates; the younger generation of French writers never looked in vain to him for encouragement, and his constant aim was to maintain the dignity and purity of the profession of letters. In 1842, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, and a foreign honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1855.|$|E

500|$|In September 2009, Johnston {{announced}} that he would be taking a year off from singing as <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> <b>had</b> broken, changing him to a tenor. He had previously performed as a treble. He said [...] "the tutors at [...] said they'll be able to train my voice up again. It's the same as it ever was, just deeper". Johnston's voice then changed from a tenor to a baritone. After remaining out of the spotlight for two years, he joined the National Youth Choir, saying [...] "I'm just another lad in there – no one focuses on Britain's Got Talent and I'm happy about that". In 2011, he was awarded a Royal School of Church Music Gold medal; public performances that year included a charitable concert, alongside organists John Bromley and Tony Green, at St Paul's Church, Helsby in November.|$|E
500|$|The album {{features}} four guest artists; Rakim {{from the}} hip hop duo Eric B. & Rakim on [...] "Guilty All the Same", Page Hamilton from the American alternative metal band Helmet on [...] "All for Nothing", Daron Malakian from System of a Down for the song [...] "Rebellion" [...] and Tom Morello of Rage Against the Machine fame on the song [...] "Drawbar". Bennington commented on the collaborations, stating that [...] "We really felt like {{if we need to}} be inspired and move in another direction. I think when we got Page in, Mike had written this chorus and sang it, and <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> <b>had</b> this tone, and it was unlike anything I'd heard from him before. And I was like, [...] "Dude this is crazy, this sounds like a Helmet song! It's cool!" [...] And we were like, [...] "Dude, why don't we {{see if we can get}} like Page in here?" [...] You know? And if that's why the song says it's feeling like it should be, then why don't we just go straight to the source".|$|E
500|$|Mullen and The Edge both {{agreed that}} playing the Sarajevo concert {{had been the}} {{highlight}} of their careers; Mullen said, [...] "here's no doubt that that is an experience I will never forget {{for the rest of}} my life. And if I had to spend 20 years in the band just to play that show, [...] I think it would have been worthwhile." [...] Bono described it as [...] "one of the toughest and one of the sweetest nights of my life", saying of the audience, [...] "I think they wanted, more than anything, a return to normalcy. That's what these people want, it's what they deserve." [...] He also speculated that the loss of <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> <b>had</b> [...] "allowed room for Sarajevo to take the gig away from us. They could see that things could go horribly wrong, they'd gone to a lot of trouble to come here, and they were just going to make it happen. And they did." [...] After the completion of the PopMart Tour, he said, [...] "it was amazing and confounding to discover that on our most 'pop' of tours some of the best shows were in political hotspots like Santiago, Sarajevo, Tel Aviv [...] anywhere music meant more than entertainment". Following the concert, President Izetbegović presented Bono with an honorary Bosnian passport, in recognition of his humanitarian efforts during the war.|$|E

500|$|A {{key feature}} of Sgt. Pepper is Martin and Emerick's liberal use of signal {{processing}} {{to shape the}} sound of the recording, which included the application of dynamic range compression, reverberation and signal limiting. Relatively new modular effects units were used, such as running voices and instruments through a Leslie speaker. Several innovative production techniques feature prominently on the recordings, including direct injection, pitch control and ambiophonics. Another is automatic double tracking (ADT), a system that uses tape recorders to create a simultaneous doubling of a sound. Although it had long been recognised that using multitrack tape to record doubled lead vocals produced an enhanced sound, before ADT it had been necessary to record such vocal tracks twice, a task that was both tedious and exacting. ADT was invented by Townsend during the Revolver sessions in 1966 especially for the Beatles, who disliked tracking sessions and regularly expressed a desire for a technical solution to the problem. The process soon became a common recording practice in popular music. Martin playfully explained to Lennon that <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> <b>had</b> been [...] "treated with a double vibrocated sploshing flange... It doubles your voice, John." [...] Lennon realised that Martin was joking, but from that point on he referred to the effect as flanging, a label that was universally adopted by the music industry. Another important effect was varispeeding. Martin cites [...] "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds" [...] as having the most variations of tape speed on Sgt. Pepper. During the recording of Lennon's vocals, the tape speed was reduced from 50 cycles per second to 45, which produced a higher and thinner-sounding track when played back at the normal speed.|$|E
2500|$|Although Lytton {{had played}} lyric {{baritone}} roles in his earlier years, by the 1920s <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> <b>had</b> deteriorated {{to the point}} that he was not included in most of the D'Oyly Carte recordings of the period. [...] As The Times noted in its 20 September 1926 review of the refurbished Mikado production, Lytton [...] "shows more respect for Gilbert's words than for Sullivan's notes, though he still manages to give the gist even of the latter." [...] Lytton was knighted in 1930, the only person to receive the accolade for achievements as a Gilbert and Sullivan performer.|$|E

2500|$|For {{the opening}} {{night of the}} {{following}} Met season, Domingo returned {{to the role of}} Wagner's Lohengrin, which he had last sung in early 1968. He had originally dropped the role from his repertoire after he felt <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> <b>had</b> been temporarily damaged by learning the challenging opera. The New York Times noted that the now more mature artist [...] "lacked the chrome-plated, penetrating quality that one associates with German tenors", but praised him for bringing [...] "an unusual legato grace to a role that is seldom sung so beautifully". He also performed the role at the Vienna State Opera in 1985 and 1990. A performance during his last run of the opera was televised on 28 January 1990 and later released on VHS and DVD. He had just recovered from the flu at the time.|$|E
2500|$|In 1909, {{the great}} Italian tenor, Enrico Caruso, {{performed}} at the Free Trade Hall in Manchester. The concert was attended by one William Grimshaw, a gramophone salesman from Prestwich {{and a few days}} later, he took his gramophone to Heaton Park and played recordings of the songs performed by Caruso to an assembled crowd of 40,000 people who, according to the Prestwich and Heaton Park Guardian, [...] "remained as if spellbound from the moment of arrival to the close of the programme, which, it is hardly necessary to say, was intensely enjoyed." [...] Caruso later wrote to Mr. Grimshaw to thank him for the way <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> <b>had</b> been reproduced, sending him a signed cartoon of himself. Grimshaw was the first person in Britain to give gramophone concerts in the open, an idea which soon spread across the country. The concerts were carried on for several seasons and as they grew in popularity, Grimshaw became known across Lancashire as the [...] "Gramophone King" ...|$|E
2500|$|Overall, {{reception}} of the album was positive. Allmusic's Zac Johnson called the album [...] "spectacular", [...] "brimming over with Wainwright's trademark popera and young romantic wishes." [...] He further described Poses as [...] "beautifully discordant and sonically chilling", but an album that [...] "often hints at warm grins with mischievous winks." [...] In his review for Pitchfork, Joe Tangari characterized Poses as an [...] "epic album that speaks with grand gestures and a refined eloquence rare in young songwriters." [...] In addition, Tangari complimented Wainwright's ability to express himself and suggested that <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> <b>had</b> improved, becoming less of an acquired taste. Blenders Lisa Gidley asserted the album cemented Wainwright as the [...] "most sardonic iconoclast", and that well-worn topics from obsession to culture shock are [...] "skewered in fresh ways." [...] Radio Telefís Éireann contributor Tom Grealis stated Poses is [...] "infused with a rare charm and wit, magnified by Wainwright's sharp lyrical touch and vocal melodies", and that [...] "Papa must be proud." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{journalist}} David Halberstam {{wrote of}} Stevenson that [...] "he {{had played a}} historic role for his party, twice its presidential candidate, the first time running against impossible odds in 1952, {{at the height of}} the Korean War and McCarthyism, with the [...] party already decaying from the scandals of twenty years in power. Running against the great hero of the era, Dwight Eisenhower, Stevenson had lost, of course, but <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> <b>had</b> seemed special in that moment, a voice of rationality and elegance. In the process of defeat he had helped to salvage the party, giving it a new vitality and bringing to its fold a whole new generation of educated Americans, volunteers now in the political process, some very professional amateurs who would be masterly used by the Kennedys in 1960. If John and Robert Kennedy seemed to symbolize style in politics, much of that was derived directly from Stevenson. He had, at what should have been a particularly low point for the party, managed to keep it vibrant and vital, and to involve a new kind of people in politics." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jolson {{had been}} a popular guest star on radio since its {{earliest}} days, including on NBC's The Dodge Victory Hour (January 1928), singing from a New Orleans hotel {{to an audience of}} 35 million via 47 radio stations. His own 1930s shows included Presenting Al Jolson (1932) and Shell Chateau (1935), and he was the host of the Kraft Music Hall from 1947 to 1949, with Oscar Levant as a sardonic, piano-playing sidekick. Jolson's 1940s career revival was nothing short of a success despite the competition of younger performers such as Bing Crosby and Frank Sinatra, and he was voted the [...] "Most Popular Male Vocalist" [...] in 1948 by a poll in Variety. The next year, Jolson was named [...] "Personality of the Year" [...] by the Variety Clubs of America. When Jolson appeared on Bing Crosby's radio show, he attributed his receiving the award to his being the only singer of any importance not to make a record of [...] "Mule Train", which {{had been a}} widely covered hit of that year (four different versions, one of them by Crosby, had made the top ten on the charts). Jolson joked about how <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> <b>had</b> deepened with age, saying [...] "I got the clippetys all right, but I can't clop like I used to." ...|$|E
2500|$|Savage {{first came}} to {{prominence}} as a boy treble in 1735, singing in a revival of Handel's Athalia and in Alcina during the composer's Covent Garden season. The role of Oberto in Alcina was composed with his voice particularly in mind. After <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> <b>had</b> broken, he initially continued his career singing as an alto [...] (countertenor), and later turned into a bass. As a countertenor he performed possibly the small roles of La Fortuna and Childerico in Handel's operas, Giustino (1737) and Faramondo (1738),impresario] [...] Heidegger encountered in casting it. It is certainly no historical precedent; in a similar dilemma Handel would normally have transposed or transferred a castrato part to a female singer". According to Anthony Hicks, however, {{the role of the}} goddess Fortuna was instead his last appearance as a treble, while the minor soprano part of Childerico, which has no arias, was probably sung an octave lower than written, having Savage's voice just broken (articles: Giustino (ii) and Faramondo, in Stanley Sadie (ed), The New Grove Dictionary of Opera, New York, Oxford University Press, 1997, II, pp. 121 e 440–441). and also appeared in the first performance of [...] Israel in Egypt (1739), as well as in revivals of other Handel oratorios. As a bass, he created the title role in Imeneo (1740), the role of Fenice in Deidamia (1741) [...] and that [...] of Manoa at the premiere of the oratorio Samson (1743). The 18th-century musicologist Charles Burney described Savage's voice as a [...] "powerful and not unpleasant bass". The description of his pupil R. J. S. Stevens is more complimentary: he describes Savage as possessing [...] "a pleasant voice of two octaves", and details that Savage sang with [...] "clear articulation, perfect intonation, great volubility of voice, and chaste and good expression".|$|E
