5000|$|In 1978 France Télécom, the country's PTT, began {{designing}} the Minitel network. By distributing terminals that could access a nationwide <b>electronic</b> <b>directory</b> of telephone and address information, it hoped to increase {{use of the}} country's 23 million phone lines, and reduce the costs of printing printed phone books and employing directory assistance personnel. Millions of terminals were lent for free to telephone subscribers, resulting in a high penetration rate among businesses and the public. In exchange for the terminal, the possessors of Minitel would not be given free [...] "white page" [...] printed directories (alphabetical list of residents and firms), but only the yellow pages (classified commercial listings, with advertisements); the white pages were accessible for free on Minitel, {{and they could be}} searched by a reasonably intelligent search engine; much faster than flipping through a paper directory.|$|E
40|$|In view of {{the recent}} deregulatory {{developments}} in the United States ' telecommunications industry, {{it is useful to}} reassess the issue of consumer videotex, especially {{as it relates to the}} implementation of <b>electronic</b> <b>directory</b> services. The success of the French videotex network Minitel relies on 10 principles: (1) cost of terminals; (2) no-frills terminals; (3) understanding the needs and wants of videotex users; (4) proper timing of introduction; (5) centralized authority to manage the videotex system; (6) organizing competition in a favorable regulatory environment; (7) long-range goals orientation; (8) consolidated billing policy; (9) single-standard system; and (10) individualized mass medium. To examine how major U.

40|$|Excerpt} Staff profile {{pages are}} dynamic, {{adaptive}} <b>electronic</b> <b>directories</b> that store {{information about the}} knowledge, skills, experience, and interests of people. They area cornerstone of successful knowledge management and learning initiatives. A determinant of organizational performance {{is the ability to}} leverage expert knowledge. Much of that is tacit and therefore difficult to capture, codify, and make available through search engines and database technologies. And so, when looking we usually turn to people we know for quick, reliable information. (Chance conversations can help too.) However, in the globalized economy, personal networks are no longer sufficiently diverse to identify all the right persons, much as reliance on random connections is a thing of the past. Staff directories are no longer adequate to the task: learning organizations thrive on rich and fluid linkages and need expertise location capabilities to put people in contact with one another...|$|R

The paper provides valuable insights into how organisations are coming to understand this new technology, are using X. 500 for both traditional and novel directory based services, and consequently are deriving benefits from it. Important lessons that have been learnt by these X. 500 pioneers are presented here, so that future organisations can benefit from their experiences. Factors critical to th...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis report {{describes}} a grant-funded project {{to explore the}} use of DIRECT secure messaging for the electronic delivery of laboratory test results to outpatient physicians and electronic health record systems. The project seeks to leverage the inherent attributes of DIRECT secure messaging and <b>electronic</b> provider <b>directories</b> to overcome certain barriers to the delivery of lab test results in the outpatient setting. The described system enables laboratories that generate test results as HL 7 messages to deliver these results as structured or unstructured documents attached to DIRECT secure messages. The system automatically analyzes generated HL 7 messages and consults an <b>electronic</b> provider <b>directory</b> to determine the appropriate DIRECT address and delivery format for each indicated recipient. The system also enables lab results delivered to providers as structured attachments to be consumed by HL 7 interface engines and incorporated into electronic health record systems. Lab results delivered as unstructured attachments may be printed or incorporated into patient records as PDF files. The system receives and logs acknowledgement messages to document the status of each transmitted lab result, and a graphical interface allows searching and review of this logged information. The described system is a fully implemented prototype that has been tested in a laboratory setting. Although this approach is promising, further work is required to pilot test the system in production settings with clinical laboratories and outpatient provider organizations...|$|R
