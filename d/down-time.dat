40|$|Abstract: This paper {{deals with}} the approximative {{analysis}} of production lines with continuous mate-rial flow consisting {{of a number of}} machines or servers in series and finite buffers in between. Each server suffers from operational dependent breakdowns, characterized by exponentially distributed up-and <b>down-times.</b> We construct an iterative method to efficiently and accurately estimate performance characteristics such as throughput and mean total buffer content. The method is based on decomposition of the production line into single-buffer subsystems. Novel features of the method are (i) modeling of the aggregate servers in each subsystem, (ii) equations to iteratively determine the processing behavior of these servers, and (iii) use of modern matrix-analytic techniques to analyze each subsystem. The pro-posed method performs very well on a large test set, including long and imbalanced production lines. For production lines with imbalance in mean <b>down-times,</b> we show that a more refined modeling of the servers in each subsystem performs significantly better. Lastly, we apply the iterative method to predict the throughput of a bottle line at brewery Heineken Den Bosch yielding errors of less than two percent...|$|R

40|$|With {{conventional}} object technology, systematic engineering of object-oriented {{systems for}} evolution is difficult. At best, one can build applications that are evolvable {{with respect to}} a few anticipated variation points. However, unanticipated evolution, which accounts for most changes of long-lived software, is not adequately supported. Therefore, infrastructures that support unanticipated software adaptation (USA) and its run-time variant, unanticipated software system reconfiguration (USSR) are a basic prerequisite for effective software evolution. This paper discusses the limitations of existing object technology and sketches an infrastructure for USA / USSR that extends the Java platform by two generic adaptation techniques: object-based inheritance and transmigration of object identity. The TAILOR infrastructure reduces the costs of developing, maintaining and deploying software due to less <b>down-times</b> and increased reuse of existing software when faced with unanticipated change. ...|$|R
2500|$|To model job performance, {{researchers}} {{have attempted to}} define a set of dimensions that are common to all jobs. Using {{a common set of}} dimensions provides a consistent basis for assessing performance and enables the comparison of performance across jobs. Performance is commonly broken into two major categories: in-role (technical aspects of a job) and extra-role (non-technical abilities such as communication skills and being a good team member). While this distinction in behavior has been challenged it is commonly made by both employees and management. A model of performance by Campbell breaks performance into in-role and extra-role categories. Campbell labeled job-specific task proficiency and non-job-specific task proficiency as in-role dimensions, while written and oral communication, demonstrating effort, maintaining personal discipline, facilitating peer and team performance, supervision and leadership and management and administration are labeled as extra-role dimensions. Murphy's model of job performance also broke job performance into in-role and extra-role categories. However, task-orientated behaviors composed the in-role category and the extra-role category included interpersonally-oriented behaviors, <b>down-time</b> behaviors and destructive and hazardous behaviors. However, it has been challenged as to whether the measurement of job performance is usually done through pencil/paper tests, job skills tests, on-site hands-on tests, off-site hands-on tests, high-fidelity simulations, symbolic simulations, task ratings and global ratings. These various tools are often used to evaluate performance on specific tasks and overall job performance. Van Dyne and LePine developed a measurement model in which overall job performance was evaluated using Campbell's in-role and extra-role categories. Here, in-role performance was reflected through how well [...] "employees met their performance expectations and performed well at the tasks that made up the employees' job." [...] Dimensions regarding how well the employee assists others with their work {{for the benefit of the}} group, if the employee voices new ideas for projects or changes to procedure and whether the employee attends functions that help the group composed the extra-role category.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Most rotating-machine {{failures}} {{are often}} linked to bearing failures. Proper condition monitoring on bearings is therefore essential {{to reduce the}} duration of machine <b>down-times.</b> This paper introduces feature extraction methodologies that can facilitate early detection of bearing faults. The time-domain vibration signals of a rotating machine with normal and defective bearings are processed for feature extraction. Both linear and non-linear features are extracted using Multi-Scale Fractal Dimension (MFD), Mel frequency Cepstral Coefficients and kurtosis. The extracted features are then used to classify faults using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) and hidden Markov Models (HMM). Results demonstrate that HMM outperforms GMM in classification of bearing faults. However, the disadvantage of HMM {{is that it is}} computationally expensive to train compared to GMM.

The suitability of the used building materials regarding low abrasion (VDI 2083 part 17), chemical (ISO 2812 - 1) and microbiological resistance (ISO 846) is evaluated using standardized test protocols.

40|$|Abstract. There {{exists a}} growing need to offer {{continuously}} available and reliable Internet services {{to a very}} large number of companies, organizations and individuals. Such services include, but are not limited to, [URL] ldap, smtp, radius, and dns. In this paper, we propose a reflective, load-balancing, and highly available architecture to address this problem and discuss key aspects of our prototype implementation. Our solution is based on farms or pools of computing nodes that are essentially responsible for the delivery of services. All these nodes operate behind a network-device that acts as the front-end to the services and coordinates the work of the nodes in a reflective and load-conscious manner. A comprehensive and highly configurable administration shell allows for the on-line manipulation and handling of both network-device and computing nodes in either interactive or batch-node. Our main objective is to create an open-source-based system that not only provides 7 x 24 -availability to Internet services offered, but can also grow in terms of resources gracefully while avoiding <b>down-times</b> and long reconfiguration delays. To this effect, our solution aspires to successfully replace proprietary embedded machinery geared into offering non-stop provision of Internet services. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an architecture concept for reconfigurable industrial I/O devices. In {{order to avoid}} the use of special hardware modules as well as to offload the PLC from real-time preprocessing of sensor data, these tasks are shifted into the reconfigurable I/O device. Therefore, an FPGA based architecture template is proposed that supports loading of application-specific functions into the I/O device at runtime. The architecture template is partitioned into a static part and several reconfigurable slots. While the static part implements all fixed design elements, like the communication with the field bus and the in-system CPU, all application-specific functions are mapped onto the reconfigurable slots. In order to perform the reconfiguration of application-specific functions at runtime, the partial reconfiguration technology of modern FPGAs is used. The proposed concept is evaluated by mapping a case study with four reconfigurable slots onto a Xilinx Zynq- 7000 SoC. The results show that new application-specific functions can be flexibly loaded into the I/O device. The total reconfiguration process of exemplary application-specific functions requires up to 3 ms and cause <b>down-times</b> below 0. 5 ms.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the problem of}} approximating the failure frequency of large-scale composite $k$-terminal reliability systems. In such systems, the nodes ($k$ of which are terminals) are connected through components which are subject to random failure and repair processes. At any time, a system failure occurs if the surviving system fails to connect all the k terminals together. We assume that each component's up-times and <b>down-times</b> follow statistically independent stationary random processes, and these processes are statistically independent across the components. In this setting, the exact computation of failure frequency {{is known to be}} computationally intractable (NP-hard). In this work, we present an algorithm to approximate the failure frequency for any given multiplicative error factor that runs in polynomial time in the number of (minimal) cutsets. Moreover, for the special case of all-terminal reliability systems, i. e., where all nodes are terminals, we propose an algorithm for approximating the failure frequency within an arbitrary multiplicative error that runs in polynomial time in the number of nodes (which can be much smaller than the number of cutsets). In addition, our simulation results confirm that the proposed method is much faster and more accurate than the Monte Carlo simulation technique for approximating the failure frequency.

In laser materials processing, a periodical beam diagnosis is to be executed as a qualitymaintaining measure with any change of the workpiece geometry to guarantee an unambiguous allocation of the beam quality factors. Otherwise changes in the beam quality, caused by pollution, aging or defect of the optical components, remain unidentified for a long time, leading to impairments of the treatment quality or even costly <b>down-times.</b> As a solution a diagnosis system is integrated into a laser system. Data sources like measuring instruments, sensors and laser control transmitt the diagnosis data to a diagnosis PC. A user-friendly software, based on Fuzzy algorithms, enables the operator to retrace changes in the beam quality to failures of the laser system. All diagnosis data are getting archived in a databank. The access to the archived data through the World Wide Web allows remote diagnoses.
