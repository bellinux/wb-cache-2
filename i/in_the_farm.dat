5|$|After graduating {{high school}} in East St. Louis, Blake played <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>farm</b> system of the nearby St. Louis Cardinals before enlisting in the army. He {{returned}} to baseball after being wounded in the military service, pitching in the minors for five years before making his major league debut for the Cincinnati Reds. He pitched for them {{on and off for}} three years, then spent the next six years pitching for the Toronto Maple Leafs. His last major league appearance was a stint with the Athletics in 1957, and two years later his professional baseball career ended. After retirement he became a plumber, and died in 2009.|$|E
5|$|Born in Oklahoma {{and raised}} in Arkansas, Seerey played {{football}} and baseball in high school. After graduating, he joined the Cleveland Indians' farm system in 1941, and made his major league debut two-and-a-half years later. He was primary a starting outfielder the next five seasons for the Indians, but {{led the league in}} strikeouts four times. He was traded partway through the 1948 season to the Chicago White Sox, and a month after being traded became one of 18 MLB players to hit four home runs in one game. The following season, he was sent to the minor leagues, and played a few seasons <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>farm</b> system for the White Sox before retiring.|$|E
5|$|He {{returned}} to the Mexican League in 1947 and 1948 for the financial remuneration, but, comparatively speaking, the venture was unsuccessful for Day, who finished with a combined record of 18–20 and a 4.00 ERA. Following his departure from the Negro leagues in 1950, Day spent a season with the semi-professional Winnipeg Buffalos of the Mandak League. Finally, in 1951 Day made his debut in organized baseball, albeit in the minors, with the Toronto Maple Leafs, a Triple-A club that Day tallied a 1–1 record with in 14 games. Day also played for two other teams <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>farm</b> system, the Scranton Miners and the Edmonton Eskimos, before retiring from professional baseball in 1955.|$|E

The Phillies drafted him in the 2010 MLB Draft, and after a few seasons <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>farm</b> system, they invited him to spring training in 2014. After performing well in those exhibition games, he made the Phillies' 2014 Opening Day roster, and although he walked too many hitters, showed some potential to emerge as a decent relief pitcher. His teammates described him as a good personality to have in the bullpen, and his coaches approved of his development. Meanwhile, he is pursuing another college degree; he is studying merchandise marketing at the Fashion Institute of Design & Merchandising.|$|E
5|$|There follow {{confusing}} episodes involving Brittany (sometimes called Letia). Padarn finally {{leaves for}} France, where he dies, but his remains are brought back and buried in Vannes. A final chapter tells how Padarn, David and Teilo divide south Wales into three episcopates, with Padarn as bishop of Ceredigion. Then, convinced by a miracle performed by Padarn, a local governor called Eithir is persuaded to give land between the rivers Rheidol and Paith to Padarn. The lands owned by Llanbadarn in {{the twelfth century}} were between the rivers Rheidol and Clarach. The Paith is a minor tributary of the River Ystwyth. The obscure figure of Eithyr is commemorated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>farm</b> name of Llaneithr, which stands a mile east of Devil's Bridge near the river Mynach.|$|E
5|$|After Dernancourt, the 48th Battalion {{marched to}} the rear and began {{establishing}} a reserve line at Beaucourt. On 18 April, Gellibrand was evacuated sick and Leane was appointed to act as brigade commander in his place. The following day he was temporarily promoted {{to the rank of}} colonel. During Gellibrand's absence, on 27–28 April the 12th Brigade was deployed to the line at Villers-Bretonneux, which had just been recaptured from the Germans. In order to push the frontline further east of the town, it was necessary to capture strongly-held German positions in Monument Wood, so-named as it was adjacent to a memorial to the Franco-Prussian War. This task was given to the 12th Brigade, and Leane, knowing that the fighting would be difficult, applied his usual practice of giving the most challenging missions to his own, the 48th Battalion. After the intense fighting at Dernancourt, the 48th had been reinforced with a significant number of unseasoned new recruits. The attack was planned for 02:00 on 3 May, and in order to achieve surprise, there was to be only intermittent shelling of the wood during the day, and just a two minute barrage with all available guns {{at the time of the}} attack. In the event, Leane's first battle as brigade commander went badly, with the artillery barrage being very weak and failing to cut the wire in front of the wood, and the supporting tanks failing to have any impact. One party managed to get through the wire and capture 21 Germans <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>farm</b> buildings in the centre of the wood, but a German counterattack forced the Australians back to their start line, with a loss of 12 officers and 143 other ranks, against German casualties of 10 officers and 136 men.|$|E

25|$|Immediately at the war's end, in 1945–1946, Allis-Chalmers {{endured a}} {{crippling}} 11-month labor strike.

This seems debatable given the various successes that Allis-Chalmers did have during the next 30 years, including prosperity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>farm</b> equipment business in the 1950s and 1960s.

25|$|One of {{the first}} {{attempts}} at diverting sewage {{for use as a}} fertilizer <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>farm</b> was made by the cotton mill owner James Smith in the 1840s.
