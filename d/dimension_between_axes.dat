40|$|Re-examination of 149 IPG Group I (119), Group Ia (17) and Groups III and IIa (13) axe {{petrographic}} thin-sections in a {{short period}} of time resulted in 24 sub-groups being identified, each sharing distinct petrographic features. Approximately 5 % (8 thin-sections) had distinctive mineralogy, different from that of altered dolerite (greenstone), which defines these IPG Groups. All 149 thin-sections are visually compared with 73 new petrological thin-sections that were produced from 13 greenstone exposures in North and South Cornwall. The closest petrological match <b>between</b> <b>axe</b> and greenstone suggests Mounts Bay, possibly Long Rock. Mousehole and Penlee exposures may be the source of material for some of the 24 sub-groups. Two greenstone samples found in north-west Cornwall, away from known exposures, provided the closest petrographic match found <b>between</b> <b>axe</b> and rock thin-sections. This supports Keiller et al. (1941) in their assumption that IPG Group I originates from Mounts Bay, but indicates it is unlikely that a single exposure provided the material for all IPG Group I axes. Further analysis using a novel quantitative technique supports the results of the visual examination and may prove to be the basis of a future tool to be used in recording and assigning Neolithic axes to IPG Groups...|$|R
