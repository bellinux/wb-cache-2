40|$|Exhalation {{of carbon}} dioxide (CO 2) by pigs was {{investigated}} under field conditions in a mechanically ventilated commercial <b>fattening</b> <b>house.</b> The tranquil CO 2 exhalation rate (TCER) by pigs was defined and methodology was developed to study it. The experiments were conducted by moving groups of pigs {{in and out of}} one of the compartments in the house and comparing differences of measured CO 2 production rates. The measured TCERs ranged from 41. 5 to 73. 9 g CO 2 h(- 1) per pig for pigs from 32 to 105 kg. When pigs were very active, the CO 2 exhalation rate could be about 200 % of the TCER but did not last for long time. A TCER mathematical model was developed based on 4 sets of experiments. It calculated the CO 2 exhalation by a pig at tranquil time as a function of its weight. Daily mean CO 2 exhalation rate (CER) by a pig was about 110 % of the TCER, The TCER/CER model related the CO 2 exhalation to some aspects of pigs' behaviours and was the first reported model developed with direct measurement of CO 2 production rates. Five models of CO 2 exhalation in available literature were reviewed and the CER model was compared with them. There was a clear disparity among these models. The average CO 2 exhalation rate calculated with the "Ouwerkerk Model" was about three times as that obtained by the "Anderson Model" for pigs from 35 to 120 kg. The CER model produced the same CO 2 exhalation rate as the "Ouwerkerk Model" for a pig of 35 kg and a close rate to the "Klooster Model" for a gig of 85 kg, (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Average ammonia (NH 3) and odour removal efficiencies were 42 - 62 %. NH 3 outlet concentrations appeared rather constant and independent of fluctuations in inlet concentrations, so higher inlet concentrations led to higher calculated removal efficiencies. Part of the inlet NH 3 was converted to nitrous oxide (N 2 O). The average N 2 O production was equal for both biofilters (0. 5 g N 2 O/m 2 /hour) although NH 3 loading rates {{were very different}} (30 and 2. 4 g NH 3 /hour).

Ammonia emission from an exhaust chimney was continuously measured for 135 days with a NOx analyser and a full-size ventilation rate sensor. Measurement data were processed and 900 steady-state data subsets were extracted. The steady-state data were used to investigate the effect of manure on the NH, emission. There was no good relationship established between the NH 3 emission rate and the manure depth (correlation coefficient r = - 0. 143). However, the NH 3 emission rate had a high correlation coefficient (r = 0. 852) with the floor contamination. A linear equation was built for the relationship between the NH 3 emission and the floor contamination. it was further found that the floor contamination itself was influenced by the weight of pigs and the inside room temperature. A model was developed to calculate the floor contamination {{as a function of the}} weight of pigs and the inside temperature (R- 2 = 0. 811).

On each farm, the L. monocytogenes status of a batch of contemporary <b>fattening</b> pigs <b>housed</b> in the same room was assessed on faecal material samples taken by means of gauze swabs wiped on the perianal region of the pigs. Fourteen percent of the batches studied had at least one contaminated sample and were therefore classified as L. monocytogenes contaminated batches. Two logistic regression models were used to assess the association between managerial and hygiene practices and the risk of L. monocytogenes contamination of the batch {{at the end of the}} finishing period on the whole data set ($n = 93 $) and in the wet feeding farms only (n = 57). Wet feeding during the fattening period was identified as a risk factor for L. monocytogenes contamination. Risk factors related to the introduction of L. monocytogenes in pig facilities were identified for both the general and wet feeding farm data sets. Poor care paid to hygiene on the farms was found to increase the risk of being infected (boots cleaning, change room presence). When the duration of the empty period prior to the introduction of growing pigs was less than one day in the fattening section, the risk of L. monocytogenes contamination was significantly increased. For wet feeding farms, a distribution pipeline cleaning procedure including disinfection was found to be associated with a higher risk of contamination than no cleaning or a procedure consisting of rinsing with water only...|$|R
40|$|Carbon dioxide (CO 2) {{release from}} manure was {{investigated}} under held conditions {{in one of}} the compartments in a mechanically ventilated <b>fattening</b> pig <b>house.</b> The potential of CO 2 release was tested in the emptied compartment by imposing high ventilation rate and measuring CO 2 concentrations in the incoming and exhaust air. When the compartment was filled with pigs, a model of tranquil CO 2 exhalation rate (TCER) was used to estimate the part of CO 2 produced by animals, in addition to the measurement of CO 2 concentrations and ventilation rate. Useful data were extracted from 135 days of continuously measured field data obtained when the housing system was in steady-state. The CO 2 release per m(2) of pit surface was 18. 4 and 25. 8 g h(- 1) m(- 2) in the emptied pig compartment during the impulse and pulse ventilation rate tests, respectively. It ranged from 1. 1 and 116. 7 g h(- 1) m(- 2) and averaged 42. 1 g h(- 1) m(- 2) during the 135 -day continuous held measurement. In 128 of the 135 days when the compartment was filled with pigs, the mean CO 2 release from the manure reached an average of 37. 5 % of the TCER by pigs: instead of less than 5 % believed by many researchers. The maximum CO 2 release rate in 2 -h steady-state measurements was 94 % of the TCER by pigs. This research demonstrated that, in the previous knowledge, there might be a serious underestimation of the CO 2 release from the manure in pig houses. The total pig weight, manure temperature and ventilation rate were found the most important variables related to the CO 2 release. A mathematical model was developed to estimate the CO 2 release as a function of these three variables with R- 2 = 0. 525. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Emissions of {{particulate}} matter (PM) from poultry and pig houses may {{contribute significantly to}} ambient concentrations. Yet, our knowledge on the accuracy and comparability of samplers available for measuring the high PM 10 concentrations (> 100 µg m– 3) in the inside air directly upstream of the ventilation exhausts of these buildings is very limited. The {{aim of this study}} was to provide insight into this matter for five candidate samplers: a filter-based cyclone sampler (CYS), the Thermo Scientific FH 62 I-R beta-attenuation sampler (BAS), the Thermo Scientific Tapered Element Oscillating Microbalance, model 1400 ab (TEOM), the TSI DustTrak model 8520 (DT), and the GRIMM Portable Aerosol Spectrometer model 1. 109 (PAS). Equivalence tests were carried out following European Standard EN 12341 using two devices for each candidate sampler (CAS) and four filter-based low-volume reference samplers (RES). Measurements were performed inside three major animal housings (a <b>fattening</b> pig <b>house,</b> a laying hen house, and a broiler house) and inside an office room. Our key results and conclusions are: (1) neither one of the five CASs, nor the RES itself, met the EN 12341 requirement for comparability between devices of the same sampler type. Using a less strict boundary for this aspect – in concert with performing duplicate sampling – may be appropriate. (2) The CYS met the EN 12341 accuracy requirements in pigs and layers, but overestimated the RES concentration in broilers. The BAS, TEOM, and DT underestimated, and the PAS overestimated, RES concentrations in a systematic manner. The use of correction factors seems to be a promising method to calibrate measured values to RES concentrations. (3) The BAS, TEOM, DT, and PAS started to show scattered regression after 432 – 500 h of sampling, which stresses the need for shortened time intervals between full services. In conclusion, some of the samplers tested could be regarded acceptable when appropriate measures (such as duplicate sampling, correction factors, and more frequent servicing) are applied...|$|R
40|$|Against the {{background}} of a high prevalence of respiratory diseases among the workers with the <b>housing</b> of <b>fattening</b> pigs as well as conspicuous negative pulmonary results among the fattening pigs {{it will be necessary}} to determine within the framework of an interdisciplinary cooperating project the impact of and hazards for humans, animals and the environment wherever it occurred in fattening pig facilities. To achieve this research has been carried out in representative systems of <b>housing</b> <b>fattening</b> pigs especially taking into account organic systems with the use of straw in deep litter or minimal litter systems in comparison to conventional systems, where the straw was used as on occupation material. In correspondence with the current discussion in the field of occupational medicine and the occupational safety and health area the impact through micro organisms and their metabolic products (so-called biological hazards) as well as the effects of dust and harmful gases are central in this research. The objective of this project is on one hand to describe the status quo concerning the level of biological hazards in different <b>housing</b> system for <b>fattening</b> pigs.

40|$|When used in dusty environments, such as {{livestock}} houses, {{the current}} EU reference sampler for ambient dust (PM 10 and PM 2. 5) with an impaction pre-separator (IPS) {{is expected to}} become overloaded, because of the low dust-retaining capacity of the greased impaction plate in the IPS. The two objectives {{of this study were}} (1) to verify this by regularly replacing the loaded greased plates by clean ones, and (2) to evaluate a sampler with a cyclone pre-separator (CPS) as an alternative dust sampler in ambient environments and in livestock <b>houses</b> (<b>fattening</b> pig, broiler, and dairy) following the EU standard procedure. Results showed that PM 10 -IPS did not become overloaded in 24 h measurements in layer houses, whereas PM 2. 5 -IPS became overloaded within 1 h. PM 2. 5 -CPS did not become overloaded during 48 h sampling in a layer house. Both PM 10 - and PM 2. 5 -CPS showed good precision and comparability with IPS in less dusty environments. In pig and broiler houses with high dust loads, PM 10 -CPS could give comparable results with IPS by introducing a correction factor. It is concluded that PM 2. 5 -IPS is not suitable for use in livestock houses, and that PM 2. 5 -CPS is very resistant to high dust load. For PM 10 sampling, both IPS and CPS can be use...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe use of air {{scrubbers}} {{to reduce}} ammonia (NH 3) emissions from buildings on pig farms {{is one of}} the most promising techniques in the Göteborg protocol and other European regulations including the Industrial Emission Directive. In France, some air scrubbers are currently used on pig farms, mainly to reduce odours from livestock buildings. However, recent research revealed the production of N 2 O resulting from the treatment of air from pig buildings. In this context, a two-month study was conducted on a pig farm with 750 places for fattening pigs to check the abatement of NH 3 emissions and to assess the possible production of N 2 O during treatment of exhausted air from buildings <b>housing</b> <b>fattening</b> pigs by a air scrubber. Concentrations of NH 3 and N 2 O in the inlet and outlet air of the scrubber were continuously monitored using an Innova 1412 infrared analyzer. With the scrubber operating parameters (airflow, design, size), our results confirmed the production of N 2 O in the order of 5 % of NH 3 -N reduced. N 2 O was produced by biological nitrification and/or denitrification inside the air scrubber. Statistical analysis (Pearson's test) showed that the production of N 2 O was strongly influenced by the rate of airflow and the outside temperature. The abatement of NH 3 emissions from the building was only 33 %, i. e. much lower than the 70 % - 90 % usually cited in the literature...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{concentration}} and size distribution of airborne particles were measured {{inside and outside}} typical animal houses such as broilers, broiler breeders (both floor housing with litter); layers (floor housing system and aviary housing system); turkeys (floor housing with litter), pigs: <b>fattening</b> pigs (traditional <b>houses,</b> low emission houses with dry feed, and low emission houses with wet feed), piglets, sows (individual and group housing); cattle (cubicle house), and mink (cages). Using an aerosol spectrometer, particles were counted and classified into 30 size classes (total range: 0. 25 – 32 µm). Particles were measured on for two days, one in spring {{and the other in}} summer, in two of each species/housing combination during 30 min inside and outside the animal house. Outside temperature and relative humidity were also measured. Particle counts in the different size classes were generally higher in poultry houses than in pig houses, and counts in pig houses were generally higher than those in cattle and mink houses. The particle counts in animal houses were highest (on average 87 %) in the size classes 2. 5 μm (on average 97 %). Most particles outside were in the size class < 1. 0 μm (99 % in counts). Mean count median diameter (CMD) of particles inside the animal houses ranged from 0. 32 to 0. 59 μm, while mean mass median diameter (MMD) ranged from 3. 54 to 12. 4 μm. Particle counts in different size fractions were highly correlated, with correlation coefficients varying from 0. 69 to 0. 98; higher coefficients were found for the close...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the effect of sulphur feed content on sulphur retention and excretion by pig. The sulphur content of 76 different feedstuffs commonly used to formulate pig diets was evaluated from INRA‐AFZ database. Total sulphur content varied between 0. 5 and 15. 3 g S/kg dry matter. For most of the feedstuffs, protein sulphur contributed to most of the sulphur content. However, inorganic sulphur was also found at a high level in some feedstuffs, especially in by‐products from industrial process. In vivo experiments were conducted on <b>fattening</b> pigs individually <b>housed</b> in metabolic cages for collection of excreta. Eleven experimental diets, mainly based on wheat and on soybean meal, were compared. They differed by their protein content and the incorporation of feedstuffs with different total sulphur content (wheat, dried distiller’s grains with solubles, sugar beet pulp or rapeseed meal). Sulphur supply varied between 3. 1 and 8. 3 g S/pig/day. Sulphur retention by animals was not affected by the diet and amounted to 1. 1 g S/pig/day on average. Sulphur excretion was highly affected by the diet and varied from 1. 5 to 6. 9 g/pig/day. Sulphur digestibility was 79 % on average and urinary sulphur excretion represented 55 % of intake. Sulphur was excreted as 100 % sulphate speciation form in urine, 50 % in faeces and 90 % in slurry. The results from this study indicate the feed composition may have a marked effect on sulphur excretion, with a specific contribution of some feedstuffs with high inorganic sulphur content...|$|R
40|$|Piglets have {{difficulties}} with the abrupt changes at weaning associated with conventional pig production systems. Previously, {{it has been}} shown in rats that reward and announcement of reward counteracts impact of stress effects. In the present study, it was investigated if announcement of an environmental enrichment, more than enrichment alone, could facilitate play behaviour and reduce weaning-stress-induced behaviours such as increased aggression with subsequent increased injuries and increased social manipulative behaviours (i. e., tail biting, belly nosing, mounting). Twenty-four litters of conventional <b>housed</b> <b>fattening</b> piglets were kept under three different experimental conditions: sound cue (conditioned stimulus, CS) paired with an environmental enrichment (unconditioned stimulus, US) with a maximum delay between the CS and US of 30 s (CS-US paired) in which anticipatory behaviour develops; cue-environmental enrichment unpaired (CS-US unpaired) and no cue and no environmental enrichment (No CS-US). At two weeks of age the so-called,anticipation procedure' started and ended two days after weaning. Growth, play, aggressive, social manipulative, eating and inactive behaviour, and injury rates were measured before and after weaning. Results of this study indicated that announcement of enrichment and not enrichment alone significantly increased play behaviour after weaning. In addition, announcement of enrichment {{and to a lesser extent}} enrichment alone decreased aggression before and after weaning and subsequent amount of injuries after weaning. The most important finding of this study is that the effects of an expected enrichment are more pronounced than the effects of enrichment alone. It is therefore suggested that announcing enrichment has an additional effect on the impact of enrichment alone and can be used as a new tool to reduce weaning stress in piglets...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{importance}} of livestock-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (LA-MRSA) as an infectious agent for humans {{has increased in}} recent years in Germany. Although {{it is well known that}} the prevalence of MRSA in pig farms is high, risk factors for the presence of MRSA in herds of fattening pigs are still poorly understood. The aim of this study was to evaluate available data from previous studies on MRSA in fattening pigs in a meta-analysis to answer the question: What are the factors associated with the occurrence of MRSA in fattening pig herds?The studies on MRSA in pigs that were identified by literature research were heterogeneous with respect to the risk factors investigated and the type of herds focused on. Therefore we decided to carry out a pooling analysis on herd level rather than a typical meta-analysis. Eligible herd data were identified based on the published literature and communication with the authors. The final data set covered 400 fattening pig herds from 10 different studies and 12 risk factors. The prevalence of MRSA in the 400 fattening pig herds was 53. 5 %. Data were analyzed using generalized estimating equations (GEE). The resulting multivariate model confirmed previously identified risk factors for MRSA in pig herds (herd size and herd type). It also identified further risk factors: group treatment of fattening pigs with antimicrobial drugs (OR= 1. 79) and <b>housing</b> <b>fattening</b> pig herds on at least partially slatted floors (OR= 2. 39) compared to plain floor. In contrast, according to the model, fattening pig herds on farms keeping other livestock along with pigs were less likely to harbor MRSA (OR= 0. 54). The results underline the benefits from a pooling analysis and cooperative re-evaluation of published data...|$|R
40|$|Airborne {{emissions}} from livestock production are nowadays {{one of the}} major concerns of this activity. For this reason, the reduction of these emissions is a requirement in many countries. The development of abatement techniques for the reduction of emissions needs for accurate knowledge about their magnitude. Emission measurement techniques arise then as a key issue. The development of measurement techniques considering not only the accuracy of the results but also the optimization of resources is needed. In this sense, in this thesis a tool and three options for the rationalization on the use of resources when measuring airborne emissions are investigated. The tool is the uncertainty analysis and the three options are: downscaling measurements, indirect measurement of airflow rates and reduction of sampling rates. In this thesis, theoretical and practical studies were conducted to determine the suitability of these techniques to obtain reliable data from more rational measurements on airborne emissions. Firstly, an uncertainty model was developed in order to assess the trustworthiness of the results when determining N 2 and N 2 O {{emissions from}} a biological scrubber using a combined N-balance in air and water. This model was later partially validated throughout an experimental work in a chemical scrubber. The uncertainty model and the experimental work agreed in the key results of both studies, finding that N-balances were not successful for the proposed aims. Secondly, a flux chamber for the measurement of gas emissions from rabbits was designed and built. A measuring protocol for gas emissions from both animals and their manure was also developed. This chamber was later used to determine the CO 2 emission rate from fattening rabbits during the whole fattening cycle. Using this CO 2 emission rate from fattening rabbits, the carbon dioxide balance was tested as an option to determine the ventilation rate from <b>fattening</b> rabbit <b>houses.</b> The results of these balances were compared with direct measurements of ventilation rates finding no statistical differences. Finally, the effect of reducing sampling when measuring ammonia emissions from livestock facilities was evaluated. Emissions calculated using semi-continuous measurements of NH 3 concentrations and airflow rates were compared with emissions calculated on 24 -hour average values for these parameters. The error committed with these low time-resolution measurements resulted to be low in comparison with other error sources committed when measuring emissions from livestock facilities. The main conclusion of this work is that there are available techniques that allow optimizing the use of resources of measurement processes, by keeping the accuracy of the results.
