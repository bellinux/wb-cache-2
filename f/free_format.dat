2500|$|The University of Wisconsin–Madison campus {{radio station}} is WSUM 91.7 FM, [...] "The Snake on the Lake". Historically, UW–Madison has {{been home to}} a {{collection}} of student run radio stations, a number of which stopped broadcasting after run-ins with the United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The current radio station, WSUM, began in 1997 in a webcast only format because of the prolonged battle to get an FCC license and construct a tower. This lasted five years until February 22, 2002, when the station started broadcasting over FM airwaves at 91.7 from its tower in Montrose, Wisconsin. The radio station currently has around 200 volunteer DJs and eight paid managers. All UW–Madison students, {{as well as a}} limited number of community members, are eligible to participate in running the station. WSUM remains entirely <b>free</b> <b>format,</b> which means that the on-air personnel can showcase a large variety of music and talk programming at their discretion with few limitations. WSUM has garnered many awards from the Wisconsin Broadcasters Association for their news, play-by-play broadcasts of Badger athletic events, and unique public service announcements.|$|E
2500|$|Chair of the Annapolis Group, and {{president}} of Gettysburg College, Katherine Haley Will, discussed this decision further in a 9 July 2007 article for The Washington Post. [...] In this article, Hill states that this decision was not based upon [...] "a lack of concern about providing accurate, comprehensive information to help {{students and their families}} make decisions about college." [...] Rather, she argued against the methodology of the U.S. News rankings. In particular, she argues against [...] "the largest single factor in the U.S. News rating formula" [...] which is the reputational survey as, [...] "it is unrealistic to expect academic officials to know enough about hundreds of institutions to fairly evaluate the quality of their programs." [...] Hill then argues that, [...] "by contrast, 1 percent of the U.S. News ratings formula is assigned to student-to-faculty ratios, which many faculty members and students consider {{the most important factor in}} educational experience." [...] Hill states that the members of the Annapolis Group will offer the same information in an alternative, <b>free,</b> <b>format</b> which will not rank schools, as, [...] "an educational experience can't be reduced to one number, a school's so-called rank. The simplicity of a rank is understandably more appealing than spending hours poring over college catalogues and visiting campuses, but myriad complex variables can't be reduced to a single number." [...] Instead, Hill asks students and parents to [...] "compare schools on a variety of factors [...] they should visit campuses and go on what feels like a good match rather than relying on filtered or secondhand information. We must encourage students to look inside their hearts and trust their instincts when it comes to choosing a college, not whether parents or friends think a university is cool or prestigious." ...|$|E
