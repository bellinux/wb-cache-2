5|$|The product {{claimed to}} be the strongest beer made is Schorschbräu's 2011 Schorschbock 57 with 57,5%. It was preceded by The <b>End</b> <b>of</b> <b>History,</b> a 55% Belgian ale, made by BrewDog in 2010. The same company had {{previously}} made Sink The Bismarck!, a 41% abv IPA, and Tactical Nuclear Penguin, a 32% abv Imperial stout. Each of these beers are made using the eisbock method of fractional freezing, in which a strong ale is partially frozen and the ice is repeatedly removed, until the desired strength is reached, a process that may class the product as spirits rather than beer. The German brewery Schorschbräu's Schorschbock, a 31% abv eisbock, and Hair of the Dog's Dave, a 29% abv barley wine made in 1994, used the same fractional freezing method. A 60% abv blend of beer with whiskey was jokingly claimed as the strongest beer by a Dutch brewery in July 2010.|$|E

Réal Fillion offers a critical exposition of the theses of these three authors on the dynamics and the <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>history,</b> {{in order to provide}} an answer to the question: "Where are we headed?" Grounding his answer in the twin observations that the world is becoming increasingly multicultural and increasingly unified, Fillion reasserts the task of the speculative philosophy <b>of</b> <b>history</b> as it had been understood by German philosophy: the articulation and understanding the historical process as a developmental whole...|$|R

Where are we going to throw Marxism, which actually invented the dustbins of history? (Yet there is some justice here since the very people who invented them have fallen in.) Conclusion: if there are no more dustbins of history, this is because History itself has become a dustbin. It has become its own dustbin, just as the planet itself is becoming its own dustbin.|$|E

2500|$|The Apostle Paul {{also seems}} to have shared this expectation. Toward the end of 1 Corinthians 7, he counsels Christians to avoid getting married if they can since the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>history</b> was imminent.

In the article, he argued that, {{after the fall of}} the Soviet Union, Islam would become the biggest obstacle to Western domination of the world.

2500|$|In {{connection}} to {{the publication of the}} book in September 2008, Bäckman gave several controversial interviews, e.g. one in which he claimed Estonia will join Russia within a decade. Bäckman also claimed that the [...] "destruction" [...] of the Bronze Soldier grave site and monument in April 2007 by the Estonian government was [...] "the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>history</b> of Estonia". He speculated that most of the Russian youth all over Russia, including children, [...] hate Estonia and deny her the right to exist. Bäckman went on to predict that in ten years at most, the Nashi would come to power in Russia, leading to an end of the Estonian statehood shortly afterwards.|$|E
2500|$|Herzen was {{disillusioned with}} the Revolutions of 1848 but not disillusioned with revolutionary thought. He became {{critical}} of those 1848 revolutionaries who were [...] "so revolted by the Reaction after 1848, so exasperated by everything European, that they hastened on to Kansas or California". Herzen had always admired the French Revolution and broadly adopted its values. In his early writings, he viewed the French Revolution as the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>history,</b> {{the final stage}} in social development of a society based on humanism and harmony. Throughout his early life, Herzen saw himself as a revolutionary radical called to fight the political oppression of Nicholas I of Russia. Essentially, Herzen fought against the ruling elites in Europe, against Christian hypocrisy and for individual freedom and self-expression.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Reformers want history {{education}} {{to help students}} learn to engage in historical inquiry, read critically across conflicting sources, and engage in civil discussion of controversial issues. How can we help teachers and students shift the roles, norms, and activity in history classrooms to achieve these aims? An activity-theoretical framework suggests the value of explicitly attending to multiple aspects of human activity when designing and presenting reform-oriented pedagogies or curricula. Such attention increases the odds that teachers who implement new approaches or curriculum will achieve significant shifts in the means and <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>history</b> education...|$|R
