5|$|Ai {{initially}} {{refuses to}} see a connection between his sexuality and his mode of consciousness, preventing him from truly understanding the Gethenians; thus {{he is unable to}} persuade them of the importance of his mission. Ai's failure to comprehend shifgrethor and to trust Estraven's motives leads him to misunderstand much of the advice that Estraven gives him. As Ai's relationship to Estraven changes, their communication also changes; they are both more willing to acknowledge mistakes, and make fewer assertions. Eventually, the two are able to converse directly with mindspeech, but only after Ai is able to understand Estraven's motivations, and no longer requires <b>direct</b> <b>communication.</b>|$|E

5|$|Using {{conventional}} GSM systems {{was rejected}} also because GSM lacks {{many of the}} functionalities of TETRA, such as group conversations, dispatcher centers, and <b>direct</b> <b>communication.</b> In addition, Global System for Mobile Communication – Railway (GSM-R) was considered, but rejected {{because of the lack}} of trans-border functionality and the need for more base stations, and thus higher investment costs, and longer start-up time for calls. The technology was considered because the Norwegian National Rail Administration was at the time building a GSM-R network to cover the entire Norwegian railway network. Another reason that TETRA was preferred was that at the time of decision there were five manufacturers of TETRA equipment and only two for GSM-R. TETRA also allows a fall-back system, where a base station can allow communication between users within the range of the base station, even if the central parts of the network break down.|$|E

5|$|On 16 January 1945, {{following}} the Wehrmacht's {{defeat in the}} Battle of the Bulge, Misch {{and the rest of}} Hitler's personal staff moved into the Führerbunker and Vorbunker under the Reich Chancellery garden in Berlin. His FBK commanding officer, Franz Schädle, appointed Misch to be the bunker telephone operator. Misch handled all of the <b>direct</b> <b>communication</b> from the bunker. He did not leave it for any significant period of time until the war ended in May 1945. On 22 April 1945, Schädle called him on the phone and told him there was a place reserved for his wife and young daughter on one of the last planes out of Berlin. Misch was temporarily released from duty and drove to pick up his family to take them to the aircraft. However, his wife refused to take their daughter and leave him and her parents in Berlin. Upon returning to the Reich Chancellery, Misch learned that Hitler was releasing most of the remaining staff to leave Berlin. By that date, as the Red Army was entering Berlin, propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels and his wife Magda brought their six young children to stay in the Vorbunker. Joseph Goebbels moved into the room next to Misch's telephone exchange in the lower level of the Führerbunker. The Goebbels children would play in the corridor around Misch's post.|$|E
5|$|The {{injustice}} {{which has}} been done to our author's works, in estimating their poetical merit, rendered us doubly anxious, on opening his last volume, to find it likely to seize fast hold of general sympathy, and thus turn an overwhelming power against the paltry traducers of talent, more eminently promising in many respects, than any the present age has been called upon to encourage. We have not found it to be quite all that we wished in this respect--and {{it would have been very}} extraordinary if we had, for our wishes went far beyond reasonable expectations. But we have found it of a nature to present to common understandings the poetical power with which the author's mind is gifted, in a more tangible and intelligible shape than that in which it has appeared in any of his former compositions. It is, therefore, calculated to throw shame on the lying, vulgar spirit, in which this young worshipper in the temple of the Muses has been cried-down; whatever questions may still leave to be settled as to the kind and degree of his poetical merits. Take for instance, as proof of the justice of our praise, the following passage from an Ode to the Nightingale:--it is distinct, noble, pathetic, and true: the thoughts have all chords of <b>direct</b> <b>communication</b> with naturally-constituted hearts: the echoes of the strain linger bout the depths of human bosoms.|$|E

For the first problem, a simplified consensus protocol is designed: Each child agent can only communicate with one of its neighbors.

Then, the necessary and sufficient condition is put forward to the multi-agent systems can be reached consensus. It {{is worth noting that}} the given conditions do not need any eigenvalue of the corresponding Laplacian matrix of the original <b>directed</b> <b>communication</b> network. For the second problem, the feedback gain is designed in the nonlinear consensus protocol. Then, the sufficient condition is proposed such that the systems can be achieved consensus. Besides, the consensus interval is introduced and analyzed to solve the consensus problem. Finally, two numerical simulations are included to verify the theoretical analysis...|$|R

The information {{flow in the}} network is represented by a <b>directed</b> <b>communication</b> graph and is sub-ject to unknown and possibly discontinuous time-varying communication delays with unknown upper bounds.

In light of the recent works on distributed sub-gradient methods, we impose integral convexity for the nonlinear node self-dynamics {{in the sense that}} the self-dynamics of a given node is the gradient of some concave function corresponding to that node. The node couplings are assumed to be linear but with switching <b>directed</b> <b>communication</b> graphs. Several sufficient and/or necessary conditions are established for exact or approximate synchronization over the considered complex networks. These results show when and how nonlinear node self-dynamics may cooperate with the linear diffusive coupling, which eventually leads to network synchronization conditions under relaxed connectivity requirements.

25|$|Lobbying, a {{standard}} method used to influence or change {{a piece of}} legislation, is a common practice {{at all levels of}} legislature, including the United States Congress and local legislation. In the U.S., direct lobbying involves direct methods used by a lobbyist when attempting to influence a legislative body. It is done either through <b>direct</b> <b>communication</b> with members or employees of the legislative body, or with a government official who participates in formulating legislation. During the direct lobbying process, the lobbyist introduces statistics that will inform the legislator of any recent information that might otherwise be missed, makes political threats or promises, and supply favors. A common use of direct lobbying is to persuade the general public about a ballot proposal. In this case, the public is considered to be the legislator. This aspect of direct lobbying attempts to alter the legislature before it is placed on the ballot. Communications regarding a ballot measure are also considered direct lobbying. Direct lobbying is different from grassroots lobbying, a process that uses <b>direct</b> <b>communication</b> with the general public, who in turn, contacts and influences the government. Washington, D.C. is the home to many firms that employ these strategies, with 11,140 registered lobbyists currently residing in the area.|$|E
