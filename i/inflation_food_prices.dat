40|$|The {{upheaval}} {{in the global}} food market involving the dramatic increases in crop prices and riots prompted by unaffordable food {{to many of the}} world’ s poorest has placed agriculture back in the public eye. Questions are being raised surrounding what has happened, why, and what can be done. This report has provided an overview of the food crisis and its potential impact on agri-food sector in Ontario. The boom in crop prices is primarily related to demand side factors rather than a supply-side shock from a production shortfall that were behind previous price spikes. There have been some supply side shifts: weather-related shortfalls occurred in the last two crop years, especially for wheat, yield increases are falling due to lagging research and development, and some countries implemented export restrictions. However, the primary push upward is due to structural shifts in demand from growing economies and biofuels (which will continue to grow albeit limited to some extent by the rising prices). Speculative activity has likely contributed to the sudden nature of the increase in price and to a bubble {{at the top of the}} market, but does not alter the fundamental demand and supply trends that have created the declining stocks. Supply cannot adjust immediately due to the annual nature of crop production, so stock levels will continue to be under pressure and crop prices supported for the next several years. The effect of higher crop prices on food prices depends on the share of the food dollar going to the farmer and the share of disposable income spent on food. These shares are large for poor households in developing countries but small for most Canadian consumers. There is a distinction between crop price and food price in Canada. Consequently, domestic food inflation will not be driven by rising crop prices but rather pushed be energy prices which will drive general price <b>inflation.</b> <b>food</b> <b>prices,</b> crop prices, stock levels, Agricultural and Food Policy, International Development,...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} {{identify}} factors driving consumer price inflation {{in the new}} EU member countries from Central and Eastern Europe. Different theories are discussed, including some of particular importance to economies experiencing high economic growth and rapid structural change. The explanatory power of the theories is tested using panel data estimations based on annual data from 1997 to 2007. Convergence- related factors, including the Balassa-Samuelson and the Bhagwati capital-deepening effects, are important drivers of inflation. Import inflation and, by implication, exchange rate developments have an important impact, while the exchange rate regime is unimportant.

40|$|We {{looked at}} how {{international}} <b>food</b> <b>price</b> shocks have impacted local inflation processes in Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru {{in the past}} decade. Using impulse-response analysis coming from cointegrated vars, we find that international <b>food</b> <b>inflation</b> shocks take from one to six quarters to pass through to domestic headline inflation, depending on the country. In addition, by calculating the elasticity of local prices to an international <b>food</b> <b>price</b> shock, we found that this pass-through is not complete. We also {{take a closer look}} at how this type of shock affects local <b>food</b> and core <b>prices</b> separately, and asses the possibility second round effects over core inflation stemming from the shock. We find that a transmission to headline prices does occur, and that part of the transmission is associated with rising core prices both directly and through possible second round effects, which implies a role for monetary policy when such a shock takes place.

The results have reinforced the hypothesis of a significant diversification in the dietary pattern of households in recent years and has found stark differences in the consumption pattern across different income quartiles. The food demand behaviour has been explained using a set of demand elasticities corresponding to major food commodities. The demand elasticities have been estimated using multi-stage budgeting with QUAIDS model and another alternative model, FCDS. The study has revealed that the estimated income elasticities vary across income classes and are lowest for cereals group and highest for horticultural and livestock products. The analysis of price and income effects based on the estimated demand system has suggested that with increase in <b>food</b> <b>price</b> <b>inflation,</b> the demand for staple food (rice, wheat and sugar) may not be affected adversely but, that of high-value food commodities is likely to be affected negatively.

Second, however, the principal component of overall <b>inflation</b> [...] <b>food</b> <b>price</b> <b>inflation</b> [...] is predominantly driven by supply-side factors including both domestic agricultural output shocks and by the passthrough from world <b>prices</b> for <b>food</b> and fuel. Third, the effect of domestic supply conditions on <b>food</b> <b>price</b> <b>inflation</b> points to the asymmetric effects of trade policy in Tanzania; while food imports appear to respond reasonably rapidly to domestic production short-falls, the capacity to export surplus food production is much more muted so that market adjustment in this case occurs through falling prices, other things equal. Fourth, headline inflation exhibits strong seasonality, consistent with weak price-stabilizing effects of trade and incomplete storage. Non-food inflation is, by contrast, broadly non-seasonal. Finally, prices in Tanzania in general are flexible, more so for the food and energy subcomponents but even in the traditionally sticky-price domain of core inflation there is little evidence of inflation persistence overall.

40|$|The {{macroeconomic}} {{effects of}} large <b>food</b> <b>price</b> swings can be broad and far-reaching, including {{the balance of}} payments of importers and exporters, budgets, inflation, and poverty. For market participants and policymakers, managing low frequency volatilityâ€”i. e., the component of volatility that persists for longer than one harvest yearâ€”may be more challenging as uncertainty regarding its persistence {{is likely to be}} higher. This paper measures the low frequency volatility of <b>food</b> commodity spot <b>prices</b> using the spline- GARCH approach. It finds that low frequency volatility is positively correlated across different commodities, suggesting an important role for common factors. It also identifies a number of determinants of low frequency volatility, two of whichâ€”the variation in U. S. inflation and the U. S. dollar exchange rateâ€”explain a relatively large part of the rise in volatility since the mid- 1990 s.
