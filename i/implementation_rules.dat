40|$|We study a two-issue {{bargaining}} {{situation in}} which the surplus of one issue is public information, while that of the other issue is private information to one of the parties. Bargaining is by alternating offers under common time-discounting. The bargaining agenda is determined endogenously since players are free to offer on any number of outstanding issues. Offers must, however, be accepted or rejected in their entirety. Once an offer has been accepted it is not renegotiable. We study this game under two alternative rules for implementing agreements. In the first, partial agreements are implemented as they are reached, in the alternative setting implementation is joint, so that even if an offer on one issue is accepted consumption of this surplus is nevertheless delayed until the second issue is also settled. We show that the order in which issues are bargained in equilibrium is determined by three things: the <b>implementation</b> <b>rule,</b> the type of the informed player and the initial beliefs of the uninformed player. Specifically, an issue-by-issue bargaining agenda arises only when a low-valuation informed player faces an opponent who believes him to be likely a high-valuation type. In contrast to suggestions in the negotiation practitioner literature, such initial agenda offers always involve concessions (much smaller allocations to the informed player than in a bargain without agenda offers.) We also show that it is the <b>implementation</b> <b>rule</b> which determines which issue leads in the agenda. When implementation takes place as agreements are reached, then the issue of known size is negotiated first. If agreements are implemented only after all issues are settled, then, if order is relevant at all, large issues are settled first. All parties prefer the former <b>rules</b> of <b>implementation</b> to the latter. ...|$|R

The law leaves certain important criteria on what is allowed or not with respect to smoking sections to executive-issued regulations, and it is those regulations that were altered in 2007. A legal challenge against the new regulations was filed before the Conseil d'État in 2007, but was rejected. Under the initial <b>implementation</b> <b>rules</b> of the 1991 Évin law, restaurants, cafés etc. just had to provide smoking and non-smoking sections, which in practice were often not well separated.

However, there are more deviations from induced preferences for two-option choice sets, and for alternatives to a simple plurality vote <b>implementation</b> <b>rule.</b> A multinomial probit analysis of choices in tandem with a mixed logit welfare analysis suggests there is a statistically significant but modest degree of bias towards selecting the status quo option.

Five key factors, including the self propensity for development and neighbourhood support, slope constraint, transportation support, terrain and coastal proximity attractions and urban planning support are introduced into the model in a spatially explicit format, which generated a realistic estimation of the extent and timing of Sydney's urban development. With the flexibility of <b>rule</b> <b>implementation</b> within the model, more rules can be added as new 'If-Then' statements to fine-tune the model, provided that {{a good understanding of}} the rule is maintained and accurate data are collected...|$|R
