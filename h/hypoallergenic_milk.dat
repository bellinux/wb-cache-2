5000|$|Donkey milk {{is used as}} {{a natural}} <b>hypoallergenic</b> <b>milk,</b> [...] because it is tolerated by about 90% of infants with food allergies, e.g., cows’ milk protein allergy (CMPA), a common food allergy in {{childhood}} with a prevalence of approximately 3% during the first 3 years of life. [...] However the infants tolerance of donkey milk must be evaluated first subjectively, under medical supervision and after carrying out specific allergy tests.|$|E
40|$|One hundred twenty-two infants {{at risk of}} atopy on {{the basis}} of IgE {{screening}} at birth and family history of atopy were studied. The occurrence of atopic manifestations was analyzed in relation to their diets during the first 3 months of age.

40|$|This article reviews {{recent data}} on the {{stability}} of cow's milk, hen's egg, fish, crustaceae, and meat allergens during food processing. Generally, allergens of food origin are stable and highly potent. Most severe allergic reactions, including fatal events, can be due to ingestion of cow's milk, hen's egg, fish, and shrimp. The allergenicity could be altered potentially by various procedures such as washing, chopping, mincing, heating, canning, storage, and ripening. Separation methods may simply reduce the allergen content of a specific product by e. g. extraction, precipitation, or ultrafiltration. In comparison heating (dry heating, boiling or cooking) and enzymatic digestion affect the allergen structure. Cow's milk and hen's egg allergens retain their allergenicity after common industrial treatments. The production of <b>hypoallergenic</b> cow's <b>milk</b> infant formulas requires extensive conditions of hydrolysis, heating, and/or ultrafiltration. Fish and crustaceae are usually stable to heat treatment, while meat allergens are only partially heat stable. Fish is partially stable and meat is susceptible to enzymatic digestion...|$|R
40|$|This study {{describes}} {{two phases}} of a multi-phase project aiming to validate a mouse model for cow's milk allergy {{to assess the}} potential allergenicity of hydrolysed cow's milk based infant formulas (claim support EC-directive 2006 / 141 /E). The transferability and the discriminatory power of this model was evaluated in 4 research centers. Mice were sensitized by oral gavage with whey or extensively hydrolysed whey (eWH) using cholera toxin as an adjuvant. Whey-specific antibodies, mMCP- 1 levels, anaphylactic shock symptoms, body temperature and the acute allergic skin response were determined upon whey challenge. In phases I and II, all 4 centers detected elevated levels of whey-specific IgE/IgG 1 in whey sensitized animals. Elevated levels of mMCP- 1, anaphylactic symptoms, body temperature drop and acute allergic skin response were scored upon whey challenge in 3 out of 4 research centers. In contrast, none of the evaluated parameters were elevated in eWH orally exposed groups. The cow's milk allergy mouse model is capable to distinguish the sensitizing capacity of complete or hydrolysed cow's milk protein. The model uses straightforward parameters relevant to food allergic responses and can be effectively transferred between different laboratories. We propose this mouse model as a new strategy for the screening of new <b>hypoallergenic</b> cow's <b>milk</b> formulas. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} was to obtain a description of genetic diversity at the four casein genes in the Arbi goat, the native goat breed from Tunisia. DNA from 111 Arbi goats (71 females and 40 bucks) was analysed using PCR-based methods. The most frequent allele at the CSN 1 S 1 locus was B, followed by A, F, N, E and 01. The most frequent allele at CSN 2 locus was C, followed by A and 01. The CSN 2 E allele was not found. The A, C and F alleles prevailed at the CSN 1 S 2 locus, the B allele occurred only in one female goat, in heterozygosis. No subject was found carrying the intermediate CSN 1 S 2 D and the null 0 alleles. The CSN 3 A* variant (A + B) prevailed in both sexes on CSN 3 C. Five of the estimated haplotypes at the casein gene cluster CSN 1 S 1 –CSN 2 –CSN 1 S 2 –CSN 3 showed frequency higher than 0. 05 : BAAA (0. 155), ACAA (0. 150), BACA (0. 114), NCAA (0. 086) and FCFA (0. 060). Three haplotypes were estimated containing the CSN 1 S 1 E allele, having frequencies lower than 3 %. The most frequent haplotypes contained strong alleles at each casein gene, indicating their possible positive effect on milk composition and cheesemaking properties. Unexpectedly, {{two of the most}} frequent haplotype combinations contained a null (N) or a weak (F) allele at CSN 1 S 1 locus. Indeed, a casein haplotype combination including the CSN 1 S 1 N allele has not been evidenced so far in goats. Milk produced from animals carrying these haplotypes could be suitable for the production of <b>hypoallergenic</b> drinking <b>milk,</b> owing to the low casein concentration. This information should be taken into account in breeding programs aiming for genetic improvement of milk characteristics...|$|R
40|$|Background Infants with CMA {{are prone}} to suffer {{malnutrition}} because of the inability to absorb nutrients due to bowel inflammation. Breast milk and hypoallergenic formula is the best nutritional intake in CMA infants. Objective To compare the nutritional status of CMA infants who were consumed breast milk and <b>hypoallergenic</b> <b>milk.</b> Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study included a total of 63 CMA infants aged 3 - 6 months collected by consecutive sampling. Infant’s nutritional status measured by anthropometric exam were divided into well-nourished (- 2 to 2 SD) or malnourished (2 SD). Type of milk consumption were asked directly to parents/caregivers through interviews. Results Most of our subject are well-nourished (75 %). The number of CMA infants who were consumed breast milk or hypoallergenik milk {{is not a lot}} of difference, 51 % vs 49 %, respectively. There is {{no significant difference between the}} nutritional status of CMA infants who consumed breast milk and <b>hypoallergenic</b> <b>milk</b> (P= 0. 61). Conclusion because there were no differences between the nutritional status of CMA infants who consumed breast milk and <b>hypoallergenic</b> <b>milk.</b> Therefore it is recommended giving breast milk or <b>hypoallergenic</b> <b>milk</b> for the first 6 months of life to reduce cow’s milk protein exposure...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAbstractHigh {{pressure}} (HP) {{is recognized}} as the alternative process technology of heat treatment in food production. Although milk was the first food product {{to be treated with}} HP, the allergenicity of HP-treated milk remains to be elucidated. Thus, this study was conducted to investigate the effects of HP treatment on the alleviation of atopic dermatitis (AD) caused by milk in a mouse model. To investigate the effect of HP treatment on the alleviation of AD, Balb/c mice were fed HP-treated milk orally for 7  days following induction of AD with 1 -chloro- 2, 4 -dinitro-benzene (DNCB). Mice fed with HP-treated milk exhibited markedly lower serum IgE level than DNCB-treated mice. These results suggest that HP may be applicable as an alternative process for the development of <b>hypoallergenic</b> <b>milk</b> products...|$|E
40|$|International audienceMilk {{processing}} {{technologies for}} the control of cow’s milk protein allergens are reviewed in this paper. Cow’s milk is a high nutritious food; however, {{it is also one}} of the most common food allergens. The major allergens from cow’s milk have been found to be β-lactoglobulin, α-lactalbumin and caseins. Strategies for destroying or modifying these allergens to eliminate milk allergy are being sought by scientists all over the world. In this paper, the main processing technologies used to prevent and eliminate cow’s milk allergy are presented and discussed, including heat treatment, glycation reaction, high pressure, enzymatic hydrolysis and lactic acid fermentation. Additionally, how regulating and optimizing the processing conditions can help reduce cow’s milk protein allergenicity is being investigated. These strategies should provide valuable support for the development of <b>hypoallergenic</b> <b>milk</b> products in the future...|$|E
40|$|<b>Hypoallergenic</b> cow’s <b>milk</b> (HA) {{formulas}} play {{an important}} role in the prevention of cow’s milk allergy in high risk children as well as in treatment strategies. This thesis describes the development of a murine model for cow’s milk allergy to analyze the residual allergenicity and sensitizing capacities of cow’s milk protein hydrolysates, as present in HA infant formulas. Safety testing of new HA infant formulas in animal models is indispensable to confirm the absence of allergenic peptides in the HA infant formulas. Prevention of cow’s milk allergy with hydrolysed proteins is mainly based on avoidance of the allergen but can also be a result of oral tolerance induction. Therefore, the potency of these hydrolysates to induce oral tolerance and the mechanisms behind these protective effects were topic of investigation described in this thesis. In newborns the mucosal barrier is still immature for optimal absorption of nutrients provided by breastfeeding. The immature status of the immune system combined with a “leaky” immature gut is considered a risk factor to develop immune reactivity to food antigens when introduced too early in life. On the other hand, antigens provided via the oral route are important for the maturation and training of the mucosal immune system. Hence, a delicate balance occurs between avoidance of proteins to prevent early sensitization and the need for proteins to develop oral tolerance. In this thesis we positioned the whey based mouse model for cow’s milk allergy, as a new in vivo model, for safety testing of HA infant formulas. We started to validate the mouse model in a ring trial with four independent research facilities. Using this model, the studies described in this thesis have shown that a partial WH with limited sensitizing capacities was capable to induce oral tolerance to whey proteins in mice and that this protective effect can be enhanced using non-digestible oligosaccharides. Most likely CD 11 c+CD 103 + and Foxp 3 + regulatory T-cells contribute to these protective effects. The partial WH induced protection could be adoptively transferred using MLN cells of tolerized mice when provided to naﶥ recipient mice prior to whey sensitization. This indicates the importance of MLN in the transfer of local to systemic tolerance. It was observed that sensitization with cow’s milk proteins can result in IgLC-dependent acute allergic and intestinal hypersensitivity responses indicating that IgLC is a promising new biomarker for food allergy. Besides its role in the induction of cow’s milk allergy it was demonstrated that IgLC might contribute in the oral tolerance induction to whey proteins as wel...|$|R
40|$|Resumen del póster presentado al Food Allergy an Anaphylaxis Meeting celebrado en Nice (Francia) del 7 al 9 de febrero de 2013. [Background]: Food is {{the most}} {{frequent}} cause of allergy during the early childhood, and possibly the only trigger within {{the first two years}} of life. The foods commonly involved in are cow´s milk and hen´s egg. So far, strict avoidance of the responsible food in any of its forms is usually the only available treatment. Thus, obtaining new hypoallergenic foods or food ingredients derived from milk or egg to be consumed directly or added to other foods would be of great benefit for the different stakeholders (patients, family, industries, caterings, etc). A strategy to reduce food allergenicity relies within its own processing. It is well known that food processing induces important structural changes that may affect protein allergenicity. Those changes might be due to epitope destruction, easier access to epitopes due to protein unfolding, etc. Technological treatments such as hydrolysis have been extensively studied, but its potential use to produce hypoallergenic food need more research. The purpose of this study was to test different enzymes commonly used in the food industry to obtain <b>hypoallergenic</b> hydrolysates from <b>milk</b> proteins. [Methods]: Principal allergens from milk, β-casein (β-CN) and β-lactoglobulin (β-Lg), were hydrolysed with Alcalase, Neutrase and Bromelain at different time points. Hydrolysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and RP-HPLC. Selected samples were tested against 6 patients’ IgE sera by inhibition ELISA respectively. [Results]: Higher values of IC 50 for β-CN and β-Lg hydrolysates were obtained at higher incubation times when Alcalase or Neutrase were employed as enzymes. β-CN is hydrolyzed more efficiently showing higher IC 50 values than β-Lg, at similar incubation times. Between them, Neutrase produced hydrolysates with lower allergenicity. On the other hand, Bromelain did not have any influence on β-Lg hydrolysis or allergenicity, but it showed a discrete effect on β-CN hydrolysis with a moderate influence on its allergenicity. [Conclusion]: Neutrase is a promising enzyme in order to obtain hypoallergenic hydrolysates from β-casein. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Mestrado em Engenharia Zootécnica - Produção Animal - Instituto Superior de Agronomia / Faculdade de Medicina VeterináriaThe present work is {{a project}} of a donkey (Equus asinus) farm to produce milk for commercialization, after {{transformation}} and conservation processes. The final product will be jennies lyophilized milk. At {{the beginning of the}} project the main focus was the study of the breed Asinina of Miranda because those were the animals chosen as milk producers. Then it was also important to study this type of milk once jenny milk has many interesting properties, such as the fact that is a <b>hypoallergenic</b> <b>milk</b> and also because its constitution is similar to human milk. This type of milk is gaining the attention of specialists and producers for these reasons. The project was developed in a 46, 675 ha area of land in Beja (Alentejo). The animals were divided in separate facilities according to the production cycle. The production plan was conceived in order to reach the desired final product. After characterization and organization of the farm, financial analysis of the project was elaborated. If the producer adopts the market price for the final product (up to 300 €/kg of lyophilized milk) the project will be viabl...|$|E
40|$|The 6 main milk {{proteins}} in cattle are encoded by highly polymorphic genes characterized by several nonsynonymous and synonymous mutations, {{with up to}} 47 protein variants identified. Such an extensive variation was used for linkage analysis with {{the description of the}} casein cluster more than 30 yr ago and has been applied to animal breeding for several years. Casein haplotype effects on productive traits have been investigated considering information on the whole casein complex. Moreover, mutations within the noncoding sequences have been shown to affect the specific protein expression and, as a consequence, milk composition and cheesemaking. Milk protein variants are also a useful tool for breed characterization, diversity, and phylogenetic studies. In addition, they are involved in various aspects of human nutrition. First, the occurrence of alleles associated with a reduced content of different caseins might be exploited for the production of milk with particular nutritional qualities; that is, <b>hypoallergenic</b> <b>milk.</b> On the other hand, the frequency of these alleles can be decreased by selection of sires using simple DNA tests, thereby increasing the casein content in milk used for cheesemaking. Furthermore, the biological activity of peptides released from milk protein digestion can be affected by amino acid exchanges or deletions resulting from gene mutations. Finally, the gene-culture coevolution between cattle milk protein genes and human lactase genes, which has been recently highlighted, is impressive proof of the nonrandom occurrence of milk protein genetic variation over the centuries...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. Cystic {{fibrosis}} (CF) is a multisystemic {{autosomal recessive}} disease most frequently recognized by characteristic respiratory and/or digestive manifestations. Exceptionally rare, {{as is the}} case with the infant we are presenting, the initial sign of the disease can be nutritional deficiency dermatitis (NDD). Case Outline. A three-month-old male infant of young and healthy non-consanguineous parents, born at term after the first uneventful pregnancy, was hospitalized due to atopic dermatitis (AD) -like skin changes, failure to thrive and normochromic anemia (Hb 60 g/L). As exclusively breast-fed, failure to thrive was attributed to hypogalactia and skin changes to nutritional allergy, so that, besides exclusion of cow’s milk protein and other highly allergenic foods in mother’s diet, <b>hypoallergenic</b> <b>milk</b> formula was added to the child’s diet. However, dietetic measures were without effect, and the child was re-hospitalized at age 4. 5 months, this time in the condition of severe malnutrition with hypoproteinemic edemas, extensive dermatitis, moderate hepatosplenomegaly and recurrent normochromic anemia (Hb 57 g/L). After plasma-free erythrocyte transfusion, correction of hypoalbuminemia and two-week parenteral and semi-elementary nutrition resulted in gradual recovery of the child, also including the resolution of skin changes. Having in mind the clinical course of the disease, as well as the response to applied therapeutic measures, CF was suspected as the cause of the child’s problems, which was also confirmed by a high level of sweat chlorine (92 mmol/L) and DNA analysis (∆F 508 /∆F 508). Conclusion. Our experience indicates that NDD, as the initial manifestation of CF, should be also kept in mind in differential diagnosis of the infant’s AD-like changes...|$|E
