40|$|The {{question}} of when directors should bear personal liability for {{their role in the}} conduct of a corporation has always been controversial. Significantly,however, {{it is now clear that}} directors themselves perceive that this risk of personal liability is having a profound negative effect on both their desire to act in the role and the performance of their companies. While the risk takes various forms, directors have identified that they are most fearful of <b>derivative</b> <b>liability</b> such as is present in occupational health and safety laws.

Professor Dennis J. Baker provides the most detailed analysis of these provisions. See Dennis J. Baker, Glanville Williams: Textbook of Criminal Law, (London: Sweet & Maxwell, 2015) at Chapter 20. In a recent article, Baker [...] "tries to identify the limits of <b>derivative</b> <b>liability</b> and its alternatives. In this article, I provide a doctrinal and theoretical analysis of the new independent direct liability offenses found in section 44-46 of Britain’s Serious Crime Act 2007 to highlight how independent offenses punishing acts of assistance and encouragement are fairer than making accessories and perpetrators equally liable under the law of complicity. I also examine the conduct element for these offenses {{to determine whether it}} is apt for catching the sort of reckless encouragement that is often present in the joint enterprise (common purpose) complicity cases and conclude that it is. The main shortfall of the offenses found in the Serious Crime Act 2007 is that they do not cover reckless participation. I conclude that section 44 covers only intentional (inchoate) participation and that section 45 covers only oblique intentional (inchoate) participation. It is submitted that section 45 of the Act of 2007 should be supplemented with a section 45A offense criminalizing reckless (inchoate) participation. Section 45 is an independent offense that criminalizes personal wrongdoing and as it is not a form of <b>derivative</b> <b>liability,</b> but rather personal liability, it allows for fair labeling and proportionate punishment for the independent wrong involved in encouraging and assisting another to perpetrate a crime. Therefore, a variant of the section 45 offense with recklessness as its mental element would also allow for fair labeling and proportionate punishment." [...] See Dennis J.

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} how firms’ {{risk communication}} and derivatives usage affect firm value and profitability. We have conducted content analyses of 447 annual reports on 66 companies {{listed on the}} Oslo Stock Exchange for the years 2006 to 2014. We used risk communicating words, {{as a proportion of}} the annual reports’ total words, and NUES ratings provided by EY, as variables for risk communication. For derivatives, both a dummy variable for usage/non-usage, and fair derivative values were investigated. The fair derivative values were measured as a proportion of the companies' total assets, where we considered asset <b>derivatives,</b> <b>liability</b> <b>derivatives,</b> and net derivatives. From the bivariate analyses, we discovered that risk communication had a non-linear relationship with firm value and profitability. At the same time, we observed that companies' focus on, and work with, risk communication had increased in the period from 2006 to 2014. This builds on the findings of Kallenberg (2002), which found that companies' risk and risk management efforts had increased from 1987 to 2001. In addition, from the initial analysis of the effect of derivatives usage, we found a negative correlation with firm value, but positive for profitability. The results of the multivariate analyses indicated that risk communication did not have any measurable impact on profitability or firm value. For the derivatives usage, we found that companies that use derivatives have higher firm value and profitability than non-users. The use of financial derivatives to reduce risk therefore appears to give a competitive advantage over those who do not choose to use derivatives. This supports Smith and Stulz (1985) who argue that financial risk management has an effect on firm value, in addition to several renown empirical studies. From fair values, we found that asset derivatives {{have a negative impact on}} firm value, but positive for profitability, given that you control for companies' profitability in measuring firm value. For profitability, we found that the net value of derivatives had a positive effect, but did not affect firm value. <b>Liability</b> <b>derivatives</b> are shown with no significant impact on either firm value or profitability...|$|R

Members of this class include search engines, social networks, internet service providers, website operators, hosts, and payment gateways, which together exert a critical and growing influence upon national and global economies, governments and cultures. This research examines who should face legal responsibility when wrongdoers utilise these services tortiously to cause harm to others. It has three parts. Part 1 seeks {{to understand the nature of}} an intermediary and how its liability differs from the liability of primary defendants. It classifies intermediaries according to a new layered, functional taxonomy and argues that many instances of secondary liability in English private law reflect shared features and underlying policies, including optimal loss-avoidance and <b>derivative</b> <b>liability</b> premised on an assumption of responsibility. Part 2 analyses intermediaries’ monetary liability for secondary wrongdoing in two areas of English law: defamation and copyright. It traces the historical evolution of these doctrines at successive junctures in communications technology, before identifying and defending limits on that liability which derive from three main sources: (i) in-built limits contained in definitions of secondary wrongdoing; (ii) European safe harbours and general limits on remedies; and (iii) statutory defences and exceptions. Part 3 examines intermediaries’ non-monetary liability, in particular their obligations to disclose information about alleged primary wrongdoers and to cease facilitating wrongdoing where it is necessary and proportionate to do so. It proposes a new suite of non-facilitation remedies designed to restrict access to tortious internet materials, remove such materials from search engines, and reduce the profitability of wrongdoing. It concludes with several recommendations to improve the effectiveness and proportionality of remedies by reference to considerations of architecture, anonymity, efficient procedures, and fundamental rights.

40|$|This article {{presents}} FVA and CVA of a bilateral derivative in a coherent manner, based on {{recent developments in}} fair value accounting and ISDA standards. We argue that a <b>derivative</b> <b>liability,</b> after primary risk factors being hedged, resembles in economics an issued variable funding note, and should be priced at the market rate of the issuer's debt. For the purpose of determining the fair value, the party on the liability side is economically neutral to make a deposit to the other party, which earns his current debt rate and effectively provides funding and hedging for the party holding the derivative asset. The newly derived partial differential equation for an option discounts the derivative's receivable part with counterparty's curve and payable part with own financing curve. The price difference from the counterparty risk free price, or total counterparty risk adjustment, is precisely defined by discounting {{the product of the}} risk free price and the credit spread at the local liability curve. Subsequently the adjustment can be broken into a default risk component [...] CVA and a funding component [...] FVA, consistent with a simple note's fair value treatment and in accordance with the usual understanding of a bond's credit spread consisting of a CDS spread and a basis. As for FVA, we define a cost [...] credit funding adjustment (CFA) and a benefit [...] debit funding adjustment (DFA), in parallel to CVA and DVA and attributed to counterparty's and own funding basis. This resolves a number of outstanding FVA debate issues, such as double counting, violation of the law of one price, misuse of cash flow discounting, and controversial hedging of own default risk. It also allows an integrated implementation strategy and reuse of existing CVA infrastructure. Comment: 21 pages, 1 figure. The 2 nd Fixed Income and Operational Risk Conference USA, May 201...|$|R
40|$|Something {{is missing}} from Title VII-a modern and fully {{functional}} theory of direct employer liability for individual discrimination claims. Courts largely focus on finding employers indirectly liable for discrimination through the acts of their agents, rather than viewing the employer as the culpable actor in appropriate circumstances. This Article posits that five major problems with Title VII can be eliminated or reduced by once again recognizing the importance of direct employer liability and by re-theorizing direct liability using modern conceptions of corporate character. Borrowing the emerging concept of corporate character from criminal law and corporate law scholarship, this Article attempts to demonstrate how employment discrimination law can benefit from a fuller conception of direct liability. Undergirded by a realist view of the corporation, the concept of corporate character posits that the corporation has a life and intent of its own, separate from the individual actions of its agents. This Article combines current scholarship regarding corporate intent in the corporate and criminal contexts with a fair interpretation of Title VII 2 ̆ 7 s text, case law, and theoretical underpinnings to demonstrate that direct corporate liability-as retheorized in this Article-can be a viable, and powerful, tool in employment discrimination cases. In Part I, this Article provides the first, comprehensive historical account of agency developments under Title VII, which helps to explain the statute 2 ̆ 7 s present overreliance on indirect liability. Part II continues by reviewing the employment discrimination literature to outline the major difficulties caused by overreliance on <b>derivative</b> <b>liability.</b> Part III outlines the corporate character doctrine being developed outside the employment discrimination context.

40|$|This article {{sheds light}} on an {{evolving}} area of preclusion law—nonmutual claim preclusion and the related issue of privity between parties to a vicarious liability relationship—that merits scholarly attention and greater doctrinal clarity. To illustrate, if an injured party asserts a negligence claim against a truck driver, and judgment is rendered against the injured party based on a finding of the driver’s nonnegligence, may the driver’s employer invoke claim preclusion or issue preclusion in a subsequent action by the injured party? Are the employer and his employee in privity with each other {{despite the lack of}} mutuality? When this fact pattern actually became the subject of a sample multiple-choice question published in 2014 by the National Committee of Bar Examiners, several procedural scholars responded that a plausible case could be made for either of two of the four choices—claim preclusion or issue preclusion. Their various responses reveal a need to provide a measure of coherence to this corner of preclusion law. These differing doctrinal views raise three significant issues addressed in this article. First, does claim preclusion bar the suit against the truck driver’s employer or only issue preclusion? Second, if the employer can reap the benefits of claim preclusion, is nonmutual claim preclusion available in the first instance or only as a fallback if issue preclusion is unavailable? Third, to the extent that nonmutual claim preclusion is applicable, is it justified doctrinally as an extension of privity to include employee and employer or as an exception to privity? This Article proposes that adding <b>derivative</b> <b>liability</b> relationships to the recognized categories of substantive legal relationships that “are sometimes collectively referred to as ‘privity’” and applying nonmutual claim preclusion, even where issue preclusion would otherwise have been available, is—and {{as a matter of policy}} should be—the next logical step in the evolution of preclusion law. The law of preclusion has evolved progressively beyond the formalist rule of mutuality that traditionally served as the basis for the so-called “narrow and broad exceptions” to the doctrine of collateral estoppel. As a consequence of the erosion of mutuality, a substantial number of American jurisdictions apply those exceptions to claim preclusion by expanding the concept of privity to include vicarious liability relationships...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{new evidence}} {{on the extent to}} which non-financial firms use financial derivatives to avoid taxes.

I use new derivative disclosures required by SFAS 161 to collect detailed information about firms’ use of derivatives. I find a negative association between cash effective tax rates and the fair value of hedging derivative assets. This finding implies that firms defer recognition of gains on hedging derivatives to lower cash taxes. Furthermore, I find an association between cash effective tax rates and both non-hedging <b>derivative</b> assets and <b>liabilities.</b> This finding is consistent with firms aggressively avoiding cash taxes using non-hedging derivatives by selectively choosing when to recognize gains and losses. In addition, I find no association between GAAP effective tax rates and derivatives, implying that firms in my sample do not use derivatives to manage earnings through the tax expense...|$|R

Landfills also are critical resource areas for the control of greenhouse gases. Landfill materials decompose into methane, a greenhouse gas that is more than twenty times more potent—molecule for molecule—than carbon dioxide. This Article traces the molecular composition of waste in landfills, analyzing the chemical stew that brews in these repositories. Without doubt, landfills in America are brownfields.

40|$|Part I of this Article {{explains}} that, {{viewed in}} light of the evolution of the derivative work concept in the copyright revision process, the exclusive right to prepare derivative works is narrower in scope and more bounded than commentators have often feared. Part II considers characteristics of the nine exemplary derivatives in the statutory definition and explains why they should inform a sound interpretation of the last clause in the definition. By including these nine examples, Congress intended to provide guidance about the types of derivatives covered by this right. To be consistent with the text of the statute, the legislative history, and the constitutional purpose of copyright, <b>derivative</b> work <b>liability</b> should only be imposed under the last clause of the definition if the plaintiff 2 ̆ 7 s claim is analogous to {{one or more of the}} exemplary derivatives in the statutory definition. Part III discusses three plausible justifications for the grant of the derivative work right that, properly understood, constrain its reach. Part IV considers several provisions and doctrines of U. S. copyright law that further limit the reach of the derivative work right. The statutory exclusion of useful articles from the scope of copyright protection, for instance, meaningfully limits the derivative work right in a manner consistent with the constitutional purpose of copyright law and policies favoring ongoing innovation and competition. Fair use protects free-expression interests of next-generation authors, along with the first-sale limit, which protects privacy and autonomy interests of those who have purchased copies of copyrighted works. Part V discusses a handful of derivative-use cases that have given overbroad interpretations to the derivative work right and explains why these decisions are unsound...|$|R

The objective of the paper is to provide a foundation for further work which will look at the practical development and implementation of such models. The different frameworks that we describe are all based on positive-interest-rate modelling frameworks since the force of mortality can be treated in a similar way to the short-term, risk-free rate of interest. The frameworks discussed are short-rate models, forward-mortality models, positive-mortality models and mortality market models...|$|R
40|$|This Article {{makes the}} case for a {{decentralized}} risk management strategy for identifying and defusing future bubble markets. It suggests how the government can enlist private 2 ̆ 2 gatekeeper guarantors 2 ̆ 2 to provide integrated insurance and monitoring roles to complement the government’s management of systemic risks. It proposes the enactment of a federal mandate that systemically significant financial entities (or participants in systemically significant financial sectors) secure private guarantees to cover a percentage of their potential liabilities (above a loss threshold). Gatekeeper guarantors would act as “circuit breakers” of systemic risk by serving as self-interested monitors of risk taking and tying clients’ coverage to ongoing constraints on risk taking. Gatekeeper guarantors would serve as “bailout buffers” by providing financial backing in the event of defaults and thereby mitigating the government’s potential liability exposure. This expansive role would come with government oversight to ensure that gatekeeper guarantors satisfy reserve requirements, so that they can credibly serve as sea walls in the face of future financial tsunamis. This Article will illustrate the potential for decentralized risk management by showing how a mandate for private reinsurance (or its functional equivalent) may reduce systemic risks in the over-the-counter derivatives market. Reinsurers would bear a percentage of <b>derivative</b> participants’ <b>liability,</b> which would incentivize reinsurers to charge premiums reflecting their risk assessments and to monitor and condition clients’ liability exposure. The repeat-player status of reinsurers would position them to force derivatives’ participants to change their risk exposure as market conditions unfold. Reinsurers would have leverage to push insured parties to demand disclosures from counter-parties, thereby heightening transparency and reducing risks for their clients and the market as a whole. Government monitoring could build on existing state oversight of reinsurers, but provide teeth with expanded reserve requirements to ensure reinsurers are equipped to handle this role...|$|R

40|$|This article {{proposes a}} series of {{copyright}} reforms {{to pave the way}} for digital library projects like Project Gutenberg, the Internet Archive, and Google Print, which promise to make much of the world 2 ̆ 7 s knowledge easily searchable and accessible from anywhere. Existing law frustrates digital library growth and development by granting overlapping, overbroad, and near-perpetual copyrights in books, art, audiovisual works, and digital content. Digital libraries would benefit from an expanded public domain, revitalized fair use doctrine and originality requirement, rationalized systems for copyright registration and transfer, and a new framework for compensating copyright owners for online infringement without imposing <b>derivative</b> copyright <b>liability</b> on technologists. This article 2 ̆ 7 s case for reform begins with rolling back the copyright term extensions of recent years, which were upheld by the Supreme Court in Eldred v. Reno. Indefinitely renewable copyrights threaten to marginalize Internet publishing and online libraries by entangling them in endless disputes regarding the rights to decades- or centuries-old works. Similarly, digital library projects are becoming unnecessarily complicated and expensive to undertake due to the assertion by libraries and copyright holding companies of exclusive rights over unoriginal reproductions of public domain works, and the demands of authors that courts block all productive digital uses of their already published but often out-of-print works. Courts should refuse to allow the markets in digital reproductions to be monopolized in this way, and Congress must introduce greater certainty into copyright licensing by requiring more frequent registration and recordation of rights. Courts should also consider the digitizing of copyrighted works for the benefit of the public to be fair use, particularly where only excerpts of the works are posted online for public perusal. A digital library like Google Print needs a degree of certainty - which existing law does not provide - that it will not be punished for making miles of printed matter instantly searchable in the comfort of one 2 ̆ 7 s home, or for rescuing orphan works from obscurity or letting consumers preview a few pages of a book before buying it. Finally, the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s recognition of liability for inducement of digital copyright infringement in the Grokster case may have profoundly negative consequences for digital library technology. The article discusses how recent proposals for statutory file-sharing licenses may reduce the bandwidth and storage costs of digital libraries, and thereby make them more comprehensive and accessible...|$|R
40|$|Financial and {{insurance}} theories explain that large widely-held corporations manage corporate risks if {{doing so is}} costective to reduce frictional costs such as taxes, agency costs and financial distress costs. A large number of previous empirical studies, most in the U. S., have tested the hypotheses underlying corporate risk management with financial derivative instruments. In order to quantify corporate hedge demand, most previous studies have used the ratio of principal notional amount of derivatives to company size, although they recognize that company size is not an appropriate proxy for financial risk. This paper analyzes the interest-rate-risk hedge demand by Australian companies, measured through the ratio of principal notional amount of interest rate <b>derivatives</b> to interest-rate-riskbearing <b>liabilities.</b> Modern panel data methods are used, with two panel data sets from 1998 to 2003 (1102 and 465 observations, respectively). Detailed information about interest-rate-risk exposures was available after manual data collection from financial annual reports, which was only possible due to specific reporting requirements in Australian accounting standards. Regarding {{the analysis of the}} extent of hedge, our measurement of interest-rate-risk exposures generates some significant results di erent from those found in previous studies. For example, this study shows that total leverage (total debt ratio) is not significantly important to interest-rate-risk hedge demand and that, instead, this demand is related to the specific risk exposure in the interest bearing part of the firms liabilities. This study finds significant relations of interest-rate-risk hedge to company size, floating-interest-rate debt ratio, annual log returns, and company industry type (utilities and non-banking financial institutions) ...|$|R

Based on 2009 FDIC and individually collected firm level data covering gross notional, gross positive (negative) fair value and the netted <b>derivatives</b> assets and <b>liabilities</b> for 202 financial firms which includes 20 SIFIs, the bilateral flows are empirically calibrated to reflect data-based constraints. This produces a tiered network with a distinct highly clustered central core of 12 SIFIs that account for 78 percent of all bilateral exposures {{and a large number}} of  financial intermediaries (FIs) on the periphery.

As these SIFIs account for the bulk of capital in the system, ipso facto no bank among the top tier can be allowed to fail, highlighting the untenable implicit socialized guarantees needed for these markets to operate at their current levels. Systemic risk costs of highly connected SIFIs nodes are not priced into their holding of capital or collateral. An eigenvector centrality based ‘super-spreader’ tax has been designed and tested for its capacity to reduce the potential socialized losses from failure of SIFIs...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, I analyse the {{influence}} of financial economic theory on financial reporting practice. This influence has manifested itself in {{the increasing use of}} economic methods introduced into practice by the publication and implementation of certain economics-based accounting standards. I provide three illustrative case studies in the areas of pensions, financial <b>derivatives</b> and contingent <b>liabilities,</b> focusing on projects by the FASB, IASC/B and the ASC/B. To explain the increase in the use of economic methods in financial reporting practice, and their pattern of emergence, I draw on the genealogical and political economy approaches. I supplement these methodologies with a theory of causality by developing a qualitative causal model. This model, which I call the Causal Constellation Model, aims to explain the success of projects to introduce economics-based standards in terms of five individually necessary and jointly sufficient conditions. These conditions relate to the economic environment, the conceptual aims of financial reporting, the legitimacy of economic methods, the absence of institutional opposition and the effectiveness of advocates on the boards of standard setting institutions. The primary sources of evidence for my research are documents published by standard setting institutions, academic research and a number of interviews with high-level individuals, many of whom were directly involved {{in the development of the}} standards in question. An unexpected finding is that interactions between different projects appear to generate sequences of change in financial reporting practice, spanning different areas of accounting and different regulatory jurisdictions. Thus, outcomes of earlier projects seem to create possibilities for later projects and shape their outcomes. In spite of the inevitable limitations of such case-study based, qualitative work, the model offers a plausible and apparently robust explanation of the overall pattern of influence of financial economics on the practice of financial reporting...|$|R
40|$|The {{implications}} of the western financial and economic crisis brought the global financial system into a system-threatening imbalance. Even though a total breakdown of the financial system has been averted, all parties concerned are still confronted with the consequences. Thereby, banking institutes are challenged by {{a high level of}} complexity and dynamics introduced by new regulatory frameworks, turmoil in capital markets and cautious customers. All these changes result in the need for banks to draw the necessary conclusions for their individual strategies to survive in a fiercer competition. Against this background and challenges, numerous German savings banks currently re-examine opportunities to optimise their (net commission) earning structure by offering <b>liability</b> <b>derivatives</b> to their clients. The aim of this thesis is to provide a better understanding of such derivative sales in German savings banks by developing a conceptual framework exploring and explaining the critical factors for establishing a business-level strategy for this highly ambivalent business field against the background of the crisis. Taking the ontological and epistemological position of a constructivist, the strategy of inquiry was informed by a (qualitative) grounded theory approach, using semi-structured interviews with experts as data gathering technique. The underlying emphasis on three different German savings banks in relation to size, location and business strategy offered a solid base to meet the set research objectives and to establish new primary findings. Based on an exploration of the institutes’ courses of action, a discussion of the financial crisis’ influences and derived expert views on success and sustainability for the business field, five main categories were elaborated, which differentiate successful from less successful business units. For each main category a partial model was created explaining interdependencies and causalities. By consolidating these findings and partial models, an initial conceptual framework was developed, which supports the implementation of a possible successful and sustainable business-level strategy for derivative sales in German savings banks. The improved understanding and the conceptualisation of derivative sales in savings banks are highly relevant for practice and theory as they offer in-depth-expertise of a market-environment which is swiftly and radically changing but still has high potential for increasing customer loyalty as well as profits and thus can generate competitive advantages for the institutes offering these services...|$|R

A person my become particeps criminis in one of two ways,i. e., by physically perpetrating this crime or by instigating, encouraging the perpetrator to do this. The first offender is usually called a principal in the crime, and the latter of them an accessory, or secondary party in its commission. For the reasons noted at the outset of Chapter One, the major stress in this study is upon the statement and evaluation of the law relating to criminal participation as an accessory. Nonetheless, it will of course be frequently necessary to consider the position of the principal in some detail in analysing the law of complicity. This analysis was motivated ay two ambitions, both of them traditional. The first of them was to state the law as it presently stands. This was felt to be justified, in particular, given that prior to this one (which was published in an earlier, and somewhat different form by the Law Book Co. Ltd. of Sydney, in July of last year), no monograph-length study had been undertaken of this topic in any of the common law jurisdictions. The seoond objective, one obviously dependent upon the fulfilment of the first, was to evaluate the effectiveness of this branch of the law and to determine whether or not it is in need of legislative reform in each of the subject jurisdictions, and if so, then in what terms. I have concluded, (1) that the law should continue to recognise a specifically derivative form of accessorial <b>liability</b> (<b>derivative,</b> in the sense that the person who instigates, encourages or assists the principal offender to commit a crime is made liable for this crime,rather than for an independent offence of an ancillary character); and (2) that the law of complicity - and in particular, that part of it dealing with accessorial liability - is susceptible to reform at a number of levels, in each of the subject jurisdictions. I have sought to take account of the law as it stood in the subject jurisdictions in the last months of 1980...|$|R
40|$|The present work {{tries to}} display a {{comprehensive}} and comparative study of the different legal and regulatory problems involved in international securitization transactions. First, an introduction to securitization is provided, with {{the basic elements of}} the transaction, followed by the different varieties of it, including dynamic securitization and synthetic securitization structures. Together with this introduction to the intricacies of the structure, a insight into the influence of securitization in the financial and economic crisis of 2007 - 2009 is provided too; as well as an overview of the process of regulatory competition and cooperation that constitutes the framework for the international aspects of securitization. The next Chapter focuses on the aspects that constitute the foundations of structured finance: the inception of the vehicle, and the transfer of risks associated to the securitized assets, with particular emphasis on the validity of those elements, and how a securitization transaction could be threatened at its root. In this sense, special importance is given to the validity of the trust as an instrument of finance, to the assignment of future receivables or receivables in block, and to the importance of formalities for the validity of corporations, trusts, assignments, etc., and the interaction of such formalities contained in general corporate, trust and assignment law with those contemplated under specific securitization regulations. Then, the next Chapter (III) focuses on creditor protection aspects. As such, we provide some insights on the debate on the capital structure of the firm, and its inadequacy to assess the financial soundness problems inherent to securitization. Then, we proceed to analyze the importance of rules on creditor protection in the context of securitization. The corollary is in the rules in case of insolvency. In this sense, we divide the cases where a party involved in the transaction goes bankrupt, from those where the transaction itself collapses. Finally, we focus on the scenario where a substance over form analysis may compromise some of the elements of the structure (notably the limited liability of the sponsor, and/or the transfer of assets) by means of veil piercing, substantive consolidation, or recharacterization theories. Once these elements have been covered, the next Chapters focus on the regulatory aspects involved in the transaction. Chapter IV is more referred to “market” regulations, i. e. those concerned with information disclosure and other rules (appointment of the indenture trustee, and elaboration of a rating by a rating agency) concerning the offering of asset-backed securities to the public. Chapter V, on the other hand, focuses on “prudential” regulation of the entity entrusted with securitizing assets (the so-called Special Purpose vehicle), and other entities involved in the process. Regarding the SPV, a reference is made to licensing requirements, restriction of activities and governance structures to prevent abuses. Regarding the sponsor of the transaction, a focus is made on provisions on sound originating practices, and the servicing function. Finally, we study accounting and banking regulations, including the Basel I and Basel II Frameworks, which determine the consolidation of the SPV, and the de-recognition of the securitized asset from the originating company’s balance-sheet, as well as the posterior treatment of those assets, in particular by banks. Chapters VI-IX are concerned with liability matters. Chapter VI is an introduction to the different sources of liability. Chapter VII focuses on the liability by the SPV and its management for the information supplied to investors, the management of the asset pool, and the breach of loyalty (or fiduciary) duties. Chapter VIII rather refers to the liability of the originator as a result of such information and statements, but also as a result of inadequate and reckless originating or servicing practices. Chapter IX finally focuses on third parties entrusted with the soundness of the transaction towards the market, the so-called gatekeepers. In this respect, we make special emphasis on the liability of indenture trustees, underwriters and rating agencies. Chapters X and XI focus on the international aspects of securitization. Chapter X contains a conflicts of laws analysis of the different aspects of structured finance. In this respect, a study is made of the laws applicable to the vehicle, to the transfer of risks (either by assignment or by means of <b>derivatives</b> contracts), to <b>liability</b> issues; and a study is also made of the competent jurisdiction (and applicable law) in bankruptcy cases; as well as in cases where a substance-over-form is performed. Then, special attention is also devoted to the role of financial and securities regulations; as well as to their territorial limits, and extraterritoriality problems involved. Chapter XI supplements the prior Chapter, for it analyzes the limits to the States’ exercise of regulatory power by the personal and “market” freedoms included in the US Constitution or the EU Treaties. A reference is also made to the (still insufficient) rules from the WTO Framework, and their significance to the States’ recognition and regulation of securitization transactions. ...|$|R
