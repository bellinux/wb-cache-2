5|$|Despite his pessimism {{expressed}} to the Dutch {{government and the}} mandate {{he had been given}} to surrender the Army, General Winkelman awaited the outcome of events, avoiding actually capitulating until <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>absolutely</b> necessary. In this he was perhaps motivated by a desire to engage the opposing German troops for as long as possible, to assist the Allied war effort. In the early morning of 14 May, though the situation remained critical, a certain calm was evident in the Dutch Headquarters.|$|E
5|$|The British Government {{called on}} Keynes's {{expertise}} during the First World War. While {{he did not}} formally re-join the civil service in 1914, Keynes travelled to London at the government's request {{a few days before}} hostilities started. Bankers had been pushing for the suspension of specie payments – the convertibility of banknotes into gold – but with Keynes's help the Chancellor of the Exchequer (then Lloyd George) was persuaded {{that this would be a}} bad idea, as it would hurt the future reputation of the city if payments were suspended before <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>absolutely</b> necessary.|$|E
5|$|If the {{controller}} were to background garbage collect {{all of the}} spare blocks before <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>absolutely</b> necessary, new data written from the host could be written without having to move any data in advance, letting the performance operate at its peak speed. The trade-off {{is that some of}} those blocks of data are actually not needed by the host and will eventually be deleted, but the OS did not tell {{the controller}} this information. The result is that the soon-to-be-deleted data is rewritten to another location in the flash memory, increasing the write amplification. In some of the SSDs from OCZ the background garbage collection clears up {{only a small number of}} blocks then stops, thereby limiting the amount of excessive writes. Another solution is to have an efficient garbage collection system which can perform the necessary moves in parallel with the host writes. This solution is more effective in high write environments where the SSD is rarely idle. The SandForce SSD controllers and the systems from Violin Memory have this capability.|$|E

25|$|There {{was also}} a desire {{on the part of}} Soviet {{officials}} to forestall any evacuations until <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>absolutely</b> necessary, the marching orders were often to continue factory production until the eve of occupation before hurriedly dismantling and transporting factory equipment, and destroying what couldn't be moved in time. As a result of the delay in evacuations, they were often carried out under German aerial bombardment, which led to additional confusion among the frightened citizenry. Historian Rebecca Manley describes these early evacuations as being charactered by “three phenomena: the 'flight' of officials, the flight of the population, and 'panic'”.|$|E
25|$|At {{the age of}} fifteen, {{he married}} a cousin the {{daughter}} of Mordechai Frances and, being amply provided for financially, {{he was able to}} continue his studies. Though he initially may have pursued a career in business, he soon turned to asceticism and mysticism. Around the age of twenty-two he became engrossed {{in the study of the}} Zohar (a major work of the Kabbalah that had recently been printed for the first time) and adopted the life of a recluse. Retreating to the banks of the Nile for seven years, he secluded himself in an isolated cottage, giving himself up entirely to meditation. He visited his family only on Shabbat. But even at home, he would not utter a word, even to his wife. When <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>absolutely</b> necessary for him to say something, he would say it in the fewest number of words possible, and then, only in Hebrew.|$|E

500|$|On 9 June the Allies held {{a conference}} in London to examine the reasons behind the quick {{surrender}} of Fort Rupel and favored a complete demobilization of the Greek army and navy. King Constantine anticipated {{the results of the}} conference and ordered a partial demobilization on 8 June. The tension between the royal government and the Allies continued since 'anti-Allied activities' in Athens were ignored by the Greek Government. On 12–13 June, a mob destroyed Venizelist newspapers: Nea Ellas, Patris, Ethnos, and Estia. The mob proceeded to the British Embassy as police idly stood by without interfering. This incident gave France the political ammunition to persuade Britain that more extreme measures were needed. On 17 June, the London conference decided [...] "that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>absolutely</b> necessary to do something to bring the king of Greece and his Government to their senses".|$|E
500|$|Because of her tour of North Vietnam {{during wartime}} and the {{subsequent}} rumors circulated about her visit, resentment against her among some veterans and currently serving U.S. military still exists. For example, when U.S. Naval Academy cadets, {{who had not yet}} been born when Fonda protested against the Vietnam war, shouted out [...] "Goodnight, Jane Fonda!", the company replied [...] "Goodnight, bitch!" [...] This practice has since been prohibited by the academy's Plebe Summer Standard Operating Procedures. In 2005, Michael A. Smith, a U.S. Navy veteran, was arrested for disorderly conduct in Kansas City, Missouri, after he spat chewing tobacco in Fonda's face during a book-signing event for her autobiography, My Life So Far. He told reporters that he [...] "consider it a debt of honor", adding [...] "she spit in our faces for 37 years. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>absolutely</b> worth it. There are a lot of veterans who would love to do what I did." [...] Fonda refused to press charges.|$|E
500|$|In October 1990, {{a decade}} after his divorce from Angie, Bowie and Somali-born supermodel Iman were {{introduced}} by a mutual friend. Bowie recalled, [...] "I was naming the children the night we met... <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>absolutely</b> immediate." [...] They married in 1992. Tin Machine resumed work the same month, but their audience and critics, ultimately left disappointed by the first album, showed little interest in a second. Tin Machine IIs arrival was marked by a widely publicised and ill-timed conflict over the cover art: after production had begun, the new record label, Victory, deemed the depiction of four ancient nude Kouroi statues, judged by Bowie to be [...] "in exquisite taste", [...] "a show of wrong, obscene images", requiring air-brushing and patching to render the figures sexless. Tin Machine toured again, but after the live album [...] failed commercially, the band drifted apart, and Bowie, though he continued to collaborate with Gabrels, resumed his solo career.|$|E

[...] He added, [...] "They had {{to do more than}} just give up open shots. They had to avoid fouls and pass me the ball in traffic." [...] Knicks' player Richie Guerin felt the Warriors broke a code of honor in sports by embarrassing an opponent and setting a record outside the normal flow of the game. Although effusive in his praise of Chamberlain, Guerin nonetheless estimated that if the game had played out normally, Chamberlain would have finished 15 to 20 points shy of 100. Chamberlain countered he could have scored 140 if the Knicks [...] "had played straight-up basketball." [...] New York coach Eddie Donovan suggested, [...] "The game was a farce. They would foul us and we would foul them." [...] The Knicks' Naulls stated, [...] "The game was not a fluke ... I thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>absolutely</b> authentic."

On working with Williams {{and the new}} looks she developed in the video, Aguilera stated, [...] "...someone with {{that much of a}} catalog under his belt and success as a video maker, he's like a legend. So again entering into the collaborating factor, I didn't know what to expect ... and he's probably thinking the same about me. And when we walked away from working with each other, it was just a love connection. I wanted to maintain and keep consistent with the look of the album packaging and book, and I really wanted to keep all that in line, and so he really paid attention, and I think it's really iconic and classic.
