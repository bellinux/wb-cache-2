5|$|UPLB admits {{more than}} 2,500 {{students}} and produces about 1,800 graduates every year. Undergraduate admission {{is determined by}} the University of the Philippines College Admission Test (UPCAT). Examinees that select UPLB as their preferred campus and garner a University Predicted Grade (UPG) within the standard cut-off are automatically eligible for admission. Those who do not automatically qualify may <b>file</b> <b>an</b> <b>appeal</b> for reconsideration if their UPG is within the actual cut-off, though the appeal process does not guarantee admission. The cut-off scores may be adjusted according to a variety of factors. In 2010, UPLB had a standard UPG cut-off of 2.42 while the actual cut-off was 2.8 (this actual cut-off was retained in 2011). But in 2014-2015 UPCAT, according to the Office of the University Registrar, UPLB had a standard cut off score of 2.3. Seventy percent of slots are given to incoming freshmen with the highest scores, while the remaining thirty percent are given to public high school students and members of minority groups. Before the UPCAT was used for admission, UPCA only admitted the top 5 percent of Philippine high school graduates.|$|E

For instance the cost of <b>filing</b> <b>an</b> <b>appeal</b> with the JCPC is more than five times greater than <b>filing</b> <b>an</b> <b>appeal</b> with the CCJ. For the JCPC, the <b>filing</b> of <b>an</b> application for permission to appeal along with the actual notice of appeal would have cost £220, or roughly US$350 in 2013, while the CCJ requires no payment for <b>filing</b> <b>an</b> application for permission to appeal and the cost for <b>filing</b> <b>a</b> notice of <b>appeal</b> was US$60. In 2015, the new filing fees for the JCPC were noted as ranging from between £400 to a £5,000 or roughly US$600 to US$7,500 while the comparable fees for the CCJ remained at US$60 thus making the cost of <b>filing</b> <b>an</b> <b>appeal</b> with the JCPC at least ten times greater than <b>filing</b> <b>an</b> <b>appeal</b> with the CCJ.|$|R

25|$|On August 17, 2006, Anderson again {{refused to}} testify before the grand jury {{investigating}} Bonds. Judge Alsup ordered Anderson to return to court August 28 for a contempt hearing. In requesting the hearing, prosecutors for the first time publicly acknowledged they were targeting Bonds. Anderson was held in contempt of court at the August 28 hearing and sent to federal prison for a second time. Judge Alsup said Anderson had provided no legal justification for refusing to tell the grand jury on August 17 whether he had supplied steroids to Bonds or other athletes, or even whether he knew Bonds. Geragos said he would <b>file</b> <b>an</b> <b>appeal</b> with the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Anderson was released from prison on October 5, after serving 37 days. Judge Alsup ordered his release because the federal appeals court hadn't affirmed the contempt order within the required 30 days after Anderson was jailed. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeal had sent the contempt order back to Judge Alsup, thus delaying any ruling.|$|E

On 11 May 2009, the Kuala Lumpur High Court ruled that the Sultan was not constitutionally permitted to dismiss the Menteri Besar, and that Nizar had always been the rightful head of the state government. On 22 May 2009, the Court of Appeal overturned the High Court decision, and confirmed that the Barisan Nasional which has sworn in a new chief minister and parliamentary speaker for Perak should remain in power. Furthermore, the Court of Appeal found the trial judge to have erred in confusing the issue of whether the government has lost the confidence {{of the majority of the}} house with the issue of whether the Sultan has the power to dismiss the government.

2500|$|There are two {{provisions}} in Morgan which has divided the circuit courts on the writ’s time limits to <b>file</b> <b>an</b> <b>appeal</b> from a district court’s decision on a coram nobis petition.

The Second, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, and Tenth circuit courts have held that the civil time limit should apply to coram nobis appeals because the writ of coram nobis [...] "of the same general character" [...] as the writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. § 2255. Habeas corpus petitions follow time limit guidelines of the civil rule which provides a 60-day time period to <b>file</b> <b>an</b> <b>appeal.</b> [...] However, the Eighth and Ninth circuit courts relied upon the statement in Morgan that a writ of coram nobis is a [...] "step in a criminal case" [...] and reasoned that it should therefore be governed by the criminal time limit for filing appeals.
