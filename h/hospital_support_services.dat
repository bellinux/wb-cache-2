Data are lacking, however, on the quality of priority screening (triage), emergency care, diagnosis, and inpatient treatment in these hospitals, and on aspects of these potential targets that would benefit most from interventions leading to improved health outcomes. Methods We did a qualitative study in 13 district hospitals and eight teaching hospitals in seven less-developed countries. Experienced paediatricians used a structured survey instrument to assess initial triage, emergency and inpatient care, staff knowledge and practices, and <b>hospital</b> <b>support</b> <b>services.</b> Findings Overall quality of care differed between countries and among hospitals and was generally better in teaching hospitals. 14 of 21 hospitals lacked an adequate system for triage. Initial patient assessment was often inadequate and treatment delayed. Most emergency treatment areas were poorly organised and lacked essential supplies; families were routinely required to buy emergency drugs before they could be given. Adverse factors in case management, including inadequate assessment, inappropriate treatment, and inadequate monitoring occurred in 76 % of inpatient children. Most doctors in district hospitals, and nurses and medical assistants in leaching and district hospitals, had inadequate knowledge and reported practice for managing important childhood illnesses. Interpretation Strengthening care for sick children referred to hospital should focus on achievable objectives with the greatest potential benefit for health outcome. Possible targets for improvement include initial triage, emergency care, assessment, inpatient treatment, and monitoring.

Employees invited to participate in this study were members of <b>Hospital</b> <b>Support</b> <b>Services</b> departments: Food Service, Environmental Services, Patient Transportation, Laundry and Linen, Maintenance, Sterile Processing, Central Supply and Security. Training sessions with varied levels of verbal and nonverbal trainer immediacy behaviors were provided to 125 participants from three hospitals in Kansas and Nebraska. ^ Participants were randomly assigned to either a high immediacy or moderate/low immediacy sessions. High immediacy behaviors included visiting with participants before and after sessions, calling participants by name, smiling, giving eye contact, providing feedback, minimizing physical distance between trainer and participants, encouraging active participation, and sharing personal anecdotes that relate to the content. Moderate/low immediacy behaviors included: no interactions before and after sessions, no personal acknowledgement of students, minimal smiling, no eye contact, minimal feedback, physical distance between trainer and participants, lecture presentation, no sharing of personal anecdotes. The same trainer conducted all sessions. Participants completed a pretest and posttest to measure short-term cognitive learning. Participants completed survey tools to measure motivation, satisfaction and identification of perceived immediacy behaviors. ^ The Mann-Whitney statistic was used to measure significance. No significant difference in short-term cognitive learning and levels of trainer immediacy was found. No significant difference in stated motivation to change behavior and levels of trainer immediacy was found. No significant difference in stated satisfaction and levels of trainer immediacy was found. There was a statistically significant negative correlation between trainer smiling and stated motivation and trainer smiling and perceived immediacy. There was a statistically significant correlation between trainer-demonstrated tension and perceived immediacy. ^ Recommendations for future study include identifying employee motivators and investigating impact of immediacy on learning using a verbal technique to measure learning. ...|$|E
40|$|Background: Inconsistent {{availability}} of subspecialty hand and microvascular emergency call services could influence patient outcomes and {{the efficiency of}} a system dependent on limited resources and timely intervention because de-clining reimbursements, increased medicolegal risk, {{lack of confidence in}} microsurgical skills, and the disruption of elective schedules present a deterrent to call panel participation. This study assessed the {{availability of}} hand and microvascular replantation surgery call services at all level-I and level-II trauma centers in the United States. Methods: Between May and December 2010, all level-I (N = 137) and level-II (N = 153) trauma centers across the U. S. were contacted by telephone. Phone contact was unannounced; responders were invited to participate in our institutional review board-approved anonymous survey regarding hand and microvascular replantation emergency coverage specific to their hospital. Results: Level-I trauma centers: 117 (85 %) of 137 participated, and sixty-four (55 %) of these had immediate access for hand surgery and microvascular replantation services.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} Health Care Managers 2 ̆ 7 considerations {{with and}} experiences of outsourcing services in Western Australian <b>hospitals.</b> <b>Support</b> <b>services</b> such as cleaning and maintenance {{are some of the}} areas which have been targeted for outsourcing (contracting out) by the state government. These services have traditionally been delivered by permanently employed staff either on a full or part- time basis, usually with active union involvement. Core services such as nursing and medical care which involve direct patient care delivery are not included in the outsourcing debate. Firstly, this thesis reviews the literature on outsourcing and its application to the health care industry. Performance indicators and benchmarking are also explored within the context of contracted out services in a variety of settings. The implicit economic, social and legal implications are discussed. This study involved Health Care Managers in Western Australian hospitals and was conducted between June 1995 and May 1996. Their experiences with outsourcing of services together with the hospitals and the communities they served were key considerations in the final analysis. The research findings support the views of more recent studies which emphasize the importance of the context within which outsourcing is implemented, such as rural versus metropolitan hospitals. Hospital size, location, accessibility to contractors, human resource issues and funding arrangements such as those which affect teaching and non- teaching facilities were identified as major determinants affecting the degree to which outsourcing had been embraced. Finally, the implications of this research for future studies are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to determine the information to be collected for aseptic dispensing in NHS hospitals, and its use for management and business purposes in relation to capacity, demand, performance and efficiency. Mixed methodologies were adopted on an exploratory basis. Qualitative methods included: regular expert input; workshops; out-turn questionnaires; Affinity Analysis; surveys; and structured interviews. Quantitative methods included: activity data surveys; targeted surveys; and Delphi methods. The research systematised the collection and collation of the required data and determined novel ways of analysing and manipulating it to aid decision-making. These were used to evaluate the impact of major capital investment and variations in practices between different parts of the country. A benchmarking approach should be applied in utilising the data and statistical indicators. Nomenclature issues can influence data quality. Therefore clear, unambiguous guidance was developed for data collection. Existing pharmaceutical information systems will be the main sources of the data for the foreseeable future. The research focused on the North West of England, with successful application in the West Midlands. Its transferability to non-NHS and foreign hospitals is inferred, as long as similar operational arrangements apply. The research enables: the measurement of progress towards implementing the Breckenridge (1996) recommendations; the evaluation of performance for aseptic production and usage to inform capacity planning; and the presentation of the degree of collaboration between hospitals.

40|$|ABSTRACT Selection, care, and {{management}} of vascu-lar access devices (VADs) are important components of the nutrition support curriculum. The objectives, content material, learning activities, and evaluation methods used by one <b>hospital's</b> nutrition <b>support</b> <b>service</b> to train dietetic interns, medical students, nurses, and surgical and med-ical interns and residents are described. An algorithm for selection ofVADs and suggested readings for this topic are also presented. Teaching about vascular access devices (VADs) {{is an important component}} of the nutrition support curriculum for all health care practitioners. The extent of the training and depth of education deperld largely on the expected competency or performance outcome. Physicians and nurses who will ultimately insert or place VADs or assist in the care of VADs must have hands-on experience and mentored supervision. Dietitians and other health care stu-dents will more likely observe VAD procedures and techniques as part of their comprehensive nutrition support education. The nutrition <b>support</b> <b>service</b> at Rhode Island Hospital actively teaches and trains surgical and medical interns and residents, medical students, dietetic interns, and nurses about VADs.

This program was implemented in many departments of gynecology and obstetrics and resulted in reduced malnutrition, infection, morbidity and mortality in children. This program has introduced 10 specific steps to support successful breastfeeding. For instance, in the fourth step, skin-to-skin contact and breastfeeding are promoted since the time of birth, and in the fifth step, mothers are instructed on how to breastfeed or persist in breastfeeding. In these ten steps, mothers are trained in various fields. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, a standardized questionnaire was used to collect data at baby-friendly hospitals. To assess the difference between multiple nominal variables, variance analysis was performed, using SPSS version 17. Results: Based on the analysis, mothers' awareness of the benefits of breast milk and breastfeeding was 83 % in a baby-friendly hospital. Also, their awareness of proper breastfeeding was estimated at 78. 5 %. In addition, mothers' knowledge about the frequency of breastfeeding was 70 %.

40|$|This {{working paper}} aims {{to justify the}} need to {{research}} into the operations, supervision and monitoring mechanisms of facilities management outsourcing. From the findings, the research proposes to develop a contractual framework for managing the facilities outsourcing contract. The objective is to help ensure that the services provided meet the requirement of the users and customers. The framework will be developed based on the best practice in international environment. Outsourcing is an organizational agenda. Its performance will strategically affect {{the business of the}} organization. Outsourcing involves a number of parties namely the client, service provider, users and customers of the client organization. This nature of transaction requires for suitable operational, supervisory and monitoring mechanisms to succeed. It has to fulfill the benefits expected by the client. This nature of transaction also has certain risks and has the potential to fail the outsourcing venture. The management of outsourcing of facilities management comes with pressures from the above transacting parties including the technologies and business of the client organization. Researches in the practice of outsourcing have also focused on the factors to ensure successful facilities management outsourcing. However, there is still the need to investigate further the issue to help the client and service provider to achieve the benefits of outsourcing especially in the health industry. None of the researches were conducted from the combined perspectives of the client, service provider, users and users. In fact there were also no researches conducted with the client, service provider and users as respondents. Only one research took the view of both the client and service provider. The rest of the researches focused on the view of the client or users separately. In Malaysia, the researches conducted were in logistics and facilities management (i. e. building cleaning). Therefore, there is so much opportunity for researches into outsourcing practice including in facilities management. At the same time there are many big outsourcing projects implemented in the public as well as private sectors. The government <b>hospitals</b> <b>support</b> <b>services</b> privatization project is an outsourcing project that is into its second-half of the 15 years concession period; the concession may be negotiable for further extension. There is the need to re-assess and re-evaluate the performance of the whole outsourcing contract to ensure it really meets the requirements and benefits expected by the users. The operations, supervision and monitoring mechanisms need to be re-looked to identify the weaknesses and to come-up with the solutions so that the users (doctors, medical assistants, nurses, attendants and other health workers) are satisfied with services that meet their requirement which is necessary for them to provide quality health care to the patients...|$|R

METHODS: a survey of all adult, acute, public hospitals with an accident and emergency (A&E) department (n = 36), using a semi-structured telephone interview. KEY FINDINGS: there was a 97 % (n = 35) response rate. The majority (n = 25, 71. 4 %) of hospitals reported delivery of a clinical pharmacy service. On admission, pharmacists were involved in taking or verifying medication histories in a minority (n = 15, 42. 9 %) of hospitals, while few (n = 6, 17. 1 %) deployed staff to the A&E/acute medical admissions unit. On discharge, the majority (n = 30, 85. 7 %) did not supply any take-out medication, a minority (n = 5, 14. 3 %) checked the discharge prescription, 51. 4 % (n = 18) counselled patients, 42. 9 % (n = 15) provided medication compliance charts and one hospital (2. 9 %) communicated with the patient's community pharmacy. The number of staff employed in the pharmacy department in each hospital was not proportionate {{to the number of}} inpatient beds, nor the volume of admissions from A&E. There were differences identified in service delivery between hospitals of different type: urban hospitals with a high volume of admissions from A&E were more likely to deliver clinical pharmacy.

40|$|Graduation date: 1995 A {{growing number}} of nonmetropolitan {{communities}} have chosen to pursue nontraditional avenues for economic development including {{the promotion of the}} nonmetropolitan area to older adults who may choose to migrate after retirement. The {{purpose of this study was}} to help community leaders in nonmetropolitan areas make informed decisions if they choose to revitalize their town through the aid of immigration and retention of retirees, by knowing what infrastructure to plan for based on the neighborhood, housing, and <b>support</b> <b>service</b> preferences of future nonmetropolitan retirees. This prospective study compared two populations: preretirees who planned to migrate to nonmetropolitan areas during the first 10 years of retirement and preretirees who planned to age in place in nonmetropolitan areas upon retirement by (1) age integrated/ age segregated neighborhood preference; (2) housing tenure and structure preference; (3) <b>support</b> <b>service</b> preference of a hospital and/or family members; and (4) the socio-demographic variables of marital status, health status, current income level, and number of sources of retirement income. An age stratified random sample of preretirees from two states (N= 1, 175), Oregon and Utah, was included in the study. Statistical analyses included descriptive statistics and chi-square and one t-test to test nine null hypotheses. Migrant respondents differed in their preference for neighborhoods with older residents (p=. 00000), preference to rent (p=. 00002), and tendency to feel that family in the community was important (p=. 00031). Migrants differed significantly in their marital status (p=. 01292), in that more were unmarried. With regard to health status (p=. 02752), more age in place reported excellent and fair/poor health as opposed to migrants' very good and good health. Nonmetropolitan community leaders interested in economic revitalization through the attraction of and retention of elderly retirees may want to consider including in their community the following: housing that tends to be more age segregated than age integrated, single family dwellings that can be rented, a <b>hospital,</b> and formal <b>support</b> <b>services</b> that may be needed if the informal support of family and friends is not available...|$|R
40|$|Pharmaceutical {{service is}} one of the {{activities}} in <b>hospital</b> that <b>support</b> health <b>service</b> quality. One of the factors that can improve quality of pharmaceutical services is prescription services. In the era of National Health Insurance, prescription given to the patients should be based on the National Formulary. If prescriptions did not suit the national formulary, it would influence the services quality on pharmacy unit. The purposes of this study were to determine suitability of prescription outpatients’ national health insurance with national formulary and to determine the relationship of the suitability of prescription with a national formulary to service quality in pharmacy unit in one of general hospitals in Bandung. A cross sectional with servqual questionnaire was used to the patients and the 262 prescription samples needed were taken in January 2017. Mann Whitney test is used for bivariate analysis. The result indicated 91. 7 % prescriptions was suited the national formulary and the rest was not. There was a significant difference between prescription suitability with the national formulary to service quality in pharmacy unit in the hospital with p-value 0. 00 (p< 0, 05). It can be concluded that higher percentage of prescriptions suitability with the national formulary in hospital related with the better service quality of pharmacy unit...|$|R
