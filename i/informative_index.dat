Where sister taxa first appear as fossils at different times, a ghost range is inferred {{to bridge the gap}} between these dates. Some measure of the total extent of ghost ranges across the tree underlies several indices of cladistic/stratigraphic congruence. We investigate this congruence for 19 independent, published cladograms of major dinosaur groups and report exceptional agreement between the phylogenetic and stratigraphic patterns, evidenced by sums of ghost ranges near the theoretical minima. This implies that both phylogenetic and stratigraphic data reflect faithfully the evolutionary history of dinosaurs, at least for the taxa included in this study. We formally propose modifications to an existing index of congruence (the gap excess ratio; GER), designed to remove a bias in the range of values possible with trees of different shapes. We also propose a more <b>informative</b> <b>index</b> of congruence—GER*—that takes account of the underlying distribution of sums of ghost ranges possible when permuting stratigraphic range data across the tree. Finally, we incorporate data on the range of possible first occurrence dates into our estimates of congruence, extending a procedure originally implemented with the modified Manhattan stratigraphic measure and GER to our new indices.

Relative transcription levels in the subcutaneous adipose tissue (real time RT–PCR) and serum protein concentrations (RIA) were measured in 48 obese subjects with known genotypes at three polymorphic sites and in five non-obese controls. None of the studied polymorphisms altered significantly the expression. Significantly elevated relative transcription levels of the LEP gene (P <  0. 05) and serum leptin concentrations (P <  0. 01) were recorded in obese patients, {{when compared with the}} non-obese controls, but such differences were not found for the ADIPOQ gene. Interestingly, the leptin to adiponectin protein concentration ratio (L/A) was approximately sevenfold higher in obese children and adolescents when compared with the non-obese controls (P <  0. 001). Taking into consideration the observed relationship between the genotypes and the gene expression level we suggest that these SNPs are not conclusive markers for predisposition to obesity in Polish children and adolescents.

This intimate embryological {{relationship between the}} face and brain means that facial dysmorphogenesis can serve as an accessible and <b>informative</b> <b>index</b> of brain dysmorphogenesis in neurological and psychiatric disorders of early developmental origin. There are three principal challenges in seeking to increase understanding of disorders of early brain dysmorphogenesis through craniofacial dysmorphogenesis: (i) the first, technical, challenge has been to digitize the facial surface in its inherent three-dimensionality; (ii) the second, analytical, challenge has been to develop methodologies for extracting biologically meaningful shape covariance from digitized samples, making statistical comparisons between groups and visualizing in 3 D the resultant statistical models on a ‘whole face’ basis; (iii) the third, biological, challenge is to demonstrate a relationship between facial morphogenesis and brain morphogenesis not only in anatomical–embryological terms but also {{at the level of}} brain function. Here we consider each of these challenges in turn and then illustrate the issues by way of our own findings.

30|$|Frankly speaking, it is {{not easy}} to {{discover}} the valuable knowledge from our real life. For this issue, the past studies made on knowledge discovery can be categorized two classifications, namely, algorithm-driven and application-driven studies. Algorithm-driven studies focused on how to increase the efficiency, while the application-driven ones focused on how to successfully apply the mining algorithms to applications. In this paper, on one hand, we propose an efficient mining algorithm to discover the repeating patterns. On the other hand, an application for music recommendation is lifted to justify the motivation of pattern mining. In terms of mining algorithm, first, we construct an <b>informative</b> <b>index</b> called QPI containing positions and occurrences of patterns. It can effectively reduce the cost of mining of repeating patterns. By QPI, a prefix-search-based algorithm named FMRP performs efficiently on mining the repeating patterns. In terms of application, a music recommender system based on the repeating patterns is proposed to cope with problems in traditional recommender systems. The main intent is to link the user preferences and the repeating patterns on music. The experimental results reveal that our proposed mining algorithm is more efficient than the compared methods on different data. Moreover, the proposed recommender system based on the repeating patterns performs more effective in facing very sparse data. This is just the beginning of applying the repeating patterns. In the future, the repeating patterns will further be used as representative features in recognizing objects in other real applications.|$|E

Discourse in typical and clinical populations has been investigated {{with a variety of}} structuralist, functionalist, and hybrid techniques (see Armstrong, 2000), and is known to be a good predictor of quality of life and life participation in persons with aphasia (PWAs). Discourse analysis, however, generally requires specialized training and can be time-consuming. MacWhinney, Fromm Holland, Forbes, & Wright (2010) suggested that analysis of a core lexicon during structured narrative tasks could provide a time-efficient and <b>informative</b> <b>index</b> of functional communication abilities. For example, clinicians could bypass lengthy transcriptions, instead generating a list of words spoken during narration for later comparison to a core lexicon (CoreLex). Using various methods, CoreLex has so far been investigated for the Cinderella story, a monologic story retell narrative task (Author 1, Dillow, & Author 2, 2013; MacWhinney et al., 2010) and a procedural narrative task where patients describe how to make a PB&J sandwich (Fromm, Forbes, Holland, & MacWhinney, 2013). CoreLex performance is strongly correlated with main concept (MC) production, a measure of narrative adequacy, during Cinderella retelling (Author 1, Dillow, & Author 2, 2013). Similar investigations for other narrative tasks are needed.

40|$|Abstract — Recent {{improvements}} in the accessibility of highthroughput genotyping have brought a deal of attention to genome-wide association studies for common complex diseases. Although, such diseases {{can be caused by}} multi-loci interactions, locus-by-locus studies are prevailing. Recently, two-loci analysis has been shown promising (Marchini et al, 2005), and multiloci analysis is expected to find even deeper disease-associated interactions. Unfortunately, an exhaustive search among all possible corresponding multi-markers can be unfeasible even for small number of SNPs let alone the complete genome. In this paper we first propose to extract <b>informative</b> (<b>indexing)</b> SNPs {{that can be used for}} reconstructing of all SNPs almost without loss (He and Zelikovsky, 2006). In the reduced set of SNPs, we then propose to apply a novel combinatorial method for finding disease-associated multi-SNP combinations (MSCs). Our experimental study shows that the proposed methods are able to find MSCs whose disease association is statistically significant even after multiple testing adjustment. For (Daly et al, 2001) data we found a few unphased MSCs associated with Crohn’s disease with multiple testing adjusted p-value below 0. 05 while no single SNP or pair of SNPs show any significant association.

40|$|Abstract In this article, we {{categorize}} presently available {{experimental and}} theoretical knowledge of various physi-cochemical and biochemical features of amino acids, as {{collected in the}} AAindex database of known 544 amino acid (AA) indices. Previously reported 402 indices were categorized into six groups using hierarchical clustering technique and 142 were left unclustered. However, due to the increasing diversity of the database these indices are overlapping, therefore crisp clustering method may not provide optimal results. Moreover, in various large-scale bioinformatics analyses of whole proteomes, the proper selection of amino acid indices representing their biologi-cal significance is crucial for efficient and error-prone encoding of the short functional sequence motifs. In most cases, researchers perform exhaustive manual selection of the most <b>informative</b> <b>indices.</b> These two facts motivated us to analyse the widely used AA indices.

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} {{promoting}} energy supply by Renewable Energy Sources (RES) in buildings, namely residential, requires additional <b>informative</b> <b>indexes</b> {{to be included}} in buildings Energy Performance Certificates. The load-generation approach for the energy balance is here discussed, and compared with the current recommended by CEN/TR 15615, i. e. the delivered-exported approach. Besides the Energy Performance Index, which takes the same value for both approaches, other indexes are studied. From the analysis considering two variants for a single-family house with six solutions for energy systems, it is suggested to include: i) L/R (building load vs benchmark load) and ii) G/L (RES supply vs building load). On the one hand, L/R distinguishes the solutions where the building envelope is optimized from those where the driver to reduce EPI is the RES supply installation. On the other hand, G/L quantifies the RES share in the building demand and goes in line with what is recommended for the principles defining nearly Zero Energy Buildings. The breakdown of G/L into on-site and off-site RES will be also very helpful in differentiating local RES supply from imported renewables fuels, such as biomass. Moreover, considering smart cities, not only energy flows are important but also information flows (e. g. energy forecast, energy management), thus, new energy performance indexes are required for energy-efficient interactive buildings...|$|R

In a comparative experiment with iron oxide Fe 3 O 4 (magnetite) particles having a mean diameter of 10 nm, 50 nm or 1 μm, it was demonstrated that, given equal mass doses, nanoparticles (NPs) induce much more intensive recruitment of phagocytes with a much more significant shift toward neutrophil leukocytes (NL) count in the BALF cell population than micrometric particles do, this shift being an indirect but <b>informative</b> <b>index</b> of particle cytotoxicity for alveolar macrophages (AM). Judging by NL/AM ratio, this cytotoxicity diminishes in the sequence: 10 nm > 50 nm> 1 μm, while judging by OM counts of visible aggregated particles within AMs and NLs and by sc-AFM count of micro-invaginations on the surfaces of these cells, their avidity for particles decreases in the same succession. The same dependence of cell recruitment and of phagocytic activity on NP cytotoxicity was found when the NP diameters were quite similar (ca. 3. 5 - 4. 0 nm) but the cytotoxicity of one metal (in our experiment, nanosilver) was {{higher than that of}} another (nanogold). TEM pictures of AMs from rats administered the 10 nm magnetite testify to the ability of AMs to actively engulf single NPs and their small aggregates which then form larger conglomerates within fused phagosomes.

40|$|The {{complexity}} and heterogeneity of neuroimaging findings in individuals with autism spectrum disorder {{has suggested that}} many of the underlying alterations are subtle and involve many brain regions and networks. The ability to account for multivariate brain features and identify neuroimaging measures {{that can be used to}} characterize individual variation have thus become increasingly important for interpreting and understanding the neurobiological mechanisms of autism. In the present study, we utilize the Mahalanobis distance, a multidimensional counterpart of the Euclidean distance, as an <b>informative</b> <b>index</b> to characterize individual brain variation and deviation in autism. Longitudinal diffusion tensor imaging data from 149 participants (92 diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder and 57 typically developing controls) between 3. 1 and 36. 83  years of age were acquired over a roughly 10 -year period and used to construct the Mahalanobis distance from regional measures of white matter microstructure. Mahalanobis distances were significantly greater and more variable in the autistic individuals as compared to control participants, demonstrating increased atypicalities and variation in the group of individuals diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder. Distributions of multivariate measures were also found to provide greater discrimination and more sensitive delineation between autistic and typically developing individuals than conventional univariate measures, while also being significantly associated with observed traits of the autism group. These results help substantiate autism as a truly heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder, while also suggesting that collectively considering neuroimaging measures from multiple brain regions provides improved insight into the diversity of brain measures in autism that is not observed when considering the same regions separately. Distinguishing multidimensional brain relationships may thus be informative for identifying neuroimaging-based phenotypes, as well as help elucidate underlying neural mechanisms of brain variation in autism spectrum disorders...|$|E

The soil as a basic component of many ecosystems, including the structure of its microbial cenoses, remains an <b>informative</b> <b>index</b> of a system’s overall stability. The areas affected by railway transport have been scarcely studied. Due to the above, {{the aim of this}} work has been to establish the transformation regularities of soil microbial cenoses of territories close to railways and to establish the groups of microorganisms that are a sensitive criterion of technogenic vehicular influence. For the purpose of microbiological research, soil samples were taken at different distances from the railway track (0, 25, 50, 100 and 250 m) within five monitoring sections of the Tchop – Uzhhorod – Sambor railway (in the territory of Zakarpatska oblast). The number of ecological trophic groups was identified by means of inoculation on nutrient media using the method of serial dilution of soil suspensions. The research showed that in all types of soils that were adjacent to railway tracks, the number of ammonifiers and spore microbiota was high due to the high content of heavy metals (beyond the background levels). Besides, the bacterial microflora on beef-extract agar was characterized by homogeneity with domination of enteric bacteria and spore bacteria. Simultaneously, the numbers of nitrogen-fixing microorganisms, micromycetes, oligonitrophils, amylolytic and pedotrophic microflorae were shown to be low compared to the control. Farther from the railway track, pigmental species of bacteria appeared in the soil samples, attesting to the activity of self-purification processes. Correlation analysis of the data showed that the soil microbiota of the railway-side areas was undergoing changes as affected by heightened contents of heavy metals. Existence of medium and close connections was established between the number of microorganisms of ecological trophic groups and the content of acid-soluble lead forms at the levels of 0. 72 – 1. 72 maximum permissible concentrations. It was the nitrogen-fixing microorganisms and microscopic fungi that showed a fast response to heavy metals, which was an indication of their possible use as indicators of the ecological state of technogenically transformed soils...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop {{generalized}} and individual models of the jump actions of skilled female volleyball players. The main prerequisite for the development of the jump actions models were the results of our earlier studies of factor structure of jump actions of 10 sportswomen of the Polish volleyball team "Gedania" (Premier League) in the preparatory and competitive periods of the annual cycle of preparation. The athletes age was 22. 0 +- 2. 9 years, the sports experience - 8. 1 +- 3. 1 years, body height - 181. 9 +- 8. 4 years and body weight - 72. 8 +- 10. 8 kg. Mathematical and statistical processing of the data (the definition of M ± SD and significant differences between the samples) was performed using a standard computer program "STATISTICA 7, 0 ". Based on the analysis of the factor structure of 20 jump actions of skilled women volleyball players determined to within 5 of the most <b>informative</b> <b>indexes</b> and their tentative values recommended for the formation of a generalized model of this structure. Comparison of individual models of jump actions of skilled women volleyball players with their generalized models in different periods of preparation can be used for the rational choice of means and methods for the increasing of the training process efficiency...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—We {{present a}} new method for the {{visualization}} of spectral images, {{based on a}} selection of three relevant spectral channels to build a Red-Green-Blue composite. Band selection is achieved by means of information measures at the first, second and third orders. Irrelevant channels are preliminarily removed {{by means of a}} center-surround entropy comparison. A visualization-oriented spectrum segmentation based on the use of color matching functions allows for computational ease and adjustment of the natural rendering. Results from the proposed method are presented and objectively compared to four other dimensionality reduction techniques in terms of naturalness and <b>informative</b> content. <b>Index</b> Terms—Multi/hyperspectral imagery, Visualization...|$|R
40|$|Our {{aim was to}} {{determine}} several indexes of reproducibility for strength measurements with a hand-held pull-gauge dynamometer (MFB 50 K) in cancer patients. Two independent testers performed repeated measurements of maximal isometric elbow and knee strength. The measurements were gathered in {{a convenience sample of}} 40 patients (27 men, age 20 - 72 years) with various types and stages of cancer. These patients were recruited from the medical oncology clinic of a university hospital. The Pearson product moment correlation coefficient, the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), the standard error of measurement (SEM) and its associated 95 % confidence interval, the smallest detectable difference (SDD) and the limits of agreement were determined as outcome measures for reproducibility. The results for the Pearson product moment correlation and the ICC were 0. 90 for elbow and 0. 96 for knee extension strength. The results in terms of the SDDs were 29. 4 newton (N) for elbow and 54. 8 N for knee strength. The limits of agreement for elbow strength were - 21. 7 N and 38. 5 N (mean 8. 4 N). For knee strength the limits of agreement were - 49. 8 N and 59. 8 N (mean 5 N). The Pearson product moment correlation and the ICC suggested good reproducibility. However, the more <b>informative</b> <b>indices</b> of reproducibility, i. e. the SEM and the SDD, showed relatively large measurement error between the testers. Therefore, the current use of the MFB 50 K for the measurement of muscle strength is not supported in cancer patients. status: publishe...|$|R
