40|$|<b>Hereditary</b> <b>dystrophies</b> {{affecting}} the central retina represent a heterogeneous group of diseases. Mutations in different genes {{may be responsible}} for changes of the choroid (choroideremia), of the retinal pigment epithelium [RPE] (Best′s disease), of the photoreceptor outer segments (Stargardt′s disease) and of the bipolar and Mueller cells (x-linked retinoschisis). The correct diagnosis of <b>hereditary</b> retinal <b>dystrophies</b> is important, even though therapeutic options are limited at the moment, as every patient should get a diagnosis and be informed about the expected prognosis. Furthermore, specific gene therapy of a number of diseases such as Leber congenital amaurosis, choroideremia, Stargardt′s disease, Usher Syndrome and achromatopsia is being evaluated at present. Classic examinations for patients suffering from <b>hereditary</b> retinal <b>dystrophies</b> of the central retina are funduscopy - also using red-free light - visual-field tests, electrophysiologic tests as electro-retinogram [ERG] and multifocal ERG and tests evaluating color vision. Recently, new imaging modalities have been introduced into the clinical practice. The significance of these new methods such as high-resolution spectral-domain optic coherence tomography [SD-OCT] and fundus autofluorescence will be discussed as well as "next generation sequencing" as a new method for the analysis of genetic mutations in a larger number of patients...|$|R
40|$|A WDE {{variety of}} {{nutritional}} deficiencies producing gradual {{loss of transparency}} in the human lens {{as well as in}} the lenses of laboratory animals, has been reported (Oomen, 1954; Pirie and van Heyningen, 1956). The development of lenticular opacities and finally the liquefaction of lens fibres are the visible changes among these affected animals (Passmore, 1947). Pathologically, muscular dystrophy in rabbits, induced by vitamin E deficiency, closely resembles hereditary muscular dystrophy (Mason, 1960). Previously, changes in the nucleic acid and protein metabolism of the lens in hereditary muscular dystrophy had been shown (Srivastava, Devi, and Sarkar, 1963). In the present study cataracts have been induced in rabbits maintained on a vitamin E-deficient diet and the metabolism of nucleic acid and of proteins in the lenses of these animals has been investigated. It is hoped that the results of this investigation may indicate that cataract developed by nutritional deficiency resembles the cataract formed by <b>hereditary</b> <b>dystrophy,</b> although the primary cause of these two diseases is not the same.

40|$|In {{the light}} of current genetic knowledge, in-vestigation of the primary {{abnormality}} of a heredi-tary disease is logically directed toward a geneti-cally abnormal protein. Biochemical studies of hereditary human and animal progressive mus-cular dystrophy have revealed a variety of ab-normalities such as elevated serum enzymes and lowered muscle enzyme activity, increased crea-tine excretion, and lowered muscle potassium con-tent, which have been recently reviewed (1, 2). These changes are, however, {{generally considered to be}} secondary to muscle destruction (2 - 4). A muscle protein abnormality has been suggested in recent studies by Kruh, Dreyfus, Schapira, and Gey (5), and by Simon, Gross, and Lessell (6), showing an increased rate of muscle protein ca-tabolism in <b>hereditary</b> <b>dystrophy</b> of mice. De-struction of the myofibrils, composed primarily of myosin and actin, {{has been shown to be}} an early event in dystrophy in the electron micro-scopic studies of Ross, Pappas, and Harman (7), and O'Steen (8, 9) has demonstrated in tissue culture that myofibrils from dystrophic mice re-generate abnormally. In earlier investigations on isolated myosin, Schapira, Joly, and Dreyfus (10) showed by light scattering that the protein from dystrophic human muscle had more variable par-ticle size, and Horvath (11) in an abstract re-ported greater polydispersity on the basis of the ultracentrifuge pattern of myosin from human dystrophic muscle. * Submitted for publication September 21, 1964; ac...|$|E
40|$|Fuchs corneal {{dystrophy}} (FCD) is a <b>hereditary</b> <b>dystrophy</b> of the corneal endothelium and {{is responsible for}} majority of the corneal transplantation performed in the United States. Here, we describe three generations of a family with 12 individuals affected by late-onset FCD and in which three individuals are unaffected. Genome-wide mapping provided suggestive linkage at two loci on chromosomal arms 3 p and 15 q. Alleles at either locus alone were not sufficient to explain FCD; however, considered together, both loci could explain the disorder in this pedigree. Subsequent next-generation sequencing identified a nonsense mutation in AGBL 1 in the 15 q locus; this mutation {{would result in a}} premature termination of AGBL 1. Consistent with a causal role for this transcript, further sequencing of our cohort of late-onset-FCD-affected individuals identified two cases harboring the same nonsense mutation and a further three unrelated individuals bearing a second missense allele. AGBL 1 encodes a glutamate decarboxylase previously identified in serial analysis of gene expression of corneal endothelium, a finding confirmed by immunohistochemical staining. Wild-type AGBL 1 localizes predominantly to the cytoplasm; in sharp contrast, the truncated protein showed distinct nuclear localization. Finally, we show that AGBL 1 interacts biochemically with the FCD-associated protein TCF 4 and that the mutations found in our cohort of FCD individuals diminish this interaction. Taken together, our data identify a locus for FCD, extend the complex genetic architecture of the disorder, provide direct evidence for the involvement of TCF 4 in FCD pathogenesis, and begin to explain how causal FCD mutations affect discrete biochemical complexes...|$|E

40|$|NaBC 1 (the SLC 4 A 11 gene) {{belongs to}} the SLC 4 family of sodium-coupled {{bicarbonate}} (carbonate) transporter proteins and functions as an electrogenic sodium borate cotransporter. Mutations in SLC 4 A 11 cause either corneal abnormalities (corneal <b>hereditary</b> <b>dystrophy</b> type 2) or a combined auditory and visual impairment (Harboyan syndrome). The role of NaBC 1 in sensory systems is poorly understood, given the difficulty of studying patients with NaBC 1 mutations. We report our findings in Slc 4 a 11 −/− mice generated to investigate the role of NaBC 1 in sensorineural systems. In wild-type mice, specific NaBC 1 immunoreactivity was detected in fibrocytes of the spiral ligament, from the basal to the apical portion of the cochlea. NaBC 1 immunoreactivity was present in the vestibular labyrinth, in stromal cells underneath the non-immunoreactive sensory epithelia of the macula utricle, sacule, and crista ampullaris, and the membranous vestibular labyrinth was collapsed. Both auditory brain response and vestibular evoked potential waveforms were significantly abnormal in Slc 4 a 11 −/− mice. In the cornea, NaBC 1 was highly expressed in the endothelial cell layer with less staining in epithelial cells. However, unlike humans, the corneal phenotype was mild with a normal slit lamp evaluation. Corneal endothelial cells were morphologically normal; however, both the absolute height of the corneal basal epithelial cells and the relative basal epithelial cell/total corneal thickness were significantly increased in Slc 4 a 11 −/− mice. Our results demonstrate {{for the first time}} the importance of NaBC 1 in the audio-vestibular system and provide support for the hypothesis that SLC 4 A 11 should be considered a potential candidate gene in patients with isolated sensorineural vestibular hearing abnormalities...|$|E

40|$|Peripherin (peripherin/rds) is a membrane-associated {{protein that}} plays a {{critical}} role in the morphogenesis of rod and cone photoreceptor outer segments. Mutations in the corresponding PRPH 2 gene cause different types of retinal dystrophies characterized by a loss of photoreceptors. Over activation of poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) was previously shown to be involved in different animal models for <b>hereditary</b> retinal <b>dystrophies.</b> This includes the rd 2 mouse, which suffers from a human homologous mutation in the PRPH 2 gene. In the present study, we show that increased retinal PARP activity and poly-ADP-ribosylation of proteins occurs before the peak of rd 2 photoreceptor degeneration. Inhibition of PARP activity with the well-characterized PARP inhibitor PJ 34 decreased the levels of poly-ADP-ribosylation and photoreceptor cell death. These results suggest a causal involvement of PARP in photoreceptor degeneration caused by peripherin mutations and highlight the possibility to use PARP inhibition for the mutation-independent treatment of <b>hereditary</b> retinal <b>dystrophies...</b>|$|R
