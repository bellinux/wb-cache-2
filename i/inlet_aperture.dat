50|$|Matrix-assisted inlet {{ionization}} (MAII) {{has shown}} that the laser is not necessary for the ionization process. Ions are formed when matrix-analyte is introduced to the vacuum of a mass spectrometer through an <b>inlet</b> <b>aperture.</b> LSI is a subset of MAII and is now called laserspray inlet ionization (LSII). Laser spray inlet ionization and matrix-assisted inlet ionization can be coupled to a fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) mass analyzer to improve detection of peptides and proteins.|$|E
50|$|Matrix-Assisted Ionization MAI {{is similar}} to MALDI in sample preparation, but a laser is not {{required}} to convert analyte molecules included in a matrix compound into gas-phase ions. In MAI, analyte ions have charge states similar to electrospray ionization but obtained from a solid matrix rather than a solvent. No voltage or laser is required, but a laser can be used to obtain spatial resolution for imaging. Matrix-analyte samples are ionized in the vacuum of a mass spectrometer and can be inserted into the vacuum through an atmospheric pressure inlet. Less volatile matrices such as 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid require a hot inlet tube to produce analyte ions by MAI, but more volatile matrices such as 3-nitrobenzonitrile require no heat, voltage, or laser. Simply introducing the matrix:analyte sample to the <b>inlet</b> <b>aperture</b> of an atmospheric pressure ionization mass spectrometer produces abundant ions. Compounds at least as large as bovine serum albumin kDa can be ionized with this method. In this simple, low cost and easy to use ionization method, the inlet to the mass spectrometer can be considered the ion source.|$|E

A {{two-dimensional}} turbulence k-ε {{model is}} used to predict the distribution of air velocity, temperature and turbulence kinetic energy in a ventilated room using different positions of <b>inlet</b> and outlet <b>apertures.</b> The Navier Stockes, energy and turbulence equations are solved using finite volume techniques with staggered grid.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This {{represents}} {{the first report}} of laserspray ionization vacuum (LSIV) with operation directly from atmospheric pressure for use in mass spectrometry. Two different types of electrospray ionization source inlets were converted to LSIV sources by equipping {{the entrance of the}} atmospheric pressure <b>inlet</b> <b>aperture</b> with a customized cone that is sealed with a removable glass plate holding the matrix/analyte sample. A laser aligned in transmission geometry (at 180 ° relative to the inlet) ablates the matrix/analyte sample deposited on the vacuum side of the glass slide. Laser ablation from vacuum requires lower inlet temperature relative to laser ablation at atmospheric pressure. However, higher inlet temperature is required for high-mass analytes, for example, α-chymotrypsinogen (25. 6 kDa). Labile compounds such as gangliosides and cardiolipins are detected in the negative ion mode directly from mouse brain tissue as intact doubly deprotonated ions. Multiple charging enhances the ion mobility spectrometry separation of ions derived from complex tissue samples. In laserspray ionization (LSI), matrix/analyte sample isablated into the vacuum of a mass spectrometer producing ions with charge states similar to electrospray ionization (ESI). LSI is distinguished as LSII when the sample is ablated a...|$|E

40|$|The tilt-casting {{method is}} used to achieve {{tranquil}} filling of gamma-TiAl turbine blades. The reactive alloy is melted in a cold crucible using an induction coil and then the complete crucible-mould- running system assembly is rotated through 180 degrees to transfer the metal into the mould. The induction current is ramped down gradually as the rotation starts and the mould is preheated to maintain superheat. The liquid metal then enters the mould and the gas within it (argon) escapes through the <b>inlet</b> <b>aperture</b> and through auxiliary vents. Solidification starts as soon the metal enters the mould {{and it is important}} to account for this effect to predict and prevent misruns.

40|$|Most of the {{industrial}} software codes used for the prediction of the radar cross-section (RCS) of aircrafts are based on ray tracing. While ray based methods give useful scattered fields from {{the skin of the}} aircraft illuminated by an incident plane wave, they largely fail to predict the returns from cavities onboard. As a possible enhancement to these ray-tracing programs, an auxiliary program based on the modal method was developed to predict the scattering of electrically large and complex jet inlets and engines. It is assumed here that these structures can be approximated by a series of rectangular, circular, coaxial and sectoral waveguide sections. Field matching technique is used to give the generalized scattering matrices of the junctions between these waveguide sections. By combining the scattering matrices of the waveguide sections representing the inlet and engine, an overall S-matrix is obtained. Knowing the modes induced at the <b>inlet</b> <b>aperture</b> by the incident wave, the scattered fields from the inlet and engine can be readily predicted in all directions.

Monostatic RCS measurements of a 0. 706 m diameter test cylinder containing 30 skewed blades mounted on a centre shaft with a conical hub have been performed at X-band.
