40|$|International audienceInter-turn faults in the {{stator winding}} of PMSM {{is one of}} the major cause of motor failure. Therefore {{prevention}} and early detection of fault occurrence are crucial in the industrial field. <b>End</b> <b>winding</b> turns can suffer from mechanical vibration due to electromagnetic efforts. With aging, <b>end</b> <b>winding</b> blocking systems become weaker and turns insulation degrades until its breakdown. In this paper, a modeling and a detection method for intermittent inter-turn fault in PMSM stator <b>end</b> <b>winding</b> is presented. The given fault model is an intermittent inter-turn short circuit in the stator winding. In steady state operation, stator currents and reference voltages under fault condition contain fault information, and will be used for its detection. The method is based on the use of a wavelet transform for the detection of the fault. Simulation and experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach. ...|$|E

40|$|A three-level space phasor {{generation}} scheme {{with common}} mode elimination and with reduced power device count is proposed {{for an open}} <b>end</b> <b>winding</b> induction motor in this paper. The open <b>end</b> <b>winding</b> induction motor is fed by the three-level inverters from both sides. Each two level inverter is formed by cascading two two-level inverters. By sharing the bottom inverter for the two three-level inverters on either side, the power device count is reduced. The switching states with zero common mode voltage variation are selected for PWM switching {{so that there is}} no alternating common mode voltage in the pole voltages as well as in phase voltages. Only two isolated DC-links, with half the voltage rating of a conventional three-level neutral point clamped inverter, are needed for the proposed scheme...|$|E
40|$|Abstract – An {{induction}} motor operated with high voltage source generally generates high current in starting mode {{and has a}} long transient time after being started. This large and sustaining starting cur-rent causes the end windings of the stator to have excessive electromagnetic force. This force {{is the source of}} vibration and has a negative and serious influence on the insulation of end windings. There-fore, designing the <b>end</b> <b>winding</b> part with an appropriate support system is needed. To design the sup-port ring enclosing the end windings, we analyze the distribution of electromagnetic force on the end windings by applying the Biot–Savart’s law and the 3 D finite element method (FEM), and comparing two simulation methods. Finally, we verify the safety of the support structure of the <b>end</b> <b>winding</b> part using stress analysis, which is analyzed with the electromagnetic forces from the 3 D FEM simulation...|$|E
