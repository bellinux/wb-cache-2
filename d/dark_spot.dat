5|$|In 1989, the Great <b>Dark</b> <b>Spot,</b> an anti-cyclonic storm system {{spanning}} 13,000×6,600km, {{was discovered}} by NASA's Voyager 2 spacecraft. The storm resembled the Great Red Spot of Jupiter. Some five years later, on 2 November 1994, the Hubble Space Telescope {{did not see the}} Great <b>Dark</b> <b>Spot</b> on the planet. Instead, a new storm similar to the Great <b>Dark</b> <b>Spot</b> was found in Neptune's northern hemisphere.|$|E
5|$|The Scooter {{is another}} storm, a white cloud group farther south than the Great <b>Dark</b> <b>Spot.</b> This {{nickname}} first arose {{during the months}} leading up to the Voyager 2 encounter in 1989, when they were observed moving at speeds faster than the Great <b>Dark</b> <b>Spot</b> (and images acquired later would subsequently reveal the presence of clouds moving even faster than those that had initially been detected by Voyager 2). The Small <b>Dark</b> <b>Spot</b> is a southern cyclonic storm, the second-most-intense storm observed during the 1989 encounter. It was initially completely dark, but as Voyager 2 approached the planet, a bright core developed and can be seen in most of the highest-resolution images.|$|E
5|$|Waterspouts have a five-part life cycle: {{formation}} of a <b>dark</b> <b>spot</b> on the water surface, spiral pattern on the water surface, {{formation of}} a spray ring, development of the visible condensation funnel, and ultimately decay.|$|E
50|$|The {{color of}} the fish is brown, with indistinct <b>darker</b> <b>spots</b> and marblings. Round <b>dark</b> <b>spots</b> appear on the rayed fins, and may appear as bands.|$|R
50|$|The dorsum {{is covered}} in tubercles. There {{are a number of}} <b>dark</b> <b>spots</b> on the dorsum, but never on the tubercles themselves. These <b>dark</b> <b>spots</b> vary a lot in number from one {{individual}} to the next.|$|R
5|$|Neptune's <b>dark</b> <b>spots</b> {{are thought}} {{to occur in the}} {{troposphere}} at lower altitudes than the brighter cloud features, so they appear as holes in the upper cloud decks. As they are stable features that can persist for several months, they {{are thought to}} be vortex structures. Often associated with <b>dark</b> <b>spots</b> are brighter, persistent methane clouds that form around the tropopause layer. The persistence of companion clouds shows that some former <b>dark</b> <b>spots</b> may continue to exist as cyclones even though they are no longer visible as a <b>dark</b> feature. <b>Dark</b> <b>spots</b> may dissipate when they migrate too close to the equator or possibly through some other unknown mechanism.|$|R
5|$|Adults have {{forewings}} {{that are}} yellowish brown {{in color and}} have a <b>dark</b> <b>spot</b> located {{in the center of}} their body. The moths have a wingspan ranging from 32 to 45mm, and live over thirty days in optimal conditions. However, the life span ranges from five to fifteen days on average. They are nocturnal and hide in vegetation during the day. Adult moths collect nectar or other plant exudates from a large number of plants, and live for 12 to 16 days. Females can lay up to 2,500 eggs in their lifetime.|$|E
5|$|On Jupiter, cirrus {{clouds are}} {{composed}} of ammonia. When Jupiter's South Equatorial Belt disappeared, one hypothesis put forward by Glenn Orten was that a large quantity of ammonia cirrus clouds had formed above it, hiding it from view. NASA's Cassini probe detected these clouds on Saturn and thin water-ice cirrus on Saturn's moon Titan. Cirrus clouds composed of methane ice exist on Uranus. On Neptune, thin wispy clouds which could possibly be cirrus have been detected over the Great <b>Dark</b> <b>Spot.</b> As on Uranus, these are probably methane crystals.|$|E
5|$|The John Dory, {{though of}} uninviting appearance, is {{considered}} by some persons as the most delicious fish that appears at table; in the general estimation, however, it ranks next to the turbot, but it is far less abundant in our waters, and is not commonly to be procured of sufficient size for a handsome dish, except in some few parts of our coast which are celebrated for it. It may easily be known by its yellow gray colour, its one large <b>dark</b> <b>spot</b> on either side, the long filaments on the back, a general thickness of form, and its very ugly head. It is dressed in the same manner, and served usually with the same sauces as a turbot, but requires less time to boil it. The fins should be cut off before it is cooked.|$|E
50|$|Their colours {{vary from}} light brown to grey with darker blotches and {{numerous}} small <b>darker</b> <b>spots</b> and yellow patches. Sometimes the yellow patches {{are surrounded by}} small <b>dark</b> <b>spots.</b> The underside is creamy-white with a greyish margin. When threatened they can appear black.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 38.8-46.4 mm {{for males}} and 45.6-48.2 mm for females. Adults can be distinguished from related species by the antemedial and postmedial lines of both wings, which are composed of largish <b>dark</b> <b>spots.</b> There is also a series of lunate dots are outside the postmedial line and the subterminal line is composed of <b>dark</b> <b>spots</b> between the veins. Furthermore, the pale brown patches near the lower angle of the cell on the forewing are smaller and without <b>dark</b> <b>spots</b> inside.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} of the shell is white with <b>darker</b> <b>spots</b> and bars. It shows a white callus, through which the <b>darker</b> <b>spots</b> appear. These take occasionally the form of irregular ghostly bars (which gave rise to its synonymous name Acmaea spectrum - spectrum = ghost).|$|R
5|$|In August 1993, police raided Jackson's home and, {{according}} to court documents, found books and photographs in his bedroom featuring young boys {{with little or no}} clothing. Since the books were legal to purchase and own, the jury decided not to indict Jackson. Jordan Chandler gave police a description of Jackson's intimate parts; a strip search revealed that Jordan had correctly claimed Jackson had patchy-colored buttocks, short pubic hair, and pink and brown marked testicles. Reportedly, Jordan had also drawn accurate pictures of a <b>dark</b> <b>spot</b> on Jackson's penis only visible when his penis was lifted. Despite differing initial internal reports from prosecutors and investigators, with reports of jurors feeling that the photos did not match the description, the DA stated his belief in a sworn affidavit that the description was accurate, along with the sheriff's photographer stating the description was accurate. A 2004 motion filed by Jackson's defense asserted that Jackson was never criminally indicted by any grand jury and that his settlement admitted no wrongdoing and contained no evidence of criminal misconduct.|$|E
25|$|The Great Red Spot {{should not}} be {{confused}} with the Great <b>Dark</b> <b>Spot,</b> a feature observed near the northern pole of Jupiter in 2000 with the Cassini–Huygens spacecraft. Note that a feature in the atmosphere of Neptune was also called the Great <b>Dark</b> <b>Spot.</b> The latter feature was imaged by Voyager 2 in 1989, and may have been an atmospheric hole rather than a storm and it was no longer present as of 1994 (although a similar spot had appeared farther to the north).|$|E
25|$|The {{emergence}} of a <b>dark</b> <b>spot</b> on the hemisphere of Uranus that was in darkness for many years indicates that near equinox Uranus entered a period of elevated weather activity.|$|E
5000|$|Black necrosing syndrome, or <b>dark</b> <b>spots</b> disease, {{probably}} fungal.|$|R
50|$|Dorsally grayish, pale brown, reddish, or yellowish, {{with large}} <b>dark</b> <b>spots</b> or crossbars, {{the borders of}} which are serrated. One or two lateral series of smaller <b>dark</b> <b>spots.</b> A wide <b>dark</b> stripe behind the eye, bordered by light stripes both above and below. Ventrally whitish, {{speckled}} with gray or brown.|$|R
50|$|The upperside has a brown {{background}} {{with golden}} zig-zag borders along {{the margins of}} the hindwings. Females have lighter areas in the forewings with several <b>dark</b> <b>spots</b> within the lighter areas. The undersides are primarily white with <b>dark</b> <b>spots</b> and underlying orange areas. The wingspan is 23 to 38 mm.|$|R
25|$|Neptune has {{extremely}} dynamic weather systems, {{including the}} highest wind speeds in the Solar System, {{thought to be}} powered by the flow of internal heat. Typical winds in the banded equatorial region can possess speeds of around 350m/s, while storm systems can have winds reaching up to around 900m/s, nearly {{the speed of sound}} in Neptune's atmosphere. Several large storm systems have been identified, including the Great <b>Dark</b> <b>Spot,</b> a cyclonic storm system the size of Eurasia, the Scooter, a white cloud group further south than the Great <b>Dark</b> <b>Spot,</b> and the Wizard's eye/Dark Spot 2, a southern cyclonic storm.|$|E
25|$|The {{climate of}} Uranus is heavily {{influenced}} by both its lack of internal heat, which limits atmospheric activity, and by its extreme axial tilt, which induces intense seasonal variation. Uranus's atmosphere is remarkably bland {{in comparison to the}} other gas giants which it otherwise closely resembles. When Voyager 2 flew by Uranus in 1986, it observed a total of ten cloud features across the entire planet. Later observations from the ground or by the Hubble Space Telescope made in the 1990s and the 2000s revealed bright clouds in the northern (winter) hemisphere. In 2006 a <b>dark</b> <b>spot</b> similar to the Great <b>Dark</b> <b>Spot</b> on Neptune was detected.|$|E
25|$|Bider {{markings}} {{are only}} known in Przewalski's horses and native Mongolian horses from nearby. The bider is mostly symmetrical and found {{near the front}} of each shoulder, near the chest. The size of the bider ranges from a small <b>dark</b> <b>spot</b> to a large, webbed cape of darker skin and hair.|$|E
50|$|The {{shielded}} thick-toed gecko {{is a light}} olive brown colour with <b>darker</b> <b>spots</b> {{that cover}} the back; a line of these <b>darker</b> <b>spots</b> runs down the spine. It has a dark line that runs from the snout through the eye; this line is bordered on either side by pale lines.|$|R
5000|$|The body of {{the fish}} is a uniform brown or brown with indistinct <b>darker</b> <b>spots</b> on the body and fins. [...] Juveniles may also display large <b>dark</b> brown <b>spots</b> on the sides.|$|R
50|$|<b>Dark</b> <b>spots</b> {{appear on}} dunes {{in the higher}} latitudes of Mars.|$|R
25|$|The bluespotted {{trevally}} is a pale {{olive green}} above, fading {{to a more}} silvery white below, with adults having numerous small blue spots on {{the upper half of}} their bodies. The upper end of the opercle has a large <b>dark</b> <b>spot,</b> with a black spot also present at the upper base of the pectoral fins. All the fins are yellow green.|$|E
25|$|The bay whiting has a pale sandy brown {{head and}} body, ranging to a light fawn with no obvious mid-lateral silvery band as in S. argentifasciata. All fins are hyaline in appearance, and the {{pectoral}} fin has no <b>dark</b> <b>spot</b> at the base. Th operculum is almost clear, with the inner dark brown surface showing through. The {{tip of the}} nose is occasionally dark.|$|E
25|$|The blacktip trevally's {{colouration}} is distinctive, {{with the}} upper body being dark bronze to yellow green while the lower body fades to silvery white below. The caudal fin is bright to olive yellow, with the top half normally black to dark, giving the species its common name. Other fins range from bright yellow to dusky with little yellow at all. The species also lacks the <b>dark</b> <b>spot</b> on the opercular margin that many related species possess.|$|E
50|$|The {{wings are}} pale brown with <b>dark</b> <b>spots</b> and zig-zag lines.|$|R
5000|$|Floaters, {{which are}} <b>dark</b> <b>spots</b> that {{float in the}} visual field ...|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 11.5 mm. The forewings are greyish white mottled with numerous black scales. There are two <b>dark</b> <b>spots</b> at the base, three black {{spots in the}} middle and two indistinct <b>dark</b> <b>spots</b> at about three-quarters. The hindwings are light grey. Adults are on wing in September and from February to May.|$|R
25|$|The 2012–13 {{season was}} another <b>dark</b> <b>spot</b> for the BC Šiauliai club history. Firstly, they were {{eliminated}} in the quarter-final of BBL by BK Ventspils {{due to the}} unfavorable points ratio as they lost the second series game 80–87 and the first game was won only by 3 points (81–78). It was the club's all-time worst performance in BBL. In the 2012–13 LKL regular season they finished only 6th and were defeated by BC Prienai once again, this time – at the quarter-final 2–0.|$|E
25|$|The {{underside}} {{lacks the}} black borders and is lighter, {{with a more}} greenish tint, particularly on the forewings. In the forewing underside is the same <b>dark</b> <b>spot</b> as on the upperside, but often with a light centre; the hindwing underside has a white centre spot, often with a smaller white or dark dot immediately above it. Sometimes, a row of black dots occurs on the underwings' outer margins, corresponding to where the black border ends on the upperside. Females differ from the males in having yellow spots along the black borders on the upperside.|$|E
25|$|The yellowfin whiting is a sandy brown to pale silvery grey colour, with {{a darker}} dorsal surface and paler underside. There is a narrow silver mid-lateral band with a {{brownish}} band above, although these bands may be pale or indistinct. The dorsal fins are both hyaline {{with rows of}} small brown spots and the anal fins are pale yellow with a cream margin. The ventral fins are also yellowish, and the pectoral fin is pale yellow to hyaline with a fine dusting and lacks a <b>dark</b> <b>spot</b> at the base. As yellowfin whiting grow, the yellow colour of the fins often fades and in large specimens may be completely absent. The caudal fin is greyish.|$|E
5000|$|The south polar {{seasonal}} cap has {{a bizarre}} variety of bright and <b>dark</b> streaks and <b>spots</b> that appear during spring, as carbon dioxide ice sublimates. Prior to MRO there were various ideas for processes that could form these strange features, a leading model being carbon dioxide geysers. CRISM has watched the <b>dark</b> <b>spots</b> grow during southern spring, {{and found that}} bright streaks forming alongside the <b>dark</b> <b>spots</b> are made of fresh, new carbon dioxide frost, pointing like arrows back to their sources - the same sources as the <b>dark</b> <b>spots.</b> The bright streaks probably form by expansion, cooling, and freezing of the carbon dioxide gas, forming a [...] "smoking gun" [...] to support the geyser hypothesis.|$|R
50|$|Adults are grey with submarginal arcs of <b>dark</b> <b>spots</b> on each wing.|$|R
50|$|Adults are pale brown, {{except for}} two <b>dark</b> <b>spots</b> on the forewings.|$|R
