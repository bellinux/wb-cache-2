500|$|It was, as he recalled, [...] "a {{tremendous}} {{punch in}} the stomach to all of us". The aftermath of the fire, in which three astronauts were killed, left Lunney {{and his colleagues at}} NASA feeling that they had perhaps failed to recognize the risks they were running in their efforts to meet Kennedy's timetable of landing a man on the Moon {{by the end of the}} decade. [...] "Maybe," [...] said Lunney over thirty years later, [...] "we had <b>gotten</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> overconfident".|$|E
500|$|Critics {{disapproved of}} the {{continuing}} trend for cutting short Tina's solos. Gonzalez gave her rendition of [...] "I Follow Rivers" [...] a [...] "B" [...] and commented: [...] "Will Tina ever get to finish a song? Well, judging by the 20 seconds we saw, she certainly deserves to." [...] Futterman called her performance [...] "mostly spot-on", and TVLine Michael Slezak pointed out: [...] "Why is it that every time Tina sings—remember her sobbing [...] "My Funny Valentine"—things end weirdly? I wish we'd <b>gotten</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more vocal and a little less booing in an episode about the club's underappreciated talents." [...] Exton suggested, [...] "Maybe she'll {{get a chance to}} do a non-comedic relief song in its entirety by season 5?" [...] Flandez disliked her performance; he commented that she sounded [...] "like a flailing white swan, a poor man's Bjork." ...|$|E
500|$|Jeffrey Blitz {{wanted the}} film's music to be [...] "sweet {{and a touch}} melancholy and just a step out of rhythm", demonstrating Hal's sense of himself in the world, and to express his teenage angst while [...] "maintain an {{underlying}} sweetness". While writing the Rocket Science script, Blitz had been listening to indie rock band Clem Snide's music and suggested {{the use of their}} music on the soundtrack to the HBO executive producers. He contacted Clem Snide's lead singer Eef Barzelay to use some of the band's songs, but Barzelay says [...] "it just made more sense for me to write original instrumental music", and composed the incidental score himself. When choosing instruments, he tried to create sounds that would match Hal's awkwardness. [...] "I had this little ukulele that I never played... And Jeffrey [...] had <b>gotten</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bee in his bonnet about the accordion... and then at one point I started using a kazoo." [...] One of his original songs, [...] "I Love the Unknown", was chosen from the 1999 album Your Favorite Music.|$|E

500|$|After {{being formed}} and {{finishing}} {{third in the}} seventh series of The X Factor in 2010, One Direction were signed by Simon Cowell to a £2 million Syco Records record contract. Recording for their debut album began in January 2011, as they flew to Los Angeles to work with Moroccan-Swedish producer RedOne. In February 2011, One Direction and nine other contestants from the series participated in the X Factor Live Tour. After the tour concluded in April 2011, the group continued working on their debut album. Recording took place in Sweden, the United States, and the United Kingdom, as One Direction worked with producers Carl Falk, Savan Kotecha, Steve Mac, RedOne, Toby Gad and Rami Yacoub, among others. The album also features songs written by Ed Sheeran, Kelly Clarkson, and Tom Fletcher. In May 2011, Kotecha spoke to Digital Spy, and he elaborated that One Direction were [...] "experimenting" [...] with sounds on their debut album. Kotecha {{said that he was}} involved in the [...] "early stages" [...] of producing the record. [...] "The stuff I've heard has been really catchy and everyone loves the guys, so it's just about capturing that in the music, which I think is what they're going to be doing." [...] Sonny Takhar, {{the chief executive officer of}} Syco Records, in an August 2011 issue of Music Week, described the recording process as a [...] "very intensive period" [...] for the group. Takhar added the resulting album was one of the best pop records made by Syco Records in the past few years, and that he was confident it would be successful. In November 2011, they signed a record deal with Columbia Records in North America. Steve Barnett, the co-chairman of Columbia Records, said it was not a difficult decision to sign with One Direction. [...] "Other artists in that category had <b>gotten</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> older," [...] he said. [...] "I just thought there was a void, and maybe they could seize and hold it." ...|$|E
2500|$|While Clinton {{recognized}} some of {{the contradictions}} of U.S. policy towards turmoil in the Mideast countries, which involving backing some regimes while supporting protesters against others, she was nevertheless passionate on the subject, enough so that Obama joked at the annual Gridiron Dinner that [...] "I've dispatched Hillary to the Middle East {{to talk about how}} these countries can transition to new leaders—though, I've got to be honest, she's <b>gotten</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> passionate about the subject. These past few weeks it's been tough falling asleep with Hillary out there on Pennsylvania Avenue shouting, throwing rocks at the window." [...] In any case, Obama's reference to Clinton travelling a lot was true enough; by now she had logged [...] in her Boeing 757, more than any other Secretary of State for a comparable period of time, and had visited 79 countries while in the office. Time magazine wrote that [...] "Clinton's endurance is legendary" [...] and that she would still be going at the end of long work days even as her staff members were glazing out. The key was her ability to fall asleep on demand, at any time and place, for power naps.|$|E
2500|$|She {{supported}} {{the concept that}} abortion is a woman's choice, that it shouldn't be a crime or exclusively a doctor's choice or anyone else involved, and helped form NARAL (now NARAL Pro-Choice America) {{at a time when}} Planned Parenthood wasn't yet supportive. Alleged death threats against her speaking on abortion led to the cancellation of two events, although subsequently one of the host institutions, Loyola College, invited her back to speak on abortion and other homosexual rights issues and she did so. Her draft of NOW's first statement of purpose included an abortion plank, but NOW didn't include it until the next year. In 1980, she believed abortion should be in the context of [...] "'the choice to have children'", a formulation supported by the Roman Catholic priest organizing Catholic participation in the White House Conference on Families for that year, though perhaps not by the bishops above him. A resolution embodying the formulation passed at the conference by 460 to 114, whereas a resolution addressing abortion, ERA and [...] "sexual preference" [...] passed by only 292–291 and that only after 50 opponents of abortion had walked out and so hadn't voted on it. She disagreed with a resolution that framed abortion in more feminist terms that was introduced in the Minneapolis regional conference resulting from the same White House Conference on Families, believing it to be more polarizing, while the drafters apparently thought Friedan's formulation too conservative. As of 2000, she wrote, referring to [...] "NOW and the other women's organizations" [...] as seeming to be in a [...] "time warp", [...] "to my mind, there is far too much focus on abortion.... n recent years I've <b>gotten</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> uneasy about the movement's narrow focus on abortion {{as if it were the}} single, all-important issue for women when it's not". She asked, [...] "Why don't we join forces with all who have true reverence for life, including Catholics who oppose abortion, and fight for the choice to have children?" ...|$|E

The queen’s joiner had contrived in one of Glumdalclitch’s rooms, a kind of wooden machine five-and-twenty feet high, formed like a standing ladder; the steps were each fifty feet long. It was indeed a moveable pair of stairs, the lowest end placed at ten feet distance from the wall of the chamber. The book I had a mind to read, was put up leaning against the wall: I first mounted to the upper step of the ladder, and turning my face towards the book, began {{at the top of the}} page, and so walking to the right and left about eight or ten paces, according to the length of the lines, till I had <b>gotten</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> below the level of mine eyes, and then descending gradually till I came to the bottom: after which I mounted again, and began the other page in the same manner, and so turned over the leaf, which I could easily do with both my hands, for it was as thick and stiff as a pasteboard, and in the largest folios not above eighteen or twenty feet long.|$|E
