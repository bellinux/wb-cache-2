The {{aim of this study}} was to present and evaluate the procedures used in a case-control study on leukaemia. METHODS: A series of 1, 087 cases and matched controls were interviewed. <b>Exposure</b> <b>assessments</b> were performed for 13 occupational agents and ten leisure-time activities and the confidence of the assessments was coded. The <b>exposure</b> <b>assessments</b> were performed blind by three occupational hygienists. Ten percent of the interviews were reassessed by two of the three occupational hygienists. RESULTS: The leisure-time activities contributed to a large extent to the overall prevalence of exposure. For organic solvents approximately 25 % of the controls classified as exposed would be misclassified if leisure-time exposure were not considered. The proportions of subject assessments with low confidence were higher for next-of-kin than for in-person interviews. A negative correlation was seen between the proportions of assessments with low confidence and the reliability. A significant difference was seen in the inter-rater comparison between cases and controls when the reliability was calculated for each assessed period; no difference was seen for the subject assessments used for relative risk estimation. CONCLUSION: When low-dose exposure in epidemiological studies are being assessed there is an obvious risk of misclassification if leisure-time activities are not included. Furthermore, the reliability of the assessments may suffer if next-of-kin interviews are used to a large extent. For cancers with poor prognoses, prospective studies are preferable to minimise possible information bias...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Considerable {{information}} {{exists as}} to the initial concentrations of pesticide residues to be expected in soils, plants, and water. Empirical or theoretical models {{have been developed for}} incorporating this data into <b>exposure</b> <b>assessments</b> for humans as well as terrestrial and aquatic wildlife. In addition, monitoring data exists for many older products, especially with respect to typical concentrations observed in food commodities for human consumption and in surface and ground waters. Estimated and observed concentrations of pesticides in these matrices have been routinely employed for more than 30 years in assessing the potential impacts of pesticides on a variety of biologically relevant endpoints. The same data will also prove useful for <b>exposure</b> <b>assessments</b> of endocrine active substances. There are some additional research needs, however. First, further research and development is needed to ensure that estimation and monitoring methods for pesticide concentrations in soil, water, and food are applicable and utilized for all important and relevant cultural, agronomic, and environmental conditions. This is especially true with respect to developing countries and tropical climates, which are often disproportionately ignored in favor of developing countries and temperate climates. Second, methodologies for collection of monitoring data and generation of modeled estimates for pesticide residues in soil, water, and food need to be carefully designed with the requirements of higher-tier, probabilistic <b>exposure</b> <b>assessments</b> in view. Although worst-case, point estimates or analyses may be useful for screening-level assessments, advanced assessments targeted at addressing the likelihood of biologically relevant exposures are urgently required by scientists and regulatory authorities for reaching sound risk assessment and management decisions...|$|R
