40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} <b>higher</b> natural <b>gas</b> <b>prices</b> on the Northeast regional economy. While {{there is a common}} belief that <b>higher</b> <b>gas</b> <b>prices</b> will further disadvantage the already high-energy-cost Northeast, recent analysis suggests the opposite conclusion. Simply stated, by virtue of using relatively little natural gas, industry in the Northeast will likely experience an improvement in its competitiveness as <b>gas</b> <b>prices</b> rise; at the same time, the region could contribute relatively little to the <b>higher</b> revenues for <b>gas</b> producers. In contrast, by virtue of high population, high income, political strength, and improved competitiveness, the region will likely receive at least its proportionate share of these revenues as they are recycled throughout the national economy Copyright 1982 Western Economic Association International. ...|$|R

25|$|With the {{deregulation}} of the electricity market in the 1990s, Norske Skog was concerned regarding its purchasing price of power. An agreement was struck in 1998 with Statkraft to purchase necessary power to an agreed-upon price until 2020. The company also started working on plans for a thermal power station at Fiborgtangen, which could be fired by natural gas from the Heidrun Oil Field. This would be supplied through a proposed gas pipeline from Tjeldbergodden. Norske Skog allied with Elkem and Statoil to create Industrikraft Midt-Norge. Permission was granted in 2001 for a plant with an annual output of 6.4terawatt-hours.

25|$|In {{general as}} {{we see in the}} graph below, <b>high</b> <b>gas</b> <b>prices</b> are {{typically}} associated to low storage periods. Usually when prices are high during the early months of the refill season (April–October), many users of storage adopt a wait and see attitude. They limit their gas intake in anticipation that the prices will drop before the heating season begins (November–March). However, when that decrease does not occur, they are forced to buy natural gas at high prices. This is particularly true for Local Distribution and other operators who rely on storage to meet the seasonal demand for their customers. On the other hand, other storage users, who use storage as a marketing tool (hedging or speculating) will hold off storing a lot of gas when the prices are high.|$|E

Because of <b>high</b> <b>gas</b> <b>prices</b> in the Netherlands, two of the three units are currently offline, whilst the third unit sees only low usage levels.
