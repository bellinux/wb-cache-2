5|$|In 1912, Selbie, then General Manager, {{thought that}} some professionalism was needed and {{suggested}} a company be formed {{to take over}} from the Surplus Lands Committee to develop estates near the railway. World War I delayed these plans and it was 1919, with expectation of a housing boom, before Metropolitan Railway Country Estates Limited (MRCE) was formed. Concerned that Parliament might reconsider the unique position the Met held, the railway company sought legal advice, which was that although the Met had authority to hold land, it had none to develop it. An independent company was created, although {{all but one of}} its directors were also directors of the Met.

500|$|Sir Humphrey de Trafford had {{retained}} [...] of land on {{the western}} side of the ship canal after his 1897 sale of Trafford Park. Hemmed in as it was between the canals and [...] "an increasingly urbanised Stretford to the east", as the industrialisation of the park neared its completion the Estates Company started to acquire parcels of the remaining de Trafford land, then in the control of family trustees, as did the Canal Company. In 1924 the Estates Company bought a half share in Dumplington Estates Ltd., a company set up to administer [...] of land bought from the de Trafford Trustees on which it was intended to build a <b>garden</b> <b>village.</b> In 1929 the Ship Canal Company acquired Dumplington Estates, and in return gave the Estates Company land to the south of Barton, the Trafford Park Extension. The Canal Company recognised the potential for a new dock on the land, giving the area its name of Barton Dock Estate, although no dock was ever built. The Barton Docks area was developed during and after the Second World War, but the land belonging to Dumplington Estates remained largely undeveloped until the construction of the Trafford Centre, which opened in 1998.|$|E

2500|$|In a 2006 {{study of}} Fry in the Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians, R. W. Liscombe writes that Fry, {{frustrated}} at the prevailing conservatism of British architecture and society, renounced Reilly's neo-classicism {{in favour of}} [...] "an independent functionalist design idiom modified from the main German and French progenitors of the modern movement". Liscombe adds that the [...] "austere formalism and social idealism" [...] of continental modernism appealed to Fry's moral outlook and his desire for social change. Fry's biographer Alan Powers writes that the change in Fry's aesthetic views came gradually; he continued to design in the neo-classical style for some years: [...] "As a partner in Adams, Thompson and Fry, he designed a <b>garden</b> <b>village</b> at Kemsley near Sittingbourne in 1929, and a house at Wentworth, Surrey, in 1932, in the refined neo-Georgian style typical of the Liverpool school." [...] Wells Coates, a colleague at Adams, Thompson and Fry tried to enthuse Fry with the example of Le Corbusier, but his conversion to modernism, in Powers's words, [...] "came principally through his membership of the Design and Industries Association, which introduced him to modern German housing. ... was also influenced by the Congrès Internationaux d'Architecture Moderne, and was closely involved in its English branch, the Modern Architectural Research (MARS) Group, following its establishment in 1933." [...] Even after his espousal of modernism, Fry remained fond of neo-classical architecture, lending his support to a campaign to preserve Nash's Carlton House Terrace in the 1930s.|$|E
