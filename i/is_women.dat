There is a strong monastic tradition, pursued by both {{men and women in the}} Orthodox Church, where monks and nuns lead identical spiritual lives. Unlike Latin Rite Catholic religious life, which has myriad traditions, both contemplative and active (see Benedictine and Cistercian monks, Dominican friars, Franciscan friars, Jesuits), that of Orthodoxy and the Christian East generally has remained exclusively ascetic and monastic, relying principally upon the early Syriac tradition, the Desert Fathers, and the Rule of Saint Benedict of Nursia.|$|E
25|$|The {{greatest}} {{difference between}} de Romieu’s Brief Discourse and Estienne’s Paradoxes {{can be found}} within the author’s voice. Marie de Romieu’s is distinctly a woman’s voice, showcasing true indignity {{at the idea that}} it <b>is</b> <b>women</b> who lead men astray. She proceeds to thoroughly develop on the notion that men are at fault, attempting to seduce women with their wily ways. De Romieu then accuses them of blaming guileless women for the seduction they impose upon their innocence. She attributes the injustice to man’s ignorance, comparing him to a “cock who cannot distinguish between a pearl and a stone”. Furthermore, while Estienne’s audience was primarily masculine, de Romieu speaks to multiple audiences. She addresses women, including herself, as “us, women” and “we, my ladies”, as well as a universal and neutral “one”. She utilizes those when presenting dialogue in which a masculine voice presents arguments that are subsequently countered by her own female voice.|$|E

2500|$|In {{particular}} Austen uses irony {{to critique}} the marriage market. Perhaps {{the most famous}} example of irony in Austen is the opening line of Pride and Prejudice: [...] "It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man {{in possession of a}} good fortune, must be in want of a wife." [...] At first glance, the sentence is straightforward and plausible, but the plot of the novel contradicts it: it <b>is</b> <b>women</b> without fortunes who need husbands and seek them out.

2500|$|The {{main story}} is an allegory of Christ's crucifixion: [...] Aslan sacrifices himself for Edmund, a traitor who may deserve death, {{in the same}} way that Christians believe Jesus sacrificed himself for sinners. [...] Aslan is killed on the Stone Table, symbolizing Mosaic Law, which breaks when he is resurrected, symbolizing the {{replacement}} of the strict justice of Old Testament law with redeeming grace and forgiveness granted on the basis of substitutional atonement, according to Christian theology. [...] As with the Christian Passion, it <b>is</b> <b>women</b> (Susan and Lucy) who tend Aslan's body after he dies and are the first to see him after his resurrection. The significance of the death contains elements of both the ransom theory of atonement and the satisfaction theory: [...] Aslan suffers Edmund's penalty (satisfaction), and buys him back from the White Witch, who was entitled to him by reason of his treachery (ransom). In Christian belief, Christ is associated with the Biblical [...] "Lion of Judah" [...] of Revelation 5:5.|$|E

2500|$|The Equal Rights Amendment is a perennially {{proposed}} {{amendment to}} the United States Constitution that would grant equal rights and opportunities to every citizen of the United States, regardless {{of his or her}} sex. In 1950 and 1953, ERA was passed by the Senate with a provision known as [...] "the Hayden rider", making it unacceptable to ERA supporters. The Hayden rider was included to keep special protections for women. A new section to the ERA was added, stating: [...] "The provisions of this article shall not be construed to impair any rights, benefits, or exemptions now or hereafter conferred by law upon persons of the female sex." [...] That <b>is,</b> <b>women</b> could keep their existing and future special protections that men did not have. By 1972, the amendment was supported by both major parties and was immensely popular. However, it was defeated in Congress when it failed to get the vote of thirty-eight legislatures by 1982. Supporters of an unaltered ERA rejected the Hayden rider, believing an ERA containing the rider did not provide for equality.|$|E

Why not formulate them in serious and argumentative books, where wise men alone will come across them?"

Women, in particular, are the chief readers of fiction; and it <b>is</b> <b>women</b> whom one mainly desires to arouse to interest in profound problems by the aid of this vehicle. Especially should one arouse them to such living interest while they are still young and plastic, before they have crystallised and hardened into the conventional marionettes of polite society. Make them think while they are young: make them feel while they are sensitive: it is then alone that they will think and feel, if ever. I will venture, indeed, to enforce my views on this subject by a little apologue which I have somewhere read, or heard,--or invented.|$|E
