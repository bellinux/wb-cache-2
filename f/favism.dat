25|$|Pharmacogenomics {{was first}} {{recognized}} by Pythagoras around 510 BC {{when he made}} {{a connection between the}} dangers of fava bean ingestion with hemolytic anemia and oxidative stress. Interestingly, this identification was later validated and attributed to deficiency of G6PD in the 1950s and called <b>favism.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1956 Alving {{and colleagues}} {{showed that in}} some African Americans the {{antimalarial}} drug primaquine induces hemolytic anemia, and that those individuals have an inherited deficiency of G6PD in erythrocytes. G6PD deficiency is sex-linked, and common in Mediterranean, African and other populations. In Mediterranean countries such individuals can develop a hemolytic diathesis (<b>favism)</b> after consuming fava beans. G6PD deficient persons are also sensitive to several drugs in addition to primaquine.|$|E
25|$|In both {{legend and}} mythology, <b>Favism</b> {{has been known}} since antiquity. The priests of various Greco-Roman era cults were {{forbidden}} to eat or even mention beans, and Pythagoras had a strict rule that to join {{the society of the}} Pythagoreans one had to swear off beans. This ban was supposedly because beans resembled male genitalia, but it is possible that this was because of a belief that beans and humans were created from the same material.|$|E
25|$|Glucose-6-phosphate {{dehydrogenase}} deficiency (G6PD deficiency), a form {{of which}} is known as <b>favism</b> (after the fava bean), is an X-linked recessive inborn error of metabolism that predisposes to hemolysis (spontaneous destruction of red blood cells) and resultant jaundice {{in response to a}} number of triggers, such as certain foods, illness, or medication. It is particularly common in people of Mediterranean and African origin. The condition is characterized by abnormally low levels of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, an enzyme involved in the pentose phosphate pathway that is especially important in the red blood cell. G6PD deficiency is the most common human enzyme condition. There is no specific treatment, other than avoiding known triggers. In the United States, no genetic screening of prospective parents is recommended, as the symptoms only show in part of the carriers and when that is the case, they can be prevented or controlled, and as a result the condition generally has no impact on the lifespan of those affected. However, globally G6PD deficiency has resulted in 4,100 deaths in 2013 and 3,400 deaths in 1990.|$|E

50|$|Divicine {{has been}} deemed a hemotoxic {{component}} of fava beans and {{plays a role}} in the development of <b>favism,</b> a disorder that involves a hemolytic response to the consumption of broad beans due to glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD or G6PDH) deficiency. This deficiency, an X-linked recessive hereditary disease, is the most common enzyme deficiency worldwide. It is particularly common in those of African, Asian, Mediterranean, and Middle-Eastern descent. Symptoms of <b>favism</b> include hemolysis, prolonged jaundice, kernicterus, and even acute renal failure in extreme cases.|$|E
50|$|Alleles {{that will}} only be fatal in {{response}} to some environmental factor {{are referred to as}} conditional lethals. One example of a conditional lethal is <b>favism,</b> a sex-linked inherited condition that causes the carrier to develop hemolytic anemia when they eat fava beans.|$|E

5000|$|The {{followers}} of Pythagoras were vegetarians, and [...] "Pythagorean" [...] {{at one time}} came to mean [...] "vegetarian". However, their creed prohibited the eating of beans.

5000|$|In {{his early}} studies, Razin {{examined}} the metabolism of nucleic acids and the biochemical faults {{in patients with}} gout and <b>favism.</b> He later studied the specific mutation {{with the aid of}} a chemically synthesized DNA-sequence, DNA methylation in gene activity and methylation pattern production of single genes in the development of the fetus.|$|E
50|$|<b>Favism,</b> or Fava-bean-ism, is {{a genetic}} {{deficiency}} of the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase that affects Jews, other Middle Eastern Semitic peoples and other {{descendants of the}} Mediterranean coastal regions. In this condition, the toxic reaction to eating most, if not all, beans is hemolytic anemia, and in severe cases the released circulating free hemoglobin causes acute kidney injury.|$|E
50|$|In general, {{signs of}} anemia (pallor, fatigue, {{shortness}} of breath, and potential for heart failure) are present. In small children, {{failure to thrive}} may occur in any form of anemia. Certain aspects of the medical history can suggest a cause for hemolysis, such as drugs, consumption of fava beans due to <b>Favism,</b> the presence of prosthetic heart valve, or other medical illness.|$|E
50|$|In Iran Bowman {{saw many}} {{diseases}} {{for the first}} time. “I saw smallpox, brucellosis, rabies, all sorts of things,” he said. One {{of the most common}} diseases among certain ethnic groups in Iran was <b>favism,</b> a metabolic disease caused by an enzyme deficiency in red blood cells. The mutation, which is the most common human enzyme defect, renders those who have it unable to break down a toxin found in fava beans. <b>Favism</b> fit with Bowman’s lifelong focus on inherited blood diseases and led to a series of important discoveries about the genetics of these diseases and the populations they affect, especially in the Middle East, Africa and America. It enabled him to travel all over the world collecting blood samples for DNA testing. It also led to frequent contacts and collaborations with University of Chicago researchers, who had first described the enzyme deficiency (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, or G6PD) and its connection with antimalarial medications.|$|E

50|$|The {{specific}} {{mechanism of}} divicine’s toxicity is still unknown. It {{had been established}} that the β-glucosides vicine and convicine were linked to the precipitation of hemolytic crises in G6PDH-deficient individuals, but in a more recent study of rat erythrocyte toxicity, exposure to 1.5 mM of divicine dramatically reduced survival rates while exposure to 5 mM of vicine did not. These results suggest that divicine is a direct-acting hemolytic agent and likely the direct cause of <b>favism.</b>|$|E
50|$|In <b>favism,</b> {{patients}} lack glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, {{an enzyme}} in their pentose phosphate pathway that reduces NADP+ to NADPH while catalyzing {{the conversion of}} glucose-6-phosphate to 6-phosphoglucono-δ-lactone. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficient individuals have less NADPH available for the reduction of oxidized glutathione via glutathione reductase. Thus their basal ratio of oxidized to reduced glutathione is significantly {{higher than that of}} patients who express glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, normally, making them unable to effectively respond to high levels of reactive oxygen species, which causes cell lysis.|$|E
50|$|Glutathione reductase {{deficiency}} {{is a rare}} {{disorder in}} which the glutathione reductase activity is absent from erythrocytes, leukocytes or both. In one study this disorder was observed in only two cases in 15,000 tests for glutathione reductase deficiency performed {{over the course of}} 30 years. In the same study, glutathione reductase deficiency was associated with cataracts and <b>favism</b> in one patient and their family, and with severe unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia in another patient. It has been proposed that the glutathione redox system (of which glutathione reductase is a part) is almost exclusively responsible for the protecting of eye lens cells from hydrogen peroxide because these cells are deficient in catalase, an enzyme which catalyzes the breakdown of hydrogen peroxide, and the high rate of cataract incidence in glutathione reductase deficient individuals.|$|E

50|$|Dr. Hedayat {{is author}} or {{co-author}} of six books, thirty three academic papers, over fifty research reports {{on food and}} nutrition, and over one hundred presentations at national and international conferences (in Persian, English and French). He was the founder and editor-in-chief of the Nutrition Journal published in Persian by INFSI. He was {{also a member of}} the editorial board of Ecology of Food and Nutrition published in English in London, Washington and Tokyo. One of his major scientific achievements was overseeing the evaluation of the nutritional status and needs of the Iranian people conducted by survey teams in 30 different urban, rural, tribal and industrial locations. The result of this survey (published in Persian and English) which was reported to FAO, was considered as the most reputable nutritional survey in the third world, and used as a reference for developing countries. Dr. Hedayat also managed research projects on <b>Favism</b> and Endemic Goiter in Iran. He personally presented the results of his research project on the fortification and enrichment of Iranian bread with synthetic amino acid Lysine in a conference at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA.|$|E
5000|$|Cystathionine, an {{intermediary}} product of this biochemical pathway, is secreted in urine. This process can effectively {{lead to the}} depletion of vital protective reserves of the sulfur amino acid cysteine and thereby making Vicia sativa seed a dangerous component in mixture with other toxin sources. The Spanish pulse mix [...] contains common vetch and bitter vetch in addition to vetchling (Lathyrus cicera) seeds; it can be fed in small quantities to ruminants, but its use as a staple food will cause lathyrism even in these animals. Moreover, common vetch as well as broad bean - and probably other species of Vicia too - contain oxidants like convicine, isouramil, divicine and vicine in quantities sufficient to lower glutathione levels in G6PD-deficient persons to cause <b>favism</b> disease. At least broad beans also contain the lectin phytohemagglutinin and are somewhat poisonous if eaten raw. Split common vetch seeds resemble split red lentils (Lens culinaris), and has been occasionally mislabelled as such by exporters or importers to be sold for human consumption. In some countries where lentils are highly popular - e.g., Bangladesh, Egypt, India and Pakistan - import bans on suspect produce have been established to prevent these potentially harmful scams.|$|E
50|$|Chronic {{exposure}} to {{high level of}} nitrogen dioxide results in the allosteric inhibition of glutathione peroxidase and glutathione S-transferase, {{both of which are}} important enzymes found in the mucous membrane antioxidant defense system, that catalyse nucleophilic attack by reduced glutathione (GSH) on non-polar compounds that contain an electrophillic carbon and nitrogen. These inhibition mechanisms generates free radicals that causes peroxidation from the lipids in the mucous membrane leading to increased peroxidized eyrthrocyte lipids, a reaction that proceeds by a free radical chain reaction mechanism that result in oxidative stress. The oxidative stress on the mucous membrane causes the dissociation of the GSTp-JNK complex, oligomerization of GSTP and induction of the JNK pathway, resulting in apoptosis or inflammation of the bronchioles and pulmonary alveolus in mild cases.On migrating to the bloodstream, nitrogen dioxide poisoning results in an irreversible inhibition of the erythrocite membrane acetylcholinesterase which may lead to muscular paralysis, convulsions, bronchoconstriction, the narrowing of the airways in the lungs (bronchi and bronchioles) and death by asphyxiation. It also causes a decrease in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase which may results in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency known as <b>favism,</b> a condition that predisposes to hemolysis (spontaneous destruction of red blood cells).Acute and chronic exposure also reduces glutathione reductase, an enzyme that catalyzes the reduction of glutathione disulfide (GSSG) to the sulfhydryl form glutathione (GSH), which is a critical molecule in resisting oxidative stress and maintaining the reducing environment of the cell.|$|E
