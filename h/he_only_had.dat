5|$|Although <b>he</b> <b>only</b> <b>had</b> an {{elementary}} education and {{had previously been}} a clerk in the state administration, Karamchand proved a capable chief minister. During his tenure, Karamchand married four times. His first two wives died young, after each {{had given birth to}} a daughter, and his third marriage was childless. In 1857, Karamchand sought his third wife's permission to remarry; that year, he married Putlibai (1844–1891), who also came from Junagadh, and was from a Pranami Vaishnava family. Karamchand and Putlibai had three children over the ensuing decade, a son, Laxmidas (c. 1860 – March 1914), a daughter, Raliatbehn (1862–1960) and another son, Karsandas (c. 1866–1913).|$|E

5|$|Christologically Maximus {{insisted on}} a strict dyophysitism, which {{can be seen as}} a {{corollary}} of the emphasis on theosis. In terms of salvation, humanity is intended to be fully united with God. This is possible for Maximus because God was first fully united with humanity in the incarnation. If Christ did not become fully human (if, for example, <b>he</b> <b>only</b> <b>had</b> a divine and not a human will), then salvation was no longer possible, as humanity could not become fully divine.|$|E
5|$|In 1913 he {{debuted in}} film, but <b>he</b> <b>only</b> <b>had</b> modest {{success in the}} medium. He {{continued}} to perform in variety theatre in the inter-war years and, in 1932, starred in Helen!, his first straight theatre role. His appearance {{brought him to the}} attention of many influential directors, including Sydney Carroll, who signed him to appear on stage as Falstaff in Henry IV, Part 1 in 1935, a role that he later repeated in Laurence Olivier's 1944 film, Henry V. During the Second World War, Robey raised money for charities and promoted recruitment into the forces. By the 1950s, his health had deteriorated, and he entered into semi-retirement. He was knighted a few months before his death in 1954.|$|E

Either hook on its own is really not enough to carry the film. Combined, they made for a much deeper movie: When a man learns <b>he</b> <b>only</b> <b>has</b> five years to live, he dedicates his life to living his dream of performing on Letterman.|$|R
5|$|Kyle Vogt, {{who played}} Peter, told the {{production}} {{team at the}} outset of filming that <b>he</b> <b>only</b> <b>had</b> a limited amount of time to dedicate to the project.

5|$|Shortly after {{completing}} the expedition and {{with the majority of}} his forces in his way back, Przemysł II received a confidential message that the fortress of Drezdenko was protected by only a few German knights. The young prince, despite the fact that <b>he</b> <b>only</b> <b>had</b> a part of his forces, decided to make a quick attack. This completely surprised the defenders and fearing the same fate of soldiers from Strzelce Krajeńskie, they decided to surrender the fortress in exchange for a full pardon. After this, Przemysł II took the fortress in the name of his uncle and triumphantly returned home.|$|E
5|$|After {{the final}} hand, Lady Fingers {{questioned}} Howard {{how he could}} have made that $1000 raise, to which Howard replied that poker was all about making the wrong move at the right time. On third street, the Kid bet $1000 into a $1000 pot {{with a pair of}} 10s shows while Howard had just a Queen high. By raising $1000, Howard was possibly representing a Queen in the hole and trying to buy the pot at the point. The Kid only had to put in another $1000 into a $4000, so he was offered 4 to 1 odds, which were very favorable odds, since <b>he</b> <b>only</b> <b>had</b> to be right 1 in 5 times to break even. Howard seemed to be relying on implied odds to justify that raise as well as the $3000 call on fourth street.|$|E

5|$|By mid-January Captain García de Paredes {{had arrived}} at the advance portion of the Camino Real at Chuntuki. By now <b>he</b> <b>only</b> <b>had</b> 90 {{soldiers}} plus labourers and porters. Captain Pedro de Zubiaur, García’s senior officer, arrived at Lake Petén Itza with 60 musketeers, two Franciscans, and allied Yucatec Maya warriors. They were also accompanied by about 40 Maya porters. They were approached by about 300 canoes carrying approximately 2,000 Itza warriors. The warriors began to mingle freely with the Spanish party and a scuffle then broke out; a dozen of the Spanish party were forced into canoes, and three of them were killed. At this point the Spanish soldiers opened fire with their muskets, and the Itza retreated across the lake with their prisoners, who included the two Franciscans. The Spanish party retreated from the lake shore and regrouped on open ground where they were surrounded by thousands of Itza warriors. Zubiaur ordered his men to fire a volley that killed between 30 and 40 Itzas. Realising that they were hopelessly outnumbered, the Spanish retreated towards Chuntuki, abandoning their captured companions to their fate.|$|E
5|$|In 195758, the Australian Test team toured South Africa {{during the}} {{southern}} hemisphere summer, opening up opportunities in the Shield competition back in Australia. Booth established himself at first-class level with 503 runs at 50.30. After scoring two fifties, he broke through for his maiden first-class century against the Victorian Bushrangers at the Sydney Cricket Ground, in his last match of the season. He put on a partnership of 325 with future Test teammate Norm O'Neill in fewer than four hours. It was his fifteenth first-class match, and helped his state secure a fifth successive title with a ten-wicket win over their arch-rivals. With the Test players returning to Australia in 195859, Booth again faced more competition for places. He struggled, playing six matches and aggregating only 190 runs at 31.66. <b>He</b> <b>only</b> <b>had</b> six innings for the entire season, and in his only opportunity against Peter May's touring Englishmen, he made a duck. Booth passed 50 on two occasions during the season, making 75 and 85. In one high-scoring match against South Australia, he took 0/97 with his part-time off spin.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, {{sequestration}} {{budget cuts}} {{cast doubt on}} the USAF's ability to complete the Combat Avionics Programmed Extension Suite (CAPES), a part of secondary programs such as Taiwan's F-16 upgrade. ACC's General Mike Hostage stated that if <b>he</b> <b>only</b> <b>had</b> money for SLEP (service life extension program) or CAPES, he would fund SLEP to keep the aircraft flying. Lockheed Martin responded to talk of CAPES cancellation with a fixed-price upgrade package for foreign users. CAPES {{was not included in the}} Pentagon's 2015 budget request. The USAF said that the upgrade package will still be offered to Taiwan, and Lockheed said that some common elements with the F-35 will keep the radar's unit costs down. In 2014 the USAF issued a RFI to SLEP 300 F-16 C/Ds.|$|E

5|$|In January 2005, {{a series}} of one-day {{domestic}} tournaments were held, and Karthik {{had a chance to}} press his claims for selection in that format, having never played more than three List A matches in a sequence. In five matches for Tamil Nadu, <b>he</b> <b>only</b> <b>had</b> three innings, but scored 72 and 80 in two of them. He was then called into South Zone’s senior team for the first time, to play in the zonal one-day competition. He scored 106 runs at 26.50 in four outings for the southerners. In the Challenger Trophy, Karthik played for India A against India B and India Seniors, and made little impact, scoring 17 and 3. He then played for South Zone in the first-class Duleep Trophy, but continued to have modest returns with the bat, scoring 101 runs at 25.25 in two outings, although he was run out in one innings after making a start and reaching 59.|$|E
5|$|Stone {{wanted to}} {{recreate}} the Kennedy assassination in Dealey Plaza. His producers had to pay the Dallas City Council {{a substantial amount of}} money to hire police to reroute traffic and close streets for three weeks. <b>He</b> <b>only</b> <b>had</b> ten days to shoot all of the footage he needed and so he used seven cameras (two 35mm and five 16mm) and 14 film stocks. Getting permission to shoot in the Texas School Book Depository was more difficult. They had to pay $50,000 to put someone in the window from which Oswald was supposed to have shot Kennedy. They were allowed to film in that location only between certain hours with only five people on the floor at one time: the camera crew, an actor and Stone. Co-producer Clayton Townsend has said that the hardest part was getting the permission to restore the building to the way it looked back in 1963. It took five months of negotiation.|$|E
5|$|There {{was some}} {{controversy}} surrounding Roy Oswalt's nomination because <b>he</b> <b>only</b> <b>had</b> a 7–5 record {{at the time}} of nominations making him the only pitcher without eight wins nominated. However, he is {{considered by many to be}} the victim of lack of run support, questionable relief pitching and an average defense. This respect was shown by the players who had voted him to sixth place among National League starting pitchers making him the first alternate in case of injury to any of the five elected All-star starting pitchers. On the final day of All-Star Final Vote voting, it was announced that Oswalt (who was running third in the All-Star Final Vote) would replace John Smoltz who withdrew from All-Star game participation due to injury.|$|E

5|$|In the 2010 NLCS against Philadelphia, Rentería {{reclaimed}} {{a starting}} role {{when he started}} four games (the Giants benched third baseman Pablo Sandoval and shifted Uribe to third base). <b>He</b> <b>only</b> <b>had</b> one hit in the series, but he scored the winning run in the Giants' 3–0 victory in Game 3, and he retained the starting job in the World Series. In Game 2 of the series, against the Texas Rangers, he broke a scoreless tie in the fifth inning when he homered off C. J. Wilson to give the Giants a 1–0 lead. He later added a two-run single {{in the eighth inning}} as the Giants won 9–0. Before Game 5, with the Giants leading the series 3–1, Rentería joked with teammate Andrés Torres {{that he was going to}} hit a home run. In the seventh inning, with runners at second and third, two outs, and no score, Rentería hit a three-run home run off Rangers' pitcher Cliff Lee that won the series for the Giants. The feat made him only the fourth player to have two series-winning hits in history, along with Yogi Berra, Joe DiMaggio, and Lou Gehrig. For his contributions, he was named the 2010 World Series Most Valuable Player, making him the first player from Colombia to achieve this feat. The Giants declined his option on November 5, but Rentería did announce that he planned to play in 2011. The Giants did offer him a one-year, one million dollar contract as a utility player, but Rentería declined.|$|E
5|$|Kan Ek' {{had sent}} emissaries to Mérida in December 1695 to inform Martín de Ursúa that the Itza would peacefully submit to Spanish rule. By mid-January captain García de Paredes had {{advanced}} from B'atkab' to the advance {{portion of the}} Camino Real at Chuntuki. By now <b>he</b> <b>only</b> <b>had</b> 90 soldiers plus labourers and porters, with many of his soldiers deserting as the force advanced towards Lake Petén Itzá; they were further delayed by the necessity of building an oar-powered longboat (or piragua) to cross the San Pedro River. Soon after Avendaño's flight eastward from Nojpetén, a group of 60 Maya warriors entered Chuntuki in full warpaint and bearing weapons; they {{claimed to have been}} sent by Avendaño to collect religious regalia and another friar. This was not the case, and they were almost certainly a scouting party sent by the Kowoj and their Chak'an Itza allies to see what progress the Spanish army was making along the road. They spoke with García and then rapidly departed without taking any of the items that they had supposedly been sent to collect. García despatched two Kejache scouts to the lakeshore to discover Avendaño's whereabouts; at the same time Avendaño's Kejache guides were returning to Chuntuki from Nojpetén with news of Avendaño's flight. The Itzas at the lake handed over an open letter written by Avendaño before his departure from Nojpetén as a token of friendship between the Itza and the Spanish. Friar Juan de San Buenaventura was enthused by the letter and wished to travel on to Nojpetén himself.|$|E
5|$|This was {{followed}} by a low scoring Second Test in Sydney when Australia were 4/77 needing 223 to win on a poor wicket against the lethal pace of Frank Tyson and Brian Statham. The express Tyson was bowling with the help of tailwind and the slips cordon were over 50m behind the bat. Harvey stood firm while Tyson scattered the stumps of his partners, and he farmed the strike ruthlessly, protecting the tailenders and counter-attacking the England fast bowlers, relying on the cut shot and clipping anything on his pads through the leg side. Schoolboys watching the game leaned over the fence to beckon the boundaries towards them. Last man Bill Johnston came in at 9/145 with 78 runs still required, but protected by Harvey <b>he</b> <b>only</b> <b>had</b> to face 16 balls in 40 minutes and they almost produced an unlikely Australian victory. Harvey continued to attack the bowling, and he hooked Tyson over fine leg's head for four. Together, Harvey and Johnston they had added 39 for the last wicket and halved the runs required. At this point, the Australian pair were confident. Harvey and Johnston felt that Tyson was about to run out of energy, and that their prospects would improve when Hutton would have been forced to change bowlers in the near future. However, it was not enough and England won by 38 runs when Johnston gloved a Tyson delivery down the leg side to the wicket-keeper. Harvey had played what many observers thought was the greatest innings of his life, a defiant, unbeaten 92, exactly half of the Australian innings of 184 in which no other batsmen reached 15.|$|E
