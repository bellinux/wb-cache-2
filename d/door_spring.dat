50|$|Changing tactic, Atli {{demands the}} gold as weregild for Sigurd, {{saying that he}} is {{entitled}} to it as Gudrun's husband. Gunnar, however, insists that these words are not his sister's. The lust for the gold is Atli's alone. Högni adds that, as the fighting has already begun, the time for atonement is over. <b>Doors</b> <b>spring</b> open and dozens of Hun warriors charge the Niflungs, who defend themselves until the mead hall is filled with carnage.|$|R
60|$|Surajah ran across. Two spare {{guns were}} {{pushed through the}} loopholes, {{one on each side}} of it. These had not been bored {{straight}} through the wall, but at angles that would enable them to fire at anyone attacking it. Looking along the barrels, each could see one of the group in front, and fired at the same moment. With a yell of rage and surprise, the assailants of the <b>door</b> <b>sprang</b> back and ran down the street.|$|R
60|$|Although {{apprehensive}} that at {{any moment}} the stable door might open, Malcolm still delayed his start, {{as it would be}} fatal were he to set out before the opening of the gates. At last he felt sure that they must be opened to admit the country people coming in with supplies for the market. He had donned his helmet before leaving his cell, and he now quietly opened the stable <b>door,</b> <b>sprang</b> into the saddle, and rode boldly out.|$|R

50|$|All 2011 Theodor Bastard {{worked on}} the new album. They {{recorded}} it in several studios at the same time. British band Fun-Da-Mental, African band The Mighty Zulu Nation, French singer Julien Jacob - {{took part in the}} recording. Many ethnic instruments as udu, mbira, marimba, reco-reco, caxixi, ashiko, and spring drum were used. Fedor Svoloch also used the instruments that he had invented and made of improvised materials, such as coconuts, <b>door</b> <b>springs,</b> empty bottles, and plastic. In February 2012 the album Oikoumene was released. Its name comes from Ecumene - an ancient Greek term for the known world.|$|R
6000|$|This sudden summons in {{the gray}} dawn was {{somewhat}} startling to a three days' nurse like myself, and, as the thundering knock came at our <b>door,</b> I <b>sprang</b> up in my bed, prepared ...|$|R

50|$|Imnaha Springs is a fifteen-minute hike {{from the}} cabin’s front <b>door.</b> The <b>spring</b> covers a {{relatively}} wide area, forming numerous rivulets that flow along a scenic path through yellow monkeyflower and moss before joining {{together to create}} Imnaha Creek.|$|R
60|$|Lady Lyndon {{issued from}} the room in the {{greatest}} flurry. She was dressed in deep weeds, with a veil over her face, and did not recognise the person waiting in the outer apartment. As she went down the stairs, I stepped lightly after her, and as her chairman opened her <b>door,</b> <b>sprang</b> forward, {{and took her hand}} to place her in the vehicle. 'Dearest widow,' said I, 'his Lordship spoke correctly. Console yourself with Eugenio!' She was too frightened even to scream, as her chairman carried her away. She was set down at her house, and you may be sure that I was at the chair-door, as before, to help her out.|$|R
60|$|But {{when she}} heard Susie's key in the <b>door,</b> Margaret <b>sprang</b> to her feet. She stood {{with her back to}} the fireplace, her hands behind her, in the {{attitude}} of a prisoner protesting his innocence. Susie was too much annoyed to observe this agitation.|$|R
60|$|It {{was late}} that night when there came a sudden thumping on the cabin <b>door.</b> All <b>sprang</b> to their feet in alarm, {{and each of the}} men and the boys reached for his firearm, which they were in the habit of having close at hand.|$|R
50|$|Edwin Showell and Sons: Showell and Barnes {{were founded}} in 1790, in Loveday Street. By 1820 they were trading as Edwin Showell and Sons, {{manufacturing}} <b>door</b> <b>springs</b> and architectural brassware. After Edwin died his two sons, Charles and Edwin Alfred ran the company. The {{move to the}} Stirchley Brass Foundry in Charlotte Road took place in c1902. The property included an attractive Elizabethan red brick farmhouse, called Ivy House or Nine Elms into which Charles Showell moved. The factory gradually expanded to include the whole site and the farmhouse, which had fallen into disrepair, was demolished. During World War I they produced 100,000 Enfield oilers for Birmingham Small Arms Company rifles. In 1956 they were taken over by Josiah Parkes and Sons.|$|R
60|$|As he spoke, a loud cry, as if {{of men in}} conflict, {{arose from}} the fiord. Immediately after, the vikings who had not already taken to flight left their places of shelter and dashed into the underwood. The hermit let them go without moving a hand; but Alric, who was {{actuated}} by no merciful principles, suddenly opened the north <b>door,</b> <b>sprang</b> out, and let fly an arrow with so true an aim that it struck one of the Danes between the shoulders. Fortunately for him, the Dane had, {{in accordance with the}} usual custom of the time, hung his shield on his back when he took to flight, so that the shaft rebounded from it and fell harmless to the ground.|$|R

50|$|At 9:45am Goode {{was placed}} still {{strapped}} to the chair on the platform over the drop, the sheriff placed a white hood {{over his head and}} the rope was adjusted around his neck. The sheriff then read the warrant signed by the Governor after which the trap <b>door</b> <b>sprang</b> open and Goode plunged several feet. Twenty-five minutes later, doctors examined the body and pronounced him dead. His body was then turned over to his uncle George Myres who took his body back to his house to prepare for the funeral. Perhaps as a testament to their continued opposition to the death penalty, over one thousand people paraded through the tenement where Goode's body laid, escorting it to the South Burying Ground where it was laid to rest in one of the city's tombs.|$|R

60|$|From {{the shadow}} of the arched <b>door</b> there <b>sprang</b> two rough serving-men, bearded and gruff, great cudgels in their hands, to ask them who they were and what their errand.

60|$|There was no {{time for}} explanations. Through the débris of the <b>door</b> there <b>sprang</b> into the room half-a-dozen of the loiterers from the room below.
