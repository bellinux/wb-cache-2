500|$|Feller {{estimated}} that military service cost {{him at least}} 100 career wins. Based on his exceptional 1941 and 1946 seasons, {{it is likely that}} Feller would have finished his career with more than 300 wins and perhaps 3,800 strikeouts. Feller said [...] "I know in my heart I would have ended up a lot closer to 400than 300if I hadn't spent four seasons in the Navy. But don't take that as a complaint. I'm happy <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>home</b> in one piece." ...|$|E
500|$|In the 2010/2011 season, Jackson {{played for}} Spartak where she {{averaged}} 17.3 {{points per game}} and 8.4 rebounds per game. [...] She left the team in early January 2011 because of an injury, returning to Australia in order to recover. Part of her treatment involved getting an MRI. [...] According to Jackson, she left Russia for Australia because [...] "I couldn't move, the swelling was very obvious and the pain {{was just a little}} bit too painful. That's when <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>home</b> to all these messages and emails from people back in Australia who had seen the scans and said 'you need to come back (to Australia) and start your rehab right away'." ...|$|E
500|$|Lead singer Chester Bennington {{arrived late}} in the {{recording}} process of the album, having been chosen to replace Scott Weiland in the band Stone Temple Pilots, and then proceeded to record High Rise and tour with the band for most of 2013. When he eventually joined the band in the studio, {{he was surprised to}} find the band had reverted to their heavier rock-centric sound. Bennington stated in an interview with Kerrang!: [...] "Mike wrote tons while I was touring with Stone Temple Pilots last year. When <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>home,</b> there was a lot for me to catch up with, and he was playing me things and I was like, 'Dude, this is fucking awesome!' I was really surprised how heavy it was".|$|E

60|$|And when I {{told him}} that the next {{afternoon}} I must leave him; he looked downhearted enough. But I cheered him as well as I could; though needing a little cheering myself; even though <b>I</b> had <b>got</b> <b>home</b> again. But no more about that.|$|R
500|$|The UK {{government}} {{and the international community}} ultimately declared the February 1980 general election free and fair, though many observers attested to widespread political violence and intimidation of voters, particularly by ZANU (which added Patriotic Front to its name to become [...] "ZANU–PF"). British monitors in the ZANU–PF-dominated eastern provinces were strongly critical, reporting [...] "brutal 'disciplinary murders' as examples of the fate awaiting those who failed to conform", name-taking and [...] "claims to the possession of machines which would reveal how individuals had voted". The Commonwealth Observer Group acknowledged that irregularities were occurring but ruled that accounts were exaggerated. After the RF won all 20 white seats, Soames announced late on 4 March 1980 that Mugabe and ZANU–PF had won 57 of the 80 common roll seats, giving them a majority in the new House of Assembly. Mugabe invited Smith to his house that evening and according to Smith treated him [...] "most courteously"; Mugabe expressed joy at inheriting a [...] "wonderful country" [...] with modern infrastructure and a viable economy, outlined plans for gradual reform that Smith found reasonable, and said that he hoped to stay in regular contact. This meeting {{had a profound effect on}} the former Prime Minister. Having denounced Mugabe as an [...] "apostle of Satan" [...] before the election, Smith now publicly endorsed him as [...] "sober and responsible". [...] "If this were a true picture, then there could be hope instead of despair," [...] he recalled in his autobiography. [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>home</b> I said to Janet that I hoped it was not an hallucination." ...|$|E
2500|$|It was me {{who brought}} Poulidor to Mercier where, like Desbats and me, he spent all his career. In a criterium, I saw this unknown who was riding all around us. I {{saw him again}} in the Bol d'Or and I spoke to him. He said he hadn't yet got a team {{but that he was}} in talks. When <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>home,</b> I spoke {{straight}} away to Antonin Magne, who asked me: [...] "You're sure that he rides well?" [...] I said I was and he contacted him and took him on.|$|E
2500|$|... "Smeceno Horo" [...] is a Bulgarian dance, from {{an album}} that Irvine bought in Sofia. [...] "I {{had it in}} my {{rucksack}} for nine months after that before I {{got a chance to}} play it. It was in bits when <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>home</b> but this tune was on it without a scratch". The piece begins in [...] time ( [...] + [...] ) and , then continues in two different [...] rhythms. Irvine would later refer to this recording as [...] "the closest I ever got to melding two traditions together".|$|E

I embraced her & gave her my blessing, but felt greatly agitated. I was not unprepared but did not expect it would come so quick. Of course nothing can be said till Lorne has heard from his Parents." ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{speaking}} {{about how he}} unwound from his experience in Afghanistan, which he described as [...] "an unhealthy environment in many ways", Kemp stated: [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>home</b> I went to the pub for 24 hours and had a good long drink" [...] On returning Kemp said [...] "it's difficult {{to come back and}} see life {{the same as it was}} before going,". [...] "I can honestly say, after Afghanistan, I'll never take anything in my life for granted again." [...] Kemp stated he was most proud of this series, more so than any of his previous work Kemp expressed hope that after the series people would appreciate the soldiers a bit better and see the bravery of the soldiers coping in hard conditions.|$|E
2500|$|Nonetheless, {{the early}} years of their {{relationship}} were difficult, as Wrangler and Whiting struggled with Wrangler's homosexuality. When Wrangler shouted at her in a restaurant that he was gay, Whiting responded, [...] "only around the edges, dear." [...] Wrangler explained in an interview : [...] "When I got with Margaret, I knew I had to change course. She would have my bags packed and sitting outside the door when <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>home</b> at night and things like that. Plus I would go through massive guilt whenever I did go out with a guy and I was with her. So I finally said that's it. I went to her one night and said I'm never going to cheat on you again with anybody. So my sex life became very masturbatory. And I'm good at that-very good at that, in fact.". The couple was married from 1994 until his death.|$|E
60|$|It {{must have}} been half-past five when <b>I</b> <b>got</b> back <b>home.</b> <b>I</b> stepped in; and there sat old Mack {{on the back of}} his neck in his old clothes with his blue socks on the window and the History of Civilisation propped up on his knees.|$|R

2500|$|Bianca and Babe's {{friendship}} {{became popular}} with viewers while both characters were pregnant. The relationship {{was described as}} a [...] "beautiful friendship" [...] by Soap Opera Digest. Within the series, when the two give birth to their children on the same night (Bianca to Miranda and Babe to Little Adam), their bond further endeared them to the audience. Of the birth scenes, actress Eden Riegel, Bianca's portrayer, stated, [...] "I had done so much research. I read books [...] What to Expect When You're Expecting. I watched the TLC series A Baby Story. It felt like I watched hundreds of episodes! As soon as <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>home</b> I'd be watching women give birth on TV." [...] Riegel added that one of her makeup artists was pregnant and invited her to go along to a Lamaze class. She sat in a room [...] "full of pregnant Upper West Siders" [...] and practiced breathing exercises.|$|E
2500|$|The {{spiritual leader}} of the tail section. Director Bong first saw Hurt in The Elephant Man while at middle-school, which made him curious about the actor; for the part of Gilliam he wanted an older actor, though one {{with the ability to}} [...] "exude the {{ambience}} of spirituality." [...] On the character of Gilliam, Hurt said, [...] "He is certainly shadowy, but he is shadowy for a reason. Even though I still am not entirely certain what the reason is," [...] adding, [...] " [...] as far as Gilliam is concerned, he believes in the status quo, but he also sees himself as a true humanitarian. I mean he has literally given his limbs to these people." [...] Hurt stated that the role of Gilliam was physically challenging one at that, because, [...] " [...] the fact that I had one leg strapped behind me, trying to stagger around on those not very easy-to-use crutches. [...] and having {{to make it look like}} as though I'd been doing it for years." [...] He too acknowledged Bong's encouragement of collaboration in allowing the cast and crew to [...] "interpret things as we want, as we see fit" [...] as well as adding pointers to the act. Hurt said of Bong, [...] "I just fell in love with him. He was wonderful. I hadn't seen anything. I hadn't seen Mother or anything, which I immediately did when <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>home.</b> I went, 'Wow, that's the chap I was talking to.' Thank God instinct has left me completely. I adored him then, I adored him ever since." [...] as well as previously adding, [...] "He is quite different but technically, he is as clever as Hitchcock. That's saying something. [...] He is one of the best directors I've worked with. I absolutely adore working with him." ...|$|E

60|$|The {{horror of}} cholera was {{then in the}} land; and we heard in the stage- office that a man lay dead {{of it in the}} hotel overhead.
