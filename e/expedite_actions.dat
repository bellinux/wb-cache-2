30|$|Limitations of the {{proposed}} framework for value-based SCM arise {{from the fact that}} links between SCM and other aspects of VBM, e.g., the impact of SC risk on weighted average cost of capital, are not considered. Furthermore, this framework is not related to various aspects of strategic and operational SCM. A limitation of the simulation model is that processing durations for transportation and production are assumed static. As a consequence, the RLT is independent of uncertainties. Furthermore, the standard deviation of demand is assumed static over time and as a consequence, the determined safety stock levels are slightly imprecise (see [81] for a related empirical analysis). Moreover, <b>expediting</b> <b>actions</b> are not considered. Thus, cost aspects arising from project delays cannot be evaluated.|$|R

40|$|The rapidly {{changing}} marketplace {{together with the}} increasing complexity of contemporary projects makes {{it more likely that}} project activities will have uncertain durations, incurring a generally low probability of on-time delivery. Thus, project control that aims to track the project performance and to expedite relevant activities when necessary has become the main aspect within the scope of project management in order to ensure a successful scheduling outcome. The Critical Chain Scheduling and Buffer Management (CC/BM) has shown to provide a popular approach to build robust project schedules and to offer a valuable control tool for coping with schedule variability. However, the most current buffer management practice faces a problem of neglecting the cost information when taking <b>expediting</b> <b>actions.</b> In view of this defect, we introduce a new control procedure on the basis of CC/BM that evaluates the probability of successful project completion relative to the cost of crashing and that determines when to expedite which activities in a cost-effective manner.

40|$|The {{deactivated}} 233 -S Plutonium Concentration Facility (233 -S Facility) {{is located}} in the 200 Area. The facility has undergone severe degradation due to exposure to extreme weather conditions. A rapid freeze and thaw cycle occurred at the Hanford Site during February 1996, which caused cracking to occur on portions of the building`s roof. This has resulted in significantly infiltration of water into the facility, which provides a pathway for potential release of radioactive material into the environment (air and/or ground). The weather caused several existing cracks in the concrete portions of the structure to lengthen, increasing the potential for failed confinement of the radioactive material in the building. Differential settlement has also occurred, causing portions of the facility to separate from the main building structure thus creating a potential for release of radioactive material t the environment. An <b>expedited</b> removal <b>action</b> is proposed to ensure that a release from the 233 -S Facility does not occur.

40|$|Abstract- Nigeria {{has been}} portrayed in bad light {{due to its}} unimpressive image and {{reputation}} as a corrupt and mismanaged economy often blamed on bad governance and leadership. The paper basically examines the impact and consequences of state weakness on the Nigerian foreign policy reputation. Findings from the paper reveals that Nigeria since inception as a federation has been a fragile and weak nation, Nigerian foreign policy reputation has been greatly affected by some internal factors that have made the country not to secure a remarkable influence and respect in sub-regional, regional and global diplomatic relationship despite its wealth and commitment in assisting other countries, {{the weakness of the}} Nigerian state arises primarily from the incapacity of the state to deliver essential and basic needs to its citizens and the Nigerian state is a victim of high level corruption and bad governance, political instability, ethnic and religious conflicts among others.

40|$|Ten {{subjects}} balanced {{their own}} body or a mechanically equivalent unstable inverted pendulum by hand, through a compliant spring linkage. Their balancing process was always characterized by repeated small reciprocating hand movements. These bias adjustments were an observable sign of intermittent alterations in neural output. On average, the adjustments occurred at intervals of ∼ 400 ms. To generate appropriate stabilizing bias adjustments, sensory information about body or load movement is needed. Subjects used visual, vestibular or proprioceptive sensation alone and in combination {{to perform the}} tasks. We first ask, is the time between adjustments (bias duration) sensory specific? Vision is associated with slow responses. Other senses involved with balance {{are known to be}} faster. Our second question is; does bias duration depend on sensory abundance? An appropriate bias adjustment cannot occur until unplanned motion is unambiguously perceived (a sensory threshold). The addition of more sensory data should therefore <b>expedite</b> <b>action,</b> decreasing the mean bias adjustment duration. Statistical analysis showed that (1) the mean bias adjustment duration was remarkably independent of the sensory modality and (2) the addition of one or two sensory modalities made a small, but significant, decrease in the mean bias adjustment duration. Thus, a threshold effect can alter only a very minor part of the bias duration. The bias adjustment duration in manual balancing must reflect something more than visual sensation and perceptual thresholds; our suggestion {{is that it is a}} common central motor planning process.

40|$|The study {{examined}} the use of electronic information resources and research output by academic staff in private universities in Ogun state, Nigeria. Three private universities were selected out of the nine private universities in Ogun state. These universities are Crescent University, Abeokuta, Babcock University, Ilishan-Remo, and Redeemers’ University, Mowe, all in Ogun State, Nigeria. Purposive sampling method was used to investigate respondents. The instrument used for data collection was structured questionnaire. 225 copies of the questionnaire were administered at Babcock University and 144 were retrieved. 88 at Crescent University and 80 were retrieved, while 215 at the Redeemers’ University and 130 were retrieved. The research looked at the extent with which electronic information resources {{were used in the}} private universities in Ogun State, using the three universities as sample. A total of 528 copies of the questionnaire were distributed to the respondents at the three universities and a valid number of 354 (66 %) questionnaires were retrieved and analyzed. The questionnaire was designed using nominal and likert scales. The study revealed that most of the academic staff from the three private universities knew and used electronic information resources for their research work as shown on Tables 5, 6, 7 and 8. Findings from Tables 8 and 9 indicate that most of respondents from the three private universities have published their articles and presented papers with the use of electronic information resources. The study also revealed on Table 6 that effective use of electronic information resources contribute to the academics’ research output hence 329 (92. 9 %) of the total respondents supported that view. It is imperative to state here that lack of personal computer and erratic power supply among others are major constraints that inhibit use of electronic information resources in the three private universities which invariably affects their research output.

In accordance with the above plasma volume and corpuscle count is restored by the aforesaid infusion to conditions prior to bleeding. Moreover when drop infusion is administered to study clinical adaption, the above characteristics of Glyco-Algin appear more strongly, with 10 drops per kilogram of body weight per minute the lowered blood pressure induced by bleeding begins to ascend from the time of infusion.

Given the size of UCLA's lab researcher population and the decentralized nature of the campus, it became a daunting task to reach out and improve compliance with newly implemented safety policies. The Office of Environment, Health and Safety (EH & S) improved their operations, enhanced overall inspection procedures, and instituted mandatory laboratory safety training of PIs and researchers. A Laboratory Hazard Assessment Tool (LHAT) was implemented to aid in the identification of hazards, track laboratory space and personnel, and guide lab groups in compliance with personal protective equipment (PPE) policies. Laboratory inspections were increased by more than 4 -fold in 2012 as compared to 2007 and now followed a comprehensive checklist to improve reproducibility and thoroughness of the inspection process. To provide better customer service to the research community and <b>expedite</b> corrective <b>actions,</b> all laboratory inspection reports are required to be issued the next business day.

In-addition, there have been a continuous quest by the citizenry for increased allocations to these sectors because of its supposed impact on the poverty index and standard of living. Although this is a compelling reason, but what is worrisome and equally troubling, is that the increasing incidence of poverty and expanding inequality in the Nigerian society have not mitigated, despite the scaling up of funding on the social sectors. Furthermore, the current level of socioeconomic development in Nigeria is not in tandem with the distributive outcome targets set by the 2004 reforms. Thus, understanding the current structure of poverty in Nigeria as well as beneficiaries of public sector spending provides a sound basis for tackling inequality and redesigning the current pro-poor frameworks. However, our analysis is focused on the distributional spread of beneficiaries from services and the counterfactual reciprocity of expenditure benefits rather than measuring the exact value to recipients of government-sponsored services. Our research methodology used the 2004 Nigerian Living Standard Survey; 2010 Harmonized Nigerian Living Standard Survey; Recent Cros-sectional data (2014) in South East Nigeria and secondary sources. Econometric methods (Error Correction Method); Marginal Odds estimation techniques, Concentration Curves and Ordered Logistic Regression were used for our analysis. Statistical and Econometric Software’s (E-Views; SPSS; DAD and STATA) were used for estimations. Econometric results showed misalignments between population dynamics and public sector expenditure on education, health and economic services. The government consumption expenditure was not sensitive to demographic changes. The derived adjustment coefficients of - 1. 38, - 1. 51 and 0. 51 respectively, for education, health and economic services indicate huge gaps in terms of what optimal spending should have been, giving the population dynamics. Our benefit incidence analysis indicates that substantive gains have been made at the primary education and health care level, at the state level for SE Nigeria but there is a gross misapplication of funds at the secondary and tertiary levels of both education and health sectors. Results show that the state governments’ is subsidizing the rich at the levels of both secondary and tertiary for education and health care. In addition, country wide results indicate that apart from public primary education and health care for urban residents, no other level of social service was absolutely progressive in general terms, by gender or by location while the tertiary level of both services were regressive as shown by the 2010 survey results, in comparism to the 2004 survey results. Using the Ordered Logistic Regression, our result inclines to the lifecycle hypothesis which maintains that poverty oscillates depending on the age. At a younger age, it tends to be on the high side and decreases during the middle ages and increases with age. Our results discards the feminization of poverty general framework that women or female headed households are more prone to poverty due principally to low education and lack of opportunity to own assets such as land amongst others. This wasn’t the case for the South East Region of Nigeria. Estimates indicate that education status, health status and access to health facilities affected the category of welfare of head of households and invariable, the entire household. In general, our analysis shows misalignment of social expenditure for various population groups, both at the federal and state levels; making doubtful the realization of basic MDGs. Nigeria has to combine growth policies and assuring that demographics count, with the poor fully participating in economic development. Also, the need for a refocusing in resource allocation taking into cognizance gender dimensions cannot be overemphasized. A general re-allocation of spending going to females and the poorer households would lead to improvement in gender equality and health status of women and children. <b>Expediting</b> <b>actions</b> towards qualitative education will lead directly to an acceleration of many of the other MDGs, especially those focusing on the reduction of poverty and inequality. To attain MDG targets (post 2015) within a shorter period of time, there is the need {{to improve the quality of}} social infrastructure and services. Furthermore, research should be focused on improving knowledge and understanding of what policies, technologies and investments matter for sustained growth in the country. This will create the much needed multiplier effect on other aggregates. The degree to which the poor participate in the growth process and share in its proceeds matter; both in the pace and pattern of growth. It is therefore important to have categorization of the population into economic groups when formulating a developmental framework for poverty reduction programmes. The study recommends sequencing of interventions, strengthening of institutions and other several interrelated areas to attain effectiveness of public sector spending...|$|R

Most of these diseases are manifested through unexpected and non-uniform occurrences and behaviors. It is impractical to keep patients in hospitals, health-care institutions, or even {{at home for}} long periods of time. Monitoring solutions based on smartphones combined with mobile sensors and wireless communication technologies are a potential candidate to support complete mobility-freedom, not only for patients, but also for physicians. However, existing monitoring architectures based on smartphones and modern communication technologies are not suitable to address some challenging issues, such as intensive and big data, resource constraints, data integration, and context awareness in an integrated framework. This manuscript provides a novel mobile-based end-to-end architecture for live monitoring and visualization of life-long diseases. The proposed architecture provides smartness features to cope with continuous monitoring, data explosion, dynamic adaptation, unlimited mobility, and constrained devices resources. The integration of the architecture 2 ̆ 7 s components provides information about diseases 2 ̆ 7 recurrences as soon as they occur to <b>expedite</b> taking necessary <b>actions,</b> and thus prevent severe consequences. Our architecture system is formally model-checked to automatically verify its correctness against designers 2 ̆ 7 desirable properties at design time. Its components are fully implemented as Web services with respect to the SOA architecture to be easy to deploy and integrate, and supported by Cloud infrastructure and services to allow high scalability, availability of processes and data being stored and exchanged. The architecture 2 ̆ 7 s applicability is evaluated through concrete experimental scenarios on monitoring and visualizing states of epileptic diseases. The obtained theoretical and experimental results are very promising and efficiently satisfy the proposed architecture 2 ̆ 7 s objectives, including resource awareness, smart data integration and visualization, cost reduction, and performance guarantee...|$|R
40|$|This {{notice of}} {{construction}} (NOC) requests a categorical approval for construction {{and operation of}} three types of portable/temporary radionuclide airborne emission units (PTRAEUs). These three types are portable ventilation-filter systems (Type I), mobile sample preparation facilities (Type II), and mobile sample screening and analysis facilities (Type 111). Approval of the NOC application is intended to allow construction and operation of {{the three types of}} PTRAEUs without prior project-specific approval. Environmental cleanup efforts on the Hanford Site often require the use of PTRAEUs. The PTRAEUs support site characterization activities, <b>expedited</b> response <b>actions</b> (ERAs), sampling and monitoring activities, and other routine activities. The PTRAEUs operate at various locations around the Hanford Site. Radiation Air Emissions Program, Washington Administrative Code (WAC) 246 - 247, requires that the Washington State Department of Health (WDOH) be notified before construction of any new emission that would release airborne radioactivity. The WDOH also must receive notification before any modification of an existing source. This includes changes in the source term or replacement of emission control equipment that might significantly contribute to the offsite maximum dose from a licensed facility. During site characterization activities, ERAs, sampling and monitoring activities, and other routine activities, the PTRAEUs might require startup immediately. The notification period hampers efforts to complete such activities in an effective and timely manner. Additionally, notification is to be submitted to the WDOH when the PTRAEUs are turned off. The U. S. Department of Energy, Richland Operations Office (DOE-RL) potentially could generate several notifications monthly. The WDOH would be required to review and provide approval on each NOC as well as review the notices of discontinued sources. The WDOH regulation also allows facilities the opportunity to request a single categorical license that identifies limits and conditions of operations for similar multipurpose temporary and or portable emission units. The DOE-RL will submit annually to the WDOH a report summarizing the log books maintained on the individual PTRAEUs that are used during the reporting period. The report will supply information needed to ensure compliance with the condition of operations. The NOC includes a general description of the three types of PTRAEUs, tracking mechanisms, emissions control systems, and radioactivity handling limits (RHLs) for the PTR 4 EUs. The NOC is based on hypothetical data to demonstrate how emission estimates could be calculated. Tracking will be performed and monitoring will be conducted for compliance with both federal and state regulations. Type I units will use a single isotope based on a calculated RHL (source term) to determine emissions, dose, and monitoring requirements. Type I 1 and 111 units will use field data and process knowledge to determine emissions, dose, and monitoring requirements. New PTRAEUs that conform to any of the three types of PTRAEUs described in this application will be added to the next annual report after the units are placed in service. New PTRAEUs, which do not conform to any of the three types of PTRAEUs described in this application, will require approval on an individual basis by the WDOH before startup...|$|R

The plan seeks to ensure that the entire broadband ecosystem - networks, devices, content and applications - is healthy.   Executive Summary Broadband is the great infrastructure challenge of the early 21 st century. Like electricity a century ago, broadband is a foundation for economic growth, job creation, global competitiveness and a better way of life. It is enabling entire new industries and unlocking vast new possibilities for existing ones. It is changing how we educate children, deliver health care, manage energy, ensure public safety, engage government, and access, organize and disseminate knowledge. Fueled primarily by private sector investment and innovation, the American broadband ecosystem has evolved rapidly. The number of Americans who have broadband at home has grown from eight million in 2000 to nearly 200 million last year. Increasingly capable fixed and mobile networks allow Americans to access a growing number of valuable applications through innovative devices. But broadband in America is not all it needs to be. Approximately 100 million Americans do not have broadband at home. Broadband-enabled health information technology (IT) can improve care and lower costs by {{hundreds of billions of dollars}} in the coming decades, yet the United States is behind many advanced countries in the adoption of such technology. Broadband can provide teachers with tools that allow students to learn the same course material in half the time, but there is a dearth of easily accessible digital educational content required for such opportunities. A broadband-enabled Smart Grid could increase energy independence and efficiency, but much of the data required to capture these benefits are inaccessible to consumers, businesses and entrepreneurs. And nearly a decade after 9 / 11, our first responders still lack a nationwide public safety mobile broadband communications network, even though such a network could improve emergency response and homeland security. Fulfilling the Congressional Mandate In early 2009, Congress directed the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to develop a National Broadband Plan to ensure every American has “access to broadband capability. ” Congress also required that this plan include a detailed strategy for achieving affordability and maximizing use of broadband to advance “consumer welfare, civic participation, public safety and homeland security, community development, health care delivery, energy independence and efficiency, education, employee training, private sector investment, entrepreneurial activity, job creation and economic growth, and other national purposes. ” Broadband networks only create value to consumers and businesses when they are used in conjunction with broadband-capable devices to deliver useful applications and content. To fulfill Congress’s mandate, the plan seeks to ensure that the entire broadband ecosystem—networks, devices, content and applications— is healthy. It makes recommendations to the FCC, the Executive Branch, Congress and state and local governments. The Plan Government can influence the broadband ecosystem in four ways: 	Design policies to ensure robust competition and, as a result maximize consumer welfare, innovation and investment. 	Ensure efficient allocation and management of assets government controls or influences, such as spectrum, poles, and rights-of-way, to encourage network upgrades and competitive entry. 	Reform current universal service mechanisms to support deployment of broadband and voice in high-cost areas; and ensure that low-income Americans can afford broadband; and in addition, support efforts to boost adoption and utilization. 	Reform laws, policies, standards and incentives to maximize the benefits of broadband in sectors government influences significantly, such as public education, health care and government operations. 1. Establishing competition policies. Policymakers, including the FCC, have a broad set of tools to protect and encourage competition in the markets that make up the broadband ecosystem: network services, devices, applications and content. The plan contains multiple recommendations that will foster competition across the ecosystem. They include the following: 	Collect, analyze, benchmark and publish detailed, market-by-market information on broadband pricing and competition, which will likely have direct impact on competitive behavior (e. g., through benchmarking of pricing across geographic markets). This will also enable the FCC and other agencies to apply appropriate remedies when competition is lacking in specific geographies or market segments. 	Develop disclosure requirements for broadband service providers to ensure consumers have the pricing and performance information they need to choose the best broadband offers in the market. Increased transparency will incent service providers to compete for customers on the basis of actual performance. 	Undertake a comprehensive review of wholesale competition rules to help ensure competition in fixed and mobile broadband services. 	Free up and allocate additional spectrum for unlicensed use, fostering ongoing innovation and competitive entry. 	Update rules for wireless backhaul spectrum to increase capacity in urban areas and range in rural areas. 	<b>Expedite</b> <b>action</b> on data roaming to determine how best to achieve wide, seamless and competitive coverage, encourage mobile broadband providers to construct and build networks, and promote entry and competition. 	Change rules to ensure a competitive and innovative video set-top box market, to be consistent with Section 629 of the Telecommunications Act. The Act says that the FCC should ensure that its rules achieve a competitive market in video “navigation devices,” or set-top boxes—the devices consumers use to access much of the video they watch today. 	Clarify the Congressional mandate allowing state and local entities to provide broadband in their communities and do so in ways that use public resources more effectively. 	Clarify the relationship between users and their online profiles to enable continued innovation and competition in applications and ensure consumer privacy, including the obligations of firms collecting personal information to allow consumers to know what information is being collected, consent to such collection, correct it if necessary, and control disclosure of such personal information to third parties. 2. Ensuring efficient allocation and use of government-owned and government-influenced assets. Government establishes policies for the use of spectrum and oversees access to poles, conduits, rooftops and rights-of-way, which are used in the deployment of broadband networks. Government also finances a large number of infrastructure projects. Ensuring these assets and resources are allocated and managed efficiently can encourage deployment of broadband infrastructure and lower barriers to competitive entry. The plan contains a number of recommendations to accomplish these goals. They include the following: 	Spectrum is a major input for providers of broadband service. Currently, the FCC has only 50 megahertz in inventory, just a fraction of the amount that will be necessary to match growing demand. More efficient allocation and assignment of spectrum will reduce deployment costs, drive investment and benefit consumers through better performance and lower prices. The recommendations on spectrum policy include the following: 	 		Make 500 megahertz of spectrum newly available for broadband within 10 years, of which 300 megahertz should be made available for mobile use within five years. 		Enable incentives and mechanisms to repurpose spectrum to more flexible uses. Mechanisms include incentive auctions, which allow auction proceeds to be shared in an equitable manner with current licensees as market demands change. These would benefit both spectrum holders and the American public. The public could benefit from additional spectrum for high-demand uses and from new auction revenues. Incumbents, meanwhile, could recognize a portion of the value of enabling new uses of spectrum. For example, this would allow the FCC to share auction proceeds with broadcasters who voluntarily agree to use technology to continue traditional broadcast services with less spectrum. 		Ensure greater transparency of spectrum allocation, assignment and use through an FCC-created spectrum dashboard to foster an efficient secondary market. 		Expand opportunities for innovative spectrum access models by creating new avenues for opportunistic and unlicensed use of spectrum and increasing research into new spectrum technologies. 	 	 	Infrastructure such as poles, conduits, rooftops and rights-of-way play an important role in the economics of broadband networks. Ensuring service providers can access these resources efficiently and at fair prices can drive upgrades and facilitate competitive entry. In addition, testbeds can drive innovation of next-generation applications and, ultimately, may promote infrastructure deployment. Recommendations to optimize infrastructure use include: 	 		Establish low and more uniform rental rates for access to poles, and simplify and expedite the process for service providers to attach facilities to poles. 		Improve rights-of-way management for cost and time savings, promote use of federal facilities for broadband, expedite resolution of disputes and identify and establish “best practices” guidelines for rights-of-way policies and fee practices that are consistent with broadband deployment. 		Facilitate efficient new infrastructure construction, including through “dig-once” policies that would make federal financing of highway, road and bridge projects contingent on states and localities allowing joint deployment of broadband|$|R
