5|$|Attempts {{to generalize}} {{ordinary}} quantum field theories, used <b>in</b> <b>elementary</b> particle physics to describe fundamental interactions, {{so as to}} include gravity have led to serious problems. Some have argued that at low energies, this approach proves successful, in that it results in an acceptable effective (quantum) field theory of gravity. At very high energies, however, the perturbative results are badly divergent and lead to models devoid of predictive power ("perturbative non-renormalizability").|$|E
5|$|Energy and {{momentum}} are conserved {{only on the}} average in interactions between matter and radiation, but not <b>in</b> <b>elementary</b> processes such as absorption and emission.
