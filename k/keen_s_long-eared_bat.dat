50|$|The Alpine <b>long-eared</b> <b>bat</b> or {{mountain}} <b>long-eared</b> <b>bat</b> (Plecotus macrobullaris) is {{a species}} of <b>long-eared</b> <b>bat.</b> It was originally described from Switzerland and Austria as a species intermediate between the brown <b>long-eared</b> <b>bat</b> and the grey <b>long-eared</b> <b>bat</b> in 1965. It was later described in 2001 and 2002, from France and Austria, respectively. Despite its name, this species is not restricted to the Alps, being found in Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and elsewhere. It differs from other European <b>long-eared</b> <b>bats,</b> such as the brown <b>long-eared</b> <b>bat,</b> by its white underparts.|$|R

40|$|This study {{presents}} {{the findings of}} a field study examining roost tree selection and roosting ranges of the northern <b>long-eared</b> <b>bat</b> (Myotis septentrionalis) in an experimental ecosystem of two southern Indiana state forests comprised of differing timber harvesting treatments. The northern <b>long-eared</b> <b>bat</b> is anticipated {{to be added to the}} Endangered Species list in the fall of 2014, so understanding its habitat selection is important to aid in minimizing their population decline. Northern <b>long-eared</b> <b>bats</b> were captured in Morgan-Monroe and Yellowwood state forests, and females were fitted with transmitters. We tracked these bats to their maternity roost trees during the day, and measured vegetation characteristics around those trees. Roost tree locations were plotted in ArcMap (ArcGIS 10. 2) to find roosting ranges, and the roosting range size for this species was found to average 5. 4 ha. Bats roosted in the unharvested forest more often than in trees within the harvested areas, and selected areas containing more vegetation obstruction, or clutter, in both areas. However, northern <b>long-eared</b> <b>bats</b> are roost generalists when compared to other species for many vegetative characteristics, and may tolerate smaller forest harvests as long as adequate roost trees remain available on the landscape.

50|$|It hunts above woodland, {{often by}} day, and mostly for moths, {{gleaning}} insects from leaves and bark. Prey is probably detected by {{sight and sound}} using the large eyes and ears, not by echolocation. A study by Ekl√∂f and Jones (2003) demonstrated {{the ability of the}} brown <b>long-eared</b> <b>bat</b> to visually detect prey. Under experimental conditions, brown <b>long-eared</b> <b>bats</b> showed a preference for situations where sonar and visual cues were available. However, visual cues were more important that sonar cues and the bats were unable to detect prey items using only sonar cues. Brown <b>long-eared</b> <b>bats</b> have relatively large eyes and ears and it is likely that visual information and passive listening allow this species to detect prey in cluttered environments.|$|R
