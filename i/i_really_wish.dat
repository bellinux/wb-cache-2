500|$|During 1940, Friedman was {{appointed}} {{an assistant professor}} teaching Economics at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, but encountered antisemitism in the Economics department and {{decided to return to}} government service. From 1941 to 1943 Friedman worked on wartime tax policy for the federal government, as an advisor to senior officials of the United States Department of the Treasury. As a Treasury spokesman during 1942 he advocated a Keynesian policy of taxation. He helped to invent the payroll withholding tax system, since the federal government badly needed money in order to fight the war. He later said, [...] "I have no apologies for it, but <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>wish</b> we hadn't found it necessary and I wish there were some way of abolishing withholding now." ...|$|E
500|$|The song's {{music video}} was shot from May 23 to 24, 2008 on Hollywood Boulevard in Los Angeles, with {{director}} Joseph Khan. American recording artist Britney Spears filmed a cameo appearance for the video on June 4 at the Warner Bros. lot in Los Angeles. An on set [...] "insider" [...] said that Spears' scene was short, only consisting of her driving in a passing car and waving {{to the other}} girls. On June 12, 2008 it was announced by MTV News that the cameo had been cut from the final video. Scherzinger was asked why Spears got cut from the video. She said: [...] "I honestly am not so sure. You shoot {{a lot of things}} when you do a video. Some things stay in but other things don't make the cut and Britney just didn't make it. I've seen a little clip of her performance and she looked adorable so <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>wish</b> she was in it! Hopefully we'll work together in the future." [...] A short clip of the music video was released online on June 12, 2008; a day before the video's premiere on June 13, 2008 on FNMTV.|$|E
2500|$|In {{terms of}} pure keeping ability, Berry was rated {{extremely}} highly, particularly his ability [...] "keeping up" [...] both to leg-spinner Shane Warne and to medium (and even fast-medium) paced bowlers. Warne, his Victorian teammate, said that [...] "Darren Berry {{up to the}} stumps has probably been the best keeper that I've {{ever seen in my}} time... <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>wish</b> he did get the opportunity to show how good a keeper he was, with a baggy green cap playing for Australia." [...] Berry has often talked about his leg-side stumping off the bowling of paceman Paul Reiffel as one of his best achievements.|$|E

2500|$|Allen {{was said}} to be {{sensitive}} about having one green eye and one blue eye (heterochromia), and some speculation existed that plans to film the eighth season of The Burns & Allen Show in color prompted her retirement. However, this seems unlikely, since a one-time-only color episode was filmed and broadcast in 1954 (a clip of which was seen on a CBS anniversary show). The reason she retired in 1958 was her health; George Burns noted more than once that she stayed with the television show as long as she did to please him, in spite of her health problems. In later years, Burns admitted that he had a very brief affair. Stricken by guilt, he phoned Jack Benny and told him about the indiscretion. However, Allen overheard the conversation and Burns quietly bought an expensive centerpiece. Nothing more was said. Years later, he discovered that Allen had subsequently told one of her friends about the episode, finishing with, [...] "You know, <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>wish</b> George would cheat on me again. I could use a new centerpiece." ...|$|E
2500|$|Maroney and Wieber were {{credited}} {{for changing}} the team's nickname from the [...] "Fab Five" [...] to the [...] "Fierce Five" [...] {{a few days before}} their gold medal win at the Olympics. [...] "I guess (Fab Five) was taken by some basketball team or something," [...] Maroney said, referring to the five members of the Michigan college basketball team recruited in 1991. Jalen Rose, a former Michigan Fab Five member, complained about the gymnastics team being dubbed the Fab Five as well. [...] "To use the nickname just points and screams of lazy journalism by the national media, that's really what it is," [...] Rose said. [...] "It's no fault at all of the young gymnasts. But <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>wish</b> they would have come up with an even more creative tag for them and their gold medal pursuit." [...] Maroney and Wieber decided for that reason to [...] "come up with an even more creative" [...] name while on the bus to a training session. They reportedly started searching on their phones for words that started with F that described the team. The top choices were feisty and fierce. Maroney and Wieber opted for [...] "fierce", as they said it described their floor routines, {{and the rest of the}} team concurred. Maroney also stated, [...] "There have been Fab Fives in the past but I like Fierce Five because we are definitely the fiercest team out there." ...|$|E

2500|$|Massachusetts {{governor}} Francis Bernard {{believed that}} his colony’s {{delegates to the}} Congress would be supportive of Parliament. [...] Timothy Ruggles in particular was Bernard's man, and was elected chairman of the Congress. [...] Ruggles' instructions from Bernard were to [...] "recommend submission to the Stamp Act until Parliament could be persuaded to repeal it." [...] Many delegates felt that a final resolution of the Stamp Act would actually bring Britain and the colonies closer together. Robert Livingston of New York {{stressed the importance of}} removing the Stamp Act from the public debate, writing to his colony's [...] agent in England, [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>wished</b> to see America in a state of independence I should desire {{as one of the most}} effectual means to that end that the stamp act should be enforced." ...|$|R

5000|$|The formal {{sessions}} of the Stamp Act Congress were conducted behind closed doors, {{although some of}} its business may have been conducted in informal sessions held in coffeehouses and other establishments in the evenings. Lieutenant Governor Colden, unable to prevent the meeting, called it an [...] "illegal convention", noting that [...] "whatever possible pretences {{may be used for}} this meeting their real intentions may be dangerous." [...] The delegates were clear that they were in fact loyal to the Crown. New York delegate Robert R. Livingston wrote that the Congress was designed to insure the unity of the British empire, for [...] "if <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>wished</b> to see America in a state of independence, I should desire {{as one of the most}} effectual means to that end that the stamp act should be inforced." ...|$|R

60|$|But {{a letter}} {{dropped from the}} parcel on the floor, which {{attracted}} my eye, and explained the riddle. A client of Mr. Fairscribe's, a moneyed man, thought of buying Glentanner, merely as an investment of money--it was even unlikely he would ever see it; and so {{the price of the}} whole being some thousand pounds beyond what cash he had on hand, this accommodating Dives would gladly take a partner in the sale for any detached farm, and would make no objection to its including the most desirable part of the estate in point of beauty, provided the price was made adequate. Mr. Fairscribe would take care I was not imposed on in the matter, and said in his card he believed, if <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>wished</b> to make such a purchase, I had better go out and look at the premises, advising me, at the same time, to keep a strict incognito--an advice somewhat superfluous, since I am naturally of a retired and reserved disposition.|$|R
