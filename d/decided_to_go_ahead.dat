5|$|The fourteenth {{stage was}} memorable for its extreme weather, most notably {{on the final}} climb of the Gavia Pass.

Despite the cold and adverse weather forecast, the patron, Vincenzo Torriani, <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>ahead</b> with the stage.

Although Breukink won the stage, Hampsten made the bigger story by becoming the first American to don the maglia rosa in the history of the Giro d'Italia.|$|E

50|$|Be alert if your {{opponent}} drops a 2 or a 10, or tries to build combinations adding to 10 - {{your opponent}} {{may be trying}} to fish them out with the 2 of clubs or the 10 of diamonds. If you cannot fish these cards out yourself, you may want to collect other cards that will force your opponent to leave you with a bastra opportunity if your opponent <b>decides</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>ahead</b> and collect the point card. For example, let's say your opponent plays the 10 of hearts and the board now shows 3, 8 and 10. If you had an 8, {{it would be wise to}} fish out the 8, that way, if your opponent did indeed have the 10 of diamonds, this would leave you a potential bastra with the 3 should your opponent <b>decide</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>ahead</b> and fish out the 10. You could also solve this problem by clearing the board with a jack. In the same vein, try to avoid playing combinations that add up to 10, if the 10 of diamonds remains to be played.|$|R

Lacking in emotional intelligence, he says insensitive things, such as telling a friend to just [...] "pull the plug" [...] on her comatose mother, and his acting for the Chekhov play lacks believability.

The new hull was judged to have more potential for stealth and reductions in manning than the Burkes. This was important, as one aim {{of the program was}} to reduce manning and operational costs by 70%, while providing scope for a follow-on cruiser class. On 4 July 2000 it was announced that the lead ship of the class would be named after Admiral Elmo Zumwalt, who had died earlier that year. The name would be inherited by subsequent versions of the design, culminating in USS Zumwalt.|$|E

This would carry coal to Cromford, which was becoming industrialised, and limestone from the area for the growing iron industry. Also important would be lead from Wirksworth and cotton from the Cromford mills. The connection to the Erewash Canal would provide an outlet to the Trent and Mersey Canal and the rest of the country.|$|E

25|$|Colombia was {{originally}} chosen as hosts by FIFA in June 1974. However, the Colombian authorities eventually declared in November 1982 {{that they could}} not afford to host the World Cup under the terms that FIFA demanded because of economic concerns. Mexico was selected on 20 May 1983 as the replacement hosts, beating the bids of Canada and the United States (who eventually hosted the 1994 World Cup), and thereby became the first nation to host two World Cups. This second World Cup in Mexico came 16 years after the first one in 1970. A severe earthquake in September 1985, eight months before the tournament, cast doubt over Mexico's ability to organize the event, but the stadia were not affected and it was <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>ahead</b> with the preparations.|$|E
25|$|In 1971, BCA President S. K. Wankhede {{was told}} by the then CCI President, Vijay Merchant that the BCA would not be allotted any extra seats for the visit of England in 1972. CCI {{maintained}} that it spends a large amount in maintaining the ground and any further concessions would lead to substantial loss of revenue to the club. BCA <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>ahead</b> and construct a new ground of its own. The new Wankhede Stadium hosted its first Test match early in 1975 during the tour of West Indies. Wankhede had superseded Brabourne as the city's international cricket venue.

The second featured Australian hopeful Lleyton Hewitt, who defeated Marcos Baghdatis 4–6, 7–5, 7–5, 6–7, 6–3 in a match that provoked discussion {{about the validity of}} night matches; the players did not finish play until 04:34, 282minutes since it started at 11:52. Significantly, the match extended further into the evening than any other {{in the history of the}} Australian Open. The Federer-Tipsarević match, which lasted 267minutes, overlapped into the night session and this delayed the commencement of the women's singles match between Venus Williams and Sania Mirza until 10:00. Rules had previously been put in place so that a men's singles match would not start if other matches had played past 11:00; however, with the home crowd growing anxious, the organizers <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>ahead</b> with the Hewitt vs. Baghdatis match.|$|E
