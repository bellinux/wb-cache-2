5|$|The {{industry}} expanded {{rapidly in}} the 1940s because World WarII created a huge demand for inexpensive, mass-produced products. In 1946, American inventor James Watson Hendry built the first screw <b>injection</b> <b>machine,</b> which allowed much more precise control over the speed of injection {{and the quality of}} articles produced. This machine also allowed material to be mixed before injection, so that coloured or recycled plastic could be added to virgin material and mixed thoroughly before being injected. Today, screw injection machines account {{for the vast majority of}} all injection machines. In the 1970s, Hendry went on to develop the first gas-assisted injection moulding process, which permitted the production of complex, hollow articles that cooled quickly. This greatly improved design flexibility as well as the strength and finish of manufactured parts while reducing production time, cost, weight and waste.|$|E
5|$|More than 1,000 {{shots of}} Wolverine have visual effects in them, which {{required}} three effects supervisors and seventeen different companies {{to work on}} the film. The most prominent was Hydraulx, who had also worked in the X-Men trilogy and was responsible for the battle in Three Mile Island and Gambit's powers. Many elements were totally generated through computer-generated imagery, such as the adamantium <b>injection</b> <b>machine,</b> the scene with Gambit's plane and Wolverine tearing through a door with his newly enhanced claws. CG bone claws were also created for some scenes because the props did not look good in close-ups. Extensive usage of matte paintings was also made, with Matte World Digital creating five different mattes for the final scene of the film—a pullback depicting the destroyed Three Mile Island—and Gavin Hood handing company Hatch Productions pictures of favelas as reference for the Africa scenes.|$|E
25|$|Delaware and Missouri use {{a lethal}} <b>injection</b> <b>machine</b> {{designed}} by Massachusetts-based Fred A. Leuchter {{consisting of two}} components: the delivery module and the control module. Two staff members each have a station in which they key on the machine and depress two stations' buttons to be ready in case of mechanical failure. Each person presses one station button on the console which travels to a computer which starts all three injections electronically. The computer then deletes who actually started the syringes, so the participants are not aware if their syringe contained saline {{or one of the}} drugs necessary for execution (to assuage guilt {{in a manner similar to}} the blank cartridge in execution by firing squad). The delivery module has eight syringes. The end syringes (i.e., syringes 7 and 8) containing saline, syringes 2, 4 and 6 containing the lethal drugs for the main line and syringes 1, 3 and 5 containing the injections for the back-up line. The system was used in New Jersey before the abolition of the death penalty in 2007. Illinois previously used the computer, and Missouri and Delaware use the manual injection switch on the delivery panel.|$|E

50|$|Fordham University law {{professor}} Deborah Denno, {{a death penalty}} expert, said that descriptions of the execution {{seem to suggest that}} there were several failures in injecting the drugs.

During this time Steckel was still lucid and continued to make several comments to his family members and friends who witnessed the execution. She said it appears that the sedative and paralytic drugs failed to take effect as Steckel was seen to convulse. Delaware Department of Correction spokeswoman Beth Welch said that nothing went wrong with the execution and the length of time was just due to the Warden giving Brian Steckel more time for his statement.|$|E

50|$|Improvement Services Ltd claimed money {{under an}} {{insurance}} policy covering damage by fire to their building from their insurers, Cornhill Insurance plc (now part of Allianz after a takeover in 1986). £65000 was paid out already under the insurance policy.

Straight away Cornhill Insurance claimed that Improvement Services was engaged in frivolous, vexatious litigation and applied for an injunction to restrain the winding up petition. It brought to the court its accounts, showing how much money it had. It was granted an interim injunction, but the matter still needed to be given a full hearing on continuing the injunction.|$|E
50|$|The {{intravenous}} tubing {{leads to}} a room next to the execution chamber, usually separated from the condemned by a curtain or wall. Typically, a prison employee trained in venipuncture inserts the needle, while a second prison employee orders, prepares, and loads the drugs into the lethal injection syringes. Two other staff members take {{each of the three}} syringes and secure them into the IVs. After the curtain is opened to allow the witnesses to see inside the chamber, the condemned person is then permitted to make a final statement. Following this, the warden signals that the execution may commence, and the executioner(s) (either prison staff or private citizens depending on the jurisdiction) then manually inject the three drugs in sequence. During the execution, the condemned's cardiac rhythm is monitored. Death is pronounced after cardiac activity stops. Death usually occurs within seven minutes, although the whole procedure can take up to two hours, {{as was the case with}} the execution of Christopher Newton on May 24, 2007. According to state law, if a physician's participation in the execution is prohibited for reasons of medical ethics, then the death ruling can be made by the state medical examiner's office. After confirmation that death has occurred, a coroner signs the condemned's death certificate.Delaware and Missouri use a lethal <b>injection</b> <b>machine</b> designed by Massachusetts-based Fred A.

40|$|Injection Molding is {{a common}} method of plastic {{processing}} in which thermoplastic materials can be molded into arbitrary complex shapes. Most <b>injection</b> molding <b>machines</b> use complicated hydraulic systems to perform the necessary work of the process. Hydraulic system flow and pressure requirements vary throughout the cycle and in many cases, excess fluid that is not required by the process is throttled back to the reservoir, wasting motor energy and producing additional thermal load on the cooling system. Variable speed drives {{can be used to}} allow <b>injection</b> molding <b>machine</b> hydraulic systems to vary the amount of fluid being pumped and thus reduce the amount of fluid that is throttled, reducing the amount of wasted energy.
