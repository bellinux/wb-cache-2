40|$|The {{current study}} investigates {{instructional}} design {{factors that can}} be manipulated to <b>enhance</b> learner <b>motivation.</b> A goal-based approach to <b>enhancing</b> <b>motivation</b> <b>is</b> discussed, along with current theory concerning the goal orientation an individual learner brings to an instructional situation. The efficacy of Prospect Theory as a cognitive mechanism underlying the valuation of effort toward a goal is discussed, and an experiment is presented in which goal messaging is manipulated based on the predictions of Prospect Theory as well as Goal Setting Theory. A Web-based tutorial consisting of ten sections of text, each with a recall test, was used. An ability goal orientation was found to impact section quiz scores. Both goal message framing and goal difficulty level were found to interact with an ability goal orientation to impact performance on section quizzes. A learning goal orientation was found to interact with goal difficulty to impact section quiz scores. The author concludes that while the study supports the use of goal messaging to <b>enhance</b> <b>motivation,</b> such manipulations by educators must be made {{in light of the}} goal orientations a learner brings to the instructional setting...|$|R

40|$|Problem {{alcohol use}} has {{far-reaching}} economic, intra-, and interpersonal consequences. One particularly hazardous form of drinking {{pertains to the}} consumption of alcohol {{as a means of}} regulating stress, or drinking to cope. As such, it is critical to identify pathways through which stress-related alcohol use occurs, as well as protective factors which may mitigate the aforementioned consequences. To achieve this, I conducted three studies examining these topics at multiple levels of analysis among two at risk populations for engaging in problematic drinking: College students and military service members. Study 1 is a published manuscript examining the association between personality, a known vulnerability factor, and daily alcohol use among college students. This study tested whether these associations were mediated by the utilization of daily coping behaviors. Study 2 is an exploration of the association between of post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) and alcohol involvement among employed service members. I conducted conditional process analysis to determine whether the indirect association of PTSS on alcohol involvement through coping <b>motivations</b> <b>was</b> <b>conditional</b> on one 2 ̆ 7 s perceived level of social support. Finally, Study 3 examined how daily experiences of occupational stressors influence alcohol consumption using a subsample of married and cohabiting participants from Study 2.

In this trial {{we sought to}} reduce attrition and improve outcomes by augmenting a well-known evidence-based intervention, Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT), with a 3 -session individual motivational enhancement component. Participants were 192 Australian caregivers (91. 7 % female; Mage = 34. 4 years) and their children (33. 3 % female; Mage = 4. 4 years). Families (51 % referred from child welfare or health services for risk of maltreatment) were assigned to PCIT or a supported waitlist, with families assigned to PCIT receiving either standard PCIT (S/PCIT) or motivation-enhanced PCIT (M/PCIT), depending on their time of entry to the study. Waitlist families received phone calls every week for 12 weeks. Parents in M/PCIT reported more readiness to change their behavior from preassessment to after the motivation sessions. Also, parents who reported high, rather than low, motivation at preassessment did have a lower attrition rate, {{and there was some}} evidence that <b>enhancing</b> <b>motivation</b> <b>was</b> protective of premature attrition to the extent that caregivers achieved a high degree of change in motivation. Yet comparison of attrition rates and survival analyses revealed no difference between M/PCIT and S/PCIT in retention rate.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of the present study}} were to investigate changes in learning motivation before and after pre-entrance assignments for 14 students admitted on recommendation to nursing school A, and to compare the obtained data to those for 33 students who entered through general admissions. A survey was conducted using an originally developed 15 -item questionnaire. The results for students admitted on recommendation showed a reduction in learning motivation for one item (related to knowledge acquisition through reading) immediately after pre-entrance assignments compared to before the assignments; however, no significant differences were observed before and after assignments for other items. Compared to general admission students, those admitted on recommendation tended to have higher motivation for five items (related to human psychology and communication skills) immediately after the assignments; no significant differences were observed for other items. The findings suggest that while pre-entrance assignments do not increase learning motivation, they may help to maintain motivation. Because the learning motivation of students admitted on recommendation for items related to human interactions increased after pre-entrance assignments, the capability of modified pre-entrance assignments to further <b>enhance</b> <b>motivation</b> should <b>be</b> investigated. 本研究では、A大学看護学科における推薦入学者 14 名を対象として、入学前課題学習前後の学習への動機づけの変化、および一般入学者 33 名との比較を明らかにすることを目的とした。研究者らが独自に作成した 15 項目からなる質問紙を用いて調査した。その結果、推薦入学者では読書による知識獲得に関する 1 項目が入学前課題学習前に比べて学習直後には低下していたが、その他の項目では学習前後で有意差はなかった。一般入学者との比較では人の心理やコミュニケーション能力に関する 5 項目で推薦入学者が入学前課題学習直後に高い傾向にあったが、その他の項目では有意差はなかった。入学前課題学習には学習への動機づけを向上させる効果はないものの、学習への動機づけを維持する作用が推測された。推薦入学者は入学前課題学習前より人とのかかわりに関する学習への動機づけが高いものと推測され、それを強化できるような課題への変更を検討する必要性が示唆され...|$|R

Currently, in North America, {{it is becoming increasingly}} difficult to achieve a high standard of living and receive quality employment without some level of post-secondary education (Anisef & Sweet, 2005). Therefore, how academically motivated a student is {{at the high school level}} may significantly impact their future employment and career options. For the purpose of the present study, parental involvement levels in both student academics and extracurricular were examined as possible variables impacting level of student academic motivation. 124 grade 11 and 12 public high school participants completed a series of questionnaires which were designed to measure level of parental involvement in academics, parental involvement in extracurricular, and level of student academic involvement. Categories of highly-involved, moderately-involved, and minimally-involved parenting were determined based on participant scores from the questionnaires. Analysis revealed that increased student academic <b>motivation</b> scores <b>were</b> significantly associated with increased levels of parental involvement. Hierarchical multiple regression analysis also revealed that parental academic <b>motivation</b> <b>was</b> a significant predictor of student academic motivation over and above what was accounted for by demographic information (i. e. time spent on homework, grade average, gender).

Furthermore, to determine the motivational drive of socio-demographic and job related factors in terms of improving work performance. Methods A previously developed and validated instrument addressing four work-related motivators (job attributes, remuneration, co-workers and achievements) was used. Two categories of health care professionals, medical doctors and dentists (N = 67) and nurses (N = 219) participated and motivation and job satisfaction was compared across socio-demographic and occupational variables. Results The survey revealed that achievements was ranked first among the four main motivators, followed by remuneration, co-workers and job attributes. The factor remuneration revealed statistically significant differences according to gender, and hospital sector, with female doctors and nurses and accident and emergency (A+E) outpatient doctors reporting greater mean scores (p 55 years of age reported higher job satisfaction when compared to the other groups. Conclusions The results are in agreement with the literature which focuses attention to management approaches employing both monetary and non-monetary incentives to motivate health care professionals. Health care professionals tend to be motivated more by intrinsic factors, implying that this should be a target for effective employee motivation.

Technology-based treatment aids and modalities (e. g., interactive CDs, virtual reality exposure, and single-session treatment) offer the potential benefit of promoting active child engagement, an essential goal of CBT, but they also challenge traditional notions of the therapeutic relationship. Conceptual definitions and methodological considerations for assessing the alliance in child anxiety treatment are discussed. A review of technology, outcome, {{and its effect on}} process follows, concluding with a recommendation that further alliance research is necessary and that advanced technologies provide an opportunity to understand the treatment process further...|$|R
40|$|We {{conduct an}} explorative study to {{investigate}} the effect of subjectivity in performance evaluation practices on managerial motivation in public sector organisations. Increased subjectivity can <b>enhance</b> <b>motivation</b> if supervisors <b>are</b> able to provide better informational feedback. However, subjectivity is likely to reduce motivation if it reduces perceived mission clarity or negatively affects relations between supervisors and subordinates. Our analysis {{is based on a}} survey among 94 public sector managers in the Netherlands. We predict and find that subjectivity in performance evaluation practices reduces perceived mission clarity, which in turn decreases motivation. We also find that subjectivity negatively affects subordinate managers trust in their supervisor, which also reduces motivation. Jointly, these results indicate that the negative effects of subjectivity in performance evaluation practices outweigh its potential positive consequences, suggesting that New Public Management's focus on more objective performance measures can indeed be beneficial. By itself, however, this does not automatically imply that more objective systems in general are optimal in all public sector organisations as such systems may have dysfunctional side effects such as distortion of performance measures, gaming or manipulation. In addition, we find that the effects of subjectivity are moderated by organisational characteristics...|$|R
