40|$|Examination of {{fluorinated}} ethylene propylene (FEP) copolymer specimens {{recovered from}} the Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF) provides evidence for degradation attributed to extended solar vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) irradiation. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of sheared FEP film edges reveal {{the presence of a}} highly <b>embrittled</b> <b>layer</b> on the exposed surface of specimens obtained from the trailing edge of the LDEF. Similar images obtained for leading edge and control FEP films do not exhibit evidence for such an <b>embrittled</b> <b>layer.</b> Laboratory VUV irradiation of FEP films is found to produce a damage layer similar to that witnessed in the LDEF trailing edge films. Spectroscopic analyses of irradiated films provide data to advance a photochemical mechanism for degradation...|$|E
40|$|Bellows-type thermal shields {{were used}} on the bi-stems of {{replacement}} solar arrays installed on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) during the first HST servicing mission (SMI) in December 1993. These thermal shields helped reduce the problem of thermal gradient- induced jitter observed with the original HST solar arrays during orbital thermal cycling and have been in use on HST for eight years. This paper describes ground testing of the candidate solar array bi-stem thermal shield materials including backside aluminized Teflon(R) FEP (fluorinated ethylene propylene) with and without atomic oxygen (AO) and ultraviolet radiation protective surface coatings for durability to AO and combined AO and vacuum ultraviolet (VOV) radiation. NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC) conducted VUV and AO exposures of samples of candidate thermal shield materials at HST operational temperatures and pre- and post-exposure analyses {{as part of an}} overall program coordinated by NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) to determine the on-orbit durability of these materials. Coating adhesion problems were observed for samples having the AO- and combined AO/UV-protective coatings. Coating lamination occurred with rapid thermal cycling testing which simulated orbital thermal cycling. This lack of adhesion caused production of coating flakes from the material that would have posed a serious risk to HST optics if the coated materials were used for the bi-stem thermal shields. No serious degradation was observed for the uncoated aluminized Teflon(R) as evaluated by optical microscopy, although atomic force microscopy (AFM) microhardness testing revealed that an embrittled surface layer formed on the uncoated Teflon(R) surface due to vacuum ultraviolet radiation exposure. This <b>embrittled</b> <b>layer</b> was not completely removed by AO erosion, No cracks or particle flakes were produced for the embrittled uncoated material upon exposure to VUV and AO at operational temperatures to an equivalent exposure of approximately five years in the HST environment. Uncoated aluminized FEP Teflon(R) was determined to be the most appropriate thermal shield material and was {{used on the}} bi-stems of replacement solar arrays installed on HST during SMI in December 1993. The SMI -installed solar arrays air scheduled to be replaced during MST's fourth servicing mission (SM 3 B) in early 2002...|$|E
40|$|Turbine disks in some {{advanced}} {{engine applications}} may {{be exposed to}} temperatures above 700 C for extended periods of time, approaching 1, 000 h. These exposures could affect the near-surface composition and microstructure through formation of damaged and often <b>embrittled</b> <b>layers.</b> The creation of such damaged layers could significantly affect local mechanical properties. Powder metal disk superalloys LSHR and ME 3 were exposed at temperatures of 704, 760, and 815 C for times up to 2, 020 h, and the types and depths of environmental attacked were measured. Fatigue tests were performed for selected cases at 704 and 760 C, to determine {{the impact of these}} exposures on fatigue life. Fatigue resistance was reduced up to 98 % in both superalloys for some exposure conditions. Tensile tests were also performed to help understand fatigue responses, and showed corresponding reductions in ductility. The changes in surface composition and phases, depths of these changed layers, failure responses, and failure initiation modes were compared...|$|R
40|$|Samples of {{fluorinated}} ethylene propylene copolymer thermal blanketing material, {{recovered from}} the Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF), were investigated to determine the nature {{and the extent of}} degradation due to exposure to the low-Earth-orbit environment. Samples recovered from the ram-facing direction of LDEF, which received vacuum-ultraviolet (VUV) radiation and atomic-oxygen impingement, and samples from the trailing edge, which received almost exclusively VUV exposure, were investigated by scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. The most significant result of this investigation was found on samples that received only VUV exposure. These samples possessed a hard, <b>embrittled</b> surface <b>layer</b> that was absent from the atomic-oxygen exposed sample and from unexposed control samples. This surface layer is believed to be responsible for the 'synergistic' effect between VUV and atomic oxygen. Overall, the investigation revealed dramatically different morphologies for the two samples. The sample receiving both atomic-oxygen and VUV exposure was deeply eroded and had a characteristic 'rolling' surface morphology, while the sample that received only VUV exposure showed mild erosion and a surface morphology characterized by sharp high-frequency peaks. The morphologies observed in the LDEF samples, including the <b>embrittled</b> surface <b>layer,</b> were successfully duplicated in the laboratory...|$|R
40|$|Examination of {{fluorinated}} ethylene propylene (FEP) copolymer materials {{recovered from}} the Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF) reveals differing damage characteristics on leading edge (ram-facing) versus trailing edge (wake-facing surfaces). Silver/Teflon (Ag/FEP) thermal control materials on ram facing surfaces of the LDEF exhibited obvious degradation, with an apparent increase in diffuse light scattering, whereas identical materials on the wake facing surfaces showed little apparent damage with cursory inspection. Microscopic examination of both types of surfaces reveals {{the nature and extent}} of environment induced degradation of materials. The ram facing surfaces were clearly eroded by atomic oxygen impingement, while the wake facing material developed a thin, highly <b>embrittled</b> surface <b>layer...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{residual}} {{mechanical properties}} of epoxy-organoclay nanocomposites after moisture and UV exposure have been evaluated. The flexural modulus decreased after moisture saturation, with much less extent for the nanocomposite than the neat epoxy. The tensile failure strain was significantly reduced with UV exposure time {{due to the}} embrittlement effect, {{and the addition of}} organoclay mitigated the failure strain reduction. The elastic modulus varied little with UV exposure time regardless of orgamoclay, because the modulus was determined by the core material which was unaffected by UV exposure. The microhardness and the modulus of the surface material determined from nanoindentation tests increased after UV exposure, with less extent in the nanocomposite than the neat epoxy due to the thinner <b>embrittled</b> top <b>layer</b> for the nanocomposite. All these observations confirmed the beneficial effects of organoclay in improving the barrier characteristics against UV exposure. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Boron {{reinforced}} 6061 aluminum (B/Al) composite was continuously exposed at 728 K {{for up to}} 240 {{hours and}} cyclically exposed between 293 K and 728 K for up to 6000 three-minute cycles. Room temperature tensile strengths were measured and the specimens were metallographically examined. The data suggest that, in addition to AlB 2 formation, magnesium in the matrix diffused to the reaction layer and formed (Al,Mg) B 2. This formation could weaken the matrix and <b>embrittle</b> the reaction <b>layer.</b> Continuous exposure degraded {{the strength of the}} B/Al specimens about 28 % in 240 hours. However, the fracture mode, one indicative of high strength interfaces, did not change. The strength degradation was attributed to crack initiation in the brittle reaction layer causing stress concentrations in the fibers. Cyclic exposure degraded the strength of the B/Al about 34 % in 6000 cycles. The fracture mode of the cyclic exposure specimens showed transition toward a mode characteristic of low interfacial strength. The lower interfacial strengths were attributed to stress fields induced by differential thermal expansion. Cyclic exposure degraded the strength of the B/Al specimens more than continuous exposure for similar cumulative exposure times...|$|R
40|$|A diverse {{range of}} {{microscopy}} techniques and mechanical testing methods {{have been used to}} characterize glass and glass-ceramic composites. The focus of the work has been a commercially available Barium Magnesium Aluminosilicate matrix reinforced by Tyranno SiC based yam type fibres. The mechanical behaviour has been related to the microstructure through use of models from the literature. The temperature range of study has been from room temperature to 1300 °C in air. The microstructure of the BMAS(fyranno was a diphasic mixture of celsian and indialite/cordierite although the manufacturers intention was a monophasic bariumosumilite. The carbon rich interface was found to be thin (l 0 - 15 nm) but the composite displayed impressive strength when compared to similar glass-ceramic composites reported in the literature. The matrix could be converted to the equilibrium bariumosumilite phase by heating in an inert atmosphere at 1370 °C (or possibly lower) but matrix elemental diffusion into the fibres is likely to impair fibre strength. Tensile failure was by conventional matrix microcracking with load transfer to the in line fibres. However the composite strength was found to be dependent upon the strain rate as was the microcracking threshold associated with cracking of the 0 ° plies. Failure of the UD BMAS(fyranno was by longitudinal splitting before the expected ultimate strength (from the 0, 90 ° results) was reached. This was due to an apparent notch sensitivity in this fibre architecture, a trait not observed in the 2 -D composite. Direct measurement methods were used to establish the interfacial shear strength and these were compared to various models. These were based on matrix cracking thresholds, matrix crack spacing and a relatively new method where an 'inelastic strain index' was found from loading and unloading curves or hysteresis loop widths. Greatest fidelity with the direct methods was found with the last of these models. As with all composites with carbon enriched interfaces oxidation of the interface and fibres was found to impair strength when tested in air at temperatures as low as 600 °C and possibly below this when testing at lower strain rates. At high strain rates, near room-temperature-strengths were achieved, even at 1 l 00 °C, as the degrading effects of the oxidizing environment had less time to act. Long term exposure at high temperatures (1200 °C) was responsible for formation of an <b>embrittled</b> surface <b>layer</b> up to 70 J. lm thick. Within this layer the fibres were severely degraded and strong bonding prevailed at the interface. At temperatures in excess of the expected fibre pyrolysis temperature, (l 100 °C), the composite was seen to shrink {{along the length of the}} fibre axis and dilate normal to it which was attributed to fibre instability. Stabilising the fibres by heat treatments at 1200 °C for 24 hours was seen to improve the creep performance in terms of the total strain accumulated within the 100 hours of the creep tests. The creep was comparable to other commercial glass ceramics (CAS/Nicalon and BMAS/BN/SiC/Nicalon) indicating the dominance of fibre creep properties on those of the composite. Cycling of the creep load seemed to result in a greater embrittled depth from the surface but failure at 100 MPa and 1200 °C was not observed within 240 hours of testing. Other systems were investigated such as the CAS/Nicalon, MAS/Nicalon and AS/Nicalon. Of these the AS/Nicalon was used for modelling the creep behaviour since it represented a simple system where matrix creep was accompanied by elastic deformation of the fibres. A model from the literature was used to explain an apparent increase in the elastic modulus during load cycling at high temperature and also the lower strain accumulation seen during load cycling compared to conventional creep tests...|$|R
