5|$|A major {{difference}} from the US Navy tables is that the repetitive group designators represent nitrogen levels in all tissues, unlike the USN table which represent only the 120-minute compartment. The Huggins repetitive group indicates {{a percentage of the}} M0 for the most saturated tissue, and this is <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the tables more applicable to multilevel diving procedures.|$|E

5|$|Agricultural {{improvement}} and the Industrial Revolution came to Aberdaron in the 19th century. The Inclosure (Consolidation) Act 1801 was <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> {{it easier for}} landlords to enclose and improve common land, introduce increased efficiency, bring more land under the plough, and reduce the high prices of agricultural production. Rhoshirwaun Common, following strong opposition, was enclosed in 1814; while the process was not completed in Aberdaron, Llanfaelrhys and Y Rhiw until 1861. On the industrial front, mining developed as {{a major source of}} employment, especially at Y Rhiw, where manganese was discovered in 1827.|$|E

5|$|Based on {{an anecdote}} about the Second World War by the Romani {{historian}} Jacques Sigot, {{the film was}} inspired by a Romani who escaped the Nazis with help from French villagers. It depicts the rarely documented subject of Porajmos (the Romani Holocaust). Other than a band of Romani people, the film has a character based on Yvette Lundy, a French teacher who was active in the French resistance and deported to a concentration camp for forging passports for Romani. Gatlif had <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a documentary but the lack of supporting documents led him to present it as a drama.|$|E
5|$|DiCaprio {{appeared}} in the mostly improvised short film called Don's Plum, {{as a favor to}} aspiring director R. D. Robb. When Robb decided to expand the black-and-white film to feature length, however, DiCaprio and costar Tobey Maguire had its release blocked by court order, arguing that they never <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it a theatrical release, as it would have commercial value thanks to their stardom. The film eventually premiered at the 2001 Berlin International Film Festival, where it was well received by critics. DiCaprio's last film of the year 1995 was The Basketball Diaries, a biographical film about Jim Carroll.|$|E
5|$|In 2013 {{an appeal}} to raise £3 million was {{launched}} to restore the pools. The fundraising has been supported by The Prince's Trust. The project aims not just to preserve the existing architecture, but also to reopen it as an outdoor lido. This is hampered by poor access to the site {{and the possibility of}} flooding. It is <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the work sustainable and environmentally friendly, with renewable sources of energy including water source heat pumps using latent heat from the River Avon. A small landing stage is being proposed to enable access to the pools from river craft.|$|E

5|$|Rights to {{the film}} {{adaptation}} were purchased for $100. Like the theatrical adaptation, Mary Asquith's screenplay removed much of the book's controversial sexual elements, censorship <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> Fox's nascent studio appear more respectable to the industry. Fox selected J.

5|$|The {{cemetery}} grounds are, {{except in}} drier climates, grass {{covered with a}} floral border around the headstones. There is also an absence of any paving between the headstone rows which is <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the cemetery feel like a traditional walled garden where visitors could experience a sense of peace. However, Carter and Jackson argue that the uniform aesthetics are designed to evoke a positive experience which deliberately masks and sanitises {{the nature of the}} war deaths.|$|E

It received mostly positive reviews, although a few reviewers discussed aspects of the episode that they felt did not blend in well with the rest of the episode and series.|$|E
5|$|The wing began re-equipping with P-51D Mustangs at Labuan in September 1945. No.481 (Maintenance) Squadron {{was formed}} in December from {{elements}} of No.22 Repair and Servicing Unit, No.25 Air Stores Park, and other units based on Labuan. No.381 (Base) Squadron, established in January 1946, also utilised personnel and equipment from No.81 Wing's specialist units at Labuan, including No.47 Operational Base Unit, No.24 Medical Clearing Station, No.25 Air Stores Park and No.2 Airfield Defence Squadron. RAAF base squadrons were administrative and logistical units, <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> their wings self-supporting and mobile for potential deployment.|$|E
5|$|Aside from {{reinforcing}} Luso-Rhodesian relations, the Lisbon {{appointment was}} designed to secure the African nation a diplomatic foothold in Europe outside of Britain's reach and to help Salisbury find new trading partners and diplomatic allies on the continent. Among other things, the Rhodesians <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> up the shortfalls in military equipment caused by the undeclared Anglo-American arms embargo. Reedman, the former minister for immigration and tourism, was also a retired officer of the British Royal Air Force (where he {{had been involved in}} bomber research), and an experienced engineer and businessman: all the right ingredients, the government thought, for someone in the position to source European aircraft, weapons and other equipment, while also representing Rhodesian interests in mainland Europe.|$|E

5|$|Edmund of Woodstock, 1st Earl of Kent (5 August 1301 – 19 March 1330) was {{the sixth}} son of Edward I of England, {{and a younger}} {{half-brother}} of Edward II. Edward I had <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> substantial grants of land to Edmund, but when the king died in 1307, Edward II failed {{to follow through on}} his father's intentions, much due to his favouritism towards Piers Gaveston. Edmund still remained loyal to his brother, and in 1321 he was created Earl of Kent. He played an important part in Edward's administration, acting both as diplomat and military commander, and in 1321–22 helped suppress a rebellion against the king.|$|E
5|$|Greenup was a {{candidate}} for governor of Kentucky in 1800, but was runner-up to James Garrard in a four-man race that also included Benjamin Logan and Thomas Todd. Greenup garnered {{a majority of the}} vote in fifteen counties, just one fewer than Garrard, but Garrard enjoyed strong support in the populous central Kentucky counties and received 8,390 votes, compared with 6,746 for Greenup, 3,996 for Logan, and 2,166 for Todd. Garrard appointed Greenup judge of the circuit court in 1802. After the Kentucky Senate refused to confirm Garrard's Secretary of State, Harry Toulmin, as registrar of the land office, Garrard nominated Greenup. Greenup, however, <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> another run at the governorship, and at his request, Garrard withdrew the nomination days later.|$|E
