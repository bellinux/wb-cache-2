In her expanded role, she was given authority to represent Guterres and UNHCR at the <b>diplomatic</b> <b>level,</b> with a focus on major refugee crises. In the months following her promotion, she made her first visit as Special Envoy—her third over all—to Ecuador, where she met with Colombian refugees, and she accompanied Guterres on a week-long tour of Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey, and Iraq, to assess the situation of refugees from neighboring Syria. Since then, Jolie has gone on over a dozen field missions around the world to meet with refugees and undertake advocacy on their behalf.|$|E

40|$|Absract: Much of the {{emphasis}} {{of the research on}} North American relations is focused on NAFTA and NORAD as they represent major cooperative efforts involving a substantial amount of negotiation between the two countries with differing initial positions. However, there has been little systematic research examining cooperation that takes place at lower <b>diplomatic</b> <b>levels</b> (i. e. exchanges of diplomatic notes, memorandums of understanding etc). Cooperation at lower <b>diplomatic</b> <b>levels</b> may allow leaders to bypass the normal legislative approval mechanisms making them a nice way for leaders to exercise effective foreign policy autonomy especially when the domestic political environment constrains leaders. Using information provided by a new dataset on North American military technical cooperation between 1950 and 2005, this study explores the depth of military technical cooperation between the US and Canada. The goal of the study is to gain a more complete understanding of both the complexity and density of cooperative endeavors between these two close nations in order to shed light on how cooperative structures developed at lower <b>diplomatic</b> <b>levels</b> are an important element of foreign policy interactions among close allies. Insights drawn from this research may be of interest to scholars designing nascent European military technical cooperation...|$|R
