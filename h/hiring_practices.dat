5|$|Under Zinn, the Argonne National Laboratory adopted {{slightly}} more progressive <b>hiring</b> <b>practices</b> than other contemporary institutions. Three African American women and seven men, six {{of whom had}} worked on the Manhattan Project, were employed in research at Argonne {{at a time when}} the Los Alamos National Laboratory had no African American scientists.

5|$|Based upon another {{recommendation}} from Cabranes, Sotomayor {{was a member}} of the board of directors of the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund from 1980 to 1992. There she was a top policy maker who worked actively with the organization's lawyers on issues such as New York City <b>hiring</b> <b>practices,</b> police brutality, the death penalty, and voting rights. The group achieved its most visible triumph when it successfully blocked a city primary election on the grounds that New York City Council boundaries diminished the power of minority voters.|$|E
5|$|During the strike, despite {{considerable}} tensions, {{the city}} of Philadelphia remained mostly calm {{and there were no}} major outbreaks of violence. All of the city's newspapers editorialized against the strike and the public was, by and large, opposed to the strike as well. Several of the strike leaders, including James McMenamin and Frank Carney, were arrested for violating the anti-strike act. The NAACP played an active role both in pressuring the PTC and the federal government to institute fair <b>hiring</b> <b>practices</b> at the PTC for several years before the strike, and in maintaining the calm during the strike itself.|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} market's {{reaction}} to companies hiring accounting and finance officers directly from their external audit firms-the auditor-to-client <b>hiring</b> <b>practice</b> {{referred to as}} the "revolving door. " The Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) eliminated this <b>hiring</b> <b>practice,</b> reflecting concerns that such appointments may impair audit and financial reporting quality. However, it was also argued that companies may have benefited from hiring individuals already familiar with their systems, organization and personnel. To determine the prevalence of this <b>hiring</b> <b>practice</b> and how shareholders viewed these appointments, we examine 3 -day cumulative abnormal returns around the announcements of newly appointed accounting and finance officers over the period 1985 - 2002. We find that the proportion of revolving door hires is relatively low (only 6. 1 % of all hires in our sample), but that when they did occur the market valued the revolving door appointments more positively than other appointments. Further tests reveal that the positive market reaction to revolving door appointments is driven mainly by smaller companies, and that these appointments are not associated with lower financial reporting quality when assessing subsequent discretionary accruals or the receipt of an Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Release (AAER). Overall, the low frequency of occurrence, investors' positive perceptions, and the lack of association with deteriorated reporting quality indicate that the SOX restriction on revolving door appointments may have been unnecessary and will do little to protect shareholders...|$|R

5|$|In 2004, Carroll {{was elected}} to the Kentucky Senate from District 7, {{defeating}} Harold Fletcher – the older brother of then-governor Ernie Fletcher – by a wide margin. The district included all or portions of Anderson, Fayette, Franklin, and Woodford counties. He made headlines in 2007 when he called on Fletcher's lieutenant governor, Steve Pence, to resign for his disloyalty after Pence endorsed Anne Northup in the Republican gubernatorial primary rather than backing Fletcher's re-election bid. Pence refused to resign, citing an investigation of the administration's <b>hiring</b> <b>practices</b> as his reason for refusing to endorse Fletcher. Fletcher won the Republican primary, but lost in the general election to Democrat Steve Beshear.|$|E
5|$|The major set {{of reforms}} that began {{under the rule}} of Isma'il Pasha {{continued}} under the British occupation. Muhammad Mahdi al-'Abbasi, sheikh al-Azhar, had instituted a set of reforms in 1872 intended to provide structure to the <b>hiring</b> <b>practices</b> of the university as well as to standardize the examinations taken by students. Further efforts to modernize the educational system were made under Hilmi's rule during the British occupation. The mosque's manuscripts were gathered into a centralized library, sanitation for students improved, and a regular system of exams instituted. From 1885, other colleges in Egypt were placed directly under the administration of the al-Azhar Mosque.|$|E
5|$|Fletcher {{was elected}} {{governor}} in 2003 over state Attorney General Ben Chandler. Early in his term, Fletcher achieved some savings {{to the state}} by reorganizing the executive branch. He proposed an overhaul to the state tax code in 2004, {{but was unable to}} get it passed through the General Assembly. When Republicans in the state senate insisted on tying the reforms to the state budget, the legislature adjourned without passing either, and the state operated under an executive spending plan drafted by Fletcher until 2005, when both the budget and the reforms were passed. Later in 2005, Attorney General Greg Stumbo, the state's highest-ranking Democrat, launched an investigation into whether the Fletcher administration's <b>hiring</b> <b>practices</b> violated the state's merit system. A grand jury returned several indictments against members of Fletcher's staff, and eventually against Fletcher himself. Fletcher issued pardons for anyone on his staff implicated in the investigation, but did not pardon himself. Though the investigation was ended by an agreement between Fletcher and Stumbo in late 2006, it continued to overshadow Fletcher's re-election bid in 2007. After turning back a challenge in the Republican primary by former Congresswoman Anne Northup, Fletcher lost the general election to Democrat Steve Beshear. After his term as governor, he returned to the medical field as founder and CEO of Alton Healthcare. He is married and has two grown children.|$|E

50|$|The 2004 {{statistical}} {{report from the}} Saudi Ministry of Economy and Planning acknowledged that non-Saudis account for 67% of the Kingdom’s labor force.

Without these workers, many of whom are non-Muslims, the Saudi economy would collapse. This <b>hiring</b> <b>practice</b> permeates the government and private employment sectors. Saudis are bypassed in favor of cheap labor, mostly from poorer Asian or African countries, who accept any terms without complaint due to their fear of arrest or deportation.|$|R

30|$|Video job {{interviews}} {{have become a}} common <b>hiring</b> <b>practice,</b> allowing employers to save money and recruit from a wider applicant pool. But differences in job candidates’ internet connections mean that some interviews will have higher audiovisual (AV) quality than others. We hypothesized that interviewers would be impacted by AV quality when they rated job candidates. In two experiments, participants viewed two-minute long simulated Skype interviews that were either unedited (fluent videos) or edited to mimic {{the effects of a}} poor internet connection (disfluent videos). Participants in both experiments rated job candidates from fluent videos as more hirable, even after being explicitly told to disregard AV quality (experiment 2). Our findings suggest that video interviews may favor job candidates with better internet connections and that being aware of this bias does not make it go away.|$|R
