40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (page 19) In {{the construction}} of structural steel buildings, a commonly used technique for <b>fastening</b> <b>parts</b> together is the "friction type connection". This connection functions by maintaining a constant frictional force between connected parts, sufficient to transmit design loads. Connections of this type require consistent bolt tension when erected to control this frictional force. Since consistent bolt tension is important, Coronet Load Indicator washers are sometimes used to control tension tolerances. It is also necessary that bolt holes are aligned {{in the field for}} placement of the bolts, but often times the holes are not aligned properly. To reduce the effects misalignment has on bolt holes during construction, it is helpful to use oversized holes. The effects of oversized holes on the Coronet Load Indicator washer are extremely important in their uses. It is found that on regular and oversized holes, the slip loads were larger than the minimums allowed by building code. In certain instances additional washers were required to prevent the load indicator washer from deforming into the oversized hole...|$|R

40|$|In machine {{assembly}} it {{is often}} required that bolts used to <b>fasten</b> machine <b>parts</b> be installed with specific design preloads. Because it is inconvenient to measure preload directly, preload specifications are usually based on some more easily measured quantity with which the level of preload may be correlated. Most often this quantity is the torque {{to be applied to}} the bolt at installation. Studies by Blake and Kurtz [1] and Heyman [2] have shown that when bolts are torqued into place, the fraction of applied torque which translates into useful preload is small and widely variable. This is so because the large majority of applied torque is absorbed in overcoming friction in the bolt’s threads and at the underside of the bolt’s head. Consequently, even though the torque to install different bolts may be identical, small variations in frictional conditions from one installation to the next can result in large variations in preload. The unreliability of torque as an indicator of preload has been the motivating factor behind the development of a number of alternate methods of measurement [2 – 5]...|$|R

40|$|Adhesives {{are widely}} used and often {{preferred}} {{as a means of}} <b>fastening</b> <b>parts</b> together. Aircraft applications in bonding large areas or bonding parts of vehicle chassis, has brought about the need for highly reliable techniques in non destructive testing of adhesive bonds. Despite the many years of research there is still a need for further work to achieve a reliable method that can fully predict the performance of adhesive bonds under operating conditions. Among a wide range of different methods, a variety of ultrasonic techniques are used for non-destructive testing of adhesive bonds including pulse echo or through signal. In all cases the ultrasonic signal response is analyzed and conclusions are drawn with regard {{to the quality of the}} adhesive bond. Features of the ultrasonic signal, such as amplitude and frequency, are used for analysis. Even though there have been great improvements in ultrasonic testing of adhesive bonds, it is not always easy to extract conclusive information from the signals that discriminate clearly between the levels of bond quality. The method introduced in this paper enhances the capability of discriminating between varying degrees of bond quality when compared with existing methods in ultrasonic testing. A widely used method utilizes the magnitude of the returning signal as a measure of the level of contact between the adhesive and adherent. Higher amplitudes indicate lesser contact as less signal is transmitted through to the adhesive. However differences in output signal can be very small and in some cases is unable to discriminate between “good” and “bad” areas. Furthermore, measurement units are in terms of mVolts that could easily be lost in signal noise. The method introduced here uses Wavelet Packets for analysis of ultrasonic signals. Wavelets are analogues to sine and cosine functions of traditional Fourier analysis however they offer features, which overcome some of the limitations of traditional Fourier analysis in characterizing signal structures with sharp changes. Wavelet Packet filters are used to calculate the coefficients of the ultrasonic signal under investigation. These coefficients are subsequently linked to the quality of the adhesive bond. Research in this area revealed that substantial improvements could be achieved in differentiating signals between varying categories of defective areas. Non-defective areas were differentiated from those with defects by a factor of 20 when using the Wavelet Packet method. The Maximum Value method could only differentiate the same areas by a factor of 2. 5. Standard Ultrasonic testing equipment was used with accompanying software and an X Y Z test rig to enable scanning of specimens. The specimens were prepared from materials that are used in the automotive industry i. e. 0. 8 mm sheet steel and structural adhesive. The defects were strategically placed between the adhesive and metal for later comparison with the ultrasonic test results. Data from the experiments was used to conduct suitable analyses for comparing the traditional with the proposed method. The method developed here is a sensitive tool providing high-resolution discrimination when applied to reading of ultrasonic signals from adhesive bonds...|$|R
