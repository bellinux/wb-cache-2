She stated that her {{performance on the}} field improved after she gained more confidence in who she was off the field. McLeod believes promoting such confidence and creating an accepting environment, as Athlete Ally strives to do, is important for athletes and <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> she joined the organization.|$|E
50|$|Later {{while talking}} to Shivaramu, {{everyone}} gives their own explanation for Shambhu’s disappearance. Laxmi talks about an incident which could <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> for leaving. Narayana describes Shambhu as a crooked minded. Gopalayya describes that opposing Shambhu’s decision to join freedom movement may <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> {{for him to}} leave the place. At the same time Shankaramma also blames herself to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> for his riddance. Each character explores their hidden feelings in their own way with Shivaramu.|$|R

5|$|The heat {{needed for}} geyser {{formation}} comes from magma {{that needs to}} be near the surface of the earth. The fact that geysers need heat much higher than normally found near the earth's surface <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> they are associated with volcanoes or volcanic areas. The pressures encountered at the areas where the water is heated make the boiling point of the water much higher than at normal atmospheric pressures.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} of energy at the core <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> stars shine so brightly: every time two or more atomic nuclei fuse {{together to form a}} single atomic nucleus of a new heavier element, gamma ray photons are released from the nuclear fusion product. This energy is converted to other forms of electromagnetic energy of lower frequency, such as visible light, by the time it reaches the star's outer layers.|$|E
5|$|The {{stability}} of the 6s shell {{is due to the}} presence of a filled 4f shell. An f shell poorly screens the nuclear charge that increases the attractive Coulomb interaction of the 6s shell and the nucleus (see lanthanide contraction). The absence of a filled inner f shell <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> for the somewhat higher melting temperature of cadmium and zinc, although both these metals still melt easily and, in addition, have unusually low boiling points.|$|E

5|$|The {{studio is}} praised {{primarily}} for its original and innovative productions, {{and it has}} gretely affected the animated film history over the last decades. Disney studios take inspiration {{from some of the}} other studios such as Studio Ghibli and Madhouse because the production team feels that many of the Japan's studios are ahead of them and capable of making better animation, which <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> why they get inspiration from what those studios produce.|$|E
5|$|A recent {{geological}} formation, Carabane {{consists of}} a shoal and alluvium. The alluvium has developed because of the saltwater streams that cut across the shoal. As pointed out by early French observers, soils {{in the region are}} generally composed of sand and clay, differing in mixture and layer according to natural and human factors. However, Carabane seems to be composed entirely of sand. The lack of clay <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> that architecture on the island employs straw wrapped around wooden frames more often than banco mud bricks. This type of architecture is also common in the villages of Mlomp and Seleki.|$|E

5|$|Another {{example is}} the Great Vowel Shift in English, which <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> that the {{spelling}} of English vowels do not correspond well to their current pronunciation. This is because the vowel shift brought the already established orthography out of synchronization with pronunciation. Another source of sound change is the erosion of words as pronunciation gradually becomes increasingly indistinct and shortens words, leaving out syllables or sounds. This kind of change caused Latin mea domina to eventually become the French madame and American English ma'am.|$|E
5|$|Between 24 and 25° degrees {{southern}} latitude the Andean Dry Diagonal crosses the Andes. At this latitude, {{half of the}} precipitation falls in summer {{and the other half}} in winter. The formation of this dry diagonal is an effect both of the rainshadow effect of the Andes, air subsidence within South Pacific High, and the cold Humboldt Current off the Pacific coast. This <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> why the Atacama Desert exists. The extremely arid climate at Llullaillaco is also a consequence of these climatic effects.|$|E
5|$|Conversely, Anthony Camp {{challenges}} {{the belief that}} Sophia had a child and provides a detailed summary of the available evidence. In his book Royal Babylon: the Alarming History of European Royalty, author Karl Shaw writes {{of the possibility that}} the Duke raped his sister, citing evidence from Charles Greville's diaries, as well as other factors. Historian Gillian Gill believes that Sophia secretly gave birth to the child and that this <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> Sophia never married. Alison Weir and others, however, write of a possible marriage between Sophia and Garth the same year as the child's birth, but {{there is no evidence to}} back this assertion other than the presence of a wedding ring in a portrait of an aged Sophia.|$|E

5|$|In 1499 the Duchy of Milan was conquered by the French, {{causing a}} {{diaspora}} of {{artists from the}} city to all of northern Italy and beyond. Perhaps this <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> {{for the return of}} Tamagnino to Brescia. A tantalising project was the commission of the Palazzo della Loggia, in which he participated between November 1499 and June 1500. Sculptural works that had begun at the Loggia in 1492, when Tamagnino had left Brescia, were now the hegemony of Gasparo Cairano, for some years considered as a court sculptor by the Brescian grandees, both public and private.|$|E

5|$|Initially, BioWare {{denied that}} a PlayStation 3 version {{was in the}} works. Despite this, it was {{reported}} that the Microsoft Windows version of the game featured lines of code referencing the PlayStation 3. BioWare responded that the Unreal Engine 3 is a cross-platform, which <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> why it includes PlayStation 3 code. Eventually, a PlayStation 3 version of Mass Effect 2 was released a year later than the Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360 versions of the game. The PlayStation 3 version uses {{a modified version of the}} Unreal Engine 3 called Mass Effect 3 engine; the same engine BioWare used for the then-upcoming Mass Effect 3. In this newer version, character models were slightly improved and controls were updated to support the PlayStation 3 controller. An option which allowed to switch back to the Xbox 360 controls layout was also added.|$|E
5|$|Most {{albatrosses}} {{range in}} the Southern Hemisphere from Antarctica to Australia, South Africa and South America. The exceptions to this are the four North Pacific albatrosses, of which three occur exclusively in the North Pacific, from Hawaii to Japan, California and Alaska; and one, the waved albatross, breeds in the Galápagos Islands and feeds {{off the coast of}} South America. The need for wind to enable gliding <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> albatrosses are for the most part confined to higher latitudes: being unsuited to sustained flapping flight makes crossing the doldrums extremely difficult. The exception, the waved albatross, is able to live in the equatorial waters around the Galápagos Islands because of the cool waters of the Humboldt Current and the resulting winds.|$|E
5|$|Phil {{explains}} to Mulder {{that he wanted}} a divorce from Ellen two years ago, but she got pregnant and would not allow it. He also believes that he <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> for this happening and that he somehow summoned the entity. It turns out that Ellen is the entity, which is given away by a cut in her back given by Jenny during the attack. Ellen transforms into the creature, attacks Mulder, and attempts to drown him in a bath tub, but stops when she sees her monstrous reflection in the water. She is placed in a psychiatric hospital, where the doctors diagnose her with multiple personality disorder. Meanwhile, Scully reveals to Mulder that the mysterious prostitute killer was not an X-File at all, but rather a man disguised {{as a woman who}} talked to the prostitutes about religion and attempted to help them get out of the prostitution ring.|$|E
