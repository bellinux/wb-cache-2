The aim of this thesis was to investigate, by epidemiological methods, whether <b>heterocyclic</b> <b>amines</b> are responsible for part of the diet-related cancer burden in humans. Frequently eaten fried meat dishes in an elderly population in Stockholm, Sweden, were identified, and we found meat to be eaten, on the average, 1. 4 times per day, and frying to be the most popular cooking method. Altogether, 22 frequently consumed dishes were fried/baked in a standardized manner under controlled conditions at 150, 175, 200, and 225 °C, and the content of <b>heterocyclic</b> <b>amines,</b> including IQ, MelQ, MelQx, DiMelQx, and PhlP, was determined. The formation of <b>heterocyclic</b> <b>amines</b> was found to be temperature-related and the highest amounts were detected in minute steak, pork filet, and bacon fried at 225 °C. A method to assess the individual intake of <b>heterocyclic</b> <b>amines</b> in an epidemiological context was developed by linking values for <b>heterocyclic</b> <b>amines</b> obtained from chemical analyses to food consumption data collected by means of a semiquantitativc food frequency questionnaire comprising 188 food items. Variables used to assess the intake of <b>heterocyclic</b> <b>amines</b> were intake frequency, type of dish, cooking method, portion size, degree of surface browning of the meat, and intake of gravy. When the number or dishes in the food frequency module was reduced from 39 to 15 dishes, based on the most informative dishcs according to the total intake or the between-person variancc, only a limited amount of misclassification was introduced. The total daily intake of IQ, MelQ, MelQx, DiMelQx, and PhlP among controls ranged from zero to 1816 ng, with a median of 77 ng. Relative risks of cancer were estimated in a population-based case-control study in Stockholm, and information was retrieved from 553 controls, 352 cases of colon cancer, 249 rectal cancer cases, 273 bladder cancer cases, and 138 cases of kidney cancer. The study disentangles the effect of meat from the effect of <b>heterocyclic</b> <b>amines,</b> and we found that an intake of <b>heterocyclic</b> <b>amines</b> within the usual dietary range in the study base is unlikely to increase the incidence of cancer of the colon, rectum, bladder, or kidney.

50|$|The {{nitrous acid}} is {{typically}} prepared in situ from sodium nitrite and acid. Following two protonation steps, one equivalent {{of water is}} lost to form the nitrosonium ion.

The substitution of the aromatic diazo group with a halogen or pseudohalogen is initiated by a one-electron transfer mechanism catalyzed by copper(I) to form an aryl radical with loss of nitrogen gas. The substituted arene is formed through a radical mechanism with regeneration of the copper(I) catalyst.

For example, nitrites used as food preservatives in cured meat such as bacon have also been noted as being carcinogenic with demographic links, but not causation, to colon cancer. Cooking food at high temperatures, for example grilling or barbecuing meats, can, or can not, also lead to the formation of minute quantities of many potent carcinogens that are comparable to those found in cigarette smoke (i.e., benzoapyrene). Charring of food looks like coking and tobacco pyrolysis, and produces carcinogens. There are several carcinogenic pyrolysis products, such as polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons, which are converted by human enzymes into epoxides, which attach permanently to DNA.

40|$|Many {{carcinogens}} {{have been}} shown to cause tissue specific tumors in animal models. The mechanism for this specificity has not been fully elucidated and is usually attributed to differences in organ metabolism. For <b>heterocyclic</b> <b>amines,</b> potent carcinogens that are formed in well-done meat, the ability to either bind to the estrogen receptor and activate or inhibit an estrogenic response will {{have a major impact on}} carcinogenicity. Here we describe our work with the human estrogen receptor alpha (hERa) and the mutagenic/carcinogenic <b>heterocyclic</b> <b>amines</b> PhIP, MeIQx, IFP, and the hydroxylated metabolite of PhIP, N 2 -hydroxy-PhIP.

This binding competes with estradiol (E 2) in the native E 2 binding cavity of the receptor. We also find that other <b>heterocyclic</b> <b>amines</b> and N 2 -hydroxy-PhIP inhibit ER activation presumably by binding into another cavity on the LBD. Moreover, molecular dynamics simulations of inhibitory <b>heterocyclic</b> <b>amines</b> reveal a disruption of the surface of the receptor protein involved with protein-protein signaling.

Metabolic activation of 2 -AA was detected in all GIT tissues except the duodenum and rectum, and it was detected at high levels in the ileum and cecum.
