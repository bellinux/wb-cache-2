40|$|ABSTRACT] Drought is {{a natural}} hazard that has {{significant}} impact on environmental, economic and socio economic aspects. The Indonesian Agroclimate and Hydrology Research Institute (IAHRI) is currently developing a vegetation drought monitoring system by using either the meteorological or satellite imagery {{as part of its}} effort to combat the effects of drought in Indonesia. The project methodology is depended on six main steps: (1) Development of meteorological database system, (2) Analysis of vegetation drought using Water and Agroclimate Research Management model (WARM ver. 1. 0), (3) Determination the drought index based on meteorological data, (4) Building the ground station High Resolution Picture Transmission (HRPT) AVHRR receiver, (5) Application the remote sensing for vegetation drought monitoring, and (6) On-line spatial drought information delivery. The primary goal of this project is to develop an efficient system in Indonesia to analyze and deliver drought related information to the stakeholders and agricultural industries on the <b>ground</b> for <b>drought</b> preparedness and management...|$|R
5000|$|A drought is {{a period}} of below-average {{precipitation}} in a given region, resulting in prolonged shortages in the water supply, whether atmospheric, surface water or <b>ground</b> water. A <b>drought</b> can last for months or years, or may be declared after as few as 15 days. It can have a substantial impact on the ecosystem and agriculture of the affected region and harm to the local economy. [...] Annual dry seasons in the tropics significantly increase the chances of a drought developing and subsequent bush fires. Periods of heat can significantly worsen drought conditions by hastening evaporation of water vapour.|$|R
5000|$|The Texas {{tuberose}} is acaulescent, {{meaning the}} stem is extremely short. The fleshy silvery-green leaves {{are covered with}} purple spots and in low light situations may lay flat on the <b>ground.</b> In a <b>drought,</b> the leaves may wither, leaving little or nothing visible above ground. Sufficient precipitation yields an inflorescence 60 cm tall in the period April-September. The new flower stalks (inflorescences) are fed on by small mammals, javelina, deer, and feral pigs, which can end the flowering effort for that season. The leaves are fed on by these as well, especially during droughts, weakening and killing the plants.|$|R
25|$|In {{the early}} 1800s, {{there were an}} {{estimated}} 30 million bison on the Great Plains. However, the lucrative robe trade accelerated overhunting of the plains bison by indigenous groups and white settlers alike. The bison on the western plains were last {{to be affected by}} white American expansionism, but by the 1850s even those herds were diminished. Westward migration of domesticated animals and people destroyed grazing <b>grounds,</b> and <b>drought</b> and new diseases exacerbated the decline. The plight of the bison was largely seen as the superiority of man over nature until the early 19th century. Historian Andrew Isenberg argues that the rise of capitalist ideology drove indigenous and white hunters alike to compete for every last animal, and that a multitude of factors – disease, drought, westward expansion, commercialization and industrialization of hunting, colonialism, and the introduction of domestic animals from Europe – caused the near-extinction of the bison. Ironically, others point out that the bison depletion was a problem of the tragedy of the commons, the opposite of capitalism: The bison were communal property, not private property, therefore they were abused and squandered.|$|R
50|$|Twiggy emu-bush is an {{ornamental}} shrub which {{is well known}} in horticulture, and some specimens have been grown for more than 35 years. It flowers profusely in summer, bearing masses of white flowers when most other shrubs are dormant and is a useful screening plant, with its dense, tangled branches. Propagation is easiest from cuttings which strike within a few weeks in warm weather and its arching branches sometimes develop roots when they touch the <b>ground.</b> A very <b>drought</b> tolerant shrub, it only requires watering once or twice during a long drought and a deep watering early in summer will sometimes stimulate a mass flowering. It is also tolerant of frost and can be pruned, preferably in early autumn. A hybrid with E. divaricata called Eremophila 'summertime blue' is popular in american gardens.|$|R
40|$|Wheat is {{the main}} staple food and largest grain crop of Pakistan. Abiotic stress reduces plantâ€™s growth or development. An {{extended}} period of water deficits over months or years {{is the main}} cause of the drought. Drought arises in plants when the rate of transpiration is greater than rate of water uptake. QTLs (quantitative trait loci) are detected in mapping populations developed from controlled crosses segregating for the trait of interest and are a correlation of DNA marker data with phenotypic information. The research was conducted at PMAS Arid Agriculture University, Rawalpindi, Wheat Wide Crosses and Cytogenetic (WWC), National Agriculture Research Center, (NARC) Islamabad and Cereal Research institute (CRA-CER), Foggia Italy. The double haploid mapping population 5 (DR. MP. 5), with its individuals having pedigree of (Doy 1 // Ae. Squarrosa (458) / 5 / Opata), was planted under control (Field, fully irrigated) and stress (rain shelter) conditions. The parents of mapping population, i. e., SH 349 (D genome <b>grounded</b> <b>drought</b> tolerant synthetic hexaploid wheat) and bread wheat (Opata M- 85, drought susceptible) were also grown individually in the field and tunnel. The biochemical analysis included osmolytes determination, i. e. soluble sugar; proline and antioxidant included superoxide dismutase activity, cell membrane stability followed by molecular diagnostics including DNA extraction, polymerase chain reaction and capillary electrophoresis. Yield and Yield Components were included Days to heading, Days to physiological maturity, Plant height (cm), Spike length (cm), Number of grains per spike, 1000 Grain weight (g), pubescence, awn color and prostrate vs. erect habit. In this study, STATISTIX software was used for Two Factors Factorial Analysis of Variance, LSD (Least Significant Difference) did a comparison of means, and STATISTICA software was used to find out the correlation among different traits under control and stress conditions. For linkage and QTL analyses, JoinMap 4 and MapQTL 5 were used. Five Drought tolerant wheat lines were identified (18, 34, 54, 56 and 59). A linkage map was built by using SSR markers. One hundred and seventy four SSRs markers were used to screen the parents, (Opata, drought sensitive, and SH 349, drought tolerant). Seventy-nine polymorphic markers were identified and applied to drought mapping populations. Interval mapping (IM) and Multiple QTL mapping (MQM) did detection of QTLs. In IM analysis, fifteen QTLs were found for stress condition and thirty-eight QTLs were found in control conditions. In MQM analysis, twelve QTLs were found to control under field conditions and sixteen QTLs were detected in MQM analysis under stress. Eleven Novel QTLs have been identified for different traits, six by IM and five by MQM. In the end the results of this research presented that there are some drought tolerant or resistant alleles have been identified which can be moved to vulnerable genotypes using MAS (Marker Assisted Selection). In addition, this study provided additional evidence that the QTL strategy is useful and able to enhance performance of existing cultivars. Further QTL studies will assist in the contribution of positive allelic diversity in the future...|$|R
40|$|Although seed {{dispersal}} through animal guts (endozoochory) {{is a process}} that determines plant establishment, the behaviour of carriers mean that the seeds are not always dispersed to suitable habitats for germination. The germinable seeds of Gaultheria miqueliana were stored in the pellets of a hare (Lepus timidus ainu) on Mount Koma in northern Japan. To clarify the roles of hares in {{seed dispersal}} and germination, field censuses and laboratory experiments were conducted. The field observations were conducted on pellets and seeds in four habitats (bare ground, G. miqueliana shrub patch, Salix reinii patch, and Larix kaempferi understory), and the laboratory experiments were conducted on seed germination with different light, water potential and cold stratification treatments. The laboratory experiments confirmed that seed germination began {{a few weeks after the}} sowing of seeds, independent of cold stratification, when light was sufficient and the water potential was low. The seeds did not germinate at high water potential. The pellets were gradually degraded in situ. More seeds germinated from crushed than from intact pellets. Therefore, over the long term, seeds germinated when exposed to light due to the degradation of pellets. The pellets were proportionally dispersed among the four studied habitats. More seeds sown in the field germinated more in shaded habitats, such as in the Gaultheria patch and the Larix understory, and seeds did not germinate on bare <b>ground,</b> where <b>drought</b> often occurred. Thus, the hares had two roles in the dispersal and germination of seeds: (1) the expansion of G. miqueliana populations through seed dispersal to various habitats and (2) the facilitation of delayed seed germination to avoid risks of hazards such as drought. The relationships between small mammals represented by the hare and the shrubs that produce berries are likely to be more mutually evolved than was previously thought...|$|R
50|$|During winter a new leaf pair, or {{occasionally}} {{more than}} one, grows inside the existing fused leaf pair. In spring the old leaf pair parts {{to reveal the}} new leaves and the old leaves will then dry up. Lithops leaves may shrink and disappear below <b>ground</b> level during <b>drought.</b> Lithops in habitat almost never {{have more than one}} leaf pair per head, presumably as an adaptation to the arid environment. Yellow or white flowers emerge from the fissure between the leaves after the new leaf pair has fully matured, one per leaf pair. This is usually in autumn, but can be before the summer solstice in L. pseudotruncatella and after the winter solstice in L. optica. The flowers are often sweetly scented.The most startling adaptation of Lithops is the colouring of the leaves. The leaves are fenestrated, and the epidermal windows are patterned in various shades of cream, grey, and brown, with darker windowed areas, dots, and red lines, according to species and local conditions. The markings function as remarkable camouflage for the plant in its typical stone-like environment. As is typical of a window plant, the green tissue lines the inside of the leaves and is covered with translucent tissue beneath the epidermal windows.|$|R
40|$|Lower River Kaduna {{catchment}} area {{is located in}} north part of Nigeria where climate variability is pronounce such as high rainfall which result to <b>drought,</b> <b>ground</b> water scarcity and high surface water to evaporation. As such it is importance to investigate the temporal variation evapotranspiration of this area. Because it determined the atmospheric water demand in the catchment. Meteorological {{data were collected from}} Nigeria Meteorological Agency which include mean temperature and solar radiation for the period of 21 years (1994 - 2014). Makkink method of estimating evapotranspiration was used. Trend analysis, normality test and coefficient of variance were carried out respectively. The result revealed that the evapotranspiration has mean value of 4. 22 mm day- 1, solar radiation has mean value of 21. 48 MJ m− 2 day− 1 and temperature has mean value of 32. 07 °C. Both variables show a moderate variability in the catchment. Evapotranspiration and solar radiation show a negative annual trend while the temperature reveals positive annual trend. April to October has decrease of solar radiation, temperature and evapotranspiration while the remaining month has an increase trend.

40|$|In Western-Europe, {{agricultural}} practices {{have contributed to}} environmental problems such as eutrophication of surface and <b>ground</b> water, flooding, <b>drought</b> and desiccation of surrounding natural habitats. Solutions that reduce {{the impact of these}} problems are urgently needed. Common reed (Phragmites australis) is capable of sanitizing surface water and may function as green energy source because of its high productivity. Here, the results of an experiment in a constructed wetland in the Netherlands are presented where two different sanitation treatments were compared. Depending on the residence time and volume per unit area, reed is capable to reduce the total amount of nitrogen in the water with average efficiencies from 32 to 47 % and the total amount of phosphorous with 27 – 45 %. Although biomass production still varies largely between different parts of the constructed wetland, a rapid increase in biomass was observed since planting. Constructed wetlands with reed provide opportunities to improve water quality and reed produces enough biomass to serve as green energy source. Moreover, these wetlands also function as a flood water reservoir and are possibly advantageous for biodiversity. The optimal moment of reed harvesting depends on the goal of the owner. This moment should be chosen wisely, as it may have consequences for reed filter regeneration, biomass production, biodiversity, methane emission and water sanitation efficiency...|$|R
40|$|A {{century of}} sulphur dioxide fumigation, copper and nickel {{particulate}} deposition, fire, soil erosion, and enhanced frost action has created 10 000 ha of barren land and 36 000 ha of stunted, open birch-maple woodland in the Sudbury area. The primary factor limiting plant colonization is the acidic and aluminum-, copper-, and nickel-toxic {{properties of the}} soils, although certain plant species survive the challenges through genetically based metal tolerance. In revegetation programs, the soil can be detoxified sufficiently to initiate colonization by the surface application of <b>ground</b> limestone. The <b>drought</b> vulnerability of seedlings, resulting from soil toxicity limiting root growth, is exacerbated by enhanced frost action resulting {{from the lack of}} leaf litter. Manual surface application of ground limestone, with or without an accompanying fertilizer and (or) grass-legume seed application, leads to immediate colonization by woody species including birch, aspen, and willows, and more than 3000 ha have been treated in this way by the Regional Municipality of Sudbury since 1978. Native coniferous species have also been planted in groups to form a seed source for future colonization. Most barren soils contain a substantial reservoir of phosphorus and nitrogen in the form of residual organic matter, but both rhizobial and actinorhizal species {{play an important role in}} dynamics, and the role of mycorrhizae is probably critical. The seed availability factor is rarely limiting; while the seed bank is small, in most sites the seed rain of light, wind-dispersed seeds is adequate to colonize soil detoxified by limin...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} serious {{droughts}} in last century occurred in eastern Sichuan Basin in the summer of 2006 (hereinafter called the Drought). The response of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS, boarding on NASA satellites of Terra and Aqua) to the Drought was analyzed in order to reach one practicable monitoring solution for regional soil moisture. Temporal process and spatial extension of the Drought were firstly estimated with ground meteorological and hydrological observations. Then, for the whole region of Sichuan and Chongqing, the remotely sensed Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) for the summers of 2001 - 2006 were calculated based on 8 -day composite MODIS products, which were further used to construct a new water index (Normalized Difference Water Deviation Index, NDWDI) to examine the sensitivity of remote sensing in the Drought. The study showed that the NDWDI is more sensitive to regional drought than other absolute-soil-moisture-based indices. With the new index, the study extracted the spatial-temporal characteristics of the 2006 Drought, and explored its developing and withdrawing processes, which agreed with related statistics. Compared with <b>ground</b> method of <b>drought</b> observation, the NDWDI-based remote sensing solution of this paper is more preferable and practicable in that the local soil properties of water consumption and supply are implicitly taken into account, and the spatial representativity limit of ground observation is circumvented to a degree as satellite remotely senses the earth surface in a way of two-dimensional pixel matrix. So, the NDWDI-based method can be used to monitor regional soil water stress situation more practically and efficiently. © Science in China 2008...|$|R
40|$|This study {{assessed}} {{the impacts of}} climate change and variability on crop production and its implications to food security in Mvomero District, Tanzania. Large {{part of the study}} area has already experienced food insecurity. A sample size of 7 % of all household heads were sampled at random from the two villages and interviewed through questionnaires. Also; FGD, interview with key informants and participant observation survey were used to collect data. Rainfall and temperature data were collected from Kongwa and Kinyasungwe meteological stations, and from farmers. Data were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 12 and MS-Excel. The analyzed data were presented into tables and figures. Analysis show that the trend based on mean annual rainfall data provide general impression which may not capture actual situation on the <b>ground</b> particularly on <b>droughts</b> and associated crop failures in the field. Hence, the number of wet spells were analysed. The result show that there is no correlation between the amount of rainfall and the number of wet spells. The study area has been recording high rainfall with fewer wetspells and the vice versa. Also, it has been found that a good number of wet spells which are fairly distributed within a growing season is a good determinant factor for better crop production due to sustainabililty of moisture. Also, an increase in temperature leads to severe drought due to evapotranspiration. Severe drought has lead to poor crop yields and subsequently food insecurity. Therefore, to ensure food security; adaptation measures and coping mechanisms are recommended, some of these include; the use of drought resistant crops, irrigation, mixed farming, and implementation of seasonal climate forecasting.

40|$|The heat {{of summer}} 2003 in Western and Central Europe was {{claimed to be}} {{unprecedented}} since the Middle Ages {{on the basis of}} grape harvest data (GHD) and late wood maximum density (MXD) data from trees in the Alps. This paper shows that the authors of these studies overlooked the fact that the heat and drought in Switzerland in 1540 likely exceeded the amplitude of the previous hottest summer of 2003, because the persistent temperature and precipitation anomaly in that year, described in an abundant and coherent body of documentary evidence, severely affected the reliability of GHD and tree-rings as proxy-indicators for temperature estimates. Spring–summer (AMJJ) temperature anomalies of 4. 7 °C to 6. 8 °C being significantly higher than in 2003 were assessed for 1540 from a new long Swiss GHD series (1444 to 2011). During the climax of the heat wave in early August the grapes desiccated on the vine, which caused many vine-growers to interrupt or postpone the harvest despite full grape maturity until after the next spell of rain. Likewise, the leaves of many trees withered and fell to the <b>ground</b> under extreme <b>drought</b> stress as would usually be expected in late autumn. It remains to be determined by further research whether and how far this result obtained from local analyses can be spatially extrapolated. Based on the temperature estimates for Switzerland it is assumed from a great number of coherent qualitative documentary evidence about the outstanding heat drought in 1540 that AMJJ temperatures were likely more extreme in neighbouring regions of Western and Central Europe than in 2003. Considering the significance of soil moisture deficits for record breaking heat waves, these results still need to be validated with estimated seasonal precipitation. It is concluded that biological proxy data may not properly reveal record breaking heat and drought events. Such assessments thus need to be complemented with the critical study of contemporary evidence from documentary sources which provide coherent and detailed data about weather extremes and related impacts on human, ecological and social systems...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} an {{investigation}} of drought resistance of willow SRC genotypes. Experiments were conducted at Silsoe, Bedfordshire, in pots and field trials in 2002 and in lysimeters in 2003 to evaluate the range of water use efficiency (WUE) of 50 willows varieties (Salix sp.) and isolate morpho-physiological traits related to WUE and drought resistance. Within the genotype pool tested there was {{a wide range of}} responses. The results depict the morpho-physiology of an ideal candidate that plant breeding could produce for drier area of UK, which are summarised below. Its cuttings do not develop calluses when stored in darkness at + 4 °C. After planting, the candidate does not grow rapidly but has an early exponential phase of stem elongation, after a year of growth it has few stems per stool (8) hairless leaves are characterised by small adaxial epidermal cells (AECS < 330 µm 2). The ideal candidate prioritises less biomass to its root system (root/shoot < 0. 8) mainly in the top 0. 2 m. When grown under optimum condition, the large leaf area has high stomatal conductance and leaf temperature. As water stress progresses, the leaf area decreases leaving little time for leaves to senesce and few yellow leaves remain on the stems. The stomatal conductance decreases slowly and the leaf temperature is almost unaffected. If water stress occurs before August the candidate is able to recover faster the initial physiological state and grow new leaves when re-watered. The results indicate that the best parents to produce such candidate are S. viminalis and S. schwerinii or their related hybrids. Water use (WU) of high yielding willow short rotation coppice hybrids is similar which indicates that the opportunity to reduce WU is limited and that productivity can be only improved by increasing WUE to produce above <b>ground</b> biomass and <b>drought</b> resistance. The current willow breeding programme has great chance to produce hybrids with high WUE however the production of a progeny population from high yielding hybrids that contrast widely in resistance to water stress is recommended. In theory, from such a population, valuable data on morpho-physiological traits related to drought resistance and high WUE can be collected and help genomics to develop quantitative trait loci to the condition that reference hybrids are grown along to quantify the level of water stress experienced by the planting.
