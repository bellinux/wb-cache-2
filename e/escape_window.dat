40|$|Little {{is known}} about the size {{selectivity}} of cod in static fishing gears such as pots and traps. In this field study, floating fishing pots were equipped with 40, 45 and 50 mm square mesh escape windows in order to estimate the size selectivity of cod at different mesh sizes. Relationships between selectivity parameters and mesh size, as well as an optimal mesh size for the <b>escape</b> <b>window</b> with respect to current minimum landing size of cod in the Baltic Sea were sought. The results show that the floating pot is not only species selective when used in the Baltic Sea cod fishery, the implementation of an <b>escape</b> <b>window</b> reduced the proportion of undersized bycatch in the pots by more than 90 %. The estimated length at 50 % retention was found to be a direct function of fish body length (girth) and mesh size of the <b>escape</b> <b>window,</b> while the estimated selection range remained unchanged regardless of mesh size. Optimal mesh size, with respect to the length at 50 % retention and current minimal landing size of 38 cm in the Baltic, was determined to be 45 mm. Strong indications (significant on the 0. 01 probability level in the case of 50 and 40 mm escape windows) suggested that the relative fishing power of the pots increased with the implementation of an <b>escape</b> <b>window.</b> This result could be explained as a "saturation effect", i. e. the probability of cod entering the pot is likely to be negatively dependent on cod density in the pot. The high species selectivity and the low catch rate of undersized fish have consolidated the floating pots position as a highly benign fishing method and the foremost alternative gear for the future coastal cod fishery in the Baltic Sea.

40|$|We {{present a}} master {{equation}} {{approach to the}} narrow escape time (NET) problem, i. e. the time needed for a particle contained in a confining domain with a single narrow opening, to exit the domain for the first time. We introduce a finite transition probability, ν, at the narrow <b>escape</b> <b>window</b> allowing {{the study of the}} imperfect trapping case. Ranging from 0 to ∞, ν allowed the study of both extremes of the trapping process: that of a highly deficient capture, and situations where escape is certain ("perfect trapping" case). We have obtained analytic results for the basic quantity studied in the NET problem, the mean escape time (MET), and we have studied its dependence in terms of the transition (desorption) probability over (from) the surface boundary, the confining domain dimensions, and the finite transition probability at the <b>escape</b> <b>window.</b> Particularly we show that the existence of a global minimum in the NET depends on the `imperfection' of the trapping process. In addition to our analytical approach, we have implemented Monte Carlo simulations, finding excellent agreement between the theoretical results and simulations. Comment: 9 page...|$|E

40|$|To {{improve the}} cod {{stocks in the}} Baltic Sea, a number of {{regulations}} have recently been established by the International Baltic Sea Fisheries Commission (IBSFC) and the European Commission. According to these, fishermen are obliged to use nets with escape windows (BACOMA nets) with a mesh size of the <b>escape</b> <b>window</b> of 120 mm until end of September 2003. These nets however, retain only fish {{much larger than the}} legal minimum landing size would al-low. Due to the present stock structure only few of such large fish are however existent. As a consequence fishermen use a legal alternative net. This is a conventional trawl with a cod-end of 130 mm diamond-shaped meshes (IBSFC-rules of 1 st April 2002), to be increased to 140 mm on 1 st September 2003, according to the mentioned IBSFC-rule. Due legal alterations of the net by the fishermen (e. g. use of extra stiff net material) these nets have acquired extremely low selective properties, i. e. they catch very small fish and produce great amounts of discards. Due to the increase of the minimum landing size from 35 to 38 cm for cod in the Baltic, the amount of discards has even increased since the beginning of 2003. Experiments have now been carried out with the BACOMAnet on German and Swedish commercial and research vessels since arguments were brought forward that the BACOMA net was not yet sufficiently tested on commercial vessels. The results of all experiments conducted so far, are compiled and evaluated here. As a result of the Swedish, Danish and German initiative and research the European Commission reacted upon this in June 2003 and rejected the increase of the diamond-meshed non-BACOMA net from 130 mm to 140 mm in September 2003. To protect the cod stocks in the Baltic Sea more effectively the use of traditional diamond meshed cod-ends with-out <b>escape</b> <b>window</b> are prohibited in community waters without derogation, becoming effective 1 st of September 2003. To enable more effective and simplified control of the bottom trawl fishery in the Baltic Sea the principle of a ”One-Net-Rule“ is enforced. This {{is going to be the}} BACOMA net, with the meshes of the <b>escape</b> <b>window</b> being 110 mm for the time being. The description of the BACOMA net as given in the IBSFC-rules no. 10 (revision of the 28 th session, Berlin 2002) concentrates on the cod-end and the <b>escape</b> <b>window</b> but only to a less extent on the design and mesh-composition of the remaining parts of the net, such as belly and funnel and many details. Thus, the present description is not complete and leaves, according to fishermen, ample opportunity for manipulation. An initiative has been started in Germany with joint effort from scientists and the fishery to better describe the entire net and to produce a proposal for a more comprehensive description, leaving less space for manipulation. A proposal in this direction is given here and shall be seen as a starting point for a discussion and development towards an internationally uniform net, which is agreed amongst the fishery, scientists and politicians. The Baltic Sea fishery is invited to comment on this proposal, and recommendations for further improvement and specifications are welcomed. Once the design is agreed by the Baltic Fishermen Association, it shall be proposed to the IBSFC and European Commission via the Baltic Fishermen Association. ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{study the}} mean first exit time (Tε) of a {{particle}} diffusing {{in a circular}} or a spherical micro-domain with an impenetrable confining boundary containing a small <b>escape</b> <b>window</b> (EW) of an angular size ε. Focusing {{on the effects of}} an energy/entropy barrier at the EW, and of the long-range interactions (LRIs) with the boundary on the diffusive search for the EW, we develop a self-consistent approximation to derive for Tε a general expression, akin to the celebrated Collins–Kimball relation in chemical kinetics and accounting for both rate-controlling factors in an explicit way. Our analysis reveals that the barrier-induced contribution to Tε is the dominant one in the limit ε → 0, implying that the narrow escape problem is not “diffusion-limited” but rather “barrier-limited”. We present the small-ε expansion for Tε, in which the coefficients in front of the leading terms are expressed via some integrals and derivatives of the LRI potential. Considering a triangular-well potential as an example, we show that Tε is non-monotonic with respect to the extent of the attractive LRI, being minimal for the ones having an intermediate extent, neither too concentrated on the boundary nor penetrating too deeply into the bulk. Our analytical predictions are in good agreement with the numerical simulations...|$|E

During October, November, and December 1998 cruise measurements with the gamma-ray spectrometer {{were made at}} three different escape-window-width settings. These were done {{in order to understand}} how the count rate and peak width change as the window width settings change. Analysis of these spectra was completed using the latest version of the spectral analysis program, RobWin. Results as a function of energy were combined with the results from the Schlumberger-Doll Research experiments (described below). Laboratory measurements were needed to confirm efficiency calculations above 6 MeV and to understand the relationship between the full energy peak areas and the areas of the first and second escape peaks {{as a function of the}} escape peak widths. A week of measurements was made at Schlumberger-Doll Research using their 14 -MeV pulsed neutron generator and large soil samples. Data were collected after adding iron and nickel to the sample to increase the emission of high-energy lines. Approximately 24 hours of data were accumulated at each of three escape peak window widths. These data were analyzed with RobWin. Combining results from the cruise measurements and the laboratory measurements indicated that both data sets had similar energy dependence and that this energy dependence was different from that obtained using standard Monte Carlo calculations.

Although EU regulations make the use of the BACOMA codend mandatory in the Baltic Sea cod areable to escape through square mesh <b>escape</b> <b>window</b> of the BACOMA net the whereas flatfish still remain in the cod-end. Gear experiments have been carried out with the aim to better separate cod from the flatfish fraction already when entering the rear belly, making use of the natural behaviour of the fish, i. e. the preferred swimming distance {{from the bottom of the}} net in the funnel. As cod have a natural tendency to keep a relativly great distance from the bottom, flatfish tend to stay close to it. It was attempted to separate both fractions by splitting the funnel into an upper and lower part with a horizontal panel. This wastested for two different nets, a cod trawl to separate cod from flatfish, and an eel-trawl to separate cod and flatfish from eel. Cod and flatfish separation is best at a panel distance of 50 cm from the bottom. Thus, 74 % of the cod were found in the upper panel, whereas 75 % of the flounder were in the lower section. A separation of eel from cod was however not possible, since eel tend to rise to the upper part of the net, together with cod...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} the gravitational lensing of rays emitted by a compact object (CO) within a distribution of plasma with power-law density ∝ r^-h. For the simplest {{case of a}} cloud of spherically symmetric cold non-magnetized plasma, the diverging effect of the plasma and the converging effect of gravitational lensing compete with one another. When h< 2, the plasma effect dominates over the vacuum Schwarzschild curvature, potentially shifting the radius of the unstable circular photon orbit outside {{the surface of the}} CO. When this occurs, we define two relatively narrow radio-frequency bands in which plasma effects are particularly significant. Rays in the <b>escape</b> <b>window</b> have ω_ 0 < ω≤ω_+ and are free to propagate to infinity from the CO surface. To a distant observer, the visible portion of the CO surface appears to shrink as the observed frequency is reduced, and vanishes entirely at ω_ 0, in excess of the plasma frequency at the CO surface. We define the anomalous propagation window for frequencies ω_-< ω≤ω_ 0. Rays emitted from the CO surface within this frequency range are dominated by optical effects from the plasma and curve back {{to the surface of the}} CO, effectively cloaking the star from distant observers. We conclude with a study of neutron star (NS) compactness ratios for a variety of nuclear matter equations of state (EoS). For h= 1, NSs generated from stiff EoS should display significant frequency dependence in the EW, and lower values of h with softer EoS can also show these effects. Comment: 10 pages, 4 figures.

40|$|Swarm {{robotics}} {{is a field}} {{dedicated to}} the study of the design and development of certain multi-robot systems. Often times, these groups prove to be more beneficial than a single complex robot as swarms typically provide a more robust and potentially more efficient solution. One such case is the task of escorting a specified target while addressing any potential threats discovered in the environment. In this work, a control algorithm for a high volume, decentralized, homogeneous robot swarm was developed based upon a technique commonly used to model incompressible fluids known as Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH). This proposed solution to the asset protection problem was tested against a more commonly accepted method for robot navigation known as potential fields. An alternate algorithm was developed based on this technique and manipulated to perform the same basic duty of asset protection. Both algorithms were tested in simulation using ARGoS as an environment and Swarmanoid’s Footbots as robot models. Five experiments were run in order to examine the functionality of both of these algorithms in relation to formation control and the protection of a mobile asset from mobile threats. The results proved the proposed SPH based algorithm comparable to the potential fields based method while minimizing the <b>escape</b> <b>window</b> and having a slightly higher response rate to introduced threats. These results hint that the concept of using fluid models for control of high volume swarms should further be explored and seriously considered as a potential solution to the asset protection problem...|$|E
