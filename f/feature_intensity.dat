In {{terms of}} moving least squares surface, the sampling likelihood for each point on point-sampled surfaces is computed, which measures {{the probability that}} a 3 D point is located on the sampled surface. Based on the normal tensor voting, the <b>feature</b> <b>intensity</b> of sample point is evaluated. By applying the modified bilateral filtering to each normal, and in combination with sampling likelihood and <b>feature</b> <b>intensity,</b> the filtered point-sampled surfaces are obtained.

40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} generic {{framework}} to track shapes across large variations by learning non-linear shape manifold as overlapping, piecewise linear subspaces. We use landmark based shape analysis to train a Gaussian mixture model over the aligned shapes and learn a Point Distribution Model(PDM) {{for each of}} the mixture components. The target shape is searched by first maximizing the mixture probability density for the local <b>feature</b> <b>intensity</b> profiles along the normal followed by constraining the global shape using the most probable PDM cluster. The feature shapes are robustly tracked across multiple frames by dynamically switching between the PDMs. Our contribution is to apply ASM to the task of tracking shapes involving wide aspect changes and generic movements. This is achieved by incorporating shape priors that are learned over non-linear shape space and using them to learn the plausible shape space. We demonstrate the results on tracking facial features and provide several empirical results to validate our approach. Our framework runs close to real time at 25 frames per second and can be extended to predict pose angles using Mixture of Experts. ...|$|E

With AKARI, we performed near-infrared (2. 5 - 4. 5 um) spectroscopic observations of 34 regions in M 82 including its northern and southern halos. Results. Many of the spectra show strong emission at 3. 3 um due to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and relatively weak features at 3. 4 - 3. 6 um due to aliphatic hydrocarbons. In particular, we clearly detect the PAH 3. 3 um emission and the 3. 4 - 3. 6 um features in halo regions, which are located {{at a distance of}} 2 kpc away from the galactic center.

40|$|Numerical {{estimation}} {{of the size of}} the kidney is useful in evaluating conditions of the kidney, especially, when serial MR imaging is performed to evaluate the kidney function. This paper presents a new method for automatic segmentation of the kidney in three-dimensional (3 D) MR images, by extracting texture features and statistical matching of geometrical shape of the kidney. A set of Wavelet-based support vector machines (W-SVMs) is trained on the MR images. The W-SVMs capture texture priors of MRI for classification of the kidney and non-kidney tissues in different zones around the kidney boundary. In the segmentation procedure, these W-SVMs are trained to tentatively label each voxel around the kidney model as a kidney or non-kidney voxel by texture matching. A probability kidney model is created using 10 segmented MRI data. The model is initially localized based on the intensity profiles in three directions. The weight functions are defined for each labeled voxel for each Wavelet-based, intensity-based, and model-based label. Consequently, each voxel has three labels and three weights for the Wavelet <b>feature,</b> <b>intensity,</b> and probability model. Using a 3 D edge detection method, the model is re-localized and the segmented kidney is modified based on a region growing method in the model region. The probability model is re-localized based on the results and this loop continues until the segmentation converges. Experimental results with mouse MRI data show the good performance of the proposed method in segmenting the kidney in MR images...|$|E

The {{purpose of this paper is}} to present a model that investigates the relationship between conflict types (task, relationship and process), conflict <b>features</b> (<b>intensity</b> and duration), communication openness (CO) and workplace trust. Design/methodology/approach – Data were collected from 510 employees from public sector organizations. The authors tested the direct effects of the hypothesized links with linear regressions while the mediation effects were tested using the Sobel test. Finally, the authors followed Kenny and Baron 2 ̆ 7 s procedure to test the moderation effects. Findings – Results from the regression analyses confirm that conflict <b>features</b> (<b>intensity</b> and duration) fully mediated the link between conflict types (task, relationship and process) and trust, while CO moderated the relationship between conflict features and trust. In addition, prolonged conflict duration was linked with trust. Implications of the findings are discussed. Research limitations/implications – The study is cross sectional and some of our scales have few items. In future, more robust scales in a longitudinal study should be used to further deepen our understanding of the association between the variables in our model. In addition, we have studied the concept of trust as perceived by the employees without distinguishing between high- and low-trust perceptions. Future studies should compare levels of trust associated with the different types of conflict and especially varying magnitude of conflict intensity (e. g. low, mid and high) at different times. Originality/value – The study provides new insights into the influence that conflict (task, relationship and process) may have on trust and the moderating role of CO in the link between conflict and trust.
