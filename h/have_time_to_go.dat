25|$|On {{board the}} rocket, the {{collapse}} of the gravity field causes Toby to reveal the mind of the Beast is still possessing him as he taunts the others while breathing out fire. Rose takes Captain Zach's bolt gun and shoots out the rocket's front window, unhooking Toby's safety harness to jettison the possessed man into space towards the black hole. The cabin is sealed by automatic shields but the rocket still lacks the power to escape the gravity well. Suddenly their ride smooths out and the rocket turns away from the black hole. The Doctor contacts Captain Zach, telling him that he is towing the rocket to safety with the TARDIS. The Doctor asks for Rose and jokingly offers to trade Zach back Ida, whom he rescued from the planet caverns, for Rose. The Doctor reports he did not <b>have</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back and save the Ood, who were innocent victims of the Beast's possession. Once safe, the respective crews depart on their separate ways. As they return to Earth, Captain Zach reads off the list of personnel that died, including the Ood.|$|E
500|$|Milo says {{goodbye and}} drives {{back through the}} tollbooth. Suddenly he is back in his own room, and discovers he has been gone only an hour, though his journey seemed to take weeks. He awakens {{the next day with}} plans to return to the kingdom, but finds the tollbooth gone when he gets home from school. A note instead is there, [...] "For Milo, who now knows the way." [...] The note states that the tollbooth is being sent to another child who needs help finding his {{direction}} in life. Milo is somewhat disappointed but agrees and looks at a now-interesting world around him, concluding that even if he found a way back, he might not <b>have</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>go,</b> for {{there is so much to}} do right where he is.|$|E
2500|$|Originally, Meyer wrote a {{book titled}} Forever Dawn, which was a direct sequel to Twilight. While the basic storyline {{remained}} the same, Forever Dawn was narrated completely from Edward's point of view, the werewolves and Jacob were [...] "only sketchily developed", Victoria and Laurent were both alive, {{and there was an}} epilogue. Meyer {{went on to say that}} she [...] "may post some extras someday if I ever <b>have</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back through the Forever Dawn manuscript—it's just as long as Breaking Dawn." ...|$|E

60|$|She ran forward, and Maxwell {{followed}} at his usual pace, {{so that she}} <b>had</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> inside and come out with the despatch before he mounted the veranda steps.|$|R
60|$|As {{there were}} just then no {{passengers}} wishing passage over the bridge, Ralph {{decided to leave the}} draw open for a few minutes, until the boat <b>had</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> through.|$|R
2500|$|According to Snowden, {{he did not}} indiscriminately {{turn over}} {{documents}} to journalists, stating that [...] "I carefully evaluated every single document I disclosed to ensure that each was legitimately in the public interest. There {{are all sorts of}} documents that would have made a big impact that I didn't turn over" [...] and that [...] "I have to screen everything before releasing it to journalists ... If I <b>have</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> through this information, I would like to make it available to journalists in each country." [...] Despite these measures, the improper redaction of a document by The New York Times resulted in the exposure of intelligence activity against al-Qaeda.|$|E

6000|$|... "You {{must have}} stayed in the train a good while after it stopped!" [...] cried the young girl with her little laugh. [...] "I suppose you were asleep. You <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> see Mrs. Walker." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{was still}} so early that Theodora <b>had</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> church; as usual, {{she met the}} Brandons; and Lady Elizabeth, much {{concerned}} at her tidings, came home with her {{to see how the}} patient was going on.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, no, no, no," [...] cried Betty in agonized tones, and {{wringing}} her hands. Then, excitedly, [...] "Something can be done; {{you must}} pursue them. Oh, Lew, Mr. Clarke, cannot you rescue him? They <b>have</b> not <b>had</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> far." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now I shall <b>have</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to the Gymnasium and {{straighten}} out my back," [...] said Frank, who was growing so tall he needed more breadth {{to make his}} height symmetrical.|$|E
6000|$|... "See {{that this}} man be {{securely}} confined until we <b>have</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> deeper into this affair," [...] he commanded, [...] "and as bars alone seem inadequate to restrain him, let chains be added." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, and {{my father}} put his arm out of joint to <b>have</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> courting," [...] said Jan Coggan, in an eclipsing tone, wiping {{his face with his}} shirt-sleeve and {{thrusting}} back his hat upon the nape of his neck.|$|E
6000|$|... "Run, run!" [...] The cry echoed {{from all}} sides, and, {{almost in a}} twinkling, Clink was down to first, and racing for second. Then, feeling that he <b>had</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> further, he bounded onward, and slid safely to third.|$|R
6000|$|Rowland sprang up, protesting, {{but before}} he <b>had</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> far one of the scanty portieres was raised, and Madame Grandoni came in, pulling her wig straight. [...] "But you shall believe in me yet," [...] murmured Christina, as she passed toward her hostess.|$|R
5000|$|Anitta {{confessed to}} the press that the [...] "Show das Poderosas Tour" [...] is an old result of hard work of many people dream, beyond the artist, has over 120 people {{involved}} in the production, it is speculated, can cost up to £ 60,000 per show. She does not confirm the value, but also does not deny when questioned says not <b>having</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the office to see these things, but admits that is what it says there.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, your husband, to be sure; don't he {{take his}} turn in sitting? If he don't, he ought to. I shall {{speak to him}} about it. My husband always sits {{regularly}} half the time, that I may <b>have</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> about and exercise." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{driving the}} Professor in his automobile," [...] Craig explained. [...] "It {{occurred}} to me that if he were going to be long here, I should <b>have</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> and order another tire. It is of no consequence, though. I will go down and wait in the car." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{came home}} pretty sharp. I {{thought it best}} not to shock her Grace by too great a stretch into the night. As it is you will <b>have</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to bed {{for an hour or}} two before you dress. That's what I do when I am in time. You'll be right as a trivet then." ...|$|E
60|$|When {{you give}} your lectures at the Working Men's College, is it your habit to refer to special {{pictures}} in the National Gallery, or to special works {{of art in the}} British Museum?--Never; I try to keep whatever instruction I give bearing upon what is easily accessible to the workman, or what he can see at the moment. I do not count upon his <b>having</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> these institutions; I like to put the thing in his hand, and have it about.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{seems as}} if I'd <b>had</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> across the whole country since I saw you last. Say, give me some water and a mouthful of {{anything}} that's eatable, an' then I'll get a little sleep before tacklin' Cummings again. I suppose its a case of goin' way down on my marrow bones before he'll forget what I've done." ...|$|R
60|$|Marco {{said that}} he was very sorry that he <b>had</b> not <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> and get his fishing-pole.|$|R
6000|$|... "All right," [...] said Val; [...] "I shall <b>have</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> and {{see that}} fellow." [...] And, parting from them abruptly, he ran {{down the stairs and}} out into the air. He bolted into a hansom, and drove to the Goat's Club. His {{thoughts}} were on Holly and what he must do before her brother showed her this thing in to-morrow's paper.|$|E
60|$|LORD SUMMERHAYS. [shaking hands] Yes: I {{should have}} come sooner. But I'm still rather lost in England. [Johnny takes his hat and hangs it up beside his own]. Thank you. [Johnny returns to his swing and his novel. Lord Summerhays comes to the writing table]. The fact is that as Ive nothing to do, I never <b>have</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> anywhere. [He sits down next Mrs Tarleton].|$|E
6000|$|... "We are too few for that," [...] the Doctor said. [...] "Besides, {{although}} Bathurst {{answers for}} the good faith of the sender of the warning, there has as yet been no act of mutiny that would justify our taking such a step as that. It {{would come to the}} same thing. We might kill a good many, {{but in the long run}} three hundred men would be more than a match for a dozen, and then the women would be at their mercy. Well, we had better be moving, or we shall not <b>have</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> round to the bungalows before the people set out for the Major's." ...|$|E
40|$|I haven't <b>had</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> {{through the}} {{transport}} select committee report on HS 2 in much detail. The committee {{has chosen to}} focus mostly on the capacity issue as {{making the case for}} HS 2 (as the wider environmental and other benefits are widely disputed). One thing that immediately strikes me, however, is that the 'capacity constraint' argument that they use may not be as strong as the report makes out...|$|R
5000|$|Sixten is a screenwriter who reluctantly {{travels to}} a ski resort in Åre {{to prepare a}} love story in a ski {{environment}} for a film. Before he <b>has</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> a journalist from a tabloid newspaper, Vivi Bostrom, calls him {{to ask him about}} his plans. They end up immediately quarrelling. She then takes the train to Åre and does her best to get back at him. Revenge will be sweet, and snowy.|$|R
60|$|But he <b>had</b> just <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> {{straight}} <b>to</b> Malvina. He {{laughed as}} he took {{her in his arms}} and kissed her full upon the lips.|$|R
60|$|This was Mok, who {{was much}} less of a fool than Cheditafa took him for. He had {{calculated}} that he would <b>have</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to the Black Cat and drink two glasses of beer before Ralph was likely to appear, and he also {{made up his mind}} that two glasses were {{as much as he could}} dispose of without exciting the suspicions of the young man. Therefore, he had attended to the business that had taken him out of doors on that rainy night, and was returning to the hotel with a lofty consciousness of having done wrong in a very wise and satisfactory manner.|$|E
6000|$|... "It would, sir, I quite felt that, but {{it seemed}} to me the only {{possible}} thing to do. Of course, if I had known that the boats would have come early in the evening, I should have remained on board and beat them off before making a landing, although our chances of success would then have been much smaller. The party who were to attack in the boats were to have been composed of men from the plantation. Their comrades would doubtless have come down to the shore to see us captured, and when they saw their friends beaten off they would have been on the watch, and not improbably, in their fury and disappointment, have massacred all the captives in their hands at once. But I thought it likely that the boats would not put off before they believed us to be asleep, and that I should therefore <b>have</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> up to the plantation and fetch the captives down before they arrived. At any rate, by moving the schooner close inshore I hoped that the boats might not find her. There was no moon, and under the shadow of the rock it was next to impossible to see her, unless a boat happened to pass within a few paces. Having struck the topmasts, the forest behind on steep ground prevented the masts from showing above the sky-line. It was, of course, the choice of two evils, and I took the one that seemed to me to give the greater promise of success." ...|$|E
60|$|After breakfast, we all walked out, and, {{crossing}} the English Bridge, {{looked at the}} Severn over its parapet. The river is here broader than elsewhere, and very shallow, and has an island covered with bushes, about midway across. Just over the bridge we saw a church, of red freestone, and evidently very ancient. This is the Church of the Holy Cross, and is {{a portion of the}} Abbey of St. Peter and St. John, which formerly covered ten acres of ground. We did not <b>have</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> into the church; but the windows and other points of architecture, so far as we could discern them, and knew how to admire them, were exceedingly venerable and beautiful. On {{the other side of the}} street, over a wide space, there are other remains of the old abbey; and the most interesting was a stone pulpit, now standing in the open air, seemingly in a garden, but which originally stood in the refectory of the abbey, and was the station whence one of the monks read to his brethren at their meals. The pulpit is much overgrown with ivy. We should have made further researches among these remains, though they seem now to be in private grounds; but a large mastiff came nut of his kennel, and, approaching us to the length of his iron chain, began barking very fiercely. Nor had we time to see half that we would gladly have seen and studied here and elsewhere about Shrewsbury. It would have been very interesting to have visited Hotspur's and Falstaff's battle-field, which is four miles from the town; too distant, certainly, for Falstaff to have measured the length of the fight by Shrewsbury clock. There is now a church, built there by Henry IV., and said to cover the bones of those slain in the battle.|$|E

60|$|June 24.--I was {{detained}} {{late in the}} Court, but still <b>had</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> with Adam Wilson and call upon a gentlemanlike East Indian officer, called Colonel Francklin, who appears an intelligent and respectable man. He writes the History of Captain Thomas,[347] a person of the condition of a common seaman, who raised himself {{to the rank of}} a native prince, and for some time waged a successful war with the powers around him. The work must be entertaining.|$|R
