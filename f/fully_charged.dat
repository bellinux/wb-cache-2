5|$|Alisia {{attacks by}} {{shooting}} streaks of lightning from her hands. The attack automatically targets enemies in range but gets weaker with each volley as Alisia's power is depleted. Her power recharges when she stops attacking; when <b>fully</b> <b>charged,</b> it {{allows her to}} unleash a multi-target attack, hitting every enemy on the screen. The energy system introduces an element of strategy, encouraging the player to manage Alisia's power to have her able to defend herself at critical moments.|$|E

5|$|The Volt {{features}} OnStar Mobile {{application for}} owners to access vehicle information without being {{in or near}} the car. This smartphone application features the ability to check fuel efficiency as well as the vehicle's current electric range. It also helps monitor the charging, giving owners key information about the current charge level and the amount of time it will take until it is <b>fully</b> <b>charged.</b> The application also is able to control features such as locking/unlocking doors, and acts as a remote starter. A five-year OnStar Directions and Connections service was bundled into the 2011 Volt's base price, which was reduced to three years for the 2012 model year.|$|E

50|$|On a full charge, {{the battery}} {{provides}} {{four hours of}} constant use or 24 hours on standby. It takes four hours to <b>fully</b> <b>charge</b> and {{is designed to be}} charged each night.|$|R
25|$|Standard {{capacitors}} {{with constant}} internal resistance <b>fully</b> <b>charge</b> during about 5τ. Since internal resistance increases with charge/discharge, actual times cannot be calculated with this formula. Thus, charge/discharge time depends on specific individual construction details.|$|R
25|$|If {{a charger}} cannot detect when the battery is <b>fully</b> <b>charged</b> then {{overcharging}} is likely, damaging it.|$|E
25|$|A battery {{swapping}} (or switching) {{station is}} a place at which a vehicle's discharged battery or battery pack can be immediately swapped for a <b>fully</b> <b>charged</b> one, eliminating the delay involved in waiting for the vehicle's battery to charge.|$|E
25|$|A {{cordless}} {{electric screwdriver}} with supercapacitors for energy storage has {{about half the}} run time of a comparable battery model, but can be <b>fully</b> <b>charged</b> in 90 seconds. It retains 85% of its charge after three months left idle.|$|E
50|$|In 2014, StoreDot {{announced}} {{it had started}} working on a technology called multifunction electrode (MFE), that will enable future electric vehicles to <b>fully</b> <b>charge</b> in only 5 minutes. The MFE {{is a combination of}} a conductive polymer and metal oxide.|$|R
50|$|There are no known, {{independently}} verified ways {{to reverse}} sulfation. There are commercial products claiming to achieve desulfation through various techniques (such as pulse charging), {{but there are}} no peer-reviewed publications verifying their claims. Sulfation prevention remains the best course of action, by periodically <b>fully</b> <b>charging</b> the lead-acid batteries.|$|R
50|$|The cityZENN was {{a planned}} fully certified, highway capable vehicle {{with a top}} speed of 125 km/h and a range of 400 km. Powered by EEStor, the cityZENN would have been {{rechargeable}} in less than 5 minutes, feature operating costs 1/10 of a typical internal combustion engine vehicle and be 100% emission-free at the point of use. The cityZENN was designed to meet the transportation requirements of a large percentage of drivers worldwide. Ian Clifford, CEO of ZENN Motor Company, also stated that a normal household outlet with 110 volt supply would <b>fully</b> <b>charge</b> the EEStor powered CityZENN in 4 hours, and a normal household outlet with 220 volt supply can <b>fully</b> <b>charge</b> the EEStor powered CityZENN in 2 hours. The 5 minute fast charge would only be possible at special charge stations.CityZENN target price was $25000 - $30000.|$|R
25|$|Electric {{propulsion}} {{was introduced}} in mid-2014 and allows self-launching. A handful have been sold (and some were retrofitted to earlier sold models). Takeoff roll distance is 50 m and rate of climb when <b>fully</b> <b>charged</b> is 2.5 m/s. It can run at full power for 11 min on one charge. The electrical motor uses 10.5kW at 3800 rpm, and propeller delivers 37 daN when flying at 75 km/h. Storage is a 14s1p Lithium polymer battery (Kokam) with 40Ah capacity, delivering 2.07 kWh, maximum 58.8V and maximum continuous current 200A.|$|E
25|$|The battery {{capacity}} of a <b>fully</b> <b>charged</b> electric vehicle from electric vehicle automakers (such as Nissan) is about 20kWh, providing it with an electrical autonomy of about 100 miles. Tesla Motors initially released their Model S with battery capacities of 40kWh, 60kWh and 85kWh with the latter having an estimated range of approximately 480km; as of May 2017 they have three models, 70kWh, 90kWh and 100kWh. Plug in hybrid vehicles have capacity of roughly 3 to 5kWh, for an electrical autonomy of 20 to 40 kilometres, but the gasoline engine ensures the full autonomy of a conventional vehicle.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{the course}} of a river, the total volume of water transported {{downstream}} will often be a combination of the visible free water flow together with a substantial contribution flowing through rocks and sediments that underlie the river and its floodplain called the hyporheic zone. For many rivers in large valleys, this unseen component of flow may greatly exceed the visible flow. The hyporheic zone often forms a dynamic interface between surface water and groundwater from aquifers, exchanging flow between rivers and aquifers that may be <b>fully</b> <b>charged</b> or depleted. This is especially significant in karst areas where pot-holes and underground rivers are common.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fully</b> <b>charging</b> a NiFe cell {{consists}} of seven {{hours at the}} normal cell rate. In service the amount of charge given is governed by {{the extent of the}} previous discharge. For example, a battery discharged one-half, allows a 3.5 hour normal rate charge. Overcharging wastes current and causes rapid evaporation of the water in the electrolyte.|$|R
50|$|The C-310 Zoom {{is powered}} by either a {{proprietary}} rechargeable Lithium-ion battery, which takes {{a couple of hours}} to <b>fully</b> <b>charge,</b> or 2 x AA Ni-MH/Alkaline rechargeable batteries. The camera features PictBridge compatibility, allowing direct printing with compatible printers. It also incorporates USB 2.0 Full Speed (12 Mbit/s) Auto Connect interface to connect the camera to a computer.|$|R
5000|$|MIT {{introduced}} a new coating that allows the ions to move more easily within the battery. The [...] "Beltway Battery" [...] utilizes a bypass system that allows the lithium ions to enter and leave the electrodes at a speed great enough to <b>fully</b> <b>charge</b> a battery in under a minute. The scientists discovered that by coating lithium iron phosphate particles in a glassy material called lithium pyrophosphate, ions bypass the channels and move faster than in other batteries. Rechargeable batteries store and discharge energy as charged atoms (ions) are moved between two electrodes, the anode and the cathode. Their charge and discharge rate are restricted by {{the speed with which}} these ions move. Such technology could reduce the weight and size of the batteries. A small prototype battery cell has been developed that can <b>fully</b> <b>charge</b> in 10 to 20 seconds, compared with six minutes for standard battery cells.|$|R
25|$|In combat, {{the player}} can manage the ship's systems by distributing power, order crew to {{specific}} stations or rooms to repair damage, and fire weapons at the enemy ship. Successful weapon strikes by either side can damage systems, disabling their functions until repaired by crew; cause hull breaches that vent air into space until patched by crew; ignite fires that spread and damage both {{systems and the}} hull until they are extinguished by crew or starved of oxygen; and inflict direct hull damage, which reduces the ship's hull points. A ship is destroyed once its hull points are reduced to zero, or defeated once its crew is eliminated. A player victory earns resources for bartering, upgrading, or combat; an enemy victory results in game failure, deleting the save file and forcing the player to start over, creating {{a high level of}} difficulty. Alternatively, the player may evade combat by jumping to another waypoint after the ship's engines have <b>fully</b> <b>charged.</b>|$|E
25|$|Battery life (and its synonym battery lifetime) has two {{meanings}} for {{rechargeable batteries}} {{but only one}} for non-chargeables. For rechargeables, it can mean either {{the length of time}} a device can run on a <b>fully</b> <b>charged</b> battery or the number of charge/discharge cycles possible before the cells fail to operate satisfactorily. For a non-rechargeable these two lives are equal since the cells last for only one cycle by definition. (The term shelf life is used to describe how long a battery will retain its performance between manufacture and use.) Available capacity of all batteries drops with decreasing temperature. In contrast to most of today's batteries, the Zamboni pile, invented in 1812, offers a very long service life without refurbishment or recharge, although it supplies current only in the nanoamp range. The Oxford Electric Bell has been ringing almost continuously since 1840 on its original pair of batteries, thought to be Zamboni piles.|$|E
25|$|Chase {{reports from}} orbit that an Ashiyyur warship is inbound at high speed. Then another appears, slowing to make orbit around Sim's world of exile. Alex warns Chase {{to abandon their}} rented ship for the Corsarius; she does so just before the first Ashiyyur warship destroys their rented ship. Alex joins her and learns that the Armstrong drive on the Corsarius won’t be <b>fully</b> <b>charged</b> for about a day. Their problem is to stay alive until the Armstrong drive is ready. They borrow a classic {{maneuver}} from one of Sim’s battles and leave orbit at high speed headed directly toward the incoming Ashiyyur warship, which cannot slow its speed quickly enough to meet them. It uses lasers to disable Corsarius magnetic drives; Chase realizes too late that she has forgotten to raise the ship’s shields. The Ashiyyur warship reverses its trajectory and reaches them about ten hours before they can jump. It demands their surrender. Through a strategem, Alex and Chase are able to fire Corsarius’ major weapons at it, damaging it badly and forcing it to flee. Ten hours later, the interstellar drive activates. It is not an Armstrong drive but something else, product of Rashim Machesney’s genius. In an eye blink, Corsarius is in orbit around Rimway, and safe.|$|E
50|$|Aside {{from their}} weapons, the major {{difference}} between the characters is the time they require to <b>fully</b> <b>charge</b> their punch wave or their rocket propeller: Twinbee has an average charging time; Winbee charges her rocket propeller the fastest, but takes the most to charge a punch wave; Gwinbee, on the other hand, fills charges his punch quickly, but {{takes a while to}} charge his propeller.|$|R
25|$|Since {{hydrogen}} only recombines once helium is <b>fully</b> neutral, <b>charge</b> neutrality implies ne = np, i.e. xe is {{also the}} fraction of ionized hydrogen.|$|R
40|$|Chilled water {{thermal storage}} systems {{can reduce the}} {{electrical}} demand charge during the onpeak months. However, operational problems such as the inability to <b>fully</b> <b>charge</b> the system or premature discharge of the stored cooling capacity can be costly, which can result in turning on chillers during on-peak hours {{in order to provide}} cooling to the buildings. In this paper the optimization of a thermal storage system operation through Continuous CommissioningSM is presented. Detailed building and chilled water loop commissioning activities are discussed...|$|R
500|$|According to General Motors the Volt's all-electric range with <b>fully</b> <b>charged</b> {{batteries}} {{varies from}} [...] depending on terrain, driving technique, and temperature. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) official all-electric range is [...] with an energy consumption of 36 [...] per 100 miles (810 kJ/km).

500|$|F.E.A.R.s {{multiplayer}} component includes mainstay gameplay modes, such as deathmatch, team deathmatch, {{capture the}} flag, and last man standing. [...] "Control" [...] and [...] "Conquer All" [...] gametypes were later added through a patch. Some gametypes in F.E.A.R.s multiplayer use the [...] "reflex time" [...] effect: SlowMo deathmatch, SlowMo team deathmatch, and SlowMo capture the flag. Only one player can use/carry the reflex power-up; when <b>fully</b> <b>charged</b> they can activate it and give themselves (and {{the rest of}} their team if applicable) a speed advantage over opposing players. However, the one carrying the power-up will have a bluish glow, and they will show up on a foe's HUD.|$|E
5000|$|Battery life. In December 2011, Nokia {{confirmed}} that some Lumia 800 devices {{do not use}} the full capacity of their battery. They also state that [...] "only a charger with an output of 1000mA will <b>fully</b> <b>charge</b> your Lumia 800 battery." [...] During 19-20 January 2012, two updates were made available—battery related software update and another of Windows Phone 7.5 Mango build 8107. Nokia has stated that reported issues are fixed with the update and it triples the battery life.|$|R
50|$|IUoU is a DIN-designation (DIN 41773) for a {{lead-acid}} battery charging procedure {{that is also}} known as 3-stage charging, 3-phase charging, or 3-step charging. It consists of three phases (or stages), to be executed by a battery charger. The three phases are: I-phase (constant electric current), Uo-phase (constant over-voltage), and U-phase (constant voltage). The purpose is to <b>fully</b> <b>charge</b> the battery in a relatively short time without reducing its life span and to indefinitely keep the battery charged as long as the charger is connected.|$|R
50|$|Each {{character}} {{controls in}} exactly the same manner; however, each character has a set of unique attacks along with an ultra-attack that requires the player to expel Power Stocks. By holding the down the attack button, a character can charge up to 3 Power Stocks. The time that it takes to <b>fully</b> <b>charge</b> a stock depends on the current health of the character; a character with more health will take longer to charge while a character with minimal health could charge all 3 stocks in a few seconds.|$|R

The electric vehicle would be safer, more weather-proof, and would offer space to carry items. It would be easy to drive and park and for the driver to enter or exit, and it would require minimum maintenance. The vehicle would be engineered for simplicity using injection-moulded plastic components and a polypropylene body. It would also be much cheaper than a car, costing £500 (now £) at the most.|$|E
500|$|In combat, Scarygirl has {{light and}} heavy attacks, {{which can be}} strung {{together}} to form combos. Heavy attacks {{have the ability to}} launch enemies in the air. After enemies take a certain amount of damage, they can be grappled and thrown or used to bludgeon other enemies. Additional moves are available for purchase using crystals, such as a grappling attack that heals Scarygirl or an attack that turns Scarygirl's tentacle into a club with a smashing attack. Additional weapons, which replace the hook at the end of Scarygirl's tentacle arm, are also available for purchase, and include an anchor and a fan. Scarygirl charges a meter when she attacks, and is able to enter a [...] "Rage Mode" [...] once it is <b>fully</b> <b>charged.</b> In rage mode Scarygirl gains the ability to eat enemies, restoring her own health in the process.|$|E
500|$|Although it {{was usually}} billed as an {{electric}} vehicle, the C5 also depends significantly on pedal power. The vehicle's battery {{is designed to provide}} 35 amps for an hour when <b>fully</b> <b>charged</b> or half that for two hours, giving the C5 a claimed range of [...] A display in the cockpit uses green, amber, and red LEDs to display the state of the battery charge. The segments are extinguished one after the other to indicate how much driving time is left. The last light indicates that only ten minutes of power are left, after which the motor is switched off and the driver is left to rely on the pedals. Another display indicates via green, amber, and red LEDs how much current is being used. The C5 is in its most economical running mode when a low amount of current, indicated by the green LEDs, is being used. When the lights are red, the motor is under a high load and the driver needs to use pedal power to avoid overheating and shutdown.|$|E
50|$|It {{is powered}} by a single 48-volt {{electric}} motor, which produces 4.2 kW (5.6 hp) and uses a 150-amp-hour battery pack.
