25|$|The {{reason for}} the move was twofold. First, the NFL's {{blackout}} rule forbade games from being shown on local television {{if they did not}} sell out within 72 hours of the opening kickoff. As the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum seated 92,604 at the time, it was rarely possible to sell that many tickets <b>even</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Rams' <b>best</b> years, and so most Rams home games were blacked out. Second, this move was following <b>the</b> population pattern <b>in</b> Southern California. During the 1970s and 1980s, the decline of manufacturing industries <b>in</b> <b>the</b> northeastern United States combined with the desire of many people to live in a warmer climate caused a large-scale population shift to the southern and western states. As a result, many affluent new suburbs were built <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Los Angeles area. Anaheim Stadium was originally built in 1966 to be the home of the California Angels. To accommodate the Rams' move, the ballpark was reconfigured and enclosed to accommodate a capacity of 69,008 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> football configuration. With their new, smaller home, the Rams had no problem selling out games.|$|R

However, <b>even</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Rams' <b>best</b> years, <b>the</b> cavernous venue sold out very infrequently, causing blackouts of Rams games on local TV. Additionally, it was located in South Central Los Angeles, which was perceived as {{being one of the}} city's more dangerous neighborhoods; it had begun going to seed from the 1960s onward. The Coliseum also lacked adequate nearby parking. At various times they shared the stadium with both the USC Trojans and UCLA Bruins football teams. Ownership (Carroll Rosenbloom, followed by his widow Georgia Frontiere) was unable to persuade the city to build a new stadium in Los Angeles, so they decided {{to move out of the}} Coliseum to Anaheim (28 miles southeast of downtown L.A.) in Orange County, which was then experiencing an enormous boom in population and construction.|$|R
