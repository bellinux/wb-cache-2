5|$|However Saudi {{judges are}} {{expected}} to consult six medieval texts from the Hanbali school of jurisprudence before reaching a decision. The Hanbali school is noted for its literalist interpretation of the Qur'an and hadith. If {{the answer is not}} found in the six Hanbali texts, the judge may then consult the jurisprudence of the other three main Sunni schools or apply his independent <b>judgment</b> <b>and</b> legal reasoning, referred to as ijtihad.|$|E

Specifically, it investigates whether Moral Intensity, which has been found to influence a moral agent’s <b>judgments</b> <b>and</b> intentions, also influences an observer’s <b>judgments</b> <b>and</b> intentions to report acts deemed unethical. We find mixed support for Jones’s (1991) issue-contingent model, with some Moral Intensity components more influential than others and with distinct predictors for <b>judgments</b> <b>and</b> intentions. We also find evidence of a two-factor Moral Intensity construct...|$|R

5|$|Although only an {{alternate}} {{member of the}} tribunal without a vote, his voice was heard {{in all of its}} deliberations, his hand drafted a large and most important part of its <b>judgment,</b> <b>and</b> no one connected with the tribunal, member or otherwise, had a greater part than he in shaping the final result. If, as I confidently believe, the work of the tribunal will constitute a landmark in the development of world order based on law, to Norman Birkett must go a large share of the credit for the success of the undertaking. To few men does the opportunity come to labour so mightily for the welfare of their kind.|$|E
5|$|It is a {{systematic}} {{collection of data}} based on observation of the patient's behavior while the patient is in the clinician's view during the interview.

Further, information on the patient's insight, <b>judgment,</b> <b>and</b> capacity for abstract reasoning is used to inform decisions about treatment strategy and the choice of an appropriate treatment setting.|$|E
40|$|The study {{investigated}} interpretive understanding, moral <b>judgments,</b> <b>and</b> emotion attributions {{in relation to}} social behaviour {{in a sample of}} 59 5 -year-old, 123 7 -year-old, and 130 9 -year-old children. Interpretive understanding was assessed by two tasks measuring children's understanding of ambiguous situations. Moral <b>judgments</b> <b>and</b> emotion attributions were measured using two moral rule transgressions. Social behaviour was assessed using teachers' ratings of aggressive and prosocial behaviour. Aggressive behaviour was positively related to interpretive understanding and negatively related to moral reasoning. Prosocial behaviour was positively associated with attribution of fear. Moral <b>judgments</b> <b>and</b> emotion attributions were related, depending on age. Interpretive understanding was unrelated to moral <b>judgments</b> <b>and</b> emotion attributions. The findings are discussed in regard to the role of interpretive understanding and moral and affective knowledge in understanding children's social behaviour...|$|R

5|$|One of {{the major}} points that Asch makes is that {{participants}} are not completely blind in the experiment and making arbitrary choices based on this bias. Asch claims that participants were acting reasonable in their change of evaluation of the judgment because {{the context of the}} <b>judgment</b> <b>and</b> thus the meaning of the judgment had changed. Lorge, however, suggested that if the participants were behaving logical, their evaluations should have remained the same despite the change in author.|$|E
5|$|The commonness and {{centrality}} {{of wine in}} daily life in biblical times is apparent from its many positive and negative metaphorical uses throughout the Bible. Positively, for example, wine {{is used as a}} symbol of abundance, and of physical blessing. Negatively, wine is personified as a mocker and beer a brawler, and drinking a cup of strong wine to the dregs and getting drunk are sometimes presented as a symbol of God's <b>judgment</b> <b>and</b> wrath.|$|E

Lenny and Carl point out the error of his <b>judgment,</b> <b>and</b> Homer leaves work to go look for her. He heads to the museum and ends up in downtown Springfield. He uses a cherrypicker to get up higher. Homer and Lisa spot each other, but the vehicle's wheels creak backwards and it rolls down a hill. It slides off the edge of a pier at the harbor into a river. Lisa tells the drawbridge operator to close the bridge so Homer can grab on. His head is caught between the two closing halves and he survives with nothing more than a few tire marks across his forehead.|$|E
5|$|In 1975, Tonelli won the 100m {{backstroke}}, 200m backstroke and 200m butterfly {{events at}} the Australian Championships. Although he won more individual titles {{than in the previous}} year, his times were slower; he completed the distances in 59.70s, 2m 10.50s and 2m 10.00s respectively. Tonelli was also part of the Queensland team that successfully defended their medley relay title. Tonelli was thus selected for the 1975 World Championships in Cali, Colombia. He qualified fastest for the 200m backstroke final and had planned to pursue an aggressive strategy to attack from the start. However, he was advised to swim conservatively {{in the first half of}} the race by Australian coach Terry Gathercole so that his main rivals Matthes and John Naber would not be able to draft behind him in the early stages. The tactic backfired and Tonelli ended with the silver medal. He had swum faster in the second half of the racesomething exceedingly rare in top-level swimming and an indication of strategic errorand felt that he had too much unused energy left at the end of the race. Tonelli vowed that from then on, he would always back his <b>judgment</b> <b>and</b> race strategy.|$|E
5|$|Restoring the {{primitive}} scene {{is not done}} easily nor can it be done completely. Some species are extinct. Given time, an eastern hardwood forest can be regrown to maturity but the chestnut will be missing and so will the roar of pigeon wings. The colorful drapanid finches {{are not to be}} heard again in the lowland forests of Hawaii, nor will the jack-hammer of the ivory-bill ring in southern swamps. The wolf and grizzly bear cannot readily be reintroduced into ranching communities, and the factor of human use of the parks is subject only to regulation, not elimination. Exotic plants, animals, and diseases are here to stay. All these limitations we fully realize. Yet, if the goal cannot be fully achieved it can be approached. A reasonable illusion of primitive America could be recreated, using the utmost in skill, <b>judgment,</b> <b>and</b> ecologic sensitivity. This in our opinion should be the objective of every national park and monument.|$|E
40|$|Practitioners {{investigating}} {{cases of}} suspected child maltreatment often disagree whether {{a child is}} subject to or at risk of abuse or neglect in the family and, if so, {{what to do about}} such abuse or neglect. Structured decision-making {{is considered to be a}} solution to the problem of subjective <b>judgments</b> <b>and</b> decisions. This study investigates the effects of ORBA, a method for structured decision-making in Advice and Reporting Centres for Child Abuse and Neglect (ARCCAN), on interrater agreement of <b>judgments</b> <b>and</b> decisions. Two groups of ARCCAN practitioners, one trained in using ORBA and one untrained, used a questionnaire to make <b>judgments</b> <b>and</b> decisions on the same case vignettes. Interrater agreement on the judgments was obtained by calculating the percentage of agreement, intra class correlation, and the Kappa coefficient. Both ORBA trained and untrained practitioners showed little agreement on <b>judgments</b> <b>and</b> decisions, except for the judgment on child maltreatment substantiation, for which trained practitioners showed fair agreement. Agreement among trained and untrained practitioners only differed for some <b>judgments</b> <b>and</b> decisions, and differences were not always in the same direction. This result indicates no convincing evidence that structured decision-making leads to better agreement on decisions concerning child abuse and neglect. Recommendations for improvements in uniform decision-making and further research are given...|$|R

5|$|The news of Daenerys's {{pregnancy}} {{reaches the}} Small Council, delivered {{by one of}} Varys's spies. Fearing a possible invasion by the Targaryen/Dothraki alliance, Robert orders {{that she and her}} unborn child, along with Viserys, be assassinated. Ned refuses to obey such a dishonorable order since Robert's hatred for Targaryens is clouding his <b>judgment</b> <b>and</b> ordering such an assassination will make him no better than the Mad King. When Robert's mind is clearly made, Ned resigns the office of Hand of the King, much to Robert's anger. As Robert drinks in sorrow over his fight with Ned, Cersei visits Robert and he explains why he takes the Dothraki threat seriously. Meanwhile, Robert's youngest brother Renly is with his lover, Ser Loras. Loras convinces Renly that he should be king because Loras believes that Renly would be a better ruler than either his brothers or nephews.|$|E
5|$|Throughout gameplay, {{the player}} {{encounters}} various minigames, {{which range from}} simple to more complex. The first type of minigame encountered is a battle sequence that resembles a fighting game, but no interaction from the player is required to fight. These recurring battle sequences represent when {{the members of the}} Little Busters get into physical fights with either each other or with others. Each member of the fight has a set of statistics attributed to them (which includes strength, stamina, agility, reflex, concentration, <b>judgment,</b> <b>and</b> luck) along with a life bar to keep track of how many hit points a fighter has left. The maximum number of hit points is determined by the given fighter's stamina rating. Weapons may be used along with any accessories the fighter has in their possession, and these items may be exchanged with other characters. Another recurring minigame involves the player being able to play baseball batting practice with members of the Little Busters. The player, as Riki, controls his position and when to swing the bat.|$|E

5|$|Beer {{contains}} ethyl alcohol, {{the same}} chemical that {{is present in}} wine and distilled spirits and as such, beer consumption has short-term psychological and physiological effects on the user. Different concentrations of alcohol {{in the human body}} have different effects on a person. The effects of alcohol depend on the amount an individual has drunk, the percentage of alcohol in the beer and the timespan over which the consumption took place, the amount of food eaten and whether an individual has taken other prescription, over-the-counter or street drugs, among other factors. Drinking enough to cause a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.03%-0.12% typically causes an overall improvement in mood and possible euphoria, increased self-confidence and sociability, decreased anxiety, a flushed, red appearance in the face and impaired <b>judgment</b> <b>and</b> fine muscle coordination. A BAC of 0.09% to 0.25% causes lethargy, sedation, balance problems and blurred vision. A BAC from 0.18% to 0.30% causes profound confusion, impaired speech (e.g., slurred speech), staggering, dizziness and vomiting. A BAC from 0.25% to 0.40% causes stupor, unconsciousness, anterograde amnesia, vomiting (death may occur due to inhalation of vomit (pulmonary aspiration) while unconscious) and respiratory depression (potentially life-threatening). A BAC from 0.35% to 0.80% causes a coma (unconsciousness), life-threatening respiratory depression and possibly fatal alcohol poisoning. As with all alcoholic drinks, drinking while driving, operating an aircraft or heavy machinery increases the risk of an accident; many countries have severe criminal penalties against drunk driving.|$|E
