40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Electrical EngineeringElectric {{vehicles}} (EVs) {{have been}} introduced as the demand for green transportation has increased. <b>EVs</b> require <b>charging.</b> Studies have shown that uncontrolled <b>EV</b> <b>charging</b> in {{certain areas of the}} community reduces the life of the distribution components, such as the secondary distribution transformer. One approach to remedying this is to increase the rating of the secondary distribution transformer, but by doing so, the no-load losses also increase. Minimizing no-load losses while deciding an optimal rating for the transformer during controlled and uncontrolled <b>EV</b> <b>charging</b> for an average day is studied in this work. The study is extended to include an hourly <b>EV</b> <b>charging</b> load. Along with no-load losses, the cost of the no-load losses and the cost of the transformer are minimized while deciding the optimal transformer rating. Controlling <b>EV</b> <b>charging</b> is another approach to controlling distribution losses and the transformer loss of life. Customer participation in delaying charging until getting the desired price is the approach taken in the next part of this study. Customer anxiety is defined and used as a measure to control <b>EV</b> <b>charging</b> behavior. The impact of customer anxiety on <b>EV</b> <b>charging</b> behavior is analyzed. An algorithm to control <b>EV</b> <b>charging</b> using customer anxiety as a measure is suggested in this work. The use of renewable resources along with controlled and uncontrolled <b>EV</b> <b>charging</b> and its impacts on the distribution transformer is studied here. Controlled <b>EV</b> <b>charging</b> deteriorates transformer life much less than uncontrolled <b>EV</b> <b>charging</b> does. The optimal transformer rating increases for uncontrolled <b>EV</b> <b>charging</b> versus controlled <b>EV</b> <b>charging.</b> When residential controlled <b>EV</b> <b>charging</b> along with energy from rooftop solar panels is used, the transformer loss of life is considerably reduced. With customer participation, <b>EV</b> <b>charging</b> can be controlled; hence, customer anxiety level can be a good measure for the utility to use in order to provide a plan-ahead system for <b>EV</b> <b>charging...</b>|$|R

40|$|Non-intrusive load {{monitoring}} (NILM) is {{an important}} topic in smart-grid and smart-home. Many energy disaggregation algorithms have been proposed to detect various individual appliances from one aggregated signal observation. However, few works studied the energy disaggregation of plug-in electric vehicle (<b>EV)</b> <b>charging</b> in the residential environment since <b>EVs</b> <b>charging</b> at home has emerged only recently. Recent studies showed that <b>EV</b> <b>charging</b> has a large impact on smart-grid especially in summer. Therefore, <b>EV</b> <b>charging</b> monitoring has become a more important and urgent missing piece in energy disaggregation. In this paper, we present a novel method to disaggregate <b>EV</b> <b>charging</b> signals from aggregated real power signals. The proposed method can effectively mitigate interference coming from air-conditioner (AC), enabling accurate <b>EV</b> <b>charging</b> detection and energy estimation under the presence of AC power signals. Besides, the proposed algorithm requires no training, demands a light computational load, delivers high estimation accuracy, and works well for data recorded at the low sampling rate 1 / 60 Hz. When the algorithm is tested on real-world data recorded from 11 houses over about a whole year (total 125 months worth of data), the averaged error in estimating energy consumption of <b>EV</b> <b>charging</b> is 15. 7 kwh/month (while the true averaged energy consumption of <b>EV</b> <b>charging</b> is 208. 5 kwh/month), and the averaged normalized mean square error in disaggregating <b>EV</b> <b>charging</b> load signals is 0. 19.

In the coordinated <b>EV</b> <b>charging</b> strategy presented in this paper, each aggregator determines <b>EV</b> <b>charging</b> start time and charging energy profiles to minimize overall <b>EV</b> <b>charging</b> energy cost by including consideration {{of the actions of}} the neighboring aggregators. The competitive interactions of the aggregators are modeled by developing a two-stage non-cooperative game among the aggregators.

40|$|Electric {{vehicles}} (EV) {{are gaining}} a prominent {{share of the}} trillion-dollar automotive market. The growth is fueled by falling battery prices, tightening emission standards, government subsidies and increasing competition. The rise of EV’s creates a need for, and also depends on, charging infrastructure on a large scale. Electric vehicle charging networks are services {{that are used to}} manage and enable access to charging points. This study aims to understand how these networks can succeed in the tightening competition by examining what factors contribute to the value of an <b>EV</b> <b>charging</b> network for its participants. To reach this goal an explanatory single case study was conducted. The case examined a public <b>EV</b> <b>charging</b> network in Finland. First, earlier research in platform economics and <b>EV</b> <b>charging</b> were used to understand the context and to synthesize a theoretical framework. Next, empirical data was collected primarily with semi-structured interviews. Finally, pattern matching was used to analyze the data. Based on the results, the <b>EV</b> <b>charging</b> industry is still its infancy. <b>EV</b> <b>charging</b> networks mediate transactions between <b>EV</b> drivers and <b>charging</b> point owners (CPO), enabling exchange of information, control of charging points, and payments. Various signals suggest an expansion towards the energy system, as <b>EV</b> <b>charging</b> networks are likely to start aggregating and mediating vehicle-to-grid (V 2 G) services between EV drivers and energy market agents. The results suggest two focus areas as key factors creating value for participants. Firstly, the main contributor to the success of an <b>EV</b> <b>charging</b> network is the amount of charging points connected to it. This is mainly due to EV drivers’ strong positive cross-side network effects and to CPOs’ strong positive same-side network effects. Secondly, an <b>EV</b> <b>charging</b> network’s boundary resources should be designed to maximize efficiency for both sides.

40|$|Electric vehicle (<b>EV)</b> <b>charging</b> in {{buildings}} has a non-negligible {{impact on the}} in-building and low-voltage (LV) distribution grid. It is widely accepted that the coordination of <b>EV</b> <b>charging</b> may reduce this grid impact, allowingnbsp;EVsnbsp;be charged through the power system, without grid infrastructure investments. The literature mainly focuses on (large-scale) optimization coordination fornbsp;certain objective (technical and/or economical), which requires a relative high penetration rate of EVs to be beneficial. However, local clustering of EVs {{in buildings}} or LV distribution grids might already occur in the nearfuture, requiring local charging solutions. Therefore, {{in order to reduce}} thisnbsp;charging grid impact, this dissertation focuses on the following local <b>EV</b> <b>charging</b> solutions: (a) local <b>EV</b> <b>charging</b> strategies (rule-based control) in large buildings (multiple <b>EVs</b> <b>charging),</b> which require minimal local or EV internal knowledge, and minimal or no communication in and outside the building, and (b) the use of DC grids to connect and <b>charge</b> the <b>EVs</b> in buildings. The objective is to assess how these solutions can alreadynbsp;the grid impact, in order tonbsp;a higher penetration rate of EVs and others, such as a heat pumps and PV systems, innbsp;system. The following local <b>EV</b> <b>charging</b> strategies have been assessed: (a) EV based peak shaving, which reduces the <b>EV</b> <b>charging</b> power in order to maximally use the available charging time, i. e. load shifting and load reduction, (b) delayed charging delays the charging as long asnbsp;(c) renewable self-consumption, i. e. matching local electricity demand and production, (d) nbsp;voltage droop mechanism adapts the <b>EV</b> <b>charging</b> power as anbsp;of the grid voltage, and (e) a building peak shaving mechanism reduces the <b>EV</b> <b>charging</b> powernbsp;a function of the total building load. All local <b>EV</b> <b>charging</b> strategies succeed in their objectives, i. e. reducing the demand and/or injection peak powers, increasing the local self-consumption, and/or reducing the voltage deviations. The results show that these local <b>EV</b> <b>charging</b> strategies, which do not require any optimizations and any communication outside the building, decrease the grid impact and allow to <b>charge</b> more <b>EVs</b> in the building, postponing or avoiding the needs to invest in grid infrastructure reinforcements. The use of DC grids also reduces the grid impact of <b>EV</b> <b>charging</b> in buildings. The results show that DC grids arenbsp;interesting regarding the voltage unbalance and voltage deviations in the AC grid. Both the voltage unbalance and voltage deviations are reduced.

Finally,the simulations have been performed from two points of view:deterministic analysis and probabilistic analysis. Postprint (published version...|$|R
