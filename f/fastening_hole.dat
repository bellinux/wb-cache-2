This paper {{outlined}} the experimental and theoretical {{study on the}} TC 4 alloy <b>fasten</b> <b>holes</b> structure to assess the first inspection and maintenance period for structures. The initial fatigue quality of the fastener holes was represented by an equivalent initial flaw size distribution. Based on the experimental results of crack size, the life of fasten structure detail in which 5 % crack happened was provided and the resulted life was suggested as the structure economical life. The predicated economical life of titanium alloy <b>fasten</b> <b>hole</b> structure are helpful to the economical repair of the airframe structure...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Wind {{turbines}} {{are used}} to convert the kinetic energy of wind into useful power. The wind turbine blades are fabricated using glass fiber-reinforced composite materials. Wind turbine blades are complex section. In order to improve {{the strength of the}} blades under varying loading conditions, spars are embedded in it. The spars are fastened with the composite shells of the blades using bolted connec-tions. In order to affect this <b>fastening,</b> <b>holes</b> of appropriate size were drilled in the composite laminates. Delamination is the major failure in composite blades which is induced during drilling. Delamination is quantitatively measured using digital means. A comparison between the conventional (FD) and adjusted (FDA) delamina-tion factors is presented. In order to effectively quantify the delamination, refined delamination factor (FDR) is proposed. It is found that the proposed FDR predicts th...|$|R

40|$|The {{number of}} multi-materials staking {{configurations}} for aeronautical structures is increasing, with {{the evolution of}} composite and metallic materials. For drilling the <b>fastening</b> <b>holes,</b> the processes of Vibration Assisted Drilling (VAD) expand rapidly, as it permits to improve reliability of drilling operations on multilayer structures. Among these processes of VAD, the solution with forced vibrations added to conventional feed to create a discontinuous cutting is the more developed in industry. The back and forth movement allows to improve the evacuation of chips by breaking it. This technology introduces two new operating parameters, the frequency and the amplitude of the oscillation. To optimize the process, the choice of those parameters requires first to model precisely the operation cutting and dynamics. In this paper, a kinematic modelling of the process is firstly proposed. The limits of the model are analysed through comparison between simulations and measurements. The proposed model is used to develop a cutting force model that allows foreseeing the operating conditions which ensure good chips breaking and tool life improvement...|$|R

5000|$|Many U.S. {{district}} {{courts have}} {{developed their own}} requirements included in local rules for filing summary-judgment motions. Local rules can set limits {{on the number of}} pages, explain if a separate factual statement is required, whether it is acceptable to combine motion petition with a response, and if a judge needs an additional copy of the documents (called a [...] "judge's copy"), etc. Local Rules can define page-layout elements like: margins, text font/size, distance between lines, mandatory footer text, page numbering, and provide directions on how the pages need to be bound together - i.e., acceptable fasteners, number and location of <b>fastening</b> <b>holes,</b> etc. If the filed motion does not comply with the local rules, then the judge can choose to strike the motion completely, or order the party to re-file its motion, or grant a special exception to the local rules. Summary-judgment motions, like many other court filings, are a matter of public record. So under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 5.2, sensitive text like Social Security number, Taxpayer Identification Number, birthday, bank accounts and children's names, should be redacted from the summary-judgment motion and accompanying exhibits. The redacted text can be erased with black-out or white-out, and the page should have an indication that it was redacted - most often by stamping the word [...] "redacted" [...] on the bottom. Alternately, the filing party may ask the court's permission to file some exhibits completely under seal. A minor's name of the petitions should be replaced with initials. A person making a redacted filing can file an unredacted copy under seal, or the court can choose to order later that an additional filing be made under seal without redaction. Copies of both redacted and unredacted documents filed with court should be provided to the other parties in the case.|$|R

40|$|The {{ground support}} {{personnel}} (GSP) {{is in charge}} of the ISS operations and the training for it consists of classroom training, hands-on training and simulations. During the operative sessions the instructors provide real-like scenarios of ISS, enhanced by the injection of malfunction scenarios to which the operators should opportunely respond. The objective of this paper is the development of such malfunction scenarios, with particular focus to those affecting a specific ESA Payload on board the ISS, namely the European Drawer Rack (EDR), located in the European Laboratory Columbus. Specific failure scripts were written and once inserted and processes by the simulator, could generate modifications of some telemetry values and result in an off-nominal condition. The Flight Controllers participating in the simulation are supposed to recognize the off-nominal telemetry and properly react, handling such malfunctions and acting as the procedures recommend. The important role of this work lye in the fact that can <b>fasten</b> the <b>hole</b> preparation and performance process of simulations, letting the examiner free to concentrate better on evaluating the student's reactions. In the end since some of these malfunctions are completely "new", they can serve as a basis to troubleshoot a real problem that could happen on orbi...|$|R
60|$|It {{happened}} that one limb {{of the great}} elm before the house was hollow for a considerable distance up from {{the trunk of the}} tree, and there was a hole leading into this hollow limb at the crotch, where the limb grew out from the tree. She thought that this would make a fine house for the squirrel, if he could only be induced to think so himself, and live there. It occurred to her that she might put him in, and <b>fasten</b> up the <b>hole</b> with wires for a time, like a cage; and she thought that if she kept him shut up there, and fed him there with plenty of nuts and corn, for a week or two, he would gradually forget his old home in the woods, and get wonted to his new one.|$|R
60|$|When {{the ship}} was repaired, the admiral, with many of his officers, made a journey into the interior, {{and found that it}} was a goodly country, with a very {{fruitful}} soil. There were many thousands of large and fair deer, grazing in herds. This country was christened, by the admiral, Albion; partly from the color of its cliffs, partly in remembrance of his country. On the shore a monument was set up, and on it a plate of brass was affixed, engraven with the Queen's name, the date of the arrival of the ship, and of the free giving up of the province and kingdom into her majesty's hand; and a piece of current English money was <b>fastened</b> beneath a <b>hole</b> made in the brass plate, so that it might remain as a proof that the English had taken possession of this land, to which the Spaniards had never approached.|$|R
5000|$|As Baalham {{made his}} inspection, others {{observed}} {{the extent of}} the damage, and a mood of concern and anxiety began to develop as news spread. With the ship's four pumps working at full capacity, Luce attempted to stanch the leak by passing a large canvas sail over the ship's bow. This, he hoped, could be <b>fastened</b> over the <b>holes</b> in the hull to lessen the inflow of water, but the jagged iron debris protruding from the hull quickly tore the sail apart. The ship's carpenter tried to stuff the breaches with mattresses and other materials, but the holes were by then too far below the waterline to be reached. Realizing that his ship was in serious danger of sinking, Luce decided to run for the nearest land, in the hopes of reaching safety while Arctic was still afloat; Cape Race was about four hours distant, if the ship could be kept moving. This decision meant abandoning Vesta, but Luce rationalized that the French vessel was likely to sink at any moment, and that remaining with her might well condemn his own passengers and crew to the same fate. After vainly attempting to signal his intention to Gourlay and his crew, who were being left to fend for themselves, Luce ordered full speed ahead. [...] A few minutes later, Arctic ploughed into a lifeboat that had been launched from Vesta. All but one of its dozen occupants were killed, mostly crushed under Arctics paddle wheels. The single survivor was a fisherman, François Jassonet, who jumped clear and was hauled aboard Arctic by a rope.|$|R
60|$|Three {{days after}} my arrival, {{walking out of}} curiosity to the {{north-east}} coast of the island, I observed, about half a league off in the sea, somewhat {{that looked like a}} boat overturned. I pulled off my shoes and stockings, and, wailing two or three hundred yards, I found the object to approach nearer by force of the tide; and then plainly saw it to be a real boat, which I supposed might by some tempest have been driven from a ship. Whereupon, I returned immediately towards the city, and desired his imperial majesty to lend me twenty of the tallest vessels he had left, after the loss of his fleet, and three thousand seamen, under the command of his vice-admiral. This fleet sailed round, while I went back the shortest way to the coast, where I first discovered the boat. I found the tide had driven it still nearer. The seamen were all provided with cordage, which I had beforehand twisted to a sufficient strength. When the ships came up, I stripped myself, and waded till I came within a hundred yards off the boat, after which I was forced to swim till I got up to it. The seamen threw me the end of the cord, which I <b>fastened</b> to a <b>hole</b> in the fore-part of the boat, and the other end to a man of war; but I found all my labour to little purpose; for, being out of my depth, I was not able to work. In this necessity I was forced to swim behind, and push the boat forward, as often as I could, with one of my hands; and the tide favouring me, I advanced so far that I could just hold up my chin and feel the ground. I rested two or three minutes, and then gave the boat another shove, and so on, till the sea was no higher than my arm-pits; and now, the most laborious part being over, I took out my other cables, which were stowed in one of the ships, and fastened them first to the boat, and then to nine of the vessels which attended me; the wind being favourable, the seamen towed, and I shoved, until we arrived within forty yards of the shore; and, waiting till the tide was out, I got dry to the boat, and by the assistance of two thousand men, with ropes and engines, I made a shift to turn it on its bottom, and found it was but little damaged.|$|R
