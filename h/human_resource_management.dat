This paper presents two studies, aimed to explain knowledge sharing by teachersâ€™ occupational self-efficacy and <b>Human</b> <b>Resources</b> <b>Management</b> (HRM). In the first study we examined the impact of HRM from a â€˜content perspectiveâ€™, and focused on a bundle of <b>Human</b> <b>Resources</b> <b>Management</b> practices, namely, high-commitment <b>Human</b> <b>Resources</b> <b>Management</b> (HC-HRM). Multilevel analyses of survey data from 410 teachers, from 30 teams, in one school, showed that high-commitment <b>Human</b> <b>Resources</b> <b>Management</b> strengthened the relationship between occupational self-efficacy and knowledge sharing.
