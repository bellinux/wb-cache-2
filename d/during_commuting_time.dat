A typical capacity is the Eurostar, which provides capacity for 12 trains per hour and 800 passengers per train, totaling 9,600 passengers per hour in each direction. By contrast, the Highway Capacity Manual gives a maximum capacity of 2,250 passenger cars per hour per lane, excluding other vehicles, assuming an average vehicle occupancy of 1.57 people. A standard twin track railway has a typical capacity 13% greater than a 6-lane highway (3 lanes each way), while requiring only 40% of the land (1.0/3.0 versus 2.5/7.5 hectares per kilometre of direct/indirect land consumption). The Tokaido Shinkansen line in Japan, has a much higher ratio (with as many as 20,000 passengers per hour per direction).

At the agency's inception, Capital Metro originally operated {{a series of}} [...] "paired" [...] route service where two different routes that pass through downtown are served by the same buses, allowing riders to transfer between certain routes without leaving the bus. Since 2008, this practice has been eliminated and {{after a number of}} route pair reassignments, the agency merged the paired routes under single route numbers (for example, the 1 North Lamar and 13 South Congress were originally paired as they were the two busiest routes in the system, but they have since been merged as 1 North Lamar/South Congress). Meanwhile, most local routes carried two digits before Capital Metro assigned a third digit for routes that do not serve downtown in 2000 (for example, 25 Ohlen became 325). Flyer routes were renumbered altogether to match their local stop counterparts (for example, 65 Manchaca Flyer became 103), while express routes that operated <b>during</b> <b>commute</b> <b>times</b> only contained letters (for example, NEX Northeast Express was renamed 990 Manor/Elgin Express; but was also named 103 Northeast Express).|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis work {{analyses}} {{two years}} of air quality data for Catania, Sicily's second largest city, which has been monitoring air pol lution since 1992. In 2009, this monitoring network was substantially reduced from 17 to 5 monitoring stations in compliance with EU Directive 50 / 2008. These stations are managed by the Municipal Ecology and Environment office. The following pollutant species are monitored continuously: CO, NO 2, SO 2, O 3, C 6 H 6 and PM 10. Those pollutants which strongly impact ecosystems, population and climate, have legally binding concentration thresholds established by the EU. A robust study of all pollutants and their measurement methods has been carried out. The data was validated and interpreted b y daily profiling each single pollutant during different seasons. This study revealed, as expected, how pollutant concentrations peak especially <b>during</b> <b>commute</b> <b>times</b> (early morning and afternoon). The recent change towards DIESEL powered cars has increasingly effected NO 2 and PM 10 concentrations causing some public health concerns but fortunately, SO 2 and CO concentrations have decreased.

They may, however, increase ultrafine particle (UFP; liquid or solid particles < 0. 1 µm in diameter) number concentrations under some conditions along roadways and other sites where diesel engines operate. This {{is a public}} health concern because UFP in high number (count) concentrations may have adverse health effects. At the same time, efforts to reduce mass-based PM 2. 5 are needed because of the known health effects that are significantly associated with PM 2. 5 mass concentrations. Along roadways, vehicles powered by diesel engines produce PM 2. 5 that includes a UFP fraction. 1 While arising from the same diesel engine sources, potential exposures to PM 2. 5 and UFPs differ with location. UFP counts are highest at and near roadways, and drop off within several hundred meters at a much more rapid rate than PM 2. 5 mass levels (Levy et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2004). Because of this rapid drop off, on-road commuters can have their greatest exposure to UFPs <b>during</b> <b>commute</b> <b>times,</b> even if the time spent in traffic is a relatively {{small part of the}} day.

Participants were 83 employees (56 % female) who each commuted between their regular {{place of residence}} and place of work using vehicles. The Workplace Cognitive Failure Scale (WCFS) asked for the frequency of failure in memory function, failure in attention regulation, and failure in action execution. Time pressure and time control at work were assessed by the Instrument for Stress Oriented Task Analysis (ISTA). Commuting accidents in the last 12 months were reported by 10 % of participants, {{and half of the}} sample reported commuting near-accidents in the last 4 weeks. Cognitive failure significantly mediated the influence of time pressure at work on near-accidents even when age, gender, neuroticism, conscientiousness, commuting duration, <b>commuting</b> distance, and <b>time</b> pressure <b>during</b> <b>commuting</b> were controlled for. Time control was negatively related to cognitive failure and neuroticism, but no association with commuting accidents or near-accidents was found.

A retrospective analysis was conducted of paediatric road trauma identified in linked police-reported and hospitalisation records during 1 January 2001 to 31 December 2011 in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. The linkage rate was 54 %. Injury severity was calculated from diagnosis classifications in hospital records using the International Classification of Disease Injury Severity Score. Univariate and multi-variable logistic regression was conducted. There were 2412 car occupants, 1701 pedestrians and 612 pedal cyclists hospitalised where their hospital record linked to a police report. For car occupants, unauthorised vehicle drivers had twice the odds (OR: 2. 21, 95 %CI 1. 47 – 3. 34) and learner/provisional drivers had one and a half times higher odds (OR: 1. 54, 95 %CI 1. 15 – 2. 07) of a child car occupant sustaining a serious injury compared to a minor injury.

This study examines the relationship between rainfall and PA in a longitudinal cohort of initially 9 - 10 year-old children in Norfolk, UK. Methods: Participants were 283 children from the SPEEDY study who wore accelerometers ≤ 7 days on three occasions in the summer of 2007, 2008 and 2011 at ages 9 - 10, 10 - 11, and 13 - 14 y. Daily weather data were obtained for two local weather stations. Relationships between rainfall and PA (moderate-to-vigorous-PA (MVPA; ≥ 2000) vigorous PA (VPA; ≥ 4000), counts per minute (cpm)) and sedentary time were assessed in multiple-membership multilevel models. PA was assessed over the whole day, and over parts of the school day; <b>commute</b> <b>time</b> (8 am- 9 am and 3 pm- 4 pm), lunchtime (12 noon- 2 pm), and after school (4 pm- 9 pm). Results: At ages 9 - 10 and 10 - 11 y, PA declined with increasing rainfall, with an average of 14. 0 (SE 2. 9) and 11. 4 (3. 0) minutes less MVPA on the wettest days (≥ 1. 7 mm rain) compared to dry days respectively. There was no significant trend in MVPA across rainfall categories at age 13 - 14 years. Between ages 9 - 10 and 13 - 14, MVPA decline was largest on dry days (- 15. 2 (2. 7) minutes). These patterns were also apparent during school lunchtime and after school, however they were not seen <b>during</b> school <b>commute</b> <b>times.</b> Similar patterns were seen for other PA intensities. Conclusions: Increased rainfall is associated with significant decreases in PA among primary school children, but not secondary school children. PA declines most steeply between the ages of 9 - 10 and 13 - 14 on dry days. Interventions to increase activity on wet days may be most relevant at primary schools.

Methods: Participants were 283 children from the SPEEDY study who wore accelerometers ≤ 7 days on three occasions in the summer of 2007, 2008 and 2011 at ages 9 – 10, 10 – 11, and 13 - 14 y. Daily weather data were obtained for two local weather stations. Relationships between rainfall and PA (moderate-to-vigorous-PA (MVPA; ≥ 2000) vigorous PA (VPA; ≥ 4000), counts per minute (cpm)) and sedentary time were assessed in multiple-membership multilevel models. PA was assessed over the whole day, and over parts of the school day; <b>commute</b> <b>time</b> (8 am- 9 am and 3 pm- 4 pm), lunchtime (12 noon- 2 pm), and after school (4 pm- 9 pm). Results: At ages 9 – 10 and 10 - 11 y, PA declined with increasing rainfall, with an average of 14. 0 (SE 2. 9) and 11. 4 (3. 0) minutes less MVPA on the wettest days (≥ 1. 7 mm rain) compared to dry days respectively. There was no significant trend in MVPA across rainfall categories at age 13 – 14 years. Between ages 9 – 10 and 13 – 14, MVPA decline was largest on dry days (- 15. 2 (2. 7) minutes). These patterns were also apparent during school lunchtime and after school, however they were not seen <b>during</b> school <b>commute</b> <b>times.</b> Similar patterns were seen for other PA intensities. Conclusions: Increased rainfall is associated with significant decreases in PA among primary school children, but not secondary school children. PA declines most steeply between the ages of 9 – 10 and 13 – 14 on dry days. Interventions to increase activity on wet days may be most relevant at primary schools. Our results also highlight the importance of habitualising behavior to make children more resilient both to bad weather, and potentially age-related decline in activity.

40|$|The “commute time” {{between two}} nodes i and j {{in a network}} is a {{sophisticated}} distance metric which measures the expected time for a random walker to start at i, arrive at j and return back to i. Currently, the most efficient method for calculating <b>commute</b> <b>time</b> involves summing the squared difference of the ith and jth entries of all eigenvectors of the Graph Laplacian, weighting each difference by the reciprocal of the corresponding eigenvalue, and weighting the entire sum {{by the number of}} edges in the graph. However, this method is still prohibitively expensive for large (million or billion node) networks. The objective {{of this study was to}} observe the how accurately a <b>commute</b> <b>time</b> found by incorporating only a percentage of the eigenpairs could approximate the actual <b>commute</b> <b>time.</b> I tested the accuracy of the <b>commute</b> <b>time</b> approximation as more and more eigenpairs were added in addition to which specific eigenpairs contributed most to the overall <b>commute</b> <b>time.</b> Finally, the approximated <b>commute</b> <b>times</b> (at various levels of truncation) were measured against the actual <b>commute</b> <b>time</b> for accurate detection of Top-k neighbors. Results showed that, depending on the degree of nodes involved in the <b>commute</b> <b>time,</b> drastically different eigenpairs are the main “contributors” to the <b>commute</b> <b>time.</b> This was confirmed as a significant amount of eigenpairs were needed to accurately predict the Top-k neighbors...|$|R
40|$|Amongst the {{hypothesized}} beneficial impacts of sprawl on urban {{quality of life}} is a decrease in <b>commuting</b> <b>times.</b> Unfortunately, empirical evidence to substantiate the <b>commuting</b> <b>time</b> benefits of sprawl is scant. To address this void in the urban planning literature, a multilevel approach is adopted to study how sprawl affects the duration and length of private-vehicle commutes. Using microdata from the 2001 National Household Transportation Survey for individuals and microdata on various measures of sprawl for metropolitan areas, multilevel models of <b>commuting</b> <b>times</b> and distances are estimated for a subsample of private-vehicle commuters. Results somewhat support the hypothesis that sprawl decreases <b>commuting</b> <b>times</b> for private-vehicle commuters—employment decentralization is associated with shorter <b>commuting</b> <b>times.</b> However, this finding is based on the statistical significance of one of the sprawl measures; not on its practical significance in explaining <b>commuting</b> <b>times</b> which is, in fact, negligible. Coupling this with the finding that the multilevel model only explained about 5 % of the variance in private-vehicle <b>commuting</b> <b>times</b> suggests that there is considerable room available for improving the model specification. ...|$|R
