5000|$|Dillon's long-time {{collaborator}} Garth Ennis {{paid tribute}} to Dillon thus: [...] "The last time I saw Steve was late last Saturday night in New York, walking down fifth avenue to his hotel after saying goodnight outside Foley's. It {{could have been the}} end of any one of a thousand nights. It’s not a bad last memory to have. Steve was best man at my wedding and my good and dear friend. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> taught me more about what that word means than anyone else." ...|$|E
5000|$|Alvarez {{recalled}} that [...] "From my end of it, I guess I perceived {{him to be}} losing motivation. There's things I regret about that situation, {{but at the end}} of the day <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>probably,</b> one way or the other, would have moved on, and I probably forced his hand a little, maybe." [...] "At the end I just wanted so badly to go do something else", said Reynolds in 2013. [...] "Every decision I've made since I left the band has been the wrong decision. On the one hand, I wanted my independence. On the other hand, ironically, that's why I'm a barback now." [...] Chad Price replaced Reynolds as the band's lead singer.|$|E
5000|$|This is a {{young guy}} we've been talking with for a long time, and who has been to games {{and we have a}} {{relationship}} with because his uncle works for the Rosemont Police Department...I think it's a prospect who has grown up around DePaul basketball. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> <b>probably</b> a fan and someone who has been a fan for some time, since we have played in Rosemont for the last 30 years.|$|R
5000|$|Modern {{bluegrass}} {{singer and}} mandolin player Ricky Skaggs {{was influenced by}} Monroe. Skaggs was only six years old, in 1960, when he first got to perform on stage with Monroe and his band {{at the high school}} in Martha, KY. He stated, [...] "I think Bill Monroe's importance to American music is as important as someone like Robert Johnson was to blues, or Louis Armstrong. He was so influential: <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> <b>probably</b> the only musician that had a whole style of music named after his band." ...|$|R
2500|$|Maddux {{was also}} known for {{intensely}} studying hitters in preparation for his starts. He would often watch hitters take their warmup swings or read their body language to gauge their mentality. Teammate Tom Glavine said, [...] "I think the hitters <b>think</b> <b>he</b> {{can go back and}} recall every pitch he has ever thrown. That's not the case, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> <b>probably</b> better at remembering things than most people are. He's definitely better {{in the course of the}} game at making adjustments on a hitter based on what he's seen, whether it's one swing or a guy's last at-bat." ...|$|R
5000|$|Marvin Hamlisch said of Kander and Ebb, [...] "All I can {{remember}} is that working with Fred Ebb {{was a lot of}} fun. You know, John Kander and Fred Ebb wrote as a team. So, most of the songs that were written when we usually worked with Liza were written by them. However, when it came to doing arrangements and working on the act and putting things together, I loved working with Fred Ebb. We had the best time. He and I were really good friends. It was just delightful. He was a very, very smart man. And he was very funny. And he was very caustic. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> wrote for her better than anyone in the world could have written for her. He just understood her so well." ...|$|E
5000|$|He was {{attacked}} by Baltimore Mayor Martin O'Malley for his close relationship with Republican Governor Bob Ehrlich, who noted, [...] "He works very hard to give the Ehrlich administration cover. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> prides himself at {{the degree to which}} he helps cover up the poor performance of the governor." [...] Schaefer added to his troubles when he announced, [...] "I don't want to adjust to another language. This is the United States. I think to the United States should adjust to us," [...] {{at a meeting of the}} Maryland Board of Public Works, prompted by an experience he recently had at a McDonald's restaurant. He noted later that his remarks would cause him to [...] "likely lose all the Latin votes and all the other votes." [...] Another controversy arose in February 2006 when Schaefer made inappropriate remarks to an aide at another meeting of the Board of Public Works. As the aide brought him a cup of tea, he watched her walk away before requesting that she [...] "walk again." [...] Not long after the incident, Schaefer apologized to the aide, but opponent Peter Franchot remarked, [...] "He's apologizing for the negative publicity rather than his inappropriate behavior." ...|$|E
5000|$|Fellow Magpie Len Thompson {{described}} Greening in 2006, [...] "Now {{we can say}} he was of {{the style}} we see today - with that great running skill... <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> was <b>probably</b> like a Robert Harvey ... he had magnificent balance, he used both sides of his body and he had this big ticker to run and cover ground." ...|$|R
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with the BBC in September 2010, Ben Myers said that he never expected the Manics to like the book, adding that [...] "All I could have hoped for is that they could accept or appreciate what it is I'm trying to do. I have to accept anything the Manic Street Preachers say about it, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> the comments that I've heard have been fair enough. Given some of the things Nicky Wire has said in the past about some people <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> <b>probably</b> been quite charitable. It could have been far, far worse." [...] Myers also said that he had written to the Edwards family, explaining why he wrote the book and [...] "a little bit about myself and about the influence their son had on me and people like me," [...] and sent a similar letter to the Manics.|$|R
6000|$|... "Heaven knows! It isn't his affair, really. If {{there were}} any charge against me--well, you see, there'd {{have to be an}} {{extradition}} order. <b>I</b> should <b>think</b> <b>he</b> will <b>probably</b> lay the facts before Scotland Yard and let them do what they choose." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He said so, squire, at {{the time}} he was smarting with the pain of a severe bite; and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>probably</b> <b>he</b> meant no more than a man who, under the same circumstances, would say, 'Confound the dog!' or even a {{stronger}} oath." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Altogether! <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>probably</b> <b>he</b> did pawn his commission. That is bad, but it isn't so very bad. As for {{the other}} charge against him, I doubt it." [...] So said Lord Burton, and Sir Harry {{determined}} that the accusation should go for nothing.|$|R
60|$|My brother's farm {{is but a}} wretched lease, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> will <b>probably</b> weather out the {{remaining}} seven years of it; and after the assistance which I have given, and will give him, to keep the family together, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> by my guess, I shall have rather better than two hundred pounds, and instead of seeking, what is almost impossible at present to find, a farm that I can certainly live by, with so small a stock, I shall lodge this sum in a banking-house, a sacred deposit, excepting only the calls of uncommon distress or necessitous old age.|$|R
5000|$|Silviniaco Conti {{made his}} {{seasonal}} reappearance on 2 November in the Pertemps Network Handicap Hurdle over 2 mile 5 furlongs at Kempton Park. He started at 7/2 in the betting and finished second, beaten four lengths by the favourite, Brother Tedd. Silviniaco Conti ran second {{for most of}} the race, was overtaken coming into the straight but came back to take second place by a nose. Paul Nicholls was pleased with the run, saying [...] "He's done the job we wanted. He had a really good blow and he'll come on a lot from this. Noel said he galloped {{all the way to the}} line, just what we had wanted.".Three weeks later Silviniaco Conti had his first start over fences of the season in the Betfair Chase, where after making most of the running and an error-free jumping round he was eventually challenged by his old rival Cue Card but couldn't find any more in the home straight finishing 7 lengths in the second place, which took his career winnings past the £1 million mark. A month later he attempted to win a third consecutive King George VI Chase but after setting the pace for the first and half circuit he began to drop off tamely, eventually being pulled out. Paul Nicholls later revealed [...] "We've had problems with him this year and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> <b>probably</b> just gone a bit soft... <b>I</b> <b>think</b> the Grand National is a good plan".|$|R
5000|$|... 3 time World's Strongest Man {{winner and}} 2 time IPF world {{champion}} Bill Kazmaier once stated, [...] "The first time I {{went to a}} powerlifting meet and saw Larry, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> was <b>probably</b> six or seven on his World Championships and he was pretty much-how would you say?-a god in powerlifting. He could go to any class that he wanted to. He could pretty much lift whatever weight {{on the day he}} wanted to." [...] 4 time IPF powerlifting champion and 1979 World's Strongest Man winner Don Reinhoudt said of Larry, [...] "I look at Larry, an idol to all of us here-nine time champion and Larry will always be the legend of all time to us." ...|$|R
5000|$|Following his {{involvement}} in the [...] "Lobbygate" [...] scandal, Draper was sacked from his job at the Daily Express and generally shunned by Labour insiders. His friend Peter Mandelson said that Draper [...] "has a fine intelligence, but sometimes I am afraid he misuses that intelligence. He gets above himself. But now he has been cut down to size and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>probably</b> <b>he</b> will learn a very hard lesson from what has happened." ...|$|R
6000|$|Then {{afterwards}} {{one of the}} elders, {{who thought}} deeply, had an idea. He was a great doctor among these people, their medicine-man, {{and he had a}} very philosophical and inventive mind, and the idea of curing Nunez of his peculiarities appealed to him. One day when Yacob was present he returned to the topic of Nunez. [...] "I have examined Nunez," [...] he said, [...] "and the case is clearer to me. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> very <b>probably</b> <b>he</b> might be cured." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{was never}} on {{intimate}} terms with John F. Kennedy," [...] Folliard {{said in a}} 1967 interview, [...] "but knew him reasonably well." [...] After Kennedy was elected president, Folliard [...] "wrote a story saying that the talk about Kennedy buying his victory was nonsense." [...] Folliard himself said, [...] "My admiration of Kennedy is just without limit. <b>I</b> just <b>think</b> <b>he</b> was <b>probably</b> the most brilliant President of our time." [...] Folliard accepted Pierre Salinger's claim that Kennedy had written [...] "the whole of his Inaugural Address," [...] which Folliard called [...] "the best Inaugural speech I ever heard." ...|$|R
2500|$|On 3 January 2017 Cartwright was {{presented}} his baggy green cap by former Australian cricketer Tom Moody {{to make his}} debut in third Test match against Pakistan, replacing Nic Maddinson. Cartwright averaged over 44.50 with the bat and had taken 15 wickets from 16 games at 44. Captain Steve Smith said Cartwright's bowling had [...] "improved a lot {{over the last year}} or so. I remember facing him a little while ago and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> since then <b>he's</b> <b>probably</b> gained 10ks and got a lot more consistent with his areas. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> improved a lot. I guess it depends how much we'll use him, how the game goes. But he's certainly improved over the last year." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He will return, in {{the course}} of a week or so. He is greatly {{interested}} in what he sees here, especially in the shipping, never having seen the sea before. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that, <b>probably,</b> <b>he</b> will remain for two or three years with his troop of two hundred men; and will then settle in the village, of which and the surrounding country he has received the jagheer. This, although not large, will suffice for him to live in comfort. It is but a few miles from Jooneer, and he will therefore be able to be near his friends, and pay frequent visits to his cousin Ramdass." ...|$|R
5000|$|Physically, Parker is {{described}} in the opening paragraphs of The Hunter as [...] "big and shaggy, with flat square shoulders... His hands, swinging curve-fingered at his sides, {{looked like they were}} molded of brown clay by a sculptor who thought big and liked veins. His hair was brown and dry and dead, blowing around his head like a poor toupee about to fly loose. His face was a chipped chunk of concrete, with eyes of flawed onyx. His mouth was a quick stroke, bloodless." [...] When asked about who he would cast as Parker, Westlake stated: [...] "Usually I don’t put an actor’s face to the character, though with Parker, in the early days, <b>I</b> did <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> looked something like Jack Palance. That may be partly because you knew Palance wasn’t faking it, and Parker wasn’t faking it either. Never once have I caught him winking at the reader." [...] In the The Man With the Getaway Face, Parker has plastic surgery in an attempt to evade The Outfit's retribution, so he's no longer recognizable to most who knew him before, though his general appearance (and the impression it makes on others) seems to be largely unchanged.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Shouldn't think so. For {{one thing}} <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> {{recognized}} me. <b>Probably</b> doesn't know me by sight, {{and he was}} fast asleep, too. No, I fancy I'm all right.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... “I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> have,” said Archie. “And {{the worst}} is, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> feels it! How much, who can tell, {{with such a}} being? But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> does.” ...|$|R
2500|$|In 2016, Belafonte {{endorsed}} Bernie Sanders for the Democratic Primary, saying [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> represents opportunity, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> {{represents a}} moral imperative, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> represents {{a certain kind}} of truth that's not often evidenced in the course of politics".|$|R

"Borges doesn't care, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> fires {{away and}} doesn't {{think about the}} fans or anyone else. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> fires away with honesty and candor with no other {{objective}} but to tell people what <b>he</b> really <b>thinks.</b> And if people don't like it, fuck 'em." [...] - Bob Ryan ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do you know," [...] said <b>he,</b> [...] "what <b>I</b> <b>think</b> of Captain Horn? <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> is a brave man, {{and a man}} {{who knows}} what to do when things turn up suddenly, but, for all that, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> is a tyrant. He does what he pleases, and he makes other people do what he pleases, and consults nobody." ...|$|R

5000|$|Steve Severin has {{attributed}} Smith's {{transition from}} a reticent figure to a more enigmatic front person to Smith's early experiences playing with Siouxsie and the Banshees [...] <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> learnt {{how to be a}} front person, just by standing next to Siouxsie {{for a couple of months}} every night. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> completely changed his persona on stage because of that; he came out of his shell. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>he</b> learnt how to be a bit more flamboyant, and how it was okay, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> saw how, y'know... how should I put it... Siouxsie's more [...] "diva" [...] moments were kind of acceptable because they were the front person, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> learnt how to get away with stuff. And just a bit about stagecraft, and how to use the audience a bit more. Because if you look at early clips of their performances you can see he's sort of much more shy and retiring than he becomes a bit later on, and of course, his whole look changes as well.|$|R
60|$|Wise, Yes, once, and again. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> brake twice or thrice.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, he's {{none the}} worse for it, <b>I</b> <b>think.</b> <b>He</b> has been taking walking exercise, and his {{stiffness}} is wearing off fast. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> misses you very much, and he wouldn't take his food the first day or two. He has got over it now, but I know he longs to hear your voice again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Such a pity!" [...] murmured Mrs. Dennant, and her kindly {{face looked}} quite disturbed. [...] "I've known him {{ever since he}} was a boy. Of course, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> made a great mistake to bring her down here. Not even bein' able to get married makes it doubly awkward. Oh, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> made a great mistake!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, child, he's {{waited so}} long, that I'm {{not sure it}} isn't a bit hard on him. You know, I like him, Fanny--though as you know quite well, <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> good enough for you. And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> so himself, poor fellow.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am positive. Boys, do {{you know}} what <b>I</b> <b>think?</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> is a sharper, and imagines he has three green country boys with money to deal with." ...|$|R
