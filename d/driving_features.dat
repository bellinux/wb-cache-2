50|$|Mercedes-Benz {{claimed the}} whole {{development}} process stretched over 48 months. In that time, it produced 1,200 prototypes and driven a combined 12 million kilometres {{in some of}} the world's toughest conditions, from sub-zero temperatures in the snow through to the world's hottest deserts. In testing the car, Mercedes-Benz also had its prototypes conduct over 10,000 autonomous braking procedures and 5,000 automated lane changes as part of the Distronic suite of semi-autonomous <b>driving</b> <b>features.</b> Moreover, it took 1,200 engineers to make the 2017 E-Class.|$|E
50|$|By 2017, Mercedes has vastly {{expanded}} its autonomous <b>driving</b> <b>features</b> on production cars: In {{addition to the}} standard Distronic Plus features such as an active brake assist, Mercedes now includes a steering pilot, a parking pilot, a cross-traffic assist system, night-vision cameras with automated danger warnings and braking assist (in case animals or pedestrians {{are on the road}} for example), and various other autonomous-driving features. In 2016, Mercedes also introduced its Active Brake Assist 4, which was the first emergency braking assistant with pedestrian recognition on the market.|$|E

50|$|This game {{delivers}} {{more realistic}} physics, sharper graphics, more golfers, caddies and courses than before. miniature golf games and online play for players with the Network Adaptor are also <b>driving</b> <b>features.</b> The developers increased the overall {{number of characters}} from 15 to 24, added more caddies (10 in all) and boosted the number of courses from six to 15. Of these 15 courses, 10 are new, while five are returning favorites from the previous game. The game also features a Tournament mode where up to 32 players can compete against each other. Cameo roles as playable characters in the North American and European versions are Ratchet (from the Ratchet & Clank series) and Jak (from the Jak and Daxter series, as he would later appear in Jak 3). Ratchet and Jak's caddies are Clank and Daxter, respectively. A Pipo Monkey (from the Ape Escape series) is an unlockable caddie in the Japanese and European versions only. The European version seems to have the largest character roster overall.|$|E
5000|$|In mid October 2015 Tesla Motors {{rolled out}} version 7 of their {{software}} in the U.S. that included Autopilot capability.

Tesla's autonomous <b>driving</b> <b>features</b> are ahead of production cars, and can be classified as is somewhere between level 2 and level 3 under the NHTSA five levels of vehicle automation. At this levels the car can act autonomously but requires the full attention of the driver, who {{must be prepared to}} take control at a moment's notice. Autopilot should be used only on limited-access highways, and sometimes it will fail to detect lane markings and disengage itself. In urban driving the system will not read traffic signals or obey stop signs. The system also does not detect pedestrians or cyclists.|$|E

Unfortunately, using a lower cost EVF has been the one of the main criticisms of what was otherwise considered very capable still camera. Apparently there are situations under which low resolution EVF is not easily usable. [...] In fact, other than the EVF and LCD changes, on paper at least, the G10 might even be considered more capable than the G1, because it has video capabilities where the G1 did not.|$|E
5000|$|On October 3, 2016, Henrik Fisker {{launched}} Fisker Inc., an American automaker {{designing and}} developing innovative electric vehicles with a longer range and lower cost of batteries. Fisker, {{the chairman and}} CEO of Fisker Inc., stated that the company will show its first prototype, a new sporty, spacious, luxury all-electric sedan, {{in the second half}} of 2017, which will be a [...] "spiritual successor" [...] to the Fisker Karma electric car. The company will produce a second, mass market, affordable electric vehicle following the first car's launch. Fisker Inc's long-range electric vehicles are targeting a minimum range of 400 miles per charge, which would be a far longer range than any electric vehicle to date. As of October 2016, the longest range electric car is on the high-end version of the Tesla Model S, with 315 miles on a single charge. Fisker first stated in July 2016 that he was interested in designing a fully connected electric car with autonomous <b>driving</b> <b>features</b> and an aesthetically pleasing look, and that for the past two years he had been working [...] "in stealth mode" [...] designing [...] "electric cars of the future." ...|$|E
5000|$|Due to Mercedes' {{history of}} {{gradually}} implementing advancements of their autonomous <b>driving</b> <b>features</b> {{that have been}} extensively tested, not many crashes that {{have been caused by}} it are known. One of the known crashed dates back to 2005, when German news magazine [...] "Stern" [...] was testing Mercedes' old Distronic system. During the test, the system did not always manage to brake in time. Ulrich Mellinghoff, then Head of Safety, NVH, and Testing at the Mercedes-Benz Technology Centre, stated that some of the tests failed due to the vehicle being tested in a metallic hall, which caused problems with the system's radar. Later iterations of the Distronic system have an upgraded radar and numerous other sensors, which are not susceptible to a metallic environment anymore. In 2008, Mercedes conducted a study comparing the crash rates of their vehicles equipped with Distronic Plus and the vehicles without it, and concluded that those equipped with Distronic Plus have an around 20% lower crash rate. In 2013, German Formula One driver Michael Schumacher was invited by Mercedes to try to crash a Mercedes C-Class vehicle, which was equipped with all safety features that Mercedes offered for its production vehicles at the time, which included the Active Blind Spot Assist, Active Lane Keeping Assist, Brake Assist Plus, Collision Prevention Assist, Distronic Plus with Steering Assist, Pre-Safe Brake, and Stop&Go Pilot. Due to the safety features, Schumacher was unable to crash the vehicle in realistic scenarios.|$|E

Then, these four mean and four standard deviation values are utilized to construct a feature vector consisting eight dimensions.

50|$|While {{commercial}} trainers on mini-computer systems had {{a longer}} history, {{the first two}} mass-market English 'computer game' railway simulators, MSTS and Trainz, arrived {{within a few months}} of one another in 2001 and could run (poorly) on Intel 80386 microprocessor based systems. Some, like the first wide-market release, Microsoft Train Simulator (MSTS), are written and modeled for the user mainly interested in driving. Others, like MSTS's principle rival, Trainz, were aimed initially primarily at the rail enthusiast-hobbyist markets, supporting features making it possible to build a virtual railroad of one's dreams. Accordingly, for four years Trainz releases bundled a free copy of gmax digital model building software on each CDROM, hosted an asset swap website (Trainz Exchange, later the Trainz Download Station), encouraged user participation and dialog with an active forum, and took pains to publish in-depth how-to model guidelines and specifications with its releases. Several other later challengers as well as Trainz (with a series of upgrades) soon matched or eclipsed MSTS's driving experiences one way or another. Railsim, actually a successor using the MSTS game engine upped the challenge to the aging MSTS by adding much improved graphics, so Trainz did as well, but also added interactive industries and dynamic <b>driving</b> <b>features</b> such as product loading and unloading, load-sensitive physics modeling affecting driving and operating and user interface changes to improve User eXperiences (UX), such as a free camera mode allowing roaming away from the train cars, free and clear of the Train being operated-while still controlling it. This latter makes particular sense given the dearth of an assistant on a walkie-talky while operating a train during coupling operations or other position sensitive tasks such as loading and unloading. Railsim and a couple of others came and went out of business, and Railsim was reorganized as Rail Simulator with the software company that wrote MSTS as its core, while MSTS aged and never did get upgraded as Microsoft had once begun and announced. In the last few years, Rail Simulator has changed its name to Train Simulator 2016. As the world market has shaken out, Australian Trainz in 2014-2015 upgraded itself with Trainz: A New Era, still servicing the wider route builder and driving markets, but now matching the 64bit computing and graphics of Train Simulator 2013, 2015, and Train Simulator 2016. In the same five-year period, Train simulators have moved to pad computer and phone platforms.|$|E

40|$|Accommodation is {{the process}} by which the eye lens changes optical power to {{maintain}} a clear retinal image as the distance to the fixated object varies.

Nonetheless, the visual system initially accommodates in the correct direction, implying that it exploits a cue with sign information. Here, we present a model of accommodation control based on such a cue: Longitudinal Chromatic Aberration (LCA). The model relies on color-opponent units, much like those observed among retinal ganglion cells, to make the computation required to use LCA to drive accommodation...|$|R

40|$|International audienceTruck drivers {{typically}} display different behaviors when facing various driving events, e. g., {{approaching a}} roundabout, and thereby {{have a major}} impact both on the fuel consumption and the vehicle speed. Within the context where fuel is increasingly a major cost center for merchandise transport companies, {{it is important to recognize}} different driver behaviors in order to be able to simulate them as closely to the real data as possible during the truck development process. In this paper, we introduce, instead of economic driving, the notion of rational driving which seeks to decrease the average fuel consumption while respecting the transport companies’ constraint, i. e., the delivery delay. Moreover, we also propose an indicator, namely rational driving index (RDI), which enables to quantify how good a driver behavior is with respect to the rational driving. We then investigate various <b>driving</b> <b>features</b> contributing to characterize a rational driver behavior, using real driving data collected from 34 different truck drivers on an extra-urban road section particularly representative of travel paths of trucks ensuring regional merchandise distribution. Given the fact that real driving data collected on an open road can differ in terms of environment, e. g.,weather, trafﬁc, we further study, through simulations on a digital representation of a roundabout, the impact of two major <b>driving</b> <b>features,</b> i. e., the use of coasting and crossing speed at roundabouts, with respect to rational driving. The experimental results from both real driving data and simulations show high correlations of these two <b>driving</b> <b>features</b> with respect to RDI and demonstrate that a good rational driver tends to decelerate slowly during braking periods (use of coasting) and have high crossing speed in roundabouts...|$|E
