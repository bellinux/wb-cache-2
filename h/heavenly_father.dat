25|$|On the son's return, {{the father}} treats {{him with a}} {{generosity}} far more than {{he has a right}} to expect.

25|$|Trinitarians {{believe that}} God the Father is not pantheistic, {{in that he}} is not viewed as {{identical}} to the universe, but exists outside of creation, as its Creator. He is viewed as a loving and caring God, a <b>Heavenly</b> <b>Father</b> who is active both in the world and in people's lives.

He is also celebrated on the 25th day of the 12th month, when he is believed to turn to the human world to inspect all goods and evils to determine awards or punishments.

25|$|According to the doctrine, Adam {{was once}} a mortal man who became resurrected and exalted. From another planet, he then came as Michael to form Earth. Adam brought Eve, one of his wives, with him to Earth, where they became mortal by eating the {{forbidden}} fruit in the Garden of Eden. After bearing mortal children and establishing the human race, Adam and Eve returned to their heavenly thrones where Adam serves as God and is the <b>Heavenly</b> <b>Father</b> of humankind. Later, Adam returned to the Earth to the ancient prophets, and to become the literal father of Jesus.|$|E

5000|$|Human beings {{would be}} born on Earth. There they {{would receive a}} {{physical}} body necessary to exaltation and a fullness of joy. On earth, they would be tested through trials of their faith, and be subject to mortality. A [...] "veil" [...] would be set in place to obscure humankind's memory of its divine origins, thus allowing for [...] "walking by faith" [...] and for greater freedom of choice by enabling individuals {{to make their own}} decisions. Latter-day Saints believe that only those who live good lives, prove themselves obedient to <b>Heavenly</b> <b>Father's</b> commandments, receive the ordinances of salvation, and repent of their sins will be able to return to <b>Heavenly</b> <b>Father's</b> presence (The Celestial Kingdom). However, because each person's experience in mortality is unique, every individual will be judged in accordance with the opportunities, knowledge, and blessings they had while living on Earth.|$|R

And again, so soon as I had been baptized by him, I also had the spirit of prophecy, when, standing up, I prophesied concerning the rise of this Church, and many other things connected with the Church, and this generation of the children of men. We were filled with the Holy Ghost, and rejoiced in the God of our salvation.|$|E
25|$|Marcion was a Church leader from Sinope (present-day Turkey), who preached in Rome around 150CE, but was {{expelled}} and {{started his own}} congregation, which spread throughout the Mediterranean. He rejected the Old Testament, and followed a limited Christian canon, which included only a redacted version of Luke, and ten edited letters of Paul. Some scholars do not consider {{him to be a}} gnostic, but his teachings clearly resemble some Gnostic teachings. He preached a radical difference between the God of the Old Testament, the Demiurge, and the highest God, who had sent Jesus to the earth to free mankind from the tyranny of the Jewish Law. Like the Gnostics, Marcion argued that Jesus was essentially a divine spirit appearing to men {{in the shape of a}} human form, and not someone in a true physical body. Marcion held that the <b>heavenly</b> <b>Father</b> (the father of Jesus Christ) was an utterly alien god; he had no part in making the world, nor any connection with it.|$|E
25|$|In Mainstream Christianity God is {{understood}} as a Trinity of three persons in one God, consisting of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. While in mainstream Christianity God is thought of in masculine terms, teachings generally state that God has no gender, except in his incarnation as Jesus Christ, {{due to the fact}} that He is a spiritual being. However, the names of Father and Son clearly imply masculinity, and the Gospel of John implies the masculinity of the Spirit by applying a masculine demonstrative pronoun to the grammatically neuter antecedent. Still, teachings regarding the gender and nature of God vary between Christian groups, and some clearly state that God is male. These include the teachings of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which explicitly describe God the Father as being male, corporeal, and separate in being from the Son, Jesus Christ. Unusually, Latter-day Saint teachings also indicate the existence of a Heavenly Mother, who is the wife of the <b>Heavenly</b> <b>Father,</b> and that together they are the spiritual parents of humankind. This reinforces the idea that God is analogous to our earthly fathers. However, these beliefs are not common among Christian groups, which generally see God as having both male and female attributes and therefore no need for a female counterpart.|$|E
