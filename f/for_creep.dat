Club, praised the episode, rated it an A−, and {{described}} Hutchison's role as [...] "the part that would launch [...] as a go-to character actor <b>for</b> <b>creep</b> parts". Phipps felt the climactic {{scene in which}} Tooms infiltrates Scully's home is [...] "the scene that makes the episode", noting that there was [...] "a real sense of peril" [...] despite it being clear that Scully, a lead character, {{was not going to}} come to harm. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, note that the episode's premise is the first in the series [...] "not to rely upon accepted urban legends". It conveys its [...] "absurd" [...] plot through suggestion, leaving any special-effects sequences of Tooms' abilities until the audience is [...] "already suitably adjusted to the absurdity". However, Shearman and Pearson found the monologue likening the crimes committed by Tooms to the Holocaust, given by the retired detective Briggs, to be [...] "not only unnecessary but tasteless to boot". They rated the episode four stars out of five. Mumtaj Begum, writing for Malaysia's The Star, described [...] "Squeeze" [...] as [...] "the episode that really sold The X-Files idea to the masses", and called it [...] "simply brilliant".|$|E

5000|$|Tower defense {{games have}} a very simple layout. Usually, {{computer-controlled}} monsters called creeps move along a set path, and the player must place, or [...] "build" [...] towers along this path to kill the creeps. In some games, towers are placed along a set path <b>for</b> <b>creeps,</b> while in others towers can interrupt creep movement and change their path. In most tower defense games different towers have different abilities such as poisoning enemies or slowing them down. The player is awarded money <b>for</b> killing <b>creeps,</b> and this money {{can be used to}} buy more towers, or buy upgrades for a tower such as increased power or range.|$|R
50|$|As {{construction}} projects rise above 984 feet, {{which is the}} minimum for supertall classification, precise calculations <b>for</b> <b>creep</b> and shrinkage become absolutely crucial. As a former research and development lab where the Pickett Effect and other important creep and shrinkage related theories and discoveries were made, CTLGroup was selected to perform much of the testing and consulting for numerous high profile projects, including the following: Trump Tower, Chicago; Al Hamra Tower, Kuwait; Freedom Tower, New York; Pentominium, Dubai; and the tallest building in the world, the Burj Khalifa, Dubai.|$|E
50|$|Creep {{and stress}} {{relaxation}} measures the elasticity, viscoelasticity and viscous behaviour of materials under a selected stress and temperature. Tensile geometry {{is the most}} common <b>for</b> <b>creep</b> measurements. A small force is initially imparted to keep the specimen aligned and straight. The selected stress is applied rapidly and held constant for the required time; this may be 1 h or more. During application of force the elastic property is observed as an immediate elongation or strain. During the constant force period the time dependent elastic response or viscoelasticity, together with the viscous response, result in further increase in strain.|$|E
5000|$|Empirical {{formulae}} {{have been}} developed for predicting the parameter valuesin the foregoing equations on the basis of concrete strength and someparameters of the concrete mix. However, they are very crude, leading to prediction errors with the coefficients of variation of about 23% <b>for</b> <b>creep</b> and 34% for dryingshrinkage. These high uncertainties can be drastically reduced by updatingcertain coefficients of the formulae according to short-time creep andshrinkage tests of the given concrete. For shrinkage, however, the weightloss of the drying test specimens must also be measured (or else the problem ofupdating [...] is ill-conditioned). A fully rational prediction of concrete creep and shrinkage properties from its composition is a formidable problem, far from resolved satisfactorily.|$|E

50|$|Under this model, if the {{material}} is put under a constant strain, the stresses gradually relax. When a material is put under a constant stress, the strain has two components. First, an elastic component occurs instantaneously, corresponding to the spring, and relaxes immediately upon release of the stress. The second is a viscous component that grows with time {{as long as the}} stress is applied. The Maxwell model predicts that stress decays exponentially with time, which is accurate for most polymers. One limitation of this model {{is that it does not}} predict creep accurately. The Maxwell model <b>for</b> <b>creep</b> or constant-stress conditions postulates that strain will increase linearly with time. However, polymers for the most part show the strain rate to be decreasing with time.|$|E
50|$|Each factor {{has more}} or less of an effect {{depending}} on the parameters of loading. In phase (IP) thermo-mechanical loading (when the temperature and load increase at the same time) is dominated by creep. The combination of high temperature and high stress is the ideal condition <b>for</b> <b>creep.</b> The heated material flows more easily in tension, but cools and stiffens under compression. Out of phase (OP) thermo-mechanical loading {{is dominated by the}} effects of oxidation and fatigue. Oxidation weakens the surface of the material, creating flaws and seeds for crack propagation. As the crack propagates, the newly exposed crack surface then oxidizes, weakening the material further and enabling the crack to extend. A third case occurs in OP TMF loading when the stress difference is much greater than the temperature difference. Fatigue alone is the driving cause of failure in this case, causing the material to fail before oxidation can have much of an effect.|$|E
