500|$|... "Three Words" [...] {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from critics. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, {{in their book}} Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode five stars out of five, calling it [...] "extremely well-performed by all concerned." [...] Shearman and Pearson felt that the episode {{was similar to the}} earlier [...] "Per Manum" [...] and was somewhat formulaic; however, they noted that this was a necessary and positive step towards redefining the series after the changes made in its last two seasons explaining [...] "the point of all this is only to emphasise how different The X-Files universe now feels, the familiarity of the ingredients only making us more aware that the mix is never <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> again". Writing for Television Without Pity, Jessica Morgan rated the episode a [...] "B", although she felt that by this stage the series' mythology was moving [...] "in concentric circles of pain and confusion".|$|E
500|$|Rivera {{exhibited}} a reserved demeanor {{on the field}} that contrasted with the emotional, demonstrative temperament {{of many of his}} peers. Hall of Fame closer Goose Gossage said that Rivera's composure under stress gave him the appearance of having [...] "ice water in his veins". Commenting on his ability to remain focused in pressure situations, Rivera said, [...] "When you start thinking, a lot of things will happen... If you don't control your emotions, your emotions will control your acts, and that's not good." [...] His ability to compartmentalize his successes and failures impressed fellow reliever Joba Chamberlain, who said, [...] "He's won and lost some of the biggest games in the history of baseball, and he's no worse for the wear when he gives up a home run." [...] Rivera explained the need to quickly forget bad performances, saying [...] "the game that you're going to play tomorrow is not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> game that you just played." [...] Derek Jeter called him the [...] "most mentally tough" [...] teammate with whom he had ever played.|$|E
500|$|By October 2013, Marvel was {{preparing}} four drama series and a miniseries, totaling 60 episodes, {{to present to}} video on demand services and cable providers, with Netflix, Amazon, and WGN America expressing interest. In November 2013, {{it was announced that}} Disney would provide Netflix with live-action series based on Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Iron Fist, and Luke Cage, leading up to a miniseries based on the Defenders. Disney CEO Bob Iger stated that Netflix was chosen to air the shows, [...] "when Disney realized it could use the streaming service as a way to grow the popularity of the characters". He added that, if the characters prove popular, they could become feature films. Loeb later stated that Marvel was not [...] "interested in making four pilots and then hoping someday that they could all get together. Netflix really understood what it is we wanted to do. They're very open to directors that might not have that same opportunity in broadcast television. The notion of having all 13 episodes at one time, particularly in serialized storytelling, is very appealing." [...] Loeb also added that the four characters chosen [...] "all had a previous existing relationship and all grew up on the same kind of stoop in New York [...] So it lent itself to a world. Does that mean these shows are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>same?</b> No. They can't be. The characters have different issues, different problems, different feelings about them ... the example that I continually give is that I cannot think of two films that are more different in tone than [...] and Guardians of the Galaxy. And yet, if you watch them back to back, they feel very Marvel. They feel very much like, 'Oh, it is still the same universe that I'm in.'" ...|$|E

500|$|On December 13, newly signed Mets closer Francisco Rodríguez {{added his}} sentiments to the fray. [...] "Of course we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> frontrunner. Of course we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> team <b>to</b> beat", Rodriguez told reporters. [...] "I don't want there <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a controversy. I don't want {{the other team}} to take it personally, or take it in a bad way. But I'm a really {{competitive}} guy. I like to win. If they ask me, 'Oh, which ballclub <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> win <b>the</b> National League East?' It's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> Mets. Easy question." ...|$|R

2500|$|SputnikMusic {{rated the}} album 4 out of 5, commenting, “Ulver {{have taken a}} decidedly more subtle {{approach}} to songwriting and the mood they’re attempting to create, but what a mood it is. The feeling that you get while listening to this album could best be summed up by the word “serenity”. Granted, it is a somber form of serenity, but the word still fits perfectly.” Adding, “If there are any problems that some may have with this new album it is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> thing {{that is going to}} make others love this album, and that is its subtlety. Whereas on Blood Inside and Perdition City the albums commanded your attention due to their frequent shift from soft to loud sections and their regular use of discordant sounds, Shadows of the Sun will easily fade away from your attention if you don’t give it the awareness it deserves.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Claude Vorilhon held {{a meeting}} in a Montreal hotel on September 21, 2000, where he {{announced}} that a wealthy American couple was willing to fund the Clonaid project. [...] The first pending clone, according to Vorilhon at the time, was the couple's 10-month-old girl, who had died due to a medical mistake. [...] He said that the couple {{was willing to pay}} $500,000 to clone their deceased daughter, but the wife was not willing to be the surrogate mother. [...] Jamie Grifo, a fertility specialist at the New York University School of Medicine, and Nobel laureate Paul Berg of Stanford University said that Vorilhon was providing a false hope that the child was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> one. [...] Boisselier revealed the roles of four scientists she says were involved—"a biochemist, a geneticist, a cell fusion expert and a French medical doctor"—but without revealing their identity.

2500|$|Robert Fisk {{asked if}} this was [...] "The end {{of the age of}} dictators in the Arab world?" [...] and partly {{answered}} the question in saying that Arab leaders would be [...] "shaking in their boots". He also pointed out that the [...] "despot" [...] Ben Ali sought refuge in the same place as the ousted Idi Amin of Uganda and that [...] "the French and the Germans and the Brits, dare we mention this, always praised the dictator for being a 'friend' of civilised Europe, keeping a firm hand on all those Islamists." [...] He notably pointed at the [...] "demographic explosion of youth" [...] of the Maghreb, though he said that the change brought about in Tunisia may not last. He thinks [...] "this is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> old story. Yes, we would like a democracy in Tunisia – but not too much democracy. Remember how we wanted Algeria to have a democracy back in the early Nineties? Then when it looked like the Islamists might win the second round of voting, we supported its military-backed government in suspending elections and crushing the Islamists and initiating a civil war in which 150,000 died. No, in the Arab world, we want law and order and stability." [...] He added that [...] "If it can happen in the holiday destination Tunisia, it can happen anywhere, can't it?" ...|$|E

She went on: [...] "You needn't answer. I'm used to being treated that way. I knew {{somebody}} had told you I was a medium. You despised me when you found out about me--everybody does, except those who want to use me. All the people I really want to know go by on the other side as if I were a leper.
