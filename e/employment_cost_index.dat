This study tested {{the usefulness of}} an indirect <b>index</b> of oxygen <b>cost,</b> the Physiological <b>Cost</b> <b>Index,</b> {{and the ability of}} this index to dis-criminate between healthy adults and stroke survivors. Methods. The authors studied 17 subjects with stroke and 10 healthy control participants. Participants walked 10 minutes at their chosen comfortable speed on a treadmill. Oxygen con-sumption and heart rate data were collected. Primary measures were oxygen cost and the Physiological <b>Cost</b> <b>Index.</b> Secondary measures were age and gait speed. Results. The Physiological <b>Cost</b> <b>Index</b> and oxygen <b>cost</b> had a good to excellent correlation (r =. 83, P <. 001) for subjects with stroke. Both oxygen cost and the Physiological <b>Cost</b> <b>Index</b> were comparable in detecting a significantly abnormal elevation for stroke survivors versus healthy adults (P =. 003 and. 002, respectively). Age was not correlated with oxygen cost, the Physiological <b>Cost</b> <b>Index,</b> or chosen gait speed.

Due to the inherent unavailability of up-to-date cost literature, several inflation or <b>cost</b> <b>indexes</b> are available.|$|R

40|$|Ecological <b>cost</b> <b>indices</b> can {{be defined}} as the {{cumulative}} consumption of non-renewable exergy connected with the fabrication of particular products. This cumulative consumption should comprise the additional exergy consumption of non-renewable resources resulting from the necessity of compensating the deleterious effects of the rejection of waste products to the environment. Ecological <b>cost</b> <b>indices</b> can be calculated by means of the system of linear balance equations of ecological <b>cost.</b> <b>Indices</b> calculated in this way, within the regional system, take into account the ecological <b>cost</b> <b>indices</b> of imported raw materials and imported semi-finished products. It is difficult to build up a set of balance equations to determine the indices of imported goods. In this paper the author proposes an iterative method of evaluating the ecological cost of imported goods. The results of sample calculations are also presented...|$|R
