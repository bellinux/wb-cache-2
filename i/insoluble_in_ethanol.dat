2500|$|Anthraquinone, {{also called}} anthracenedione or dioxoanthracene, is an {{aromatic}} organic compound with formula [...] Several isomers are possible, {{each of which}} {{can be viewed as a}} quinone derivative. The term anthraquinone, however, almost invariably refers to one specific isomer, 9,10-anthraquinone (IUPAC: anthracene-9,10-dione) wherein the keto groups are located on the central ring.

2500|$|Unlike the arthropods, velvet worms do {{not possess}} a rigid exoskeleton. Instead, their fluid-filled body cavity acts as a {{hydrostatic}} skeleton, similarly to many unrelated soft-bodied animals that are cylindrically shaped, for example sea anemones and various worms. Pressure of their incompressible internal bodily fluid on the body wall provides rigidity, and muscles are able to act against it. The body wall consists of a non-cellular outer skin, the cuticula; a single layer of epidermis cells forming an internal skin; and beneath this, usually three layers of muscle, which are embedded in connective tissues. The cuticula is about a micrometer thick and covered with fine [...] In composition and structure, it resembles the cuticula of the arthropods, consisting of α-chitin and various proteins, although not containing collagen. It {{can be divided into}} an external epicuticula and an internal procuticula, which themselves consist of exo- and endo-cuticula. This multi-level structure is responsible for the high flexibility of the outer skin, which enables the velvet worm to squeeze itself into the narrowest crevices. Although outwardly water-repellent, the cuticula is not able to prevent water loss by respiration, and, as a result, velvet worms can only live in microclimates with high humidity to avoid desiccation. The surface of the cuticula is scattered with numerous fine papillae, the larger of which carry visible villi-like sensitive bristles. The papillae themselves are covered with tiny scales, lending the skin a velvety appearance (from which the common name is likely derived). It also feels like dry velvet to the touch, for which its water-repellent nature is responsible. Moulting of the skin (ecdysis) takes place regularly, around every 14 days, induced by the hormone ecdysone. The inner surface of the skin bears a hexagonal pattern. At each moult, the shed skin is replaced by the epidermis, which lies immediately beneath it; unlike the cuticula, this consists of living cells. Beneath this lies a thick layer of connective tissue, which is composed primarily of collagen fibres aligned either parallel or perpendicular to the body's longitudinal axis. The colouration of Onychophora is generated by a range of pigments. The solubility of these pigments is a useful diagnostic character: in all arthropods and tardigrades, the body pigment is soluble in ethanol. This is also true for the Peripatidae, {{but in the case of}} the Peripatopsidae, the body pigment is <b>insoluble</b> <b>in</b> <b>ethanol.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this experiment was to evaluate the influence of preservation methods on the fermentation kinetics of carbohydrate fractions of fresh forage, hay and silage of oats, which have been harvested at the milky stage of grain ripening. Samples of unfractionated forage (WF), residue <b>insoluble</b> <b>in</b> 90 % <b>ethanol</b> (EIR) and isolated neutral detergent fibre (NDF) were fermented in vitro and the gas production was monitored. To obtain the gas production and fermentation kinetics of the ethanol-soluble fraction (A fraction) the gas produced from the EIR fermentation was subtracted from the WF gas at each time point. The same approach was used to obtain the gas production and fermentation kinetics of the fraction <b>insoluble</b> <b>in</b> 90 % <b>ethanol</b> but soluble <b>in</b> neutral detergent solution (B 1 fraction), by subtracting the isolated NDF gas curve from the corresponding EIR curve. The fractional maximum rate of gas production (RM) was lower for both preserved forages (p < 0. 01 for silage; p < 0. 05 for hay) than for fresh forage. Ensiling did not change {{the size of the}} A fraction but reduced by 40 % its RM (p < 0. 01) compared with fresh forage.
