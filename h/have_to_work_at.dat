25|$|The {{best thing}} {{was simply the}} {{privilege}} {{and the challenge of}} being able to take a shot at the first female captain, transcending stereotypes that I was very familiar with. I was able to do that in front of millions of viewers. That was a remarkable experience—and it continues to resonate. The downside of that is also that it continues to resonate, and threatens to eclipse all else in one's long career if one does not up the ante and stay at it, in a way that may not ordinarily be necessary. I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>at</b> changing and constantly reinventing myself in a way that probably would not have happened had Star Trek not come along. I knew that going in, and I think that all of the perks attached to this journey have been really inexpressively great. So the negatives are small.|$|E
500|$|Writing in The Times Literary Supplement, Philip Stead {{was more}} generous to Dr. No. Despite {{thinking}} that Fleming was offering [...] "too opulent a feast" [...] with the book, Stead argued that Fleming {{managed to pull}} this off, where [...] "a less accomplished writer... would never have got away with this story." [...] Raymond Chandler reviewed the novel for The Sunday Times and praised as [...] "masterly" [...] Fleming's depiction of colonial Kingston in the first chapter. Chandler admired Fleming's writing, which had [...] "an acute sense of pace.... You don't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>at</b> Ian Fleming. He does the work for you." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Marc and Claire Headley, two Scientologists {{who left}} the Church in 2005, {{residents}} at the base {{are not permitted to}} leave without the permission of a supervisor and <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>at</b> least 16 hours a day, from 8 am to past midnight, with shorter hours on Sundays and little time for socialising. Communications with the outside world are effectively cut off; cellphones and Internet access are generally banned, mail is censored and passports are kept in a locked filing cabinet. The perimeter of the base is closely guarded around the clock. It is ringed with high fences that are topped with spikes and razor wire and monitored by inward-facing motion sensors to detect anyone trying to climb out of the compound. The Tampa Bay Times reported that dozens of workers tried to escape from the base– some of them repeatedly– but were caught and returned by Sea Org [...] "pursuit teams". The escapees are said to have been subjected to isolation, interrogation and punishment on their return to the compound.|$|E

2500|$|Scouting for a {{supporting}} cast to play opposite her began. Dan Castellaneta, a relative unknown, {{was asked to}} read for the show after he was spotted by Ullman at Chicago's Second City. Castellaneta's portrayal of a blind {{man who wants to}} be a comedian brought her to tears instead of making her laugh. Actress Julie Kavner had co-starred in Brook's spin-off series to The Mary Tyler Moore Show, Rhoda, starring Valerie Harper. Kavner played Harper's younger, socially awkward sister Brenda, a role for which she won an Emmy Award. Kavner was at the top of the list of people Brooks wanted to be part of the show. Brooks on Kavner: [...] "When somebody's intrinsically funny -- you know, in-their-bones funny -- they never <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>at</b> (being funny), so they're free to work on other things. We were all nuts about her work. She was the person we most wanted to work with Tracey." [...] Actor Sam McMurray read for a guest spot on the show playing William, lover of thirteen-year-old valley girl Francesca's (Ullman) father. McMurray recalling his casting: [...] "The first Francesca sketch, they said, 'Play the guy not so gay.' And I said 'I disagree.' I had a big mouth then -— still do. I said, 'I think he’s more the woman. I think he's more out there.' So I read and I read it big, and they cast me. It was just a one-off, and then we were on hiatus. I did the one week, and I had a friend coincidentally who used to write, a guy named Marc Flanagan, and he was on the show as a staff guy. He called me up and said, 'Did they call your agent?' I said, 'No, why?' He said, 'They wanna make you a regular.'" [...] Another actor who was originally cast for a guest shot which led to becoming a series regular was choreographer Joseph Malone. [...] The show now had its cast.|$|E

6000|$|At Carrie's, Tanis did not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>at</b> being hostess. She was dignified and sure, a clear fine {{figure in}} the black chiffon frock he had always loved; and in the wider spaces of that ugly house Babbitt was able to sit quietly with her. He repented of his first revulsion, mooned at her feet, and happily drove her home. Next day he bought a violent yellow tie, to make himself young for her. He knew, a little sadly, {{that he could not}} make himself beautiful; he beheld himself as heavy, hinting of fatness, but he danced, he dressed, he chattered, to be as young as she was [...] . as young as she seemed to be.|$|E

50|$|Looking more {{in depth}} at this poem makes clear what Shel Silverstein is saying. Do what the {{children}} do. They know {{the place where}} the sidewalk ends. And in doing so, you will find the joy and passion for life that they have. When he says to follow the markings of the children and you will find {{the place where the}} sidewalk ends, it is not a literal command to physically follow them. Rather he is saying put on the mindset of a child and you will, in turn, find the imagination and joy and innocence that children have. Children do not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>at</b> finding the place where the sidewalk ends, they know. They know because they know nothing else, the joyful, imaginative mindset they have is purely natural. While adults minds have been influenced by the hardships of the world, and in turn <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>at</b> finding the place where the sidewalk ends. Adults must leave behind the black smoke and look beyond the dark streets that come with adulthood in order to truly find the place where the sidewalk ends.|$|E

Along with his gluttony, Gus is quite lazy, often doing little if any work on Grandma's farm. He also has a {{tendency}} of falling asleep at random occasions, sometimes even standing up. On occasion Gus has even shown signs of ingenuity as to finding methods or solutions to make his chores much easier for him and at times even automating them so he does not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>at</b> all.|$|E

After deciding nothing, except that violence is good, they disperse. Dolores, the Sheriff’s daughter, talks to Gus, her ex, who tries to woo her, failing. They then sing and flirt about how they do not care that their relationship is over (I Wish I Were in Love Again).|$|E

"to hear Brahms's {{music on}} an {{instrument}} like the Streicher {{is to realize}} that the thick textures we associate with his work, the sometimes muddy chords in the bass and the occasionally woolly sonorities, come cleaner and clearer on a lighter, straight-strung piano. Those textures, then, are not a fault of Brahms's piano composition. To be sure, any sensitive pianist can avoid making Brahms sound murky on a modern piano. The point is that the modern pianist must strive to avoid that effect, must work at lightening the dark colors, where Brahms himself, playing his Streicher, did not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>at</b> it." ...|$|E
