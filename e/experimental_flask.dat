60|$|It remains yet in {{the order}} of logic, though not of history, to show that among these solid destructible {{particles}} there really do exist germs capable of giving rise to the development of living forms in suitable menstrua. This piece of work was done by M. Pasteur in those beautiful researches which will ever render his name famous; and which, in spite of all attacks upon them, appear to me now, as they did seven years ago, to be models of accurate experimentation and logical reasoning. He strained air through cotton-wool, and found, as Schroeder and Dusch had done, that it contained nothing competent to give rise to the development of life in fluids highly fitted for that purpose. But the important further links in the chain of evidence added by Pasteur are three. In the first place he subjected to microscopic examination the cottonwool which had served as strainer, and found that sundry bodies clearly recognisable as germs were among the solid particles strained off. Secondly, he proved that these germs were competent to give rise to living forms by simply sowing them in a solution fitted for their development. And, thirdly, he showed that the incapacity of air strained through cotton-wool to give rise to life was not due to any occult change effected in the constituents of the air by the wool, by proving that the cotton-wool might be dispensed with altogether, and perfectly free access left between the exterior air and that in the <b>experimental</b> <b>flask.</b> If the neck of the flask is drawn out into a tube and bent downwards; and if, after the contained fluid has been carefully boiled, the tube is heated sufficiently to destroy any germs which may be present in the air which enters as the fluid cools, the apparatus may be left to itself for any time and no life will appear in the fluid. The reason is plain. Although there is free communication between the atmosphere laden with germs and the germless air in the flask, contact between the two takes place only in the tube; and as the germs cannot fall upwards, and there are no currents, they never reach the interior of the flask. But if the tube be broken short off where it proceeds from the flask, and free access be thus given to germs falling vertically out of the air, the fluid, which has remained clear and desert for months, becomes, in a few days, turbid and full of life.|$|E

40|$|Cultures of Cyclotella meneghiniana and Melosira varians {{were split}} into four flasks. Two flasks of each taxon {{were used for}} {{exposure}} experiments and two were used as controls. Exposure to 1, 3, 5 -trichlorobenzene was initiated in one flask of each taxon in the 1 lth hour of the light period on a 16 : 8 h L/D regime. Another exposure was initiated four hours later in the same day (the 15 th hour of the light period) in the second <b>experimental</b> <b>flask</b> of each taxon. These experiments were conducted at 15 °C and 20 °C for 2 – 4 days and were analyzed for lipid class composition. Cyclotella demonstrated some short-term changes in lipid class composition when exposures were initiated in the 11 th hour of the light cycle at 20 °C and in both exposures at 15 °C. In contrast, short-term effects were only observed in Melosira when the exposure was initiated in the 11 th hour of the light period at 20 °C. Control cells demonstrated periodicities in lipid composition {{that appeared to be}} entrained with the light/dark cycle. The cultures that demonstrated toxicity effects were characterized by low triacylglycerol content, low neutral/polar lipid ratios, and a pattern of chlorophyll synthesis at the time of exposure. It is suggested that rapidly growing cells are more susceptible to short term effects of this trichlorobenzene isomer. Furthermore, timing of the initial exposure may alter toxicity results and this may be a consequence of lipid class composition at the time of exposure...|$|E

Cadmium analysis of the samples revealed that Cd concentration varying from 2. 31 µg L - 1 to 8. 96 µg L - 1 in water, 0. 55 µg g - 1 to 25. 44 µg g - 1 in soil and 0. 45 µg g - 1 to 22. 90 µg g - 1 in sediment. Cadmium resistance studies of the bacterial isolates showed that out of 164 isolates collected most of them showed  low resistance (1500 µg/ml. Ten bacterial genera were represented in soil and 11 from water, while only 5 bacterial genera were recorded from sediment samples.   Bacillus, pseudomonas and Enterobacter were found in soil, sediment and water samples. Results of cadmium removal study revealed that with increase in time, the biomass of the selected Pseudomonas sp. increased.

30|$|The Miller-Urey (Miller and Urey 1959) (MU) {{experiment}} {{showed that}} amino acids can form from certain plausible early Earth prebiotic components and a sparking exergy source. However, the greater {{importance of the}} MU experiment might lie elsewhere. The MU experiment generated a small-scale natural experimentation model involving both exploration search and chemical information addition through polymerisation. Chemical information addition generated high-molecular-weight tholins {{at the bottom of}} the <b>experimental</b> <b>flask.</b> These tholins represent the point of experimental exhaustion. Prolonged experimentation did not influence the outcome, as heavy molecules excluded themselves from further experiments by accumulating away from the exergy source. In this case, reduced diffusion of chemical information through over-polymerisation exhausted the experimentation process. Unrestricted polymerisation is a problem requiring further consideration, as overcoming this obstacle on early Earth might have been a decisive pathway for further chemical evolution into individual entities rather than a giant polymerised rubbery blob, which could have formed instead. For evolution to produce several cooperating or competing agents, there must be a naturally present condition that limits polymer overgrowth (Walker et al. 2012). The MU experiment showed another profound property of nature: nature can conduct inventive experimentation, a form of natural selection, without heredity and/or self-replication. Experiments are conducted in parallel with the direct production of experimental chemicals without the need to replicate these materials from a template. In the MU experiment, a sparking source induced gaseous components to excite, ionise, and subsequently decay. Excited and ionised components primarily relaxed and recombined, but while in an excited state, some components bond to other neighbouring molecules. The end-results only showed chemical products with decay times long enough to survive until a human observer evaluated them.|$|E

40|$|Sponges have {{traditionally}} been viewed as rather unselective filter feeders, and therefore as potential biofilters to remediate microbial water pollution. Here we show that the assumed connection between the ability of sponges to feed on microbes and the potential biotechnological use of such an ability to reduce microbial pollution {{is more complex than}} assumed. In a laboratory feeding experiment combined with a transmission electron microscopy study, we assessed the potential of the marine sponge Hymeniacidon perlevis to ingest and digest 3 common pathogenic microbes occurring in coastal waters: 2 bacteria (Escherichia colt and Vibrio anguillarum), and 1 marine yeast Rhodotorula sp. All 3 microbes were ingested by the sponge, but selectively, at different rates and following different cellular mechanisms. Yeast cells were processed very atypically by the sponge. Differences in the ingestion and digestion pathways led to large differences in the effectiveness of the sponge to remove the microbes. While sponge grazing reduced the concentration of E. colt and Rhodotorula sp. to levels far below the initial values, sponges were ineffective in abating concentrations of the most infective bacterium, V anguillarum. This bacterium, which was digested more slowly than E. coli, proliferated in the <b>experimental</b> <b>flasks</b> at much higher rates than it was grazed. These findings raise the question whether sponges are suitable for bioremediation of microbial pollution, since selective or preferential ingestion of certain bacteria by sponges may end up fueling growth of those grazed less, such as Vibrio spp...|$|R

However, the study on PAN biological remediation for mangrove sediment is deficient. Enriched PAH-degrading microbial consortium and electron acceptor amendment are considered as two effective measures. Compared to other electron acceptors, the study on CO 2, which is used by methanogens, is still seldom. This study investigated the effect of NaHCO 3 amendment on the anaerobic biodegradation of four mixed PAHs, namely fluorene (Fl), phenanthrene (Phe), fluoranthene (Flua) and pyrene (Pyr), with or without enriched PAH-degrading microbial consortium in mangrove sediment slurry. The trends of various parameters, including PAN concentrations, microbial population size, electron-transport system activities, electron acceptor and anaerobic gas production were monitored. The results revealed that the inoculation of enriched PAN-degrading consortium {{had a significant effect}} with half lives shortened by 7 - 13 days for 3 -ring PAHs and 11 - 24 days for 4 -ring PAHs. While NaHCO 3 amendment did not {{have a significant effect on}} the biodegradation of PAHs and other parameters, except that CO 2 gas in the headspace of <b>experimental</b> <b>flasks</b> was increased. One of the possible reasons is that mangrove sediment contains high concentrations of other electron acceptors which are easier to be utilized by anaerobic bacteria, the other one is that the anaerobes in mangrove sediment can produce enough CO 2 gas even without adding NaHCO 3.

40|$|Acid rmne {{drainage}} (AMD) {{is a major}} pollution problem througbout the world, adversely affecting both {{surface and}} groundwaters. AMD is principally associated with the mining of sulphide ores. The most commonly associated minerals being sulphur, copper, zinc, silver, gold, lead and uranium. As conventional methods for removing heavy metals from wastewater are often prohibitively expensive, the implementation of biological processes {{for the removal of}} heavy metals has become a realistic practice. The objectives of this project was firstly to establish the effect of copper, lead and nickel, heavy metals commonly found in AMD waters, on the enzyme carbonic anhydrase, which {{is an integral part of}} the carbon concentrating mechanism (CCM) and secondly, to determine the feasibility of using the alkalinity generated by Spindina for the precipitation of heavy metals from solution. Initially, batch flask experiments were performed and it was found that the algae were able to utilise the bicarbonate supplied in the medium, under CO, limiting conditions, through the induction of their CCM, resulting in the generation of carbonate. The effect of the inhibitors, acetazolamide (AZ) and ethoxyzolamide (EZ), were also investigated in order to determine the importance of carbonic anhydrase (CA) in inorganic carbon accumulation and photosynthesis. Results obtained were consistent with those observed in literature and it was found that at IOOf. LM AZ and EZ, complete inhibition of photosynthesis and carbonic anhydrase occurred, with no oxygen being evolved. The results obtained from the inhibitor experiments substantiate the findings that carbonic anhydrase is an important part of the CCM, and that the dehydration of bicarbonate to carbon dioxide and hydroxide ions, is in fact an enzymatic process regulated by the enzyme carbonic anhydrase and is essential for efficient photosynthesis. The effect of heavy metals on Spirulina was also investigated. Lead, copper and nickel were all found to cause a reduction in the synthesis of chlorophyll a, which resulted in a decrease in photosynthetic efficiency and eventually death of the culture. The morphology of the algae was also severely affected by heavy metals, with degradation and aJmost complete disintegration of the algal filaments occurring. Using the Wilbur-Anderson assay method, carbonic anhydrase activity was found to be lower in the <b>experimental</b> <b>flasks</b> containing heavy metals, than the control flasks, reducing the algae's ability to utilise the bicarbonate in solution for effective photosynthesis. The Wilbur-Anderson assay method did not prove to be a reliable method for measuring changes in enzyme activity as results were found to be erratic. Therefore attempts were made to use an oxygen electrode as an alternative method for determining the effects of various parameters on enzyme activity and photosynthesis, this proved to be more successful. Because of the toxic effects of heavy metals on Spirulina it was decided that the use of the biogenic alkalinity generated by the algae for the precipitation of heavy metals may be successfully employed as an alternative method for bioremediation and metal recovery. Carbonate reacts readily with metals, therefore the carbonate produced by this algal system was used for the precipitation of metals. It was possible to categorise the precipitation reactions observed into three groups, namely those metals which, a) precipitate as hydroxides, b) precipitate as carbonates generated from the dissociation of bicarbonate and c) metals which can only precipitate if there is free carbonate present in solution...|$|R

40|$|Phosphorus (P), a major {{nutrient}} for plants, is a finite non-renewable resource of modern agriculture. Nevertheless, {{the efficiency of}} P usage today hardly reaches 20 % with the rest ending in wastewater or carried away by runoff from fields to rivers and to the oceans. In our study, we will investigate the potential to close the cycle from waste back to agriculture by exploiting the capability of microalgae to accumulate large P quantities. This potential of algae for a ‘luxury P uptake’ will be combined {{with the benefit of}} delayed release of P from the algal biomass applied as a fertilizer to soil. To achieve our goals, first we selected best suitable algae subspecies of Clorella vulgaris with regard to maximal P incorporation. Afterwards, the pre-culture conditions were optimized in regard of tracer uptake. In several experiments we compared the behavior of washed and different starved out algae in the following, simple <b>experimental</b> setup: erlenmayer <b>flasks</b> with algae in radioactive labelled nutrition solution (in form of orthophosphate) were gently shaked in an incubator under appropriated illumination. In various time intervals sampling occurs and the aliquots were centrifuged. The sedimented, labelled algae were digested with concentrated HNO 3. Thereafter, both, the digested solutions derived from the sediments as well as the supernatants containing still free orthophosphate were measured in the liquid scintillation counter (LSC) for their activities. Effects of lighting were additional investigated as well as the possibility to label greater amounts by means of using algae different optical depths. As result, main influence to achieve fast and possibly complete incorporation of the label is an extreme low, but not missing phosphorous content in the nutrition solution, as we studied by systematic investigations using hungry algae out of the pre-culture. In future, (in such way) labelled algae shall be used for rhizotrone experiments to study how P in algae derived fertilizer deploys to the soil and is taken up by wheat plants by means of bioimaging.

Interfacial area, a, volumetric mass-transfer coeffcient, kLa, and the power input per unit volume, epsilonv, of the liquid were predicted to be 300 <a< 800 m 2. m(- 3), 10 <kLa< 100 h(- 1) and 40 <epsilonv< 600 W. m(- 3) respectively. These values are {{significantly different from the}} reported range for laboratory and pilot-scale bioreactors used in the fermentation of bacterial and fungal micro-organisms (100 <a< 300 m 2. m(- 3), 100 <kLa< 400 h(- 1) and 1000 <epsilonv< 3000 W. m(- 3)). Our analysis showed that, at the highest shaking frequency and amplitude of operation, the specific power input in the shake flask was much lower than in laboratory bioreactors. Bacterial and fungal micro-organisms require dissolved oxygen concentrations typically in the range 50 - 250 mmol of O 2. h(- 1). litre(- 1), corresponding to volumetric mass-transfer coefficients, kLa, in the range of 250 - 400 h(- 1). Poor mixing and dissolved-oxygen limitation in shake flasks may limit their use in process design and media optimization in fermentation. In contrast, mammalian cells have relatively low demand for oxygen and consequently require a lower specific power input, this being typically between 1 and 10 W. m(- 3), allowing efficient operation in shake <b>flasks.</b> <b>Experimental</b> data presented as part of the present study showed that mammalian cell growth in shake flasks was essentially independent of the specific power input, the maximum specific cell growth rate being 0. 056 h(- 1). The corresponding maximum oxygen-uptake rate was 0. 74 mmol of O 2. h(- 1). litre(- 1) for a viable cell count of 1. 3 x 10 (6) cells. ml(- 1). These values are comparable with reported values for laboratory and pilotscale bioreactors. This analysis suggests that growth of mammalian cells in shake flasks (and hence in laboratory bioreactors) is not limited by the gas-liquid mass-transfer rate. In mammalian cell cultures, the requirement for good mixing is driven by other considerations, including the need for good cell suspension and reduction in heterogeneity, for example, in pH, temperature, nutrient concentration, osmolality and lactate/glucose ratio.
