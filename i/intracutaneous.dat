50|$|PGA suture is {{classified}} as a synthetic, absorbable, braided multifilament. It is coated with N-laurin and L-lysine, which render the thread extremely smooth, soft and safe for knotting. It is also coated with magnesium stearate and finally sterilized with ethylene oxide gas. It is naturally degraded in the body by hydrolysis and is absorbed as water-soluble monomers, completed between 60 and 90 days. Elderly, anemic and malnourished patients may absorb the suture more quickly. Its color is either violet or undyed and it is sold in sizes USP 6-0 (1 metric) to USP 2 (5 metric).

The to-be-attended hand and stimulated finger varied randomly from trial to trial. Participants had to press a foot pedal only when the relevant stimulus, varied between participants, occurred at the attended hand. EEG was measured to extract relevant ERP components. Results: The N 100 and N 150 were enhanced for attended as compared to unattended stimuli. The N 100, N 150, P 260, and the P 500 were enlarged for five pulse as compared to single pulse stimuli. The P 260, which is thought to reflect a call for attention, was enhanced for unattended as compared to attended stimuli. Source analyses indicate that attentional effects on the N 100, N 150, and P 260 may be related to changes in activity in secondary somatosensory areas and the anterior cingulate cortex.

This was studied in serum-free organ cultures of microdissected human scalp HFs and skin, i. e. excluding pituitary, neural and vascular inputs. Prolactin expression was confirmed at the gene and protein level in human truncal skin, where its expression significantly increased (p = 0. 049) during organ culture. There was, however, no evidence of PRL secretion into the culture medium as measured by ELISA. PRL immunoreactivity (IR) in female human epidermis was decreased by substance P (p = 0. 009), while neither the classical pituitary PRL inhibitor, dopamine, nor corticotropin-releasing hormone significantly modulated PRL IR in HFs or skin respectively.
