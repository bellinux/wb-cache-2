40|$|Investors {{can access}} foreign {{diversification}} opportunities through either {{foreign portfolio investment}} (FPI) or foreign direct investment (FDI). By combining data on US outbound FPI and FDI, this paper analyzes whether the composition of US outbound capital flows reflect efforts to bypass home country tax regimes and weak host country investor protections. The cross-country analysis indicates that a 10 % decrease <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>country's</b> corporate tax rate increases US investors' equity FPI holdings by 21 %, controlling for effects on FDI. This suggests that the residual tax on foreign multinational firm earnings biases capital flows to low corporate tax countries toward FPI. A one standard deviation increase <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>country's</b> investor protections is shown {{to be associated with}} a 24 % increase in US investors' equity FPI holdings. These results are robust to various controls, are not evident for debt capital flows, and are confirmed using an instrumental variables analysis. The use of FPI to bypass home country taxation of multinational firms is also apparent using only portfolio investment responses to within-country corporate tax rate changes <b>in</b> <b>a</b> panel from 1994 to 2005. Investors appear to alter their portfolio choices to circumvent home and host country institutional regimes. ...|$|R

5|$|Apparently formidable, the Libyan {{military}} disposition in Chad was {{marred by}} serious flaws. The Libyans were prepared for a war {{in which they would}} provide ground and air support to their Chadian allies, act as assault infantry, and provide reconnaissance. By 1987, however, Muammar Gaddafi had lost his allies, exposing Libya's inadequate knowledge of the area. Libyan garrisons came to resemble isolated and vulnerable islands in the Chadian Sahara. Also important was the low morale among the troops, who were fighting <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>country,</b> and the structural disorganization of the Libyan army, which was in part induced by Gaddafi's fear of a military coup against him. This fear led him to avoid the professionalization of the armed forces.|$|E

The findings suggest that services with a French brand name are perceived as more hedonic. In the context of hedonic services, the incongruence between brand names <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>foreign</b> language and <b>country</b> of origin leads to increased perceptions of services as more hedonic. In the context of utilitarian services, the same incongruence leads to higher perceived suitability and preference for brand names <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>foreign</b> language.

5|$|One {{issue that}} has arisen is whether a Singaporean who votes <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>country</b> where {{the right to vote}} is not {{exclusive}} to nationals of that country is disqualified from voting in a Singapore election. For instance, the United Kingdom permits citizens of Commonwealth countries, including Singapore, who are resident in the UK and have leave to remain there (or do not require such leave) to register to vote in general elections and local government elections. When queried, the Elections Department stated that since suffrage in the UK is not exclusive to British citizens, Singaporeans who vote there are still eligible to vote in Singapore.

5|$|In 1670, Gabriel Mouton, a French abbot and astronomer, {{published}} the book Observationes diametrorum solis et lunae apparentium {{in which he}} proposed a decimal system of measurement of length for use by scientists in international communication, {{to be based on}} the dimensions of the Earth. The milliare would be defined as a minute of arc along a meridian and would be divided into 10 centuria, the centuria into 10 decuria and so on, successive units being the virga, virgula, decima, centesima, and the millesima. Mouton used Riccioli's estimate that one degree of arc was 321,185 Bolognese feet, and his own experiments showed that a pendulum of length one virgula would beat 3959.2 times in half an hour. Current pendulum theory shows that such a pendulum would have had an equivalent length of 205.6mm – using today's knowledge of the size of the earth, the virgula would have been approximately 185.2mm. He believed that with this information scientists <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>country</b> would be able to construct a copy of the virgula for their own use.|$|E
5|$|Interest rate parity is a no-arbitrage {{condition}} representing an {{equilibrium state}} under which investors will be indifferent to interest rates available on bank deposits in two countries. The {{fact that this}} condition does not always hold allows for potential opportunities to earn riskless profits from covered interest arbitrage. Two assumptions central to interest rate parity are capital mobility and perfect substitutability of domestic and foreign assets. Given foreign exchange market equilibrium, the interest rate parity condition implies that the expected return on domestic assets will equal the exchange rate-adjusted expected return on foreign currency assets. Investors then cannot earn arbitrage profits by borrowing {{in a country with}} a lower interest rate, exchanging for foreign currency, and investing <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>country</b> with a higher interest rate, due to gains or losses from exchanging back to their domestic currency at maturity. Interest rate parity takes on two distinctive forms: uncovered interest rate parity refers to the parity condition in which exposure to foreign exchange risk (unanticipated changes in exchange rates) is uninhibited, whereas covered interest rate parity refers to the condition in which a forward contract has been used to cover (eliminate exposure to) exchange rate risk. Each form of the parity condition demonstrates a unique relationship with implications for the forecasting of future exchange rates: the forward exchange rate and the future spot exchange rate.|$|E

40|$|Investors {{can access}} foreign {{diversification}} opportunities through either {{foreign portfolio investment}} (FPI) or foreign direct investment (FDI). The worldwide tax regime employed by the U. S. potentially distorts this choice by penalizing FDI, relative to FPI, in low-tax countries. On the other hand, weak investor protections in <b>foreign</b> <b>countries</b> may increase the value of control, creating an incentive to use FDI rather than FPI. By combining data on US outbound FPI and FDI, this paper analyzes whether the composition of US outbound capital flows reflects these incentives to bypass home and host country institutional regimes.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a rationale for}} split decisions <b>in</b> antidumping cases. <b>A</b> split decision occurs when the U.

Among these multi-country investigations, roughly 30 % concluded with <b>a</b> split decision <b>in</b> {{the final stage of}} an investigation. The model in this paper shows that selectively applying antidumping duties against <b>foreign</b> <b>countries</b> that are selling increased quantities of imports at a price below long run average total cost improves the importing country's welfare. Imperfectly competitive firms in different countries face stochastic demand and are subject to capacity constraints. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> result, <b>foreign</b> firms dump when they face weak demand in their own markets. In response to the shift <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>country's</b> export supply, the importing country's optimal rent-shifting tariff against the <b>foreign</b> <b>country</b> with weak demand increases while its optimal tariff against other countries falls. This paper suggests an economic rationale behind the differential treatment afforded to different countries accused of dumping. ...|$|R
