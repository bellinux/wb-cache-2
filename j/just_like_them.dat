It {{ends with a}} slight coda including a strummed ukulele by Harrison (an instrument {{he was known to}} have played often) and the voice of John Lennon played backwards. The message, when played in reverse, is [...] "Turned out nice again", which was the catchphrase of George Formby. The final result sounds like [...] "made by John Lennon", which, according to McCartney, was unintentional and was only discovered after the surviving Beatles reviewed the final mix. When Starr heard McCartney and Harrison singing the harmonies, and later the finished song, he said that it sounded <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>them</b> [...] He explained his comment by saying that he looked at the project as [...] "an outsider". Lynne fully expected the finished track to sound like the Beatles, as that was his premise for the project, but Harrison added: [...] "It's gonna sound like them if it is them... It sounds like them now." ...|$|E

[...] "The world will always have simpletons enough, <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>them,</b> {{fighting}} and dying for they know not what, and fancying that posterity will take the trouble to put laurel wreaths on their rusty and battered helmets.

60|$|After this {{conversation}} another letter was {{written to the}} Court of Hungary, saying that if the youth, now in the palace, was not sent to Turkey within three days, a large army would cross the border. The king's heart was sorrowful as he read, for he was grateful to the lad {{for what he had}} done to help him; but the boy only laughed, and bade the king fear nothing, but to search the town instantly for two youths just like each other, and he would paint himself a mask that was <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>them.</b> And the sword at his side clanked loudly.|$|E

Two are in South Africa now, an' another's on a whaling voyage, an' one's travellin' with a circus--he does trapeze work. An' I guess I'm <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>them.</b> I've taken care of myself since I was eleven--that's when my mother died.

How you would have laughed, and cried, [...] because we are <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>them.</b> In the {{combined}} army two thousand [...] have only bowie-knives or clubs. Some have long rifles of Daniel [...] Boone's time, not fired for thirty years. And the impedimenta are a [...] sight. Open wagons and conestogas and carryalls and buggies, and [...] even barouches, weighted down with frying-pans and chairs and [...] feather beds. But we've got spirit, and we can whip Lyon's Dutchmen [...] and Yankees just as we are. Spirit is what counts, and the Yankees [...] haven't got it, I was made to-day a Captain of Cavalry under [...] Colonel Rives. I ride a great, raw-boned horse like an elephant.

60|$|Next to Mr. Rhodes, to me {{the most}} {{interesting}} convulsion of nature in South Africa was the diamond-crater. The Rand gold fields are a stupendous marvel, and they make all other gold fields small, but I was not a stranger to gold-mining; the veldt was a noble thing to see, {{but it was only}} another and lovelier variety of our Great Plains; the natives were very far from being uninteresting, but they were not new; and as for the towns, I could find my way without a guide through the most of them because I had learned the streets, under other names, in towns <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>them</b> in other lands; but the diamond mine was a wholly fresh thing, a splendid and absorbing novelty. Very few people in the world have seen the diamond in its home. It has but three or four homes in the world, whereas gold has a million. It is worth while to journey around the globe to see anything which can truthfully be called a novelty, and the diamond mine is the greatest and most select and restricted novelty which the globe has in stock.|$|E

You and I are <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>them.</b> There is no difference, except that we have eaten more and better. I am eating them now, and you too. But in the past you have eaten more than I have. You have slept in soft beds, and worn fine clothes, and eaten good meals. Who made those beds? and those clothes? and those meals? Not you. You never made anything in your own sweat. You live on an income which your father earned. You are like a frigate bird swooping down upon the boobies and robbing them of the fish they have caught. You are one with a crowd of men who have made what they call a government, who are masters of all the other men, and who eat the food the other men get and would like to eat themselves. You wear the warm clothes. They made the clothes, but they shiver in rags and ask you, the lawyer, or business agent who handles your money, for a job.” ...|$|E

And nobody DID see 'em, only ONE Chinaman wot they met a mile from the camp, burnin' punk to his joss or devil, and he scooted away just in the contrary direction. Well, sir, when they waltzed into that camp, darn my skin! ef there was a Chinaman there, or as much as a grain of rice to grab! Somebody had warned 'em! Well! this sort o' got the boys, and they set about discoverin' how it was done. One of 'em noticed that there was some of them bits of tissue paper slips that they toss around at funerals lyin' along the road near the camp, and another remembered that the Chinaman they met on the hill tossed a lot of that paper in the air afore he scooted. Well, sir, the wind carried just enough of that paper straight down the hill into that camp ten minutes afore THEY could get there, to give them Chinamen warnin'--whatever it was! Fact!

50|$|Comedian Judah Friedlander {{is known}} for his {{signature}} trucker hats, which bear various humorous phrases. Having worn trucker hats since the 1980s, Friedlander claims a fondness for them and has ignored any rejecting or embracing fashion trends surrounding the hats throughout the decades. In a 2007 interview, he stated:I was never into anything trendy. If I'm ever doing something that happens to be trendy, it's probably a coincidence and I don't even realize it's trendy. Just a note: I've been making and wearing trucker hats for years--since the '80s actually, when those were pretty much the only kind of hats you could get. I remember about 10 years ago, people used to make fun of me for wearing trucker style hats. And then when they became trendy a couple years ago, those same people {{came up to me and}} said shyly, 'Uhm, where do you get your hats? I need to get some.' Years ago, some people used to get angry with me for wearing them and someone even called me racist for wearing a trucker hat 'cause I looked like a redneck. I bet now, some people think I'm a loser for wearing them because now they're out of fashion. But you know what, I never wore 'em to be 'in' or trendy or cool. I <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>'em.</b> And I'll be wearing them long after they're a not a trend.|$|R
