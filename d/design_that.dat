5|$|A {{total of}} 51 {{proposals}} were submitted {{and added to}} an online poll in July. Two finalist designs were presented to the Provo City Council in September, featuring a stylized mountain against a white or blue field. On January 6, 2015, the Provo City Council unanimously selected the city's new flag, a new <b>design</b> <b>that</b> incorporated the city's new logo (adopted in 2012).|$|E
5000|$|Due to {{the design}} {{components}} of FPGA into logic blocks, simple <b>designs</b> <b>that</b> underutilize a single block suffer from gate underutilization, as do <b>designs</b> <b>that</b> overflow onto multiple blocks, such as <b>designs</b> <b>that</b> use wide gates. [...] Additionally, the very generic architecture of FPGAs lends to high inefficiency; multiplexers occupy silicon real estate for programmable selection, and an abundance of flip-flops to reduce setup and hold times, even if the design does not require them, resulting in 40 times less density than of standard cell ASICs.|$|R
5000|$|Supported by Paine's ambitious plans, in August 1969 the ILRV {{program was}} re-defined to be a [...] "maximum effort" [...] design, and only fully {{reusable}} designs would be accepted. This {{led to a}} second series of Phase A studies. The <b>designs</b> <b>that</b> were returned varied widely, meeting the huge payload range specified in the original RFP. Two basic fuselage designs {{seemed to be the}} most common; lifting body <b>designs</b> <b>that</b> offered high cross-range but limited maneuverability after re-entry, and delta-winged <b>designs</b> <b>that</b> reversed these criteria.|$|R
50|$|To {{minimize}} obstruction {{when the}} D-ring {{is not in}} use, recessed tie-down rings are <b>designed</b> <b>that</b> accommodate the D-ring so it is flush to the surface. There are some non-recessed <b>designs</b> <b>that</b> have an adhesive base. The corresponding work load limits (WLL) must not be exceeded.|$|R
5|$|According to Walter Bolliger, {{development}} of the Wing Coaster began between 2007 and 2008. In 2010, Bolliger & Mabillard announced a prototype Wing Coaster <b>design</b> <b>that</b> would be built at Merlin Entertainments' Gardaland. It became known as Raptor, which opened on 1 April 2011. A year later, Merlin Entertainments opened a second Wing Coaster on 15 March 2012, called The Swarm at Thorpe Park.|$|E
5|$|Architecturally, {{the castle}} is unusual for this period. Its design appears {{somewhat}} backward, particularly {{in comparison to}} the nearby fortification of Harry's Walls, built {{at the same time as}} the castle, but which adopted a more contemporary <b>design</b> <b>that</b> employed bastions. Its closest equivalents are the blockhouses built by Henry VIII on the River Thames.|$|E
5|$|Based on the {{mechanical}} experience {{gained from the}} Merchant Navy locomotives, Bulleid incorporated his chain-driven valve gear into what became the new design. This now-infamous component was unique in British locomotive design. It gained notoriety because {{it was difficult to}} access when things went wrong and, in tandem with the fast-moving Bulleid steam reverser, could cause irregular valve movements. The entire system was in a sealed oil bath, another unique <b>design,</b> <b>that</b> provided constant lubrication to the moving parts.|$|E
40|$|The {{design of}} an {{organization}} needs to fit its situation. <b>Designs</b> <b>that</b> fit produce higher organizational performance than <b>designs</b> <b>that</b> do not.   This article uses the concept of fit to show how to align organizational designs to three important situational factors: competitive strategy, organization size, and task uncertainty. </p...|$|R

50|$|Alan Arnold Griffith had {{published}} {{a paper on}} turbine design in 1926. Subsequent work at the Royal Aircraft Establishment investigated axial turbine <b>designs</b> <b>that</b> {{could be used to}} supply power to a shaft and thence a propeller. From 1929, Frank Whittle began work on centrifugal turbine <b>designs</b> <b>that</b> would deliver pure jet thrust.|$|R
5|$|Ceolnoth, Archbishop of Canterbury {{throughout}} Æthelwulf's reign, also minted coins {{of his own}} at Canterbury: {{there were}} three different portrait designs, thought to be contemporary {{with each of the}} first three of Æthelwulf's Canterbury issues. These were followed by an inscribed cross <b>design</b> <b>that</b> was uniform with Æthelwulf's final coinage. At Rochester, Bishop Beornmod produced only one issue, a cross-and-wedges design which was contemporary with Æthelwulf's Saxoniorum issue.|$|E
5|$|Heim's atome {{was more}} attuned {{to the sense of}} propriety of the 1940s and a bigger hit than Réard's design but Réard's was the <b>design</b> <b>that</b> won the public's {{imagination}} over time. Though Heim's design was the first worn on the beach and sold more swimsuits, it was Réard's description of the two-piece swimsuit as a bikini that stuck. Modern bikinis were first made of cotton and jersey.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, the Marine Racecar Board of the National Academy of Science {{conducted}} a survey of industry experts regarding {{the pros and cons}} of double-hull design. Some of the advantages of the double-hull <b>design</b> <b>that</b> were mentioned include ease of ballasting in emergency situations, reduced practice of saltwater ballasting in cargo tanks decreases corrosion, increased environmental protection, cargo discharge is quicker, more complete and easier, tank washing is more efficient, and better protection in low-impact collisions and grounding.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} achieve the desired {{performance}}, Lockheed chose a minimalist approach: a <b>design</b> <b>that</b> would achieve high performance by wrapping the lightest, most aerodynamically efficient airframe possible around a single powerful engine.

5|$|In the 1880s, Esteban Martínez, {{the parish}} priest of the ruined church, {{approached}} Spanish architect Genaro Palacios {{with a plan}} to build a fire and earthquake-resistant structure made entirely of steel. Palacios completed a <b>design</b> <b>that</b> fused Earthquake Baroque with the Neo-Gothic style. His final design was said to have been inspired by the famed Gothic Burgos Cathedral in Burgos, Spain.|$|E
5|$|Located at the {{southwest}} corner of Ellis Avenue and 55th Street, the Ratner Center has an award-winning <b>design</b> <b>that</b> substitutes a complex external mast and counterweight system for interior support devices to allow for large open-space areas inside the building.

5|$|On 28 March 1939, {{the head}} of RAF Bomber Command Air Chief Marshal Sir Edgar Ludlow-Hewitt hosted a conference {{on the state of}} Bomber Command. Among the many {{problems}} with operational readiness, he noted that that RAF bombs were much too small and that bombsight technology was obsolete. Given the problems of obtaining a modern bombsight, he pressed {{for the creation of a}} high-speed bomber <b>design</b> <b>that</b> could safely attack at low levels.|$|E
5|$|Swimwear and {{underwear}} have similar design considerations, both being form-fitting garments. The main difference is that, unlike underwear, swimwear {{is open to}} public view. The swimsuit was, and is, following underwear styles, and {{at about the same}} time that attitudes towards the bikini began to change, underwear underwent a redesign towards a minimal, unboned <b>design</b> <b>that</b> emphasized comfort first.|$|E

5|$|The He 111Z Zwilling was a <b>design</b> <b>that</b> entailed {{the mating}} of two He 111s. The design was {{originally}} conceived to tow the Messerschmitt Me 321 glider.
