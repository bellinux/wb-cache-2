5|$|In the 1950s Chen was {{appointed}} {{director for the}} upcoming film Li Shizhen. However, due to his <b>insistence</b> <b>that</b> the director, rather than government administrators, have artistic control, he was dismissed and the film was directed by his friend Shen Fu.|$|E
5|$|This episode, {{inspired}} by the 1982 horror film The Entity, was written due to <b>insistence</b> <b>that</b> the creators write more episodes where Mulder and Scully help people. This allowed the writers some space to create other episodes they had in mind.|$|E
5|$|The CCP {{views the}} world as {{organized}} into two opposing camps; socialist and capitalist. They insist that socialism, {{on the basis of}} historical materialism, will eventually triumph over capitalism. In recent years, when the party has been asked to explain the capitalist globalization occurring, the party has returned to the writings of Karl Marx. Despite admitting that globalization developed through the capitalist system, the party's leaders and theorist argue that globalization is not intrinsically capitalist. The reason being that if globalization was purely capitalist, it would exclude an alternative socialist form of modernity. Globalization, as with the market economy, therefore does not have one specific class character (neither socialist nor capitalist) according to the party. The <b>insistence</b> <b>that</b> globalization is not fixed in nature comes from Deng's <b>insistence</b> <b>that</b> China can pursue socialist modernization by incorporating elements of capitalism. Because of this there is considerable optimism within the CCP that despite the current capitalist dominance of globalization, globalization can be turned into a vehicle supporting socialism.|$|E

5000|$|He {{took part}} in the third series of German reality show Ich bin ein Star - Holt mich hier raus! in 2008 but was evicted by RTL Television for making a Nazi salute and singing [...] "Deutschland Über Alles" [...] in the lobby of his hotel shortly before the team left for the jungle, despite his <b>insistences</b> <b>that</b> he was merely joking.|$|R
5000|$|Congress {{has denied}} the President the {{legislative}} authority to create military commissions {{of the kind}} at issue here. Nothing prevents the President from returning to Congress to seek the authority he believes necessary. ... Where, as here, no emergency prevents consultation with Congress, judicial <b>insistence</b> upon <b>that</b> consultation does not weaken our Nation's {{ability to deal with}} danger. To the contrary, <b>that</b> <b>insistence</b> strengthens the Nation's ability to determine—through democratic means—how best to do so. The Constitution places its faith in those democratic means. Our Court today simply does the same.|$|R
5|$|At {{the time}} Kanō stood 1.57 m (5feet 2inches) but weighed only 41kg (90pounds). He wished he were stronger. One day, Nakai Baisei (a {{friend of the}} family {{who was a member of}} the shogun's guard), {{mentioned}} that jūjutsu was an excellent form of physical training. He showed Kanō a few techniques by which a smaller man might overcome a larger and stronger opponent. Kanō decided he wanted to learn the art despite Nakai's <b>insistence</b> <b>that</b> such training was out of date and somewhat dangerous. Kanō's father also discouraged him from jūjutsu, telling him to pursue a modern sport instead.|$|E
5|$|Doggett, {{acting on}} Reyes' <b>insistence</b> <b>that</b> Ed is in danger, stakes out his house. Ed, however, is skinned {{regardless}} of Doggett's attempts to protect him. Reyes admits to Doggett {{that she is}} having flashes of the same premonitions that the victims are experiencing. She tells Doggett that Ed's body was gagged with a rag coated in coal dust from a mine, even though she has never seen his body. Reyes and Doggett head to the mine from which they believe the dust originated. Doggett finds the skeleton of a sheriff who killed himself in 1909.|$|E
5|$|He {{was asked}} to leave the college in 1908 after {{offering}} a stranded chorus girl tea and his bed for the night when she {{was caught in a}} snowstorm. When she was discovered the next morning by the landladies, Ida and Belle Hall, his <b>insistence</b> <b>that</b> he had slept on the floor was met with disbelief. Glad to be free of the place, he left for Europe soon after, sailing from New York in March 1908.|$|E
50|$|Despite {{numerous}} importunings from on high, Walters flatly refused to...cast a {{cloak of}} national security over the guilty parties. At the critical moment, he... refused to involve the Agency, and bluntly informed {{the highest levels of}} the executive branch <b>that</b> further <b>insistence</b> from <b>that</b> quarter would result in his immediate resignation.|$|R
6000|$|Though {{he still}} didn't {{understand}} {{her he was}} as nice as if he had; he didn't ask for <b>insistence,</b> and <b>that</b> was {{just a part of}} his looking after her. He simply protected her now from herself, and there was a world of practice in it. [...] "Oh, we must talk about these things!" ...|$|R
50|$|It {{was due to}} the <b>insistence</b> of Bellerose <b>that</b> from 1877, {{the record}} of debates in the Canadian Senate was {{translated}} into French, a reminder of his roots in Quebec.|$|R
5|$|It {{was finally}} {{accepted}} by BBC North in 1986, {{a result of}} a spare budget being assigned for a second series of Happy Families that would never arise, and producer Paul Jackson's <b>insistence</b> <b>that</b> Red Dwarf should be filmed instead. The show was lucky to be remounted after an electricians' strike partway through rehearsals in early 1987 shut the entire production down (the title sequence was filmed in January 1987). The filming was rescheduled for September, and the pilot episode finally made it onto television screens on 15 February 1988.|$|E
5|$|McNallen is a {{controversial}} {{figure in the}} Heathen and wider Pagan community. His espousal of right-wing ethnonationalist ideas and his <b>insistence</b> <b>that</b> Heathenry should be reserved for those of Northern European ancestry has resulted in accusations of racism from both Pagans and the mainstream media. Conversely, many on the extreme right of the Heathen movement have {{accused him of being}} a race traitor for his opposition to Neo-Nazism and refusal to endorse white supremacism.|$|E
5|$|On 23 August, dos Santos {{complained that}} the U.S. and South African governments {{continued}} to fund UNITA, warning such activity endangered the already fragile ceasefire. The next day Savimbi announced UNITA would no longer abide by the ceasefire, citing Kaunda's <b>insistence</b> <b>that</b> Savimbi leave the country and UNITA disband. The MPLA government responded to Savimbi's statement by moving troops from Cuito Cuanavale, under MPLA control, to UNITA-occupied Mavinga. The ceasefire broke down with dos Santos and the U.S. government blaming {{each other for the}} resumption in armed conflict.|$|E
50|$|This is an {{interesting}} result, as it implies <b>that</b> <b>insistence</b> on the criterion of envy-freeness increases the social gaps and harms the most unfortunate citizens. The criterion of proportionality is much less harmful.|$|R
50|$|Marsh tells Mildred about Cherry, {{that she}} is a notorious prostitute known from Sitka to San Francisco. He lies, telling Mildred that Cherry got the loan by {{spending}} the night with Hilliard at Boyd's <b>insistence,</b> and <b>that</b> she is more than Boyd's business partner. Mildred ends her engagement, despite Boyd's protests of innocence. Boyd, meanwhile, breaks up with Cherry when she cannot deny how she got the money.|$|R
5000|$|The {{beginning}} of Season 2 reveals Colin's fate. The entire town blames Andy for [...] "killing" [...] Colin. They stop {{going to his}} practice and shun his children. Andy stands by his decision and eventually admits to Ephram {{that he could have}} saved Colin's life, but he would have been mentally and physically disabled and, at Colin's <b>insistence,</b> promised <b>that</b> he would not let him live that way.|$|R
5|$|Talks between Michael Eisner and Pixar CEO Steve Jobs over renewal {{terms for}} the highly lucrative Pixar-Disney {{distribution}} deal {{broke down in}} January 2004. Jobs in particular disagreed with Eisner's <b>insistence</b> <b>that</b> sequels such as the then in-development Toy Story 3 (2010) would not count against the number of films required in the studio's new deal. To that end, Disney announced the launching of Circle 7 Animation, a division of Feature Animation which would have produced sequels to the Pixar films, while Pixar began shopping for a new distribution deal.|$|E
5|$|The album's {{songs are}} characterised by metronomic pop, vocal harmonies, hand claps, {{prominent}} electric guitar riffs, bright synthesizers, a homogeneous sound and message, and rotations of lead vocals. The members' voices are presented individually on the record, and its lyricism speaks of falling in love, unrequited love, the <b>insistence</b> <b>that</b> flaws are what {{make a person}} unique, commitment, jealousy, and longing for past significant others. Take Me Home garnered mostly positive reviews from music critics. There was praise for its quality of production, while criticism hinged on its generic, rushed nature.|$|E
5|$|This {{episode was}} created on Fox's <b>insistence</b> <b>that</b> the creators write more episodes where Mulder and Scully help people. This episode was written to {{accomplish}} that, {{and to allow}} the writers some space to create other episodes they had in mind. Co-writer Glen Morgan claims the episode {{was inspired by the}} movie The Entity. The name Tom Braidwood, the show's assistant director who later played Lone Gunmen member Melvin Frohike, is used in the scene where the parking lot attendant paints over the name of Howard Graves. The episode featured guest appearances by Barry Primus, Lisa Waltz, Lorena Gale and Veena Sood.|$|E
6000|$|Is it strange, therefore, {{that in this}} {{challenge}} flung at me with such <b>insistence,</b> a business <b>that</b> at first I disliked grew presently to beckon me with its novelty and its promise of new sensations? ...|$|R
2500|$|Bimba {{was active}} in the United Toilers of America, a [...] "legal" [...] trade union-oriented {{splinter}} organization splitting from the underground Communist Party of America, and was one of 7 persons elected that group's first National Executive Committee by its founding conference held in New York City in February 1922. Along with the majority of the United Toilers, Bimba would rejoin the mainline CPA due to Comintern <b>insistence</b> later <b>that</b> same year.|$|R
5000|$|Shortly {{after leaving}} Wall $treet Week, Rukeyser began a new program, Louis Rukeyser's Wall Street (named {{after one of}} his newsletters) on the cable channel CNBC. Highly unusual for a cable network, {{advertising}} on the show was limited to before-and-after [...] "underwriting" [...] announcements similar to those on non-commercial broadcast stations. This was done at Rukeyser's <b>insistence,</b> so <b>that</b> WLIW, the secondary PBS station in the New York area, could offer the program to its viewers on the weekend.|$|R
5|$|After the war Cockcroft {{became the}} {{director}} of the Atomic Energy Research Establishment (AERE) at Harwell, where the low-powered, graphite-moderated GLEEP became the first nuclear reactor to operate in western Europe when it was started on 15 August 1947. This was followed by BEPO in 1948. Harwell was involved {{in the design of the}} reactors and the chemical separation plant at Windscale. Under his direction it took part in frontier fusion research, including the ZETA program. His <b>insistence</b> <b>that</b> the chimney stacks of the Windscale reactors be fitted with filters was mocked as Cockcroft's Folly until the core of one of the reactors ignited and released radionuclides during the Windscale fire of 1957.|$|E
5|$|At the time, {{the injury}} was still {{believed}} to be minor and Cloutier volunteered to continue playing in lieu of backup Mathieu Garon also being sidelined with a broken finger. When {{the pain in his}} hip quickly got worse, Cloutier appealed to team management. He saw a specialist who diagnosed him with a torn hip labrum and told him the injury could put his career in jeopardy. He was subsequently flown to Colorado for surgery on January 12, 2007. Cloutier remained in Colorado for ongoing treatment and was lodged by the organization in a motel 31 miles away from the clinic. The Kings' original <b>insistence</b> <b>that</b> he play and his subsequent lodging proved to be a contentious issue for Cloutier.|$|E
5|$|Despite Mihardja's <b>insistence</b> <b>that</b> Atheis {{is meant}} to be realistic, several {{symbolic}} interpretations have been put forward. According to Mihardja, {{one of the most common}} interpretations readers conveyed to him was that Hasan's death symbolised atheism defeating religion, with Hasan's death as the death of theism. According to Maier, Atheis serves as an allegory for the development of the Indonesian nation. Hasan, representing traditionalism, is killed by the Japanese, who changed the status quo when they invaded in 1942. Meanwhile, the anarchistic Anwar finds himself without a place in the modern world. Only the responsible modern character, Rusli, is able to bring the Indonesian nation, as represented by Kartini, to terms with the new world.|$|E
50|$|According to William Montgomery Watt, Abd-Allah ibn Ubayy was {{attempting}} to stop the expulsion, and Muhammad's <b>insistence</b> was <b>that</b> the Qaynuqa must leave the city, but was prepared to be lenient about other conditions; Ibn Ubayy argument was that presence of Qaynuqa with 700 fighting men {{can be helpful in}} the view of the expected Meccan onslaught. Because of this interference and other episodes of his discord with Muhammad, Abdullah ibn Ubayy earned for himself the title of the leader of hypocrites (munafiqun) in the Muslim tradition.|$|R
50|$|Despite {{having little}} formal {{education}} himself, his father wanted {{his children to}} have that advantage. Joshua Speed was tutored by his maternal grandfather, Joshua Fry, and attended St. Joseph's College near Bardstown. Before completing college, however, he fell ill. He returned home and, despite his father's <b>insistence,</b> argued <b>that</b> {{he was ready to}} begin a career. He spent two to three years as a clerk in the largest wholesale establishment in Louisville. He then moved to Springfield, Illinois where he became a country merchant.|$|R
60|$|Otherwise, as I say, {{the day was}} depressing. It was {{not merely}} the tramp through the sand dunes that was regrettable, though heaven knows I would not willingly take it again. The sand had far too hospitable a trick of holding on to you at every step to be to my liking. Besides, the sun, which had come out with summer <b>insistence,</b> chose <b>that</b> {{particular}} spot for its midday siesta, and lay there at full length, while the air was preternaturally still. It was a stupidly drowsy heat that gave no fillip to the feet.|$|R
5|$|Despite Peter's <b>insistence</b> <b>that</b> he is fit to {{continue}} to be the leader of the new community, the townspeople run him out of New Quahog, and his family follows him. Meanwhile, the eggs that stewie laid up hatch, revealing the octopus-Stewies. The citizens proceeds to burn the guns Peter had made with the pipes {{in the middle of the}} town square, but as the final gun in thrown onto the pile, hundreds of newly spawned Octopus-Stewies begin to destroy the city, with the townspeople unable to protect themselves from the mutants. As the family walks away, oblivious to the town's destruction, they decide {{to continue}} to a Carvel factory in Framingham.|$|E
5|$|Following Anwar Sadat's {{ascension}} to the Egyptian presidency, Libya's {{relations with}} Egypt deteriorated. Over the coming years, the two {{slipped into a}} state of cold war. Sadat was perturbed by Gaddafi's unpredictability and <b>insistence</b> <b>that</b> Egypt required a cultural revolution akin to that being carried out in Libya. In February 1973, Israeli forces shot down Libyan Arab Airlines Flight 114, which had strayed from Egyptian airspace into Israeli-held territory during a sandstorm. Gaddafi was infuriated that Egypt had not done more to prevent the incident, and in retaliation planned to destroy the , a British ship chartered by American Jews to sail to Haifa for Israel's 25th anniversary. Gaddafi ordered an Egyptian submarine to target the ship, but Sadat cancelled the order, fearing a military escalation.|$|E
5|$|However, Hornsby {{was often}} {{hard to get}} along with, a major reason he changed teams so {{frequently}} {{in the last decade}} of his career. He usually left due to falling out with the front office. Most of the players he managed did not like him due to his <b>insistence</b> <b>that</b> others follow his lifestyle, although some (like Woody English and Clint Courtney) did. Hornsby never played cards, but he did bet frequently on horse races, and he lost more than he won. His gambling was often a factor in his dismissal from a team. By most contemporary accounts, he was at least as mean and nasty as Cobb, who was known in his time for his aggressive attitude and dirty play. He never went to movies or read books, convinced that it would harm a batter's eyesight, and he never smoked or drank.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the "ontological gerrymandering" critique and subsequent controversies in the constructionist studies of social problems. After glancing over {{three kinds of}} responses to this critique within the constructionist camp, I focus on their coping with the self-referential aspect of the constructionist perspective. Further, I take up political and moral concerns in constructionism. My <b>insistence</b> is <b>that</b> within these concerns one can find one clue to overpass the epistemological and methodological difficulties in constructionism. In conclusion, I address {{a question of the}} pragmatic justification in the studies of social problems...|$|R
50|$|Some Muslim diplomats {{would go}} on later to help draft other UN human rights treaties. For example, Iraqi diplomat Bedia Afnan's <b>insistence</b> on wording <b>that</b> {{recognized}} gender equality resulted in Article 3 within the ICCPR and ICESCR. Pakistani diplomat Shaista Suhrawardy Ikramullah also spoke in favor of recognizing women's rights.|$|R
50|$|In 1949, Grant {{left the}} studio, yet Disney story men were {{continually}} pulling Grant's original drawings and story {{off the shelf}} to retool. A solid story began taking shape in 1953, based on Grant's storyboards and Greene's short story. Greene later wrote a novelization of the film that was released {{two years before the}} film itself, at Walt Disney's <b>insistence,</b> so <b>that</b> audiences would be familiar with the story. Grant did not receive film credit for his story work, an issue that animation director Eric Goldberg hoped to rectify in the Lady and the Tramp Platinum Edition's behind-the-scenes vignette that explained Grant's role.|$|R
