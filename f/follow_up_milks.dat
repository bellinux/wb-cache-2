40|$|Dairy herd-level {{prevalence}} of Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP), causative agent of Johne’s disease (JD), Mycoplasma spp., and Bovine Viral Diarrhea (BVD) virus were estimated in Utah and surrounding states and compared to previous surveillance results. Milk was collected at 3 - 4 day intervals on 5 dates (duplicate samples) from each bulk tank on participating farms, samples analyzed separately. One frozen sample was shipped to {{a laboratory for}} JD/MAP testing with ELISA and real-time PCR, the other paired sample was shipped to another laboratory for mycoplasma and BVD testing. Mycoplasma was cultured on modified Hayflick medium, standard methods; BVD testing was real-time, RT-PCR. 151 / 209 (72 %) eligible dairy farms participated. Farms detected positive (some had multiple diseases) were: 58 JD (38 %); 4 mycoplasma (3 %); 14 BVD (9 %). Sensitivity of testing was: 284 / 528 milks = 54 % for JD, 17 / 61 = 28 % for mycoplasma (lower than previous reports), 41 / 117 = 35 % for BVD. Of 67 herds positive for JD in 2009, 28 (42 %) remained positive, 14 (21 %) became test-negative, and 25 (37 %) were lost to <b>follow</b> <b>up.</b> Of 16 herds positive for mycoplasma in 2007, one (6 %) remained positive, 8 (50 %) became testnegative, and 7 (44 %) were lost to <b>follow</b> <b>up.</b> Bulk <b>milk</b> remains a practical way to screen dairy herds for presence of JD, mycoplasma and BVD, provided that repeated sampling is used. Mycoplasma-positive herds {{were more likely to}} become test-negative in bulk milk in subsequent years than were JD-positive herds.

40|$|Abstract Background Breastfeeding is a {{cost-effective}} public health intervention that reduces infant {{morbidity and mortality}} in developing countries. In Lebanon, breastfeeding exclusivity and continuation rates are disappointingly low. This qualitative study aims at identifying barriers and promoters of breastfeeding in the Lebanese context by exploring mothers' perceptions and experiences in breastfeeding over a one year period. Methods We conducted focus group discussions in three hospitals in Beirut, Lebanon, and <b>followed</b> <b>up</b> 36 breastfeeding mothers with serial in-depth interviews for one year post-partum or until breastfeeding discontinuation. Results Themes generated from baseline interviews revealed several positive and negative perceptions of breastfeeding. Longitudinal <b>follow</b> <b>up</b> identified insufficient <b>milk,</b> fear of weight gain or breast sagging, pain, sleep deprivation, exhaustion, or maternal employment, as reasons for early breastfeeding discontinuation. Women who continued breastfeeding for one year were more determined to succeed and overcome any barrier, relying mostly on family support and proper time management. Conclusions Increasing awareness of future mothers about breast feeding difficulties, its benefits to children, mothers, and society at large may further promote breastfeeding, and improve exclusivity and continuation rates in Lebanon. A national strategy for early intervention during school years to increase young women's awareness may improve their self-confidence and determination to succeed in breastfeeding later. Moreover, prolonging maternity leave, having day-care facilities at work, creation of lactation peer support groups and hotlines, and training of doctors and nurses in proper lactation support may positively impact breastfeeding exclusivity and continuation rates. Further {{research is needed to}} assess the effectiveness of proposed interventions in the Lebanese context. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Linoleic 18 : 2 (n- 6) and α-linolenic 18 : 3 (n- 3) {{essential}} fatty acids and long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA) are essential nutrients for growth and neonatal development. Consumption of preformed n- 3 LC-PUFA {{has been shown to}} increase gestational duration and to decrease the incidence of premature birth in human studies. This study evaluated the association of {{essential fatty}} acids and LC-PUFA in breast milk on the growth of premature children (weight, height and head circumference). Study design Thirty-seven premature infants with a gestational age of 37 weeks or less were followed until 6 months of gestational age, adjusted for prematurity. The milk from mothers, weight, height and head circumference measures of children were collected during the <b>follow</b> <b>up.</b> The breast <b>milk</b> fatty acids were quantified by gas-liquid chromatography. Results Our results showed that total n- 3 PUFA was positively associated with weight gain (p = 0. 05), height (p = 0. 04) and body mass index (BMI) of children (p = 0. 05). Our results also indicate that both linoleic acid and total {{essential fatty acids}} were positively associated with BMI and head circumference, whereas oleic acid was positively associated only with head circumference. Conclusion These results suggest that the n- 3 PUFA composition of milk may be associated with weight gain and growth. Considering the advantages of n- 3 LC-PUFA consumption on infant growth and visual function and its association with reduced incidence of premature birth, dietitians should advise pregnant women to increase their intake of foods high in n- 3 LC-PUFA. </p...|$|R

DESIGN [...] Blood pressure was recorded at a medical screening examination after which pressor reactions to a psychological stress task were determined. <b>Follow</b> <b>up</b> measurement of {{blood pressure was}} undertaken, on average, 4. 9 years later. SETTING [...] 20 civil service departments in London. SUBJECTS [...] 1003 male civil servants aged between 35 and 55 years at entry to the study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE [...] Blood pressure at <b>follow</b> <b>up</b> screening. RESULTS [...] Reactions of systolic blood pressure to stress correlated positively with systolic blood pressure at <b>follow</b> <b>up</b> screening (r = 0. 22, P < 0. 01). The dominant correlate of <b>follow</b> <b>up</b> blood pressure was blood pressure at initial screening (r = 0. 60; P < 0. 01 between initial and <b>follow</b> <b>up</b> systolic blood pressure; r = 0. 59, P < 0. 01 between initial and <b>follow</b> <b>up</b> diastolic blood pressure). Stepwise multiple regression analysis indicated that reactions to the stressor provided minimal prediction of <b>follow</b> <b>up</b> blood pressure over and above that afforded by blood pressure at initial screening. In the case of <b>follow</b> <b>up</b> systolic blood pressure, systolic reactions to stress accounted for only 1 % of <b>follow</b> <b>up</b> variance; systolic blood pressure at initial screening accounted for 34 %. With regard to diastolic blood pressure at <b>follow</b> <b>up,</b> the independent contribution from diastolic reactions to stress was less than 1 %.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{the relation of}} cardiac autoantibody and disease status in a consecutive series of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy by prospective antibody testing at diagnosis and at <b>follow</b> <b>up.</b> METHODS: Antibody status was assessed by indirect immunofluorescence in 110 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (85 male, mean (SD) age 44 (13) years) at diagnosis and at <b>follow</b> <b>up</b> (mean (SD) 14 (12) months); in 57 of them cardiac specific anti-alpha myosin antibody titres were also measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Patients underwent complete evaluation at diagnosis and clinical and non-invasive assessment at <b>follow</b> <b>up,</b> including exercise testing with maximal oxygen consumption measurements. RESULTS: The frequency of cardiac specific antibodies by immunofluorescence was lower at <b>follow</b> <b>up</b> than at diagnosis (28 (25 %) v 11 (10 %), P = 0. 002). Mean (SEM) anti-alpha myosin antibody titres at <b>follow</b> <b>up</b> were also lower than at diagnosis (0. 24 (0. 02) v 0. 30 (0. 02), P = 0. 038); 24 % of patients at diagnosis and 14 % at <b>follow</b> <b>up</b> had an abnormal ELISA result. None of the patients who were negative by immunofluorescence or ELISA at diagnosis became positive at <b>follow</b> <b>up.</b> Presence of antibody at diagnosis was associated with milder symptoms and greater exercise capacity at <b>follow</b> <b>up</b> and persistence of antibody at <b>follow</b> <b>up</b> was associated with stable disease and milder symptoms at diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac specific autoantibodies in dilated cardiomyopathy become undetectable with disease progression; this is a recognised feature of other autoimmune conditions, such as type 1 diabetes. Detection of these antibodies at diagnosis and at <b>follow</b> <b>up</b> may provide a non-invasive marker of early dilated cardiomyopathy...|$|R
