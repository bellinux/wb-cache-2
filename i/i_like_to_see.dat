5|$|I {{remember}} {{most of the}} video you had shot with the crane, some Steadicam, plus some panning. So you have about five different cameras shooting a performance, and after they edit like crazy. It gives {{you a lot of}} freedom, but I feel very frustrated because <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> somebody dancing. I hate when there's too much editing. I like the steadiness of the performance because then you can really enjoy the movement of the body. You see the skill.|$|E
500|$|On his {{approach}} to casting, Stallone {{said that he was}} looking for actors who had not experienced recent success in film: [...] "I like using people that had a moment and then maybe have fallen on some hard times and give them another shot. So we’re always looking for actors like Michael Biehn and Michael Paré. I like those kinds of guys. Someone did it for me and <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> if I can do it for them." ...|$|E
500|$|... "It's {{going to}} have themes and there'll {{be a lot of}} {{audience}} interaction. My live show will have a lot of that— a lot of dancing, a joie de vivre. I feel such freedom on stage. It's such a rush to be performing. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> everybody's faces on stage, to see the reaction. Normally, you can only see the front row because of the lights. So you'll see a lot of (my) energy... but there are also going to be other moments that I hope are artistically energetic. I want people to feel things up close" ...|$|E

500|$|Brazilian {{football}}ing icon Pelé tweeted, [...] "I {{always said}} that football is a box of surprises. Nobody in this world expected this result," [...] followed by, [...] " [...] Will {{try to get the}} sixth title in Russia. Congratulations to Germany." [...] Carlos Alberto Torres, the captain of Brazil's winning team in 1970, said that the country lost due to a [...] "feeling of 'we've already won'". He added that [...] "Germany played how <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> and Scolari's tactics for this match were suicidal". Argentina coach Alejandro Sabella struggled to explain Brazil's loss, saying [...] "Football is illogical". In contrast, Argentinian icon Diego Maradona was seen singing a song mocking the Brazilian defeat.|$|E
500|$|The {{most notable}} {{aspect of his}} songwriting {{involved}} {{the wide range of}} genres that he used, which included, among other styles, rockabilly, progressive rock, heavy metal, gospel and disco. As he explained in a 1986 interview, [...] "I hate doing the same thing again and again and again. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> what's happening now in music, film and theatre and incorporate all of those things." [...] Compared to many popular songwriters, Mercury also tended to write musically complex material. For example, [...] "Bohemian Rhapsody" [...] is acyclic in structure and comprises dozens of chords. He also wrote six songs from Queen II which deal with multiple key changes and complex material. [...] "Crazy Little Thing Called Love", on the other hand, contains only a few chords. Despite the fact that Mercury often wrote very intricate harmonies, he also claimed that he could barely read music. He wrote most of his songs on the piano and used a wide variety of different key signatures.|$|E
500|$|In December 2011, Disney {{announced}} that the film would be converted to 3D. Said Whedon, [...] "I'm {{not a big fan}} of extreme long lens, talky movies – <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the space I'm in and relate to it, so 3D kinda fits my aesthetic anyway. And the technology has advanced so far in the past couple years." [...] Whedon also said that [...] "there definitely are movies that shouldn't be in 3D" [...] but [...] "The Avengers isn't obnoxiously 3D. There's no, 'Oh look, we're going to spend 20 minutes going through this tunnel because it's in 3D!' And no one is pointing at the screen the entire time. But it's an action movie. Things tend to hurtle toward the screen anyway". In January 2012, it was reported that the film would be digitally remastered for IMAX 3D and open in IMAX theaters on May 4, 2012, the same day it opens in regular theaters. The film's IMAX release follows Marvel's IMAX releases of Iron Man 2 and Thor.|$|E

2500|$|On anarchism, Fish says: [...] "What sort of anarchist {{future would}} <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see?</b> There's {{no reason for}} a government-free society to be nothing but agrarian, {{no reason at all}} that it couldn't be {{industrial}} and space-faring." ...|$|E

2500|$|When Thomson was {{selected}} for the first Test of the 197475 Ashes series, the English players had seen him in action only once, during a tour match against Queensland when Thomson bowled well within himself on the instruction of his captain Greg Chappell. He created controversy during a television interview before the Test when he said, [...] "I enjoy hitting a batsman more than getting him out. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> blood on the pitch". In the second innings of the match, he bowled Australia to victory with a spell of 6/46. At Perth, he injured several batsmen and finished off the game with 5/93 in the second innings as Australia recorded another victory.|$|E
