5|$|Patients {{are given}} an {{injection}} of venom {{under the skin}} <b>in</b> <b>small</b> <b>amounts.</b> During immunotherapy, the first dose is small, but will gradually increase per injection. This sort of immunotherapy is designed to change how the immune system reacts to increased doses of venom entering the body.|$|E
5|$|White dripstones {{are pure}} calcite without defilement, the red color {{is given by}} iron oxide (rust) <b>in</b> <b>small</b> <b>amounts.</b> In Lebanon iron oxide has a red color instead of the brown beige color which is common in {{northern}} countries. The reason is a different chemical reaction caused by the high temperature which produces {{a different kind of}} iron oxide.|$|E
5|$|Bufotenin, {{one of the}} {{chemicals}} excreted by the cane toad, is classified as a class-1 drug under Australian law, alongside heroin and cannabis. The effects of bufotenin {{are thought to be}} similar to those of mild poisoning; the stimulation, which includes mild hallucinations, lasts for less than an hour. As the cane toad excretes bufotenin <b>in</b> <b>small</b> <b>amounts,</b> and other toxins in relatively large quantities, toad licking could result in serious illness or death.|$|E
50|$|Cinnamyl {{alcohol is}} {{naturally}} occurrent only <b>in</b> <b>small</b> <b>amount,</b> so its industrial demand is usually fulfilled by chemical synthesis starting from cinnamaldehyde.|$|R
50|$|High-performance {{plastics}} are plastics {{that meet}} higher requirements than standard or engineering plastics. They {{are more expensive}} and used <b>in</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>amounts.</b>|$|R
50|$|In addition, {{natural gas}} {{itself is a}} {{greenhouse}} gas far more potent than carbon dioxide when released into the atmosphere but is released <b>in</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>amounts.</b>|$|R
5|$|Divalent {{europium}} (Eu2+) <b>in</b> <b>small</b> <b>amounts</b> is the activator of {{the bright}} blue fluorescence of some samples of the mineral fluorite (CaF2). The reduction from Eu3+ to Eu2+ is induced by irradiation with energetic particles. The most outstanding examples of this originated around Weardale and adjacent parts of northern England; it was the fluorite found here that fluorescence was named after in 1852, {{although it was not}} until much later that europium was determined to be the cause.|$|E
5|$|Elemental boron is a {{metalloid}} that {{is found}} <b>in</b> <b>small</b> <b>amounts</b> in meteoroids but chemically uncombined boron is not otherwise found naturally on Earth. Industrially, very pure boron is produced with difficulty because of refractory contamination by carbon or other elements. Several allotropes of boron exist: amorphous boron is a brown powder; crystalline boron is silvery to black, extremely hard (about 9.5 on the Mohs scale), and a poor electrical conductor at room temperature. The primary use of elemental boron is as boron filaments with applications similar to carbon fibers in some high-strength materials.|$|E
5|$|Francium coprecipitates {{with several}} caesium salts, such as caesium perchlorate, which results <b>in</b> <b>small</b> <b>amounts</b> of {{francium}} perchlorate. This coprecipitation {{can be used}} to isolate francium, by adapting the radiocaesium coprecipitation method of Lawrence E. Glendenin and Nelson. It will additionally coprecipitate with many other caesium salts, including the iodate, the picrate, the tartrate (also rubidium tartrate), the chloroplatinate, and the silicotungstate. It also coprecipitates with silicotungstic acid, and with perchloric acid, without another alkali metal as a carrier, which provides other methods of separation. Nearly all francium salts are water-soluble.|$|E

25|$|In Slovenia, the {{pinot noir}} is {{produced}} {{especially in the}} Slovenian Littoral, particularly in the Goriška Brda sub-region. <b>In</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>amounts,</b> the Pinot noir is also produced in Slovenian Styria.|$|R
5000|$|Many {{elements}} are required <b>in</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>amounts</b> (microgram quantities), usually because {{they play a}} catalytic role in enzymes. Some trace mineral elements (RDA < 200 mg/day) are, in alphabetical order: ...|$|R
5|$|The {{first factor}} {{determining}} optimal defense is risk: {{how likely is}} it that a plant or certain plant parts will be attacked? This is also related to the plant apparency hypothesis, which states that a plant will invest heavily in broadly effective defenses when the plant is easily found by herbivores. Examples of apparent plants that produce generalized protections include long-living trees, shrubs, and perennial grasses. Unapparent plants, such as short-lived plants of early successional stages, on the other hand, preferentially invest <b>in</b> <b>small</b> <b>amounts</b> of qualitative toxins that are effective against {{all but the most}} specialized herbivores.|$|E
5|$|The {{international}} {{version was}} imported by Bergsala AB into Scandinavian countries <b>in</b> <b>small</b> <b>amounts</b> and was re-titled Mr. Gimmick. It {{was released on}} 19 May 1993. Unlike its Japanese counterpart, this version features nine lives instead of four to counter the game's extreme difficulty. The game also contains downgraded music {{due to the lack}} of an expanded sound channel chip. Since the European cartridge is encoded for PAL region, the game will not work properly on a North American NTSC NES due to graphical glitches, but an identical NTSC prototype ROM has been leaked online which functions properly.|$|E
5|$|Ceramic {{industry}} consumes {{a significant}} amount of zinc oxide, in particular in ceramic glaze and frit compositions. The relatively high heat capacity, thermal conductivity and high temperature stability of ZnO coupled with a comparatively low coefﬁcient of expansion are desirable properties in the production of ceramics. ZnO affects the melting point and optical properties of the glazes, enamels, and ceramic formulations. Zinc oxide as a low expansion, secondary ﬂux improves the elasticity of glazes by reducing the change in viscosity as a function of temperature and helps prevent crazing and shivering. By substituting ZnO for BaO and PbO, the heat capacity is decreased and the thermal conductivity is increased. Zinc <b>in</b> <b>small</b> <b>amounts</b> improves the development of glossy and brilliant surfaces. However, in moderate to high amounts, it produces matte and crystalline surfaces. With regard to color, zinc has a complicated inﬂuence.|$|E
5000|$|Oxidizers: lead dioxide, iron oxides, barium chromate, lead chromate, tin(IV) oxide, bismuth(III) oxide, {{barium sulfate}} (for {{high-temperature}} compositions), potassium perchlorate (usually used <b>in</b> <b>small</b> <b>amount</b> {{together with other}} oxidizers), etc.|$|R
50|$|Booyah {{is still}} made in {{northern}} and northeastern Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Michigan's Upper Peninsula at church picnics, county fairs, VFW gatherings, at booyah cooking contests, and <b>in</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>amounts</b> at private gatherings.|$|R
50|$|Since {{beer for}} {{immediate}} consumption is usually sold <b>in</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>amounts,</b> between 0.2 - 0.5 L, {{in the more}} northerly parts of Germany, the Maß has mostly fallen out of use there, except for Bavarian-themed events.|$|R
5|$|Cerium has {{no known}} {{biological}} role in humans, {{but is not}} very toxic either; it does not accumulate in the food chain to any appreciable extent. Because it often occurs together with calcium in phosphate minerals, and bones are primarily calcium phosphate, cerium can accumulate in bones <b>in</b> <b>small</b> <b>amounts</b> that are not considered dangerous. Cerium, like the other lanthanides, is known to affect human metabolism, lowering cholesterol levels, blood pressure, appetite, and risk of blood coagulation. Cerium nitrate is an effective topical antimicrobial treatment for third-degree burns, although large doses can lead to cerium poisoning and methemoglobinemia. The early lanthanides act as essential cofactors for the methanol dehydrogenase of the methanotrophic bacterium Methylacidiphilum fumariolicum SolV, for which lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium, and neodymium alone are about equally effective.|$|E
5|$|However, most of {{the rocks}} {{have one thing in}} common; the rocks are {{generally}} hard and erosion-resistant. The Rocky Mountain Trench is thought to be a partial graben, or a long narrow strip of land that has dropped in elevation over time because of parallel faults on both sides. Faults in the Kootenay River watershed trend north-northwest to south-southeast as is common in much of British Columbia. The underlying rock is generally stable and contains more outcroppings of metamorphic and igneous rock as one progresses westwards. Formations of Cambrian and Devonian rock also appear <b>in</b> <b>small</b> <b>amounts</b> in the U.S. portion of the Kootenay.|$|E
5|$|Most earwigs are nocturnal and inhabit small crevices, living <b>in</b> <b>small</b> <b>amounts</b> of debris, {{in various}} forms such as bark and fallen logs. Species {{have been found to}} be blind and living in caves, or cavernicolous; {{reported}} to be found on the island of Hawaii and in South Africa. Food typically consist of a wide array of living and dead plant and animal matter. For protection from predators, the species Doru taeniatum of earwigs can squirt foul-smelling yellow liquid in the form of jets from scent glands on the dorsal side of the third and fourth abdominal segment. It aims the discharges by revolving the abdomen, a maneuver that enables it simultaneously to use its pincers in defense.|$|E
50|$|Nicotine is {{a natural}} product of tobacco, {{occurring}} in the leaves {{in a range of}} 0.5 to 7.5% depending on variety. Nicotine also naturally occurs <b>in</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>amounts</b> <b>in</b> plants from the family Solanaceae (such as potatoes, tomatoes, and eggplant).|$|R

50|$|In Slovenia, the {{pinot noir}} is {{produced}} {{especially in the}} Slovenian Littoral, particularly in the Goriška Brda sub-region. <b>In</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>amounts,</b> the Pinot noir is also produced in Slovenian Styria.The wine is usually called Modri Pinot (Blue Pinot) or also Modri Burgundec (Blue Burgundy).|$|R
5|$|The {{reaction}} yield {{is about}} 2% of the radium weight. 227Ac can further capture neutrons resulting <b>in</b> <b>small</b> <b>amounts</b> of 228Ac. After the synthesis, actinium {{is separated from}} radium and from the products of decay and nuclear fusion, such as thorium, polonium, lead and bismuth. The extraction can be performed with thenoyltrifluoroacetone-benzene solution from an aqueous solution of the radiation products, and the selectivity to a certain element is achieved by adjusting the pH (to about 6.0 for actinium). An alternative procedure is anion exchange with an appropriate resin in nitric acid, which {{can result in a}} separation factor of 1,000,000 for radium and actinium vs. thorium in a two-stage process. Actinium can then be separated from radium, with a ratio of about 100, using a low cross-linking cation exchange resin and nitric acid as eluant.|$|E

50|$|The arsenic of {{olivenite}} {{is sometimes}} partly {{replaced by a}} <b>small</b> <b>amount</b> of phosphorus, and in the species libethenite we have the corresponding copper phosphate Cu2PO4OH. This is found as small dark green crystals resembling olivenite at Libethen in the Slovak Republic, and <b>in</b> <b>small</b> <b>amount</b> also <b>in</b> Cornwall. Other members of this isomorphous group of minerals are adamite, Zn2AsO4OH, and eveite, Mn2AsO4OH.|$|R
