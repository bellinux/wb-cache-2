The scrolling mechanism may include a vertical scroll bar or a <b>horizontal</b> <b>scroll</b> <b>bar</b> or both to move {{the contents of the}} documents up and down or left and right. There may be navigation buttons on the screen representing the navigation keys on the keyboard. The user can click these buttons to scroll the screen. There may be very different methods of scrolling such as by using the "thumb", as popularly used with a PDF document.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{analysis}} of large, complex networks {{is an important}} aspect of ongoing biological research. Yet {{there is a need for}} entirely new, scalable approaches for network visualization that can provide more insight into the structure and function of these complex networks. Results To address this need, we have developed a software tool named BioFabric, which uses a novel network visualization technique that depicts nodes as one-dimensional horizontal lines arranged in unique rows. This is in distinct contrast to the traditional approach that represents nodes as discrete symbols that behave essentially as zero-dimensional points. BioFabric then depicts each edge in the network using a vertical line assigned to its own unique column, which spans between the source and target rows, i. e. nodes. This method of displaying the network allows a full-scale view to be organized in a rational fashion; interesting network structures, such as sets of nodes with similar connectivity, can be quickly scanned and visually identified in the full network view, even in networks with well over 100, 000 edges. This approach means that the network is being represented as a fundamentally linear, sequential entity, where the <b>horizontal</b> <b>scroll</b> <b>bar</b> provides the basic navigation tool for browsing the entire network. Conclusions BioFabric provides a novel and powerful way of looking at any size of network, including very large networks, using horizontal lines to represent nodes and vertical lines to represent edges. It is freely available as an open-source Java application. </p...|$|E

40|$|List {{boxes are}} a common user {{interface}} component in graphical user interfaces. In practice, most list boxes use right-oriented <b>scroll</b> <b>bars</b> to control left-justified text items. A two way interaction hypothesis favoring {{the use of a}} <b>scroll</b> <b>bar</b> orientation consistent with list box item justification was obtained for speed of use and user preference. Item selection was faster with a <b>scroll</b> <b>bar</b> orientation consistent with list item justification. Subjects preferred leftoriented <b>scroll</b> <b>bars</b> with left-justified items and right-oriented <b>scroll</b> <b>bars</b> with right-oriented items.

40|$|Even though <b>scroll</b> <b>bars</b> {{are often}} {{observed}} in meandering rivers, {{it is still}} not evident what exactly causes their formation. According to several studies on natural rivers, <b>scroll</b> <b>bars</b> only form when there are discharge variations and therefore pulses of outer bank erosion. Otherwise a flat point bar would develop as a continuous process. However, numerous flume experiments have reported on <b>scroll</b> <b>bar</b> formation while discharge is constant. Also, there are observations in natural rivers that sedimentation on the inner bank causes outer bank erosion. The objective of this research is to determine if erosion of the outer bank or variation in sediment supply is the leading process for the development of <b>scroll</b> <b>bars.</b> In order to study the development of <b>scroll</b> <b>bars</b> while controlling the boundary conditions, an experimental meandering river was created in a 3 x 11 m flume. Eight cases were performed in developed bends, which included the addition of sediment pulses and removal of part of the outer bend. Sediment pulses were added in order to determine if variations in sediment supply from upstream causes individual <b>scroll</b> <b>bars</b> to form and whether inner bend accretion is the dominant process in bend migration. This was done in an already migrating bend and in a bend that did not migrate before the perturbation. Part of the outer bend was removed several times in order to determine if outer bend erosion is the dominant process leading to <b>scroll</b> <b>bar</b> formation and bend migration. This corresponds to discontinuous outer bank erosion in nature. Also, in one bend the outer bank was fixated, in order to see if <b>scroll</b> <b>bars</b> would still develop if there is no erosion of the outer bend. In nature this corresponds to a meander bend with a high bank strength. In all cases the accretion of the inner bend and the erosion of the outer bend were monitored and flow velocities were measured. <b>Scroll</b> <b>bars</b> were observed in all bends that migrated and were formed by multiple bedforms that were deposited by secondary currents. Channel width increased downstream of the apex of these bends, causing flow velocities to decrease. Therefore, <b>scroll</b> <b>bars</b> were formed at the downstream end of a bend. Forced sediment pulses did not cause individual <b>scroll</b> <b>bars</b> to develop and had no significant effect on flow velocities and outer bend erosion. In the bend that was fixated, eventually no sediment was deposited on the point bar anymore and therefore also no <b>scroll</b> <b>bars</b> formed. However, each removal of part of the outer bend caused flow velocities to decrease at the inner bend due to the increase in width, which caused a <b>scroll</b> <b>bar</b> to develop. Erosion of the outer bend is thus the leading process in <b>scroll</b> <b>bar</b> formation and channel width variations are essential to explain sediment deposition and meander bend migration. Further research can be done on <b>scroll</b> <b>bars</b> in relatively sharp bends where flow separation zones are present. Also, in several natural rivers relatively wide <b>scroll</b> <b>bars</b> are observed, which differ with the <b>scroll</b> <b>bars</b> in the experiment...|$|R
