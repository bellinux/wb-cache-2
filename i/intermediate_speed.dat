40|$|The {{work done}} {{at each step}} during level walking and running to lift the centre of mass of the body, Wv, and to {{increase}} its forward speed, Wf, and the total mechanical energy involved (potential + kinetic) Wext, have been measured at various 'constant' speeds (2 - 32 km/hr) with the technique described by Cavagna (1975). 2. At <b>intermediate</b> <b>speeds</b> of walking (about 4 km/hr) Wv = Wf and Wext/km is at a minimum, as is the energy cost. At lower speeds Wv greater than Wf whereas at higher speeds Wf greather than Wv: in both cases Wext/km increases. 3. The recovery of mechanical energy, through the pendular motion characteristic of walking, was measured as (/Wv/ + /Wf/ - Wext) /(/Wv/ + /Wf/) : it attains a maximum (about 65 %) at <b>intermediate</b> <b>speeds.</b> 4.

The effect of varying the gross load is shown for one configuration. The resistance characteristics of planing-tail hulls are compared with those of a conventional flying-boat hull. The forces on the forebody and afterbody of one configuration are compared with the forces on a conventional hull. Increasing the angle of afterbody keel had small effect on hump resistance and no effect on high-speed resistance but increased free-to-trim resistance at <b>intermediate</b> <b>speeds.</b> Increasing the depth of step increased hump resistance, had little effect on high-speed resistance, and increased free-to-trim resistance at <b>intermediate</b> <b>speeds.</b> Omitting the chines on the forward 25 percent of the afterbody had no appreciable effect on resistance. Omitting 70 percent of the chine length had almost no effect on maximum resistance but broadened the hump and increased spray around the afterbody. Load-resistance ratio at the hump decreased more rapidly with increasing load coefficient for the planing-tail hull than for the representative conventional hull, although the load-resistance ratio at the hump was greater for the planing-tail hull than for the conventional hull throughout the range of loads tested. At speeds higher than hump speed, load-resistance ratio for the planing-tail hull was a maximum at a particular gross load and was slightly less at heavier and lighter gross loads. The planing-tail hull was found to have lower resistance than the conventional hull at both the hump and at high <b>speeds,</b> but at <b>intermediate</b> <b>speeds</b> there was little difference.
