40|$|Supersymmetry, shape invariance, exact solubility, and the {{factorization}} method {{are often}} studied {{together in the}} literature. At the dawn <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>topics</b> confusion was present in regards to their scope of applicability and the relation among them. Considerable work have been put to study and resolve the relation among two or more <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>topics.</b> <b>These</b> works are scattered over the literature. While looking at the literature, one can not overlook the number of places where authors confuse these terms, and concluding implications depending on wrong assumptions {{of the relation between}} two or more <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>topics.</b> In this letter we define supersymmetry, and shape invariance, and show the relations which connects them to exact solubility and the factorization method, referring to the literature for the respective detailed work and proofs. At last we conclude our letter with a Venn diagram which illustrates those relations...|$|R
