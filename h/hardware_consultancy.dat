When this was successfully running, {{he set up}} BA's Emerging Technologies Group, which researched and trialled technologies from fingerprint recognition to electronic cash. This emphasis on innovation led to training with Dr. Edward de Bono, and in 1994 he left BA to set up his own creativity consultancy, running courses {{on the development of}} new ideas and products, and the creative solution of business problems. His clients include the BBC, the Met Office, British Airways, GlaxoSmithKline, Sony, Royal Bank of Scotland and many other blue-chips.|$|R
40|$|Low {{developed}} {{companies do}} not use ERP solutions for resource management, they don't have CRM systems for tracking customers, online presence is low and consequently they are selling low volumes. Their work does not generate enough capital to buy specialized software and the local community {{is too small to}} create open-source software for them. When adapting an open-source enterprise solution, from a certain level of integration, it is necessary to align to the Romanian legislation. For this you need more than a simple translation. For example, in accounting, the Romanian chart of accounts should be used, the local fiscal calendar, the rules of the Romanian legislation and the specific identifiers for Romanian companies. The solution: Open source applications can be localized. A small community cannot create complex system starting from nothing, but they can adapt existing ones already created and used all over the world. Given the individual characteristics of the Romanian market, open source ERP, CM and e-commerce will be integrated by specialized consultancy agency in Romania just as is done in France (Compiere), Spain (Openbravo), Belgium (OpenERP) or the United States (Apache oFBiz). This will not generate license costs for the companies, only the expenses for <b>hardware</b> and implementation <b>consultancy.</b> If we can create a common infrastructure, hardware cost will be waived for cloud SaaS offering, in opposition with the on-premise option...|$|R
