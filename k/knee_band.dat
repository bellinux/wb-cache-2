50|$|Tommy {{was injured}} {{very early on}} in his career and the doctors advised him to undergo surgery as quick as possible. But it took {{thirteen}} years before Tommy went to the hospital. Throughout his entire career Tommy played with a <b>knee</b> <b>band.</b> There are no pictures of him without the <b>knee</b> <b>band.</b> But despite this he scored many of his greatest goals from long range. At the age of 28, Troelsen ended his active career due to his injury problems. He played his last game for Vejle in September 1968.|$|E

They also wore several shell strand earrings, shell necklaces, long fashioned hair, and puckered seamed wrap ankle moccasins. The men carried a quill and flint arrow hunting bag, and had arm and <b>knee</b> <b>bands.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Berry creates beaded bandolier bags, moccasins, belts, <b>knee</b> <b>bands,</b> purses and sashes. She often uses beadwork {{designs that}} evolved from pre-Contact Mississippian pottery into {{traditional}} 18th and 19th century Southeastern beadwork. Berry discovered a unique stitch only used on Southeastern sashes. She {{is credited with}} reviving the art of Cherokee beadwork, which had been in serious decline for many years. Her art, expressed through utilitarian items, demonstrates themes such as duality and change throughout life. Berry's beadwork also expresses [...] "current day feelings of conflict, loss, distortion and confusion." ...|$|R

5000|$|Buckled shoes {{began to}} replace tied {{shoes in the}} mid-17th century: Samuel Pepys wrote in his Diary for 22 January 1660 [...] "This day I began to put on buckles to my shoes, which I have bought {{yesterday}} of Mr. Wotton." [...] The fashion at first remained uncommon enough though that even in 1693 a writer to a newspaper complained of the new fashion of buckles replacing ribbons for fastening shoes and <b>knee</b> <b>bands.</b> Separate buckles remained fashionable until they were abandoned along with high-heeled footwear and other aristocratic fashions {{in the years after}} the French Revolution, although they were retained as part of ceremonial and court dress until well into the 20th century. In Britain in 1791 an attempt was made by buckle manufactures to stop change in fashion by appealing to the then Prince of Wales Prince George. While the prince did start to require them for his court this didn't stop the decline of the shoe buckle. It has been suggested that the decline drove the manufactures of steel buckles to diversify into producing a range of cut steel jewellery.|$|R

50|$|Iliotibial band {{syndrome}} {{is one of}} the leading causes of lateral knee pain in runners. The iliotibial band is a thick band of fascia on the lateral aspect of the knee, extending from the outside of the pelvis, over the hip and knee, and inserting just below the <b>knee.</b> The <b>band</b> is crucial to stabilizing the knee during running, as it moves from behind the femur to the front of the femur during activity. The continual rubbing of the band over the lateral femoral epicondyle, combined with the repeated flexion and extension of the knee during running may cause the area to become inflamed.|$|R

It contained two coarse cotton shirts, two warm garments resembling waistcoats, and fastened by strings closing up to the neck, two red sashes of coarse flannel, and two loose doublets reaching down to the hips. These were worn and patched, but had been newly lined with sheepskin. The breeches, which reached down to the knee, were of coarse brown cloth; to cover the leg below the <b>knee</b> were <b>bands</b> of gray flannel which were wrapped round and round the leg and foot, while over these were worn wooden shoes. The hats were of conical shape with wide brims, and both, like the clothes, bore signs of long wear.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{values of}} the {{spectral}} indices of the cosmic ions below the <b>knee</b> energy <b>band</b> are of notable importance for a quantitative account of the characteristic of the knee and the ankle of the differential energy spectrum of the cosmic radiation. Present available measurements of proton and helium spectral indices below the knee energy interval {{from a variety of}} experiments are examined. According to some measurements the proton dominance in the / flux ratio below transforms into a helium dominance above implying a break of the and spectral indices. On the contrary these trends remain unproven or disproved in other experiments. The relevance of these measurements to the origin of the knee and ankle is briefly presented and highlighted...|$|R

50|$|The Honeycutters {{was founded}} in 2007 by Amanda Anne Platt and former guitarist Peter James based around Platt's songwriting. Originally called the Bee's <b>Knees,</b> the <b>band</b> derived its current name from a Tow truck company in Asheville, NC. They {{released}} their first studio album, Irene, in 2009, followed by When Bitter Met Sweet in 2012. In 2015, The Honeycutters signed with Organic Records and released their third full-length studio album, Me Oh My. Their album, On The Ropes, was released in 2016 and their most recent, and self-titled album was released on June 9th, 2017. The band has performed throughout the United States and Canada, including the Vancouver Folk Music Festival, Rochester International Jazz Festival, Folk Alliance International, AmericanaFest, MerleFest, and Mountain Stage. In 2016, they were featured on NPR's World Cafe: Sense of Place Asheville.|$|R
60|$|Geeka had {{undergone}} a transformation since her little mother had left the village of The Sheik. Her garmenture now reflected in miniature that of Meriem. A tiny bit of leopard skin covered her ratskin torso from shoulder to splinter <b>knee.</b> A <b>band</b> of braided grasses about her brow held in place a few gaudy feathers from the parakeet, while other bits of grass were fashioned into imitations of arm and leg ornaments of metal. Geeka was a perfect little savage; but at heart she was unchanged, being the same omnivorous listener as of yore. An excellent trait in Geeka was that she never interrupted in order to talk about herself. Today was no exception. She had been listening attentively to Meriem for an hour, propped against the bole of a tree while her lithe, young mistress stretched catlike and luxurious along a swaying branch before her.|$|R

40|$|Biological motion, or biomotion, is {{the perceptual}} {{phenomenon}} in which highlighting the major joints {{of the body}} renders recognition of the human form almost immediately. By taking advantage of biomotion, clothing materials and garments can increase visibility of bicyclists. The purpose {{of this research is}} to compare the effectiveness of biomotion visibility aids for nighttime bicyclists via 3 D eye-tracking technology. Four visibility aid conditions were tested via a between-subjects experiment: biomotion (retro-reflective <b>knee</b> and ankle <b>bands),</b> non-biomotion (retro-reflective vest), pseudo-biomotion (vertical retro-reflective stripes {{on the back of the}} legs), and control (all-black clothing). A one-way ANOVA and post-hoc analysis were conducted. Both biomotion and pseudo-biomotion conditions were found to be significantly more visible than non-biomotion and control conditions. These results have the potential to benefit clothing designers, drivers, and bicyclists alike...|$|R
40|$|Reconstruction of the {{anterior}} cruciate ligament (ACL) is the surgical treatment of choice as direct primary repair of the ligament {{has been shown to}} result in persistent laxity and instability of the knee. The aim of reconstruction is to restore stability of the knee without restricting its functions. Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction requires a graft which may be either an autograft or an allograft or a synthetic graft. Most studies agree that using the patient’s own tissue (autograft) to repair an {{anterior cruciate ligament}} tear is the way to go. Graft taken from patellar tendon gives good results but muscle weakness, pain, tendonitis and kneecap fracture {{are just a few of}} the possible post-operative problems. In this prospective study of ACL reconstruction, tendon material from iliotibial tract was used in a special way for adding stability to the <b>knee</b> called iliotibial <b>band</b> tenodesis. Herein, 17 cases of ACL repair and augmantation with iliotibial tract is being evaluated...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Published {{articles}} on iliotibial band friction syndrome have been reviewed. These articles cover the epidemiology, etiology, anatomy, pathology, prevention, {{and treatment of}} the condition. This article describes (1) the various etiological models that have been proposed to explain iliotibial band friction syndrome; (2) some of the imaging methods, research studies, and clinical experiences that support or call into question these various models; (3) commonly proposed treatment methods for iliotibial band friction syndrome; and (4) the rationale behind these methods and the clinical outcome studies that support their efficacy. Keywords Iliotibial <b>band</b> <b>Knee</b> pain Running injuries Iliotibial band friction syndrome What is iliotibial band friction syndrome? Iliotibial band friction syndrome (ITBFS) involves pain {{in the region of}} the lateral femoral condyle or slightly inferior to it, that occurs after repetitive motion of the knee, typically in a runner, cyclist, or other athlete. Most typically a diagnosis is made based on the case history and physical examination, though in some cases MRI’s might be indicated to rule out another disorder in the region. An important finding on physical examination is local tenderness of the lateral knee inferior to the epicondyle and superior to the joint line. The Ober test for distensibility o...|$|R
60|$|The {{memory of}} his {{childhood}} suddenly grew dim. He tried to call forth some of its vivid moments but could not. He recalled only names. Dante, Parnell, Clane, Clongowes. A little boy had been taught geography by an old woman who kept two brushes in her wardrobe. Then he had been sent away from home to a college, {{he had made his}} first communion and eaten slim jim out of his cricket cap and watched the firelight leaping and dancing on the wall of a little bedroom in the infirmary and dreamed of being dead, of mass being said for him by the rector in a black and gold cope, of being buried then in the little graveyard of the community off the main avenue of limes. But he had not died then. Parnell had died. There had been no mass for the dead in the chapel and no procession. He had not died but he had faded out like a film in the sun. He had been lost or had wandered out of existence for he no longer existed. How strange to think of him passing out of existence in such a way, not by death but by fading out in the sun or by being lost and forgotten somewhere in the universe! It was strange to see his small body appear again for a moment: a little boy in a grey belted suit. His hands were in his side-pockets and his trousers were tucked in at the <b>knees</b> by elastic <b>bands.</b>|$|R
