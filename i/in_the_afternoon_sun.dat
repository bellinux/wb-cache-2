5|$|Sebastian Vettel led a Ferrari 1-2 {{in third}} {{practice}} ahead of Räikkönen, setting {{a time of}} 1:31.683. The two Mercedes drivers of Rosberg and Hamilton followed, ahead of Valtteri Bottas and Romain Grosjean. On the soft compound tyres, both Mercedes drivers had set identical times, before Rosberg edged out Hamilton on the super-softs. Higher temperatures <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> <b>sun</b> meant that the times dropped from second practice. Felipe Massa ran a new, shorter nase for Williams, but managed only the ninth fastest time, {{more than half a}} second slower than teammate Bottas. Not running the super-soft tyres, Toro Rosso got its two drivers on 15th and 16th place respectively. Jolyon Palmer was 20th fastest before puncturing a tyre {{at the end of the}} session.|$|E

60|$|WE had dawdled {{over our}} luncheon before Mrs. Macallan arrived at Benjamin's cottage. The ensuing {{conversation}} {{between the old}} lady and myself (of which I have only presented a brief abstract) lasted until quite late <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon.</b> <b>The</b> <b>sun</b> was setting <b>in</b> heavy clouds when {{we got into the}} carriage, and the autumn twilight began to fall around us while we were still on the road.|$|R

60|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> shone hot <b>in</b> their faces, {{for there}} were no trees to offer them shade; so that before night Dorothy and Toto and the Lion were tired, and lay down upon the grass and fell asleep, with the Woodman and the Scarecrow keeping watch.|$|R
6000|$|But to show <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> <b>sun,</b> With {{an aspect}} of hollow-eyed care, When none wished to see me come there, Was a garish thing, better undone. [...] Yes; wrong was the way; [...] But yet, let me say, [...] I may right it--some day.|$|E
60|$|I {{remember}} the Crusaders, how they called here so often {{on their way}} to the East. And Trapani seems waiting for them still, with its palm trees and its silence, full <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> <b>sun.</b> It has not much to do but wait, apparently.|$|E
60|$|The farmer led our {{two boys}} through a deliciously scented pine-wood {{at the rear}} of his house, to a valley which seemed to extend and widen out into a {{multitude}} of lesser valleys and clumps of woodland, where lakelets and rivulets and waterfalls glittered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> <b>sun</b> like shields and bands of burnished silver.|$|E
60|$|By {{one o'clock}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> {{burst through the}} mist and an hour later the entire river was clear, {{so that they could}} see steamboats and sailboats a long {{distance}} off. The captain of the tug brought forth his spyglass and they took turns <b>in</b> looking through <b>the</b> instrument.|$|R
60|$|We {{drove off}} from the Springs Hotel about three <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon.</b> <b>The</b> <b>sun</b> warmed me to the heart. A broad, cool wind {{streamed}} pauselessly down the valley, laden with perfume. Up at the top stood Mount Saint Helena, a bulk of mountain, bare atop, with tree- fringed spurs, and radiating warmth. Once we saw it framed in a grove of tall and exquisitely graceful white oaks, in line and colour a finished composition. We passed a cow stretched by the roadside, her bell slowly beating time to the movement of her ruminating jaws, her big red face crawled over by half a dozen flies, a monument of content.|$|R

60|$|They {{found him}} {{stretched}} out on a warm ledge <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> <b>sun,</b> admiring his beautiful new coat, for {{he had been in}} retirement for the last ten days changing his skin, and now he was very splendid--darting his big blunt-nosed head along the ground, and twisting the thirty feet of his body into fantastic knots and curves, and licking his lips as he thought of his dinner to come.|$|E
60|$|The dale {{was very}} {{beautiful}} as it lay basking <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> <b>sun.</b> Near {{the house was}} a large vegetable garden, which, being now shaded by the overhanging cliffs, was being tended by a sour-visaged Sicilian. Uncle John watched him for a time, but the fellow paid no heed to him. Every servant connected with the duke's establishment seemed surly and morose, and this was the more remarkable because the country folk and villagers Uncle John had met were usually merry and light-hearted.|$|E
6000|$|... "While the tea draws and {{the cake}} cools, let's {{sit down and}} rest; I'm so tired!" [...] sighed Betty, {{dropping}} down on the door-step and stretching out the stout little legs which {{had been on the}} go all day; for Saturday had its tasks as well as its fun, and much business had preceded this unusual pleasure. Bab went and sat beside her, looking idly down the walk toward the gate, where a fine cobweb shone <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> <b>sun.</b>|$|E
50|$|In February 2007, {{nearly a}} year before she last {{appeared}} on screen, Honey was killed after a vet accidentally shot her <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wrong place with a tranquilizer dart. The dart did not go into the muscle but hit her <b>in</b> <b>the</b> stomach near her kidneys. Oblivious to his mistake, the vet went on to treat Honey's cub while she was left out <b>in</b> <b>the</b> scorching <b>afternoon</b> <b>sun.</b>|$|R
60|$|The {{situation}} grew unspeakably worse <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon.</b> <b>The</b> quiet <b>sun</b> blazed {{down through}} the clear windless air and made a furnace of our hole <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sand. And all about us were the explosions of rifles and yells of the Indians. Only {{once in a while}} did father permit a single shot from the trench, and at that only by our best marksmen, such as Laban and Timothy Grant. But a steady stream of lead poured into our position all the time. There were no more disastrous ricochets, however; and our men <b>in</b> <b>the</b> trench, no longer firing, lay low and escaped damage. Only four were wounded, and only one of them very badly.|$|R
60|$|I made my {{way over}} some rolling meadow land, where {{three or four of}} Captain Jabe's cows were {{carefully}} selecting the edible portions of the herbage, and, having passed the crest of a rounded hill, I found myself {{on the edge of a}} piece of woodland, which seemed to be of considerable extent. This suited my mood exactly, and I was soon following the curves and bends of a rude roadway, in places almost overgrown by vines and bushes, which led me deeper and deeper into the shadowed recesses of the woods. It was now about four o'clock <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon.</b> <b>The</b> <b>sun</b> was still well up, and out <b>in</b> <b>the</b> open the day was warm for an up-and-down-hill stroll; but here <b>in</b> <b>the</b> woods it was cool and quiet, and the air was full of the pleasant summer smells that come from the trees, the leaves, and the very earth of the woods.|$|R
60|$|The {{next day}} we crossed a ferry on the Ashley River, and rode down the sand of Charlestown neck. And my most vivid remembrance is of the great trunks towering half a hundred feet in the air, with a tassel of leaves at the top, which my father said were palmettos. Something lay heavy on his mind. For I had grown to know his moods by a sort of silent understanding. And when the roofs and spires of the town shone over the foliage <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> <b>sun,</b> I felt him give a great sigh {{that was like a}} sob.|$|E
6000|$|It was a {{spectacle}} that inspired Pan as never before. The wagons {{were lined up}} near the lake, their big white canvas tops shining <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> <b>sun,</b> and higher on a bench stood the [...] "hoodelum" [...] or bed wagon, so stocked with bedrolls that it resembled a haystack. Beyond {{the margin of the}} lake, four hundred fine saddle horses grazed and kicked and bit at one another. Beyond the saddle horses grazed the day herd of cattle. And over on the other side dinned the melee over the main herd, the incessant riding, yelling of the cowboys and the bawling of the cows.|$|E
6000|$|On shore too, in {{the little}} nook of shelter, {{everything}} was so subdued and still that the least particular struck in me a pleasurable surprise. The desultory crackling of the whin-pods <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> <b>sun</b> usurped the ear. The hot, sweet breath of the bank, that had been saturated all day long with sunshine, and now exhaled it into my face, was like the breath of a fellow-creature. I remember that I was haunted by two lines of French verse; in some dumb way they seemed to fit my surroundings and give expression to the contentment that was in me, and I kept repeating to myself-- ...|$|E
60|$|On the 7th we {{left the}} encampment at an early hour, and made one short portage {{a few minutes after}} starting. After breakfast, as we paddled quietly along, we descried three canoes coming towards us, filled with Indians of the Seauteaux tribe. They gave us a few fresh ducks in {{exchange}} for some pork and tobacco, with which they were much delighted. After a short conversation between them and one of our men, who understood the language, we parted, and proceeded on our way. A little rain fell during <b>the</b> day, but <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> shone out and lighted up the scenery. The forests about this part of the river wore a much more cheerful aspect than those of the lower countries, being composed chiefly of poplar, birch, oak, and willows, whose beautiful light-green foliage had a very pleasing effect upon eyes long accustomed to the dark pines along the shores of Hudson Bay.|$|R
60|$|As they {{returned}} <b>in</b> late <b>afternoon</b> <b>the</b> low <b>sun</b> was a solemnity of radial bands, like a heavenly fan of beaten gold; the limitless {{circle of the}} grain was a green sea rimmed with fog, and the willow wind-breaks were palmy isles.|$|R
6000|$|Though {{the house}} was not grand, it was made lively by the varied views out of the Majlis' windows. From the East, you looked upon the square Al-Barr, the town walls and houses beyond it, the Egyptian gate, the lofty minarets of the Harim, and the distant {{outlines}} of Jabal Ohod.[FN#17] The north commanded a prospect of Mohammed's Mosque, one of the Khamsah Masajid,[FN#18] or the five suburban Mosques[FN#19]; of part of the fort-wall; and, when the Damascus Caravan came <b>in,</b> of <b>the</b> gay scene of the [...] "Prado" [...] beneath. The Majlis was tolerably cool during {{the early part of}} <b>the</b> day: <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> shone fiercely upon it. I have described the establishment at some length as a specimen of how the middle classes are lodged at Al-Madinah. The upper ranks affect Turkish and Egyptian luxuries in their homes, as I had an opportunity of seeing at Omar Effendi's house <b>in</b> <b>the</b> [...] "Barr;" [...] and <b>in</b> these countries <b>the</b> abodes of the poor are everywhere very similar.|$|R
6000|$|They {{looked back}} {{with him at the}} city, whose {{thousands}} of tinned roofs, rising one above the other from the water's edge to the citadel, were all a splendor of argent light <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> <b>sun.</b> It was indeed as if some magic had clothed that huge rock, base and steepy flank and crest, with a silver city. They gazed upon the marvel with cries of joy that satisfied the driver's utmost pride in it, and Isabel said, [...] "To live there, there in that Silver City, in perpetual sojourn! To be always going to go on a morrow that never came! To be forever within one day of the end of a wedding journey that never ended!" ...|$|E
60|$|Towards {{the end of}} the day {{the trace}} led into a {{beautiful}} green valley, and in the middle of it was a stream shining <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> <b>sun.</b> Then Polly Ann fell entirely silent. And presently, as the shadows grew purple, we came to a cabin set under some spreading trees on a knoll where a woman sat spinning at the door, three children playing at her feet. She stared at us so earnestly that I looked at Polly Ann, and saw her redden and pale. The children were the first to come shouting at us, and then the woman dropped her wool and ran down the slope straight into Polly Ann's arms. Mr. Ripley halted the horses with a grunt.|$|E
60|$|For {{the first}} time in his life Kemp {{discovered}} that the hill-road was indescribably vast and desolate, and that the beginnings of the town far below at the hill foot were strangely remote. Never had there been a slower or more painful method of progression than running. All the gaunt villas, sleeping <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> <b>sun,</b> looked locked and barred; no doubt they were locked and barred--by his own orders. But at any rate they might have kept a lookout for an eventuality like this! The town was rising up now, the sea had dropped out of sight behind it, and people down below were stirring. A tram was just arriving at the hill foot. Beyond that was the police station. Was that footsteps he heard behind him? Spurt.|$|E
60|$|Madeline's rooms {{occupied}} {{the west end}} of the building and comprised four in number, all opening out upon the long porch. There was a small room for her maid, another which she used as an office, then her sleeping-apartment; and, lastly, the great light chamber which she had liked so well upon first sight, and which now, simply yet beautifully furnished and containing her favorite books and pictures, she had come to love as she had never loved any room at home. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> morning the fragrant, balmy air blew the white curtains of the open windows; at noon the drowsy, sultry quiet seemed to creep <b>in</b> for <b>the</b> siesta that was characteristic of <b>the</b> country; <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> <b>the</b> westering <b>sun</b> peeped under the porch roof and painted the walls with gold bars that slowly changed to red.|$|R
60|$|They {{forced a}} way through thickets, they skirted precipitous rocks, passed {{clusters}} of ragged pines, and plunged down ravines. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> was hot, {{and when it}} got low a cold wind buffeted them as they crossed the height of land. Harding's side ached, and his feet were bleeding, but the march went on. Just before dark there opened up before them a wide valley, fading into the blue distance, with water shining in its midst and gray blurs of willows here and there. However, it faded swiftly, and Harding found himself limping across a stony ridge into a belt of drifting mist. Half an hour afterward he threw himself down, exhausted, beside a fire in a sheltered hollow.|$|R
50|$|After winning two battles <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{space of}} a few hours, the {{soldiers}} must have doubted their ability to prevail in a third but once again the ingenuity of Prior Abernethy saved the day. As the finale to a stirring speech he bade the tired soldiers look towards the Pentland Hills where a band of hard-working Cistercian monks under the prior's instructions had erected a huge canvas saltire, a silver cross on a blue background shining <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late <b>afternoon</b> <b>sun</b> to inspire them to one last effort. Approaching along the valley from Borthwick Castle via Rosewell, the remaining English forces under Sir Richard Neville were defeated and the Battle of Rosslyn finally won.|$|R
60|$|The {{upshot of}} the {{petition}} was waited for in Weatherbury with solicitous interest. The execution had been fixed for eight {{o'clock on a}} Saturday morning about a fortnight after the sentence was passed, and up to Friday afternoon no answer had been received. At that time Gabriel came from Casterbridge Gaol, whither {{he had been to}} wish Boldwood good-bye, and turned down a by-street to avoid the town. When past the last house he heard a hammering, and lifting his bowed head he looked back for a moment. Over the chimneys he could see {{the upper part of the}} gaol entrance, rich and glowing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> <b>sun,</b> and some moving figures were there. They were carpenters lifting a post into a vertical position within the parapet. He withdrew his eyes quickly, and hastened on.|$|E
6000|$|After {{leaving the}} Hall with its blinded and {{shuttered}} windows, his quickest {{road to the}} Abbey House ran through the churchyard. Here {{the first thing that}} confronted him was a gigantic monument, of which the new marble glittered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> <b>sun.</b> It was a confused affair, and all he made out of it, without close examination, was a life-sized angel with an early-Victorian countenance, leaning against the broken stump of an oak tree and scattering from a basket, of the kind that is used to collect nuts or windfall apples, on to a sarcophagus beneath a profusion of marble roses, some of which seemed to have been arrested and frozen in mid-air. He glanced at the inscription in gold letters. It was [...] "To the beloved memory of Lady Jane Blake, wife of Sir John Blake, Bart., J.P., and daughter of the Right Hon. The Earl of Lynfield, whose bereaved husband erected this monument--'Her husband ... praiseth her.'" ...|$|E
60|$|The little railway {{carriage}} {{in which we}} sat rocked with speed as we flew through the French landscape. I caught glimpses of solid, Norman farm buildings, of towers and keeps and delicate steeples, and quaint towns; of bare poplars swaying before the March gusts, of green fields ablaze <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> <b>sun.</b> I took it all in distractedly. Here was Maude beside me, but a Maude I had difficulty in recognizing, whom I did not understand: who talked of a life she had built up for herself and that seemed to satisfy her; one with which I had nothing to do. I could not tell how she regarded my re-intrusion. As she continued to talk, a feeling that was almost desperation grew upon me. I had things to say to her, things that every moment {{of this sort of}} intercourse was making more difficult. And I felt, if I did not say them now, that perhaps I never should: that now or never was the appropriate time, and to delay would be to drift into an impossible situation wherein the chance of an understanding would be remote.|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, Queen Elizabeth National Park {{is home to}} {{the tree}} {{climbing}} lions. Lions do not normally climb trees, except when chased by another lion group or wild buffalo. However the tree climbing lions found in QE-NP intentionally climb trees and rest on them <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon,</b> when <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> is high. This is a truly unique phenomenon. There have only been rare similar sightings of this in Lake Manyara National Park of Tanzania.|$|R
60|$|They {{forced a}} way through thickets, they skirted precipitous rocks, passed {{clusters}} of ragged pines, and plunged down ravines. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> was hot, {{and when it}} got low a cold wind buffeted them as they crossed the height of land, but although Harding's side ached {{as well as his}} bleeding feet the march went on. Then just before dark he had a glimpse of a wide valley fading into the blue distance with water shining in its midst and grey blurs of willows here and there. The prospect, however, faded swiftly from his sight, and he found himself limping across a stony ridge into a belt of drifting mist. Half an hour afterwards he threw himself down exhausted beside a fire in a sheltered hollow.|$|R
60|$|Of course, in sailing from Geneva to {{the other}} end of the lake, we go from the west towards the east; and this renders it rather more {{agreeable}} to make the excursion by an afternoon boat than by a morning one; for <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon,</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun,</b> being then <b>in</b> <b>the</b> western part of the sky, will be behind you, and so will not shine in your face; but, instead of shining in your face and dazzling your eyes, it will be shining upon and illuminating brilliantly the slopes of the mountains that you are going to see. In other words, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning <b>the</b> mountains are <b>in</b> shadow and <b>the</b> sun <b>in</b> your eyes; <b>in</b> <b>the</b> evening your eyes are shaded, and the mountains glow with brilliancy and beauty.|$|R
