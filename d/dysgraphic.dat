40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the hypothesis that}} following activation, the components for producing a skilled behavior undergo {{a brief period of}} self- inhibition during which they are difficult to reac tivate. Evidence for this self-inhibition hypothesis is reviewed {{from a wide range of}} areas: electrophysiology, electromyography, misspellings by <b>dysgraphics,</b> the perception and recall of briefly viewed misspellings by normal subjects, the nature of omission errors in speech production and transcription typing, and between-language regularities in the pattern of phoneme repetition within words. The paper begins with a theoretical rationale for the concept of self-inhibition, based on a recently proposed theory of the relationship between the perception and production of speech (MacKay 1982, in press). I next outline the evidence for self-inhibition and finally examine some disruptive effects of feedback that can be explained as a side- effect of self-inhibition. I focus in particular on the role of self- inhibition in the disruption of ongoing speech production that results when auditory feedback is amplified and delayed about 200 ms.

40|$|The wide {{variation}} in prevalence of <b>dysgraphic</b> handwriting (5 – 33 %) is of clinical importance, because poor handwriting {{has been identified}} {{as one of the most}} common reasons for referring school-age children to occupational therapy or physiotherapy, and is included as an criterion for the diagnosis of Developmental Coordination Disorder. This study aimed to map the development and improvement in handwriting during the early grades to differentiate between temporary and consistent <b>dysgraphic</b> handwriting. In this longitudinal and cross-sectional study, children in grade 2 (age 7 – 8 years, n = 169) and grade 3 (8 – 9 years, n = 70) took handwriting (Concise Assessment Method for Children's Handwriting; acronym BHK) and visuomotor integration (BeeryVMI) screening tests twice within one school year.

40|$|An {{acquired}} <b>dysgraphic</b> patient-BA-is described who {{produces a}} large proportion of nonword responses. It is shown that single letter substitutions tend to preserve consonant-vowel status and that the majority of errors are orthographically legal. It is shown that these constraints do not arise from an application of phoneme-to-grapheme conversion procedures, since these skills are severely impaired in BA. They also do not arise from frequency-sensitive bigram/trigram units since her responses do not contain bigrams/trigrams that are higher in frequency than the target. It is suggested that BA's results support the notion of consonant-vowel encoding and syllable-like units in orthography. They do not, however, support the notion that orthographic syllables can be ranked according to complexity since no effects of syllabic complexity were found. This latter finding is consistent with previous results reported in English-speaking <b>dysgraphic</b> patients...|$|E
40|$|This paper reports an {{investigation}} of the impaired writing of an acquired <b>dysgraphic</b> patient J. E. C. who made several case, substitution, omission, and addition errors when writing lower-case letters cursively, but whose upper-case writing was intact. The main finding was that damage to the lower-case letter production system results in errors that can be predicted from the spatial similarity of the lower-case form of the error to the lower-case form of the target. This was found with both within-case and cross-case letter substitutions. An additional observation was consistent cross-case errors occurred only with targets forming a single cluster of spatially similar lower-case letters (b, d, p, and q). It is concluded access to lower-case letters is constrained by spatial similarity of a target to other letters in allograph store, and this effect may explain letter errors made by <b>dysgraphic</b> patients. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBased on {{comprehensive}} {{testing and}} educational history, children in grades 4 – 9 (on average 12  years) {{were diagnosed with}} dysgraphia (persisting handwriting impairment) or dyslexia (persisting word spelling/reading impairment) or as typical writers and readers (controls). The dysgraphia group (n = 14) and dyslexia group (n = 17) were each compared to the control group (n = 9) and {{to each other in}} separate analyses. Four brain region seed points (left occipital temporal gyrus, supramarginal gyrus, precuneus, and inferior frontal gyrus) were used in these analyses which were shown in a metaanalysis to be related to written word production on four indicators of white matter integrity and fMRI functional connectivity for four tasks (self-guided mind wandering during resting state, writing letter that follows a visually displayed letter in alphabet, writing missing letter to create a correctly spelled real word, and planning for composing after scanning on topic specified by researcher). For those DTI indicators on which the <b>dysgraphic</b> group or dyslexic group differed from the control group (fractional anisotropy, relative anisotropy, axial diffusivity but not radial diffusivity), correlations were computed between the DTI parameter and fMRI functional connectivity for the two writing tasks (alphabet and spelling) by seed points. Analyses, controlled for multiple comparisons, showed that (a) the control group exhibited more white matter integrity than either the <b>dysgraphic</b> or dyslexic group; (b) the <b>dysgraphic</b> and dyslexic groups showed more functional connectivity than the control group but differed in patterns of functional connectivity for task and seed point; and (c) the <b>dysgraphic</b> and dyslexic groups showed different patterns of significant DTI–fMRI connectivity correlations for specific seed points and written language tasks. Thus, dysgraphia and dyslexia differ in white matter integrity, fMRI functional connectivity, and white matter–gray matter correlations. Of clinical relevance, brain differences were observed in dysgraphia and dyslexia on written language tasks yoked to their defining behavioral impairments in handwriting and/or in word spelling and on the cognitive mind wandering rest condition and composition planning...|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} argued that orthographic representations—the {{abstract}} mental representations of the spellings of words—include orthography-specific information regarding the consonant/vowel (CV) identity of the individual letters that make up a word’s spelling. This hypothesis has been used to explain the finding that the substitution errors in the spelling of certain <b>dysgraphic</b> individ-uals exhibit a striking tendency to preserve the CV identity of the target letters. In this paper, we evaluate the adequacy of two alternative hypotheses that do not posit orthography-specific CV representations. One hypothesis proposes that constraints on the nature of letter substitution come from the phonological representation of a word, and a second hypothesis contends that CV-preserving substitutions are driven by orthotactic knowledge—knowledge of the well-formed letter sequences in the orthography of a language. We present novel tests of these hypotheses using data from four case studies of <b>dysgraphic</b> individuals. The results clearly adjudicate in favour of the claim that orthographic representations contain orthography-specific CV information. In this way, the results support the more general claim that abstract categories are represented within the language system...|$|E

40|$|International audienceAlthough {{almost all}} motor {{activities}} are silent, the modality of sound {{can be used}} to inform about the correctness of the ongoing movement, without interfering with the visual and proprioceptive feedback. Furthermore, the dynamic features of sounds make them particularly relevant for informing about the spatiotemporal characteristics of movements. Finally, because of their (potentially) playful character, sounds are potentially efficient for motivating patients, children for instance, in particular need of such assistance. From these theoretical considerations, we proposed to sonify handwriting movements in order to facilitate the rehabilitation of dysgraphia. Dysgraphia refers to mechanical difficulties in handwriting production related to a lack of motor control in children having neither neurological nor other motor deficits. Nowadays, handwriting movements can be recorded with graphic tablets at high temporal and spatial resolution. Two challenges appeared: first, finding the relevant variables associated with the different sounds; second, finding the appropriate auditory dimension(s) on which to map the handwriting movements. We hypothesized that sound is well suited to inform about hidden variables of handwriting movement (which cannot be supplied by vision) and we decided to sonify two kinematic variables: the instantaneous tangential velocity and the unexpected velocity peaks. Unexpected velocity peaks {{have been shown to be}} directly related to non-fluent handwriting movements. Finally, the pressure applied by the pen on the graphic tablet was associated with the global volume of the sound. We are currently testing these movement/sound associations in seven <b>dysgraphic</b> children in a longitudinal protocol of handwriting rehabilitation. The experiment is divided into six 20 -minutes weekly sessions. Each session is organized in identical manner, including a pre-test without sound, a practice with auditory feedback and a post-test without sound. In the pre- and post-tests, tasks are strictly identical and thus {{can be used to}} follow the rehabilitation evolution, within and between sessions. Preliminary data from the three first sessions revealed a positive effect of the sonification procedure: <b>Dysgraphic</b> children appeared to be able to write faster and with more fluent movements. These first promising results will be soon completed with an additional control group in which other <b>dysgraphic</b> children will run the same protocol without auditory feedback, in order to confirm the positive effect of adding sounds. We propose that sounds may be used as a palliative way to inform about kinematics of handwriting movements and, maybe, to assist movement rehabilitation in general...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} {{the case of}} a <b>dysgraphic</b> aphasic individual-S. G. W. -who, in writing to dictation, produced high rates of formally related errors consisting of both lexical substitutions and what we call morphological-compound errors involving legal or illegal combinations of morphemes. These errors were produced {{in the context of a}} minimal number of semantic errors. We could exclude problems with phonological discrimination and phonological short-term memory. We also excluded rapid decay of lexical information and/or weak activation of word forms and letter representations since S. G. W. 's spelling showed no effect of delay and no consistent length effects, but, instead, paradoxical complexity effects with segmental, lexical, and morphological errors that were more complex than the target. The case of S. G. W. strongly resembles that of another <b>dysgraphic</b> individual reported in the literature-D. W. -suggesting that this pattern of errors can be replicated across patients. In particular, both patients show unusual errors resulting in the production of neologistic compounds (e. g., "bed button" in response to "bed"). These patterns can be explained if we accept two claims: (a) Brain damage can produce both a reduction and an increase in lexical activation; and (b) there are direct connections between phonological and orthographic lexical representations (a third spelling route). We suggest that both patients are suffering from a difficulty of lexical selection resulting from excessive activation of formally related lexical representations. This hypothesis is strongly supported by S. G. W. 's worse performance in spelling to dictation than in written naming, which shows that a phonological input, activating a cohort of formally related lexical representations, increases selection difficulties. © 2014 Taylor & Francis...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{quality of}} {{handwriting}} is evaluated from the visual inspection of its legibility {{and not from}} the movement that generates the trace. Although handwriting is achieved in silence, adding sounds to handwriting movement might help towards its perception, provided that these sounds are meaningful. This study evaluated the ability to judge handwriting quality from the auditory perception of the underlying sonified movement, without seeing the written trace. In a first experiment, samples of a word written by children with dysgraphia, proficient children writers, and proficient adult writers were collected with a graphic tablet. Then, the pen velocity, the fluency, and the axial pen pressure were sonified {{in order to create}} 45 audio files. In a second experiment, these files were presented to 48 adult listeners who had to mark the underlying unseen handwriting. In order to evaluate the relevance of the sonification strategy, two experimental conditions were compared. In a first ‘implicit’ condition, the listeners made their judgment without any knowledge of the mapping between the sounds and the handwriting variables. In a second ‘explicit’ condition, they knew what the sonified variables corresponded to and the evaluation criteria. Results showed that, under the implicit condition, two thirds of the listeners marked the three groups of writers differently. In the explicit condition, all listeners marked the <b>dysgraphic</b> handwriting lower than that of the two other groups. In a third experiment, the scores given from the auditory evaluation were compared to the scores given by 16 other adults from the visual evaluation of the trace. Results revealed that auditory evaluation was more relevant than the visual evaluation for evaluating a <b>dysgraphic</b> handwriting. Handwriting sonification might therefore be a relevant tool allowing a therapist to complete the visual assessment of the written trace byan auditory control of the handwriting movement quality...|$|E

40|$|Most {{theories}} of spelling propose two major processes for translating between orthography and phonol-ogy: a lexical process for retrieving the spellings of familiar words and a sublexical process for assembling the spellings of unfamiliar letter strings based on {{knowledge of the}} systematic correspondences between phonemes and graphemes.

40|$|The present thesis {{investigates the}} graphemic {{stage of the}} {{spelling}} process. Aim of thesis is to study the sub-processes occurring at the orthographic working memory level and the interaction between graphemic representations and working memory that holds these representations active during spelling. Chapter 1, after {{a brief description of}} the two-routes spelling model adopted in this research, deals with, presenting neuropsychological evidences, some of the most important issues about the relations between the different levels of elaboration that are engaged in the spelling process. Final part of this chapter is dedicated to the review of the neuropsychological researches regarding the structural organization and the processing of the orthographic representation. Chapter 2 reports the cases of GSI and CRI, two <b>dysgraphic</b> subjects with a selective deficit for consonants and a graphemic buffer disorder (GBD), whose spelling patterns are consistent with the hypothesis that their deficits affect different properties of orthographic working memory: temporal stability for GSI and representational distinctiveness for CRI. Their performance on spelling task demonstrate two things: first, GBD is not a homogeneous deficit because different sub-processes, involved in graphemic buffering, can be selectively affected by cerebral damage; second, different patterns of GSI and CRI arise from interaction of consonant representation and WM properties, both impaired in these subjects. Chapter 3 reports the case of a third <b>dysgraphic</b> subject, PPO, with a selective disorder for consonants but whose spelling picture was not identifiable as a clear GBD. Spelling pattern of this subject, quite different from those of both subjects of Chapter 2, demonstrates that the internal structure of orthographic representation, holding at working memory level, can be selectively impaired in the absence of working memory deficit. Moreover, PPO’s results on spelling task confirm the role of temporal stability and representational distinctiveness in the spelling and the interaction between representations and WM. Finally, Chapter 4 summarizes all the presented results and discusses the implications. ...|$|E

For LK, who was biliterate, we investigated whether after the intervention targeting sublexical processes, he would produce more phonologically appropriate errors in spelling Greek than English, since this is the pattern that has been reported for children learning to read and spell in two alphabetic writing systems where one is more transparent than the other (c.f.

40|$|Background: Remediation {{techniques}} for dysgraphia {{have focused on}} targeting different components of the theoretical models for spelling.

Methods and Procedures: Retraining was explored using a visual-kinaesthetic learning technique, contrasting performance with high- and low-imagery words. Outcomes and Results: Positive effects of learning were demonstrated. There was effective initial learning of blocks of both high-imagery and low-imagery target words, but high-imagery words had a clear advantage in terms of longer-term maintenance.

Among his written errors were phonologically {{plausible}} errors that were mostly homophonous or differed only in tone from their target. They occurred not only in writing-to-dictation but also in written naming. Since his lexico-semantic system is hypothesized to be largely preserved, as evidenced by normal performance on non-verbal semantic tests and word-picture matching, the presence of homophone and tonal errors strengthened previous claims about the existence of a lexically-mediated non-semantic pathway of writing Chinese and access from the phonological output lexicon to the orthographic output lexicon. In addition, his non-character responses, particularly those involving substitution of constituent(s), almost always maintained the configuration of their target.

40|$|We have {{developed}} a pen and writing tablet for use by subjects during fMRI scanning. The pen consists of two jacketed, multi-mode optical fibers routed {{to the tip of}} a hollowed-out ball-point pen.

The tablet is simply a non-metallic frame holding a paper print of continuously varying color gradients.

Within the box, light from a high intensity LED is coupled into one of the fibers, while the other fiber abuts a color sensor. Light from the LED exits the pen tip, illuminating a small spot on the tablet, and the resulting reflected light is routed to the color sensor. Given a lookup table of position for each color on the tablet, the coordinates of the pen on the tablet may be displayed and digitized in real-time.

Many of these errors bear a general physical similarity to the intended target.

A comparison of these subjects ' letter substitution errors with those of 2 other individuals with brain damage, whose damage was at a different level of processing, revealed that the latter subjects ' errors are not explicable in terms of stroke-feature similarity. Strong support was found for the computation of multiple representational types in the course of written spelling. This system includes a relatively abstract, effector-independent representational level that specifies the features of the component strokes of letters. Any theory of written spelling must address the following question: How does one go from the knowledge that the name of the country whose capital is London consists of the grapheme set E-N-G-L-A-N-D to the actual writing o...|$|E
40|$|A {{longitudinal}} {{design was}} applied to differentiate between normal variations of psychomotor development and lasting handwriting deficiency (dysgraphia). Sixteen primary school children were tested with writing tasks that were recorded on a com-puter-monitored XY tablet. These tasks represented different modules of the handwrit-ing model of Van Galen (1991). Dependent variables were spatial errors, movement time, movement dysfluencies, trajectory length, stroke curvature, {{and the degree of}} neuromotor noise in the movement velocity profiles. The latter variable was measured by means of Power Spectral Density Analysis of the movement velocity signal, which revealed that movements of poor writers were substantially more noisy than those of proficient writers, with a noise peak in the region of neuromotor tremor. At the same time, the poor writers were less accurate. It was concluded that control of spatial accuracy rather than allograph retrieval or size control is the discriminating feature in <b>dysgraphic</b> children. Moreover, poor writers do not catch up with their peers within the 1 year time span tested. q 1997 Academic Press Handwriting and drawing are complex motor behaviors in which linguistic, psychomotor, and biomechanical processes closely interact with maturational...|$|E
