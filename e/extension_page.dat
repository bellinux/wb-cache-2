50|$|GMail Drive {{was a free}} {{third-party}} Windows Shell namespace extension ("add-on") for Google's Gmail. GMail Drive was {{not supported}} by Google. It allowed a user to access a virtual drive stored in a Gmail account by causing {{the contents of the}} Gmail account to appear as a new network share on the user's workstation. In order to use this add-on, the user needed a Gmail e-mail account. The add-on enabled the user to use the standard Windows desktop file copy and paste commands to transfer files to and from the Gmail account {{as if it were a}} drive on the user's computer. Gmail Drive was based upon GmailFS, a file system developed by Richard Jones. GMail Drive was published in 2004 and functional as early as 2005 which predates Google's later implementation of Google Drive released on April 24, 2012. As of 2015, the official <b>extension</b> <b>page</b> declares the project dead.|$|E
40|$|Sandboxing is a {{mechanism}} to monitor and control the execution of malicious or untrusted program. Memory overhead incurred by sandbox solutions is one of bottleneck for sandboxing most of applications in a system. Memory reclamation techniques proposed for traditional full virtualization do not suit sandbox environment {{due to lack of}} full scale guest operating system in sandbox. In this paper, we propose memory reclamation technique for sandboxed applications. The proposed technique indigenously works in virtual machine monitor layer without installing any driver in VMX non root mode and without new communication channel with host kernel. Proposed Page reclamation algorithm is a simple modified form of Least recently used page reclamation and Working set page reclamation algorithms. For efficiently collecting working set of application, we use a hardware virtualization <b>extension,</b> <b>page</b> Modification logging introduced by Intel. We implemented proposed technique with one of open source sandboxes to show effectiveness of proposed memory reclamation method.

An organization with professionals embedded in Nebraska communities that serve {{to engage the}} citizenry with their land-grant institution and help them solve complex problems around the important priorities of Food, Fuel, Water, Landscapes, and People. Our vision requires innovation and attaining excellence in every area and {{at every level of}} the organization— personnel recruitment and development, curriculum development, program partnerships, external funding, student recruitment, teaching strategies and delivery systems. Extension professionals are highly regarded teachers, recognized for their subject matter competence and teaching excellence. Extension will rapidly migrate to a more robust online teaching environment as we prepare to embrace the educational needs of tomorrows’ clientele. Advances in technology and teaching, coupled with strong relationships with people and research-based information will set Extension apart as a trusted leader. We will be the first resource that Nebraskan’s turn to help solve their individual, family, business, community and regional challenges. 1. Vision and Overview pages 5 - 8 2.
