It comprises on-chip shared memory (organized in many banks), simple cache-less RISC cores and a simple on-chip hardware scheduler, using a single slow clock. Thanks to sharing the cache, coherency issues are eliminated. Memory addresses are interleaved over the many banks, minimizing conflicts but requiring each core to access many banks, far and near.

As contemporary neuro-developmental research recognises the harm of being exposed to early relational trauma, key international diagnostic texts such as the DSM- 5 and ICD- 10 struggle to acknowledge or appreciate the relational complexities <b>inherent</b> in <b>addressing</b> family violence and its impacts during childhood. These key texts directly influence thinking, funding and research imperatives in adult services as well as CAMHS, however, they rarely reference family violence. Their emphasis is to pathologise conditions over exploring causality which may be attributable to relational violence. Consequently, CAMHS can miss important indicators of family violence, misdiagnose disorders and unwittingly, not address unacceptable risks in the child’s caregiving environment. Notwithstanding urgent safety concerns, ongoing exposure to family violence significantly heightens the development of mental illness amongst children. CAMHS providers cannot and should not rely on current diagnostic manuals alone. They need to act now to see family violence as a significant and important risk factor to mental health and to treat its impacts on children before these develop into enduring neurological difficulties...|$|R

Threats to data integrity are thus of paramount relevance, as tampering with data may maliciously affect crucial business decisions. This issue is especially true in cloud computing environments, where data owners cannot control fundamental data aspects, like the physical storage of data and the control of its accesses. Blockchain has recently emerged as a fascinating technology which, among others, provides compelling properties about data integrity. Using the blockchain to face data integrity threats seems to be a natural choice, but its current limitations of low throughput, high latency, and weak stability hinder the practical feasibility of any blockchain-based solutions. In this paper, by focusing on a case study from the European SUNFISH project, which concerns the design of a secure by-design cloud federation platform for the public sector, we precisely delineate the actual data integrity needs of cloud computing environments and the research questions to be tackled to adopt blockchain-based databases.

In this perspective {{it is essential to}} understand the impact of interfaces and electric fields, <b>inherent</b> to <b>address</b> coherent electronic manipulation, on the dopants atomic scale properties. This requires both fine energetic and spatial resolution of the energy spectrum and wave-function, respectively.

The spatial degrees of freedom of the STM tip provide a versatility allowing a unique understanding of electrostatics. We obtain the absolute energy scale from the thermal broadening of the resonant peaks, allowing to deduce the charging energies of the donors. Finally we use a rate equations model to derive the current in presence of an excited state, highlighting the benefits of the highly tunable vacuum tunnel rates which should be exploited in further experiments.

30|$|Another approach, {{proposed}} {{as a substitute}} for FlowVisor, is OpenVirteX [12]. Instead of dividing the flowspace in slices, like FlowVisor, OpenVirteX provides each virtual network with its own flowspace, making use of internal address translation mechanisms. It is important to understand the differences between both tools. By using internal address translation mechanisms, OpenVirteX eliminates the need of dividing the addressing space (flowspace) among the virtual networks, however also imposes limitations on the addressing space itself. Due to its design, OpenVirteX does not allow flow actions that change the MAC addresses of a packet, nor allow flow rules to be created with wildcarded MAC address fields. In addition, the number of IP addresses available to be used for a network is also reduced. Such limitations are not present in FlowVisor, and {{it is easy to see}} how each tool could be more suitable for specific environments, as the authors themselves suggest [13]. In the case of the FITS testbed, it is important for the virtual networks to be able to manipulate the MAC and IP address fields of their packets freely, thus the choice to use FlowVisor. It is also important to note that, since the vulnerabilities discussed in this paper are <b>inherent</b> to <b>address</b> space sharing, they do not apply to OpenVirteX.|$|R

Most individuals with moderate-to-severe dementia (table 1) are unfit to drive. 1 Drivers with moderate-to-severe dementia have higher rates of MVCs than age-matched controls. 2 Identifying and preventing these individuals from driving is crucial, particularly in urban areas. The density of cars and pedestrians, and the complexity of traffic typically place greater demands on drivers in urban areas, and, therefore, require greater reactivity and forward planning than in rural environments. 3, 4 The ability to drive is a critical means of maintaining one 2 ̆ 7 s social inclusion, and is commonly a practical necessity. Therefore, decisions about the entitlement to drive should not unfairly restrict mobility or unnecessarily compound the disadvantages experienced by older people with mild cognitive impairment and early dementia (table 1), particularly as diagnoses are now being made earlier. 1 This paper describes the difficulties <b>inherent</b> in <b>addressing</b> the question of when and in what circumstances a diagnosis of dementia might render a person unfit to drive and focuses on those who live in rural areas.
