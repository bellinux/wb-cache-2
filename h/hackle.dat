5|$|The adult's plumage is white, {{with black}} flight {{feathers}} in the wings. Wild birds usually appear soiled with a rusty or brown shade {{to the white}} plumage, derived from mud or iron-rich soil. Captive specimens without access to soil have clean white plumage. It has been suggested as a case of cosmetic colouration. The bill is slender and long, and {{the tip of the}} upper mandible is hooked. The nostril is an elongated horizontal slit. The neck feathers are long and form a <b>hackle.</b> The wings are pointed, with the third primary being the longest; the tail is wedge shaped. The legs are pink in adults and grey in juveniles. The claws are long and straight, and the third and fourth toes are slightly webbed at the base.|$|E
25|$|Various tools enable and {{optimize}} fly tying. Skip Morris, {{a professional}} fly tyer, lists the essential tools {{as being a}} vise to hold the hook of the fly to be tied, bobbins, a magnifying glass for delicate work, <b>hackle</b> pliers, <b>hackle</b> gauges, lights, hair stackers, and scissors. Other optional tools are pliers, toothpicks, bodkins, dubbing twisters, blenders, floss bobbins, whip finishers, wing burners and bobbin threaders.|$|E
50|$|The term {{can also}} apply to the erectile hairs {{along the back of}} the neck of an animal, {{especially}} of a dog. <b>Hackles</b> are usually used as visual warnings to other animals or threats. The animals will raise their <b>hackles</b> up to threaten another animal. Dogs may raise their <b>hackles</b> as a sign of aggressive behavior to show their dominance over conspecifics. Raised <b>hackles</b> is a behavior that can also be observed in dominant wolves who show aggression towards subordinate wolves.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} Lefty's Deceiver {{was tied}} with white saddle <b>hackles</b> tied in at the bend of a standard, short shank saltwater hook. Four to six <b>hackles</b> were used with tips curved to the outside. Flash was added {{on top of the}} <b>hackles.</b> The original body was silver tinsel. A collar of white buck tail was layered at the top, sides and bottom of the front of the hook. The buck tail extended just beyond the hook bend.|$|R

25|$|Fly tying {{material}} {{can be anything}} used to construct a fly on a hook. Traditional materials were threads, yarns, furs, feathers, hair, tinsels, cork, balsa and wire. Today's materials include not only all sorts of natural and dyed furs, hair and feathers, but also {{a wide array of}} synthetic materials. Rabbit, mink, muskrat, fox, bear, squirrel and other furs, deer, elk, moose hair and chicken, pheasant, turkey, duck, goose and partridge feathers are commonly incorporated into artificial flies. Chicken neck and saddle <b>hackle,</b> so essential for many artificial fly patterns, are from animals especially bred to produce hackles of superior performance and color. Synthetics have allowed fly tyers to replicate rare and sometimes endangered furs and feathers as well as create completely new types of flies. Synthetics such as rubber legs, plastic wings and transparent plastic cords, chenilles, and all sorts and colors of flashy materials that can be incorporated into the wings and bodies of today's artificial fly are available to the 21st-century fly tyer. Whereas lead wire was the traditional method of weighting flies, today's weighting materials include glass, brass and tungsten beads and cones as well as lead. Silicone, epoxy, kevlar thread and other modern materials are regularly incorporated in artificial fly patterns.|$|E
500|$|Initially the Commandos were {{indistinguishable from}} the rest of the British Army and volunteers {{retained}} their own regimental head-dress and insignia. No. 2 Commando adopted Scottish head-dress for all ranks and No. 11 (Scottish) Commando wore the Tam O'Shanter with a black <b>hackle.</b> The official head-dress of the Middle East Commandos was a [...] bush hat with their own knuckleduster cap badge. This badge was modelled on their issue fighting knife (the Mark I trench knife) which had a knuckleduster for a handle. In 1942 the green Commando beret and the Combined Operations tactical recognition flash were adopted.|$|E

2500|$|The Companies {{maintain}} their separate affiliations to The Royal Scots Borderers (A Company) and The Royal Highland Fusiliers (HQ, B and C Company), [...] which now form the regular 1st and 2nd Battalions of The Royal Regiment of Scotland {{and cover the}} same recruiting areas. In recognition of this, its members formerly wore a black or white <b>hackle</b> on their Tam o' Shanters, {{the same as those}} worn by the 1st and 2nd Battalions respectively. In August 2010, the Battalion adopted a new grey <b>hackle</b> to distinguish it within the Royal Regiment of Scotland. In the past, Headquarter Company of the 1st Battalion, 52nd Lowland Volunteers maintained the direct lineage of the Glasgow Highlanders but rebadged as Royal Highland Fusiliers in 1973. D Company of the Lowland Volunteers also maintained the name and lineage of the Cameronians, however it changed its affiliation to the King's Own Scottish Borderers in 1997. 52nd Lowland, though, has its own identity in the British Army's order of battle and its members are recognised primarily as 52nd Lowlanders.|$|E

50|$|Heckling was {{originally}} done by hand, but {{began in the}} nineteenth century to be undertaken mechanically, with rollers drawing the slivers of flax through the <b>hackles.</b> The machine used for this is called a gill. At first this was similar in form to traditional <b>hackles,</b> but later the screw-gill was invented. Key innovators in developing this technology were Philippe de Girard, Samuel Lawson (inventor of the screw-gill), and Peter Fairbairn.|$|R
2500|$|Each {{battalion}} had {{a number}} of pipers who also participated in a centralised pipe band formally called the Pipes & Drums of the Ulster Defence Regiment.

Unlike other Irish regiments in the British Army, UDR pipers did not wear a <b>hackle</b> and the lining colour of the cloaks was unique to the regiment.|$|E
2500|$|On the {{independence}} of Pakistan in 1947, the 1st Punjab Regiment was allotted to Pakistan Army. At the time, the active battalions were 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 5th and 7th. Sikhs and Rajputs were transferred to the Indian Army and the regiment's new class composition was fixed as Punjabis and Pathans. In November, Field Marshal Sir Claude Auchinleck, Supreme Commander of the Indian and Pakistan Armies was appointed Colonel of the 1st Punjab Regiment and the regiment was authorized to wear a grass-green <b>hackle</b> with regimental berets. In 1948, the 14th Battalion was re-raised {{in response to the}} war with India in Kashmir, where the 2nd Battalion again distinguished itself and Captain Muhammad Sarwar became the first recipient of Nishan-i-Haider, Pakistan's highest gallantry award. In 1956, a major reorganization was undertaken in the Pakistan Army and larger infantry groups were created by amalgamating the existing infantry regiments. As a result, the 1st Punjab Regiment was amalgamated with the 14th, 15th and 16th Punjab Regiments to form one large Punjab Regiment. The four regimental centres were also merged and the combined centre moved to Mardan. The line up of the new regiment was: ...|$|E

60|$|The best {{imitation}} of this, or of any drake, which I have ever seen, is one by Mr. Macgowan, whilome of Ballyshannon, now of No. 7, Bruton-street, Berkeley-square, whose drakes, known by a waxy body of some mysterious material, do surpass those {{of all other}} men, and should be known and honoured far and wide. But failing them, you may do well with a drake which is ribbed through the whole length with red <b>hackle</b> over a straw-coloured body. A North-countryman would laugh at it, and ask us how we fancy that fish will mistake for that delicate waxy fly a heavy rough palmer, made heavier and rougher by two thick tufts of yellow mallard wing: but if he will fish therewith, he will catch trout; and mighty ones they will be. I have found, again and again, this drake, in which the <b>hackle</b> is ribbed all down the body, beat a bare-bodied one in the ratio of three fish to one. The reason is difficult to guess. Perhaps the shining transparent <b>hackle</b> gives the fly more of the waxy look of the natural insect; or perhaps the 'buzzly' look of the fly causes the fish to mistake it for one half emerged from its pupa case, fluttering, entangled, and helpless. But whatever be the cause, I am sure of the fact. Now--silence and sport {{for the next three}} hours.|$|E
