25|$|Dorabella admits her indiscretion to Fiordiligi (È amore un ladroncello—"Love is {{a little}} thief"). Fiordiligi, upset by this development, decides {{to go to the}} army and find her betrothed. Before she can leave, though, Ferrando arrives and {{continues}} his attempted seduction. Fiordiligi finally succumbs and falls <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> (duet: Fra gli amplessi—"In the embraces").

25|$|The White Lady, {{without making}} a sound, {{advances}} along the terrace. Raymonda follows her {{in a state of}} unconsciousness. At a signal from the White Lady, the garden is wrapped in mist. A moment later, the mist vanishes and Jean de Brienne appears. Overjoyed, Raymonda runs <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> and they are surrounded by glory, knights and celestial maidens. The garden is illuminated by a fantastic light and Raymonda expresses her joy to the White Lady, who interrupts her enthusiasm with a vision of what awaits her. Raymonda wants to return to her fiancé, but instead, she finds Abderakhman, who has taken Jean de Brienne's place. Abderakhman declares his passionate love for her, but Raymonda, though confused and upset, is quick to reject him. Imps and elves appear from everywhere surrounding Raymonda, who begs the White Lady to save her and Abderakhman tries to take Raymonda by force. Raymonda cries out and falls to the ground in a faint. The frightful vision disappears along with the White Lady.|$|E
25|$|Diplomatically and militarily, Napoleon III {{looked for}} support from Austria, Denmark, Bavaria, Baden, and Württemberg, as all had {{recently}} lost wars against Prussia. However, Napoleon III failed to secure revanchist alliances from these states. Denmark had twice fought Prussia during the First and Second Wars of Schleswig (a stalemate in the 1848–50, and a defeat in 1864 against a confederation of North German states and Austria {{under the leadership}} of Prussia), and was unwilling to confront Prussia again. As part of the settlement of the Austro-Prussian War in 1866, secret treaties of mutual defense were signed between Prussia and Bavaria, Baden, and Württemberg. What made them especially significant was that not only were they secret, giving Napoleon III a false sense of security, but Bismarck had used Napoleon III's earlier demand of territory along the Rhine to drive the southern German states <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms.</b> By these treaties, Prussia would defend all of the southern German states with its military power as long as their states joined the Northern Confederation in defense of Prussia. It was a bargain that would gravely threaten the French empereur and his designs on restoring French pride.|$|E

500|$|The {{subject of}} Eliot's poem {{is drawn from}} the second chapter of the Gospel of Luke (...) , and the early Christian canticle Nunc dimittis derived from it. In Luke's account, Simeon, an aged and devout Jew, stands in the Temple of Jerusalem at the time Mary and Joseph bring the infant Jesus to be {{presented}} in the temple forty days after his birth in accordance with Jewish law and custom. Luke states that Simeon is [...] "waiting for the consolation of Israel" [...] after being promised that [...] "he should not see death before {{he had seen the}} Lord's Christ". (...) Simeon, upon seeing the child, takes him <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> and prays, prophesizing the redemption of the world by Jesus and of suffering to come. This prayer would become known later as the Nunc dimittis from its Latin incipit.|$|E

[...] Crick {{went on to say that}} Kate was more suited to Mark than Mason and that picking between the two should be a no-brainer. Anthony D. Langford from TheBacklot.com quipped [...] "Oh and he's kind of a goof, but Brennan is really hot." [...] In 2016, Crick (All About Soap) criticised the character for arresting his fiancée on their wedding day, saying [...] "We all know Mark Brennan can be a bit strait-laced when it comes to being a copper (has there ever been a man in Ramsay Street who takes the law so seriously?), but apprehending your own bride while she's practically waiting at the alter for you... Really, mate?!" ...|$|E

500|$|The {{album was}} issued {{in a clear}} jewel box with a die-cut {{cardboard}} O-card. It included sixteen pages, which fold {{out to be a}} poster, which displays the cover art. Both the disc and the disc tray feature — as described by Chris Morris — an [...] "image reflective of the mania displayed by the group's fans, and exemplary of American frequently deployed shock tactics: a kid carving the band's name <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> with a scalpel." [...] Mike Bone from American Recordings said that [...] "we captured this not only by photography, but with video — him actually doing it." [...] The front cover was painted and designed by Wes Benscoter, an American artist who would later paint the covers for the other Slayer releases Undisputed Attitude and Live Intrusion. The album sleeve features for the second time the backronym Satan Laughs As You Eternally Rot. This phrase was first used on the vinyl edition of the album Show No Mercy where it was carved into the runout groove of the record.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Outrageous" [...] was {{directed}} by Dave Meyers, who previously worked in the music videos for [...] "Lucky" [...] and [...] "Boys", {{as well as the}} Curious commercials. It was shot in outdoors locations in Queens and Manhattan, New York City on June 8, 2004. The music video was set to premiere on MTV on June 28, 2004. After completion of the scenes with guest star Snoop Dogg, Spears was shooting dance scenes in Manhattan when around 11:30pm, she fell and injured her left knee. She was taken immediately to a local hospital, where doctors performed an MRI scan and found floating cartilage. The following day, Spears underwent arthroscopic surgery. Spears was forced to remain six weeks with a thigh brace, followed by eight to twelve weeks of rehabilitation, which caused the rest of the shoot as well as the remainder of The Onyx Hotel Tour to be canceled. [...] "Outrageous" [...] was also scrapped as the theme song from Catwoman. A 45-second music video composed of the scenes that were shot was released in the 2004 DVD [...] The video begins with Snoop Dogg and a group of men playing basketball in an outdoors court, until Spears appears wearing blue baggy shorts. She starts to flirt with him, before jumping <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> and licking his beard. In the next scene, she performs with her dancers on a street at night.|$|E
2500|$|Distraught and {{disappointed}} {{that he will}} never find affection, the Prince writes a suicide note and goes to throw himself into a lake at a public park inhabited by swans.

Initially rejected by the lead Swan, the Prince is gradually accepted and eventually taken <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms,</b> realizing what the Prince now knows he always desired. The Prince is elated and abandons his plan to kill himself. [...] This Act contains the most talked-about element of the ballet in which bare-chested, male dancers play the swans, and it contains a very sensual pas de deux between the lead Swan and the Prince.|$|E

[...] Coach Schembechler said after the game that the 77-yard touchdown was [...] "a play that took the starch right out of their sails." [...] Columnist Mitch Albom wrote after the game that Harbaugh's pass to Kolesar was an image that would last: [...] "The image that repeats will be that of Jim Harbaugh dropping back {{in the fourth quarter}} and uncorking a soaring spiral that rose high and long as flanker John Kolesar ran underneath it, his steps seemingly in sync with the revolutions of the ball, so when it fell, it fell right <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms,</b> almost gently [...] [...] [...]" [...] Harbaugh completed 16 of 19 passes for 230 yards and three touchdowns.|$|E
