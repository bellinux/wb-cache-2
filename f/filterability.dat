Some deformability tests may be more physiologically-relevant than others for given applications. For example, perfusion is more sensitive to relatively small changes in deformability (compared to <b>filterability),</b> thus making it preferable for assessing RBC deformability in contexts where microcirculatory implications are of particular interest.

The efficiency of the filtration process in an MBR is governed by the activated sludge <b>filterability,</b> which is still limitedly understood and is determined by the interactions between the biomass, the wastewater and the applied process conditions. The purpose of this thesis is to increase understanding of the factors impacting activated sludge <b>filterability</b> during full-scale membrane bioreactor (MBR) operation. The overall research goal was to determine conditions for enhanced and efficient operation of the MBR technology. The research work included both extended on-site measurements and operational data analysis. <b>Filterability</b> of the activated sludge was experimentally determined in full- and pilot-scale MBRs treating both municipal and industrial wastewater. Subsequently, the most influential parameters influencing activated sludge <b>filterability</b> were determined. In addition, the design, operational and performance data were collected from the selected full-scale MBR plants and analysed in respect to plant functioning, i. e., operation, energy efficiency and operational costs. Therefore, the research links activated sludge <b>filterability</b> assessment and full-scale MBR functioning, i. e., design options, operation, performance and energy efficiency. Overall, it can be concluded that good <b>filterability</b> of the activated sludge is indispensable for efficient and optimal operation of an MBR. Operation with poor sludge <b>filterability</b> will be associated with a cost penalty due to sub-optimal filtration conditions. Wastewater composition and temperature are important influencing parameters with respect to <b>filterability.</b> MBR plant layout and membrane configuration influence overall MBR functioning and should be chosen carefully. The energy efficiency of an MBR is driven by the hydraulic utilization of the membranes and can be improved by implementation of flow equalization, new aeration strategies and adjusting operational settings to the incoming flow.

40|$|The {{relation}} between activated sludge <b>filterability</b> and {{mixed liquor suspended solids}} (MLSS) concentration in membrane bioreactors (MBRs) is framed {{in a single}} hypothesis, explaining results seemingly contradictory. A total of 44 activated sludge samples were collected and analyzed on a variety of parameters, i. e. <b>filterability,</b> MLSS concentration, soluble microbial products (SMP) concentrations and particle size distribution in the range of 2 - 100 ?m and of 0. 4 - 5. 0 ?m. The sludge <b>filterability</b> was assessed by using the Delft Filtration Characterization method (DFCm). In order to investigate the impact of MLSS concentration, identical samples were diluted with permeate. Results showed that dilution of the samples led to an increased activated sludge <b>filterability,</b> but only when the starting MLSS concentration was below the apparent critical value of 10. 5 g/L. As opposed, the <b>filterability</b> of sludge with MLSS concentrations above 10. 5 g/L, and which was characterized by a moderate to good filtration quality, i. e. ?R 20 < 1 [x 1012 m- 1], worsened when diluted. The specific resistance times the particle concentration of a cake layer obtained when filtrating sludge of moderate to good <b>filterability</b> and MLSS concentration above the apparent critical value, was 5. 5 times smaller compared to the cake layer of sludge with MLSS concentration below the critical value. Results from SMP assessment and particle counting in the range 2 - 100 ?m showed that reduction in sludge mass and de-flocculation occurred, upon dilution of all samples. However, when diluting sludge samples with MLSS concentrations exceeding 10. 5 g/L and which were characterized by a moderate to good filtration characteristics, there was also release of particles below 0. 4 ?m, opposite to dilutions of samples with MLSS concentrations below 10. 5 g/L. We postulate that sludge, which is characterized by a moderate to good <b>filterability,</b> having an MLSS concentration above the apparent critical value of 10. 5 g/L, is likely to retain particles smaller than 0. 4 ?m in its mass, as opposed to sludge with MLSS concentration below the apparent critical value.

Our {{results are not}} consistent with the generally-held belief that tubulin in solution is a 110, 000 -mol-wt dimer. Rather, tubulin in solution consists of small oligomers; dimers are a minority species. The small proportion of dimers was readily apparent from ultrafiltration experiments. We first compared the <b>filterability</b> (defined as the ratio of protein concentration in filtrate to that applied to the filter) of phosphocellulose-purified tubulin (PC-tubulin) with aldolase (142, 000 mol wt). Using an Amicon XM 300 filter, the <b>filterability</b> of PC-tubulin at room temperature and at a concentration of 0. 5 mg/ml was only 0. 12, whereas under the same conditions the <b>filterability</b> of aldolase was 0. 60.

40|$|A {{considerable}} amount of South African raw sugar is sold to export markets. Consistently good <b>filterability</b> of this sugar is important for satisfying the requirements of customers. To the refiner, the <b>filterability</b> of raw melt is important as this affects refinery throughput. Analysis of filtrationimpeding impurities in raw sugar has shown that, among other things, poor juice clarification {{could be related to}} poor filtering sugars. To this end, a South African Sugar Association sponsored investigation into sources of high turbidity in clarified juices and their relation to poor filtering sugars was begun. Results from the 2002 season show that both process variables and cane quality were causes of high juice turbidities. In particular, flow disturbances, poor pH control, and poor and frequent start-up and shutdown incidents were major process variable contributors to poor turbidities. Some of the worst start-up and shutdown incidents would have resulted in carryover. Poor cane quality consistently resulted in high juice turbidity. While cane quality is largely a field issue, evidence suggests that slowing down of the factory does improve juice turbidity. This strategy would be particularly beneficial when employed to minimise the frequency of the shutdown and start-up often associated with poor cane supply. It is planned to correlate juice turbidity to sugar <b>filterability</b> and to relate these to various aspects of cane quality. <b>Filterability</b> of raw sugar is generally only measured at the Sugar Terminal and then only on composited samples.

Progressive reduction of oxygen tension within the arterial range caused a sudden loss of <b>filterability</b> of SCA erythrocytes through 5 -micron-diam pores at a critical PO 2 between 110 and 190 mmHg. This loss of <b>filterability</b> occurred at a higher PO 2 than did morphological sickling, and the critical PO 2 correlated significantly (r = 0. 844 - 0. 881, P less than 0. 01) with the polymerization tendency for each patient. Study of density-gradient fractionated cells from four SCA patients indicated that the critical PO 2 of dense cells was reached when only a small amount of polymer had formed, indicating the influence of this subpopulation on the results obtained for unfractionated cells. Impairment of erythrocyte <b>filterability</b> at high oxygen saturation (greater than 90 %) suggests that small changes in oxygen saturation within the arterial circulation cause rheological impairment of sickle cells...|$|E
40|$|The {{technologies}} of aerobic granular sludge sequencing batch reactor (SBR) and membrane bioreactor (MBR) were combined {{in an attempt}} to develop an aerobic granular sludge membrane bioreactor (GMBR). The objectives were to determine the mechanisms controlling the formation of granules and granule stability in the GMBR as well as to evaluate the <b>filterability</b> of the granular sludge. The GMBR was operated in parallel with a SBR. In the SBR granulation was achieved after 16 days while no granulation was observed in the GMBR even after 10 weeks of operation. <b>Filterability</b> of the GMBR biomass, which was dominated by flocs, was compared with the <b>filterability</b> of granules cultivated in the SBR. The results showed no significant difference in <b>filterability</b> of granular sludge versus flocular sludge. Also, the clean water flux obtained after filtering flocular sludge was higher than after filtering granular sludge, suggesting that irreversible membrane fouling caused by adsorption of soluble extracellular polymeric substances (sEPS) was more important in the granules than in the flocs. According to the results of this study, granular sludge {{might not be able to}} alleviate the membrane fouling problem in MBRs. Furthermore, it could lead to irreversible membrane fouling in a major extent than that produced by conventional flocular sludge...|$|E
40|$|The {{knowledge}} of pressure dependency of <b>filterability</b> (particle volume fraction φ and specific cake resistance α) {{is essential for}} optimization of sludge dewatering operations (settling, centrifugation, dead-end filtration-consolidation). The analytical centrifugation is a promising alternative to the classical laboratory methods of the <b>filterability</b> measurement (constant pressure dead-end filtration, compression permeability experiments) due {{to the possibility of}} automated many samples characterization. A number of methods are available for the analysis of centrifugal consolidation data (i. e.,dependency of centrifugal consolidation kinetics and sediment height on centrifugal acceleration) and characterization of sludge <b>filterability,</b> which are based on the idealized representation of a sample (usually, concentrated and aggregated suspension) behaviour in the centrifugal field [1 - 4]. However, recent works suggest that centrifugal consolidation can be influenced by side different effects (as wall friction [5] and particles segregation [6]) that {{must be taken into account}} (or eliminated by appropriate choice of the experimental protocol) for the correct characterization of <b>filterability.</b> Objective: Our current work is devoted to the development of a new method and protocols for the determination of pressure dependency of <b>filterability</b> of concentrated aggregated suspensions (pressure dependency of particle volume fraction φ and specific cake resistance α) from the centrifugal consolidation data (two-stage and multistage centrifugal consolidation kinetics). Methods: The method is based on the comparison of experimental characteristic consolidation time with the values tabulated for samples with different <b>filterability.</b> The tabulated values of characteristic consolidation time are obtained by the numerical solution of basic consolidation equation [7] for moderately compressible samples. The method was tested on the aqueous kaolin suspensions. Different experimental protocols were studied (Lumisizer) : a) single stage centrifugation different constant centrifugal accelerations; b) two-stage centrifugation (centrifugal pre-consolidation at low centrifugal acceleration followed by centrifugation at different higher accelerations); c) multistage centrifugal consolidation (pre-consolidation followed by centrifugal acceleration ramping); Results: The x-ray transmission analysis (Lumireader x-ray) revealed that the single stage centrifugation can result in formation of nonhomogeneous sediment (probably, due to the particles segregation at high centrifugal acceleration), while two-stage and multistage experiments yields sediments with homogeneous solid pressure distribution. Conclusions: Sample pre-consolidation at low centrifugal acceleration is necessary for the correct analysis of the <b>filterability</b> be the method of centrifugal consolidation. The kinetics of two- and multistage centrifugal consolidation can be analyzed with the help of the developed method in order to determine the pressure dependency of the specific cake resistance in the wide solid pressure range...|$|E
40|$|The {{success of}} {{anaerobic}} digestion {{relies on the}} presence of highly active methanogenic biomass, requiring effective retention of slow growing anaerobic microorganisms inside bioreactor by decoupling the hydraulic retention time (HRT) from solids residence time (SRT) or the employment of long SRTs in fully mixed systems. So far, flow through systems, i. e. completely stirred tank reactor (CSTR) digesters, and granular sludge bed reactors have been commonly applied for anaerobic treatment of slurries and low particulate matter containing streams, respectively. Physical separation of particulates by membranes is an efficient tool to uncouple SRT from HRT. Anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR) is a combination of an anaerobic process with membrane units located either inside or outside the reactor. These systems are expected to fill the gap between low loaded slurry digesters and high rate granular sludge bed reactors. AnMBRs are especially suitable when efficient biomass retention cannot be achieved due to wastewater characteristics, inappropriate reactor operation and/or design. AnMBRs provide an excellent treatment efficiency, thanks to the membrane filtration which ensures particulate free effluent. On the other hand, membrane fluxes in AnMBRs are naturally limited by the effectiveness of the filtration process which is impacted by the build-up of a fouling layer in and on the membrane surface. The degree of fouling can be described by the increase in transmembrane pressure (TMP) or by the reduction of filtrate flux due to clogging of membrane pores or dense cake-layer later build-up. The reasons and mitigation possibilities of membrane fouling have received a significant scientific interest for decades. However, thus far, membrane fouling remains the focal point of membrane bioreactor (MBR) studies due to the complexity of phenomenon. The purpose of this thesis is to further increase the understanding of fouling phenomena in AnMBR systems by evaluating the impact of substrate composition and the effect of factors such as SRT on biological performance and sludge <b>filterability.</b> In order to mitigate fouling in AnMBRs, it is of crucial importance to understand the impact of operational conditions on sludge characteristics and <b>filterability.</b> Standard parameters such as capillary suction time (CST), specific resistance to filtration (SRF), and critical flux (CF) was used to evaluate the effect of different operation conditions. Moreover, the influence of high lipid content, acidified and non-acidified wastewaters and nitrogen deficiency on sludge characteristics and <b>filterability</b> was investigated. The SRT had an effect on both biodegradation efficiency and <b>filterability.</b> A higher degree of substrate bioconversion to methane was observed at increased SRT. Controversially, the increase in SRT led to poor <b>filterability</b> due to accumulation of colloids and soluble microbial products (SMP) in the bulk sludge. The <b>filterability</b> parameters such as CST and SRF were found as valuable tools for subjective comparison of operational changes. However, it was difficult to evaluate the relationships between <b>filterability</b> parameters and membrane fouling due to the complexity of fouling and non-linearity of correlations. Thus, it was suggested to evaluate a set of parameters about sludge characteristics and <b>filterability</b> in order to establish a link with membrane fouling. For corn thin stillage and cheese whey permeate as the substrates we observed high COD removal efficiencies, exceeding 95 %, which confirms the excellent performance of AnMBRs. However, the hydrolysis products of lipids, i. e. long chain fatty acids (LCFAs), caused reversible inhibition by forming a layer on the bioflocs that retards the transfer of substrate and nutrients. The biomass activity decrease due to LCFA adsorption was almost completely recoverable when the feed was stopped. However, the LCFA adsorption had other consequences on sludge surface characteristics. The results of this thesis showed that LCFA adsorption on biomass increased its hydrophobicity which in turn decreased its fouling propensity. Very likely, owing to the increased hydrophobicity of the flocs there is less interaction with the hydrophilic membrane. Feeding non-acidified substrate to the AnMBR led to a rapid deterioration of the sludge <b>filterability,</b> which was attributed to the proliferation of acidogenic microorganisms on the rapidly fermentable carbohydrates. The abundant presence of single cell acidogens decreased the median particle size of the sludge. Additionally, the food to microorganism ratio (F:M) was found an important parameter impacting sludge <b>filterability.</b> An increase in this parameter resulted in accumulation of soluble microbial products (SMP) which led to deterioration of the supernatant <b>filterability.</b> The experiments carried out with cheese whey revealed that nitrogen content effected both reactor stability and bulk liquid <b>filterability.</b> Nitrogen deficiency limited biomass growth and caused volatile fatty acids (VFA) accumulation, especially propionic acid, even at low organic loads. This was ascribed to metabolic changes which likely caused an adverse effect on syntrophic propionate oxidation. On the other hand sludge <b>filterability</b> rapidly deteriorated when AnMBR was fed with nitrogen supplied whey at a COD:TKN ratio of 50. We observed two distinct fractions of biomass with different particle size distribution, SRF and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) content. The reduction of sludge <b>filterability</b> was attributed to induced growth of acidogenic biomass on lactose with surplus of nitrogen. Water ManagementCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
