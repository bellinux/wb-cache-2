As the main section of the song begins, cameras zoom in on Knowles as she dances in {{a black and white}} latex leotard while holding sunglasses with hand signals on them. When the first verse begins, Knowles seductively <b>dances</b> <b>for</b> <b>two</b> men who have cameras as heads. Another scene shows her teasing men with futuristic toy guns while wearing a skin-colored latex top. During Gaga's verse, she and Knowles appear wearing white leotards; they both sing to the camera while shooting more toy guns in open fire. Knowles next brandishes a bow and fires arrows at a cameraman who's strapped to a rotating dart board.
