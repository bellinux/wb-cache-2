5000|$|When an object's weight (its {{gravitational}} force) {{is expressed}} in [...] "kilograms", this actually refers to the <b>kilogram-force</b> (kgf or kg-f), {{also known as the}} kilopond (kp), which is a non-SI unit of force. All objects on the Earth's surface are subject to a gravitational acceleration of approximately 9.8 m/s2. The General Conference on Weights and Measures fixed the value of standard gravity at precisely 9.80665 m/s2 so that disciplines such as metrology would have a standard value for converting units of defined mass into defined forces and pressures. Thus the <b>kilogram-force</b> is defined as precisely 9.80665 newtons. In reality, gravitational acceleration (symbol: g) varies slightly with latitude, elevation and subsurface density; these variations are typically only a few tenths of a percent. See also Gravimetry.|$|E

50|$|A <b>kilogram-force</b> {{per square}} {{centimetre}} (kgf/cm2), often just kilogram per square centimetre (kg/cm2), or kilopond per square centimetre is a deprecated unit of pressure using metric units. It {{is not a}} part of the International System of Units (SI), the modern metric system. 1 kgf/cm2 equals 98.0665 kilopascals.|$|E
50|$|Many other hybrid {{units are}} used such as mmHg/cm2 or grams-force/cm2 (sometimes as kg/cm2 without {{properly}} identifying the force units).

5000|$|In English {{contexts}} {{the unit}} of force is usually formed by simply appending [...] "force" [...] to {{the unit of}} mass, thus gram-force (gf) or <b>kilogram-force</b> (kgf, which follows the tradition of pound-force (lbf).

5000|$|The {{value of}} [...] defined above is a nominal {{midrange}} value on Earth, originally {{based on the}} acceleration of a body in free fall at sea level at a geodetic latitude of 45°.

50|$|Because {{mass and}} weight are {{separate}} quantities, {{they have different}} units of measure. In the International System of Units (SI), the kilogram is the basic unit of mass, and the newton is the basic unit of force. The non-SI <b>kilogram-force</b> is also a unit of force typically used in the measure of weight. Similarly, the avoirdupois pound, used in both the Imperial system and U.S. customary units, is a unit of mass, and its related unit of force is the pound-force.|$|E
50|$|The prefix {{was a part}} of the {{original}} metric system in 1795. It is not in very common usage, although the decapascal is occasionally used by audiologists. The decanewton is also encountered occasionally, probably because it is an SI approximation of the <b>kilogram-force.</b> Its use is more common in Central Europe. In German, Polish (deka, deko), Czech, Slovak and Hungarian, deca is common (and used as a word on its own always means decagram). A runway number typically indicates its heading in decadegrees.|$|E
5000|$|The {{name comes}} from {{combining}} the words [...] "kilo" [...] and [...] "pound"; it is occasionally called a kilopound. Its symbol is kip, or less frequently, klb. When {{it is necessary to}} clearly distinguish it as a unit of force rather than mass, it is sometimes called the kip-force (symbol kipf or klbf).Note that the symbol kp usually stands for a different unit of force, the kilopond or <b>kilogram-force</b> used primarily in Europe prior to the introduction of SI units.|$|E
50|$|In {{railroad}} engineering, curve {{resistance is}} a part of train resistance, namely the additional rolling resistance a train must overcome when travelling on a curved section of track. Curve resistance is typically measured in per mille, with the correct physical unit being Newton per kilo-Newton or N/kN. Older texts still use the wrong unit of <b>kilogram-force</b> per tonne or kgf/t, which mixes an (outdated) unit of force and a unit of mass. Sometimes also kg/t was used, which confused the resisting force with a mass.|$|E
50|$|Other {{units of}} {{pressure}}, such as {{pounds per square}} inch and bar, are also in common use. The CGS unit of pressure is the barye (Ba), equal to 1 dyn·cm−2, or 0.1 Pa. Pressure is sometimes expressed in grams-force or kilograms-force per square centimetre (g/cm2 or kg/cm2) and the like without properly identifying the force units. But using the names kilogram, gram, <b>kilogram-force,</b> or gram-force (or their symbols) as units of force is expressly forbidden in SI. The technical atmosphere (symbol: at) is 1 kgf/cm2 (98.0665 kPa, or 14.223 psi).|$|E
5000|$|Nowadays, {{the mass}} as a {{property}} {{of an object}} and its weight, which depends on {{the gravity of the}} earth at its position are strictly distinguished.

A kilopond originally referred to the weight of a mass of one kilogram. Since the gravitational acceleration {{on the surface of the}} earth can differ, one gets different values for the unit kilopond and its derived units at different locations. To avoid this, the kilopond was first defined at sea-level and a latitude of 45 degrees, since 1902 via the standard gravity of [...]|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{technical}} note was to report {{significant differences in the}} tension forces of the different-sized Thera-band (R) elastic bands (Hygenic Corp.) determined by us versus the manufacturer. [Subjects] Two trained observers performed all measurements. [Methods] The tension force (<b>kilogram-force</b> units) of eight color-coded elastic bands (tan, yellow, red, green, blue, black, silver, and gold) with different resistance levels was measured at 10 different percentages of elongation (25 % to 250 % with 25 % increments) using an electronic elongation gauge tensiometer. [Results] There were significant differences in the tension force of the elastic bands of different colors when compared in pairs (excepting the tan/yellow pair) at 100 % and 200 % elongation, as determined via one-way analysis of variance. There were no differences in the slopes for the tan versus yellow and green versus blue bands, as determined via linear regression analysis and one-way analysis of variance. Comparison of the tension force values obtained in our study with the reference values of the manufacturer (the t-test applied to the slopes) showed significant differences for five colors (yellow, green, blue, silver, and gold). [Conclusion] Our results indicate that the tension force values for Thera-Band elastic bands provided by the manufacturer are overestimates...|$|E
40|$|Background: Restorative {{materials}} must {{be capable}} {{not only of}} restoring the patient&#x 2032;s masticatory function, but also to rescue the self-esteem of those maculated by a disharmonious smile. Among the esthetic materials available on the market, the choice frequently lies between ceramic or indirect laboratory resin restorations. Aim: This study assessed the resistance to compression of two laboratory resins found on the market, namely Artglass &#x 00 AE; and Targis &#x 00 AE;, considering Omega 900 &#x 00 AE; ceramic from Vita as control. Materials and Methods: With the aid of stainless steel matrices, with internal dimensions of 8. 0 mm diameter at the base, 9. 0 mm in the top portion and 4. 0 mm height, 15 test specimens were made, being 5 of each material to be tested. The test specimens were kept in distilled water for 72 hours and submitted to an axial load {{by the action of}} a point with a rounded tip 2 mm in diameter, adapted to an EMIC 500 universal test machine. The compression speed was 0. 5 mm/min, with a load cell capacity of 200 Kgf. Results: The means of the results were calculated in <b>kilogram-force</b> (Kgf). The results found were treated by analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the differences found among the groups were identified by the Tukey test (5 &#x 0025;). Conclusion: It was observed that the material Omega 900 &#x 00 AE; offered significantly greater resistance to compression than the other two materials, which did not present statistically significant difference between them...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this in vitro study was to {{evaluate}} the effect of etching time on the tensile bond strength (TBS) of a conventional adhesive bonded to dentin previously irradiated with erbium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Er:YAG) and erbium, chromium:yttrium-scandium-gallium-garnet (Er,Cr:YSGG) lasers. Buccal and lingual surfaces of 45 third molars were flattened until the dentin was exposed and randomly assigned to three groups (n = 30) according to the dentin treatment: control (not irradiated), irradiated with Er:YAG (1 W; 250 mJ; 4 Hz; 80. 6 J/cm(2)) laser or Er,Cr:YSGG (4 W; 200 mJ; 20 Hz; 71. 4 J/cm(2)) laser, and into three subgroups (n = 10) according to acid etching time (15 s, 30 s or 60 s) for each experimental group. After acid etching, the adhesive was applied, followed by {{the construction of an}} inverted cone of composite resin. The samples were immersed in distilled water (37 A degrees C for 24 h) and subjected to TBS test [50 <b>kilogram-force</b> (kgf), 0. 5 mm/min]. Data were analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey statistical tests (P a parts per thousand currency signaEuro parts per thousand 0. 05). Control group samples presented significant higher TBS values than those of all lased groups. Both irradiated groups exhibited similar TBS values. Samples subjected to the different etching times in each experimental group presented similar TBS. Based on the conditions of this in vitro study we concluded that Er:YAG and Er,Cr:YSGG laser irradiation of the dentin weakens the bond strength of the adhesive. Moreover, increased etching time is not able to modify the bonding strength of the adhesive to irradiated dentin.
