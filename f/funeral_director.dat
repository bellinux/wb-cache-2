5|$|After {{the family}} obtains the CCOD, they usually engage a <b>funeral</b> <b>director</b> (also {{known as an}} undertaker) who {{collects}} the body, embalms it if necessary, and delivers it to the wake. In addition, they {{have to decide whether}} the body is to be cremated or buried, and register the death. The <b>funeral</b> <b>director</b> also helps to make arrangements for the wake and funeral, according to the religious beliefs and wishes of the family.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} has a dual purpose. Firstly {{to describe}} what <b>funeral</b> <b>directors</b> do and how they experience their work. Secondly to see if, {{and in that case}} how, <b>funeral</b> <b>directors</b> influence rites around the deceased, both official as well as more private rites. The study is based on text analysis, interviews with 32 <b>funeral</b> <b>directors</b> and field studies on four funeral parlours. Only <b>funeral</b> <b>directors</b> working at businesses that are members of Sveriges Begravningsbyråers Förbund (an association of <b>funeral</b> <b>directors</b> in Sweden), SBF are included. Different theories about stigma, body culture, rites and religiosity, and professionalisation are used to explain the experiences and thoughts of the <b>funeral</b> <b>directors.</b> The study shows that the <b>funeral</b> <b>directors</b> live with a double representation of their occupation. On the one side, as an occupation related to dead bodies, the occupation is "dirty" and strange, and can thus be a stigma in their social life. On the other side, the <b>funeral</b> <b>directors</b> are seen as experts on deceased persons, funerals and wills. To move away from the negative representation, the <b>funeral</b> <b>directors</b> focus their work on the bereaved families and their needs. The occupation should therefore be seen as dealing with life more than with death. The actual work conducted by the <b>funeral</b> <b>directors</b> is presented through field observations from the parlours, for example meetings with the bereaved family, dressings of the deceased, viewings, funeral services and interments of the urn. The study examines the professionalisation of the <b>funeral</b> <b>directors</b> in four different ways: by looking at the organisation, at the base of knowledge, at the acknowledgement and at the work on the specific task areas. The acknowledgement from society and the bereaved families has made it possible for the <b>funeral</b> <b>directors</b> to enter new task areas and the base of knowledge shows a change from a sales occupation to a service occupation. By leading rites surrounding the deceased, such as the viewing and the interment of the urn, the <b>funeral</b> <b>directors</b> have been able use the field of rites for their professionalisation...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} few decades, the gender {{composition}} of <b>funeral</b> <b>directors</b> in the United States has changed dramatically as women have entered this traditionally male dominated occupation. To practice as <b>funeral</b> <b>directors,</b> women (and men) must be licensed {{in all but one}} state. The most extensive training requirements exist in the 27 states with ―ready-to-embalm ‖ laws, which require <b>funeral</b> <b>directors</b> to be embalmers. Using a sample of 44, 898 licensing records from 40 states, we find that 19. 9 percent of <b>funeral</b> <b>directors</b> were women in 2006. However, the proportion is significantly lower in states with ready-to-embalm laws. Our regressions imply that these laws reduce the proportion of female <b>funeral</b> <b>directors</b> by 18 to 24 percent. More generally, we find that the number of <b>funeral</b> <b>directors</b> per capita is 18 percent lower, on average, in states with ready-toembalm laws. Using a sample from the Census, we also find that these laws increase the earnings of <b>funeral</b> <b>directors</b> by 6. 5 percent. Finally, there is a gender gap in earnings of 20 to 30 percent across all states, which does not increase in states with ready-to-embalm laws...|$|R
5000|$|The new Funeral Celebrants {{needed to}} {{establish}} working {{relationships with the}} <b>Funeral</b> <b>Directors,</b> whose role was to collect, prepare, and store {{the bodies of the}} deceased. <b>Funeral</b> <b>directors</b> were then (1970s and 1980s) mostly smaller family owned firms. <b>Funeral</b> <b>Directors</b> John and Rob Allison of John Allison Monkhouse (Melbourne, Victoria) were particularly supportive of Funeral Celebrants. So was the active idealist Des Tobin, General Manager of Tobin Brothers Funeral Parlours of Melbourne. The fee that <b>funeral</b> <b>directors</b> had customarily paid to the clergy was not a fee for service but merely an [...] "offering", since the general presumption was that the client was a churchgoer, who had donated to the upkeep of the clergy all his or her life.|$|R

25|$|Weinstein is the {{daughter}} of Irving Weinstein, a <b>funeral</b> <b>director</b> and owner of Weinstein & Schlump Funeral Homes. She grew up in the Grand Concourse in the borough of the Bronx in New York City. She is the former lover of Ethel Merman (although she tends to exaggerate the details of their now infamous 1967 tryst during Ethel's daughter's funeral) and has had affairs with Martina Navratilova, Ellen DeGeneres, k.d. lang, Melissa Etheridge and Rosie O'Donnell. In her youth, she claims to have performed oral sex on Nancy Reagan which she now regrets. Weinstein's most notable lesbian relationship was with Gussie Iscowicz (the alter ego of Bluestein's late partner Juan Montealegre), an elderly hairdresser living in Miami, Florida who suffered from Alzheimer's. For many years, Weinstein edited gay pornography for an urban audience (for a company known only as 'the Dorm'). She currently resides in Miami, Florida with her Italian greyhound Trotsky.|$|E
25|$|Most {{dissection}} {{involves the}} careful isolation and removal of individual organs, called the Virchow technique. An alternative more cumbersome technique involves {{the removal of}} the entire organ body, called the Letulle technique. This technique allows a body to be sent to a <b>funeral</b> <b>director</b> without waiting for the sometimes time-consuming dissection of individual organs. The Rokitansky method involves an in situ dissection of the organ block, and the technique of Ghon involves dissection of three separate blocks of organs - the thorax and cervical areas, gastrointestinal and abdominal organs, and urogenital organs. Dissection of individual organs involves accessing the area in which the organ is situated, and systematically removing the anatomical connections of that organ to its surroundings. For example, when removing the heart, connects such as the superior vena cava and inferior vena cava are separated. If pathological connections exist, such as a fibrous pericardium, then this may be deliberately dissected along with the organ.|$|E

500|$|Jolie first {{attended}} Beverly Hills High School, {{where she}} felt isolated among {{the children of}} some of the area's affluent families because her mother survived on a more modest income.

500|$|... "Gone for Goode" [...] {{included}} several storylines, and even exact bits of dialogue, adapted straight from Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets. Among them were {{the investigation into}} Calpurnia Smith, an elderly woman suspected of murdering five husbands in order to collect their life insurance policies. This {{was based on the}} real-life case of Geraldine Parrish, who was also accused of killing five husbands for insurance money, and was eventually convicted for three of their deaths. A scene involving a <b>funeral</b> <b>director</b> accidentally exhuming the wrong body while investigating the Church case mirrored a similar situation described in Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets from the Parrish case. [...] The Adena Watson murder case, which is assigned to Bayliss in the final scene of [...] "Gone for Goode", was adapted from the unsolved 1988 slaying of Latonya Kim Wallace, which made up {{a major part of the}} book. The Watson case became an important story arc throughout the first season which ended without the case being solved. The hit-and-run murder of Jenny Goode was also based on Simon's book, and the murder of the elderly man was inspired by a case featured in the book in which a young homosexual man killed his elderly lover and stole his car.|$|E
500|$|During the First World War, {{the morning}} of 13 June 1917 was the first ever {{daylight}} air-raid over the East End which in total killed 104 people. Sixteen of the dead were 5 and 6 year olds who were sitting in their class room at Upper North Street School, Poplar when the bomb hit. The memorial which still stands today in Poplar Recreation Ground was built by A.R. Adams, a local <b>funeral</b> <b>director</b> at the time. [...] Also, on 19 January 1917, 73 people died, including 14 workers, and more than 400 were injured, in a TNT explosion in the Brunner-Mond munitions factory in Silvertown. Much of the area was flattened, and the shock wave was felt throughout the city and much of Essex. This was the largest explosion in London history, and was heard in Southampton and Norwich. Andreas Angel, chief chemist at the plant, was posthumously awarded the Edward Medal for trying to extinguish the fire that caused the blast. The same year, on 13 June, a bomb from a German Gotha bomber killed 18 children in their primary school in Upper North Street, Poplar. This event is commemorated by the local war memorial erected in Poplar Recreation Ground, but during the war a total of 120 children and 104 adults {{were killed in the}} East End by aerial bombing, with many more injured.|$|E
500|$|... "The Pony Remark" [...] {{featured}} the second appearance of Helen and Morty Seinfeld, {{who had previously}} appeared in the season 1 episode [...] "The Stake Out". In [...] "The Stake Out", Morty was portrayed by Phil Bruns; however, David and Seinfeld decided they wanted the character to be harsher, and re-cast him with Barney Martin, who auditioned for the part on October 15, 1990 at 12.45 PM. Martin was unaware that another actor had already established the part. Helen was portrayed by Liz Sheridan; in an early draft of the episode, her name was Adele, though this did not match her name from [...] "The Stake Out". It was later changed back to Helen. The episode also introduced Jerry's uncle Leo, portrayed by Len Lesser, who {{was known for his}} acting in gangster films, and also The Outlaw Josey Wales and Kelly's Heroes. When Lesser auditioned for the part on October 22, 1990, he got a lot of laughs from David, Seinfeld and casting director Marc Herschfield, but did not understand why, because he did not think his lines were funny. Herschfield stated that Lesser was the right actor for the part when Lesser had auditioned. David Fresco guest starred in the episode as Isaac. Fresco had some difficulty with his lines in the episode, and would sometimes burst into laughter during filming. Other actors who guest-starred in the episode were Rozsika Halmos, who portrayed Manya, and Milt Oberman, who played the <b>funeral</b> <b>director.</b>|$|E

40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} {{the attitudes and}} experiences of <b>funeral</b> <b>directors</b> in relation to necropsies. METHODS: All 1631 members of the National Association of <b>Funeral</b> <b>Directors</b> were surveyed by postal questionnaire about the purposes of necropsies, the technical and administrative problems associated with necropsied cases and their relations with relatives, mortuaries and pathology departments. RESULTS: In total, 123 <b>funeral</b> <b>directors</b> completed the questionnaire (8 % response rate). Workload, proportion of cases necropsied and type of mortuary did not influence answers. Necropsies were considered important {{for the assessment of}} treatment outcome, identification of inherited disease and junior pathologist training, but not for medical audit. There was strong support for more education about necropsies. The areas of necropsy practice most frequently discussed with relatives related to concerns about funeral delay and the involvement of the coroner or equivalent authority. <b>Funeral</b> <b>directors</b> occasionally counselled relatives for or against giving necropsy consent. The commonest technical problems associated with necropsies were difficulties in embalming, leakage of body fluids and scalpel penetration in visible areas. Few administrative problems were reported; the commonest was inflexibility in body collection times. There was strong support for a national code of practice to cover relations between <b>funeral</b> <b>directors</b> and mortuaries despite general satisfaction with relations with local pathology departments. CONCLUSIONS: Although the relation among the funeral profession, mortuaries and pathology departments is largely satisfactory, a national code of practice for <b>funeral</b> <b>directors</b> and mortuaries is desirable...|$|R
