5|$|<b>High-speed</b> USB2.0 hubs contain devices called {{transaction}} translators that convert between <b>high-speed</b> USB2.0 {{buses and}} full and low speed buses. When a <b>high-speed</b> USB2.0 hub is plugged into a <b>high-speed</b> USB host or hub, it operates in <b>high-speed</b> mode. The USB hub then uses either one transaction translator per hub {{to create a}} full/low-speed bus routed to all full and low speed devices on the hub, or uses one transaction translator per port to create an isolated full/low-speed bus per port on the hub.|$|E
5|$|Plans for an {{expansion}} of the <b>high-speed</b> line to Hamar have been launched, but have not been incorporated into any specific plans. This suggestion would increase the length of the <b>high-speed</b> rail north of Oslo with —almost a doubling. The project may or may not incorporate a further <b>high-speed</b> line to Trondheim.|$|E

5|$|Its {{extensions}} to Belgium {{and towards}} Paris, {{as well as}} connecting to the Channel Tunnel, have made LGV Nord a part of every Eurostar journey undertaken. A Belgian <b>high-speed</b> line, HSL 1, {{was added to the}} end of LGV Nord, at the Belgian border, in 1997. Of all French <b>high-speed</b> lines, LGV Nord sees the widest variety of <b>high-speed</b> rolling stock and is quite busy; a proposed cut-off bypassing Lille, which would reduce Eurostar journey times to Paris, is called LGV Picardie.|$|E
5|$|Silicon-germanium alloys {{are rapidly}} {{becoming}} an important semiconductor material for <b>high-speed</b> integrated circuits.

5|$|Such long-distance <b>high-speed</b> {{railways}} are {{not included}} in the preliminary long-term plan for 2010–2040, and it is likely that railways Hamar–Trondheim and Drammen–Kristansand will be built first since they are easier to build. It is likely that a <b>high-speed</b> railway to Bergen will be built sometime in the period 2030–2060.|$|E
5|$|The tunnel {{is part of}} the LGV Est <b>high-speed</b> rail line, {{which will}} connect Paris with Strasbourg. The line is also a part of the Main line for Europe trans-European <b>high-speed</b> rail line from Paris to Bratislava, Slovakia.|$|E

5|$|As {{part of the}} American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, the Federal Railroad Administration {{identified}} ten regions {{for potential}} development as <b>high-speed</b> rail corridorsErie lies in a gap near three corridors: the Chicago Hub Network, the Empire Corridor, and the Keystone Corridor. The local passenger rail advocacy group, All Aboard Erie, proposed a feasibility study in 2014 for <b>high-speed</b> rail service to connect to the corridors at Cleveland and Buffalo. The group also sought to determine if rail service would be possible using the existing tracks and right of way between Erie, Youngstown and Pittsburgh.|$|E
5|$|Bristol has two {{principal}} railway stations. Bristol Temple Meads (near the city centre) has Great Western Railway services which includes <b>high-speed</b> trains to London Paddington and local, regional and CrossCountry trains. Bristol Parkway, {{north of the}} city centre, has <b>high-speed</b> Great Western Railway services to Swansea, Cardiff Central and London Paddington and CrossCountry services to Birmingham and the North East. Limited service to London Waterloo via Clapham Junction from Bristol Temple Meads is operated by South Western Railway, and there are scheduled coach links to most major UK cities.|$|E

5|$|Domestically, {{air travel}} between Paris {{and some of}} France's largest cities such as Lyon, Marseille, or Strasbourg {{has been in a}} large measure {{replaced}} by <b>high-speed</b> rail due to the opening of several <b>high-speed</b> TGV rail lines from the 1980s. For example, after the LGV Méditerranée opened in 2001, air traffic between Paris and Marseille declined from 2,976,793 passengers in 2000 to 1,502,196 passengers in 2014. After the LGV Est opened in 2007, air traffic between Paris and Strasbourg declined from 1,006,327 passengers in 2006 to 157,207 passengers in 2014.|$|E
5|$|Eurostar is a <b>high-speed</b> {{railway service}} {{connecting}} London with Avignon, Brussels, Lille, Lyon, Marseille and Paris. All its trains traverse the Channel Tunnel between the United Kingdom and France, {{owned and operated}} separately by Eurotunnel.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{construction}} of the <b>high-speed</b> Gardermoen Line from Oslo, via Oslo Airport, Gardermoen, to Eidsvoll, the Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communications started planning additional <b>high-speed</b> lines west and southeast of Oslo. The Asker and Follo Lines would allow express and regional trains to travel faster and more reliably to Drammen and Ski, leaving the old tracks for slower freight trains, and commuter trains making frequent stops. Construction of the Follo Line will, at the earliest, be completed in 2015.|$|E

5|$|Higher-speed rail (HrSR), {{also known}} as {{high-performance}} rail, higher-performance rail, or almost-high-speed rail, is a jargon used to describe inter-city passenger rail services that have top speeds of more than conventional rail but are not high enough to be called <b>high-speed</b> rail services. The term is also used by planners to identify the incremental rail improvements to increase train speeds and reduce travel time as alternatives to larger efforts to create or expand the <b>high-speed</b> rail networks. Some countries use the term medium-speed rail, or semi-high speed rail instead.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, Eurotunnel (the {{owners of}} the Channel Tunnel) {{announced}} that it was prepared to start relaxing the fire safety regulations, in order to permit other operators, such as Deutsche Bahn, to transport passengers via the Tunnel using other forms of rolling stock. Under the deregulation of European railway service, <b>high-speed</b> lines were opened up to access by other operators on 1 January 2010; the Inter-Governmental Commission on the Channel Tunnel (IGC) {{announced that it was}} considering relaxing the safety requirements concerning train splitting. LCR suggested that <b>high-speed</b> rail services between London and Cologne could commence before the 2012 Olympics.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the tunnel's shuttle trains carrying cars and lorries between Folkestone and Calais, the decision to build a railway tunnel opened up the possibility of through passenger and freight train services between places further afield. British Rail and SNCF contracted with Eurotunnel to use half the tunnel's capacity for this purpose. In 1987 Britain, France and Belgium set up an International Project Group to specify a train to provide an international <b>high-speed</b> passenger service through the tunnel. France had been operating <b>high-speed</b> TGV services since 1981, and had begun {{construction of a new}} <b>high-speed</b> line between Paris and the Channel Tunnel, LGV Nord; French TGV technology was chosen {{as the basis for the}} new trains. An order for 30 trainsets, to be manufactured in France but with some British and Belgian components, was placed in December 1989. On 20 June 1993, the first Eurostar test train travelled through the tunnel to the UK. Various technical difficulties in running the new trains on British tracks were quickly overcome.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to these recommendations, the NTSB also recommended that the Department of Defense restrict <b>high-speed,</b> low-altitude aircraft operation in civilian air corridors, consider collision avoidance technologies on military aircraft, and make military pilots aware of the FAA's radar advisory service.|$|E
5|$|In the First World War, the {{increasing}} range of naval guns, {{and the great}} fear of <b>high-speed,</b> long-range torpedoes used against warships and merchant ships caused {{a significant increase in}} the use of ship camouflage.|$|E

5|$|Taiwan's rapid {{economic}} growth during {{the latter half of}} the twentieth century led to saturation of highways, conventional rail, and air traffic systems in the western transport corridor, which threatened to impede further growth. The idea of a new <b>high-speed</b> rail line arose in the 1970s, and informal planning began in 1980. In 1987 the executive branch of Taiwan's government, the Executive Yuan, instructed the Ministry of Transportation to launch a feasibility study for a <b>high-speed</b> rail line in the western Taiwan corridor, which was completed in 1990. The study found that in a comparison of potential solutions to traffic problems in the corridor, a <b>high-speed</b> rail line would offer the highest transit volume, lowest land use, highest energy savings, and least pollution. In July 1990 the Preparation Office of High Speed Rail (POHSR) was established and a route was selected in 1991. Plans for the THSR were subsequently approved by the Executive Yuan in June 1992 and by Taiwan's legislature, the Legislative Yuan, in 1993.|$|E
