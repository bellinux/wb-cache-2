5|$|Not <b>everything</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> {{well with}} the Confederate advance. By 9:30a.m., as the lead Union brigades were falling back, Nathan Bedford Forrest urged Bushrod Johnson to launch an all-out attack on the disorganized troops. Johnson was too {{cautious}} to approve of a general assault, but he did agree to keep the infantry moving slowly forward. Two hours into the battle, Gen. Pillow realized that Buckner's wing was not attacking alongside his. After a confrontation between the two generals, Buckner's troops moved out and, combined with the right flank of Pillow's wing, hit W. H. L. Wallace's brigade. The Confederates took control of Forge Road and a key section of Wynn's Ferry Road, opening a route to Nashville, but Buckner's delay provided time for Lew Wallace's men to reinforce McClernand's retreating forces before they were completely routed. Despite Grant's earlier orders, Wallace's units moved to the right with Thayer's brigade, giving McClernand's men time to regroup and gather ammunition from Wallace's supplies. The 68th Ohio was left behind to protect the rear.|$|E

500|$|The fight scene between Jack and Ethan was {{performed}} by the actors themselves. The two were given the freedom to set up how their characters would fight each other. However, stunt coordinator Michael Vendrell wanted Ethan to be [...] "as feral as possible; no school of combat, karate, kung-fu." [...] Before filming the scene where Jack finds Charlie, episode director Stephen Williams scouted for a suitable location and found [...] "what looked like a cathedral," [...] because of the layout of trees behind where Charlie was hung. Monaghan had to be harnessed to a cable for roughly four to five hours. The actor described the scene; [...] "they {{put me in the}} tree and I just hung there. I just hung limp. I tried to fall asleep, I tried to relax. When <b>everything</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> on, when they cut me down from the tree, when [...] was trying to revive me, when [...] was crying, I really didn't hear any of it.

2500|$|His {{character}} in A View to a Kill was parodied in a sketch titled [...] "Lease with an Option to Kill", {{in which he}} reprised his role as Max Zorin. Zorin, who had taken on some qualities of other notable Bond villains (Blofeld's cat and suit, Emilio Largo's eye patch), was upset that <b>everything</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> wrong for him. His lair was still under construction; his henchmen had jump suits that didn't fit; and his shark tank lacked sharks, having a giant sea sponge instead. A captive James Bond, portrayed by Phil Hartman, offered to get Zorin [...] "a good deal" [...] on the abandoned Blofeld volcanic lair if Zorin let him go, to which he reluctantly agreed.|$|E
2500|$|After {{three years}} of winning their first title, [...] "La Mecha" [...] was heading towards their second one. It was a cold and grey morning that day in Bogotá, where the team faced Millonarios. With noise and an old bus, América de Cali arrived to the stadium Nemesio Camacho (El Campín). Caleños that {{lived in the city}} came to support the team as well as many fans {{arriving}} from Cali. Millonarios came out with their full attack, but América de Cali played with tranquility and soon enough the first goal came As they kept a close watch on the other games being played that day, América de Cali withstood the constant attack of Millonarios. Time took an important role and as it ran down, it only benefited América de Cali. Deportes Tolima had won their match, Deportivo Pereira were tying their match, and Nacional had scored their second goal. <b>Everything</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> their way and the only thing left to do was win the game against Millonarios. The final minutes were very tense, but once the referee blew the whistle, the fans were able to chant once more, [...] "América Campeon".|$|E
2500|$|The {{divergence}} of and {{distinction between}} {{film and video}} games is one of Cecil's pet subjects, and his interest in cinematic techniques and technical developments would become manifest in Revolution's upcoming titles. He started to hire external talent from the TV and film trades for the big-budget production [...] (1996). Already {{in the next year}} the sequel, , was released. By the end of the nineties, when the adventure market changed, he had to change course as well. In stead of the previous games, that were point-and-click adventures, he chose to move to 3D and direct control with In Cold Blood (2000), a narrative driven adventure game with action elements. At the same time a second title, Gold and Glory: The Road to El Dorado (2000), was developed after DreamWorks's film The Road to El Dorado. As Broken Sword was originally intended to be a trilogy, a third episode was planned. Unlike In Cold Blood, that combined 3D characters with pre-rendered graphics, the third Broken Sword game, [...] (2003), became a real-time 3D adventure game, with mild action elements (such as using stealth, climbing, shimmying, and pushing objects). Initially, when he announced that Broken Sword 3 {{was going to be a}} 3D game, it caused an outcry by the fans of the series. Cecil had had no choice to adopt 3D though, for when they needed funding in the beginning of 2000, publishers had become obsessed with the idea that <b>everything</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to be 3D. But he had always been keen to move to 3D, as it allowed more special effects and would make the game world more alive. In the same year, he decided to release Beneath a Steel Sky (and Lure of the Temptress) as freeware and the source code was given to ScummVM. The result was that millions of people played the game for free in a very wide range of devices. It would foreshadow Revolution's bright future. He could have said that as a marketing genius he planned it, but as he stated a few years later, that would have been a dreadful lie. However, some hard years were ahead for the company. Over the years it had grown into about 40 people, but the year after Broken Sword: The Sleeping Dragon one of Revolution's projects was cancelled, and he had no other option than let everyone go.|$|E
