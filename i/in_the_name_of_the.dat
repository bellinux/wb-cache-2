40|$|This article aims {{to examine}} the {{contribution}} of Islamic epistemology in a pluralistic life within increasing social problems that lead to violence <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>of</b> religion. All people agree that the acts <b>of</b> violence <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>of</b> religion was not justified by religions, including Islam. Islam should provide solution {{for the establishment of}} peace, tranquility, and serenity in diversity. Therefore, we should understand Islam as a science, so that the act <b>of</b> violence <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>of</b> religion can be reduced through proper understanding. Pluralistic theology has been studied for long review, although not very deeply. This article, accordingly, describes some key terms <b>in</b> understanding <b>the</b> epistemology of pluralistic theology which is expected to {{contribute to the development of}} science that can give realistic solution to the problem <b>of</b> violence <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>of</b> religion...|$|R
5|$|When {{war broke}} out between France and its rivals, Russian and Austrian forces invaded Switzerland. The Swiss refused to fight {{alongside}} the French <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Helvetic Republic. In 1803 Napoleon organised {{a meeting of the}} leading Swiss politicians from both sides in Paris. The result was the Act of Mediation which largely restored Swiss autonomy and introduced a Confederation of 19 cantons. Henceforth, much of Swiss politics would concern balancing the cantons' tradition of self-rule with the need for a central government.|$|E
5|$|After a long minority, the {{personal}} reign of James V saw the court become a centre of Renaissance patronage, but it ended in military defeat and another long minority for the infant Mary Queen of Scots. Scotland hovered between dominance by the English and French, {{which ended in}} the Treaty of Edinburgh 1560, by which both withdrew their troops, but leaving the way open for religious reform. The Scottish Reformation was strongly influenced by Calvinism leading to widespread iconoclasm {{and the introduction of}} a Presbyterian system of organisation and discipline that would {{have a major impact on}} Scottish life. In 1569 Mary returned from France, but her personal reign deteriorated into murder, scandal and civil war, forcing her to escape to England where she was later executed and leaving her Protestant opponents in power <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> infant James VI. In 1603 he inherited the thrones of England and Ireland, creating a dynastic union and moving the centre of royal patronage and power to London.|$|E

5|$|By 1686, Seringapatam, {{capital of}} the Kingdom of Mysore, was home to a {{community}} of more than 400 Catholics who were severely harassed in the following two decades when their churches were destroyed and the priest's house confiscated. This destruction was undertaken <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Wodeyar king, Kanthirava Narasaraja I by his finance minister. The priest's house was eventually returned to the church in 1709. Sometime between 1700 and 1717, another church was built in Rampura, a suburb of Seringapatam, {{in the face of}} local opposition. During the period of Chikka Devaraja (1673–1704), 400 priests who protested against high taxes were executed; as per a legend, they were strangled by the wrestlers of his court. Relations between the Wodeyars and the Mangalorean Catholics improved until 1717, when an anti-Christian purge led to the expulsion of the resident priest who was thereafter forbidden to preach. Several more anti-Christian demonstrations followed, but by 1736 relations had once more improved between the two groups.|$|E
5|$|By 1909, it {{had spread}} to the Orange River Colony. In South Africa, as at Azusa Street, the {{movement}} was initially multi-racial, appealing to both Boers and blacks. It expanded rapidly among African farm workers in the Orange River Colony and Wakkerstroom, where Pentecostal beliefs in divine healing through prayer {{would have made it}} an attractive alternative to traditional or medical treatment. Lake made contact with the Wakkerstroom Zionists led by Pieter Louis Le Roux, and many Zionists joined the Apostolic Faith Mission. Their influence {{can be seen in the}} AFM's practice of baptism by triple immersion, once each <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit. There was also interaction with other churches, such as the Plymouth Brethren and International Holiness movement, which often resulted in individuals or whole congregations joining the AFM. Most AFM converts, however, came from the Dutch Reformed churches.|$|E
