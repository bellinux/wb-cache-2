40|$|This {{is a study}} {{based on}} {{discourse}} theory in purpose to examine the border-politics of the EU. Since the EU step by step has developed into an area of free movement on capital, people and services, the <b>external</b> <b>frontiers</b> have been given prioritiy on the political scene.

To handle the increasing ammount of (illegal) migration to the EU an independet agency, Frontex, was established 2005 in favour of coordinating the Member States in issues regarding border security. The focal point {{of this study is to}} critically examine the identity of Frontex by using Becks theory of risk combined with the theory of governmentality. By doing so I seek to highlight the relation between Frontex and the EU and also that of Frontex mission in relation to illegal immigration.

First, to show how strategies of bordering and crossbordering do indeed coexist within EU politics toward its neighbouring countries, in order to reflect upon which specific border regime is in the making. Second, our aim is to go beyond the apparently homogeneous and standardized approach that EU is proposing to its neighbouring countries, in order to identify differences among the EU’s discoursive strategies toward its southern vis-à-vis its eastern external border. The object of the analysis will be mainly political texts, produced at different scales: ENP action plans, ENP strategy papers and crossborder cooperation programmes.

The birth of the Schengen area of freedom, security and justice seems to replicate at the regional level the same geo-political dynamic which produced national spaces: a new political and economic trans-national unit is created by drawing a line which at the same time defines the rights of belonging.

40|$|European {{borders are}} {{characterized}} by alternating hard and soft forms on one axis and open and closed forms on another. The border is a networked and fluid process rather than a fixed line; it is constituted in new and changing relations between cores and peripheries, and {{is the site of}} political contestations where power and culture interact. Europe's internal national borders are not merely modified by the growing significance of a European <b>external</b> <b>frontier,</b> but both internal and external borders are influenced by the wider global context.

Borders exist not {{on the edge of the}} territory of the state, but in numerous points within and beyond it. The changing nature of the border has implications for identity, since the system of classifications the border establishes provides identities with a means of distinguishing insiders from outsiders.

By bringing together the perspectives of critical geopolitics, policy studies and border studies, it presents a comprehensive review of the European Neighbourhood Policy and how it impacts the ongoing construction of the EU’s <b>external</b> <b>frontiers.</b> Is the EU committed to promoting integration in a ‘wider’ European space, or is a “fortress Europe” emerging where the strengthening of internal cohesion is coupled with the militarisation of its external borders? The book aims to problematize this question by showing how the EU’s external policies are based on a mixture of openness and closure, inclusion and exclusion, cooperation and securitisation. The European Neighbourhood Policy is a controversial strategy where regionalization and bordering, homogenisations and differentiations, centrifugal and centripetal forces proceed side-by-side, in an explicit attempt to construct a selective, mobile and fragmented border. A specific focus is devoted to the diversity of geo-strategies the EU is pursuing in its neighbouring countries and regions, macro-regional strategies and cross-border cooperation initiatives as new scales of cooperation, and the role of other global players...|$|R

40|$|International audienceTransdisciplinary {{research}} on borders has flourished {{since the late}} 1980 s, but most so called Border Studies focus on social and cultural life in border areas, or {{on the effects of}} frontiers on the experience and perceptions of local populations. In contrast to this now well-established trend in research, studies concerned with the practices and perceptions of professional groups stationed on the border - that is to say, the police - are relatively underdeveloped 1. Police cooperation on borders, as a specific aspect of policing activities, has received little attention by social scientists, as well. The few studies to be found are written by English-language researchers who often prefer to investigate supranational cross-border cooperation policies and the policing schemes such as Interpol in charge of enforcing them, rather than observing local cooperative practices on the borders themselves. For Europe as a whole, {{research on}} border protection is particularly valuable, since border control is central to the EU project : the Schengen Agreement, signed by Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands in 1985, provides for the elimination of border checks within the Schengen area, in exchange for the reinforced control of its outer limits (with provisions made, essentially, by the Convention implementing the agreement, adopted in June 1990). The distinction between internal and external borders then became central to the EU project {{as well as to the}} integration of new member States. The present research project, based on observations made between 2004 and 2007 at the border between Austria and the Czech Republic (an <b>external</b> <b>frontier</b> of the Schengen area at the time), attempted to determine how police border control practices were modified on a Schengen area border destined to become an internal EU border.

40|$|A {{reflection}} on the existential loss experienced by many young persons {{in the aftermath of}} the Euro-zone crisis (often referred to as ‘the lost generation’) must also acknowledge, for the record and for reasons of relative salience, those who have recently drowned in the waters of southern Europe in their quest for a better future. This essay proposes to reconsider, for a moment, the relation between the obstacles that third country nationals (TNCs) encounter at our <b>external</b> <b>frontiers</b> and the increasing permeability of internal EU borders. Normally, one thinks of the two as structurally opposed: within its boundaries, the EU dismantles checkpoints and fosters the bonding of its citizens; but precisely in order to enable the communal experience of insiders, the EU strengthens its external borders and digs an ever deeper chasm between the European self and the TNC other. In contrast to this conceptual frame, this essay characterizes the internal and external EU attitudes as aligned and even chronologically parallel. With Lampedusa as an illustration, these pages posit that a link exists between the lost at sea and the particular juridical discourse that has characterized the EU’s response to the Euro-zone crisis. This discourse, enshrined in primary and secondary legislation as well as judicial opinions, has managed to lock in, bless, and codify the fear – or phobia – of sharing finite resources. It is a discourse that normalizes tragedy and localizes problems, even when, for structural reasons, solutions at the local level are simply non-existent...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis article {{provides}} a locally grounded {{understanding of how}} geographies of sovereignty became established and called into question on the <b>external</b> <b>frontiers</b> of British imperial expansion. The empirical case study focuses on the Bhotiyas, trans-Himalayan traders who reside in several high valleys of the Kumaon Himalaya in today's North Indian state of Uttarakhand. When the British East India Company annexed that region in 1815 it was recognized as a so-called Non-Regulation Province. Through a close examination of British interactions with Kumaon's traders, the paper will reveal the frictions that arose from this exceptional legal status. This focus serves to address the broader question of how sovereign claims work through multiple and shifting articulations. The paper first considers the establishment of Kumaon as a Non-Regulation Province by attending to the strategies of British administrators in gaining the loyalty of its trans-Himalayan traders, particularly after the Dogras' invasion of western Tibet in 1841. Subsequently, attention turns toward the negotiations between colonial administrators, Tibetan authorities and the Bhotiyas over taxation, which highlights British efforts to fit this mountainous periphery into the empire's standard grid during the 1890 s. The analysis considers a previous call to conceive High Asia as a continuous zone and an agentive site of political action by arguing that confluent territories and overlapping sovereignties are key to understanding imperial frontiers. As such the article contributes to scholarship that deals with the anomalous spaces of Britain's Indian empire, including both the jurisdictional and everyday politics in the margins...|$|R

The “hotspot” system, first launched in May 2015, represents the restructuring of mechanisms of capture and identification {{in response to the}} migration “turmoil” at the <b>external</b> <b>frontiers</b> of Europe. On the other hand, transit zones such as the Eidomeni camp at the Greek-Macedonian border or the makeshift self-organized refugee / migrant camp at Calais operate informally as de facto “hotspots. ” What is commonly called “the migrant crisis” or “the refugee crisis” actually reflects the frantic attempt by the EU and European nation-states to control, contain, and govern people’s (“unauthorized”) transnational and inter-continental movements. Naming it a “refugee/migrant crisis” appears to be a device for the authorization of exceptional or “emergency” governmental measures – and then their normalization. The very terms “migrant crisis” and “refugee crisis” tend to personalize “crisis” and relocate “crisis” in the body and person of the figurative migrant / refugee, as if s/he is the carrier of a disease called “crisis,” and thus carries the contagion of “crisis” wherever she may go. The article calls for attention to the new spaces of “transit” opened up by the migrants and refugees themselves, and consequently the ways in which these “irregular” human mobilities have scrambled and re-shuffled the social and political geography of “Europe. ...|$|R
