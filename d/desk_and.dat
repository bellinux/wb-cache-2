5|$|The {{video is}} shot in {{black-and-white}} and {{is set in}} a dimly lit and smoky office, where Beyoncé puts on a private show for a detective (played by actor Brett G. Smith). As the clip begins, the detective is gazing out the window. Beyoncé then arrives and stands in an open doorway while rain pours outside. With wavy hair and winged eyeliner, Beyoncé is dressed in a thigh-length leather trench coat and high stockings. After walking inside the office, she immediately strips off her coat. This reveals a satin dress over black panties and thigh-high pantyhose held up by garters. When the music starts, Beyoncé sits on a <b>desk</b> <b>and</b> plays with her hair, her back facing the face of the detective. The latter leans against his desk while watching Beyoncé, who starts to dance sensually on the <b>desk</b> <b>and</b> flips her hair to seduce him. As Beyoncé dances around the armchair, she exposes her vintage-style underwear.|$|E
40|$|BackgroundSitting on {{inappropriate}} benches, {{as well as}} {{the poor}} posture (body position) during the years of growth, can lead to spinal disorders, fatigue and discomfort in students. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between features of <b>desks</b> <b>and</b> chairs and prevalence of some musculoskeletal disorders in primary school students in Abadan. Materials and MethodsThis cross-sectional study was conducted in 2015 in the city of Abadan- South West of Iran; for which, 383 primary school students were selected and studied through cluster sampling method. Data were collected by the checkered board and researcher-made questionnaire. Features <b>and</b> dimensions of <b>desks</b> <b>and</b> chairs of students were recorded and evaluated based on their condition (being standard or not). Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS, version 22; and then, descriptive statistics and Chi-square test were conducted. ResultsStudy results showed that about 56. 1 % of the <b>desks</b> <b>and</b> chairs in under study schools were non-standard. It found that drooping shoulder (85. 4 %) and scoliosis (81. 7 %) were the more prevalent disorders and back straight (1. 6 %) was the least frequent disorder. There was a significant relationship between the variable of non-standard <b>desks</b> <b>and</b> chairs and prevalence of drooping shoulders (P= 0. 001), scoliosis (P= 0. 04), kyphosis (P= 0. 007) and lordosis (P= 0. 002) disorders in students. ConclusionThe non-standard-sized <b>desks</b> <b>and</b> chairs increase the prevalence of skeletal disorders in schoolchildren. Therefore, it is essential to pay attention to design and build standard classroom <b>desks</b> <b>and</b> chairs, which are best, adjust to students’ physics...|$|R

The <b>desks</b> <b>and</b> chairs are located on four semicircular {{graduated}} platforms. When the Senate moved to its current chamber in 1859, it took the original furniture with it. Many of the original desks remain in use today, including the Daniel Webster <b>and</b> Jefferson Davis <b>desks.</b> The <b>desks</b> <b>and</b> chairs that are in the chamber today are replicas reproduced from a circa 1819 design by the New York City cabinetmaker Thomas Constantine.

5|$|Although Hogg spent {{little time}} at the Varner {{plantation}} after Bayou Bend was constructed, she continued to purchase art and antique furniture on its behalf. In the 1950s, she restored the plantation, and each room was given a different theme from Texas history: colonial times, the Confederacy, Napoleonic times (1818), and the Mexican–American War. One room was dedicated to her father, and contained his <b>desk</b> <b>and</b> chair {{as well as his}} collection of walking sticks. She donated the property to the state, and it was dedicated as the Varner–Hogg Plantation State Historical Site in 1958, the 107th anniversary of Jim Hogg's birth.|$|E

Later, in Washington, D.C., FBI Assistant Director Alvin Kersh (James Pickens, Jr.) assigns Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), along with Agent Peyton Ritter from New York, to the case.

However, Dwight orders a $200 bouquet of flowers for Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer). Dwight then puts a porcupine in his <b>desk</b> <b>and</b> blames Jim. However, a verbal slip-up causes him to inadvertently reveal his intentions. Jim, in retaliation, defaces a picture of his daughter CeCe, and blames Dwight. After Andy says such vandalism is grounds for termination, Jim admits he staged the crime.

Jim assures him he will tell Dwight, but purposefully neglects to do so. Dwight thus continues to pull pranks on himself, to Jim's amusement.|$|E
5|$|The 1891 census {{records the}} Wildes' {{residence}} at 16 Tite Street, {{where he lived}} with his wife Constance and two sons. Wilde though, not content with being better known than ever in London, returned to Paris in October 1891, this time as a respected writer. He was received at the salons littéraires, including the famous mardis of Stéphane Mallarmé, a renowned symbolist poet of the time. Wilde's two plays during the 1880s, Vera; or, The Nihilists and The Duchess of Padua, had not met with much success. He had continued his interest in the theatre and now, after finding his voice in prose, his thoughts turned again to the dramatic form as the biblical iconography of Salome filled his mind. One evening, after discussing depictions of Salome throughout history, he returned to his hotel and noticed a blank copybook lying on the <b>desk,</b> <b>and</b> it occurred to him to write in it what he had been saying. The result was a new play, Salomé, written rapidly and in French.|$|E
