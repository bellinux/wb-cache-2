40|$|The {{formation}} of fullerene crystals represents a major degradation pathway of polymer/fullerene bulk-heterojunction thin films that inexorably deteriorates their photovoltaic performance. Currently no tools exist that reveal {{the origin of}} <b>fullerene</b> <b>crystal</b> formation vertically through the film. Here, we show that electron tomography {{can be used to}} study nucleation and growth of fullerene crystals. A model bulk-heterojunction blend based on a thiophene-quinoxaline copolymer and a fullerene derivative is examined after controlled annealing above the glass transition temperature. We image a number of fullerene nanocrystals, ranging in size from 70 to 400 nanometers, and observe that their center is located close to the free-surface of spin-coated films. The results show that the nucleation of fullerene crystals predominately occurs in {{the upper part of the}} films. Moreover, electron tomography reveals that the nucleation is preceded by more pronounced phase separation of the blend components...|$|E

The (BETS) 2 ·C 60 complex (1) and new radical cation salts {{based on}} bis(ethylenedithio) tetraselenafulvalene (BETS) with the square-planar [Ni(CN) 4] 2 -, [Pt(CN) 4] 2 -anions were synthesized: (BETS) 4 ·Ni(CN) 4 (2), (BETS) 4 ·Pt(CN) 4 (3). The crystal {{structure}} of 1 - 3 is layered. The layers consisting of C 60 molecules are alternated with the layers composed of BETS molecules in 1.

40|$|All carbon materials, e. g., {{amorphous}} carbon (a-C) coatings and $C_{ 60 }$ fullerene thin films, {{play an important}} role in short-wavelength free-electron laser (FEL) research motivated by FEL optics development and prospective nanotechnology applications. Responses of a-C and $C_{ 60 }$ layers to the extreme ultraviolet (SPring- 8 Compact SASESource in Japan) and soft x-ray (free-electron laser in Hamburg) free-electron laser radiation are investigated by Raman spectroscopy, differential interference contrast, and atomic force microscopy.

Low thresholds for ablation of a <b>fullerene</b> <b>crystal</b> (estimated to be around 0. 15 eV/atom for $C_{ 60 }$ vs 0. 9 eV/atom for a-C in terms of the absorbed dose) are caused by a low cohesive energy of fullerene crystals.

40|$|A simple {{technique}} is demonstrated based on UV–vis spectroscopy that permits {{the onset of}} fullerene crystallization to be monitored in polymer:fullerene bulk-heterojunction blends. The growth of <b>fullerene</b> <b>crystals</b> only occurs during thermal annealing above the glass transition temperature (Tg) of the blend.

The resulting material becomes a true metallic one-dimensional crystal, where the conduction states are formed solely by the fullerene chain. At the doping rate of one K atom per C_ 60 molecule, the system shows the density of states at the Fermi level considerably higher than {{in any of the}} <b>fullerene</b> <b>crystals</b> presently made.

40|$|For field-effect-doped fullerenes it was {{reported}} that the superconducting transition temperature Tc is markedly larger for C 60. 2 CHX_ 3 (X=Cl, Br) crystals, than for pure C 60. Initially this was explained by the expansion of the volume per C 60 -molecule and the corresponding increase in the density of states at the Fermi level in the intercalated crystals. On closer examination it has, however, turned out to be unlikely that this is the mechanism behind the increase in Tc. An alternative explanation of the enhanced transition temperatures assumes that the conduction electrons not only couple to the vibrational modes of the C 60 -molecule, but also to the modes of the intercalated molecules. We investigate the possibility of such a coupling. We find that, assuming the ideal bulk structure of the intercalated crystal, both a coupling due to hybridization of the molecular levels, and a coupling via dipole moments should be very small. This suggests that the presence of the gate-oxide in the field-effect-devices strongly affects the structure of the <b>fullerene</b> <b>crystal</b> at the interface.

40|$|Polymer:fullerene bulk-heterojunction {{thin films}} show great promise {{for use as}} active layers in organic solar cells. However, their low thermal {{stability}} is a hindrance that complicates the manufacturing and influences the lifetime of devices. It is thus of high importance to understand what factors that a↵ect the thermal stability of polymer:fullerene blends and explore di↵erent strate- gies to increase the thermal stability. This work is focused on using various electron microscopy techniques to investigate how the nanostructure of poly- mer:fullerene films degrades when exposed to thermal stress and how the ther- mal stability of polymer:fullerene films can be increased. As a model system we have worked with the polymer poly(2, 3 -bis-(3 -octyloxyphenyl) quinoxaline- 5, 8 - diyl-alt-thiophene- 2, 5 -diyl) (TQ 1) and the fullerene derivative (6, 6) -phenyl- C 61 -butric acid methyl ester, (PCBM). One of the degradation pathways for polymer:fullerene films exposed to ther- mal stress is nucleation and growth of fullerene crystals. We have investi- gated the kinetics of <b>fullerene</b> <b>crystal</b> nucleation and growth in TQ 1 :PCBM films, and shown that the formation of fullerene crystals is strongly nucleation limited. We have also explored how transmission electron tomography {{can be used to}} visualize the three dimensional distribution of nucleation sites for fullerene crystals in polymer:fullerene films. The results show for our investi- gated TQ 1 :PCBM films that the fullerene crystals do not start to randomly nucleate in the bulk but have a preference to start nucleating in {{the upper part of the}} films. When it comes to increasing the thermal stability of polymer:fullerene films we have shown that the thermal stability of a TQ 1 :PCBM film can be increased by including additives such as C 60, using mixtures of di↵erenet fullerenes, and exposing a film to electron radiation. By adding C 60 or using mixtures of fullerenes the nucleation and growth rate of PCBM crystals can be influenced, avoiding large micron sized crystals and preserving the photovoltaic perfor- mance of a film. In a simliar way, exposure to electron radiation will quenche the nucleation of fullerene crystals and the nanostructure of a film will remain stable upon thermal exposure, with a greater e↵ect seen for larger doses...|$|E
40|$|Optical spin readout (OSR) in fullerene-based {{systems has}} the {{potential}} to solve the spin readout and scalability challenges in solid-state quantum information processing. While the rich variety of chemical groups that can be linked (covalently or not) to the fullerenes opens the possibility of making large and controlled arrays of qubits, optical methods can be used to measure EPR down to a single spin thanks to the large energy of optical photons compared to the microwave ones. After reviewing {{the state of the art}} of OSR, for which the diamond NV cen- ters constitute the benchmark, we undertake the study of fullerene-based species for OSR. An optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) setup was imple- mented in a commercial EPR spectrometer for this purpose. Each experimental chapter focuses on one of the molecular systems in question: a functionalised C 60 fullerene with a phosphonate group (C 60 -phosphine), porphyrin-fullerene ar- chitectures (weakly, strongly and moderately coupled) and finally erbium-doped trimetallic nitride template (TNT) fullerenes (focusing on ErSc 2 N@C 80). In the C 60 -phosphine system, coherent optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) in the triplet state has been achieved. Since a large variety of organic and organometallic molecules can be attached to it both via the fullerene cage and the phosponate group, this result makes it a very useful template to study OSR molecules chemically linked to a qubit. In the porphyrin based structures, an intermediate coupling case in the form of a trimer-fullerene host-guest complex is found to allow detection of both the porphyrin and fullerene triplet sates by CW ODMR, which makes organo-metallic complexes a possible coupling route for a qubit to an OSR component. In the TNT <b>fullerene,</b> <b>crystal</b> field mixing makes the Er 3 + inaccessible by ODMR. However, optical photons cause a mechanical rearrangement of the en- dohedral cluster which in turns impacts on the observed EPR. In particular, the dynamics of this process have been studied for the first time and hint to- wards diffusion kinetics at low pump power. An orientational selectivity has been discovered by using a polarised pump, and the time dynamics indicate the rearrangement of the matrix via difusion on a free volume around the fullerenes. This shows that the endohedral Er 3 + in ErSc 2 N@C 80 can probe the environment outside the cage. This thesis is not currently available via ORA...|$|E

Spin active metallofullerenes (MFs), Sc@C 82 and La@C 82,/sub>, can be self assembled in 3 D <b>fullerene</b> <b>crystals</b> or inside a carbon nanotube to form peapod structures. Single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) are an architect material to potentially allow the formation of 1 -D spin chains. SWCNTs should be optimised to allow formation of spin chains and free of magnetic catalyst and carbon impurities, which have previously limited investigations of SWCNT spin properties. To address this, SWCNTs produced by laser ablation with a non-magnetic PtRhRe catalyst were purified through a multiple step centrifugation process in order to remove amorphous carbon and catalyst impurities. Centrifugation of SWCNT solutions resulted in sedimentation of carbon nanotube bundles containing clusters of catalyst particles, while isolated nanotubes with reduced catalyst particle content remained in the supernatant. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) signals were detected only for samples which contained catalyst particles, with the ultracentrifuged SWCNTs showing no EPR signal at X-band (9. 4 GHz) and fields ≤ 0. 4 T. Integration of MFs into future devices requires a clear {{understanding of the nature of}} the spin and spin-spin interactions. Evaluating the spin properties of MFs, in both 3 D (crystals) and 1 D (peapods), will identify the spin-spin interactions and the affect of the surrounding SWCNT. Diluting spin active Sc@C 82 and La@C 82 MFs in a diamagnetic C 60 matrix, between 0. 4 % and 100 %, permitted the tuning of the mean fullerene separation and thus interfullerene spin interactions. In dilute concentrations of MFs the hyper ne structure was resolved in EPR and with increasing concentration exchange narrowing was observed as a single narrow EPR peak. Encapsulation of Sc@C 82 MFs, of varying dilutions, into purified SWCNTs allowed formation of highly ordered 1 -D array of metallofullerenes. Changing the spin environment from 3 D crystal to 1 D peapod resulted in the loss of the observed hyperfine structure in EPR. A single narrow peak was observed for Sc@C 82 :C 60 peapods, indicating significant affect of the surrounding SWCNT structure upon the spin interactions of 1 D metallofullerenes.

We have investigated the structures, stabilities, and the electron mobilities of multiply charged clusters of fullerenes, (C 60) nr+ (r= 2 - 5). We found that the (C 60) nr+ cluster ions are weakly bound by van der Waals forces and the electric conductivity is high in strong contrast to the typical characteristics of other van der Waals type clusters and <b>fullerene</b> <b>crystals</b> (fullerite), where the charge is strongly localized. The high charge mobility was rationalized {{within the framework of}} a novel classical static over-the-barrier model for two conducting spheres used to describe multiple charge transfer processes between two neighboring fullerenes in the cluster. The model results showed that electron transfer is possible as soon as the C 60 -C 60 system is charged, consistent with earlier experimental results from slow C 60 q+ + C 60 collisions where an electric contact is established (during the very short interaction time of the collision) between the two molecules at distances outside the binding distance in the C 60 -C 60 system. The present electrostatic model was also used to guide the interpretation of the measured kinetic energy releases in the fragmentation of multiply charged dimers, (C 60) 2 r+ → C 60 r 1 + + C 60 r 2 +. In like manner, we have measured kinetic energy releases in the break-ups of multiply charged monomer fullerene ions with the aid of fragment-ion momentum spectroscopy. This yielded an excellent platform for investigations of the projectile and target dependencies on various intrinsic features such as the ultimate Coulomb stability limits for C 60 r+ and C 70 r+ ions, competition between different reaction pathways, and multi-fragmentation processes. The experimental results for the stability limits for multiply charged fullerenes are discussed in view of recent high level Density Functional Theory calculations of C 60 r+ → C 58 (r- 1) + + C 2 + transition states and our electrostatic model. The Density Functional Theory results are also used to check the validity and limitations of the classical model regarding the description of fragmentation processes, while a comparison with advanced molecular dynamic calculations of Ar 8 ++Na 40 collisions were made for investigating its applicability for charge transfer processes.

40|$|Nanostructured Ni/C 60 thin films, {{produced}} by co-evaporation of Ni and fullerene, {{have been investigated}} by both X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD). X-ray diffraction has shown the co-existence of diffraction specific peaks for the <b>fullerene</b> face-centered cubic <b>crystal</b> structure and diffraction peaks of Ni nanoparticles in the face-centered cubic structure, which are broadened by nanoparticule finite dimensions. Analysis of peak widths shows that the Ni nanocrystallite size ranges from 4. 7 to 19. 2 nm. The XMCD signals for a sample series, preparated on relatively low-temperature substrates during the co-evaporation, {{can be interpreted as}} having distinct contributions due to both bulk and surface Ni atoms. These two kind of atoms are antiferromagnetic coupled. The Ni atoms which are at the interface with the fullerite matrix show an enhanced orbital magnetic moment, while the orbital magnetic moment of Ni atoms in the bulk has very low values, as it can be expected for a crystalline field with a cubic symmetry...|$|R
5000|$|His {{predictions}} with A. L. Ruoff {{about the}} mechanical response of fullerite under high pressure, {{and his work}} with colleagues on the unique solvation phenomena of C60 in various solvent systems, and of synthesis and structural characterization of supergiant <b>fullerenes</b> containing single <b>crystal</b> metal ‘encapsulates’, have demonstrated to the scientific community the novel properties of closed-shell carbon structures. He also co-developed a new in-situ mechanical testing device for measuring the tensile response of bundles of SWCNTs and individual MWCNTs inside of a scanning electron microscope. This work has yielded important insights into the mechanics and tribology of these systems, and suggested the possibility of very low friction linear bearings. [...] Similarly, Ruoff and collaborators {{were the first to}} use solubility parameters to rationalize the solubility of fullerenes, of single-walled nanotubes, and of chemically modified graphenes. Furthermore, Rod is credited with first creating graphene by lithographic patterning to make single crystal graphite micropillars; he and his team achieved thereby single crystal multilayer graphene platelets.|$|R
40|$|The {{calculations}} in {{a majority}} of previous works for the fulleride (AqC- 60) crystals were performed {{within the framework of}} the rigid-lattice model, neglecting the distortion relaxation of the host <b>fullerene</b> (C- 60) <b>crystal</b> caused by the interstitial alkali-metal (A) cations. However, an each cation is a source of a static distortion field, and the resulting field is a superposition of such fields generated by all cations. This is a reason why the host-crystal distortions depend on the A-cations configurations, i. e. on a type of a spatial bulk distribution of interstitial cations. The given paper seeks to find a functional relation between the amplitudes of the doping-induced structure-distortion waves and of static concentration ones. A semiphenomenological model is constructed here within the scope of statistical-thermodynamic treatment and using the lattice-statistics simulation method(*). In this model the effects due to the presence of q solute A cations over available interstices (per unit cell) on the static inherent reorientation and/or displacements of the solvent molecules from the 'average-lattice' sites' as well as on the lattice parameter a of a elastically-anysotropic 'cubic' C- 60 crystal are taken into account...|$|R
40|$|Insertion of a C 2 {{molecule}} (fragment) {{into the}} cavity of a hexagonal belt containing 10 hexagons generates a honeycomb lattice (C 42 H 16) and two hydrocarbons containing {{one and two}} pairs of { 7, 5 } ring pairs. The vibrational frequency analysis reveals that the hydrocarbon having only one { 7, 5 } ring pair behaves as a transition-state-like structure. The generation of the hydrocarbon containing two { 7, 5 } ring pairs {{appears to be an}} innate process compared with the honeycomb lattice when the C 2 fragment is inserted into the vacant space of the hexagonal belt. A very small amount of excitation energy (0. 0108 kcal/mol) is required for the annihilation of a { 7, 5 } ring pair to a { 6, 5 } ring pair. Considering two common frames, the motion of the { 7, 5 } and { 6, 5 } ring pairs are studied. The motion of these ring pairs are found to be so natural that there is an insignificant change in the property-like second-order hyperpolarizability (〈ç〉). The topological defect consisting of a five- and a seven-membered ring pair in a honeycomb lattice has been proposed in order to study the growth process of stable <b>fullerenes</b> and the <b>crystal</b> growth of the graphene tubules. 1 In the past decade there has been a record number of scientific investigations relating to a family of carbon materials possessing sp 2 covalentl...|$|R
40|$|We {{performed}} {{a series of}} hypervelocity impact experiments using carbon-bearing impactors (diamond, graphite, <b>fullerenes,</b> phthalic acid <b>crystals,</b> and Murchison meteorite) into Al plate at velocities between 4. 2 and 6. 1 km/s. These tests were made to do the following: (1) determine the survivability of carbon forms and organize molecules in low hypervelocity impact; (2) characterize carbonaceous impactor residues; and (3) {{determine whether or not}} fullerenes could form from carbonaceous impactors, under our experimental conditions, or survive as impactors. An analytical protocol of field emission SEM imagery, SEM-EDX, laser Raman spectroscopy, single and 2 -stage laser mass spectrometry, and laser induced fluorescence (LIF) found the following: (1) diamonds did not survive impact at 4. 8 km/s, but were transformed into various forms of disordered graphite; (2) intact, well-ordered graphite impactors did survive impact at 5. 9 km/sec, but were only found in the crater bottom centers; the degree of impact-induced disorder in the graphite increases outward (walls, rims, ejecta); (3) phthalic acid crystals were destroyed on impact (at 4. 2 km/s, although a large proportion of phthalic acid molecules did survive impact); (4) fullerenes did not form as products of carbonaceous impactors (5. 9 - 6. 1 km/s, fullerene impactor molecules mostly survived impact at 5. 9 km/s; and (5) two Murchison meteorite samples (launched at 4. 8 and 5. 9 km/s) show preservation of some higher mass polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) compared with the non-impacted sample. Each impactor type shows unique impactor residue morphologies produced at a given impact velocity. An expanded methodology is presented to announce relatively new analytical techniques together with innovative modifications to other methods {{that can be used to}} characterize small impact residues in LDEF craters, in addition to other acquired extraterrestrial samples...|$|R
