40|$|BACKGROUND: Hyponatraemia {{is common}} and its {{differential}} diagnosis and consequent therapy management is challenging. The differential diagnosis is mainly {{based on the}} routine clinical assessment of volume status, which is often misleading. Mid-regional pro-atrial natriuretic peptide (MR-proANP) is associated with extracellular and cardiac <b>fluid</b> <b>volume.</b> METHODS: A total of 227 consecutive patients admitted to the emergency department with profound hypo-osmolar hyponatraemia (Na > 125 mmol L(- 1)) were included in this prospective multicentre observational study conducted in two tertiary centres in Switzerland. A standardized diagnostic evaluation of the underlying cause of hyponatraemia was performed, and an expert panel carefully evaluated volaemic status using clinical criteria. MR-proANP levels were compared between patients with hyponatraemia of different aetiologies and for assessment of volume status. RESULTS: MR-proANP levels were higher in patients with hypervolaemic hyponatraemia {{compared to patients with}} hypovolaemic or euvolaemic hyponatraemia (P = 0. 0002). The area under the curve (AUC) to predict an <b>excess</b> of extracellular <b>fluid</b> <b>volume,</b> compared to euvolaemia, was 0. 73 [95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 62 - 0. 84]. Additionally, in multivariate analysis, MR-proANP remained an independent predictor of <b>excess</b> extracellular <b>fluid</b> <b>volume</b> after adjustment for congestive heart failure (P = 0. 012). MR-proANP predicted the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD) versus hypovolaemic and hypervolaemic hyponatraemia with an AUC of 0. 77 (95 % CI 0. 69 - 0. 84). CONCLUSION: MR-proANP is associated with extracellular <b>fluid</b> <b>volume</b> in patients with hyponatraemia and remains an independent predictor of hypervolaemia after adjustment for congestive heart failure. MR-proANP may be a marker for discrimination between the SIAD and hypovolaemic or hypervolaemic hyponatraemia...|$|R

40|$|Assessment {{of excess}} fluid {{distribution}} in chronic hemodialysis patients using bioimpedance spectroscopy. Sodium and water homeostasis is abnormal in hemodialysis (HD) patients, however, {{the distribution of}} the excess fluid (extracellular vs. intracellular) has not been fully characterized. We studied the distribution of fluid using bioimpedance spectroscopy to determine if HD patients have an excess of fluid in any specific compartment relative to controls. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry was used to measure lean body mass and bone mineral content. The resistive index (RI) for extracellular water volume (RIECW), was significantly increased in patients pre-HD when corrected for bone mineral content (RIECW:BMC) (pre-HD, 19. 0 ± 3. 3; controls, 15. 8 ± 1. 7 cm 2 -ohms− 1 -kg− 1; P < 0. 01). This value decreased to the control range following HD (15. 2 ± 2. 5 cm 2 -ohms− 1 -kg− 1). The intracellular water volume to bone mineral content (RIICW:BMC) was not different between controls and HD patients. These data suggest that hemodialysis patients carry their <b>excess</b> <b>fluid</b> <b>volume</b> primarily in the extracellular compartment and that bioimpedance spectroscopy coupled with a stable measure of lean tissue such as bone mineral content can determine the degree of relative excess hydration...|$|E

40|$|A pleural {{effusion}} is <b>excess</b> <b>fluid</b> that collects in the pleural cavity, the fluid-filled space {{that surrounds the}} lungs. Surplus amounts of such fluid can impair breathing by limiting {{the expansion of the}} lungs during inhalation and can cause severe chest pain. Measuring the <b>fluid</b> <b>volume</b> is indicative of the effectiveness of any treatment but, due to the similarity to surrounding regions, fragments of collapsed lung present and topological changes; accurate quantification of the effusion volume is a highly challenging imaging problem. A novel technique is presented that segments the structures of the inner thoracic cage, fits 2 D closed curves to the detected pleural cavity features and propagates the curves transversely. Missing structure is interpolated using adjacent slices and orthogonal planes to correctly approximate the pleura. An adaptive slice-by-slice region growth procedure constrained by the bounding curves then extracts the pleural <b>fluid</b> <b>volume.</b> The applicability of the technique is analysed on two concurrent test samples totalling 35 {{pleural effusion}} patients. A strong correlation was observed between the pleural <b>fluid</b> <b>volume</b> obtained computationally and manually by a radiologist (R^ 2 = 0. 94). The mean pleural <b>fluid</b> <b>volume</b> for the semi-automated approach was 482. 54 mL (Â± 518. 32 mL) compared with 485. 9 mL (Â± 532. 8 mL) for the manual segmentation.

Running title: Filtration under nonsteady pressure Alberding: Filtration under nonsteady pressure H- 01059 - 2003 2 Convective fluid motion through artery walls aids in transvascular transport of macromolecules. Although many measurements of convective filtration have been reported, {{they were all}} obtained under constant transmural pressure. However, arterial pressure in vivo is pulsatile. Therefore experiments were designed to compare filtration under steady and pulsatile pressure conditions. Rabbit carotid arteries were cannulated and excised from male New Zealand white rabbits anesthetized with pentobarbitol sodium (30 mg/kg iv administered). Hydraulic conductance was measured in cannulated excised rabbit carotid arteries at steady pressure. Next, pulsatile pressure trains were applied within the same vessels, and simultaneously, arterial distension was monitored using Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT). For each pulse train, the volume of fluid lost through filtration was measured (subtracting volume change due to residual distension), and compared to that predicted from steady pressure measurements. At 60 and 80 mmHg baseline pressures, the experimental filtration volumes were significantly increased compared to those predicted for steady pressure (p< 0. 05). Optical Coherence Tomography demonstrated that the <b>excess</b> <b>fluid</b> <b>volume</b> loss was significantly greater than the volume that would be lost through residual distension (p< 0. 05). After 30 seconds {{the magnitude of the}} excess of fluid loss was reduced. These results suggest that sudden onset of pulsatile pressure may cause changes in arterial interstitial hydration...|$|E
40|$|Objective: to {{evaluate}} the clinical significance of risk factors of acute lung injury (ALI) in cancer patients who have experienced acute excessive intraoperative blood loss (AEIBL), hemorrhagic shock (HS), and acute disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and massive infusion-transfusion therapy. Subjects and methods. Operative days were analyzed in patients from three groups who had sustained AEIBL of 100 to 550 % of the circulating blood volume. Group 1 consisted of 14 patients who had experienced HS or HS + acute DIC after extensive intraperitoneal surgical interventions. Group 2 comprised 16 patients who had undergone extensive surgical interventions involving extended thoracic lymph dissection. Group 3 included 15 patients after extensive intraperitoneal surgical interventions. Patients with evolved ALI were identified in each group. In all the patients, an excess (balance) of fluid and oncotic pressure were detected {{at the end of}} operative days. Results. There were 4 patients (2 with ALI and 2 with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)) in Group 1 and 11 patients (2 with ALI and 9 with ARDS) in Group 2. Patients with ALI were not identified in Group 3. At the end of operative days, the excess of fluid turned out to double in patients with evolved ALI/ARDS than in those without signs of respiratory failure. Conclusion. Of the greatest significance in the natural history of ALI in this cohort of patients are the following risk factors: surgical injury and extended thoracic lymph dissection; HS, with cardiovasotonics being used for more than 8 hours; excess fluid accumulation by the end of operative days. The safe <b>excess</b> <b>fluid</b> <b>volume</b> was determined, which was not greater than 50 ml/kg in the patients who had undergone peritoneal surgery and even experienced HS, but with cardiovasotonics being administered for not more than 4 hours.

40|$|Introduction. Continuous {{ambulatory}} {{peritoneal dialysis}} (CAPD) {{is effective in}} reducing blood pressure. Mean arterial pressure falls within 6 months of starting CAPD {{in the majority of}} patients. This improved blood pressure control reflects removal of <b>excess</b> <b>fluid</b> <b>volume</b> and body sodium. However, after several years, there is a decline in the efficacy of CAPD in controlling blood pressure. High incidence of hypertension in long-term CAPD patients may be related to hypervolemia as a consequence of loss of residual renal function (RRF), loss of ultrafiltration (UF) due to functional or structural changes in the peritoneal membrane, to a more liberated intake of sodium and fluid, or to administration of erythropoietin. The aim {{of the present study was}} to compare the efficacy in blood pressure control in peritoneal dialysis patients depending on the dialysis modality and duration, RRF and dialysis adequacy. Material and methods. This study was a retrospective analysis of 67 patients who attended our Clinic monthly in 2003. All patients received antihy­pertensive therapy (monotherapy- 16 pts, two drugs- 27 pts, three drugs- 22 pts and four- 2 pts.). Results. The prevalence of hypertension (TA > 140 / 90 mmHg) was 73. 13 %. Most of them (50. 75 %) had mild hypertension (mean value TA < 160 / 100 mmHg). There was no statistically significant difference in hypertension prevalence between diabetic (78. 27 %) and non-diabetic patients (75 %). The prevalence of hypertension in patients with residual diuresis of more than 1000 ml was 36. 6 %, but there were 80. 64 % patients with residual diuresis less than 500 ml. A statistically significant negative correlation was found between D/DO, UF volume and systolic blood pressure and RRF, D/DO and Ccr and diastolic blood pressure. A statistially significant positive correlation was found between age, body weight, duration of dialysis and systolic blood pressure and age and diastolic blood pressure. Conclusion. We can conclude that duration of PD treatment has a negative effect on blood pressure control. Residual renal function plays an important role in volume and blood pressure control. High and high average transporters are the two groups of patients at increased risk of developing hypertension, especially if they are anuric. ...|$|E
