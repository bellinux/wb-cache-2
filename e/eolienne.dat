All windmills have a rotor, {{whether it is the}} sails on a traditional windmill or the blades of a modern wind turbine.

25|$|The <b>Éolienne</b> Bollée was {{designed}} to be constructed in a modular form, thus allowing éoliennes of various sizes to be built. The tower could be a standard pylon type, either of triangular or square plan, or a cast-iron column with an external spiral staircase. The éoliennes built with this type of tower have a very distinctive appearance. The actual turbine itself consists of two rings, the first being the stator and the second being the rotor. The stator has more blades than the rotor. A new device added to the 1885 patent was a funnel affixed to the stator, enabling the <b>éolienne</b> to capture wind from a larger area than the rotor, and increasing its speed through the turbine. A small fantail operated upwind of the rotor, and through a system of gears turned the turbine to face the wind. Also, through a counterweight system, it turned the turbine out of wind as the wind speed increased, thus preventing damage in very strong winds, when the <b>éolienne</b> would be edge on into the prevailing wind.|$|E

2500|$|Ernest Sylvain Bollée (19 July 1814 – 1891) and Auguste Sylvain Bollée (1847–1906) {{took out}} the {{original}} patent No. 79985 in 1868 for a [...] "hydraulic wind engine". Ernest Bollée {{described himself as a}} hydraulic engineer in Le Mans, Sarthe. During the 1860s, due to poor health, Ernest delegated control of the three parts of his business to each of his sons. Auguste was given control of the wind engine manufacturing side of the business. The patent of 1885, with the improvements, is No.167726. In 1898 Auguste sold the business to Édouard-Émile Lebert. Auguste is estimated to have made about 260 <b>Éoliennes.</b> Lebert passed the business to Gaston Duplay in 1918 and on 1 January 1926 the business passed to the Société Anonyme des <b>Éoliennes</b> Bollée (SAEB). SAEB erected at least three [...] <b>éoliennes.</b> Operations seem to have ceased around 1931.|$|R
25|$|Some éoliennes have survived. In France, {{the oldest}} {{surviving}} <b>éolienne</b> {{is at the}} Bollée bell foundry in Saint-Jean-de-Braye, near Orléans. One is preserved in working order at Épuisay, Loir-et-Cher, and another at the Bollée museum in Orléans. A few have been restored to working order.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Éolienne</b> Bollée is {{an unusual}} wind turbine, unique for having a stator and a rotor, as a water turbine has. The eponymous {{invention}} was first patented in 1868 by Ernest Sylvain Bollée in France. A further patent dated 1885 differed mainly in two ways: First, in how the turbine was {{turned to face the}} wind and second, in an improvement which increased the flow of wind through the turbine was added. The turbines built according to the 1885 patent were commercially successful.|$|E

In January 2016, Judge Marc St-Pierre accepts the request and orders Maillé to transmit the data and private information about her research participants to the company's lawyers. However, as is it generally the case in academic research, the participants privacy was a condition to their participation in the research project. In order to avoid being forced to divulge her data, she withdraws her participation as an expert witness in the lawsuit. Despite her withdrawal, in March 2016, Dr Maillé receives a formal notice from the court ordering her to submit her data within five days. She asks Judge St-Pierre to review his judgement. If maintained, the researcher will either have to break the confidentiality agreement she made with her research participants, or expose herself to a lawsuit for contempt of court.|$|R
