5|$|<b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> the 19th century {{until the}} early part of the 1970s, coal was mined in the eastern portion of the Catawissa Creek watershed.

Five drainage tunnels were built in the watershed in the 1930s, and they still discharge acid mine drainage in the 21st century. Strip mining has occurred in parts of the watershed, mainly the Catawissa Creek headwaters and the Little Tomhicken Creek sub-watershed.|$|E

5|$|Due to New Mexico's {{position}} in the southwestern United States, there are three primary causes for flooding within {{the state in the}} autumn months: the effects of tropical cyclones, the North American Monsoon, or an approaching cold front. Tropical cyclones and they're from both the Atlantic and Pacific oceans affect the state, usually in southern New Mexico. Storms that originate from the Atlantic Ocean usually move through the Gulf of Mexico on a northwest trajectory, typically during the month of September. Tropical cyclones from the eastern Pacific usually maintain a fast north-northeast track, occasionally through the Gulf of California, and generally affect the state <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> September to the middle of October. The accompanying moisture of the Pacific storms encounter the mountains of the state, and through orographic lift, produce heavy rainfall. Due to the storms' fast movement, the rainfall events accompanying Pacific storms are generally shorter lasting and more concentrated than other such storms in the state.|$|E
5|$|<b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> 1861, Định's Gò Công guerrillas {{focused on}} three objectives: {{to disrupt the}} newly created French bureaucracy, to disrupt their {{military}} outposts and to disrupt the transport of rice to Cholon, the main commercial hub of southern Vietnam. The first major attack against the French administration in the area targeted the Gò Công district office on June 22, 1861. At 05:00, 600 rebels {{under the command of}} Do Dinh Thoai stormed the military post in the town, engaging the French troops in hand-to-hand combat with lances, bayonets, knives and bamboo sticks. The French were surprised by the attack, losing one soldier and having 100 wounded. By the time reinforcements and naval cover had arrived from Mỹ Tho, Định's men had fled. Thoai—who had been the district chief until the French invasion—was among the 14 killed.|$|E
5|$|<b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> the 16th {{century the}} Dominican Order had been tasked with the {{peaceful}} {{conversion of the}} Ch'ol of Verapaz and southern Petén, and their concentration into new colonial towns. The Itza became fearful that the newly converted Manche Ch'ol would lead the Spanish to Nojpetén. In 1628 the towns of the Manche Ch'ol were placed under {{the administration of the}} governor of Verapaz, with Dominican friar Francisco Morán as their ecclesiastical head. Morán favoured a more robust approach to the conversion of the Manche and moved Spanish soldiers into the region to protect against raids from the Itza to the north. The new Spanish garrison in an area that had not previously seen a heavy Spanish military presence provoked the Manche to revolt, which was followed by abandonment of the indigenous settlements. The Itza, worried about the southern approaches to their territory, may have instigated a Manche rebellion that took place in Lent 1633.|$|E

The complex of buildings was scheduled as an ancient monument in May 1951, and the former chantry house was listed as a Grade I building in April 1961. At the same time, the other buildings on site were listed as Grade II buildings: the gateway and wall, three barns (one of which is ruined), a ruined outbuilding and a dovecote.|$|E
5|$|In {{her next}} title defense on August 29, 2008, Kentikian met Hager Finer of Israel, Halmich's last {{opponent}} before retiring. Following a close opening round, the boxing match {{turned into a}} brawl and Finer scored {{during the first half}} of the fight. From round five onwards, Kentikian managed to take over the bout by landing the cleaner punches and she won by unanimous decision. On December 5, 2008, Kentikian faced Anastasia Toktaulova of Russia, the reigning GBU Flyweight Champion, although the GBU title was not on the line. During the uncharacteristic tactical fight, Kentikian managed to control her opponent <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> the ring in most of the rounds.

5|$|It {{had been}} {{expected}} that use of the chutes to transfer salt between the canal and the river would cease once the lift was opened, but {{by the turn of}} the 19th century, although there were 190,000 tons of cargo using the lift each year, 38,000 tons of salt were still being transferred by chute. <b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> the 19th century, some of the salt traffic transferred to the railways, and the use of pipelines through which the brine was pumped also affected trade, but as that source of revenue declined, a chemical industry developed in the area around Northwich, which became the major source of income for the Navigation.|$|E

5|$|Roman baths {{played a}} leading role in the {{development}} of domed construction in general, and monumental domes in particular. Modest domes in baths dating from the 2nd and 1st centuries BC are seen in Pompeii, in the cold rooms of the Terme Stabiane and the Terme del Foro. These domes are very conical in shape, similar to those on an Assyrian bas-relief found in Nineveh. At a Roman era tepidarium in Cabrera de Mar, Spain, a dome has been identified <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> the 2nd century BC that used a refined version of the parallel arch construction found in an earlier Hellenistic bath dome in Sicily. According to Vitruvius, the temperature and humidity of domed warm rooms could be regulated by raising or lowering bronze discs located under an oculus. Domes were particularly well suited to the hot rooms of baths circular in plan to facilitate even heating from the walls. However, the extensive use of domes did not occur before the 1st century AD.|$|E

5|$|The {{sources for}} Áedán's life include Bede's Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum; Irish annals, principally the Annals of Ulster and the Annals of Tigernach; and Adomnán's Life of Saint Columba. The Senchus fer n-Alban, a census and {{genealogy}} of Dál Riata, purports to record his ancestry {{and that of}} his immediate descendants. None of these sources are contemporary. Adomnán's work was written in the very late 7th century, probably to mark the centenary of Columba's death. It incorporates elements from a lost earlier life of Columba, De virtutibus sancti Columbae, by Cumméne Find. This may have been written as early as 640; neither the elements incorporated from Cumméne's work nor Adomnán's own writings can be treated as simple history. Bede's history was written 30 years after Adomnán's. The surviving Irish annals contain elements of a chronicle kept at Iona <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> the 7th century onwards, so that these too are retrospective when dealing with Áedán's time.|$|E
