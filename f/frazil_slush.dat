40|$|In this paper, <b>Frazil</b> <b>slush</b> {{variation}} {{mechanism and}} {{a method of}} <b>frazil</b> <b>slush</b> variation estimation on ice-covered river are studied. This study did develop a <b>frazil</b> <b>slush</b> generation, transport and accumulation calculation model. The continuous input values of this model are air temperature, wind velocity, sunshine duration, snowfall depth and water level. We carried out field observation of <b>frazil</b> <b>slush</b> accumulation using the ADCP and the SWIP. It was shown that the calculation model built by this study can reproduce the <b>frazil</b> <b>slush</b> variation of the real river. The increase of <b>frazil</b> <b>slush</b> transport, the increase of <b>frazil</b> <b>slush</b> generation and the upstream <b>frazil</b> <b>slush</b> accumulation volume are important values when considering <b>frazil</b> <b>slush</b> blockage of water intakes...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to clarify the <b>frazil</b> <b>slush</b> {{generation}} mechanism on ice-covered rivers. This study developed a <b>frazil</b> <b>slush</b> generation calculation model which targeted skim ice, frazil ice, snow fall and anchor ice. The input values for this model were air temperature, wind velocity, sunshine duration, snow-fall depth, water depth of river, flow velocity of river and latitude. We carried out field observations at a location where <b>frazil</b> <b>slush</b> floats on the water surface, recording data with a camera. It was shown that the calculation model generated by this study can reproduce the <b>frazil</b> <b>slush</b> generation of the real river. It was also found that rising air temperature, an increase in <b>frazil</b> <b>slush</b> thickness and falling upstream water levels are important factors in predicting the occurrence of water intake blockage caused by <b>frazil</b> <b>slush...</b>|$|E
40|$|In December 2014, an ice jam {{occurred}} on the Osobetsu River after a snowstorm. This study investigated {{factors that contribute to}} increases in <b>frazil</b> <b>slush</b> and identified locations prone to ice jams. Previous studies using a hydraulic model experiment showed that an ice sheet’s Froude number become small where ice sheets are static or accumulated. Moreover, a <b>frazil</b> <b>slush</b> calculation model that is based on the theory of heat balance in stream water accurately reproduced the measured thickness of <b>frazil</b> <b>slush.</b> However, no previous studies on ice jams have taken into account the Froude numbers of ice sheets. Also, certain weather phenomena, such as snowstorms and avalanches, are not factored into the current model for calculating <b>frazil</b> <b>slush</b> thickness. Therefore, the authors developed the model such as {{to take into account the}} effect of snowstorms. Furthermore, we used the Froude number of the ice sheet to identify potential ice jam locations on the Osobetsu River...|$|E
50|$|In 1807 an ice jam formed below Bangor Village {{raising the}} water 10 to 12 {{feet above the}} normal {{highwater}} mark and in 1887 the freshet caused the Maine Central Railroad Company rails between Bangor and Vanceboro to be covered {{to a depth of}} several feet. Bangor’s worst ice jam floods occurred in 1846 and 1902. Both resulted from mid-December freshets that cleared the upper river of ice, followed by cold that produced large volumes of <b>frazil</b> ice or <b>slush</b> which was carried by high flows forming a major ice jam in the lower river. In March of both years, a dynamic breakup of ice ran into the jam and flooded downtown Bangor. Though no lives were lost and the city recovered quickly, the 1846 and 1902 ice jam floods were economically devastating, according to the Army Corps analysis. Both floods occurred with multiple dams in place and little to no ice-breaking in the lower river. The United States Coast Guard began icebreaker operations on the Penobscot in the 1940s, preventing the formation of frozen ice jams during the winter and providing an unobstructed path for ice-out in the spring. Long-term temperature records show a gradual warming since 1894, which may have reduced the ice jam flood potential at Bangor.|$|R
40|$|An {{interpretation}} key, {{similar to}} those previously developed for use with aerial photography and other remotely sensed data, was developed for L-band (25 cm) radar imagery collected over the Arctic Ocean. Data from April, August, and October were considered. The procedure for developing a valid interpretation key for operation use involves substituting time for space. Open water situations (polynyas, leads, flaws), examples of unconsolidated ice (<b>frazil,</b> <b>slush,</b> brash), thin ice (nilas), and annual ice (first year, multi-year ice) situations are examined. It is suggested that the interpretation key will enhance the use of side looking airborne radar data in the qualitative photo interpretation mode...|$|E
40|$|A thermal ice growth {{model was}} {{developed}} for a 300 km reach of river allowing for the determination for when {{it was safe to}} resume normal hydro operations. The model takes into account insulation from snow and the presence of <b>frazil</b> <b>slush</b> below the solid thermal layer. The model keeps tract of the snow accumulation and thermal ice growth based on the date of first ice formation at each location. Three years of thermal ice growth and snow survey data were used to calibrate the model. Measured and calculated thermal ice thickness values for ice jam events were used {{to come up with a}} critical thermal ice thickness value for which normal hydro operations could be safely resumed. The model was applied to 25 years of historical data and suggested that normal hydro operations could be resumed 12 days earlier on average than what historically occurred without causing an increase in the risk of flooding...|$|E
40|$|The {{presence}} on Bistriţa River, in identical climatic conditions, of sectors with well-developed ice formations {{in the immediate}} vicinity of river sectors lacking or with weakly developed such formations demonstrates the existence of other factors beside the meteorological and hydrological ones that may influence the evolution of freezing processes and implicitly of ice jams. A special role is held by the hydraulic exchange relations established between the river and the aquifers (Ciaglic, 1965; Ciaglic and Vornicu, 1973), the mentioned phenomena having a characteristic evolution, sometimes manifested through the total lack of ice due to underground input (Gaman, 2014). River alimentation from underground waters takes place in two situations: a) nearby well-developed alluvial fans close to floodplain or terraces; b) in areas where the river suddenly changes direction from flowing along one of the banks to an almost perpendicular position towards the valley, or where it meanders in the floodplain. The sectors of the river with areas of free water are those generating ice crystals and river-bottom ice and finally <b>frazil</b> <b>slush.</b> In the areas where the river loses water through infiltration in the floodplain, ice formations are much stronger according to the volume of water losses, and total freezing can be recorded. Field observations and measurements conducted in the winters of 2011 - 2012, 2012 - 2013, regarding the evolution of freeze phenomena, respectively ice jam formation, on Bistriţa River confirm the mentioned theory...|$|E
40|$|The {{current work}} {{provides}} {{a description of}} the ice jam phenomena along the river of Bistrita, which has the longest mountainous course in Romania (216 km). During the cold season of the year, in the upstream of the Izvoru Muntelui Reservoir over a length of 25 - 30 km, there are generated with a almost yearly frequency ice blocks accumulations known as ice jams. Analysis of the hidroclimatical and morphological conditions of the river bed has revealed that they are favorable to formation of ice jam provided there is present a certain combination of their temporal variations. Hidraulic geometry of the Bistrita river bed is favorable to flow of <b>frazil</b> <b>slush,</b> frazil pans and ice floes while the air temperature is - 7 oC as long as the level of Izvoru Muntelui Reservoir is below 500 m. Over this level, the river bed is blocked with ice jam during the submerse phase of the lake and this blockage advances upstream with velocities of several hudreds of meters per day. The most dramatic phenomena has been recorded during the winter of 2002 - 2003 when the thickness of the ice was of 6 meters and it caused floods that provoked damages and claimed human lives. Aparition in 2003 of the Topoliceni Reservoir, placed 6 km upstream of the Izvoru Muntelui Reservoir, has complicated the evolution of the phenomena, the lake itself acting as an accumulation pool for the ices in the upstream. </p...|$|E
40|$|The winter {{regime of}} the Peace River in {{northern}} British Columbia and Alberta is a determining {{factor for the}} operation of BC Hydro's Williston Reservoir. Therefore, several Fine Beam RADARSAT- 1 SAR satellite images were acquired in winter / spring 2000 and 2001, and analyzed for ice types and ice-front locations. Video footage of the ice conditions on the Peace River was obtained from aerial ice observations that were conducted simultaneously with the image acquisitions. The analysis of the images was done 1) visually and 2) using an Unsupervised Fuzzy K-means Classification. By visually analyzing the images, several river ice features could be identified, including frazil pans, frazil floes, shore ice composed of <b>frazil</b> <b>slush,</b> melting ice, and brash. Juxtaposed and secondary consolidated ice could be distinguished relative from each other. Under most conditions encountered in this study, {{the location of the}} ice front coincided {{with the head of the}} complete ice cover, and was, therefore, discernible from the SAR images. Ambiguities arose from open water and freeze-over border ice. By comparison, the Unsupervised Classification broke the data into four classes, which represent river signatures ranging from open water to ice with a strong radar return. No physically existing ice types could be assigned to the three categories representing ice features. However, the spatial distribution of ice features closely matches the visible ice types on the river. User interpretation is required to derive ice types from the classification maps. This study suggests that the visual analysis of SAR imagery is very powerful for river ice type classifications, but that more effort needs to be made to further develop automated river ice classification techniques. 1...|$|E
