Numerical results for both laminar and turbulent flows are compared with the available experimental data and numerical results in the literature. For the laminar flow test case, the head variation shows good agreement with the experimental data. Comparisons for turbulent test case show that the RNG k-ε model somewhat over-predicts the head variation.

The pressure transients that occur during priming of feed lines are very important in the design and analysis of liquid propulsion systems. During the start-up of the propulsion system of a spacecraft, the process of filling of an evacuated pipeline is called priming. Priming can generate severe pressure peaks due to the slam (water hammer) of the propellant against a closed thruster valve. The downstream conditions strongly affect the pressure surge. In space systems, satellites, or interplanetary probes, the propellant lines are vacuum-pumped or filled with low pressure helium or nitrogen before the launch.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} focused {{attention}} on one-dimensional models for fast transient flows in a kinematic non-equilibrium. Besides the thermodynamic non-equilibrium, there is another type of non-equilibrium: the kinematic non-equilibrium, or drift between the phases. Such flow models include bubbly gas/liquid flows which are characterized by strong coupling between the phases, due to the rapid interphase transfers of mass, momentum and energy. As a consequence the assumptions that the phase pressures and the phase temperatures are equal at any cross-section appear consistent with experimental observations. The set of equations includes a momentum equation which has {{the form of a}} relaxation law of the drift velocity. This equation is based on a simplified version of the so-called Voinov - Berne equation for the momentum of the gas in a bubbly flow. The ability of the model to predict steady state critical flows is tested first. This is done by means of an analysis of the sensitivity to variations of the main parameters, and also by comparing the results with two sets of original experimental data on air-water critical flows.

40|$|The {{start-up}} of {{rocket engine}} turbopumps is generally performed {{only in a}} few seconds. It implies that these pumps reach their nominal operating conditions {{after only a few}} rotations. During these first rotations of the blades, the flow evolution in the pump is governed by transient phenomena, based mainly on the flow rate and rotation speed evolution. These phenomena progressively become negligible when the steady behavior is reached. The pump transient behavior induces significant pressure fluctuations which may result in partial flow vaporization, i. e. cavitation. An existing experimental test rig has been updated in the LML laboratory (Lille, France) for the start-ups of a centrifugal pump. The study focuses on cavitation induced during the pump start-up. Instantaneous measurement of torque, flow rate, inlet and outlet unsteady pressures, and pump rotation velocity enable to characterize the pump behavior during rapid starting periods. Three different types of fast start-up behaviors have been identified. According to the final operating point, the start-up is characterized either by a single drop of the delivery static pressure, by several low-frequency drops, or by a water <b>hammer</b> <b>phenomenon</b> that can be observed both a the inlet and outlet of the pump.

40|$|Further {{development}} {{of oil and}} gas resources includes moving petroleum operations into areas of deeper water depths. As the operation moves into these challenging regions, the pressure loss in return lines increase. Earlier, this was solved by venting hydraulic fluid into the sea. Today, this alternative is normally not accepted as governed organisations desire a zero exhaust policy to the Norwegian Sea. From this environmental point of view, many operators require a return conduit to surface. (1) Thus, alternative solutions must be considered to stay within industry requirement for the operation of BOP functions. Subsea BOP is one of the two required pressure barriers in subsea drilling and intervention operations. The BOP control system aims to operate large BOP functions as fast as possible, which includes rapid changes in the control fluid flow rate, i. e. by activation of subsea valves. These changes in flow rate result in a potential risk of water hammer generation in selected parts of the control system. This thesis presents basic theory and description of different BOP control systems performances, and explains the principles of the water <b>hammer</b> <b>phenomenon.</b> Special attention has been given to problems related to the requirement of zero exhaust to sea and the effect of water hammer in pipeline systems. Further, the report includes the use of a software program, FLOWMASTER V 7, in order to perform a complete sensitivity analysis of water hammer in pipeline systems. Water hammer is high pressure shock waves that are developed due to sudden change of flow. The magnitude of water hammer is affected by parameters such as the inner diameter of the pipeline, the elastic properties of the pipe, length of the pipe, etc. The effects of these parameters have been investigated to provide a general understanding of potential mitigating measures from a water hammer point of view. FLOWMASTER V 7 is also used for a study on pressure losses generated in return conduits and the effects this pressure loss has on the exhaust rate of control fluid. The three scenarios that where investigated include direct exhaust to sea, direct exhaust to surface via a return conduit, and exhaust of control fluid via a return line with connection to a subsea accumulator bank. The simulation results showed that the demand of zero exhaust to sea increases the response time for BOP functions. Moreover, that the implementation of an accumulator on the return line reduces the exhaust rate compared to direct exhaust to surface. Another important observation made from the simulations is that the water <b>hammer</b> <b>phenomenon</b> can be expected in the return line when no accumulator is connected to the return conduit. Water hammer pressures in pipelines under great water depths can result in potential dangerous failures, as a negative initial pressure spike in combination with the ambient pressure can result is collapsing hoses and ruptured fixtures. </p...|$|R

Industry requires to affront frequent flow interruptions in pipe systems due to the closing of valves or stopping of pumping equipment. This phenomenon can initiate serious damages like destruction of the pipe system involving leakage of the working fluid to the environment. If the system operates in a fragile environment, as in cold regions, concern {{about the consequences of}} leakage increases due to the variation of physical properties of fluid as well as the pipe material {{as a function of the}} temperature. Water hammer effects can be controlled focusing efforts on reducing the pressure increment that takes place once the phenomenon is presented.

The combination of these elements with the Onera pressure vessel and vacuum system enables to build a facility close to the VKI one used for similitude fluids.

40|$|Abstract: In {{the present}} paper, {{the effect of}} the Net Positive Suction Head (NPSH) for the {{centrifugal}} pump in a simple pipeline system has been carried out eliminating water hammer. Both the experimental tests and numerical calculations were performed in this study to investigate the transient flow effects when the discharges change abruptly in the system. The phenomenon of transient flow is generally occurred when the sudden opening of the downstream valves are used in the pumping station or due to introducing additional parallel branches of pipelines that contain pumps. Experimentally, two operational tests with different NPSH were conducted to show the relations between the head (H) and discharge (Q). The results of these tests showed two different types of H-Q curves. The first test produced a flat H-Q curve when the water surface level in the suction tank was 4 m above the center line of the pump. While in the second test the operational case created a steep H-Q curve when the pump was used to lift 6 m from the suction tank. That is likely happened due to the decrease in a cut-off discharge point. The numerical calculations on hypothec simple pipeline system have been done for the transient flow after determining the shape of the characteristics H-Q curves produced from the experimental tests. The Darcy-Waysbach equation was used to calculate the friction losses and obtain the system resistance curve. The classical method of characteristics, which is based on the methodological analysis of the finite difference method, was executed to propagate the wave pressure in each cases examined.

Investigations of the potential applications of impulse pumping were based on analysis of head, flow rate and efficiency performances for pumping of hydrocarbon fluids. The secondary purpose of the work was to analyse pressure wave propagation and attenuation models in fluid-filled production tubings. Additionally, one dimensional numerical simulation methods were investigated for accurate modelling of pressure transient events in pipelines, such as water <b>hammer</b> <b>phenomena.</b> Pressure wave propagation, transmission and reflection characteristics were first studied. Finite volume methods were also studied for numerical simulation of one-dimensional pressure transient phenomena. Accuracy of pressure wave attenuation models was then analysed using a contradiction method, relying on analysis of numerical simulation tools for pressure transient events. Impulse pumping physical principles were next described using fundamentals of pressure wave propagation. A numerical simulation tool was then developed to reproduce impulse pumping physical principles, using a finite volume numerical scheme. Impulse pumping performances were modelled afterwards in terms of lifting heights, flow rates and efficiency, based on results from the developed numerical simulation tool. Potential applications of impulse pumping in petroleum engineering were then analysed using the performance model. Impulse pumping generates flow from bottomhole to wellhead using pressure waves generated at wellhead. Fluid can be transported from bottomhole to wellhead without theoretical lifting height limitations using impulse pumping. Impulse pumping performances were illustrated and a range of petroleum engineering applications was investigated. Impulse pumping greatest efficiency is obtained for artificial lift of water from shallow wells. Impulse pumping performances depend on pressure wave amplitude, wellhead pressure, lifting height, fluid compressibility and volume occupied in the production tubing.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{experimental}} and numerical analysis of the water <b>hammer</b> <b>phenomenon</b> generated by the discharge of a pressurized liquid into a pipeline kept under vacuum conditions. This flow configuration induces several multiphase phenomena such as cavitation and gas desorption that cannot be ignored in the water hammer behavior. The motivation of this research work comes from the liquid propulsion systems used in spacecrafts, which can undergo fluid hammer effects threatening the system integrity. Fluid hammer can be particularly adverse during the priming phase, which involves the fast opening of an isolation valve to fill the system with liquid propellant. Due to the initial vacuum conditions in the pipeline system, the water hammer taking place during priming may involve multiphase phenomena, such as cavitation and desorption of a non- condensable gas, which may affect the pressure surges produced in the lines. Even though this flow behavior is known, only few studies model the spacecraft hardware configuration, and a proper characterization of the two-phase flow is still missing. The creation of a reliable database and the physical understanding of the water hammer behavior in propulsion systems are mandatory to improve the physical models implemented in the numerical codes used to simulate this flow configuration. For that purpose, an experimental facility modeling a spacecraft propulsion system has been designed, in which the physical phenomena taking place during priming are generated under controlled conditions in the laboratory using inert fluids. An extended experimental campaign {{was performed on the}} installation, aiming at analyzing the effect of various working parameters on the fluid hammer behavior, such as the initial pressure in the line, liquid saturation with the pressurant gas, liquid properties and pipe configuration. The influence of the desorbed gas during water hammer occurrence is found to have a great importance on the whole process, due to the added compressibility and lower speed of sound by an increasing amount of non-condensable gas in the liquid + gas mixture. This results in lower pressure levels and faster pressure peaks attenuation, compared to fluids without desorption. The two-phase flow was characterized by means of flow visualization of the liquid front at the location where the fluid hammer is generated. The front arrival was found to be preceded by a foamy mixture of liquid, vapor and non-condensable gas, and the pressure wave reflected at the tank may induce the liquid column separation at the bottom end. While column separation takes place, the successive pressure peaks are generated by the impact of the column back against the bottom end. The resulting experimental database is then confronted to the predictions of the 1 D numerical code EcosimPro/ESPSS used to assess the propulsion system designs. Simulations are performed with the flow configuration described before, modeling the experimental facility. The comparison of the numerical results against the experimental data shows that aspects such as speed of sound computation with a dissolved gas and friction modeling need to be improved.

The main goal of the project is the prediction of the loads on equipment and support structures. The presented experiments tackle some scenarios typical for power plants and supply material for code validation with regard to the modeling of both thermohydraulic effects and fluid-structure interaction. The test facility Pilot Plant Pipework, representing an approximately 230 m long experimental pipeline, was upgraded in order to allow experiments at system pressures of up to 30 bar at maximum temperatures of about 180 ° C. The test rig was further equipped with a test segment that simulates a piping system and the associated supports typical for a (nuclear) power plant. For a better understanding of thermohydraulic processes during cavitation behind the fast-acting valve, novel instrumentation was applied. Wire-mesh sensors as well as local void probes were equipped with integrated microthermocouples and used for the local instantaneous measurement of both void fractions and fluid temperature. The fast temperature measurement combined with the instantaneous detection of the passage of the gas-liquid interface measurement reveals insights into the condensation heat transfer controlling the speed of the void collapse in the case of a condensational water hammer. Two-phase flows commonly occur in nature and in a multitude of other settings. They are not only of academic interest but are found in a wide range of engineering applications, continuing to pose a challenge to many research scientists and industrial practitioners alike. Although many important advances have been made in the past, the efforts to understand fundamental behavior and mechanisms of two-phase flow are necessarily a continuing process. Volume 8 of Multiphase Science and Technology contains the text of the invited lectures given at the Third International Workshop on Two-Phase Flow Fundamentals sponsored by the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) and the U.

The diversity of the participants enriched the discussions and conclusions that were reached. The purpose of the workshop was to define the state-of-the-art in two-phase flow, advance the science, and reach a consensus on future research directions. In particular, the specific emphasis was to evaluate the current understanding of the physics of multiphase flows as based on measurement and visualization, to evaluate the current state of the art in modeling of multiphase physics, to develop an agreed-upon basis for the balance equations for multiphase systems and their associated boundary conditions and closure relations, to evaluate and discuss the mathematical structure of the equations to describe multiphase flow, and to discuss and identify the methodologies needed to apply proper numerical procedures for the solution of the governing equations; that is, to fill existing gaps and bring together materials from diverse fields of multiphase flow.

A estimativa desses parÃmetros nÃo se dÃ por mÃtodos diretos, necessita-se conhecer algumas respostas hidrÃulicas, como vazÃo e pressÃo, para que se possa estimar esses parÃmetros atravÃs de mÃtodos inversos. O processo de busca ocorre atravÃs da comparaÃÃo entre medidas de pressÃo observadas em campo e medidas de pressÃo obtidas por esses mÃtodos. A busca pelo melhor conjunto resposta que represente esses parÃmetros desconhecidos recebe o nome de calibraÃÃo. Desenvolve-se um mÃtodo para estimar a rugosidade das tubulaÃÃes de uma rede hidrÃulica a partir de dados observados de cargas hidrÃulicas transientes durante um evento transitÃrio. O MÃtodo Iterativo do Gradiente HidrÃulico Alternativo (MIGHA) Ã utilizado como mÃtodo inverso neste trabalho. O transiente Ã provocado por manobras em uma vÃlvula de controle. Ensaios sÃo realizados em diferentes cenÃrios e sob diferentes condiÃÃes e os resultados mostram um mÃtodo simples, com resultados satisfatÃrios. The real {{behavior}} of a Water distribution System depends on precise knowledge of physical parameters such as diameter, roughness, flow consumption (demands), etc. These parameters commonly change with time. For instance, {{one of the main}} parameters, the real roughness, tend to increase with time due to degradation of the specific pipe material. One can not precisely determine the real roughness of a pipe by using direct measurement methods. In order to achieve the objective of estimating roughness with some precision, two parameters of the water distribution network should be measured in the field, these parameters are pipe flow and pressure. Once known these parameters for a reasonable amount of points, equally distributed along the network of pipes, the real roughness may be determined by inverse methods. This process is called calibration. This study proposes a methodology to determine pipe roughness using transient pressure data which occurs during the Water <b>Hammer</b> Analysis <b>phenomena.</b> The Iterative Hydraulic Gradient Method is used as the inverse method in this study. The transient pressure data is produced by changes in the flow caused by opening and closing of Control Valves. According to results presented in this study the new methodology proposed appears to be simple and which produces reliable results...|$|R
