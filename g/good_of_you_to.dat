60|$|MRS. HIGGINS. Very <b>good</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> come. [Introducing] Colonel Pickering.|$|E
60|$|MRS DUDEBAT [shaking hands] It's so <b>good</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> come, doctor.|$|E
60|$|TWISDEN. We {{are obliged}} to you, Sir. It was <b>good</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> come.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's very <b>good</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> not <b>to</b> {{have said}} {{anything}} disagreeable to me, Philip. I {{thought you might}} say I didn't know what all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, Nuttie, how <b>good</b> <b>of</b> <b>you!</b> Please <b>to</b> {{excuse the}} accompaniment. There never {{was such a}} young lady for self-assertion {{to make up for}} there being so little of her.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's so <b>good</b> <b>of</b> <b>you,</b> Ken, <b>to</b> take Tom Gates {{into your}} employ," [...] said the girl, {{pressing}} her cousin's arm. [...] "And I'm sure he'll be true and grateful." ...|$|R
60|$|Then it's {{finished}} at last. [She shakes hands with DICK.] It's so <b>good</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> come.|$|E
60|$|WELLWYN. So <b>good</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> come, Sir Thomas. Canon Bertley! [They greet.] Professor CALWAY you know, I think.|$|E
60|$|LORD W. [Shaking hands] How d'you do! Delighted {{to see you}} all. It's awfully <b>good</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> have come.|$|E
6000|$|... "The surgeon {{has just}} given a <b>good</b> account <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> the king, Drummond," [...] he said; [...] "and his majesty {{expressed}} much satisfaction at hearing that your wounds are not serious.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, it's time for. Byron, now. It {{was very}} <b>good</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> not <b>to</b> mention him before, Mrs. Vervain. Bat I {{knew he had}} to come. He called it a coffin clapped in a canoe." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is very <b>good</b> <b>of</b> <b>you,</b> Violet, <b>to</b> {{have sent}} {{for me at}} once," [...] he said. [...] "I know you won't mind if I hurry away. It is very {{important}} that I see Madame." ...|$|R
60|$|LORD WINDERMERE. It {{was very}} <b>good</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> receive her last night--but you are never {{to see her}} again.|$|E
60|$|HASLAM [beaming] Simply fatuous. [Rising] Well, I suppose I'd {{better be}} going. It's most awfully <b>good</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> {{put up with}} my calling.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Mrs Gull will do nicely, Sheila. It's very <b>good</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> {{have given}} me so much thought.' A long and rather arduous pause followed.|$|E
6000|$|... "So <b>good</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> fellows <b>to</b> {{come and}} look me up!" [...] he exclaimed, {{welcoming}} us cordially. [...] "Waiter, {{a bottle of}} Pommery. Don't shake your head now, Lord Silchester. It'll do you good. I can see you're a bit seedy this morning." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{nobody else}} will either. It's dashed <b>good</b> <b>of</b> <b>you,</b> Freddie, <b>to</b> cook up a yarn {{like that to}} try and make things look better for the blighter, but it won't work. Such a damn silly story, too!" [...] said Algy with some indignation.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is <b>good</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> {{coming here}} <b>to</b> find me, old fellow. You are always getting me out <b>of</b> scrapes. <b>You</b> {{remember}} that affair at Toulouse.|$|R
6000|$|... "How <b>good</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> come. I {{should not}} have dared go to your house, because I know that you feel so deeply. You--you heard?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Violets! Oh, and spring! Daren, it was <b>good</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> gather {{them for}} me. I remember.... But I {{told you not}} to come again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Awfully <b>good</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> want me," [...] he remarked. [...] "I daresay I'll {{be able to}} come. I'll try, anyhow--just {{for a day or}} two." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'How <b>good</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> not <b>to</b> forget me {{when you}} {{are in the midst of}} such dangers and hardships,' {{answered}} she. 'Yes, it is true I have many beautiful things; but if <b>you</b> want <b>to</b> give me a present--and to-morrow is my birthday--there IS one thing that I wish for very much.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's <b>good</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> fellows <b>to</b> {{listen to}} my prosing," [...] he remarked. [...] "No use denying {{that it is a}} sort of hobby <b>of</b> mine. <b>You</b> all know it. Well, we'll say we've {{finished}} with the cabby, then. Enter upon the scene, of all people in the world, our friend Wrayson!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Four {{thousand}} pounds, my wife tells me," [...] Hunterleys remarked coolly, as {{he began}} to count out the notes. [...] "It is very <b>good</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> indeed <b>to</b> have acted as my wife's banker. Do you mind being paid now? Our movements are a little uncertain and it will save the trouble <b>of</b> sending <b>you</b> a cheque." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is very <b>good</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> do it first," [...] Morris answered. [...] "The young man--the happy lover--generally does that. But {{just as you}} please!" ...|$|E
6000|$|She hesitated. (Her {{room was}} on the third floor.) [...] "It is very <b>good</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> be so {{thoughtful}} of me," [...] she said, [...] "but----" ...|$|E
6000|$|She nodded, and {{repeated}} with a soft, mysterious wisdom: [...] "Nobody." [...] And then, aloud: [...] "Here's Oliver! It was awfully <b>good</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> come. Good-night!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm just {{beginning}} to realize how close to death I was," [...] he whispered to Tom. [...] "It was awfully <b>good</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> and Dick <b>to</b> do what <b>you</b> did." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'It's lovely, dad,' says she, leaning down by his pillow; 'I {{never saw}} one so pretty. How dear and <b>good</b> it was <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> {{buy it for}} me!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Lady," [...] he said, [...] "you {{have heard}} my message; blame not yourself, I beseech you, for my death. Remember {{that after all}} you have {{lengthened}} my life and not shortened it, seeing that but for your interference I must have been slain as I stood, by your followers. It was kind and <b>good</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> thus <b>to</b> come to bid me farewell." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It is very <b>good</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> come.' She was embarrassed, and did {{not know}} what exactly to say. 'I am always very glad to see you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{man does}} not tell of such things, I think; but a girl remembers them. It is so <b>good</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> come. You know--do you not?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am so glad." [...] She {{was still}} {{overpowered}} by the disclosure. [...] "It is <b>good</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> tell me. Do you mind my telling Phil?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, very kind; I {{never was}} so happy before; and now you are come {{it will be more}} {{delightful}} than ever; how <b>good</b> it is <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> come so far on purpose to see me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's very <b>good</b> <b>of</b> <b>you,</b> I'm sure, <b>to</b> let us fellows in, but {{the public}} demand is immense just now, and we only obey orders, you know," [...] began the fifth intruder, fervently hoping the other four had been refused.|$|R
6000|$|Miss Notman {{was proud}} of her hand, viewed {{as one of the}} meritorious details of her figure. She took up the sugar-tongs with suavity and grace; she dropped the sugar into the cup with a {{youthful}} pleasure in ministering to the minor desires of her illustrious guest. [...] "It is so <b>good</b> <b>of</b> <b>you,</b> Father, <b>to</b> honor me in this way," [...] she said--with the appearance of sixteen super-induced upon the reality of sixty.|$|R
