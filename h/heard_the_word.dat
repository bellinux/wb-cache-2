25|$|By August 20, 2006, Allen began {{insisting that}} he had never before <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>word,</b> and that he simply made it up, {{contrary}} to original explanations from Allen and his staff.|$|E
25|$|On {{the day of}} Callum's hanging, he {{asks his}} guard, Jack, to deliver a letter to Sephy personally. Callum is then led to the gallows. He fails to find Sephy in the crowd before the hood is put on. He then hears Sephy shouting, 'I love you'. He shouts back, 'I love you too'. Sephy watches the {{trapdoor}} open and sees Callum's limp, lifeless body hanging from the noose. She hears Callum shouting to her but is unsure if she <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> 'too' so she cannot be sure that Callum heard her.|$|E
500|$|After {{the video}} was banned on MTV in the United Kingdom, Allen commented {{regarding}} this in an inverview:I got really offended when my single 'Smile' got banned [...] from MTV in the U.K. {{because it had}} the word fuck in it. They said, 'We don't want kids to grow up too quickly.' But then you have Paris Hilton and the Pussycat Dolls taking their clothes off and gyrating up against womanizing, asshole men, and that's acceptable. You're thinking your kids are gonna grow up quicker because they <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> fuck than from thinking they should be shoving their tits in people's faces? ...|$|E

6000|$|... "In five minutes!" [...] echoed Gavin, {{with such}} a dismal face that Babbie <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> with her eyes, and dropped her hands.|$|R
500|$|Barbara Gittings {{was born}} to Elizabeth (née Brooks) Gittings and John Sterett Gittings in Vienna, Austria, where her father was serving as a U.S. diplomat. Barbara and her {{siblings}} attended Catholic schools in Montreal. She was so immersed in Catholicism {{at one point in}} her childhood that she considered becoming a nun. Her family returned to the United States at the outbreak of World War II and settled in Wilmington, Delaware. Although aware of her attraction to other girls, Gittings said she first <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> [...] "homosexual" [...] when she was rejected for membership in the National Honor Society in high school. Despite being an excellent student, a teacher who had reservations about her character took her aside and told her that the rejection was based on what the teacher believed were [...] "homosexual inclinations".|$|E
500|$|Despite its {{critical}} and commercial success, Hairspray nonetheless garnered some criticism upon its release by {{individuals in the}} gay community. Much of this criticism surrounded Travolta's portrayal of Edna Turnblad, a role played in the original film by celebrated drag performer Divine, and in the stage adaptation by Harvey Fierstein. Kevin Naff, a managing editor for Washington, D.C./Baltimore area gay newspaper the Washington Blade called for a boycott of the new Hairspray film, alleging that Scientology, in which Travolta believes, was patently homophobic, and allegedly supported workshops designed to [...] "cure" [...] homosexuals. Adam Shankman protested Naff's proposed boycott, stating that Travolta was not homophobic, as he (Shankman), Waters, Shaiman, Wittman, and several {{other members of the}} creative staff were homosexual, and Travolta got along well with the entire crew. [...] "John's personal beliefs did not walk onto my set," [...] said Shankman. [...] "I never <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> 'Scientology.'" ...|$|E
500|$|The media showed {{concern over}} the film's title, deeming it [...] "odd", and some people were shocked because of the title, which can be {{translated}} into English as [...] "mean". However, the makers said that [...] "kaminey" [...] is not a negative term and is actually a term of endearment. According to Bhardwaj, {{the idea for the}} title came from a scene from Gulzar's Ijaazat (1987), in which the lead actor (Naseeruddin Shah) refers to the actress in a loving manner; {{it was the first time}} that he <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> used that way. Bhardwaj told Rediff, [...] "when the script of this film was written, it was like discovering your own mean side. The format of the film is of a caper and all the characters in this film, excluding one, has an agenda. So I thought it was an apt title for the film".|$|E
60|$|Martin <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>words,</b> and {{was seized}} {{with such an}} intense access of fear that he burst into a sweat all over his body.|$|R
6000|$|Thus I {{closed my}} musings. [...] "Good-night" [...] left my lips in sound; I <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> spoken, and then I heard an echo--quite close.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{answers the}} description," [...] said the sergeant, and though I <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> I took no {{thought that it}} was of me they spoke.|$|R
500|$|I think that's bullshit. The word {{police can}} fuck off. I don't {{want to be}} policed! I'm not {{interested}} in political correctness. The word [...] "bitch" [...] means {{a lot of different}} things. Everything is about context. When I first moved to England and <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> [...] "cunt", I was horrified. People were calling each other cunts! And then I realized that, in that culture, it was different—they slapped each other on the back and said, [...] "Who's the cunt, right, you're my best mate!" [...] The word [...] "fuck" [...] doesn't just mean sexual intercourse. I mean, [...] "You're a stupid fuck," [...] "Are you going to fuck with me?" [...] "Fuck off!"... Sex {{has nothing to do with}} any of those expressions, and the same goes for [...] "bitch". If I say to you, [...] "I'm a badass bitch," [...] I'm owning myself, I'm saying, [...] "I'm strong, I'm tough, and don't mess with me." [...] If I say, [...] "Why are you being such a bitch to me?," [...] well, that means something else.|$|E
500|$|The use of fake weapons {{generated}} controversy. After {{the concert}} in Colorado, Madonna was criticised {{over the use}} of fake weapons, since the public was sensitized by the 2012 Aurora shooting, which occurred at the premiere of The Dark Knight Rises. Peter Burns, a radio broadcaster in the region, told The Hollywood Reporter that [...] "You could see people kinda looking at each other. I <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> 'Colorado', you know, 'Aurora', 'shooting'. You could hear people talking about it, and it was little bit unsettling. I saw two or three people get up and grab their stuff and actually leave their seats". Ray Mark Rinaldi from Reverb website said that Madonna was [...] "dancing with guns and shooting up bad guys during 'Revolver'. It was a bloody scene, particularly tasteless in Colorado these days, but all cartoon; if folks got upset, they were supposed to". Daniel Brokman from The Phoenix said: [...] "Madonna took the capacity crowd into a dark place that few were expecting minutes earlier from this queen of '80s pop music". In a review of the concert, Ross Raihala from Twin Cities mentioned that there was [...] "darkness hung over much {{of the first half of}} the show" [...] because of the performances of [...] "Revolver" [...] and [...] "Gang Bang." ...|$|E
2500|$|On August 16, 2006, the National Journal {{reported}} that two Virginia Republicans who <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> used by Allen's campaign staff said macaca was a neologism created from mohawk and caca, Spanish and French slang for excrement. The National Journal quoted a Republican {{close to the}} campaign saying, [...] "In other words, [...] was a shit-head, an annoyance." ...|$|E

2500|$|A reader {{once asked}} Tolkien {{whether the name}} Gondor had been {{inspired}} by the ancient Ethiopian citadel of Gondar. [...] Tolkien replied that {{he was unaware of}} having <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> before, and that the root Ond went back to an account he had read as a child mentioning ond ("stone") as one of only two words known of the pre-Celtic languages of Britain.|$|E
2500|$|In an 1989 {{interview}} with Richard Dean Anderson, Arsenio Hall {{said that he}} had <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> MacGyver used as a verb meaning [...] "to do the impossible." [...] Anderson then used it as an adjective meaning [...] "impossible." [...] Anderson stated that his show's producers had just missed out on getting the word [...] "MacGyverism" [...] entered into the Webster's Dictionary and that [...] "we" [...] intended to try to get it in the next update. The word [...] "MacGyver" [...] however entered the Oxford Dictionaries in 2015 as a verb meaning [...] "make or repair (an object) in an improvised or inventive way, making use of whatever items are at hand".|$|E
2500|$|Gerbic's {{interest}} in paranormal and fringe topics began during childhood, {{when she was}} most frightened by spontaneous human combustion, [...] "the idea {{that you could be}} walking down the street and suddenly, BOOM!" [...] She grew up in Salinas as a Southern Baptist who became interested in skepticism in the 1990s. [...] "I had never <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> atheist until I was in my late teens," [...] Gerbic told Skeptical Inquirer editor Benjamin Radford. [...] "Once I found out there were other people who felt the way I did, I read everything I could on the subject". In 2000, Gerbic discovered that there was a community of skeptics and went to her first conference, Skeptic's Toolbox in Eugene, Oregon a month later. [...] "I felt like I had found my people." ...|$|E

60|$|There were thirty men seated there, and {{although}} they <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>words,</b> they did not show by a single glance that they feared to meet their doom.|$|R
60|$|Oh, my joy as I <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>words!</b> What an end--what an end for {{the first}} swordsman of France! I could have laughed with delight at the thought.|$|R
2500|$|There are few direct testimonies to the {{language}} of the Cimbri: Referring to the Northern Ocean (the Baltic or the North Sea), Pliny the Elder states: [...] "Philemon says that it is called Morimarusa, i.e. the Dead Sea, by the Cimbri, until the promontory of Rubea, and after that Cronium." [...] The contemporary Gaulish terms for “sea” and “dead” appear to have been mori and *maruo-; compare their well-attested modern Insular Celtic cognates muir and marbh (Irish), môr and marw (Welsh), and mor and marv (Breton). The same word for “sea” is also known from Germanic, but with an a (*mari-), whereas a cognate of marbh is unknown in all dialects of Germanic. Yet, given that Pliny had not <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> directly from a Cimbric informant, it cannot be ruled out that the word is in fact Gaulish instead.|$|E
2500|$|According to Gardner's later account, {{one night}} in September 1939 they {{took him to a}} large house owned by [...] "Old Dorothy" [...] Clutterbuck, a wealthy local woman, where he was made to strip naked and taken through an {{initiation}} ceremony. Halfway through the ceremony, he <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> [...] "Wica", and he recognised it as an Old English word for [...] "witch". He was already acquainted with Margaret Murray's theory of the Witch-cult, and that [...] "I then knew then that which I had thought burnt out hundreds of years ago still survived." [...] This group, he claimed, were the New Forest coven, and he believed them {{to be one of the}} few surviving covens of the ancient, pre-Christian Witch-Cult religion. Subsequent research by the likes of Hutton and Heselton has shown that in fact the New Forest coven was probably only formed in the mid-1930s, based upon such sources as folk magic and the theories of Margaret Murray.|$|E
2500|$|The show employs {{contemporary}} kid-slang extensively. Wally and Beaver both use [...] "gyp" [...] (to swindle), [...] "mess around" [...] (to play), and [...] "hunka" [...] (meaning [...] "hunk of" [...] {{in relation}} to food portions such as [...] "hunka cake" [...] or [...] "hunka milk"). [...] "Junk", [...] "crummy", [...] "gee whiz", [...] "gosh", [...] "wiseguy", [...] "grubby", [...] "rat", and [...] "creep" [...] are frequently <b>heard.</b> <b>The</b> <b>word</b> [...] "beef" [...] was also used at times (mostly by Wally) {{over the course of}} the show's run, meaning [...] "disagreement" [...] (as in contemporary hip-hop). Ward and June disapprove. Wally uses [...] "sweat" [...] to his mother's annoyance; she prefers [...] "perspiration" [...] and asks him not to use the slang words [...] "flip" [...] or [...] "ape". [...] "Goofy" [...] is one of Beaver's favorite adjectives, and it is applied to anything that lies outside the bounds of 1950s conformism. [...] "Giving me/you/him/her the business" [...] was a phrase used to describe a character being sarcastic with or otherwise teasing another character. [...] "Flake off" [...] was often used by Wally's friends to tell the Beaver to leave them alone.|$|E

2500|$|In a radio {{interview}} discussing {{her book}} Quo Vadis? Collegiality in the Code of Canon Law on 28 September 2012, {{said she was}} concerned at {{the growing number of}} young men, and in particular young gay men, who take their own lives in Ireland. She said that when the research is broken down, it shows that young gay men {{are one of the most}} risk-prone groups in Ireland. McAleese said many of these young men will have gone to Catholic schools and they will have heard there their church's attitude to homosexuality. [...] "They will have heard words like 'disorder', they may even have <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> 'evil' used in relation to homosexual practice," [...] she said. She went on to say [...] "And when they make the discovery, and it is a discovery and not a decision, when they make the discovery, that they are gay, when they are 14, 15 or 16, an internal conflict of absolutely appalling proportions opens up". She said many young gay men are driven into a place that is [...] "dark and bleak". McAleese said she met the Apostolic Nuncio, Archbishop Charles John Brown, shortly after Easter to raise with him her concern about the growing number of suicides among young men in Ireland.|$|E
