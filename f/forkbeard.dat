She is perhaps more famous than her father, because at some time between 1013 and 1016 she married Cnut, son of Sweyn <b>Forkbeard,</b> future King of the English. Her son was Harold Harefoot, King of the English.|$|E
5|$|Nothing can {{be gleaned}} from the {{contemporary}} skaldic poems on {{the causes of the}} battle. Adam of Bremen states that Olaf Tryggvason's Danish wife, Thyri, egged him on to make war against Denmark. When Olaf heard that Svein <b>Forkbeard</b> and Olaf the Swede had formed an alliance, he was angered and decided the time had come for an attack. Ágrip and Historia Norwegie have a similar account. Thyri was the sister of Svein <b>Forkbeard,</b> and when Olaf Tryggvason married her, Svein refused to pay her promised dowry. Angered, Olaf launched an expedition to attack Denmark, but he was too impatient to wait for a fleet to assemble from all of Norway, and he set sail for the south with only 11 ships, expecting the rest to follow. When that hope was not realized, he set out for Wendland (Pomerania) to seek allies and on the way was ambushed by Svein and his allies. These accounts are contradicted by a contemporary verse of Halldórr the Unchristian which states that Olaf Tryggvason was travelling from the south {{when he came to the}} battle.|$|E
5|$|King Olaf was sailing {{home after}} an {{expedition}} to Wendland (Pomerania), when he was ambushed by an alliance of Svein <b>Forkbeard,</b> King of Denmark, Olof Skötkonung (also known as Olaf Eiríksson), King of Sweden, and Eirik Hákonarson, Jarl of Lade. Olaf had only 11 warships {{in the battle against}} a fleet of at least 70. His ships were captured one by one, last of all the Ormen Lange, which Jarl Eirik captured as Olaf threw himself into the sea. After the battle, Norway was ruled by the Jarls of Lade as a fief of Denmark and Sweden.|$|E

5|$|Nonnebakken, a {{hill in the}} Odense area, is {{the site}} of one of Denmark's six former Viking ring castles, built during the reign of Sweyn <b>Forkbeard,</b> who had forced his father Harold Bluetooth to leave the country and seek refuge by the Jomsvikings in Wollin (modern Poland) in around 975.

The archaeological remains of the fort were heavily damaged when a building for the Odd Fellow lodge was constructed on the site during the late nineteenth century.|$|E
5|$|While rejecting Danish authority, Olaf made it {{his mission}} to convert Norway and the Norse colonies in the west as quickly and as {{completely}} as possible. Proceeding with threats, torture and executions, Olaf broke down pagan resistance {{and within a few}} years Norway was, at least nominally, a Christian country. But King Olaf had acquired several enemies during his meteoric rise to power. The most prominent were Eirik Jarl, son of Haakon Jarl, and Svein <b>Forkbeard,</b> king of Denmark, both of whom felt that Olaf had deprived them of their share of Norway.|$|E
5|$|After the Battle of Svolder, {{the victorious}} leaders split Norway into areas of control. Heimskringla gives the most {{detailed}} account of the division, describing it as threefold. Olaf the Swede received four districts in Trondheim as well as Møre, Romsdal and Rånrike. He gave these to Jarl Svein Hákonarson, his son in law, to hold as a vassal. Svein <b>Forkbeard</b> gained possession of the Viken district, where Danish influence had long been strong. The rest of Norway was ruled by Eirik Hákonarson as Svein's vassal. Fagrskinna, in contrast, says that the Swedish part consisted of Oppland {{and a part of}} Trondheim. Other sources are less specific.|$|E

5|$|Leofric was {{probably}} born in Cornwall, {{and his parents}} were English. Because canon law required that a bishop be 30 years old when consecrated, {{it is likely that}} Leofric was born before 1016. The medieval chronicler Florence of Worcester referred to him as a Brytonicus, which presumably meant that he was a native of Cornwall. He had a brother, Ordmaer, who acted as his steward and administered the family estates. Leofric was educated in Lotharingia, and may have been brought up abroad. Leofric may have gone into exile either in 1013 when Sweyn <b>Forkbeard,</b> the king of Denmark invaded England or in 1016, when Sweyn's son Cnut became king of England. His education possibly took place at the church of St Stephen's in Toul, where the future Pope Leo IX was a canon from 1017 to 1024 and bishop after 1027.|$|E
5|$|With {{the death}} of Edgar, however, the royal {{succession}} became problematic. Æthelred took power in 978 following {{the murder of his}} brother Edward, but England was then invaded by Sweyn <b>Forkbeard,</b> the son of a Danish king. Attempts to bribe Sweyn not to attack using danegeld payments failed, and he took the throne in 1013. Swein's son, Cnut, liquidated many of the older English families following his seizure of power in 1016. Æthelred's son, Edward the Confessor, had survived in exile in Normandy and returned to claim the throne in 1042. Edward was childless, and the succession again became a concern. England became dominated by the Godwin family, who had taken advantage of the Danish killings to acquire huge wealth. When Edward died in 1066, Harold Godwinson claimed the throne, defeating his rival Norwegian claimant, Harald Hardrada, at the battle of Stamford Bridge.|$|E
5|$|During the {{settlement}} period the lands {{ruled by the}} incomers {{seem to have been}} fragmented into numerous tribal territories, but by the 7th century, when substantial evidence of the situation again becomes available, these had coalesced into roughly a dozen kingdoms including Northumbria, Mercia, Wessex, East Anglia, Essex, Kent and Sussex. Over the following centuries this process of political consolidation continued. The 7th century saw a struggle for hegemony between Northumbria and Mercia, which in the 8th century gave way to Mercian preeminence. In the early 9th century Mercia was displaced as the foremost kingdom by Wessex. Later in that century escalating attacks by the Danes culminated in the conquest of the north and east of England, overthrowing the kingdoms of Northumbria, Mercia and East Anglia. Wessex under Alfred the Great was left as the only surviving English kingdom, and under his successors it steadily expanded {{at the expense of the}} kingdoms of the Danelaw. This brought about the political unification of England, first accomplished under Æthelstan in 927 and definitively established after further conflicts by Eadred in 953. A fresh wave of Scandinavian attacks from the late 10th century ended with the conquest of this united kingdom by Sweyn <b>Forkbeard</b> in 1013 and again by his son Cnut in 1016, turning it into the centre of a short-lived North Sea Empire that also included Denmark and Norway. However the native royal dynasty was restored with the accession of Edward the Confessor in 1042.|$|E
50|$|In 1016 Sweyn <b>Forkbeard's</b> son, Canute, became King of England. After {{two years}} he felt {{sufficiently}} in control of his new kingdom {{to the extent of}} being able to pay off all but 40 ships of his invasion fleet, which were retained as a personal bodyguard, with a huge Danegeld of 72,000 troy pounds (26,900 kg) of silver collected nationally, plus a further 10,500 pounds (3,900 kg) of silver collected from London.|$|R
5000|$|Historians {{are divided}} about the {{strength}} of the evidence that she was Sweyn <b>Forkbeard's</b> sister. Ryan Lavelle is sceptical of the reliability of the later medieval sources, such as the Chronicle of John of Wallingford, which mention her. However, Frank Stenton described the claim as a [...] "well recorded tradition", and considered that a desire to avenge her death was probably a principal motive for Sweyn's invasion of England in 1003, leading to the eventual conquest of England by his son Cnut.|$|R

The first Scanian coins have been dated to 870AD. The archaeological excavations performed in the city indicate that the oldest known stave church in Scania was built by Sweyn <b>Forkbeard</b> in Lund in 990. In 1103, Lund was made the archbishopric for all of Scandinavia.|$|E

His date of birth, like his mother's name, is unknown. Contemporary works such as the Chronicon and the Encomium Emmae, do not mention this. Even so, in a Knútsdrápa by the skald Óttarr svarti, there is a statement that Cnut was [...] "of no great age" [...] when he first went to war. It also mentions a battle identifiable with Sweyn <b>Forkbeard's</b> invasion of England and attack on the city of Norwich, in 1003/04, after the St. Brice's Day massacre of Danes by the English, in 1002. If Cnut indeed accompanied this expedition, his birthdate may be near 990, or even 980. If not, and if the skald's poetic verse references another assault, such as <b>Forkbeard's</b> conquest of England in 1013/14, it may even suggest a birth date nearer 1000. There is a passage of the Encomiast (as the author of the Encomium Emmae is known) with a reference to the force Cnut led in his English conquest of 1015/16. Here (see below) it says all the Vikings were of [...] "mature age" [...] under Cnut [...] "the king".|$|R
5000|$|Her son Wulfric [...] "Spot" [...] {{became one}} of the king's {{principal}} thegns in the 990s and an even more extensive landowner, with holdings in Derbyshire, western Warwickshire, the territories [...] "between the Ribble and the Mersey", Northumbria, and seven other English counties as well as his inheritance in Staffordshire by {{the time of his death}} circa 1002-4. In his will, which survives, he endowed much of his land to re-found Burton Abbey. Another son, Ælfhelm, was made ealdorman of Northumbria, in practice southern Northumbria (the area around York), from about 994 until his death in 1006. His daughter Ælfgifu would go on to be married to Cnut, future king of England, in the wake of his father Sweyn <b>Forkbeard's</b> invasion of England in 1013. Ælfgifu later played a key role in securing the throne for her son Harold Harefoot in 1036. Wulfrun is known to have also had at least one other child: Wulfric's will contains bequests to the daughter of a sister, Ælfthryth, who had apparently died before the will was written in 1002.|$|R
5000|$|The Chronicon of Thietmar of Merseburg and the Encomium Emmae report Cnut's {{mother as}} having been a {{daughter}} of Mieszko I of Poland.Norse sources of the High Middle Ages, most prominently Heimskringla by Snorri Sturluson, also give a Polish princess as Cnut's mother, whom they call Gunhild and a daughter of Burislav, the king of Vindland.Since in the Norse sagas the king of Vindland is always Burislav, this is reconcilable {{with the assumption that}} her father was Mieszko (not his son Bolesław). Adam of Bremen in Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum is unique in equating Cnut's mother (for whom he also produces no name) with the former queen of Sweden, wife of Eric the Victorious and by this marriage mother of Olof Skötkonung.To complicate the matter, Heimskringla and other sagas also have Sweyn marrying Eric's widow, but she is distinctly another person in these texts, named Sigrid the Haughty, whom Sweyn only marries after Gunhild, the Slavic princess who bore Cnut, has died.Different theories regarding the number and ancestry of Sweyn's wives (or wife) have been advanced (see Sigrid the Haughty and Gunhild). But since Adam is the only source to equate the identity of Cnut's and Olof Skötkonung's mother, this is often seen as an error on Adam's part, and it is often assumed that Sweyn had two wives, the first being Cnut's mother, and the second being the former Queen of Sweden. Cnut's brother Harald was the first-born and crown prince.Some hint of Cnut's childhood {{can be found in the}} Flateyjarbók, a 13th-century source that says he was taught his soldiery by the chieftain Thorkell the Tall, brother to Sigurd, Jarl of mythical Jomsborg, and the legendary Joms, at their Viking stronghold on the island of Wollin, off the coast of Pomerania.

25|$|Hardly {{anything}} {{is known for}} sure of Cnut's life until the year {{he was part of}} a Scandinavian force under his father, King Sweyn, in his invasion of England in summer 1013. It was the climax to a succession of Viking raids spread over a number of decades. Following their landing in the Humber the kingdom fell to the Vikings quickly, and {{near the end of the}} year King Æthelred fled to Normandy, leaving Sweyn <b>Forkbeard</b> in possession of England. In the winter, <b>Forkbeard</b> was in the process of consolidating his kingship, with Cnut left in charge of the fleet and the base of the army at Gainsborough.|$|E
25|$|Świętosława (Sigrid) (b. 968/72 – d. ca. 1016), married {{first to}} Eric the Victorious, King of Sweden {{and later to}} Sweyn <b>Forkbeard,</b> King of Denmark. From her second marriage, she {{probably}} {{was the mother of}} Cnut the Great, King of Denmark, Norway and England. Some researchers, comparing Scandinavian, Polish and German sources state it was Gunhild who was the daughter of Mieszko I and Oda (not Dobrawa) and who became wife of Sweyn <b>Forkbeard,</b> king of Denmark, England, and parts of Norway, mother of Cnut the Great, king of Denmark, England, Norway and parts of Sweden (the Anglo-Scandinavian or North Sea Empire), as well as Harald and Świętosława. She was also the grandmother of Gunhild, the wife of Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor.|$|E
25|$|Cnut was {{a son of}} the Danish prince Sweyn <b>Forkbeard,</b> who was the son and heir to King Harald Bluetooth {{and thus}} came from a line of Scandinavian rulers central to the {{unification}} of Denmark. Neither the place nor the date of his birth are known. Harthacnut was the semi-legendary founder of the Danish royal house {{at the beginning of}} the 10th century, and his son, Gorm the Old, became the first in the official line (the 'Old' in his name indicates this). Harald Bluetooth, Gorm's son and Cnut's grandfather, was the Danish king at the time of the Christianization of Denmark; he became the first Scandinavian king to accept Christianity. Cnut was two years old when his grandfather, Harald Bluetooth, died, and his father, Sweyn <b>Forkbeard,</b> assumed the Danish throne.|$|E
25|$|Vinland Saga {{is set in}} England {{starting}} in 1013 AD, {{the year in which}} the Danish King Sweyn <b>Forkbeard</b> conquered most of it.

25|$|It is at {{this time}} the Five Boroughs are first {{recorded}} in an English poem known as the Capture of the Five Boroughs.

25|$|Jomsvikings {{are also}} {{reported}} to have raided eastern England in 1009, and made forays into various Scandinavian territories during the early 11th century. Around 1013, the Jomsvikings were campaigning in England on behalf of Sveyn <b>Forkbeard,</b> yet switched sides, maybe in a ruse to get their own Danegeld from the English, while the main Viking invasion force drove Ethelred the Unready to Normandy. Their decline continued {{over the next few}} decades.|$|E
25|$|During {{the first}} decade of Vladimir's reign, pagan {{reaction}} set in. Perun was chosen as the supreme deity of the Slavic pantheon and his idol was placed on the hill by the royal palace. This revival of paganism was contemporaneous with similar attempts undertaken by Jarl Haakon in Norway and (possibly) Svein <b>Forkbeard</b> in Denmark. His religious reform failed. By the late 980s he had found it necessary to adopt monotheism from abroad.|$|E
25|$|From the 8th to the 10th {{century the}} wider Scandinavian region {{was the source}} of Vikings. They colonised, raided, and traded in all parts of Europe. The Danish Vikings were most active in the eastern and {{southern}} British Isles and Western Europe. They conquered and settled parts of England (known as the Danelaw) under King Sweyn <b>Forkbeard</b> in 1013, and France where Danes and Norwegians founded Normandy with Rollo as head of state. More Anglo-Saxon pence of this period have been found in Denmark than in England.|$|E
25|$|Archeological {{findings}} at cemeteries in {{the vicinity}} of the gord of Ostrów Lednicki, near Poznań, has proven the presence of Norsemen in the area around 10th century, suggesting that they played an important part in the drużyna of Mieszko I, the de facto founder of the Polish state. Mieszko would later marry his daughter Świętosława (Sigrid) to the Danish king Sweyn <b>Forkbeard.</b> Mieszko's daughter would later give birth to Cnut the Great, king of Denmark, Sweden, and Norway - as well as a conqueror of England. It is likely that the Polish-Norse relationship was a result of earlier trade and cooperation.|$|E
25|$|Sweyn <b>Forkbeard</b> {{tried to}} wrest {{control of the}} church in Denmark away from the Holy Roman Empire and as a result was slandered by German historians of his day. He has been accused of {{relapsing}} from his Christian beliefs and persecuting Christians in England. In fact Sweyn gave land to the large cathedral at Lund to pay for the maintenance of the chapter. His army destroyed Christian churches in England as part of his invasion following the St. Brice's Day massacre of Danes organized by Aethelred. But when Sweyn became King of England and of Denmark, politics required that he show a kinder face toward the church which had opposed him.|$|E
25|$|The Normans were {{in contact}} with England from an early date. Not only were their {{original}} Viking brethren still ravaging the English coasts, they occupied most of the important ports opposite England across the English Channel. This relationship eventually produced closer ties of blood through the marriage of Emma, sister of Duke Richard II of Normandy, and King Ethelred II of England. Because of this, Ethelred fled to Normandy in 1013, when he was forced from his kingdom by Sweyn <b>Forkbeard.</b> His stay in Normandy (until 1016) influenced him and his sons by Emma, who stayed in Normandy after Cnut the Great's conquest of the isle.|$|E
25|$|In 1003, the Danish King Sweyn <b>Forkbeard</b> {{started a}} series of raids against England. This culminated in a {{full-scale}} invasion that led to Sweyn being crowned king of England in 1013. Sweyn was also king of Denmark and parts of Norway at this time. The throne of England passed to Edmund Ironside of Wessex after Sweyn's death in 1014. Sweyn's son, Cnut the Great, won the throne of England in 1016 through conquest. When Cnut the Great died in 1035 he was a king of Denmark, England, Norway, and parts of Sweden. Harold Harefoot became king of England after Cnut's death and Viking rule of England ceased.|$|E
