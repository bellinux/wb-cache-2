It was agreed that Spedding would spend half of each week in Ames, and half in Chicago. The first problem on the agenda was to find uranium for the nuclear reactor that Enrico Fermi was proposing to build. The only uranium metal available commercially was produced by the Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company, using a photochemical process that produced ingots the size of a quarter that were sold for around $20 per gram. Edward Creutz, the head of the group responsible for fabricating the uranium, wanted a metal sphere the size of an orange for his experiments.

500|$|Territorial {{disputes}} between Chile, Peru and Bolivia triggered the War of the Pacific in 1879 with Chile invading and occupying Peruvian and Bolivian land. [...] In {{the course of}} the war, North suffered damage to his waterworks, and one of his ships was sunk. [...] However he also befriended the Chilean Admiral Patricio Lynch who later supported him in his business ventures. [...] During the war, North was assisted by two British men: Robert Harvey, who had worked for the Peruvian government in the nitrates (saltpetre) industry, and John Dawson, a banker. [...] North was able to use Harvey's knowledge of the nitrates business and credit provided by Dawson to purchase nitrates bond certificates at low prices from investors who were panicked by Peru's poor military performance during the war. [...] After the war, the Chilean government annexed Tarapacá and allowed the bond holders to take possession of the title deeds to the nitrate fields, perhaps influenced by appeals from North's friends. [...] North thus managed to secure a large share of the Chilean nitrate industry for a very small initial investment in almost worthless bonds. [...] The reason that the Chilean government allowed this is that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>cost</b> them GBP£4 million to buy the bonds from the mainly British nitrate speculators.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe operations {{which might be}} performed by specialized mission helicopters are identified and several hypothetical mixes of these helicopters are developed and analyzed. Actual flight hours performed in fiscal years 1974 through 1978 are used as a data base for the study.
