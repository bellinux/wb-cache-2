5|$|Welders often {{develop a}} {{technique}} of rapidly alternating between moving the torch forward (to advance the weld pool) and adding filler metal. The filler rod is {{withdrawn from the}} weld pool each time the electrode advances, but it is always kept inside the <b>gas</b> <b>shield</b> to prevent oxidation of its surface and contamination of the weld. Filler rods composed of metals with a low melting temperature, such as aluminum, require that the operator maintain {{some distance from the}} arc while staying inside the <b>gas</b> <b>shield.</b> If held too close to the arc, the filler rod can melt before it makes contact with the weld puddle. As the weld nears completion, the arc current is often gradually reduced to allow the weld crater to solidify and prevent the formation of crater cracks {{at the end of the}} weld.|$|E
5|$|If {{the amount}} of current used exceeds the {{capability}} of the electrode, tungsten inclusions in the weld may result. Known as tungsten spitting, this can be identified with radiography and can be prevented by changing the type of electrode or increasing the electrode diameter. In addition, if the electrode is not well protected by the <b>gas</b> <b>shield</b> or the operator accidentally allows it to contact the molten metal, it can become dirty or contaminated. This often causes the welding arc to become unstable, requiring that the electrode be ground with a diamond abrasive to remove the impurity.|$|E
5|$|Flux-cored, {{self-shielding}} or gasless wire-fed welding {{had been}} developed for simplicity and portability. This avoids the gas system of conventional GMAW and uses a cored wire containing a solid flux. This flux vaporises during welding and produces a plume of shielding gas. Although described as a 'flux', this compound has little activity and acts mostly as an inert shield. The wire is of slightly larger diameter than for a comparable gas-shielded weld, to allow room for the flux. The smallest available is 0.8mm diameter, compared to 0.6mm for solid wire. The shield vapor is slightly active, rather than inert, so the process is always MAGS but not MIG (inert <b>gas</b> <b>shield).</b> This limits the process to steel and not aluminium.|$|E

40|$|As part of {{an ongoing}} process to fully {{evaluate}} the effects of an alternating <b>shielding</b> <b>gas</b> supply on <b>gas</b> <b>shielded</b> welding processes, a comparison between the arc pressures generated using argon, helium, alternating <b>shielding</b> <b>gases</b> and pulsed GTAW has been conducted. Arc pressure variation and peaking are two of the fundamental phenomena produced during the alternating <b>shielding</b> <b>gas</b> process and are said to help create a stirring action within the liquid weld metal. However, there is no published data on arc pressure measurements during an alternating <b>shielding</b> <b>gas</b> supply and, consequently, these phenomena are based solely on theoretical assumptions. The experimental measurements made have shown that alternating <b>shielding</b> <b>gases</b> produces considerably higher arc pressures than argon, helium and pulsed GTAW due to a surge at weld initiation.

5|$|The size of {{the welding}} torch nozzle depends {{on the amount of}} {{shielded}} area desired. The {{size of the}} gas nozzle depends upon the diameter of the electrode, the joint configuration, and the availability of access to the joint by the welder. The inside diameter of the nozzle is preferably at least three times the diameter of the electrode, but there are no hard rules. The welder judges the effectiveness of the shielding and increases the nozzle size to increase the area protected by the external <b>gas</b> <b>shield</b> as needed. The nozzle must be heat resistant and thus is normally made of alumina or a ceramic material, but fused quartz, a high purity glass, offers greater visibility. Devices can be inserted into the nozzle for special applications, such as gas lenses or valves to improve the control shielding gas flow to reduce turbulence and introduction of contaminated atmosphere into the shielded area. Hand switches to control welding current can be added to the manual GTAW torches.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Generally {{discrete}} alternate {{supply of}} <b>shielding</b> <b>gas</b> {{is a new}} technology which alternately supplies {{the different kinds of}} <b>shielding</b> <b>gases</b> in weld zone. In this study, welding characteristics under variation of alternate supply method of <b>shielding</b> <b>gases</b> in austenite stainless steel using a GTA welding process have been investigated and found the relationship between welding distortions and welding speed and different types of <b>shielding</b> <b>gas</b> and <b>shielding</b> <b>gas</b> supply. Design/methodology/approach: 2 -D axisymmetric heat and fluid mathematical model about welding arc and weld pool has been developed for verifying the effect of alternate supply of <b>shielding</b> <b>gas.</b> The developed models were solved using a general thermofluid-mechanics computer program, PHOEINCS code, which is based on SIMPLE algorithm. Findings: The computed results showed that the developed computational models are very adequate to predict in the weld pool and bead geometry, and the technique of alternate supply of <b>shielding</b> <b>gas</b> should be useful to increase higher productivity, cost savings and better quality in arc welding. Research limitations/implications: The effect of alternate supply of <b>shielding</b> <b>gas</b> should be useful to apply for a narrow -gap welding process.

40|$|Titanium alloys {{are known}} to exhibit unique {{weldability}} issues, particularly atmospheric contamination from interstitial species such as oxygen. The prevention of such impurities from entering the weld region and surrounding heat affected zones is critical for engineering applications as these species are seen to dramatically alter the microstructure and so mechanical properties of the material. Of greatest concern is embrittlement of the weld region. During this study, the influence of inert <b>shielding</b> <b>gas</b> on atmospheric contamination by interstitial species, namely hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen and oxygen, was investigated {{as a function of}} post-weld <b>gas</b> <b>shielding</b> temperature. Gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW) was used to compare samples of commercially pure (CP) titanium and Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy formed by conventional manufacturing methods. The influence of post-weld <b>gas</b> <b>shielding</b> on mechanical properties was quantified ex-situ through microhardness testing with observations of microstructure also made. It is shown that mechanical hardness levels are inversely proportional to the temperature to which continuous post-weld inert <b>gas</b> <b>shielding</b> is maintained. Hence interstitial impurity levels within the weld and heat affected zones are seen to increase with increasing post-weld shielding temperature. This effect was more pronounced in the Ti- 6 Al- 4 V material, and may be attributed to the comparatively low thermal conductivity...|$|R

40|$|With {{an ongoing}} demand {{to improve the}} {{efficiency}} of the gas metal arc welding process, steps are being taken to reduce the <b>shielding</b> <b>gas</b> consumption.

50|$|Hydrogen {{embrittlement}} manifests as {{a reduction}} in ductility and eventually spalling of titanium surfaces. The effect of hydrogen is {{to a large extent}} determined by the composition, metallurgical history and handling of the Ti /Ti alloy.

Embrittlement, observed as {{a reduction in}} ductility and caused by the formation of a solid solution of hydrogen, can occur in CP-titanium at concentrations as low as 30-40 ppm. Hydride formation has been linked to the presence of iron in the surface of a Ti alloy.
