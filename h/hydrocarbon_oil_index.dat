40|$|AIR:EAU+DCA:LFI:CFE:JMCIn {{order to}} prevent {{hydrocarbon}} discharge at sea from the bilge of ships, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) enacted the MARPOL 73 / 78 convention in which effluents are now limited to those with maximum oil content of 15 ppmv. Thus, photocatalysis and air-stripping were combined for the hydrocarbon removal from a real oily bilgewater sample and an original monitoring of both aqueous and gaseous phases was performed by GC/MS {{to better understand the}} process. Our results show that the <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>oil</b> <b>index</b> [HC] can be reduced to its maximum permissible value of 15 ppmv (MARPOL) in only 8. 5 h when photocatalysis and air-stripping are used together in a synergistic way, as against 17 h when photocatalysis is used alone. However, this air-assisted photocatalytic process emits a large quantity of volatile organic compounds (VOC) and, within the first four hours, ca. 10 % of the hydrocarbon removal in the aqueous phase is actually just transferred into the gaseous one. Finally, we highlight that the n-alkanes with a number of carbon atoms higher than 15 (N-C > 15) are those which most decrease the rate of [HC] removal. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|<b>Hydrocarbon</b> <b>oils</b> {{are often}} {{utilized}} as adjuvants in vaccines. In response to naturally occurring <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>oils,</b> inflammation is initiated and persists with the continuous recruitment of immune cells such as macrophages and neutrophils. However, the mechanism underlying the chronic inflammation {{in response to}} <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>oils</b> is not fully defined. In this study, we revealed an essential role of retinoid-related orphan receptor gamma t (RORct) in sustaining the recruitment of macrophages following pristane treatment. RORct absence resulted in the incompetent formation of mesenteric oil granulomas which may associate {{to a reduction in}} the migration of macrophages into the mesentery during pristane-induced inflammation. This is at least partially dependent on the expression of the monocyte chemoattractant protein- 1 (MCP- 1) in the mesentery and the decrease in the macrophage reservoir in the spleen. However, the absence of RORct had no impact on the recruitment of neutrophils to the mesentery after pristane treatment. Our data uncovered an important role of RORct in the recruitment of macrophages during hydrocarbon oil-induced chronic inflammation...|$|R

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} {{the role of}} particle-fluid wetting in inducing the electrorheological (ER) effect. Nanoparticles of barium titanyl oxalate coated with urea (BTRU) were suspended in either silicone <b>oil</b> or <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>oil.</b> In the former, a high yield stress of more than 250 kPa can be attained at an electric field of 5 kV/mm, while for the latter no measurable ER effect can be obtained. The two suspensions exhibit completely different appearances. Whereas the silicone oil suspension has the consistency of light cream, {{in the case of}} <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>oil</b> with the same solid concentration the appearance is that of a lumpy paste. This clear visual distinction is attributed to the wetting characteristic between the solid BTRU particles and the suspending oil. We found that by adding a controlled, small amount of surfactant additive to the <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>oil</b> suspension (oleic acid), the consistency can change drastically to resemble that of the silicone oil suspension, with a yield stress of 260 kPa attained at an electric field of 3 kV/mm. We give a simple physical picture of wetting-induced giant electrorheological effect. (c) 2006 American Institute of Physics...|$|R

40|$|The {{application}} of {{advanced oxidation processes}} (AOPs) {{to the treatment of}} an effluent contaminated with <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>oils</b> was investigated. The AOPs conducted were Fe 2 +/H 2 O 2 (Fenton’s reagent), Fe 2 +/H 2 O 2 /UV (Photo-Fenton’s reagent) and UV-photolysis. These technologies utilize the very strong oxidizing power of hydroxyl radicals to oxidize organic compounds to harmless end products such as CO 2 and H 2 O. A synthetic wastewater generated by emulsifying diesel oil and water was used. This wastewater might simulate, for example, a waste resulting from a <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>oil</b> spill, onto which detergent was sprayed. The experiments utilising the Photo-Fenton treatment method with an artificial UV source, coupled with Fenton’s reagent, suggest that the <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>oil</b> is readily degradable, but that the emulsifying agent is much more resistant to degradation. The results showed that the COD (chemical oxygen demand) removal rate was affected by the Photo-Fenton parameters (Fe 2 +, H 2 O 2 concentrations and the initial pH) of the aqueous solution. In addition, the applicability of the treatment method to a ‘real’ wastewater contaminated with <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>oil</b> is demonstrated. The ‘real’ wastewater was sourced at a nearby car-wash facility located at a petroleum filling station and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the treatment method in this case. A statistical analysis of the experimental data using the Statistical Analysis System (SAS) and the response surface methodology (RSM) based on the experimental design was applied to optimize the Photo-Fenton parameters (concentrations of Fe 2 +, H 2 O 2 and initial pH) and to maximize the COD removal rate (more than 70 %) ...|$|R
