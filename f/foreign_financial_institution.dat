50|$|U.S. banks {{offering}} PTA services {{should develop}} and maintain adequate policies, procedures, and processes {{to guard against}} possible illicit use of these accounts. At a minimum, policies, procedures, and processes should enable each U.S. bank to identify the ultimate users of its <b>foreign</b> <b>financial</b> <b>institution</b> PTA and should include the bank’s obtaining (or having the ability to obtain through a trusted third-party arrangement) substantially the same information on the ultimate PTA users as it obtains on its direct customers.|$|E
50|$|PTAs may be {{prone to}} higher risk because U.S. banks do not {{typically}} implement the same due diligence requirements for PTAs that they require of domestic customers who want to open checking and other accounts. For example, some U.S. banks merely request a copy of signature cards completed by the payable through customers (the customer of the <b>foreign</b> <b>financial</b> <b>institution).</b> These U.S. banks then process thousands of sub-accountholder checks and other transactions, including currency deposits, through the foreign financial institution’s PTA. In most cases, little or no independent effort is expended to obtain or confirm information about the individual and business subaccountholders that use the PTAs.|$|E
50|$|IRC §1441 et seq. {{regulates the}} {{withholding}} of income taxes from payments of U.S. source income {{made to a}} non-U.S. person. Generally, the U.S. payor must verify the Tax Identification Number (TIN) of its payees and withhold 30% of this payment if a TIN is not presented. A §1441 Qualified Intermediary (QI) is generally a foreign bank or other <b>foreign</b> <b>financial</b> <b>institution</b> that signs {{an agreement with the}} Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Under the agreement, the QI maintains its own records of the U.S. or foreign status of the beneficial owners of the payments and may undertake responsibility for income reporting and tax withholding. The QI agreement is valid for 6 years and the QI entity is subject to an IRS or external audit periodically to confirm compliance with the agreement terms. The §1441 QI regime was later supplemented by foreign account reporting requirements under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act.|$|E

40|$|In {{the three}} fast track, Central European {{transition}} countries, Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic, bank restructuring and privatization involved different approaches {{and met with}} a variety of outcomes. Hence, these experiences in otherwise similar transition economies provide important lessons for bank privatization in other transition countries and in developing economies. If an independent market-oriented banking sector is the overriding goal, three fundamental conclusions emerge. First, bank restructuring and privatization must be sequenced carefully to create the appropriate incentives for lending on a commercial basis only in the future. Second, privatization requires a credible transfer of proper corporate culture is most easily established by attracting a strategic investor, preferably a <b>foreign</b> <b>financial</b> <b>institution.</b> bank privatization, bad loans, bank restructuring, financial sector reform, transition economies...|$|E
