5|$|Since {{the release}} of nonbenzodiazepines in 1992 in {{response}} to safety concerns, individuals with insomnia and other sleep disorders have increasingly been prescribed nonbenzodiazepines (2.3% in 1993 to 13.7% of Americans in 2010), less often prescribed benzodiazepines (23.5% in 1993 to 10.8% in 2010). It is not clear {{as to whether the}} new nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics (Z-drugs) are better than the short-acting benzodiazepines. The efficacy of these two groups of medications is similar. According to the US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, indirect comparison indicates that side-effects from benzodiazepines may be about twice as frequent as from nonbenzodiazepines. Some <b>experts</b> <b>suggest</b> using nonbenzodiazepines preferentially as a first-line long-term treatment of insomnia. However, the UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence did not find any convincing evidence in favor of Z-drugs. NICE review pointed out that short-acting Z-drugs were inappropriately compared in clinical trials with long-acting benzodiazepines. There have been no trials comparing short-acting Z-drugs with appropriate doses of short-acting benzodiazepines. Based on this, NICE recommended choosing the hypnotic based on cost and the patient's preference.|$|E
25|$|<b>Experts</b> <b>suggest</b> {{that women}} choose a bra band that fits {{well on the}} {{outermost}} hooks. This allows the wearer to use the tighter hooks on the bra strap as it stretches during its lifetime of about eight months. The band should be tight enough to support the bust, but the straps should not provide the primary support.|$|E

This does not exclude fires from being started, but means that these fires will not form into a firestorm, due largely to the differences between modern building materials and that used in World War II era Hiroshima.|$|E

25|$|Elevations in liver transaminases (ALT and AST) {{are common}} {{in the first three}} weeks of treatment. If the patient is {{asymptomatic}} and the elevation is not excessive then no action need be taken; some <b>experts</b> <b>suggest</b> a cut-off of four times the upper limit of normal, but {{there is no evidence to}} support this particular number over and above any other number. Some experts consider that treatment should only be stopped if jaundice becomes clinically evident.|$|E
25|$|The King build close {{relationships}} with the Axis powers in the 1930s - but Afghanistan remained neutral and was neither a participant in World War II nor aligned with either power bloc in the Cold War thereafter. However, it was a beneficiary of the latter rivalry as both the Soviet Union and the United States vied for influence by building Afghanistan's main highways, airports, and other vital infrastructure. On per capita basis, Afghanistan received more Soviet development aid than any other country. Afghanistan had therefore good relations with both Cold War enemies. In 1973, while King Zahir Shah was on an official overseas visit, Daoud Khan launched a bloodless coup {{and became the first}} President of Afghanistan, abolishing the monarchy. In the meantime, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto got neighboring Pakistan involved in Afghanistan. Some <b>experts</b> <b>suggest</b> that Bhutto {{paved the way for the}} April 1978 Saur Revolution.|$|E
25|$|The {{relationship}} between parental attitudes and a child’s self-concept is crucial during the preschool years. It {{has been reported}} that elevated stress levels in mothers correlated with reduced social skills in their children. Strong parent support networks may help to prevent the development of negative self-concept in children with cleft palate. In the later preschool and early elementary years, the development of social skills is no longer only impacted by parental attitudes but is beginning to be shaped by their peers. A cleft lip or cleft palate may affect the behavior of preschoolers. <b>Experts</b> <b>suggest</b> that parents discuss with their children ways to handle negative social situations related to their cleft lip or cleft palate. A child who is entering school should learn the proper (and age-appropriate) terms related to the cleft. The ability to confidently explain the condition to others may limit feelings of awkwardness and embarrassment and reduce negative social experiences.|$|E

500|$|Popular {{landscaping}} authors, including Gertrude Jekyll and Russell Page, have praised P.atriplicifolia for {{its usefulness}} in gardens and landscaping features. It is most commonly planted as an accent feature, {{such as an}} [...] "island" [...] in an expanse of lawn, {{but it can also}} be used as filler within a larger landscaping feature, or to enhance areas where the existing natural appearance is retained. Gardening author Troy Marden describes P.atriplicifolia as having a [...] "see-through" [...] quality that is ideal for borders. Some <b>experts</b> <b>suggest</b> groups of three plants provide the best landscape appearance. It is also suitable for container gardening.|$|E
500|$|Many <b>experts</b> <b>suggest</b> that Sargsyan {{as prime}} {{minister}} was the most powerful politician in Armenia, while others suggest that he had become Armenia's strongest politician long before that. According to Mark Grigorian, his [...] "activities had began to overshadow" [...] Kocharyan. Despite Kocharyan's formal welcome of their alliance, the president was [...] "effectively weakened" [...] and [...] "was being sidelined". Some political analysts suggested that the Sargsyan-Demirchyan alliance [...] "ultimately would bring about the resignation of Kocharyan." [...] Vazgen Manukyan stated that Kocharyan [...] "would end up like the [...] "Queen of England." [...] Despite no longer being the Minister of Defence, Vazgen Sargsyan remained the de facto leader of the army, as a close ally, Vagharshak Harutiunyan, replaced him.|$|E
500|$|The Palaeolithic and Mesolithic periods saw hunter-gatherers {{move into}} the region of Somerset. There is {{evidence}} from flint artefacts in a quarry at Westbury that an ancestor of modern man, possibly Homo heidelbergensis, was present in the area from around 500,000 years ago. There is still some doubt about whether the artefacts are of human origin {{but they have been}} dated within Oxygen Isotope Stage 13 (524,000– 478,000 BP). Other <b>experts</b> <b>suggest</b> that [...] "many of the bone-rich Middle Pleistocene deposits belong to a single but climatically variable interglacial that succeeded the Cromerian, perhaps about 500,000 years ago. Detailed analysis of the origin and modification of the flint artefacts leads {{to the conclusion that the}} assemblage was probably a product of geomorphological processes rather than human work, but a single cut-marked bone suggests a human presence." [...] Animal bones and artefacts unearthed in the 1980s at Westbury-sub-Mendip, in Somerset, have shown evidence of early human activity approximately 700,000 years ago.|$|E

[...] Furthermore, considering that some of these roads seem to go nowhere, <b>experts</b> <b>suggest</b> they can be linked—especially the Great North Road—to astronomical observations, solstice marking, and agricultural cycles.|$|E
2500|$|Disposal {{of nuclear}} waste {{is often said}} to be the Achilles' heel of the industry. Presently, waste is mainly stored at {{individual}} reactor sites and there are over 430 locations around the world where radioactive material continues to accumulate. Some <b>experts</b> <b>suggest</b> that centralized underground repositories which are well-managed, guarded, and monitored, would be a vast improvement. There is an [...] "international consensus on the advisability of storing nuclear waste in deep geological repositories", with the lack of movement of nuclear waste in the 2 billion year old natural nuclear fission reactors in Oklo, Gabon being cited as [...] "a source of essential information today." ...|$|E
2500|$|In India, the male-female {{sex ratio}} is skewed {{dramatically}} {{in favour of}} males, the chief reason being {{the high number of}} females who die before reaching adulthood. Tribal societies in India have a less skewed sex ratio than other caste groups. This is {{in spite of the fact}} that tribal communities have far lower income levels, lower literacy rates, and less adequate health facilities. Many <b>experts</b> <b>suggest</b> the higher number of males in India can be attributed to female infanticides and sex-selective abortions. The sex ratio is particularly bad in the north-western area of the country, [...] particularly in Haryana and Jammu and Kashmir.|$|E

2500|$|Experts {{attribute}} high {{mortality rates}} and under nutrition amongst infants to the decreasing number {{of woman who}} breastfeed. This delay in breastfeeding initiation increases the risk of neonatal mortality. <b>Experts</b> <b>suggest</b> breastfeeding within the first day of birth until the infant is 6-months old. [...] Promotion of breastfeeding during this period could potentially reduce the mortality rates by 16% if infant was breast fed since day one and 22% if the infant was breastfed within the first hour. Rates of breastfeeding initiation vary with ethnicity and socioeconomic situations. Studies suggest that college educated women over their 30 are more likely to initiate breastfeeding in comparison to other women who have different levels of educational attainment.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to immigration, the state, {{federal and local}} prisons of the United States may be {{a contributor to the}} growth of Islam in the country. According to J. Michael Waller, Muslim inmates comprise 15–20% of the prison population, or roughly 350,000 inmates in 2003. Waller states that these inmates mostly come into prison as non-Muslims. He also says that 80% of the prisoners who [...] "find faith" [...] while in prison convert to Islam. [...] These converted inmates are mostly African American, with a small but growing Hispanic minority. Waller also asserts that many converts are radicalized by outside Islamist groups linked to terrorism, but other <b>experts</b> <b>suggest</b> that when radicalization does occur it has little to no connection with these outside interests.|$|E
2500|$|In 2008, {{rock art}} {{depicting}} what {{is thought to}} be a Thylacoleo was discovered on the north-western coast of the Kimberley. As the Thylacoleo is believed to have become extinct 45000–46000 years ago (Roberts et al. 2001) (Gillespie 2004), this suggests a similar age for the associated Bradshaw rock paintings. Archaeologist Kim Akerman however believes that the megafauna may have persisted later in refugia (wetter areas of the continent) as suggested by Wells (1985: 228) and has suggested a much younger age for the paintings. Pigments from the [...] "Bradshaw paintings" [...] of the Kimberley are so old they have become part of the rock itself, making carbon dating impossible. Some <b>experts</b> <b>suggest</b> that these paintings are in the vicinity of 50,000 years old and may even predate Aboriginal settlement.|$|E

This report includes a literature review, consultation with experts regarding the possible trend in injury reduction over the next 30 years from AEB (Autonomous Emergency Braking) and V 2 V (Vehicle-to-Vehicle communication). The <b>experts</b> <b>suggested</b> {{that the most important}} emerging vehicle safety technologies are primary safety systems that provide increasing levels of autonomy, driver warnings and driver monitoring. AEB was consistently identified as having the most potential in the near future, and this was confirmed in the review of literature.

2500|$|It {{is often}} {{said that there are}} as many rats in cities as people, but this varies from area to area {{depending}} on climate, living conditions, etc. Brown rats in cities tend not to wander extensively, often staying within [...] of their nest if a suitable concentrated food supply is available, but they will range more widely where food availability is lower. There is great debate over the size of the population of rats in New York City, with estimates from almost 100 million rats to as few as 250,000. <b>Experts</b> <b>suggest</b> that New York is a particularly attractive place for rats because of its aging infrastructure, high moisture, and high poverty rates. In addition to sewers, rats are very comfortable living in alleyways and residential buildings, as there is usually a large and continuous food source in those areas.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{possible}} explanation for the phenomenon of déjà vu is the occurrence of [...] "cryptomnesia", which is where information learned is forgotten but nevertheless stored in the brain, and similar occurrences invoke the contained knowledge, leading to a feeling of familiarity because the event or experience being experienced has already been experienced in the past, known as [...] "déjà vu". Some <b>experts</b> <b>suggest</b> that memory is a process of reconstruction, rather than a recall of fixed, established events. This reconstruction comes from stored components, involving elaborations, distortions, and omissions. Each successive recall of an event is merely a recall of the last reconstruction. The proposed sense of recognition (déjà vu) involves achieving a good [...] "match" [...] between the present experience and our stored data. This reconstruction, however, may now differ so much from the original event that we [...] "know" [...] we have never experienced it before, even though it seems similar.|$|E
2500|$|Scientific {{investigation}} has not found any histological or physiological evidence for traditional Chinese {{concepts such as}} qi, meridians, and acupuncture points, and many modern practitioners no longer support the existence of life force energy (qi) flowing through meridians, which was {{a major part of}} early belief systems. Acupuncture is believed to have originated around 100BC in China, around the time The Yellow Emperor's Classic of Internal Medicine (Huangdi Neijing) was published, though some <b>experts</b> <b>suggest</b> it could have been practiced earlier. Over time, conflicting claims and belief systems emerged about the effect of lunar, celestial and earthly cycles, yin and yang energies, and a body's [...] "rhythm" [...] on the effectiveness of treatment. Acupuncture grew and diminished in popularity in China repeatedly, depending on the country's political leadership and the favor of rationalism or Western medicine. Acupuncture spread first to Korea in the 6th century AD, then to Japan through medical missionaries, and then to Europe, starting with France. In the 20th century, as it spread to the United States and Western countries, the spiritual elements of acupuncture that conflict with Western beliefs were abandoned in favor of tapping needles into nerves.|$|E
