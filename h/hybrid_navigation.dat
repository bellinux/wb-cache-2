30|$|Within {{the second}} part of the work the FDE scheme is {{evaluated}} within a real <b>hybrid</b> <b>navigation</b> solution using both GNSS and inertial sensor data. As the <b>hybrid</b> <b>navigation</b> solutions are becoming more and more popular for non-aviation applications, mainly due to appearance of relatively cheap inertial sensors of tactical grade, odometer or Doppler velocity measurements, more advanced techniques for Integrity Monitoring (IM) in RBE methods are becoming necessary. In order to assess the performance of the proposed techniques for <b>hybrid</b> <b>navigation,</b> we employ a classical hybrid inertial/GNSS system. This allows the results to be easily extrapolated to other applications such as automotive and outdoor robotics scenarios. Furthermore, the obtained results are based on real operational conditions including the unmodelled GNSS effects and errors in inertial sensors such as misalignment. The performance of the <b>hybrid</b> <b>navigation</b> system with FDE functionality is compared to that of non-FDE loosely-coupled EKF using real measurement data collected during a coastal approach operation with native GNSS faults.|$|E

The on-board navigation algorithm fuses measurements from an IMU, GPS receiver and star tracker with a delayed extended Kalman filter to estimate a navigation solution over time. The in-flight navigation performance is calculated by comparing the navigation solution returned via telemetry to an accurate reconstruction of the trajectory. Trajectory reconstruction combines all available data sent via telemetry, more accurate state transition and measurement models and additional off-line information using the unscented Kalman filter and unscented Rauch-Tung-Striebel backward smoother. The reconstructed trajectory is computed off-line and is much more accurate than the in-flight navigation solution.
