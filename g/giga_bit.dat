To solve these problems a new fiber is introduced for terrestrial high bandwidth deployments: different polymeric core fibers with enlarged effective area with a significant optical {{signal to noise ratio}} improvement over other conventional terrestrial single mode fibers.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the design and {{implementation}} aspects of high data rate digital demodulators. The Existing remote sensing satellites support data rates of several hundred mega bits per second. The future trend is towards <b>giga</b> <b>bit</b> rate transmission. This necessitates for demodulators of the ground receive system to process faster and handle the ever-rising data throughput more efficiently. Different Satellites use different modulation schemes with variable data rates. In order to cater to the Multi mission /Multi-satellite data reception requirements of a ground station, {{it is necessary to}} have greater flexibility and programmability features embedded in the design of demodulators. The demodulation techniques for Binary / Quadrature Phase shift Keying (BPSK / QPSK) are well established and understood when implemented with analog circuits. The BPSK / QPSK can be demodulated by different techniques such as squaring loop, Costas loop and others in analog domain. The Costas loop technique is adopted for developing the digital demodulator because unlike in Square Loop technique, in this the carrier recovery and data demodulation can be done simultaneously with simple blocks level design. The high data rate digital demodulator performs IF amplification, filtering and analog to digital conversion of the received IF signal followed by a Digital demodulator.

40|$|The {{past decade}} has {{witnessed}} rapid proliferation of wireless communications, which continues to enjoy a booming growth driven by unprecedented technology advances and strong consumer demands. New wireless technologies are being developed to provide people with high-speed low-cost multi-mode multi-task wireless communication environments with high quality of service (QoS). Of all the proposed wireless techniques, ultra wideband (UWB) is a promising technology, which becomes a front contender for various extremely high data throughput wireless applications, particularly for wireless video streaming and wireless sea-volume data transformation typically requiring a data speed up to several <b>giga</b> <b>bit</b> per second (Gbps). This dissertation describes research and integrated circuit (IC) implementation of a single-full-band carrier-free impulse-radio ultra wideband (IR-UWB) system. The IR-UWB transceiver adopts a simple-most-digital architecture with low design complexity, aiming to achieve the whole IR-UWB system-on-a-chip (SoC) in standard complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) process. Detail analysis for the IR-UWB system architecture is provided. Critical circuit building blocks, such as pulse generator (PG), BPSK modulation, receiver front-end low-noise amplifier (LNA) and correlator, are described both theoretically and experimentally. Adequate on-chip electrostatic discharge (ESD) protection is required for all IC chips and ESD protection design for radio-frequency (RF) IC emerges as a challenging design task as semiconductor IC technologies continue to advance into the very-deep-sub-micron (VDSM) regime. ESD protection for IR-UWB ICs is more challenging compared with narrow band IC designs. In this thesis, a novel ESD-RFIC co-design technique for UWB ICs was developed and experimentally verified. The interactions between ESD protection unit and core UWB IC were thoroughly investigated. The IR-UWB transmitter, front-end LNA and correlator ICs were designed with full ESD protection using the new ESD-RFIC co-design technique in this work...|$|E

40|$|Ultra-high {{capacity}} {{fiber optic}} systems with data rates exceeding 100 <b>Giga</b> <b>bits</b> per second per fiber {{are currently being}} deployed with higher capacity systems in development. The requirement of a minimum energy per bit for reliable communication means that the power launched into a single fiber is now at a level where significant nonlinearites exist. Nonlinearities can also be produced for lower power intensity-modulated systems because of the square-law nature of sensors. In order to maximize the information capacity, the combined channel that includes a combination of nonlinear impairments along with additional linear impairments must be mitigated. This mitigation {{can be achieved by}} a combination of modulation coding at the transmitter and equalization at the receiver. The development of these techniques for nonlinear channels is significantly more complex than the corresponding techniques for linear channels {{because of the nature of}} the nonlinearity and the extremely high data rate. This rate limits the complexity of the equalization algorithm. This thesis presents modulation coding and equalization techniques for several nonlinear fiber optic channels. We consider two classes of nonlinearity. The first arises from the combination of linear dispersion in an optical fiber and square-law sensing. The second arises from nonlinear propagation characteristics caused by a power-dependent index of refraction change called a Kerr nonlinearity. A variety of nonlinear channel models can be constructed from these two fundamental forms of nonlinearity along with linear impairments. The dominant linear impairment is dispersion. One form occurs when the propagation characteristics for each mode depend on the frequency. A second form of dispersion arises because different polarization modes can have different propagation characteristics. The research premise of this thesis is that a combination of modulation coding, sequence estimation (both single-user and multi-user) and nonlinear equalization based on heuristic algorithms can produce significant performance improvement relative to published techniques. We present several abstracted scenarios reflecting practical systems where a combination of these techniques is effective. We also describe situations where they are ineffective. These results lay the foundation for further work using these techniques to optimize specific nonlinear channels...|$|R
40|$|The {{emergence}} of new optical transmission technologies has led to ultra-high <b>Giga</b> <b>bits</b> per second (Gbps) link speeds. In addition, the switch from 32 -bit long IPv 4 addresses to the 128 -bit long IPv 6 addresses is currently progressing. Both factors {{make it hard for}} new Internet routers and firewalls to keep up with wire-speed packet-processing. By packet-processing we mean three applications: packet forwarding, packet classification and deep packet inspection. In packet forwarding (PF), the router has to match the incoming packet's IP address against the forwarding table. It then directs each packet to its next hop toward its final destination. A packet classification (PC) engine examines a packet header by matching it against a database of rules, or filters, to obtain the best matching rule. Rules are associated with either an "action" (e. g., firewall) or a "flow ID" (e. g., quality of service or QoS). The last application is deep packet inspection (DPI) where the firewall has to inspect the actual packet payload for malware or network attacks. In this case, the payload is scanned against a database of rules, where each rule is either a plain text string or a regular expression. In this thesis, we introduce a family of hardware solutions that combine the above requirements. These solutions rely on a set-associative memory architecture that is called CA-RAM (Content Addressable-Random Access Memory). CA-RAM is a hardware implementation of hash tables with the property that each bucket of a hash table can be searched in one memory cycle. However, the classic hashing downsides have to be dealt with, such as collisions that lead to overflow and worst-case memory access time. The two standard solutions to the overflow problem are either to use some predefined probing (e. g., linear or quadratic) or to use multiple hash functions. We present new hash schemes that extend both aforementioned solutions to tackle the overflow problem efficiently. We show by experimenting with real IP lookup tables, synthetic packet classification rule sets and real DPI databases that our schemes outperform other previously proposed schemes...|$|R

Mass-market applications as Wireless Video Area Network (WVAN) for HDTV signals at 60 GHz, automotive radar and active imaging systems at 80 GHz {{are just some of the}} possible applications for mm-waves. The most relevant challenge for the success of these new class of applications is related with the opportunity of system-on-chip integration in a standard silicon technology, especially CMOS. However, in spite of the latest advance in CMOS technology, the integration into a single chip is an extremely challenging topic of the current research, especially as far as gain and noise requirements are concerned. It is well known that voltage controlled oscillator are the most critical building blocks in high performance Radio Frequency Integrated Circuits (RFICs), especially at the millimeter-waves frequency range. In fact, the succes in the transceiver implementation depends relevantly from the design of such a circuit. The key performance of VCOs is the spectral purity of their output frequency measured in terms of phase noise. Phase noise evaluates the random variation of the phase of the periodical signal produced by a VCO. This thesis has dealt with the design of a novel low phase noise LC voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) implemented according to a novel topology recently proposed in the literature. In particular, a 20 -GHz LC-VCO has been designed in 65 nm CMOS process by ST-Microelectronics for mm-wave applications at 60 GHz.
