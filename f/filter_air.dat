Methods: A double-blind climate chamber {{study was conducted}} on 20 healthy atopic subjects with exposures to <b>filtered</b> <b>air</b> and wood smoke.

Choosing a higher- or lower-efficiency filter than the unit was designed for may decrease its ability to <b>filter</b> <b>air.</b> An exception is when a high efficiency filter does not decrease the fan's airflow rate. This is usually achievable only with physically larger or thicker filters, which usually cannot be used in a unit designed for smaller filters. Filters with efficiencies higher than the original may slow the fan's airflow rate down, which may result in a lower CADR rating.|$|E
50|$|Even {{though the}} term biosorption may be {{relatively}} new, {{it has been}} put to use in many applications for a long time. One very widely known use of biosorption is seen in activated carbon filters. They can <b>filter</b> <b>air</b> and water by allowing contaminants to bind to their incredibly porous and high surface area structure. The structure of the activated carbon is generated {{as the result of}} charcoal being treated with oxygen. Another type of carbon, sequestered carbon, {{can be used as a}} filtration media. It is made by carbon sequestration, which uses the opposite technique as for creating activated carbon. It is made by heating biomass in the absence of oxygen. The two filters allow for biosorption of different types of contaminants due to their chemical compositions — one with infused oxygen and the other without.|$|E
5000|$|Low or high {{relative}} humidity (RH) {{as well as}} rapid changes in {{relative humidity}} can be damaging to paintings. According to the Canadian Conservation Institute, there are four types of incorrect relative humidity. These four types include: Damp, over 75% RH, RH above or below a critical value for that object, RH above 0%, and RH fluctuations. [...] "Generally accepted temperature and relative humidity standards for most museum objects and artifacts are 65°-70° F (18°-21° C) at 47%-55$ RH." [...] The best method of controlling the environment is by using a centralized climate control or HVAC system where incoming air is washed, cleaned, heated, or cooled, adjusted to specific conditions, and then injected into the storage space. An appropriate alternative is a localized climate control system where air conditions cool the air and absorb some of its moisture while filtering out gross particles.

The concentration of CCN remains near zero, until sufficient coagulation and condensation occurs on the smaller Aitken particles. The addition of gaseous pollutants to <b>filtered</b> <b>air</b> results in large increases in the photochemical production of both the cloud and Aitken nucleus concentration.

For hundreds of years, city planners have been using green open spaces as an integrated part of the urban fabric.

Alum acted similar to hydrochloric acid for initializing bubble formation, and higher initial alkalinity, lower final solution pH, and increased mixing rate tended to increase bubble formation. Lastly, the protocol outlined in Standard Methods for predicting the degree of supersaturation was examined, and when compared to this work, the Standard Methods approach produces an error up to 16 % for conditions found in water treatment...|$|E

Chronic effects of both O 3 and sulfur dioxide (SO 2) were studied by isolating fungi from leaves of mature Valencia orange (Citrus sinensis L.) trees.

Populations of Alternaria alternata (Fr.)

In the short-term experiments, seedlings of giant sequoia or California black oak were fumigated in open-top chambers in Sequoia National Park for 9 to 11 weeks with <b>filtered</b> <b>air,</b> ambient air, or ambient air plus O 3.

A significant chamber effect was evident since leaves of giant sequoia and California black oak located outside of chambers had more phyllosphere fungi than did seedlings within chambers. Results suggest that chronic exposure to ambient ozone or SO 2 in polluted areas can affect phyllosphere fungal communities, while short-term exposures may not significantly disturb phyllosphere fungi...|$|R
