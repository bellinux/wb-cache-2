60|$|Lee Barton's <b>heart</b> <b>pounded</b> up. Never {{a mention}} of losing herself. This, then, was love, and all real love, proved true--the great love that forgot self in the loved one.|$|E
60|$|My <b>heart</b> <b>pounded</b> {{within my}} breast as I {{advanced}} toward her--tears {{came to my}} eyes--and the words that would have poured forth in a perfect torrent choked in my throat as I opened my arms and took into them once more the woman I loved--Dejah Thoris, Princess of Helium.|$|E

60|$|My <b>heart</b> <b>pounded</b> {{within my}} bosom until I looked about me in embarrassment, so sure was I that all within the room must hear.

6000|$|Cooper Creek. December, 1960. His <b>heart</b> <b>pounded.</b> That was all {{he needed}} to know. He stood up, shaking himself, {{stamping}} {{his feet on the}} cold ground. The sun had moved across the sky to {{the very edge of the}} hills. He smiled. Already he had discovered the exact time and place. Now he needed only to go back, perhaps to November, to Cooper Creek-- ...|$|E
6000|$|He was surprised. He looked self-conscious. His <b>heart</b> <b>pounded.</b> He {{was still}} more {{agitated}} when the ballots were counted and Gunch said, [...] "It's {{a pleasure to}} announce that Georgie Babbitt {{will be the next}} assistant gavel-wielder. I know of no man who stands more stanchly for common sense and enterprise than good old George. Come on, let's give him our best long yell!" ...|$|E

5000|$|... 'Halt!' The order {{came from}} a soldier {{sitting in front of}} the wooden walkway. Usama stopped, his <b>heart</b> <b>pounding.</b> 'Open your suitcase!'

5000|$|The British {{magazine}} FemaleFirst {{gave the}} film 4 out of 5 stars.

60|$|There {{it was in}} a nutshell. The {{eyes had}} clearly come apart from the rest of him and were on their own. My <b>heart</b> <b>pounded</b> and my breath choked in my windpipe. I had {{stumbled}} on an accidental mention of a totally unfamiliar race. Obviously non-Terrestrial. Yet, to the characters in the book, it was perfectly natural--which suggested they belonged to the same species.|$|E
60|$|Somehow I kept my head, {{even though}} my <b>heart</b> <b>pounded</b> like a hammer and the blood drummed in my ears. It was the thought of Steele that saved me. But I felt cold at the narrow margin. I had reached a point, I feared, where a kiss, one touch from this bewildering {{creature}} of fire and change and sweetness would make me put her before Steele and my duty.|$|E
6000|$|Were {{you ever}} terribly, terribly frightened? That {{was the way}} Chatterer felt. He was caught; {{there was no doubt}} about it! His sharp teeth were of no use at all on those hard wires. He could look out between them, but he couldn't get out. He was too frightened to think. His <b>heart</b> <b>pounded</b> against his sides until it hurt. He forgot all about that queer food he had so wanted to taste, and which was right before him now. Indeed, {{he felt as if he}} never, never would want to eat again. What was going to happen to him now? What would Farmer Brown's boy do to him when he found him there? ...|$|E

60|$|A fence loomed up gray in the obscurity. Jean vaulted it, darted {{across the}} lane into {{the shadow of}} the corral, and soon gained the first cabin. Here he leaned to regain his breath. His <b>heart</b> <b>pounded</b> high and seemed too large for his breast. The hot blood beat and surged all over his body. Sweat poured off him. His teeth were clenched tight as a vise, and it took effort on his part to open his mouth so he could breathe more freely and deeply. But these {{physical}} sensations were as nothing compared to the tumult of his mind. Then the instinct, the spell, let go its grip and he could think. He had avenged Guy, he had depleted the ranks of the Jorths, he had made good the brag of his father, all of which afforded him satisfaction. But these thoughts were not accountable for all that he felt, especially for the bittersweet sting of the fact that death to the defiler of Ellen Jorth could not efface the doubt, the regret which seemed to grow with the hours.|$|E
60|$|On one side, then, {{was this}} {{physical}} torture; {{on the other}} the old hell, terribly augmented at this crisis, in his mind. It seemed that thought and imagination {{had never been so}} swift. If death found him presently, how would it come? Would he get decent burial or be left for the peccaries and the coyotes? Would his people ever know where he had fallen? How wretched, how miserable his state! It was cowardly, it was monstrous for him to cling longer to this doomed life. Then the hate in his heart, the hellish hate of these men on his trail--that was like a scourge. He felt no longer human. He had degenerated into an animal that could think. His <b>heart</b> <b>pounded,</b> his pulse beat, his breast heaved; and this internal strife seemed to thunder into his ears. He was now enacting the tragedy of all crippled, starved, hunted wolves at bay in their dens. Only his tragedy was infinitely more terrible because he had mind enough to see his plight, his resemblance to a lonely wolf, bloody-fanged, dripping, snarling, fire-eyed in a last instinctive defiance.|$|E
5000|$|A rabbit named Shorty with a fast {{high pitched}} voice is running from Pete Puma, until he stumbles down Bugs Bunny's rabbit hole. Shorty tells Bugs his problem ("My <b>heart</b> <b>pounded,</b> my legs trembled, I was frozen with fear"), and Bugs agrees {{to help him}} out. Bugs then {{proceeds}} to play various tricks on Pete who is now outside of Bugs' hole feeling around inside for the little rabbit. Bugs leaves a fake rabbit dynamite decoy which Pete grabs and pulls out of the hole, then BOOM! Bugs goes outside and engages in some small talk with Pete who offers him a cigar ("El Explodo"). After Bugs accepts it (and wisely puts it away before Pete can light it), he asks Pete to stay for tea. He pours tea into two cups, holds up the sugar bowl and asks Pete how many lumps he wants, to which Pete replies [...] "Oh, three or four". Bugs repeatedly hits Pete Puma {{on the head with}} a wooden mallet, producing five lumps on his head which is [...] "one too many". Bugs flattens the extra lump with a reflex hammer, then shoves the explosive cigar into Pete's mouth, lights it and runs off before the explosion.|$|E

5000|$|A hen {{leaves her}} eggs unguarded, and a mean-looking weasel stealthily creeps into the {{henhouse}} while the narrator frets. Just {{as he is}} about to grab the eggs, they all hatch at once, and the chicks shout [...] "BOO!" [...] in unison. The frightened weasel evokes a Joe Penner catch-phrase, [...] "Don't ever DOOO that!" [...] and gasps as his <b>heart</b> <b>pounds.</b>|$|R
5|$|Flashbacks {{throughout}} the episode show the attempts {{of a teenage}} Dexter (Devon Graye) to feel his <b>heart</b> <b>pound.</b> At {{the end of the}} episode, Debra turns on the television in Dexter's apartment and shows him the news: a team of scuba divers in Biscayne Bay has uncovered over 30 garbage bags, each containing parts of Dexter's mutilated victims.

5000|$|Berlioz {{told his}} friend Albert Du Boys that the {{dramatic}} movements (the Kyrie, the Crucifixus, the Et iterum venturus, the Domine salvum, and the Sanctus) {{had the greatest}} impact: When I heard the crescendo {{at the end of}} the Kyrie my chest swelled with the orchestra and my <b>heart</b> <b>pounded</b> in time with the strokes of the timpanist. I don't know what I was saying, but {{at the end of the}} piece Valentino said to me, [...] "My friend, try to keep calm, if you don't want to have me lose my head." [...] Berlioz played the tam-tam in the Et iterum venturus and struck it so hard, that the whole church resounded. The critic of the Quotidienne wrote that in this movement, [...] "M. Berlioz has given untrammeled scope to his imagination." [...] Of the quieter movements, the O salutaris was considered by the critic of the Corsaire to be music [...] "of the noblest and most religious effect". Madame Lebrun of the chorus told Berlioz, [...] "Damn, my boy: now there's an un-worm-eaten O Salutaris, and I defy those little bastards in the counterpoint classes at the Conservatoire to write a movement so tightly knit, so bloody religious." ...|$|E
40|$|It was one o 2 ̆ 7 {{clock in}} the afternoon, and {{the crowd in the}} {{restaurant}} was thining. A dark-haired woman played on an elevated organ, and the waitresses walked wearily between the empty tables, collecting dishes and silverware. Big electric fans moved back and forth with sluggish precision, and stirred the rising cigarette smoke. The restaurant was slowly, almost imperceptibly, becoming enveloped in an atmosphere of lanquorous silence that would last until dinner-time. Two young men sat facing each other across a linen-topped table, and a woman looked at them through the twisted iron grill-work that separated the two tables. The woman, sitting alone at her table, lighted a cigarette. She blew a thin stream of smoke between the lacy bars of the grill-work, and stared at the bright blond heads of the two young men. She looked at the tanned smoothness of their faces, at the slope of their broad shoulders, at the moving muscles in their arms. Her <b>heart</b> <b>pounded</b> painfully, and she felt a tender warmth spreading over her entire body...|$|E
5000|$|Many of the Who's songs, {{especially}} {{songs from}} Who's Next and Quadrophenia, {{need to have}} pre-recorded tapes when performed live. Pridden once said, [...] "I don't trust machines.

60|$|Scarcely {{knowing what}} he did, he walked towards the Earl like a machine, his <b>heart</b> <b>pounding</b> within him and a great humming in his ears. As he drew near, the nobleman {{stopped for a moment}} and stared at him, and Myles, as in a dream, kneeled, and {{presented}} the letter. The Earl took it in his hand, turned it this way and that, looked first at the bearer, then at the packet, and then at the bearer again.|$|R
60|$|Now the {{politicians}} were too wise {{to leave the}} town filled with drunks from the water-front of Oakland. When train time came, there was a round-up of the saloons.

I struggled along heroically, my correlations breaking down, my legs tottering under me, my head swimming, my <b>heart</b> <b>pounding,</b> my lungs panting for air.|$|R

40|$|People {{suffering}} from anxiety disorders hold anxious convictions such as ‘If I feel my <b>heart</b> <b>pounding,</b> I {{am going to}} have a heart attack’. Most often, these people {{have had the opportunity to}} learn that their convictions are untrue. After all, everybody must have felt their <b>heart</b> <b>pounding</b> every now and then, yet in most people this will never have resulted in a heart attack. Still, people {{suffering from}} anxiety disorders firmly believe in this type of anxious convictions. This thesis shows that people suffering from anxiety disorders have a tendency to judge information relevant to their anxiety based on the rough-and-ready rule ‘what I believe is true’. This implicit rule prevents anxious convictions from being corrected, even when disconfirming evidence if widely available. It should be noted that not only people suffering from anxiety disorders make use of this rough-and-ready rule. When judging information regarding strongly held beliefs (like for instance ‘exercising is healthy’), almost everybody makes use of this rule. This thesis shows that people who heavily apply this rule tend to hold on to anxious notions that have been proven untrue longer than people with a lesser tendency to apply this rule. Because of this, people who heavily apply this rough-and-ready rule are at greater risk for developing an anxiety disorder. ...|$|R
