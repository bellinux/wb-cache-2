40|$|Introduction: <b>Transgender</b> <b>women</b> {{are disproportionately}} {{impacted}} by HIV. <b>Transgender</b> <b>women</b> involved in sex work may experience exacerbated violence, social exclusion, and HIV vulnerabilities, {{in comparison with}} non-sex work-involved <b>transgender</b> <b>women.</b> Scant research has investigated sex work among <b>transgender</b> <b>women</b> in the Caribbean, including Jamaica, where <b>transgender</b> <b>women</b> report pervasive violence. The study objective was to examine factors associated with sex work involvement among <b>transgender</b> <b>women</b> in Jamaica. Methods: In 2015, we implemented a cross-sectional survey using modified peer-driven recruitment with <b>transgender</b> <b>women</b> in Kingston and Ocho Rios, Jamaica, in collaboration with a local community-based AIDS service organization. We conducted multivariable logistic regression analyses to identify factors associated with paid sex and transactional sex. Exchanging oral, anal or vaginal sex for money only was categorized as paid sex. Exchanging sex for survival needs (food, accommodation, transportation), drugs or alcohol, or for money along with survival needs and/or drugs/alcohol, was categorized as transactional sex. Results: Among 137 <b>transgender</b> <b>women</b> (mean age: 24. 0 [SD: 4. 5]), two-thirds reported living in the Kingston area. Overall, 25. 2 % reported being HIV-positive. Approximately half (n =  71; 51. 82 %) reported any sex work involvement, this included sex in exchange for: money (n =  64; 47. 06 %); survival needs (n =  27; 19. 85 %); and drugs/alcohol (n =  6; 4. 41 %). In multivariable analyses, paid sex and transactional sex were both associated with: intrapersonal (depression), interpersonal (lower social support, forced sex, childhood sexual abuse, intimate partner violence, multiple partners/polyamory), and structural (transgender stigma, unemployment) factors. Participants reporting transactional sex also reported increased odds of incarceration perceived {{to be due to}} transgender identity, forced sex, homelessness, and lower resilience, in comparison with participants reporting no sex work involvement. Conclusions: Findings reveal high HIV infection rates among <b>transgender</b> <b>women</b> in Jamaica. Sex work-involved participants experience social and structural drivers of HIV, including violence, stigma, and unemployment. <b>Transgender</b> <b>women</b> involved in transactional sex also experience high rates of incarceration, forced sex and homelessness in comparison with non-sex workers. Taken together, these findings suggest that social ecological factors elevate HIV exposure among sex work-involved <b>transgender</b> <b>women</b> in Jamaica. Findings can inform interventions to advance human rights and HIV prevention and care cascades with <b>transgender</b> <b>women</b> in Jamaica...|$|R

40|$|<b>Transgender</b> <b>women</b> often {{suffer from}} transition-related {{discrimination}} {{and loss of}} social support due to their gender transition, which may pose considerable psychological challenges and {{may lead to a}} high prevalence of depression in this population. Increased self-efficacy may combat the adverse effects of gender transition on depression. However, few available studies have investigated the protective effect of self-efficacy on depression among <b>transgender</b> <b>women,</b> and there is a scarcity of research describing the mental health of Chinese <b>transgender</b> <b>women.</b> This study aims to describe the prevalence of depression among Chinese <b>transgender</b> <b>women</b> and to explore the associated factors. A cross-sectional study was conducted in Shenyang, Liaoning Province of China by convenience sampling from January 2014 to July 2014. Two hundred and nine Chinese <b>transgender</b> <b>women</b> were interviewed face-to-face with questionnaires that covered topics including the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS), demographic characteristics, transition status, sex partnership, perceived transgender-related discrimination, the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS) and the adapted General Self-efficacy Scale (GSES). A hierarchical multiple regression analysis was performed to explore the factors associated with SDS scores. The prevalence of depression among <b>transgender</b> <b>women</b> was 45. 35 %. <b>Transgender</b> <b>women</b> with regular partners or casual partners exhibited higher SDS scores than those without regular partners or casual partners. Regression analyses showed that sex partnership explained most (16. 6 %) of the total variance in depression scores. Self-efficacy was negatively associated with depression. Chinese <b>transgender</b> <b>women</b> experienced high levels of depression. Depression was best predicted by whether <b>transgender</b> <b>women</b> had a regular partner or a casual partner rather than transgender-related discrimination and transition status. Moreover, self-efficacy had positive effects on attenuating depression due to gender transition. Therefore, interventions should focus on improving the sense of self-efficacy among these women to enable them to cope with depression and to determine risky sex partnership characteristics, especially for regular and casual partners...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{research}} has consistently found that <b>transgender</b> <b>women</b> experience {{high levels of}} domestic violence and abuse (DVA). Yet, to date, no studies have explored the efficacy of training workshops aimed at increasing the capacity of service providers {{to meet the needs}} of <b>transgender</b> <b>women.</b> This paper reports on findings from one such workshop developed and run in South Australia. Workshop participants (n = 25) from three domestic violence services completed both pre- and post-workshop measures of attitudes towards working with <b>transgender</b> <b>women,</b> comfort in working with <b>transgender</b> <b>women</b> and confidence in providing services to <b>transgender</b> <b>women.</b> In addition, participants responded to open-ended questions regarding terminology, and awareness of referrals related to the link between DVA and animal abuse. Statistically significant changes were identified on all measures, with workshop attendees reporting more positive attitudes, greater comfort and greater confidence after completing the workshop. Analysis of open-ended responses found that attendees developed a better understanding of both appropriate terminology, and referrals for women who present to services with animal companions. We conclude with suggestions for how programmes and services may become more welcoming and inclusive of <b>transgender</b> <b>women</b> experiencing DVA. Damien W.

40|$|Introduction: <b>Transgender</b> <b>women</b> are at {{high risk}} for the {{acquisition}} and transmission of HIV. However, there are limited empiric data characterizing HIV-related risks among <b>transgender</b> <b>women</b> in sub-Saharan Africa. The objective of these analyses is to determine what factors, including sexual behaviour stigma, condom use and engagement in sex work, contribute to risk for HIV infection among <b>transgender</b> <b>women</b> across three West African nations. Methods: Data were collected via respondent-driven sampling from {{men who have sex with}} men (MSM) and <b>transgender</b> <b>women</b> during three- to five-month intervals from December 2012 to October 2015 across a total of six study sites in Togo, Burkina Faso and Côte d'Ivoire. During the study visit, participants completed a questionnaire and were tested for HIV. Chi-square tests were used to compare the prevalence of variables of interest between <b>transgender</b> <b>women</b> and MSM. A multilevel generalized structural equation model (GSEM) was used to account for clustering of observations within study sites in the multivariable analysis, as well as to estimate mediated associations between sexual behaviour stigma and HIV infection among <b>transgender</b> <b>women.</b> Results: In total, 2456 participants meeting eligibility criteria were recruited, of which 453 individuals identified as being female/transgender. <b>Transgender</b> <b>women</b> were more likely than MSM to report selling sex to a male partner within the past 12 months (p< 0. 01), to be living with HIV (p< 0. 01) and to report greater levels of sexual behaviour stigma as compared with MSM (p< 0. 05). In the GSEM, sexual behaviour stigma from broader social groups was positively associated with condomless anal sex (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 1. 33, 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 1. 09, 1. 62) and with selling sex (AOR= 1. 23, 95 % CI= 1. 02, 1. 50). Stigma from family/friends was also associated with selling sex (AOR= 1. 42, 95 % CI= 1. 13, 1. 79), although no significant associations were identified with prevalent HIV infection. Conclusions: These data suggest that <b>transgender</b> <b>women</b> have distinct behaviours from those of MSM and that stigma perpetuated against <b>transgender</b> <b>women</b> is impacting HIV-related behaviours. Furthermore, given these differences, interventions developed for MSM will likely be less effective among <b>transgender</b> <b>women.</b> This situation necessitates dedicated responses for this population, which has been underserved in the context of both HIV surveillance and existing responses...|$|R

2500|$|Breast, nipple, and areolar {{development}} varies considerably {{depending on}} genetics, body composition, age of HRT initiation, {{and many other}} factors. Development can take a couple years to nearly a decade for some. However, many <b>transgender</b> <b>women</b> report {{there is often a}} [...] "stall" [...] in breast growth during transition, or significant breast asymmetry. <b>Transgender</b> <b>women</b> on HRT often experience less breast development than cisgender women (especially if started after young adulthood). For this reason, many seek breast augmentation. Transgender patients opting for breast reduction are rare. Shoulder width {{and the size of the}} rib cage also play a role in the perceivable size of the breasts; both are usually larger in <b>transgender</b> <b>women,</b> causing the breasts to appear proportionally smaller. Thus, when a <b>transgender</b> <b>woman</b> opts to have breast augmentation, the implants used tend to be larger than those used by cisgender women.|$|R
40|$|Background: <b>Transgender</b> <b>women</b> {{experience}} {{higher rates}} of incarceration than their cisgender counterparts, and this cycle of incarceration and poor health is understudied. Lack of continued healthcare, housing, and employment, {{as well as economic}} marginalization, are barriers associated with populations re-entering from incarceration. Additionally, <b>transgender</b> <b>women</b> have unique challenges that may not be addressed in standard re-entry programs. The purpose of this mixed-methods study is to understand the experiences, needs, and resiliencies of previously incarcerated <b>transgender</b> <b>women.</b> Methods: We use qualitative interviews and mapping to describe lack of access to resources, as well as challenges regarding finding housing, accessing healthcare, and meeting probation and parole requirements. We interviewed 6 <b>transgender</b> <b>women,</b> all of whom are previously incarcerated adults residing in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. Additionally, we mapped Allegheny County neighborhoods, mental health providers, and trans-inclusive resources using geographic information system (GIS) software to explore barriers related to transportation and access. Results: Results indicate that access to healthcare, housing, transportation, and trans-inclusive community support are the most significant barriers to successful re-entry. Furthermore, mapping resources, or the lack thereof, and examining the spatial relationship between low-income neighborhoods and proximity to these resources gives us insight to the challenges or resiliencies faced by <b>transgender</b> <b>women.</b> These analyses suggest that <b>transgender</b> <b>women</b> residing outside the central downtown area of Pittsburgh have increased difficulty regarding access to probation and parole offices, trans-inclusive healthcare, and LGBT community spaces. Conclusions: Future multilevel public health interventions should incorporate healthcare, trans-inclusive community support, access to stable housing, and the alleviation of transportation barriers in order to break the cycle of incarceration and poor health for <b>transgender</b> <b>women...</b>|$|R
