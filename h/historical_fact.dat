5|$|Fleance and {{his father}} Banquo are both fictional {{characters}} presented as <b>historical</b> <b>fact</b> by Hector Boece, whose Scotorum Historiae (1526–27) was a source for Raphael Holinshed's Chronicles, {{a history of the}} British Isles popular in Shakespeare's time. In the Chronicles, Fleance—in fear of Macbeth—flees to Wales and marries Nesta, daughter of Gruffydd ap Llywelyn, the last native Prince of Wales. They have a son named Walter who makes his way back to Scotland and is appointed Royal Steward. According to legend, he fathered the Stuart monarchs of England and Scotland.|$|E
5|$|Although Apollonius {{wrote his}} poem in the 3rd century BC, the {{composition}} of the story of the Argonauts is earlier than Odyssey, which shows familiarity with the exploits of Jason (the wandering of Odysseus may have been partly founded on it). In ancient times the expedition was regarded as a <b>historical</b> <b>fact,</b> an incident in the opening up of the Black Sea to Greek commerce and colonization. It was also extremely popular, forming a cycle to which a number of local legends became attached. The story of Medea, in particular, caught the imagination of the tragic poets.|$|E
5|$|The Empire of Japan endeavored, through {{education}} initiatives and specific {{financial support for}} new shrines, to frame Shinto practice as a patriotic moral tradition. From the early Meiji era, the divine origin of the Emperor was the official position of the state, and taught in classrooms not as myth, but as <b>historical</b> <b>fact.</b> Shinto priests were hired to teach in public schools, and cultivated this teaching, alongside reverence for the Emperor and compulsory class trips to shrines. State Shinto practitioners also emphasized the ritual aspect as a traditional civic practice that did not explicitly call on faith to participate.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to view Faulkner's use of history from a {{different}} perspective by examining in detail the myths and <b>historical</b> <b>facts</b> with which Faulkner dealt. First, several of the prevailing myths about the Old South and the Civil War will be examined. Second, the actual <b>historical</b> <b>facts</b> will be compared and contrasted with legendary tradition. Third, and most important, several of Faulkner's works will be examined to show how he uses both the myths and <b>historical</b> <b>facts</b> to create his own "legend" of the South. Finally, Faulkner's view of the New South will be examined...|$|R
5|$|In early 1914, Ruth {{signed a}} {{professional}} baseball contract with Jack Dunn, who owned and managed the minor-league Baltimore Orioles, an International League team. The circumstances of Ruth's signing {{are not known}} with certainty; <b>historical</b> <b>fact</b> is obscured by stories that cannot all be true. By some accounts, Dunn was urged to attend a game between an all-star team from St. Mary's and one from another Xaverian facility, Mount St. Mary's College. Some versions have Ruth running away before the eagerly awaited game, to return in time to be punished, and then pitching St. Mary's to victory as Dunn watched. Others have Washington Senators pitcher Joe Engel, a Mount St. Mary's graduate, pitching in an alumni game after watching a preliminary contest between the college's freshmen and a team from St. Mary's, including Ruth. Engel watched Ruth play, then told Dunn about him at a chance meeting in Washington. Ruth, in his autobiography, stated only that he worked out for Dunn for a half-hour, and was signed. According to biographer Kal Wagenheim, there were legal difficulties to be straightened out as Ruth was supposed to remain at the school until he turned 21.|$|E
5|$|Research into medieval foodways was, until around 1980, a much {{neglected}} {{field of}} study. Misconceptions and outright errors were common among historians, {{and are still}} present in {{as a part of}} the popular view of the Middle Ages as a backward, primitive and barbaric era. Medieval cookery was described as revolting due to the often unfamiliar combination of flavors, the perceived lack of vegetables and a liberal use of spices. The heavy use of spices has been popular as an argument to support the claim that spices were employed to disguise the flavor of spoiled meat, a conclusion without support in <b>historical</b> <b>fact</b> and contemporary sources. Fresh meat could be procured throughout the year by those who could afford it. The preservation techniques available at the time, although crude by today's standards, were perfectly adequate. The astronomical cost and high prestige of spices, and thereby the reputation of the host, would have been effectively undone if wasted on cheap and poorly handled foods.|$|E
5|$|Mughal-e-Azam takes {{numerous}} liberties with <b>historical</b> <b>fact.</b> Historian Alex von Tunzelmann {{says that}} although the real Salim was a heavy consumer of alcohol and opium {{from the age of}} 18, he was not necessarily a mischievous boy, as depicted in the film. When the film's Salim returns from his time in the military, he is depicted as a gentle and romantic hero, in contrast to the real Salim, who was documented as a brutal drunk who would often beat people to death. The real Salim did lead a rebellion against his father, tried to replace him as emperor, and had Akbar's friend Abu al-Fazl murdered in 1602, but the film ascribes these actions to his desire to marry Anarkali, which is historically inaccurate. Further, there were also discrepancies in sets, costumes, and music of the film. The Sheesh Mahal, actually the royal bath of the queen, was depicted in the film as a dancing hall, and much larger. Music and dancing styles from the 19th century were depicted, although the story takes place in the 16th century. For example, thumri, a semi-classical music form developed in the 19th century, is adopted in a dance sequence in Kathak style, which is a 16th-century dance form.|$|E

25|$|In What is Faith? (1925) he {{set before}} him the {{pastoral}} task of anchoring {{faith in the}} <b>historical</b> <b>fact</b> of Christ's atonement.

25|$|These {{accusations against}} the Bahá'í have been disputed, and {{described}} as based on misconceived, or exaggerated interpretations of <b>historical</b> <b>fact.</b> Bahá'u'lláh, {{the founder of}} the Bahá'í Faith, taught that Bahá'ís are to be loyal to one's government, not be involved in politics, and to obey the laws of the country they reside in.|$|E

25|$|The flag in {{question}} had historical significance.

25|$|However, {{this account}} is {{extremely}} short, particularly compared to Paul the Apostle's much fuller {{description of his}} own circumcision in the third chapter of his Epistle to the Philippians.

25|$|It {{is a well}} {{recognized}} <b>historical</b> <b>fact</b> {{that the}} Armenians were the first {{nation in the world}} to formally adhere to Christianity. This conversion was followed in the 4th and 5th centuries by a process of institutionalization and Armenization of Christianity in Armenia. Indeed, Gregory the Illuminator became the organizer of the Armenian Church hierarchy. From that time, the heads of the Armenian Church have been called Catholicos and still hold the same title.|$|E
