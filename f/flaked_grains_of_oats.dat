The material was whole <b>grain</b> <b>of</b> <b>oats</b> (covered cv. Kasztan, dehulled; naked cv. Akt) and their milling fractions: flour and bran. Total dietary fibre (TDF=IDF+SDF) and â-glucans were determined using the Megazyme assay kits. Three groups of Wistar rats (BM 100 ± 3 g), 42 rats each, were used in three 21 d consecutive experiments. The animals were fed hypercholesterolemic (1 % cholesterol) diets (Pisulewski et al. 2002), formulated with increasing amounts of TDF (Exp. 1 : control vs. whole grain 2, 4, 6 %; Exp. 2 : control vs. flour 1, 2, 3 %; Exp. 3 : control vs. bran 2, 4, 6 %). The animals were bled to determine serum total cholesterol (TC), LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C), HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) and triacylglycerols (TG).

These differences can only {{be seen in the}} DP 3 :DP 4 ratio which was higher for barley than for oat and also higher for insoluble than for soluble β-glucan. A greater proportion of barley β-glucan remained insoluble than of oat β-glucan. The molar masses of soluble β-glucans <b>of</b> <b>oats</b> and barley were the same as were those of insoluble β-glucans <b>of</b> <b>oats</b> and barley. To analyse the effects of cooking, baking, fermentation and drying, β-glucan was isolated from porridge, bread and fermentate and also from their starting materials. More β-glucan was released after cooking and less after baking. Drying decreased the extractability for bread and fermentate but increased it for porridge. Different hydrolysis methods of β-glucan were compared. Acid hydrolysis and the modified AOAC method gave similar results. The results of hydrolysis with lichenase gave higher recoveries than the other two. The combination of lichenase hydrolysis and high-performance anion-exchange chromatography with pulse-amperometric detection was found best for the analysis of β-glucan content. The content of insoluble fibre was higher for barley than for oats and the amount of β-glucan in the insoluble fibre fraction was higher for oats than for barley. The flow properties of both water and aqueous cuoxam solutions of oat and barley β-glucans were studied. Shear thinning was stronger for the water solutions of oat β-glucan than for barley β-glucan. In aqueous cuoxam shear thinning was not observed at the same concentration as in water but only with high concentration solutions. Then the viscosity of barley β-glucan was slightly higher than that of oat β-glucan.

40|$|Over {{the past}} few years in Bulgaria there is an {{increasing}} interest in organic production of healthy cereals einkorn and spelt. Typical for them is that they are unpretentious to the soil, resistant to major diseases and pests occurring in cereals. Einkorn and spelt are considered the most ancient types of wheat today and now they are perceived as healthy food. They are distinguished from ordinary wheat in the following parameters: higher percentage of protein; greater amount of fiber, minerals and vitamins /twice higher contents of Vitamin A; vitamins B; calcium, phosphorus, iron, zinc and others/; they do not contain cholesterol. They outmach the common wheat in the content of selenium and antioxidants, the amount of gluten is minimized. It does not cause allergic reactions in people suffering from celiac disease /in which the specific protein is not digested, in this case - gluten/. The reason for this property is the content of only 14 chromosomes as opposed to 28 in the common wheat and 42 in the modern types of wheat, which makes it easy to assimilate. Because of the hard shell <b>flakes</b> the <b>grain</b> <b>of</b> einkorn does not absorb harmful substances from soil /eg heavy metals/ which is a problem in modern wheat varieties.

40|$|A {{glutathione}} (GSH) adduct of the mycotoxin 4 -deoxynivalenol (DON), {{together with}} a range of related conjugates, has recently been tentatively identified by LC-MS of DON-treated wheat spikelets. In this study, we prepared samples of DON conjugated at the 10 - and 13 -positions with GSH, Cys, CysGly, γ-GluCys and N-acetylcysteine (NAC). The mixtures of conjugates were used as standards for LC-HRMS analysis of one of the DON-treated wheat spikelet samples, as well as 19 Norwegian <b>grain</b> samples <b>of</b> spring wheat and 16 <b>grain</b> samples <b>of</b> <b>oats</b> that were naturally-contaminated with DON at concentrations higher than 1 mg/kg. The artificially-contaminated wheat spikelets contained conjugates of GSH, CysGly and Cys coupled at the olefinic 10 -position of DON, whereas the naturally-contaminated harvest-ripe grain samples contained GSH, CysGly, Cys, and NAC coupled mainly at the 13 -position on the epoxy group. The identities of the conjugates were confirmed by LC-HRMS comparison with authentic standards, oxidation to the sulfoxides with hydrogen peroxide, and examination of product-ion spectra from LC-HRMS/MS analysis. No γ-GluCys adducts of DON were detected in any of the samples. The presence of 15 -O-acetyl-DON was demonstrated {{for the first time in}} Norwegian grain. The results indicate that a small but significant proportion of DON is metabolized via the GSH-conjugation pathway in plants. To our knowledge, this is the first report of in vivo conjugation of trichothecenes via their epoxy group, which has generally been viewed as unreactive. Because conjugation at the 13 -position of DON and other trichothecenes has been shown to be irreversible, this type of conjugate may prove useful as a biomarker of exposure to DON and other 12, 13 -epoxytrichothecenes.

40|$|The {{experiments}} have been organized with Phaeozems in the Teleorman Research-Development Agricultural Station and included treatments with urban sludge and manure at rates equivalents of 0; 100; 200; 300 and 400 kg N/ha and mineral fertilizers (N 100). To evaluate {{the amounts of}} nitrogen derived from residual products of the achieved nitrogen balance, an experiment was treated with 15 N {{at a rate of}} 20 kg N/ha coming from ammonium sulphate (15 N. 10 % atom excess). The experiment was built up according to the method of randomized blocks with three replicates. On average, the characteristics of residual products used in experiments are as follows: - Manure: pH – 8. 93, N – 1. 66 %, C – 16. 8 %, P – 0. 54 %, K – 1. 96 %, Na- 0. 12 %, Ca – 0. 48 %, Mg – 0. 77 %, organic matter – 41. 9 %, Cu – 18. 0 mg/kg, Zn – 58. 5 mg/kg, Pb – 27. 4 mg/kg, Ca – 12. 5 mg/kg, Ni – 31. 9 mg/kg, Mn – 5. 61 mg/kg, Cd – 1. 44 mg/kg. - Urban sludge: pH – 6. 76, N – 3. 68 %, C – 27. 8 %, P – 0. 79 %, K – 0. 85 %, Na - 0. 06 %, Ca – 2. 09 %, Mg – 0. 28 %, organic matter – 64. 4 %, Cu – 102 mg/kg, Zn – 505 mg/kg, Pb – 90 mg/kg, Co – 9. 7 mg/kg, Ni – 41. 8 mg/kg, Mn – 406 mg/kg, Cd – 2. 94 mg/kg. Mineral fertilization ensured a yield increase of 8 %, while manure fertilization led to yield increases of 18 - 35 % (depending on rate), while the sludge fertilization to 13 - 46 %. The organic fertilization led to the soil content increase in organic carbon, total nitrogen, mobile phosphorus and potassium. The paper presents data regarding the content of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium and heavy metals (Cu, Zn, Pb, Co, Ni, Mn and Cd) in stems, leaves and <b>grains</b> <b>of</b> <b>oats.</b> Indices <b>of</b> nitrogen uptake from sewage sludge and manure are similar. So, the nitrogen in the oats straw, coming from the sewage sludge varied between 12. 0 and 41 %, and that coming from the manure varied between 18. 1 and 44. 6 %. The nitrogen in the oats grains, derived from the urban sludge, reached values between 12. 7 and 28. 2 %, and that coming from manure reached values between 2. 8 and 38 %. Overall, the nitrogen derived from the sewage sludge varied between 12. 4 and 32. 3 %, and that derived from the manure varied between 8. 7 % and 40. 5 %. The recovering degree of nitrogen in urban sludge varied between 10. 0 % and 13. 5 %, and that from manure varied between 9. 5 and 16. 8 %...|$|R
40|$|Plant {{breeding}} {{has improved}} <b>grain</b> yields <b>of</b> <b>oats</b> in northern growing conditions (Rekunen 1988, Slafer &Peltonen-Sainio 2001). One main contributor to increased yields is harvest index (HI). Cultivars have higher HI and reduced plant height compared to landraces or old cultivars (Peltonen-Sainio 1991). The response <b>of</b> <b>oats</b> to nitrogen fertilizers is also improved (Peltonen-Sainio 1993). The {{aim of this}} study was to identify the changes in nitrogen economy caused by plant breeding in northern growing conditions. In growing season 2003, eighteen oat cultivars (released between 1902 and 2002) were studied in MTT, Jokioinen. Experiment was treated with 70 kg N ha- 1 and soil N content was measured on spring and autumn. Plant samples were collected at maturity and the plants were divided into main shoots and tillers and further to panicles and vegetative mass. The dry weight was measured and samples were grind for N analyses. Nitrogen harvest index (NHI), N utilization efficiency (UTE), N uptake and N use efficiency were calculated from the dry weights and N contents of the plants. On the basis of one year results, plant breeding has only changed the N utilization efficiency, not so much N uptake. There were no significant difference between the cultivars in N use efficiency or in N content of the plant (g N m- 2). Cultivars did not differ in N uptake either. Instead UTE on new cultivars was 38. 4 g g N- 1 while it was 35. 1 g g N- 1 on old cultivars. There was positive correlation between UTE and NHI and also between NHI and HI. The one year results imply that grain yield is more breed quality than N content or N uptake. Peltonen-Sainio, P. 1991. Journal of Agronomy & Crop Science 166 : 90 - 95; Peltonen-Sainio, P. 1993.

5000|$|The {{climate is}} mild, {{with a mean}} annual {{temperature}} of around [...] (January, July, [...] ), and the average annual rainfall is 53 in. Towards {{the middle of the}} 18th century farmers began to raise stock for the south, and a hundred years later 20,000 head of heavy cattle were sent yearly to the English markets. The Galloways, which were the breed in vogue at first, have been to a large extent replaced by shorthorns and Ayrshire dairy cattle. Sheep breeding, of later origin, has attained to remarkable dimensions, the walks in the higher hilly country being given over to Cheviots, and the richer pasture of the low-lying farms being reserved for half-bred lambs, a cross of Cheviots and Leicesters or other long-woolled rams. Pig-feeding, once important, has declined before the imports of bacon from foreign countries. Horse breeding is pursued on a considerable scale. <b>Grain</b> crops, <b>of</b> which <b>oats</b> are the principal, show a downward tendency. Arable farms range from 100 acre to 300 acres (0.4 to 1.2 km²), and pastoral from 300 to 3000 acres (1.2 to 12 km²).|$|R
40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} determine the effects <b>of</b> <b>grain</b> processing, grain sources, protein sources, and bST treatments on lactation performance, ovarian activity and nutrient digestion in early lactation dairy cows. In experiment 1, forty-eight dairy cows were divided into six groups and fed diets containing 37 to 39 % grain as either steam-flaked sorghum (SFS, 360 g/L), steam-flaked corn (SFC, 360 g/L), or steam-rolled corn (SRC, 490 g/L) with one of two protein sources, soybean meal (SBM) or Prolak® for 70 days. Main effects for grain and protein source were not different for DMI, milk yield, 3. 5 % FCM yield or feed efficiency. Although efficiency of feed conversion into FCM did not differ among treatments, cows fed Prolak® required 10 % less NEL for every Mcal of NEL converted into body weight or FCM. Milk protein yield was increased by both flaked gain and Prolak®. Feeding <b>flaked</b> <b>grain</b> increased milk production by 1. 5 kg/d compared with rolled grain. Increasing the ratio of RDS/RDP to more than 2. 4 increased milk yield by 2. 7 kg/d (39. 0 vs 36. 3 kg/d). Plasma NEFA levels did not differ among treatments and grain and protein source had variable effects on PUN. Compared with other grains, SFC increased digestibilities of DM and OM, and <b>flaked</b> <b>grains</b> increased digestibility <b>of</b> starch. Cows fed SFS had the lowest crude protein digestibility, but was highest in NDF. In experiment 2, thirty-two postpartum (5 DIM) Holstein cows were assigned to one of four treatments in a 2 x 2 factorial design for 90 days. Treatments were: steam-flaked sorghum diet with bST (SFS-B); steam-flaked sorghum diet without bST (SFS-N); steam-rolled corn diet with bST (SRC-B); and steam-rolled corn diet without bST (SRC-N). Cows receiving bST during the first 45 days of treatment had lower DMI and DMI as % of BW. Milk yield was increased by bST 3. 1 kg/d and 1. 8 kg/d during the 45 d and 90 d periods, respectively, resulting in greater feed efficiency for bST-treated cows. Grain processing did not affect DMI, milk yield and FCM yield. Neither composition nor yields of milk components were influenced by treatments. Compared to the SRC diet, SFS increased plasma glucose 5 % and plasma insulin 19 %. Grain processing and bST had no effect on either BHBA or hepatic triglycerides. PUN was reduced by bST, but NEFA was increased. Compared with SRC, SFS increased progesterone during the first two postpartum estrous cycles and cows receiving bST had significantly larger CL. Flaked sorghum compared with SRC increased digestibility of DM, OM, and starch, and neither <b>grain</b> affected digestibilities <b>of</b> CP, NDF or ADF. Treatments with bST did not affect any nutrient digestibilities...|$|R
