The camera is placed at the top looking down {{on a series of}} <b>glass</b> <b>panels</b> about a meter deep (one every 25–30cm). The individual <b>glass</b> <b>panels</b> can move horizontally as well as toward and away from the camera (to give the effect of a character moving closer or further away).

5|$|Martin {{was arrested}} {{when he arrived}} at Changi Airport on the evening of 19 March 1995 and {{produced}} a passport with his assumed name, Simon Davis. Police had put the name on their wanted list on 14 March after they determined that Lowe had checked into River View Hotel with someone by that name. In a police interview room in the airport, Martin smashed a <b>glass</b> <b>panel</b> and cut his wrist with a shard of glass in a suicide attempt, fearing that he would be hanged like Flor Contemplacion, a Filipino who had been hanged two days before for a double murder. He was taken to Alexandra Hospital for treatment.|$|E
5|$|Several {{works of}} art bear her likeness. In 1935, Michalina Mościcka, wife of Polish President Ignacy Mościcki, {{unveiled}} a statue of Marie Curie before Warsaw's Radium Institute. During the 1944 Second World War Warsaw Uprising against the Nazi German occupation, the monument was damaged by gunfire; after the war {{it was decided to}} leave the bullet marks on the statue and its pedestal. In 1955 Jozef Mazur created a stained <b>glass</b> <b>panel</b> of her, the Maria Skłodowska-Curie Medallion, featured in the University at Buffalo Polish Room.|$|E

Three days later, he was charged under his real name {{for the murder of}} Gerard Lowe in a River View Hotel room some time between 8 March and 9. In subsequent hearings, he was additionally charged with forgery (forging Lowe's signature five more times to obtain cash and goods worth $3,200), vandalism (smashing the <b>glass</b> <b>panel),</b> possession of an offensive weapon (the electroshock weapon), and possession of a controlled drug (he had 24 sticks of cannabis {{at the time of his}} arrest).|$|E

5|$|The unibody-construction MacBook Pro largely {{follows the}} styling of the {{original}} aluminum iMac and the MacBook Air and is slightly thinner than its predecessor, albeit wider and deeper due to the widescreen display. The screen is high-gloss, covered by an edge-to-edge reflective glass finish, while an anti-glare matte option {{is available in the}} 15- and 17-inch models in which the <b>glass</b> <b>panel</b> is removed. The entire trackpad is usable and acts as a clickable button. The trackpad is also larger than the first generation model's, giving more room for scrolling and multi-touch gestures. When the line was updated in April 2010, inertial scrolling was added, making the scrolling experience much like that of the iPhone and iPad. The keys, still backlit, are now that of Apple's now-standard sunken keyboard with separated black keys.|$|E

25|$|On 11 June 2007, {{the bridge}} was vandalised when persons unknown used a {{sledgehammer}} to smash 46 of the 128 glass panels of the Travellers exhibit. Each <b>glass</b> <b>panel</b> offers information about Australian indigenous peoples or the countries of immigrants to Australia, from Afghanistan to Zimbabwe. It was expected to cost between A$200,000 and A$300,000 to repair and city councillors are considering using more durable materials to replace the glass.|$|E

As a further memorial, the station clock that stopped at 10:25 due to the explosion, has been repaired but permanently set at that time.|$|E

A temporary covered walkway, extending across the plaza to the building's reception, was erected to protect visitors. Engineers examined the other 744 glass panels on the building. The cost of repair was covered by main contractor Skanska and curtain-wall supplier Schmidlin (now called Schmidlin-TSK AG).|$|E

25|$|Klee {{began to}} {{introduce}} a new technique in 1905: scratching on a blackened <b>glass</b> <b>panel</b> with a needle. In that manner he created about 57 Verre églomisé pictures, among those the 1905 Gartenszene (Scene on a Garden) and the 1906 Porträt des Vaters (Portrait of a Father), with which he tried to combine painting and scratching. Klee's solitary early work ended in 1911, the year he met and {{was inspired by the}} graphic artist Alfred Kubin, and became associated with the artists of the Blaue Reiter.|$|E

Awareness is one critical issue, otherwise the available protection tools might be neglected. Among these tools is protective clothing {{in the form of}} a protective apron for the trunk, a protective thyroid shield around the neck and protective glasses. The later may be replaced by a ceiling-suspended lead <b>glass</b> <b>panel.</b> Additional lead curtains can be installed at the table side to protect the lower body region. Even more restrictive rules apply to pregnant staff members.|$|E

The interactive exhibit would feature a triple laminated <b>glass</b> <b>panel</b> which allowed guests to view the lions up close.

While waiting for their coachman to fix it, the two wander into a nearby ancient crypt and discover Asa's tomb. Observing her death mask through a <b>glass</b> <b>panel,</b> Kruvajan breaks the panel (and the cross above it) by accident while striking a bat. He then removes Asa's death mask revealing a partially preserved corpse that is visible underneath, her face staring out malevolently. He cuts his hand on the broken glass. Some of his blood drips onto Asa's dead face.|$|E
25|$|The Klapmeier brothers, Alan Lee Klapmeier (born October 6, 1958) and Dale Edward Klapmeier (born July 2, 1961), are American {{aircraft}} designers, aviation businessmen, {{and entrepreneurs}} who together founded the Cirrus Aircraft Corporation in 1984. Under {{the leadership of}} the Klapmeiers, Cirrus was the first aircraft manufacturer to install a whole-plane parachute recovery system as a standard on all its models—designed to lower the airplane (and occupants) safely to the ground in case of an emergency. The device is attributed with saving over 140 lives to date. Cirrus was also the first to use all-composite airframe construction and <b>glass</b> <b>panel</b> cockpits on production aircraft, which many say revolutionized general aviation for light aircraft pilots.|$|E
