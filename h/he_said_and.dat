5|$|Hughes {{countered that}} he did not believe the wording of the 1957 {{document}} gave Rhodesia the right to devise its own representation overseas without first gaining assent from Britain. The Reedman appointment would probably be seen internationally as a major rise in Rhodesian diplomatic profile, <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>and</b> might damage Britain's reputation, which would in turn make the ongoing negotiations for independence more difficult for both sides. He repeated Bottomley's previous offer of a consul on the British Embassy staff, adding that the official would not have to be physically located within the embassy, and could set up his own office elsewhere so long as he remained nominally affiliated to it.|$|E
5|$|In its secret negotiations, the Committee of Public Safety was {{initially}} unable {{to form a}} consensus concerning the jailed deputies, but as some Girondins fled to the provinces and attempted to incite an insurrection, its opinion hardened. By early July, Saint-Just was able to address the Convention with a lengthy report {{in the name of}} the Committee, and his damning attack left no room for any further conciliation. The Girondins' trials must proceed, <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>and</b> any verdicts must be severe. The proceedings dragged on for months, but Brissot and twenty of his allies were eventually condemned and sent to the guillotine on 31 October 1793. Saint-Just used their situation to gain approval for intimidating new laws, culminating in the Law of Suspects (17 September 1793) which gave the Committee vast new powers of arrest and punishment.|$|E
5|$|The three Britons {{were brought}} to trial on 6 April 1826. Lehuby, still in the Netherlands, was tried in absentia. The Crown prosecution's case was seriously {{hampered}} by his absence, particularly because many key documents were {{with him in the}} Netherlands. The prosecutor alleged a complex conspiracy between MacGregor, Lehuby and their associates to profit personally from a fraudulent land concession and loan prospectus. MacGregor's lawyer, a Frenchman called Merilhou, asserted that if anything untoward had occurred, the missing managing director should be held culpable; there was no proof of a conspiracy, <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>and</b> MacGregor could have been himself defrauded by Lehuby. The prosecutor conceded that there was insufficient evidence to prove his case, complimented MacGregor for co-operating with the investigation fairly and openly, and withdrew the charges. The three judges confirmed the defendants' release—"a full and perfect acquittal", Hippisley would write—but days later the French authorities succeeded in having Lehuby extradited, and the three men learned they would have to stand trial again.|$|E

25|$|The Fifth Dalai Lama's Regent or Desi, Sonam Rapten was, in fact, a fanatical Gelugpa {{supremacist}} {{as well as}} {{a shrewd}} and canny political operator with an eye for the main chance. Being 22 years the Dalai Lama's senior he dominated him as he raised him from the age of 5. In his autobiography The Dukula the lama repeatedly remarks how he had to defer to the Desi, or had to do as <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>and</b> even as an adult he rarely got his way if he disagreed with Sonam Rapten's wishes.|$|E
25|$|The biographical {{material}} {{is to be}} found in chapters 26–29, 32, and 34–44, and focuses on the events leading up to and surrounding the fall of Jerusalem to the Babylonians in 587; it provides precise dates for the prophet's activities beginning in 609 BCE. The non-biographical prose passages, such as the Temple sermon in chapter 7 and the covenant passage in 11:1–17, are scattered throughout the book; they show clear affinities with the Deuteronomists, the school of writers and editors who shaped the series of history books from Judges to Kings, and while it is unlikely they come directly from Jeremiah, they may well have their roots in traditions about what <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>and</b> did.|$|E

25|$|In 1893 {{he refused}} to grant the state Democrats {{permission}} to use the state's ceremonial cannon to fire a salute in celebration of Grover Cleveland's inauguration as President. (Pennoyer had just left the Democratic Party to become the second Populist Party governor in history.) “No permission will be given to use state cannon for firing a salute over the inauguration of a Wall Street plutocrat as president of the United States,” <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>and</b> locked the cannon away under armed guard. The Democrats were able to get hold of the cannon by using an unpaid blacksmith's bill for $10 as a pretext to have the sheriff seize the weapon, and the salute was fired on schedule.|$|E
25|$|After her arrest, she {{was allowed}} to retire early from the LAPD; she {{was held in the}} Los Angeles County Jail. A bail hearing was not held for almost six months. Judge Robert J. Perry {{surprised}} both sides when he set the amount at $10 million in cash, well above what the defense had suggested and more than twice what prosecutors had proposed. The case against her was very strong, <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>and</b> thus she might well be at risk to flee the country or obtain weapons through her husband. Lazarus' lawyer, Mark Overland, said the judge did not understand the case well and contrasted the high figure with the $1 million set for Robert Blake and Phil Spector when they were charged with murder. Several months later, her brother claimed she was not receiving adequate treatment for an unspecified cancer while in custody, either.|$|E
25|$|Rubin faced a major {{budgetary}} {{scandal in}} 2009 and 2010. In fiscal year 2009 (which ended September 30, 2009), DCFEMS spent $11 million on overtime, {{although it had}} budgeted just $5 million. Chief Rubin blamed the problem on extensive firefighter and EMS vacancies, which forced the department to incur overtime. Hiring freezes imposed by the city worsened the situation, <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>and</b> led to even more overtime. Rubin warned the D.C. City Council in November 2009 that fiscal 2010 overtime expenditures would be about $8 million, although the council had approved an overtime budget that remained steady at just $5 million. To avoid going over budget, Rubin claimed that shutting down the fire training academy and the building inspection division, closing several fire stations, and reducing staffing on fire trucks {{was the only way}} to rein in these costs. City council members disputed his claim.|$|E

25|$|Starting in August 1896, Rhodes {{personally}} {{played a}} key role in ending the Matabele insurgency. With one of the widows of Mzilikazi (Lobengula's father) acting as a go-between, the Company and the rebel izinDuna arranged an indaba for 21 August: the izinDuna agreed to meet Rhodes and three companions in the Matopos Hills. At this meeting, the insurgents vehemently protested against their prior treatment under Company rule, prompting Rhodes to walk away from the other whites and to sit among the Matabele instead, apparently intending to symbolically demonstrate empathy and a spirit of reconciliation. He told the Matabele that he was on their side, and that he would personally ensure the non-recurrence of any abuses. The izinDuna would be fully restored to the status they had held under Lobengula, <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>and</b> there would be no retribution against those who had taken part in the Chimurenga. After four hours, it was agreed to continue the talks. Bitterness endured among some of the rebels, but three further indabas progressed well, and the Matabele rising ended amicably in October 1896.|$|E
500|$|Vladimir Bukovsky, {{well known}} for his {{struggle}} against political abuse of psychiatry in the Soviet Union, explained that using psychiatry against dissidents was usable to the KGB because hospitalization {{did not have an}} end date, and, as a result, there were cases when dissidents were kept in psychiatric prison hospitals for 10 or even 15 years. [...] "Once they pump you with drugs, they can forget about you", <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>and</b> added, [...] "I saw people who basically were asleep for years." ...|$|E
500|$|Willkie {{never had}} any doubt that Roosevelt would run for a third term, and that his route to the White House {{would have to be}} through the Republican Party. [...] In late 1939 he changed his {{registration}} from Democratic to Republican, and early in 1940 announced that he would accept the Republican nomination if it were offered to him. [...] He blamed his allegiance shift on the Roosevelt policies that he deemed anti-business. He had voted for Landon in 1936, <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>and</b> he felt that the Democrats no longer represented the values he advocated. [...] As he later characterized it, [...] "I did not leave my party. [...] My party left me." ...|$|E

500|$|In Clark's book, Winning Modern Wars, {{published}} in 2003, {{he describes his}} conversation with a military officer in the Pentagon shortly after 9/11 regarding a plan to attack seven Middle Eastern countries in five years: [...] "As I went back through the Pentagon in November 2001, one of the senior military staff officers had time for a chat. Yes, we were still on track for going against Iraq, he said. But there was more. This was being discussed {{as part of a}} five-year campaign plan, <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>and</b> there were a total of seven countries, beginning with Iraq, then Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and finishing off Iran." [...] Wesley regards the 2003 invasion of Iraq as [...] "a huge mistake".|$|E
500|$|In 1926, the American Roswell Eldridge {{offered a}} dog show class prize of twenty-five pounds each as a prize {{for the best}} male and females of [...] "Blenheim Spaniels of the old type, as shown in {{pictures}} of Charles II of England's time, long face, no stop, flat skull, not inclined to be domed, with spot in centre of skull." [...] The breeders of the era were appalled, although several entered what they considered to be sub-par Cavalier King Charles Spaniels in the competition. Eldridge died before seeing his plan come to fruition, but several breeders believed in what <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>and</b> in 1928 the first Cavalier club was formed. The first standard was created, based on a dog named [...] "Ann's Son" [...] owned by Mostyn Walker, and the Kennel Club recognised the variety as [...] "King Charles Spaniels, Cavalier type".|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, {{outside the}} Pearl, Eko sees Yemi and follows {{him into an}} open field, where Yemi tells him {{it is time for}} Eko to confess his sins. Eko says he has not sinned, having not chosen the life he was given and that Eko had only done what he needed to do to survive. An angry-looking Yemi replies, [...] "You speak to me as if I were your brother" [...] as he retreats into the jungle. Eko follows him asking [...] "Who are you?!", and then finds the smoke monster. An arm of smoke attacks Eko, beating him into trees before he is slammed into the ground. Locke and the others rush out of the station to find a bloodied Eko. Locke {{approaches}} Eko, who whispers his dying words into Locke's ears. Sayid asks what <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>and</b> Locke replies, [...] "We're next." ...|$|E

500|$|The notes {{range from}} nearly {{insignificant}} details to major discrepancies and deliberate distortions. [...] They have a self-deprecatory tone that {{is common in}} North American comics, tracing its roots to the awkwardly self-aware underground comix of the 1960s and 1970s. [...] They also reveal Brown's process in shaping the story from conflicting sources. [...] He acknowledges {{some of the more}} capricious details. [...] He explains he was not committed to the conspiracy theory he presented, but included it in order to present Macdonald in a certain light: [...] "illains are fun in a story", <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>and</b> he was [...] "trying to tell this tale in an engaging manner". [...] He also included a [...] "Major-General Thomas Bland Strange" [...] in an 1885 meeting at which the general was not actually present. [...] Brown explains that he included Strange because he was amused by the Major-General's name.|$|E
500|$|Todd's {{long hair}} was also {{integral}} to the character. It was described by Soap Opera Magazine as [...] "enigmatic, {{with an air of}} innate authority". The hair was said to demonstrate Todd's lack of pretense and to convey an [...] "I don't care" [...] attitude. [...] Todd's [...] "overhanging brow" [...] seemed threatening, but instead concealed the [...] "intense, vulnerable eyes underneath", features that contrasted well with the character's [...] "pouty, sensual mouth". The features, which conferred [...] "a charming, boyish quality", could sometimes convey that Todd was less dangerous than he actually was. Photographer Robert Milazzo believed Howarth's hair softened Todd's character. [...] "You don't expect that intensity because of it," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>and</b> felt that it made Todd more intriguing. Milazzo also stated that the combination of Todd's soft hair and intensity made Todd [...] "a very complex character to look at".|$|E
500|$|Gregg Allman {{recorded}} [...] "Melissa" [...] {{primarily as}} a tribute to his brother, who adored the song; the song was written in 1967 while staying in a hotel in Pensacola, Florida {{and was one of the}} first he saved after dozens of writing attempts. Allman had previously not shown it to other members of the band ("I thought it was too soft for the Allman Brothers," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said),</b> <b>and</b> was saving it for a possible solo album he assumed he would one day record. [...] "One Way Out" [...] was recorded on June 27, 1971 at the band's final concert at the Fillmore East, which was shut down after that date, and [...] "Trouble No More" [...] and [...] "Mountain Jam" [...] were culled from the band's March performances. [...] "Mountain Jam" [...] was always intended for inclusion on the band's next album; the band teased its appearance by including the opening seconds on the fade-out of the final song on At Fillmore East. The band considered it a signature song of the group, but they deemed the performance that was recorded relatively mediocre.|$|E
