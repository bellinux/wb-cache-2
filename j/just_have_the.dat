25|$|From 1989 until 2005, it {{was common}} {{practice}} for the Marching Band to only purchase a few new uniforms each season to replace badly worn, damaged, or lost pieces. The Fruhauf Company made these small batches of uniforms. In 2005, a benefactor to the OSUMB donated {{a significant amount of}} money to buy new uniforms for the entire band. The benefactor wanted to uniform the entire band and not <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> money used for replacement uniforms. Dr. Jon Woods decided that additional small changes would help to give the band a new, fresh look for the 2006 season. The minimal changes include updated sleeve stripes (new stripes consist of one red and one gray stripe) to minimize the wearing out that the old stripes suffered, uniform patch alignment, and a slit placed underneath the left breast pocket flap for the snare drums to attach their drums through (the common practice through band history was to cut a hole underneath the pocket flap to allow the attachment clip to pass through the uniform).|$|E
500|$|Though {{the rivalry}} cooled, the two clubs were still {{involved}} in engrossing battles; The Guardians Jamie Jackson wrote after a November 2007 fixture: [...] "For once here was enough spectacle {{to meet the}} pre-match hype and convince the millions watching {{around the world that}} the Premier League may <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> best footballers who can play the very best stuff." [...] In 2009, the teams met in the semi-finals of the 2008–09 UEFA Champions League, which United won 4–1 on aggregate. United defender Patrice Evra was blunt in his post-match assessment: [...] "It was 11 men against 11 children. We never doubted ourselves. We have much more experience and that's what made the difference." ...|$|E

[...] Christine Beddoe, director of End Child Prostitution, Pornography and Trafficking, criticised Glitter and said he was trying to [...] "minimise what he has done", and added, [...] "We must allow children to tell their story and not <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> words of Gadd." ...|$|E
2500|$|Just {{prior to}} the game's release, PC Gamer writer Stefan Dorresteijn {{contacted}} professional eSports players and hosts for their opinions. Longtime eSports host Paul Chaloner stated that [...] " [...] needs a much better spectator system," [...] going on to elaborate, [...] "Right now, it's incredibly difficult for commentators and viewers to see {{the skills of the}} players: who used their ultimates and how did they interact? Who is on cooldown and who has changed hero?" [...] Fellow eSports player Seb Barton and Michael Rosen criticized the game's map designs and game modes; Barton remarked that [...] "the game modes are a little hit and miss," [...] adding that [...] "King of the hill [...] is super exciting and fast paced but then you have the payload [...] maps, which are just a snoozefest for everyone involved." [...] Rosen expressed a need for tweaking to the maps used for the control game mode, as they are [...] "just too prone to the snowball effect. The moment the attacking team captures the first control point they don't <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> momentum but also the last advantage for the second and final capture point." ...|$|E
