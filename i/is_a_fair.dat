5|$|Struthiosaurinae {{is one of}} the longest-lasting {{groups of}} ankylosaurians. They range from Europelta at 112 Ma to Struthiosaurus, which lived until the {{uppermost}} Cretaceous, or 66 Ma. In between those two early and late struthiosaurines are the genera Anoplosaurus and Hungarosaurus. Hungarosaurus is younger, at about 85 Ma, from the late Santonian of the Csehbánya Formation. Anoplosaurus <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> amount older, at about 100 Ma, from the late Albian Cambridge Greensand.|$|E
5|$|Zinc is a bluish-white, lustrous, {{diamagnetic}} metal, {{though most}} common commercial grades {{of the metal}} have a dull finish. It is somewhat less dense than iron and has a hexagonal crystal structure, with a distorted form of hexagonal close packing, in which each atom has six nearest neighbors (at 265.9 pm) in its own plane and six others at a greater distance of 290.6 pm. The metal is hard and brittle at most temperatures but becomes malleable between 100 and 150°C. Above 210°C, the metal becomes brittle again and can be pulverized by beating. Zinc <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> conductor of electricity. For a metal, zinc has relatively low melting (419.5°C) and boiling points (907°C). The melting point is the lowest of all the d-block metals aside from mercury and cadmium; for this, among other reasons, zinc, cadmium, and mercury are often {{not considered to be}} transition metals {{like the rest of the}} d-block metals are.|$|E

I can't get out of my head why Test matches are so different from State matches, where I think England played pretty well. It is all so different from what we visualised. After all this talk of brighter cricket I think we should get back to playing cricket. Perhaps a little more action and less talk.|$|E
25|$|The {{philosophy}} of Cumberland is expounded in De legibus naturae. Its main design is {{to combat the}} principles which Hobbes had promulgated as to the constitution of man, the nature of morality, and the origin of society, and to prove that self-advantage is not the chief end of man, that force is not the source of personal obligation to moral conduct nor the foundation of social rights, and {{that the state of}} nature is not a state of war. The views of Hobbes seem to Cumberland utterly subversive of religion, morality and civil society. He endeavours, as a rule, to establish directly antagonistic propositions. He refrains, however, from denunciation, and <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> opponent up to the measure of his insight.|$|E
25|$|There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> {{chance of}} snow {{earlier in the}} season when {{temperatures}} are colder - often in March. Some of the country's heaviest snowfalls of recent years have happened {{in the first half of}} March, and snow showers can occur infrequently until mid-April. They have been known to develop as late as mid-May over some areas of the country, such as in 2013 when snow was recorded on 14 May over parts of Staffordshire, Herefordshire and Wales. Snow was also recorded at lower levels in early June 1975. More recently, there was a disruptive snow event between 26 and 29 April 2016 across much of Northern England and Scotland, which was unusually the only significant snow event of the winter 2015/16. Snow, frost and ice can be disruptive and damaging to flowering plants, particularly later in the spring.|$|E
