5|$|Local {{farm workers}} were first on scene. Eric Webb was {{stacking}} hay. When he realised that the aircraft {{was about to}} crash he ran to help. He was joined by P Richards, {{who had been working}} on a tractor in a <b>farmyard</b> less than 100 yards from the crash site.|$|E
5|$|Richards {{found one}} dog alive in its cage and {{released}} it. Webb found another suffering from burns and hiding behind a <b>farmyard.</b> An RSPCA inspector later arrived {{and took the}} injured dog to a vet in Abingdon. One badly injured dog was put down. Six dogs were found dead in the wreckage.|$|E
5|$|The monastery, {{which is}} next to the River Washford, would have been {{surrounded}} by gardens, fishponds, orchards, barns, guesthouses, stables, a <b>farmyard</b> and industrial buildings. The abbey grounds were defended by a water filled moat and a gatehouse. Excavation has revealed that a large stone cross, like a market cross, stood {{just west of the}} main building.|$|E

5|$|The {{house of}} one of the farmworkers was at the crash site. He first ran to his house, where he found that his wife had survived and was safe. Richards rescued one man from the {{wreckage}} and put him by an apple tree. Another survivor was on fire. In a contemporary inverview one of the rescuers says the survivor came running across the <b>farmyard.</b> 60 years later Richards said he rescued the survivor from the aircraft. Accounts agree that rescuers put the survivor in a horse trough to extinguish the flames and cool his burns.|$|E
5|$|The tale {{begins in}} a <b>farmyard</b> which {{is home to}} a duck called Jemima Puddle-duck. She wants to hatch her own eggs, but the farmer's wife {{believes}} ducks make poor sitters and routinely confiscates their eggs to allow the hens to incubate them. Jemima tries to hide her eggs, but they are always found and carried away. She sets off along the road in her poke bonnet and shawl to find a safe place away from the farm to lay her eggs.|$|E
5|$|Blyton's granddaughter, Sophie Smallwood, wrote a new Noddy book to {{celebrate}} the character's 60th birthday, 46 years after the last book was published; Noddy and the <b>Farmyard</b> Muddle (2009) was illustrated by Robert Tyndall. In February 2011, the manuscript of a previously unknown Blyton novel, Mr Tumpy's Caravan, was discovered by the archivist at Seven Stories, National Centre for Children's Books {{in a collection of}} papers belonging to Blyton's daughter Gillian, purchased by Seven Stories in 2010 following her death. It was initially thought to belong to a comic strip collection of the same name published in 1949, but it appears to be unrelated and is believed to be something written in the 1930s, which had been rejected by a publisher.|$|E

50|$|The Estonian Open Air Museum (Eesti Vabaõhumuuseum) is a life-sized {{reconstruction}} of an 18th-century rural/fishing village, which comes complete with church, inn, schoolhouse, several mills, a fire station, twelve <b>farmyards</b> and net sheds. The site spans 72 hectares {{of land and}} contains about 80 separate buildings and is located 8 km {{to the west of}} Tallinn city center at Rocca al Mare. Established in 1957, the museum showcases 68 farmhouses assembled into twelve <b>farmyards</b> from North, South and West Estonia.|$|R

5|$|Soon after Cleeve became Crown property, it was leased to Anthony Busterd for 21years. In 1538, the {{freehold}} of {{the site}} was granted to Robert Radcliffe, 1st Earl of Sussex. The church was demolished, save for the south wall which bounded the cloister, {{and the rest of}} the abbey converted into a mansion suitable for a gentleman. By the early seventeenth century, however, Cleeve had turned into a farm. The dormitory was now a large barn, the cloister was the <b>farmyard</b> {{and the rest of the}} buildings were used for agricultural purposes and a farm house. A red sandstone barn was built which abuts the south-west corner of the abbey.|$|E
5|$|Command of the Amazon {{then passed}} to Captain Samuel Sutton, who was succeeded the {{following}} year by Captain William Parker. Under Parker, Amazon captured the 16-gun privateer Felix on 26 July 1803, and survived a brush with a French fleet off Cape Capet on 2 May 1804. Amazon {{was one of the}} ships {{to take part in the}} Trafalgar Campaign {{the following year}}, serving with Nelson in the Mediterranean. On one occasion in December 1804 Nelson ordered Parker to bring a consignment of live bullocks to supply the fleet off Toulon. The Amazon was a notably smart ship, and had just been repainted, so presumably the instruction to convert his ship into a floating <b>farmyard</b> was not received with much enthusiasm. Parker duly returned with a shipment, prompting Nelson to enquire with gentle humour 'Well, Parker, of course you would not dirty the Amazon for much for anything; have you brought a dozen and a half, or a dozen?' Parker had in fact brought sixty bullocks and thirty sheep, prompting Nelson to promise a reward for his good service.|$|E
5|$|In this {{relatively}} liberal environment Jan accompanied the servants in their work, {{listening to their}} stories, learning {{the ways of the}} countryside, and trying to help as best he could. As his knowledge and confidence increased Jan began {{to go out into the}} countryside by himself, exploring the hills and valleys which surrounded him. Later, as an older boy, his chief responsibility was as a herd — first of the pigs and poultry in the <b>farmyard,</b> and later of the cattle out on the veld. The same laws of custom which had preordained Jan's role as a farmer also had their beneficial aspect; Boer farmers customarily allotted their sons a share of the natural increase of the beasts under their care. As time passed Jan gradually built up a respectable holding of livestock.|$|E

5|$|The Buckeye is {{the only}} purely American breed to sport a pea comb, and this, {{combined}} with its stocky build, makes it a supremely cold hardy chicken. Other breeds of fowl developed in the U.S. (such as the Ameraucana) may sport pea combs, but these chickens were primarily created from foreign birds. It also bears some traits of Game fowl in frame and disposition, being assertive in character {{and a very good}} forager. Generally calm, the cock birds in rare cases may become aggressive. Despite its game heritage, it tolerates confinement well, although it will be much happier and produce better if allowed to range on grass. The Buckeye is said by breeders to be disinclined towards feather picking. A good meat producer and layer of between 150 and 200 eggs per year, the Buckeye is a dual purpose chicken wellsuited to small <b>farmyard</b> and backyard flocks.|$|E

50|$|Hovgården {{is located}} on the flat country north-west of the Romanesque Adelsö Church, characterised by a narrow rift valley {{stretching}} north to forest-laden moraines.

25|$|After combining, the oats are {{transported to}} the <b>farmyard</b> using a grain truck, semi, or road train, where they are augered or {{conveyed}} into a bin for storage. Sometimes, when {{there is not enough}} bin space, they are augered into portable grain rings, or piled on the ground. Oats can be safely stored at 12-14% moisture; at higher moisture levels, they must be aerated or dried.|$|E
25|$|Most of the {{artefacts}} recovered are of 19th-century origin.

40|$|Thirty-six {{farms in}} parishes in western England that had {{recently}} experienced herd breakdowns of bovine tuberculosis were surveyed {{for signs of}} badger activity and for husbandry practices relating to the access of badgers to the farm buildings and facilities. Signs of activity were detected within the <b>farmyards</b> and buildings of 14 of the farms and were associated with water troughs at pasture on two of them. Few of the farmers implemented practices to reduce contact between badgers and cattle. Stored cattle feed was freely accessible to wild animals in 88 per cent of the feed stores. Two badger carcases, and two of 66 samples of badger droppings, cultured positive for Mycobacterium bovis. Signs of badgers within <b>farmyards</b> were significantly positively associated {{with the number of}} badger setts and latrines in the immediate vicinity, but were not related to any recorded farm husbandry procedures...|$|R
