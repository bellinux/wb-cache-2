60|$|Here, {{now that}} the gentlemen were alone, there was an inspiring {{largeness}} in their talk that fired the imagination. The subject was investments, at first those of coal and iron <b>in</b> <b>my</b> own <b>state,</b> for Mr. Watling, it appeared, was counsel for the Boyne Iron Works.|$|R
