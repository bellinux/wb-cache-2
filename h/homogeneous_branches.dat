40|$|The latest {{charge against}} parsimony in phylogenetic {{inference}} {{is that it}} involves estimating too many parameters. The charge {{is derived from the}} fact that, when each character is allowed a branch length vector of its own (instead of the <b>homogeneous</b> <b>branch</b> lengths assumed in current likelihood models), the results for likelihood and parsimony are identical. Parsimony, however, can also be derived from simpler models, involving fewer parameters. Therefore, parsimony provides (as many authors had argued before) the simplest explanation of the data, or the most realistic, depending on one's views. If (as argued by likelihoodists) phylogenetic inference is to use the simplest model that provides sufficient explanation of the data, the startingpoint of phylogenetic analyses should be parsimony, not maximum likelihood. If the addition of new parameters (which increase the likelihood) to a parsimony estimation is seen as desirable, this may lead to a preference for results based on current likelihood models. If the addition of parameters is continued, however, the results will eventually come back to the same place where they had started, since allowing each character a branch length of its own also produces parsimony. Parsimony can be justified by very different types of models— either very complex or very simple. This suggests that parsimony does have a unique place among methods of phylogenetic estimation...|$|R

This study aimed to model the branching patterns of 2 -year-old proleptic shoots on three almond cultivars (Nonpareil, Aldrich, and Winters) representing different tree architectures. The effects of branching pattern on flowering were also studied. The branching patterns of shoots of different length categories were assessed by a single hidden semi-Markov model for each cultivar. The models identified zones of <b>homogeneous</b> <b>branching</b> composition along shoots and were used to extract the occurrence and number of nodes of the zones according to shoot length categories. The numbers of flower buds were also determined for each shoot length category in each cultivar. The models of branching patterns of 'Nonpareil' and 'Aldrich' were similar and differed from the 'Winters' model. 'Winters' shoots produced more zones, but some of the zones had similar characteristics as previous zones and thus appeared to be repeated. This cultivar also had more spurs and sylleptic shoots than the other cultivars. The occurrence and node number of the central zones decreased along with reduction in shoot length in all the cultivars. 'Aldrich' tended to have more flower buds than comparable-length shoots of the other two cultivars. This study provides a quantitative description of the shoot branching patterns of three important cultivars and explains how branching changes in relation to shoot length, whereas production of flower buds varies despite similar branching patterns...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{addresses}} the crystallization behavior of <b>homogeneous</b> <b>branched</b> polyethylenes, where the branches cannot be incorporated within the lattice. The polymer {{was chosen to}} investigate the morphology achievable by polymers where the chains cannot extend, which {{is considered to be}} a requisite to minimize the surface free energy. Pressure-temperature conditions similar to those necessary to form extended chain crystals in linear polyethylenes are applied. In-situ wide-angle X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy are used to follow the structural and conformational changes during crystallization. The hexagonal phase is not observed in these polymers unlike in linear polyethylene. However, crystallization at elevated pressures results in a structural organization of the interphase and the fold surface; this provides adjacent reentry, where the branches will also possess structural order. Crystallization of these components leads to the formation of an incompressible open-orthorhombic phase (a = 7. 56 Å, b = 5. 03 Å, c = 2. 55 Å, density = 960 kg/m 3) in addition to the existing orthorhombic crystalline domain. With the crystallization of the chains at the interphase and on the fold surface, a contraction in the parent orthorhombic phase or its transformation into the monoclinic phase is observed. Our experimental data suggest that in such a class of polymers the thermodynamically stable state will be crystals with an ordered interphase that can be achieved ultimately by disentanglement of the chains in the amorphous region. The disentangled nature of the amorphous component is further supported by solid-state mechanical deformation of samples...|$|R

Two months after planting vacuum-infiltrated seed tubers, a high percentage of the plants (more than 30 %) showed typical symptoms, whereas water-treated plants remained disease-free (Fig. 2).

40|$|International audienceIn Cupressaceae, new lateral shoots are {{not present}} at each node ('continuous branching'), {{nor are they}} {{obviously}} grouped in regularly spaced tiers ('rhythmic branching'). Thus, branching pattern in Cupressaceae {{is referred to as}} 'diffuse', although this does not imply that the spatial arrangement of sibling shoots along an axis is completely unpredictable or random. For example, some taxa exhibit regularly alternate branched and unbranched nodes in some axis categories (such as trunk, branch, twig, twiglet), with sibling shoots arranged in a single plane. However in most cases, branching patterns seem more complex or disturbed due to background noise. In order to characterize their variability within the family, we studied different axis categories for several species and genera (Cupressus spp., Austrocedrus chilensis, Pilgerodendron uviferum and Fitzroya cupressoides). Axes were described as a set of sequences, in which index parameters were the node ranks and attached variables were the number of twigs (for a given phyllotaxis). In opposite-decussate phyllotaxy for instance, 0, 1 or a maximum of 2 sibling shoots can develop per node and their arrangement along an axis can be resumed as a succession of 0, 1 or 2 (ex : 10101101020 ). Using statistical models such as variable-order Markov chains and hidden semi-Markov chains, we highlighted hidden regularities and quantified morphological observations. Along axes, we identified <b>homogeneous</b> <b>branching</b> zones defined by contrasted proportions of the number of sibling shoots per node. We also observed that each zone comprised remarkable patterns in the succession of number of sibling shoots (for instance, a mixture of 101001 and 2002).

The genetic make-up of different cultivars controls vegetative and reproductive growth, but few structural {{studies have been}} done to systematically describe almond shoot structure. A specific class of Markovian models, referred to as hidden semi-Markov chains (HSMC), has been proposed to identify and characterize branching and flowering patterns in fruit trees. This type of model is particularly appropriate when the shoot structure is organized as a succession of <b>homogeneous</b> <b>branching</b> zones and captures the variable character of the observed patterns. This study reports the first almond HSMC analysis of shoot structure based on data collected from epicormic shoots and five length categories of proleptic shoots in three almond cultivars with distinctly different tree architecture. 'Nonpareil' is the most important cultivar grown in California and has a relatively spreading tree habit. 'Aldrich' is a newer cultivar with an upright growth habit, and 'Winters' has a spreading habit with a high tendency for sylleptic branching on proleptic shoots. Shoots of these three cultivars were analyzed to determine different zones that could be classified according to lateral bud fates and the number of flower buds at each node. This modeling technique showed that almond shoot structures are highly organized and predictable. Substantial differences were found {{in the structure of the}} proleptic shoots of similar length, among the cultivars, but fewer differences were found among epicormic shoots. For long shoots, 'Aldrich' had the highest probability of flower buds and 'Winters' had the greatest lateral branching distributed along shoots. 'Nonpareil' had similar branching probabilities as 'Aldrich' and its probability of flower buds was similar to 'Winters'. It is anticipated that these HSMC will be useful for identifying desirable shoot structures for cultivar improvement and will help to explain the differences in tree architecture and cropping potential among cultivars...|$|R

The age-sensitivity of horizontal branch stars implies that a large fraction of the M 31 dwarf galaxies have extended star formation histories (SFHs), and appear inconsistent with early star formation episodes that were rapidly shutdown. Systems fainter than ~ 10 ^{ 5. 5 } Lsun show the widest range in the ratios and morphologies of red and blue horizontal branches, indicative of both complex SFHs and a diversity in quenching timescales and/or mechanisms, which is qualitatively different from what is currently known for faint Milky Way (MW) satellites of comparable luminosities.

These findings support previous conclusions for compositionally polydisperse LLDPEs, whereby the highly branched molecules in the distribution may phase segregate, even if the overall branch content is low.

In an effort to answer these questions, the author examines a number of different attempts to arrive at a quantitative evaluation of the relationship between exchange and trade policies and the region's export performance in the 1980 s. The main conclusions drawn from this analysis are that, in the aggregate, exports are not very sensitive to long-term variations in exchange rates, since only rarely are their elasticities greater than unity. When broken down by branch of activity, however, the effects of exchange policy are not <b>homogeneous,</b> with some <b>branches</b> exhibiting very high elasticities in both the long and short terms; this suggests that the greater the level of diversification and installed capacity, the greater the impact of variations in the real exchange rate will be. The studies examined here also lead to the conclusion that volatile real exchange rates and unstable trade policies discourage investment in the export sector, while it is found that the tariff reforms instituted by the countries have had a positive influence on the development of their exports but cease to be a decisive factor in that development once their implementation is completed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Branching {{problems}} ask how an irreducible {{representation of}} a group decomposes when restricted to a subgroup. This exposition surveys new aspects of branching problems for unitary representations of reductive Lie groups. The first half is written from the representation theoretic viewpoint. After an observation on the wild features of branching problems for non-compact subgroups in a general setting, we introduce the notion of admissible restrictions as a good framework that enjoys two properties: finiteness of multiplicities and discreteness of spectrum. A criterion for admissible restrictions is presented, of which the idea of proof stems from microlocal analysis and algebraic geometry. In this framework, we present a finite multiplicity theorem. Furthermore, an exclusive law of discrete spectrum is formulated for inductions and restrictions. The second half deals with applications. Once we know the non-existence of continuous spectrum in the restrictions, we could expect an algebraic approach to branching problems. In this framework, new branching formulas have been recently obtained in various settings, among which we present an example, namely, a gen-eralization of the Kostant-Schmid formula to non-compact subgroups. Finally, we mention some applications of discretely decomposable branching laws to other fields of mathematics. The topics include (1) topological properties of modular varieties in locally symmetric spaces, (2) a construction of new discrete series representations for non-Riemannian non-symmetric homogeneous spaces. We end the exposition by a brief discussion on the mystery between tessellation of non-Riemannian <b>homogeneous</b> spaces and <b>branching</b> problems of unitary repre-sentations...|$|R

Experiments have shown that in such confinements the structure and dynamics of lubricants are greatly influenced {{by the nature of}} the confining surfaces. The well-organized surface structure is reflected, through the interfacial interactions, by a set of potential valleys that lubricant molecules are attracted to occupy. Any surface, no matter how geometrically smooth, manifests a sort of a foot-print over the neighboring lubricant layers. The surface interaction is a combination of two components: adsorption and corrugation potentials. In a Lennard-Jones model for the surface interactions, the adsorption potential increases with the surface density and with the well-depth energy of the surface-lubricant interaction. The corrugation potential, on the other hand, depends on the in-plane potential variations which are due to the crystalline structure and density of the surfaces. A simple method is proposed which is inspired by this need for quantitative measurements of adsorption and corrugation potentials. The method is initially used to compare the properties of different surface types. These surfaces are then used to confine a lubricant film in molecular lubrication conditions. The results for lubricant structuring, boundary flow and friction are analyzed according to the measured adsorption and corrugation. The major effects of lubricant molecular nature and shape in confined films between wetting and non-wetting surfaces are then studied. In terms of global friction it was found that corrugation is the most influencing factor through its strong relationship with boundary slip and thus surface wettability. In comparison between geometrically smooth surface models, low-friction surfaces can be identified as those with the lowest potential corrugation. In pure confined lubricants, the increase of chain length and branching results in an attenuation of the layering phenomena. The structure of the film becomes bulk-like <b>homogeneous</b> in <b>branched</b> molecules at only three molecular diameters distance from the confining surfaces. Long and branched chains encounter an increased level of inter-layer bridging which results in a stronger internal lubricant cohesion. When no boundary slip occurs as in the case of wetting surfaces, molecular length and branching increase friction because of the enhanced effective viscosity of the film. However near non-wetting surfaces, the internal film cohesion in long and branched chains may become stronger than their cohesion with the surfaces. This results in a larger boundary slip and an attenuation of friction in these films. Finally, hexadecane and ZDDP polar anti-wear additive were simulated. In agreement with experiments, the presence of ZDDP resulted in a higher friction compared to pure hexadecane oil. It was found that the molecular migration and adsorption of ZDDP molecules at the surfaces are the cause of this phenomenon. When ZDDP stick to the non-wetting surfaces, they significantly reduce the boundary slip which normally occurs with pure hexadecane oil. Moreover in the case of wetting surfaces, the whole adsorbed layer becomes locked to the surfaces. This results in a global increase of the average shear rate in the middle of the film. The central hexadecane film becomes sheared at a higher rate giving rise to a higher shear stress and friction, in agreement with experimental findings...|$|R
