[...] Rick Doblin of the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies read about Rathbun's arrest in the newspaper. [...] He {{sent a letter to the}} AIDS program at SFGH proposing that [...] "Brownie Mary's institution" [...] should consider conducting clinical trials of cannabis on the wasting syndrome in AIDS patients. Inspired by Rathbun's arrest, Abrams and Doblin collaborated to develop a protocol to test the effects of cannabis on appetite and body weight.

This compares with 4 – 15 % in simple lacerations. Infection rates are higher in hand injuries, puncture wounds, wounds involving joints, tendons, ligaments, or fractures, and wounds requiring debridement. People with diabetes, renal disease, alcohol abuse, on steroids, splenectomised or with other causes of <b>immuno-compromise</b> have {{higher risk of}} infection.

Wound cleaning by debriding, scrubbing etc. may also be needed. The use of hydrogen peroxide, Betadine or liquids other than normal saline is no longer supported as they cause more damage to tissues and impair wound healing. Delayed primary closure (after 3 – 5 days) is advisable for wounds needing extensive debridement, those with crush injury and wounds more than 6 – 8 hours old. The time period stated in the current manual is 4 – 7 days contrary to most recommendations, which state 3 – 5 days.

40|$|Scurvy’: {{presentation}} and skin manifestations of a not so uncommon condition An 84 -year-old man attended our emergency department with a 5 -month history of poor oral intake {{since the death}} of his wife. He complained of lethargy, dyspnoea, epistaxis and myalgic pains. He was severely thin with purpuric skin lesions over his knuckles, elbows and shins (figures 1 and 2). 1 Scurvy was suggested and confirmed by dermatology. The patient was started on ascorbic acid (400 mg/ 24 h) and initially improved, but died later of a nosocomial infection. Scurvy is a state of vitamin C (ascorbic acid) deficiency. Ascorbic acid is used in the synthesis of collagen, neurotrans-mitters and helps in dietary iron absorption. Deficiency results in poor wound healing, defective capillary walls and anaemia. The UK incidence of clinical scurvy is unknown, but the prevalence of vitamin C deficiency is estimated at 25 % in men and 16 % in women and is associated with low income, poor diet and smoking. 1 Symptoms/signs include lethargy, purpura, epistaxis, myalgia, dyspnoea, spongy gums and tooth loss. Complications include haemorrhage, neuropathies, <b>immuno-compromise</b> and hepatic and renal failure. Scurvy is believed to be historical or a diagnosis of developing countries. However, it is more common than perceived. Patients can easily be treated with dietary input and ascorbic acid supplementation. Symptoms often resolve in 1 e 2 weeks...|$|R
40|$|Travellers' {{diarrhoea}} {{caused by}} enteric protozoa like Entamoeba histolytica {{is among the}} most common protozoan diseases in developing countries. In developing countries, amoebiasis is the second most prevalent protozoan disease. This protozoan parasite is often known to coexist {{as a part of the}} normal gut microbiota. It is estimated that around 50 - 60 % of population in developing countries might be harbouring Entamoeba in an asymptomatic manner. Due to physiological perturbation or upon <b>immuno-compromise,</b> it can become virulent and then cause diarrhoea, bloody stools and may invade other organs if left untreated. Nitroimidazole drugs, namely metronidazole and tinidazole, are widely used to treat protozoan infections. These drugs often show dose-dependent side effects. With emerging antibiotic resistance, novel therapeutics to prevent parasitic infections is required. This study aims to study effect of probiotics on prevention of Amoebiasis. In this study, we have investigated the effect of selected probiotics on the growth of Entamoeba. From the list of probiotics being currently used, five bacterial strains were selected for testing. These probiotic strains were co-cultured with Entamoeba, and their effect on Entamoeba proliferation was checked. Of the five probiotics chosen, individual treatments of Lactobacillus casei and Enterococcus faecium showed a significant reduction of up to 71 % in parasite survival only at higher CFUs. When the two probiotics were used in combination, the percentage of survival reduced gradually further to 80 % at a total CFU of 10 (9) cells/ ml of bacteria.

40|$|While host {{stress in}} {{vertebrate}} populations {{has often been}} linked to outbreaks of epidemics, which are attributed to the <b>immuno-compromise</b> of the stressed hosts, no predictions have been made about the response of invertebrate host populations to stressful conditions. Experiments conducted on individual invertebrate hosts, however, suggest that starved hosts may be a poor resource for parasites and that heavily infected old hosts may be more susceptible to stress, causing parasite populations to decline when their host population faces food shortages. In this epidemiological experiment, we exposed infected and uninfected Daphnia magna populations, which had been kept for many generations under a constant high food supply, to reduced food resources. Using the microsporidian gut parasite Glugoides intestinalis, which is exclusively horizontally transmitted, we tracked changes in parasite and host population size as well as host body length to elucidate how food shortages for the hosts influence host and parasite population dynamics. In both infected and uninfected populations, food shortage led to an approximately equal reduction in host density and changes in host body length distribution. Large hosts suffered a higher mortality than smaller hosts, which significantly reduced the mean body length in the host populations; however, this change was stronger in the infected populations and went hand-in-hand with a reduction in parasite spore load (a measure of intensity of infection) and prevalence. This effect disappeared after six weeks of food shortage, when the populations reached a new equilibrium. Our results indicate that in this system food stress impairs parasite spread and that host mortality {{is an important factor}} in regulating parasite abundance at the population level...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Since its isolation, Methicillin-resistant Staphlococcus aureus (MRSA) {{has become}} a major cause of {{hospital}} acquired infection (HAI), adverse patient outcome and overall resource utilisation. It is endemic in Scotland and widespread in Western hospitals. MRSA {{has been the subject of}} widespread media interest- a manifestation of concerns about sterile surgical techniques and hospital cleanliness. This study aimed to investigate patient outcome of MRSA infections over the last decade at a major orthopaedic trauma centre. The objective was to establish the association of variables, such as patient age and inpatient residence, against patient outcome, in order to quantify significant relationships; facilitating the evaluation of management strategies with an aim to improving patient outcomes and targeting high-risk procedures. Methods This is a retrospective study of the rates and outcomes of MRSA infection in orthopaedic trauma at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh. Data was collated using SPSS 14. 0 for Windows(R). Shapiro-Wilkes testing was performed to investigate the normality of continuous data sets (e. g: age). Data was analysed using both Chi-Squared and Fisher's exact tests (in cases of expected values under 5) Results This study found significant associations between adverse patient outcome (persistent deep infection, osteomyelitis, the necessity for revision surgery, amputation and mortality) and the following patient variables: Length of inpatient stay, <b>immuno-compromise,</b> pre-admission residence in an institutional setting (such as a residential nursing home) and the number of antibiotics used in patient care. Despite 63 % of all infections sampled resulting from proximal femoral fractures, no association between patient outcome and site of infection or diagnosis was found. Somewhat surprisingly, the relationship between age and outcome of infection was not proved to be significant, contradicting previous studies suggesting a statistical association. Antibiotic prophylaxis, previously identified as a factor in reducing overall incidence of MRSA infection, was not found to be significantly associated with outcome. Conclusions Early identification of high-risk patients as identified by this study could lead to more judicious use of therapeutic antibiotics and reductions in adverse outcome, as well as socioeconomic cost. These results could assist in more accurate risk stratification based on evidence based evaluation of the significance of the risk factors investigated. </p...|$|R

There are several risk factors which can help Candida parapsilosis to colonize human host. <b>Immuno-compromised</b> individuals and surgical patients, particularly those having surgery of the gastrointestinal tract are at high risk for infection with Candida parapsilosis. There is currently no consensus on the treatment of invasive candidiasis caused by Candida parapsilosis, although the therapeutic approach typically includes the extraction of any removable foreign bodies and the administration of a systemic antifungal.

5000|$|Chagas {{disease is}} also known as American trypanosomiasis. There are {{approximately}} 15 million people infected with Chagas disease. [...] The chance of morbidity is higher for <b>immuno-compromised</b> individuals, children, and elderly, but very low if treated early. [...] Chagas disease does not kill victims rapidly, instead causing years of debilitating chronic symptoms. It is caused by a vector-borne protozoa and spread by contact with Trypanosoma cruzi infected feces of the triatomine (assassin) bug. The protozoan can enter the body via the bug's bite, skin breaks, or mucous membranes. Infection can result from eating infected food and coming into contact with contaminated bodily fluids. There are two phases of Chagas disease. The acute phase is usually asymptomatic. The first symptoms are usually skin chancres, unilateral purplish orbital oedema, local lymphoadenopathies, and fever accompanied by a variety of other symptoms depending on infection site. [...] The chronic phase occurs in 30 percent of total infections and can take three forms, which are asymptomatic (most prevalent), cardiac, and digestive lesions.|$|E
