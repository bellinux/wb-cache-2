5|$|After the fight, the Fitzgeralds kept up {{appearances}} {{with their}} friends, seeming happy. In September, Zelda overdosed on sleeping pills. The couple never {{spoke of the}} incident, and refused to discuss {{whether or not it}} was a suicide attempt. Scott returned to writing, finishing The Great Gatsby in October. They attempted to celebrate with travel to Rome and Capri, but both were unhappy and unhealthy. When he received the proofs from his novel he <b>fretted</b> over the title: Trimalchio in West Egg, just Trimalchio or Gatsby, Gold-hatted Gatsby, or The High-bouncing Lover. It was Zelda who preferred The Great Gatsby. It was also on this trip, while ill with colitis, that Zelda began painting.|$|E
5|$|At the time, {{there were}} no public art {{galleries}} in England with permanent collections. In 1816, {{in the face of}} his continued lack of success, Etty decided to spend a year in Italy to study the artworks held in the great Italian collections. He had made a brief visit to France in early 1815, but other than this had never been abroad. The 28-year-old Etty had fallen in love, and <b>fretted</b> about the difficulties a potential marriage would cause, and whether it would be right to travel to further his career even though it would mean taking his new wife to a foreign country. In the event, the woman rejected him, and he set out for the Continent in early September 1816.|$|E
5|$|Frith {{recorded}} the album at David Vorhaus's Kaleidophon Studios in London on 11–13 and 15 July 1974, {{where he played}} a modified 1936 Gibson K-11. He added an extra pickup over the strings at the nut, enabling him to amplify sound {{from both sides of}} the <b>fretted</b> note. He then split the fretboard in two with a capo, effectively giving him two guitars, each amplified separately that he could play independently with each hand. To split the sounds further he attached alligator clips at various positions on the strings. The net result was a guitar with multiple sound sources that could be channelled to a mixer and distributed across the stereo soundscape.|$|E
50|$|When {{the zero}} <b>fret</b> {{is viewed as}} an {{extension}} of the fingerboard by adding one more <b>fret</b> wire before the nut, then the luthier would fit a <b>fret</b> wire of identical dimensions. This will decrease the string action at the lower <b>fret</b> positions. To avoid this effect, luthiers often use a thicker <b>fret</b> wire at the zero <b>fret</b> position. While the straight and level zero <b>fret</b> improves the tuning accuracy along the lower <b>frets</b> (from <b>fret</b> 1 to 3 mainly) the elevated <b>fret</b> keeps the string action higher and helps to avoid string buzz.|$|R

The WC-Co coating presents very good wear resistance by decreasing the energy wear coefficient ([alpha]) under <b>fretting</b> conditions by more than 9 times. The tested coating reduces crack nucleation under both <b>fretting</b> and <b>fretting</b> fatigue situations. Finally the crack arrest conditions are evaluated by the combined <b>fretting</b> and <b>fretting</b> fatigue investigation.

5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s and early 1960s, the {{majority}} of women were still wearing highly structured undergarments. Girdles were considered the ladylike norm and represented close to 40% of industry sales by volume. The 1960s also brought to Canadian Lady the challenges of feminism, fashions and the sexual revolution. The feminist movement—cultured by thought leaders like Betty Friedan and Germaine Greer—questioned the mores that defined women's roles and appearance. Changes in fashion trends, such as pantyhose {{and the rise of the}} miniskirt, rendered the girdle unattractive and obsolete to a generation of women. While the intimate apparel industry <b>fretted</b> about bra-burning as a precursor to the decline of all foundation garment sales, women reserved their animosity for their girdles. The Canadian sales data for foundation undergarments, from 1960 to 1971, vividly demonstrates the shift in tastes.|$|E

The very top of the <b>fret</b> is left untouched leaving a small flat strip along the <b>fret.</b> This creates the ideal <b>fret</b> shape, while leaving the top of the <b>fret</b> intact and keeping all of the <b>frets</b> at the same height.|$|R
25|$|There are {{currently}} two {{different approaches to}} kobza construction: authentic fretless reconstructions, produced by adherents for the recreation of authentic folk traditions, and modern stylised <b>fretted</b> instruments based on a modified domra design.

40|$|Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (<b>FRET)</b> using {{fluorescent}} protein variants {{is widely}} used to study biochemical processes in living cells. <b>FRET</b> detection by fluorescence lifetime measurements is the most direct and robust method to measure <b>FRET.</b> The traditional cyan-yellow fluorescent protein based <b>FRET</b> pairs are getting replaced by green-red fluorescent protein variants. The green-red pair enables excitation at a longer wavelength which reduces cellular autofluorescence and phototoxicity while monitoring <b>FRET.</b> Despite the advances in <b>FRET</b> based sensors, the low <b>FRET</b> efficiency and dynamic range still complicates their use in cell biology and high throughput screening. In this paper, we utilized the higher lifetime of NowGFP and screened red fluorescent protein variants to develop <b>FRET</b> pairs with high dynamic range and <b>FRET</b> efficiency. The <b>FRET</b> variations were analyzed by proteolytic activity and detected by steady-state and time-resolved measurements. Based on the results, NowGFP-tdTomato and NowGFP-mRuby 2 have shown high potentials as <b>FRET</b> pairs with large fluorescence lifetime dynamic range. The in vitro measurements revealed that the NowGFP-tdTomato has the highest Förster radius for any fluorescent protein based <b>FRET</b> pairs yet used in biological studies.

50|$|Both deep-neck and free-neck citoles are {{depicted}} in illustrations with <b>frets.</b> <b>Frets</b> are often shown in pairs (two <b>frets</b> to mark one {{position on the}} neck).

The abby of St. Savin citole, the Lincoln Cathedral (stained glass) citole, and the Giorgiano painting citole show eight. As no instruments with <b>frets</b> have survived, {{the nature of the}} <b>frets</b> is conjecture. Choices include the use of stings tied around the neck as <b>frets</b> and some sort of permanently mounted <b>fret.</b> Most illustrations aren't detailed enough to know which is used. One exception is the Giorgiano painting, which shows the <b>fret</b> going {{all the way around the}} neck, tied string <b>frets.</b> The St. Savin deep-neck citole is also detailed and does not show strings going all the way around the neck.

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of four sections, the <b>fretting</b> wear properties of high carbon chromium bearing steel; the effect of debris during <b>fretting</b> wear; an introduction of a new <b>fretting</b> wear test apparatus used in this study; {{and the effects of}} <b>fretting</b> damage parameters on rolling bearings. The tests were operated under unlubricated conditions. Using a crossed cylinder contact arrangement, the tests were carried out with the normal load of 3 N, slip amplitude of 50 µm, and frequency of 30 Hz at room temperature. The new <b>fretting</b> wear test rig {{consists of}} a sphere-on-plate arrangement, and the normal load and slip amplitude were variously changed. Using the new test rig, the tests were performed both at room temperature and 200 ℃, and tensile stresses were applied to the lower stationary specimens during the <b>fretting</b> wear tests. In the <b>fretting</b> wear tests after tempering at 200, 230, 260 and 350 ℃ in air, the high carbon chromium bearing steel showed low coefficients of friction due to a glaze type oxide film. In the <b>fretting</b> wear tests at 200 ℃, a very low coefficient of friction was obtained. Consequently, the oxide films on high carbon chromium bearing steel tempered at 200, 230, 260 and 350 ℃ were thought to be protective in <b>fretting</b> damage. <b>Fretting</b> wear volumes were measured using different specimen combinations and <b>fretting</b> oscillatory directions relative to the axes of the cylindrical specimens, although of the same material couples. It has been found that <b>fretting</b> wear volume is significantly governed by frictional energy (<b>fretting</b> damage per unit area) and frequency of metal-to-metal contact, as determined by electrical contact resistance measurements. Metal-to-metal contact was observed throughout the whole stage of <b>fretting</b> wear even in the case of full slip <b>fretting</b> wear. <b>Fretting</b> crack initiation is encouraged but <b>fretting</b> crack propagation rate is not significantly affected by high normal loads. Compressive residual stresses in the subsurface have little influence on crack initiation, but have a large influence on crack propagation rate. In the study of fracture induced by <b>fretting</b> wear, a critical slip amplitude which led to the shortest fracture life was identified. With the critical slip amplitude (35 µm), a higher coefficient of friction was obtained, and this result suggested a significant effect of coefficient of friction on fracture induced by <b>fretting</b> wear (or <b>fretting</b> fatigue). The mechanisms of <b>fretting</b> wear and <b>fretting</b> fatigue were also discussed. <b>Fretting</b> wear is predominantly governed by the total tangential shear strain due to <b>fretting</b> oscillation. In contrast, <b>fretting</b> fatigue is dominated by the maximum alternating tangential shear strain energy. As coefficient of friction affects significantly both the total tangential shear strain and the maximum alternating tangential shear strain energy, it is thought {{to be the most important}} factor which needs to be controlled to reduce damage by both <b>fretting</b> wear and <b>fretting</b> fatigue...|$|R
50|$|Almost all guitars have <b>frets,</b> {{which are}} metal strips (usually nickel alloy or {{stainless}} steel) embedded along the fretboard and located at exact points that divide the scale length {{in accordance with}} a specific mathematical formula.

40|$|<b>Fretting</b> {{damage to}} fuel rods reduces the service {{lives of the}} fuel {{assemblies}} and therefore increases reactor operating costs. The future development of fretting-resistant spacer grids neces-sitates the investigation of <b>fretting</b> behavior by means of model tests. This paper {{presents the results of}} such tests carried out to investigate <b>fretting</b> in three different fuel rod support configura-tions. The tests were performed in water at room temperature in a <b>fretting</b> test stand (referred to below simply as “autoclave”) using test rods with zirconium-alloy cladding tubes. The test rod was excited by means of electromagnet to induce vibration. The depth of the <b>fretting</b> marks and their volume increased as test-ing progressed. The resulting increase in the grid-to-rod gap caused changes in rod dynamic behavior and in the intensity of rod motion. <b>Fretting</b> rate is affected by rod motion, and the presence of edges at the point of contact between rod and sup-port accelerates <b>fretting</b> wear. Spring design affects not only the degree of <b>fretting</b> but also the time history of the <b>fretting</b> process. Steady-state <b>fretting</b> was identified in the case of rods supported by convex springs without edges at the point of rod-to-support contact. The results of the model tests should provide a bet-ter understanding of <b>fretting</b> processes inside the reactor. They should not, however, be used to describe real conditions inside a reactor.
