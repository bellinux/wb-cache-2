5|$|In his 2012 {{race for}} re-election, Tierney faced former State Senator and 2010 nominee for Lieutenant Governor Richard Tisei. Tisei, who is openly gay, was {{endorsed}} by the Log Cabin Republicans. He was also endorsed by The Rainbow Times, a Boston-based LGBT newspaper. Gay <b>Democratic</b> <b>Congressman</b> Barney Frank endorsed Tierney, likening gay Republicans to Uncle Tom.

5|$|Cooper {{was opposed}} in his {{re-election}} bid by <b>Democratic</b> <b>Congressman</b> Virgil M. Chapman, {{an ally of}} Earle C. Clements, who had been elected governor in 1947. As {{one of only a}} few Democrats who had voted in favor of the Taft–Hartley Act, Chapman had lost the support of organized labor, a key constituency for the Democrats. The Democratic-leaning Louisville Times endorsed Cooper, but the presence of Kentucky's favorite son, Alben Barkley, on the ballot as Harry S. Truman's running mate in the 1948 presidential election ensured a strong Democratic turnout in the state. Both Barkley and Clements stressed party unity during the campaign, and although Cooper polled much better than the Republican presidential ticket, he ultimately lost to Chapman in the general election by 24,480 votes.|$|E

Furious at Walker's betrayal, Underwood and his wife Claire (Robin Wright), an environmental activist, make a pact to destroy Kern. When Zoe Barnes (Kate Mara) makes her resources available, she becomes one of their pawns.|$|E
5|$|In the 1936 senatorial {{contest in}} Kentucky, {{incumbent}} Democrat Marvel Mills Logan {{was seen as}} vulnerable, and Chandler backed Democratic challenger J. C. W. Beckham in the Democratic primary. This endorsement drew the ire of Chandler's former ally, <b>Democratic</b> <b>Congressman</b> John Y. Brown, Sr., who believed that, {{in exchange for his}} support of Chandler in the 1935 gubernatorial race, Chandler would support him in the U.S. Senate contest. An embittered Brown entered the race anyway, and the votes he pulled from Beckham likely allowed Logan to retain the seat. Brown remained Chandler's political enemy {{for the rest of his}} political career.|$|E

5|$|The next year, 1894, saw {{pay cuts}} and labor disturbances, {{including}} a massive strike by the {{workers at the}} Pullman Company. A group of unemployed workers, known as Coxey's Army, marched on Washington that spring. Weaver met with them in Iowa and expressed sympathy with the movement, {{so long as they}} refrained from lawbreaking. He then returned to the campaign trail, stumping for Populist candidates in the 1894 midterm elections. The election proved disastrous for the Democrats, but most of the gains went to the Republicans rather than to the Populists, who gained a few seats in the South but lost ground in the West. During the election, Weaver became friendly with William Jennings Bryan, a <b>Democratic</b> <b>Congressman</b> from Nebraska and a charismatic supporter of free silver. Bryan had lost his bid for the Senate in the election, but his reputation as an exciting speaker made him a presidential possibility in 1896.|$|E
