Contract vehicle selection (primarily indefinitely <b>duration,</b> <b>indefinite</b> quantity (IDIQ) versus stand alone “C” contracts), market research, competition, use of performance incentives (or not), earned valued management system (EVMS) use, length of contract, number of options periods, simplification of source selection strategy and evaluation factors, inattention to fine acquisition {{details such as}} with regard to technical data rights, bundling of contract requirements into larger contract vehicles, and other decisions having {{a direct impact on}} acquisition outcomes including cost are frequently driven by workload of contracting and requiring activities. Bundling of requirements to reduce contracting actions in particular reduce contracting workload but necessarily create increased risks and other undesirable impacts to include reduction of potential vendors who directly accomplish the work in question (thereby increasing subcontracting and decreasing specific experience with particular categories of work by prime contractors). Overbundling also reduces competition by reducing the number of vendors willing to take responsibility as a prime integrator over areas that are not in their core business. At some point, bundling reduces vendor base to so called prime integrators who do little to none of the work in house.|$|E
50|$|Example of how over-bundling causes big {{problems}} (permutations {{and evaluation of}} total price in source selection): Lets say a requiring activity wants to get polling services. Acquisition planning reveals there are five polls in ten different regions. However, {{it turns out that}} the Government will only be ordering one of the five polls in any real numbers and that particular poll is much more expensive in actual cost than the other four. If a weighting scheme is not applied to this bundled requirement, a vendor can make the four lightly ordered polls very cheap in their offer and the high volume poll very expensive, based on their knowledge of the ordering patterns of the Government in past acquisitions. Thus, on its face, the overall price of a bid when each poll is added together to arrive at a total price (used in source selection) would look attractive but in practice, the Government will burn through its budget very quickly given the vast majority of the actually ordered polls are extremely expensive (even though the actual cost of the most frequently ordered poll is far less than what was in the offer). To avoid the headache of a weighting scheme, all five polls should be broken apart and contracted for separately so they can be judged on their merits. This is an example of what is frequently done on major indefinite <b>duration,</b> <b>indefinite</b> quantity (IDIQ) contracts and explains why some acquisitions are appallingly expensive and require additional funding to achieve the requiring activity's objectives.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} factors {{explaining the}} choice of an <b>indefinite</b> <b>duration</b> for inter-firm contracts from the transaction cost perspective using a sample of subcontracting agreements in the Spanish electronics industry. We particularly consider {{the impact of the}} classical transactional attributes, such as specificity and uncertainty, along with other governance mechanisms, such as contractual completeness and relational governance, on duration clauses. The results show that the probability of signing an indefinite-duration contract is related positively to the specificity of the activity and negatively to the degree of completeness of the contract and the uncertainty regarding future demand. Contrary to some classical arguments, these findings suggest that an explicitly long-term contract is not always needed to protect against contractual hazards. Indefinite-duration contracts may also provide protection while improving the flexibility to adjust the relationship to the changing environment. <b>Indefinite</b> <b>duration</b> Subcontracting Transaction cost analysis Contract design Electronics industry...|$|R

50|$|Following {{a complex}} {{negotiating}} process, {{which began in}} the summer of 2001, and after a unilateral extension by the State by the Law of December 27, 2001, given that there was no agreement in the Mixed Commission on the Quota at the appropriate time, an agreement was reached in this Commission on March 6, 2002, that took concrete form in Law 12/2002 of May 23. This Law, which also consists of a single article, introduced relevant innovations with respect to earlier texts. In the exposition of reasons for enacting the new law, emphasis was placed on the Agreement’s character as historical law, with a widening of foral normative authority, and on the need to regulate the financial flows between the State and the Autonomous Community. But, above all, the most important element was unquestionably its stating that the Agreement had an indefinite character. It had previously been of <b>indefinite</b> <b>duration</b> in 1886, but periods of expiry had been set that had given rise to friction in the months prior to the renewals. Thus the agreement is of <b>indefinite</b> <b>duration</b> although it has mechanisms of modification by common agreement on the Mixed Commission on the Economic Agreement (previously the Quota). This argument {{had been one of the}} points on which the Provincial Councils had held a firm position from the beginning of the system, since in their understanding it was the contingent element (the agreed taxes and the Quota) that was variable but not the agreement itself.|$|R
40|$|Traditional {{concepts}} {{concerning the}} law regarding employment relationships of an <b>indefinite</b> <b>duration</b> {{have been the}} object of much criticism in recent years.

The at-will rule, however, is not about to be abandoned. The overwhelming majority of jurisdictions continue to adhere to the view that employment relationships of an <b>indefinite</b> <b>duration</b> may be terminated at any time without notice 2 ̆ 2 for good cause, for no cause, or even for cause morally wrong.... 2 ̆ 2 Even those jurisdictions which have recognized exceptions to the at-will rule are limiting the application of those exceptions to clearly articulated public policy as expressed in federal or state law.

This article discusses the various approaches of law regarding at-will employment relationships. The rationale for the employment-at-will rule, its exceptions and recent limitations on these exceptions are examined.
