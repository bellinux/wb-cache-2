In order to overcome this shortcoming, this paper suggests an alternative method of calculating new index by using a common stochastic trend model. This econometric approach to understanding the dynamics of <b>dry</b> <b>bulk</b> <b>freight</b> markets not only provides new index, but also gives a decomposition method. That is, through this lens of common stochastic trend model, we can decompose the freight data into common (or permanent) and idiosyncratic (or transitory) components...|$|R

Inter alia, the hypothesis that there is bimodality in the supply curve of shipping freight markets is strongly supported by analyzing {{the effect of the}} term structure of time-charter rates on the time-varying volatility. Furthermore, the adjustment speed of 1 -year time-charter rate in lowvolatility regime is larger than in high-volatility regime, which means the market players consider the backwardation shock in low uncertainty as more important than in high uncertainty. Especially the Cape-size markets respond positively to the back-wardation shock in low-volatility regime but respond negatively in high-volatility regime. Finally, the estimated time-varying variance using real-time data has a highly statistically significant relation with the next squared error terms...|$|R

Despite the plethora of studies on micro and macro economic determinants of freight rates, there have been no studies addressing these issues. Hence, this paper undertakes such an investigation using Co-integration analysis, VAR based Granger Causality tests and Impulse Response analysis. Another contribution is that we apply our methodology separately to the spot and period freight markets, and empirically examine and analyze the differences among the causal relationships of four different vessel categories.

The BDI is influenced by many factors, especially the random incidents in <b>dry</b> <b>bulk</b> market, inducing the difficulty in forecasting of BDI. Therefore, to eliminate the impact of random incidents in <b>dry</b> <b>bulk</b> market, wavelet transform is adopted to denoise the BDI data series.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{relationship}} between the time-varying volatility of <b>dry</b> <b>bulk</b> <b>freight</b> rates and the change of the supply of fleet trading in <b>dry</b> <b>bulk</b> markets. An abundance of research has been done to understand the time-varying characteristics of freight rate volatility, yet few have discussed the determinants of freight volatility. We therefore examine freight volatility against the changes in fleet size and other shipping market variables over January 1973 –October 2010. The study employs a two-step model specification. The first step is the measurement of freight rate volatility through an AR-GARCH model; the second step is the analysis of {{the relationship between}} freight rate volatility and fleet size growth through a GMM regression. We confirm similar findings in the literature that freight rate volatility is time varying. Furthermore, the results reveal that the change in fleet size positively affects freight rate volatility, while the spot rate volatility of Capesize <b>dry</b> <b>bulk</b> exhibits a stronger reaction to the change in fleet size. The results of this study contribute in a general sense to understanding the systematic risk of shipping markets. ► We examine the determinants of <b>freight</b> volatility in <b>dry</b> <b>bulk</b> shipping markets. ► We adopt a two-step model specification: a GARCH model and a GMM regression. ► Fleet size growth has a positive impact on freight volatility. ► Freight rate volatility is time varying...|$|R
40|$|The article uses a real options {{valuation}} {{model with}} stochastic freight rates to investigate market efficiency and {{the economics of}} switching between the <b>dry</b> <b>bulk</b> and the tanker markets in international shipping. A <b>dry</b> <b>bulk</b> carrier is replaced with a tanker when the expected net present value of such a switch is optimal from a real options based decision rule. Depending {{on the development of}} the markets a reversal may take place later. The cost and demand parameters upon which the decisions to switch are made, including the stochastic characteristics of freight rates, are estimated from an empirical analysis that is updated every week throughout a 12 -year time period from 1993 to 2005. The second-hand market for bulk ships seems to have been efficient most of these years in the sense that market switching usually did not pay off, with one major exception: it seemed profitable in expectation to leave the <b>dry</b> <b>bulk</b> market and enter the tanker market over a significant period of time shortly after the millennium shift, and to return to the <b>dry</b> <b>bulk</b> market about three years later. These points in time corresponded with an unprecedented boom period in the tanker and <b>dry</b> <b>bulk</b> <b>freight</b> markets, respectively, and the result suggest that agents in the second-hand market were slow to adjust their expectations. In retrospect, such an investment policy also happened to be profitable compared to staying put in the tanker market, even after accounting for transaction costs. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBased on {{the monthly}} data set from January 1992 to May 2012, this paper applies a VAR model and two {{time-varying}} coefficient models to analyze term structure in <b>dry</b> <b>bulk</b> <b>freight</b> market. The resulting three main empirical findings are as follows: 1) The response of long-term rate to short- term structural shock {{is relatively small}} and not statistically significant but the response of short-term rate to long-term structural shock is large and statistically significant. 2) Compared with the presumption that in backwardation the short-term rate is inclined to decrease but the long-term rate to increase, but in contango the opposite pressure would function, there is lack of evidence for the stable adjustment speed in both equations for the short- and long-term freight rate. 3) When the market is relatively above the normal level (more backwardation), {{the effect of the}} implied forward time charter (IFTC) rate on the actual TC rate becomes larger.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the efficiency and}} predictive power of implied forward shipping charter rates. In particular, we examine whether implied forward 6 -month time-charter rates, which are derived through the difference between time-charters with different maturities based on the term structure model, are efficient and unbiased predictors of actual future time-charter rates. Using a dataset for the period January 1989 to June 2003, results of different statistical tests, including the cointegration approach, suggest that implied forward rates are in fact unbiased predictors of future time-charter rates in the <b>dry</b> <b>bulk</b> <b>freight</b> market. In addition, {{it is found that}} implied forward rates yield superior forecasts compared to alternative univariate and multivariate time series models. However, while the unbiasedness hypothesis is found to hold, on average, we find that chartering strategies based on simple trend-following trading rules in this cyclical market are able to generate economic profits even out-of-sample. This highlights how standard tests for unbiasedness do not always capture cyclical predictable components in the market behaviour. [*][*]Copyright Â© 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. ...|$|R
40|$|The world bulk {{shipping}} {{market has been}} in a peak period since 2003, and this has lasted an incredibly long time considering that the markets are much more complex than before. This paper investigates the characteristics of volatility in <b>dry</b> <b>bulk</b> <b>freight</b> rates of different vessel sizes (capesize, panamax and handysize). The daily returns of freight rate indices of three different types of bulk vessel in the sample period have been examined. The sample period ran from 1 March 1999 to 23 December 2005, and applying the GARCH (generalized auto regressive conditional heteroskedasticity) model showed that the shocks will not decrease but have the tendency to strengthen for all the daily return series. Further, external shocks on the market have a different magnitude of influence on volatility in different types of vessels due to their distinct flexibility. To examine the asymmetric characters of daily return volatility in different {{bulk shipping}} sectors and different market conditions, the sample was divided into two periods: one is from 1 March 1999 to 31 December 2002, the other is from 1 January 2003 to 23 December 2005; the EGARCH (exponential generalized auto regressive conditional heteroskedasticity) model was then applied to investigate the asymmetric impact between past innovations and current volatility. The results show that the asymmetric characters are distinct for different vessel size segments and different market conditions. The reasons for the results are discussed and it is considered that the main reasons may be the different flexibility and different commodity transport on different routes. The results from this investigation will be useful for the operators and investors in the <b>dry</b> <b>bulk</b> shipping market to increase profitability and reduce investment risk...|$|R

40|$|This thesis aims to {{investigate}} four main {{areas of interest}} in the functioning of different markets in the <b>dry</b> <b>bulk</b> shipping sector using recent econometric and time series techniques. These areas include; seasonality patterns in freight markets, the efficient market hypothesis and the existence of time-varying risk premia in freight rate and ship price formation, the dynamic interrelationships between freight rate levels and spillover effects in freight rate volatilities, between sub-markets of the <b>dry</b> <b>bulk</b> sector. The seasonal behaviour of' <b>dry</b> <b>bulk</b> <b>freight</b> rates is measured and compared across vessel sizes, contract duration and under different market conditions. Seasonality is deterministic rather than stochastic and it varies across vessel sizes, contract durations and market conditions. In particular, freight rates for larger vessels show higher seasonal variations than smaller ones. Seasonality in spot rates is higher than timecharter rates across the size. Also, seasonal fluctuations are found to be stronger during market expansions compared to market down turns. The validity of the expectations hypothesis of the term structure (EHTS) in the formation of both one and three-year time-charter rates is strongly rejected for all size carriers. Failure of the EHTS is attributed to shipowners' perceptions of risk regarding their decision to operate in spot or time-charter markets. Time-varying risk premia in the formation of period rates is found to be negative; shipowners are prepared to accept lower rates for the relative security of longer contracts. The higher risk involved in contracts with shorter term to maturity are thought to emanate from higher freight rate volatilities, relocation costs, risk of unemployment in spot markets as well as fluctuations in voyage costs. Investigating the dynamic interrelationships between freight rates for different size vessels and spillover effects between volatilities in spot and period markets reveal that the interaction between freight rates in the spot market is higher than in the period markets. It is also found that there is a unidirectional transmission of volatility from larger to smaller size vessels in both spot and period markets. Finally, results strongly reject the EMH in the market for newbuilding and secondhand <b>dry</b> <b>bulk</b> vessels. Failure of the present value model and price efficiency is attributed to the risk associated with holding these assets. Results of Generalised Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity in Mean (GARCH-M) models suggest that there is a positive relationship between time-varying risk and return on shipping investments, a result which is consistent with asset pricing theories in the financial economics literature...|$|R

According to the conventional expectation, the volume of marine accidents is a random process since it is accidently occurred and not a man-made outcome. Under this circumstance, it is expected that the volume of marine accidents should be statistically uncorrelated with the freight market rates and positively correlated with the fleet size. However, the existence statistics on dry cargo marine accidents indicate high level of negative correlation with freight markets (- 0. 95 for no. of vessels and - 0. 79 for the volume of accidents in dwt) and also high level of negative correlation with the fleet size (- 0. 81 for the volume of accidents in dwt).

40|$|Quickly {{adapting}} to changing market conditions {{is crucial for}} every firm, especially in volatile and capital intensive markets. These are two characteristics of the maritime industry. Incorporating flexibility in design have gathered an increased focus as means to cope with such a dynamic context. To be flexible is not always enough, partially because exploiting this flexibility causes a time delay. This time delay causes more uncertainty, which could make a good investment decision into a bad one. Hence, this master thesis investigates the contribution from investment lags in engineering systems by the following: (i) Structuring and presenting a real option framework for identification of possible design solutions that reduces investment lag (ii) Propose value models for system design changes that are exposed for investment lag (iii) Propose design solutions that limits the investment lag. For this, an elongation of a <b>dry</b> <b>bulk</b> vessel is a thorough example. Agility represents {{the ability of a}} system to change quickly, and investment lag is the time from the decision is made until the system has changed capabilities. All investments have lags to some degree, which is often disregarded in traditional real options analyses. For systems with relatively long time lags, {{there is a need to}} better understand the impact of these investment lags. To identify design solutions that enables agility, a further separation in the real options framework has been proposed as a contribution to the existing literature. On options is seen as the superior option, which is the operational option on a projects future cash flow. This is often related to changes in value enabling variables, and as this is the conventional real option, there exist an established valuation framework for it. Further, on options are separated in two classes, Built-in-Design options and Design Change options. The former is multifunctionality that are implemented in the system from the initial design stage, the latter are options that make changes in the design, often referred to as in options, which comes with an investment lag due to off-hire when performing the design change. By this separation of on options, path enablers could be tied to real options. Path enablers are features that enables easier change in value enabling variables, making it easier to exercise options. Design path enablers are design features that enables easier exercise of design change option, thereby reducing the investment lag and cost of exercise. Thus, Design Change options could be seen as operational path enablers, that enables change of operation, which by definition is an on options. The relation between the option value of a capacity expansion/market entry, and the investment lag is defined to value agility. This gives a possible value for investment lag reducing path enablers. A design neutral capacity expansion in the <b>dry</b> <b>bulk</b> <b>freight</b> market is used as an illustrative case, and by introducing the investment lag as a parameter in the real option model, the value of a capacity expansion option could be considered as a function of investment lag. For this, the cost of investment lag is defined as the opportunity cost of operating in the market. The analysis is conducted in several steps, by three models with increasing degree of complexity. Qualitative and quantitative time series analysis on <b>dry</b> <b>bulk</b> <b>freight</b> rates in the Capesize segment in the time span between 1990 and 2017 resulted in freight market replications for two of the models using the geometric Mean Reversion model, and the last with market rates and asset prices as correlated mean reversion paths. Then, by Monte Carlo simulation, a now-or-never investment analysis determines the value of agility by simulation of the projects cash flows, thereafter through including investment timing flexibility based on the Least Squares Monte Carlo algorithm, which gives the value of agility through an established option valuation framework. For this model two approaches were taken, one with correlated vessel values and freight rates, and one with vessel values as a value of underlying freight rates. The option value reflects a premium of second hand vessel prices with different investment lags, and with no investment lag the maximum value will be respectively 147, 60 and 12. 2 USD/dwt for the now-or-never approach, LSMC and LSMC and with correlated asset paths, which is reduced to 85 %, 65 % and 55 % of maximum value for an investment lag of 6 months. The results of the different models are quite consistent in their form, and the spread between the maximum value can be explained through different approaches and different underlying stochastic processes. The LSMC model with vessel values as function of freight rates is seen as the most realistic, as it includes investment timing flexibility and geometric Mean Reversion as underlying stochastic process for freight market dynamics. Further, design path enablers for the illustrative case is proposed, an elongation of a <b>dry</b> <b>bulk</b> carrier which gives a capacity expansion. Design path enablers for this elongation is elements that make the vessel ready for elongation, examples of this can be thickness of plates and visibility. As the design still water bending moment and wave bending moment is a function of L^ 3, a greater thickness is required. Further, the visibility of water surface shall not be obscured by more than 1 xLOA forward of the bow. Hence, path enablers for an elongation from 150 m to 200 m could be to build the initially 150 m long vessel with bottom plate thickness of 12 mm instead of the required 11 mm and a higher bridge. This will make the initial structure ready for 200 m LOA. By implementing design path enablers one increases the design freedom over the systems lifetime. In conventional design thinking, a design is often optimised for a base case. Though, by implementing design path enablers, one admit that the future is uncertain and partly unpredictable, and enables easier future design changes. This will increase the design freedom over the systems lifetime, which again is reflected by flexibility in operations at a strategic level. By implementing such design path enablers, together with Built-in design options, agility is enabled through design, thus, Agility by Design...|$|R
