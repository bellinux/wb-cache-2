40|$|This paper extends earlier {{research}} regarding predictability of secondary market prices for sovereign <b>debt</b> <b>certificates</b> <b>issued</b> by developing countries. Due {{to the existence}} of a thinly traded market subject to potential outliers, parameter estimation is accomplished by means of a least absolute deviations methodology. Simulation results are compared with previously published forecasts where model coefficients were generated via threestage least squares. Both methodologies appear to be useful and combined forecasts may prove helpful in situations where neither technique dominates. ...|$|E
40|$|Mario Tonveronachi, University of Siena, {{builds on}} his earlier {{proposal}} (The ECB and the Single European Financial Market) to advance financial market integration in Europe {{through the creation}} of a single benchmark yield curve based on <b>debt</b> <b>certificates</b> (DCs) <b>issued</b> by the European Central Bank (ECB). In this policy brief, Tonveronachi discusses potential changes to the ECB's operations and their implications for member-state fiscal rules. He argues that his DC proposal would maintain debt discipline while mitigating the restrictive, counterproductive fiscal stance required today, simultaneously expanding national fiscal space while ensuring debt sustainability under the Maastricht limits, and offering a path out of the self-defeating policy regime currently in place...|$|R
25|$|In 1871, Virginia enacted {{legislation}} exchanging {{two-thirds of}} its outstanding bonds for new <b>debt,</b> and <b>issuing</b> <b>certificates</b> for the remaining one-third of the debt (which the state assumed would be paid by West Virginia) guaranteeing payment once the state's debt dispute with West Virginia was resolved. Virginia enacted legislation in 1879 reducing the interest rate on the outstanding one-third of the debt, {{but was unable to}} discharge the debt due to bondholder resistance. A second sale in 1882 also failed, and in 1892 Virginia issued new bonds to pay off the old one-third debt. Virginia established a commission in 1894 to negotiate with West Virginia over the debt, and in 1900 authorized the commission to accept the 1871 certificates from bondholders with the promise to pay once negotiations with West Virginia concluded.|$|R

40|$|According to the Law on Value-Added Tax, the {{entrepreneurs}} who give the taxable goods/services {{are required to}} report their businesses {{in the process of}} registering themselves as Taxable Entrepreneurs, then they are also required to meet the tax obligations as Taxable Entrepreneurs. Therefore, a Notary/Land <b>Certificate</b> <b>Issuing</b> Officer is responsible to meet the stipulation of the Taxable Entrepreneurs registration except under the circumstances that the Notary/Land <b>Certificate</b> <b>Issuing</b> Officer belongs to Small Scale Entrepreneur. In fact, a regulation is frequently not obeyed by the public including the Notary/Land <b>Certificate</b> <b>Issuing</b> Officer community in Medan, due to several constraints. The result of this study showed that the compliance rate of the Notaries/Land <b>Certificate</b> <b>Issuing</b> Officers in Medan, in terms of their obligation to register themselves as Taxable Entrepreneurs was still low. The most main factor that made the Notaries/Land <b>Certificate</b> <b>Issuing</b> Officers in Medan disobey the regulation was that they had not understood the registration provisions. The effectiveness of the provisions on the registration of Taxable Entrepreneurs in the Notaries/Land <b>Certificate</b> <b>Issuing</b> Officers in Medan is still low and requires constant supervision of the tax authorities...|$|R
