5|$|Garfield's {{assassination}} by an office-seeker amplified {{the public}} demand for civil service reform. Both Democratic and Republican leaders {{realized that they}} could attract the votes of reformers by turning against the spoils system, and by 1882 a bipartisan effort began in favor of reform. In the previous Congress, Sherman's fellow Ohio Senator, Democrat George H. Pendleton, had introduced legislation that required selection of civil servants based on merit as determined by an examination, but Congress declined to act on <b>it</b> <b>right</b> <b>away.</b> Republicans lost seats in the 1882 congressional elections, in which Democrats campaigned on the reform issue, and in the lame duck session were more amenable to civil service reform. Sherman spoke in favor of merit selection and against removing employees from office without cause. He was against the idea that civil servants should have unlimited terms of office but believed that efficiency, not political activity, should determine an employee's length of service. Sherman {{voted in favor of}} Pendleton's bill, and the Senate approved it 38–5. The House concurred by a vote of 155–47. Arthur signed the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act into law on January16, 1883.|$|E

25|$|Frankie Laine was {{somebody}} that everybody knew. He {{was a kind}} of a household word like Frank Sinatra or Bobby Darin or Peggy Lee or Ella Fitzgerald—Frankie Laine {{was one of the great}} popular singers and stylists of that time…And his style…he was one of those artists who had such a unique stamp—nobody sounded like he did. You could hear two notes and you knew who it was and you were right on the beam with <b>it</b> <b>right</b> <b>away.</b> And of course that defines a successful popular artist, at least at that time. These people were all uniquely individual and Frank was on the front rank of those people in his appeal to the public and his success and certainly in his identifiability. — John Williams.|$|E

25|$|Rick Porcello pitched seven innings, {{struck out}} seven, and was aided by 13 runs as he cruised to his twentieth win {{of the season}} in the Friday opener, the first 20-game winner for the Red Sox since Josh Beckett in 2007. The hot bats did not carry over to game two and Boston lost another one-run game. Eduardo Rodríguez went six innings and allowed three runs, two earned, on four hits. Game three saw {{eighteen}} pitchers used by both teams. The respective starters did not make it through the fourth inning, each allowing six runs. Toronto put a five-spot on the board in the third inning, to take a two-run lead, only to give <b>it</b> <b>right</b> <b>away</b> in the fourth and reclaiming it {{in the bottom of the}} inning. Hanley Ramírez made it a one-run game in the fifth on a solo shot and with runners on first and second in the sixth, John Gibbons summoned Joaquín Benoit from the bullpen to face David Ortiz, the same pitcher he hit a grand slam off in game two of the 2013 ALCS, which was the turning point of the series. Ortiz hammered the second pitch into the right field stands to put the Red Sox up for good in this game. He passed Jimmie Foxx in the all-time home run list with 535.|$|E
25|$|According to his accounts, Cooper {{realized}} that these men, who {{on a regular}} basis have seen experimental aircraft flying and landing around them as part of their job of filming those aircraft, were clearly worked up and unnerved. They explained how the saucer hovered over them, landed 50 yards away from them using three extended landing gears and then took off as they approached for a closer look. They took photographs and film. There was a special Pentagon number to call to report such incidents: called and soon was reported up the chain of command until he was instructed by a general to have the film developed, but to make no prints of it, and send <b>it</b> <b>right</b> <b>away</b> in a locked courier pouch. As he had not been instructed to not look at the negatives before sending them, he did. He said the quality of the photography was excellent as would be expected from the experienced photographers who took them. What he saw was exactly what they had described to him. He did not see the film before everything was sent away. He expected {{that there would be a}} follow up investigation since an aircraft of unknown origin had landed in a highly classified military installation, but nothing was ever said of the incident again. He was never able to track down what happened to those photos. He assumed that they ended up going to the Air Force's official UFO investigation, Project Blue Book, which was based at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.|$|E

500|$|The breakthrough—the {{details of}} which are still classified—was {{apparently}} {{the separation of the}} fission and fusion components of the weapons, and to use the X-rays produced by the fission bomb to first compress the fusion fuel (by process known as [...] "radiation implosion") before igniting it. Ulam's idea seems to have been to use mechanical shock from the primary to encourage fusion in the secondary, while Teller quickly realized that X-rays from the primary would do the job much more symmetrically. Some members of the laboratory (J. Carson Mark in particular) later expressed the opinion that the idea to use the x-rays would have eventually occurred to anyone working on the physical processes involved, and that the obvious reason why Teller thought of <b>it</b> <b>right</b> <b>away</b> was because he was already working on the [...] "Greenhouse" [...] tests for the spring of 1951, in which the effect of [...] x-rays from a fission bomb on a mixture of deuterium and tritium was going to be investigated.|$|E
