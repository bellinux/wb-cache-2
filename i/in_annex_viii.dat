40|$|In {{the last}} few years, {{initiatives}} on Smart Grids have been growing in number and scope {{on both sides of}} the Atlantic. A variety of projects has been deployed throughout Europe and US with different aims and results. Substantial public and private investments have been committed to research and development (R&D), demonstration and deployment activities. At this stage, there is a need to evaluate the outcome of implemented projects and share experiences and lessons learned. Effective project assessment and knowledge sharing is instrumental to prioritize policy initiatives, unlock market investment potentials and instil trust and understanding in consumers. The scope of this document is to find common ground between EU and US assessment approaches on Smart Grid projects. First of all, we need to make sure we understand each other’s language. We need to assess correspondences among definitions, terminology and methodological approaches, in order to clarify commonalities and differences. Secondly, we need to strengthen cooperation on assessment frameworks and on sharing data collection experiences, project results and lessons learned. This joint work is carried out in the framework of the US-EU Energy Council, which intends to deepen the transatlantic dialogue on strategic energy issues such as policies to move towards low carbon energy sources while strengthening the ongoing scientific collaboration on energy technologies. In this context, a first meeting among EU and US experts on Smart Grid Assessment framework was held on the 6 th of December 2010 in Albuquerque, where a set of cooperation items was identified. The outcome of the first meeting has resulted in an interim version of this document which has then served as basis of discussion for a second meeting, which was held on the 7 th of November 2011 in Washington (the list of participants is reported <b>in</b> <b>ANNEX</b> <b>VIII).</b> The outcomes of the meeting have been incorporated in this final report, which provides a framework for EU-US cooperation on Smart Grid assessment methodologies and highlights a number of open issues for further common work.

40|$|Besides {{the set of}} Priority Substances {{laid down}} <b>in</b> <b>Annex</b> X of the Water Framework Directive 2000 / 60 /EC (WFD), which are {{regulated}} and to be monitored at EU level, the EU Member States (MS) need to identify pollutants of regional or local importance (in particular substances listed <b>in</b> WFD, <b>Annex</b> <b>VIII)</b> and provide environmental quality standards (EQS), monitoring schemes, and regulatory measures for them. This means that MS need to decide which are the candidate substances for further investigation and which are the substances then to be declared as River Basin-Specific Pollutants (RBSP). This requires assessments of impacts as well as prioritisation efforts and strategic screening for substances possibly causing concern. While {{this is a matter}} of discretion for each of the MS of concern, there is as yet no harmonisation of the procedures involved. Therefore, JRC (European Commission, Joint Research Centre) and NORMAN (Network of Reference Laboratories for the Monitoring of Emerging Environmental Substances) organized a workshop in order to support MS. The objective of the workshop was to provide a common forum for MS and interested groups for presenting, discussing and streamlining approaches for a harmonised selection and monitoring of RBSP in the WFD context. Particular attention was given to emerging contaminants, as their prioritisation and monitoring are particularly challenging. The workshop aimed to produce clear recommendations on how to proceed.
