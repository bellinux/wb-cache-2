500|$|Also, Johns {{is portrayed}} as a kleptomaniac, a person who compulsively steals objects of little to no value. It is a {{reference}} to Johns's art style, as he usually uses objects from everyday life for his artwork. In a scene in the episode, Homer channels his anger into his art. The scene is {{a reference to the}} 1959 comedy horror film A Bucket of Blood, in which an artist <b>is</b> <b>screaming</b> at a piece of clay to be a nose. After having flooded Springfield, Homer tells Marge that the city is [...] "like Venice, without the black plague". The line refers to the outbreak of the bubonic plague that swept through Europe in the 14th century. In the scene, a lion can be seen swimming in the water. The notion that lions can swim is a reference to the season 2 episode [...] "Bart the Daredevil", in which the famous daredevil Lance Murdock performs a stunt which involves swimming lions.|$|E
500|$|The glass cage might imply {{a vacuum}} that the figure's voice {{is unable to}} escape; as if it <b>is</b> <b>screaming</b> in silence. Rueful later in life, Bacon {{said that he had}} [...] "wanted to paint the scream more than the horror. I think, if I had really thought about what causes {{somebody}} to really scream, it would have made the scream... more successful". The work evokes memories of the Second World War. The glass enclosure of his 1949 Chicago Study for a Portrait is often seen as prophesying photographs of Adolf Eichmann's 1961 trial before a Jerusalem District Court, when he was held within a similar cage. Bacon strongly resisted literal comparisons though, and stated that he used the device so he could frame and [...] "really see the image—for no other reason. I know it's been interpreted as being many other things." [...] Other critics saw similarities between the glass case and the radio booths of late 1930s broadcasters who warned against the impending calamity. Denis Farr notes that Bacon was sympathetic to George Orwell and referred in interviews to Orwellian [...] "shouting voices... and trembling hands... convey the harsh atmosphere of an interrogation." ...|$|E

To this question Mars said [...] "It definitely sounds awesome. Right? Isn't that what matters? It's an awesome song! I don't know how to tell you that more". In another interview, this time for Rolling Stone, he explained that the track is about [...] "good old animalistic sex". When the interviewer asked if Mars was concerned with the verses [...] "Got a body full of liquor with a cocaine kicker" [...] due to his 2010 drug bust, he replied [...] "To take that line out would dilute my art", since the recording [...] "needs a sense of danger.

Michael enters the building and realizes that he has a [...] "dead man switch", meaning that if Wyath is shot, then the whole building will blow up. Gabriel goes up near the window to handle a man who <b>is</b> <b>screaming,</b> and the police are prepared to shoot him. However, to prevent Gabriel from using his switch, Michael jumps at him, causing him to divert his path. Gabriel knocks him out, and shortly after injects him with ketamine. Michael suddenly wakes up in his [...] "green reality". Michael is looking for a ring, which is Dr. Wild's. He sees a hallucination of a penguin, caused by the drugs. The penguin tells him that Rex has the ring. He calls him down, and Rex reveals that he stole it for his girlfriend, Emma (Daniela Bobadilla). Michael meets Emma and gets the ring back. Dr. Evans (Cherry Jones) claims that he is [...] "having a nightmare about madness". He wakes up in the [...] "red reality" [...] and sees Dr. Lee helping him. The police are coming in to shoot him. Michael quickly phones and tells them to stop, due to the [...] "dead man switch". Gabriel and Michael talk about Gabriel's two reality life. This makes Michael think about his life. Shortly later, Michael and Dr. Evans are talking about his mind. He thinks about his life and tells her that he is okay. During a subsequent discussion, he finds out that Dr. Lee was not really inside his mind; he was actually helping himself.|$|E

2500|$|The {{band has}} been {{categorized}} under many genres of heavy music. Mainly categorized as heavy metal, hard rock, progressive metal and metalcore, Avenged Sevenfold's music {{has evolved over}} most of the band's career. At first, the band's debut album Sounding the Seventh Trumpet consisted almost entirely of a metalcore sound; however, there were several deviations from this genre, most notably in [...] "Streets", which shows a punk rock style, and [...] "Warmness on the Soul", which is a piano ballad. On Waking the Fallen, the band displayed a metalcore style once more, but added more clean singing and leaned a bit more towards metal and bit less close to hardcore. In the band's DVD All Excess, producer Andrew Murdock explained this transition: [...] "When I met the band after Sounding the Seventh Trumpet had come out before they had recorded Waking the Fallen, M. Shadows said to me 'This record <b>is</b> <b>screaming.</b> The record we want to make is going to be half-screaming half-singing. I don't want to scream anymore. And the record after {{that is going to be}} all singing'." ...|$|E

60|$|The {{scope of}} the Ragley {{inquiries}} may now be understood. It must not be forgotten that witchcraft was a topic of deep interest to these students. They solemnly quote the records of trials {{in which it is}} perfectly evident that girls and boys, either in a spirit of wicked mischief, or suffering from hysterical illusions, make grotesque charges against poor old women. The witches always prick, pinch, and torment their victims, being present to them, though invisible to the bystanders. This was called 'spectral evidence'; and the Mathers, during the fanatical outbreaks at Salem, admit that this 'spectral evidence,' unsupported, is of no legal value. Indeed, taken literally, Cotton Mather's cautions on the subject of evidence may almost be called sane and sensible. But the Protestant inquisitors always discovered evidence confirmatory. For example, a girl <b>is</b> <b>screaming</b> out against an invisible witch; a man, to please her, makes a snatch at the empty air where she points, and finds in his hand a fragment of stuff, which again is proved to be torn from the witch's dress. It is easy to see how this trick could be played. Again, a possessed girl cries that a witch is tormenting her with an iron spindle, grasps at the spindle (visible only to her), and, lo, it is in her hand, and is the property of the witch. Here is proof positive! Again, a girl at Stoke Trister, in Somerset, is bewitched by Elizabeth Style, of Bayford, widow. The rector of the parish, the Rev. William Parsons, deposes that the girl, in a fit, pointed to different parts of her body, 'and where she pointed, he perceived a red spot to arise, with a small black in the midst of it, like a small thorn'; and other evidence was given to the same effect. The phenomenon is akin to many which, according to medical and scientific testimony, occur to patients in the hypnotic state. The so-called stigmata of Louise Lateau, and of the shepherd boy put up by the Archbishop of Reims as a substitute for Joan of Arc, are cases in point. But Glanvill, who quotes the record of the trial (January, 1664), holds that witchcraft is proved by the coincidence of the witch's confession that she, the devil, and others made an image of the girl and pierced it with thorns! The confession is a piece of pure folklore: poor old Elizabeth Style merely copies the statements of French and Scotch witches. The devil appeared as a handsome man, and as a black dog! Glanvill denies that she was tortured, or 'watched'--that is, kept awake till her brain reeled. But his own account makes it plain that she was 'watched' after her confession at least, when the devil, under the form of a butterfly, appeared in her cell.|$|E
