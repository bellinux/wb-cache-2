The electrons or positive ions resulting from this event are then detected.

5000|$|According to the {{principles}} of Doppler cooling, an atom modelled as a two-level atom can be cooled using a laser. If it moves in a specific direction and encounters a counter-propagating laser beam resonant with its transition, it is very likely to absorb a photon. The absorption of this photon gives the atom a [...] "kick" [...] in the direction that is consistent with momentum conservation and brings the atom to its excited state. However, this state is unstable and some time later the atom decays back to its ground state via spontaneous emission [...] (after a time on the order of nanoseconds, for example in Rubidium 87 the excited state of the D2 transition has a lifetime of 26.2 ns). The photon will be reemitted (and the atom will again increase its speed), but its direction will be random. When averaging over a large number of these processes applied to one atom, one sees that the absorption process decreases the speed always in the same direction (as the absorbed photon comes from a monodirectional source), whereas the emission process does not lead to any change in the speed of the atom because the <b>emission</b> <b>direction</b> is random. Thus the atom is being effectively slowed down by the laser beam.|$|E

The spectrally resolved {{degree of coherence}} of resonantly scattered light is deduced from the intensity fluctuations over its <b>emission</b> <b>directions</b> (speckles). The spectral intensity correlation gives a direct measure of the dephasing rate within the inhomogeneously broadened ensemble.

This method determines the decays of intensity and coherence separately, thus distinguishing lifetime from pure dephasing. The secondary emission of excitons in semiconductor quantum wells is investigated. Here the combination of static disorder and inelastic scattering leads to a partially coherent emission.

Sputtered Mo was collected on carbon foils and subsequently analyzed using SIMS to quantify variations in the ^(92) Mo: ^(100) Mo ratio {{as a function of}} emission angle in the sputtering geometry and projectile fluence. In general, the sputtered material was found to be enriched in the light isotope, with the enrichment being most pronounced in near-normal <b>emission</b> <b>directions.</b> This angular dependence was clearly resolved at the lowest bombarding fluences, although it was also seen under steady-state conditions. The most extreme low-fluence angular variation was seen for 5 keV Xe^+ bombardment at a fluence of 3. 0 × 10 ^(14) ions cm^(− 2), for which the sputtered light-isotope enrichment was ∼ 30 %o larger in near-normal <b>emission</b> <b>directions</b> than in oblique directions. The low-fluence angular variation was observed to have a projectile dependence. In the near-normal direction, light-isotope enrichments as large as 53 ± 5 %o with respect to the steady-state ratio at the same angle were measured. Similar results were found for secondary Mo^+ ions sputtered by 14. 5 keV O^−. The observed effects are generall consistent with other low-fluence measurements of sputtered neutrals and secondary ions from solid targets, and with the results of multiple-interaction computer simulations, but do not agree well with the predictions of analytic theory...|$|R
