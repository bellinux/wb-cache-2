5|$|Originally {{created for}} <b>deer</b> <b>hunting,</b> Richmond Park now has 630 red and fallow deer that roam freely within {{much of the}} park. A cull takes place each November and February to ensure numbers can be sustained. Some deer are also killed in road accidents, through ingesting litter such as small items of plastic, or by dogs; three deer were killed by dogs in 2012. Many of the deer in Richmond Park are {{infected}} with a bacterium called Borrelia burgdorferi which can be transmitted to humans through a tick bite causing Lyme disease.|$|E

An informal association of businesses, the Joppenbergh Mountain Advisory Group (JMAG), began working with the WVLT to create a land use policy. The WVLT began having monthly meetings with the JMAG, and with town and state departments; its stated goal was to combine Joppenbergh's development with the rehabilitation of the adjacent railroad trestle and subsequent expansion of the rail trail. In late September 2012, the WVLT held a hearing on a proposed land use plan that would allow <b>deer</b> <b>hunting</b> on the property beginning in 2013, and would prohibit entry into several caves on the mountain.|$|E

5|$|The deer- and boar-hunting {{scenes are}} less clearly connected, {{although}} scholars {{have attempted to}} link each animal to Gawain's reactions in the parallel seduction scene. Attempts to connect the <b>deer</b> <b>hunt</b> with the first seduction scene have unearthed a few parallels. <b>Deer</b> <b>hunts</b> of the time, like courtship, {{had to be done}} according to established rules. Women often favoured suitors who hunted well and skinned their animals, sometimes even watching while a deer was cleaned. The sequence describing the <b>deer</b> <b>hunt</b> is relatively unspecific and nonviolent, with an air of relaxation and exhilaration. The first seduction scene follows in a similar vein, with no overt physical advances and no apparent danger; the entire exchange is humorously portrayed.|$|R

25|$|An {{important}} {{management development}} has been the stringent control of deer in the Murchison Mountains and other takahē areas of Fiordland National Park. Following the introduction of <b>deer</b> <b>hunting</b> by helicopter, deer numbers have decreased dramatically and alpine vegetation is now recovering from years of heavy browsing. This improvement in its habitat has helped to increase takahē breeding success and survival. Current research aims to measure the impact of attacks by stoats and thus decide whether stoats are a significant problem requiring management.|$|E

25|$|Throughout {{medieval times}} {{the area was}} part of a <b>deer</b> <b>hunting</b> park known as Hallamshire Chase.

Lydgate Hall was one of the earliest substantial buildings in the area as it existed in the early 1700s although it was substantially altered and extended in the early 19th century. It was the home of the steel magnate Horatio Bright (1827–1905) for the last 30 years of his life. The Hall was eventually demolished in the 1930s being replaced by housing on Lydgate Hall Crescent.|$|E
25|$|Native American—specifically the Creek's—beliefs {{revolved}} around respecting the environment. The Creek {{believed they had}} a unique relationship with the animals they hunted. The Creek had several rules surround how a hunt could occur, particularly prohibiting needless killing of deer. There were specific taboos against taking the skins of unhealthy deer. However, the lucrative deerskin trade prompted hunters to act {{past the point of}} restraint they had operated under before. The hunting economy collapsed due to the scarcity of deer as they were over-hunted and lost their lands to white settlers. Due to the decline of deer populations, and the governmental pressure to switch to the colonists’ way of life, animal husbandry replaced <b>deer</b> <b>hunting</b> both as an income and in the diet.|$|E
25|$|White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) — The {{population}} in the state is enormous and growing {{in large part because}} of the expansion of rural residential lands that are hospitable for deer but not suitable for hunting. Other factors are the mixture of young and mature forests, milder winters, and fewer predators. Deer were nearly eliminated from the state by the end of the nineteenth century, with fewer than 20 in all of Connecticut, although they were on the rebound by that point, in part due to state regulations to protect them. In 1907 the state allowed landowners to shoot deer causing crop damage.l In 1974, the state passed its first deer management act and regular, licensed <b>deer</b> <b>hunting</b> began the next year. By the 1970s, the total state population was about 20,000, and up to 76,000 (a low estimate) in 2000.|$|E
