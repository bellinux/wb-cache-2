5|$|Powers {{helped the}} police perform a sting operation, telling Seymour {{that the police}} <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> {{and that the only}} way to save Williams was to dig up the gun and move it to somewhere more safe. When Seymour and Powers went to do this, several policemen (who had been lying in wait) {{immediately}} arrested her and Powers (who was released a few hours later). Seymour was in a poor condition both physically and mentally, and after a few hours she wrote and signed a statement which incriminated Williams. Powers again helped the police, convincing Williams to meet him at Moorgate station, where Williams was arrested by the police and charged with the murder of Arthur Walls. Williams maintained that he was innocent of the murder and burglary.|$|E
500|$|Upon his release, Power went to Seymour {{and told}} her that the police <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> and {{that the only way to}} save Williams was to dig up the gun and move it somewhere safer. Seymour and Power {{retrieved}} the gun on 15 October; ...|$|E
500|$|..... {{the most}} {{important}} person in the flat [...] was never, ever seen; it was the spirit of Del's (and Rodney's) beloved mother Joan who had passed away 17 years before, and throughout the run of the series Del constantly referred to her and past events within the Trotter Family. ... But much of his historical information was at best contradictory, and [...] outright lies. We were left with a situation where the only person who really <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> was an unreliable witness, so I decided to return to those misty days of 1960 to meet all those characters we'd only ever heard about ...|$|E

But I <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> to me. It's Conversion. I've always known. [...] . But this is being a fool. Talk! I'm going to stop it." ...|$|R

500|$|A love {{triangle}} between Natasha, Andrew and Summer is formed. Natasha's {{feelings for}} Andrew grow when they organise a party together, but she notices Andrew's concern for Summer when she collapses and warns Summer away from Andrew. Natasha later asks Andrew if he loves her, {{but he does}} not reply. In December 2010, Summer and Andrew give into their feelings for each other and have sex. Novakovic said Natasha would be [...] "devastated" [...] if she <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> and that she would not let Andrew and Summer off lightly. Andrew tells Natasha {{that he is going to}} business meeting, but he meets Summer instead. While they are together in Summer's house, a fire breaks out. Natasha sees the smoke and calls her father and the emergency services before entering the house to rescue Summer, unaware Andrew is also there. Novakovic explained Natasha's ordeal: [...] "Natasha is pulled from the fire by her dad, Michael. Andrew and Summer are rescued separately, and Natasha has no idea of the reason why Andrew was in the house - he was cheating on her with Summer!" [...] After the rescue, Natasha has to come to terms with the fact she will be scarred from a burn she sustains on her neck. Novakovic said that it is a [...] "big deal" [...] for Natasha, as she aspires to be a model and this could ruin her chances. Novakovic also opines that Summer wants nothing more than to be with Andrew, but how can she take him when Natasha tried to save her? Novakovic believed Natasha was blasé to their feelings adding [...] "Deep down, I think Natasha knows that there's something going on, but she doesn't want to admit it to herself. But sooner or later, I reckon she'll have to face the inevitable." ...|$|E
2500|$|Roy Huggins {{was just}} {{starting}} his career when Wray was at Paramount, but {{he had his own}} encounter with McCarthyism a few years later and ultimately took the advice that Wray could not and named names. [...] Boris Ingster's career had not been affected by the McCarthy era, but he had worked as a writer and director at RKO and Paramount in the 1940s and <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> to her, and there is little doubt that, together, he and Huggins orchestrated her return to screenwriting.|$|E
2500|$|Peppino’s mother, Felicia Bartolotta Impastato, {{reacted to}} the {{conviction}} in a very dignified manner: [...] "I never have had any feelings of revenge. All I have done is call for justice for my son’s death. I have to confess that, {{after so many years}} of waiting, I had lost faith; I never thought we would reach this point. Now I feel a great deal of contentment and of satisfaction. I always <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened.</b> Badalamenti used to call my husband Luigi to complain about Peppino, and my husband begged him not to kill the boy." ...|$|E

2500|$|Stoppard's {{mother died}} in 1996. The family had not talked about their history and neither brother <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> to the family left behind in Czechoslovakia. In the early 1990s, {{with the fall of}} communism, Stoppard found out that all four of his {{grandparents}} had been Jewish and had died in Terezin, Auschwitz and other camps, along with three of his mother's sisters. In 1998, following the deaths of his parents he returned to Zlín {{for the first time in}} over 50 years. He has expressed grief both for a lost father and a missing past, but he has no sense of being a survivor, at whatever remove. [...] "I feel incredibly lucky not to have had to survive or die. It's a conspicuous part of what might be termed a charmed life." ...|$|E
60|$|Edgar scarce <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened,</b> but {{the instant}} the square was broken Sergeant Bowen threw himself beside him.|$|E

60|$|And {{an instant}} later, by {{the tone of}} Spurstow's voice calling upon them to enter, the men <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened.</b> There {{was no need to}} wake him.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Drive {{on up to}} the house, Jarvis,' she said, and Mrs Drassilis was whirled away {{round the}} curve of the drive before she <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> to her.|$|E

6000|$|... "To-day, child, to-day? How can you <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> in {{that region}} to-day? It would take eight or ten days for the word to come." ...|$|R
25|$|The Miami Herald {{reports that}} Abul Hashem's family didn't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> to him until 2004, when the Red Crescent {{informed}} {{them he was}} in Guantanamo.|$|R
60|$|The Steam <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> at once; {{for when}} a ship finds herself {{all the talking}} of the {{separate}} pieces ceases and melts into one voice, which is {{the soul of the}} ship.|$|E
6000|$|Selina looked frightened. 'He didn't mean you, dear,' {{she said}} as they moved on. 'We thought perhaps you <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened,</b> owing to your coming just at this time. Had you--heard {{anything}} about--what I intended?' ...|$|E
60|$|A {{suppressed}} cheer {{broke from}} the whole party; for until now only Mr. Johnson and those on guard with him <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened,</b> and {{the silence of the}} guns had been a mystery to all.|$|E
60|$|At {{eight o'clock}} in the evening Minikin called round from the office to <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened.</b> Seeking help from shame, I confessed to him the truth.|$|R

6000|$|... "We {{came back}} safely; but he dragged himself up the {{stairway}} {{with his face}} all twisted the next night, and I <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> before he told me. 'Those devils have poisoned me,' said he." ...|$|E
60|$|Before Cynthia quite <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> {{the seat}} on the pillion {{in front of her}} was empty, and she was riding back to Stafford with Crispin beside her, his hand upon the bridle of her horse.|$|E
6000|$|Mackintosh {{stared at}} him, {{wondering}} whether he <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened,</b> and whether, when he knew, he would realise on what terms he and Walker had been. He went about his work, sleek, silent, and smiling, {{and who could}} tell his thoughts? ...|$|E

6000|$|She smiled {{through her}} perplexity {{as she took}} his hand. 'The oddest things happen to me, dear Swithin,' she said. 'Do you wish {{particularly}} to <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> now?' ...|$|R
