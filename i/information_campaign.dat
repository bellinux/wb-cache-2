5|$|The war was {{accompanied}} by a media battle between Russia and Georgia. The Russian military brought Russian journalists to the combat zone to report news discrediting Georgia and portraying Russia as the saviour of Russian citizens in the conflict zone. Russia also aired television footage supporting its actions which had a strong effect on the local populations of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. In a first for Russia, a Russian Armed Forces spokesman was provided by the Russian authorities to give television interviews about the war. Despite these tactics and domestic success, the Russian <b>information</b> <b>campaign</b> against Georgia was not successful internationally. In response to the information war, the Georgian government halted the broadcasting of Russian television channels in Georgia and blocked access to Russian websites. The information skirmishes between Georgia and Russia continued after armed hostilities had ended. According to political scientist Svante Cornell, the Kremlin spent millions in an international <b>information</b> <b>campaign</b> to blame Georgia for the war. Cornell writes that there is evidence, including some in Russian media, that Russia actually started the war.|$|E

The Croatian Mine Action Centre actively supports NGOs to develop as many programmes as possible and attract new NGOs to mine-awareness and educational activities. It maintains an accessible online database with cartographic information on the location of mine-suspected areas in Croatia.|$|E
5|$|Ahn's co-founding of the Association for Teachers of English in Korea (ATEK), and {{subsequent}} {{development of a}} controversial public <b>information</b> <b>campaign</b> protesting government discrimination against foreign teachers resulted in dozens of foreign teachers filing formal complaints against the Korean government with the National Human Rights Commission of Korea. Parties opposing Ahn's work countered with a smear campaign against him, spreading completely fabricated allegations of sex crimes in order to discredit him. After a stint in China he moved to Metro Manila, Philippines, establishing the country's first reputation management consultancy {{and two years later}} establishing the country's first digital public relations agency. Ahn taught a graduate-level course on digital public relations at De La Salle University, speaks on the subject of digital public relations at a wide variety of industry conferences, and writes on the subject. He also contributes occasional news features to a number of national media outlets and writes literary fiction.|$|E

5|$|The Red Army {{initiated}} {{an offensive}} into East Prussia in October 1944, {{but it was}} temporarily driven back two weeks later. After that, the German Ministry of Propaganda reported that war crimes {{had taken place in}} East Prussian villages, in particular in Nemmersdorf, where inhabitants had been raped and killed by the advancing Soviets. Since the Nazi war effort had largely stripped the civil population of able-bodied men for service in the military, the victims of the atrocity were primarily old men, women, and children. Upon the Soviet withdrawal from the area, German authorities sent in film crews to document what had happened, and invited foreign observers as further witnesses. A documentary film from the footage obtained during this effort was put together and shown in cinemas in East Prussia, with the intention of fanaticising civilian and military resolve in resisting the Soviets. A Nazi <b>information</b> <b>campaign</b> about the atrocities at Nemmersdorf, as well as other crimes committed in East Prussia, convinced the remaining civilians that they should not get caught by the advancing enemy.|$|E

40|$|<b>Information</b> <b>campaigns</b> to {{increase}} tax compliance could be framed in different ways. They can either highlight the potential gains when tax compliance is high, or the potential losses when compliance is low. According to regulatory focus theory, such framing should {{be most effective}} when it is congruent with the promotion or prevention focus of its recipients. Two studies confirmed the hypothesized interaction effects between recipients' regulatory focus and framing of <b>information</b> <b>campaigns,</b> with tax compliance being highest under conditions of regulatory fit. To address taxpayers effectively, <b>information</b> <b>campaigns</b> by tax authorities should consider {{the positive and negative}} framing of information, and the moderating effect of recipients' regulatory focus. ...|$|R

25|$|As of September 2017, a measles {{epidemic}} was ongoing across Europe, especially Eastern Europe. In Romania, {{there were}} about 9300 cases of measels, and 34 people â€“ {{all of whom were}} unvaccinated â€“ had died of measles. This was preceded by a 2008 controversy regarding the HPV vaccine. In 2012, doctor Christa Todea-Gross published a free downloadable book online, this book contained misinformation about vaccination from abroad translated into Romanian, which significantly stimulated the growth of the anti-vaccine movement. The government of Romania officially declared a measles epidemic in September 2016, and started an <b>information</b> <b>campaign</b> to encourage parents to have their children vaccinated. By February 2017, however, the stockpile of MMR vaccines was depleted, and doctors were overburdened. Around April, the vaccine stockpile had been restored, but by May 2017, the death toll had risen to 25.|$|E
25|$|In September 1983, county voters {{approved}} a referendum by a 7-3 margin to release up to $900 million in bonds to create two toll roads, the Hardy Toll Road (basically a reliever for I-45 between downtown Houston and Montgomery County) and the Sam Houston Tollway, {{which would be}} the main lanes of the Beltway. Shortly after the referendum, the Harris County Commissioners Court created the HCTRA to administer the construction and operation of the new road system. Then-County Judge Jon Lindsay is generally credited with shepherding the referendum from its infancy to its passage, along with the implementation of the plan for the roadway. During the public <b>information</b> <b>campaign</b> leading up to the referendum, the county government published brochures stating that the toll roads would become free once their construction costs had been recouped, but the tolls were not removed after the tollways were paid off.|$|E
25|$|Batteries {{are used}} either as sole or as backup power for {{residential}} smoke detectors. Mains-operated detectors have disposable or rechargeable batteries; others run only on 9-volt disposable batteries. When the battery is exhausted a battery-only smoke detector becomes inactive; most smoke detectors chirp repeatedly if the battery is low. It {{has been found}} that battery-powered smoke detectors in many houses have dead batteries. It has been estimated that in the UK over 30% of smoke alarms may have dead or removed batteries. In response public information campaigns have been created to remind people to change smoke detector batteries regularly. In Australia, for example, a public <b>information</b> <b>campaign</b> suggests that smoke alarm batteries should be replaced on April Fools' Day every year. In regions using daylight saving time, campaigns may suggest that people change their batteries when they change their clocks or on a birthday.|$|E
40|$|The New Zealand government, {{state owned}} {{enterprises}} and private organisations have been active, {{in the past}} and currently, in promoting energy efficiency and energy conservation through <b>information</b> provision <b>campaigns.</b> However, with a few exceptions, there has been a failure {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the programmes, and therefore assess whether the programmes have worked. Given the resources that are committed to the development and implementation of these <b>information</b> <b>campaigns,</b> it is important to assess how effective they are. Evaluation of these campaigns can help determine the most appropriate approaches that should be taken in the future, and helps to improve existing campaigns. Evaluation also has an important role to play in terms of accountability within the organisations that operate these <b>information</b> <b>campaigns.</b> A general evaluation process was designed in this research for the evaluation of two selected energy efficiency <b>information</b> <b>campaigns.</b> The evaluation process was designed after thorough reviews of past evaluations of similar campaigns, both in New Zealand and internationally, and from an extensive review of the theoretical and applied literature on programme evaluation. Home energy audit programmes were selected as the energy efficiency <b>information</b> <b>campaigns</b> to be evaluated, with the Energy Efficiency Assessment Plan operated by Southpower, and the Home Energy Rating Options programme being operated by CentralPower being chosen as the two case studies. The results indicate that the programmes evaluated do indeed work; however, analysis suggests that these programmes may be less effective than their potential. From the selected case studies a number of recommendations were developed to improve the effectiveness of the programmes, with a review of the methodology highlighting the limitations of the study. Finally, consideration was given to the role that programme evaluation has in the development, implementation and operation of energy efficiency <b>information</b> <b>campaigns</b> in the future, and its usefulness in assessing the effectiveness of energy efficiency <b>information</b> <b>campaigns</b> in New Zealand...|$|R

25|$|Pataki's term {{had been}} marked with annual debates with the State Legislature over the powers {{allocated}} to the Executive and Legislative Branches on {{the adoption of the}} state budget. Pataki argued that the state constitution and court rulings gave him the power to submit a budget that allocated revenue and set policy. Pataki said the Legislature could then only change the numbers but could not change any policy decisions made in the budget document. Pataki and the Legislature ended up in court and the courts ruled in Pataki's favor, giving him more budgetary power. In 2005, the Legislature placed a constitutional amendment on the ballot to allocate more budget power to them. Pataki led a successful public <b>information</b> <b>campaign</b> to defeat this provision and to retain his budget authority. In 2006, Pataki vetoed {{a large part of the}} budget adopted by the Legislature because of these rulings.|$|E
25|$|As much as {{involving}} {{itself in}} designs for industry, the Constructivists worked on public festivals and street {{designs for the}} post-October revolution Bolshevik government. Perhaps {{the most famous of}} these was in Vitebsk, where Malevich's UNOVIS Group painted propaganda plaques and buildings (the best known being El Lissitzky's poster Beat the Whites with the Red Wedge (1919)). Inspired by Vladimir Mayakovsky's declaration 'the streets our brushes, the squares our palettes', artists and designers participated in public life during the Civil War. A striking instance was the proposed festival for the Comintern congress in 1921 by Alexander Vesnin and Liubov Popova, which resembled the constructions of the OBMOKhU exhibition as well as their work for the theatre. There {{was a great deal of}} overlap during this period between Constructivism and Proletkult, the ideas of which concerning the need to create an entirely new culture struck a chord with the Constructivists. In addition some Constructivists were heavily involved in the 'ROSTA Windows', a Bolshevik public <b>information</b> <b>campaign</b> of around 1920. Some of the most famous of these were by the poet-painter Vladimir Mayakovsky and Vladimir Lebedev.|$|E
500|$|In the Carolinas, the National Guard was mobilised by {{the evening}} of October 15 to prevent looting along {{affected}} areas of the coastline. On October 17, President Dwight D. Eisenhower declared a [...] "major disaster" [...] in the Carolinas, and offered [...] "immediate and unlimited federal assistance." [...] Recovery was quick, and by October 24, all but two units were demobilised. Another concern was the rebuilding of the sand dunes along waterfronts. An artificial sand dune barrier, [...] long, was completed by October 30, which {{in the long run}} led to a more rapid natural build-up of larger dunes. With Myrtle Beach a popular tourist destination, the Chamber of Commerce began an <b>information</b> <b>campaign</b> to inform the public, which might have erroneously concluded from the massive media coverage that the city had been destroyed, that the city would be ready for the coming summer. The rebuilding after the partial destruction would transform Myrtle Beach from a [...] "quaint summer colony to a high-rise resort city".|$|E
