Duration of office of <b>steering</b> <b>committee</b> members: (2004) Different countries have different circumstances with regard to the national participation in ridge-related activities etc. For nations that do not have large ridge research groups, {{it can be difficult to}} have a 4 -year rotation of <b>steering</b> <b>committee</b> members. IR therefore recommends that <b>steering</b> <b>committee</b> members are rotated regularly, the ideal would be every 4 years, but the nations themselves will decide on the timing of this. IR previous chair: (2004) The previous chair should stay on the <b>steering</b> <b>committee</b> for an additional year, as part of a handover phase so that there is continuity and a smooth transition between changing office locations.

Insight into the design of <b>steering</b> <b>committees</b> and what interrelated governance components are required is very limited. We propose a multi-leveled model to design effective <b>steering</b> <b>committees.</b> We develop this theoretical model and surmise that our project-based IT governance model offers more effective control. This proposition was developed using a sequential mixed-methods approach that combines qualitative and quantitative inquiry, and empirical research. We articulate a theoretical model informed by the punctuated socio-technical change model, which synthesizes the dynamic capabilities and other components that influence <b>steering</b> <b>committee</b> performance. We find <b>steering</b> <b>committees</b> can achieve implementation success by balancing dynamic capabilities, structure, processes, and objectives. Contrary to common expectations, we learn that balanced, dynamic and agile <b>steering</b> <b>committees</b> are more effective than those that follow stale, procedural or routine approaches...|$|R
