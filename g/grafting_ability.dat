40|$|We {{describe}} {{the synthesis of}} biotin end functionalized poly(sulfonic acid) s via living radical polymerization (LRP) for conjugation to Avidin. Quartz crystal microbalance (QCM-D) and competitive binding studies were used to confirm this conjugation. A biotin initiator for copper-mediated LRP was used to provide acrylamide and methacrylate based polymers with the functional end group. This investigation revealed that 2 -acrylamido- 2 -methyl- 1 -propanesulfonic acid was not a suitable monomer in its acid form but was successfully used in its sodium salt form. A second monomer, 3 -sulfopropylmethacrylate as the potassium salt was also studied and both monomers produced polymers with polydispersities < 1. 3 and 1. 4, respectively. Evolution of molecular weight with respect to time indicated that the polymerization of the acrylamide polymer is controlled.

40|$|The alloimmunogenic {{potential}} {{of each of}} the tooth graft components (periodontal ligament, mineralized root surface and passenger leukocytes) was evaluated. The model employed was orthotopic tooth allografts in inbred strains of Syrian hamsters. Isolated allogenic mineralized root surface is not immunogenic, as was demonstrated by the inability of tooth grafts to stimulate accelerated rejection of a subsequent skin graft if the tooth had undergone pretransplant enzymolysis of its periodontal ligament. Similarly, tooth grafts were rendered nonimmunogenic if exposed to repeated freezing and thawing. In contrast, isolated allogenic periodontal ligament on a syngeneic tooth graft was shown to evoke an accelerated rejection of skin grafts. Thus, the normal median survival time of skin (11. 3 days) in the strain combination of hamsters employed was reduced to 7. 4 days following exposure to an orthotopic tooth graft in which the periodontal ligament was the only obvious source of alloantigen.

40|$|Because of {{the liver}} <b>graft's</b> <b>ability</b> to resist {{cytotoxic}} antibody-mediated rejection, it has become dogma that the conventional transplant crossmatch used to avoid hyperacute rejection of other organs is irrelevant to the liver. We examined this hypothesis in a consecutive series of adult primary liver recipients treated with FK 506 and low-dose steroids. Twenty-five of 231 (10. 8 %) patients received a liver from a cytotoxic-positive crossmatch donor (more than 50 % of donor T lymphocytes were killed by dithiothre-itol-pretreated recipient serum). The outcome was {{compared with that of}} 50 negative crossmatch patients who had their transplantations just before and after the crossmatch positive cases. The one-year graft and patient survivals were 56 % and 68 %, for positive and 82 % and 86 % for negative crossmatch patients (P= 0. 004, P= 0. 03, respectively). The difference between patient and first graft survival was accounted for by retransplantation, which was 4 times more frequent in the positive-crossmatch cases. Histologically, failed allografts obtained at the time of retransplantation revealed a spectrum of pathologic findings related to vascular injury. This study showed a higher difficulty of intraoperative blood product management, a degraded prognosis, and a poorer average quality of ultimate graft function when liver transplantation was performed against positive cytotoxic crossmatches. In such patients for whom crossmatch-negative donors may never be found because of the broad extent and intensity of sensitization, special therapeutic strategies perioperatively must be evolved if results are to improve. © 1992 by Williams and Wilkins...|$|R

We employed manometry of the portal system and ultrasonic flowmetry of graft inflow to study the <b>graft’s</b> <b>ability</b> in relieving portal hypertension and accommodating portal hyperperfusion. Possible correlation of the findings from such observations with surgical outcomes was investigated. The median ages of the recipients and donors of this 46 consecutive LDLT were 50 years (range, 16 to 66 years) and 31 years (range, 18 to 54 years), respectively. Graft to standard liver volume was 47. 4 % (range, 32. 4 to 69. 0 %). The hospital mortality was 4. 4 % as two recipients had died from sepsis. Portal pressure dropped by 8 mmHg (range, - 7 to 19 mmHg) from 23 mmHg (range, 8 to 37 mmHg) to 14 mmHg (range, 10 to 26 mmHg) after LDLT. Portal infl ow had a positive correlation with portal pressure before native liver hepatectomy (R 2 = 0. 305) (p = 0. 000) and not graft size. Portal flow of the right liver increased from 81 mL/min/ 100 g (range, 35 to 210 mL/min/ 100 g) before donor right hepatectomy to 318 mL/min/ 100 g (range, 102 to 754 mL/min/ 100 g) after graft implantation. Graft portal flow had a linear correlation with the recipient portal pressure before hepatectomy of the native liver (R 2 = 0. 261) (p = 0. 000) and graft to standard liver volume ratio (R 2 = 0. 247) (p = 0. 000). The correlation was clearer with reference to a quotient derived from the recipient portal pressure divided by the graft to standard liver volume ratio (R 2 = 0. 381) (p = 0. 000). The loss of such correlation with the portal pressure after graft implantation refl ected relief of the portal hypertension by graft implantation. Despite the high portal inflow after implantation, only one of the graft biopsies after implantation showed sinusoidal congestion of moderate severity.

40|$|Rejection of {{hemopoietic}} transplants in mice {{has several}} peculiar immunogenetic features that set it {{apart from the}} rejection of solid-tissue ailografts (1, 2). The effector system responsible for rejection of marrow transplants is composed of cells that are independent of the thymus for functional differentiation and that are resistant to lethal doses of who[e-body irradiation. The antigens relevant in marrow allograft reactions are called hybrid or hemopoietic histocompatibility (Hh) ~ antigens.

Chitosan was chosen as the sorbent because of its ability to trap heavy metals, of its natural origin (from shells), and of its low cost. PP was first functionalized with acrylic acid using a cold plasma process, in order to bring some reactive carboxylic functions onto the surface. Chitosan was then covalently grafted on the acrylic acid modified polypropylene. The functionalized surfaces were characterized by FTIR (Fourier Transform InfraRed) and chitosan was thus proven to be <b>grafted.</b> The <b>ability</b> of the functionalized textile to trap heavy metals was then investigated. Copper was chosen as the model heavy metal, and artificial solutions of CuSO 4 were prepared for the experiments. Sorption studies among the concentration of copper in polluted solutions at 20 °C were carried out with PP-g-AA-chitosan (Polypropylene-grafted-Acrylic acid-chitosan) in order to evaluate the maximum of absorption of this surface: the textile can chelate copper increasingly with the initial copper concentration until 800 ppm where it reaches a plateau at about 30 mg/L. The effects of pH and of the ionic strength (absorption in a NaCl containing solution) were finally investigated. The trapping of Cu 2 + decreases slowly when the ionic strength increases. For a seawater-like NaCl concentration of 30 g/L, the textile still chelates about 20 mg/L of Cu 2 +.

HD deteriorates human physical and mental abilities over time and has no cure. Stem cell-based technologies are promising novel treatments, and in HD, they aim to replace lost neurons and/or to prevent neural cell death.

40|$|Allograft {{transplantation}} requires chronic immunosuppression, {{but there}} is no effec-tive strategy to evaluate the long-term maintenance of immunosuppression other than assessment of <b>graft</b> function. The <b>ability</b> to monitor naive alloreactive T cells would provide an alternative guide for drug therapy at early, preclinical stages of graft rejection and for evaluating toler-ance-inducing protocols. To detect and quantify naive alloreactive T cells directly ex vivo, we used the unique ability of naive T cells to rapidly produce TNF- but not IFN-. Naive alloreactive T cells were identified by the production of TNF- after a 5 -hour in vitro stimulation with alloantigen and were distinguished from effector/memory alloreactive T cells by the inability to produce IFN-. Moreover, naive alloreactive T cells were not de-tected in mice tolerized against specific alloantigens. The frequency of TNF-– producing cells was predictive for rejec-tion in an in vivo cytotoxicity assay and correlated with skin allograft rejection. Naive alloreactive T cells were also de-tected in humans, suggesting clinical rel-evance. We conclude that rapid produc-tion of TNF- can be used to quantify naive alloreactive T cells, that it is abro-gated after the induction of tolerance, and that it is a potential tool to predict allo-graft rejection.

Acellular fish skin is used for tissue repair and during manufacturing subjected to gentle processing compared to biologic materials derived from mammals. This is due to the absence of viral and prion disease transmission risk, preserving natural structure and composition of the fish skin graft. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess properties of acellular fish skin relevant for severe battlefield injuries and to compare those properties with those of dehydrated human amnion/chorion membrane. We evaluated cell ingrowth capabilities of the biological materials with microscopy techniques. Bacterial barrier properties were tested with a 2 -chamber model. The microstructure of the acellular fish skin is highly porous, whereas the microstructure of dehydrated human amnion/chorion membrane is mostly nonporous. The fish skin <b>grafts</b> show superior <b>ability</b> to support 3 -dimensional ingrowth of cells compared to dehydrated human amnion/chorion membrane (p < 0. 0001) and the fish skin is a bacterial barrier for 24 to 48 hours. The unique biomechanical properties of the acellular fish skin graft make it ideal to be used as a conformal cover for severe trauma and burn wounds in the battlefield...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThere are no {{published}} studies describing the strength quadrupled gracilis tendon alone and quadrupled semitendinosus tendon {{alone in the}} configuration used for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. The primary objective was to compare the mechanical properties of grafts used for ACL reconstruction during a tensile failure test. The secondary objective was to evaluate the effect of uniform suturing on graft strength. Fifteen pairs of knees were used. The mechanical properties of five types of ACL grafts were evaluated: patellar tendon (PT), sutured patellar tendon (sPT), both hamstring tendons (GST 4), quadrupled semitendinosus (ST 4), and quadrupled gracilis (G 4). Validated methods were used to perform the tensile tests to failure and to record the results. Student's t-test {{was used to compare}} the various samples. The maximum load to failure was 630. 8 N (±[*] 239. 1) for the ST 4, 473. 5 N (±[*] 176. 9) for the GST 4, 413. 3 N (±[*] 120. 4) for the sPT, and 416. 4 N (±[*] 187. 7) for the G 4 construct. Only the ST 4 had a significantly higher failure load than the other grafts. The sPT had a higher failure load than the PT. The ST 4 construct had the highest maximum load to failure of all the ACL graft types in the testing performed here.

40|$|In {{the present}} study we used an adoptive {{transfer}} model with athymic nude mice to characterize the T cells involved in initiating and mediating skin allograft rejection. It was found that skin allograft rejection in nude mice required the transfer of immunocompetent T cells and that such reconstitution did not itself stimulate the appearance of T cells derived from the nude host. Reconstitution with isolated populations of Lyt- 2 +/L 3 T 4 - T cells resulted in the rapid rejection of MHC class I-disparate skin allografts, whereas reconstitution with isolated populations of L 3 T 4 +/Lyt- 2 - T cells resulted in the rapid rejection of MHC class II-disparate and minor H-disparate skin allografts. By correlating these rejection responses with the functional capabilities of antigen-specific T cells contained within the reconstituting Lyt- 2 + and L 3 T 4 + T cell populations, {{it was noted that}} skin allografts were only rejected by mice that, as shown by in vitro assessment, contained both lymphokine-secreting Th cells and lymphokine-responsive Tk cells specific for the alloantigens of the <b>graft.</b> The <b>ability</b> of two such functionally distinct T cell subsets to interact in vivo to reject skin allografts was directly demonstrated in H-Y-specific rejection responses by taking advantage of the fact that H- Y-specific Th cells are L 3 T 4 + while H-Y specific Tk cells are Lyt- 2 +. Finally, the importance of in vivo interactions between functionally distinct Th/T-inducer cells and T killer (Tk) /T-effector cells in skin allograft rejection was demonstrated by the observation that normal B 6 mice retain Qala and Kbm 6 skin allografts because of a selective deficiency in antigen-specific Th cells, even though they contain T- effector cells that, when activated, are able to reject such allografts. Thus, the ability to reject skin allografts is neither unique to a specialized subset of T cells with a given Lyt phenotype, nor unique to a specialized subset of helper-independent effector T cells with so-called dual function capability. Rather, skin allograft rejection can be mediated by in vivo collaborations between T-inducer cells and T-effector cells, and the two interacting T cell subsets can express different Lyt phenotypes as well as different antigen specificities...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVEPrevious {{work has}} shown a {{correlation}} between β-cell number in cultured islet cell <b>grafts</b> and their <b>ability</b> to induce C-peptide secretion after intraportal implantation in C-peptide-negative type 1 diabetic patients. In this cross-sectional study, we examined the minimal functional β-cell mass (FBM) in the implant that induces metabolic improvement. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSGlucose clamps assessed FBM in 42 recipients with established implants. C-peptide release during each phase was expressed as percentage of healthy control values. Its relative magnitude during a second hyperglycemic phase was most discriminative and therefore selected as a parameter to be correlated with metabolic effects. RESULTSRecipients with functioning β-cell implants exhibited average FBM corresponding to 18 % of that in normal control subjects (IQR 10 - 33 %). Its relative magnitude negatively correlated with HbA 1 c levels (r = - 0. 47), daily insulin dose (r = - 0. 75), and coefficient of variation of fasting glycemia (CVfg) (r = - 0. 78, retained in multivariate analysis). A correlation between FBM and CVfg 37 % exhibited CVfg 50 % reduction of their pretransplant CVfg; this occurred in none with FBM 18 % reduced CVfg from a median pretransplant value of 46 to 37 % of normal control subjects appear needed to reduce glycemic variability in type 1 diabetic recipients. Further studies should examine whether the test can help guide decisions on additional islet cell transplants and on adjusting or stopping immunotherapy. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{healing of}} {{critical}} sized segmental defects {{is an ongoing}} clinical problem. No method has achieved pre-eminence. The Masquelet technique {{is a relatively new}} innovation involving the induction of a fibrous tissue membrane around the bone defect site taking advantage of the body's foreign body reaction to the presence of a polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) spacer. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the properties and characteristics of this induced membrane and its effectiveness when used in conjunction with allograft or an allograft/autograft mix as filler materials in an ovine critical sized defect model. The resultant induced membrane was found to be effective in containing the graft materials in situ. It was demonstrated to be an organised pseudosynovial membrane which expressed bone morphogenic protein 2 (BMP 2), transforming growth factor-beta (TGFβ), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), von Willerbrand factor (vWF), interleukin 6 (IL- 6) and interleukin 8 (IL- 8). While more new bone growth was evident in the test groups compared to the controls animals at 12 weeks, the volumes were not statistically different and no defects were fully bridged. Of the two graft material groups, the allograft/autograft mix was shown to have a more rapid graft resorption rate than the allograft only group. While the Masquelet technique proved effective in producing a membrane to enclose <b>graft</b> materials, its <b>ability</b> to assist in the healing of critical sized segmental defects when compared to empty controls remained inconclusive...|$|R
40|$|Abstractγδ T {{cells are}} {{a unique and}} minor T-cell subset that differs from {{conventional}} αβ T cells {{by virtue of their}} tissue localization and antigen processing requirements. We have previously shown that ex vivo–activated γδ[*]T[*]cells are able to prevent graft rejection without causing clinically significant graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). In the present study, we examined how γδ T cells facilitate alloengraftment and to what extent mechanisms used by conventional αβ T cells are also used by γδ T cells. We observed that, unlike αβ T cells, for which CD 8 + T cells are primarily responsible for facilitating engraftment, purified CD 8 +γδ+ T cells administered at the same fractional dose as for the unseparated activated γδ T-cell population were insufficient to prevent graft rejection. Furthermore, the <b>ability</b> to prevent <b>graft</b> rejection was not affected by the absence of fully functional fas ligand or perforin cytotoxic pathways, nor was it contingent on the ability of γδ T cells to recognize recipient major histocompatibility process alloantigens. Repetitive infusions of a suboptimal dose of γδ T cells however were able to rescue mice from graft rejection, suggesting that the persistence of these cells in vivo was critical in facilitating alloengraftment. These studies demonstrate that γδ T cells do not use mechanisms used by conventional nontolerant αβ T cells to prevent <b>graft</b> rejection. The <b>ability</b> of these cells to promote engraftment without causing GVHD further distinguishes these cells from αβ T cells and may be an attribute that can be exploited in the clinical transplantation setting...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Living, {{autologous}} vascular <b>grafts</b> {{with the}} <b>ability</b> to remodel, repair and grow may overcome {{the limitations of}} contemporary available options. In this thesis we investigate the ability for autologous, tissue engineered pulmonary artery (PA) conduits to remodel and grow in vivo. Methods and Results Vascular grafts fabricated from biodegradable scaffolds were sequentially seeded with autologous vascular derived cells and grown in vitro under biomimetic conditions. These tissue engineered vascular grafts were surgically implanted as main PA replacements in 12 lambs divided into four study groups sacrificed at 20, 50, 80 and 100 weeks post implantation. Transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) and Computed tomography (CT) angiography was performed in all animals to further assess function and in vivo growth of the tissue engineered PA. Tissue analyses of the conduits were carried out and compared to native tissue over the 2 year study period. The tissue engineered PA showed good functional performance on TOE and CT. There was {{a significant increase in}} diameter of the tissue engineered PA of up to 30 % and length increases of up to 45 %. Histological analysis of tissue engineered PA showed tissue formation comparable to native. Biochemical analysis revealed the cell number and proteoglycan content comparable to native tissue and a significant increase in collagen content over time. The biomechanical analysis showed stronger but less elastic tissue properties compared to native tissue. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) as markers for tissue remodelling showed increased active MMP- 2 and MMP- 9 activity as compared to native tissue. • Conclusion There is on-going remodelling of the tissue engineered PA with increased haemodynamic demands of the growing model.

40|$|Impaction bone {{grafting}} {{is a method}} of restoring bone stock to patients suffering significant bone loss due to revision total hip surgery. The procedure requires morselised bone (MB) to be impacted into the site of bone loss in order to stabilise the prosthesis {{with the aim of}} the long term resorption and reintegration of the impacted bone graft. Currently, the method for producing MB requires the use of expensive surgical bone mills or manually-intensive rongeurs that can produce a limited variety of particle sizes and may have a low throughput. This study examines the potential to produce suitable MB using a domestic blender. The method produces a wide range of particle sizes without the need for an adjustment of the system. It was found through packing modelling that this particle distribution resulted in reduced initial graft porosity and thus a theoretical potential to increase the <b>graft</b> stiffness and <b>ability</b> of the <b>graft</b> to stabilise a prosthesis in comparison to a manually prepared roughly cut morselised bone samples. Mechanical testing confirmed the increased mechanical performance of the graft through both impaction testing and subsidence testing. The blended MB was found to exhibit greater graft stiffness under the same impaction conditions. The graft was also found to have subsided less in comparison to the rough cut, less well graded MB. Scanning electron imaging also confirmed the retention of the trabecular structure necessary for revascularisation and host bone ingrowth. In conclusion, the blender method offers a rapid and cheap way of obtaining morselised bone with favourable particle size distribution, particle morphology and mechanical properties with preservation of the bone trabecular structure. ...|$|R
40|$|For graft-assisted {{repair of}} large {{volumetric}} bone loss resulting from traumatic orthopedic injuries, strategies that simultaneously promote osteointegration/graft healing and mitigate risks for infections are highly desired. Previously, {{we developed a}} poly(2 -hydroxyethyl methacrylate) -nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite (pHEMA-nHA) composite as a synthetic bone graft. The composite, when loaded with a single dose of 400 -ng rhBMP- 2 / 7 and press-fit into a 5 -mm rat femoral segmental defect, led to bony callus fully bridging over the defect and substantial restoration of the torsional rigidity by 12 weeks. More recently, we showed that 4. 8 wt% vancomycin can be encapsulated within the composite without compromising the structural and mechanical integrity. Additionally, FDA-approved rhBMP- 2 can be absorbed onto the graft and both the vancomycin and rhBMP- 2 can be released in a localized and sustained manner. Here we examine the efficacy of pHEMA-nHA-vancomycin grafts pre-absorbed with rhBMP- 2 in repairing 5 -mm rat femoral segmental defects, and determine if vancomycin hinders the repair. pHEMA-nHA-vancomycin or pHEMA-nHA with/without 3 -µg rhBMP- 2 were press-fit in 5 -mm femoral defects in male rats. Histology, microcomputed tomography, and torsion testing were performed on 12 -week explants to evaluate the extent and quality of repair. Partial bridging of the defect with bony callus by 12 weeks was observed with pHEMA-nHA-vancomycin without rhBMP- 2 while full bridging with substantially mineralized callus and partial restoration of torsional strength was achieved with 3 -µg rhBMP- 2. The presence of vancomycin did not significantly compromise graft healing. The pHEMA-nHA-vancomycin <b>graft,</b> with the <b>ability</b> to deliver safe doses of osteogenic recombinant proteins and to simultaneously release the encapsulated antibiotics in a sustained manner holds promise in improving the clinical outcome of graft-assisted repair of traumatic bone injuries...|$|R
