25|$|Even {{with the}} teams set, the {{logistics}} of hosting the first American football game in the Soviet Union proved challenging. Soviet officials {{were not used to}} the requirements of major American football teams: i.e., the locker rooms in the stadium were designed for 16-player soccer teams, not football teams with over 75 personnel, and Soviet stadiums did not have communications between booths and the field commonly used by coordinators. Some Soviets were even interested if anyone was ever killed during the games. In addition, Dynamo Stadium's grass field was 10 yards too short to meet football specifications. Plans were made in case any unexpected flare-up <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fading</b> Cold War prevented the game from being played in the Soviet Union; the contingency plan had the game to be moved to Los Angeles and USC's home stadium, the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, with Illinois still splitting the gate.|$|E

25|$|During the crisis, {{the men in}} La Carrera's {{and part}} of Belveder's {{divisions}} were able to form into brigade squares. Kellermann organized a second attack against the unbroken squares but the Spanish soldiers held steady and repelled the French cavalry. Since his infantry were still far in the rear, Kellermann tried to fix the enemy squares in place by launching partial charges. For {{two and a half}} hours, this tactic succeeded in pinning down the Spanish soldiers on the west bank. Marchand's infantry and artillery finally appeared on the horizon. Realizing that his men would be annihilated by a combined arms attack, La Carrera ordered an immediate retreat. The French cavalry rushed forward and inflicted further losses, but most of the Spanish troops got away over the bridge <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fading</b> light.

500|$|Early on {{the third}} day, Lindwall bowled Edrich—who was playing across the line—for 28, hitting the off stump with a ball that cut inwards to leave England’s score at 64, before Compton and Hutton {{consolidated}} the innings and took the total to 2/121 at lunch. Soon after, with his score on 39, Compton aimed a hard cut shot that flew into Lindwall's left hand at second slip for a [...] "freak slip catch" [...] from Johnston's bowling; leaving England at 3/125. Lindwall returned for another spell after lunch and bowled Evans for eight. Evans appeared to not detect Lindwall's yorker <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fading</b> light, and the umpires called off play due to poor visibility after an appeal by Yardley. The next morning, England were bowled out for 188, giving Australia an innings victory and the series 4–0. Lindwall took 3/50 to total 9/70 for the match.

40|$|The {{solution}} of space-fractional advection-dispersion equations (fADE) by random walks {{depends on the}} analogy between <b>the</b> <b>fADE</b> and <b>the</b> forward equation for the asso-ciated Markov process. The forward equation, which provides a Lagrangian description of particles moving under specific Markov processes, is derived here by the adjoint method. <b>The</b> <b>fADE,</b> however, provides an Eulerian description of solute fluxes. There are two forms of <b>the</b> <b>fADE,</b> based on fractional-flux (FF-ADE) and fractional divergence (FD-ADE). The FF-ADE is derived by taking the integer-order mass conservation of non-local diffusive flux, while the FD-ADE is derived by taking the fractional-order mass conservation of local diffusive flux. The analogy between <b>the</b> <b>fADE</b> and <b>the</b> for-ward equation depends on which form of <b>the</b> <b>fADE</b> is used and on the spatial variability of the dispersion coefficient D <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fADE.</b> If D does not vary <b>in</b> space, then <b>the</b> <b>fADEs</b> can be solved by tracking particles following a Markov process with a simple drift and an α-stable Lévy noise with index α that corresponds to the fractional order of <b>the</b> <b>fADE.</b> If D varies smoothly <b>in</b> space and <b>the</b> solute concentration at the upstream boundary remains zero, the FD-ADE can be solved by simulating a Markov proces...|$|R
25|$|Frequency (subcarrier) {{interleaving}} increases {{resistance to}} frequency-selective channel {{conditions such as}} fading. For example, when a part of <b>the</b> channel bandwidth <b>fades,</b> frequency interleaving ensures that the bit errors that would result from those subcarriers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>faded</b> part of <b>the</b> bandwidth are spread out <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bit-stream rather than being concentrated. Similarly, time interleaving ensures that bits that are originally close together <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bit-stream are transmitted far apart in time, thus mitigating against severe fading as would happen when travelling at high speed.|$|R

500|$|The coast offered Percy Shelley and Edward Williams {{the chance}} to enjoy their [...] "perfect plaything for the summer", a new sailing boat. The boat had been {{designed}} by Daniel Roberts and Edward Trelawny, an admirer of Byron's who had joined the party in January 1822. On 1 July 1822, Percy Shelley, Edward Ellerker Williams, and Captain Daniel Roberts sailed south down the coast to Livorno. There Percy Shelley discussed with Byron and Leigh Hunt the launch of a radical magazine called The Liberal. On 8 July, he and Edward Williams {{set out on the}} return journey to Lerici with their eighteen-year-old boatboy, Charles Vivian. They never reached their destination. A letter arrived at Villa Magni from Hunt to Percy Shelley, dated 8 July, saying, [...] "pray write to tell us how you got home, for they say you had bad weather after you sailed monday & we are anxious". [...] "The paper fell from me," [...] Mary told a friend later. [...] "I trembled all over."

On 20 March Formidable escorted a convoy to Malta and flew off five aircraft for Crete while returning to Alexandria. On the morning of 27 March, major elements of the Italian Fleet were spotted {{en route to the}} sea lanes between Egypt and Greece, and the carrier sailed later that afternoon to intercept them. Reinforced by three Fulmars from 806 Squadron, her air group only numbered 13 Fulmars, 10 Albacores and 4 Swordfish. An Albacore spotted the leading Italian ships the next morning; a strike force of six Albacores was loaded with torpedoes and began to attack the [...] Two German Junkers Ju 88 bombers intervened, but they were driven off by the escorting pair of Fulmars. The attack was unsuccessful, and another strike force of three Albacores and two Swordfish was prepared. Shortly after launching them at 12:22, Formidable was unsuccessfully attacked by a pair of torpedo-carrying Savoia-Marchetti SM.79 bombers. Around 14:50, one Albacore succeeded in torpedoing the Italian battleship, although the other aircraft missed. The hit briefly knocked out her engines and caused heavy flooding. Another air strike of six Albacores and two Swordfish was launched at 17:30 to finish off the crippled battleship, but they mistook the [...] for the battleship <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fading</b> light. The cruiser was struck by a single torpedo from one of the aircraft, possibly from one of two Swordfish from 815 Squadron from Maleme, Crete, that linked up with Formidables aircraft before the attack. The mistake allowed the battleship to reach port. One Albacore was shot down by Vittorio Veneto, and two others were forced to ditch after running out of fuel during the day's operations.|$|E
