2500|$|Midler {{released}} her debut album, The Divine Miss M, on Atlantic Records in December 1972. The album was co-produced by Barry Manilow, who was Bette's arranger and music conductor at the time. [...] It reached Billboard's Top 10 {{and became a}} million-selling Platinum-certified album, earning Midler the 1973 Grammy Award for Best New Artist. It featured three hit singles—"Do You Wanna Dance?", [...] "Friends", and [...] "Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy"—the third of which became Midler's first No. 1 Adult Contemporary hit. [...] "Bugle Boy" [...] became a successful rock cover of the classic swing tune originally introduced and popularized in 1941 by the famous Andrews Sisters, to whom Midler has repeatedly referred as her idols and inspiration, {{as far back as}} her first appearances on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. Midler told Carson in an interview that she always wanted to move like the sisters, and Patty Andrews remembered: [...] "When I first heard the introduction on the radio, I thought it was our old record. When Bette opened at the Amphitheater in Los Angeles, Maxene and I went backstage to see her. Her first words were, 'What <b>else</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> record? During another Midler concert, Maxene went on stage and presented her with an honorary bugle. Bette recorded other Andrews Sisters hits, including [...] "In the Mood" [...] and [...] "Lullaby of Broadway".|$|E
