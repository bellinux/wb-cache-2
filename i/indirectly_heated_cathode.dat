50|$|High-power triodes {{generally}} use a filament {{which serves}} as the <b>cathode</b> (a directly <b>heated</b> <b>cathode)</b> because the emission coating on <b>indirectly</b> <b>heated</b> <b>cathodes</b> is destroyed by the higher ion bombardment in power tubes. A thoriated tungsten filament is most often used, in which thorium in the tungsten forms a monolayer on the surface which increases electron emission. These generally run at higher temperatures than <b>indirectly</b> <b>heated</b> <b>cathodes.</b> The envelope of the tube is often made of more durable ceramic rather than glass, and all the materials have higher melting points to withstand higher heat levels produced. Tubes with plate power dissipation over several hundred watts are usually actively cooled; the plate electrode, made of heavy copper, projects through {{the wall of the}} tube and is attached to a large external finned metal heat sink which is cooled by forced air or water.|$|R
5000|$|The heyday for grid-leak {{detectors}} was the 1920s, when battery-operated, multi-dial tuned {{radio frequency}} receivers using low-mu triodes with directly <b>heated</b> <b>cathodes</b> were the norm.

50|$|The type 27 {{vacuum tube}} (valve), a triode {{introduced}} in 1927, {{was the first}} tube mass-produced for commercial use to incorporate an <b>indirectly</b> <b>heated</b> <b>cathode.</b> This made it the first vacuum tube that could function as a detector in AC-powered radios.

5000|$|Indirectly heated cathode: In this type, the {{filament}} {{is not the}} cathode {{but rather}} heats the cathode which then emits electrons. Indirectly heated cathodes are used in most devices today. For example, in most vacuum tubes the cathode is a nickel tube with the filament inside it, and {{the heat from the}} filament causes the outside surface of the tube to emit electrons. [...] The filament of an <b>indirectly</b> <b>heated</b> <b>cathode</b> is usually called the heater. The main reason for using an <b>indirectly</b> <b>heated</b> <b>cathode</b> is to isolate the rest of the vacuum tube from the electric potential across the filament. Many vacuum tubes use alternating current to heat the filament. In a tube in which the filament itself was the cathode, the alternating electric field from the filament surface would affect the movement of the electrons and introduce hum into the tube output. It also allows the filaments in all the tubes in an electronic device to be tied together and supplied from the same current source, even though the cathodes they heat may be at different potentials.|$|E
25|$|Tube heaters {{may also}} fail without warning, {{especially}} if exposed to over voltage or {{as a result}} of manufacturing defects. Tube heaters do not normally fail by evaporation like lamp filaments, since they operate at much lower temperature. The surge of inrush current when the heater is first energized causes stress in the heater, and can be avoided by slowly warming the heaters, gradually increasing current with a NTC thermistor included in the circuit. Tubes intended for series-string operation of the heaters across the supply have a specified controlled warm-up time to avoid excess voltage on some heaters as others warm up. Directly <b>heated</b> filament-type <b>cathodes</b> as used in battery-operated tubes or some rectifiers may fail if the filament sags, causing internal arcing. Excess heater-to-cathode voltage in <b>indirectly</b> <b>heated</b> <b>cathodes</b> can break down the insulation between elements and destroy the heater.|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} circuits are simplified conceptual circuits only, {{real world}} circuits also require a smoothed or regulated power supply, heater for the filaments (the details depending on if the selected valve types are directly or <b>indirectly</b> <b>heated),</b> and the <b>cathode</b> resistors are often bypassed, etc.|$|R
5000|$|An {{alternative}} {{approach to the}} problem of eliminating the tetrode kink was introduced by Hivac in 1935. It was found by J.H Owen Harries that if the separation of the anode from the screen grid were varied, a critical separation could be found (about 3 cm) where the kink in the tetrode's anode characteristic disappeared, and the amplification of the valve became particularly distortion-free. Both fidelity and efficiency exceeded those of the available pentodes of the time. A range of tetrodes of this type were introduced, aimed at the domestic receiver market, some having 2V directly heated filaments, intended for low-power battery-operated sets, others with 4V or higher, <b>indirectly</b> <b>heated</b> <b>cathodes</b> for mains operation. Output powers ranged from 0.5W to 11.5W [...] Confusingly, several of these new valves bore the same type number as existing pentodes with almost identical characteristics. Examples include Y220 (0.5W, 2V filament), AC/Y (3W, 4V heater), AC/Q (11.5W, 4V heater), etc.|$|R

40|$|Advances {{in science}} and {{technology}} during the past decade have greatly enhanced the level of the structural investigation of macromolecules – peptides and proteins. Biological mass spectrometry {{has become one of the}} most precise and sensitive techniques in peptide and protein analysis. However, increasing demands of biotechnological applications require further progress to be made. In the present thesis the development and improvement of peptide and protein characterization methods and techniques based on ion-electron and ion-photon reactions in electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry are described. The focus is on the development of the electron capture dissociation method, recently discovered by the group of professor McLafferty, into a high rate, efficient tandem mass spectrometrical technique. The rate and reliability of the electron capture dissociation technique were greatly increased by implementation of low-energy pencil electron beam injection systems based on <b>indirectly</b> <b>heated</b> dispenser <b>cathodes.</b> Further implementation of a hollow electron beam injection system combined, in a single experimental configuration, two rapid fragmentation techniques, high rate electron capture dissociation and infrared multiphoton dissociation. Simultaneous and consecutive irradiations of trapped ions with electrons and photons extended the possibilities for ion activation/dissociation reaction schemes and lead to improved peptide and protein characterization. Using these improvements, high rate electron capture dissociation was employed in time-limited experiments, such as liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry and capillary electrophoresis-tandem mass spectrometry. The analytical applications of the developed techniques have been demonstrated in top-down sequencing of peptides and proteins up to 29 kDa, improved sequencing of peptides with multiple disulfide bridges and secondary fragmentation (w-ion formation), as well as extended characterization of peptide mixtures separated by liquid chromatography and capillary electrophoresis. For instance, the dissociation of peptides resulting from enzymatic digestion of proteins provided complementary structural information on peptides and proteins, as well as their post-translational modifications...|$|R

50|$|Plate {{detector}} circuits were {{commonly used}} from the introduction of <b>indirectly</b> <b>heated</b> <b>cathode</b> tubes in the late 1920s until the start of World War II. As R.F. tubes became more sensitive, grid-leak detectors (which are more sensitive than plate detectors) became less practical. Diode detectors were popular because, unlike plate detector circuits, they could also provide A.V.C. bias. However, the dual-diode/triode and dual-diode/pentode tubes commonly used in these circuits had bulk wholesale costs that were as much as twice {{the cost of the}} tubes commonly used as plate detectors.

50|$|The {{most common}} type of <b>indirectly</b> <b>heated</b> <b>cathode</b> is the oxide-coated cathode, in which the nickel cathode surface has a coating of {{alkaline}} earth metal oxide to increase emission. The earliest material used was barium oxide; it forms a monatomic layer of barium with an extremely low work function. More modern formulations utilize a mixture of barium oxide, strontium oxide and calcium oxide. Another standard formulation is barium oxide, calcium oxide, and aluminium oxide in a 5:3:2 ratio. Thorium oxide is used as well. Oxide-coated cathodes operate at about 800-1000 °C, orange-hot. They are used in most small glass vacuum tubes, but are rarely used in high-power tubes because the coating is degraded by positive ions that bombard the cathode, accelerated by the high voltage on the tube.|$|E
50|$|A plate {{detector}} (or anode-bend detector) is {{a vacuum}} tube detector circuit used in A.M. radios, although {{the term is}} sometimes extended to transistor circuits that similarly rely upon distorted amplification to enhance {{one half of the}} received signal over the other. This circuit employs a tube with an <b>indirectly</b> <b>heated</b> <b>cathode,</b> typically a medium-mu triode, or a tetrode or pentode with a sharp cut-off control grid. Partial rectification of R.F. signals occurs in the plate of the detector tube if it is forced into its non-linear region at roughly the zero crossing point of the input signal. This differs from a grid-leak detector, which achieves rectification in the control grid. It also differs from the diode detector circuit commonly used to provide both R.F. rectification and automatic volume control (A.V.C.) bias to the R.F. amplifier tubes.|$|E

50|$|In vacuum tubes, a {{hot cathode}} or {{thermionic}} cathode is a cathode electrode which is heated {{to make it}} emit electrons due to thermionic emission. This {{is in contrast to}} a cold cathode which does not have a heating element. The heating element is usually an electrical filament, heated by a separate electric current passing through it. Hot cathodes typically achieve much higher power density than cold cathodes, emitting significantly more electrons from the same surface area. Cold cathodes rely on field electron emission or secondary electron emission from positive ion bombardment and do not require heating. There are two types of hot cathode. In a directly heated cathode, the filament is the cathode and emits the electrons. In an <b>indirectly</b> <b>heated</b> <b>cathode,</b> the filament or heater heats a separate metal cathode electrode which emits the electrons.|$|E
5000|$|Since a [...] "perfect vacuum" [...] {{contains}} no charged particles, it normally behaves {{as a perfect}} insulator. However, metal electrode surfaces can cause a region of the vacuum to become conductive by injecting free electrons or ions through either field electron emission or thermionic emission. Thermionic emission occurs when the thermal energy exceeds the metal's work function, while field electron emission occurs when the electric field at {{the surface of the}} metal is high enough to cause tunneling, which results in the ejection of free electrons from the metal into the vacuum. Externally heated electrodes are often used to generate an electron cloud as in the filament or <b>indirectly</b> <b>heated</b> <b>cathode</b> of vacuum tubes. Cold electrodes can also spontaneously produce electron clouds via thermionic emission when small incandescent regions (called cathode spots or anode spots) are formed. These are incandescent regions of the electrode surface that are created by a localized high current. These regions may be initiated by field electron emission, but are then sustained by localized thermionic emission once a vacuum arc forms. These small electron-emitting regions can form quite rapidly, even explosively, on a metal surface subjected to a high electrical field. Vacuum tubes and sprytrons are some of the electronic switching and amplifying devices based on vacuum conductivity.|$|E
