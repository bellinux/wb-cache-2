5|$|By 1209 de Gray was <b>in</b> <b>Ireland</b> {{serving as}} the king's governor, an office {{sometimes}} referred to as justiciar for Ireland. One possible reason for his appointment was to save him from being accused of ignoring the interdict on England. As a bishop, it was de Gray's ecclesiastical duty to enforce the interdict, but by going to Ireland, which was not under interdict, he could continue to serve the king without provoking the papacy. De Gray's chief policy <b>in</b> <b>Ireland</b> was to extend English rule, to which end he was involved in battles on the River Shannon and in Fermanagh. He also replaced the Irish coinage with English, and attempted unsuccessfully to make English laws applicable <b>in</b> <b>Ireland.</b> De Gray's term of office <b>in</b> <b>Ireland</b> coincided with a time of change in Irish governmental practices.|$|E

5|$|Although Richard sought {{peace with}} France, {{he took a}} {{different}} approach to the situation <b>in</b> <b>Ireland.</b> The English lordships <b>in</b> <b>Ireland</b> were in danger of being overrun, and the Anglo-Irish lords were pleading for the king to intervene. In the autumn of 1394, Richard left for Ireland, where he remained until May 1395. His army of more than 8,000 men was the largest force brought to the island during the late Middle Ages. The invasion was a success, and a number of Irish chieftains submitted to English overlordship. It {{was one of the most}} successful achievements of Richard's reign, and strengthened the king's support at home, although the consolidation of the English position <b>in</b> <b>Ireland</b> proved to be short-lived.|$|E

5|$|During the Palladian revival period <b>in</b> <b>Ireland,</b> even quite modest mansions {{were cast}} in a neo-Palladian mould. Palladian {{architecture}} <b>in</b> <b>Ireland</b> subtly differs from that in England. While adhering as in other countries to the basic ideals of Palladio, it is often truer to them – perhaps because it was often designed by architects who had come directly from mainland Europe, and therefore were not influenced by the evolution that Palladianism was undergoing in Britain. Whatever the reason, Palladianism still had to be adapted for the wetter, colder weather.|$|E
