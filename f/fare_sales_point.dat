Khartoum 60 samples from (Alsalama, street 60), Khartoum North samples from Hliat kuku and Halfaia) milk venders. Then the milk samples were preserved in a cool cracked ice and transported immediately to the Laboratory and analysis. The results revealed that boric acid was used as preservative in five samples of Khartoum <b>sale</b> <b>points</b> and two samples of Khartoum North <b>sale</b> <b>point,</b> while formaldehyde was used as a preservative in two samples of each Khartoum North and Khartoum milk <b>sale</b> <b>points.</b> Sodium carbonate and sodium bicarbonate were not found in raw milk samples collected from <b>sale</b> <b>point</b> of Khartoum and Khartoum North states.

For all samples the differences were not significant in those contents. The results revealed that addition of boric acid, formaldehyde and calcium hydroxide to milk significantly (p< 0. 01) affected the pH of preserved milk the recorded values were 6. 08, 7. 12 and 7. 05 respectively. While addition of boric acid and calcium hydroxide to milk had no significant effect on fat percentage of preserved milk the record values were 3. 97 % and 4. 2 % respectively. However addition of formaldehyde to milk significantly (p< 0. 01) affect the fat percentage of preserved milk 3. 48 %. The addition of boric acid, Formaldehyde and calcium hydroxide to milk had no significant effect on ash content. The results indicated that the presence of formaldehyde in milk samples prevents growth of bacteria, while bacterial growth was not affected by the presence of boric acid and calcium hydroxide in milk samples.
