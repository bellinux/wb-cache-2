5000|$|<b>Defuzzification</b> is {{the process}} of {{producing}} a quantifiable result in Crisp logic, given fuzzy sets and corresponding membership degrees.It {{is the process}} that maps a fuzzy set to a crisp set. It is typically needed in fuzzy control systems. These will have a number of rules that transform a number of variables into a fuzzy result, that is, the result is described in terms of membership in fuzzy sets. For example, rules designed to decide how much pressure to apply might result in [...] "Decrease Pressure (15%), Maintain Pressure (34%), Increase Pressure (72%)". <b>Defuzzification</b> is interpreting the membership degrees of the fuzzy sets into a specific decision or real value..|$|E

5000|$|The {{second step}} of Output Processing, which occurs after type-reduction, is still called <b>defuzzification.</b> Because a type-reduced set of an {{interval}} type-2 fuzzy set {{is always a}} finite interval of numbers, the defuzzified value is just {{the average of the}} two end-points of this interval.|$|E
50|$|Notice {{how each}} rule {{provides}} a result as a truth {{value of a}} particular membership function for the output variable. In centroid <b>defuzzification</b> the values are OR'd, that is, the maximum value is used and values are not added, {{and the results are}} then combined using a centroid calculation.|$|E
50|$|A neuro-fuzzy {{network is}} a fuzzy {{inference}} {{system in the}} body of an artificial neural network. Depending on the FIS type, several layers simulate the processes involved in a fuzzy inference-like fuzzification, inference, aggregation and <b>defuzzification.</b> Embedding an FIS in a general structure of an ANN has the benefit of using available ANN training methods to find the parameters of a fuzzy system.|$|E
5000|$|A {{common and}} useful <b>defuzzification</b> {{technique}} is center of gravity. First, {{the results of}} the rules must be added together in some way. The most typical fuzzy set membership function has the graph of a triangle. Now, if this triangle were to be cut in a straight horizontal line somewhere between the top and the bottom, and the top portion were to be removed, the remaining portion forms a trapezoid. The first step of <b>defuzzification</b> typically [...] "chops off" [...] parts of the graphs to form trapezoids (or other shapes if the initial shapes were not triangles). For example, if the output has [...] "Decrease Pressure (15%)", then this triangle will be cut 15% the way up from the bottom. In the most common technique, all of these trapezoids are then superimposed one upon another, forming a single geometric shape. Then, the centroid of this shape, called the fuzzy centroid, is calculated. The x coordinate of the centroid is the defuzzified value.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "POPFNN" [...] {{architecture}} is a five-layer neural network where the layers from 1 to 5 are called: input linguistic layer, condition layer, rule layer, consequent layer, output linguistic layer. The fuzzification of the inputs and the <b>defuzzification</b> of the outputs are respectively {{performed by the}} input linguistic and output linguistic layers while the fuzzy inference is collectively performed by the rule, condition and consequence layers.|$|E
5000|$|Multiple rules {{can fire}} at once, and often will, because the {{distinction}} between [...] "very low" [...] and [...] "low" [...] is fuzzy. If it is more [...] "very low" [...] than it is low, then the [...] "very low" [...] rule will generate a stronger response. The program will evaluate all the rules that fire and use an appropriate <b>defuzzification</b> method to generate its actual response.|$|E
5000|$|The {{simplest}} but least useful <b>defuzzification</b> {{method is}} to choose the set with the highest membership, in this case, [...] "Increase Pressure" [...] since it has a 72% membership, and ignore the others, and convert this 72% to some number. The problem with {{this approach is that}} it loses information. The rules that called for decreasing or maintaining pressure might as well have not been there in this case.|$|E
50|$|A {{process of}} <b>defuzzification</b> {{is said to}} occur, when fuzzy {{concepts}} can be logically {{described in terms of}} fuzzy sets, or the relationships between fuzzy sets, which makes it possible to define variations in the meaning or applicability of concepts as quantities. Effectively, qualitative differences are in that case described more precisely as quantitative variations, or quantitative variability. Assigning a numerical value then denotes the magnitude of variation along a scale from zero to one.|$|E
50|$|In a type-1 FLS, output processing, called <b>Defuzzification,</b> maps a type-1 {{fuzzy set}} into a number. There {{are many ways}} for doing this, e.g., compute the union of the fired-rule output fuzzy sets (the result is another type-1 fuzzy set) and then compute {{the center of gravity}} of the {{membership}} function for that set; compute a weighted average of the center of gravities of each of the fired rule consequent membership functions; etc.|$|E
5000|$|Things are {{somewhat}} more complicated for an interval type-2 FLS, because {{to go from}} an interval type-2 fuzzy set to a number (usually) requires two steps (Fig. 3). The first step, called type-reduction, is where an interval type-2 fuzzy set is reduced to an interval-valued type-1 fuzzy set. There are as many type-reduction methods as there are type-1 <b>defuzzification</b> methods. An algorithm developed by Karnik and Mendel (7, 12) {{now known as the}} KM Algorithm is used for type-reduction. Although this algorithm is iterative, it is very fast.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Evolutionary Adaptive <b>Defuzzification</b> Methods are {{a kind of}} <b>defuzzification</b> methods {{based on}} using a parametrical <b>defuzzification</b> {{expression}} tuned with evolutionary algorithms. Their goal is to increase the accuracy of the fuzzy system without loosing its interpretability. They induce a kind of rule cooperation in the <b>defuzzification</b> interface. 1 This paper deals with Evolutionary Adaptive <b>Defuzzification</b> Methods. We study their common general expression, the different <b>defuzzification</b> methods that can be obtained from it, their interpretation, and their accuracy. We consider two applications in order to analyse their accuracy in practice. We get some useful results for practical fuzzy systems designed by means of this kind of Intelligent Hybrid System...|$|E
40|$|A novel {{technique}} of designing application specific <b>defuzzification</b> strategies with neural learning is presented. The proposed neural architecture {{considered as a}} universal <b>defuzzification</b> approximator is validated by showing the convergence when approximating several existing <b>defuzzification</b> strategies. The method is successfully tested with fuzzy controlled reverse driving of a model truck. The transparent structure of the universal <b>defuzzification</b> approximator allows to analyse the generated customised <b>defuzzification</b> method using the existing theories of <b>defuzzification.</b> The integration of universal <b>defuzzification</b> approximator instead of traditional methods in Mamdani type fuzzy controllers {{can also be considered}} as an addition of trainable non linear noise to the output of the fuzzy rule inference before calculating the defuzzified crisp output. Therefore, non linear noise trained specifically for a given application shows a grade of confidence on the rule base, providing an additional opportunity to measure the quality of the fuzzy rule base. The possibility of modelling Mamdani type fuzzy controllers as a feed forward neural network with the ability of gradient descent training of the universal <b>defuzzification</b> approximator and antecedent membership functions fulfill the requirement known from Multi-layer Preceptrons in finding solutions to non linear separable problems...|$|E

30|$|The {{proposed}} framework imposes no constraints regarding <b>defuzzification.</b> Selection of <b>defuzzification</b> technique {{should take}} place as per established FIS conventions as described in “Fuzzy inference systems” section.|$|E
30|$|In the <b>defuzzification</b> step, {{the final}} crisp value should be {{calculated}} {{so that the}} final action can take place. There are various <b>defuzzification</b> methods; {{each has its own}} strengths and weaknesses. In dynamic modeling, a modeler is primarily concerned with the dynamic behavior of the model and the constituting variables. Therefore, a <b>defuzzification</b> method is suitable to retain this property. With this in mind, we chose to employ two <b>defuzzification</b> methods, Largest of Maximum (LOM) and Center of Area (COA). The LOM method is easy to implement, whereas the COA has smoother output.|$|E
30|$|<b>Defuzzification</b> is {{a process}} that takes the fuzzy output and {{translates}} it back to a single crisp value. Depending on the context or specific problem of interest, <b>defuzzification</b> may or may not take place. A number of different <b>defuzzification</b> techniques exist [45]. In this example, the centroid technique will be used. The centroid technique computes the center of gravity of the output distribution function and outputs the x-coordinate.|$|E

30|$|The {{last step}} of the {{proposed}} FLS is the <b>defuzzification</b> step. <b>Defuzzification</b> {{is a process of}} transforming fuzzy output inferred from the fuzzy inference system (FIS) to a crisp value. We use a centroid defuzzifier in the <b>defuzzification</b> step. The centroid defuzzifier returns the center of the inferred fuzzy outputs. The centroid calculation is the most popular <b>defuzzification</b> method which returns the center of the area under the curve. FCC [25] also calculates center of gravity of the output membership function in the <b>defuzzification</b> phase of their fuzzy-based congestion control algorithm. However, calculating the center of the gravity of a trapezoid is a complex process and not appropriate for the sensor devices due to their limited processing capability and battery. In order to decrease the complexity of the defuzification step, we determine the membership function of each consequence fuzzy class as an isosceles triangle whose abscissa value of its apex is equal to the θ value of the corresponding consequence class. In Figure  4, membership functions of the consequence classes are depicted.|$|E
40|$|AbstractDefuzzification {{is a very}} {{important}} step in fuzzy systems applications. There are a number of different <b>defuzzification</b> methods reported in the literature. In this paper, the concept of <b>defuzzification</b> filters in a control system setting is first discussed and a methodology for designing such filters considered. As will be seen, the design of such filters requires the knowledge of the plant model and its inverse. A reference control signal is computed and then is used to generate the actual defuzzified control signal which will be applied to control the plant. The application of the <b>defuzzification</b> filter is made by introducing the filter into a power system in which a neuro-fuzzy self-learning controller was applied to stabilize the system but success could not always be guaranteed. With the <b>defuzzification</b> filter, however, the system is always stabilized. Simulation results are presented...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the fuzzification and <b>defuzzification</b> {{process in the}} framework of hybrid systems comprising Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs) and Genetic Algorithms (GAs). More specifically, it provides a stepwise methodology for fuzzification and <b>defuzzification</b> aiming at both an improved approach of the human reasoning pattern and an increase of the decision-making potentials. The fuzzification process is primarily based on producing fuzzy information provided by a group of experts. Each concept is analyzed into trapezoidal membership functions of either fixed or variable widths, with these intervals labeled and stored for the <b>defuzzification</b> process later on, during which the levels are matched according to the membership functions of each concept. The <b>defuzzification</b> process is more complicated than the fuzzification one and consists of four basic iterative stages: The Iteration, the Max-Min Average Computation, the Categorization and, finally, the Realization Inference Stage. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the application of}} artificial intelligence techniques especially fuzzy logic (FL) in predicting machining performance. FL is chosen because it is widely used to predict the machining performances such as surface roughness, cutting force and material removal rate. Previous works on FL focusing on fuzzy components has been presented. The FL components are fuzzification, fuzzy rule, inference engine and <b>defuzzification.</b> The review shows that the FL components for fuzzification, which is logical operator, membership function (MF) and IF-THEN rule, is the necessary facts that must be considered before applying FL in prediction. Fuzzy rule that is derived from fuzzification process {{is important in the}} development of inference engine. Therefore, the <b>defuzzification</b> of the inference engine will give desired fuzzy system. The review also revealed that there are several types of <b>defuzzification</b> which include centroid, bisector, smallest of maximum, mean of maximum and largest of maximum. There are important facts that must be considered in FL development. To conclude, this paper revealed that MF and <b>defuzzification</b> is important in predicting machining performance. It shows that for MF and <b>defuzzification,</b> triangular and centroid are respectively mostly used in the prediction process...|$|E
