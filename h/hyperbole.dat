The book reviewer for The Globe and Mail admitted he grew impatient with the grand and repetitive statements about the changing global food system and the authors' <b>hyperbole</b> regarding their modest culinary discoveries. Compared to Kingsolver's Animal, Vegetable, Miracle, The 100-Mile Diet {{was found to be}} more compelling and easier to read, with Smith and MacKinnon more relatable and sympathetic than Kingsolver.|$|E
5|$|Argentina {{was highly}} {{alarmed by the}} Brazilian move, and they quickly moved to nullify the {{remaining}} months of the naval-limiting restrictions in the 1902 pact with Chile. In November 1906, Argentina's Minister of Foreign Affairs, , remarked that {{any one of the}} new Brazilian vessels could destroy the entire Argentine and Chilean fleets. Despite the seeming <b>hyperbole,</b> his statement—made before the Brazilian government reordered the ships as dreadnoughts—ended up being close to the truth: in 1910, at least, the new Brazilian warships were seemingly stronger than any other vessel in the world, let alone any one ship in the Argentine or Chilean fleets. With this in mind, the Journal of the American Society of Naval Engineers opined that maintaining the older Libertad class or Capitán Prat (respectively) was now a waste of money.|$|E

Like any conspiracy theory, it contains several grains of truth; and like any such theory, it is both irrational and insidious.|$|E
5|$|The New Kingdom pharaohs began a {{large-scale}} building {{campaign to promote}} the god Amun, whose growing cult was based in Karnak. They also constructed monuments to glorify their own achievements, both real and imagined. The Karnak temple is the largest Egyptian temple ever built. The pharaoh Hatshepsut used such <b>hyperbole</b> and grandeur during her reign of almost twenty-two years. Her reign was very successful, marked by {{an extended period of}} peace and wealth-building, trading expeditions to Punt, restoration of foreign trade networks, and great building projects, including an elegant mortuary temple that rivaled the Greek architecture of a thousand years later, a colossal pair of obelisks, and a chapel at Karnak. Despite her achievements, Amenhotep II, the heir to Hatshepsut's nephew-stepson Tuthmosis III, sought to erase her legacy {{near the end of his}} father's reign and throughout his, touting many of her accomplishments as his. He also tried to change many established traditions that had developed over the centuries, which some suggest was a futile attempt to prevent other women from becoming pharaoh and to curb their influence in the kingdom.|$|E
5|$|While riders queue {{they are}} shown three {{briefing}} videos featuring actor Renny Krupinski as a sinister man surrounded in darkness, who explains at length {{the physical and}} psychological effects of riding on Oblivion. Although based on scientific facts, his speeches are deliberately exaggerated with <b>hyperbole</b> and dark humour to give riders a sense of intimidation while preparing for Oblivion. The man remains unnamed throughout the videos, although the character was originally {{referred to as the}} Lord of Darkness during production. The final preshow video features a second character whose image appears inverted and therefore glowing white, who argues with the Lord of Darkness as to whether Oblivion is really safe for riders to experience; to which he is repeatedly ignored. The Lord of Darkness maintains that the ride is safe, before the video ends with the sound of his ominous laughter.|$|E

5|$|After {{receiving}} the nomination, Kemp became the ticket's spokesman for minorities and the inner-city. Due to {{agreement on the}} self-help policy that Louis Farrakhan has endorsed in many fora including the Million Man March, Kemp in a sense aligned himself with Farrakhan. However, Farrakhan was perceived as being anti-Semitic, and Kemp was considered an ally of Republican Jews. This issue necessitated some political sidestepping. As the nominee, Kemp at times overshadowed Dole. In fact, more than once, Kemp was described {{as if he was}} the Presidential nominee. In addition to having overshadowed Dole, despite the negative ad campaigns that the ticket used, Kemp was a very positive running mate who relied on a pep rally type of campaign tour full of football-related metaphors and <b>hyperbole.</b> Although some enjoyed Kemp's style, referring to him as the Good Shepherd, his detractors, such as U.S. News & World Report writer Steven V. Roberts, criticized the extensive use of recounting stories of passing balls relative to the use of recounting stories of passing bills. During the campaign, Kemp expressed the opinion that Republican Party leaders did not stand behind the ticket wholeheartedly. Despite Kemp's voice on minority issues, Colin Powell's support and polls that showed about 30% of blacks identified themselves as conservatives on issues such as school prayer, school vouchers and criminal justice, the Republicans were unable to improve upon historical support levels from African-American voters.|$|E

25|$|Fascism {{has been}} criticized for being ideologically dishonest. Major {{examples}} of ideological dishonesty have been identified in Italian fascism's changing relationship with German Nazism. Fascist Italy's official foreign policy positions were known to commonly utilize rhetorical ideological <b>hyperbole</b> to justify its actions, although during Dino Grandi's tenure as Italy's foreign minister the country engaged in realpolitik free of such fascist <b>hyperbole.</b> Italian fascism's stance towards German Nazism fluctuated from support from the late 1920s to 1934, when it celebrated Hitler's rise to power and meeting with Hitler in 1934; to opposition from 1934 to 1936 after the assassination of Italy's allied leader in Austria, Engelbert Dollfuss, by Austrian Nazis; and again back to support after 1936, when Germany was the only significant power that did not denounce Italy's invasion and occupation of Ethiopia.|$|E

40|$|Video image {{detection}} systems (VIDS) {{provide an}} opportunity to analyse complex traffic scenes that are captured by stationary video cameras. Our work concentrates on the derivation of traffic relevant parameters from vehicle trajectories. This paper examines different procedures for the description of vehicle trajectories using analytical functions. Derived conical sections (circles, ellipses and <b>hyperboles)</b> as well as straight lines are particularly suitable for this task. Thus, it is possible to describe a suitable trajectory by a maximum of five parameters. A classification algorithm uses these parameters and takes decisions on the turning behaviour of vehicles. A model based approach is following. The a-priori knowledge about the scene (here prejudged and verified vehicle trajectories) is the only required input into this system. One confines himself here to straight lines, circles, ellipses and <b>hyperboles.</b> Other common functions (such as clothoids) are discussed and the choice of the function is being justified. 1. 1 Motivation 1...|$|R

25|$|<b>Hyperbole</b> {{is common}} to {{virtually}} all royal inscriptions of Egyptian history. While all ancient leaders used it to laud their achievements, Hatshepsut {{has been called the}} most accomplished pharaoh at promoting her accomplishments. This may have resulted from the extensive building executed during her time as pharaoh, in comparison with many others. It afforded her many opportunities to laud herself, but it also reflected the wealth that her policies and administration brought to Egypt, enabling her to finance such projects. Aggrandizement of their achievements was traditional when pharaohs built temples and their tombs.|$|E
25|$|Buffett {{viewed the}} United States' {{expanding}} trade deficit as {{a trend that}} will devalue the US dollar and US assets.

In his letter to shareholders in March 2005, he predicted that in another ten years' time the net ownership of the U.S. by outsiders would amount to $11 trillion. Americans... would chafe at the idea of perpetually paying tribute to their creditors and owners abroad.

25|$|Alexios and Malik Shah met, Alexios {{throwing}} his own costly cloak around the sultan's shoulders. A peace involving an undertaking by Malik Shah to stop Turkish raiding and an admission by {{the sultan of}} some measure of, largely theoretical, dependence on the Byzantine emperor was made. Anna Komnene records that the peace treaty involved an undertaking by Malik Shah to evacuate Anatolia, but this is unlikely in the extreme and must represent <b>hyperbole</b> on her part. The campaign was remarkable for {{the high level of}} discipline shown by the Byzantine army. Alexios had demonstrated that he could march his army with impunity through Turkish dominated territory. The reverse suffered by Malik Shah at Philomelion and the consequent loss of prestige probably contributed to his demise as he was soon deposed, blinded and eventually murdered by his brother Mas'ud.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{combines}} {{quantitative and qualitative}} methods to investigate translation strategies applied in a translation of a few chapters in Cat Counsellor, which is a book about cat behaviour. A cognitive approach and translation strategies {{are the focus of}} this essay, which arrives at the conclusion that figurative language in general, and conceptual metaphors and <b>hyperboles</b> in particular, are used to manipulate, or rather convince readers of Cat Counsellor of a certain outlook. The translation strategies investigated in this essay are literal translation, transference translation and meaning translation. Of these translation strategies literal translation was applied 70 % of the time, which indicates that similar cultures use similar figurative language. It also indicates that the target text and language often benefit from new figurative language rendered in the source language and source text. An important conclusion is that metaphorical language, such as conceptual metaphors and <b>hyperboles</b> may seem easy to translate, while in fact concepts can vary across cultures, which indicate that the translator carefully has to consider his or her translation choices in order to produce an accurate translation. ...|$|R
