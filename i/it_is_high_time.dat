5|$|The total {{incompetence}} of the D.C. {{government in}} Washington, DC, {{has become an}} embarrassment to our entire Nation. This experiment in home rule is a disaster. All of us who serve in this Chamber, well over 95% of us, have held other positions in government. We have been mayors. We have been township trustees, State legislators, and the rest. I am convinced, Mr. Speaker, that there are well over 2,000 township trustees in my congressional district who with one arm tied behind their backs, could blindfolded {{do a better job}} of directing this city than the city council of D.C. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>high</b> <b>time</b> that this experiment in home rule that has proven to be a disaster for our nation be terminated, that we return to some sort of logical government whereby the rest of us can function in this city.|$|E

When he does bring up the subject, however, Noriko laughs: Hattori has been engaged to another young woman for quite some time.|$|E
2500|$|In February 2006, Shetty lent {{support to}} a BBC World Service Trust {{television}} show designed {{to tackle the}} problem of HIV-AIDS in India. According to reports, she participated {{in order to show}} solidarity with HIV-AIDS sufferers. According to Shetty, the issue was particularly close to her heart as she had portrayed an HIV-positive sufferer in her 2004 film Phir Milenge. Speaking about the film and HIV in general, Shetty said: [...] "Why not a film on HIV positive patients? It is a social stigma in our society. We made this film to highlight this problem... This film will bring about a social awareness about AIDS in our country. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>high</b> <b>time</b> we talked about this in our society".|$|E
6000|$|Still, Alan Merrick was now [...] "getting {{on in his}} profession," [...] and, {{as people}} said, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>high</b> <b>time</b> he should <b>be</b> settled. They said it as they might have said <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>high</b> <b>time</b> he should take a {{business}} partner. From that lowest depth of emotional disgrace Herminia Barton was to preserve him. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> her task in life, though she knew it not, to save Alan Merrick's soul. And nobly she saved it.|$|R

2500|$|There {{was further}} {{violence}} in May 2001. On 5 May, 300 Orangemen and supporters tried to march on to Garvaghy Road but were stopped by police. There were some scuffles between Orangemen and police officers. District Master Harold Gracey drew controversy {{when he said}} to the police officers: [...] "We all know where you come from...you come from the Protestant community, the vast majority of you come from the Protestant community and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>high</b> <b>time</b> that you supported your own Protestant people". On 12 May there were clashes between loyalists and nationalists on Woodhouse Street. On 27 May there were clashes between nationalists and police after a junior Orange march on the lower Garvaghy Road.|$|E
2500|$|Baron Axel Carpelan, {{who gave}} Sibelius' {{well-known}} tone poem Finlandia its name, {{wrote to the}} composer shortly after its successful premiere: [...] "You have been sitting at home for quite a while, Mr. Sibelius, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>high</b> <b>time</b> for you to travel. You will spend the late autumn and the winter in Italy, a country where one learns cantabile, balance and harmony, plasticity and symmetry of lines, a country where everything is beautiful – even the ugly. You remember what Italy meant for Tchaikovsky’s development and for Richard Strauss." [...] Although Baron Carpelan was penniless, he raised sufficient funds for Sibelius {{to stay in a}} mountain villa near Rapallo, Italy. Here, Sibelius jotted down the first notes to his second symphony.|$|E
2500|$|Duterte's {{constant}} cursing had {{local officials}} {{worried that the}} Philippines would lose foreign aid from the United States and European Union. [...] He responded that “If you think <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>high</b> <b>time</b> for you guys to withdraw your assistance, go ahead. [...] We will not beg for it. We have a problem here trying to preserve our society" [...] he said. [...] The President continued that he would “be {{the first to go}} hungry. I will {{be the first one to}} die of hunger". [...] Local actress Agot Isidro responded in Tagalog [...] "First of all, no one's trying to fight you. As a matter of fact, you're the one who's picking a fight. Secondly, the country where you are elected as President by 16 million out of 100+ million is Third World. You talk as if the Philippines is a superpower. Excuse me, we don't want to go hungry. If you want, you do it yourself. Leave us out of it. So many people have nothing to eat, and yet you'll starve us even further". Her sentiments were echoed by Senator Panfilo Lacson adding that [...] "if the economy worsen, the entire Filipino people will be affected, they will go hungry as well".|$|E
60|$|He {{waved his}} horrid hand at me--he struck his {{infectious}} breast--he addressed me oratorically, as if I was laid {{up in the}} House of Commons. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>high</b> <b>time</b> to take a desperate course of some sort. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> also <b>high</b> <b>time</b> to send for Louis, and adopt the precaution of fumigating the room.|$|R
60|$|But she {{interrupted}} him. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>high</b> <b>time,</b> she thought. Her face {{he saw was}} flushed, {{her eyes}} had hardened somewhat. Calmly she disengaged her hand.|$|R

60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>high</b> <b>time</b> to stir now, and the King did <b>it.</b> That <b>is</b> how Charles VII. {{came to be}} {{smitten with}} anxiety to have justice done {{the memory of his}} benefactress.|$|R
