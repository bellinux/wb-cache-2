25|$|The {{idea was}} {{expanded}} in Charles Fox's 1836 publication On the Construction of Skew Arches, {{in which he}} considered the <b>intrados</b> of the barrel and the extrados as separate surfaces mapped onto concentric cylinders by drawing a separate development for each. This approach had two advantages. Firstly, {{he was able to}} develop a theoretical third, intermediate surface midway between the <b>intrados</b> and the extrados, which allowed him to align the centre of each voussoir, rather than its inner surface, along the desired line, thereby better approximating the ideal placement than Nicholson was able to achieve.|$|E
25|$|In {{performing}} his calculations Nicholson {{considered the}} arch barrel {{to be made}} from one ring of stones and of negligible thickness and therefore he developed only the <b>intrados.</b>|$|E
25|$|Unlike the {{helicoidal}} and logarithmic methods, {{in which}} the <b>intrados</b> of the arch barrel is cylindrical, the corne de vache method results in a warped hyperbolic paraboloid surface that dips in the middle, rather like a saddle.|$|E

25|$|Nicholson {{approached}} {{the problem by}} constructing a development of the <b>intrados</b> of the arch from the plan and elevation drawings, effectively unrolling and flattening the surface, then drawing the courses perpendicular to the faces, adding the header joints perpendicular to the courses, then finally rolling up the development diagram by projecting the detail of the <b>intrados</b> back onto the plan and elevation drawings, a technique also used by others who would later offer alternative solutions to the problem. This method resulted in the courses of stone voussoirs making up {{the barrel of the}} skew arch following parallel helical paths between the abutments, giving the view along the barrel an attractive rifled appearance. Although these courses meet the arch faces at right angles at the crown of the arch, the nearer they are to the springing line the greater their deviation from perpendicularity. Thus Nicholson's method is not the perfect solution, but it is a workable one that has one great advantage over more purist alternatives, namely that since the helical courses run parallel to each other, all the voussoir stones can be cut to the same pattern, the only exceptions being the ring stones, or quoins, where the barrel meets the faces of the arch, each of which is unique but has an identical copy in the other face.|$|E
2500|$|... “The window {{openings}} were <b>intrados</b> frames {{composed of}} L beams; the internal membering with {{horizontal and vertical}} muntins was differentiated in that all the verticals appeared more slender on the outside, while the horizontals appeared wider. These fames were, however, only floor-to-floor height, screwed to the building on four sides; one string course that reached across the three floors consisted, in fact, of three different sections. Along {{the side of the}} building, 3-millimetre-thick steel plates sealed the wedge between window frame and piers.” ...|$|E
2500|$|The common method {{they all}} used was to clad the timber {{centring}} (also known as falsework) with planks, known as [...] "laggings", laid {{parallel with the}} abutments and carefully planed and levelled to approximate closely the required curve of the <b>intrados</b> of the arch. The positions of the courses {{in the vicinity of}} the crown were first marked out at right angles to the faces using long wooden straight-edges, then the remaining courses were marked out in parallel. The masons then laid the stones, cutting them to shape as required.|$|E

2500|$|In {{terms of}} {{strength}} and stability, a skew bridge built to the logarithmic pattern has advantages over one built to the helicoidal pattern, especially so {{in the case of}} full-centred designs. However, the courses are not parallel, being thinner towards the most acutely angled quoin (located where the face of the arch makes an obtuse angle with the abutment in the plan view, at S and Q in the development to the left, and at the left hand side of the photograph of the <b>intrados</b> on the right) and thicker towards the most obtusely angled quoin (at O and G in the development and just off the right hand side of the photograph), ...|$|E

50|$|Within {{the blind}} arcade of the drum, eight {{standing}} figures alternate with eight windows. During the restoration work in 1032 {{the heads of}} these figures identified as prophets by some scholars, were replaced by round openings. Above each prophet, in a circular niche, an angel holding a scepter is depicted. On the arches of the windows there are the busts of other holy figures.The rest of the frescoes found on the north, south and west walls are severely damaged and {{are in need of}} restoration. However, a female figure dressed in blue, carrying a diadem and holding a church model in her hand can still be observed on the <b>intrado</b> of the northwestern window. This figure has been interpreted by scholars either as the Cappadocian Saint Nino, who converted the Georgians to Christianity, or the first Christian queen of Georgia, or a symbol of the church itself.|$|R

50|$|Location is an {{important}} concept {{in the manner of}} how the Enhanced 9-1-1 system works. Location determination depends upon the Automatic Location Information (ALI) database which is maintained on behalf of local governments by contracted private third parties generally the Incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (ILEC). Often, the contracted 3rd party further subcontracts the actual ALI database management to companies such as <b>Intrado,</b> Bandwidth and TeleCommunication Systems, Inc. The ALI database also feeds the Master Street Address Guide database which is used to route the call to the appropriate PSAP and when the call arrives, the ALI database is queried to determine the location of the caller.The 9-1-1 call arrives at the appropriate PSAP after it is routed across the Public switched telephone network (PSTN) to a special, often dedicated facility, called a Class 4 telephone switch or Tandem Office. The Tandem Office uses a technology referred to as Selective Routing to query the SRDB (Selective Routing Database) and MSAG (Master Street Address Guide) using the originating telephone number as a search key to match the origination of the call to the network location or Emergency Service Number (ESN) of the appropriate PSAP. When the call is delivered to the PSAP, a second query is made to the Automatic Location Information (ALI), again using the originating telephone number as a search key. The ALI record associated with the query is then returned to the PSAP where the Customer-premises equipment (CPE) correlates that information with the call taker receiving the call and displays the information on their computer screen.|$|R
40|$|Conjugate heat {{transfer}} {{is a key}} issue in combustion: the interaction of reacting flows and hot gases with colder walls is actually a main design constraint in gas turbines. For example, multiperforated plates commonly used in combustion chambers to cool walls {{must be able to}} sustain the high fluxes produced in the chamber. After combustion, the interaction of the hot burnt gases with the high pressure stator and the first turbine blades conditions the temperature and pressure levels reached in the combustor, and therefore the engine efficiency. Conjugate {{heat transfer}} is a difficult field and most existing tools are developped for chained (rather than coupled), steady (rather than transient) phenomena: the fluid flow is computed using a RANS (Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes) solver. During this work, a fully parallel environnement for conjugate heat transfer has been developed and applied to two configurations of interest for the design of combustion devices. The numerical tool is based on a reactive LES (Large Eddy Simulations) code and a solid conduction solver that can exchange data via a supervisor. An unsteady wall/flame interaction is used to assess the the precision and the order of the cou-pled solutions depending on the coupling frequency. It is shown that the temperature and the flux across the wall are well reproduced when the codes are coupled with a time scale of the order of the smallest time scale. An experimental film-cooled turbine vane is studied in order to reach a steady state. The solutions from the conjugate analyses and an adiabatic wall convec-tion are compared to experimental results. Concerning pressure profiles, both simulations show a good agreement with experimental results. Due to thermal conduction in the blade, conju-gate results has a lower mean <b>intrado</b> temperature than adiabatic simulation and reproduce the experimental cooling efficiency quite well...|$|R
40|$|The article {{presents}} {{the result of}} research focused on the Importance of the Controllership for the company performance - Software Company Experience. The main objective of the research was {{to focus on the}} common financial problem areas in information technology industry, especially in software companies and with the cooperation of the controllers find out the forms of financial analysis and the solutions for the company performance. The information technology cluster is divided into two sub-sectors: software and hardware. The software sector, which is covered in this report, includes companies involved in a broad range of activities, ranging from those that develop off-the-shelf software products to those that provide custom computer programming, computer systems design or data processing services. Major software companies are: Ciber Inc., Cisco Systems, eBags. com, EMC Corporation, Encoda Inc., Evolving Systems Inc., IBM, <b>Intrado</b> Inc., Oracle Corporation, Sun Microsystems Inc., ViaWest, Webroot Software Inc. etc. The research was made as personal interviews with the company controller(s). Out of all contacted controllers in state Colorado, 75 % were willing to have a personal meeting to help us with our analysis. We arranged the most common financial areas in examined companies in ten groups and explained them in more detail. The most common financial problem areas, which we set up with the coope- ration of the controllers in examined companies, are: the investments in accounts receivable is increasing, the investments in inventory is increasing, he investments in fixed assets in increasing, the funding supplied by accounts payable is shrinking, the return on equity is worsening, sales are declining, the company is no longer making money at historical sales levels, material costs are increasing, freight costs are increasing, direct labor costs are increasing. Also we pointed to the importance different financial analyzes which could be used in the companies when the financial symptoms appear...|$|R
