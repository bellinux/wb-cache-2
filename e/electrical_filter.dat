500|$|Mechanical {{filter design}} was {{developed}} by applying the discoveries made in <b>electrical</b> <b>filter</b> theory to mechanics. However, a very early example (1870s) of acoustic filtering was the [...] "harmonic telegraph", which arose precisely because electrical resonance was poorly understood but mechanical resonance (in particular, acoustic resonance) was very familiar to engineers. This situation was not to last for long; electrical resonance had been known to science for some time before this, {{and it was not}} long before engineers started to produce all-electric designs for filters. In its time, though, the harmonic telegraph was of some importance. The idea was to combine several telegraph signals on one telegraph line by what would now be called frequency division multiplexing thus saving enormously on line installation costs. The key of each operator activated a vibrating electromechanical reed which converted this vibration into an electrical signal. Filtering at the receiving operator was achieved by a similar reed tuned to precisely the same frequency, which would only vibrate and produce a sound from transmissions by the operator with the identical tuning.|$|E

50|$|Most audio {{crossovers}} use {{first to}} fourth order <b>electrical</b> <b>filters.</b> Higher orders are not generally implemented in passive crossovers for loudspeakers, but are sometimes found in electronic equipment under circumstances for which their considerable cost and complexity can be justified.|$|R
50|$|Just as filters have {{different}} orders, so do crossovers, {{depending on the}} filter slope they implement. The final acoustic slope may be completely determined by the <b>electrical</b> <b>filter</b> or may be achieved by combining the electrical filter's slope with the natural characteristics of the driver. In the former case, the only requirement is that each driver has a flat response {{at least to the}} point where its signal is approximately −10dB down from the passband. In the latter case, the final acoustic slope is usually steeper than that of the electrical filters used. A third- or fourth-order acoustic crossover often has just a second order <b>electrical</b> <b>filter.</b> This requires that speaker drivers be well behaved a considerable way from the nominal crossover frequency, and further that the high frequency driver be able to survive a considerable input in a frequency range below its crossover point. This is difficult in actual practice. In the discussion below, the characteristics of the <b>electrical</b> <b>filter</b> order is discussed, followed by a discussion of crossovers having that acoustic slope and their advantages or disadvantages.|$|E
50|$|Though many {{argue that}} there is an {{inconsistency}} on how the EPO now applies Article 52, the practice of the EPO is fairly consistent regarding the treatment of the different elements of Article 52(2).

5000|$|Butterworth had a {{reputation}} for solving [...] "impossible" [...] mathematical problems. At the time, filter design required a considerable amount of designer experience due to limitations of the theory then in use. The filter was not in common use for over 30 years after its publication. Butterworth stated that: [...] "An ideal <b>electrical</b> <b>filter</b> should not only completely reject the unwanted frequencies but should also have uniform sensitivity for the wanted frequencies".|$|E

50|$|Once the {{transmission}} line equivalent circuit has been determined, multi-layer FSS design becomes much simpler and more intuitive - like ordinary filter analysis and design. Now while it is certainly possible to design multi-layer FSS structures using first principles codes and generalized scattering matrices (GSM), it is far easier, quicker and more intuitive to use equivalent circuit models for FSS design, since {{it is possible to}} leverage decades' worth of research performed on <b>electrical</b> <b>filter</b> analysis and design and bring it to bear on FSS structures. And, FSS filters are even easier to design than waveguide filters since the incidence angle does not vary with frequency.|$|E
50|$|Vented {{system design}} using {{computer}} modeling has been practiced since about 1985, when researchers Thiele and Small first systematically applied <b>electrical</b> <b>filter</b> theory to the acoustic behavior of loudspeakers in enclosures. While ported loudspeakers had been produced {{for many years}} before computer modeling, achieving optimum performance was challenging, {{as it is a}} complex sum of the properties of the specific driver, the enclosure and port, because of imperfect understanding of the assorted interactions. These enclosures are sensitive to small variations in driver characteristics and require special quality control concern for uniform performance across a production run. Bass ports are widely used in subwoofers for PA systems and sound reinforcement systems, in bass amp speaker cabinets and in keyboard amp speaker cabinets.|$|E

5000|$|Progress on {{loudspeaker}} enclosure design and analysis using acoustic analogous circuits by academic acousticians like Harry F. Olson continued until 1954 when Leo L. Beranek of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology published Acoustics, a book summarizing and extending the electroacoustics of the era. J. F. Novak used novel simplifying assumptions {{in an analysis}} in a 1959 paper {{which led to a}} practical solution for the response of a given loudspeaker in a box, and also established their applicability by empirical measurement. In 1961, leaning heavily on Novak's work, A. N. Thiele described a series of sealed and vented box [...] "alignments" [...] (i.e., enclosure designs based on <b>electrical</b> <b>filter</b> theory with well-characterized behavior, including frequency response, power handling, cone excursion, etc.) in a publication in an Australian journal. This paper remained relatively unknown outside Australia until it was re-published in the Journal of the Audio Engineering Society in 1971. It {{is important to note that}} Thiele's work neglected enclosure losses and, though a breakthrough at the time, his alignment tables now have little real-world utility.|$|E
50|$|To {{solve this}} problem, {{synthetic}} array heterodyne detection (SAHD) was developed. In SAHD, large imaging arrays can be multiplexed into virtual pixels {{on a single}} element detector with single readout lead, single <b>electrical</b> <b>filter,</b> and single recording system. The time domain conjugate {{of this approach is}} Fourier transform heterodyne detection, which also has the multiplex advantage and also allows a single element detector to act like an imaging array. SAHD has been implemented as Rainbow heterodyne detection in which instead of a single frequency LO, many narrowly spaced frequencies are spread out across the detector element surface like a rainbow. The physical position where each photon arrived is encoded in the resulting difference frequency itself, making a virtual 1D array on a single element detector. If the frequency comb is evenly spaced then, conveniently, the Fourier transform of the output waveform is the image itself. Arrays in 2D can be created as well, and since the arrays are virtual, the number of pixels, their size, and their individual gains can be adapted dynamically. The multiplex disadvantage is that the shot noise from all the pixels combine since they are not physically separated.|$|E
5000|$|Mikrophonie I (Work Number 15), for tamtam, 2 microphones, 2 filters, and controllers, is {{an example}} of moment form, {{polyvalent}} form, variable form, and process composition. It consists of 33 structural units, or [...] "moments", which can be ordered {{in a number of different}} ways, according to a [...] "connection scheme" [...] specifying the relationships between successive moments by a combination of three elements, one from each of the following groups: (1) similar, different, or opposite; (2) supporting, neutral, or destroying; (3) increasing, constant, or decreasing [...]In Mikrophonie I two percussionists play a large tam-tam with a variety of implements. Another pair of players use hand-held microphones to amplify subtle details and noises, inflecting the sound through quick (and precisely scored) motions. The last two performers, seated in the audience, apply resonant bandpass filters to the microphone outputs and distribute the resulting sounds to a quadraphonic speaker system. The piece was composed on the basis of the results of an experiment carried out by the composer and Jaap Spek in August 1964: I had bought myself a large tamtam for my composition MOMENTE, and set it up in my garden. I now made some experiments, exciting the tamtam with a great variety of implements - of glass, cardboard, metal, wood, rubber, plastic - that I collected from around the house, and connected a microphone (with strong directional sensitivity) that I held in my hand and moved around, to an <b>electrical</b> <b>filter,</b> whose output led to a potentiometer and was then made audible over a loudspeaker. My collaborator Spek was in the house and changed the filter settings and the dynamic levels, improvising. At the same time, we recorded the result on tape. The tape recording of this first microphony experiment was for me a discovery of the greatest importance. We had made no agreement about what the other would do; I used some of the implements that lay to hand as the mood took me, and at the same time I probed the surface of the tamtam with the microphone, as a doctor probes a body with a stethoscope; Spek also reacted spontaneously to what he heard as the result of our combined activity. (preface to the score of Mikrophonie I, p. 9)After an initial attempt to notate the actions and implements proved impractically complicated, Stockhausen decided to categorize the sounds according to their perceived qualities: [...] "groaning, [...] " [...] "trumpeting, [...] " [...] "whirring, [...] " [...] "hooting," [...] "roaring," [...] "grating, [...] " [...] "chattering, [...] " [...] "wailing, [...] " [...] "sawing, [...] " [...] "ringing, [...] " [...] "choking, [...] " [...] "cawing, [...] " [...] "clacking, [...] " [...] "snorting, [...] " [...] "chirping, [...] " [...] "hissing, [...] " [...] "grunting, [...] " [...] "crunching, [...] " [...] "clinking, [...] " [...] "tromboning, [...] " [...] "scraping, [...] " [...] etc., in a scale of 36 steps from the darkest and lowest to the brightest and highest sounds [...] Through this emphasis on subjectively perceived qualities, [...] "For the first time a perceptual equivalent to totally organized structure has been discovered, and it is particularly significant that this has been done with very simple means. This successful fusion of abstract theory and expression makes Mikrophonie I a work of singular importance" [...]“Someone said, must it be a tam-tam?
