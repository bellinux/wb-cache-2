5000|$|Electric fan heaters are {{unsealed}} appliances {{with live}} electric parts inside, {{so they are}} not safe to use in wet environments {{because of the risk}} of electrocution if moisture provides a conductive path to electrically-live parts. Electric fan heaters usually have a thermal fuse close to the heating element(s) to protect against overheating in the event of fan failure or air intakes becoming blocked, and a tip-over switch to shut the heater off when the <b>fan</b> <b>outlet</b> is not in the required orientation. Metal-cased heaters perform better in the case of possible fire-causing faults than plastic-cased ones, since the case will stay intact and is not flammable, but the metal case presents a higher risk of electrocution if a heater malfunctions.|$|E

40|$|Drift {{is one of}} {{the main}} paths of plant {{protection}} products to non-target organisms. In Germany great efforts are made to reduce drift. Therefore sprayers are tested concerning their drift reducing ability in relation to the German basic drift values which have been determined on the basis of more than 180 drift trials with conventional sprayers. A classification system with classes of at least 50 %, 75 % and 90 % drift reduction has been introduced. Sprayers which meet the requirements of the German guideline are listed in the list of drift reducing sprayers. Nearly all of the sprayers are equipped with air injection nozzles to produce larger droplets.

40|$|The work {{presented}} {{concerns the}} modelling of a fan used for forced convection cooling of a subrack of printed board assemblies (PBAs) {{as a separate}} component for accurate CFD simulations. Detailed measurements of the <b>fan</b> <b>outlet</b> velocity profile (axial, tangential nd radial components) have been made for one fan operating point in a measurement set-up apart from the PBAs. CFD simulations have been made for a simplified version of a subrack, comparing a few elementary fan models. Results how that incorporation of the hub into {{a model of the}} axial fan is necessary. The tangential velocity at the outlet is not negligible. The value of the radial velocity is small throughout the <b>fan</b> <b>outlet</b> plane and may be ignored in a CFD model. 1. ]~ntroduction Detailed measurements of the fan induced velocity pattern which occurs in a printed board assembly (PBA) showed that this pattern is highly non- uniform, resulting in inadequate cooling of parts of the structure [1]. Due to the compacmess of the assembly the lack of uniformity of the velocity profile at the <b>fan</b> <b>outlet</b> has important repercussions on the flow distribution over the different card 'channels'. CFD simulation of the flow can only be successful if it takes this non-uniformity into account. A simulation which used detailed measurements of the velocity pattern upstream of the cards as input conditions, howed important progress in predicting the velocity patterns in the PBA assembly [2].

40|$|Wheat {{as a main}} {{food source}} is partly lost in {{different}} ways such as planting, harvesting, storage and even in consumption processes. This calls for attention to reducing these losses through application of the results from agricultural research, use of new farming practices, improvements in management system and repair and renewal of farm machinery. The present study considers the design, development and evaluation of a new pneumatic air reel system {{as a replacement for}} the conventional mechanical reel. To evaluate the new system, laboratory and field tests were conducted.  In the laboratory tests, the air velocity was measured along the <b>fan</b> <b>outlet</b> width at a 10 centimeter interval from the outlet to 40 centimeters away from it, and corresponding curves of air velocity distribution along the <b>fan</b> <b>outlet</b> width were drawn. On the basis of the results, 13 fans were calculated to be required on the cutting platform of a 14 -foot (4. 3 meter) combine. The results from the field tests of mechanical and air reels show that grain losses of air reel during harvesting are less than those of the mechanical reel because the air reel has no mechanical contact with the crop and applies less shock on plant stem than the mechanical reel. According to the results, grain losses increased linearly with increasing fan speed. In addition to the change of fan speed (2247, 2503, 2860, 3218 and 3932 RPM), three air discharge directions of 10, 20 and 30 degrees from horizontal line were examined. According to the data analysis in Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) through Tukey’s procedure (15 treatments and 6 samples in each treatment), there were significant differences between grain loss at these directions and mechanical reel at a level of 5 %.

Following this, an on-farm byproduct containment and nutrient removal structure was designed to reduce concentrations of P and N in runoff from land adjacent to <b>fan</b> <b>outlets.</b> The BHD ranged in water extractable phosphorus (WEP) concentrations from 4, 720 to 6, 580 mg kg- 1, which was at least 1. 6 times greater than the BL from which it originated.

40|$|Tube-axial {{fans are}} widely used in {{industrial}} applications because of their compactness, simplicity, and low cost. However, the achievable fan pressure rise is generally penalised {{by the absence of}} a straightener and diffuser, and the consequent waste of tangential and axial dynamic pressures at the <b>fan</b> <b>outlet.</b> The corresponding fan efficiency drop might not comply with stringent regulations like the European Directive for energy-related products. Thus, operation ranges of high efficiency need to be clearly defined in the preliminary design phase, especially when constraints on maximum size and/or rotational speed are imposed. This paper proposes analytical formulas and charts to evaluate the efficiency of the tube-axial fan configuration (with or without tail-cone diffuser) when constraints on fan size and/or speed are additional design requirements. The analytical formulas and charts have been validated against experimental data. On this basis, a preliminary design criterion is suggested for high-efficiency tube-axial fans featuring arbitrary vortex design blades of constant swirl type. The criterion is used to design a 315 mm low-to-medium pressure tube-axial fan that is able to operate at a constant aeraulic efficiency peak of approximately 0. 6 for blade positioning angles in the range 20 ° to 30 °...|$|E
