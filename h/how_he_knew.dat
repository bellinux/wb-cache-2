25|$|In October 2000, Zimmer {{performed}} live {{in concert}} {{for the first}} time with an orchestra and choir at the 27th Annual Flanders International Film Festival in Ghent. While writing the score for The Last Samurai, Zimmer felt that his knowledge of Japanese music was extremely limited. He began doing extensive research, but the more he studied, the less he felt he knew. Finally, Zimmer took what he had written to Japan for feedback and was shocked when he was asked <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> so much about Japanese music.|$|E
25|$|Israeli emigrants {{working in}} low status {{immigrant}} occupations that the diaspora Jewish population tends {{not to engage}} in or has long-ago abandoned such as taxi driving, auto repair, security guards, mall cart sales and other tasks. Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir told of a waiter who once came over to her at a New York luncheon and whispered in Hebrew that there was ham in the dish she had been served. When she asked him <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> Hebrew, he told her he was an Israeli. And what work had he done in Israel, she asked. He had been a waiter, he responded.|$|E
500|$|Poe defines Dupin's method, ratiocination, {{using the}} example of a card player: [...] "the extent of {{information}} obtained; lies not so much in the validity of the inference as in the quality of the observation." [...] Poe then provides a narrative example where Dupin explains <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> the narrator was thinking about the actor Chantilly. Dupin then applies his method to the solving of this crime.|$|E

500|$|Whorf {{graduated}} from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1918 {{with a degree in}} chemical engineering where his academic performance was of average quality. In 1920 he married Celia Inez Peckham, who became the mother of his three children, Raymond Ben, Robert Peckham and Celia Lee. Around the same time he began work as a fire prevention engineer (an inspector) for the Hartford Fire Insurance Company. He was particularly good at the job and was highly commended by his employers. His job required him to travel to production facilities throughout New England to be inspected. One anecdote describes him arriving at a chemical plant in which he was denied access by the director because he would not allow anyone to see the production procedure which was a trade secret. Having been told what the plant produced, Whorf wrote a chemical formula on a piece of paper, saying to the director: [...] "I think this is what you're doing". The surprised director asked Whorf <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> about the secret procedure, and he simply answered: [...] "You couldn't do it in any other way." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2005, Eminem played voicemails to the {{audience}} during his Anger Management Tour allegedly from Carey and reported as saying [...] "Why won't you see me? Why won't you call me?". Eminem reiterated his dislike of Carey the following year on a track called [...] "Jimmy Crack Corn" [...] from his compilation album, , with the lyrics [...] "Your mind's on us like mine's on Mariah / And y'all are just like her, you're all fucking liars / But I'll just keep fucking you like I fucked her / Right in the ass with KY yes sir." [...] 50 Cent referenced Carey's denial of the relationship on a track called [...] "All of Me" [...] from his third studio album Curtis in 2007: [...] "Em predicted it all, I don't know <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> it / He said women from Hollywood they liars, liars, liars / You fuck them, they get you heated, deny it like Mariah." [...] Two years later, Eminem released a song called [...] "Bagpipes from Baghdad", on which he took aim at Carey's husband Nick Cannon by calling him a [...] "prick" [...] and wishing him [...] "luck with the fucking whore". The lead single from Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel was [...] "Obsessed". Many critics believed the track to be about Eminem, and its accompanying music video portrayed Carey being followed by a male stalker which critics also thought bore a strong resemblance to the rapper. Mansfield thought that the lyrical content of [...] "Up Out My Face" [...] {{appeared to be a}} continuation of [...] "Obsessed" [...] and her feud with Eminem, as Carey sings [...] "I know you're not a rapper, so you better stop spittin' it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Nemesis the Warlock: [...] " [...] The Gothic Empire" [...] {{introduced}} {{both the}} ABC Warriors and the Ro-Jaws character from Ro-Busters to Nemesis. [...] " [...] The Vengeance of Thoth" [...] featured {{the return of}} Satanus in a major role, and a cameo by a judge of Mega-City One, linking Nemesis to Flesh and Judge Dredd. In a later Dredd strip by Mills, Dredd referred to Satanus' return to the Cretaceous in Nemesis (<b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> about it was not explained).|$|E
2500|$|Sheshet, who, {{as stated}} above, was blind, once mingled with a crowd {{waiting to see}} the entry of the king. A heretic, {{probably}} an adherent of Manicheism, against which Sheshet polemized (comp. Bacher Ag. Bab. Amor. p.78, note 12), taunted him with the remark that he certainly {{would not be able}} to see the king. Sheshet, however, put the heretic to shame by recognizing, despite his blindness, when the instant of the king's appearance was at hand. When the unbeliever, in his astonishment, asked Sheshet <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> it, he received the answer: [...] "The earthly kingdom is like unto the heavenly; God's appearance, however, is announced in I Kings xix. 12-13 by a deep silence" [...] (Ber. 58a).|$|E
2500|$|By 1918 he {{had written}} {{hundreds}} of songs, mostly topical, which enjoyed brief popularity. Many of the songs were for the new dances then appearing, such as the [...] "grizzly bear", [...] "chicken walk", or fox trot. After a Hawaiian dance craze began, he wrote [...] "That Hula-Hula", and then did a string of southern songs, such as [...] "When the Midnight Choo-Choo Leaves for Alabam". During this period, he was creating a few new songs every week, including songs aimed at the various immigrant cultures arriving from Europe. On one occasion, Berlin, whose face was still not known, was on a train trip and decided to entertain the fellow passengers with some music. They asked him <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> so many hit songs, and Berlin modestly replied, [...] "I wrote them." ...|$|E

2500|$|Bloom was a {{huge hit}} {{becoming}} (in 1999) the only album of the band to be certified gold by RIAA. It also marked guitarist Blair's final album, who {{decided to become a}} music producer. In a 2015 interview with Breathecast, Blair talked about his reasons to leave citing his love of [...] "the creative part of writing, recording, being in the studio, putting songs together" [...] as the main factor. In the interview, he refers to the Bloom album as something he was [...] "exceptionally proud of", and <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> he was creating something that had [...] "meaning and will touch people". Blair also added how his interest started {{to move away from the}} touring aspect until he [...] "decided to make the jump to see if I can sink or swim as a producer".|$|E
2500|$|Due to Austria's {{delay in}} writing the ultimatum, the element of {{surprise}} that Germany had counted upon in the war against Serbia was lost. Instead, the strategy of [...] "localization" [...] was adopted, which meant that when the Austro-Serbian war began, Germany would pressure other powers not to become involved even at the risk of war. On 19 July, Jagow published a note in the semi-official North German Gazette warning other powers [...] "that the settlement of differences which may arise between Austria-Hungary and Serbia should remain localized". Asked by Jules Cambon, the French Ambassador to Germany, <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> about the contents of the Austrian ultimatum as he had revealed in the North German Gazette, Gottlieb von Jagow pretended to be ignorant of it. Sir Horace Rumbold of the British Embassy in Berlin reported: [...] "We do not know the facts. The German government clearly do know. They know what the Austrian government is going to demand... and I think we may say with some assurance that they had expressed approval of those demands and promised support should dangerous complications ensure... the German government did not believe that there is any danger of war." ...|$|E
2500|$|In [...] "Remember Me," [...] Clarke and a {{group from}} the Ark set off to a Grounder camp (Tondc) to {{complete}} their agreement for a truce. On the way, Clarke is haunted by visions of Finn. Bellamy tries to convince Clarke {{to let him go}} to Mount Weather as an inside man; Clarke says she cannot lose him too. When they arrive at the village, Clarke burns Finn's corpse, along with the corpses of those he killed, in a traditional Grounder funeral. While grieving, Lexa tells Clarke of Costia, her own past love who was tortured and killed by Lexa's enemy, who believed she knew Lexa's secrets. She tells Clarke that love is weakness. At a dinner, Kane gifts Lexa with a bottle of liquor. When Gustus, her right hand, tests it for her, he appears to be poisoned, leading Lexa to believe it was an assassination attempt by the Sky People. Clarke immediately thinks it was Raven, as she was Finn's former girlfriend and loved him. Clarke confronts her; Raven punches Clarke for accusing her of doing it. Lexa nearly kills Raven, but Bellamy figures out it was Gustus who poisoned the cup, and Clarke proves it to Lexa by drinking from the bottle herself. Lexa kills Gustus. When Lincoln confronts Bellamy about <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> it was Gustus, he says Gustus would do anything to protect Lexa. Clarke decides she sees Lexa's point about how love is a weakness and tells Bellamy he was right and should go to Mount Weather.|$|E

2500|$|Rochefort, with Huckins and Williams, states {{there were}} no dummy {{messages}} used at any time throughout 1941 and no effort by the Japanese to use serious deception. When asked after the attack just <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> where Akagi was, Rochefort (who commanded HYPO at the time) said he recognized her [...] "same ham-fisted" [...] radio operators. (The Japanese contend that radio operators were left behind {{as part of the}} deception operation.) The critical DF-tracked radio transmissions show bearings that could have not come from the strike force. Emissions monitored from CAST, or CAST's report Akagi was off Okinawa on 8 December 1941, are examples, though some transmissions continue to be debated. The contention that [...] "low-powered" [...] radio (such as VHF or what the U.S. Navy called TBS, or talk between ships), might have been used, and detected, is contradicted as impossible due to the tremendous distances involved and when contact was lost, it was routinely presumed it was because low-powered radio and land line were being used. Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests for specific RDF reports remain wanting. [...] "A more critical analysis of the source documentation shows that not one single radio direction finder bearing, much less any locating [...] "fix," [...] was obtained on any Kido Butai unit or command during its transit from Saeki Bay, Kyushu to Hitokappu Bay and thence on to Hawaii. By removing this fallacious lynchpin propping up such claims of Kido Butai radio transmissions, the attendant suspected conspiracy tumbles down like a house of cards." ...|$|E

[...] "Woman of Paris allows us to think for ourselves and does not constantly underestimate our intelligence.

[...] "He's a pioneer. <b>How</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> women!—oh, <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> women!
