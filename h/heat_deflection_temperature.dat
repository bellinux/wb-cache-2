40|$|The thermal and {{thermomechanical}} {{properties of}} poly(phenylene sulphide) (PPS) based nanocomposites incorporating a polymer derivative covalently anchored onto single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) were investigated. The grafted fillers acted as nucleating agents, increasing the crystallization temperature {{and degree of}} crystallinity of the matrix. They also enhanced its thermal stability, flame retardancy, glass transition (Tg) and <b>heat</b> <b>deflection</b> <b>temperatures</b> while reduced the {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} at temperatures below Tg. A strong rise in the thermal conductivity, Young?s modulus and tensile strength was found with increasing filler loading both in the glassy and rubbery states. All these outstanding improvements are ascribed to strong matrix-filler interfacial interactions combined with a compatibilization effect that results in very homogeneous SWCNT dispersion.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the possibility of recycline PVC pipes by investigating {{the effect of adding}} the used PVC pipes (varying from 0 to 80 % wt), into two commercial PVC virgin grades on the rheological, morphological, mechanical and thermal properties the PVC blends. Results obtained showed an increase in the melt viscosity and no change in die swell ratio as the concentration of the recycled PVC was increased. The die swell ratio was observed to increase with temperature, this being associated with HCI gas produced from PVC decomposition, and partly the presence of gelation that occurred at a high temperature. The optimum tensile and impact streanths were detected, this being associated with ductile and brittle deformations, which were explained using SEM micrographs of the fracture surface. The higher the recycled PVC loading the greater the hardness and density of the compounds. The glass transition, decomposition and <b>heat</b> <b>deflection</b> <b>temperatures</b> were also found to shift with recycled PVC loading.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Hybrid {{composites}} of polycarbonate (PC) {{reinforced with}} short glass fibers (GF) and short carbon fibers (CF) were prepared by twin-screw extrusion and injection molding techniques. Composites were produced in different ratios of GF and CF by maintaining the total fiber loading at 40 wt%. The mechanical properties such as tensile, flexural strength, {{and impact of}} these compo-sites were investigated. It was noted that an increase in GF content led to a higher strength of the hybrid composites as compared to CF. Morphological analysis by using scanning electron microscope reveals that CF had poor fibermatrix interactions with PC, which brought about the decrement of stress-transfer efficiency. A poor fibermatrix interaction {{is believed to be}} the main cause of the lower strength enhancement by CF than expected. <b>Heat</b> <b>deflection</b> <b>temperatures</b> of composites increased with the increment of GF content. From dynamic mechanical thermal analysis, high-storage modulus is observed at the temperature below Tg. Meanwhile, it was observed that surface and volume electrical resistivity decreased by increasing the CF content owing to its conductivity.

50|$|The melting {{temperature}} of PLLA {{can be increased}} by 40-50 °C and its <b>heat</b> <b>deflection</b> <b>temperature</b> can be increased from approximately 60 °C to up to 190 °C by physically blending the polymer with PDLA (poly-D-lactide).

In the latter case, PDLA acts as a nucleating agent, thereby increasing the crystallization rate. Biodegradation of PDLA is slower than for PLA due to the higher crystallinity of PDLA.|$|E

40|$|Approximately {{three years}} ago, {{composite}} stereolithography (SL) resins {{were introduced to}} the marketplace, offering performance features beyond what traditional SL resins could offer. In particular, the high <b>heat</b> <b>deflection</b> <b>temperatures</b> (> 250 °C) and high stiffness of these highly filled resins have opened the door to several new rapid prototyping (RP) applications, including wind tunnel test modelling and, more recently, rapid tooling.

In rapid tooling applications, molds made from these resins have been able to successfully produce hundreds of injection molded parts at a time from such plastic materials as ABS, polypropylene, polyethylene, polycarbonate, thermoplastic elastomer and 33 percent glass-filled nylon.

40|$|The thermal and {{mechanical}} behaviour of isotactic polypropylene (iPP) nanocomposites reinforced with different loadings of inorganic fullerene-like tungsten disulfide (IF-WS 2) nanoparticles was investigated. The IF-WS 2 noticeably enhanced the polymer stiffness and strength, ascribed to their uniform dispersion, {{the formation of}} a large nanoparticle?matrix interface combined with a nucleating effect on iPP crystallization. Their reinforcement effect was more pronounced at high temperatures. However, a drop in ductility and toughness was found at higher IF-WS 2 concentrations. The tensile behaviour of the nanocomposites was extremely sensitive to the strain rate and temperature, and their yield strength was properly described by the Eyring s equation. The activation energy increased while the activation volume decreased with increasing nanoparticle loading, indicating a reduction in polymer chain motion. The nanoparticles improved the thermomechanical properties of iPP: raised the glass transition and <b>heat</b> <b>deflection</b> <b>temperatures</b> while decreased the coefficient of thermal expansion. The nanocomposites also displayed superior flame retardancy with longer ignition time and reduced peak heat release rate. Further, a gradual rise in thermal conductivity was found with increasing IF-WS 2 loading both in the glassy and rubbery states. The results presented herein highlight the benefits and high potential of using IF-nanoparticles for enhancing the thermomechanical properties of thermoplastic polymers compared to other nanoscale fillers...|$|R
50|$|Although the temperature, {{time and}} other process {{variables}} differ between parts, the general manufacturing process follows.

To fully exploit the use of wood flour as a filler, the effects of species and particle size need to be examined.

To examine the effects of species, wood flour derived from four species, ponderosa pine, loblolly pine, maple, and oak, was used as a filler for polypropylene at 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 % by weight wood flour.
