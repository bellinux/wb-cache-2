2500|$|Absinthe {{has never}} been illegal to import or {{manufacture}} in Australia. [...] Importation requires a permit under the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulation 1956 due to a restriction on importing any product containing [...] "oil of wormwood". In 2000, an amendment proposed by Foods Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) {{as part of a}} new consolidation of the <b>Food</b> <b>Code</b> across Australia and New Zealand, made all wormwood species prohibited herbs for food purposes under Food Standard 1.4.4. Prohibited and Restricted Plants and Fungi. [...] However, this amendment was found inconsistent with other parts of the preexisting <b>Food</b> <b>Code.</b> The proposed amendment was withdrawn in 2002 during the transition between the two codes, thereby continuing to allow absinthe manufacture and importation through the existing permit-based system. These events were erroneously reported by the media as Australia having reclassified it from a prohibited product to a restricted product. Since this clarification was made, what is claimed to be the first Australian-produced brand of absinthe (Moulin Rooz) was released in 2007.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To disaggregate {{composite}} <b>food</b> <b>codes</b> {{used in the}} UK National Diet and Nutrition Survey (NDNS) {{into their}} individual food components {{in order to provide}} a more complete estimate of intake at the individual food level. Methods: A total of 3216 composite <b>food</b> <b>codes</b> from the NDNS food composition databank were subject to disaggregation. The main food components used were meat, fish, fruit, vegetables and cheese, which were further divided into 26 subcategories. Results: It was shown that previous determination of meat containing composite <b>food</b> <b>codes</b> provided an overestimate of meat intake and underestimate of additional components such as fruit and vegetables. Conclusions: By incorporating disaggregated data into NDNS, variations will be seen in consumption of some main food groups, but these variations may be also attributable to trends in consumption.

40|$|AbstractThe National Cancer Institute (NCI) Food Reporting and Comparison Study (FORCS) compares {{nutrient}} {{and food}} group estimates obtained from recalls collected through the web-based Automated Self-Administered 24 -hour Recall (ASA 24) to those from standard interviewer-administered telephone recalls among 1054 adults. Within the ASA 24 software, respondents {{may choose to}} enter open-ended text to report “unfound food” and “other, specify. ” Respondents use the“unfound food” field to report a food or drink they cannot find; the ASA 24 system then asks a series of general questions to better identify the food. Respondents use the “other, specify” field to provide food details, such as brand name or cooking method, that differ from the responses offered by ASA 24. When respondents use these two open-ended text fields, the system assigns default <b>food</b> <b>codes.</b> Nutritionists reviewed these codes and assigned new codes when appropriate. Nutrient and My Pyramid Equivalent (MPE) values from default <b>food</b> <b>codes</b> (unedited) andthe researcher assigned <b>food</b> <b>codes</b> (edited) were compared. Of the 716 <b>food</b> <b>codes</b> evaluated, changes were made to 248 foods (1. 5 % of total foods reported) which affected 194 (19. 1 %) of all recalls and required over 60 hours of specialized staff time. Although 43 % of the 1013 completed recalls included {{at least one of}} the two text field responses, the ASA 24 systemassigned acceptable default <b>food</b> <b>codes</b> 68 % of the time. Editing did not significantly affect the means and ranking for most nutrients and food group MPE values; correlation coefficients for energy and macronutrient values before and after editing were 0. 95 or higher, suggesting that this editingmaynot be necessary for most large studies using ASA 24...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThere {{has been}} a growing {{interest}} in examining dietary energy density (ED, kcal/g) {{as it relates to}} various health outcomes. Consuming a diet low in ED has been recommended in the 2010 Dietary Guidelines, as well as by other agencies, as a dietary approach for disease prevention. Translating this recommendation into practice; however, is difficult. Currently there is no standardized method for calculating dietary ED; as dietary ED can be calculated with foods alone, or with a combination of foods and beverages. Certain items may be defined as either a food or a beverage (e. g., meal replacement shakes) and require special attention. National survey data are an excellent resource for evaluating factors that are important to dietary ED calculation. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) nutrient and food database does not include an ED variable, thus researchers must independently calculate ED. The objective {{of this study was to}} provide information that will inform the selection of a standardized ED calculation method by comparing and contrasting methods for ED calculation. The present study evaluates all consumed items and defines foods and beverages based on both USDA <b>food</b> <b>codes</b> and how the item was consumed. Results are presented as mean EDs for the different calculation methods stratified by population demographics (e. g. age, sex). Using United State Department of Agriculture (USDA) <b>food</b> <b>codes</b> in the 2005 - 2008 NHANES, a standardized method for calculating dietary ED can be derived. This method can then be adapted by other researchers for consistency across studies...|$|R
