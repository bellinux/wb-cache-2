5|$|There {{are seven}} types of {{units in the}} game. Each unit has a set of {{statistics}} which is displayed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>interface</b> once selected. The statistics range from combat strength, fatigue, efficiency, supply and movement points. During the game, both sides {{have the option to}} request air support {{that can be used to}} attack enemy units. If the other side uses their air support, the player will be given a warning of an oncoming air strike and will have the option to retreat. The game has two endings depending on the side chosen. If playing as NATO, the main objective is to stall Soviet forces long enough until American reinforcements arrive. However, if playing as the Warsaw Pact, the objective is to destroy all NATO forces.|$|E

Biological psychiatry; an approach to psychiatry that aims to understand mental disorders {{in terms of the}} biological function of the nervous system. Child and adolescent psychiatry is the branch of psychiatry that specializes in work with children, teenagers, and their families. Community psychiatry is an approach that reflects an inclusive public health perspective and is practiced in community mental health services. Cross-cultural psychiatry is a branch of psychiatry concerned with the cultural and ethnic context of mental disorder and psychiatric services. Emergency psychiatry is the clinical application of psychiatry in emergency settings. Forensic psychiatry utilizes medical science generally, and psychiatric knowledge and assessment methods in particular, to help answer legal questions. Geriatric psychiatry is a branch of psychiatry dealing with the study, prevention, and treatment of mental disorders in the elderly. Global Mental Health is an area of study, research and practice that places a priority on improving mental health and achieving equity in mental health for all people worldwide. Liaison psychiatry is the branch of psychiatry that specializes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>interface</b> between other medical specialties and psychiatry. Military psychiatry covers special aspects of psychiatry and mental disorders within the military context. Neuropsychiatry is a branch of medicine dealing with mental disorders attributable to diseases of the nervous system. Social psychiatry is a branch of psychiatry that focuses on the interpersonal and cultural context of mental disorder and mental well-being.|$|E

Apple boasted [...] "the back of our computer looks better than the front of anyone else's." [...] Described as [...] "cartoonlike", the first iMac, clad in Bondi Blue plastic, was unlike any personal computer that came before. In 1999, Apple introduced the Graphite gray Apple iMac and since has varied the shape, colour and size considerably while maintaining the all-in-one design. Design ideas were intended to create a connection with the user such as the handle and a breathing light effect when the computer went to sleep. The Apple iMac sold for $1,299 at that time. The iMac also featured some technical innovations, such as having USB ports as the only device inputs. This latter change resulted, through the iMac's success, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>interface</b> being popularised among third party peripheral makers – {{as evidenced by the}} fact that many early USB peripherals were made of translucent plastic (to match the iMac design).|$|E

2500|$|An {{example of}} a simple type system {{is that of the}} C language. The {{portions}} of a C program are the function definitions. [...] One function is invoked by another function. [...] The interface of a function states the name of the function and a list of values that are passed to the function's code. [...] The code of an invoking function states the name of the invoked, along with the names of variables that hold values to pass to it. [...] During execution, the values are placed into temporary storage, then execution jumps to the code of the invoked function. [...] The invoked function's code accesses the values and makes use of them. [...] If the instructions inside the function are written with the assumption of receiving an integer value, but the calling code passed a floating-point value, then the wrong result will be computed by the invoked function. [...] The C compiler checks the type declared for each variable sent, against the type declared for each variable <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>interface</b> of the invoked function.
