5|$|International trade, {{facilitated}} by the shipping route in adjacent Strait of Malacca, and manufacturing are the key sectors. Malaysia is an exporter of natural and agricultural resources, and petroleum is a major export. Malaysia has once been the largest producer of tin, rubber and palm oil in the world. Manufacturing has a large influence in the country's economy, although Malaysia's economic structure <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>moving</b> away from it. Malaysia {{remains one of the}} world's largest producers of palm oil.|$|E
5|$|The Andes are {{a site of}} {{volcanic}} activity, which is usually subdivided into four separate volcanic zones: the Northern Volcanic Zone, the Central Volcanic Zone, the Southern Volcanic Zone and the Austral Volcanic Zone. These volcanic zones are separated by gaps where no recent volcanic activity has occurred. These gaps are not static; the gap separating the Austral and the Southern Volcanic Zones <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>moving</b> northward for the past 15-20 million years.|$|E
5|$|Several {{more people}} are {{attacked}} and reduced to ash. A search of Eastern European employees leads them to Russian night nurse Tomas (Ravil Isyanov), but he is gone when they search his apartment. Despite being ordered to end the investigation and that the suspect is wanted by the Russian government and the CIA, Broyles tells Olivia (Anna Torv) to continue the case. Walter posits the entity needs radiation, and chooses its victims based on their exposure levels. They learn that Tomas stole his comatose brother, a former cosmonaut, and <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>moving</b> him around to both protect him and contain the entity. Fearing capture, Tomas removes his brother from the hospital; Walter speculates that the cosmonaut brought the entity back with him upon returning from space. Walter is finally able to solve the formula, and Broyles sadly tells Tomas over the phone that his brother and the entity cannot be separated. However, during their conversation, the entity escapes his brother's body and kills Tomas. The Fringe team is able to trace the call, and Broyles shoots the host (Tomas' brother) in the head to stop the entity from attacking another victim.|$|E

A number of items in its collection have been, or are in the process of being, digitised, and a catalogue listing search, along with a short description of each item, is available online on the Archives' web site. The Archives releases many of its publications, including periodical newsletters, its annual report and the State of the Archives report, on its web site, and maintains an 'e-shop' to facilitate the sale of copies of some of its text and image holdings to interested members of the public. It is also possible to search the holdings of Malta's National Memory Project, a memory of those who have contributed to the history of Malta, through the Archives' web site.|$|E

25|$|In general, {{poetry in}} the {{contemporary}} era <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>moving</b> {{out of the mainstream}} and onto the college and university campus. The growth in the popularity of graduate creative writing programs has given poets the opportunity to make a living as teachers. This increased professionalization of poetry, combined with the reluctance of most major book and magazine presses to publish poetry, has meant that, for the foreseeable future at least, poetry may have found its new home in the academy and in small independent journals.|$|E
25|$|In the New Testament {{all four}} gospels {{conclude}} with an extended narrative of Jesus's arrest, trial, crucifixion, burial, and his resurrection. In each gospel these five {{events in the}} life of Jesus are treated with more intense detail than any other portion of that gospel's narrative. Scholars note that the reader receives an almost hour-by-hour account of what is happening. The death and resurrection of Jesus are treated as the climax of the story, the point to which everything else <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>moving</b> all the while.|$|E
25|$|Clearly, {{the concept}} of second-tier {{professional}} association football – the fact that clubs can compete at the professional level with low budgets, was something that attracted many amateur clubs across the nation of Japan. At {{the beginning of the}} 2006 season, the league took a survey to determine the number of non-league clubs interested in joining the professional league. The results showed that about 40 to 60 clubs in Japan had plans to professionalize over the next 30 years. From the league's perspective, the J.League 'Hundred Year Vision' from the late '90s <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>moving</b> in a positive direction.|$|E

50|$|Just as the {{convenience}} store groups <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>moving</b> into larger supermarket formats, so the supermarkets <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>moving</b> into smaller formats to challenge the symbol groups. Tesco operate {{a small number of}} Tesco Ireland Local and Tesco Express stores, while Superquinn operates two Superquinn Select convenience stores. Marks and Spencer also operates a small number of convenience stores under the Simply Food banner. While Dunnes Stores does not operate a separate convenience store brand, some of its Dublin city outlets now have an offering more resembling a large convenience store than a traditional supermarket.|$|R
25|$|Geologically, {{this region}} is perhaps more {{appropriately}} called the Arabian subcontinent because it lies on a tectonic plate of its own, the Arabian Plate, which <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>moving</b> incrementally {{away from the}} rest of Africa (forming the Red Sea) and north, toward Asia, into the Eurasian plate (forming the Zagros mountains). The rocks exposed vary systematically across Arabia, with the oldest rocks exposed in the Arabian-Nubian Shield near the Red Sea, overlain by earlier sediments that become younger towards the Persian Gulf. Perhaps the best-preserved ophiolite on Earth, the Semail Ophiolite, lies exposed in the mountains of the UAE and northern Oman.|$|E
25|$|In Rio de Janeiro, buses are {{the main}} form of public transportation. There are nearly 440 {{municipal}} bus lines serving over four million passengers every day, in addition to intercity lines. Although cheap and frequent, Rio's transportation policy <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>moving</b> towards trains and subway {{in order to reduce}} surface congestion and increase carrier capacity. Rio's public transportation service has been a target of many critics and the motive of the 2013's protests and manifestations that started in São Paulo and spread through the entire country. According to the people, the raise in the bus and subway fares are invalid, seeing that the amount charged is too high for the low quality of the services.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, {{the term}} was {{promoted}} most actively by the Communist Party of China during its struggle for power. It was used both as a noun and as a title for basically anyone in mainland China after the People's Republic of China was founded. For example, women were nü tongzhi (female comrade), children were xiao tongzhi (little comrade) and seniors were lao tongzhi (old comrade). However, after the 1980s and the onset of China's market-oriented reforms, this term <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>moving</b> out of such daily usage. It remains in use as a respectful term of public address among middle-aged Chinese {{and members of the}} Communist Party of China. Within the Communist Party, failure to address a fellow member as tóng zhì is seen as a subtle but unmistakable sign of disrespect and enmity.|$|E

He Feng in The China Daily points out, [...] "the sheng nu phenomenon is nothing like the feminist movement in the West, in which women consciously demanded equal rights in jobs and strived for independence." [...] Rather, the change has been [...] "subtle" [...] and that [...] "perhaps decades later, will be viewed as symbolic of China's social progress and {{a turning point for}} {{the role of women in}} its society." ...|$|E
500|$|Since 2007, and {{particularly}} in 2012 and early 2013, the jet stream has been at an abnormally low latitude across the UK, lying closer to the English Channel, around 50°N rather than its more usual north of Scotland latitude of around 60°N. However, between 1979 and 2001, {{it has been found}} that the average position of the jet stream <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>moving</b> northward at a rate of [...] per year across the Northern Hemisphere. Across North America, this type of change could lead to drier conditions across the southern tier of the United States and more frequent and more intense tropical cyclones in the tropics. A similar slow poleward drift was found when studying the Southern Hemisphere jet stream over the same time frame.|$|E
