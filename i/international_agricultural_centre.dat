40|$|One of the {{greatest}} challenges facing mankind today is to satisfy the nutritional needs of the growing world population {{while at the same time}} preserving resources such as land, water, air and biodiversity. Livestock are a crucial element in this balancing process. Demand for livestock products is growing and livestock are, through their multiple functions, a cornerstone of most rural populations world-wide. Livestock occupy 60 % of the world's land area and therefore interact, sometimes negatively, with a large part of the world's natural resources. To develop one without destroying the other was the central focus of an international conference, held in June 1997 and organised by World Bank, FAO and IAC. The proceedings of this conference contain the papers presented, and the conclusions and recommendations of the conference workshops. Spanish and French texts of the recommendations are included.

40|$|At {{the end of}} August 1989 {{more than}} 200 scientists, {{government}} officials and representatives of international institutions from 42 different countries gathered in Wageningen in the Netherlands for the sixth conference of the Association of Institutes for Tropical Veterinary Medicine (AITVM). The aim of the meeting, which was sponsored by CTA, the German Foundation for International Development (DSE), the University of Utrecht (Faculty of Veterinary Medicine) and the <b>International</b> <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Centre,</b> was to identify the achievements, difficulties and future prospects {{in the field of}} tropical animal health and production in four main livestock areas (the subject of workshop discussions) : pastoral systems, dairy production systems, livestock production systems of the humid and sub-humid zones, and helminthiasis in tropical areas. An integrated approach covering technical matters, livestock policies and socio-economic aspects was the organizers' goal. The conference proceedings, published in May 1990, contain the scientific papers as well as the workshop summaries, conclusions and recommendations. The recommendations have also been published in a separate volume for wider distribution. Among the principal recommendations of the workshops was that in project planning, the views, needs and interests of the target group should play a decisive role in the formulation of objectives and operations, laying the foundation for active and sustainable participation. Special attention should be given to an inter-disciplinary approach to activities. Farmers' groups should be strengthened. Special efforts in extension, involving women workers, is needed to reach women farmers. Credit systems and pricing policies should be more realistic. The commitment and dedication of extension personnel is essential for earning farmers' confidence and thereby adoption of improvements. Training and motivation of such personnel requires more time and more funds. In the sub-humid tropics the deficiency of animal products makes livestock development particularly sensitive to policy issues, and lack of clear and appropriate policies have been a major impediment to successful project implementation. Both urban and rural communities need less restrictive pricing policies. Finally, appropriate control strategies for helminth infections, adapted to local conditions, should be worked out They should be based on anthelminthic treatments and also on improved management. Further studies on parasites and on the immune response and status of the hosts must be undertaken. More attention must be paid to extension programmes in order to transfer knowledge to farmers, extension workers, technicians and veterinary officers, and funds must be made available by national and international institutions and organizations.

40|$|Historically, plant {{breeding}} has followed two independent, parallel tracks a formal, scientific one and one followed by farmers. Tuning {{scientific research and}} formal breeding programmes to farmers knowledge and selection criteria {{is an important step}} for achieving food security, especially if food security has to be ensured by resource-poor farmers. As one might expect from an academic plant breeder, I started my career as a formal researcher, trying to develop and release improved varieties. The problem in Cuba nowadays is that most farmers cannot afford expensive inputs such as seeds, machinery and agro-chemicals. Launching new high-yielding varieties that require inputs in order to perform is therefore not always very useful. At one point, I discovered that scientific breeding in itself can be rather useless. I had to refocus my thinking. From just breeding plants, I became the kind of plant breeder who works with farmers, a facilitator in agrobiodiversity who breeds capacity too. And, all the time, convinced that working for low input agriculture is absolutely scientific. Stress situations A major change swept across Cuba {{after the collapse of the}} communist system in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. Cuba s export market evaporated, the country s purchasing power for fuel and agrochemicals was greatly reduced and agricultural production was heavily affected. By 1998, the production of seeds for maize and beans, for instance, was half of what it had been in the 1980 s. This crisis mainly hit large-scale, industrial agriculture. The subsistence producers were less affected. At the same time, small-scale production mushroomed. A pending food crisis encouraged many to start some sort of agricultural production, not only in the rural areas, urban agriculture also rose significantly. The agricultural research evidently had to refocus too. Crop associations, biofertilisers, biological control and organic agriculture became new areas of attention. And we, as breeders, also face new challenges. One example concerned the pumpkin, a popular vegetable in Cuba. In the 1990 s, yields of pumpkin gradually decreased to the extent that pumpkin virtually disappeared from Cuban markets. Lack of inputs had taken its toll and it became clear that these pumpkin breeds were bred to be highly responsive to external inputs. At that moment the search began for varieties that would have good yields even in stress situations, such as drought, high temperatures, and pest and disease outbreaks without using expensive inputs. This was a major challenge. Until then, varieties had been tested and evaluated under controlled circumstances against one type of stress, and not in multiple stress situations. We traced 33 pumpkin landraces and some 20 modern pumpkin varieties and evaluated them. That is when participatory {{plant breeding}} was born in Cuba. The involvement of farmers in growing, breeding and selecting pumpkin varieties on their own fields and not in pilot stations, which is very important and comparing these with what they usually grew, led to two varieties that had promising yields under low input and high stress conditions. In this example we managed to improve the access of farmers to biodiversity and learn from their ways of selecting varieties. In another trial, we asked farmers to grow various kinds of rice, landraces and formal breeds on plots in two different locations. One in a slightly hilly area on poor sandy soils and one in a flat and industrial agricultural area, with farmers used to applying fertilisers and other inputs. The farmers on the sandy soils and the scientists selected a mixture of both landraces and formal breeds as favourites. The farmers in the industrial area preferred the formal sector rice varieties. They were familiar only with these varieties and lacked the knowledge to evaluate the other breeds. Biodiversity is thus also a prerequisite for knowledge. Traditional farmers have a tremendous amount of both experimental and conceptual knowledge about plants, seeds and the performance characteristics of different varieties. They also maintain a rich diversity of varieties of certain plants in their own fields. Gardens of biodiversity In the early eighties, when Cuba was at its peak of industrial agriculture, a study showed that the country s diversity in plant genetic resources was being managed and maintained mainly by non-industrial farmers. The home gardens, particularly, were and still are the cradle of biodiversity. Here, farmers maintain varieties for many purposes, such as food, medicine, marketing and religious purposes, that were not met by the formal agricultural institutions. So, by involving farmers in the selection and breeding process, both farmers and researchers not only learn from each other, it is also the logical way to increase biodiversity and to improve farmers access to biodiversity. Furthermore, if you want farmers to be responsible for the country s food security, you will have to take those farmers and their socio-economic situation as the starting point. The world of plant breeding and seed production, as well as that of policy-makers have to be more open and responsive to this.
