40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to map the distribution of pork retail outlets as well as assess their role in food borne disease transmission. Using a structured questionnaire, practices associated with hygiene related to infrastructure, workers, and equipment were assessed. Sources of pork were assessed to determine whether pork had undergone inspection, as were socio economic determinants of hygiene outcomes and risk factors for foodborne disease. There were 158 pork outlets in the five divisions of Kampala. Overall, 68 % of the pork was from places where slaughtering was not authorized (ungazetted) and meat inspection not carried out. Worker hygiene score was highest (average 71 %), followed by infrastructure (68. 2 %) and equipment (47. 3 %). There was a significant relation between good hygiene and the presence of a public <b>health</b> <b>certificate.</b> However only 42 % of the outlets had a public <b>health</b> <b>certificate.</b> Holding a public <b>health</b> <b>certificate</b> is an important predictor of good practices.

5000|$|However, {{since this}} {{did little to}} reduce prostitution, Austrian laws changed to {{consider}} prostitution as a necessary evil {{that had to be}} tolerated but regulated by the state. In 1850, Dr. Nusser of the Vienna police suggested that prostitutes be required to register with the police, receive medical examinations twice a week, and obtain special <b>health</b> <b>certificates.</b> In 1873, Anton Ritter von Le Monnier, head of the Vienna police, reformed Vienna's prostitution law, and <b>health</b> <b>certificates</b> have been obligatory since that time. Prostitutes who complied with the requirements of registration and examinations were no longer prosecuted by the police. A newspaper article of October 27, 1874 reported that 6,424 prostitutes had received <b>health</b> <b>certificates</b> and were under observation by police and health authorities. According to police estimates, at least 12,000 more women lived on the proceeds of [...] "free love" [...] without being registered. Most of these were factory workers who received so little pay that they needed the additional income. Of the registered prostitutes, 5,312 were unmarried, 902 widows, and 210 married. The youngest was 15 and the oldest 47 years old.|$|R

40|$|AbstractBackgroundSources of {{data used}} in France to {{routinely}} monitor vaccination coverage, {{such as the}} Child <b>Health</b> <b>Certificates</b> and school surveys, allow reliable estimations, but data are not made available with long delays. To rapidly identify recent changes, we have explored the feasibility and relevance of using vaccine reimbursement data. MethodsWe used the Permanent Sample of Beneficiaries, {{a representative sample of}} the National Health Insurance Information System, which contains data on health spending reimbursement of {{the vast majority of the}} population. We first validated this new source by comparing measles vaccine coverage between Child <b>Health</b> <b>Certificates</b> and the Permanent Sample of Beneficiaries. We present herein the results on hepatitis B, meningococcal C, and human papillomavirus vaccination (HPV) coverage. ResultsMeasles vaccine coverage estimated with the Permanent Sample of Beneficiaries (91. 4 %) is very close to the estimation obtained through Child <b>Health</b> <b>Certificates</b> (90. 6 %). For children born in 2011, hepatitis B vaccination coverage at 24 months of age was 88. 7 % for one dose and meningococcal vaccination coverage was 56. 4 % for one dose in December 2013. Of girls born in 1997, 20. 1 % had received the full HPV vaccination series on their 16 th birthday. ConclusionThis novel routine vaccination coverage monitoring tool provides regularly updated reactive and reliable vaccination coverage estimates in children...|$|R
