50|$|Athletes {{ran around}} a 450-meter path {{outside of the}} stadium. In the stadium, there were five rows of <b>hay</b> <b>bale</b> walls. The athletes would enter the stadium and clean a sandbag up and toss it over the <b>hay</b> <b>bale</b> wall. They would then perform a burpee and then jump over the wall. The <b>hay</b> <b>bale</b> clean burpee would be {{performed}} seven times at the same <b>hay</b> <b>bale</b> wall before moving the sandbag to the next wall. After the sandbag is moved, the athletes {{ran back to the}} path to make another lap. The sandbags were 100 pounds for the men and 70 pounds for the women. The event was won by Ricky Garard for the men and Samantha Briggs for the women.|$|R

50|$|A recent {{innovation}} in hay storage {{has been the}} development of the silage or haylage bale, which is a high-moisture bale wrapped in plastic film. These are baled much wetter than <b>hay</b> <b>bales,</b> and are usually smaller than <b>hay</b> <b>bales</b> because the greater moisture content makes them heavier and harder to handle. These bales begin to ferment almost immediately, and the metal bale spear stabbed into the core becomes very warm to the touch from the fermentation process.|$|R
40|$|Storage {{and feeding}} losses can accrue for any <b>hay</b> <b>bale</b> type, but large, round <b>hay</b> <b>bale</b> {{management}} systems {{often lead to}} the greatest and most consistent losses. By the time that hay is fed, much of it will have lost more than 25 percent of its feeding value.

40|$|Individuals {{engaged in}} farming have higher risks of injury and death from trauma {{than many other}} workers. Fatalities most often involve tractor-related {{incident}} such as roll-overs. Although it is also recognized that farm machinery may result in serious injuries and death, little has been reported on problems associated with <b>hay</b> <b>baling,</b> transport and storage. Case 1 : A 43 -year-old man trying to dislodge jammed hay in a hay baler had either been pulled, or had fallen, into the baler, {{where he had been}} crushed, rotated and then cocooned within a <b>hay</b> <b>bale.</b> The body showed extensive blunt trauma to the head, neck, chest, abdomen, pelvis and limbs, with burning from a fire that subsequently started within the overheated machine. Case 2 : A 58 -year-old man was crushed between the moving arms of a hay shuttle and a safety fence. Death was attributed to blunt chest and abdominal trauma with crush asphyxia. Case 3 : A 56 -year-old man fell some distance from the top of stacked <b>hay</b> <b>bales</b> fracturing his neck and causing virtual transection of his cervical spinal cord. These cases demonstrate rare forms of farm deaths that may be associated with the creation (baling), moving (shuttling) and storage of <b>hay</b> <b>bales.</b> All forms of farm machinery should be treated circumspectly, given the possibility that serious injury or death may result from inattention or inappropriate handling. Temporary stacking of <b>hay</b> <b>bales</b> may create high work platforms that risk falls with lethal consequences. Cheryl Charlwood, Roger W. Byar...|$|R

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{evaluated the}} feeding value of grass <b>hay</b> <b>bales</b> previously treated with CCDS in growing cattle diets. In Experiment 1, heifers fed bales treated with 20 % CCDS (DM) gained {{less than those}} fed an equal level of dried distillers grains plus solubles and nontreated hay. In Experiment 2, ADG and F:G linearly improved with increasing CCDS levels. Furthermore, supplementing cattle to meet metabolizable protein requirements when fed diets of CCDS and hay did not improve ADG at levels greater than 15 % CCDS. Data indicate <b>hay</b> <b>bales</b> previously treated with CCDS are adequate for use in growing diets, confirming that within-bale storage is a viable method for CCDS...|$|R

40|$|Hay {{that has}} been baled with {{incorrect}} moisture content or {{that has been}} {{under the influence of}} moisture has potential to generate heat and create a fire hazard. Traditional means of monitoring <b>baled</b> <b>hay</b> temperature in storage, by inserting a pipe probe with thermometer, are time consuming. A ZigBee wireless sensor network could be used to remotely monitor internal <b>hay</b> <b>bale</b> temperatures. Tests were conducted to determine the maximum amount of hay through which a 2. 4 GHz ZigBee module could transmit data and the resulting signal strength (RSSI). Based on analysis of the data, a ZigBee transmitter with 2 mW transmitting power can transmit data through 9 ft of <b>baled</b> <b>hay</b> and a ZigBee transmitter with 50 mW transmitting power can transmit data through 18 ft of <b>baled</b> <b>hay.</b> In general, RSSI decreased significantly with each additional 3 ft of <b>baled</b> <b>hay...</b>|$|R
