25|$|On 16 March 1976, Wilson {{announced}} his resignation as Prime Minister (taking effect on 5 April 1976). He {{claimed that he}} had always planned on resigning {{at the age of}} 60, and that he was physically and mentally exhausted. As early as the late 1960s, he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>telling</b> intimates, like his doctor Sir Joseph Stone (later Lord Stone of Hendon), that he did not intend to serve more than eight or nine years as Prime Minister. Roy Jenkins has suggested that Wilson may have been motivated partly by the distaste for politics felt by his loyal and long-suffering wife, Mary. His doctor had detected problems which would later be diagnosed as colon cancer, and Wilson had begun drinking brandy during the day to cope with stress. In addition, by 1976 he might already have been aware of the first stages of early-onset Alzheimer's disease, which was to cause both his formerly excellent memory and his powers of concentration to fail dramatically.|$|E
25|$|Later {{attempts}} at discovering whether Lucas had actually killed anyone apart from Powell and Rich were complicated by Lucas's {{ability to make}} an accurate deduction that seemed to substantiate a confession. In one instance, he explained how he had correctly identified a victim in a group photograph through her wearing spectacles; a pair of glasses were {{on a table in}} a crime scene photo shown to him earlier. There were also suggestions that the interview tapes showed that, despite Lucas's supposedly low IQ, he had adroitly read the reactions of those interviewing him and altered what he was saying, thereby making his confessions more consistent with facts known to law enforcement. The most serious allegation against investigators, that they had let Lucas read case files on unsolved crimes and thus enabled him to come up with convincingly detailed confessions, made it virtually impossible to determine if, as some continue to suspect, he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>telling</b> the truth to the Lucas Task Force about a relatively large number of the murders.|$|E
500|$|On 4 May fifteen {{volumes of}} the diaries {{were removed from the}} Swiss bank vault and {{distributed}} to various forensic scientists: four went to the [...] and eleven went to the Swiss specialists in St Gallen. The initial results were ready on 6 May, which confirmed what the forensic experts <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>telling</b> the management of Stern for the last week: the diaries were poor forgeries, with modern components and ink that was not in common use in wartime Germany. Measurements had been taken of the evaporation of chloride in the ink which showed the diaries had been written within the previous two years. There were also factual errors, including some from Domarus's [...] that Kujau had copied. Before passing the news to Stern, the [...] had already informed the government, saying it was [...] "a ministerial matter". The managers at Stern tried to release the first press statement that acknowledged the forensic findings and stated that the diaries were forged, but the official government announcement was released five minutes before Sterns.|$|E

[...] "You are flushed, and your eyes are shining, and really you look quite handsome. Raffles <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>telling</b> you something! What was it? Oh, I know! He <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>telling</b> you how he made his money. Hasn't he, now?" ...|$|R

500|$|Crane and Kauffman {{strongly}} envisioned Friends as {{an ensemble}} comedy, and Warner Bros. initially marketed {{the show as}} such by having the cast appear in their entirety for all press, interviews and photo shoots. One of few sitcoms {{at the time to}} be neither a workplace comedy, family sitcom or star a famous comedian, Elizabeth Kolbert of The New York Times explained that each of the show's main characters are [...] "of equal importance." [...] As a writer, Crane preferred it this way because [...] "utilizing six equal players, rather than emphasizing one or two, would allow for myriad story lines." [...] Kauffman echoed [...] "that Friends worked best when the entire ensemble was onstage." [...] The only reason Aniston is credited first during the show's title sequence is because the cast is listed alphabetically. The show's ensemble format is also believed to have prevented jealous conflicts among the cast. Famously, the Friends cast became the first in television history to negotiate as a group for equal salaries, refusing to work until their demands of $100,000 per episode were met during season three, which eventually increased to $1 million per episode by seasons nine and ten– approximately $25 million per year. Alongside Cox and actress Lisa Kudrow, who portrays Phoebe, Aniston became the highest-paid television actress of all time. By then, Aniston had surpassed Cox as the show's most famous cast member due to having launched an international hair trend with the [...] "Rachel" [...] and successfully transitioning into a film career, combined with her high-profile relationship with her then-husband, actor Brad Pitt, who had once guest starred in an episode of the show. At times the producers would use the actress' popularity to boost the show's ratings, notably her character's seventh season kiss with actress Winona Ryder and pregnancy arc. Aniston <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>telling</b> the press that the show's ninth season would be her last, and was initially hesitant to return to Friends to film its tenth and final season. She explained to NBC's Matt Lauer, [...] "I wanted it to end when people still loved us and we were on a high. And then I was also feeling like, ‘How much more of Rachel do I have in me?’” However, the actress ultimately agreed to complete the tenth season of Friends, which was reduced from 24 to 18 episodes to accommodate Aniston's busy film schedule.|$|E
2500|$|Then Caddo Republican Chairman Reginald Hargrove {{said that}} the party members [...] "all owe him a debt of gratutide." [...] According to Hargrove, Despot had {{encouraged}} local GOP factions to mend their differences {{in preparation for the}} 1991 state and parish elections and the 1992 national elections. [...] "He <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>telling</b> people to go out and work with us," [...] Hargrove added.|$|E
2500|$|This {{reaction}} {{was met with}} a virulent reply by Iorga, whose renewed accusations borrowed from antisemitic discourse: [...] " [...] about many things {{that he does not}} comprehend. He was crafting with his clumsy hands manuals, grammars, anthologies, dictionaries for speculative profit. I however had an explanation for such defects. We all know that Mr. Șăineanu is not a Romanian, and we know that which he is. His people has many traits that are very elevated and noble, but also many defects that are low and ungainly. These, I <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>telling</b> myself, are in his blood; he could never get rid of them. I wish to talk about the passion for high praise and multiple earnings, without much investment". In 1907, Iorga and his Neamul Românesc journal also retorted against Caragiale's praise for Șăineanu, calling Caragiale one who [...] "deals with the Jews", and prompting Caragiale to satirize Iorga's own scholarly ambitions.|$|E

2500|$|The Edsel was {{introduced}} amid considerable publicity on [...] "E Day"—September 4, 1957. It was also promoted by a top-rated television special, The Edsel Show, on October 13, but the promotional effort {{was not enough}} to counter the adverse initial public reaction to the car's styling and conventional build. The day after its launch, the Edsel was described as a [...] "reborn LaSalle," [...] a brand that had disappeared in 1940. [...] For months, Ford <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>telling</b> the industry press that it [...] "knew" [...] (through its market research) that there would be great demand for the vehicle. [...] Ford also insisted that, in the Edsel, it had built exactly the [...] "entirely new kind of car" [...] that Ford had been leading the buying public to expect through its preintroduction publicity campaign for the car. In reality, however, the Edsel shared its engineering and bodywork with other Ford models, and the similarities were apparent once the vehicle was viewed firsthand.|$|E
2500|$|By 409, Emperor Daowu, who {{was said}} to be under the effect of {{poisonous}} substances given him by alchemists, was described to be so harsh and paranoid in his personality that he constantly feared rebellion, particularly because fortunetellers <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>telling</b> him that a rebellion would happen near him. [...] He occasionally would not eat for days, or would not sleep overnight. [...] He often mumbled about his past accomplishments or defeats, and he suspected all of his officials. [...] Sometimes when officials made reports to him, he would suddenly think of their past faults and punish or even kill them. [...] Occasionally, when others would behave even slightly inappropriately, he would be so angry that he would kill them personally and display their bodies outside the palace. [...] The entire government came under a spell of terror. [...] The only persons immune from this treatment were said to be the minister Cui Hong and his son Cui Hao, who were said to avoid the disaster by never offending or flattering the emperor—both of which could have brought disaster.|$|E
2500|$|Teeny, {{also known}} as [...] "Little Girl" [...] and [...] "Sis" [...] (Marian Jordan) – a {{precocious}} youngster who frequently tried to cadge loose change from Fibber (often in cahoots with her rarely heard best friend Willie Toops). She often ended her sentences with [...] "I betcha!", and when someone mentioned food, or a word {{that sounded like a}} food, she usually responded [...] "I'm hungry." [...] Teeny was also known to lose track of her own conversations. When Fibber showed interest in what she was saying, she would forget all about it, and her conversation would switch from telling to asking. After Fibber repeated everything she <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>telling</b> him, Teeny would reply [...] "I know!" [...] or [...] "I know it!" [...] in a condescending way. Her appearances were sometimes foreshadowed by Molly excusing herself to the kitchen or to have a nap. Fibber would wistfully deliver a compliment to her, saying, [...] "Ah, there goes a good kid," [...] upon which the doorbell would ring and Teeny would appear, usually greeting Fibber with [...] "Hi, mister!" [...] On rare occasions Molly and Teeny would interact. In the December 21, 1948 broadcast Fibber learned that her real name was [...] "Elizabeth" [...] from a Christmas card she had sent him. She was perpetually a child, and her permanent youth was only mentioned once; Fibber asked her how old she was, to which she responded, [...] "Five". Then he asked how long she'd been coming over to visit him and Molly. [...] "Nine years," [...] she answered. Then, after a pause, she asked, [...] "Ain't it a wonderful world, mister?" ...|$|E

60|$|I feel a {{good deal}} of {{hesitation}} about telling you this story of my own.

It is not a story told by a person sitting round a fire on Christmas Eve, drinking whisky punch: it is a record of events that actually happened.|$|R
