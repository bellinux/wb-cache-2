5|$|Aykroyd {{had never}} written a {{screenplay}} before, as he admitted in the 1998 documentary, Stories Behind the Making of The Blues Brothers, or even read one, {{and he was}} unable to find a writing partner. Consequently, he put together a very descriptive volume that explained the characters' origins and how the band members were recruited. His final draft was 324 pages, which was three times longer than a standard screenplay, written not in a standard screenplay format, but more like free verse. To soften the impact, Aykroyd made a <b>joke</b> <b>of</b> the thick script and had it bound with the cover of the Los Angeles Yellow Pages directory for when he turned it in to producer Robert K. Weiss. Landis was given the task of editing the script into a usable screenplay, which took him about two weeks.|$|E

25|$|On August 8, 2006, 19 {{days after}} the first American landing, the PRT was {{attacked}} for the first time. Captain Frank Brooks, commanding at LZ Warheit, was dismayed to discover the PRT could not be quickly supported by LZ Warheit. From the PRTs position, that resembled {{the bottom of a}} funnel, it could not be seen or supported with indirect fire due to the multi-level and complicated local terrain. The tall mountains made a <b>joke</b> <b>of</b> two dimensional maps, and rendered pre-determined landmarks useless. Eventually supporting aircraft scattered the attackers, but if the weather had been a problem, air support would not have provided the decisive results.|$|E
25|$|Rubin {{tried unsuccessfully}} to provide {{evidence}} of the damaging effect of TV on young minds by issuing subpoenas to actor Telly Savalas, star of Kojak, and to nationally known experts {{on the relationship between}} violence and television. After Zamora was convicted and sentenced to life, he unsuccessfully appealed his sentence, blaming Rubin for the TV intoxication defense which he claimed had made a <b>joke</b> <b>of</b> his trial. The federal appeals court ruled that evidence against Zamora was overwhelming and that Rubin had made the best of a weak case; the defense had in fact helped Zamora by focusing attention on Zamora's deprived background. Zamora was released from prison in 2004 after having served 27 years in prison. A Costa Rican national, Zamora was repatriated to that country.|$|E

25|$|Following Byrne's departure, Wolverine {{remained}} in X-Men. The character's growing popularity {{led to a}} solo, four-issue, Wolverine (September–December 1982), by Claremont and Frank Miller, followed by the six-issue Kitty Pryde and Wolverine by Claremont and Al Milgrom (Nov. 1984– April 1985). Marvel launched an ongoing solo book written by Claremont with art by John Buscema in November 1988. It ran for 189 issues. Larry Hama later took over the series and had an extensive run. Other writers who wrote for the two Wolverine ongoing series include Peter David, Archie Goodwin, Erik Larsen, Frank Tieri, Greg Rucka, Mark Millar, and Gregg Hurwitz. Many artists have also worked on the series, including John Byrne, Gene Colan, Marc Silvestri, Mark Texeira, Adam Kubert, Leinil Francis Yu, Rob Liefeld, Sean Chen, Darick Robertson, John Romita, Jr., and Humberto Ramos. During the 1990s, the character was revealed to have bone claws, after his adamantium is ripped out by Magneto in X-Men #25, which {{was inspired by a}} passing <b>joke</b> <b>of</b> Peter David's.|$|E
25|$|Because of this, {{even though}} Jazani never stroked out nonviolent struggle, {{but in the}} current {{circumstance}} {{came to the conclusion}} that open political activity is inconceivable. The government has left no possibility for this kind of activity; therefore the only method of struggle is guerrilla warfare. In the selection of this tactic Jazani and the members of the group were effected by the guerrilla warfare of South America and Vietnam and the works of Che Guevara, Fidel Castro, and Régis Debray were their main teachers. It should be noted that it was only Jazani and Zia-Zarifi that worked on the ideology of the group. The reaction towards secret activities and book reading resulted in the unimportance of theory in the group. Some of the members of the group were disgusted of any kind of research and made <b>joke</b> <b>of</b> it. From early 1957, the group acted to address this problem but its effects on the group remained. The change of the stance of the group resulted in the decrease of the importance of struggle in the mountains and between the villagers and increase in the importance of the struggle in the cities and the group prepared its activities according to that. But this change of tactics led to problems in the center of the group. Manoochehr Kallantari that he does not believe in the ideology of the group and Shahrzad believed that the group could not make it work. Even though after discussions they changed their positions and accepted the decision of the center of the group but in reality they were sidelined from the group's activities. Kallantari was sent to London and Shahrzad was transferred to the reserve force and in October 1967 because of disagreement with the method of stealing from the bank, after the ruling from the center of the group he was let off from the organization.|$|E
500|$|Upon release, Prism {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} music critics. Jon Dolan from Rolling Stone gave the album {{three out of}} five stars, writing that [...] "Perry and her longtime collaborators Dr. Luke and Max Martin often go for a darker, moodier intimacy à la high-end Swedish divas Robyn and Lykke Li. Perry has always {{done a great job}} of letting us know she's in on the <b>joke</b> <b>of</b> pop stardom. Sadly, she doesn't always bring that same sense of humor and self-awareness to the <b>joke</b> <b>of</b> pop-star introspection. The album's raft of ripe-lotus ballads is larded with Alanis-ian poesy she can't pull off". Nick Catucci from Entertainment Weekly gave the album a B+ and stated that [...] "Katy's superpower, now more than ever, is minting songs so relatable that their insights quickly scale up to inspirational..... Now she grasps that she's making the mainstream, not just swimming in it".|$|E

500|$|Charles Boner was {{the first}} to {{translate}} [...] "The Princess and the Pea" [...] into English, working from a German translation that had increased Andersen's lone pea to a trio of peas in an attempt to make the story more credible, an embellishment also added by another early English translator, Caroline Peachey. [...] Boner's translation was published as [...] "The Princess on the Peas" [...] in A Danish Story-Book in 1846. [...] Boner has been accused of missing the satire of the tale by ending with the rhetorical question, [...] "Now was not that a lady of exquisite feeling?" [...] rather than Andersen's <b>joke</b> <b>of</b> the pea being placed in the Royal Museum. Boner and Peachey's work established the standard for English translations of the fairy tales, which, for almost a century, as Wullschlager notes, [...] "continued to range from the inadequate to the abysmal".|$|E
500|$|Channel 5 aired The Big Benefits Row: Live, {{their own}} {{unconnected}} {{debate about the}} welfare state, on 3 February. Presented by Matthew Wright, the show featured a panel of guests made up of Conservative MP Edwina Currie, reality television star Katie Hopkins, former London Mayor Ken Livingstone, broadcaster Terry Christian, former model Annabel Giles, and two people associated with James Turner Streetcharity campaigner Rev. Steve Chalke and Dierdre Kelly, known in the series as White Dee. The programme was watched by 2.1 million viewers. The Daily Express {{described it as a}} [...] "heated debate" [...] in which Hopkins was heavily critical of Kelly for claiming welfare, and of Giles's modelling career. The Independents Jess Denham felt that Hopkins's [...] "larger-than-life personality" [...] had dominated proceedings, while [...] "fact-based arguments were lost to the non-stop barrage of immature tempers". The Daily Mirror described it as [...] "a mess of a programme and a <b>joke</b> <b>of</b> a discussion".|$|E
500|$|The {{problem was}} finding a radar that was {{suitably}} small; CH radar's huge towers obviously {{could not be}} swung about in this fashion. By this time the Army had made considerable progress on adapting the AI electronics {{to build a new}} radar for detecting ships in the English Channel, CD, with an antenna that was small enough to be swung in bearing. In 1938, RAF pilots noted they could avoid detection by CH while flying at low altitudes, so in August 1939, Watt ordered 24-CD sets under the name Chain Home Low (CHL), using them to fill gaps in CH coverage. These systems were initially rotated by pedalling on a bicycle frame driving a gear set. A <b>joke</b> <b>of</b> the era [...] "was that one could always identify one of the W.A.A.F. R.D.F. operators by her bulging calf muscles and unusually slim figure". Motorized controls for CHL were introduced in April 1941.|$|E

Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club, who gave the episode a B+ grade, said the episode included both pathos and [...] "big laughs". He particularly liked the <b>joke</b> <b>of</b> Andy attending all his honeymoons: [...] "The thought of Andy forlornly embarking on a couple's massage solo or sharing a romantic hot-air balloon ride with himself was funny and sad in the best Office tradition." [...] Entertainment Weekly writer Jeff Labrecque said the episode was [...] "unusually sweet", but said the double date with Pam, Jim, Phyllis and Bob [...] "felt slightly undercooked". Josh McAuliffe of The Times-Tribune of Scranton, Pennsylvania, said the episode was [...] "a highly amusing, if not fantastic, half-hour" [...] and particularly praised the opening scene involving the phone system salesman.|$|E

[...] The gag was written by staff writer George Meyer, and is series creator Matt Groening's favorite <b>joke</b> <b>of</b> the series. While the episode's ending is one of Groening's favorites, fans were uneasy with it. Selman stated that the ending [...] "drives them [...] crazy", since they do not know whether or not the episode is canonical. In 2007, Homer's line [...] "Oh, I smell barbeque!" [...] was included in Bobby Bryant of The States list [...] "20 Essential Things I've Learned From Homer Simpson".

500|$|... "Peterotica" [...] {{was written}} by Patrick Meighan and {{directed}} by Kurt Dumas. The episode ran into multiple objections from broadcasting standards and the show's producers.

A sequence showing all of the different erotic novels written by Peter was edited for the television version; one entitled Catcher in the Eye {{was removed from the}} television version as broadcasting standards disliked the cover, which implied her eye was a target for semen during ejaculation. The scene of Peter reading his new erotic novel to Lois was never cut from airing, although the producers of Family Guy had some trouble with it, as it is the second semen <b>joke</b> <b>of</b> the episode. When Lois' father, Carter, sits down at the breakfast table, Lois states: [...] "Daddy, did you remember to clean up?" [...] Originally, she was meant to say, [...] "Daddy, did you remember to wipe yourself?", but broadcasting standards objected, so it was modified to [...] "Daddy, did you remember to clean yourself?"
