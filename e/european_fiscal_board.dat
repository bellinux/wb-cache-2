40|$|Following {{numerous}} {{reforms of}} fiscal governance in the eurozone since 2011, the year 2016 saw another important innovation: {{the founding of}} the <b>European</b> <b>Fiscal</b> <b>Board</b> (EFB) with the selection and appointment of its five members. The EFB was one of the elements envisaged by the Five Presidents' Report in June 2015 (Juncker et al., 2015) for a future "Fiscal Union". It is the only element among those in the report to have been established within such a remarkably short time span. The decision to create this new institution was taken by the European Commission (EC) in October 2015. The Board began operating shortly after its members were appointed in October 2016...|$|E

40|$|Highlights] Fully-fledged federations assign {{fiscal policy}} {{stabilisation}} {{largely to the}} federal level, based on a relatively large budget. In the euro area, a large federal budget is unrealistic at {{the current level of}} political and societal integration, and fiscal stabilisation will continue to rely mainly on national policies. For aggregate fiscal policy to become more stabilising with respect to the economic cycle, while achieving long-term sustainability, it is necessary (i) to avoid imposing self-defeating fiscal adjustments on crisis countries by making sovereign debt restructuring a real possibility (which involves strengthening the banking sector and extending the remit of the European Stability Mechanism); (ii) to task the planned independent <b>European</b> <b>Fiscal</b> <b>Board</b> with delineating exceptional times during which fiscal coordination is needed on top of monetary policy; (iii) to make national fiscal policies more stabilising by allowing incremental investment and unemployment spending to be shifted from bad to good times based on national adjustment accounts. We also recommend a move towards a European unemployment (re-) insurance scheme targeted at 2 ̆ 018 large 2 ̆ 019 shocks, with varying contributions from countries and a minimum set of labour-market harmonisation criteria, which in any case are desirable for the functioning of monetary union...|$|E

40|$|The {{stabilization}} {{provided by}} the US federal budget {{has been used as}} an example of the adjustment mechanisms that are lacking in Europe and which are needed to make a currency area viable. This paper presents four sets of findings that suggest that the benefits of a <b>European</b> <b>fiscal</b> federation would be modest. First, we show that some of the previous estimates of the benefits of the US federal budget overestimate the amount of interstate insurance by a factor of 3. Second, Europe already has national tax systems which, according to our estimates, can insure more than 50 % of a <b>European</b> <b>fiscal</b> federation. Third, we find evidence that the potential insurance benefits of a <b>European</b> <b>fiscal</b> federation have decreased over time. Fourth, there are large cross-country differences in the benefits {{provided by the}} federation. We conclude that the potential to provide interregional insurance by creating a <b>European</b> <b>fiscal</b> federation is too small to compensate the many problems associated to its design and implementation. 1...|$|R

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{develops a}} blueprint for a <b>European</b> <b>fiscal</b> union. The proposal addresses the shortcomings of most other reform designs which do not offer a solution for insolvent or noncooperative euro countries. We suggest a design which combines fiscal insurance with an orderly procedure to restructure the debt of an insolvent euro member. We show that fiscal insurance and a sovereign insolvency procedure are no contradiction but, on the contrary, mutually enforcing: An effective fiscal insurance helps to limit the stability risks involved {{in the implementation of}} an insolvency regime for sovereigns. And vice versa, a well-defined insolvency procedure reduces the danger that a fiscal capacity motivated as an insurance against transitory asymmetric shocks degenerates into a permanent transfer system. Moreover, we show that both elements are a helpful complement for the functioning of the European banking union and the new <b>European</b> <b>fiscal</b> governance. ...|$|R
