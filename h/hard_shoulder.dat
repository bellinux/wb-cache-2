5|$|The Department for Transport (DfT) is {{currently}} investigating {{the possibility of}} extending the M54 westward to Shrewsbury, thereby placing the county town on the UK motorway map for the first time. Currently traffic has to continue onto the dual carriageway A5 when the M54 ends at Wellington although the road surface or speed limits do not change at all but the road. It is not motorway standard from the M54 J7 to the Shrewsbury ring road, because laybys {{would need to be}} removed and a <b>hard</b> <b>shoulder</b> would also need to be built which could cause delays to traffic.|$|E
5|$|The {{road was}} {{originally}} built with two lanes in each direction, {{but with an}} unusually wide central reservation to accommodate a third lane to be added each way at a later date. The work was a compromise between the Ministry of Transport and Drake, the latter who thought two lanes would not be adequate. Initially, the shoulders were hardened with gravel but not paved, a fact still reflected in the British term <b>hard</b> <b>shoulder.</b> A hedge was planted {{along the length of}} the central reservation to help reduce dazzle from the headlights of oncoming traffic at night. The road was constructed to not be a long length of straight road and with the addition of various bridges and tree planting, in the hope to prevent driver boredom reported on foreign motorways.|$|E
25|$|The A40 is a dual {{carriageway}} from the Inner Ring Road in Central London, {{and is one}} of the two busiest western radials. Much of the traffic using the A40 joins the M40. At J1 (the Denham Roundabout) outbound there is a lane drop to accommodate the non-motorway traffic. The A40 carries on to become the M40 with two lanes and a <b>hard</b> <b>shoulder</b> outbound, three lanes and a <b>hard</b> <b>shoulder</b> London bound. The motorway is carried over the top of the roundabout, which interchanges with the A40 (A413, A412) (outbound), the A4020 (original route of the A40) and the A412 southbound. The original line of the A40 can be seen going straight through the roundabout.|$|E
5000|$|The {{bridge was}} built with three lanes each way, with full <b>hard</b> <b>shoulders.</b> In 2002-04, it was widened to four lanes each way, {{with the result}} that the <b>hard</b> <b>shoulders</b> are no longer of full width.|$|R
50|$|There are 4 {{lanes and}} 2 <b>hard</b> <b>shoulders</b> on the bridge, {{but they are}} wide enough to be {{expanded}} to 6 lanes and 2 <b>hard</b> <b>shoulders</b> should the ring road in the area be widened. The cable-stayed part of the bridge is 590 m long, with a 300 m span.|$|R

25|$|Most {{sections}} of Germany's autobahns are modern, containing two or three, sometimes four lanes {{in addition to}} an emergency lane (<b>hard</b> <b>shoulder).</b> A few other sections remain in an old state, with two lanes, no emergency lane, and short slip-roads and ramps.|$|E
25|$|Pre-2009 {{proposals}} {{to widen the}} motorway between junctions 25 and 28 to four lanes were withdrawn in January 2009 and replaced by a project to install <b>hard</b> <b>shoulder</b> running and a smart motorway system between junctions 25 and 30. Work started in 2014 to install the system around the M62 – M60 section.|$|E
25|$|In 2010 it was {{announced}} that <b>hard</b> <b>shoulder</b> running would be introduced from Junction 3 to Junction 12. As of January 2012 no further information is available on the Highways Agency Website other than mention of the scheme on the main map showing the network and proposed works where it is proposed that work will start 'post 2015'.|$|E
50|$|The N5 is a two-lane, single {{carriageway}} route {{throughout its}} entire length. The road has wide driving lanes and <b>hard</b> <b>shoulders</b> for 65 km between Castlebar and {{just west of}} Frenchpark, and between Strokestown and Longford for 20 km. The rest of the route has just short sections with <b>hard</b> <b>shoulders</b> but many remaining stretches were widened slightly during resurfacing works in the past 10 to 15 years.|$|R
50|$|The M90 lacks <b>hard</b> <b>shoulders</b> for an 8 mi section. In {{this section}} there are {{emergency}} lay-bys at 1/4 mi intervals instead.|$|R

25|$|The minibus was {{transporting}} 14 children home to Worcestershire from {{a school}} trip to London when it veered into {{the rear of the}} motorway maintenance lorry which was stationary on the <b>hard</b> <b>shoulder.</b> Twelve of the 14 children and the driver of the minibus, their teacher, were killed in the crash, one of the worst on the British road network. The two survivors sustained minor injuries.|$|E
25|$|Shortly after midnight, {{the vehicle}} struck a 12.5-ton Bedford {{motorway}} maintenance truck {{parked on the}} <b>hard</b> <b>shoulder</b> of an unlit stretch of the M40 near junction 15. The truck's safety lights were flashing. The minibus, which {{was estimated to be}} travelling at 73 to 84mph {{at the time of the}} collision, exploded shortly after the crash and the bodies of several victims remained trapped in the wreckage.|$|E
25|$|When {{referring}} to individual lanes on dual carriageways, {{one does not}} consider traffic travelling the opposite direction. The inside lane (in the British English sense, i.e. the lane beside the <b>hard</b> <b>shoulder)</b> refers to the lane used for normal travel, while the middle lane is used for overtaking cars on the inside lane. The outside lane (i.e. closest to oncoming traffic) is used for overtaking vehicles in the middle lane. The same principle lies with dual carriageways with more than three lanes.|$|E
50|$|Another {{improvement}} {{scheme was}} also {{completed in the}} mid 1990s between Innishannon and Bandon. The road was widened, <b>hard</b> <b>shoulders</b> added to the road and climbing lanes also added.|$|R
50|$|In 2006, 5.3 km of {{this road}} were {{upgraded}} to improved single carriageway with <b>hard</b> <b>shoulders.</b> A similar 14.4 km improvement including a bypass of Clonroche is being planned.|$|R
50|$|There are a {{total of}} 1,831 km of paved {{highways}} in Hong Kong. These roads are built to British standards with a maximum of four lanes with <b>hard</b> <b>shoulders.</b>|$|R
25|$|In October 2007, {{following}} a successful trial on the M42 in the West Midlands, the UK government have announced that two {{stretches of the}} M6 will be upgraded to allow the <b>hard</b> <b>shoulder</b> {{to be used as}} a normal running lane during busy conditions under a scheme called Active Traffic Management. The two stretches, between junctions 4 and 5 and between junctions 10a and 8, are two of the busiest sections on the entire motorway. The system could also be extended onto other stretches of the M6 as the government is going to undertake a feasibility study to determine other likely locations where this technology can be used.|$|E
25|$|Dual carriageways of {{this class}} differ from {{motorways}} {{in a number}} of ways. The <b>hard</b> <b>shoulder</b> is demarcated with a dashed yellow line (as opposed to an unbroken yellow line on motorways). The standard speed limit of 100km/h (62mph) for national routes usually applies (by default the limit is 80km/h (50mph) for non-national roads, even if dual carriageway). Local authorities have the power to apply a limit of up to 120km/h (75mph) as used on most motorways (The High Quality Dual Carriageway section of the N1 between the end of the M1 and the border with Northern Ireland and the N25/N22 Ballincollig Bypass in Cork are the only route sections with such special limits).|$|E
25|$|The section around Ashford (junctions 9–10) was {{originally}} the A20 Ashford Bypass with actual construction having started before World War 2 – although the route itself was not opened until 19 July 1957. The bypass started at Willesborough near the current location of junction 10 and terminated {{south of the}} existing junction 9 at the current Drover's Roundabout. A section of the old bypass is still visible now named Simone Weil Avenue. The original bridge that brought Canterbury Road over the bypass is still visible as the bridge was not reconstructed when the motorway was constructed. This section of motorway has no <b>hard</b> <b>shoulder</b> indicating the smaller width of the old bypass.|$|E
5000|$|Adding more {{capacity}} at bottlenecks (such as {{by adding}} more lanes {{at the expense}} of <b>hard</b> <b>shoulders</b> or safety zones, or by removing local obstacles like bridge supports and widening tunnels) ...|$|R
2500|$|This policy {{results from}} {{concerns}} {{expressed by the}} National Roads Authority. A local authority is not obliged to implement this policy and can disregard this policy at its own discretion. This would usually only occur in exceptional circumstances or where planners are overruled by elected councillors using section 140 of the Local Government Act 2001. Accordingly, <b>hard</b> <b>shoulders</b> are included wherever feasible {{to provide for the}} resulting pedestrian and cyclist traffic, and are present on much of the national route network. [...] These <b>hard</b> <b>shoulders</b> may also be used as running lanes by motorised traffic under certain conditions.|$|R
5000|$|Yellow or amber markers [...] - [...] These {{are found}} {{next to the}} central {{reservation}} (US: median) on motorways and dual carriageways and, in the Republic of Ireland, are also used on <b>hard</b> <b>shoulders.</b>|$|R
25|$|Once a fleeing {{driver is}} {{contained}} on a motorway, a rolling block is initiated {{ahead of the}} pursuit. When the pursuit reaches the slowed traffic, the suspect can either attempt to pass the traffic or stay behind it. If the suspect chooses to stay behind the traffic, communication between the pursuing vehicles and the blocking vehicle(s) {{will lead to the}} block coming to a standstill, and the vehicle is surrounded and occupants detained. If the fleeing driver chooses to pass the traffic, usually on the <b>hard</b> <b>shoulder,</b> the pursuing vehicles follow it. Once past the traffic, the police vehicles can box in the suspect's vehicle and bring it to a controlled stop through coordinated braking, utilizing the sterile area in front of the blocking vehicle(s) to do so without endangering other road users.|$|E
25|$|The M2 {{was still}} busy between Junctions 1 and 4, and {{suffered}} from HGVs blocking the outside lane. In 2000 work began on widening the M2 from two lanes to four lanes. A {{joint venture between}} Costain, Skanska and Mowlem (CSM) created the company that would undertake the project. The project required the redesign of Junction 2 and Junction 3, and a second Medway Bridge. The existing bridge was converted to a four lane eastbound carriageway (including a <b>hard</b> <b>shoulder).</b> The new bridge formed the westbound carriageway. The entire stretch was lit with streetlights (the old section was not lit). The old Medway Bridge was physically narrowed by removing part of the footpath. High-pressure water cutting equipment was used to cut the concrete into manageable sections for disposal. There is only one path {{open to the public}} now.|$|E
25|$|On February 22, 2011, in a {{game against}} the Carolina Hurricanes, Staal was checked by his brother, Eric. Marc was looking down, {{fighting}} for the puck with another Hurricanes player, when Eric came and threw a <b>hard</b> <b>shoulder</b> check, and Marc was slow to get up. It was a legal check, and Marc played {{for the rest of the}} season, setting career highs with 22 assists and 29 points. However, it was revealed before the Rangers' 2011 training camp began that Staal was suffering from post-concussion symptoms. He did not play until January 2, 2012, in the 2012 NHL Winter Classic against the Philadelphia Flyers. He only played 46 games in 2011–12, struggling to get his timing back from the injury as he posted a career worst −7 and only five points (two goals and three assists). He got better as the season went on, however, and helped the Rangers reach the Eastern Conference Finals.|$|E
50|$|These roads do {{not have}} <b>hard</b> <b>shoulders</b> and {{therefore}} they cannot be designated as Motorway at some future date. The Irish variant,however, has 3.5m lanes where {{there are a number}} of Swedish variants some with 3.25m wide lanes.|$|R
50|$|The road is 45 km long. It is {{generally}} {{of a very}} high standard for a regional road, with wide lanes, <b>hard</b> <b>shoulders,</b> and turning bays. It is still heavily used by traffic avoiding the tolled M4 between Kilcock and Kinnegad.|$|R
25|$|The N4 Sligo road has a bypass {{around the}} town, which {{consists}} of single carriageway with <b>hard</b> <b>shoulders</b> and four roundabouts. It was opened on 2 June 1995 and constitutes part of the planned Longford Ring Road which will encircle the town when completed.|$|R
25|$|The Second Severn Crossing {{marks the}} lower {{limit of the}} River Severn {{and the start of}} the Severn Estuary. It is further {{southwest}} than the Severn Bridge and because it is closer in-line with the landward sides of the M4, it reduces the length of the journey when travelling between England and Wales. The junctions at each end are designed for most traffic to use this crossing, and in order to use the old Severn Bridge crossing, one has to leave the M4 at junction 21 and join the M48 near Aust or at junction 23 near Magor. The new crossing carries more traffic than the Severn Bridge, which is still in use. It is much wider than the Severn Bridge, having three lanes and a narrow <b>hard</b> <b>shoulder</b> each way, compared to the two lanes, cycle path and narrow footpath of the original crossing. The position of the bridge is close to that of the Severn Tunnel, which has carried the railway line beneath the river bed since 1886.|$|E
25|$|In August 2016 {{part of a}} {{pedestrian}} footbridge connecting areas of Ryarsh divided by the motorway was brought down - initially suspected {{to be the result}} of an impact by a digger from nearby works to widen the southbound bridge at junction 4 being carried on a low-loader that was moving along the <b>hard</b> <b>shoulder.</b> In the incident, the southern section of the bridge - which rested on a plinth south of the motorway and the cantilevered northern section - was dislodged and fell onto the carriageway below, landing on the trailer of a passing HGV and being narrowly avoided by a motorcyclist who suffered broken ribs taking avoiding action. Both carriageways of the motorway were closed to enable the removal of the broken section. The motorway reopened with the Highways Agency having declared that the northern part of the bridge was structurally intact. However this section of the motorway was again closed on the weekend of 3 and 4 September 2016 for the demolition and clearance of the northern bridge element.|$|E
25|$|At 9:30 pm, Donohoe and Ryan {{entered the}} car park of the Lordship Credit Union {{premises}} and they parked, as did another {{car that was}} accompanying them from another credit union branch. They both parked beside the car belonging to officials from Lordship. At this point a navy-blue coloured Volkswagen Passat - that had been waiting stationary on the <b>hard</b> <b>shoulder</b> of the road - drove across the road and blocked the entrance. Four members of the gang were hiding behind a wall surrounding the car park, all wearing balaclavas, while a fifth was driving the car. Two gang members approached the detectives' car from the rear, and as Donohoe opened his door and stepped out to investigate why the car had blocked the entrance, he was instantly shot at close range {{in the back of}} the head with a long barrelled shotgun by a masked raider. A single shot was fired. It was dark, and before Ryan could realise what was taking place he was held at gunpoint and ordered out of his car and onto the ground by a number of gang members possessing a shotgun, handgun and a hammer. Neither officer had time to draw their weapons. The raiders then broke into a car belonging to credit union staff from Lordship, threatening them, which was carrying cash and cheques to the value of about €40,000, but only took a bag with €4,000, mistakenly leaving behind more than €30,000. Ryan and the credit union staff were left physically uninjured as the gang of five fled the scene, but Ryan was dispossessed of his car keys in an attempt to hinder his reaction. It was only after the perpetrators had escaped that the alarm could be raised.|$|E
50|$|The {{first part}} of the road was opened in March 1968 as the Skelmersdale Regional Road between what is now {{junctions}} 4 & 5. It was originally a two lane single carriageway road that was upgraded to 2 lane plus with <b>hard</b> <b>shoulders</b> in 1973.|$|R
50|$|The {{standard}} of the N5 road {{is a significant}} political issue in Mayo. Local politicians have argued that because the N5 is the main access route to the county, it should be upgraded to a consistent standard - a single carriageway road with <b>hard</b> <b>shoulders,</b> bypassing all towns along the route.|$|R
50|$|The route was urban {{over its}} entire length, which, at just over 2 km made the N82 {{by far the}} {{shortest}} national secondary road. Despite being recently built it had no <b>hard</b> <b>shoulders,</b> bus lanes or cycle tracks; it was single carriageway narrow two-lane road and had 6 roundabouts in those 2 kilometres.|$|R
