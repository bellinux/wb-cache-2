5|$|This is not {{the place}} to pass judgements, but perhaps I may say that, as it seems to me, both the monks and Tischendorf deserve our deepest gratitude, Tischendorf for having alerted the monks to the {{importance}} of the manuscript, and the monks for having undertaken the daunting task of searching through the vast mass of material with such spectacular results, and then <b>doing</b> <b>everything</b> in their power to safeguard the manuscript against further loss. If we accept the statement of Uspensky, that he saw the codex in 1845, the monks must have worked very hard to complete their search and bind up the results in so short a period.|$|E
5|$|Fifteen {{years after}} {{becoming}} abbot, one {{morning after the}} Divine Liturgy a group of approximately thirty monks rose against Symeon, who drove them away. Breaking the locks on the monastery gate on their way out, the monks took their appeal to the Patriarch Sisinios, who sided with Symeon and sent the monks into exile. Symeon pleaded on their behalf, <b>doing</b> <b>everything</b> he could to have the monks return to the monastery, including seeking {{out some of the}} monks to apologize to them. During his time as abbot, Symeon wrote Hymns of Divine Love (completed during his exile), the Discourses, and many letters and polemical works which have been lost. He also wrote articles relating to his disputes with the church theologians—these survived as his theological and ethical treatises. In 1005 Symeon resigned as abbot of St. Mammas, appointing one of his disciples in his stead, and taking up a more solitary life at the monastery.|$|E
5|$|President Andrew Johnson {{appointed}} Ewing as U.S. Minister to Holland, {{where he}} served from 1866 to 1870. This appointment may have drawn the ire of the Radical Republicans, for Speaker of the House James G. Blaine urged President Ulysses S. Grant that Ewing be recalled and replaced with his brother, Charles Ewing. Blaine told the President that Hugh was 'acting badly'. Blaine himself was disingenuous, having represented to prominent politicians in Ohio including Senator John Sherman that he was <b>doing</b> <b>everything</b> possible to nominate his close personal friend, former Ohio General Roeliff Brinkerhoff, for the post. Nonetheless, Blaine's request to recall General Ewing was never acted upon, possibly due {{to the influence of}} his sister, whose husband General Sherman was a very close friend to President Grant.|$|E

25|$|Romário {{was one of}} {{the most}} talked about stars leading up to the 1990 World Cup in Italy, but picked up a serious injury three months before the big kick-off. Despite <b>doing</b> <b>everything</b> to recover in time and being rewarded with a spot in the squad, his lack of fitness meant he was {{restricted}} to playing only 66 minutes in one match, against Scotland. Brazil were eliminated in round of 16 by their rivals Argentina.|$|E

I hope the time will come when the Chemical Warfare Service can be entirely abolished.|$|E

25|$|Longtime {{teammate}} Marcos Ambrose {{left the}} team in 2015, and he was replaced by Sam Hornish Jr. as the driver of Petty's other entry.

Almirola finished fourth in the cut race, <b>doing</b> <b>everything</b> he could to make it in. Despite missing the playoffs, Almirola scored another top-five at Dover, a track which the team had traditionally been strong at. He wound up finishing seventeenth in points, top of the non-Chase field.|$|E
25|$|China and Zaire {{shared a}} common goal in Central Africa, namely <b>doing</b> <b>everything</b> {{in their power to}} halt Soviet gains in the area. Accordingly, both Zaire and China covertly funneled aid to the FNLA (and later, UNITA) in order to prevent the MPLA, who were {{supported}} and augmented by Cuban forces, from coming to power. The Cubans, who exercised considerable influence in Africa in support of leftist and anti-imperialist forces, were heavily sponsored by the Soviet Union during the period. In addition to inviting Holden Roberto and his guerrillas to Beijing for training, China provided weapons and money to the rebels. Zaire itself launched an ill-fated, pre-emptive invasion of Angola in a bid to install a pro-Kinshasa government, but was repulsed by Cuban troops. The expedition was a fiasco with far-reaching repercussions, most notably the Shaba I and Shaba II invasions, both of which China opposed. China sent military aid to Zaire during both invasions, and accused the Soviet Union and Cuba (who were alleged to have supported the Shaban rebels, although this was and remains speculation) of working to de-stabilize Central Africa.|$|E

There's actually a fascinating lesson in filmmaking, because everything that they did reflects back to the script or looks like something from the script, and people assume that, if I hated it, then they’d changed the script...but it wasn’t so much that they’d changed the script; it’s that they just executed {{it in such a}} ghastly fashion as to render it almost unwatchable." ...|$|E

She speaks of the dedication in lines such as [...] "I can be an engine / Buzzing like a bee / I'm a real independent".
