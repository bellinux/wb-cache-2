40|$|Women <b>with</b> <b>a</b> {{multiple}} pregnancy {{can expect a}} different labor and birth course than those <b>with</b> <b>a</b> singleton pregnancy. While the postpartum period {{is similar to that}} of <b>families</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> singleton, it is likely to be more hectic in <b>families</b> <b>with</b> multiple infants. In addition, a {{multiple pregnancy}} increases both maternal and neonatal risks; therefore, women <b>with</b> <b>a</b> multiple pregnancy may experience slight differences in care due to these potential risks, including additional monitoring and treatment. This article discusses the intrapartum and postpartum considerations <b>families</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> multiple pregnancy/birth may experience.

5|$|Birt, Hogg, and Dubé {{examined}} a <b>family</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> hereditary thyroid cancer {{and discovered that}} many of the members had fibrofolliculomas, trichodiscomas, and acrochordons, which became defined as the classical symptoms of the eponymous disease. The first case of spontaneous pneumothorax associated with BHD was discovered in 1986; the first case of renal cancer followed in 1993 and the presence of lung cysts in people with BHD was confirmed in 1999. It was formerly thought that people with Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome were at higher risk for colorectal polyps and neoplasms, but this has been disproven. The BHD Foundation supports research into the syndrome and holds regular symposia in BHD and related disorders for researchers, clinicians, and family members.|$|E
5|$|Born into a <b>family</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> strong {{military}} background, Romesha {{joined the}} U.S. Army in 1999, and was posted {{at various times}} in Germany, South Korea and Colorado. Trained as an M1 Abrams tank crewman, Romesha had seen four deployments, including to Kosovo, Iraq twice, and Afghanistan. On October 3, 2009, {{he was assigned to}} the 3rd Squadron, 61st Cavalry Regiment, 4th Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division, deployed to Combat Outpost Keating in eastern Afghanistan. When a force of 300 Taliban insurgents attacked the base, Romesha was credited with rallying his comrades and leading the counterattack, directing close air support and providing suppressive fire to help the wounded to an aid station. Despite being wounded, Romesha continued to fight through the 12-hour battle.|$|E
5|$|Robert Frank, a {{professor}} of child development at Oakton Community College in Illinois, conducted a study comparing households with a stay-at-home dad and households with a stay-at-home mom. His study concluded that women were still able to form a strong bond with their children despite working full-time outside the home. Also, women working full-time were often more engaged with their children {{on a day-to-day basis}} than their male counterparts. His study concluded that in a <b>family</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> stay-at-home dad arrangement, the maternal and paternal influences are equally strong. This contrasts with the more traditional family structure where the father works outside the home and the mother stays home with the children. In this type of arrangement, the mother's influence is extremely strong, whereas the father's is relatively small. The study found that both parents play an equal role in a child's development, but the stay-at-home dad arrangement is the most beneficial for the child.|$|E

5|$|The Eurasian {{tree sparrow}} (Passer montanus) is a {{passerine}} {{bird in the}} sparrow <b>family</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> rich chestnut crown and nape, and a black patch on each pure white cheek. The sexes are similarly plumaged, and young birds are a duller version of the adult. This sparrow breeds over most of temperate Eurasia and Southeast Asia, where it {{is known as the}} tree sparrow, and it has been introduced elsewhere including the United States, where it is known as the Eurasian tree sparrow or German sparrow to differentiate it from the native unrelated American tree sparrow. Although several subspecies are recognised, the appearance of this bird varies little across its extensive range.|$|E
5|$|Born into {{an aristocratic}} Prussian <b>family</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> {{long history of}} {{military}} service, Manstein joined the army {{at a young age}} and saw service on Western Front and Eastern Front during the First World War (1914–18). He rose to the rank of captain {{by the end of the}} war and was active in the inter-war period helping Germany rebuild her armed forces. In September 1939, during the invasion of Poland at the beginning of the Second World War, he was serving as Chief of Staff to Gerd von Rundstedt's Army Group South. Adolf Hitler chose Manstein's strategy for the invasion of France of May 1940, a plan later refined by Franz Halder and other members of the OKH. Anticipating a firm Allied reaction should the main thrust of the invasion take place through the Netherlands, Manstein devised an innovative operation—later known as the Sichelschnitt ("sickle cut")—that called for an attack through the woods of the Ardennes and a rapid drive to the English Channel, thus cutting off the French and Allied armies in Belgium and Flanders. Attaining the rank of general at the end of the campaign, he was active in the invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941 and the Siege of Sevastopol (1941–1942), and was promoted to field marshal on 1 July 1942. He also participated in the Siege of Leningrad.|$|E
