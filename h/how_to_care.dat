5|$|Thoughts on the {{education}} of daughters: with reflections on female conduct, in the more important duties of life is the first published work of the British feminist Mary Wollstonecraft. Published in 1787 by her friend Joseph Johnson, Thoughts is a conduct book that offers advice on female education to the emerging British middle class. Although dominated by considerations of morality and etiquette, the text also contains basic child-rearing instructions, such as <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>care</b> for an infant.|$|E
25|$|This type {{of nursing}} is {{designed}} to help the public and is also driven by the public's needs. The goals of public health nurses are to monitor the spread of disease, keep vigilant watch for environmental hazards, educate the community on <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>care</b> for and treat themselves, and train for community disasters.|$|E

25|$|Research {{with and}} caring for infant rhesus monkeys further {{inspired}} Harlow, and ultimately led {{to some of his}} best-known experiments: the use of surrogate mothers. Although Harlow, his students, contemporaries, and associates soon learned <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>care</b> for the physical needs of their infant monkeys, the nursery-reared infants remained very different from their mother-reared peers. Psychologically speaking, these infants were slightly strange: they were reclusive, had definite social deficits, and clung to their cloth diapers. For instance, babies that had grown up with only a mother and no playmates showed signs of fear or aggressiveness.|$|E
25|$|Detector Dog teams (consisting {{of a dog}} and {{a single}} handler) undergo a 10-week {{training}} course at the CBSA Learning Centre. The handlers are Border Services Officers, and are trained on <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>care</b> for, maintain, and train their dogs. They are also trained to understand the Cone of Scent. Odour particles always disperse {{in the shape of}} a cone: more concentrated at the source, and less concentrated farther away. After the initial training, the handler must keep up a training regimen to ensure their dog remains in top form. Only about 1 in 10 dogs who begin the training eventually become detector dogs.|$|E
25|$|Laws {{governing}} the material support of terrorism proved contentious. It was {{criticized by the}} EFF for infringement of freedom of association. The EFF argues that had this law been enacted during Apartheid, U.S. citizens {{would not have been}} able to support the African National Congress (ANC) as the EFF believes the ANC would have been classed as a terrorist organization. They also used the example of a humanitarian social worker being unable to train Hamas members <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>care</b> for civilian children orphaned in the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians, a lawyer being unable to teach IRA members about international law, and peace workers being unable to offer training in effective peace negotiations or how to petition the United Nations regarding human rights abuses.|$|E

25|$|Zoey came to {{live with}} the Mileses shortly after she was born. Zoey's mother, a captive-bred {{orangutan}} named Lucky, didn't know <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>care</b> for her new baby, having never seen it done in the wild. As a result, little Zoey had to be placed in the care of Mrs. Miles, a primatologist at the zoo, and the only character with the time and patience to be Zoey's foster parent. Molly tries her hardest {{to get used to the}} new family member, even making Zoey her current-events project for school, but after having her homework destroyed and her mother's time taken up by the baby orangutan she gives up and begins desperately wanting things to be normal again. After Zoey ingests a bottle of shampoo and has to be rushed to the hospital, Molly learns what it truly means to be a big sister and to care about Zoey, no matter how much trouble she causes.|$|E
25|$|Despite the Camarillo Ranch House’s ideal {{location}} in Southern California, {{back in the}} early 1900s the home struggled to stay warm. Almost every room in the house has a fireplace in it. Adolfo looked to technology as a way to remedy problems that would arise on the ranch. He was the first farmer to ever purchase a refrigerator, which at that time, would take up an entire room in the house. However, he was able to safely store perishables {{for the first time in}} his life. He also had multiple heaters installed throughout the house in hopes of providing more warmth to his family. The most beautiful room in the Camarillo Ranch house belonged to Adolfo's middle daughter Carmen. Carmen was an avid equestrian who learned <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>care</b> for and maintain the horses from the Ranch Manager, Meliton Ortiz. Up until Meliton Ortiz’ death in 2010, he would visit the Camarillo Ranch House frequently to provide stories and details about his life growing up on the ranch. The home was remodeled in 1914, when the oldest daughter Carmen married. They opened many rooms by taking down walls and changing the stair design. The grand parlor had the greatest changes from this, causing it to go from multiple to rooms to one giant open grand parlor. This was in the hopes that it would open up the house more.|$|E
500|$|The many eye {{injuries}} {{resulting from}} the disaster led to better understanding {{on the part of}} physicians of <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>care</b> for damaged eyes, and [...] "with the recently formed Canadian National Institute for the Blind, Halifax became internationally known as a centre for care for the blind", according to Dalhousie University professor Victoria Allen. The lack of coordinated pediatric care in such a disaster was also noted by a surgeon from Boston named William Ladd who had arrived to help. His insights from the explosion are generally credited with inspiring him to pioneer the specialty of pediatric surgery in North America. The Halifax Explosion also inspired a series of health reforms, including around public sanitation and maternity care.|$|E

2500|$|Alfred {{knew that}} {{literature}} and learning, both in English and in Latin, were very important, {{but the state}} of learning was not good when Alfred came to the throne. Alfred saw kingship as a priestly office, a shepherd for his people. One book that was particularly valuable to him was Gregory the Great's Cura Pastoralis (Pastoral Care). This is a priest's guide on <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>care</b> for people.

2500|$|Changes to {{psychiatric}} healthcare between 1982 and 1990 and {{in particular}} new medications, saw the reduction of patients being cared for in 'Long Stay' wards and instead moving from institutionalisation to assisted self-care. Hundreds of patients were supported as they gained or often regained knowledge of <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>care</b> for themselves before leaving the hospital to move perhaps into a house {{with three or four}} other patient friends initially within, and later discharged to a house outside the hospital.

The lawsuit alleges the surgeon noted an abnormal artery in McMath’s throat {{but did not}} notify the nurses that this placed the girl {{at increased risk for}} serious hemorrhaging. Additionally, the lawsuit alleges McMath bled from approximately 7:30pm to 12:35am, that a doctor said “(expletive), her heart stopped” when he arrived hours after the family said they requested a doctor, and that the family was given conflicting information from nurses regarding <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>care</b> for McMath’s bleeding.

2500|$|On 10 December 2015, Cotillard voiced the French {{version of}} the short film Home, made by Conservation International (CI). The short film debuted at the United Nations Momentum for Change Awards {{ceremony}} at the climate negotiations (COP21) in Paris. It was the latest addition to CI's award-winning [...] "Nature Is Speaking" [...] short film series. [...] "Home" [...] was produced to remind negotiators and world leaders at the climate talks of our common duty – <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>care</b> for the Earth that cares for us all.

("Segítség, Ember!") was {{inspired}} by his younger son, Benjamin, an animal enthusiast who kept all kinds of pets in his room from hamsters to parrots and a dozen aquariums full of tropical fish. The book explains how to look after pets and exotic animals, written in a humorous and sarcastic style {{from the point of}} view of the animals, revealing how silly humans can be with their pets when they have no clue <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>care</b> about them. The book was a critical success, became a bestseller and never went out of print since it appeared. It was also made into a musical and its chapters have become a common choice for school children attending recital and speaking competitions.|$|E

2500|$|When Bow was 16, {{her mother}} Sarah fell from a second-story window and {{suffered}} a severe head injury. She was later diagnosed with [...] "psychosis due to epilepsy". From her earliest years, Bow had learned <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>care</b> {{for her mother}} during the seizures, {{as well as how}} to deal with her psychotic and hostile episodes. She said her mother could be [...] "mean" [...] to her, but [...] "didn't mean to... she couldn't help it". Still, Bow felt deprived of her childhood; [...] "As a kid I took care of my mother, she didn't take care of me". Sarah worsened gradually, and when she realized her daughter was set for a movie career, Bow's mother told her she [...] "would be much better off dead". One night in February 1922, Bow awoke to a butcher knife held against her throat by her mother. Clara was able to fend off the attack, and locked her mother up. In the morning, Bow's mother had no recollection of the episode, and later she was committed to a sanatorium by Robert Bow.|$|E
