500|$|By {{finishing}} {{third in}} the IPL, the Daredevils qualified for the 2012 CLT20. Before the tournament, Morkel decided {{to play for the}} Daredevils and not for his home team the Titans. The franchise changed the team captain to Jayawardene as per the suggestion of Sehwag, who wanted to be [...] "relieved of the responsibility" [...] in order to [...] "bat freely". Aavishkar Salvi came in as a replacement for Aaron, who was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> tonsillectomy. Sehwag strained a ligament during the 2012 ICC World Twenty20, due to which he was initially doubtful for the CLT20; however he recovered from the injury and played in the tournament. In his preview for ESPNcricinfo, Sidharth Monga said that the team had [...] "some of the best names Twenty20 cricket can throw up." [...] He termed Morkel as the key player and Unmukt Chand as the [...] "surprise package". However, he said that the team's failure in big-matches and lack of spinners were its weaknesses. The team had a practice match with the Sydney Sixers, which it lost by 5 wickets.|$|E

TV Guide Kate Stanhope gave a mixed {{review of}} the episode, opining that [...] "the episode moved a little slow for what was the last season premiere." [...] She praised the sequence in which Bree and Gabrielle attempt {{to get rid of}} Alejandro's car, writing, [...] "I always love the Bree-Gaby scenes because they contradict each other in such an interesting way." [...] She enjoyed that the Bree character was [...] "turning back into the controlling perfectionist we grew to love rather than the carefree woman she became" [...] in the seventh season. Stanhope was critical of the Lynette and Tom storyline, opining: [...] "it's annoying that their relationship has been reduced to this gimmick... I was never on board with the whole Tom and Lynette split simply because it felt less honest and more of a last-ditch effort to cause conflict. But if they're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> with separating the formerly stable couple, at least go through with it all the way and show Lynette really and truly on her own." [...] She also believed the Renee storyline to be a waste of Vanessa Williams's talents. Tanner Stransky of Entertainment Weekly called the episode's overall storyline [...] "too juicy a landmine to not have the repercussions play out deliciously on this, the show’s last season." ...|$|E

500|$|Avatar {{has been}} called [...] "without a doubt the most epic piece of {{environmental}} advocacy ever captured on celluloid.... The film hits all the important environmental talking-points—virgin rain forests threatened by wanton exploitation, indigenous peoples who have much to teach the developed world, a planet which functions as a collective, interconnected Gaia-istic organism, and evil corporate interests {{that are trying to}} destroy it all." [...] Cameron has spoken extensively with the media about the film's environmental message, saying that he envisioned Avatar as a broader metaphor of how we treat the natural world. [...] He said that he created Pandora as [...] "a fictionalised fantasy version of what our world was like, before we started to pave it and build malls, and shopping centers. [...] So it's really an evocation of the world we used to have." [...] He told Charlie Rose that [...] "we are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> a lot of pain and heartache if we don't acknowledge our stewardship responsibilities to nature." [...] Interviewed by Terry Gross of National Public Radio, he called Avatar a satire on the sense of human entitlement: [...] " [...] is saying our attitude about indigenous people and our entitlement about what is rightfully theirs is the same sense of entitlement that lets us bulldoze a forest and not blink an eye. It's just human nature that if we can take it, we will. And sometimes we do it in a very naked and imperialistic way, and other times we do it in a very sophisticated way with lots of rationalization—but it's basically the same thing. A sense of entitlement. And we can't just go on in this unsustainable way, just taking what we want and not giving back."

SAFE and Farmwatch are not seeking to improve welfare conditions for animals per se. Higher animal welfare standards and practices are, of course, always preferable to an animal experiencing increased levels of suffering due to non-compliance. However, improving animal welfare standards will never be enough. Instead, they take an animal rights position, whereby the animal is not regarded as human property but rather as a sentient being with the right to live life on his/her own terms. An animal rights position extends the notion of rights to animals who are considered to have inherent value and interests of their own (Francione, 1995).|$|R

2500|$|When {{asked whether}} the members {{consider}} Believer a [...] "Christian band" [...] Daub replies {{in an interview with}} Metal Covenant in 2009: [...] "Well, yes, and no... this is a difficult subject to approach for us. Ever since we formed Believer, Kurt Bachman and myself despised being limited to a certain belief or style of music. We did not like to be labeled or numbered. Whether it was our personal spiritual journey, or the type of music we played. We were called thrash, death metal, technical death metal etc. The key focus for us then and now is to just encourage people to think for themselves." [...] Daub comments about the lyrics that [...] "We always wrote about what was near and dear to our heart. On Extraction, we used Bible based themes and stories to express our intentions, but {{we did not want to}} preach." [...] "Well we never wanted to be known as a Christian band for one [...] It was one of these things where it got out of control. With promoting records it was one of those things where the record company was like “Hey, here’s a slant. Something different. [...] Something new and unique. Let’s go for that”. I’ve always tried to stay away from labeling the band. For me it’s a band, it’s entertainment. We even get called death metal some times even though I don’t think we resemble anything death metal-ish out there, but then again I have my own opinions on what death metal is. We just don’t want it to be one of those things where someone’s like “oh I hate thrash music, so I won’t like Believer”. You get labeled and we’re <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> labels but we’re not really comfortable with any." [...] says Bachman in an interview on MetalSucks.|$|R

Executive producer Kieran Roberts said [...] "It's a really interesting story. It's come from character, as Simon is a child who has obviously been through a very difficult few years with the death of his mother, his dad’s alcoholism and then being passed around by the adults in his life. He's seen a lot of difficult things and he's got some more difficult things <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> this year in the next few months.

Jessica tries to process the difficult truth that her husband is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> die.
