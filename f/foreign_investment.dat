5|$|This was {{a success}} for the western {{development}} project at some level, for statistics show a substantial growth in <b>foreign</b> <b>investment</b> in the western regions. However, the rate of progress was not equal in all regions, partially due {{to the creation of}} the West Triangle Economic Zone, which sped up development in Chengdu, Chongqing, and Xi'an, but slowed down development in other areas of the West. For example, while foreign direct investment in Chongqing grew, <b>foreign</b> <b>investment</b> in other Western Chinese cities like Guizhou, Guangxi, and Ningxia declined significantly, dropping about USD $19.71, $250.96 million, and $34.54 million respectively.|$|E

The Automotive Products Trade Agreement of 1965 opened Canada's borders {{to trade in}} the automobile manufacturing industry.

In the 1980s, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's Progressive Conservatives abolished the NEP and changed the name of FIRA to Investment Canada, to encourage <b>foreign</b> <b>investment.</b> The Canada– United States Free Trade Agreement (FTA) of 1988 eliminated tariffs between the two countries, while the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) expanded the free-trade zone to include Mexico in 1994.|$|E

In this paper we build unique measures of outward and inward <b>foreign</b> direct <b>investment</b> (FDI) counts at the NUTS 2 level and we assess the relationship between regional productivity and <b>foreign</b> <b>investments</b> in Europe. Regions with larger outflows of <b>foreign</b> <b>investments</b> show higher productivity growth, but this correlation fades down with the number of investments and eventually becomes negative in regions with very high outward orientation. Inward investments are also positively associated with regional productivity growth, but only above a certain threshold. Results are robust to the introduction of a number of regional characteristics, to the control for endogeneity of <b>foreign</b> <b>investments,</b> and for spatial dependence.
