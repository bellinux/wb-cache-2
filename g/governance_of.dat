Such statute is a pivotal linkage between principles and good practices, because it becomes enforceable from within the company itself, as the basic by-law concerning corporate <b>governance.</b> statute <b>of</b> <b>governance,</b> principles <b>of</b> <b>governance,</b> good practices, Australian Stock Exchange, corporate governance. ...|$|R
