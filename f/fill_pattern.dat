Activities in time-distance diagrams are displayed both along a time axis and along a distance axis according to their relative linear position. This allows showing not only the location of the activity but also the direction of progress and the progress rate. Activities can be presented as geometrical shapes showing the occupation of the work site over time such that conflicting access can be detected visually. Different types of activities are differentiated by color, <b>fill</b> <b>pattern,</b> line type, or special symbols. A symbolic drawing along the distance axis is often used to improve the understanding of the time-distance diagram.|$|E
