500|$|Costume {{designer}} Michele Clapton designed most of {{the newly}} introduced costumes and jewelry in [...] "The Winds of Winter". Clapton had initially left the series, but returned for the final two episodes of the season to design four different costumes. In an interview, Michele Clapton spoke about the process and meaning behind Cersei Lannister's gown and crown in the season finale. Clapton stated that she had four to five weeks to create the gown, but once she received the script for the episode, she was [...] "immediately sure" [...] of how the dress should look. She stated in the interview, [...] "I <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be leather and I <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be linked to Tywin. I wanted a distinct, strong silhouette, so I squared her shoulders. I also wanted the dress to skim her ankles, {{so that you could}} see her feet—again, strength. The silver shoulders are decorated in a similar manner to Jaime's gold hand—the one person that she still has something with." [...] Clapton also noted that every part of the dress represents something, saying, [...] "There is no 'decoration' to Cersei." [...] She stated that she additionally chose to make the dress black in order to represent mourning, as well as a [...] "deadness inside her." ...|$|E
500|$|On April Fools' Day on , Sunsoft {{announced}} that a sequel to the game would be released on the Virtual Console titled Blaster Master: Destination Fred. According to their press release, the game was only purported to be tested on several PlayChoice-10 machines in the Los Angeles area between 1988 and 1989. Upon discovery of copies {{of the game in}} Sunsoft's headquarters in Japan, Gaijinworks' founder Victor Ireland said: [...] "I was blown away when I saw these. When I was going through boxes of stored code, promotional items, and ROMs to see what we had on hand to release for the U.S. Virtual Console market, finding these nine completely unknown cartridges literally stunned me. I <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be put up on the Virtual Console as fast as we could make it happen." ...|$|E

500|$|Anna Popplewell as Susan Pevensie, {{the second}} oldest Pevensie. Popplewell had been {{disappointed}} she barely used her {{bow and arrow}} in the first film. Adamson convinced Douglas Gresham to have her present during the battles by suggesting her passive role in the novel indicated Lewis' view of women before he met Joy Gresham. [...] "I think [...] cast women down in the earlier books, {{but when you look}} at The Horse and His Boy, it has a strong female character. Doug's mother was a strong woman." [...] Adamson also chose to have her fall for Caspian, because [...] "The kids are growing up. If you look at Ben and you look at Anna, it seems really implausible that they wouldn't have some feelings for each other." [...] He <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be [...] "sensitively handled" [...] though, and ultimately it is not about romance, but [...] " [...] the fact that you can have a wondrous experience, enjoy it and move on". Popplewell added that it would not make sense for the Narnians not to use Susan, a talented archer, in battle, and that the romance contributed to her character's reconciliation with losing Narnia in the first place.|$|E
2500|$|The ongoing {{fight between}} the Teamsters and UFW {{and its effect}} on UFW's {{organizational}} viability led César Chávez to seriously consider and advocate for legal reform in 1974.

2500|$|With 3:35 left to play, Iowa {{attempted}} a trick play – an attempted flanker pass that has posed problems for Texas all season. [...] Safety Marcus Griffin stuffed the play for an 11-yard loss. [...] Commenting on stopping the trick play, Griffin said, [...] "I {{knew it was}} coming – we'd been beaten by that play in the last 10 games. We <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> come, I guess that was the best time for it." [...] Iowa coach Kirk Ferentz described the call as [...] "totally my fault.

5000|$|Ibn al-'Arabi {{wrote on}} many other subjects. For instance, he {{wrote on the}} mistreatment and disciplining of women. He once wrote, [...] "The former slaves need to be disciplined with a stick, while the latter man will not need more than an indication. Among women and even men, {{there are those who}} will behave well only through {{correction}} (adab). Any man who <b>knows</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> resort to discipline wife, although it is preferable if he abstains from it." [...] However, it seems that Ibn al-'Arabi was more focused on trying to express [...] "beating in a non violent way." [...] He believed that this is the [...] "only way allowed by the divine revelation," [...] because the objective of beating in a non violent way was ultimately to improve the wife's behavior.|$|R

2500|$|The KSČ's number-two leader, General Secretary Rudolf Slánský, {{represented}} the KSČ at the meeting. [...] He returned to Prague {{with a plan}} for the final seizure of power. Slánský remarked, [...] "as in the international field, we have gone on the offensive on the domestic front as well." [...] The KSČ pursued a two-pronged strategy. The party <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> maintain the façade of working within the electoral political system and was aware that a revolutionary coup would be unacceptable. It desired to gain an absolute majority at elections scheduled for 1948, but the fracturing of the left-wing coalition made this unrealistic. This pushed the party into extra-parliamentary action. The organization of [...] "spontaneous" [...] demonstrations to [...] "express the will of the people" [...] and continuous visits to parliament by workers' delegations were meant to ensure [...] "mobilization of the masses".|$|E
2500|$|One {{example of}} the gradual change that typifies {{evolution}} of the common law is the gradual change in liability for negligence. The traditional common law rule {{through most of the}} 19th century was that a plaintiff could not recover for a defendant's negligent production or distribution of a harmful instrumentality unless the two were in privity of contract. Thus, only the immediate purchaser could recover for a product defect, and if a part was built up out of parts from parts manufacturers, the ultimate buyer could not recover for injury caused by a defect in the part. In an 1842 English case, Winterbottom v. Wright, the postal service had contracted with Wright to maintain its coaches. Winterbottom was a driver for the post. When the coach failed and injured Winterbottom, he sued Wright. The Winterbottom court recognized that there would be [...] "absurd and outrageous consequences" [...] if an injured person could sue any person peripherally involved, and <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> draw a line somewhere, a limit on the causal connection between the negligent conduct and the injury. The court looked to the contractual relationships, and held that liability would only flow as far as the person in immediate contract ("privity") with the negligent party.|$|E

60|$|When he got {{beyond the}} light {{he turned and}} went back to a {{position}} where in the dark he could watch without being seen. His father and the hotel proprietor were again engaged in earnest colloquy. Neuman had disappeared. Kurt saw the huge shadow of a man pass across a drawn blind in a room up-stairs. Then he saw smaller shadows, and arms raised in vehement gesticulation. The very shadows were sinister. Men passed {{in and out of the}} hotel. Once old Dorn came to the door and peered all around. Kurt observed that there was a dark side entrance to this hotel. Presently Neuman returned to the desk and said something to old Dorn, who shook his head emphatically, and then threw himself into a chair, in a brooding posture that Kurt knew well. He had seen it so often that he <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> do with money. His father was refusing demands of some kind. Neuman again left the office, this time with the proprietor. They were absent some little time.|$|E
