In order to verify the reasonability of equipment structural design, a test system of structural strength is needed to make structural test. To this end, a strength test system is developed.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a theoretical and experimental investigation into an active vibration isolation system. Electromagnetic actuators are installed {{in parallel with}} each of four passive mounts, which are placed between a flexible <b>equipment</b> <b>structure</b> and a base structure which is either flexible or rigid. Isolation of low-frequency vibration is studied, so that the passive mounts can be modelled as lumped parameter springs and dampers. Decentralized velocity feedback control is employed, where each actuator is operated independently by feeding back the absolute equipment velocity at the same location. Good control and robust stability have been obtained both theoretically and experimentally for the multichannel control systems. This {{is to be expected}} if the base structure is rigid, in which case the actuator and sensor are, in principle, collocated and the control system implements a skyhook damper. With a flexible base structure, however, collocation is lost due to the reactive actuator force acting on the base structure, but the control system is still found to be robustly stable and to perform well. Attenuations of 20 dB are obtained in the sum of squared velocities on the <b>equipment</b> <b>structure</b> at the rigid-body mounted resonance frequencies. In addition, attenuations of up to 15 dB are obtained at the resonance frequencies of both the low order flexible modes of the base structure and the <b>equipment</b> <b>structure...</b>|$|E
