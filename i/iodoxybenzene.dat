Organic Positive Iodine Compounds Electrochemical characteristics. [...] Organic positive iodine compounds {{have long been}} recognized as strong oxidizing agents. For example, both iodoso compounds (RIO) and iodoxy compounds (RIOt) react quantitat ively with iodides in acid solution to yield the parent iodo compound and free iodine (1).
