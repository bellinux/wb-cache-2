Thermal interactions have been investigated with thermocouples coupled with infrared thermography. For safe operation up to 30 W heating power (10 W/slice), while thermal diffusion through the bare metallic substrate is sufficient for heat transfer from chip to the substrate, micro heat pipes should be employed to cool the substrate and transfer heat from it to an external cold plate. Flat plate heat pipes are advantageous for higher power levels per slice. Interlayer thermal interactions also affect the response of stacked 3 D packages...|$|R

The DNW buried inside the epitaxial layer intensifies the electric field {{deep inside the}} epi-layer significantly, and helps the electrons generated inside the epi-layer to drift faster to the cathode. Therefore, this new structure reduces the carrier transit time and enhances the PD bandwidth. A PD with an area of 70 70 m 2 fabricated in a 0. 18 - m epi-CMOS achieves 3 -dB bandwidth of 3. 1 GHz in the small signal and 2. 6 GHz in the large signal, both with a 15 -V bias voltage and 850 -nm optical illumination.

It was demonstrated that the residual stress in SOS film, arising from mismatch and difference of thermal expansion coefficient between silicon and sapphire, was reduced efficiently by SPE process, and that the stress in Si/gamma-Al 2 O 3 /Si thin film is much smaller than that of as-grown SOS and SPE upgraded SOS films. The stress decrease for double heteroepitaxial film Si/gamma-Al 2 O 3 /Si mainly arises from the smaller lattice mismatching of 2. 4 % between silicon top layer and the gamma-Al 2 O 3 /Si epitaxiial composite substrate, comparing with the large lattice mismatch of 13 % for SOS films.

40|$|Abstruct-Characterization and {{simulation}} of minority-carrier well-type guard rings in <b>epitaxial</b> <b>substrate</b> at 77 K were per-formed and {{compared with those}} at RT. The escape probability in a narrow guard-ring structure under {{the same amount of}} minority carrier injection increases by about one order of mag-nitude when temperature decreases to 77 K. This degradation in the guard-ring efficiency {{can be attributed to the}} enhanced drift mechanism in the conductivity-modulated layer between the well bottom junction and the epitaxial highnow junction at 77 K. In contrast, this mechanism enhances the width dependence of the escape probability at 77 K. The higher minority-carrier recombination velocity of the epitaxial high-low junction con-tributes to the stronger width dependence secondarily. When the epitaxial layer thickness becomes thinner, the simulation also demonstrates a stronger width dependence of the escape current as well as a reduction in its magnitude. A lightly-doped epitaxial layer on a heavily-doped substrate exhibits even more importance in the guard ring efficiency for low temperature operation, and its thickness should be kept as thin as possible.

To extend the applications of such heterogeneous nano-cathodes in real devices, also the STO support should be active for both electron transport and oxide diffusion.

These two ions fit in the perovskite structure and induce holes in the STO valence band, so as to obtain the desired p-type electronic conduction. At the same time, the doping with alkali ions also promotes the formation of oxygen vacancies in STO, a prerequisite for effective oxide diffusion. Analysis of electron density rearrangements upon defect formation allows relating the favorable vacancy formation energies to an improved electronic delocalization over the oxide sub-lattice, as observed in closely related materials (e. g.
