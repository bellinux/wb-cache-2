When Thomas first viewed the scene with his wife, she emitted an audible <b>groan</b> when she saw Logan walking through the cafeteria towards Piz, anticipating the fight {{that was about to}} come. Thomas thought that most fight scenes on the show were not well-done, as they are filmed quickly and without a second unit. However, he was pleased with the final cut, stating that there was only one punch that he thought looked fake.|$|E
5|$|This rockfowl usually lives either {{alone or}} in pairs, {{although}} small flocks of three to ten birds are not uncommon. It normally moves through its habitat {{in a series of}} runs and long, springing hops on the ground and in low branches. It uses its tail for balance while hopping and running. When in a flock, rockfowl hop almost in unison. In the unusual occurrences when the species does fly, it is fast and is capable of navigating through the trees and rocks well. When it is standing still, the rockfowl has its tail down and its head looking up. Typically, it silently evades any unusual movements in their forest. However, if these birds know that they have been sighted, they can become quite inquisitive and occasionally approach observers. This is not a shy species once it knows that it has been seen, and often studies things of interest, including humans, from an open location. When this species is suspicious, it raises the small crown on its head and the ruff on its neck while uttering a muffled <b>groan.</b> It is most active in the early morning and late evening, and from 10:30 am to 7:00 pm remains perched with little activity either in liana-tangled areas or in caves away from the nests. To scratch its head, the species lifts its foot over its head. It bathes in small pools. While its lifespan in the wild is unknown, it has lived up to 25 years in captivity.|$|E

25|$|An {{unsuccessful}} {{attempt on}} the life of the king was made on 15 November 1620. It occurred on Sunday, at 9 am, when the monarch was to attend Mass in St. John's Archcathedral in Warsaw. Sigismund was to arrive by walking on a wooden bridge-looking construction that connected the Royal Castle with the temple. When the royal procession already {{reached the end of the}} bridge, hidden in a nearby window was nobleman Michał Piekarski. The assassin previously killed a Hungarian mercenary that was protecting the post. When the monarch reached the final steps, Piekarski instantly jumped out and threw himself on the king, stabbing him twice, firstly in the back and then in the cheek, and striking him in the arm. However, the assassin was not able to cause any deadly harm because of the royal guards that were initially standing to the right of the king as Piekarski attacked from the left. Shortly after the attack, Sigismund fell flat on the ground, pale and lifeless, and from the church Priest Kobierzycki started to <b>groan</b> and shout – he had seen the attack from the temple's stained glass window or from the belfry. A group of local civilians and citizens surrounded the procession, the king quickly fainted, and his clothes were stained in blood. The guards were able to revive the monarch, and after medical examinations the wounds proved to be harmless. A few minutes later, panic erupted in the crowd and the air filled with the atmosphere of terror. Most of the people gathered in the church, who had arrived before the royal procession, believed that the king was already dead. Initially it was thought that the capital was invaded by the Muslim Tatars or, at least, by their spies.|$|E
40|$|We {{studied the}} {{short-term}} vocalization rates of fallow bucks {{to determine the}} primary recipients of the signal conveyed by these rates. We used the contexts in which <b>groans</b> occurred to investigate whether the signal represented an intrasexual threat or an intersexual advertisement. We found that fallow buck <b>groaning</b> rates were highly variable and that this variation {{was associated with the}} contexts of <b>groaning.</b> <b>Groaning</b> rates were higher during the rut than during the prerut, and also higher when males were with females than when they were with other males. Males with females <b>groaned</b> at higher rates when other vocal males were nearby. We identified a postcopulation call that consisted of the highest <b>groaning</b> rates that males produced. The presence of a harem did not contribute to the variation in <b>groaning</b> rates, except to a minor extent in postcopulation rates. Our findings suggest that the signal transmitted by short-term vocalization rates is primarily a threat aimed at other males. Copyright 1999 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour...|$|R

It was said to have reached an angle of 30–45degrees, [...] "revolving {{apparently}} around a centre of gravity just astern of midships," [...] as Lawrence Beesley later put it. Many survivors described a great noise, which some attributed to the boilers exploding. Beesley described it as [...] "partly a <b>groan,</b> partly a rattle, and partly a smash, and it was not a sudden roar as an explosion would be: it went on successively for some seconds, possibly fifteen to twenty". He attributed it to [...] "the engines and machinery coming loose from their bolts and bearings, and falling through the compartments, smashing everything in their way".|$|E

500|$|The {{building}} committee's document {{specified that}} the new library should be [...] "unpretentious, though in a handsome, inviting contemporary style". Kahn accordingly made the building's exterior relatively undramatic, suitable for a small New England town. [...] Its facade is primarily brick with teak wood panels at most windows marking {{the location of a}} pair of wooden carrels. [...] The bricks are load-bearing; that is, the weight of the outer portion of the building is carried by the bricks themselves, not by a hidden steel frame. [...] Kahn calls this fact to the viewer's attention by making the brick piers noticeably thicker at the bottom where they have more weight to bear. [...] The windows are correspondingly wider toward the top where the piers are thinner. [...] Kahn said, [...] "The weight of the brick makes it dance like a fairy above and <b>groan</b> below." ...|$|E
500|$|English {{has long}} been entrenched as a de facto {{national}} language due to its widespread use. In the 2013 census, 96.1percent of respondents spoke English. The New Zealand English dialect is mostly non-rhotic with an exception being the Southern Burr found principally in Southland and parts of Otago. It is similar to Australian English and many speakers from the Northern Hemisphere are unable to tell the accents apart. In New Zealand English the short i (as in kit) has become centralised, leading to the phrase fish and chips sounding like [...] "fush and chups" [...] to the Australian ear. The words rarely and really, reel and real, doll and dole, pull and pool, witch and which, and full and fill can sometimes be pronounced as homophones. Some New Zealanders pronounce the past participles grown, thrown and mown using two syllables, whereas <b>groan,</b> throne and moan are pronounced as one syllable. New Zealanders often reply to a question or emphasise a point by adding a rising intonation {{at the end of}} the sentence.|$|E

500|$|In {{one of the}} few {{contemporaneous}} accounts, the Toledo Blade {{wrote that}} the Penn players, knowing that Schulz was [...] "the power in the Michigan game", focused their energy on wearing him down. [...] There were two Penn players who [...] "did nothing but look after Schultz". [...] And they did more than look: [...] "In every scrimmage, he was bumped as hard as the rules allowed, and maybe a little harder, when nobody was looking.... Every time Schultz started anywhere he would find a couple of Penn men digging headfirst into his stomach. [...] They would elbow him, jam him with the straight arm, and if he went to the ground in a scrimmage there generally would be a knee grinding him in the wind. [...] Pretty soon Schultz began to show it.... He limped along pitifully. [...] He couldn't run. [...] His strength was almost gone. [...] When he did tackle, his <b>groan</b> of pain could almost be heard in the stands". [...] But the fans continued to urge Schulz with yells of [...] "G-r-r-r-r-rah, Schultz!" [...] Schulz buckled down and continued to play, and the pummeling continued.|$|E
500|$|Richard Corliss of Time magazine, {{considered}} the film a [...] "by the numbers adaptation," [...] criticising {{the pace and}} the [...] "charisma-free" [...] lead actors. CNN's Paul Tatara found that Columbus and Kloves [...] "are so careful to avoid offending anyone by excising a passage from the book, the so-called narrative {{is more like a}} jamboree inside Rowling's head." [...] Nathaniel Rogers of The Film Experience gave the film a negative review and wrote: [...] "Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone is as bland as movies can get." [...] Ed Gonzalez of Slant Magazine wished that the film had been directed by Tim Burton, finding the cinematography [...] "bland and muggy," [...] and the majority of the film a [...] "solidly dull celebration of dribbling goo." [...] Elvis Mitchell of The New York Times was highly negative about the film, saying [...] " [...] is like a theme park that's a few years past its prime; the rides clatter and <b>groan</b> with metal fatigue every time they take a curve." [...] He also said it suffered from [...] "a lack of imagination" [...] and wooden characters, adding, [...] "The Sorting Hat has more personality than anything else in the movie." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{isolation}} {{from the rest of}} the episode, many critics were baffled by the drastic changes to the Dorne storyline. [...] For io9, Charlie Jane Anders called it [...] "the absolute worst" [...] part of the episode, and criticized the Dorne storyline in general for giving Doran Martell [...] "a grand total of ten minutes' screentime" [...] before suddenly killing him off, given that he is alive in the novels and his major subplot from the books - that he was simply feigning a desire for peace while planning to betray the Lannisters - was not introduced at all before his departure. Alan Sepinwall from HitFix also disliked the Dorne scenes and summarized, [...] "I'll settle for not needing to audibly <b>groan</b> every time the story returns to Dorne, frankly." [...] For Vulture, Nate Jones wrote an op-ed piece specifically criticizing the Dorne storyline in seasons five and six, culminating in the changes in the season six premiere, which it felt to be bizarre and illogical - purely relying on shock value when the characters' actions don't make sense upon closer analysis. [...] Jones was also critical of how it was altering the female characters in Dorne, saying that they were changed from the novels to be [...] "the kind of violent, scantily clad women that emerge when creators want to pay lip service to feminism, but don't have the time or inclination to create actual three-dimensional female characters." ...|$|E
