Lymph node swelling is rare in AML, in contrast to acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The skin is involved about 10% {{of the time in}} the form of leukemia cutis. Rarely, Sweet's syndrome, a paraneoplastic inflammation of the skin, can occur with AML.|$|E
5|$|In 1717, {{the dark}} {{pigmentation}} of a postmortem spleen and brain {{was published by}} the epidemiologist Giovanni Maria Lancisi in his malaria text book De noxiis paludum effluviis eorumque remediis. This {{was one of the}} earliest reports of the characteristic <b>enlargement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spleen</b> and dark color of the spleen and brain which are the most constant post-mortem indications of chronic malaria infection. He related the prevalence of malaria in swampy areas to the presence of flies and recommended swamp drainage to prevent it.|$|E
5|$|Liver {{disease may}} present itself as tiredness, {{increased}} bleeding tendency or confusion (due to hepatic encephalopathy) and portal hypertension. The latter, {{a condition in}} which the pressure in the portal vein is markedly increased, leads to esophageal varices, blood vessels in the esophagus that may bleed in a life-threatening fashion, as well as <b>enlargement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spleen</b> (splenomegaly) and accumulation of fluid in the abdominal cavity (ascites). On examination, signs of chronic liver disease such as spider angiomata (small distended blood vessels, usually on the chest) may be observed. Chronic active hepatitis has caused cirrhosis of the liver in most by the time they develop symptoms. While most people with cirrhosis have an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer), this risk is relatively very low in Wilson's disease.|$|E
25|$|Splenic {{sequestration}} crises are acute, painful <b>enlargements</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spleen,</b> {{caused by}} intrasplenic trapping of red cells and {{resulting in a}} precipitous fall in haemoglobin levels {{with the potential for}} hypovolemic shock. Sequestration crises are considered an emergency. If not treated, patients may die within 1–2 hours due to circulatory failure. Management is supportive, sometimes with blood transfusion. These crises are transient, they continue for 3–4 hours and may last for one day.|$|R

25|$|Enlarged spleen: The spleen aids in {{fighting}} infection and filters unwanted material, such as old or damaged blood cells. Thalassemia is {{often accompanied by}} {{the destruction of a}} large number of red blood cells and the task of removing these cells causes the spleen to enlarge. Splenomegaly can make anemia worse, and it can reduce the life of transfused red blood cells. Severe <b>enlargement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spleen</b> may necessitate its removal.|$|E
25|$|Ultrasound is {{routinely}} {{used in the}} evaluation of cirrhosis. It may show a small and nodular liver in advanced cirrhosis along with increased echogenicity with irregular appearing areas. Other liver findings suggestive of cirrhosis in imaging are an enlarged caudate lobe, widening of the fissures and <b>enlargement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spleen.</b> An enlarged spleen (splenomegaly), which normally measures less than 11–12cm in adults, is suggestive of cirrhosis with portal hypertension, in the right clinical context. Ultrasound may also screen for hepatocellular carcinoma, portal hypertension, and Budd-Chiari syndrome (by assessing flow in the hepatic vein).|$|E
25|$|When people develop visceral leishmaniasis, {{the most}} typical {{symptoms}} are fever and the <b>enlargement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spleen,</b> with {{enlargement of the}} liver sometimes being seen as well. The blackening of the skin that gave the disease its common name in India {{does not appear in}} most strains of the disease, and the other symptoms are very easy to mistake for those of malaria. Misdiagnosis is dangerous, as without proper treatment the mortality rate for kala-azar is close to 100%. L. donovani itself is not usually the direct cause of death in kala-azar sufferers, however. Pneumonia, tuberculosis, and dysentery are omnipresent in the depressed regions where leishmaniasis thrives, and, as with AIDS, it is these opportunistic infections that are more likely to kill, flaring up in a host whose immune system has been weakened by the L. donovani infection. Progress of the disease is extremely variable, taking anywhere from one to twenty weeks, but a typical duration for the Sudanese strain of the disease is narrower, between twelve and sixteen weeks.|$|E
