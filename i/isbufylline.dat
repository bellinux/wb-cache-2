40|$|The {{pharmacological}} {{actions of}} the new xanthine, <b>isbufylline,</b> were evaluated in several models of airway hyperresponsiveness and airway inflammation in guinea pigs. At a dose (106 umol/kg i. p.) providing complete protection against acetylcholine aerosol-induced dyspnea in the guinea pig, <b>isbufylline</b> inhibited platelet activating factor (PAF) - and antigen-induced eosinophil infiltration into bronchoalveolar lavage fluid 24 h after challenge of normal and actively immunized guinea pigs, respectively. In addition, this dose of <b>isbufylline</b> also inhibited capsaicin-induced extravasation of protein into bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. <b>Isbufylline,</b> 4. 2 umol/ kg i. v., significantly inhibited PAF-induced bronchial hyper-responsiveness to i. v. histamine, without exerting evident bronchodilator activity. On the other hand the bronchodilator, salbutamol, at a dose (10. 4 umol kg i. p.) shown to be equieffective to <b>isbufylline</b> (106 umol/kg i. p.) for blocking acetylcholine aerosol-induced dyspnea, had no protective action against PAF- or antigen-induced eosinophil recruitment in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, or against capsaicin-induced plasma protein extravasation. Furthermore, salbutamol (3. 5 umol/kg) significantly potentiated allergen-induced cell infiltration and PAF-induced bronchial hyperresponsiveness. The results suggest that <b>isbufylline</b> can exert significant anti-inflammatory actions in guinea pig airways, {{in addition to its}} bronchodilator activity. These pharmacological activities are not shared by the beta 2 -adrenoceptor agonist, salbutamol...|$|E
40|$|<b>Isbufylline</b> {{metabolism}} after {{oral administration}} to humans was stud-led. The main metaboiftes detected by the HPLC method, in plasma, were 1 -methyl- 7 -(2 -hydroxy- 2 -methyl-propyl) xanthine (I), 1, 3 -di-methyl- 7 -(2 -hydroxy- 2 -methyl-propyl) xanthine (II), and 1 -methyl- 7 -(2 -methyl-propyl) xanthine (Ill). The main metabolites detected in urine were 1 -methyl- 7 -(2 -hydroxy- 2 -methyl-propyl) xanthine (I), 1, 3 -dlmethyl- 7 -(2 -carboxy-propyl) xanthine (IV), and 1, 3 -dlmethyl- 7 -(2 -hydroxymethyl-propyl) xanthlne glucuronic acid (V) -GIuc. They were Isolated by HPLC, identified by GC/MS, HPLC/MS, or HPLC/MS/MS, and finally synthesized. Recovery of these metabolites, {{along with the}} absence of unmetabolized <b>isbufylline</b> in the urine, indicated biotransformation and renal excretion as the main routes of isbufyl-line elimination in humans. HPLC quantitation of the characterized urine metabolites revealed that 49 % of the drug was eliminated a...|$|E
