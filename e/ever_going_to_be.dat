There would be significant pressure on the ACB to ban the players, so they decided to cover up the matter. Board member Cam Battersby said, [...] "The only way he [...] was <b>ever</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> convicted was if our evidence was credible... Revealing the information...would provide an excuse for Pakistan to do nothing". The ACB prepared a press release in case the matter was leaked.

500|$|The soundtrack for Monaco was {{composed}} by Grammy-nominated Austin Wintory, {{who had previously}} worked as the composer for games such as flOw and Journey. The original soundtrack and a remixed album called Gentleman's Private Collection were released on April 24, 2013. The soundtrack incorporates pianos and drums into what Christian Donlan (Eurogamer) thought was one of Wintory's best works yet. The Gentleman's Private Collection contains remixes of the original soundtrack by other notable composers, including Peter Hollens, Tina Guo who played the violin in the Journey soundtrack, and Chipzel who composed the soundtrack for Super Hexagon. When Wintory was approached by Schatz, he was excited by the request because it involved using humorous [...] "old-timey piano". [...] "When else am I <b>ever</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> asked to write anything remotely like this?", he exclaimed. Schatz originally wanted to use licensed music thinking that the project {{was too small to}} warrant its own soundtrack, but after discussions, Wintory persuaded him that an original soundtrack was warranted. The full soundtrack and Gentleman's Private Collection were released onto Wintory's Bandcamp microsite.|$|E
500|$|Rater {{noted that}} the balance Meredith had just found in her life, finally having a chance at {{happiness}} with the man she loves, is shaken by her mother's unexpected lucidity, which was stated to have been written in the series in order to remind Meredith about the troubled years of her growing up: [...] "If Meredith is <b>ever</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> happy, she's {{got to deal with}} the fact that she had a really terrible childhood." [...] In addition, Rater explained that Ellis' [...] "awful, raw, ugly and terrible" [...] statements towards her daughter were intended to make everyone realize the reason behind Meredith's alcoholism in college and her continuous one-night stands with inappropriate men. She also deemed Pompeo's performance in the episode [...] "exceptional", describing what she regarded an [...] "exceptional moment" [...] which sees Meredith stand up to her mother. In response to the scene that sees Ellis interacting with Webber, Rater wrote that it is the first time she lets her guard down, exposing the previously hidden vulnerability, which allows her express the desire to be as happy and ordinary as her daughter. She also praised the performances of the cast, by deeming their acting [...] "remarkable". [...] "That is really what it's all about. We have to cherish the time that we have here, and love the people who surround and support us, even if they make us crazy, because things happen. Brain surgery, Alzheimer's and weddings. And the worst thing is to come to the end of your life, and realize, like Ellis, that you should have tried harder", stated Rater, putting the emphasis on the main aspects of the episode, characterizing it as [...] "not ordinary".|$|E

[...] "It was frightening: {{we played a}} college in Santa Barbara, and {{there were all these}} blond people crowding the stage, and I thought 'These are the people who hated me in high school!' When you grow up being 'outside' – because I wasn't white, and I was fat, and always a bit of a free thinker – it was strange. It was like, 'uh-oh, I must be doing something wrong – they like me!'" [...] Highly successful mainstream artists like Ann Wilson and Ric Ocasek were eager to meet the band. Ocasek extended an invitation to collaborate at his Synchro Sound studio in Boston. The recording sessions in Boston resulted in the Never Say Never EP in January 1982. The title track became (arguably) their best-known song and has remained synonymous with the band ever since. The song was also featured in the 1984 romantic teen drama Reckless. Additionally, the success of the single directly led to 415 Records signing a deal with Columbia Records, which elevated the indie label's roster to major-label status. Romeo Void released their second album, entitled Benefactor, in November 1982. The album appeared at No.119 on the Billboard 200. Benefactor was noticeably more commercial sounding than previous endeavors; the music was made more danceable and swearing was removed on the song [...] "Never Say Never". The different approach in the sound resulted in comparisons to Blondie, which Allmusic writer William Ruhlmann suggested was a deliberate attempt by Columbia. Iyall stated that there was more pressure to write sexually laced lyrics for Benefactor: [...] "I do like to be provocative, and I definitely have access to my sexuality, and as a topic I find it ripe, but I wasn't <b>ever</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a sex-pot diva, so that was kind of odd." [...] She also said there was pressure to produce more singles.|$|E

Louis VII answered by raiding the Norman Vexin, forcing Henry II to move his troops north, giving Louis the opportunity to free Bourges.
