500|$|The {{house sparrow}} can be {{confused}} {{with a number of}} other seed-eating birds, especially its relatives in the genus Passer. Many of these relatives are smaller, with an appearance that is neater or [...] "cuter", as with the Dead Sea sparrow. The dull-coloured female can often not be distinguished from other females, and is nearly identical to those of the Spanish and Italian sparrows. The Eurasian tree sparrow is smaller and more slender with a chestnut crown and a black patch on each cheek. The male Spanish sparrow and <b>Italian</b> <b>sparrow</b> are distinguished by their chestnut crowns. The Sind sparrow is very similar but smaller, with less black on the male's throat and a distinct pale supercilium on the female.|$|E
6000|$|Of very {{restricted}} continental ranges {{the best}} examples in Europe are, the little blue magpie (Cyanopica cooki) confined to the central portions of the Spanish peninsula; and the <b>Italian</b> <b>sparrow</b> found only in Italy and Corsica. {16} In Asia, Palestine affords some examples of birds of very restricted range--a beautiful sun-bird (Nectarinea osea) a peculiar starling (Amydrus tristramii) and some others, being almost or quite confined to the warmer portions of {{the valley of the}} Jordan. In the Himalayas there are numbers of birds which have very restricted ranges, but those of the Neilgherries are perhaps better known, several species of laughing thrushes and some other birds being found only on the summits of these mountains. The most wonderfully restricted ranges are, however, to be found among the humming-birds of tropical America. The great volcanic peaks of Chimborazo and Pichincha have each a peculiar species of humming-bird confined to a belt just below the limits of perpetual snow, while the extinct volcano of Chiriqui in Veragua has a species confined to its wooded crater. One of the most strange and beautiful of the humming-birds (Loddigesia mirabilis) was obtained once only, more than forty years ago, near Chachapoyas in the Andes of northern Peru; and though Mr. Gould sent many drawings of the bird to people visiting the district and for many years offered a high reward for a specimen, no other has ever been seen![4] ...|$|E

A breeding population in the Eastern Ghats of India, said to be introduced, may also hybridise with house sparrows. On at least one occasion a mixed pair has resulted in fertile young.

5|$|When the Eurasian {{tree sparrow}} {{and the larger}} house sparrow occur in the same area, the house sparrow {{generally}} breeds in urban areas while the smaller Eurasian tree sparrow nests in the countryside. Where trees are in short supply, as in Mongolia, both species may utilise man-made structures as nest sites. The Eurasian tree sparrow is rural in Europe, but is an urban bird in eastern Asia; in southern and central Asia, both Passer species may be found around towns and villages. In parts of the Mediterranean, such as Italy, both the tree and the <b>Italian</b> or Spanish <b>sparrows</b> {{may be found in}} settlements. In Australia, the Eurasian tree sparrow is largely an urban bird, and it is the house sparrow which utilises more natural habitats.|$|R

40|$|A {{stabilized}} hybrid form of {{the house}} sparrow (Passer domesticus) and the Spanish sparrow (P.  hispaniolensis) is known as Passer italiae from the Italian Peninsula and a few Mediterranean islands. The growing attention for the <b>Italian</b> hybrid <b>sparrow</b> and increasing knowledge on its biology and genetic constitution greatly contrast the complete {{lack of knowledge of}} the long-known phenotypical hybrid sparrow populations from North Africa. Our study provides new data on the breeding biology and variation of mitochondrial DNA in three Algerian populations of house sparrows, Spanish sparrows, and phenotypical hybrids. In two field seasons, the two species occupied different breeding habitats: Spanish sparrows were only found in rural areas outside the cities and bred in open-cup nests built in large jujube bushes. In contrast, house sparrows bred only in the town centers and occupied nesting holes in walls of buildings. Phenotypical hybrids were always associated with house sparrow populations. House sparrows and phenotypical hybrids started breeding mid of March, and most pairs had three successive clutches, whereas Spanish sparrows started breeding almost one month later and had only two successive clutches. Mitochondrial introgression is strongly asymmetric because about 75 % of the rural Spanish sparrow population carried house sparrow haplotypes. In contrast, populations of the Italian hybrid form, P.  italiae, were genetically least diverse among all study populations and showed a near-fixation of house sparrow haplotypes that elsewhere were extremely rare or that were even unique for the Italian Peninsula. Such differences between mitochondrial gene pools of Italian and North African hybrid sparrow populations provide first evidence that different demographic histories have shaped the extant genetic diversity observed on both continents...|$|R

50|$|In much of Italy, a form {{apparently}} intermediate {{between the}} house and Spanish sparrows, is known as the <b>Italian</b> <b>sparrow.</b> It resembles a hybrid between the two species, and is in other respects intermediate. Its specific status and origin are the subject of much debate. In the Alps, the <b>Italian</b> <b>sparrow</b> intergrades over a roughly 20 km strip with the house sparrow, but to the south it intergrades over the southern half of Italy and some Mediterranean islands with the Spanish sparrow.

50|$|The taxonomic {{status of}} the <b>Italian</b> <b>sparrow</b> has {{been a matter of}} debate. It has been {{variously}} regarded as a stable hybrid between the house sparrow and Spanish sparrow, or as a subspecies of either the house or Spanish sparrow. Many authorities, including the Handbook of the Birds of the World, recognise it as a separate species, if only for convenience. Others, including many conservation groups, consider the <b>Italian</b> <b>sparrow</b> a simple hybrid and ignore it. The chromosomes of Italian sparrows are distinct from those of the house sparrow, but mitochondrial DNA suggest a close relation to the house sparrow.|$|E
50|$|There {{has been}} much debate on the origins and taxonomic status of the <b>Italian</b> <b>sparrow,</b> {{especially}} given its possible hybrid origin. Some have classified it as a subspecies of house sparrow, a subspecies of the Spanish sparrow, or as a distinct species, a treatment followed if only for convenience by authorities such as the Handbook of the Birds of the World. A DNA analysis by Glenn-Peter Sætre and colleagues published in 2011 indicated an origin of the <b>Italian</b> <b>sparrow</b> through hybridisation between the Spanish and house sparrows, and Sætre and colleagues argued that given its origins and the limited extent of hybridisation, the treatment as a distinct species was supported.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Italian</b> <b>sparrow</b> (Passer italiae), {{also known}} as the cisalpine sparrow, is a {{passerine}} bird of the sparrow family Passeridae, found in Italy {{and other parts of the}} Mediterranean region. In appearance, it is intermediate between the house sparrow, and the Spanish sparrow, a species of the Mediterranean and Central Asia closely related to the house sparrow. The <b>Italian</b> <b>sparrow</b> occurs in northern Italy and neighbouring regions, with intermediates with the house sparrow in a very narrow contact zone in the Alps, a slow gradation in appearance from the Italian to Spanish sparrows across central and southern Italy, and more birds of intermediate appearance in Malta, Crete, and other parts of the Mediterranean.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Italian</b> <b>sparrow</b> is {{associated}} with human habitations, inhabiting towns, cities, and agricultural areas. In most cities in Italy, it shares the urban environment with the Eurasian tree sparrow, and {{in some parts of}} Naples, it is replaced entirely by this species.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Italian</b> <b>sparrow</b> {{is about}} {{the same size as the}} house sparrow at 14 - 16 cm in length. The tail is 5.3 - 6 cm, the tarsus 18.6 - 21 mm, and wing lengths for males are 7.3 - 8.2 cm. The Italian sparrow's weight varies {{seasonally}} from 30 g in the winter to 26 g in the summer.|$|E
5000|$|The Spanish sparrow {{was first}} {{described}} by the Dutch zoologist Coenraad Jacob Temminck as Fringilla hispaniolensis, from a specimen collected at Algeciras, in southern Spain. The usual English name refers to {{the description of the}} species from Spain. The name willow sparrow, referring to the moist habitat of this bird, is sometimes used, especially when the <b>Italian</b> <b>sparrow</b> is considered the same species. The genus name Passer is the Latin for sparrow, and hispaniolensis is New Latin for [...] "Spanish".|$|E
50|$|The <b>Italian</b> <b>sparrow</b> {{has been}} {{classified}} as a hybrid with the house sparrow, the same species as the Spanish sparrow, the same species as the house sparrow, and as a separate species. The Spanish sparrow also hybridises freely with house sparrow in parts of northern Africa (north-eastern Algeria, Tunisia, and north-western Libya), forming highly variable mixed populations with {{a full range of}} characters from pure house sparrow to pure Spanish sparrow. On the Mediterranean islands of Malta, Gozo, Crete, Rhodes, and Karpathos, there are more apparently intermediate birds of unknown status.|$|E
50|$|The vocalisations of the <b>Italian</b> <b>sparrow</b> {{are similar}} to those of both the Spanish sparrow and the house sparrow. Its vocalisations carry better in natural environments than those of the house sparrow. The male gives a chreep call like that of the Spanish sparrow to {{proclaim}} nest ownership, and a faster version of this as part of courtship display. Male song patterns grade slowly into those of the Spanish sparrow across southern Italy, but in the area of overlap between the house and Italian sparrows, the two birds sound alike.|$|E
5000|$|The Spanish sparrow {{is a close}} {{relative}} of the house sparrow in the genus Passer and the sparrow family Passeridae. Its taxonomy is greatly complicated by the [...] "biological mix-up" [...] it forms with the house sparrow in the Mediterranean. In most of the Mediterranean, {{one or both of}} the two species occurs, with only a limited degree of hybridisation. On the Italian Peninsula and Corsica, the two species are replaced by the <b>Italian</b> <b>sparrow,</b> a puzzling type of sparrow apparently intermediate between the Spanish sparrow and the house sparrow.|$|E
5000|$|Sardinia is {{occupied}} by Spanish sparrows, while sparrows on Malta, Crete, and the adjacent islands are intermediates similar to the <b>Italian</b> <b>sparrow.</b> On Malta, sparrows resemble the Spanish sparrow, with urban birds behaving much like the house sparrow, and rural birds like the Spanish sparrow. The situation is complicated by house and Spanish sparrows which winter and migrate on Malta. A more complex situation occurs in parts of northern Africa, where a highly variable mixed, interbreeding population of house sparrows and Spanish sparrows occurs. This [...] "hybrid swarm" [...] shows {{a full range of}} characters from nearly pure house sparrows to nearly pure Spanish sparrows and everything between.|$|E
5000|$|The {{house sparrow}} can be {{confused}} {{with a number of}} other seed-eating birds, especially its relatives in the genus Passer. Many of these relatives are smaller, with an appearance that is neater or [...] "cuter", as with the Dead Sea sparrow. The dull-coloured female can often not be distinguished from other females, and is nearly identical to those of the Spanish and Italian sparrows. The Eurasian tree sparrow is smaller and more slender with a chestnut crown and a black patch on each cheek. The male Spanish sparrow and <b>Italian</b> <b>sparrow</b> are distinguished by their chestnut crowns. The Sind sparrow is very similar but smaller, with less black on the male's throat and a distinct pale supercilium on the female.|$|E
50|$|A DNA {{analysis}} by Jo Hermansen, Glenn-Peter Sætre, {{and a group}} of other scientists from Norway published in Molecular Ecology in 2011 indicates that the <b>Italian</b> <b>sparrow</b> originated as a hybrid between house and Spanish sparrows. It has mitochondrial DNA from both parent species. Additionally, it is now breeding beside the Spanish sparrow without cross-breeding in areas where the species both occur. Although it hybridises with the house sparrow in a sparsely populated contact zone in the Alps, the contact zone is characterized by relatively abrupt changes in species-specific male plumage, suggesting that partial reproductive isolation based on plumage may also have developed between these two taxa. As a genetically distinct group that is reproductively isolated from the parental species, it must be recognised as a separate species, according to Hermansen and colleagues.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Italian</b> <b>sparrow</b> {{is a small}} chunky bird, with {{grey and}} brown plumage. The sexes differ in their plumage pattern, and {{slightly}} in length. The male has a head patterned {{like that of the}} Spanish sparrow, with a chestnut crown, nape and sides of head, and white cheeks. The male's upperparts are bright chestnut, and its underparts are pale grey, lacking the black streaking of the Spanish sparrow. The male has a black patch on its throat and chest, known as a bib or badge. This patch, like much of the male's plumage is dull in fresh non-breeding plumage and is brightened by wear and preening. The female is nearly identical to the female house sparrow, but it differs from the female Spanish sparrow in its lack of black streaks on the underparts. Albinism is occasionally recorded.|$|E
50|$|The Italian sparrow's {{breeding}} {{population is}} believed to comprise 5 to 10 million pairs, 750,000 to 900,000 of which are estimated to live in urban areas. It has a population density of 58 to 160 pairs per square kilometer. Up to the mid-1990s, its population increased steadily, probably due to increased urbanisation. Between 2000 and 2005, the Italian sparrow's population in Italy declined by 27.1 percent, mirroring the declines of the house sparrow throughout Europe. From 1998 to 2008, urban populations declined by about 50 percent. A study of the Italian sparrow's status listed {{a large number of}} potential causes for the Italian sparrow's decline, including shortages of insect food, agricultural intensification, and reductions of green areas. The <b>Italian</b> <b>sparrow</b> is among the most common birds in Italian cities, but other species, including the European goldfinch, are more common.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Italian</b> <b>sparrow</b> {{is found}} in {{northern}} and central Italy, Corsica, and small parts of France, Switzerland, Austria, and Slovenia. Its distribution was described by Italian zoologist Enrico Hillyer Giglioli in 1881 as professing [...] "'Conservative opinions'; for it keeps strictly within our current political frontiers". At the northernmost edge of its range in the southern Alps, there is a narrow hybrid zone about 20-30 km (12-20 mi) wide with the house sparrow. In southern Italy, there is a gradual clinal trend with the Spanish sparrow, with birds increasing in their similarity to the Spanish sparrow in appearance and ecology further south, from around Naples to western Sicily, where birds resemble pure Spanish sparrows. However, this trend may be superficial, and the Handbook of the Birds of the World recognises birds from Sicily and Crete as Italian sparrows.|$|E
5000|$|The western {{subspecies}} hispaniolensis breeds {{in parts}} of Iberia and North Africa, some islands, and the Balkans. In Iberia it is uncommon, occurring in the Tagus valley and sporadically in the northern meseta, the eastern coast, and in the Guadalquivir and Guadiana valleys. While the house sparrow and the Spanish sparrow form a [...] "hybrid swarm" [...] in {{the eastern half of}} the Maghreb, they coexist with little hybridisation in the western half. In northern Italy and Corsica the Spanish sparrow is replaced by the <b>Italian</b> <b>sparrow,</b> and the two intergrade in southern Italy, as well as Malta, Crete, and nearby islands such as Rhodes. The Spanish sparrow is not known to breed in the Balearic Islands, the Aegean Islands, Corfu, or the Peloponnese, but it occurs on Sardinia, Pantelleria, and smaller islands near the coast. In the Balkans, it occurs patchily from Montenegro across into the Danube valley of Romania and northern Serbia. It is found in mainland Greece and Bulgaria, where it is also uncommon.|$|E
40|$|The {{reproductive}} {{biology of}} the <b>Italian</b> <b>Sparrow</b> is relevant {{in the formulation}} of phylogeny hypothesis. In this study we report some evidence that, if combined with other studies, can contribute to outline a profile of the species and to strengthen the hypothesis about the African origin of the <b>Italian</b> <b>Sparrow...</b>|$|E
40|$|Hybrid {{speciation}} {{has until}} recently been largely neglected by zoologists. This attitude is now changing. However, data is still scarce, and published examples include few taxa. In this thesis I present the first genetic evidence for hybrid speciation in birds, the long held {{example of the}} <b>Italian</b> <b>Sparrow</b> Passer italiae. This bird is intermediate in phenotype between its putative parental taxa, House Sparrow Passer domesticus and Spanish Sparrow Passer hispaniolensis, and its distribution {{is limited to the}} Italian peninsula, falling between the much larger distributions of its putative parentals. I analyzed variation in both nuclear (751 individuals genotyped for 14 microsatellite loci) and mitochondrial (21 individuals analyzed for 967 bp of the ND 2 gene) markers. Individuals analyzed were sampled over the whole distribution of the <b>Italian</b> <b>Sparrow,</b> including the contact zones with both putative parental taxa as well as areas where these live in allopatry. FST and RhoST-estimates show low but consistent values, and indicate that the <b>Italian</b> <b>Sparrow</b> is intermediate in divergence between the House Sparrow and Spanish Sparrow. Further, Bayesian cluster analysis conducted in STRUCTURE reveals two genetic clusters, clearly corresponding to the House Sparrow and Spanish Sparrow, and assigns Italian Sparrows partially to both clusters. I found evidence of a cline in assignment probabilities in the area of phenotypically pure Italian Sparrows, i. e. assignment to the House Sparrow decreases towards the south, which I interpret as introgression from the House Sparrow. Phylogenetic analyses of the mitochondrial ND 2 gene show that the <b>Italian</b> <b>Sparrow</b> is indistinguishable from House Sparrow at this marker whereas Spanish Sparrows form a distinct clade, well differentiated from the House/Italian Sparrow-clade. I argue that, taken together, these results reveal a mixed nuclear genome of recent origin, and hence that the <b>Italian</b> <b>Sparrow</b> is a recently formed homoploid hybrid species. I propose a novel scenario of its origin rooted in the agricultural revolution, and discuss its taxonomic status as well as its future...|$|E
40|$|Hybridization is {{increasingly}} {{recognized as a}} source of novel variation, but how hybridization can contribute to evolution is still not fully understood. Insights into the evolutionary potential of hybrid species, {{and the extent to which}} two parent species are constrained to form only a single specific hybrid phenotype, would increase our understanding of the impact of hybridization on evolution, adaptation and diversity. Here, I address these questions using the <b>Italian</b> <b>sparrow</b> (Passer italiae), a homoploid hybrid bird species formed from hybridization between house (P. domesticus) and Spanish sparrows (P. hispaniolensis). Using multivariate quantitative genetics methods, I examine four sexually dimorphic plumage traits (crown, back, rump and cheek) in males of all three species. For Italian sparrows, I compare three geographically separated island populations, which differ in genomic composition, to examine whether these populations vary in phenotype and whether they have more potential to evolve and diversify than the parent species. I show that the <b>Italian</b> <b>sparrow</b> is mosaic in its plumage pattern; some traits are similar to one of the parent species, others are similar to the other parent, but the <b>Italian</b> <b>sparrow</b> also has transgressive color values for back and rump (that is, outside the phenotypic range of either parent). In spite of strong parallelism in some traits, such as crown, island populations differ in some plumage traits, revealing that more than one phenotype can be formed by the same parent species. Alongside phenotypic novelty, the <b>Italian</b> <b>sparrow</b> has higher variability and evolvability than the parent species, showing that hybridization can indeed act {{as a source of}} new variation. However, my results indicate that, after initial hybridization, selection on secondary sexual signals can be strong along the axis of parental divergence in a hybrid species, as suggested by a pattern of low evolvability along this axis and fixation for one of the parental values for some traits in the <b>Italian</b> <b>sparrow.</b> This selection may be determined by inheritance patterns of parental female preferences in the hybrid species...|$|E
40|$|Beak {{morphology}} is an ecologically important trait for birds. Beak {{size and}} shape are crucial for adapting to new niches and for optimal utilization of existing food sources. The adaptive potential of a species can be limited {{by the amount of}} standing genetic variation and by genetic and ontogenetic constraints. Organisms of mixed ancestry, however, can be hypothesized to have a particularly high adaptive potential due to more genetic variation and the breakup of genetic constraints. Here, I take advantage of the homoploid hybrid origin of the <b>Italian</b> <b>sparrow</b> (Passer italiae), which resulted from hybridization between the Spanish sparrow (P. hispaniolensis) and the house sparrow (P. domesticus), to study aspects of local adaptation in beak morphology. I investigate how beak shape differs from that of its parent species and which factors best explain beak shape variation in this species. I found significant differences in both beak {{size and shape}} between Passer sparrow populations within and between species. I also found that local diet, as estimated from stable isotopes, is a strong predictor of beak shape variation in the <b>Italian</b> <b>sparrow,</b> suggesting that the beak of the <b>Italian</b> <b>sparrow</b> readily adapts to local conditions. Further, comparing island and mainland populations of both Italian and Spanish sparrows, I found that insularity is another important factor affecting {{the size and shape of}} the beak in a parallel fashion in both species. Finally, I investigated possible effects of species interactions by comparing diet and beak morphology of Italian sparrows living sympatrically with Spanish sparrows with nearby allopatric ones. The beak of micro-allopatric Italian sparrows did not differ in size or shape from Spanish sparrows and they had greatly overlapping diets. In contrast, in sympatry Italian sparrows had a significantly different diet and beak shape supporting the hypothesis that sympatric Italian sparrows have adapted to a different niche to escape competition from its parent species (i. e. character displacement). In conclusion, the <b>Italian</b> <b>sparrow</b> appears to have a highly adaptable beak, and beak shape variation seems to be crucial for adaptation to novel niches and environments including niche shifts induced by a closely related competitor...|$|E
40|$|Theory {{predicts that}} {{variability}} {{in size and}} {{the shape of a}} morphological trait should often be stable both at the intra- and interspecific level. We studied variation in beak integration among several populations of two species of the genus Passer, a hybrid species, the <b>Italian</b> <b>sparrow</b> (Passer italiae) and one of its parents, the Spanish sparrow (Passer hispaniolensis). We show that the general shape of the beak has been conserved in these two species and that hybrid speciation has had no major effects on beak integration. However, in young, sympatric populations, phenotypic integration between beak height and length decreased significantly, to the extent that these two dimensions apparently became independent. This displacement in phenotypic integration seems to be accompanied with changes in the distribution of phenotypic variation at the univariate level. This suggests that while beak shape may have been constrained over evolutionary time-scales and major hybridization events (i. e. the formation of the hybrid <b>Italian</b> <b>sparrow),</b> under specific selection regimes linked to secondary contact, it can evolve rapidly...|$|E
