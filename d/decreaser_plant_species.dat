However, most studies {{have been carried out}} under limitations of time, space, or appropriate controls. In order to further examine the relation between <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> diversity and the soil food web, we conducted a three-year semi-field experiment in which eight <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> (4 forb and 4 grass species) were grown in monocultures and mixtures of two, four and eight <b>plant</b> <b>species.</b> In addition there were communities with 16 <b>plant</b> <b>species.</b> We analyzed the abundance and identity of the nematodes in soil and roots, including feeding groups from various trophic levels (primary and secondary consumers, carnivores, and omnivores) in the soil food web. <b>Plant</b> <b>species</b> diversity and <b>plant</b> identity affected the diversity of nematodes. The effect of plant diversity was attributed to the complementarity in resource quality of the component <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> rather than to an increase in total resource quantity. The nematode diversity varied more between the different <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> than between different levels of <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> diversity, so that plant identity is more important than plant diversity.

Empirical inference of evolutionary responses of the native <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> to invasive <b>plants</b> has involved experiments comparing two conspecific groups of native plants for differences in expression of growth/reproductive traits: populations that have experienced {{competition from}} the invasive <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> (i. e. experienced natives) versus populations with no known history of interactions with the invasive <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> (i. e. naive natives).

40|$|Climate {{change has}} the {{potential}} to alter the distributions of threatened <b>plant</b> <b>species,</b> and may therefore diminish the capacity of nature reserves to protect threatened <b>plant</b> <b>species.</b> Chinese nature reserves contain a rich diversity of <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> that are at risk of becoming more threatened by climate change. Hence, it is urgent to identify the extent to which future climate change may compromise the suitability of threatened <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> habitats within Chinese nature reserves. Here, we modelled the climate suitability of 82 threatened <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> within 168 nature reserves across climate change scenarios. We used Maxent modelling based on species occurrence localities and evaluated climate change impacts using the magnitude of change in climate suitability and the degree of overlap between current and future climatically suitable habitats. There was a significant relationship between overlap with current and future climate suitability of all threatened <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> habitats and the magnitude of changes in climate suitability. Our projections estimate that the climate suitability of more than 60 threatened <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> will decrease and that climate change threatens the habitat suitability of <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> in more than 130 nature reserves under the low, medium, and high greenhouse gas concentration scenarios by both 2050 s and 2080 s. Furthermore, future climate change may substantially threaten tree <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> through changes in annual mean temperature. These results indicate that climate change may threaten <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> that occur within Chinese nature reserves.

Plants {{may benefit from}} range expansion when they escape from natural enemies. However, range expansion becomes a disadvantage when plants become disconnected from organisms that control enemies in the new range. Here, we examined nematode control in the root zone of range-expanding <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> and congeneric natives. In a greenhouse, we determined bottom-up (by the plants) and top-down (by natural enemies of the nematodes) control of two root-feeding nematode species (Helicotylenchus pseudorobustus and Meloidogyne hapla) in the rhizospheres of two range-expanding <b>plant</b> <b>species,</b> Centaurea stoebe and Geranium pyrenaicum, and two congeneric natives, Centaurea jacea and Geranium molle. Pots with plants growing in sterilized soil were inoculated with either a microbial soil community from the newly colonized natural habitat, a mixture of native microbial nematode antagonists, {{or a combination of}} these two communities. We tested the hypotheses that bottom-up control of root-feeding nematodes would be strongest in the root zone of range expanders and that top-down control would be strongest in the root zone of native <b>plant</b> <b>species.</b> We observed profound intra- and interspecific differences in bottom-up and top-down control among all four <b>plant</b> <b>species.</b> Bottom-up control by the range-expanding <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> was either strong or weak.

However, few reports exist of the impacts of forest logging on these species. In this study, based on surveys of 164 quadrats of 25 m× 25 m in Jianfengling, Hainan Island, the species composition and relationships between species richness of Hainan endemic seed plants and the total <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> richness were analyzed. Each of the 164 quadrats was grouped into one of three forest types, including old-growth, selectively logged and clear-cut forests. Then changes in species diversity were studied by comparing species–area relationships, cumulative species–individual relationships and species abundance distributions for the Hainan endemic seed <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> among the three forests types. Results highlighted the abundance and diversity of endemic seed <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> in Jianfengling. We found 158 species which acount for 40 % of all endemic seed <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> found on Hainan Island, including 98 woody species (excluding lianas). Fifty-two woody endemic seed <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> (excluding lianas) from Hainan Island were recorded in the 164 quadrats; 53 % of all woody endemic seed <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> in Jianfengling. Among them, Lauraceae, Fagaceae and Rubiaceae are dominant families. The richness of the woody seed <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> endemic to Hainan Island was linearly correlated with the total <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> richness in the quadrat. After forest logging, the number of woody endemic seed <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> appears to increase slightly, especially in selectively logged forests. However, the woody endemic seed <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> that appear to increase post-logging only occur in 1 – 2 quadrats and have relatively small and unstable populations, and may therefore disappear during forest succession.

40|$|The {{hypothesis}} was tested that ant dispersed <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> are {{adapted to the}} seasonal variation in ant activity, i. e. that ant dispersed <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> produce ripe fruits when the activity of their seed dispersers is especially high. Two testable predictions of this hypothesis exist: 1. Ant dispersed and differently dispersed <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> differ in their seasonal development, i. e. ant dispersed <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> fruit (flower) earlier or {{later in the year}} than other <b>plant</b> <b>species.</b> Floristic investigations yielded ant dispersed <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> to flower and fruit 1. 5 - 2 month earlier than non-ant dispersed <b>plant</b> <b>species.</b> Since other factors such as growth form, seed size or pollination mode may have caused this seasonal difference, multivariate analyses were performed. The results demonstrated that these additional factors had only little influence on the seasonal difference and that the effect was mainly due to the mode of seed dispersal. 2. At times when ant dispersed <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> produce ripe fruits the ant activity must be higher than at times when non-ant dispersed <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> do. Investigations of seasonal frequencies of ant individuals and of seasonal seed removal rates revealed ant activity to be especially high from May to July. Mean fruiting time of ant dispersed <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> was the beginning of July. Mean fruiting time of non-ant dispersed <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> was end of August / beginning of September.
