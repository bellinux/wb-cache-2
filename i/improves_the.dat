5|$|A {{secondary}} control input that the rider can make is to lean the upper torso {{relative to the}} bike. As mentioned above, the effectiveness of rider lean varies inversely with {{the mass of the}} bike. On heavy bikes, such as motorcycles, rider lean mostly alters the ground clearance requirements in a turn, <b>improves</b> <b>the</b> view of the road, and <b>improves</b> <b>the</b> bike system dynamics in a very low-frequency passive manner. In motorcycle racing, leaning the torso, moving the body, and projecting a knee {{to the inside of the}} turn relative to the bike can also cause an aerodynamic yawing moment that facilitates entering and rounding the turn.|$|E

5|$|Addition {{of boron}} nitride to silicon nitride {{ceramics}} <b>improves</b> <b>the</b> thermal shock {{resistance of the}} resulting material. For the same purpose, BN is added also to silicon nitride-alumina and titanium nitride-alumina ceramics. Other materials being reinforced with BN include alumina and zirconia, borosilicate glasses, glass ceramics, enamels, and composite ceramics with titanium boride-boron nitride, titanium boride-aluminium nitride-boron nitride, and silicon carbide-boron nitride composition.|$|E
5|$|Ceramic {{industry}} consumes {{a significant}} amount of zinc oxide, in particular in ceramic glaze and frit compositions. The relatively high heat capacity, thermal conductivity and high temperature stability of ZnO coupled with a comparatively low coefﬁcient of expansion are desirable properties in the production of ceramics. ZnO affects the melting point and optical properties of the glazes, enamels, and ceramic formulations. Zinc oxide as a low expansion, secondary ﬂux <b>improves</b> <b>the</b> elasticity of glazes by reducing the change in viscosity as a function of temperature and helps prevent crazing and shivering. By substituting ZnO for BaO and PbO, the heat capacity is decreased and the thermal conductivity is increased. Zinc in small amounts <b>improves</b> <b>the</b> development of glossy and brilliant surfaces. However, in moderate to high amounts, it produces matte and crystalline surfaces. With regard to color, zinc has a complicated inﬂuence.|$|E
5|$|Finally, the {{flared end}} {{is known as}} the bell. Contrary to popular belief, the bell does not amplify the sound; rather, it <b>improves</b> <b>the</b> {{uniformity}} of the instrument's tone for the lowest notes in each register. For the other notes the sound is produced almost entirely at the tone holes and the bell is irrelevant. On basset horns and larger clarinets, the bell curves up and forward and is usually made of metal.|$|E

5|$|Innovation management: The {{value of}} the {{coordinating}} role of design in new product development has been well documented. Design management can help to improve innovation management, which can be measured by three variables: it reduces time-to-market, by improving sources and communication skills and developing cross-functional innovation; it stimulates networking innovation, by managing product and customer information flows with internal (e.g. teams) and external (e.g. suppliers, society) actors; it <b>improves</b> <b>the</b> learning process by promoting a continuous learning process.|$|E

5|$|Most Solar {{parks are}} ground mounted PV systems, {{also known as}} {{free-field}} solar power plants. They can either be fixed tilt or use a single axis or dual axis solar tracker. While tracking <b>improves</b> <b>the</b> overall performance, it also increases the system's installation and maintenance cost. A solar inverter converts the array's power output from DC to AC, and connection to the utility grid is made through a high voltage, three phase step up transformer of typically 10kV and above.|$|E
5|$|Neodymium–iron–boron magnets {{can have}} up to 6% of the {{neodymium}} substituted by dysprosium to raise the coercivity for demanding applications, such as drive motors for electric vehicles and generators for wind turbines. This substitution would require up to 100grams of dysprosium per electric car produced. Based on Toyota's projected 2million units per year, the use of dysprosium in applications such as this would quickly exhaust its available supply. The dysprosium substitution may also be useful in other applications because it <b>improves</b> <b>the</b> corrosion resistance of the magnets.|$|E
5|$|Selenium is {{used with}} bismuth in brasses to replace more toxic lead.

5|$|A patient's genome {{may include}} an {{inherited}} or random mutation which affects {{the probability of}} developing a disease in the future.

Cardiovascular risk is indicated by biological markers and screening can measure the risk that a child will be born with a genetic disease such as Cystic fibrosis. Genetic testing is ethically complex: patients may not want the stress of knowing their risk. In countries without universal healthcare, a known risk may raise insurance premiums.|$|E
