Deeper analysis of outward investment revealed that much of what was thought to be foreign debt securities owned by British companies were actually loans to British citizens. <b>Inward</b> <b>investment</b> also dropped, from a surplus of £120bn {{in the first half of}} 2016 to a deficit of £25bn in the same period of 2017. The UK had been relying on a surplus of <b>inward</b> <b>investment</b> to make up for its long-term current account deficit.

40|$|Using a {{balanced}} panel of firm-level {{data on the}} manufacturing industry in France, Italy and Spain over the 1993 - 1997 period, this paper examines the impact of foreign presence on the productivity of domestic enterprises. We innovate on existing literature by using firm-level data comparable across countries. A generalisation of the results obtained for individual countries is attempted by introducing two key variables {{in the analysis of}} the impact of <b>inward</b> <b>investments</b> on domestic performances: productivity gaps between foreign and domestic firms, and productivity levels of MNEs. It is shown that it is the combination of high gaps and high levels of foreign productivity that has the most positive effects. This leads to a critical consideration of both the “catching up” hypothesis, which identifies a positive relation between the size of technological gaps and growth opportunities induced by foreign investments; and the “technological accumulation ” hypothesis, which stresses the role of domestic absorptive capacity and of coherence between foreign and domestic technology as determinants of virtuous effects of <b>inward</b> <b>investments.</b> Based on these results, policy implications are drawn, concerning the selection and promotion of <b>inward</b> <b>investments</b> in advanced countries...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the sectoral patterns of {{foreign direct investment}} in France, Italy and Spain, using a novel data-set on manufacturing firms for the 1993 - 97 period. Significant heterogeneities emerge across countries in terms of weight and distribution of foreign presence, {{and in terms of}} productivity levels of multinational firms. It is shown that such structural diversities can help explain the different impact of foreign owned activities on labour productivity of domestic firms in these countries. Based on this evidence some critical considerations are made on both the “catching up ” hypothesis, which identifies a positive relation between the size of technological gaps and growth opportunities induced by foreign investments; and the “technological accumulation” hypothesis, which stresses the role of domestic absorptive capacity and of coherence between foreign and domestic technology as determinants of virtuous effects of <b>inward</b> <b>investments.</b> Policy implications are drawn, concerning the selection and promotion of <b>inward</b> <b>investments</b> in advanced countries...|$|R

25|$|The {{economy of}} Wakefield {{declined}} {{in the last quarter}} of the 20thcentury as the coal mines and traditional manufacturing industries closed, contributing to high rates of unemployment. In the Index of Multiple Deprivation 2015, 14.35% of the district's lower super-output areas were in the most deprived 10% of England. Employment grew by 12% between 1998 and 2003 as the economy recovered and enjoyed growth as the economic base of the district was diversified. Growth has been supported by <b>inward</b> <b>investment</b> from European and United Kingdom government funding which has impacted on the regeneration of the area. Manufacturing remains an important employment sector although the decline is projected to continue whilst distribution and the service industries are now among the main employers.|$|E
500|$|Speaking in November 2012, Scottish {{transport}} minister Keith Brown {{predicted that}} the Borders Railway would bring <b>inward</b> <b>investment</b> into local communities as well as £33 million of benefits for the wider Scottish economy. The construction phase itself would support 400 jobs and would act as a catalyst to increased business development and housing as the area became within commuting distance of Edinburgh. Car journeys would be reduced by 60,000 peak trips per year, which would reduce carbon emissions and alleviate traffic and accidents on the A7 and A68 roads. The housing prediction came to pass when, {{as reported in the}} Edinburgh Evening News on 5 August 2013, a housing boom had been triggered along the line, with the number of new houses in Midlothian having doubled in the previous year, many of which were located in proximity to the line's stations. It is expected that 4,000 houses will be built in the Shawfair area in the next 25 years. On 20 August 2014, Alex Salmond, then First Minister of Scotland, announced to a meeting with members of the [...] Scottish Borders Council that he expected the railway to benefit the Scottish economy by millions of pounds and that a feasibility study would be conducted to identify ways in which the line could boost tourism in the Borders region.|$|E

We suggest that, among other reasons, a specification error might explain some of these results. A more general specification, which includes the usual one as a special case, is proposed. Using data on Italian manufacturing firms in 1992 - 2000, we find positive externalities only once we allow for the more flexible specification. ...|$|R

2500|$|Critics {{argue that}} the {{organizing}} model is inappropriate {{to the task of}} unions in the modern global economy. [...] They say that industrial disputes of the type that organising engenders are harmful to the national economies in which they occur: by increasing uncertainty and raising wages (labor costs), they will make economies less attractive to <b>inward</b> <b>investment.</b> Hence, working people will suffer in the long term, as the less investment there is, the fewer jobs there will be. [...] The conclusion of those who take this line is that unions should emphasize their service aspects, particularly those that contribute toward the well-being of the employer as well as the employee. In addition, there are the criticisms leveled by the anti-union Right, who often associate collective action with the tyranny of 'Big labor', contrasted to the free operation of the capitalist labor market.|$|E

The [...] "Glasgow's miles better" [...] campaign, launched in 1983, and opening of the Burrell Collection in 1983 and Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre in 1985 facilitated Glasgow's new role as a European centre for business services and finance and promoted an increase in tourism and <b>inward</b> <b>investment.</b> The latter continues to be bolstered by the legacy of the city's Glasgow Garden Festival in 1988, its status as European City of Culture in 1990, and concerted attempts to diversify the city's economy. However, it is the industrial heritage that serves as key tourism enabler. Wider economic revival has persisted and the ongoing regeneration of inner-city areas, including the large-scale Clyde Waterfront Regeneration, has led to more affluent people moving back to live in the centre of Glasgow, fuelling allegations of gentrification.

40|$|Introduction The {{level of}} Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) into Japan {{has always been}} {{considered}} low compared to other leading developed countries. Both the ratio of inward FDI to GDP and the ratio of foreign investments into Japan to Japanese investments abroad have remained far smaller than the average for the latter countries. In 1999, inward FDI amounted to 0. 7 % of the GDP whereas the ratio reached 9. 3 %, 9. 5 %, 11. 7 % and 23. 3 % for Germany, the United States, France and England, respectively. <b>Inward</b> foreign <b>investments</b> amounted to 13 % of Japanese investments abroad while the ratio was 54 %, 96 %, 61 % and 59 % for the four developed countries, respectively.
