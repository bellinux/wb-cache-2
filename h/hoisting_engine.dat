60|$|If the {{cylinder}} {{were left in}} its present position the crab might seize the chains by which it was suspended, while if it were raised it would cease to be a defence. Notwithstanding this latter contingency, the order was quickly given to raise {{the cylinder}}; but before the <b>hoisting</b> <b>engine</b> had been set in motion, Crab Q thrust forward her forceps {{over the top of}} the cylinder and held it down. Another thrust, and the iron jaws had grasped one of the two ponderous chains by which the cylinder was suspended.|$|E

50|$|In 1921 {{the drive}} of Bad Schandau Elevator were changed to {{three-phase}} alternating current, a crank handle was {{left for the}} emergency operation.

In the years 1989-1990 the plant, which was put under monument protection in 1954, was reconditioned.|$|E
50|$|It {{was decided}} to install new large smelters, with 200 tons daily {{capacity}} and powerful mining machinery, and to dam Return Creek to provide adequate water for the treatment plant. Also, multi-tubular boilers, a powerful double cylinder <b>hoisting</b> <b>engine,</b> stone crushers, air compressors, a sawmill and water pumping station were established {{in association with the}} mining of the Mount Garnet lode.

50|$|In {{the early}} part of the twentieth century, the shafts at Quincy Mine were {{increasing}} in depth at a prodigious rate as the company pushed farther underground in search of copper. Between 1905 and 1920, the depth of the principal shafts increased from 5000 feet to over 7000. The requirements to lift rock to the surface from ever-increasing depths severely strained the capabilities of the company's mine hoist equipment. By 1916, the hoist servicing the number 2 shaft had reached its depth limit. Rather than abandon the shaft or eke out a little more depth by retrofitting the existing hoist, Quincy hired the Nordberg Manufacturing Company and Bruno V. Nordberg to design a new <b>hoist</b> <b>engine</b> at a cost of $160,000. It would be the largest mine hoist in the world.|$|R
5000|$|The Quincy Mine No. 2 Shaft Hoist House is a {{rectangular}} structure, faced with red brick veneer, measuring 72 by 76 ft in plan and rising to {{a height of}} almost five stories. The building is particularly decorative for a hoist house, containing an inordinate number of windows and, originally, a green glazed tile roof. By 1978, the green tile had been removed. The design of the building included large doors, open interior space with no columns, and an overhead crane to facilitate {{the installation of the}} hoist. The reinforced concrete foundation supporting the building and the <b>hoist</b> <b>engine</b> is particularly notable: it contains [...] of material and was reputedly the largest block of reinforced concrete ever poured for such a purpose. It {{was one of the first}} very large reinforced concrete buildings ever built.|$|R
50|$|The {{largest of}} the three engines is the <b>hoisting</b> <b>engine.</b> It is a double-cylinder {{horizontal}} type with a 12 in bore and 16 in stroke. In addition to powering the hoist, it provided locomotive power and could move the shovel at speeds of a 1/4 mph. About 50 ft of the hoist chain has been removed.Both of the other engines have an 8 in bore. The swing engine, attached to a chain around the swing circle, moves the boom from side to side. The other engine, the boom or crowd engine, raises and lowers the dipper. Due to its exposure to the weather, {{it is no longer}} in working condition. The other two, wholly inside the main section, were more protected from the elements and could be operated with compressed air.|$|E

This mine operated between 1922 and 1954, with a peak production of 670408 tons per year. The coal seam itself is 6 to 8 feet thick.

40|$|The {{conceptual}} design {{is based on}} a Koepe hoist and is intended for transport of the POLLUX casks with a large hoisting cage and counterweight. The <b>hoisting</b> <b>engine</b> is comprised in a winding tower, with a designed rope load of approx. 214. 2 t in the hoistway, and of approx. 171. 7 t in the balance pit. The hoisting equipment is designed as an 8 -rope system with the ropes measuring approx. 50 mm across. The design was {{to take into account the}} {{conceptual design}} of the planned radwaste repository, characterized by the fact that the upcast shaft (shaft hoisting system shaft 2) is to serve as the transport shaft for radwaste containers, as this function requires additional airlocks in order to avoid shortcircuiting of air. The design comprises all in all the port for the hoisting car receiving the containers from a cross-gate, the shaft emplacement equipment, the hoisting tower, control equipment, the shaft furniture, the <b>hoisting</b> <b>engine,</b> the ropes and materials handling device, the counterweight, communicators, balance rope devices, and the electric system.
