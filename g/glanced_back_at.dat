60|$|Miles {{continuously}} <b>glanced</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> {{the church}} door. Jackson Elder did not appear. The door did not once open after the awkward {{entrance of the}} first guests. Miles's hand closed on Bea's arm.|$|E
60|$|Dartrey <b>glanced</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> {{the hall}} stand. There was no hat or coat there except his own. He {{followed}} Nora {{into the little}} study, which was separated only by a curtain from the dining room.|$|E

60|$|Fuller did {{not reply}} {{for a minute or}} two, and Dick, whose face was rather hot, <b>glanced</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> Ida. Her eyes were now fixed on him with quiet interest, and {{something}} in her expression indicated approval.|$|E
60|$|She <b>glanced</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> him as {{she walked}} down the path to the roadway. He was still {{standing}} where she had left him, his feet slightly apart, his hands in the pockets of his riding breeches, looking after her.|$|E

6000|$|Flip began {{a series}} of distortions with her shoulders, ran on ahead, picked up a few pebbles and threw them into the wood, <b>glanced</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> Lance with {{swimming}} mottled eyes, that seemed a piquant incarnation of everything suggestive and tantalizing, and said, ...|$|E
