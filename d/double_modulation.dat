40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the influence of}} the Stiles–Crawford effect (SCE) of the first kind on the contrast sensitivity function using the apodisation model of the SCE. The SCE was measured for the right eyes of two subjects using an increment threshold technique involving a two-channel Maxwellian-viewing system. Filters made of photographic film neutralised or doubled the SCE. Contrast sensitivities were measured with a 6 mm pupil diameter, defocus to 2 D, and three SCE conditions (normal, neutralised and <b>doubled).</b> <b>Modulation</b> transfer functions were derived after measuring transverse aberrations with a vernier alignment technique, and were used to predict contrast sensitivity functions (CSFs). The measured CSFs were, in general, reasonable matches with the predicted CSFs. In particular, both demonstrated definite undulations (‘‘notches’’) as defocus level increased. The influences of the SCE-modifying filters were generally of similar magnitude and direction to predictions, thus supporting the apodisation model of the SCE. The magnitudes of SCE influence between SCE-neutralised and SCE-doubled conditions were usually small at about 0. 2 – 0. 3 log unit, with a maximum influence of 0. 5 log unit. Influences of the SCE were greater for myopic than for hypermetropic defocus.

The linewidth parameters for self-broadening of the ΔJ= 2 ← 1 rotational components for the ground v_ 8, 1 v_ 8, and the 2 v_ 8 vibrations were determined over a pressure range of 1 to 13 mtorr and at a temperature of 300 K. The <b>double</b> <b>modulation</b> technique is used to explore the high eighth derivative of the line shape profile of the spectral line. This technique proved to give good signal-to-noise ratios and enabled the recovery of weak signals. An experimental method is developed to correct for source modulation broadening. The tests of the ratios of the two inner peak's separation of the eighth derivative of the line showed that they were up to 95 % similar to those for a Lorentzian line shape function. The line shapes were assumed to be Lorentzian for the theoretical analysis of the derivative profiles and comparisons were made between experiment and theory on this basis. Dipole moments for vibrationally excited states were calculated from linewidth parameters and show systematic decrease with the increase of excitation. Impact parameters were calculated using the "hard sphere" model of the kinetic theory of gases. The results were many times larger than the size of the molecule itself.
