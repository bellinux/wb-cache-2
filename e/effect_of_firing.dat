40|$|Our limited {{understanding}} of the short and long-term <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> on fish contributes to considerable uncertainty in assessments of {{the risks and benefits}} <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> management alternatives. A primary concern among the many potential <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> is the <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> and fire management on persistence of native fish populations. Limited evidence suggests vulnerability <b>of</b> fish to <b>fire</b> is contingent upon the quality of affected habitats, the amount and distribution of habitat (habitat fragmentation), and habitat specificity of the species in question. Species with narrow habitat requirements in highly degraded and fragmented systems are likely to be most vulnerable to fire and fire-related disturbance. In addition to <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> on native fish, there are growing concerns about the <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> on nonnative fish invasions. The role <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> in facilitating invasions by nonnative fishes is unknown, but experience with other species suggests some forms of disturbance associated with fire may facilitate invasion. Management efforts to promote persistence of fishes in fire-prone landscapes can take the form of four basic alternatives: (1) prefire management; (2) post-fire management; (3) managing fire itself (e. g. fire fighting); and (4) monitoring and adaptive management. Among these alternatives, pre-fire management is likely to be most effective. Effective pre-fire management activities will address factors that may render fish populations more vulnerable to the <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> (e. g. habitat degradation, fragmentation, and nonnative species). Post-fire management is also potentially important, but suffers from being a reactive approach that may not address threats in time to avert them.

Entitled [...] "Cathode Ray Tube Amusement Device", the patent describes a game in which a player controls the CRT's electron gun much like an Etch A Sketch. The beam from the gun is focused at a single point on the screen to form a dot representing a missile, and the player tries to control the dot to hit paper targets put on the screen, with all hits detected mechanically. By connecting a cathode ray tube to an oscilloscope and devising knobs that controlled the angle and trajectory of the light traces displayed on the oscilloscope, they were able to invent a missile game that, when using screen overlays, created the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>firing</b> missiles at various targets. [...] To make the game more challenging, its circuits can alter the player's ability to aim the dot. However, due to the equipment costs and various circumstances, the Cathode-Ray Tube Amusement Device was never released to the marketplace. Only handmade prototypes were ever created.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{specific}} effect that firing costs {{can have on}} firms facing liquidity constraints. When firing costs are zero and a time gap exists between production and its associated revenues, firing allows firms {{to hold on to}} their liquid assets by saving on wages, and thus, allows firms to cope better with liquidity shocks when external financing is too costly or unavailable. I refer to this feature as labor's liquidity service. Higher firing costs reduces the value of labor's liquidity service, and thus, increases firms' incentive for hoarding liquidity and reduces firms' demand for production inputs. In addition to this negative effect at the creation margin of production, firing costs have a relatively higher positive effect on the destruction margin of production of financially restricted firms. This paper presents a model that develops these ideas and shows that the presence of firing costs has a stronger negative effect on the output of firms facing liquidity constraints.

The magnocellular vasopressin neurons of the hypothalamus do have an output that is both well understood and quantifiable: they secrete a hormone into the bloodstream in proportion to blood osmolarity and volume, regulating these properties within a narrow physiologically acceptable range. This response of vasopressin secretion to osmotic pressure must be maintained to defend blood pressure. The neurons display a distinctive phasic firing pattern, which a model was developed to mimic.

40|$|Purpose Forests play a {{key role}} in the global carbon (C) and {{nitrogen}} (N) cycling. Fire is a global phenomenon occurring in many forest ecosystems, which has several environmental and ecological <b>effects.</b> The objective <b>of</b> this review was to improve our understanding <b>of</b> the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> on soil gross N transformations in forest ecosystems. Methods and results We have reviewed the published studies using 15 N pool dilution technique with analytical data analysis method to study the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>fires</b> on gross N transformations in forest ecosystems. Wildfires increased gross N mineralization rates in the short term and the effect disappeared from 3 years after the <b>fire,</b> while the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> prescribed <b>fires</b> disappeared from 2 years after the burning. Both wildfires and prescribed fires reduced gross nitrification in the short term, while their effects varied from 6 months following the burning. Conclusions The different responses of gross N transformations to the fires in forest ecosystems depended on many factors including forest types, the intensity and frequency <b>of</b> <b>fires,</b> the time elapsed between the fires and sampling events, incubation conditions (field or laboratory incubation), climatic conditions and so on. In view of many factors influencing the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>fires</b> on gross N transformations, more comprehensive studies with physical, chemical, microbial and ecological characterization are needed to improve our knowledge about the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>fires</b> on soil gross N transformations and then N cycling in forest ecosystems.
