6000|$|... "Just one thing," [...] said Spode. [...] "A {{touch to}} your waistcoat." [...] He unbuttoned the {{dissipated}} garment and <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> again more symmetrically.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes,' Charley said; 'two of {{the cows}} {{of the last}} lot papa bought are {{accustomed}} to be milked, and Hubert and I have <b>done</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> till now; but we shall hand them over to you, and you girls will have to learn.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Right. That's your job. That's all right. Get as much sulphur as you can--saltpetre {{to make it}} burn. Sent? Charing Cross. Right away. See they <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> Follow <b>it</b> <b>up.</b> Anything?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Harold {{made a very}} queer face, and said, 'How is he to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> in the hay-loft, Mother? and he ha'n't {{got enough}} to pay for lodgings, nor for washing, nor to change.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's only a duck. They can <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> very neatly at Mallett's," [...] {{said the}} mother, simply. [...] "You won't mind, will you? We'll have a scratch dinner at nine, because it's so hot." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Please, don't speak so kind,' said Paul; {{and this}} time he could not prevent a-sob. 'Nobody ever did so before, and--' he paused, and went on, 'I suppose they <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> in Heaven, so I hope I shall die.' ...|$|E

2500|$|... "Watcha Gonna <b>Do</b> (<b>It's</b> <b>Up</b> to You)" [...] : The Agent Carter episode [...] "A Little Song and Dance" [...] {{begins with}} a dream {{sequence}} that begins in black and white, before transitioning to color in [...] "true Wizard of Oz fashion" [...] for a Broadway-style dance number featuring an original song from composer Christopher Lennertz and lyricist David Zippel, in conjunction with series executive producers Tara Butters and Michele Fazekas. Titled [...] "Watcha Gonna <b>Do</b> (<b>It's</b> <b>Up</b> to You)", the song was performed by actors Enver Gjokaj and Hayley Atwell. On working with Zippel, Lennertz said, [...] "It was such a thrill to collaborate on a song with David. His musical style blended well with the jazzy musical tone we were going for, especially on this episode." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Exactly!" [...] she cried, [...] "exactly! Before {{there were}} so many Excursionists and sailors and Low People about, one came out, one sat and brushed it in the sun. And then of course it really was {{possible}} to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>up.</b> But now----" ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{young man}} reflected. He {{addressed}} Banghurst's {{back after a}} pause. His voice had flattened a little. [...] "I might go over this and <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> as a lark perhaps. Make it a comic dialogue sketch {{with a man who}} really believed in it--or something like that. It's a beastly lot of copy to get slumped, you know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, yes, it is. Parsons' {{marriages are}} often very grand affairs. They come in among county people. That's their luck in life. Doctors never do; nor lawyers. I don't think lawyers ever {{get married in}} the country. They're {{supposed}} to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> in London. But a country doctor's wedding is not a thing to be talked about much." ...|$|E
6000|$|Only Beatrice {{bit her lip}} with vexation. [...] "I {{had almost}} {{forgotten}} about my hair," [...] she said; [...] "I must apologise for appearing in such a state. I would have <b>done</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> after dinner only I was too stiff, and while I was waiting for Betty, I went to sleep." ...|$|R

60|$|Just {{the moment}} he had <b>done</b> <b>it,</b> <b>up</b> sprang George Duff,--you know the keen {{competition}} there is, as a straight matter of business, between the banks in Mariposa,--up sprang George Duff, I say, and wrote out a cheque for another hundred conditional on the fund reaching seventy thousand. You never heard such cheering in your life.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, dear; it's in {{the left}} hand pocket of my blue coat, all written down clearly. So what's the use of bothering? We aren't there yet. By and bye we'll get to Eu-rope an' <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> brown. Whatever happens, and {{wherever}} we go, it's {{got to be a}} spree and a jolly good time; so take it easy, Patsy dear, and don't worry." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Charlie {{took the}} coat like a lamb, {{though he was}} Tom’s pal, and Tom looked round to see whether he couldn’t nip up the ladder and get away, but Bill was {{just in front of}} it. Then Tom found out that one of ’is bootlaces was undone and he knelt down to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>up,</b> and this young {{ordinary}} seaman, Joe Simms by name, put his ’ead out of his bunk and he ses, quiet-like: ...|$|E
6000|$|Peter said he'd go with 'im, {{and just}} as {{they got to the}} door Mr. Goodman said he'd go too. O' course, the shops was shut, and arter Mr. Goodman 'ad stood on Tower Hill admiring the Tower by {{moonlight}} till Sam felt ready to drop, they all walked back. Three times Sam's boot-lace come undone, but as the ethers all stopped too to see 'im <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> it didn't do 'im much good.

60|$|So now Della's {{beautiful}} {{hair fell}} about her rippling and shining like {{a cascade of}} brown waters. It reached below her knee and made itself almost a garment for her. And then she <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> again nervously and quickly. Once she faltered {{for a minute and}} stood still while a tear or two splashed on the worn red carpet.|$|R
60|$|And Andy <b>did</b> keep <b>it</b> <b>up</b> {{until two}} keepers appeared, hatless and {{almost out of}} breath, and took the bear in charge.|$|R
6000|$|... "I wish he {{had worn}} his yellow beaver hat in the pulpit," [...] Braile went on. [...] "It {{must have been a}} {{disappointment}} to Abe Reverdy, but perhaps he consoled himself with a full sight of the fellow's long hair. He ought to part it in the middle, like Thomas Jefferson, and <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> in a knot like a woman. Well, we can't have everything, even in a man of God; but maybe he isn't really a man of God. That would account for a good many things. But I think he shows taste in preferring old Gillespie to Peter Hingston; next to Abe Reverdy he's the biggest fool in Leatherwood. Maybe the prophet knew by instinct that there would be better fried chicken at Gillespie's." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should like}} you," [...] he said, [...] "to take down {{your hair and}} throw away all that is not real, to wash it until it is its natural color, to brush it hard, and then <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> quite simply, without a net or anything. Then I should like you to wash your face {{thoroughly}} in plain soap and water and never again touch a powder-puff or that nasty red stuff you have on your lips. I should like you to throw away those fancy blouses with the imitation lace, which are ugly to start with, and which you can't afford to have washed often enough, and I should like you to buy some plain linen shirts and collars, a black tie, and a blue serge skirt made {{so that you could}} walk in it naturally." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; he {{collects}} bills, you know,--money," [...] {{she went}} on, with childish eagerness, [...] "not for himself,--HE never has any money, poor Charley,--but for his firm. It's dreadful hard work, too; keeps {{him out for}} days and nights, over bad roads and baddest weather. Sometimes, when he's stole over to the ranch just to see me, he's been so bad he could scarcely keep his seat in the saddle, much less stand. And he's got to take mighty big risks, too. Times the folks are cross with him and won't pay; once they {{shot him in the}} arm, and he came to me, and I helped <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> for him. But he don't mind. He's real brave,--jest as brave as he's good." [...] There was such a wholesome ring of truth in this pretty praise that we were touched in sympathy with the speaker.|$|E

[...] "You see, sur, I wasn't sure which way ye'd like it, an' ye was out whin I come to ax; so I just <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> in three fashions.

60|$|They <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> {{to their}} waists in water, and it cost them an effort, {{for the big}} boat was heavy now; and then, though the Spaniards glanced longingly at the Cumbria's {{blinking}} lights, Jefferson insisted upon their carrying down the bags. When that was done, nobody lost any time in getting on board; and, grasping the paddles, they drove her out into the stream.|$|R
6000|$|Observe the inexpressible {{delight of}} the old grandmother, at Uncle Bill’s splendid joke of ‘tea for four: bread-and-butter for forty;’ and the loud {{explosion}} of mirth which follows his wafering a paper ‘pigtail’ on the waiter’s collar. The young man is evidently ‘keeping company’ with Uncle Bill’s niece: and Uncle Bill’s hints—such as ‘Don’t forget me at the dinner, you know,’ ‘I shall look out for the cake, Sally,’ ‘I’ll be godfather to your first—wager it’s a boy,’ and so forth, are equally embarrassing to the young people, and delightful to the elder ones. As to the old grandmother, she is in perfect ecstasies, and does nothing but laugh herself into fits of coughing, until they have finished the ‘gin-and-water warm with,’ of which Uncle Bill ordered ‘glasses round’ after tea, ‘just to keep the night air out, and to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> comfortable and riglar arter sitch an as-tonishing hot day!’ ...|$|E

I had already said some prayers at his intention at the half-past six mass, the brave gentleman. That maid of my sister Rita was upstairs watching him drive away with her evil eyes, but I made {{a sign of the}} cross after the fiacre, and then I went upstairs and banged at your door, my dear kind young Monsieur, and shouted to Rita that she had no right to lock herself in any of my locataires’ rooms. At last she opened it—and what do you think? All her hair was loose over her shoulders. I suppose it all came down when she flung her hat on your bed. I noticed when she arrived that her hair wasn’t done properly. She used your brushes to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> again in front of your glass.” ...|$|E
60|$|Freya Nelson (or Nielsen) was {{the kind}} of girl one remembers. The oval of her face was perfect; and within that {{fascinating}} frame the most happy disposition of line and feature, with an admirable complexion, gave an impression of health, strength, and what I might call unconscious self-confidence--a most pleasant and, as it were, whimsical determination. I will not compare her eyes to violets, because the real shade of their colour was peculiar, not so dark and more lustrous. They were of the wide-open kind, and looked at one frankly in every mood. I never did see the long, dark eyelashes lowered--I dare say Jasper Allen did, being a privileged person--but I have no doubt that the expression must have been charming in a complex way. She could--Jasper told me once with a touchingly imbecile exultation--sit on her hair. I dare say, I dare say. It was not for me to behold these wonders; I was content to admire the neat and becoming way she used to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> so as not to conceal the good shape of her head. And this wealth of hair was so glossy that when the screens of the west verandah were down, making a pleasant twilight there, or {{in the shade of the}} grove of fruit-trees near the house, it seemed to give out a golden light of its own.|$|E
60|$|RANDALL. Still, you <b>do</b> keep <b>it</b> <b>up,</b> old chap. Now, I {{assure you}} I have not an atom of jealousy in my disposition.|$|R
