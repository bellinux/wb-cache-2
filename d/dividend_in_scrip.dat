50|$|Though Pennsylvania had laws {{in place}} to keep {{industrial}} firms from owning company stores directly, these laws were easily evaded by having a separate corporation own the store; {{such was the case}} with J&L Steel and the Pittsburgh Mercantile Company. The original officers of the Pittsburgh Mercantile Company were the same as the officers of J&L. Arguments against the company store system, which had dated back to 1464 in England with what was there called the truck system, included the potential of abuse by paying workers <b>in</b> <b>scrip,</b> which could only be used at company's facilities. Arguments in favor included reducing the problems faced by immigrant workers that were unfamiliar with the language, customs, and problems of acquiring clothing, housing, and food, by setting up company housing and stores with payment <b>in</b> <b>scrip.</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{coal miners}} were unhappy about low wages paid <b>in</b> <b>scrip.</b> These were company-issued coupons redeemable {{only at the}} company store, where prices were exorbitant.

50|$|Following Reconstruction {{and white}} Democrats regaining {{control of the}} state government, in the late 1880s, freedmen worked hard on sugar cane {{plantations}} but were bound by many of the planters' practices.

50|$|During the Great Depression, Knoxville's six largest banks either failed or {{were forced}} into mergers. Construction fell 70%, and {{unemployment}} tripled.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} <b>dividend</b> changes <b>in</b> {{an emerging}} market: Thailand. We begin {{by considering the}} possible effects of the Thai corporate environment on dividend policy. We develop a theoretical model that considers {{the relationship between the}} strength of investor power and <b>dividends</b> <b>in</b> an agency cost/free cashflow framework. This allows us to consider the conditions for the outcome (positive relationship) or substitute (negative relationship) models, as discussed by La Porta et al. (2000). Our model also allows us to consider the expropriation hypothesis, in which the presence of large controlling shareholders may actually reduce outside investor power, leading to lower dividends. We then turn to our empirical analysis. Employing a large sample of companies that changed <b>dividends</b> <b>in</b> Thailand during the period 1996 – 2009, we test for the signaling, free cashflow and life-cycle hypotheses. A further contribution of our analysis is that we consider the impact of investor power and ownership on <b>dividends</b> <b>in</b> Thailand. Overall, we find little support for the signaling hypothesis, but we find considerable support for the free cashflow and life-cycle hypotheses. Our analysis of ownership variables suggests that increasing investor power (for example, high ownership concentration together with the presence of domestic institutional ownership) results <b>in</b> higher <b>dividends,</b> <b>in</b> support of the outcome model, rather than the substitution or expropriation models...|$|R
