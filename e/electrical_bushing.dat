50|$|The {{design of}} any <b>{{electrical}}</b> <b>bushing</b> {{must ensure that}} the electrical strength of the insulated material is able to withstand the penetrating 'electrical energy' passing through the conductor, via any highly stressed areas. It must also be capable of enduring, occasional and exceptional high voltage moments {{as well as the}} normal continual service withstand voltage, as it is the voltage that directs and controls the development of leakage paths and not current.|$|E
50|$|Maxwell's analogy was {{initially}} used merely to help explain electrical phenomena in more familiar mechanical terms. The work of Firestone, Trent and others moved the field well beyond this, looking to represent systems of multiple energy domains {{as a single}} system. In particular, designers started converting the mechanical parts of an electromechanical system to the electrical domain so that the whole system could be analyzed as an <b>electrical</b> circuit. Vannevar <b>Bush</b> was a pioneer {{of this kind of}} modelling in his development of analogue computers, and a coherent presentation of this method was presented in a 1925 paper by Clifford A. Nickle.|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundIn Ghana, fire {{incidents}} {{have become}} a regular occurrence, with thousands of lives {{and millions of dollars}} lost every year. Hardly a day passes without news of a fire outbreak in some part of Ghana, causing fear and panic among the people. This generates much discussion centering on rumors relating to politics, sabotage, misfortune, religious differences, etc. This article seeks to discuss the trend of fire incidents occurring in Ghana from 2000 to 2013 and the different ways to prevent these incidents. MethodsThe pattern of fire incidence in Ghana as a whole as well as in each region is discussed. The study took into consideration the causes, mechanisms, as well as preventive measures against the fire menace. Data were obtained from the head office of Ghana's national fire service. ResultsIt was noticed that in general the rate of fire incidence increased each year. This increase was attributed to several factors: rate of population growth and industrialization, unstable electricity, urbanization, negligence, illegal electrical connection, etc. The cause of fire was categorized into domestic, industrial, vehicular, institutional, <b>electrical,</b> commercial, <b>bush,</b> and others. Among these causes, domestic fire accounted for 41 % {{of the total number of}} fire incidents in the country. ConclusionFinally, this study presents several recommendations to help prevent and mitigate fire incidents in Ghana...|$|R
5000|$|After Hurricane Katrina {{battered}} the United States' Gulf {{coast in}} late 2005, the Chávez administration offered {{aid to the}} region. [...] Chávez offered tons of food, water, and a million barrels of extra petroleum to the U.S. He has also proposed to sell, at a significant discount, as many as [...] of fuel oil to poor communities that were hit by the hurricane, and offered mobile hospital units, medical specialists, and <b>electrical</b> generators. The <b>Bush</b> administration declined the Venezuelan offer according to activist Jesse Jackson, but United States Ambassador to Venezuela William Brownfield welcomed the offer of fuel assistance to the region, calling it [...] "a generous offer" [...] and saying [...] "When {{we are talking about}} one-to-five million dollars, that is real money. I want to recognize that and say, 'thank you.'" ...|$|R
