Although in 1880 the French engineer Jean-Marie-Anatole Gérard-Lescuyer observed oscillations in a DC powered coupled dynamo-motor system, the first practical oscillators were based on electric arcs, which were used for lighting in the 19th century. Ernst Lecher in 1888 showed that the current through an electric arc could be oscillatory. An oscillator was built by Elihu Thomson in 1892 by placing an LC tuned circuit in parallel with an electric arc and included a magnetic blowout. Independently, in the same year, George Francis Fitzgerald realized that if the damping resistance in a resonant circuit could be made zero or negative, the circuit would produce oscillations, and, unsuccessfully, tried to build a negative resistance oscillator with a dynamo, what would now be called a parametric oscillator. The arc oscillator was rediscovered and popularized by William Duddell in 1900. The current through an arc light is unstable and often produces hissing, humming or howling sounds. Duddell, a student at London Technical College, investigated this effect. He attached an LC circuit to the electrodes of an arc lamp, and the LC circuit tuned the frequency of the sound. Some of the energy was radiated as sound waves by the arc, producing a musical tone. Duddell demonstrated his oscillator before the London Institute of Electrical Engineers by sequentially connecting different tuned circuits across the arc to play the national anthem [...] "God Save the Queen". Duddell's [...] "singing arc" [...] did not generate frequencies above the audio range. In 1902 Danish physicists Valdemar Poulsen and P. O. Pederson were able to increase the frequency produced into the radio range, inventing the Poulsen arc radio transmitter, the first continuous wave radio transmitter, which was used through the 1920s.|$|E

But, Californians had been experiencing electricity’s marvels {{for more than two}} decades. Beginning in 1871, demonstrations of arc lighting by a professor at Saint Ignatius College periodically illuminated a section of Market Street facing the San Francisco campus. In 1878 city residents gazed upon an exhibition of electric lighting at the Mechanics Pavilion, made possible by manufacturers who displayed arc lamps and generating dynamos. These early novelties were put to practical use in September 1879, when the newly organized California Electric Light Company erected a small steam-powered generating plant in San Francisco to furnish downtown subscribers with arc lighting. San Francisco’s introductory displays of electricity, like others across the country, employed arc lamps, whose glaring brilliance, smoking carbon electrodes, and <b>hissing</b> <b>arcs,</b> restricted their use to outdoor areas or spacious interiors. Through the 1880 s, arc lamps were most often purchased for city streets, where they were mounted on colossal masts or towers, some soaring more than 100 feet, to light entire blocks.
