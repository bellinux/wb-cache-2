40|$|Ethanol extract {{of natural}} dye {{obtained}} from the flower of Cordia Sebestena applied on bleached cotton fabric {{have been subjected to}} pre, post and simultaneous mordanting with selective mordants using myrobolan (harda) and other mordants (metallic salts). It is observed that the application of 1 - 3 % of FeSO 4,Al 2 (SO 4) 3 and SnCl 2 have been identified as three most prospective mordanting system. The study on the effect of dyeing process variables on surface colour strength indicates that the 60 min. dyeing time, 60 °C dyeing temperature, 1 : 20 material-to-liquor ratio, 3 % mordant concentration, 5 % dye concentration and 5 gpl common salt are the optimum values among the different fibre- mordant system studied. This study also includes the comparison of mordanting techniques as well as <b>dying</b> <b>properties</b> and visualizes the effect of myrobolan and metallic mordants, colour fastness to washing, rubbing, light fastness and perspiration of cotton fabrics dyed with and without mordants have also been studied.

40|$|Abstract: The <b>dying</b> <b>properties</b> of fabrics with Chaenomelis Fructus extract {{were studied}} through an {{investigation}} of the characteristic of Chaenomelis Fructus colorants, the effect of dyeing conditions (dye temperature, dyeing concentration, and times on dye uptakes), effect of mordant, effect of UV irradiation, and color change in addition, antimicrobial ability and deodorant ability were estimated. In the UV-Visible spectrum, the wavelength of maximum absorption of Chaenomelis Fructus extract was 280 nm and showed that tannin is the major pigment component. From the increase of absorbance by UV irradiation, it was assumed that catechol tannin color was developed through UV irradiation. An increased dyeing concentration resulted in a larger dye uptake. Dye uptake increased as the dyeing time and temperature increased. Chaenomelis Fructus extract showed relatively good affinity to silk than cotton. Mordant, Fe and Cu were effective to increase the dye uptake of cotton fabric in addition, the dye uptake of silk fabric mordanted with Fe and K improved. UV irradiation let the color of dyed fabrics develop regardless of the UV irradiation stage however, UV irradiation on the dyed fabric was more effective than on the extract for the color development. Dyed silk fabric showed very good antimicrobial abilities of 99. 9 % in addition, deodorant ability improved in the fabric dyed with Chaenomelis Fructus extract...|$|E

50|$|In law, an heir is {{a person}} who is {{entitled}} to receive a share of the deceased's (the person who <b>died)</b> <b>property,</b> subject to the rules of inheritance in the jurisdiction of which the deceased was a citizen or where the deceased (decedent) <b>died</b> or owned <b>property</b> at the time of death. A person does not become an heir before the death of the deceased, since the exact identity of the persons entitled to inherit is determined only then. Members of ruling noble or royal houses expected to become heirs are called heirs apparent if first in line and incapable of being displaced from inheriting by another claim; otherwise, they are heirs presumptive. There is a further concept of joint inheritance, pending renunciation by all but one, which is called coparceny.|$|R
