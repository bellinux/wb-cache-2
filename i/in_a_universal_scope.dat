40|$|In {{this chapter}} we review {{some aspects of}} X-ray binaries, {{particularly}} those presenting steady jets, i. e. microquasars. Because of their proximity and similarities with active galactic nuclei (AGN), galactic jet sources are unique laboratories to test astrophysical theories of <b>a</b> <b>universal</b> <b>scope.</b> Due to recent observational progress made with {{the new generation of}} gamma-ray imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes and in view of the upcoming km 3 -size neutrino detectors, we focus especially on the possible high-energy gamma radiation and neutrino emission. In connection with this, we also comment about astrophysical jets present in young stellar objects, and we briefly discuss similarities and differences with extragalactic AGN and gamma-ray bursters...|$|R

2500|$|Film critic Emanuel Levy graded {{the film}} a B+, calling it an [...] "emotionally heart-rending study of generational gap–but also continuity–between Chinese {{mothers and their}} Chinese-American daughters" [...] and a {{visually}} well-done propaganda for [...] "cultural diversity". However, he also found it too long with [...] "too many stories and [...] flashbacks" [...] and too mainstream and broad to be an art film, especially when it was screened in [...] "prestigious film festivals." [...] Matt Hinrichs from DVD Talk rated the film {{four and a half}} stars out of five, commenting, [...] "Despite the cultural and gender-specific nature of the story, [...] {{there are a lot of}} overriding themes explored here (such as the daughters fearing that they're repeating their moms' mistakes) that have <b>a</b> <b>universal</b> <b>scope</b> and appeal." ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{concerns}} {{itself with}} the values which make up what has been labelled 'ethical cosmopolitanism–ï¿½that which entails <b>a</b> <b>universal</b> <b>scope</b> of ethical concern. Conceptions of this ethic have underpinned {{the development of a}} 'global civil society' and associated humanitarian and activist campaigns. However, such cosmopolitan campaigns have illustrated {{the ways in which the}} dismissals of difference and importance of embeddedness have caused suffering to the supposed beneficiaries of such campaigns. This is because of the unrecognised power relations that exist between moral agents, which result in 'unequal exchanges', that is, the exchange of physical, material and mental resources from positions of unequal negotiating positions, driven by power differentials and hierarchy. A theory of the 'equal exchange' is developed upon which to base alternative cosmopolitan practices. Such a theory is grounded in Anarchist thought, which, it is argued, provides the most stringent philosophical underpinning for such a cosmopolitan theory...|$|R

40|$|The early Japanese Christian leader, Uchimura Kanzo, {{experienced}} Shinto {{a century}} ago as disturbingly polytheistic. There {{is no reason to}} doubt the sincerity of his experience and thought. But in my view, there already existed <b>in</b> his time <b>a</b> monotheist Shinto. It later changed character, but I argue that Shinto is still an inclusive, narrow monotheist religious cult. In modern Shinto, divine power includes some and suppresses other cosmic powers. An Emperor-centered monotheism with <b>a</b> <b>universal</b> <b>scope</b> emerged during early modernity. Shinto retained its inclusive monotheism after the Shinto Directive of 1945, but the privatization of emperor veneration has reduced Shinto to a norm for the Japanese people, even if a potential universality is still expressed. Postmodern Shinto dresses its universality in individual and varied coats, transcending the boundaries of Japanese nationality. New Shinto is in my view not polytheistic. However, its inclusive, monotheist universalism is transformed onto a purely spiritual and individualized level...|$|R
40|$|Researchers {{worldwide}} {{have been}} actively seeking {{for the most}} robust and powerful solutions to detect and classify key events (or highlights) in various sports domains. Most approaches have employed manual heuristics that model the typical pattern of audio-visual features within particular sport events To avoid manual observation and knowledge, machine-learning {{can be used as}} an alternative approach. To bridge the gaps between these two alternatives, an attempt is made to integrate statistics into heuristic models during highlight detection in our investigation. The models can be designed with a modest amount of domain-knowledge, making them less subjective and more robust for different sports. We have also successfully used <b>a</b> <b>universal</b> <b>scope</b> of detection and a standard set of features that can be applied for different sports that include soccer, basketball and Australian football.

40|$|<b>In</b> Sweden, <b>a</b> {{person with}} severe {{substance}} abuse or a severe mental disorder may {{be committed to}} compulsory care according to two different legislations. Both acts include an option of providing involuntary care outside the premises of an institution - care in other forms (COF) and compulsory community care (CCC), respectively. As co-occurring disorders are commonplace many individuals {{will be subject to}} both types of compulsory care. The structures of both legislations and their provisions for compulsory care in the community are therefore scrutinized and compared. Based on a distinction between "least restrictive" or "preventative" schemes the article compares COF and CCC in order to determine whether they serve different purposes. The analysis shows that COF and CCC both share the same avowed aims of reducing time spent in confinement and facilitating transition to voluntary care and the community. But they also serve different purposes, something which is reflected in disparate scopes, eligibility criteria, rules, and practices. Overall, COF was found to be a more "least restrictive" and CCC a more "preventative" scheme. The distinction is associated with COF being an established part of legislation on compulsory care for substance abuse with <b>a</b> <b>universal</b> <b>scope</b> and CCC being a recent addition to compulsory psychiatric care legislation with a selective character...|$|R
