500|$|The NBPA and {{the owners}} {{returned}} to negotiate again on August 31 {{with a sense of}} urgency. No specifics were disclosed although both sides hoped to meet again soon. [...] "Everyone loses if we don't reach an agreement, that's something that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>has</b> always been understood," [...] said union president Derek Fisher. [...] "I will say we are not apart in terms of an agreed urgency on getting a deal done," [...] said NBA deputy commissioner Adam Silver.|$|E
500|$|It surpassed {{anything}} that I ever thought. [...] I didn't {{ever think that}} I {{should be in the}} cathedral with the Queen and all the dignitaries that were there. [...] And the singing, the organ, the Queen, just everything and everybody. [...] It's really been out of this world. [...] Just to hear Zadok the Priest, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>has</b> lifted me to Cloud Nine, because it's something that I love. [...] And to hear that and to have the Queen pass so close to me. [...] And yes, she smiled. [...] She smiled at me.|$|E
500|$|The cinema posters for {{the film}} stated [...] "Sean Connery IS James Bond", to {{distance}} the Eon-produced picture from the independent Casino Royale, which had been released two months earlier. However, during the production, Connery {{announced that it would}} be his last film as Bond, leaving Broccoli to tell Alan Whicker, [...] "it won't be the last Bond under any circumstances—with all due respect to Sean, who <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>has</b> been certainly the best man to play this part. We will, in our own way, try to continue the Bond series for the audience because it's too important".|$|E

500|$|In an interview, Kiefer Sutherland {{revealed}} that Redemption {{was inspired by}} the Rwandan Genocide and the U.S. Government's response to it. [...] "The truth is, {{one of the things that}} was said in the prequel, which <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>has</b> been a massive problem with how the Western world has dealt with Africa, no one can justify going there, because they have no viable reason– meaning oil or money. Here [...] response is a human one. We can stop a genocide. I think that that's something that Bill Clinton apologized for not doing with Rwanda and we centered a show around that." ...|$|E
500|$|On Slant Magazines [...] "Best of the Aughts" [...] list, {{the album}} was placed at numbersix out of one-hundred. Reflecting on the album's reception, Chater felt it was well {{received}} because [...] "It's light-hearted and fun to listen to and there is depth there as well. There are some sadder moments that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>has</b> made it resonate and made it last. It does sound like a 23 year old kid in his bedroom making a record to me, but you can hear that innocence and joy in the discovery of finding all those sounds. So {{that was kind of}} infectious for people." [...] In October 2010, it was listed at No.10 in the book, 100 Best Australian Albums. Philip Sherburne, writing for Rhapsody, said that [...] "along with DJ Shadow's Endtroducing, this is one of plunderphonic music's greatest LPs." [...] The album was also included in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.|$|E
500|$|The third pod of {{the season}} [...] "ties {{together}} [...] thematically", taking the characters into the virtual world of the Framework, where their lives {{are different from the}} real world. This explores [...] "what if" [...] scenarios for many of the characters by showing who they may have been if a major regret of their life was changed, hence the pod's title, Agents of Hydra. This continues the season's focus on the nature of identity and reality, having [...] "payoff to all the reflection on the past" [...] such as Mack's tragic loss of his daughter and Fitz's troubled relationship with his father. Bennet called the pod [...] "very relevant. It's definitely a theme that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>has</b> been kind of hopping around in pop culture at the moment. But it's kind of like a fun Marvel take on that. For all those people who wished to see these characters in a different light, {{this is going to be}} the time for that to happen." [...] Whedon felt that this storyline would not be interesting early in a series, but is rewarding after spending [...] "80-plus episodes with these characters".|$|E
