5|$|After her {{training}} {{exercises in the}} Atlantic and the Pacific were finished, New Mexico was overhauled and modernized at the Philadelphia Harbor by the Navy from March 1931 to January 1933. The overhaul included the replacement of her turbo-electric <b>drive</b> <b>with</b> more conventional geared turbines, which were made by Curtis. In addition, New Mexico received eight 5-inch/25 caliber anti-aircraft guns, replacing the four 3-inch/50 caliber guns that had been previously installed. After the overhaul, she returned the Pacific to continue training exercises {{and the development of}} tactical operations.|$|E
5|$|After the kickoff, Florida State went three-and-out and punted back to Virginia Tech. The Hokies {{began their}} second {{possession}} of the quarter at their 39-yard line and started the <b>drive</b> <b>with</b> five consecutive running plays, advancing 28 yards in the process. Tech then switched to its passing offense, throwing four consecutive passes. Three were complete, and the final one, a 21-yard toss from Taylor to Wilson, ended with the running back carrying {{the ball into the}} end zone. The score capped a nine-play, 61-yard drive that grew the Hokies' advantage to 18 points, 35–17.|$|E
40|$|Number of credits: 4 COURSE STATUS IN THE CURRICULUM: Optionally for the {{students}} specialty Industrial Engineering Bachelor-Eng program of the English language Faculty of Engineering.

5|$|Because Clemson {{received}} {{the ball to}} begin the game, Georgia Tech {{received the}} ball to begin the second half. Chris Tanner returned the kickoff to the Tech 29-yard line, and the Yellow Jackets began the first offensive drive of the half. Jones opened the <b>drive</b> <b>with</b> a 16-yard run, then the Yellow Jackets converted a fourth down to continue down the field. Six plays after the fourth-down conversion, Tech quarterback Nesbitt ran {{into the end zone}} for a touchdown. The following extra point gave Tech a 23–13 lead with 9:12 remaining.|$|E
5|$|Clemson scored {{first on}} a 30-yard pass, leading 6–0 {{after the first}} quarter. From then on the Gators dominated, winning 27 to 6.

40|$|Abstract:- A {{comparison}} between time optimal control and minimum energy control for electrical drives is performed. The <b>drives</b> <b>with</b> DC, PMSM or induction motors are considered. A simple strategy using the currents as control variables is proposed. A unified theoretical approach for optimal control of electrical <b>drives</b> <b>with</b> different motor types is indicated. Simulation and experimental results are presented...|$|R
5|$|Due to {{an injury}} to Roethlisberger, Byron Leftwich took over as quarterback in the second half. Leftwich {{completed}} a 50-yard pass to Nate Washington on the opening drive of the third quarter; the Steelers capped the <b>drive</b> <b>with</b> a Willie Parker touchdown run. Pittsburgh extended their lead in the final quarter with a touchdown pass from Leftwich to Santonio Holmes. The Redskins gained 124yards in the final quarter, but were unable to score. The Steelers' 17point win took their record to 6–2 on the season.|$|E

5|$|In the {{overtime}} period, Alabama was {{on offense}} first. McCarron opened their <b>drive</b> <b>with</b> {{a pair of}} incompletions to Richardson. After a five-yard substitution penalty and a five-yard quarterback sack by Sam Montgomery, Foster missed a 52-yard field goal. On LSU's possession, Ware had a three-yard rush and then Ford had a 15-yard run to give the Tigers a first down from the Alabama seven. After a pair of runs that netted a loss of one yard, on third down, Alleman kicked a 25-yard field goal to give LSU the 9–6 victory.|$|E

5|$|Pittsburgh's first inter-conference {{opponent}} of the season was the Philadelphia Eagles. The Steelers scored on their first <b>drive,</b> <b>with</b> a Jeff Reed field goal. The Eagles offense drove 85yards {{to take the lead}} on a touchdown pass from Donovan McNabb to Correll Buckhalter. The Eagles defense sacked Ben Roethlisberger eight times throughout the game, two of which resulted in fumbles. Bryant McFadden intercepted his second pass of the season which allowed Reed to add his second field goal of the day—this one from 53-yards. The field goal brought the half time score to 10–6.|$|E
5|$|The Colts put {{together}} one last <b>drive</b> <b>with</b> {{less than two}} minutes left. The standout player was receiver Raymond Berry, who caught three passes for 62 yards, the last one for 22 yards to the New York 13-yard line. With seven seconds left in regulation, Steve Myhra kicked a 20-yard field goal to tie the score 17–17, sending a game to overtime {{for the first time in}} NFL history.|$|E
5|$|The Steelers {{fell behind}} the New England Patriots {{less than three}} minutes into the first quarter, after an {{interception}} of Ben Roethlisberger was driven to the endzone. The Steelers came back with 2:55 remaining in the initial quarter to convert on a 20-yard Jeff Reed field goal. The Patriots extended their lead to seven points with a 29-yard field goal in the second quarter. Pittsburgh drove 63yards on nine plays, capping their <b>drive</b> <b>with</b> a touchdown pass to Santonio Holmes {{to tie the game}} at ten points at the halfway point.|$|E

5|$|The {{second quarter}} began with Georgia Tech facing first down, in {{possession}} of the ball at the Clemson 18-yard line. On the first play of the quarter, Dwyer gained 10 yards and a first down with a running play to the Clemson eight-yard line. Three plays later, Dwyer completed the Yellow Jackets' scoring <b>drive</b> <b>with</b> a run into the end zone. The touchdown and extra point gave Georgia Tech its first lead of the game, 10–7, with 13:30 remaining.|$|E
5|$|With a solid {{lead and}} time running {{down in the}} game, Georgia Tech began a {{sequence}} of running plays intended to keep the game clock running while gaining ground. From their 25-yard line, the Yellow Jackets gained 38 yards on seven plays, advancing into Clemson territory in the process. Facing fourth down at the Clemson 37-yard line, the Yellow Jackets attempted to gain a first down rather than kick a long field goal. When they were stopped short of the first-down line, Clemson's offense returned to the field. Spiller again drove the Tigers down the field, opening the <b>drive</b> <b>with</b> a 54-yard run on its first play. Three plays later, Ellington capitalized the <b>drive</b> <b>with</b> a one-yard run for a tying touchdown. The following extra point gave Clemson a one-point lead, 34–33, with 6:11 remaining in the game.|$|E
5|$|A {{week after}} their loss to LSU, Alabama {{traveled}} to Starkville and defeated their long-time rival, the Mississippi State Bulldogs 24–7. After {{a pair of}} missed field goals, one from 19-yard by Cade Foster and the second from 31-yards by Jeremy Shelley, Alabama scored their first {{points in the second}} quarter. Eddie Lacy capped a five-play, 52-yard <b>drive</b> <b>with</b> a two-yard touchdown run to give the Crimson Tide a 7–0 lead. Later in the quarter Derek DePasquale missed a 41-yard field goal attempt for the Bulldogs, but on the ensuing Alabama possession Cameron Lawrence intercepted an AJ McCarron pass and returned it to the Alabama four-yard line. However, the Alabama defense held the Bulldogs to only a field goal attempt which was then missed from 29-yards by Brian Egan to preserve a 7–0 halftime lead for the Crimson Tide.|$|E
