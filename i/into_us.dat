5|$|In some cases, {{travelers}} and the aircraft can clear customs and immigration at the departure airport. As {{one example of}} this, are airports in Canada with United States border preclearance facilities. This allows flights from those airports to fly <b>into</b> <b>US</b> airports {{that do not have}} customs and immigration facilities. Luggage from such flights can also be transferred to a final destination in the U.S. through the airport of entry.|$|E

5|$|We {{were trying}} to avoid that whole game of who gets in first with the reviews.

5|$|As {{the battle}} around Taechon {{dragged into the}} night of November 26, the ROK 11th Infantry Regiment on the division's right became disorganized. Brigadier General Paik Sun Yup of the ROK 1st Infantry Division soon brought up the 15th Infantry Regiment from his reserve to relieve the 11th Infantry Regiment. After {{receiving}} news on the Chinese attack against the 25th Division across the Kuryong River, Paik had also directed his division to defend against the upcoming Chinese counteroffensive. As the morning came on November 27, the Chinese troops around Taechon did not stop their assault even under punishing UN air strikes, {{and some of the}} attacks spilled <b>into</b> <b>US</b> 24th Infantry Division's area. Upon noticing their flank was buckling, the US 24th Infantry Division and the US 35th Infantry Regiment started the retreat southward to the Ch'ongch'on River.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the morning}} of 1 September had passed, reports coming <b>into</b> <b>US</b> 2nd Division {{headquarters}} {{made it clear that}} North Koreans had penetrated to the northâ€“south Changnyong-Yongsan road and cut the division in two; the 38th and 23d Infantry Regiments with the bulk of the division artillery in the north were separated from the division headquarters and the 9th Infantry Regiment in the south. Division commander Major General Laurence B. Keiser decided that this situation made it advisable to control and direct the divided division as two special forces. Accordingly, he placed the division artillery commander, Brigadier General Loyal M. Haynes, in command of the northern group. Southward, in the Yongsan area, Keiser placed Brigadier General Joseph S. Bradley, Assistant Division Commander, in charge of the 9th Infantry Regiment, the 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion, most of the 72nd Tank Battalion, and other miscellaneous units of the division. This southern grouping was known as Task Force Bradley.|$|E
5|$|U.S. Route 70 and U.S. Route 54 {{traverses}} {{through the}} north and south ends of the city. At {{the south end of the}} city, White Sands Boulevard is a major named street that merges <b>into</b> <b>U.S.</b> Route 54/Charles T. Lee Memorial Relief Route, running south to El Paso, Texas. In the south part of the city, U.S. Route 70 splits from U.S. Route 54 in a southwestern direction towards Holloman Air Force Base, White Sands National Monument, White Sands Missile Range, and Las Cruces. At the north end of the city, White Sands Boulevard and the Charles T. Lee Memorial Relief Route become a merged U.S. Route 54 and U.S. Route 70 running north to Tularosa. U.S. Route 82 starts at the same point and runs east to Cloudcroft and the mountain communities of Otero County, and then to Artesia. Meanwhile, in Tularosa, U.S. 70 and U.S. 54 both split in which U.S. 70 heads east through the mountains, and towards Ruidoso and Roswell, while U.S. 54 heads north towards Carrizozo and keeps going north until it heads east again starting in Vaughn.|$|E
5|$|US 50 {{was created}} in 1926 {{as part of the}} {{original}} U.S. Highway system. The original route planned in 1925 ran from Wadsworth, Nevada east to Annapolis, Maryland along several auto trails including the Lincoln Highway, Midland Trail, and the National Old Trails Road. The final 1926 plan had US 50 running from Sacramento, California east to Annapolis with a gap in west Utah that was bridged by running the route north via Salt Lake City before rerouting it to U.S. Route 6 in the 1950s. US 50 was extended west from Sacramento to San Francisco in the 1930s, replacing U.S. Route 48; this was reversed in 1964 when Interstate 580 replaced much of the route between the two cities. In addition, US 50 was extended east from Annapolis to Ocean City prior in 1949, replacing a portion of U.S. Route 213. US 50 had two split configurations <b>into</b> <b>U.S.</b> Route 50N and U.S. Route 50S, one in Kansas and another in Ohio and West Virginia; both of these instances have been removed.|$|E
