The bill of Bankruptcy of <b>Natural</b> <b>Persons</b> in Lithuania was proposed as early as in spring 2009 (No. XIP- 450, 24. 03. 2009). The bill met with a considerable amount of criticism and was postponed for further improvement. By decree No. 413 of April 7, 2010, the Government of the Republic of Lithuania approved the concept of the {{bankruptcy of}} <b>natural</b> <b>persons</b> of the Republic of Lithuania. The principal goal of the concept was to consolidate the main provisions of the future law. The Law of Bankruptcy of <b>Natural</b> <b>Persons</b> of the Republic of Lithuania has come into effect since March 1, 2013. The authors of the article overview the concept and models of bankruptcy of <b>natural</b> <b>persons</b> and introduce the advantages and shortcomings of the institute of bankruptcy of <b>natural</b> <b>persons.</b> Based on scientific sources of Lithuanian and foreign authors, the article offers a theoretically systemized version of the main reasons determining the bankruptcy of <b>natural</b> <b>persons.</b> The reasons fall into two categories – economic and social.

40|$|There {{has been}} {{considerable}} expansion of {{trade in services}} in recent years. However, there are numerous nontariff barriers to such trade, especially when such trade occurs through the temporary movement of the service provider to the overseas market or the movement of <b>natural</b> <b>persons.</b> Many developing countries have significant potential for exporting many services through temporary movement of professionals, semi-skilled, and unskilled workers. The General Agreement on Trade in Services thus far has limited implications for liberalizing service trade through the movement of <b>natural</b> <b>persons.</b> This paper suggests ways to strengthen the overall GATS framework through greater transparency and specificity in the commitments on movement of <b>natural</b> <b>persons.</b> It also proposes the introduction of multilateral guidelines on regulations that restrict service trade through the movement of <b>natural</b> <b>persons.</b> Introduction World trade in services has expanded considerably in recent years.
