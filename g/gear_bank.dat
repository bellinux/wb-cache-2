The entrepreneurs that run property {{companies are}} responsible for initiating development projects and managing them. The risk incurred by participants in the development process, such as banks and construction firms, is related not only to the risk of the project being undertaken but also to the financial risk associated with the property company that initiates and manages the project. This paper attempts to develop a taxonomy of property companies, for consideration by decision makers in the construction industry in assessing the risk of being involved in a project.

40|$|This {{paper is}} the story of success and failure in the {{financial}} markets, the markets for goods and services and in politics. It is a difficult story to tell because the crisis had many causes, but the focus here is on three main factors. First, the incentives that contributed to a credit-fuelled bubble, especially in property markets. Monetary and regulatory policies feature prominently {{in this part of the}} story. Second, because the housing bubble alone cannot explain the magnitude of the subsequent events, gearing in the financial sector, which affected asset markets unrelated to sub-prime mortgages will be examined. These developments are explained by reference to private financial sector decisions, including the role of the shadow-banking sector, and their regulatory backdrop. Finally, an answer will be sought to the question of how highly <b>geared</b> <b>banks</b> first became fragile and then failed with such dire consequences for the economy that massive policy intervention had become essential. The consequences of these large policy interventions and the international tensions caused by them are also explored.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the attempt to}} achieve balanced economic growth in India. The process {{is viewed as a}} transition of society from a traditional stage to one characterized by industrialization and economic growth, and which involves major economic, social and political changes. It specifically deals with the Indian banking system and its structural development since independence as a means to hasten economic growth. These changes in the banking system, through social control, and eventually nationalization of the major commercial banks in India,, illustrate the increasing role of the State in <b>gearing</b> the <b>banking</b> sector towards meeting the goals of national economic planning. The above events are related to the struggle between the moderates and those who advocate a more socialist approach to solving the economic and social problems in India...|$|R
50|$|The Prince P.16 was {{a radical}} design by Captain A.G. Forsyth {{who was the}} Fairey company's chief engine designer. The Prince was an H engine, similar in layout to the Napier Rapier and later Napier Sabre. In an H engine, the {{cylinders}} are arranged vertically as two separate banks, each resembling a flat engine, and {{each with its own}} crankshaft, but sharing a common block. The crankshafts are then geared together to drive a common output shaft. While sharing a similar configuration, the Prince engine was more like a double-flat 8 engine, two engines sharing a common block, since rather than gearing the two crankshafts together, each had its own output shaft, driving contra-rotating propellers via separate shafts and <b>gears.</b> Each <b>bank</b> of cylinders could be shut down in flight to drive only one propeller, an idea that was reused much later in the Armstrong Siddeley Double Mamba turboprop. The engine was test flown in a Fairey Battle.|$|R

Descriptive research design has been used for this research to describe the characteristic of the banks’ compliance to corporate governance and the impact on its ROE. Data from all ten listed local banks in Malaysia were obtained to measure against four independent variables, ie. the proportion of non-executive directors, the proportion of institutional investors, the level of gearing and the concentration of ownership. It was found that the higher the level of <b>gearing</b> of the <b>bank,</b> the higher is the monitoring role of the lenders and the better would be the bank’s ROE. Future research can also compare pre and post-financial crisis corporate governance practices and its impact on Banks’ financial performances...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to provide an {{analysis}} on the relationship between Information Technology (IT) usage, CRM and performance of bank (state bank group) in Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India. Most of the banks in INDIA are <b>geared</b> for comprehensive <b>banking</b> solutions with extensive branch networks. Empirical data collection was done in the year 2012 and analyzed with the theoretical data. A sample of 18 branches was selected using the non-probability sampling technique. Perceptions of branch managers, staff members and customers were collected using a survey method. All 18 branches selected are of an equivalent grade according to the grading set by the bank. Three different types of questionnaires were designed for branch managers, branch staff and customers. Both structured and semi structured questions were included in the questionnaires with 7 point likert scale. Using bivariate correlation and linear regression, data analysis was done. The linear relationship  between  variables  was  measured  by  using  Pearson’s  correlation  coefficient...|$|R

The bank branches done from a perspective of a leading commercial bank in Sri Lanka. Most of the banks in Sri Lanka are <b>geared</b> for comprehensive <b>banking</b> solutions with extensive branch networks. A total of 228 questionnaires were distributed on random basis to 57 selected banking Branches that are located within the area. A total of 192 completed questionnaires were returned, however, only 134 questionnaires were usable. The population of the study was first divided into sub-population based on sections which comprises of; i. Accounts opening ii. Cash / Counter iii. Loan / Credit and Recovery iv. Pawning Management functional area at each branch. The questionnaire was distributed to the staff at the four functional areas of the each branch. Data analysis was done using bivariate correlation and linear regression. Pearson’s correlation coefficient was used to measure the linear relationship between variables. The analysis revealed that both IT Usage Sophistication, IT management Sophistication has a positive linear relationship with AISQ at bank branches...|$|R

40|$|The MAREANO (Marine AREA {{database}} for NOrwegian coast and sea areas) mapping programme includes acquisition of multibeambathymetry and backscatter data {{together with a}} comprehensive, integrated biological and geological sampling programme. Equipment used includes underwater video, box corer, grab, epibenthic sled and beam trawl. Habitat maps are produced by combining information on landscapes, landscape elements, sediment types and biological communities. Video observations provide information about the megafauna diversity of large ([1 cm) epifauna and bottom types, whilst bottom samples describe the composition of epifauna, hyperfauna (crustaceans living in {{the upper part of}} the sediment and/or swimming just above the substratum) and infauna, and sediment composition. In this study, two biological data sets are used to study fauna response to environmental heterogeneity at two different spatial scales: (1) broad scale, megahabitat (1 – 10 s km), based on information about megafauna taxa observed during video surveys in the Nordland/Troms area, (2) fine scale, mesohabitat (10 s m- 1 km), based on information about species composition documented with video records and bottom sampling <b>gear</b> from the <b>bank</b> ‘‘Tromsøflaket’’. In general, the highest diversity is found on bottoms with mixed substrates indicating that substratum heterogeneity is very important for the biodiversity at both scales. The number of taxa shows a maximum at depths between 200 and 700 m followed by a gradual decrease down to 2, 200 m. At the broad scale, multibeamdata provides a variety of terrain variables that indicate environmental variation (e. g. exposure to currents, interpreted substrates). This analysis identifies six fauna groups associated to specific landscape elements. Diversity of megafauna shows a strong correlation with number of bottom types occurring along video transects. It is highest at the shelf break and decreased with depth on the slope in parallel with a decrease in habitat heterogeneity and temperature. At a fine scale, six biotopes are identified based on megafauna composition with habitat characteristics ranging from homogenous muddy bottom, biotope 1, to the most heterogeneous bottom with[20...|$|R
