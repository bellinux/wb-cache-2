40|$|California is {{the largest}} {{agricultural}} producer in the United States and local dairy industry produces 21. 5 % of the national milk supply. There are 1470 dairies, 1789 million dairy cows and a total annual milk production of 18 million metric tons. The amount of dead cows to be disposed of is remarkable in intensive farming and it increases in periods of extreme weather events, such as drought in California. Composting of bovine mortalities is prohibited in California {{as a means of}} <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> <b>carcases,</b> and can only be done under an emergency declaration. Composting is an effective disposal method that can aid in carcase disposal, especially during an emergency. The objective {{of this study was to}} use screened dairy manure solids (SDMS) as the composting amendment for carcase decomposition. Our hypothesis was that temperatures would be sufficiently high and of sufficient duration to destroy most bacteria within the carcases and that the leachate from the carcases would penetrate less than one foot into the underlying soil. No significant amounts of leachate were noted in the collection pipes buried beneath either soil type. Total bacterial counts exceeded 1 × 106 CFU/ml in approximately 19 % of the swab samples from the sample collection pipes. The sandy soil had higher bacterial counts than the clay soil. Results of these trials indicate that adult dairy cows can be successfully composted without significant impact on the nearby surrounding environment. The basic hypotheses have been verified by the simple and multiple regression and chi-square non-parametric test. © 2017 The Author(s) ...|$|E

This led to a range of health issues until finally, in 1839, when a dysentery outbreak killed five children in one day, Governor Gawler forbid bathing, clothes washing and the <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> animal <b>carcases</b> in the Torrens within [...] of town.

40|$|Poultry {{production}} facilities {{must deal with}} the <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> farm mortalities on a daily basis. Death loss in animal production is an unfortunate reality that requires appropriate handling {{to prevent the spread}} of disease, the potential for odor and pest problems, and the possible contamination of surface and ground water. A typical flock of 25, 000 broilers averaging 5 % total mortality will produce approximately 1. 6 tons <b>of</b> <b>carcases</b> during a 6 week growing period. This can represent a significant carcass disposal challenge over the life of the flock. A convenient, sanitary, rapid disposal system is critical for mortality management to be practical and effective and meet state and local regulations. Georgia law requires that a disposal system be approved by the Georgia Department of Agriculture (GDA) {{to prevent the spread of}} disease organisms from dead poultry to healthy flocks. <b>Disposal</b> <b>of</b> mortality is also regulated by the Environmental Protection Division of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources to protect air and water quality. The safe and appropriate management of poultry mortality begins with selection of the method best suited for your poultry operation. Each method has advantages and disadvantages.

Regardless of the method used, Georgia law requires <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> dead poultry within 24 hours of death or discovery...|$|R

40|$|Assuming an {{exponential}} decay model (EDM) for pH decline {{as a function}} of temperature, ideal shortening (i. e. neither hot nor cold shortening) for an individual carcase occurs if and only if that carcase's model parameters fall within a specific sub-region of three dimensional space.

This is particularly so if the EDMs are fitted separately to each sampled carcase but also remains the case, to a lesser extent, if the models are fitted jointly using random effects modelling. A preferred estimate is based on the probability that an independently selected carcase has model parameters within the specific region, based on the distribution of the EMD parameters.

40|$|Abstract Background Children’s stool {{disposal}} {{is often}} overlooked in sanitation programs of any country. Unsafe <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> children’s stool makes children susceptible to many diseases that transmit through faecal-oral route. Therefore, the study {{aims to examine}} the magnitude <b>of</b> unsafe <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> children’s stools in India, the factors associated with it and finally its association with childhood diarrhea. Methods Data from {{the third round of}} the National Family Health Survey (NFHS- 3) conducted in 2005 – 06 is used to carry out the analysis. The binary logistic regression model is used to examine the factors associated with unsafe <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> children’s stool. Binary logistic regression is also used to examine the association between unsafe <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> children’s stool and childhood diarrhea. Result Overall, stools of 79 % of children in India were disposed of unsafely. The urban-rural gap in the unsafe <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> children’s stool was wide. Mother’s illiteracy and lack of exposure to media, the age of the child, religion and caste/tribe of the household head, wealth index, access to toilet facility and urban-rural residence were statistically associated with unsafe <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> stool. The odds of diarrhea in children whose stools were disposed of unsafely was estimated to be 11 % higher (95 % CI: 1. 01 – 1. 21) than that of children whose stools were disposed of safely. An increase in the unsafe <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> children’s stool in the community also increased the risk of diarrhea in children. Conclusion We found significant statistical association between children’s stool disposal and diarrhea. Therefore, gains in reduction of childhood diarrhea can be achieved in India through the complete elimination <b>of</b> unsafe <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> children’s stools.
