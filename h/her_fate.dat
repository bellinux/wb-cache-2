5|$|Study of {{the wreck}} {{also showed that}} {{restarting}} the engines to provide power increased the stresses placed on the hull, adding to the flooding. Once power was then lost, {{it was impossible to}} prevent the ship from sinking — <b>her</b> <b>fate</b> was more the result of design flaws than of the actions of her captain.|$|E
5|$|The priests {{catch the}} snake {{and prepare to}} kill her, but are stopped by the goddess Kwan Im, who tells the stunned pursuers that the snake is {{pregnant}} and thus must not be killed.

5|$|Zenobia was a cultured monarch and fostered an {{intellectual}} environment in her court, which {{was open to}} scholars and philosophers. She was tolerant toward her subjects, and protected religious minorities. The queen maintained a stable administration which governed a multicultural, multiethnic empire. Zenobia died after 274, and many tales have been recorded about <b>her</b> <b>fate.</b> Her rise and fall have inspired historians, artists and novelists, {{and she is a}} national hero in Syria.|$|E

5|$|Eos– The Goddess of Dawn and {{the sister}} of Helios. Eos told Kratos of the machinations of Morpheus, who had taken {{advantage}} of her brother's disappearance. When Kratos found Eos in the Caves of Olympus, she advised him to find the Primordial Fires and free Helios' loyal Fire Steeds, as they could find the Sun God. She also provided him with the magical ability, Light of Dawn. She did not appear in God of War III, leaving <b>her</b> <b>fate</b> unknown. The character was voiced by Erin Torpey in Chains of Olympus.|$|E
5|$|Goldilocks's fate {{varies in}} the many retellings: in some versions, she runs into the forest, in some she is almost eaten by the bears but her mother rescues her, in some she vows {{to be a good}} child, and in some she returns home. Whatever <b>her</b> <b>fate,</b> Goldilocks fares better than Southey's vagrant old woman who, in his opinion, {{deserved}} a stint in the House of Correction, and far better than Miss Mure's old woman who is impaled upon a steeple in St Paul's church-yard.|$|E

5|$|The {{episode was}} based on actual reports of {{conflict}} between the two nations. Hermione Norris made her final appearance as Ros Myers; the producers intended to leave <b>her</b> <b>fate</b> open {{in order for the}} audience to debate whether or not she survived the hotel explosion {{at the end of the}} episode. It was viewed by under six million viewers after its original broadcast, and received overwhelmingly positive reviews, particularly due to the reveal of Nightingale's plot and the cliffhanger, questioning whether or not Ros survived the hotel explosion.|$|E
5|$|The {{frustrated}} English devise {{another way}} to have Joan executed by the church. English soldiers go into Joan's cell room, rip her clothes and give her men's clothing to wear. They then state she conjured a spell to make the new clothing appear, suggesting {{that she is a}} witch who must be burned. Although suspecting the English are lying, the Bishop abandons Joan to <b>her</b> <b>fate,</b> and she is burned alive in the marketplace of Rouen, though a postscript adds that she was canonized as a saint in the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|The ship, {{now under}} British command with German crewmembers on board, was {{overhauled}} in Wilhelmshaven in June 1945, while <b>her</b> <b>fate</b> was determined.

5|$|At the Luthor Mansion, Tess Mercer (Cassidy Freeman) {{is confronted}} by Granny Goodness, who offers her one final chance to join Darkseid's forces to spare her life during the coming destruction. Tess refuses, declaring that, {{just because she}} was born a Luthor, <b>her</b> <b>fate</b> is not sealed. At Watchtower, {{discovering}} that Oliver Queen (Justin Hartley) disabled the organization's satellites, Tess brings up previous satellite footage revealing the planet Apokolips descending toward Earth. Before Tess can warn the team, she is ambushed {{by a group of}} armed men and taken captive. Granny Goodness, Desaad, and Gordon Godfrey meet in their lair. Oliver—possessed by the power of Darkseid—arrives and is instructed to remove Clark's powers with a gold kryptonite wedding ring. At the wedding, Chloe realizes the ring is kryptonite and stops Oliver. Clark helps Oliver overcome Darkseid's control just as Apokolips enters Earth's atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|Later that night, Daenerys {{stands before}} the {{gathered}} khals {{in the temple}} to hear <b>her</b> <b>fate.</b> There, she recalls her pregnancy ritual in this temple and her husband's vow to conquer Westeros. She accuses the khals of being unsuited to leading the Dothraki due to their lack of ambition, and says she will lead them. When Khal Moro and the other khals threaten to gang-rape her instead of serving her, she tells them they will die instead. She tips two braziers onto the straw floor, quickly setting the entire temple on fire and killing the khals, who have been barred inside by the younger Dosh Khaleen. A Dothraki crowd of thousands witnesses Daenerys emerge from the burning temple, naked but unburned. Amazed, they, Jorah and Daario bow down to her.|$|E
5|$|Loke had her keel {{laid down}} in March 1867 and was {{launched}} on 4 September 1869. She was commissioned on 22 October 1871 {{at the cost of}} 1,200,428 Swedish krona. The delay in construction may have been due to manufacturing difficulties by the British supplier of her armor plate. Generally the monitors were kept in reserve for most of the year; only being commissioned for two to four months during the summer and fall. Loke made only seven cruises, the last in late 1880, and was not commissioned afterwards. Funds were requested to rebuild her in 1903 and 1908, but they were refused. She was decommissioned on 21 August 1908 and advertised for sale. The details of <b>her</b> <b>fate</b> are unknown, but presumably she was sold and scrapped.|$|E

5|$|Macnamara {{they spent}} 15 days in September 1795 blockading a French grain convoy {{in the port}} of Genoa. The convoy was {{protected}} by two frigates, the Vestale and the Brun. The French finally {{came out on the}} evening of the fifteenth day, and were engaged by Southampton, despite the French possessing considerably more firepower. After a sustained engagement Southampton forced Vestale to strike her colours while the Brun escaped with the convoy, leaving Vestale to <b>her</b> <b>fate.</b> But as Southampton prepared to lower her boats to take possession of the French ship, her fore-mast, which had been damaged during the engagement, went by the board. Taking advantage of this, Vestale raised her colours and escaped from the scene.|$|E
5|$|Paul Jacobi bombarded Soviet {{forces on}} 6–9 March and alternated between {{bombardment}} and escort tasks {{for the rest}} of the war as the Germans evacuated East Prussia in the face of advancing Soviet armies. On 2 May, her gyrocompass was sabotaged by some of her crew to prevent the ship from screening the last few refugee convoys. Three men were convicted by a drumhead court-martial and sentenced to death by Rear Admiral (Konteradmiral) Bernhard Rogge. Paul Jacobi was decommissioned five days later at Flensburg and sailed to Wilhelmshaven under British control on 21 May to have <b>her</b> <b>fate</b> determined. France was initially denied any of the captured ships, but eventually received Paul Jacobi and three other destroyers. She arrived in Cherbourg on 15 January 1946 and was turned over to the French on 4 February.|$|E

Taking advantage of this, Vestale raised her colours and escaped from the scene. Victory over the Vestale should have brought promotions for Southamptons officers, including Lydiard, but her escape deprived them of this. Lydiard now had to secure another triumph to ensure his promotion.|$|E
