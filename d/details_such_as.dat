5|$|The {{series is}} filmed on sets that are an exact {{replica of the}} house. <b>Details</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Louis Comfort Tiffany stained glass windows, and {{hammered}} bronze light fixtures, were re-created to preserve {{the look of the}} house. The house became available for rent on Airbnb for six months, beginning February 2016, before being unlisted.|$|E
5|$|A Baroque and Neoclassical pulpit {{made in the}} 1870s {{is located}} on the right side (epistle) of the church, facing the altar. Connected to the convent is the tribuna, a private area for guests and visiting priests on the epistle side. A silver {{sanctuary}} lamp, dated 1835 and additional <b>details</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> sconce added in 1874, is hanged on the crossing.|$|E

5|$|Flight 007 {{has been}} the subject of ongoing {{controversy}} and has spawned a number of conspiracy theories. Many of these are based on the suppression of evidence such as the flight data recorders, unexplained <b>details</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> the role of a USAF RC-135 surveillance aircraft, the untimely destruction of the U.S. Air Force's King Salmon radar data, or merely Cold War disinformation and propaganda.|$|E
5|$|Industrial Light & Magic's (ILM) Colin Cantwell {{created the}} concept model that {{established}} the TIE fighter's ball-cockpit and hexagonal panels design for Star Wars (1977). Star Wars creator George Lucas liked the basic design {{consisting of two}} panels connected by a stick with a ball-shaped cockpit, but Cantwell's concept had few details. Joe Johnston created additional <b>details,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> the cockpit window and the attachment points between the solar panels and the hull.|$|E
5|$|New to {{the series}} is the Autovista mode, a mode in which players can view precise <b>details</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> engine parts and {{interior}} gauges on a select number of cars. It features a partnership with BBC's Top Gear {{as well as its}} American counterpart. Jeremy Clarkson and James May, former co-presenters for Top Gear, provide commentary in the game's Autovista mode. Other partnerships include a two-year agreement with the American Le Mans Series (ALMS). Over 500 cars and 26 tracks are included.|$|E

5|$|No {{architectural}} drawings {{survive for}} any English cathedral earlier than 1525 (although an engineer's {{design for a}} proposed new water supply at Canterbury cathedral priory exists in a 12th-century plan). Architectural <b>details,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> window tracery designs, were not executed as scale drawings, but were incised full-size onto a large flat gypsum tracing-floor, examples of which survive at York and Wells.|$|E
5|$|Several {{subspecies}} of the goldcrest {{have been}} described. In continental Eurasia, {{there are nine}} generally accepted and very similar subspecies, differing only in <b>details</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> plumage shade. At the genetic level, the two Central Asian forms, R. r. sikkimensis and R. r. himalayensis, {{are very close to}} each other, and have differentiated only in the recent past, but they diverged from the western subspecies around 2.8mya.|$|E
5|$|Square's aim {{with the}} title was to create {{some of the most}} {{realistic}} wrestlers seen in video games, with accurate <b>details</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> a faithful replication of body-muscle physics and facial expressions. Screenshots of the game were shown during the Square Millennium Event in Japan in 2000; and a battle was played in demonstration by Yusuke Hirata and a young Japanese idol later in the same year at the Tokyo Game Show.|$|E

5|$|The {{commissioning}} aside, Delaroche {{was inspired}} to create Bonaparte Crossing the Alps because {{he felt that he}} both looked like Napoleon, and that his achievements were comparable to Napoleon's. It is likely that Delaroche's painting is relatively historically accurate; <b>details</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Napoleon's clothes appear to have been researched by Delaroche in an effort at authenticity.|$|E
5|$|The {{hypothesis}} of mitochondrial binary fission {{has relied on}} the visualization by fluorescence microscopy and conventional transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The resolution of fluorescence microscopy(~200nm) is insufficient to distinguish structural <b>details,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> double mitochondrial membrane in mitochondrial division or even to distinguish individual mitochondria when several are close together. Conventional TEM has also some technical limitations in verifying mitochondrial division. Cryo-electron tomography was recently used to visualize mitochondrial division in frozen hydrated intact cells. It revealed that mitochondria divide by budding.|$|E
5|$|Town Hall (set number 10224) was {{released}} in March 2012 and is the seventh set in the Modular Building line. The set contains 2766 pieces and is recommended for builders 14 and over. It was the largest modular set, taking the title from the Green Grocer. It contains many interior <b>details,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> a working elevator, along with board tables and balconies {{to look to the}} floor below. Along with the interior details the set also has many exterior <b>details,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> four pillars on the front step and windows {{at the back of the}} building, and also a clock tower at the top of the building. The date on the building, 1891 represents the birth year of the founder of LEGO and when reversed, it's the birth year of the designer, Astrid (1981). The set was priced at £149.99, $199.99 or €179.99 as released by LEGO on February 16, 2012. There are eight minifigures in the set with a wedding couple. The set had a global discontinuation date of 31 December 2014 and had a much shorter lifespan than its predecessors.|$|E

50|$|The {{primary use}} of Romanowsky-type stains is for cytoplasmic <b>detail,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> intracytoplasmic mucins, fat {{droplets}} and neurosecretory granules. Extracellular substances, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> free mucin, colloid, ground substance, etc., are also easily stained, and appear metachromatic. Microbiologic agents, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> bacteria and fungi, also appear easier in Diff-Quik.|$|R

5|$|As the Emperor's {{personal}} taster, Halotus would accompany Claudius {{to every}} banquet and dinner and as chief steward, {{he would have}} been with Claudius and his family {{for the majority of the}} time. Thus he could have formed a relationship with Agrippina the Younger, suggesting the possibility of their collaboration in poisoning Claudius. It also meant that {{he would have been}} aware of <b>details</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> the Emperor's food preferences, his meal times and his schedule, making it easier for him to commit the murder.|$|E
5|$|During the TGS afterparty, new {{cast member}} Danny Baker (Cheyenne Jackson) admits to his boss, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin), {{that he has}} been having an office romance but will not {{disclose}} the woman's name. While in attendance at a New York Knicks game, Jack asks more about the woman Danny is seeing and Danny reveals <b>details,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> she has never let a man see her feet. This results in Jack's realization that the woman is the show's head writer, Liz Lemon (Tina Fey), and he is displeased.|$|E
5|$|Krohn's {{analysis}} of the production of Psycho in his book Hitchcock at Work, while refuting Bass' claims for directing the scene, notes that these storyboards did introduce key aspects of the final scene—most notably, {{the fact that the}} killer appears as a silhouette, and <b>details</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> the close-ups of the slashing knife, Leigh's desperate outstretched arm, the shower curtain being torn down, and the transition from the hole of the drainage pipe to Marion Crane's dead eyes. Krohn notes that this final transition is highly reminiscent of the iris titles that Bass created for Vertigo.|$|E

5|$|Maggots {{found on}} corpses are useful to {{forensic}} entomologists. Maggot species {{can be identified}} by their anatomical features and by matching their DNA. Maggots of different species of flies visit corpses and carcases at fairly well-defined times {{after the death of}} the victim, and so do their predators, such as beetles in the family Histeridae. Thus, {{the presence or absence of}} particular species provides evidence for the time since death, and sometimes other <b>details</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> the place of death, when species are confined to particular habitats such as woodland.|$|E
5|$|Many of the textures were {{accumulated}} {{during a}} three-day trip to Santa Fe, New Mexico. The artists took hundreds of photos of wood, adobe, sand, stucco and other materials, which were treated in Photoshop before being mapped onto the 3D geometry. Whereas many computer-generated environments {{of the time}} ended up looking smooth, like plastic, the Millers and Vander Wende developed a more gritty and weathered design, with corroded and aged elements, to imply reality. The artists considered how objects would look and function if they were real, where and how they would be worn, and created corresponding details. While bump maps were occasionally used to simulate geometry, even small <b>details</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> screws were often individually modeled.|$|E
5|$|Passenger {{numbers at}} Redland were further boosted by a {{marketing}} campaign by the Severnside Community Rail Partnership {{to attract more}} people, especially students, to use the station. The work won a Department for Transport Community Rail Marketing Award in 2007. The Severnside CRP also formed {{a support group for}} the station, and improved the provision of timetabling information through the use of simplified departure timetable posters. In 2008, they helped to renovate and repaint the station building. It was decorated in 2009 by students from Fairfield School, who created a mural of Victorian characters with incongruous <b>details</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> mobile phones, sunglasses and funny hats. The work won a Community Rail Award.|$|E
