5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been {{assigned}} to debunk his work. In this episode, The Amazing Maleeni, a small-time magician, performs an amazing feat to impress a heckler—he turns his head 360 degrees. So when he is later found without a head at all, Mulder and Scully arrive on the case and discover an angry ex-con, an unimpressed rival, and Maleeni’s twin brother. All seem to <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{with a plan to}} rob a major bank.|$|E
5|$|In the north, they {{hibernate}} {{during the}} winter. Niell (1947, 1948) made observations in Georgia, and noted {{they were one}} of the last species to seek shelter, often being found active until the first heavy frosts. At this point, they moved to higher ground and could be found in rotting pine stumps by tearing away the bark. These snakes could be quite active upon discovery and would then attempt to burrow more deeply into the soft wood or escape to the nearest water. In southeastern Virginia, Wood (1954) reported seeing migratory behavior in late October and early November. During a period of three or four days, as many as 50 individuals could be seen swimming across Back Bay from the bayside swamps of the barrier islands to the mainland. He suggested this might <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with hibernating habits. In the southern parts of its range, hibernation may be short or omitted altogether.|$|E

25|$|By birth Jeanne was {{connected}} to Clan Forbes. The marriage {{seems to have taken}} place a few years before Clan Leslie joined with Clan Gordon in their feud against Clan Forbes. The Leslie's were supporters of Mary, Queen of Scots, Catholic pretender to the throne of England, who was imprisoned (and eventually executed) by Queen Elizabeth I and her son, the future James I of England, taken away to be raised protestant. These events may or may not <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the later accusations that Thomas was an intelligencer for James I.|$|E
25|$|Patients with {{anterograde}} amnesia have trouble recalling new information and new autobiographical events, but {{the data are}} less consistent {{in regard to the}} latter. Medveds and Hirst recorded the presence of islands of memory– detailed accounts– that were described by such patients. The island memories were a combination of semantic and episodic memories. The researchers recorded patients giving long narratives with a fair amount of detail that resembled memories that the patients had prior to the trauma. The appearance of islands of memory could <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the functioning of adjacent cortical areas and the neocortex. In addition, the researchers suspect that the amygdala {{played a role in the}} narratives.|$|E
25|$|There were no {{poor people}} {{in the land of}} Oz, because {{there was no such thing}} as money, and all {{property}} of every sort belonged to the Ruler. Each person was given freely by his neighbors whatever he required for his use, which is as much as anyone may reasonably desire. Every one worked half the time and played half the time, and the people enjoyed the work as much as they did the play, because it is good to be occupied and to <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> There were no cruel overseers set to watch them, and no one to rebuke them or to find fault with them. So each one was proud to do all he could for his friends and neighbors, and was glad when they would accept the things he produced.|$|E

25|$|After {{the death}} of Awole there was a {{scramble}} for the throne by numerous contenders; some {{were reported to have}} spent less than six months on the throne; there was also a period of interregnum of almost twenty years where the various factions could not agree on a candidate for the throne. This period of vacuum led to the rise of powerful military and regional commanders like Adegun, the Onikoyi and others like the Otun to the Are-Ona Kakanfo, called Solagberu, and also Shehu Alimi, who was the leader of a growing Muslim population in Oyo. These new powers had lost regard for the office of the Alaafin due to the various political wranglings and the lack of a central authority at the time; this situation eventually led up to Afonja seceding Ilorin from Oyo in 1817 with the help of Oyo Muslims. In 1823, after Afonja had been killed by his allies, Shehu Alimi and Solagberu (Solagberu was also later killed by Alimi's son), Ilorin became part of the Sokoto Caliphate. By the time Captain Hugh Clapperton visited Oyo-Ile in 1825 during the reign of Alaafin Majotu, the empire was already in a state of decline. Clapperton's party recorded passing numerous Oyo villages burned by the Fulani (Ilorin) while Majotu had also sought the help of the English king and the Oba of Benin in putting down the Ilorin rebellion. Clapperton also noticed a shortage of horses, even though the Oyo were renowned as a great cavalry force; this might <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with {{the fact that most of}} the empire's soldiers and hence cavalry were stationed at Ilorin under the command of Afonja and later on Alimi's successors.|$|E
500|$|Andy Orchard {{comments}} that the seeming appearance of Baldr with Volla in the Merseburg Incantation is [...] "intriguing" [...] since Fulla {{is one of}} the three goddesses (the other two being Baldr's mother Frigg and his wife Nanna) the deceased Baldr expressly sends gifts to from Hel. John Lindow says that since the name Fulla seems to <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with fullness, it may also point to an association with fertility.|$|E
500|$|Seizures in {{temporal}} lobe epilepsy {{can affect the}} normal development of new neurons and can cause tissue damage. Hippocampal sclerosis {{is the most common}} type of such tissue damage. It is not yet clear, however, whether the epilepsy is usually caused by hippocampal abnormalities or whether the hippocampus is damaged by cumulative effects of seizures. However, [...] in experimental settings where repetitive seizures are artificially induced in animals, hippocampal damage is a frequent result. This may be a consequence of the concentration of excitable glutamate receptors in the hippocampus. Hyperexcitability can lead to cytotoxicity and cell death. It may also <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the hippocampus being a site where new neurons continue to be created throughout life, and to abnormalities in this process.|$|E

500|$|On February 6, 1999, a team {{of three}} biologists, led by Professor Jonathan Hoffman, {{investigate}} a series of supposed wildlife killings in a wooded area near a small New York town. One of the biologists, Bianca, suspects that the killings may <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with a recent earthquake. When Hoffman and the other biologist, Gabriel, go off to investigate the wildlife disappearances, they discover the corpse of a mutilated deer. Upon returning to the campsite, they find that Bianca has discovered {{a hole in the}} ground. From this, the group determines that a prehistoric creature that has been frozen for thousands of years was freed by the earthquake, and has been killing the wildlife. The creature appears and kills both Gabriel and Bianca, leaving Hoffman to deduce that it is a [...] "snow shark", before it bites him.|$|E
500|$|Pattycake moved {{permanently}} to the Bronx Zoo on December 20, 1982. For a few years, {{she lived}} in a cage with Pansy, a chimpanzee. [...] In June 1999, Pattycake moved into the Wildlife Conservation Society's $43 million Congo Gorilla Forest exhibit. [...] The exhibit includes a Great Gorilla Forest viewing area that separates gorillas and visitors with a glass window. Two troops of gorillas inhabited the 6.5 acre exhibit, with a dozen gorillas in Pattycake's troop alone, including Fubo, Pattycake, Tunko, Triska, Halima, Fran, Layla, Kumi, Suki, Babatunde, Barbara, and M'domo. The general curator of the Bronx Zoo, James Doherty, described Pattycake as [...] "independent" [...] with [...] "few close friends" [...] in the Congo Gorilla Forest. [...] "It may <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the fact that she didn't live with her parents that long, and lived with that chimpanzee for a few years," [...] Doherty said.|$|E
500|$|Berry {{graduated}} from Bedford High School {{where she was}} a cheerleader, honor student, editor of the school newspaper and prom queen. [...] She worked in the children's department at Higbee's Department store. She then studied at Cuyahoga Community College. In the 1980s, she entered several beauty contests, winning Miss Teen All American in 1985 and Miss Ohio USA in 1986. She was the 1986 Miss USA first runner-up to Christy Fichtner of Texas. In the Miss USA 1986 pageant interview competition, she said she hoped to become an entertainer or to <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the media. Her interview was awarded the highest score by the judges. She was the first African-American Miss World entrant in 1986, where she finished sixth and Trinidad and Tobago's Giselle Laronde was crowned Miss World. According to the Current Biography Yearbook, Berry [...] "...pursued a modeling career in Chicago.... Berry's first weeks in New York were less than auspicious: She slept in a homeless shelter {{and then in a}} YMCA".|$|E

500|$|The show's {{popularity}} {{resulted in}} enquiries for coats similar to Sherlock's, reported retailer Debenhams. Garment manufacturer Belstaff put the wool trench coat worn by Benedict Cumberbatch back into production before the series had ended. The Independent reported, [...] "designer Paul Costelloe moved {{to meet the}} demand, offering tailored coats and scarves based on the series, while Savile Row bespoke tailor John Pearse said many of his clients were inquiring about the actors' clothes." [...] Journalist Alexis Petridis commented, [...] "ou can see why men {{wanted to get the}} look. Perhaps they noted the effect Cumberbatch, by no means your standard telly hunk, had on lady viewers … and decided it must <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the clobber. So it is that Britain's latest men's style icon is a fictional asexual sociopath first seen onscreen hitting a corpse with a horse whip. Surely not even the great detective himself could have deduced that was going to happen." ...|$|E
500|$|Music critic Henry Pleasants {{observes that}} [...] "Presley has been {{described}} variously as a baritone and a tenor. [...] An extraordinary compass... and a very wide range of vocal color <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with this divergence of opinion." [...] He identifies Presley as a high baritone, calculating his range as two octaves and a third, [...] "from the baritone low G to the tenor high B, with an upward extension in falsetto to at least a D-flat. [...] Presley's best octave is in the middle, D-flat to D-flat, granting an extra full step up or down." [...] In Pleasants' view, his voice was [...] "variable and unpredictable" [...] at the bottom, [...] "often brilliant" [...] at the top, with the capacity for [...] "full-voiced high Gs and As that an opera baritone might envy". [...] Scholar Lindsay Waters, who figures Presley's range as 2¼ octaves, emphasizes that [...] "his voice had an emotional range from tender whispers to sighs down to shouts, grunts, grumbles, and sheer gruffness that could move the listener from calmness and surrender, to fear." [...] Presley was always [...] "able to duplicate the open, hoarse, ecstatic, screaming, shouting, wailing, reckless sound of the black rhythm-and-blues and gospel singers," [...] writes Pleasants, and also demonstrated a remarkable ability to assimilate many other vocal styles.|$|E
500|$|From October 2008, O'Meara, McIntosh, and Cattermole reunited {{and started}} {{performing}} in pubs and clubs across Britain. [...] This was shortly after O'Meara's son Lenny was born. On 12 November 2008, a bottle was thrown at O'Meara during an S Club 3 performance in Bradford; it {{left her with}} a severe cut to the head, requiring treatment at a nearby Hospital. A 20-year-old man was arrested, and the attack was thought to <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with her performance on Celebrity Big Brother, where nearly 50,000 complaints were received about her and two other female contestants' apparent racist bullying toward Bollywood actress Shilpa Shetty. In late 2008, some sources stated that Barrett and Lee were to start touring with the group sometime in the following year. It was also stated that a new greatest hits album, Ain't No Party: The Ultimate Collection of S Club 7 was set for release later the following year. [...] Both of these rumours {{turned out to be}} false. Lee was pursuing his acting career along with Spearritt, Barrett was on hiatus, and Stevens was starring in Strictly Come Dancing. Cattermole was absent from a gig at the Plug Club in Sheffield in February 2009. On 12 November, S Club 3 turned on the Mansfield Christmas Lights. In early 2010, the group decided to take their gigs further. They booked some venues in Egypt for April. On 19 April 2010, S Club 3 were the headlining act at the Tottenham Carnival. The group made an appearance at Gay Prides in Doncaster and Yorkshire on 21 August.|$|E
