500|$|Jim Miller of Rolling Stone {{condemned}} Harrison for releasing {{an album}} with his voice blown {{and for his}} apparent disdain towards the Beatles' legacy, and he dismissed the song as [...] "a raspy stab at 'Auld Lang Syne'". Amid the scathing critique he gave Harrison's tour and album, Jack Sheridan of Baltimore radio station WCAO cited [...] "Ding Dong" [...] {{as an example of}} how the former Beatle's music had altered [...] "so radically". Writing in Circus Raves magazine, Michael Gross defended Harrison's move away from the past, saying that Dark Horse matched the critically acclaimed All Things Must Pass, [...] "surpassing it, at times, with its clarity of production and lovely songs", and he praised [...] "Ding Dong", the title track and the Harrison–Ron Wood collaboration [...] "Far East Man" [...] as [...] "all, simply, good songs". While remarking on the surprisingly late release for a holiday-season single, Billboards reviewer deemed the track to be an [...] "Extremely listenable performance" [...] and added: [...] "George has a genuine hit sound to offer here that's just right for those early January time-to-change resolutions. Catchy, heavily percussive production in Harrison's uptempo guru vein … <b>Get</b> <b>on</b> <b>it,</b> jocks." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Goin' In" [...] {{was written}} by Michael Warren, Jamahl Listenbee, Joseph Angel, Coleridge Tillman, David Quiñones and Tramar Dillard. Lopez's vocals were {{produced}} by Harrell and recorded at Pinky's Palace. Josh Gudwin and O'Ryan handled audio engineering of the song, with assistance from Falcone and Mack. The song features additional vocals from American rapper Lil Jon. GoonRock produced and later mixed the song alongside Kenny Moran at The House on the Hill Studios in Los Angeles, California. Of GoonRock, Lopez commented by stating that he is [...] "very forward with his sound". After recording her vocals for the song, Flo Rida recorded a rap verse for the song. Those involved {{in the production of}} the song were extremely happy with the song before Flo Rida's rap appeared on it, but once his vocals were on the song it [...] "took it over the top top". When choosing who she wanted to feature on the song, Lopez had several other rappers in mind, such as Big Sean. Lopez revealed: [...] "We had a couple of people who said yes, that they would <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>it,</b> but [...] just seemed like the perfect one." [...] She further explained that the style of the song [...] "really fit Flo Rida"; [...] "It was half-dance, but half kind of hard too." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Champion" [...] {{was written}} by Minaj, along with T-Minus, Nikhil S., Drake, Young Jeezy, and Nas, with {{production}} handled by T-Minus and Nikhil S., who had previously worked with Minaj on her debut studio album Pink Friday (2010). Minaj had wanted several artists {{to appear on the}} song, including fellow New York rapper Nas. She had stated that she did not think that she could get Nas on the song, saying [...] "He's always been so exclusive. He doesn't work with everybody and I respect people that are like that. They take pride in their craft." [...] Minaj told Vibe, [...] "I keep saying to be from Queens and to end up having him... We know how picky he is [...] He said 'I like the song, I'm a do it, you can wait 'til Monday and I got you' and he kept his word. He murked it, for me to wait for a feature and it be that and murk the song and finish the song that way... I was amazed." [...] After hearing the song, Nas agreed to be on the track, and sent his verse back to Minaj the following Monday. After collaborating, Nas said that he {{had fallen in love with}} the song: [...] "Nicki hit us up, I got love, so it was nothin'--I did the record....If I feel it, I can <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>it.</b> I heard the track. I felt it. I loved it." [...] Another artist Minaj wanted on [...] "Champion" [...] was long-time idol and fellow female rapper Lauryn Hill. [...] "I wanted to get her on 'Champion'... That would have been crazy, right? She was my fave. [...] Lauryn to me is the goddess. I'd love to meet her. I'm pretty sure she's heard me talk about her a billion times." [...] Although Minaj vouched for Hill to appear on the track, plans were never finalized and the collaboration ultimately fell through.|$|E

The two had a falling out and Jay-Ru died before the two {{had a chance to}} reconcile. [...] "Me and Jay-Ru was still close partners," [...] T.I. explained. [...] "We lived together, we was in the streets hustling together. I had got involved with my older son's mom at the time. I moved out of the apartment into my own spot with her. Me and Jay-Ru fell out about that it took a toll on me. To this day I still think about him, especially when I see his daughter",T.I. stated. According to T. I. himself, [...] securing Jamie Foxx on piano wasn't too tough of a task. [...] "I sent the word I wanted him to <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>it</b> and he got on it the next day. [...] I was thinking about everybody who could play the piano as well as sing, and Jamie {{was at the top of}} my list". [...] T. I. added that he was just about done with his album, but he's not ruling out a last-minute guest appearance by Jay-Z, who was supposed to get on a record called [...] "Good Life", [...] but due to scheduling conflicts he didn't make it and Common took his place. The two hooked up while both were in Los Angeles for the Grammys. T.I. would also have recording sessions for the album with record Producers Just Blaze, Keith Mack, Travis Barker, The Neptunes, Kevin [...] "Khao" [...] Cates, Nick [...] "Fury" [...] Loftin and Tony Galvin.|$|E

6000|$|Poor Tom formed no {{visions of}} the distant future {{as he made his}} way homeward; he only felt that the present was very hard. It seemed a wrong toward him that his uncle Deane had no {{confidence}} in him,--did not see at once that he should acquit himself well, which Tom himself was as certain of as of the daylight. Apparently he, Tom Tulliver, was likely to be held of small account in the world; and for the first time he felt a sinking of heart under the sense that he really was very ignorant, and could do very little. Who was that enviable young man that could tell the cubic contents of things in no time, and make suggestions about Swedish bark! Tom had been used to be so entirely satisfied with himself, in spite of his breaking down in a demonstration, and construing nunc illas promite vires as [...] "now promise those men"; but now he suddenly felt at a disadvantage, because he knew less than some one else knew. There must be a world of things connected with that Swedish bark, which, if he only knew them, might have helped him to <b>get</b> <b>on.</b> <b>It</b> would have been much easier to make a figure with a spirited horse and a new saddle.|$|E

"No, I {{will take}} a watch, at any rate until we see how the petty {{officers}} <b>get</b> <b>on.</b> <b>It</b> is ticklish navigation among these islands, and I certainly should not feel comfortable if neither you nor I were on deck. There is the Tigre fairly under way, steering south by west. We are walking along, ain't we? This breeze just suits her, {{and she is a}} very different craft now to what she was when we overhauled her, laden down pretty nearly to her covering-board. I don't think, in a breeze like this, that the Tigre would be able to catch us, although, of course, if the wind strengthened much her weight would tell. However, there is no doubt at all that this craft is fast. I hope ere long we shall try our speed against one of these pirates. I expect that off the wind with those big lateen sails of theirs they are very fast, but on the wind they would have no chance with us. When we get away from Rhodes we will disguise her a bit, put a yellow streak to her, and give her the look of a trader. They {{are much more likely to}} find us than we are to find them." ...|$|E

'Didn't I know it! But how little {{you think of}} the rightful umbleness of a person in my station, Master Copperfield! Father and me was both brought up at a foundation school for boys; and mother, she was likewise brought up at a public, sort of charitable, establishment. They taught us all a deal of umbleness--not much else that I know of, from morning to night. We was to be umble to this person, and umble to that; and to pull off our caps here, and to make bows there; and always to know our place, and abase ourselves before our betters. And we had such a lot of betters! Father got the monitor-medal by being umble. So did I. Father got made a sexton by being umble. He had the character, among the gentlefolks, of being such a well-behaved man, that they were determined to bring him in.

60|$|It {{needed no}} {{orders for the}} {{messengers}} to use speed. Ronald and his men went at a gallop, only breaking into a slower pace at times to enable the men to breathe their horses. They had a long ride before them, and anxious as he was to <b>get</b> <b>on,</b> <b>it</b> was necessary to spare the horses as much as possible. He arrived at the station his detachment had before occupied at about one o'clock. The inhabitants were just sitting down to dinner. A good many Kaffirs were scattered about through the village. These looked surprised at {{the arrival of a}} detachment of cavalry, and gradually disappeared, supposing that Ronald's party was but the advance guard of a larger body. As soon as the news spread, the inhabitants hurried from their houses, men, women, and children, loaded with such articles they could snatch up in their haste, and all hastened to the building which they had before decided should be used as a citadel in case of need. Boys galloped out to the fields to drive the cattle into the kraal that had been constructed within easy range of the guns of the defenders of the Fort. Men were placed on sentry, while others brought in from the houses food, bedding, and clothes, and in a short time the village was prepared for a defence.|$|E

6000|$|There was not {{the least}} doubt that from his own {{orthodox}} point of view the situation was growing immoral. For Sue to be the loved one {{of a man who}} was licensed by the laws of his country to love Arabella and none other unto his life's end, was a pretty bad second beginning when the man was bent on such a course as Jude purposed. This conviction was so real with him that one day when, as was frequent, he was at work in a neighbouring village church alone, he felt it to be his duty to pray against his weakness. But much as he wished to be an exemplar in these things he could not <b>get</b> <b>on.</b> <b>It</b> was quite impossible, he found, to ask to be delivered from temptation when your heart's desire was to be tempted unto seventy times seven. So he excused himself. [...] "After all," [...] he said, [...] "it is not altogether an erotolepsy that is the matter with me, as at that first time. I can see that she is exceptionally bright; and it is partly a wish for intellectual sympathy, and a craving for loving-kindness in my solitude."

But that was no reason she should blame me for it, and look on me as a cold deck; but she did--ay, she did. Why didn't she give me a show? Why didn't the world? Why did I go broke in Seattle? Why did I take the steerage, and live like a hog to Nome? Why did I go to the El Dorado? I was heading for Big Pete's and only went for matches. Why didn't I have matches? Why did I want to smoke?

[...] It was his belief that no skipper in the world would keep his command for a day if only the owners could be [...] "made to know."

It filled the leisure of his waking hours with the reveries of careful plans and compromising discoveries--the dreams of his sleep with images of lucky turns and favorable accidents. Skippers had been known to sicken and die at sea, than which nothing could be better to give a smart mate a chance of showing what he's made of. They also would tumble overboard sometimes: he had heard of one or two such cases. Others again [...] .
