5|$|Through a {{completely}} random encounter Cayce meets Voytek Biroshak and Ngemi, the former an artist using old ZX81 microcomputers as a sculpture medium, the latter a collector of rare technology (he mentions purchasing Stephen King's word processor, for example). Another collector, and sometime 'friend' of Ngemi's, Hobbs Baranov, {{is a retired}} cryptographer and mathematician with connections in the American National Security Agency. Cayce strikes a deal with him: she buys a Curta calculator for him and he finds the <b>email</b> <b>address</b> to which the watermark code was sent. Using this <b>email</b> <b>address</b> Cayce makes contact with Stella Volkova whose sister Nora is the maker of the film clips.|$|E

5000|$|Spammers may harvest <b>email</b> <b>addresses</b> from {{a number}} of sources. A popular method uses <b>email</b> <b>addresses</b> which their owners have {{published}} for other purposes. Usenet posts, especially those in archives such as Google Groups, frequently yield addresses. Simply searching the Web for pages with addresses [...] - [...] such as corporate staff directories or membership lists of professional societies [...] - [...] using spambots can yield thousands of addresses, most of them deliverable. Spammers have also subscribed to discussion mailing lists for the purpose of gathering the addresses of posters. The DNS and WHOIS systems require the publication of technical contact information for all Internet domains; spammers have illegally trawled these resources for <b>email</b> <b>addresses.</b> Spammers have also concluded that generally, for the domain names of businesses, all of the <b>email</b> <b>addresses</b> will follow the same basic pattern and thus are able to accurately guess the <b>email</b> <b>addresses</b> of employees whose addresses they have not harvested. Many spammers use programs called web spiders to find <b>email</b> <b>addresses</b> on web pages. Usenet article message-IDs often look enough like <b>email</b> <b>addresses</b> that they are harvested as well. Spammers have also harvested <b>email</b> <b>addresses</b> directly from Google search results, without actually spidering the websites found in the search.|$|R
50|$|On web pages, {{organizations}} often obscure <b>email</b> <b>addresses</b> {{of their}} members or employees by omitting the @. This practice, known as address munging, makes the <b>email</b> <b>addresses</b> less vulnerable to spam programs that scan the internet for them.|$|R

The Radio Times issued its own list of missing episodes. The magazine has also set up an <b>email</b> <b>address</b> specifically for Doctor Who missing episodes that the public can use to contact it {{if they have any}} information.|$|E
5|$|Director Wes Anderson first {{approached}} actors Schwartzman and Portman about Hotel Chevalier in 2005. Schwartzman and Anderson {{had previously}} worked on Rushmore (1998), Anderson's cult second feature, {{and had been}} living together in Schwartzman's Paris apartment {{in the months leading}} up to the shoot. Portman was approached after the director obtained her <b>email</b> <b>address</b> from Scott Rudin, producer of 2004's Closer in which she starred. The actors appeared for free, and Anderson financed the remainder of the production himself.|$|E
5|$|Valve added Steam Guard {{functionality}} to the Steam {{client in}} March 2011 {{to protect against}} the hijacking of accounts via phishing schemes, one of the largest support issues Valve had at the time. Steam Guard was advertised {{to take advantage of the}} identity protection provided by Intel's second-generation Core processors and compatible motherboard hardware, which allows users to lock their account to a specific computer. Once locked, activity by that account on other computers must first be approved by the user on the locked computer. Support APIs for Steam Guard are available to third-party developers through Steamworks. Steam Guard also offers two-factor, risk-based authentication that uses a one-time verification code sent to a verified <b>email</b> <b>address</b> associated with the Steam account; this was later expanded to include two-factor authentication through the Steam mobile application, known as Steam Guard Mobile Authenticator. If Steam Guard is enabled, the verification code is sent each time the account is used from an unknown machine.|$|E
50|$|Many {{websites}} {{evaluate the}} validity of <b>email</b> <b>addresses</b> differently than the standards specify, rejecting addresses containing valid characters, such as + and /, or enforcing arbitrary length limitations. RFC 3696 provides specific advice for validating Internet identifiers, including <b>email</b> <b>addresses.</b>|$|R
30|$|To {{associate}} multiple <b>email</b> <b>addresses</b> with {{a single}} individual, we used an approach similar to the cluster algorithm described by Bird et al. [6]. We created clusters of similar identities and then manually processed them. To create the clusters we used both name and email; we first normalized the names, then we looked for name similarities, name-email similarities, and email similarities. To match identities, we also collected names and <b>email</b> <b>addresses</b> from other data sources, such as commit logs and projects’ metadata. Based on GNOME’s account name policy [72], we merged <b>email</b> <b>addresses</b> ending in gnome.org that had the same user name (for example, we merged in jhs@gnome.org <b>email</b> <b>addresses</b> like jhs@cvs.gnome.org, jhs@src.gnome.org, and jhs@gnome.org).|$|R
50|$|Poisoning spammers' {{mailing lists}} is usually done by blacklists {{submitting}} fake information to email submit style offers, or by posting invalid <b>email</b> <b>addresses</b> in a Usenet forum or {{on a web}} page where spammers are believed to harvest <b>email</b> <b>addresses</b> for their mailing lists.|$|R

25|$|Specialized spam filters {{can reduce}} the number of {{phishing}} emails that reach their addressees' inboxes, or provide post-delivery remediation, analyzing and removing spear phishing attacks upon delivery through email provider-level integration.

40|$|Analysis {{of traffic}} logs of email {{received}} {{by a large}} UK ISP shows considerable disparity between the proportions of spam received by addresses with different first characters. This disparity is quite marked when only <b>email</b> <b>addresses</b> {{that appear to be}} ?real? are considered. The root cause is likely to be spammers using ?dictionary? or ?Rumpelstiltskin? attacks to guess valid <b>email</b> <b>addresses.</b> There is limited evidence for these attacks taking place in real-time, suggesting that most ?fake? <b>email</b> <b>addresses</b> were constructed sometime in the past and are now immortalised within spammer databases...|$|R
50|$|Spammer viruses {{may include}} a {{function}} which scans the victimized computer's disk drives (and possibly its network interfaces) for <b>email</b> <b>addresses.</b> These scanners discover <b>email</b> <b>addresses</b> which {{have never been}} exposed on the Web or in Whois. A compromised computer located on a shared network segment may capture <b>email</b> <b>addresses</b> from traffic addressed to its network neighbors. The harvested addresses are {{then returned to the}} spammer through the bot-net created by the virus. In addition, sometime the addresses may be appended with other information and cross referenced to extract financial and personal data.|$|R

25|$|An {{industry}} of <b>email</b> <b>address</b> harvesting {{is dedicated to}} collecting email addresses and selling compiled databases. Some of these address-harvesting approaches rely on users not reading the fine print of agreements, resulting in their agreeing to send messages indiscriminately to their contacts. This is a common approach in social networking spam such as that generated by the social networking site Quechup.|$|E
25|$|While simply {{completing}} the registration web form is in general enough to generate an account, the status label Inactive is commonly provided by default until the registered user confirms the <b>email</b> <b>address</b> given while registering indeed {{belongs to the}} user.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedEmail addresses extracted from secondary storage devices {{are important to}} a forensic analyst when conducting an investigation. They can {{provide insight into the}} user's social network and help identify other potential persons of interest. However, {{a large portion of the}} <b>email</b> <b>addresses</b> from any given device are artifacts of installed software and are of no interest to the analyst. We propose a method for discovering relevant <b>email</b> <b>addresses</b> by creating graphs consisting of extracted <b>email</b> <b>addresses</b> along with their byte-offset location in storage. We compute certain global attributes of these graphs to construct feature vectors, which we use to classify graphs into useful and not useful categories. This process filters out the majority of uninteresting <b>email</b> <b>addresses.</b> We show that using the network topological measures on the dataset tested, Naïve Bayes and SVM were successful in identifying 100 % and 95 : 5 %, respectively, of all graphs that contained useful <b>email</b> <b>addresses</b> both with areas under the curve above : 97 and F 1 scores at : 80 and : 90 for Naïve Bayes and SVM, respectively. Our results show that using network science metrics as attributes to classify graphs of <b>email</b> <b>addresses</b> based on the graph's topology could be an effective and efficient tool for automatically delivering evidence to an analyst.
