25|$|Both Reverse osmosis and <b>electrodialysis</b> (also called <b>electrodialysis</b> reversal) {{can remove}} arsenic {{with a net}} ionic charge. (Note that arsenic oxide, As2O3, is a common form of arsenic in {{groundwater}} that is soluble, but has no net charge.) Some utilities presently use one of these methods to reduce total dissolved solids and therefore improve taste. A problem with both methods is the production of high-salinity waste water, called brine, or concentrate, which then must be disposed of.|$|E
25|$|Brine {{treatment}} technologies may include: {{membrane filtration}} processes, such as reverse osmosis; ion exchange {{processes such as}} <b>electrodialysis</b> or weak acid cation exchange; or evaporation processes, such as brine concentrators and crystallizers employing mechanical vapour recompression and steam.|$|E
25|$|A process {{employing}} electrokinetic shocks waves {{can be used}} {{to accomplish}} membraneless desalination at ambient temperature and pressure. In this process, anions and cations in salt water are exchanged for carbonate anions and calcium cations, respectively using electrokinetic shockwaves. Calcium and carbonate ions react to form calcium carbonate, which precipitates, leaving fresh water. The theoretical energy efficiency of this method is on par with <b>electrodialysis</b> and reverse osmosis.|$|E
25|$|Florida obtains {{much of its}} {{drinking}} water from the Floridan Aquifer and the Biscayne Aquifer, {{as well as from}} surface water from Lake Okeechobee and other lakes, but population increases have begun to strain available sources. The state has built 120 desalination plants, more than three times as many as any other state, including the largest plant in the United States. Additionally, an <b>electrodialysis</b> reversal plant in Sarasota is the largest of its type in the world, and a nanofiltration plant in Boca Raton is the largest of its type in the Western Hemisphere.|$|E
25|$|Ash ponds, a type {{of surface}} impoundment, are a widely used {{treatment}} technology at coal-fired plants. These ponds use gravity to settle out large particulates (measured as total suspended solids) from power plant wastewater. This technology does not treat dissolved pollutants. Power stations use additional technologies to control pollutants, depending on the particular wastestream in the plant. These include dry ash handling, closed-loop ash recycling, chemical precipitation, biological treatment (such as an activated sludge process), membrane systems, and evaporation-crystallization systems. Technological advancements in ion exchange membranes and <b>electrodialysis</b> systems has enabled high efficiency treatment of flue-gas desulfurization wastewater to meet recent EPA discharge limits. The treatment approach is similar for other highly scaling industrial wastewaters.|$|E
25|$|Less {{than half}} of the tartaric acid found in grapes is free standing, with the {{majority}} of the concentration present as potassium acid salt. During fermentation, these tartrates bind with the lees, pulp debris and precipitated tannins and pigments. While some variance among grape varieties and wine regions exists, generally about half of the deposits are soluble in the alcoholic mixture of wine. The crystallization of these tartrates can happen at unpredictable times, and in a wine bottle may appear like broken glass, though they are in fact harmless. Winemakers will often put the wine through cold stabilization, where it is exposed to temperatures below freezing to encourage the tartrates to crystallize and precipitate out of the wine, or <b>electrodialysis</b> which removes the tartrates via a membrane process.|$|E
25|$|Marine energy (also {{sometimes}} referred to as ocean energy) refers to the energy carried by ocean waves, tides, salinity, and ocean temperature differences. The movement of water in the world's oceans creates a vast store of kinetic energy, or energy in motion. This energy can be harnessed to generate electricity to power homes, transport and industries. The term marine energy encompasses both wave powerpower from surface waves, and tidal powerobtained from the kinetic energy of large bodies of moving water. Reverse <b>electrodialysis</b> (RED) is a technology for generating electricity by mixing fresh river water and salty sea water in large power cells designed for this purpose; as of 2016 it is being tested at a small scale (50 kW). Offshore wind power is not a form of marine energy, as wind power is derived from the wind, even if the wind turbines are placed over water. The oceans have a tremendous amount of energy and are close to many if not most concentrated populations. Ocean energy has the potential of providing a substantial amount of new renewable energy around the world.|$|E

50|$|<b>Electrodialysis</b> (ED) {{is used to}} {{transport}} salt ions from one solution through ion-exchange membranes to another solution {{under the influence of}} an applied electric potential difference. This is done in a configuration called an <b>electrodialysis</b> cell. The cell consists of a feed (dilute) compartment and a concentrate (brine) compartment formed by an anion exchange membrane and a cation exchange membrane placed between two electrodes. In almost all practical <b>electrodialysis</b> processes, multiple <b>electrodialysis</b> cells are arranged into a configuration called an <b>electrodialysis</b> with alternating anion and cation exchange membranes forming the multiple <b>electrodialysis</b> cells. <b>Electrodialysis</b> processes are different from distillation techniques and other membrane based processes (such as reverse osmosis (RO)) in that dissolved species are moved away from the feed stream rather than the reverse. Because the quantity of dissolved species in the feed stream is far less than that of the fluid, <b>electrodialysis</b> offers the practical advantage of much higher feed recovery in many applications.|$|E

50|$|<b>Electrodialysis</b> {{reversal}} (EDR) is an <b>electrodialysis</b> reversal {{water desalination}} membrane {{process that has}} been commercially used since the early 1960s. An electric current migrates dissolved salt ions, including fluorides, nitrates and sulfates, through an <b>electrodialysis</b> stack consisting of alternating layers of cationic and anionic ion exchange membranes. Periodically, the direction of ion flow is reversed by reversing the polarity of the applied electric current.|$|E
50|$|Ion-exchange {{membranes}} {{are traditionally}} used in <b>electrodialysis</b> or diffusion dialysis {{by means of}} an electrical potential or concentration gradient, respectively, to selectivity transport cationic and anionic species. When applied in an <b>electrodialysis</b> desalination process, anion- and cation-exchange membranes are typically arranged in an alternating pattern between two electrodes (an anode and a cathode) within the <b>electrodialysis</b> stack. A galvanic potential is supplied as a voltage generated at the electrodes.|$|E

50|$|Other {{methods for}} {{treating}} water include UV disinfection, oxidation, and <b>electrodialysis</b> reversal for salinity.|$|E
50|$|In application, <b>electrodialysis</b> {{systems can}} be {{operated}} as continuous production or batch production processes. In a continuous process, feed is passed through {{a sufficient number of}} stacks placed in series to produce the final desired product quality. In batch processes, the diluate and/or concentrate streams are re-circulated through the <b>electrodialysis</b> systems until the final product or concentrate quality is achieved.|$|E
5000|$|As with RO, <b>electrodialysis</b> systems require feed {{pretreatment}} {{to remove}} species that coat, precipitate onto, or otherwise [...] "foul" [...] {{the surface of}} the ion exchange membranes. This fouling decreases the efficiency of the <b>electrodialysis</b> system. Species of concern include calcium and magnesium hardness, suspended solids, silica, and organic compounds. Water softening can be used to remove hardness, and micrometre or multimedia filtration can be used to remove suspended solids. Hardness in particular is a concern since scaling can build up on the membranes. Various chemicals are also available to help prevent scaling. Also, <b>electrodialysis</b> reversal systems seek to minimize scaling by periodically reversing the flows of diluate and concentrate and polarity of the electrodes.|$|E
50|$|Both Reverse osmosis and <b>electrodialysis</b> (also called <b>electrodialysis</b> reversal) {{can remove}} arsenic {{with a net}} ionic charge. (Note that arsenic oxide, As2O3, is a common form of arsenic in {{groundwater}} that is soluble, but has no net charge.) Some utilities presently use one of these methods to reduce total dissolved solids and therefore improve taste. A problem with both methods is the production of high-salinity waste water, called brine, or concentrate, which then must be disposed of.|$|E
50|$|<b>Electrodialysis</b> has {{inherent}} limitations, working best at removing {{low molecular}} weight ionic components from a feed stream. Non-charged, higher molecular weight, and less mobile ionic species will not typically be significantly removed. Also, in contrast to RO, <b>electrodialysis</b> becomes less economical when extremely low salt concentrations in the product are required and with sparingly conductive feeds: current density becomes limited and current utilization efficiency typically decreases as the feed salt concentration becomes lower, and with fewer ions in solution to carry current, both ion transport and energy efficiency greatly declines. Consequently, comparatively large membrane areas are required to satisfy capacity requirements for low concentration (and sparingly conductive) feed solutions. Innovative systems overcoming the inherent limitations of <b>electrodialysis</b> (and RO) are available; these integrated systems work synergistically, with each sub-system operating in its optimal range, providing the least overall operating and capital costs for a particular application.|$|E
50|$|Exemplary {{applications}} of ion-exchange membranes utilized in <b>electrodialysis</b> and EDR include seawater desalination, industrial wastewater treatment of highly scaling waters, {{food and beverage}} production, and other industrial wastewaters.|$|E
50|$|Another {{important}} {{application for}} <b>electrodialysis</b> is {{the production of}} pure water and ultrapure water by electrodeionization (EDI). In EDI, the purifying compartments and sometimes the concentrating compartments of the <b>electrodialysis</b> stack are filled with ion exchange resin. When fed with low TDS feed (e.g., feed purified by RO), the product can reach very high purity levels (e.g., 18 MΩ-cm). The ion exchange resins act to retain the ions, allowing these to be transported across the ion exchange membranes. The main usage of EDI systems are in electronics, pharmaceutical, power generation, and cooling tower applications.|$|E
50|$|The major {{application}} of <b>electrodialysis</b> {{has historically been}} the desalination of brackish water or seawater {{as an alternative to}} RO for potable water production and seawater concentration for salt production (primarily in Japan). In normal potable water production without the requirement of high recoveries, reverse osmosis is generally believed to be more cost-effective when total dissolved solids (TDS) are 3,000 parts per million (ppm) or greater, while <b>electrodialysis</b> is more cost-effective for TDS feed concentrations less than 3,000 ppm or when high recoveries of the feed are required.|$|E
50|$|Other recent {{developmental}} {{work has}} focused on integrating reverse osmosis with <b>electrodialysis</b> to improve recovery of valuable deionized products, or to minimize the volume of concentrate requiring discharge or disposal.|$|E

50|$|Besides {{being made}} as bead-shaped materials, ion-exchange resins are also {{produced}} as membranes. These ion-exchange membranes, {{which are made}} of highly cross-linked ion-exchange resins that allow passage of ions, but not of water, are used for <b>electrodialysis.</b>|$|E
50|$|Brine {{treatment}} technologies may include: {{membrane filtration}} processes, such as reverse osmosis; ion exchange {{processes such as}} <b>electrodialysis</b> or weak acid cation exchange; or evaporation processes, such as brine concentrators and crystallizers employing mechanical vapour recompression and steam.|$|E
50|$|A typical {{industrial}} <b>electrodialysis</b> stack {{consists of}} two chambers: a product-water chamber and a concentrate-reject chamber.

50|$|Polymer {{membranes}} may be functionalized into {{ion exchange}} membranes {{by the addition}} of highly acidic or basic functional groups, e.g. sulfonic acid and quaternary ammonium, enabling the membrane to form water channels and selectively transport cations or anions, respectively.

Applications within water treatment include reverse osmosis, <b>electrodialysis,</b> and reversed <b>electrodialysis.</b> Applications within energy storage include rechargeable metal-air electrochemical cells and various types of flow battery.
