25|$|In 2000, cod {{was placed}} on the list of {{endangered}} species by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), an international non-governmental organization for the conservation, research and restoration of the natural environment, formerly named the World Wildlife Fund. The WWF issued a report stating that global cod catch had suffered a 70 per cent drop over the last 30 years, and that if this trend continued, the world's cod stocks would disappear in 15 years. The endangered species claim by the WWF was disputed by Åsmund Bjordal, director of the Norwegian Institute of Marine Research, who stated that in view of the health of the Barents Sea cod population, cod should not be placed on an endangered species list. Cod is among Norway's most important fishery export items, and the Barents Sea is the most important cod fishery of Norway. In a 2004 report, the WWF agreed that the Barents Sea cod fishery appeared to be healthy but that that may not last due to illegal fishing, industrial development, and high <b>fishing</b> <b>quota.</b>|$|E

500|$|The western North Atlantic {{porbeagle}} {{population has}} a more positive prospect than in the eastern North Atlantic. Fishing in Canadian waters was originally regulated by the 1995 Fisheries Management Plan for pelagic sharks in Atlantic Canada, which established an annual quota of 1,500 tons, restricted the time, place, and gear types allowed for commercial fishing, and set limits for bycatch and recreational fishing. In 2000–2001, Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) prepared a detailed population model and concluded that a quota of 200–250 tons would allow for population growth, resulting in a quota of 250 tons being adopted {{for the period of}} 2002–2007. The mating ground off of Newfoundland was also closed to shark fishing. [...] In 2004, the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) listed the porbeagle as Endangered, largely {{on the basis of the}} low population abundance (<25% of original numbers). Canada decided not to list the species under its Species At Risk Act, but further reduced the total <b>fishing</b> <b>quota</b> to 185 tons. [...] In US waters, the 1993 Fishery Management Plan for Sharks of the Atlantic Ocean sets an annual quota of 92 tons (post-processing) for the porbeagle. In 2006, this species was listed as a Species of Concern by the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), meaning that it merits conservation concern but there is insufficient data for inclusion on the US Endangered Species Act.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the extent}} to which specialisation gains can be achieved by liberalising access to <b>fishing</b> <b>quotas</b> within the European Union (EU). <b>Fishing</b> <b>quotas</b> are today exchanged between EU member states at a rate of 4 % of total turnover in EU fisheries. Germany, Belgium, Denmark and the Netherlands are the most active. Only one fourth of these exchanges are permanent. With the management systems in EU fisheries differing among countries, comparative advantages in fisheries exist in member states with the best management practices. Hence, although positive but small specialisation gains exist in EU fisheries today, these gains might potentially be increased by liberalising access to <b>fishing</b> <b>quotas</b> and allowing transferability of quotas between individuals from different countries on a permanent basis. Increasing the gains might, however, affect relative stability. Liberalising access to fisheries Specialisation Comparative advantage Economic gains Quota exchange...|$|R
2500|$|Japan, Norway, Peru, and the Soviet Union (later {{replaced}} by Russia) lodged formal objections, since the moratorium was {{not based on}} advice from the Scientific Committee. Japan and Peru later withdrew their objections (Japan's withdrawal was precipitated by the US threatening to reduce their <b>fishing</b> <b>quota</b> within US waters if the objection was not withdrawn. [...] However, by 1988 the US had eliminated Japanese fishing quotas anyway. [...] It was after this that the Japanese began scientific whaling.). In 2002, Iceland was allowed to rejoin IWC with a reservation to the moratorium (Iceland withdrew from IWC in 1992), but this reservation is not recognised as a valid objection by many IWC members. In addition, Italy, Mexico, and New Zealand do not consider the ICRW {{to be in force}} between their countries and Iceland. None of these countries, however, has mounted any legal challenge to Iceland's membership of the IWC.|$|E

For shared stocks, the optimal degree of enforcement in one country depends critically on the degree of enforcement achieved by the other countries involved.
