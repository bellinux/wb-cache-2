40|$|Based on a {{time series}} of ocean climate indices and catch records for seven pelagic fish speciesin the Tsushima Warm Current (TWC) and Kuroshio-Oyashio Current (KOC) regions from 1910 to 2004, wedetected {{regional}} synchrony {{in the long-term}} fluctuations of the fish populations and identified alternation patternsof dominant species related to climate shifts. The annual catches of Pacific herring, <b>Japanese</b> sardines,Japanese anchovies, <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel,</b> chub mackerel, Pacific saury and common squid in the TWC regionfluctuated in phase {{with those in the}} KOC region, which suggests that they were controlled by the samebasin-wide climate forcing. After the collapse of the herring fishery, the alternation sequence was: sardines(1930 s), Pacific saury, <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel,</b> common squid and anchovies (1950 s∼ 1960 s), herring (late 1960 s∼early 1970 s), chub mackerel (1970 s) and then sardines (1980 s). As sardine biomass decreased in the late stages ofthe cool regime, catch of the other four species increased immediately during the warm period of the 1990 s. Regional differences in the amplitude of long-term catch fluctuations for the seven pelagic fishes could beexplained by regional differences in availability, fishing techniques and activity...|$|R

5000|$|Fishing {{boats are}} {{generally}} small, often {{little more than}} 30 m but up to 100 m for a large tuna or whaling ship. Aboard a fish processing vessel, the catch can be made ready for market and sold more quickly once the ship makes port. Special purpose vessels have special gear. For example, trawlers have winches and arms, stern-trawlers have a rear ramp, and tuna seiners have skiffs. In 2004, 85800000 t of fish {{were caught in the}} marine capture fishery. Anchoveta represented the largest single catch at 10700000 t. [...] That year, the top ten marine capture species also included Alaska pollock, Blue whiting, Skipjack tuna, Atlantic herring, Chub <b>mackerel,</b> <b>Japanese</b> anchovy, Chilean <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel,</b> Largehead hairtail, and Yellowfin tuna. [...] Other species including salmon, shrimp, lobster, clams, squid and crab, are also commercially fished. Modern commercial fishermen use many methods. One is fishing by nets, such as purse seine, beach seine, lift nets, gillnets, or entangling nets. Another is trawling, including bottom trawl. Hooks and lines are used in methods like long-line fishing and hand-line fishing. Another method is the use of fishing trap.|$|R

40|$|Recent {{studies in}} streams and ponds have {{demonstrated}} that the distribution and biomass of aquatic organisms can be estimated by detection and quantification of environmental DNA (eDNA). In more open systems such as seas, it is not evident whether eDNA can represent the distribution and biomass of aquatic organisms because various environmental factors (e. g., water flow) are expected to affect eDNA distribution and concentration. To test {{the relationships between the}} distribution of fish and eDNA, we conducted a grid survey in Maizuru Bay, Sea of Japan, and sampled surface and bottom waters while monitoring biomass of the <b>Japanese</b> <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel</b> (Trachurus japonicus) using echo sounder technology. A linear model showed a high R 2 value (0. 665) without outlier data points, and the association between estimated eDNA concentrations from the surface water samples and echo intensity was significantly positive, suggesting that the estimated spatial variation in eDNA concentration can reflect the local biomass of the jack mackerel. We also found that a bestfit model included echo intensity obtained within 10 – 150 m from water sampling sites, indicating that the estimated eDNA concentration most likely reflects fish biomass within 150 min the bay. Although eDNA from a wholesale fish market partially affected eDNA concentration, we conclude that eDNA generally provides a ‘snapshot’ of fish distribution and biomass in a large area. Further studies in which dynamics of eDNA under field conditions (e. g., patterns of release, degradation, and diffusion of eDNA) are taken into account will provide a better estimate of fish distribution and biomass based on eDNA...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The spatial {{distribution}} of fish on feeding grounds {{is an important factor}} in determining their prey composition. Of the factors that may influence the {{spatial distribution}} on the feeding ground and sub-sequent diet composition is the fish maturation stage. Using hairtail (Trichiurus japonicus) as an example, we evaluated the impacts of gonad development stage on diet composition. Hairtail supports one of the most valuable and largest fisheries in the East China Sea. As one of the top predators, it plays an important role in the ecosystem. We analyzed hairtail stomach samples collected on their feeding grounds from a fisheries-independent survey program in September 2005. Our analyses suggest that females in their third maturity stage tended to feed more intensively. Fish were the most important preys for hairtail, accounting for 72. 6 % of the total stomach contents in weight. The four most important fish species were juvenile hairtail (25. 2 %), Japanese scad (11. 4 %), <b>Japanese</b> <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel</b> (7. 7 %), and small yellow croaker (5. 9 %), suggesting strong cannibalism. A cluster analysis suggests that hairtail could be divided into three groups in their spatial distribution based on their diets: one group with similar percentages of fish and crustacean preys mainly distributed in the south of East China Sea far from the coast; one group mainly consuming fish and distributed over the north of East China Sea near the coast; and the third group consuming mainly crustacean species mainly distributed in the open sea. We hypothesize that gonadal development stage of hairtail may deter-mine their movement from spawning ground to feeding ground, and subsequently spatial distribution on the feeding ground, which in turn results in different feeding intensities and prey compositions...|$|E
40|$|South Pacific <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel,</b> Trachurus murphyi, has an ocean-scale distribution, {{from the}} South American {{coastline}} to New Zealand and Tasmania. This fish, captured by Humans since the Holocene, is nowadays heavily exploited and its population has decreased substantially since the mid- 1990 s. The uncertainty associated to <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel</b> population structure currently hampers management. Several hypotheses {{have been proposed}} from a single population up to several discrete populations. Still no definitive answer was given. Determining how environmental conditions drive <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel</b> distribution can provide insights on its population structure. To do so, here we performed in three steps. First, we used satellite data to develop a statistical model of <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel</b> horizontal habitat suitability. Model predictions based on interaction between temperature and chlorophyll-a match the observed <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel</b> distribution, even during extreme El Niño event. Second, we studied the impact of oxygen and show that <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel</b> distribution and abundance is correlated to oxygen over {{a wide variety of}} scales and avoid low oxygen areas and periods. Third, {{on the basis of the}} above we built a conceptual 3 D model of <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel</b> habitat in the Southeastern Pacific. We reveal the presence of a low suitable habitat along the Chilean and Peruvian coast, figuratively presenting a closed door caused by a gap in the horizontal habitat at ∼ 19 – 22 °S and a shallow oxycline off south-centre Peru. This kind of situation likely occurs on a seasonal basis, in austral summer but also at longer temporal scales. A lack of exchanges at some periods/seasons partially isolate <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel</b> distributed off Peru. On the other hand the continuity in the habitat during most of the year explains why exchanges occur. We conclude that the more likely population structure for <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel</b> is a pelagic metapopulation...|$|R
50|$|The Pacific <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel</b> (Trachurus symmetricus) (also {{known as}} the Californian <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel</b> or simply <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel),</b> is an {{abundant}} species of pelagic marine fish in the jack family, Carangidae.

40|$|The {{study on}} Hydrography and <b>Jack</b> <b>Mackerel</b> stock (Trachurus murphyi) in the South Pacific is {{currently}} one year underway. The main achievement consisted of collecting detailed datasets on Chilean, Peruvian and European fisheries activities {{and information on}} the hydrographical / biochemical and environmental conditions present in the South Pacific. The hydrographical and environmental datasets {{are based on the}} analyses of available acoustic information collected on-board survey and fishing vessels and satellite imagery data. <b>Jack</b> <b>Mackerel</b> habitat models are being developed based on these datasets. These models will be used to produce maps of the potential habitat of <b>Jack</b> <b>Mackerel,</b> on the basis of which different stock structure hypotheses will be tested. The models developed so far are able to accurately represent the distribution of <b>Jack</b> <b>Mackerel</b> as observed by fishing and surveying activities, although some additional investigations are needed to improve the statistical fits. Good fits with hydrographical conditions have been found. The models are not yet ready to be used for testing stock structure hypotheses, but this should be the case in the near future. During {{the first year of the}} project, an extensive literature review on <b>Jack</b> <b>Mackerel</b> has also been conducted, and a synthesis has been written, giving an overview on the species biology, ecology and stock structure. The literature suggests that a meta-population structure can be seen as a potential stock structure hypothesis. The literature review also contributed to identify environmental variables that should be crucial to define the suitable habitat of <b>Jack</b> <b>Mackerel.</b> Previously published results indicate, among others, temperature and dissolved oxygen ranges in which <b>Jack</b> <b>Mackerel</b> is able to survive. Finally, a framework to derive reference points for <b>Jack</b> <b>Mackerel,</b> assuming the single stock structure as used within the SPRFMO assessment, has been developed and made available to the SPRFMO Science Committee for review. Analyses of the assessment results within this framework indicate that the fishing mortality corresponding to maximum sustainable yield might be at around 0. 15 per year with a corresponding spawning stock biomass of around 10 million tonnes. Different harvest control rules have been evaluated and show little risk to overexploitation in the medium and long term, although these result heavily rely on strong incoming year classes. The tools to evaluate sustainable management options for the <b>Jack</b> <b>Mackerel</b> population, when a stock structure other than a single one is assumed, are currently under development. The design of scenarios to be tested depend on the results of the habitat modelling exercises. Therefore, preliminary results will only become available early 2014...|$|R
50|$|The Pacific <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel</b> is {{classified}} within the genus Trachurus, {{commonly known as}} the horse <b>mackerels</b> or <b>jack</b> <b>mackerels.</b> Trachurus is part of the jack family Carangidae, a group of perciform fish in the suborder Percoidei.
