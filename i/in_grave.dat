5|$|Soegija and {{his classmates}} sailed to Uden, in the Netherlands, {{to further their}} studies in 1919. In Uden Soegija spent a year further {{studying}} Latin and Greek, necessary for his preaching back in the Indies. He and his classmates adapted to Dutch culture. On 27September 1920 Soegija began his novitiate to join the Jesuits, {{the first of his}} classmates. While completing his studies at Mariëndaal <b>in</b> <b>Grave,</b> he was separated from much of the world and spent his time in introspection. He completed his novitiate on 22September 1922 and was initiated into the Jesuits, taking their oath of poverty, chastity and obedience.|$|E
5|$|While there, Nico {{settles into}} camp life; Percy and Blackjack save a sea monster Percy nicknames Bessie; and Artemis's {{lieutenant}} Zoë Nightshade has mysterious dreams about the goddess being <b>in</b> <b>grave</b> danger. Percy has similar dreams about Annabeth saving Luke from being {{crushed by the}} ceiling of some cave and holding it up for him. Both are unable to act, however, until the Oracle (a shriveled mummy) somehow leaves the attic where it was kept and delivers the Huntress a prophecy. Chiron and Zoë organize a quest, but Percy is forbidden from going because the Hunters refuse to travel with a boy. He successfully sneaks away from camp on Blackjack, though he is almost stopped by Mr. D (Dionysus) who agrees {{to let him go}} because {{there is a good chance}} that Percy will get killed while on the quest.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} jewellery, beads, and charms was also found. 100 beads in total were {{recovered}} from 16 graves, though only two {{had more than}} 10 beads. The small number of beads found in the remaining 14 graves is indicative of how styles had changed; in the 6th century it was customary for women to wear up to 100 relatively plain beads {{at a time in}} the form of necklaces, but by the mid-7th century, the fashion was for a small number of high-quality beads which may have been attached with wire or carried in a bag. A very unusual discovery was made <b>in</b> <b>grave</b> 21– the remnants of a necklace comprising eight beads and two Iron Age gold coins minted by the Corieltauvi tribe of modern Lincolnshire some time between 15–45AD, before the Roman conquest of Britain. Holes had been drilled in the coins, which were more than 600years old {{by the time they were}} buried, to convert them into items of jewellery. Their excellent condition suggests that they had not been used for long, or at all, as currency; it is possible that they had been part of a hoard buried shortly after they were minted and were rediscovered during Saxon times. The discovery of Roman coins in a Saxon grave of this period is unique to the Street House cemetery. It is likely that they were valued because of the cross-shaped designs on the coins' reverse.|$|E

2500|$|Of the crested helmets the Sutton Hoo helmet {{belongs to}} the Vendel and Valsgärde class, which {{themselves}} derive from the Roman infantry and cavalry helmets of {{the fourth and fifth}} century Constantinian workshops.

The Sutton Hoo example shares similarities in design, yet [...] "is richer and of higher quality" [...] than its Scandinavian analogues; its differences may reflect its manufacture for someone of higher social status, or its closer temporal proximity to the antecedent Roman helmets.|$|R
