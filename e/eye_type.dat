25|$|The {{second type}} is named the {{superposition}} eye. The superposition eye {{is divided into}} three types; the refracting, the reflecting and the parabolic superposition eye. The refracting superposition eye has a gap between the lens and the rhabdom, and no side wall. Each lens takes light at an angle to its axis and reflects it to the same angle on the other side. The result is an image at half the radius of the eye, which is where the tips of the rhabdoms are. This type of compound eye, for which a minimal size exists below which effective superposition cannot occur, is normally found in nocturnal insects, because it can create images up to 1000 times brighter than equivalent apposition eyes, though at the cost of reduced resolution. In the parabolic superposition compound <b>eye</b> <b>type,</b> seen in arthropods such as mayflies, the parabolic surfaces of the inside of each facet focus light from a reflector to a sensor array. Long-bodied decapod crustaceans such as shrimp, prawns, crayfish and lobsters are alone in having reflecting superposition eyes, which also have a transparent gap but use corner mirrors instead of lenses.|$|E
25|$|There are a {{large number}} of {{different}} types of fish hooks. At the macro level, there are bait hooks, fly hooks and lure hooks. Within these broad categories there are wide varieties of hook types designed for different applications. Hook types differ in shape, materials, points and barbs, and <b>eye</b> <b>type</b> and ultimately in their intended application. When individual hook types are designed the specific characteristics of each of these hook components are optimized relative to the hook's intended purpose. For example, a delicate dry fly hook is made of thin wire with a tapered eye because weight is the overriding factor. Whereas Carlisle or Aberdeen light wire bait hooks make use of thin wire to reduce injury to live bait but the eyes are not tapered because weight is not an issue. Many factors contribute to hook design, including corrosion resistance, weight, strength, hooking efficiency, and whether the hook is being used for specific types of bait, on different types of lures or for different styles of flies. For each hook type, there are ranges of acceptable sizes. For all types of hooks, sizes range from 32 (the smallest) to 20/0 (the largest).|$|E
40|$|Dwelling is an {{essential}} task to be performed to select keys from an on-screen keyboard present in the <b>eye</b> <b>typing</b> interface. This selection task can be performed by fixing eye gaze on a key for a prolonged time. Spending sufficient amount of time on each key effectively decreases the overall <b>eye</b> <b>typing</b> rate. To address the problem, researchers proposed mechanisms, which diminish the dwell time. We conducted a within-subject usability evaluation of four dwell-free <b>eye</b> <b>typing</b> techniques.

40|$|Abstract <b>Eye</b> <b>typing</b> {{provides}} a means of communication that is especially useful for people with disabilities. However, most related research addresses technical issues in <b>eye</b> <b>typing</b> systems, and largely ignores design issues. This paper reports experiments studying the impact of auditory and visual feedback on user performance and experience. Results show that feedback impacts typing speed, accuracy, gaze behavior, and subjective experience. Also, the feedback should be matched with the dwell time. Short dwell times require simplified feedback to support the typing rhythm, whereas long dwell times allow extra information on the <b>eye</b> <b>typing</b> process. Both short and long dwell times benefit from combined visual and auditory feedback. Six guidelines for designing feedback for gaze-based text entry are provided...|$|R

40|$|The {{ability to}} use the {{movements}} of the eyes to write is extremely important for individuals with a severe motor disability. With <b>eye</b> <b>typing,</b> a virtual keyboard is shown on the screen and the user enters text by gazing at the intended keys one at a time. With dwell-based <b>eye</b> <b>typing,</b> a key is selected by continuously gazing at it for a specific amount of time. However, this approach has two possible drawbacks: unwanted selections and slow typing rates. In this study, we propose a dwell-free <b>eye</b> <b>typing</b> technique that filters out unintentionally selected letters from the sequence of letters looked at by the user. It ranks possible words based on their length and frequency of use and suggests them to the user. We evaluated Filteryedping with a series of experiments. First, we recruited participants without disabilities to compare it with another potential dwell-free technique and with a dwell-based <b>eye</b> <b>typing</b> interface. The results indicate it is a fast technique that allows an average of 15. 95 words per minute after 100 min of typing. Then, we improved the technique through iterative design and evaluation with individuals who have severe motor disabilities.

40|$|Haptic {{feedback}} {{is known to}} be important in manual interfaces. However, gaze-based interactive systems usually do not involve haptic feedback. In this thesis, I investigated whether an <b>eye</b> <b>typing</b> system, which uses an eye tracker as an input device, can benefit from tactile feedback as indication of dwell time progression. The dwell time is an effective selection method in <b>eye</b> <b>typing</b> systems. It means that the user keep her/his gaze on a certain element for predetermined amount of time to active it. The tactile feedback was given by a vibrotactile actuator to the participant's finger that rested on top of the actuator. This thesis reports a comparison of three different tactile feedbacks: "Ascending" feedback, "Warning" feedback and "No dwell" feedback (i. e. no feedback given for dwell), for the dwell time progression during <b>eye</b> <b>typing</b> process. The feedbacks were compared in a within-participants experiment where each participant used the <b>eye</b> <b>typing</b> system with all feedbacks in a counterbalanced order. Two sessions were conducted to observe learning effects. The comparison methods consisted of quantitative and qualitative measures. The quantitative data included text entry speed in words per minute (WPM), error rate, keystrokes per character (KSPC), read text events (RTE) and re-focus events (RFE). RTE referred to the events when the participant moved the gaze to the text input field and RFE took place because the participant moved her/his gaze away from the key too early, thus requiring a re-focus on the same key. The qualitative data were collected from the participants' answers to questionnaires. The quantitative results reflected a learning effect between the two sessions in all the three conditions. KSPC indicated a statistically significant difference between the feedback conditions. "No dwell" feedback was related to lower KSPC than "Ascending" feedback, indicating that "Ascending" feedback led to more extra effort by the participants. The result of qualitative data did not indicate any statistically significant difference among the feedbacks and between the sessions. However, more research with different types of haptic actuators is required to validate the results...|$|R

50|$|Most {{bees are}} diurnal, active during the day. This species and its closest {{relatives}} are nocturnal, leaving the nest to forage in the evening. Its adaptations {{to dim light}} have been well studied. Like other bees, it has apposition compound eyes, an <b>eye</b> <b>type</b> which is effective in bright light. Specialized anatomical differences in the eyes, such as larger facets, make them 27 times more sensitive to light than those of diurnal bees. Cells in the eyes are especially sensitive to the polarization of light that occurs during twilight hours, {{the time when the}} bee is active. The brain also has specialized neurons that help it process low light. In addition, new research has shown that they use more than just light sensitivity to be nocturnal. M. genalis actually uses a neural summation of previous experiences in order to improve the reliability of their vision in dim light. They use this data stored in their brains in order to precisely land and fly long distances in large changes of light.|$|E

Monogenic control for colour expression was found for leaf node pigmentation, flower (petal) colour, immature pod colour, seed coat colour, seed eye colour and seed eye colour pattern. Presence of pigment was dominant over absence of pigment and the black seed eye was dominant over brown eye. For seed eye pattern however, partial dominance of the very small <b>eye</b> <b>type</b> over the Holstein <b>eye</b> <b>type</b> was observed. Different flower colour genes induce similar white flower colours in the parents and non-allelic interactions between these white flower colour loci produced novel flower colour variants in the F 2 population. In the parental lines, flower and seed pigmentation are due to the same single locus effects, although flower colour may be influenced by epistatic gene interactions that have no effects on seed coat pigmentation. Pleiotropic effects of the recessive locus that causes loss of pigmentation of the leaf node include loss of pigment in petals and at least, in a genetic background of lines with a white seed coat, induces intense pigmentation around the hilum.
