5|$|Hobgood et al. {{argue that}} one key {{component}} in equipping nations to develop emergency medical systems {{is to identify}} the aspects of training that are essential for health care providers. In their view, a standard curriculum is useful for identifying core issues, even if countries have very <b>different</b> <b>needs</b> and resources. To address this goal, the International Federation for Emergency Medicine developed a model curriculum in 2009. This initiative seeks to provide a minimum basic standard that can be tailored to {{the specific needs of}} the various nations implementing training in emergency medicine. It is targeted towards all medical students in order to produce a minimum competency in emergency care for all physicians, regardless of their specialty.|$|E

For example, in the fable The Old Man the Young Wife, the text relates a story wherein an old man marries a young woman from a penniless family. The young woman detests his appearance {{so much that she}} refuses to even look at him let alone consummate their marriage. One night, while she sleeps in the same bed with her back facing the old man, a thief enters their house. She is scared, turns over, and for security embraces the man. This thrills every limb of the old man. He feels grateful to the thief for making his young wife hold him at last.

25|$|In March 2013, 16 {{restaurants}} around Taiwan {{were given}} halal certification, {{in a move}} to make Taiwan more attractive to Muslim tourists thereby expanding tourism in Taiwan. The certificates were issued by the ROC Tourism Bureau in collaboration with Chinese Muslim Association (CMA). The restaurants covered are in Taipei, New Taipei, Taoyuan, Taichung, Tainan, Hualien and Taitung. These restaurants cover {{a wide variety of}} food, including Chinese, Taiwanese, Indian, Thai, Turkish and Egyptian cuisine. This move brings the total number of halal restaurants throughout Taiwan to 31. Liu Hsi-lin, deputy director-general of the bureau, said during the ceremony that people from different countries and different religions will have <b>different</b> <b>needs.</b> The key to develop Taiwan's tourism industry is to show respect for these diverse needs. He said that Taiwan is aiming at attracting Muslim tourists from Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore. Thus the bureau, together with the CMA, try to help the local tourist industries cater to the needs of Muslim visitors. Also present at the ceremony is Salahuding Ma, secretary-general of CMA.|$|E

25|$|In the UK, human {{trafficking}} cases are processed {{by the same}} officials to simultaneously determine the refugee and trafficking victim statuses of a person. However, criteria for qualifying as a refugee and a trafficking victim differ and they have <b>different</b> <b>needs</b> for staying in a country. A person may need assistance as a trafficking victim but his/her circumstances may not necessarily meet the threshold for asylum. In which case, not being granted refugee status affects their status as a trafficked victim and thus their ability to receive help. Reviews of the statistics from the National Referral Mechanism (NRM), a tool created by the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings (CoE Convention) to help states effectively identify and care for trafficking victims, found that positive decisions for non-European Union citizens were much {{lower than that of}} EU and UK citizens. According to data on the NRM decisions from April 2009 to April 2011, an average of 82.8% of UK and EU citizens were conclusively accepted as victims while an average of only 45.9% of non-EU citizens were granted the same status. High refusal rates of non-EU people point to possible stereotypes and biases about regions and countries of origin which may hinder anti-trafficking efforts, since the asylum system is linked to the trafficking victim protection system.|$|E
500|$|A {{press release}} for Torchwood Series Four states that Jack is {{brought back to}} Earth because of his [...] "unstated love" [...] for Gwen, who in turn still feels for Jack and misses the {{exciting}} life she once led beside him. Whilst Miracle Day lead writer Russell T Davies states {{in response to a}} question posed by AfterElton that he [...] "hates" [...] the idea of romantic tension between Gwen and Jack, executive producer Julie Gardner answers by stating [...] "They love each other. Of course they do." [...] Myles believes that in series four, Gwen and Jack have a [...] "love-hate-love relationship" [...] resembling in different ways a sibling relationship, a marital relationship and also [...] "the strongest friendship". Episode seven of Miracle Day features a scene where Jack threatens Gwen with violence after she states she would have him killed to save her daughter. Writer Jane Espenson explains that the two characters have <b>different</b> <b>needs</b> and that this means they inevitably [...] "clash like steel blades". Simon Brew of Den of Geek praises the dynamic between Gwen and Jack in series four, describing them as [...] "a terrific double act" [...] and states that [...] "Torchwood is at, or near, its best when the two of them are working in tandem".|$|E
500|$|The {{earliest}} international versions {{were what}} then-CTW vice-president Charlotte Cole called [...] "fairly simple", consisting of dubbed {{versions of the}} show with local language voice-overs and instructional cutaways. Dubbed versions of the show continued to be produced if the country's needs and resources warranted it. They utilized a variant of a flexible model called the CTW model, developed by the producers and creators of the original show, to create and produce independently produced preschool television shows in other countries. The Workshop recognized that the production model developed in the US, which reflected its needs and culture at the time, served {{as a framework for}} other countries that wanted to repeat it. Its inherent flexibility was attractive to producers in other countries, who saw the model as [...] "a methodological approach that is neither doctrinaire nor culture-bound" [...] {{that could be used to}} achieve different results in different countries. According to the 2006 documentary The World According to Sesame Street, the producers of the co-productions repeated the [...] "experiment" [...] undertaken by the original US show, but adapted it to each specific situation. In 1969, the producers of the original show depended upon government and foundation funding, but as Sesame Workshop CEO Gary Knell stated in 2009, the US funding model would not necessarily be effective in countries with different economic and political structures. All co-productions share elements with the American show, but because of their <b>different</b> <b>needs,</b> no two are exactly alike. According to Gettas, the producers of the programs would [...] "rely on variants of the CTW model to help them create programming that faithfully reflects the linguistic, cultural, social, or religious diversity of their native lands".|$|E
