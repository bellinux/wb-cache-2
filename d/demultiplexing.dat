25|$|An FM signal {{can also}} be used to carry a stereo signal; this is done with {{multiplexing}} and <b>demultiplexing</b> before and after the FM process. The FM modulation and demodulation process is identical in stereo and monaural processes. A high-efficiency radio-frequency switching amplifier can be used to transmit FM signals (and other constant-amplitude signals). For a given signal strength (measured at the receiver antenna), switching amplifiers use less battery power and typically cost less than a linear amplifier. This gives FM another advantage over other modulation methods requiring linear amplifiers, such as AM and QAM.|$|E
25|$|During the {{rendering}} process, {{the filter}} graph searches the Windows Registry for registered filters and builds its graph of filters {{based on the}} locations provided. After this, it connects the filters together, and, at the developer's request, executes (i.e., plays, pauses, etc.) the created graph. DirectShow filter graphs are widely used in video playback (in which the filters implement functions such as file parsing, video and audio <b>demultiplexing,</b> decompressing and rendering) {{as well as for}} video and audio recording, editing, encoding, transcoding or network transmission of media. Interactive tasks such as DVD navigation may also be controlled by DirectShow.|$|E

50|$|At the {{receiving}} end of the data link a complementary demultiplexer is usually required to break the single data stream back down into the original streams.In some cases, the far end system may have functionality greater than a simple demultiplexer; and while the <b>demultiplexing</b> still occurs technically, it may never be implemented discretely.This would be typical when: a multiplexer serves a number of IP network users; and then feeds directly into a router, which immediately reads the content of the entire link into its routing processor; and then does the <b>demultiplexing</b> in memory from where it will be converted directly into IP sections.|$|E

5000|$|Transparent OXCs (optical switching) - Switching optical {{signals in}} an all-optical device {{is the second}} {{approach}} to realize an OXC. Such a switch is often called a transparent OXC or photonic cross-connect (PXC). Specifically, optical signals are <b>demultiplexed,</b> then the <b>demultiplexed</b> wavelengths are switched by optical switch modules. After switching, the optical signals are multiplexed onto output fibers by optical multiplexers. Such a switch architecture keeps the features of data rate and protocol transparency. However, because the signals are kept in the optical format, the transparent OXC architecture does not allow easy optical signal quality monitoring.|$|R
