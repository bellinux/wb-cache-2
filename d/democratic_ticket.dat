5|$|Democrats {{had been}} divided in the primary, but united behind Stanley {{in the general}} election. Senators Beckham and Ollie M. James {{endorsed}} him, as did Governor James B. McCreary. Samuel Gompers praised Stanley for his opposition to trusts while in Congress; endorsements from local chapters of the American Federation of Labor soon followed. Even Harry McChesney, Stanley's primary opponent, urged Kentuckians to vote a straight <b>Democratic</b> <b>ticket.</b>|$|E
5|$|He {{was a close}} {{political}} ally of President John F. Kennedy, a {{fact that}} disturbed some North Carolina Democrats suspicious of Kennedy's Catholicism. According to Kennedy's personal secretary, Evelyn Lincoln, Sanford would have been Kennedy's choice for vice president on the 1964 <b>Democratic</b> <b>ticket</b> if Kennedy had lived. In her 1968 book Kennedy and Johnson she reported that Kennedy, told her that Lyndon B. Johnson would be replaced as Vice President.|$|E
5|$|In 1861, Constable {{was elected}} {{judge on the}} <b>Democratic</b> <b>ticket</b> of the Illinois fourth circuit. This led to a falling out between Lincoln and Constable. On several {{occasions}} while Lincoln was President, Constable repudiated {{him in front of}} large crowds. During a rally of more than 40,000 people in Springfield, Illinois, Constable was elected to a leadership position of an organization set up to oppose Lincoln's policies.|$|E

5|$|A Democrat in a Whig district, Powell's {{political}} career {{began with an}} 1836 bid for {{a seat in the}} Kentucky House of Representatives. He campaigned vigorously while his opponent, John G. Holloway, relied largely on his party affiliation to carry the election. This proved a critical misstep for Holloway, as Powell secured the surprise victory. Holloway apparently learned from his mistake. Upon the completion of Powell's term in 1838, Holloway challenged Powell again, and defeated him by a considerable majority. Six year later, Powell was chosen as a presidential elector on the <b>Democratic</b> <b>ticket,</b> supporting James K. Polk.|$|E
5|$|The {{change in}} tactics {{appeared}} to be effective, as October state elections in Ohio and Indiana resulted in Republican victories there, discouraging Democrats about their chances the following month. Democratic party leaders had selected English as Hancock's running mate because of his popularity in Indiana. With their state-level defeat there, some talked of dropping English from the ticket, but he convinced them that the October losses owed more to local issues, and that the <b>Democratic</b> <b>ticket</b> could still carry Indiana, if not Ohio, in November.|$|E
5|$|When the United States annexed Hawaii and {{established}} the Territory of Hawaii, Iaukea {{became involved in}} local politics {{as a member of}} the Democratic Party of Hawaii. In the general election of 1904, he unsuccessfully challenged Prince Jonah Kūhiō Kalanianaʻole, a Republican, for the position of congressional delegate from Hawaii on the <b>Democratic</b> <b>ticket.</b> In the 1906 election, he was elected as the second sheriff of the County of Honolulu, succeeding Arthur M. Brown. He served in this position from 1907 to 1909. He was a trustee of the Queen's Medical Center from 1905 to 1909.|$|E
50|$|In 1904, he ran again, {{this time}} in a croos-endorsement deal {{alongside}} Democrat Edgar M. Cullen on both the Republican and the <b>Democratic</b> <b>tickets,</b> and was elected.|$|R

25|$|Weldon {{served two}} terms as Mayor from 1977 to 1982 and was {{nominated}} for election on both the Republican and <b>Democratic</b> <b>tickets.</b> His efforts as mayor were geared towards defending the town against the violent Pagans Motorcycle Gang.|$|R
5|$|For {{the open}} office of {{district}} attorney, vacated by Dilworth {{when he ran}} for mayor, the Democrats nominated city councilman Victor H. Blanc against the Republicans' Wilhelm F. Knauer. Blanc, a veteran of both World Wars and former assistant district attorney, had been elected to city council in an at-large seat in 1951. During his time on the council, {{he was in charge of}} an investigation into corruption in construction at Philadelphia International Airport. Knauer, a state deputy attorney general, was a long-time Republican party leader. His wife, Virginia Knauer, would later be elected to city council. As in the mayor's race, the Democrats were victorious, and Blanc was elected. His vote totals led the <b>Democratic</b> <b>ticket,</b> exceeding even Dilworth's numbers.|$|E
5|$|In the 1870s, the {{municipal}} government in Buffalo had grown increasingly corrupt, with Democratic and Republican political machines cooperating {{to share the}} spoils of political office. In 1881 the Republicans nominated a slate of particularly disreputable machine politicians; the Democrats saw the opportunity to gain the votes of disaffected Republicans by nominating a more honest candidate. The party leaders approached Cleveland, and he agreed to run for Mayor of Buffalo, provided {{that the rest of}} the ticket was to his liking. When the more notorious politicians were left off the <b>Democratic</b> <b>ticket,</b> Cleveland accepted the nomination. Cleveland was elected mayor with 15,120 votes, as against 11,528 for Milton C. Beebe, his opponent. He took office January 2, 1882.|$|E
5|$|In the 2004 U.S. presidential {{election}} campaign, McCain {{was once again}} frequently mentioned for the vice-presidential slot, only this time {{as part of the}} <b>Democratic</b> <b>ticket</b> under nominee John Kerry. McCain said that Kerry had never formally offered him the position and that he would not have accepted it if he had. At the 2004 Republican National Convention, McCain supported Bush for re-election, praising Bush's management of the War on Terror since the September 11 attacks. At the same time, he defended Kerry's Vietnam War record. By August 2004, McCain had the best favorable-to-unfavorable rating (55percent to 19percent) of any national politician; he campaigned for Bush much more than he had four years previously, though the two remained situational allies rather than friends.|$|E
50|$|In 1886, {{when his}} sons Alfred and Robert ran for {{governor}} on the Republican and <b>Democratic</b> <b>tickets,</b> respectively, the Prohibition Party offered its nomination to Nathaniel Taylor in hopes of making it a three-way family race, but Taylor declined.|$|R
50|$|In 1809, Gibson {{was elected}} on the <b>Democratic</b> <b>tickets</b> to the Pennsylvania state legislature, {{and again in}} 1810. As {{chairman}} of the judiciary committee, he secured {{the passage of the}} Act of 1812, abolishing survivorship as an incident of joint tenancy.|$|R
50|$|On June 11, 2016, Hunkin {{formally}} and officially {{announced her}} candidacy for the Delegate to the United States House of Representatives from American Samoa's At-large congressional district, running {{as one of}} the two <b>Democratic</b> <b>tickets,</b> the other being Mapu Jamias.|$|R
5|$|In {{the run-up}} to the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Warren's name was put forward by liberal Democrats as a {{possible}} presidential candidate. However, Warren repeatedly stated that she was not running for President in 2016. In October 2013, she joined with the other fifteen Senate Democratic women in signing a letter that encouraged Hillary Clinton to run. There was much speculation about Warren being added to the <b>Democratic</b> <b>ticket</b> as a vice-presidential candidate. On June 9, 2016, after the California Democratic primary, Warren formally endorsed Hillary Clinton for president. In response to questions when she endorsed Clinton, Warren said that she believed herself to be ready to be vice president, but she was not being vetted. On July 7, CNN reported that Warren was on a five-person shortlist to be Clinton's vice-presidential running mate. However, Clinton eventually chose Tim Kaine.|$|E
5|$|McNary was the Republican {{vice presidential}} {{candidate}} in 1940, on the ticket with presidential candidate Wendell Willkie; both died in 1944, during {{what would have been}} their first term had they won. They lost to the <b>Democratic</b> <b>ticket,</b> composed of Franklin D. Roosevelt, who was running for his third term as president, and Henry A. Wallace in a landslide. McNary was a justice of the Oregon Supreme Court from 1913 to 1915 and was dean of Willamette University College of Law, in his hometown of Salem, from 1908 to 1913. Before that, he was a deputy district attorney under his brother, John Hugh McNary, who later became a federal judge for the District of Oregon.|$|E
5|$|Philadelphia's {{municipal}} election of November 5, 1957, involved {{the election of}} the district attorney, city controller, and the remainder of a term for one city council seat, as well as several row offices and judgeships. Democrats were successful citywide, continuing a run of victories racked up after the passage of a new city charter in 1951 despite growing divisions between factions of the party. Victor H. Blanc, the incumbent district attorney, led the <b>Democratic</b> <b>ticket</b> to victory. They held the city council seat and took two citywide offices that Republicans had won in 1953. In the judges' elections, most were endorsed by both parties but in the one race that pitted a Democratic candidate against a Republican, the Democrats were successful in seating their candidate, former Congressman Earl Chudoff.|$|E

50|$|Democratic Presidential {{candidate}} Barack Obama won 56.7% of Oregon's vote in 2008, soundly defeating Republican candidate John McCain. Most rural counties favored McCain, though Obama {{improved the}} <b>Democratic</b> <b>tickets</b> performance than John Kerry did in 2004, and Obama's strong {{support in the}} more urban Willamette Valley allowed him to win the state decisively.|$|R
5|$|Though he professed {{membership}} in the Democratic Party, Brady was notably disengaged from politics. In 1843 he was made the interim district attorney for New York County. Two years later, Brady was appointed the city's corporation counsel, a position in which he served two terms, each term lasting for a year. In 1850 Brady ran for, but was not elected to, the position of Attorney General of New York. Brady was on John C. Breckinridge and Joseph Lane's 1860 <b>Democratic</b> <b>ticket</b> for Governor of New York. When the American Civil War began, Brady switched sides and became an ardent supporter of Abraham Lincoln and his Republican Party. He deeply disdained Southern politics and policy.|$|E
5|$|At the 1968 Republican National Convention, Agnew, who {{had earlier}} {{been asked to}} place Richard Nixon's name in nomination, was {{selected}} as running mate by Nixon and his campaign staff. Agnew's centrist reputation interested Nixon, and the law and order stance he had taken {{in the wake of}} civil unrest that year appealed to aides such as Pat Buchanan. Agnew made a number of gaffes during the campaign, but his rhetoric pleased many Republicans, and he may have made the difference in several key states. Nixon and Agnew defeated the <b>Democratic</b> <b>ticket,</b> incumbent vice president, Hubert Humphrey for president, and his running mate, Maine Senator Edmund Muskie. As vice president, Agnew was often called upon to attack the administration's enemies. In the years of his vice presidency, Agnew moved to the right, appealing to conservatives who were suspicious of moderate stances taken by Nixon. In 1972, Nixon and Agnew were reelected for a second term, defeating Senator George McGovern of South Dakota and former ambassador Sargent Shriver of Maryland.|$|E
5|$|In 1907, Laffoon {{sought the}} office of state treasurer. He faced no {{opposition}} in the Democratic primary, but the entire <b>Democratic</b> <b>ticket</b> was defeated in the general election. In 1911, he ran for state auditor, but lost in the primary to Henry Bosworth. That same year, he was elected as one of Hopkins County's delegates to the state Democratic convention. A bill passed {{in the state legislature}} in 1912 created a State Insurance Rating Board under {{the office of}} state auditor, and Bosworth appointed Laffoon chairman of the board due to his experience in the insurance field and as a reward for his loyalty to the party. In 1915, Laffoon sought the post of Commonwealth's Attorney for the Fourth Judicial District, which comprised Hopkins, Caldwell, Crittenden, and Livingston counties. He lost in the primary to J. Elliott Baker, but the Republican candidate, Charles Ferguson, won the general election.|$|E
50|$|He {{was not a}} {{candidate}} for re-election the following year, and was succeeded by Joseph B. Reynolds, who ran on both the Greenback and <b>Democratic</b> <b>tickets.</b> Haight sought {{to return to the}} seat in the election of 1880 but came in third behind Democratic former Assemblyman Casper Peterson and Republican C. W. Thurston.|$|R
50|$|All of the {{candidates}} of the <b>Democratic</b> Front <b>ticket</b> were elected.|$|R
50|$|In 1877, he was {{appointed}} by Governor Lucius Robinson to the New York Supreme Court (6th District) to fill a vacancy. Later that year, he was elected on the Republican and <b>Democratic</b> <b>tickets</b> to a fourteen-year term, and re-elected on both tickets in 1891. From 1887 on, {{he sat on the}} General Term (4th Department).|$|R
5|$|After {{announcing his}} plans for the World Coal Center, Wilkinson began {{attending}} meetings of the Lexington Urban City Council, where he advocated his fiscally conservative political views. He was an admirer of Ronald Reagan, although he said he wished Reagan was a Democrat like himself. In 1979, Wilkinson became involved with Terry McBrayer's campaign against John Y. Brown, Jr. in the Democratic gubernatorial primary. He held a critical fundraiser for Scotty Baesler's 1981 Lexington mayoral campaign, although most of the businessmen in Lexington favored Baesler's opponent. In the 1983 Democratic gubernatorial primary, he served as finance chairman for Harvey Sloane's campaign. When Sloane lost a close race to Lieutenant Governor Martha Layne Collins, Republican nominee Jim Bunning tried to enlist the support of Sloane and his supporters, including Wilkinson. After a month of consideration, however, Wilkinson endorsed the entire <b>Democratic</b> <b>ticket.</b> The following year, he managed former governor Brown's brief senatorial campaign. Already considering running for governor in 1987, Wilkinson had hoped to remove Brown as a potential competitor for that office by helping him get elected to the Senate, but Brown ended his campaign early for health reasons. Through his work in various the campaigns, Wilkinson found that he enjoyed the challenges of competing in the political arena. He lobbied the General Assembly to pass a multi-bank holding company bill allowing banking companies to own more than one Kentucky bank. The bill passed in 1984.|$|E
5|$|When World War II focused President Franklin D. Roosevelt's {{attention}} on foreign affairs, Barkley gained {{influence over the}} administration's domestic agenda. He resigned as floor leader after Roosevelt ignored his advice and vetoed the Revenue Act of 1943. The veto was overridden and the Democratic caucus supported and unanimously re-elected Barkley {{to the position of}} Majority Leader. Barkley had a good working relationship with Harry S. Truman, who ascended to the presidency after Roosevelt's death in 1945. With Truman's popularity waning entering the 1948 Democratic National Convention, Barkley gave a keynote address that energized the delegates. Truman selected him as his running mate for the upcoming election and the <b>Democratic</b> <b>ticket</b> scored an upset victory. Barkley took {{an active role in the}} Truman administration, acting as its primary spokesman, especially after the Korean War necessitated the majority of Truman's attention. When Truman announced that he would not seek re-election in 1952, Barkley began organizing a presidential campaign, but labor leaders refused to endorse his candidacy because of his age, and he withdrew from the race. He retired but was coaxed back into public life, defeating incumbent Republican Senator John Sherman Cooper in 1954. Barkley died of a heart attack while giving a speech at the Washington and Lee Mock Convention on April 30, 1956.|$|E
25|$|Obama and his {{interest}} groups spent $15,334,065. McCain and {{his interest}} groups spent $5,817,988. The Republican ticket visited the state 9 times. The <b>Democratic</b> <b>ticket</b> visited the state 4 times.|$|E
50|$|Lockwood {{was elected}} {{again to the}} 52nd and 53rd United States Congresses, and served from March 4, 1891, to March 3, 1895. In 1894, he ran for Lieutenant Governor of New York on three <b>Democratic</b> <b>tickets</b> with David B. Hill and Everett P. Wheeler for Governor, but was {{defeated}} by Republican Charles T. Saxton. Lockwood was a delegate to the 1896 Democratic National Convention.|$|R
50|$|Where Breaux fell short, Litchfield made {{winning the}} office of sheriff seem easy. Litchfield's reelection margins ranged from 82 percent in 1987 to 85 percent in 1991, 68 percent in 1995, 83 percent in 1999, and 78 percent in 2003. Such totals {{indicate}} that he obtained large majorities except from those who either objected to his tenure as sheriff or who vote straight <b>Democratic</b> <b>tickets.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1950, Dewey {{appointed}} him a {{justice of the}} New York Supreme Court to fill the vacancy caused {{by the death of}} Samuel Null. In December 1950, Dewey re-appointed Breitel to the Supreme Court to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Ferdinand Pecora. In November 1951, he was elected on the Republican and <b>Democratic</b> <b>tickets</b> to a 14-year term, and re-elected in 1965. He was on the Appellate Division from 1952 to 1966.|$|R
