40|$|Signal {{superposition}} {{and broadcast}} are important {{features of the}} wireless medium. Compute-and-Forward, also known as Physical Layer Network Coding (PLNC), is a technique exploiting these features {{in order to improve}} performance of wireless networks. More precisely, it allows wireless terminals to reliably de- code a linear combination of all messages, when a superposition of the messages is received through the physical medium. In this paper, we propose a random PLNC scheme for a local <b>interference</b> <b>line</b> network in which nodes perform random access scheduling. We prove that our PLNC scheme is capacity achieving in the case of one symmetric bi-directional session with terminals on both ends of this line network model. We demonstrate that our scheme significantly outperforms any other scheme. In particular, by eligibly choosing the access rate of the random access scheduling mechanism for the network, the throughput of our PLNC scheme is at least 3. 4 and 1. 7 times better than traditional routing and plain network coding, respectively...|$|E

The purpose {{of this research is}} to compare the load carrying capacity of three (P 3 G) and four (P 4 C) lobed polygonal shafts and hub connections manufactured from the same outer diameter. The P 3 G and P 4 C shaft and hub have been compared for <b>interference,</b> <b>line</b> to line and clearance fit. The conformal contact between the shaft and the hub in polygonal profile makes it difficult to design them analytically. With the advancement of numerical analysis as Finite Element Analysis, these issues can be addressed, making polygonal shafts a viable competitor to keyed and splined shafts. The loading strength of the polygonal shaft and hub connection has been analyzed using Finite element Analysis software, ANSYS®, by subjecting the connection to torsional bending load from a spur gear of 20 ° pressure angle. From the analysis, {{it was found that the}} hub experienced greater stress than the shaft in all cases. The stresses were higher in P 4 C shaft than P 3 G shaft. The clearance fit was found to be the most detrimental fit and interference fit to be the most suitable for larger power transmission. Owing to its small normal axial stress and hub displacement, the P 4 C clearance fit has its use in low power transmission where sliding fit is a requirement. For general purpose, P 3 G interference fit is recommended...|$|E
40|$|The genome {{of plants}} is {{organized}} into chromatin, affecting {{the rates of}} transcription, DNA recombination, and repair. In this work, we have investigated the consequences of reduced expression of some chromatin-remodeling factors and histone acetylation in maize (Zea mays) and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) in their participation in DNA repair after ultraviolet (UV) -B irradiation. Plants deficient in NFC 102 /NFC 4 or SDG 102 /SDG 26 showed more damaged DNA than wild-type plants; however, the Arabidopsis chc 1 mutant showed similar accumulation of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers as wild-type plants, {{in contrast to the}} increased DNA damage measured in the maize chc 101 RNA <b>interference</b> <b>line.</b> In Arabidopsis, plants deficient in chromatin remodeling are also affected in the accumulation of pigments by UV-B. Plants treated with an inhibitor of histone acetyltransferases, curcumin, previous to the UV-B treatment show deficiencies in DNA repair; in addition, the chromatin remodeling-deficient plants have altered levels of acetylated histones after the UV-B treatment, demonstrating that histone acetylation is important during DNA repair in these two plant species. Arabidopsis mutants ham 1 and ham 2 also showed increased DNA damage after UV-B, suggesting that the role of these proteins in DNA damage repair has been conserved through evolution. However, cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer accumulation was higher in ham 1 than in ham 2; suggesting that HAM 1 has a major role in DNA repair after UV-B. In summary, in this work, we have demonstrated that chromatin remodeling, and histone acetylation in particular, is important during DNA repair by UV-B, demonstrating that both genetic and epigenetic effects control DNA repair in plants...|$|E

Notch filters and adaptive interference cancellers are proposed in literature for power <b>line</b> <b>interference</b> canceller.

Abstract-In {{an increasingly}} noisy society, methods of reducing noise {{are becoming more}} important. Filtering has the great importance {{in the field of}} the biomedical signal processing. In many applications of signal processing it is desired to remove sinusoidal interferences while leaving the broadband signal unchanged. Examples are in the areas of communication, control, biomedical engineering and others.

Usually this task can be achieved by the notch filters characterized by a unit gain at all frequencies except at the sinusoidal frequencies in which their gain is zero.
