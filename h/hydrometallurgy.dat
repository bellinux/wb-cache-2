50|$|Egypt also {{declared}} that, {{at the end}} of the 1970s, {{it concluded}} several contracts with a foreign company to build the <b>Hydrometallurgy</b> Pilot Plant (HPP) and in 1982, laboratory 2 became operational. The <b>Hydrometallurgy</b> Pilot Plant designed for conducting bench scale radiochemistry experiments involving the separation of plutonium and uranium from irradiated fuel elements of the ETRR-1 research reactor. In November 2004 and January 2005, Egypt acknowledged that, in 1987, it had carried out acceptance tests in the HPP using unirradiated uranyl nitrate in chemical reagents purchased on the local market while the uranyl nitrate had been mixed with a solution obtained from the dissolution of domestically produced scrap UO2 pellets (with 1.9 kg of uranium compounds). Egypt did not declare it to the IAEA for safeguarding, due to the fact that the facility was never completed and it was designed for bench scale experiments.

50|$|Any {{extraction}} process {{will include a}} sequence of steps or unit processes for separating highly pure metals from undesirables in an economically efficient system. Unit processes are usually broken down into three categories: pyrometallurgy, <b>hydrometallurgy,</b> and electrometallurgy. In pyrometallurgy, the metal ore is first oxidized through roasting or smelting. The target metal is further refined at high temperatures and reduced to its pure form. In <b>hydrometallurgy,</b> the object metal is first dissociated from other materials using a chemical reaction, which is then extracted in pure form using electrolysis or precipitation. Finally, electrometallurgy generally involves electrolytic or electrothermal processing. The metal ore is either distilled in a electrolyte or acid solution, then magnetically deposited onto a cathode plate (electrowinning); or smelted then melted using an electric arc or plasma arc furnace (electrothermic reactor). Extractive metallurgy of ferrous and non-ferrous metals can involve pyrometallurgy, but chemical processes like <b>hydrometallurgy</b> and electrometallurgy are far more common in method of non-ferrous extraction.|$|E

50|$|Precipitation in <b>hydrometallurgy</b> {{involves}} the chemical precipitation of either metals and their compounds {{or of the}} contaminants from aqueous solutions.
