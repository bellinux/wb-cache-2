5|$|Since <b>its</b> <b>return,</b> {{the tournament}} has used an unusual point scoring system. As with most league competitions, three points are awarded for a win, {{one for a}} draw and zero for a loss. An {{additional}} point, however, is awarded for each goal scored. The system is designed to reward teams that adopt a more attacking style of play. Each entrant plays two matches, with the winner being the club that finishes {{at the top of}} the table. The original competition was held at De Meer, Ajax's home between 1934 and 1996. The Amsterdam Arena has played host to the event since <b>its</b> <b>return.</b>|$|E

5|$|Echoing {{the fate}} of the {{previous}} memorial, the new dog was moved into storage in 1992 by Battersea Park's owners, the Conservative Borough of Wandsworth, they said as part of a park renovation scheme. Anti-vivisectionists campaigned for <b>its</b> <b>return,</b> suspicious of the explanation. It was reinstated in the park's Woodland Walk in 1994, near the Old English Garden, a more secluded spot than before.|$|E

40|$|Consisting {{of three}} essays, the {{dissertation}} {{is motivated by}} some existing gaps in the financial real estate literature. First, we exploit {{the fact that no}} research has used the well documented hybrid nature of real estate securities to forecast <b>its</b> <b>returns.</b> Second, we propose the first 'true' comparison of the predictability of securitized real estate and stock returns, as we argue that the previous comparisons done in the literature are biased. Third, we examine the long-run dynamics that govern the relationships between securitized real estate and the three models most commonly used to explain and forecast <b>its</b> <b>returns.</b> Our main findings suggest that the hybrid nature of real estate securities can be used to predict <b>its</b> <b>returns,</b> that securitized real estate returns are more predictable than stock returns in countries with well established REIT regimes, and that securitized real estate is fractionally cointegrated with both macroeconomic variables and the hybrid factors...|$|R

5|$|Like other corvids, ravens can mimic {{sounds from}} their environment, {{including}} human speech. Non-vocal sounds {{produced by the}} common raven include wing whistles and bill snapping. Clapping or clicking has been observed more often in females than in males. If {{a member of a}} pair is lost, its mate reproduces the calls of its lost partner to encourage <b>its</b> <b>return.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Dutch accused Sukarno and Hatta of {{collaborating with}} the Japanese, and denounced the Republic as a {{creation}} of Japanese fascism.

5|$|The {{expedition}} was warmly {{received on}} <b>its</b> <b>return</b> to the Clyde on 21 July 1904. A formal reception for 400people {{was held at}} the Marine Biological Station, Millport, at which John Murray read a telegram of congratulation from King Edward VII. Bruce was presented with the Royal Scottish Geographical Society's Gold Medal, and Captain Robertson with the silver medal.|$|E
5|$|The protests were to no avail. The statue {{was quietly}} removed before dawn on 10 March 1910 by four council workmen, {{accompanied}} by 120 police officers. Nine days later, 3,000 anti-vivisectionists gathered in Trafalgar Square to demand <b>its</b> <b>return,</b> {{but it was}} clear by then that Battersea Council had turned its back on the affair. The statue was at first hidden in the borough surveyor's bicycle shed, according to a letter his daughter wrote in 1956 to the British Medical Journal, then reportedly destroyed by a council blacksmith, who melted it down. Anti-vivisectionists filed a High Court petition demanding <b>its</b> <b>return,</b> but the case was dismissed in January 1911.|$|E
5|$|A convoy {{to return}} the 9th Division to Australia was {{assembled}} in the Red Sea near Massawa from late January to early February 1943. The ships began their voyage across the Indian Ocean on 4 February and, after refuelling at Addu Atoll, arrived safely at the Western Australian port of Fremantle on 18 February. Four of the transport ships continued to the Australian east coast, one docking at Melbourne on 25 February and the remainder arriving at Sydney two days later. After <b>its</b> <b>return</b> to Australia, the 9th Division made {{an important contribution to}} operations in New Guinea during late 1943.|$|E
2500|$|On Election Day, early returns showed McCain ahead. [...] This was due {{in large}} part to the fact that many of the rural areas began to report first. However, Obama swamped McCain by scoring a near-sweep in Northern Virginia, which {{reported}} <b>its</b> <b>returns</b> last.|$|R
50|$|The Foolish Four {{strategy}} was a strategy popularized on the investing website The Motley Fool. The Foolish Four {{was almost certainly}} a result of data dredging.

5000|$|... 97P/Metcalf-Brewington is a {{periodic}} Jupiter-family comet originally discovered by Joel H. Metcalf in 1906 but subsequently lost. A new observation in 1991 by Howard J. Brewington was matched to the 1906 sighting; the orbit was computed and the comet was observed again on <b>its</b> <b>returns</b> to perihelion in 2001 and 2011.|$|R
5|$|After Edmund Halley {{demonstrated}} that the comets of 1531, 1607, and 1682 were the same body and successfully predicted <b>its</b> <b>return</b> in 1759 by calculating its orbit, that comet became known as Halley's Comet. Similarly, {{the second and third}} known periodic comets, Encke's Comet and Biela's Comet, were named after the astronomers who calculated their orbits rather than their original discoverers. Later, periodic comets were usually named after their discoverers, but comets that had appeared only once continued to be referred to by the year of their appearance.|$|E
5|$|After <b>its</b> <b>return</b> to Germany, III. Gruppe was {{deployed}} to the Mediterranean Theater. The ground elements of III. Gruppe arrived in Catania in Sicily on 28 November 1941. Wilcke and his adjutant Jürgen Harder arrived on 2 December, {{with the rest}} of the Gruppe arriving the next day. On 6 December 1941, III. Gruppe was ordered to move to Timimi in Libya. Wilcke claimed his 34th aerial victory on 11 December, during a fighter escort mission for Junkers Ju 88 bombers attacking Bir Hakeim.|$|E
5|$|December 1942 {{also saw}} {{the return of the}} HZL bomber {{squadron}} to Croatia from service on the Eastern Front, where they had flown more than 1,500 sorties. Upon <b>its</b> <b>return</b> the squadron was redesignated 1./(Kroat.)KG after having flown its nine Dornier Do 17Z bombers from Russia back to the NDH. The Dorniers proved a welcome addition to the strike power of the Axis forces fighting the Partisans in Yugoslavian territory right up to the end of 1944. In late 1943, a second squadron, 2./(Kroat.)KG was formed to provide operational training. It was equipped with Italian designed and built CANT Z.1007 and Fiat BR.20 medium bombers.|$|E

5|$|Fears then arose for the engine's future, the {{speculation}} being {{that it might}} remain in the US or even be broken up. After Alan Bloom made a personal phone call to him in January 1973, William McAlpine stepped in and bought the locomotive for £25,000 direct from the finance company in San Francisco docks. After <b>its</b> <b>return</b> to the UK via the Panama Canal in February 1973, McAlpine paid for the locomotive's restoration at Derby Works.|$|E
5|$|Following <b>its</b> <b>return</b> to Australia, the {{battalion}} was re-organised for jungle warfare and {{took part in}} two campaigns in New Guinea. The first of these campaigns came in 1942–2943 when it {{was involved in the}} defence of Wau and the Salamaua–Lae campaign, and then again in 1944–1945 when it took part in the Aitape–Wewak campaign. Following the end of the war, {{the battalion}} embarked for Australia on 1 December 1945 and disbanded at Puckapunyal in early February 1946. Its battle honours are maintained by the 5th/6th Battalion, Royal Victoria Regiment.|$|E
5|$|Following <b>its</b> <b>return,</b> Sea Cloud {{received}} a reassembled rigging in 1947, {{and a new}} set of twenty-nine sails in 1949. The vessel was painted white, and a gold eagle painted on the bow. The ship's reconstruction took nearly four years. Marjorie Merriweather Post retained ownership of Sea Cloud in the aftermath of her divorce from Mr. Davies, since she had originally brought the ship into the marriage. After evaluating the cost of running a year-round crew of seventy-two, Marjorie Merriweather Post decided to sell the ship.|$|E
50|$|The Nationals {{made several}} key roster {{decisions}} with <b>its</b> <b>returning</b> players during the off-season. Most notably, Ryan Zimmerman was moved from third to first base, Jayson Werth and Bryce Harper swapped {{positions in the}} outfield to put Werth in left and Harper in right field, and Tanner Roark was {{moved out of the}} rotation to the bullpen.|$|R
50|$|The {{dramatic}} {{collapse in}} {{support for the}} Goss government resulted in <b>its</b> <b>returning</b> from the 1995 general election with a majority of only one seat. This in turn was subsequently lost after the controversial and closely fought Mundingburra by-election. The Nationals formed minority government after securing the support of independent Liz Cunningham, with Rob Borbidge becoming Premier.|$|R

5|$|In 1805 Integrity {{encountered}} and recaptured a Spanish brig {{which had}} been unlawfully seized by privateers and concealed in the Kent Group of islands in Bass Strait. Having returned the Spanish vessel to colonial control, Integrity was designated the task of sailing to Chile to negotiate <b>its</b> <b>return</b> to Spain.

5|$|In 2010, the {{television}} series Hawaii Five-0 chose Battleship Cove, a housing community {{just outside the}} dock of the USS Missouri museum, as the location for an episode. The episode, with police cars racing down Tennessee and Nevada Streets, featured a number of Ford Island homes and some residents appeared as extras. That year, Peter Berg featured the USS Missouri in the film Battleship. The ship, which was towed off Ford Island for maintenance, was brought out to sea between completion of the maintenance and <b>its</b> <b>return</b> to the dock for filming. Michael Carr, president of the Battleship Missouri Memorial, hoped that the film would spike {{the number of visitors}} to the Ford Island museum.|$|E
5|$|In London, {{astrophysicist}} Dr. Jane Foster and her intern Darcy Lewis {{travel to}} an abandoned factory where such portals have appeared, disrupting {{the laws of}} physics around them. Separating from the group, Jane is teleported to another world, where she is infected by the Aether. Heimdall alerts Thor that Jane has moved beyond his near all-seeing vision, leading Thor to Earth. When Thor finds Jane, she inadvertently releases an unearthly force, and Thor returns with her to Asgard. Odin, recognizing the Aether, warns that the Aether will not only kill Jane, but that <b>its</b> <b>return</b> heralds a catastrophic prophecy.|$|E
