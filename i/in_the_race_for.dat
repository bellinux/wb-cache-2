5|$|S. A. Andrée's Arctic balloon {{expedition}} of 1897 was {{an effort}} to reach the North Pole in which all three expedition members perished. S.A.Andrée (1854–97), the first Swedish balloonist, proposed a voyage by hydrogen balloon from Svalbard to either Russia or Canada, which was to pass, with luck, straight over the North Pole on the way. The scheme was received with patriotic enthusiasm in Sweden, a northern nation that had fallen behind <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>race</b> <b>for</b> the North Pole.|$|E
5|$|The 1907 Tour de France {{incorporated}} 14 stages, {{which was}} one more than in 1906. For the first time, roads in Switzerland were included. The mountain stages in 1906 had been so successful, according to the organiser Henri Desgrange, that the western Alps were included <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>race</b> <b>for</b> the first time.|$|E

5|$|The Barry Goldwater presidential {{campaign}} of 1964 began when United States Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona elected {{to seek the}} Republican Party nomination for President of the United States to challenge incumbent Democratic President Lyndon B. Johnson. Early on, before officially announcing his candidacy for the presidency, Goldwater was accused by Governor of New York Nelson Rockefeller of attempting to galvanize Southern and Western Republican support while neglecting the industrial northern states, eventually becoming one of Goldwater's primary opponents <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>race</b> <b>for</b> the Republican Party's nomination in 1964.|$|E
5|$|American Beauty was not {{considered}} an immediate favorite to dominate the American awards season. Several other contenders opened {{at the end of}} 1999, and US critics spread their honors among them when compiling their end-of-year lists. The Chicago Film Critics Association and the Broadcast Film Critics Association named the film the best of 1999, but while the New York Film Critics Circle, the National Society of Film Critics and the Los Angeles Film Critics Association recognized American Beauty, they gave their top awards to other films. By the end of the year, reports of a critical backlash suggested American Beauty was the underdog <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>race</b> <b>for</b> Best Picture; however, at the Golden Globe Awards in January 2000, American Beauty won Best Film, Best Director and Best Screenplay.|$|E
5|$|As the 1880s progressed, Cope's and Marsh's men faced stiff {{competition}} {{from each other}} and from third parties interested in bones. Professor Alexander Emanuel Agassiz of Harvard sent his own representatives west, while Carlin and Frank Williston formed a bone company to sell fossils to the highest bidder. Reed left and became a sheep herder in 1884, and Marsh's Como quarries yielded little after his departure. Despite these setbacks, Marsh had more operational quarries than Cope at this point of time; Cope, who at the early 1880s had more bones than he could fit in a single house, had fallen behind <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>race</b> <b>for</b> dinosaurs.|$|E

5|$|Despite a {{good start}} (1–0 in a {{friendly}} match against Guatemala after 10 years of failure against this opponent), a draw conceded at Estadio Cuscatlán in the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification (CONCACAF), facing a modest Guyana national football team (2–2) earned him {{the wrath of the}} public. A victory in extremis (2–3) at Georgetown, Guyana (with a penalty stopped by goalkeeper Dagoberto Portillo in additional time) allowed El Salvador to stay <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>race</b> <b>for</b> qualification to the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil. Unfortunately the home defeat (0–1) against Costa Rica buried the hopes of qualifying for the national team. Juan de Dios Castillo was removed from office in November 2012 and replaced on December 17 by the Peruvian Agustín Castillo, five national champion with C.D. FAS.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>race</b> <b>for</b> city commissioners, {{each party}} nominates two {{candidates}} {{and the top}} three are elected. The office was a county office, a holdover from the time before consolidation of the townships in Philadelphia County into one city. The most important of the remaining duties of the commissioners in Philadelphia was {{the conduct of the}} city's elections; they also had responsibility for regulating weights and measures. As in the other races, the Democrats triumphed, electing both Maurice S. Osser and Thomas P. McHenry. McHenry was an incumbent who had served as commissioner since 1945, while Osser was new to the office, having previously worked as a lawyer and {{as the leader of the}} 16th ward. The Republican spot on the county commission went to Walter I. Davidson, a sales executive.|$|E
5|$|Beshear's initial rise to {{political}} prominence was interrupted in 1987 {{when he finished}} third in a five-candidate Democratic gubernatorial primary election. The Beshear campaign's sparring with that of former Governor Brown, the second-place finisher in the primary, {{opened the door for}} political novice Wallace Wilkinson's well-financed campaign to achieve a come-from-behind upset <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>race.</b> <b>For</b> the next 20 years, Beshear practiced law at a Lexington law firm. His only foray into politics during this period was an unsuccessful challenge to Senator Mitch McConnell in 1996. In 2007, however, Beshear was drawn back into politics by the vulnerability of incumbent Republican Governor Ernie Fletcher, whose administration was under extended investigation by then-Attorney General Greg Stumbo, over violations of the state's merit system. In the 2007 gubernatorial election, Beshear emerged from a six-candidate Democratic primary – largely on the strength of his pledge to expand casino gambling as a means of further funding social programs like education – and defeated Fletcher in the general election. Beshear won re-election in 2011, defeating Republican David L. Williams and Independent Gatewood Galbraith. He was ineligible for re-election in 2015 due to term limits imposed by the Kentucky Constitution.|$|E

5|$|The Bears {{ended their}} win drought with a 5–3 victory against Portland. After having gone one-for-18 {{on the power}} play in the {{previous}} five games, Hershey scored a season-high five power play goals against the Pirates, including a hat trick by Crabb. Taffe recorded five assists, the team's season-high points total for a single game. Another victory against Adirondack on April 19 placed Herhsey back into playoff contention, tying them with Manchester, Norfolk and Connecticut at 79 points <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>race</b> <b>for</b> the final two spots. The Bears clinched the eighth and final seed by defeating Manchester 4–2 in their final regular season game on April 21. Taffe finished the regular season the second-highest scorer in the league with 18 goals, finishing behind the Rockford IceHogs' Brandon Pirri at 22 goals. Taffe and Pirri tied for the league high in assists at 53. Taffe was also named the team's Most Valuable Player and made the AHL's 2012-13 second all-star squad. The Bears finished the regular season with a home attendance total of 381,764 and a club-record average of 10,046. This marked only the fifth time an AHL club had averaged more than 10,000 since records started being kept in 1962, {{and the first time}} since the then-Philadelphia Phantoms in 1999–2000. Boyd Kane was named the club's Man of the Year.|$|E
5|$|The Huskies {{proceeded}} to win 25–0 over Arizona State and 45–22 against the University of Arizona Wildcats, with Tyler scoring once in each game. Washington, although unranked at 7–2, was leading <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>race</b> <b>for</b> the Pac-10 {{spot in the}} Rose Bowl. Only four other teams in the conference were eligible for the appearance, as, in the previous August, the presidents of Pac-10 schools had voted unanimously to disqualify half of the conference's members from Rose Bowl contention because of rules violations. The teams disqualified included UCLA and USC, two of the league's strongest teams. The next week, despite not having Tyler due to injury, Washington beat USC 20–10; this clinched a spot in Rose Bowl on New Year's Day. In the 1981 Rose Bowl against the Michigan Wolverines, Washington was beaten 23–6. In a scoreless first quarter, it was originally ruled a touchdown when Tyler dove over a pile near the goal line. After the officials conferred, however, {{it was decided that}} Tyler had fumbled at the one-yard line, which he later admitted to.|$|E
5|$|The revised LC2s {{appeared}} {{once again}} at the 1000 km of Monza to start the 1984 season, with suspension redesigned {{to work with the}} Dunlop tyres. Lancia opened the season with a podium finish, followed by another pole position on the fast Silverstone Circuit for the 1000 km of Silverstone led to a fourth-place finish. For the 24 Hours of Le Mans, both cars qualified on the front row {{in the absence of the}} Rothmans Porsche team, with Bob Wollek's pole time of 3:17.11 being some 11 seconds faster than the fastest Porsche 956's from Joest Racing who occupied the second row. Wollek and Nannini led at mid-race after battles with the Kremer Porsche of Vern Schuppan (the defending race winner) and Alan Jones, only for problems with the gearboxes on both cars to lose the team their lead. Wollek and Nannini at least proved the potential reliability of the LC2 by completing the full race distance and finishing in eighth position, with Nannini setting the races fastest lap of 3:28.90. The team also ran a private entry LC2 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>race</b> <b>for</b> drivers Pierluigi Martini, Xavier Lapeyre and Beppe Gabbiani. This car crashed heavily in qualifying, with most observers believing it would require a new chassis to be repaired. As changing a chassis was prohibited by the Automobile Club de l'Ouest, the car was repaired in time to qualify and race, though rumours persisted that Lancia had broken the rules and used a new chassis to replace the original.|$|E
50|$|Butler {{moved around}} in 1997, ending up running for Schrader and the No. 60 TKO Motorsports team.
