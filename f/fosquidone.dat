40|$|Summary A {{total of}} 61 {{eligible}} patients with metastatic cancer {{have been treated}} {{in a series of}} Phase II trials of the novel pentacyclic pyrroloquinone, <b>fosquidone.</b> Tumour types were colorectal (23), renal (21), and non small cell lung (17). No patient had received prior chemotherapy. The drug was given intravenously as a 20 min infusion at the dose of 120 mg- 2 on days 1 to 5 every 3 weeks. Treatment was well tolerated; the only significant side effects being mild nausea and generalised musculo-skeletal pains. Response was assessed after two cycles of therapy. No patient achieved an objective partial response. A total of nine patients demonstrated stable disease for a median duration of 11 weeks. Using this schedule of administration, <b>fosquidone</b> has no significant antitumour activity in this group of tumours. <b>Fosquidone</b> is a water soluble analogue of the drug mitoquidone, which was {{the first of a series}} of pentacyclic pyrroloquinones developed as anti-tumour agents. Mitoquidone was of particular interest because of its broad spectrum o...|$|E

40|$|A {{total of}} 91 {{eligible}} patients with metastatic cancer {{have been treated}} {{in a series of}} phase II trials of the novel pentacyclic pyrroloquinone, <b>fosquidone.</b> Tumour types were breast (24), ovary (25), head and neck (21) and melanoma (21). All patients, except those with melanoma had received prior chemotherapy. The drug was given intravenously as a 20 min infusion, at the dose of 120 mg/m 2 on days 1 to 5 of a 3 week cycle. Treatment was well tolerated; the only significant side-effects being mild headaches and generalised musculo-skeletal pains. Response was assessed after 2 cycles of therapy. Only one patient (with head and neck cancer) achieved an objective partial response, lasting 6 weeks. A total of 12 patients demonstrated stable disease for a median duration of 15 to 20 weeks. Using this schedule of administration, <b>fosquidone</b> has no significant antitumour activity in this group of tumours.
