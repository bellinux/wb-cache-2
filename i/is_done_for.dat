5|$|Certain African {{cultural}} groups, {{such as the}} Yoruba and the Igbo of Nigeria, customarily circumcise their infant sons. The {{procedure is}} also practiced by some cultural groups or individual family lines in the Sudan, Zaire, Uganda and in southern Africa. For some of these groups, circumcision appears to be purely cultural, done with no particular religious significance or intention to distinguish members of a group. For others, circumcision might be done for purification, {{or it may be}} interpreted as a mark of subjugation. Among these groups, even when circumcision <b>is</b> <b>done</b> <b>for</b> reasons of tradition, it is often done in hospitals. It is not clear how many deaths and injuries result from traditional circumcisions which occur outside of hospitals.|$|E
5|$|Swedbank Stadion has {{an overall}} {{capacity}} of 24,000 spectators. It comprises four stands: the Western Stand; the Eastern Stand and the Southern Stand, {{both of which}} have two tiers; and the Northern Stand, which is terraced. The lower-right part of the Southern Stand also features terracing for away supporters, {{but the rest of the}} stand is seated. The lower tier has 10,000 seats, and the upper tier has 8,000 seats. The Northern Stand has a capacity of 6,000 standing supporters, which can be transformed into an all-seated section with a capacity of 3,000 if required.

5|$|The US Navy Heliox {{saturation}} decompression rates {{require a}} partial pressure of oxygen {{to be maintained}} at between 0.44 and 0.48 atm when possible, but not to exceed 23% by volume, to restrict the risk of fire. For practicality the decompression is done in increments of 1fsw at a rate not exceeding 1fsw per minute, followed by a stop, with the average complying with the table ascent rate. Decompression <b>is</b> <b>done</b> <b>for</b> 16 hours in 24, with the remaining 8 hours split into two rest periods. A further adaptation generally made to the schedule is to stop at 4fsw for the time that is would theoretically take to complete the decompression at the specified rate, i.e. 80 minutes, and then complete the decompression to surface at 1fsw per minute. This is done to avoid the possibility of losing the door seal at a low pressure differential and losing the last hour or so of slow decompression.|$|E
