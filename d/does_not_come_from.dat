5|$|Unlike in {{many other}} moths, the colour of C. rhipheuss wings <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> pigments. The colour {{originates}} from coherent scattering and interference of light by the microstructure of the ribbon-like scales covering the moth's wings. These structural characteristics make this species and its Neotropical relative Urania common subjects of research in optical science.|$|E
5|$|The country became {{independent}} in 1977. Fédération Djiboutienne de Football {{was founded in}} 1977 and joined FIFA in 1994. Football {{is one of the}} most popular sports in the country. Women's football development in Africa has to deal with several challenges that impact the ability to develop a high level of play, including limited access to education, poverty amongst women in the wider society, and fundamental inequality present in the society that occasionally allows for female specific human rights abuses. When high level women's players are developed, many leave the country seeking greater opportunity in Northern Europe or the United States. Another issue facing women's football in Africa is that most of the money for the game <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> national football federations but instead from FIFA.|$|E

Since like produces like, the many different things <b>come</b> <b>from</b> many different things. In other words, there are infinitely many different prime substances. Their total is always constant but their arrangements change.|$|R

25|$|While {{workers in}} V. crabro are fully capable of reproducing, few to no {{offspring}} {{come from the}} workers. This suppression of reproduction <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> the queen herself, but rather from fellow workers. This is probably because by letting only the queen produce larvae, the organization and productivity of the colony as a whole increases because conflicts are avoided. Workers are more related to fellow workers' offspring compared to the queen's offspring, but by eliminating the competition and cost of having {{to get rid of}} queen eggs, the overall productivity of the colony can increase.|$|E

500|$|Among {{the more}} {{surprising}} and, perhaps, counterintuitive (from a neo-Darwinian viewpoint) results of recent research in evolutionary developmental biology {{is that the}} diversity of body plans and morphology in organisms across many phyla are not necessarily reflected in diversity {{at the level of}} the sequences of genes, including those of the developmental genetic toolkit and other genes involved in development. Indeed, as John Gerhart and Marc Kirschner have noted, there is an apparent paradox: [...] "where we most expect to find variation, we find conservation, a lack of change". So, if the observed morphological novelty between different clades <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> changes in gene sequences (such as by mutation), where does it come from? Novelty may arise by mutation-driven changes in gene regulation.|$|E
500|$|Tobin {{experimented with}} various instruments. He <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> a music family, nor has {{he had any}} formal {{training}} in music theory. About his music in general, Tobin says that he {{sees it as a}} [...] "genuine" [...] expression of the time he lives in, as he says that by contrast, blues, jazz, and Brazilian genres were [...] "genuine" [...] expressions of the 1960s. Despite his indirect connection with Brazilian genres, Tobin collaborated with a number of artists on Bebel Gilberto's 2000 bossa nova album Tanto Tempo. Tobin's albums are often compared to soundtracks, and he says that movies by David Lynch have influenced him. In addition, he has stated to like films by the Coen brothers, Dario Argento, and Roman Polanski.|$|E
500|$|... "Blame It on Lisa" [...] was {{met with}} {{negative}} reception in Brazil shortly after its broadcast in the United States. According to The Washington Post, [...] "an immediate media frenzy was born" [...] as the episode started receiving coverage in local newspapers and news programs on Brazilian television. An article published in the Houston Chronicle on April 8, 2002 stated that critics in the country were upset by the inclusion of clichés and stereotypes not related to Brazil, such as Brazilians having Spanish accents and wearing mustaches. The general Brazilian perception was that the episode mixed up their culture with that of surrounding Spanish-speaking Latin American countries. Alex Bellos, The Guardians correspondent in Brazil, commented {{that one of the}} things upsetting the Brazilians was the many inaccuracies featured in the episode, such as the conga and the macarena being popular dances in Brazil; the conga is actually a Caribbean dance, and the macarena <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> Brazil nor is it frequently performed there.|$|E

500|$|While Chaplin's comedic {{style is}} broadly defined as slapstick, it is {{considered}} restrained and intelligent, with the film historian Philip Kemp describing {{his work as a}} mix of [...] "deft, balletic physical comedy and thoughtful, situation-based gags". Chaplin diverged from conventional slapstick by slowing the pace and exhausting each scene of its comic potential, with more focus on developing the viewer's relationship to the characters. Unlike conventional slapstick comedies, Robinson states that the comic moments in Chaplin's films centre on the Tramp's attitude to the things happening to him: the humour <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> the Tramp bumping into a tree, but from his lifting his hat to the tree in apology. Dan Kamin writes that Chaplin's [...] "quirky mannerisms" [...] and [...] "serious demeanour in the midst of slapstick action" [...] are other key aspects of his comedy, while the surreal transformation of objects and the employment of in-camera trickery are also common features.|$|E
2500|$|In economics, {{the term}} sunspots (or {{sometimes}} [...] "a sunspot") usually {{refers to an}} extrinsic random variable, that is, a random variable that does not affect economic fundamentals (such as endowments, preferences, or technology). Sunspots can also refer to the related concept of extrinsic uncertainty, that is, economic uncertainty that <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> variation in economic [...] fundamentals. David Cass and Karl Shell coined the term sunspots as a suggestive and less technical way of saying [...] "extrinsic random variable".|$|E

2500|$|Supplementary dampers {{absorb the}} energy of motion and convert it to heat, thus [...] "damping" [...] {{resonant}} effects in structures that are rigidly attached to the ground. In addition to adding energy dissipation capacity to the structure, supplementary damping can reduce the displacement and acceleration demand within the structures. In some cases, the threat of damage <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> the initial shock itself, but rather from the periodic resonant motion of the structure that repeated ground motion induces. In the practical sense, supplementary dampers act similarly to Shock absorbers used in automotive suspensions.|$|E
2500|$|According to Aristotle, spontaneity {{and chance}} are causes of some things, {{distinguishable}} from {{other types of}} cause.

It is [...] "from what is spontaneous" [...] (but note that what is spontaneous <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> chance). For a better understanding of Aristotle's conception of [...] "chance" [...] it might be better to think of [...] "coincidence": Something takes place by chance if a person sets out with the intent of having one thing take place, but with the result of another thing (not intended) taking place.|$|E
