5|$|And {{where in}} modern {{dramatic}} literature can such pearls be matched—Julie incoherently confessing to her dead lover the love {{she had always}} been ashamed to tell; Liliom crying out to the distant carousel the glad news that he <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> father; the two thieves gambling for the spoils of their prospective robbery; Marie and Wolf posing for their portrait while the broken-hearted Julie stands looking after the vanishing Liliom, the thieves' song ringing in her ears; the two policemen grousing about pay and pensions while Liliom lies bleeding to death; Liliom furtively proffering his daughter the star he has stolen for her in heaven....

However, four NATO member states, Greece, Romania, Spain, and Slovakia, do not recognize Kosovo's independence. United Nations membership, which Kosovo does not have, is considered to be necessary for NATO membership.|$|E
