5|$|At {{the end of}} chapter 51 of Gylfaginning, High {{describes}} how the gods caught and bound Loki. Skaði is described as having taken a venomous snake and fastening <b>it</b> <b>above</b> the bound Loki, so that the venom may drip on to Loki's face. Loki's wife Sigyn sat by his side and held a bowl out. The bowl catches the venom, but when the bowl becomes full Loki writhes in extreme pain, causing the earth to shake and resulting in what we know as an earthquake.|$|E

In their financial report in April 2005, Eidos reported that Invisible War was among the titles to have sold between 500,000 and one million copies since release, placing it among their successful titles. As of April 2011, Invisible War has sold over 1.2 million copies worldwide, placing <b>it</b> <b>above</b> the original game in terms of copies sold.|$|E
5|$|In September 1645 a Parliamentary army {{under the}} command of Lord Fairfax and Oliver Cromwell {{advanced}} into Somerset, taking Sherborne, Cary and Shepton Mallet before turning to Nunney. Two regiments of soldiers with cannons surrounded the castle on 18 September; when Richard Prater refused to surrender, the cannons opened fire {{on the north side of}} the castle, breaching the castle wall. Richard continued to resist, hoisting a flag with a Catholic crucifix on <b>it</b> <b>above</b> the castle to taunt the besiegers, but two days later the garrison surrendered.|$|E

5|$|Kraków's {{early history}} begins with {{evidence}} of a Stone Age settlement on the present site of the Wawel Hill. A legend attributes Kraków's founding to the mythical ruler Krakus, who built <b>it</b> <b>above</b> a cave occupied by a dragon, Smok Wawelski. The first written record of the city's name dates back to 965, when Kraków {{was described as a}} notable commercial centre controlled first by Moravia (876–879), but captured by a Bohemian duke Boleslaus I in 955. The first acclaimed ruler of Poland, Mieszko I, took Kraków from the Bohemians and incorporated it into the holdings of the Piast dynasty towards the end of his reign.|$|E
5|$|The real-life {{surprise}} of the actors gave the scene an intense sense of realism and made {{it one of the}} film's most memorable moments. During preview screenings the crew noticed that some viewers would move towards the back of the theater {{so as not to be}} too close to the screen during the sequence. The scene has frequently been called one of the most memorable moments in cinema history. In 2007, Empire magazine named it as the greatest 18-rated moment in film, ranking <b>it</b> <b>above</b> the decapitation scene in The Omen (1976) and the transformation sequence in An American Werewolf in London (1981).|$|E
5|$|The winning design, the English Electric Canberra, also {{dispensed}} with defensive armaments, producing a design {{with the speed}} that allowed it to fly past most defences. Just as importantly, the design's long, straight wing gave it the lift needed to operate at very high altitudes, placing <b>it</b> <b>above</b> the range where even jet powered fighters were able to operate. The Canberra could simply fly over its enemy with relative impunity, a quality that made it naturally suited to aerial reconnaissance missions, spawning a number of spin-off versions of the aircraft with even larger wings for even greater altitude performance and improved range.|$|E

5|$|During the Cold War, new U.S. Air Force bases were {{constructed}} {{along the northern}} border of the continental U.S.; their most direct route to the Soviet Union was through the Arctic Circle. These sites were high-importance strategic bases for hosting long-range missiles and aircraft. In 1947, the New England Division of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers chose a site in northeastern Maine, within both the Limestone Township and Caswell Plantation. The remote site consisted mostly of dense forest, shallow marshes, and wild blueberry bogs, on a slight plateau over the town, which helped keep <b>it</b> <b>above</b> the fog most of the time. Only {{a small part of}} the base was suitable for farming, so there was little impact on Aroostook County's agricultural community. Additionally, Loring was not far from sources of materials for runway, taxiway, and parking apron construction. The most important benefit of the site was that it was a few hundred miles closer than any other base to potential targets in Europe.|$|E
5|$|The {{troops for}} the Ranger company {{were to be}} Airborne qualified, so the Ranger Training Center heavily {{recruited}} troops from the 82nd Airborne Division and 11th Airborne Division who had already completed United States Army Airborne School. In spite of this, only one Ranger operation in the conflict ever required an airborne landing. At the first Airborne Ranger graduation in November 1950, each Ranger was given a black and gold Ranger Tab as a shoulder sleeve insignia. A few days later, each Ranger was issued a blue and white tab and instructed to sew <b>it</b> <b>above</b> the Ranger Tab. The Airborne Ranger Companies then in Korea were deactivated on August 1, 1951. They were merged into the 187th Airborne Regimental Combat Team {{to bring them back}} up to strength with airborne-qualified combat-experienced replacements. The 187th had been moved to Kyushu, Japan’s southern island to take on a (then Top Secret) mission to save the UN negotiators at Kaesong, North Korea.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{most other}} British canals, the Manchester Ship Canal was never nationalised. In 1984 Salford City Council used a {{derelict}} land grant {{to purchase the}} docks at Salford from the Ship Canal Company, rebranding the area as Salford Quays. Principal developers Urban Waterside began redevelopment work the following year, by which time traffic on the canal's upper reaches had declined {{to such an extent}} that its owners considered closing <b>it</b> <b>above</b> Runcorn. In 1993 the Ship Canal Company was acquired by Peel Holdings; as of 2014 it is owned and operated by Peel Ports, which also owns the Port of Liverpool. The company announced a £50billion Atlantic Gateway plan in 2011 to develop the Port of Liverpool and the Manchester Ship Canal as a way of combating increasing road congestion. Their scheme involves the construction of a large distribution centre to be named Port Salford and an additional six sites along the canal for the loading and unloading of freight. Peel Ports predict that the number of containers transported along the canal could increase from the 8,000 carried in 2010 to 100,000 by 2030.|$|E
