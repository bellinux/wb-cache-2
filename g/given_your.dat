500|$|In an {{interview}} with Q magazine, lead singer Chris Martin stated that [...] "In My Place" [...] was a song Coldplay had left after recording their debut album Parachutes (2000). When the band finished recording their second album A Rush of Blood to the Head, Martin said that the album was complete. However, after guitarist Jonny Buckland played the song on his guitar, Martin said that they now needed to record it and include it on the album. Martin also said that: [...] "That's about where you're put in the world, and how you're <b>given</b> <b>your</b> position, {{and the way you}} look, and how you have to get on with it." [...] In {{an interview}}, Buckland revealed that the song was hard to record, as the band had played the song live. He also commented that when they started recording the song, they did not know how it should sound, due to the band members' contrasting ideas.|$|E
500|$|Wilson, Ted Danson, and Jean Smart {{completed}} the principal cast by January 2015. Wilson appeared as officer Lou Solverson, Danson as sheriff Hank Larsson, and Smart as Floyd Gerhardt, the matriarch of the Gerhardt crime family. Wilson's casting was unique {{because he was}} the only performer to portray an already established character; Keith Carradine played Lou for the show's first season, set 27 years after the events of season two. As such, Hawley did not want to take cues from Carradine because Lou was [...] "at a different point" [...] in his life, although Wilson analyzed Carradine's performance to a point. Wilson was persuaded by Fargo critical accolades and commercial success; the actor said: [...] "There have been several times that you’ve <b>given</b> <b>your</b> heart and soul to an independent film and more often than not it doesn’t match up to any commercial success or people seeing your film. So [...] were like, 'You need to do something that people see'." [...] Danson found learning the Minnesota accent difficult; to improve, he began practicing {{as soon as he was}} signed, often on set before filming began. Smart's role required an older look, which producers achieved by cutting and dyeing her hair, and Hawley gave the actress a book of paintings by Andrew Wyeth to explain her character.|$|E
500|$|Slant Magazine writer Sal Cinquemani {{compared}} the album unfavorably to In the Zone, saying that although Blackout [...] "scores well, and its hotness quotient is remarkably high, [...] isn't {{much of a}} step forward for Britney following 2003's surprisingly strong In the Zone, for which she received a writing credit on {{a majority of the}} songs (as opposed to a scant three here)." [...] Andy Battaglia of The A.V. Club said Blackout [...] "counts both as a significant event and as a disquieting aberration that couldn't be more mysteriously manufactured or bizarrely ill-timed" [...] in which [...] "every song counts as markedly progressive and strange." [...] Alexis Petridis from The Guardian called it [...] "a bold, exciting album: the question is whether anyone will be able to hear its contents over the deafening roar of tittle-tattle." [...] He elaborated that when faced with a public image in freefall, an artist has two options: making music [...] "that harks back to your golden, pre-tailspin days" [...] to [...] "underlin your complete normality" [...] or [...] "to throw caution to the wind: <b>given</b> <b>your</b> waning fortunes, what's the harm in taking a few musical risks?" [...] Petridis commented that Spears opted for the latter and the results were [...] "largely fantastic." [...] Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times said, [...] "The electronic beats and bass lines are as thick as Ms. Spears's voice is thin, and as the album title suggests, the general mood is bracingly unapologetic." [...] Sanneh added that said Spears became a spectral presence in her own album, explaining that when compared to her previous records, [...] " [...] cuts a startlingly low profile on Blackout [...] Even when she was being marketed as a clean-cut ex-Mouseketeer, and even when she was touring the country with a microphone that functioned largely as a prop, something about her was intense." [...] Peter Robinson of The Observer stated that Spears [...] "delivered the best album of her career, raising the bar for modern pop music with an incendiary mix of Timbaland's Shock Value and her own back catalogue." [...] The Phoenixs Ellee Dean said the album [...] "may be more a tribute to the skills of the A-list producers who guided her through the disc than to any of her own talents. But at least she was smart enough to accept that guidance." [...] In his consumer guide for MSN Music, critic Robert Christgau gave the album a B+ and said that [...] "From 'Gimme More's 'It's Britney bitch' hiya to 'Piece of Me's single-of-the-year sonics, from 'Ooh Ooh Baby's 'feel you deep inside' to 'Perfect Lover's 'touch me there', this album is pure, juicy, plastic get-naked." [...] Blackout was ranked by Rolling Stone at number fifty on their list of the 100 Best Albums of 2007. The album topped Billboards Reader's Choice poll as the best album of the year.|$|E

2500|$|On August 8, 2008, Aiken announced, on his {{personal}} blog, {{the birth of his}} son in North Carolina: [...] "My dear friend, Jaymes, and I are so excited to announce the birth of Parker Foster Aiken." [...] The child's mother, Jaymes Foster, is the sister of record producer David Foster, Executive Producer of Aiken's last three albums on the RCA label. [...] "The little man is healthy, happy, and as loud as his daddy", Aiken wrote. [...] "Mama Jaymes is doing quite well also." [...] In his book, , Aiken said, [...] "It's a Southern tradition to be <b>given</b> <b>your</b> first name from your grandmama's maiden name." [...] Aiken's middle name came from his paternal grandmother's maiden name; he and Foster used the married surnames of their mothers to name their son.|$|E
2500|$|On April 25, 2007, after Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid {{declared}} [...] "the war is lost", Hunter wrote [...] "my highest obligation is, like yours, owed to {{our forces}} in uniform, especially {{during this time}} of war... <b>Given</b> <b>your</b> position of leadership within the United States Government, I find your pronouncement of failure irresponsible and dissering to America's armed forces. In {{light of the fact}} that this statement has both been used by our adversaries and has exhibited a marked lack of leadership to U.S. troops, I call on you to resign your leadership position". Hunter further wrote that Reid's declaration [...] "can have no effect but to demoralize the brave men and women, who are honorably fulfilling their mission in Iraq, and to encourage our adversaries... Even if you sincerely believe it to be true, your pronouncement of failure will undoubtedly be used by terrorist leaders to rally their followers – inevitably leading to increased attacks on U.S. and coalition forces".|$|E
2500|$|On September 18, 2006, Allen and Webb debated {{each other}} at the Fairfax County Chamber of Commerce. One of the more {{interesting}} aspects of this debate came when Allen was questioned by WUSA-TV anchor Peggy Fox. Fox said: [...] "It has been reported [...] your grandfather Felix, whom you were <b>given</b> <b>your</b> middle name for, was Jewish. Could you please tell us whether your forebears include Jews and, if so, at which point Jewish identity might have ended?" [...] This led to a booing from the crowd and anger from Allen who admonished Fox for [...] "making aspersions" [...] and responded: [...] "To be getting into what religion my mother is, I don't think is relevant...Why is that relevant -- my religion, Jim's religion or the religious beliefs of anyone out there?...My mother is French-Italian with a little Spanish blood in her." [...] The next day, Allen issued a statement both confirming and distancing himself from his mother's Jewish ancestry. The statement read: ...|$|E
