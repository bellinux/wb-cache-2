25|$|Juan de la Cierva {{invented the}} modern {{autogyro}} (autogiro in Spanish) {{in the early}} 1920s. His first three designs (C.1, C.2, and C.3) were unstable because of aerodynamic and structural deficiencies in their rotors. His fourth design, the C.4, made the first documented flight of an autogyro on 17 January 1923, piloted by Alejandro Gomez Spencer at Cuatro Vientos airfield in Madrid, Spain (9 January according to Cierva). De la Cierva had fitted the rotor of the C.4 with flapping hinges to attach each rotor blade to the hub. The flapping hinges allowed each rotor blade to flap, or move up and down, to compensate for <b>dissymmetry</b> of lift, the difference in lift produced between {{the right and left}} sides of the rotor as the autogyro moves forward. Three days later, the engine failed shortly after takeoff and the aircraft descended slowly and steeply to a safe landing, validating De la Cierva's efforts to produce an aircraft that could be flown safely at low airspeeds.|$|E

40|$|This chapter first {{presents}} {{an overview of}} CMOS voltage comparator architectures and circuits. Starting from {{the identification of the}} comparator behavior, Section 2 introduces several comparator architectures and circuits. Then, Section 3 assumes these topologies, characterizes high-level attributes, such as static gain, unitary time constant, etc., and analyzes the trade-off for each architecture. Such analysis provides a basis for comparison among architectures. These previous sections of the chapter neglect the influence of circuit <b>dissymmetries.</b> <b>Dissymmetries</b> are covered in Section 4; and new comparator topologies are presented to overcome the offset caused by <b>dissymmetries.</b> Related high-level trade-offs for these topologies are also studied in this section.

40|$|The optical {{activity}} of fabricated metallic nanostructures is investigated by complete polarimetry. While lattices decorated with nanoscale gammadia etched in thin metallic films {{have been described}} as two dimensional, planar nanostructures, they are better described as quasi-planar structures with some three dimensional character. We find that the {{optical activity}} of these structures arises not only from the dissymmetric backing by a substrate but, more importantly, from the selective rounding of the nanostructure edges. A true chiroptical response in the far-field is only allowed when the gammadia contain these non-planar features. This is demonstrated by polarimetric measurements in conjunction with electrodynamical simulations based on the discrete dipole approximation that consider non-ideal gammadia. It is also shown that subtle planar <b>dissymmetries</b> in gammadia are sufficient to generate asymmetric transmission of circular polarized light...|$|R

For example, a random mixture of sand in zero gravity has no <b>dissymmetry</b> (it is isotropic). Introduce a gravitational field, and there is a <b>dissymmetry</b> because of the direction of the field. Then the sand grains can 'self-sort' with the density increasing with depth. But this new arrangement, with the directional arrangement of sand grains, actually reflects the <b>dissymmetry</b> of the gravitational field that causes the separation.Pierre worked with his wife in isolating polonium and radium.

40|$|Abstract: In {{the past}} twenty years, {{industrial}} controls have experienced dramatic changes with advances in adjustable speed drive technology. It has been observed that voltage waveforms generated by power frequency converters may affect significantly the reliability of electric motor insulation system. Over voltage problems in long cable drives due to step voltage pulse rise time became an important research area during the last decade. The over voltage phenomenon is usually described using the traveling wave and reflection phenomena. For {{better understanding of the}} processes in long cable drives distributed-parameter representation in simulations is used. The problem with bearing currents is well known. Besides magnetic <b>dissymmetries,</b> other causes exist for bearing currents, such as voltage potential accidentally applied to the shaft, electrostatic charge accumulation, and common-mode voltages generated by unbalanced excitation of the motor windings. Any of the above could cause bearing currents and bearing failures. Recently, common-mode voltages with high frequency and high dv/dt have been a major cause of bearing currents and premature bearing failures in high-frequency inverter-fed, induction motors. This paper deals with this topic, showing experimental evidences between electrical insulation materials life time under two different voltage conditions...|$|R
40|$|Chiral {{plasmonic}} nanoantennas manifest {{a strong}} asymmetric response to circularly polarized light. Particularly, the geometric handedness of a plasmonic structure {{can alter the}} circular polarization state of light emitted from nearby sources, leading to a spin-dependent emission direction. In past experiments, these effects have been attributed entirely to the localized plasmonic resonances of single antennas. In this work we demonstrate that, when chiral nanoparticles are arranged in diffractive arrays, lattice resonances play a primary {{role in determining the}} spin-dependent emission of light. We fabricate 2 D diffractive arrays of planar chiral metallic nanoparticles embedded in a light-emitting dye-doped slab. By measuring the polarized photoluminescence enhancement we show that the geometric chirality of the array's unit cell induces a preferential circular polarization, and that both the localized surface plasmon resonance and the delocalized hybrid plasmonic-photonic mode contribute to this phenomenon. By further mapping the angle-resolved degree of circular polarization, we demonstrate that strong chiral <b>dissymmetries</b> are mainly localized at the narrow emission directions of the surface lattice resonances. We validate these results against a coupled dipoles model calculation, which correctly reproduces the main features. Our findings demonstrate that, in diffractive arrays, lattice resonances play a primary role into the light spin-orbit effect, introducing a highly non-trivial behavior in the angular spectra...|$|R
40|$|With sensitive, vibration-free, self-recording electroscopes sent to {{many parts}} of the globe on twelve {{different}} voyages a precision survey has now been completed of the variation of cosmic-ray intensities both with latitude and longitude, so that the earth as a whole can now be covered with sea-level, equal intensity, cosmic-ray lines. In going along the longitude line 75 ° W., which runs from the far north through Washington, D. C., and along the west coast of South America, there is no appreciable change until the magnetic latitude of about 41 ° is reached. The equatorial dip then begins to set in and shows a maximum decline of 8 percent off Peru and returns again to its normal value off Cape Horn. In going along longitude line 80 ° E. through southern India the maximum dip is 12 percent. In going south from Alaska in longitude 165 ° W. to New Zealand the maximum dip is 10 percent. In going south from Liverpool through the Atlantic Ocean—longitude 30 ° W. —and around Cape Horn the maximum dip is 8. 5 percent. In the region most accurately studied—the west coast of the United States—the intensity remains exceedingly constant until the latitude of Pasadena— 41 ° magnetic—is reached, and then drops remarkably suddenly. In the Atlantic Ocean the drop sets in at about the same magnetic latitude with equal suddenness. It appears also to take place quite suddently at about magnetic latitude 41 ° in the southern hemisphere. Nevertheless, the existence of a longitude effect shows that in strictness {{there is no such thing}} as magnetic latitude. In other words, the earth's magnetic field, even at the remote distances of thousands of miles at which these deflections occur, is strikingly dissymmetrical with respect to any line passing through the earth's center.

40|$|The {{different}} {{patterns of the}} caudal bursa of the Heligmonellidae (Nematoda) are redefined, {{taking into account the}} grouping of rays 2 - 6 and the sequence of origin of these rays from their common trunk. The type of symmetry of the caudal bursa is also redefined. The following patterns were observed and characterized: the basic patterns: types 2 - 3, 2 - 2 - 1, 1 - 3 - 1 and 1 - 4 and the intermediary patterns: type 2 - 3 tending to type 2 - 2 - 1, type 2 - 2 - 1 tending to type 1 - 3 - 1, type 1 - 3 - 1 tending to type 1 - 4 and type 2 - 2 - 1 tending to type 1 - 4. An evolutionary interpretation of the patterns is attempted and seems to follow the direction: 2 - 3 to 2 - 2 - 1 to 1 - 3 - 1 to 1 - 4. Seven atypical patterns are described. The caudal bursae were classified based on their symmetry: subsymmetrical, dissymmetrical and asymmetrical. Independently of the type of symmetry, the two latero-ventral lobes may have the same or {{different patterns}}. The type of symmetry, the ratio between the two latero-ventral lobes and a characteristic pattern were utilized to characterize the caudal bursae {{at the level of the}} genus and the subfamily. The combination of the right/left ratio and the type of symmetry gives heterogeneous results, with no real association between these characters. The most conspicuous asymmetries and <b>dissymmetries</b> were found among the Nippostrongylinae.

40|$|Thesis (MSc (Psychology)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2005. The study {{identifies}} a basic psycho-logico assumption, {{coined the}} premise of locality, which is postulated by the author to permeate most of historical and contemporary psychological, philosophical and scientific thought. In light of the latter supposition the study explores the domain of quantum physics, whence an alternate psycho-logico assumption, {{the premise of}} non-locality, is conceptualised. The semantic implications of the non-locality premise are elucidated by investigating the meaning, character and symptoms of the locality premise. The indicative factors of the premise of locality are enumerated and consequently articulated upon the psychological thought of Jacques Lacan. The study demonstrates how the implicit locality assumptions in Lacan’s thinking are the provenance of the incompatibility of his mirror-stage formulation and the empirical findings of contemporary mirror self-recognition research. Assuming a premise of non-locality the author develops a psychological perception structure, coined dichotomous subject objectification. Dichotomous subject objectification represents the localized experience of the self as subject characterized by the capability for mirror self-recognition. Intuited by the premise of non-locality, the author introduces the notion of ‘non-local perceptum’. The physiological dynamics of non-local perceptum is conceptualised by explicating the meaning of ‘absolute power states’. The disposition of absolute power states in terms of dichotomous subject objectification is functionalised by correlating the latter with Michel Foucault’s conceptualisation of power-relations. Concerning the latter, particular attention is given to Foucault’s understanding of the modern day disparity between disciplinary power and sovereign power; the possible influence of this disparity on the psychological experience of the localized subject is subsequently investigated and a certain ‘cognitive dissonance’ is revealed. Localized psychological experience emanating through non-local perceptum is further illuminated by explicating the logical relevance of Socrates’ idiosyncratic flavour of ignorance. Implementing Socrates’ infamous dictum – I know that I don’t know – the study demonstrates how gazing {{through the prism of}} the locality premise creates scattered patterns of self-referential paradoxes and self-defeating scientific-logical suppositions. Subsequently the study illustrates that if, conversely, localized thought rather passes through the prism of the non-locality premise, the jumbled <b>dissymmetries</b> emanating from the locality prism are transfigured into symmetrical patterns of logical beauty. Concerning the notion of symmetry, the study explicates the importance there-of in terms of the non-locality premise by defining and differentiating the symmetrical [R] and the symmetrical [I]. The study evidences the pragmatic efficacy the notion of symmetry has already provided for the domain of physics in the past, and considers the vital importance of investigating the clinical applicability this notion might have for the domain of psychology in the future. This preliminary disquisition concerning the premise of non-locality is summarized in the conceptualisation of the ‘power to will’. The power to will evinces an alternative approach for addressing the paradigmatic reprise (postulated in terms of the ‘brilliant Greek mistake’) that confronts the post-modern mind...|$|R

50|$|Coaxial rotors {{solve the}} problem of main rotor torque by turning each set of rotors in {{opposite}} directions. The opposite torques from the rotors cancel each other out.

50|$|Contra-rotating rotors like on Sikorsky X2 {{solve the}} problem of lift <b>dissymmetry</b> by having both left and right sides provide near equal lift with less flapping.

50|$|Normally a {{helicopter}} or gyrocopter cannot fly {{forward at the}} same speed as or faster than its rotor tip speed.

5000|$|<b>Dissymmetry</b> is {{countered by}} [...] "blade flapping": rotor blades are {{designed}} to flap - lift and twist {{in such a way}} that the advancing blade flaps up and develops a smaller angle of attack, thus producing less lift than a rigid blade would.

50|$|Before {{this could}} be satisfactorily achieved, De la Cierva {{experienced}} several failures primarily associated with the unbalanced rolling movement generated when attempting take-off, due to <b>dissymmetry</b> of lift between the advancing and retreating blades.

50|$|<b>Dissymmetry</b> of lift is an {{aerodynamic}} phenomenon {{caused by}} the rotation of a helicopter's rotors in forward flight. Rotor blades provide lift proportional {{to the amount of}} air flowing over them. When viewed from above, the rotor blades move in the direction of flight for half of the rotation (advancing half), and then move in the opposite direction {{for the remainder of the}} rotation (retreating half). A rotor blade produces more lift in the advancing half. As a blade moves toward the direction of flight, the forward motion of the aircraft increases the speed of the air flowing around the blade until it reaches a maximum when the blade is perpendicular to the relative wind. At the same time, a rotor blade in the retreating half produces less lift. As a blade moves away from the direction of flight, the speed of the airflow over the rotor blade is reduced by an amount equal to the forward speed of the aircraft, reaching its maximum effect when the rotor blade is again perpendicular to the relative wind. Coaxial rotors avoid the effects of <b>dissymmetry</b> of lift through the use of two rotors turning in opposite directions, causing blades to advance on either side at the same time.|$|E

50|$|Coaxial rotors are {{a pair of}} rotors mounted {{one above}} {{the other on the}} same shaft and turning in {{opposite}} directions. The advantage of the coaxial rotor is that, in forward flight, the lift provided by the advancing halves of each rotor compensates for the retreating half of the other, eliminating one of the key effects of <b>dissymmetry</b> of lift: retreating blade stall. However, other design considerations plague coaxial rotors. There is an increased mechanical complexity of the rotor system because it requires linkages and swashplates for two rotor systems. Also, because the rotors must rotate in opposite directions, the mast is more complex, and control linkages for pitch changes to the upper rotor system must pass through the lower rotor system.|$|E
