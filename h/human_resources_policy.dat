Five aspects on <b>human</b> <b>resource</b> <b>policy</b> relevant for transparency are considered: efficiency and equity, input utilization, learning outcomes, the dimensioning of education, and benefits and costs. Finally, suggestions for improved transparency are considered.

40|$|ABSTRACTThe {{main goal}} of this work was to study the global mindset and {{international}} <b>human</b> <b>resources</b> <b>policies</b> in two Brazilian heavy construction companies. The questions that guided the research were: what determines global mindset and how to sustain it? Do Brazilian multinationals recognize the global mindset as a strategic factor for business and adopt <b>human</b> <b>resource</b> <b>policies</b> to develop it? What is the managers’ vision about these processes?The article examines the most important theoretical references on the global mindset and international <b>human</b> <b>resources</b> processes; then, we explicit methodological procedures of the research, which focuses on two companies, selected from the Brazilian transnational ranking conducted by Fundação Dom Cabral. The {{results of the study}} revealed that, although the examined companies have great experience in global operations, they did not adopt consistent international <b>human</b> <b>resources</b> <b>policies</b> that could facilitate the development and maintenance of global mindset of its directors. The comparative analysis of the testimonies pointed out that the managers of the two companies were at different stages in terms of global mindset: at Camargo Corrêa, ethnocentric orientation predominates; at Norberto Odebrecht, regiocentric or polycentric orientation predominates. Although {{the findings of this study}} cannot be generalized, since it is a case study, their greater contributions are derived from an original study of Brazilian managers’ global mindset, and the discovery of still incipient role of international <b>human</b> <b>resource</b> <b>policies</b> in the development of this global mindset...|$|R

This study explored major factors such as pay difference, language and communication proficiency, cultural/religious differences, skill transferability and employment skill prejudice and discrimination and working conditions. Despite women's qualifications, competence and belief that equal skill mean equal opportunity, the strictures of <b>human</b> <b>resource</b> work <b>policies</b> makes it harder to excel in the workplace.

While there is a popular image of EU staff as over-paid, new employees may find this image hard to square with their own experience.

This situation is aggravated by the EU refusal to recognise more than a minimal level of work experience earned outside the institutions, a particularly malign policy given that {{the average age of}} entry for AD5 ('graduate-level') staff in the Commission is 34 years old (2009 Commission Human Resources Report).|$|E
