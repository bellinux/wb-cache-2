The main new feature of this challenge is that it studied the ability of trackers to generalize to new entities – i. e. new slots and values not present in the training data.

40|$|The task of dialog {{management}} is commonly decomposed into two sequential subtasks: <b>dialog</b> state <b>tracking</b> and <b>dialog</b> policy learning. In an end-to-end dialog system, {{the aim of}} <b>dialog</b> state <b>tracking</b> is to accurately estimate the true dialog state from noisy observations produced by the speech recognition and the natural language understanding modules. The state tracking task is primarily meant to support a dialog policy. From a probabilistic perspective, this is achieved by maintaining a posterior distribution over hidden dialog states composed {{of a set of}} context dependent variables. Once a dialog policy is learned, it strives to select an optimal dialog act given the estimated dialog state and a defined reward function. This paper introduces a novel method of <b>dialog</b> state <b>tracking</b> based on a bilinear algebric decomposition model that provides an efficient inference schema through collective matrix factorization. We evaluate the proposed approach on the second <b>Dialog</b> State <b>Tracking</b> Challenge (DSTC- 2) dataset and we show that the proposed tracker gives encouraging results compared to the state-of-the-art trackers that participated in this standard benchmark.

40|$|Tracking the user’s {{intention}} {{throughout the}} course of a dia-log, called <b>dialog</b> state <b>tracking,</b> is an important component of any dialog system. Most existing spoken dialog systems are designed to work in a static, well-defined domain, and are not well suited to tasks in which the domain may change or be extended over time. This paper shows how recurrent neu-ral networks can be effectively applied to tracking in an ex-tended domain with new slots and values not present in train-ing data. The method is evaluated in the third <b>Dialog</b> State <b>Tracking</b> Challenge, where it significantly outperforms other approaches in the task of tracking the user’s goal. A method for online unsupervised adaptation to new domains is also presented. Unsupervised adaptation is shown to be helpful in improving word-based recurrent neural networks, which work directly from the speech recognition results. Word-based di-alog state tracking is attractive as it does not require engi-neering a spoken language understanding system for use in the new domain and it avoids the need for a general purpose intermediate semantic representation.

It is believed that with the suggested various domain independent feature functions, the proposed model could better exploit not only the intra-dependencies within long ASR N-best lists but also the inter-dependencies of the observations across dialog turns, which leads to more efficient and accurate dialog state inference. best list when the top ASR hypothesis is incorrect. Furthermore, reasoning over different ASR N-best lists is also difficult since {{it is hard to}} decide when to detect commonality (when user repeats) and when to look for differences (when user changes her or his mind) among multiple ASR N-best lists.

To address this problem, we propose a multichannel Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) architecture, in which we treat English and Chinese language as different input channels of one single CNN model. In the evaluation of DSTC 5, we found that such multichannel architecture can effectively improve the robustness against translation errors. Additionally, our method for DSTC 5 is purely machine learning based and requires no prior knowledge about the target language.
