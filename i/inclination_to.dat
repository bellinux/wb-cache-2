5|$|The {{amplitude}} of the radial velocity oscillations {{means that the}} planet has a mass at least 5.7 times that of Jupiter in the Solar System. However, the radial velocity method only yields a minimum value on the planet's mass, depending on the orbital <b>inclination</b> <b>to</b> our line-of-sight. Therefore, the true mass of the planet may be much greater than this lower limit.|$|E
40|$|We {{hold that}} intuitions are a {{subclass}} of <b>inclinations</b> <b>to</b> believe: 1 Not all <b>inclinations</b> <b>to</b> believe are intuitions, but all intuitions are <b>inclinations</b> <b>to</b> believe. 2 We {{contend that the}} proposal unifies {{too much of the}} extant data to be wrong. 3 In particular, it explains why intuitions appear to be used, in philosophical methodology, as evidence, without conceding either that they are evidence or even that they are really treated as such. 4 Our position therefore falls outside the traditional dialectic, where the two sides disagree over whether intuitions should play the evidential-role that they do 5. We deny the presupposition: We say that whether or not they should, they do not. 6 In section 1, we distinguish between something being evidence and its playing an evidential-role. In section 2, we introduce the notion of a credence-entailing mental state and use it to sort good from bad mental inferences. In section 3, we use the conceptual 1 If intuitions are classificatory (see Kornblith 1998) then perhaps they are <b>inclinations</b> <b>to</b> judge, not <b>inclinations</b> <b>to</b> believe.

5|$|The {{statement}} {{that he was no}} strategist can find merit as it was observed that he showed little <b>inclination</b> <b>to</b> contemplate those stretches of the front he did not command and therefore disregarding the strategic field to conduct warfare.

Richard led his cavalry back to Arsuf where the infantry had pitched camp. During the night the Saracen dead were looted.|$|E

5|$|He {{had been}} {{recommended}} {{to me as}} a man of energy and enthusiasm, but he seemed shy when we met. It was only on further acquaintance that I noticed other traits. He was extremely good company, with a sharp tongue and an <b>inclination</b> <b>to</b> dismiss most of humanity as spies and traitors. I rather liked that! I discovered he was very ambitious, perhaps more than his abilities warranted, and also very excitable. He sometimes worked himself up into such a state that he lost all powers of reasoning.|$|E

5|$|Born in Hong Kong, Kaif and {{her family}} lived in several {{countries}} before she moved to London. She received her first modelling assignment as a teenager and later pursued {{a career as a}} fashion model. At a fashion show in London, filmmaker Kaizad Gustad spotted Kaif and decided to cast her in Boom (2003), a critical and commercial failure. While filming in India, Kaif received modelling assignments and established a successful modelling career. However, filmmakers were hesitant to cast her due to her poor command of Hindi. After appearing in the Telugu film, Malliswari (2004), Kaif earned commercial success in Bollywood with the romantic comedies Maine Pyaar Kyun Kiya? (2005) and Namastey London (2007). She followed with a series of box-office hits, but was criticised for her acting, repetitive roles and <b>inclination</b> <b>to</b> male-dominated films.|$|E

Booth was a graceful right-handed middle order batsman at No. 4 or 5, and occasionally bowled right arm medium pace or off spin.

5|$|Duration: For most goods, {{the longer}} a price change holds, {{the higher the}} {{elasticity}} is likely to be, {{as more and more}} consumers find they have the time and <b>inclination</b> <b>to</b> search for substitutes. When fuel prices increase suddenly, for instance, consumers may still fill up their empty tanks in the short run, but when prices remain high over several years, more consumers will reduce their demand for fuel by switching to carpooling or public transportation, investing in vehicles with greater fuel economy or taking other measures. This does not hold for consumer durables such as the cars themselves, however; eventually, it may become necessary for consumers to replace their present cars, so one would expect demand to be less elastic.|$|E

40|$|Many {{philosophers}} {{claim that}} intuitions are evidential. Yet {{it is hard}} to see how introspecting one's mental states could provide evidence for such synthetic truths as those concerning, for example, the abstract and the counterfactual. Such considerations have sometimes been taken to lead to mentalism [...] -the view that philosophy must concern itself only with matters of concept application or other mind-dependent topics suited to a contemplative approach [...] -but this provides us with a poor account of what it is that philosophers take themselves to be doing, for many of them are concerned with the extra-mental facts about the universe. Evidentialism therefore gestates a disaster for philosophy, for it ultimately demands an epistemology for the investigation into such matter as the abstract and the modal that simply will not be forthcoming. We make a different suggestion: That intuitions are <b>inclinations</b> <b>to</b> believe. Hence, according to us, a philosophical argument does well, as a socio-rhetorical matter of fact, when it is founded on premises philosophers are generally inclined to believe, whether or not those <b>inclinations</b> <b>to</b> believe connect appropriately to the extra-mental facts. Accordingly, the role of intuitions (<b>inclinations</b> <b>to</b> believe) in philosophical methodology is non-evidential, and the question of how they could be used as evidence falls away...|$|R

He complained about the lax system for educating priests in Quito and said it instilled slothful habits in students. As a result, the priests had no real idea of their duties towards society and God and had little <b>inclination</b> <b>to</b> study. In El Nuevo Luciano de Quito, he lamented the large number of quacks who pretended to be doctors.

5|$|On February 8, 1992, the Ulysses solar probe flew past Jupiter's {{north pole}} at a {{distance}} of 451,000km. This swing-by maneuver was required for Ulysses to attain a very high-inclination orbit around the Sun, increasing its <b>inclination</b> <b>to</b> the ecliptic to 80.2 degrees. The giant planet's gravity bent the spacecraft's flightpath downward and away from the ecliptic plane, placing it into a final orbit around the Sun's north and south poles. The size and shape of the probe's orbit were adjusted to a much smaller degree, so that its aphelion remained at approximately 5AU (Jupiter's distance from the Sun), while its perihelion lay somewhat beyond 1AU (Earth's distance from the Sun). During its Jupiter encounter, the probe made measurements of the planet's magnetosphere. Since the probe had no cameras, no images were taken. In February 2004, the probe arrived again at the vicinity of Jupiter. This time the distance from the planet was much greater—about 240 million km—but it made further observations of Jupiter.|$|E

Carey collaborated with a number of artists on the album, including T-Pain, Damian Marley and Young Jeezy.
