40|$|Although {{the control}} of cell {{elongation}} in plant tissues by a special growth-promoting substance or substances has been well established for some time, the processes by which this substance is able to bring about growth have remained obscure. Since the general properties of the response to <b>growth</b> <b>substance</b> by plant tissues, in particular of the Arena coleoptiles which have been most extensively studied, have been recently summarized by Thimann and Bonner (1933), only the principal points of interest for the present discussion need be given. These are briefly as follows: (a) The growth-promoting substance of the Avena coleoptile is produced only in the coleoptile tip and passes from there downward (Went, 1928). After removal of the tip new <b>growth</b> <b>substance</b> is formed by the uppermost cells of the stump ("physiological regeneration," Dolk, 1926). (b) The growth of the Avena coleoptile is for some time proportional {{to the amount of}} <b>growth</b> <b>substance</b> supplied to it (Thimann and Bonner, 1933). (c) The <b>growth</b> <b>substance</b> which enters the plant and causes growth cannot be recovered; i. e., is used up (Went, 1928). (d) <b>Growth</b> <b>substance</b> is an unsaturated acid of empirical formula C 18 H 32 O 5 (Kögl, Haagen-Smit and Erxleben, 1933) and readily loses its growth-promoting activity by oxidation. (e) The <b>growth</b> <b>substance</b> is a true hormone, i. e., it acts in minute amounts and bears no direct stoichiometrical relationship to the number of molecules of soluble substance transformed during growth into, for example, cell walls. Thus one molecule of <b>growth</b> <b>substance</b> causes an amount of growth of the Avena coleoptile at 27 °C. which requires the changing of 3 X 10 ^ 5 molecules of hexose to cellulose in cell walls (Thimann and Bonner, 1933). The changes in the physical properties of coleoptiles under the influence of <b>growth</b> <b>substance</b> have been studied to some extent. Heyn (1931), and independently, Söding (1931, 1932) have shown that the plasticity, and also to a considerable extent the elasticity, of the coleoptile is increased after action of <b>growth</b> <b>substance,</b> and that this increase is independent of whether growth has occurred or not; i. e., this action of <b>growth</b> <b>substance</b> is preliminary to active elongation. Heyn also found an increase in extensibility in coleoptiles which had been plasmolyzed after <b>growth</b> <b>substance</b> action, so that it is the physical properties of the cell wall, and not of the protoplasm, which are changed. The action of <b>growth</b> <b>substance</b> has now been further studied, {{and a few of the}} results will be described in the present paper. This study has been made easier by discovery of the fact that short sections of coleoptiles grow at a rapid rate if immersed in a <b>growth</b> <b>substance</b> solution of suitable concentration. This method of using coleoptiles is convenient because, under proper conditions, a large amount of growth takes place in a relatively short time, and the "physiological regeneration" mentioned in (a) occurs slightly or not at all. It has the added advantage that the effect of known concentrations of <b>growth</b> <b>substance</b> upon the growth of younger and older portions of the same coleoptile may be examined independently...|$|E
40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{unilateral}} growth hormone application to young coleoptiles and hypocotyls causes negative curvatures (<b>growth</b> <b>substance</b> curvatures) in these organs. Light affects these curvatures as has been shown in an earlier paper (Van Overbeek 1933) for the hypocotyls of Raphanus. Light also has an effect on the <b>growth</b> <b>substance</b> curvatures of Avena coleoptiles, as will be shown below...|$|E
40|$|The {{inhibition}} of lateral buds {{brought about by}} the application of <b>growth</b> <b>substance</b> after decapitation is not due to a stimulation of the growth of the experimental plants, since inhibition is complete without any accompanying increase in stem length or thickness. The application of two different crystalline preparations of <b>growth</b> <b>substance,</b> auxin B and Hetero-auxin, to decapitated Pisum shows these to be at least as active in causing inhibition as the impure preparation from Rhizopus, when used in the same <b>growth</b> <b>substance</b> concentrations. A third crystalline compound, auxin A, which had lost most of its growth-promoting activity produced no inhibition. The inhibition produced by the application of the growth hormone is not accompanied by any injury to the plant...|$|E

40|$|Since {{the early}} work of Went (1928), {{it has been}} known that the <b>growth</b> <b>substance</b> of the Avena {{coleoptile}} may be obtained in the usual way, i. e. by diffusion into agar blocks, only from {{that part of the}} plant which produces it, namely the tip. The hormone is not recoverable in this way from those parts of the plant, such as the lower zones, which only make use of it. Recent work (Thimann, 1934) has, however, shown that by extraction with chloroform some <b>growth</b> <b>substance</b> is recoverable from the lower zones of the coleoptile. The results of this extraction method confirmed the earlier view that there is a marked concentration gradient of <b>growth</b> <b>substance</b> from tip to base...|$|E
40|$|In {{the course}} of {{experiments}} to elucidate the relationship between <b>growth</b> <b>substance</b> and growth in the plant, {{it was necessary to}} determine whether all of the <b>growth</b> <b>substance</b> applied to the plant actually entered, or, if not, what proportion remained in the agar. The experiments of Went (1928) seemed to show that the curvature is proportional to the amount of <b>growth</b> <b>substance</b> in the agar block. Thus, he found that if its concentration was reduced by some factor, {{and the size of the}} block increased by the same factor, the resulting curvatures appeared to be the same. However, van der Wey (1932) found that the curvature was proportional to the concentration of the <b>growth</b> <b>substance</b> in the agar and nearly independent of the size of the blocks. In general, we have confirmed the finding that the curvature is proportional to the concentration of <b>growth</b> <b>substance</b> and not to the amount of it present in the block. It will be shown, however, that if it be assumed, as seems justified, that the rate of entry of the substance into the plant is proportional to its concentration in the block at each moment, then the variation of curvature with size of block is a necessar 3 y consequence, and that hence an explanation of the divergent results of different investigators is found...|$|E

When compared the yield of β-glucosidases in cellobiose based medium with that in corn stover + wheat bran based medium, F. proliferatum grew in cellobiose faster than that in corn stover + wheat bran (data not shown). This proved that cellobiose is an excellent <b>growth</b> <b>substance</b> for and is rapidly consumed, whereas corn stover + wheat bran is a relatively poor <b>growth</b> <b>substance</b> and is slowly consumed.

Using the bioassay of kinetin (6 -furfurlyamino purine) as a standard in delaying chlorophyll degradation, wastewater extract was capable of maintaining chlorophyll in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) leaf tissue; however, toxic contaminants present in municipal wastewater may have prevented a consistent dose response. In the process of repeated chromatography, kinetin broke down into two zones that were capable of retarding chlorophyll degradation. After repeated chromatography, wastewater extract and degradation products of kinetin resulted in similar Rf values. Wastewater extract obtained through repeated chromatography resulted in increased total chlorophyll retention, with increased concentrations; however, the nature of the cytokinin-like <b>growth</b> <b>substances</b> present in wastewater appeared to be unique.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between endogenous auxin levels and growth in roots has been studied.

Different patterns of endogenous auxin content could be obtained by following different purification and assay methods. Vicia faba roots acid auxins show a decline in concentration with increasing age of the seedlings. A fall in the growth rate of older roots has been correlated with the gradual disappearance or inactivation of <b>growth</b> <b>substances.</b> An increase in the concentration of IAA and total acid auxins {{in the early stages of}} growth could be related to the development of lateral meristems. Different levels of auxin concentration are maintained in different parts of the root system, the highest being in the tap root tips. <b>Growth</b> <b>substances</b> in different parts of the roots (tap root tip, root stump and laterals) show complex changes in concentrations as the organs age. The possible bearing of such changes on root growth has been discussed. The evidence indicates that synthesis of acid auxins in the lateral tips is inhibited by the presence of the tap root tips. It was further demonstrated that geotropic stimulation triggers off certain enzymatic reactions which bring about an increased synthesis of an acid auxin (occurring in the IAA zone of chromatograms) in the root apices of broad beans. The maximum amount of the substance is produced in roots stimulated for 40 minutes - the concentration being lowered in a longer period of stimulation (60 minutes).

A number of hordein IgG-reacting bands were noted in the samples from dry kernels. In samples incubated {{in the absence of}} gibberellic acid, polypeptide fragments in the size range of 25 to 30 kilodaltons appeared within 24 hours, and those in the size range of 40 kilodaltons became more prominent. In samples incubated in the presence of gibberellic acid, polypeptide fragments in the size range of 45 to 67 kilodaltons were less apparent and those in the size range of less than 15 kilodaltons were more pronounced. The hordein-related polypeptide fragments were present in low amounts after 72 hours in the presence of gibberellic acid. Methanol-soluble peptides were fractionated, on the basis of size, into two broad peaks. In the absence of gibberellic acid, there was no significant change in their profile over a 72 hour incubation period.
