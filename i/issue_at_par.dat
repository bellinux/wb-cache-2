50|$|In {{simplified}} terms, the Crédit Mobilier fraud {{worked in}} the following manner: The Union Pacific made contracts with Crédit Mobilier to build the Union Pacific railway at rates significantly above cost. These construction contracts brought high profits to the Crédit Mobilier, which was owned by Durant and the Union Pacific's other directors and principal stockholders, and which divided the outsize profits with the Union Pacific stockholders. The directors of the Union Pacific were also able to circumvent rules requiring them to receive full payment for stock <b>issued</b> <b>at</b> <b>par,</b> by paying Crédit Mobilier for construction contracts in bank checks, which Crédit Mobilier then used to purchase Union Pacific stock <b>at</b> <b>par.</b>|$|R
50|$|Suppose a new 5 year FRN pays {{a coupon}} of 3 months LIBOR +0.20%, and is <b>issued</b> <b>at</b> <b>par</b> (100.00). If the {{perception}} of the credit-worthiness of the issuer goes down, investors will demand a higher interest rate, say LIBOR +0.25%. If a trade is agreed, the price is calculated. In this example, LIBOR +0.25% would be roughly equivalent to a price of 99.75. This can be calculated as par, minus the difference between the coupon and the price that was agreed (0.05%), multiplied by the maturity (5 year).|$|R
40|$|Convertible {{bonds are}} <b>issued</b> <b>at</b> <b>par</b> with a "premium put " {{allowing}} the investor to redeem the bonds for cash at {{a multiple of}} the bond's <b>par</b> value <b>at</b> a date or dates prior to maturity. If the investor does not exercise the premium put, the put expires. <b>At</b> the <b>issue</b> date, the carrying amount of the bonds is {{in excess of the}} market value of the common stock that would be issued under the conversion terms. The issues are: 1. Whether the issuer should accrue a liability so that, at the date the put is exercisable, the issuer has a recorded liability equal to the redemption price 2. Whether accrual should continue if subsequent changes {{in the value of the}} debt or common stock make exercise of the put unlikely 3. If the put expires unexercised, whether the liability should be recognized as income, credited to capital, maintained as part of the carrying amount of the debt, or amortized as a yield adjustment over the remaining term of the debt.

2500|$|These {{factors are}} likely to change over time, so the market price of a bond will vary after it is issued. The market price is {{expressed}} {{as a percentage of}} nominal value. Bonds are not necessarily <b>issued</b> <b>at</b> <b>par</b> (100% of face value, corresponding to a price of 100), but bond prices will move towards par as they approach maturity (if the market expects the maturity payment to be made in full and on time) as this is the price the issuer will pay to redeem the bond. This is referred to as [...] "Pull to Par". At other times, prices can be above par (bond is priced at greater than 100), which is called trading at a premium, or below par (bond is priced at less than 100), which is called trading at a discount. Most government bonds are denominated in units of $1000 in the United States, or in units of £100 in the United Kingdom. Hence, a deep discount US bond, selling at a price of 75.26, indicates a selling price of $752.60 per bond sold. (Often, in the US, bond prices are quoted in points and thirty-seconds of a point, rather than in decimal form.) [...] Some short-term bonds, such as the U.S. Treasury bill, are always <b>issued</b> <b>at</b> a discount, and pay <b>par</b> amount <b>at</b> maturity rather than paying coupons. This is called a discount bond.|$|R
