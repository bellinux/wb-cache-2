5|$|In 2009, MLS {{expanded}} into the Seattle market {{adding a new}} team to the league, Seattle Sounders FC. As an expansion team, they <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> through the qualification matches before entering the tournament. Likewise, D.C. United did not finish among the top six 2008 MLS teams, and therefore <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> through qualification rounds before entering the official tournament.|$|E
5|$|For the 2015–2016 season, the Rainmen {{reformed}} {{under new}} ownership as the Halifax Hurricanes. Levingston remained the team's general manager. Clinkscales {{returned to the}} Halifax team, but he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> with mostly new teammates and a new coach in Hugo López. Clinkscales eventually assumed the position of team captain during the season.|$|E
5|$|After José Antonio Camacho led Benfica {{to second}} place, the club {{offered him a}} new two-year {{contract}} as manager in June. As a condition to renewing the contract, Camacho requested that the club sign more established players, but budget restraints allowed for limited investment. After several unsuccessful player bids, Benfica added Luisão to the squad and re-signed Geovanni in August. Because their second-place finish only granted a berth in the third qualifying round of the UEFA Champions League, Benfica <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> Lazio for {{a spot in the}} group stage. They lost both legs and were relegated to the UEFA Cup.|$|E

I'd like to erase it, so I wouldn't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> it again. After a while you just want <b>to</b> <b>play</b> something different. There's something about the hook that just strikes a chord of fear down my spine." ...|$|R
5000|$|Crosby's version {{features}} some memorable guitar by Les Paul, who {{recalled in}} an interview printed in Mojo magazine: [...] "Bing was a sucker for guitar and that particular song {{was a case of}} you don't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> a lot of notes, you just <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> the right notes." ...|$|R
5|$|As a manager, Virdon led the Pirates to the 1972 NL East {{division}} title, but the Pirates {{lost the}} 1972 National League Championship Series (NLCS) to the Cincinnati Reds when Pittsburgh pitcher Bob Moose unleashed a wild {{pitch in the}} final inning of Game 5, allowing the winning run to score. The 1973 Pirates <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> without Clemente, who died during the previous offseason. Further struggles included pitcher Steve Blass' inability to throw strikes and injuries to Dock Ellis. In 1973, Virdon clashed with Ellis and Richie Hebner, and the Pirates fell into third place, with a 67–69 record, and the team fired Virdon, replacing him with Murtaugh.|$|E
5|$|Barton {{stayed on}} with Newcastle United {{after they were}} relegated to the Championship, playing six out of Newcastle's opening eight league matches, but {{suffered}} an injury to his foot in a 3–1 win against Plymouth Argyle on 19 September. He returned in April for Newcastle, playing all nine of Newcastle's remaining league fixtures and scoring his only goal of the campaign from a free kick in a win over Peterborough United. Due to the form of Danny Guthrie and Kevin Nolan, Barton <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> left wing when he returned.|$|E
5|$|Chaplin {{played for}} the University of Illinois Wheelchair Basketball team in the country's first division. In 2006/07, she was coached by Mike Frogley, and was the team's {{starting}} point guard. Early in the 2006/07 season, her wheelchair broke and she <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> in one that was not hers. After three games played in the borrowed chair, she had bloody and bruised knees. She was named an All-American in the 2006/07 season.|$|E

5|$|D.C. United {{entered the}} tournament as the competition's {{defending}} champions. They had previously won the tournament in 1996 as well. Both Sounders FC and D.C. United <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> through two qualification rounds for MLS teams {{before entering the}} official tournament. Prior to the final, there was a public dispute between {{the owners of the}} two clubs regarding the selection of D.C. United to host it at their home field, RFK Stadium.|$|E
5|$|During Danny Williams' time as premier the {{province}} experienced a major economic expansion, mainly {{as a result}} of the offshore oil industry. After years of sluggish growth and annual deficits {{the province}} started recording large surpluses, starting in 2006. While billions of dollars were paid down on the province's debt, government spending increased considerably. In his 2011 report Auditor General John Noseworthy noted that spending had increased by 47.4 percent over a five-year period. Finance Minister Tom Marshall defended the spending practises by saying that the province <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> catchup after decades of deficits, and that the global recession forced all governments to hike spending to keep economies afloat.|$|E
5|$|El Salvador {{advanced}} {{from the}} first round of 1971 CONCACAF Championship qualification with an aggregate score of 4–2 against Nicaragua after home and away legs. In the second round, El Salvador withdrew from the playoff when they <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> against Honduras, meaning Honduras qualified by default. The national team also took part in the 1973 CONCACAF Championship qualification, which doubled as qualification for the 1974 FIFA World Cup, but they did not advance to the final stage after they were eliminated by Guatemala with an aggregate score of 0–2 (0–1, 0–1). The team was managed by Hector D'Angelo.|$|E

5|$|Five {{weeks into}} the season, guard Howard Glenn broke his neck during a loss to the Houston Oilers, and died a few hours later, {{becoming}} the first player in professional football to die from injuries sustained on the field. New York suffered other injuries as the season progressed, and Wismer lacked the money to replace the injured players. Several players <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> both offense and defense. Wismer had arranged for the Titans to play three home games before their cross-river rivals, the Giants, started their season. This meant the Titans <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> their final three games on the road, and Wismer claimed to have lost $150,000 on the trip. The Titans finished their first season 7–7; according to attendance figures released by the team, the Titans drew an average of 16,375fans per game. This claim was mocked by the New York press, which reported that the fans had disguised themselves as empty seats. The New York Times estimated that the team had lost $450,000 for the season; in his autobiography, Wismer set the figure at $1.2million.|$|E
5|$|Kinuyo Tanaka, {{who played}} Miyagi, found the scene were {{she is a}} ghost {{to be the most}} stressful, as she <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> a ghost and appear to be an actual wife at the same time. After rehearsals and the shooting, Mizoguchi lit a {{cigarette}} for Mori, indicating his rare degree of satisfaction with the scene. Eitaro Ozawa, who played Tōbei, said the actors frequently rehearsed alone, or with the cinematographer, while Mizoguchi was willingly absent during these preparations.|$|E
5|$|Moodu Pani marked A. R. Rahman's first {{association}} with Ilaiyaraaja; the former (then known by his birth name Dilip) {{worked as a}} keyboardist in the film. During the re-recording of Moodu Pani soundtrack and score, Ilaiyaraaja fired his original keyboardist, due to the person's drinking behaviour. At that time, another one of his troupe members asked Ilaiyaraaja to meet a boy named Dilip, {{who knew how to}} play the keyboard. Ilaiyaraaja agreed and sent for Dilip, whom he instructed regarding the notes and tune he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>play.</b> Dilip, under Ilaiyaraaja's supervision, successfully completed the re-recording process.|$|E

5|$|Sounders FC {{automatically}} {{qualified for}} {{the third round of}} the U.S. Open Cup tournament by finishing among the top six in the 2010 Major League Soccer season. The Fire did not automatically qualify, and <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> through two qualification rounds before entering the official tournament. Prior to the final, Chicago and Seattle had met twice in 2011, with Seattle winning one game and the other ending in a draw.|$|E
5|$|The Dodgers {{traded for}} Jones {{in part to}} replace Glenn Dobbs – a star {{tailback}} in Brooklyn's single-wing offense – because Dobbs was suffering from injuries. Jones himself was hurt early in the 1947 season, however, when {{he was hit by}} Bill Willis of the Cleveland Browns. Injuries to his knee, hip and clavicle forced him to sit out for several weeks. He broke his hand when he returned and <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> exclusively on defense {{for the rest of the}} season.|$|E
5|$|The tournament {{was played}} from April 23 to April 29 and seven teams participated: Canada, Czechoslovakia, the United States, Switzerland, Sweden, France and Belgium. Canada chose {{to send the}} Allan Cup-winning Winnipeg Falcons. The Americans began a tournament to {{determine}} their representative team but abandoned it, deciding instead to send an all-star team that included four Canadian-born players. The Swedish team consisted of mostly bandy players, {{many of whom had}} only started playing hockey in preparation for the tournament. Canada won all three of the team's games in the first round and won the gold medal, defeating Sweden in the final and outscoring opponents 27–1. In the two subsequent rounds, the United States and Czechoslovakia won the silver and bronze medals respectively. The Bergvall System was criticized, especially in Sweden, because the Swedish team <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> six games (winning three) while the bronze medal winning Czech team only <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> three (winning one). Erik Bergvall, the creator of the system, stated that it was used incorrectly and that a tournament of all of the losing teams from the first round should have been played for the silver medal. Because of these criticisms, the Bergvall System was not used again for ice hockey.|$|E

5|$|After the Kansas kickoff, Virginia Tech {{took over}} at its 33-yard line. Needing a score, the Hokies {{committed}} a five-yard false start penalty before quarterback Sean Glennon was sacked by Kansas' Mike Rivera. The two plays pushed the Virginia Tech offense back, {{preventing them from}} gaining a first down. Forced to punt the ball away, Virginia Tech <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> defense as Kansas took over at its 28-yard line. Secure in their lead, Kansas elected to run the ball {{in an effort to}} keep the clock moving and bring the game to an end more quickly. Brandon McAnderson broke free for 28yards on the first play of the drive, and Jake Sharp contributed another first down on the ground before the Hokie defense stopped Kansas on an attempt to earn a first down on a fourth-and-two deep inside Virginia Tech territory.|$|E
5|$|For his audition, Williams played four jam {{sessions}} with the band, and on 27 May 1977 was officially asked to join AC/DC. Angus declared {{the decision was}} partially motivated by the bassist's good looks, which the band hoped would attract more women to their concerts. As Williams was replacing an Australian musician, there were issues resulting in problems obtaining a work permit to enter the country. His first performances with AC/DC were in Australia supporting the Let There Be Rock album, with two secret gigs at Sydney's Lifesaver. The album Powerage (1978), produced by Vanda & Young, marked Williams's studio debut. Williams remained in AC/DC from that time onwards until 2016, with only a temporary departure in 1991 as he suffered a kidney infection, during which Paul Greg <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> bass for some North American concerts in the Razors Edge World Tour. In addition to his role as bassist with AC/DC, Williams also contributed backing vocals. He has said that his favourite albums with the band are Powerage and Back in Black.|$|E
5|$|In July 1961, Sutcliffe {{decided to}} leave the group to {{continue}} painting. After being awarded a postgraduate scholarship he enrolled at Hochschule für bildende Künste Hamburg, where he studied under the tutelage of Eduardo Paolozzi. He briefly lent McCartney his bass until the latter could earn enough to buy a specially made smaller left-handed Höfner 500/1 bass guitar of his own in June 1961, but specifically asked McCartney (who is left-handed) not to change the strings around or restring the instrument, so McCartney <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> the bass as it was. In 1967, a photo of Sutcliffe was among those {{on the cover of the}} Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band album (extreme left, in front of fellow artist Aubrey Beardsley).|$|E
