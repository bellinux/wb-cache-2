In this paper, we perform a systematic study to investigate the commonly cited sources of packet loss induced by the wireless channel and by the MAC protocol. The channel <b>induced</b> <b>losses</b> that we study are external WiFi, non-WiFi and mulipath interference. The protocol <b>induced</b> <b>losses</b> that we study are protocol timeouts and the breakdown of CSMA over WiLD links. Our results are based on measurements performed on two real-world WiLD deployments and a wireless channel emulator. The two deployments allow us to compare measurements across rural and urban settings. The channel emulator allows us to study each source of packet loss in isolation in a controlled environment. Based on our experiments we observe that the presence of external WiFi interference leads to significant amount of packet loss in WiLD links. In addition to identifying the sources of packet loss, we analyze the loss variability across time. We also explore the solution space and propose a range of MAC and network layer adaptation algorithms to mitigate the channel and protocol <b>induced</b> <b>losses...</b>|$|E

40|$|Performance of {{existing}} TCP implementations over Optical Burst Switched (OBS) networks is not satisfactory, as they suffer from false congestion detection. As the contention <b>induced</b> <b>losses</b> {{are more common}} than congestion <b>induced</b> <b>losses</b> in OBS, the TCP reduces the congestion window even {{when there is no}} congestion. This effect, in turn unnecessarily reduces the TCP throughput. So it is crucial to differentiate the contention induced loss from congestion induced loss in such networks. It has been proposed in this paper, a mechanism that makes use of short-term RTT variation and assembly times ’ of individual TCP segments to differentiate between congestion and contention <b>induced</b> <b>losses.</b> This mechanism is a cross layer modification of a congestion control scheme called Statistical Additive Increase and Multiplicative Decrease (SAIMD). Our proposed scheme is found to be more efficient than existing one in terms of TCP throughput. The gain in throughput is primarily because of avoidance of misdirection of contention induced loss as congestion induced loss. A throughput-cost study has been conducted based on the throughput metric available from the efficiency analysis of our proposed scheme. The cost model used focuses on initial capital expenditure including switching, routing and amplification cost. An extension of ns 2 called nOBS, to support OBS protocol is used for simulation to study the performance...|$|E

40|$|Innovations in {{optical fiber}} {{technology}} are revolutionizing world communications. The {{focus of this}} paper is the development of optical fibers that within 20 years displaced copper wire as the transmission medium of choice for most commercial applications in telecommunications systems and computer networks worldwide. High speed and ultra-high capacity of optical communications have emerged as the essential techniques for backbone global information transmission networks. As the bit rate of the transmission system gets higher and higher about 40 Gb/s to 100 Gb/s to several terabits, the modeling of proposed modulation techniques is very important so as to avoid costly practical demonstration. This paper thus describes the various losses associated with fiber and its simulation models and its analysis in OptSim.

We observe strong interspecies collision-induced losses in the MOTs which dramatically reduce the maximum atom number achievable in the MOTs. We measure the trap loss rate coefficients β_Li,Rb and β_Rb,Li, and, from a study of their dependence on the MOT parameters, determine the cause for the losses observed. Our results provide valuable insights into ultracold collisions between 7 Li and 85 Rb, guide our efforts to suppress collision <b>induced</b> <b>losses,</b> and also pave the way for the production of ultracold 7 Li 85 Rb molecules.

40|$|Optical fibers with undoped silica {{core and}} {{fluorine}} doped silica cladding {{are known to}} be radiation resistant. Especially fibers with high OH-content core material show very low radiation <b>induced</b> <b>losses</b> with recover within a few hundred seconds after irradiations up to 100 krd dose. Even with these promising properties radiation resistance is a limiting factor for some applications. Optical fibers with different grades of high OH-content undoped silica core materials were produced by using the same preform manufacturing and fiber drawing parameters. The UV-attenuation spectra of those fiber samples were measured. Then they were irradiated at a 60 Co-source, and the <b>induced</b> <b>losses</b> were recorded in the spectral range between 200 nm and 1600 nm wavelength. A correlation between the UV-attenuation characteristics of the unirradiated fiber and its radiation induced loss was found. The results indicate that defects already existing in the unirradiated fiber ("precursor defects") are responsi ble for the difference in radiation at dose values below 100 krd. These precursor defects are transformed into color centers by ionizing radiation...|$|E

For this, we characterized their spectral and time dependence of the steady state 10 keV X-ray radiation-induced attenuation in the ultraviolet and visible range of wavelengths (200 nm- 900 nm). Their radiation sensitivity is very high with losses exceeding 10 dB m− 1 for doses larger than 10 Gy and wavelengths shorter than 550 nm. Our results reveal a sub linear dose dependence of the <b>induced</b> <b>losses</b> that also depends on the dose rate (1 Gy s− 1 - 50 Gy s− 1) between 350 nm and 900 nm.
