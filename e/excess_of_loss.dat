And this opinion led your Committee to a detailed review of all the articles of the Indian traffic upon which the profit and loss was steady; and we have chosen a period of four years, during the continuance of the revenue investment, and prior to any borrowing or any extraordinary drawing of bills, {{in order to find}} out how far the trade, under circumstances when {{it will be necessary to}} carry it on by borrowing, or by bills, or by exportation of bullion, can be sustained in the former course, so as to secure the capital and to afford a reasonable dividend. And your Committee find that in the first four years the investment from Bengal amounted to 4,176,525l.; upon 2,260,277l. there was a gain of 186,337l., and upon 1,916,248l. a loss of 705,566l.: so that the <b>excess</b> <b>of</b> <b>loss</b> above gain, upon the whole of the foregoing capital, was in the four years no less than 519,229l.|$|E
60|$|Reverse the process, in {{consequence}} of the <b>excess</b> <b>of</b> <b>loss</b> by evaporation over gain by inflow, which must have set in as the climate of Syria changed {{after the end of}} the pleistocene epoch, and (without taking into consideration any other circumstances) the present state of things must eventually be reached--a concentrated saline solution in the deepest part of the valley--water, rather more charged with saline matter than ordinary fresh water, in the lower Jordan and the lake of Galilee--fresh waters, still largely derived from the snows of Hermon, in the upper Jordan and in Lake Huleh. But, if the full state of Jordan valley marks the glacial epoch, then it follows that the excavation of that valley by atmospheric agencies must have occupied an immense antecedent time--a large part, perhaps the whole, of the pliocene epoch; and we are thus forced to the conclusion that, since the miocene epoch, the physical conformation of the Holy Land has been substantially what it is now. It has been more or less rained upon, searched by {615} earthquakes here and there, partially overflowed by lava streams, slowly raised (relatively to the sea-level) a few hundred feet.

Reinsurance can also be purchased on a per policy basis, in which case it is known as facultative reinsurance. Facultative reinsurance can be written on either a quota share or <b>excess</b> <b>of</b> <b>loss</b> basis. Facultative reinsurance contracts are commonly memorialized in relatively brief contracts known as facultative certificates and often are used for large or unusual risks that do not fit within standard reinsurance treaties due to their exclusions.

40|$|This thesis {{sets out}} to develop the {{framework}} for an underwriting system for <b>excess</b> <b>of</b> <b>loss</b> reinsurance. A system is constructed and tested which builds on the strengths but avoids the most important practical limitations of existing judgemental or scientific methods. Key issues in the proposed method are the identification of underwriting decision criteria {{in the face of}} uncertainty and the important influence of the market in the decision process. The research involves the following stages. Firstly,. a conceptual framework is provided for tackling the problem effectively in a flexible but comprehensive manner. Secondly, a rigorous empirical examination of underwriting activities over a four year period is undertaken on data collected from an <b>excess</b> <b>of</b> <b>loss</b> underwriting agency operating in the London Market. Thirdly, from relationships established in the empirical investigation, an underwriting system is devised, subjected to sensitivity analysis, and tested in comparison with the performance of a professional <b>excess</b> <b>of</b> <b>loss</b> underwriter. From the research, the contribution to knowledge is as follows: 1) The first detailed study of <b>excess</b> <b>of</b> <b>loss</b> underwriters' actual decision­ making behaviour is provided; Z) Practical application of risk-theoretic techniques is demonstrated as being negligible among <b>excess</b> <b>of</b> <b>loss</b> un<;lerwriters; 3) Evidence is provided for the existence of a satisficing model for <b>excess</b> <b>of</b> <b>loss</b> underwriting decisions; · 4) An <b>excess</b> <b>of</b> <b>loss.</b> underwriting system based on market heuristics is constructed, tested and evaluated; 5) Wider implications of the fact that real units of trade may differ from how they are perceived by market operators are presented. and discussed.

They include a directional (X) coupler, a cross-gap coupler (CGC), and a multimode interference (MMI) coupler. The {{length of the}} X coupler 2 ̆ 7 s parallel film waveguide is 1 μm. The theoretical minimum <b>excess</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> the X coupler is 0. 73 dB, whereas its experimental value is 1. 0817 dB. CGC has a coupling region length of 24 μm. The minimum <b>excess</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> CGC, which is 0. 6 dB in theory, is experimentally determined to be 0. 6737 dB.

The splitters {{consist of a}} Y-branch, two 90 degrees submicrometer-radius bends (SRBs), and two straight-MISIM waveguides connecting the Y-branch and the two SRBs. The Y-branch is an overlap of two oppositely directed SRBs. All the SRBs of the splitter have the same radius of curvature. The splitter has a feature that {{the length of the}} in-between MISIM waveguides is adjusted to make its input waveguide split over a short distance into its widely separated output waveguides. Simulation of the splitters indicates that the radius of curvature of the SRB needs to be >= 0. 8 mu m to make small the <b>excess</b> <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> the splitters. When the radius of curvature is 0. 8 mu m, the splitter which can connect its input waveguide just over 1. 6 mu m to its output waveguides spaced 6. 4 mu m apart has an <b>excess</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> 1. 4 dB.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} London Market <b>Excess</b> <b>of</b> <b>Loss</b> Spiral (“LMX Spiral”), a {{phenomenon}} based upon <b>excess</b> <b>of</b> <b>loss</b> reinsurance contracts that developed within the London reinsurance market of the 1980 s. The unwinding of the LMX Spiral {{was a key}} factor in the crisis the Lloyd’s insurance market had to face in the early 1990 s. However, whilst the crisis resulted in a wave of litigation in the English courts, there is no legal appraisal of the additional element of risk brought by the LMX Spiral itself. The case law instead focuses on the duties of the underwriters and various agents that fuelled its development. This situation is unsatisfactory for two reasons. Firstly, reinsurance spirals are a potential side-effect of XL reinsurance markets and therefore other spirals may develop in the future. Secondly, this thesis shows that once a reinsurance spiral reaches a certain point, it becomes unsustainable, generating instability within the relevant reinsurance market. This thesis provides a detailed legal appraisal of reinsurance spirals and a new analysis of <b>excess</b> <b>of</b> <b>loss</b> reinsurance contracts. The first part sets out the relevant legal principles and describes the LMX Spiral and its impact; listing, for the first time, the “Spiral Effects” identified through reports and actuarial models.
