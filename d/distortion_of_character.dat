60|$|Without {{entering}} here into a dissertation {{upon the}} historical romance, {{it may be}} said that in proper hands it has been and {{should continue to be}} one of the most valued and valuable expressions of the literary art. To render and maintain it so, however, it is necessary that certain well-defined limits should be set upon the licence which its writers are to enjoy; it is necessary that the work should be honest work; that preparation for it should be made by a sound, painstaking study of the period to be represented, to the end that a true impression may first be formed and then conveyed. Thus, considering how much more far-reaching is the novel than any other form of literature, the good results that must wait upon such endeavours are beyond question. The neglect of them--the <b>distortion</b> <b>of</b> <b>character</b> to suit the romancer's ends, the like distortion of historical facts, the gross anachronisms arising out of a lack of study, have done much to bring the historical romance into disrepute. Many writers frankly make no pretence--leastways none that can be discerned--of aiming at historical precision; others, however, invest their work with a spurious scholarliness, go the length of citing authorities to support the point of view which they have taken, and which they lay before you as the fruit of strenuous lucubrations.|$|E

40|$|A {{common problem}} {{encountered}} in signboard recognition is the perspective <b>distortion</b> <b>of</b> <b>characters.</b> In this paper, we propose a method which {{is able to}} directly recognize characters under severe perspective distortion without perspective rectification. In this method, a character is represented by a sequence of cross ratio spectra, in which the perspective effect can be modeled as an one-dimensional uneven stretching. Dynamic Time Warping algorithm is employed to estimate the pairwise similarity between spectra of the query and spectra of a fronto-parallel template. Then, it is again used {{to find out the}} pixel-level correspondence and the similarity between the query and the template. The experiment results showed that the proposed method worked well on synthetic character images and signboards in real scene under severe perspective projections. ...|$|R

The goals of this work are to understand better the role of shape, shape representations, and shape similarity in character recognition, and to develop character recognition methods that are more robust to degradations and <b>distortions</b> <b>of</b> <b>character</b> patterns than existing methods. In the system, methods previously used in visual object recognition are {{used to determine the}} similarity between input character patterns and stored character prototypes. The shape <b>of</b> <b>character</b> patterns is represented by their boundary, sometimes annotated with information about local orientation and curvature. The effects of different representations of shapes and different similarity measures are evaluated and compared in tests with character patterns from the NIST Special Database 3.

Due to the <b>distortion</b> <b>of</b> reality, <b>characters</b> from dozens <b>of</b> 2000 AD strips made cameo appearances, either in the background or as parts of the plot (Dredd is attacked by the vampires from Fiends of the Eastern Front and then has to avoid Old One-Eye from Flesh).|$|R
40|$|The {{major problem}} with {{retrieval}} of OCR text is the unpredictable <b>distortion</b> <b>of</b> <b>characters</b> due to recognition errors. Because users have no ideas <b>of</b> such <b>distortion,</b> the terms they query can hardly match the terms {{stored in the}} OCR text exactly. Thus retrieval effectiveness is significantly reduced, especially for low-quality input. To reduce the losses from retrieving such noisy OCR text, a fault-tolerant retrieval strategy based on automatic keyword extraction and fuzzy matching is proposed. In this strategy, terms, correct or not, and their term frequencies are extracted from the noisy text and presented for browsing and selection in response to users' initial queries, With theunderstanding of the real terms stored in the noisy text and of their estimated frequency distributions, users may then choose appropriate terms for a more effective searching, A text retrieval system based on this strategy has been built. Examples to show the effectiveness are demonstrated. Finally, some OCR issues for further enhancingretrieval effectiveness are discussed...|$|R

40|$|With the {{widespread}} use of digital cameras and camera phones, character recognition in scene images has become an important topic in the field <b>of</b> <b>character</b> recognition. Low resolution, uneven lighting condition and geometrical distortion make it difficult to recognize characters in real scene images accurately [1]. In order to achieve a highly accurate recognition <b>of</b> <b>characters</b> in scene images, there are some attempts on offering supplementary information for recognition [2] with a character image. The information should be human-friendly and robust against geometrical distortions. Uchida et al. proposed a method for embedding category information into character images using stripes [3]. They also proposed an algorithm for extracting the information stably with a finite state automaton [4]. Omachi et al. proposed a method for embedding information as a ratio of areas [5]. Since the ratio of areas is affine-invariant, even if a character image is geometrically distorted, theoretically the embedded information will be extracted correctly as long as the distortion can be regarded as an affine transformation. However, in general, geometrical <b>distortions</b> <b>of</b> <b>character</b> images taken by cameras are not affine transformations but projective transformations. In this paper, we propose a method for embedding supplementary information into a character pattern as a cross ratio of areas by designing a character pattern in two colors. It is known that a cross ratio defined by four points on a line is projective-invariant [6], and a cross ratio of areas is also projective-invariant. A character image with a shadow is show...|$|R

40|$|Building on {{previous}} work in Chinese character recognition, we describe an advanced system of classification using probabilistic neural networks.

Based on these measures, the space of feature vectors is transformed to the optimal discriminant space for a nearest neighbor classifier.

For classification, we present some modifications to the standard approach implied by the probabilistic neural network structure which yield significant speed improvements. We then compare this approach to using discriminant analysis and Geva and Sitte's Decision Surface Mapping classifiers. All methods are tested using 39, 644 characters in three different fonts. 1 Introduction 1. 1 Factors in Optical Chinese Character Recognition Optical c [...] ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{report is}} {{submitted}} in partial {{fulfillment of the}} requirements for the degree of Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Engineering, 2007. Cataloged from PDF version of thesis report. Includes bibliographical references (page 25). The Character Recognition Problem can be assumed as a classification task in which a (portion of an) image is {{to be given a}} label among a set of possible labels that represent the characters under consideration. This is the fundamental aspect of feature extraction technique. This generic formulation may lead to quite different settings. Also, if the images <b>of</b> the <b>characters</b> can be obtained optically, we speak <b>of</b> “Optical <b>Character</b> Recognition” (OCR), as opposed to other settings in which input data is obtained by other means. OCR itself can be considered as a subtask of the more general problem of “Document Analysis or Understanding”, where the goal is to obtain a symbolic representation of a digital image of the document under consideration that include not only the recognized text (characters), but also other document components and their relationship. In this thesis I will discuss various feature extraction techniques and later I will see how zoning can be used to build an efficient Bengali character recognition system. Different feature extraction techniques are used to recognize different representations <b>of</b> <b>characters</b> for example binary characters, character contours, skeletons (thinned characters) or gray level sub images <b>of</b> each individual <b>character.</b> The feature extraction methods are distinguished in terms of invariance properties, re-constructability and expected <b>distortions</b> and variability <b>of</b> <b>characters.</b> When a feature extraction method is chosen we need to consider it in terms of efficient application of the system and time consideration for building such system.
