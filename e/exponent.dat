40|$|The paper {{concerns}} {{the rates of}} power-law growth of mutual information computed for a stationary measure or for a universal code. The rates are called Hilberg <b>exponents</b> and four such quantities are defined for each measure and each code: two random <b>exponents</b> and two expected <b>exponents.</b> A particularly interesting case arises for conditional algorithmic mutual information. In this case, the random Hilberg <b>exponents</b> are almost surely constant on ergodic sources and are bounded by the expected Hilberg <b>exponents.</b> This property is a "second-order" analogue of the Shannon-McMillan-Breiman theorem, proved without invoking the ergodic theorem. It carries over to Hilberg <b>exponents</b> for the underlying probability measure via Shannon-Fano coding and Barron inequality. Moreover, the expected Hilberg <b>exponents</b> can be linked for different universal codes. Namely, if one code dominates another, the expected Hilberg <b>exponents</b> are greater for the former than for the latter. The paper is concluded by an evaluation of Hilberg <b>exponents</b> for certain sources such as the mixture Bernoulli process and the Santa Fe processes. Comment: 22 page...|$|R

5|$|Larger bodied {{specimens}} of Dimetrodon have larger sails {{relative to their}} size, an example of positive allometry. Positive allometry may benefit thermoregulation because it means that, as individuals get larger, surface area increases faster than mass. Larger-bodied animals generate {{a great deal of}} heat through metabolism, and the amount of heat that must be dissipated from the body surface is significantly greater than what must be dissipated by smaller-bodied animals. Effective heat dissipation can be predicted across many different animals with a single relationship between mass and surface area. However, a 2010 study of allometry in Dimetrodon found a different relationship between its sail and body mass: the actual scaling <b>exponent</b> of the sail was much larger than the <b>exponent</b> expected in an animal adapted to heat dissipation. The researchers concluded that the sail of Dimetrodon grew at a much faster rate than was necessary for thermoregulation, and suggested that sexual selection was the primary reason for its evolution.|$|E
