25|$|Cross a brook, and {{you lose}} the King of England; but you have some comfort in coming again under his Majesty, though 'shorn of his beams,' {{and no more than}} Prince of Wales. Go to the north, and you find him dwindled to a Duke of Lancaster; turn to the west of that north, and he pops upon you in the humble {{character}} of Earl of Chester. Travel a few miles on, the Earl of Chester disappears, and the King surprises you again as Count Palatine of Lancaster. If you travel beyond Mount Edgecombe, you find him once more in his incognito, and he is Duke of Cornwall... <b>every</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> Principalities has the apparatus of a Kingdom for the jurisdiction over a few private estates, and the formality and charge of the Exchequer of Great Britain for collecting the rents of a country squire. Cornwall is the best of them.|$|E

Lader explained how the animations were created, they first shot the video with a white background, he then edited it on the Final Cut Pro. It was followed by printing over 3,000 frames onto paper. The team, which consisted of 8 people, {{was in charge of}} torn by hand <b>every</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> frames, which were animated and photographed individually with a digital camera.

Some were old ballads and traditional songs ... but others Bob would make up as he went along. ... We'd play the melody, he'd sing a few words he'd written, and then make up some more, or else just mouth sounds or even syllables as he went along. It's a pretty good way to write songs." [...] Danko told Dylan biographer Howard Sounes, [...] "Bob and Robbie, they would come by every day, five to seven days a week, for seven to eight months." [...] Hudson added, [...] "It amazed me, Bob's writing ability. How he would come in, {{sit down at the}} typewriter, and write a song.

500|$|Another myth {{concerns}} Saul Bass, {{the graphic}} designer who created {{many of the}} title sequences of Hitchcock's films and storyboarded some of Psychos scenes, claiming he had directed the shower scene. This was refuted by several figures associated with the film, including Leigh, who stated: [...] "absolutely not! I have emphatically said this in any interview I've ever given. I've said it to his face in front of other people... I was in that shower for seven days, and, believe me, Alfred Hitchcock was right next to his camera for <b>every</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> seventy-odd shots." [...] Hilton A. Green, the assistant director, also refutes Bass' claim: [...] "There is not a shot in that movie that I didn't roll the camera for. And I can tell you I never rolled the camera for Mr. Bass." [...] Roger Ebert, a longtime admirer of Hitchcock's work, summarily dismissed the rumor, stating, [...] "It seems unlikely that a perfectionist with an ego like Hitchcock's would let someone else direct such a scene." ...|$|E
500|$|The Flaming Lips' song [...] "SpongeBob and Patrick Confront the Psychic Wall of Energy," [...] {{recorded}} for The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie, closes with several lines focusing on Plankton and Karen. The song characterizes Plankton as a confused faultfinder {{who would be}} much happier if he stopped focusing on his failures and complaining to Karen. Plankton sings a track on the novelty album The Best Day Ever titled [...] "You Will Obey," [...] on which Elvis Presley's former guitarist James Burton played guitar. Of the album, Tom Kenny said [...] "one of our hidden Easter eggs that hopefully more than three {{people in the world}} will get is during the guitar solo when Plankton says 'Take it, James', which was what Elvis said in <b>every</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> concert movies".

500|$|According to Jon Pareles of The New York Times, [...] "after all {{the nuances}} Madonna {{has brought to}} the role of the bad girl, it's strange that she would settle now for such a restricted, unexamined version of respectability" [...] and [...] "for the first time, Madonna has let the deal dictate the music". Tan Gim Ean from New Straits Times noted that Madonna played against her {{strengths}} on the songs of the album. He described her vocals as [...] "competent", but felt that the songs required [...] "more range and agility than Madonna has at her disposal." [...] Dave Tianen from Milwaukee Journal Sentinel described the album as a [...] "mixed bag of period pieces, some of them too cute for their own good", adding that [...] "I'm Breathless never becomes more than the sum of its mannerisms". AllMusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine claimed that the songs are just [...] "cutesy novelty numbers", and listing [...] "Vogue" [...] as a standout track. Rooksby panned the album, saying that it [...] "failed to transcend the sterile, preserved-in-amber quality of pastiche". Mark Cooper from Q magazine lamented, in its June 1990 review, [...] "It's something of a disappointment because the lady herself stays so firmly committed to a character who's less original than the persona she evolved during the '80s." [...] Nonetheless, in the same magazine's December 1994 issue, Madonna declared: [...] "I would have to say the favorite record that I've made is the soundtrack to Dick Tracy. I love <b>every</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> songs... My judgment is never based on the world's reaction." ...|$|E

2500|$|Carpenter's {{reluctance}} about Connie Mack Stadium soon proved justified. [...] He {{found it}} impossible {{to find a way to}} make the park profitable. His first thought was to extend the length of his income season by adding a football team. [...] In 1959, he sought to buy an American Football League franchise, but the negotiations failed. Additionally, the neighborhood rapidly went to seed; the phrase [...] "Watch your car, mister?" [...] became a catch phrase to game attendees. Indeed, the parking problem became the very crux of the issue in the 1950s and 1960s: whereas most people had formerly come to the park on public transportation, after the war, the automobile became the standard mode of transport. There was a 500-car lot, later expanded to 850 cars, across 21st Street, but it was not nearly enough. Carpenter tried to buy the whole block in 1959 for a multi-level garage, but the deal fell through. The team maintained special [...] "Phillies Express" [...] buses to shuttle fans from transportation hubs in Camden and the 69th Street Terminal in Upper Darby, but the service never really caught on. Carpenter also investigated land tracts first in West Philadelphia, then in the Torresdale section of the city, as well as nearby suburban Cheltenham and farther-flung Camden, across the river in New Jersey. But there were prohibitive problems with <b>every</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> proposed sites.|$|E
2500|$|Following the {{approach}} of Wellhausen, another set of calculations shows {{it is probable that}} Hezekiah did not ascend the throne before 722 BC. By Albright's calculations, Jehu's initial year is 842 BC; and between it and Samaria's destruction the Books of Kings give the total number of the years the kings of Israel ruled as 143 7/12, while for the kings of Judah the number is 165. This discrepancy, amounting in the case of Judah to 45 years (165–120), has been accounted for in various ways; but <b>every</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> theories must allow that Hezekiah's first six years fell before 722 BC. (That Hezekiah began to reign before 722 BC, however, is entirely consistent with the principle that the Ahaz/Hezekiah coregency began in 729 BC.) Nor is it clearly known how old Hezekiah was when called to the throne, although [...] states he was twenty-five years of age. His father {{died at the age of}} thirty-six (...) it is not likely that Ahaz at the age of eleven should have had a son. Hezekiah's own son Manasseh ascended the throne twenty-nine years later, at the age of twelve. This places his birth in the seventeenth year of his father's reign, or gives Hezekiah's age as forty-two, if he was twenty-five at his ascension. It is more probable that Ahaz was twenty-one or twenty-five when Hezekiah was born (and suggesting an error in the text), and that the latter was thirty-two at the birth of his son and successor, Manasseh.|$|E
