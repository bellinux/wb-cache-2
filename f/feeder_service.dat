5|$|Previously, Hong Kong's Mass Transit Railway (MTR) {{adopted a}} system to {{recirculate}} magnetic plastic cards as fare tickets when it started operations in 1979. Another of the territory's railway networks, the Kowloon-Canton Railway (KCR), adopted the same magnetic cards in 1984, and the stored value version was renamed Common Stored Value Ticket. In 1989, the Common Stored Value Ticket system was extended to Kowloon Motor Bus (KMB) buses providing a <b>feeder</b> <b>service</b> to MTR and KCR stations and to Citybus, and was also extended to {{a limited number of}} non-transport applications, such as payments at photobooths and for fast food vouchers.|$|E
5|$|There is {{a railway}} {{station on the}} Gjøvik Line also called Nydalen, that is served by NSB Gjøvikbanen {{as part of the}} Oslo Commuter Rail. It is located many hundred meters from the metro station, and the two do not offer inter{{connection}}s. There is a shorter connection to the Gjøvik Line at Storo (that connects with Grefsen Station). Nydalen also serves several bus routes. Line 37 via the city center to Helsfyr operates from across the street at Nydalen, while additional buses are located somewhat further away. They consist a <b>feeder</b> <b>service</b> to Lillo Terrasse (line 55) as well as lines 30 to Bygdøy, 51 to Maridalen and 58 to Helsfyr.|$|E

5000|$|In 1988 the NMA granted six Nigerian {{shipping}} lines [...] "national carrier" [...] status, {{including the}} state-owned Nigerian National Shipping Line. The NMA {{had plans to}} extend this status to more domestic companies so as to reduce control of trade by foreign-owned lines.For reasons of national pride, the NMA did not encourage domestic shipping lines to engage in <b>feeder</b> <b>services,</b> bringing goods to a distribution point for direct onward shipping, preferring direct-line services. An NMA official said in 1989 [...] "the development of <b>feeder</b> <b>services</b> is not at the moment consonant with the region's maratime development". According to UNCTAD, the lines would have been best suited to <b>feeder</b> <b>services,</b> and ignoring this approach {{may have led to}} their demise.|$|R

25|$|After the Board {{purchased}} the assets and business {{of most of}} its private competitors following legislative changes in the mid-1920s, it acquired a motley collection of buses with which {{it was able to}} start services on new routes. Despite the high maintenance and inventory costs associated with these vehicles, they were used to establish permanent routes to Bryndwr (originally planned to be a tramline), Springfield Road, Pleasant Point (<b>feeder</b> <b>service),</b> Shirley, and Avonside.|$|E
25|$|The airline {{started with}} two new {{commercial}} services from 2 April 2001, to better utilize their aircraft. The first was an onward connection from Vardø to Alta Airport, {{the second was}} an thrice-weekly international service from Kirkenes to Murmansk Airport. The route connected with flights at Kirkenes onwards to Tromsø, Alta and Oslo. From July Finnair started a thrice-weekly service from Helsinki via Rovaniemi to Lakselv. Arctic Air joined forces through establishing a <b>feeder</b> <b>service</b> to Lakselv Airport, Banak from Vardø, corresponding with the Finnair flights.|$|E

The remaining 30 percent in Korongo Airlines are owned by local Congolese investors. George Arthur Forrest, Belgian entrepreneur and owner of Forrest Groups, serves as the airline's chairman.|$|E
25|$|Hoved {{opened on}} 1 July 1971 as a {{municipal}} airport having cost 5.9 million Norwegian krone (NOK). Until 1993 Widerøe served it using the de Havilland Canada Twin Otter as a <b>feeder</b> <b>service</b> to Ålesund Airport, Vigra. The de Havilland Canada Dash 7 was used from 1985 to 1987. During {{the early years}} the airport had very poor regularity and was proposed closed. Terminal upgrades were carried out in 1988 and the runway extended in the early 2000s. Since the 2008 opening of the Eiksund Tunnel and the 2012 opening of the Kviv Tunnel, Hovden has significantly increased its catchment area and now covers a population of 60,000 in southern Sunnmøre and Nordfjord. This had led to a tripling of ridership.|$|E
25|$|DNL {{assumed the}} Finnmark route in 1947, but dropped Honningsvåg from the schedule. The {{municipal}} council approved plans in 1948 to reestablish the water aerodrome, {{which had been}} destroyed in the German retreat in 1944. Despite several local initiatives from Nordkapp during the 1950s and 1960s, Honningsvåg {{was not included in}} the seaplane routes. Following the opening av Alta Airport and Lakselv Airport, Banak in 1963, Norving applied to operate a <b>feeder</b> <b>service</b> from Honningsvåg to Alta and Hammerfest, but the ministry was not willing to issue subsidies for such a route. At the time travel time from Honningsvåg to Oslo via Lakselv was ten hours. Various public committees look into better aviation services in Finnmark during the 1960s. One such alternative was to build a heliport. Instead the government opted for constructing short take-off and landing airfields. The first of these were constructed in Helgeland in 1968.|$|E

25|$|In 1999 {{the airline}} chose {{to bid for}} public service {{obligation}} contracts with the Ministry of Transport and Communications, bidding for the routes from Tromsø to Sørkjosen, from Tromsø to Hasvik and Hammerfest, {{as well as from}} Kirkenes to Vardø. The latter route was won in September, after Arctic Air had bid 37 million kroner for the route. The incumbent, Widerøe, had bid 102 million. The contract, effective 1 April 2000 through 31 March 2003, was awarded in September. At the time the airline lacked suitable aircraft to operate the routes. Arctic Air was met with local opposition. While flown by Widerøe, Vardø Airport, Svartnes had been connected to a network westwards as well as to Kirkenes Airport, Høybuktmoen. With Arctic Air operating, only a <b>feeder</b> <b>service</b> would be provided. By December the population was generally satisfied with the thrice-daily service, and patronage had increased by fifteen percent since they had taken over.|$|E

The new airport would make driving to the Oslo Airport about an hour longer from Grenland, and both airlines hoped to create a <b>feeder</b> <b>service.</b> Teddy Air withdrew from the route after one month, after having lost more than NOK1 million.|$|E
