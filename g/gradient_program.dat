Multi-linear <b>gradient</b> <b>programs</b> {{on the other hand}} are only scarcely used, despite their intrinsically larger separation power. Because the gradient-conformity of the latest generation of instruments has greatly improved, a renewed interest in more complex multi-segment gradient liquid chromatography can be expected in the future, raising the need for better performing gradient design algorithms. We explored the possibilities of a new type of multi-segment gradient optimization algorithm, the so-called "one-segment-per-group-of-components" optimization strategy. In this gradient design strategy, the slope is adjusted after the elution of each individual component of the sample, letting the retention properties of the different analytes auto-guide the course of the gradient profile. Applying this method experimentally to four randomly selected test samples, the separation time could on average be reduced with about 40 % compared to the best single linear gradient. Moreover, the newly proposed approach performed equally well or better than the multi-segment optimization mode of a commercial software package. Carrying out an extensive in silico study, the experimentally observed advantage could also be generalized over a statistically significant amount of different 10 and 20 component samples. In addition, the newly proposed gradient optimization approach enables much faster searches than the traditional multi-step gradient design methods. © 2014 Elsevier B. V. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|The {{background}} for this thesis was to test {{some of the}} new column materials and columns in order to find suitable column for quality control of Omnipaque and Visipaque x-ray agent products. Focus was on the columns packed with small particles, columns specially suited for analysis of polar compounds and columns composed of in-place-synthesized monolithic materials. After preliminary testing, two columns, the Aqua and Chromolith Performance columns, were chosen for further development and validation of new methods. Both isocratic and gradient elution were to be explored to find the optimum conditions, as well as influence of the temperatures variations on the separation and analysis time. Experimental work showed that with so-called stepwise gradient elution programs could requirements for quality control of mentioned X-ray products be satisfied.

A two-step <b>gradient</b> <b>program,</b> from 3 % to 7 % acetonitrile in water in time range of 10 minutes, was used to analyse Omnipaque injection solutions using the Aqua or Chromolith Performance column.

40|$|In this thesis, the {{question}} of optimal control system design when constrained to using a stable controller is addressed. The performance index that is minimized is H∞-norm of {{the sensitivity of the}} closed-loop system to external disturbances. It is shown that the resulting feedback associated with the minimum value of the optimality criterion is irrational. A design algorithm is developed to find an approximation whose deviation from a sub-optimal controller lies within a pre-specified error bound, thus guaranteeing internal stability. For multivariable systems, a characterization is provided of all sensitivity functions that result from a stable controller; and two important special cases are solved for optimality. Next, the problem of finding the H 2 -optimal stable feedback controller for a general optimality criterion is considered. It is shown that this optimization reduces to finding the "best" function in RH 2 (i. e. of minimum norm) that satisfies an avoidance constraint. A design procedure is proposed for obtaining an optimal stable controller that minimizes the performance index and maintains internal stability. Given an initial point, this is achieved by minimizing a nonlinear objective function subject to nonlinear inequality constraints via a sequential <b>gradient</b> <b>programming</b> method...|$|R
