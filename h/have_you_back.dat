2500|$|Doctor Who {{returned}} to British screens in 2005, with Christopher Eccleston {{playing the role}} of the Ninth Doctor in the first series. Tennant replaced him as of the second series, making his first, brief appearance as the Tenth Doctor in the episode [...] "The Parting of the Ways" [...] (2005) {{at the end of the}} regeneration scene, and also appeared in a special [...] shown as part of the 2005 Children in Need appeal, broadcast on 18 November 2005. He began filming the new series of Doctor Who in late July 2005. His first full-length outing as the Doctor was a 60-minute special, [...] "The Christmas Invasion", first broadcast on Christmas Day 2005. Tennant had been formally offered the role of the Doctor during rehearsals for The Quatermass Experiment. Although the casting was not officially announced until later in April, both castmates and crew became aware of the speculation surrounding Tennant; in the live broadcast Jason Flemyng (Quatermass) changed his first line to Tennant's Dr Briscoe from [...] "Good to <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>back,</b> Gordon" [...] to [...] "Good to <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>back,</b> Doctor" [...] as a deliberate reference.|$|E
2500|$|Lane {{became a}} Lord of Appeal in Ordinary in October 1979, {{receiving}} as a Law lord additionally a life peerage as Baron Lane, of St Ippollitts in the County of Hertfordshire. He {{had been appointed}} by the new Lord Chancellor, Lord Hailsham, soon after Margaret Thatcher won the 1979 general election. His appointment was welcomed in the legal profession, where Lane {{was regarded as a}} genial figure ("Geoffrey Dawson, Baron Lane. [...] Good to <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>back</b> again."), but eventually not welcomed by Lane himself, who disliked the work. [...] The overdue retirement of Lord Widgery, whose physical ill-health and increasing dementia had become a suppressed scandal, led to Hailsham picking Lane to follow him as Lord Chief Justice from 1980.|$|E

6000|$|... "Poor woman--poor woman! When she <b>has</b> <b>you</b> <b>back</b> she'll forgit it all, though. There's {{eight of}} us on the [...] "We're Here", an' ef we went back naow--it's more'n a {{thousand}} mile--we'd lose the season. The men they wouldn't hev it, allowin' I was agreeable." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "No, my dear; no {{objection}} at all: of course not. I shall {{be delighted to}} <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>back,</b> and so, I'm sure, will Rachel; but--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I can't do {{with more}} than one girl,--and there's the keep if there isn't wages. Besides, there's other reasons. Your {{grandfather}} won't <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>back</b> there; that's certain.' ...|$|E
6000|$|So {{permission}} {{was asked}} for Stephen {{to show the}} way to Master Randall's, and granted somewhat reluctantly, Master Headley saying, [...] "I'll <b>have</b> <b>thee</b> <b>back</b> within an hour, Stephen Birkenholt, and look thou dost not let thy brain be set afire with this fellow's windy talk of battles and sieges, and deeds only fit for pagans and wolves." ...|$|R
