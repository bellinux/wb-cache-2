5|$|In 1966 Donen {{made another}} Hitchcock-inspired film: Arabesque, {{starring}} Gregory Peck and Sophia Loren. The film {{was written by}} Julian Mitchell and Stanley Price, with an uncredited rewrite by Peter Stone.

The Tennessee Walker did not figure prominently in original Missouri Fox Trotter pedigrees, and so the FFHA, by restricting the amount of Walker blood, <b>is</b> <b>attempting</b> <b>to</b> develop horses that more closely resemble the original Fox Trotter type.|$|E

The local people suggest that the entire Diogue–Nikine–Carabane area needs saving.|$|E

5|$|Female loggerheads first {{reproduce}} {{between the}} ages of 17 and 33, and their mating period may last more than six weeks. They court their mates, but these behaviors have not been thoroughly examined. Male forms of courtship behavior include nuzzling, biting, and head and flipper movements. Studies suggest females produce cloacal pheromones to indicate reproductive ability. Before mating, the male approaches a female and attempts to mount her, while she resists. Next, the male and female begin to circle each other. If the male has competitors, the female may let the males struggle with each other. The winner then mounts the female; the male's curved claws usually damage the shoulders of the female's shell during this process. Other courting males bite the male while he <b>is</b> <b>attempting</b> <b>to</b> copulate, damaging his flippers and tail, possibly exposing bones. Such damage can cause the male to dismount and may require weeks to heal.|$|E

Kecal agrees, and rushes off to prepare the contract. Alone, Jeník ponders the deal he has apparently made to barter his beloved ("When you discover whom you've bought"), wondering how anyone could believe that he would really do this, and finally expressing his love for Mařenka.|$|E

5|$|Other {{similarities}} include {{engaging in}} the suspense the speaker <b>is</b> <b>attempting</b> <b>to</b> create. In both scenarios, you must put aside {{the knowledge that the}} performers know the outcome of the event being relayed and, in a sense, play along. This is integral to his stance as he explains “the argument that much of talk consists of replayings and that these make no sense unless some form of storyteller's suspense can be maintained shows the close relevance of frame-indeed, the close relevance of dramaturgy-for the organization of talk.” Lastly, because the replaying of strips is not extemporaneous, but rather preformulated, it is yet another parallel between a stage production and conversation. All of these things work in concert to provide a foundation of how talk is framed.|$|E
