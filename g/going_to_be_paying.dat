The money had been used for other projects, such as the {{integration}} of the IRT Dyre Avenue Line, and IND Rockaway Line and reconfiguration of the DeKalb Avenue Interlocking. By then, the New York Times despaired of the line's ever being built. [...] "It certainly will cost more than $500,000,000 and will require a new bond issue," [...] wrote one reporter. In March of that year, NYCTA chairman Charles L. Patterson stated that the NYCTA had used the bond funds properly and that the bonds were not dedicated solely to fund the Second Avenue Line. He stated that the bonds had <b>been</b> allocated <b>to</b> the corridor based on increasing ridership on the Second Avenue Line, but admitted that currency inflation, as well as necessary rehabilitation work to the existing lines, made the Second Avenue Line unlikely in the near future.|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} delay {{discounting}} has become widespread {{over the past}} several decades for numerous reasons, many of which are captured nicely in Madden and Bickel’s (2010) edited book, Impulsivity: The Behavioral and Neurological Science of Discounting. Beyond the fact that studying discount-ing will help advance our basic understanding of behavior, rates of discount-ing have <b>been</b> shown <b>to</b> <b>be</b> associated with disorders such as substance abuse, pathological gambling, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Furthermore, an understanding of discounting can be informative along a number of dimensions (e. g., healthy choices, setting public policy). The general concept of delay discounting is that the value of an event or outcome is decreased when it is delayed in time (or, in the case of probability discounting, when it becomes less probable). For instance, if someone owed you $ 100 and <b>was</b> not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> you for 6 months, you might <b>be</b> willing <b>to</b> accept $ 90 today instead of waiting for the full amount.

5000|$|In 2012, {{following}} the reconfiguration of the state's legislative districts and following Saunders's decision {{to run for}} the Florida Senate rather than seek re-election, an open seat occurred in the reformatted 120th District. Raschein opted {{to run for the}} seat, and faced former Key West Mayor Morgan McPherson, the 2010 nominee, in the Republican primary. She <b>was</b> able <b>to</b> defeat McPherson comfortably, winning 66% of the vote to his 34%, and advanced to the general election, where she faced Ian Whitney, the Democratic nominee. Over the course of the campaign, the two candidates staked out positions in opposition to each other. Raschein supported private school vouchers while Whitney did not; Whitney supported the expansion of Medicaid under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act while Raschein opposed it, noting, [...] "I am all for health care. But I don't know how the states <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for the expansion of Medicaid. The devil is in the details. How <b>are</b> we <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for that? We don't want to cut education anymore, social services can't be cut anymore. I am concerned about how we <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> fund it." [...] Despite the competitive nature of the election, Raschein and Whitney maintained mutual respect and kindness for each other, with Whitney noting {{that the two of them}} got along [...] "very well" [...] and Raschein calling her opponent [...] "a very nice guy." [...] Ultimately, Raschein narrowly defeated Whitney, winning her first term with 52% of the vote to his 48%. In doing so Raschein followed in the footsteps of her great-grandfather Hartley Hendrick Hethcox, who served in the Florida House of Representatives in the 1940s and was a County Commissioner in Lake County.|$|R
