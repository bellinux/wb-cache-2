5|$|Cynics {{were often}} {{recognized}} {{in the ancient world}} by their apparel - an old cloak and a staff. The cloak came as an allusion to Socrates and <b>his</b> <b>manner</b> of dress, while the staff was to the club of Heracles. These items became so symbolic of the Cynic vocation that ancient writers accosted those who thought that donning the Cynic garb would make them suited to the philosophy.|$|E

5|$|John Gregorson Campbell (1836– 22 November 1891) was a Scottish folklorist and Free Church Minister at the Tiree and Coll parishes in Argyll, Scotland. An avid {{collector}} of traditional stories, in 1831 he became Secretary to the Ossianic Society of Glasgow University. Ill health had prevented him taking up employment as a Minister {{when he was}} initially approved to preach by the Presbytery of Glasgow in 1858 and later after he was appointed to Tiree by the Duke of Argyll in 1861, parishioners objected to <b>his</b> <b>manner</b> of preaching.|$|E
5|$|For {{four to five}} years, Baba {{lived under}} a neem tree and often wandered for long periods in the jungle around Shirdi. <b>His</b> <b>manner</b> {{was said to be}} {{withdrawn}} and uncommunicative as he undertook long periods of meditation. He was eventually persuaded to take up residence in an old and dilapidated mosque and lived a solitary life there, surviving by begging for alms, and receiving itinerant Hindu or Muslim visitors. In the mosque he maintained a sacred fire which is referred to as a dhuni, from which he gave sacred ash ('Udi') to his guests before they left. The ash was believed to have healing and apotropaic powers. He performed the function of a local hakim and treated the sick by application of ashes. Sai Baba also delivered spiritual teachings to his visitors, recommending the reading of the Ramayan and Bhagavat Gita for Hindus and Qur'an for Muslims. He insisted on the indispensability of the unbroken remembrance of God's name (dhikr, and often expressed himself in a cryptic manner with the use of parables, symbols and allegories.|$|E

25|$|Theology of Pope Francis is an {{analysis}} of his personal understanding of Christian beliefs and practices. The focus here is on salient features, what he emphasized during his papacy, what characterized his pontificate. This is usually seen from <b>his</b> <b>manner</b> of expressing himself, often distinguishing his own views from previous practices. Also, {{the focus is on}} his papacy, as distinct from his time as Jesuit provincial or as archbishop in a very special Latin American context. He is the first member of the Society of Jesus to be appointed Pope of the Catholic Church, elected on 13March 2013.|$|E

25|$|Very outspoken {{about his}} ideas, he begged Nicholas II {{to cancel the}} {{coronation}} ball at the French embassy in Moscow following the Khodynka Tragedy, warning him that holding it would create a perception of monarchical indifference such as had made Marie Antoinette unpopular. When it was held nevertheless, he arrived with his brothers, then departed soon after in protest. <b>His</b> <b>manner</b> could turn caustic. The Imperial family always {{said he had a}} mean and critical tongue. He loathed Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna and her family, the Vladimirovichi. A vehement critic of most of his male cousins, Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich in particular, Nicholas Mikhailovich was a divisive figure among the Romanovs.|$|E
25|$|Bernstein's {{conducting}} {{was characterized}} by extremes of emotion with the rhythmic pulse of the music conveyed visually through his balletic podium manner. Musicians often reported that <b>his</b> <b>manner</b> in rehearsal {{was the same as}} in concert. As he got older his performances tended to be overlaid to a greater extent with a personal expressiveness which often divided critical opinion. Extreme examples of this style can be found in his Deutsche Grammophon recordings of Nimrod from Elgar's Enigma Variations (1982), the end of Mahler's 9th Symphony (1985), and the finale of Tchaikovsky's Pathetique Symphony (1986), where in each case the tempos are well below those typically chosen.|$|E
25|$|In April, Parker {{made his}} first mistake with Presley's career. He had booked him into a four-week Las Vegas engagement, misjudging the {{reaction}} of the slightly older, more reserved audiences that Las Vegas attracted. While Presley was a hit among the youth of America, the middle-aged audiences found him to be something of an oddity. Some viewed him as a clown-like figure, wiggling his hips for screams like a monkey for peanuts, while others found <b>his</b> <b>manner</b> of performance vulgar and more suitable for late-night gentleman's clubs. After a very cool reception during his first few shows, Parker cut Presley's appearance to two weeks. Presley would later remember the event as one of the worst moments of his career.|$|E

Although he was ambitious, Tuyến was aware of his provincial accent and <b>his</b> <b>manner</b> of stumbling over long words, which was {{not considered to be}} consistent with the archetypal leader with a city accent. In 1946, while still a student, Tuyến came to know the Ngô family by chance. His future mentor Ngô Đình Nhu wanted to travel from Hanoi to a Catholic area near the border with Laos and needed a guide. A Catholic priest asked Tuyến to lead the way on a bicycle while Nhu followed in a covered cyclo to evade French colonial and Vietminh attention.|$|E
25|$|In the Garrick Club in London are two {{portraits of}} the actor {{ascribed}} to Hogarth, and a portrait by Gainsborough is in Buckingham Palace. His personality was not gracious. His jokes were coarse; his temper irascible; his love of food, his important airs, and his capacity for deep drinking do not command respect; on the other hand, {{a few of his}} jokes were excellent, and there was no rancour in him. On many occasions he showed his willingness to help persons in distress. His character is summarised by Smollett in Humphry Clinker. As an actor <b>his</b> <b>manner</b> was charged with an excess of gravity and deliberation; his pauses were so portentous as in some situations to appear even ludicrous; but he was well fitted for the delivery of Milton's poetry, and for the portrayal of the graver roles in his repertory.|$|E
25|$|During lunchtime, the rain-gods {{visited the}} Gabba and {{confined}} the players indoors till 4:20 pm. The next session of play after that {{was dominated by}} the Indians. Adam Gilchrist, the next batsman in, was usually known to reply with a furious fifty or hundred, but he too, did not hang around for too long, as he lasted for four balls and did not trouble the scorers at all and departed for a duck with the scoreline being 276/6. Again <b>his</b> <b>manner</b> of dismissal was familiar: caught Laxman, bowled Zaheer. Buoyant and hopeful of their prospects of cleaning up the tail after Gilchrist's wicket, the Indians scalped the wicket of Andy Bichel(11 runs) caught by Laxman again, off Agarkar's bowling, then Simon Katich, who had contributed 16 runs to the score, before his nervous stay at the wicket was ended by a tentative poke at a Zaheer delivery to wicket-keeper Parthiv Patel.|$|E

25|$|However, Alexander Grosart {{denies that}} Henry Vaughan was solely an imitator of Herbert. There are moments {{in when the}} reader can {{identify}} Vaughan's true self, rather than an imitation of Herbert. In such passages Vaughan is seen to demonstrate naturalness, immediacy and ability to relate the concrete through poetry. In some instances, Vaughan derives observations from Herbert's language that are distinctly his own. It is as if Vaughan takes proprietorship of some of Herbert's work, yet makes it completely unique to himself. Vaughan takes another step away from Herbert in <b>his</b> <b>manner</b> of presenting his poetry. Herbert in The Temple, which is most often the source of comparison between the two writers, lays down explicit instructions on its reading. This contrasts with the attitude of Vaughan, who saw the experience of reading as the best guide to his meanings and promoted no special reading method.|$|E
25|$|Tong Chi-On – On is a 30-year-old man who {{strives to}} do his best for the Tong family. He has a helpful {{attitude}} toward {{his friends and family}} and keeps the smiles on everybody’s faces. Although <b>his</b> <b>manner</b> is regarded as loving and caring, he is gullible in his relationships and trusts in people too easily often leading to disastrous results. His greatest desire is to find his real family as he is an adopted son of the Tong family and not of true blood, it turns out he is really Gai's son with a third woman. His love interest is Sheung Joi Sum and although she doesn't love him, he still cares for her. He is a comic character in the beginning but by the end he matures greatly. He stands in the place of Hau after her death and is also straightforward in his acts, rejecting Kam's return to the family (much to the dismay of his father).|$|E
25|$|Davros is {{from the}} planet Skaro, whose people, the Kaleds, {{were engaged in a}} bitter thousand-year war of {{attrition}} with their enemies, the Thals. He is horribly scarred and disabled, a condition that various spin-off media attribute to his laboratory being attacked by a Thal shell. He has one functioning hand and one cybernetic eye mounted on his forehead {{to take the place of}} his real eyes, which he is not able to open for long; for much of his existence he depends completely upon a self-designed mobile life-support chair in place of his lower body. It would become an obvious inspiration for his eventual design of the Dalek. The lower half of his body is absent and he is physically incapable of leaving the chair for more than a few minutes without dying. Davros' voice, like those of the Daleks, is electronically distorted. <b>His</b> <b>manner</b> of speech is generally soft and contemplative, but when angered or excited he is prone to ranting outbursts that resemble the hysterical, staccatissimo speech of the Daleks.|$|E
