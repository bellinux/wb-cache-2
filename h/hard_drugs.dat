40|$|Background: <b>Hard</b> <b>drug</b> use has {{a variety}} of heavy personal, social and {{economic}} costs. Knowing the size of the <b>hard</b> <b>drug</b> use population, the types of drugs consumed and modes of consumption can help policy makers design better policies and facilitate decision making. Intravenous drug users constitute one subgroup of <b>hard</b> <b>drug</b> users. The aim {{of this article is to}} describe 1) how the prevalence of intravenous drug use is estimated in Norway and 2) how available data sources give insight about other types of <b>hard</b> <b>drug</b> use even though we can not estimate the true extent of such use. Some policy consequences are outlined. Methods/Materials: Overdose deaths and the mortality multiplier method were used to estimate the prevalence of intravenous drug users. Other materials were used to supply the picture of <b>hard</b> <b>drug</b> use in Norway. Results/Findings: The prevalence of intravenous drug users in Norway increased steadily from the early 1980 s, peaked in 2001, decreased until 2003 and then stabilized. Heroin is the substance of choice of most <b>hard</b> <b>drug</b> users in Norway and injection is the preferred means of intake. Amphetamines are also injected or consumed in other ways, while heavy use of cocaine in the treatment population is low. The use of more than one substance is common. Conclusion: Preventing and reducing heroin injection is the main challenge facing Norwegian policy makers. Other drugs pose a problem as well. Wide availability of substitution treatment has a successful record of helping many former heroin users avoid heroin. The risk of relapsing remains high, however, and of dying after drop out or completion. Current knowledge of <b>hard</b> <b>drug</b> use is fragmented and improved monitoring of this high risk group should be prioritized...|$|R

Haynes was working with Johnny Depp, Bill Carter, Sal Jenco, Flea, and others in a new group, P. In 1993, Haynes played with this band in Los Angeles' Viper Room, on the night the actor River Phoenix died of a drug overdose. Meanwhile, Leary was building {{a reputation as a}} skilled music producer, while Coffey set up his own record label Trance Syndicate.

5|$|Nefarious covers human {{trafficking}} in the United States, Western and Eastern Europe, and Southeast Asia. Interviews are interspersed with re-enactments. The film {{opens with a}} re-enactment of a girl being kidnapped by organized criminals. She is confined with other girls in a dark room, lit by a flickering lightbulb. Men order the girls to remove their clothes, and then examine them and shout commands and threats at them, causing them to cry from fear. One girl is dragged into another room. A victim of ordeals such as these, speaking in voiceover, explains that, in this situation, girls are often taken into a separate room to have their sexual performance tested. Identifying these events as taking place near Belgrade, Serbia, the film then tracks the fictional girls through Croatia to Amsterdam's red-light district De Wallen, and to sex markets in Berlin and Las Vegas. The film states that this slavery goes unnoticed in cities where prostitution is legal. Slaves are depicted in confinement, at their places of work, and as they are sold. Many of the girls are orphans, and all are either kidnapped or tricked into forced prostitution. Traffickers in the film use <b>hard</b> <b>drugs,</b> brainwashing and sexual and physical abuse to keep the girls under control.|$|E
25|$|Legal distinctions {{are made}} in the Opium Law between drugs with a low risk of harm and/or addiction, called soft drugs, and drugs with a high risk of harm and/or addiction, called <b>hard</b> <b>drugs.</b> Soft drugs include hash, marijuana, {{sleeping}} pills and sedatives, while <b>hard</b> <b>drugs</b> include heroin, cocaine, amphetamine, LSD and ecstasy. Policy has been to largely tolerate the sale of soft drugs while strongly suppressing the sale, circulation and use of <b>hard</b> <b>drugs,</b> effectively separating it into two markets. Establishments that have been permitted to sell soft drugs under certain circumstances are called coffee shops. Laws established in January 2013 required visitors of coffee shops to be Dutch residents, but these laws were only applied in Zeeland, North Brabant and Limburg after much local criticism. Possession of a soft drug for personal use in quantities below a certain threshold (5 grams of cannabis or 5 cannabis plants) is tolerated, but larger quantities or posession of <b>hard</b> <b>drugs</b> may lead to prosecution. Prosecution for possession, trade and (in some rare cases) use are typically handled by the muncipal government except where large-scale criminal activity is suspected.|$|E
2500|$|Some studies {{state that}} {{while there is no}} proof for the gateway hypothesis, young {{cannabis}} users should still be considered as a risk group for intervention programs.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Much {{research}} has documented that youthful substance use typically follows a sequence starting {{with use of}} alcohol or tobacco or both and potentially proceeding to marijuana and then <b>hard</b> <b>drug</b> use. This study explicitly examined the probabilities of progression through each stage and their covariates. METHODS: A secondary analysis of data from the National Household Survey on Drug Abuse (1979 - 1997) was conducted with particular sensitivity {{to the nature of}} substance use progression, sampling procedures, and reliability of self-report data. RESULTS: Progression to marijuana and <b>hard</b> <b>drug</b> use was uncommon among persons born before World War II. The stages phenomenon essentially emerged with the baby boom and rose to a peak among persons born around 1960. Subsequently, progression risks at each stage declined. Progression risks were also higher among younger initiators of alcohol, tobacco, or marijuana use. CONCLUSIONS: The recent increase in youthful marijuana use has been offset by lower rates of progression to <b>hard</b> <b>drug</b> use among youths born in the 1970 s. Dire predictions of future <b>hard</b> <b>drug</b> abuse by youths who {{came of age in the}} 1990 s may be greatly overstated...|$|R

25|$|There are varying rules {{within these}} categories, {{for example the}} amount possessed, the role played in the {{transaction}} and {{the intent of the}} goods. Regarding coffee shops, the line between law and practice thins. A coffee shop is a heavily controlled business establishment where individuals can purchase a personal dose of soft drugs in the form of joints, pastry, drinks and packages. In theory illegal, these shops must abide by governmental and local regulations, as well as meet the AHOJ-G criteria, an acronym for: No Advertising, <b>Hard</b> <b>drugs,</b> Nuisance of any kind, Jongeren (minors under 18), and a limit of five grams per transaction. Additionally, the maximum stock at any time is five hundred grams. Local governments may impose additional rules, such as closing times, zoning (coffee shops may not be close to schools), and parking restrictions. The rationale behind coffee shops is to keep citizens away from the <b>hard</b> <b>drugs</b> scene, bringing them to a safe, social, and regulated environment.|$|E

40|$|KEY FINDINGS Characteristics of the neighbourhoods {{in which}} young people live do {{play a role in}} {{influencing}} aspects of their delinquent and drug using behaviour, although their impact is relatively weak in comparison to the effect of individual characteristics, such as gender and personality. The neighbourhood factors involved in explaining higher levels of delinquency, cannabis and <b>hard</b> <b>drug</b> use amongst 16 year olds are quite different, which indicates that a different theoretical framework may be needed to understand the contextual effects of areas on different problematic behaviours. Whereas delinquency and <b>hard</b> <b>drug</b> use are partially explained by negative neighbourhood characteristics (such as greater deprivation in the case of delinquency and higher crime rates for <b>hard</b> <b>drug</b> use), more frequent cannabis use is greater within prosperous neighbourhoods but also within areas in which there is greater social disorganisation.

25|$|The {{drug policy}} of the Netherlands is marked by its {{distinguishing}} between so called soft and <b>hard</b> <b>drugs.</b> An often used argument is that alcohol, which is claimed by some scientists as a hard drug, is legal and a soft drug can't be more dangerous to society if it's controlled. This may refer to the Prohibition in the 1920s, when the U.S. government decided to ban all alcohol. Prohibition created a golden opportunity for organized crime syndicates to smuggle alcohol, {{and as a result}} the syndicates were able to gain considerable power in some major cities.|$|E
25|$|A 2010 survey {{estimated}} about 46,000 {{hard drug}} {{users in the}} country, with 70% of the users to be within {{the age group of}} 15 to 29.

Only 12 of the 17 municipalities studied had any type of rehabilitation centre. There has been a sharp increase in the seizure of drugs such as hashish, heroin and opium in the past few years; and there are indications that drug traffickers are trying to establish Nepal as a transit point.|$|E
25|$|A {{government}} committee {{delivered in}} June 2011 a report about Cannabis to the Dutch government. It includes {{a proposal that}} cannabis with more than 15 percent THC should be labeled as <b>hard</b> <b>drugs.</b> Higher concentrations of THC and drug tourism have challenged the current policy {{and led to a}} re-examination of the current approach; e.g. ban of all sales of cannabis to tourists in coffeeshops from end of 2011 was proposed but currently only the border city of Maastricht has adopted the measure in order to test out its feasibility. According to the initial measure, starting in 2012, each coffeeshop was to operate like a private club with some 1,000 to 1,500 members. In order to qualify for a membership card, applicants would have to be adult Dutch citizens, membership was only to be allowed in one club.|$|E

40|$|An {{ongoing debate}} within the {{literature}} concerns whether cannabis is a ‘stepping-stone’ or ‘gateway’ drug which leads to future <b>hard</b> <b>drug</b> use. There is particular disagreement over the causal mechanisms involved, and whether the relationship between cannabis and <b>hard</b> <b>drug</b> use is a direct effect due to cannabis use per se, or an indirect effect due to underlying predispositions and social factors relating to cannabis use. This paper examines and evaluates such explanations of the potential causal mechanisms involved and the variables which mediate this relationship. It is concluded that psycho-physiological and neurological, social, genetic and environmental explanation can all in part account for the statistical relationships observed between cannabis and <b>hard</b> <b>drug</b> use. However, {{it may be that}} cannabis has its gateway effects through a number of potential mechanisms, with no one mechanism accounting fully for observed relationships.

40|$|Empirical {{studies have}} found that {{cannabis}} commonly precedes consumption of drugs like amphetamine, ecstasy, cocaine and heroin. As a result a causal linkage between cannabis and subsequent <b>hard</b> <b>drug</b> use has been hypothesized. Despite mixed empirical evidence and a limited understanding of possible transmission mechanisms, the causal gateway hypothesis has been influential in formulating a strict drug policy in many western countries. Individual differences in proneness and accessibility, however, provide alternative, non-causal explanations for the observed "staircase" pattern and yield potentially different policy implications. We propose a Bayesian estimation and predictive framework to analyze the effects and relative importance of previous cannabis use, proneness and accessibility factors on <b>hard</b> <b>drug</b> initiation and to explore potential policy implications, using data from a unique recent survey of young adults in Norway. Motivated by the gateway transmission channels proposed in the literature, our model allows for a constant and a heterogeneous effect of previous cannabis use on <b>hard</b> <b>drug</b> initiation and, also, a more flexible correlation pattern for the unobservables. We find that proneness, accessibility and previous cannabis use contribute to the observed higher drug use pattern among cannabis users. The latter has the largest effect and is driven by various transmission channels. accessibility, Bayesian prior-posterior analysis, Bayesian predictive analysis, cannabis gateway, cannabis use, <b>hard</b> <b>drug</b> use, Markov Chain Monte Carlo, policy, proneness...|$|R
25|$|The {{resulting}} album, Come Taste the Band, {{was released}} in October 1975, one month before Bolin's Teaser album. Despite mixed reviews and so-so sales (#19 in the UK charts and #43 in the US Billboard charts), the collection revitalised the band once again, bringing a new, extreme funk edge to their hard rock sound. Bolin's influence was crucial, and with encouragement from Hughes and Coverdale, the guitarist developed much of the album's material. Despite Bolin's talents, his personal problems with <b>hard</b> <b>drugs</b> began to manifest themselves. During the Come Taste the Band tour, many fans openly booed Tommy's inability to play solos like Ritchie Blackmore, not realising that Bolin was physically hampered by his addiction. At this same time, as he would admit in interviews years later, Hughes was suffering from a cocaine addiction. After several below-par concert performances, the band was in danger.|$|E
25|$|One of the proposals, {{known as}} the 'Coffee Corner Plan', {{proposed}} by then-mayor Leers and supported unanimously by the city council in 2008, was to relocate the coffeeshops from the city centre {{to the outskirts of}} the town (in some cases near the national Dutch-Belgian border). The purpose of this plan was to reduce the impact of drug tourism on the city centre, such as parking problems and the illegal sale of <b>hard</b> <b>drugs</b> {{in the vicinity of the}} coffeeshops, and to monitor the sale and use of cannabis more closely in areas away from the crowded city centre. The Coffee Corner Plan, however, has met with fierce opposition from neighbouring municipalities (some in Belgium) and from members of the Dutch and Belgian parliament. The plan has been the subject of various legal challenges and has not been carried out up to this date (2014).|$|E
