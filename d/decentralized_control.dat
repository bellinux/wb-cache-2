50|$|Regarding to {{architecture}} of microgrid control or any control problem {{there are two}} different approaches can be identified: centralizedand decentralized. A fully centralized control relies ona big amount of information transmittence between involving units and then the decision is made at a single point. Hence, it will present big problem in implementation since interconnected power systems usually cover extended geographic and involves enormous number of units. The fully centralized control is currently considered as infeasible solution. On another hand, in a fully <b>decentralized</b> <b>control</b> each unit is controlled byits local controller without knowing the situation of others. The fully <b>decentralized</b> <b>control</b> is also irrelevant in this context due to strong coupling between the operations of various units in the system. A compromise between those two extreme control schemes can be achieved by means of a hierarchical control scheme consisting of three control levels: primary, secondary, and tertiary.|$|E
