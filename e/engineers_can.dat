The {{building}} includes a human functional {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) laboratory, where scientists, clinicians, and <b>engineers</b> <b>can</b> study fundamental aspects of brain function. Construction of the lab was funded in part by a $14.8million in stimulus money grant from the National Institute of Health.|$|E
5|$|A {{nest box}} {{can also be}} {{regarded}} as an animal surveillance device. Surveilling animals {{can lead to the}} discovery of new scientific and industrial fields. For example, biologists and <b>engineers</b> <b>can</b> work on barn owl surveillance techniques and devices, while social scientists document the practices that cause humans to observe an animal. While the diet of the barn owl has been studied, other areas like breeding success are not well known. Nest boxes provide direct physical access to the breeding location.|$|E

50|$|To {{set up the}} {{equalization}} for {{a concert}} or other performance in a venue, a short burst of white or pink noise is sent through the PA system and monitored from various points in the venue so that the <b>engineer</b> <b>can</b> tell if the acoustics of the building naturally boost or cut any frequencies. The <b>engineer</b> <b>can</b> then adjust the overall equalization to ensure a balanced mix.|$|R

Mission Control cancelled the installation of a similar payload attachment system on the starboard side. The port UCCAS was deployed successfully during STS-127 by releasing the stuck pin with a custom made tool.|$|E
25|$|<b>Engineers</b> <b>can</b> {{now have}} {{numerical}} control over automated devices. The {{result has been}} a rapidly expanding range of applications and human activities. Computer-aided technologies (or CAx) now {{serve as the basis for}} mathematical and organizational tools used to create complex systems. Notable examples of CAx include Computer-aided design (CAD software) and Computer-aided manufacturing (CAM software). The improved design, analysis, and manufacture of products enabled by CAx has been beneficial for industry.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} United States Army Corps of <b>Engineers</b> <b>can</b> {{be traced back}} to 16 June 1775, when the Continental Congress {{organized}} an army with a chief engineer and two assistants. Colonel Richard Gridley became General George Washington's first chief engineer; however, it was not until 1779 that Congress created a separate Corps of Engineers. One of its first tasks was to build fortifications near Boston at Bunker Hill. The first Corps of Engineers was mostly composed of French subjects who had been hired by General Washington from the service of Louis XVI.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the major}} uses of this method is {{soldering}} of electronic assemblies. There are two main types of profiles used today: The Ramp-Soak-Spike (RSS) and the Ramp to Spike (RTS). In modern systems, quality management practices in manufacturing industries have produced automatic process algorithms such as PWI, where soldering ovens come preloaded with extensive electronics and programmable inputs to define and refine process specifications. By using algorithms such as PWI, <b>engineers</b> <b>can</b> calibrate and customize parameters to achieve minimum process variance and a near zero defect rate.|$|E
25|$|The Corps of Royal <b>Engineers</b> <b>can</b> trace {{its origins}} back 900 years, {{during which time}} they have been {{involved}} in every major conflict the British Army has fought in. The Royal Flying Corps – the forerunner of the Royal Air Force – and the present day Royal Signals were originally part of the Corps. Their first recipient of the Victoria Cross received the award for actions performed during the Crimean War, while the last came during the Second World War. In total, thirty-six Royal Engineers have been awarded the Victoria Cross, across ten different conflicts or campaigns.|$|E
25|$|In {{magnetic}} confinement reactors, hydrogen gas (usually a 50-50 mixture of two heavier isotopes of ordinary hydrogen, namely deuterium and tritium) is heated to very high temperatures (about 150 million degrees Celsius). At these high temperatures electrons separate from hydrogen nuclei {{and the gas}} becomes plasma, which {{is often referred to}} as the fourth state of matter, the others being solid, liquid and gas. By controlling, or confining, the flow of plasma in test reactors, <b>engineers</b> <b>can</b> cause hydrogen nuclei to collide and fuse – creating for short amounts of time a nuclear fusion reaction that generates heat. One of the unsolved challenges of controlled nuclear fusion energy is to sustain a reaction that generates more energy than what goes into just maintaining the operation of the reactor plasma itself.|$|E
50|$|Mics {{are set up}} for {{the lead}} vocalist and backup vocalist and the singers are asked to sing {{individually}} and as a group, so that the <b>engineer</b> <b>can</b> adjust the levels and equalization. The final part of the sound check is to have the rhythm section and all the vocalists perform a song from their repertoire. During this song, the <b>engineer</b> <b>can</b> adjust the balance of the different instruments and vocalists. This allows the sound of the instruments and vocals to be fine-tuned prior to the audience hearing the first song.|$|R

25|$|One of {{the main}} {{features}} of The Things gameplay is the inclusion of multiple NPCs who join Blake at various points throughout the game. At any one time, the player can control up to four characters; Blake and three NPCs. There are three types of NPC in the game; engineers, soldiers and medics. <b>Engineers</b> <b>can</b> repair fuse boxes, which control locked doors, computers and save points. Soldiers have more health, and are better shots than engineers or medics. They are thus more suited to combat. Medics are capable of healing both Blake and any other injured NPCs, and carry unlimited health packs. The player can issue basic commands to each NPC, such as ordering them to follow Blake, ordering them remain where they are, ordering them to give Blake their weapon, and, {{in the case of}} engineers, ordering them to fix a fuse box.|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} scientists, inventors, and science fiction writers have also {{credited}} Tom Swift with inspiring them, including Ray Kurzweil, Robert A. Heinlein, and Isaac Asimov. The Tom Swift, Jr. adventures were Steve Wozniak's favorite reading {{as a boy}} and inspired {{him to become a}} scientist. According to Wozniak, reading the Tom Swift books made him feel [...] "that <b>engineers</b> <b>can</b> save the world from all sorts of conflict and evil".|$|E
500|$|The {{primary purpose}} of the indoor-outdoor {{thermometer}} is to allow the outside temperature to be indicated inside a building, thus removing the need to go outside to take a temperature reading. [...] They are also used in vehicles, and are particularly useful for municipal vehicles involved in snow and ice clearance. Building maintenance <b>engineers</b> <b>can</b> use an indoor-outdoor thermometer that has not been installed to get a quick reading of air temperature in a location inside a building. [...] This is done by swinging the bulb of the outdoor sensor in the air while still attached to the instrument. This will get a faster reading because the bulb will come up to temperature much more quickly than the indoor sensor built into the instrument.|$|E

50|$|After formal education, the {{engineer}} will often enter an internship or engineer in training status for approximately four years. After {{that time the}} <b>engineer</b> <b>can</b> {{decide whether or not}} to take a state licensing test to make them a Professional Engineer. After successful completion of that test, the Professional <b>engineer</b> <b>can</b> place the initials P.E. after their name signifying that they are now a Professional Engineer.There are also graduate degree options for an engineer. Many engineers decide to complete a master's degree in some field of engineering or business administration or get education in law, medicine, or other field.|$|R

2500|$|To avoid [...] {{thermal shock}} {{affecting}} production, the steepest slope in the thermal profile is determined and leveled. Manufacturers use custom-built software to accurately determine and decrease the steepness of the slope. In addition, the software also automatically recalibrates the PWI {{values for the}} peak, slope, reflow, and soak processes. By setting PWI values, <b>engineers</b> <b>can</b> ensure that the reflow soldering work does not overheat or cool too quickly.|$|E

2500|$|Their {{inherent}} {{focus on}} practical implementation of technology {{has tended to}} keep them oriented more towards incremental-level redesigns and reconfigurations, as opposed to revolutionary research & development or ideas that would be many years from clinical adoption; however, {{there is a growing}} effort to expand this time-horizon over which clinical <b>engineers</b> <b>can</b> influence the trajectory of biomedical innovation. In their various roles, they form a [...] "bridge" [...] between the primary designers and the end-users, by combining the perspectives of being both 1) close to the point-of-use, while 2) trained in product and process engineering. Clinical engineering departments will sometimes hire not just biomedical engineers, but also industrial/systems engineers to help address operations research/optimization, human factors, cost analysis, etc. Also see safety engineering {{for a discussion of the}} procedures used to design safe systems.|$|E

2500|$|With {{the advent}} of the Compact Disc (CD), music is encoded to a digital format with a clearly defined maximum peak {{amplitude}}. Once the maximum amplitude of a CD is reached, loudness can be increased still further through signal processing techniques such as dynamic range compression and equalization. <b>Engineers</b> <b>can</b> apply an increasingly high ratio of compression to a recording until it more frequently peaks at the maximum amplitude. In extreme cases, efforts to increase loudness can result in clipping and other audible distortion. Modern recordings that use extreme dynamic range compression and other measures to increase loudness therefore can sacrifice sound quality to loudness. The competitive escalation of loudness has led music fans and members of the musical press to refer to the affected albums as [...] "victims of the loudness war." ...|$|E
2500|$|Young's modulus is {{not always}} the same in all orientations of a material. Most metals and ceramics, along with many other materials, are isotropic, and their {{mechanical}} properties are the same in all orientations. However, metals and ceramics can be treated with certain impurities, and metals can be mechanically worked to make their grain structures directional. These materials then become anisotropic, and Young's modulus will change depending on the direction of the force vector. Anisotropy can be seen in many composites as well. For example, carbon fiber has a much higher Young's modulus (is much stiffer) when force is loaded parallel to the fibers (along the grain). [...] Other such materials include wood and reinforced concrete. <b>Engineers</b> <b>can</b> use this directional phenomenon to their advantage in creating structures.|$|E
2500|$|After 1917, {{numerous}} {{transformations of}} Nikolaevsky Engineering Academy and Engineering school were undertaken (but Higher learning institution survived). It was renamed as the Military-Engineering Academy, {{and then as}} Military-Technical Academy. But in 1932 followed the unsuccessful attempt of moving the Engineering Faculty to Moscow; it was completed later as the Sea Faculty returned to Leningrad in 1939 (As a result, from the base Saint Petersburg Engineering Higher learning institution was separated a new Moscow military Engineering-administrative academy). Only Nikolay Gerasimovich Kuznetsov could counteract Joseph Stalin`s policy against the Nikolaevsky Engineering Academy and school in 1939. He ordered that the university be revived, and that the Marine Engineering faculty be returned from Moscow. The attempts at bureaucratic movings (or Stalin's unfavorable attitude, 1932–1939) of the Saint Petersburg High School of Military <b>Engineers</b> <b>can</b> be examined in the historical context of the [...] "Military Case" [...] and Great Purge, {{on the eve of}} war against fascism.
