Since 2008, 29 WIM systems were installed for the French Ministry of Transport on the main road network, i. e. highways and motorways. They continuously screen overloaded and speeding vehicles and allow to target the controls on presumed violators. The check efficiency was increased by a factor 3, and the accuracy of the WIM systems now allows envisioning the future development of an automated overload control (AOC) system.

40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} effect of {{constrained}} trade finance on trade flows in countries undergoing financial and balance of payments crises. Most of the countries that had a major crisis had a significant trade contraction, while trade-related finance declined sharply. However, trade may also be affected by other variables such as world demand, domestic demand, banking crises, changes in export and import prices, and real exchange rate depreciation. To estimate {{the effect of}} constrained trade finance on trade flows, we estimate import and export volume equations including explicitly trade financing as an explanatory variable {{in addition to the}} usual variables such as relative prices and income. We conclude that constrained trade finance is a factor in explaining both export and import volumes in the short-run. A fall in external trade finance explains a relatively small part of the trade loss during crises, while a fall in trade financing in connection with domestic banking crisis can lead to a substantial loss of trade.

We prove that statistics of weak solutions areoptimally computable in the simple but important case of small bodyforce and large initial data.

In the case of arbitrarily large body force and initialdata, for shear <b>flows,</b> <b>statistics</b> of the computed solution are shownto behave according to the Kolmogorov theory. Many times, in turbulent fluid flow, a direct numerical simulationbecomes expensive. One alternative is Large Eddy Simulation (LES). It exploits the decoupling of scales, achieved via introduction of afilter, thus {{reducing the number of}} degrees of freedom in asimulation. A relatively new family of LES models is the ApproximateDeconvolution Models (ADM). They have remarkable mathematicalproperties and perform well in computations. However, some reportsclaim that they are unstable for simulations with walls and requirethe addition of explicit stabilization. We show that, given the right formulation, variationaldiscretizations of the Zeroth Order Model, a member of the ADMfamily, are indeed stable. We present evidence that stability of oneformulation is sensitive to the exact way in which filtering isperformed and show some numerical results. An alternativeformulation, which does not depend on the way filtering isperformed, is also presented. In both cases we perform convergencestudies. This is a first step in determining stable and robustdiscretizations for the whole family of ADM, as well as guidance fordealing with arbitrary geometries/domains that arise in practicalapplications. Getting a prediction of a turbulent flow right also means gettingthe energy balance and the rotational structures correct, whichmeans (in the large) matching the energy and helicity statistics.

Such flows are common in the environment but there are few high-resolution measurements of them under controlled conditions. The reaction NO + O 3 → NO 2 + O 2 + 200 kJ (mol) − 1 (in the absence of UV radiation) has been used by introducing a non-buoyant reactive plume of NO into a turbulent grid flow doped with O 3. The experiments have been conducted over a wide range of conditions by varying the Damko¨hler number (the ratio of the flow timescale to that of the chemical reaction) by a factor of 6 and varying the ratio of initial reactant concentrations by a factor of 30. The data are presented in two park. Part 1 (present paper) presents conventional concentration statistics. Part 2 presents concentration statistics conditionally averaged by a mixing parameter and discusses their usefulness for investigating; the reactive behaviour of the plume. Specially developed chemiluminescent analysers are used to measure NO and O 3 concentrations with high-frequency response and a spatial resolution of four Kolmogorov scales (in this flow). The mixing field of the plume is studied using conserved scalar theory and is compared. to that obtained in other non-reactive flows. Results for the means, variances and joint statistics of the reactive species are presented and compared with frozen and equilibrium limits obtained from the conserved scalar theory for reacting <b>flows.</b> <b>Statistics</b> for NO show no significant trend with Damko¨hler number while those for O 3 and NO 2 have increased reaction at higher Damko¨hler number.

A simple relation between moments of O 3 and N 02 is found in the experimental results and is confirmed by conserved scalar theory.

40|$|Abstract — Many routers can {{generate}} and export <b>statistics</b> on <b>flows</b> of packets that traverse them. Increasingly, high end routers form <b>flow</b> <b>statistics</b> from only a sampled packet stream {{in order to}} manage resource consumption involved. This paper addresses three questions. Firstly: what are the downstream consequences for the measurement infrastructure? Long traffic flows will be split up if the time between sampled pack-ets exceeds the flow timeout. Using packet header traces we show that flows generated by increasingly prevalent peer-to-peer applica-tions are vulnerable to this effect. Secondly: can the volume of packet-sampled <b>flow</b> <b>statistics</b> be easily determined? We develop a simple model that predicts both the export rate of <b>flow</b> packet-sampled <b>flow</b> <b>statistics</b> and the num-ber of active flows. It uses unsampled flow statistics—those com-monly currently collected—as its data, i. e., it does not rely on having packet header traces available. Thirdly: what properties of the original traffic stream can be in-ferred from the packet sampled <b>flow</b> <b>statistics?</b> We show {{that as well as}} estimating total bytes and packets, one can also infer more detail, specifically the number and average length of flows in the un-sampled traffic stream, even though some flows will have no packets sampled. We believe that this information is useful, both for under-standing source traffic, e. g. the dependence of flow lengths on appli-cation type, and also monitoring changes in the composition of the traffic, e. g., a flood of short flows during a DoS attack.

Previous work on estimating the flow size distribution for the complete population of flows has produced techniques that either make inferences from sampled network traffic, or use data streaming approaches. In this work, we identify and solve a more challenging problem of estimating the size distribution and other statistical {{information about}} arbitrary subpopulations of flows. Inferring subpopulation <b>flow</b> <b>statistics</b> is more challenging than the complete population counterpart, since subpopulations of interest are often specified a posteriori (i. e., after the data collection is done), {{making it impossible for}} the data collection module to “plan in advance”.

Our algorithm {{is based on the}} premise that local optical <b>flow</b> <b>statistics</b> are affected by distortions and the deviation from pristine <b>flow</b> <b>statistics</b> is proportional to the amount of distortion. We characterize the local <b>flow</b> <b>statistics</b> using the mean, the standard deviation, the coefficient of variation (CV), and the minimum eigenvalue (lambda(min)) of the local flow patches. Temporal distortion is estimated as the change in the CV of the distorted flow with respect to the reference flow, and the correlation between lambda(min) of the reference and of the distorted patches. We rely on the robust multi-scale structural similarity index for spatial quality estimation. The computed temporal and spatial distortions, thus, are then pooled using a perceptually motivated heuristic to generate a spatio-temporal quality score. The proposed method is shown to be competitive with the state-of-the-art when evaluated on the LIVE SD database, the EPFL Polimi SD database, and the LIVE Mobile HD database. The distortions considered in these databases include those due to compression, packet-loss, wireless channel errors, and rate-adaptation. Our algorithm is flexible enough to allow for any robust FR spatial distortion metric for spatial distortion estimation. In addition, the proposed method is not only parameter-free but also independent of the choice of the optical flow algorithm. Finally, we show that the replacement of the optical flow vectors in our proposed method with the much coarser block motion vectors also results in an acceptable FR-VQA algorithm. Our algorithm is called the flow similarity index...|$|R
