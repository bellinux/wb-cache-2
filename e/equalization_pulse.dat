In this paper, {{the potential of}} non-directed, equalized optical wireless systems is theoretically investigated, {{taking into account the}} indoor channel impulse response and the characteristics of ambient light noise and thermal noise at the receiver. Three modulation schemes, Pulse-Position-Modulation, On-Off Keying and Pulse Amplitude Modulation, are combined with appropriate equalization methods in order to mitigate the effect of intersymbol interference induced by the infrared chanel. It is shown that the various non-directed configurations can provide data rates of the order of 100 Mb/s and beyond, over a medium sized room.

40|$|Graduation date: 2011 Short-range {{wireless}} communications continually attract interest from both industry and academia, {{and it is}} changing our life in every aspect in the last decade. The design of wireless transceivers is the bottleneck for variety applications, due to RF modeling inaccuracy, stringent FCC regulations over the transmitted power spectrum, interference, multi-path reflections, modulation scheme, receiver sensitivity, and synchronization. In addition, energy efficiency is always {{one of the most}} important design goals. Ultra-Wideband(UWB) is found to be very energy-efficient due to its low duty cycle and potentially high data rate due to its wide bandwidth. However, there still remain unsolved issues with UWB transceivers, such as pulse shaping, multi-path reflections, and receiver clock synchronization. To address these, novel techniques such as wireless multi-path <b>equalization,</b> <b>pulse</b> injection-locking for receiver clock synchronization, reconfigurable pulse shaping, low power wireless clock distribution, and an ultra-low-power super-regenerative receiver are implemented and verified on silicon. Three chips are designed and verified: a 3 - 5 GHz Impulse-Radio(IR) UWB transceiver, a 3 - 60 GHz all digital reconfigurable transmitter, and a 402 - 405 MHz MICS/UWB(Sub-GHz) super-regenerative receiver incorporating wireless clock synchronization. A detailed design methodology, measurement results, and discussions are presented...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we {{consider}} the design of pulse shaping filter using orthogonal Hermite-Rodriguez basis functions. The pulse shaping filter design problem has been formulated and solved as a quadratic programming problem with linear inequality constraints. Compared with the existing approaches reported in the literature, the use of Hermite-Rodriguez functions offers an effective alternative to solve the constrained filter synthesis problem. This is demonstrated through a numerical example which {{is concerned with the}} design of an equalization filter for a digital transmission channel.

The circuit locks instantaneously and enables sub-nanosecond packet spacing {{due to the}} low clock persistence time. A low-Q Fabry-Perot filter {{is used as a}} passive resonator tuned to the line-rate that generates a retimed clock-resembling signal. As a reshaping element, an optical power-limiting gate is incorporated to perform bitwise <b>pulse</b> <b>equalization.</b> Using two preamble bits, the clock is captured instantly and persists {{for the duration of the}} data packet increased by 16 bits. The performance of the circuit suggests its suitability for future all-optical packet-switched networks with reduced transmission overhead and fine network granularity.

40|$|The {{design of}} envelope-constrained (EC) filters is {{considered}} for the time-domain synthesis of filters for signal processing problems. The objective is to achieve minimal noise enhancement where {{the shape of the}} filter output to a specified input signal is constrained to lie within prescribed upper and lower bounds. Traditionally, problems of this type were treated by using the least-square (LS) approach. However, in many practical signal processing problems, this "soft" least-square approach is unsatisfactory because large narrow excursions from the desired shape occur so that the norm of the filter can be large and the choice of an appropriate weighting function is not obvious. Moreover, the solution can be sensitive to the detailed structure of the desired pulse, and it is usually not obvious how the shape of the desired pulse should be altered in order to improve on the solution. The "hard" EC filter formulation is more relevant than the "soft" LS approach in a variety of signal processing fields such as robust antenna and filter design, communication channel <b>equalization,</b> and <b>pulse</b> compression in radar and sonar. The distinctive feature is the set of inequality constraints on the output waveform: rather than attempting to match a specific desired pulse, we deal with a whole set of allowable outputs and seek an optimal point of that set. The EC optimal filter design problems involve a convex quadratic cost function and a number of linear inequality constraints. These EC filtering problems are classified into: discrete-time EC filtering problem, continuous-time EC filtering problem, and adaptive discrete-time EC filtering problem. The discrete-time EC filtering problem is handled using the discrete Lagrangian duality theory in combination with the space transformation function. The optimal solution of the dual problem can be computed by finding the limiting point of ++an ordinary differential equation given in terms of the gradient flow. Two iterative algorithms utilizing the simple structure of the gradient flow are developed via discretizing the differential equations. Their convergence properties are derived for a deterministic environment. From the primal-dual relationship, the corresponding sequence of approximate solutions to the original discrete-time EC filtering problem is obtained. The continuous-time EC filtering problem (semi-infinite convex programming problem) is handled using the continuous Lagrangian duality theory and Caratheodory's dimensionality theory. Several important properties are derived and discussed in relation to practical engineering requirements. These include the observation that the continuous-time optimal filter via orthonormal filters has the structure of a matched filter in cascade with another filter. Furthermore, the semi-infinite convex programming problem is converted into an equivalent finite dual optimization problem, which can be solved by the optimization methods developed. Another issue, which relates to the continuous-time optimal filter design problem, is the design of robust optimal EC filters. The robustness issue arises because the solution of the EC filtering problem lies on the boundary of the feasible region. Thus, any disturbance in the prescribed input signal or errors in the implementation of the optimal filter are likely to result in the output constraints being violated. A detailed formulation and a corresponding design method for improving the robustness of optimal EC filters are given. Finally, an adaptive algorithm suitable for a stochastic environment is presented. The convergence properties of the algorithm in a stochastic environment are established...|$|R
40|$|The {{wireless}} communication industry {{has always been}} under tremendous improve- ments {{in the past few}} decades, but will the needs for improvement reach an end? Not at all! The challenge for the future wireless systems is the ability to operate in widely di®erent deployment scenarios supporting di®erent tra±c rates. As part of the International Telecommunication Union Radiocommunication Sector (ITU-R) International Mobile Telecommunication (IMT) Advanced capable Wireless World Initiative New Radio (WINNER) system concept, a diversity based multiple ac- cess scheme for robust uplink transmission denoted as Block Interleaved Frequency Division Multiple Access (B-IFDMA) was proposed to be used in scenarios where transmit channel state information is not readily available due to the imposed over- head, e. g. as with high speed or low data rate and for short control packets. With its dispersed allocation of multiple blocks with equidistant spacing in fre- quency, where each block consists of a few consecutive subcarriers in a few consecu- tive Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) symbols (Svensson et al. 2007), this scheme obtains its robustness and takes advantage of the wireless channel characteristics. Moreover, the dimension of the blocks allocated enables a tunable degree of fre- quency diversity and low allocation signaling overhead. In addition, it allows the high power ampli¯ers (HPA) in the uplink to operate at higher e±ciencies because of the use of a Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) precoding step. In addition, the °exibility of slot allocations enables robust and e±cient transmission even for small packets while improving the battery life in user terminals. In this thesis, end-to-end analysis of B-IFDMA and the other candidate multiple access DFT-precoded techniques Interleaved FDMA (IFDMA), Localized FDMA (LFDMA), together with the non DFT-precoded Block Equidistant FDMA (B- EFDMA) was carried under di®erent deployment scenarios. This was followed by optimal parameter extraction since the results were highly dependent on all the modules involved ranging from the equalization schemes, modulation techniques, channel coding methods, to the channel estimation performance at the receiver. With perfect channel state information at the receiver, Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) <b>equalization</b> and, no <b>pulse</b> shaping, IFDMA provides high frequency diver- sity and low peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), compared to LFDMA. However, in more realistic scenarios, LFDMA has a much better channel estimation perfor- mance at the receiver, the di®erence in PAPR after pulse shaping is rather small, and combined with frequency hopping rather good frequency diversity can be obtained with a penalty on an increased packet transmission delay. The B-IFDMA scheme aims to provide a trade-o® between the strengths of IFDMA and that of LFDMA for very wideband scenarios and in situations where the delay requirements are strin- gent, e. g. due to multi-hop transmission. On the other hand, the non DFT-precoded scheme B-EFDMA collects as much frequency diversity as in B-IFDMA with very close bit error rate performance, but su®ers from high back-o® requirements on the HPA at the transmitter (user terminal). Despite its worst PAPR, it performs the best in the presence of Zero Forcing (ZF) equalization. Lastly, all these schemes were bene¯cial in collecting diversity even in the presence of robust channel codes...|$|R
