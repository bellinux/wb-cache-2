25|$|Russell was the {{youngest}} of four children of Mark E. Russell and Carolyn Lois Russell. He grew up in Sunnyvale, California where his father was a City Councilman and Mayor. His grandfather and great-grandfather were also mayors. Russell’s parents met while serving in the Navy; his father was second-in-command of a tug in Alaska and his mother was a naval <b>flight</b> <b>nurse</b> that tended to the wounded being flown out of Korea.

50|$|All {{nurses in}} basic {{training}} at Selfridge Field {{were asked to}} volunteer for air nurse if they could pass the pilot's physical. Only two percent of 59,000 nurses in World War II were qualified <b>flight</b> <b>nurses.</b> World War II had given rise to the first female <b>flight</b> <b>nurses</b> in the U.S. military. Just 6 of 22 nurses who applied passed the physical. Three of the six {{dropped out of the}} program. Only Lutz and two others, Clara Murphy and Veronica Savinski, were assigned to be <b>flight</b> <b>nurses.</b>|$|R
25|$|Loganair had one {{previous}} {{air ambulance}} accident, also involving a Britten Norman Islander, on 19 May 1996, {{in which the}} pilot was killed, and the two passengers, a physician and a <b>flight</b> <b>nurse,</b> were injured. (In 1996, flights were typically made with a nurse, and sometimes a physician, if needed. The passenger cabin of the Islander was of limited size, and typical of ambulance aircraft, working conditions could be quite cramped with more personnel.) This 1996 accident bore similarities to the 2005 accident. It occurred at night with a single fatigued and poorly rested pilot making an approach in difficult weather, though {{in this case it}} was a strong and gusting crosswind rather than poor visibility that was the primary meteorological challenge.|$|E

25|$|In 1954, Miller {{appeared}} {{as the second}} leading lady in three films. <b>Flight</b> <b>Nurse</b> (1954), starring Joan Leslie, was a drama about US Air Force flight nurses in the Korean War. Miller is a fellow officer of Leslie, involved in a romantic triangle with two pilots. Production ran May 14–mid-June 1953. Geraldine (1954) is a comedy starring Mala Powers. Production ran late June to mid-July 1953. In the noir Western Hell's Outpost, Miller again costarred with Leslie. Production ran July 8–late July 1954. Hell's Outpost introduced Miller to Jim Davis, {{who would be the}} male lead for the only television series that Miller had a continuing role in. During the 1950s, both Joan Leslie and Miller, by now friends, were involved with fundraising for St. Anne's maternity hospital in Los Angeles. During that year, Miller made two appearances on the television series The Lone Wolf, starring Louis Hayward. In one episode, Miller played an adulterous wife reminiscent of The Shadow on the Wall, but is shot by her cuckolded husband instead. She made a guest appearance as Mrs. Manning on Republic's first television series, Stories of the Century, starring Mary Castle and Miller's old Hell's Outpost costar, Jim Davis.|$|E

The department operates a fleet of eight BLS units staffed with two EMTs 24/7, four 12-hour power trucks, five ALS units staffed with two paramedics (one of which is stationed at Newark Airport and covers the airport and Port Newark-Elizabeth, and frequently responds into the City of Elizabeth), and a critical care unit staffed by a paramedic and an RN. With distinction they also staff the only hospital based heavy rescue truck in the country. The EMS system is the busiest system per unit in the nation. On average, a BLS unit may be sent to 20-25 dispatches in a 12-hour shift. [...] They also provide the medical staffing for Northstar, {{with one of the}} two NJ State Police medevac helicopters, staffing one <b>flight</b> <b>nurse</b> and a flight medic around the clock.

2500|$|An {{efficient}} {{procedure for}} aerial evacuation from target areas was quickly developed. The squadron flight surgeon and several pharmacists' mates {{were on the}} first hospital plane {{to land on the}} captured airfield. The surgeon established an evacuation clearing station adjacent to the airstrip, where {{with the help of his}} corpsmen, he collected patients from the first-aid and holding stations and screened them for air transport, giving necessary treatment prior to flight. [...] As soon as the second hospital plane landed, the <b>flight</b> <b>nurse</b> aboard received her orders. The plane was loaded and usually departed in approximately 45 minutes, the <b>flight</b> <b>nurse</b> being responsible for all patients aboard. With the corpsman's aid, she dressed wounds, administered whole blood or plasma, gave medications, and fed the patients. Using this procedure, within 30 days, approximately 4,500 injured men were flown out of Okinawa alone.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Flight</b> <b>nurse</b> Jane [...] "Candy" [...] Kendeigh {{was among}} the first flight nurses to fly to and from an active {{battlefield}} in the Pacific when, on 3 March 1945, she flew round-trip from Guam to Iwo Jima to aid in the evacuation of wounded U.S. Marines. As luck would have it, Ensign Kendeigh was also aboard the Navy's first medical evacuation flight bound for Okinawa, making her the first Navy <b>flight</b> <b>nurse</b> on both Iwo Jima and Okinawa. After her heroic work in Iwo Jima, she was sent back to the U.S. to participate in a War Bond drive.

She flew her missions with Agana, Guam based Air Evacuation Transport Squadron One (VRE-1), which was an elite unit of the Naval Air Transport Service (NATS).|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, Leslie chose {{to focus on}} raising her daughters, which {{resulted}} in a more irregular film career. In 1952, she signed a short-term deal with Republic Pictures, the low-budget studio which primarily produced western pictures. One of the films she made for Republic was <b>Flight</b> <b>Nurse</b> (1953). Leslie's character, Polly Davis, was based on the successful <b>flight</b> <b>nurse</b> Lillian Kinkella Keil's career in the Air Force. It was described by the newspaper Kingsport Times-News as a thrilling film that [...] "honors the courageous women who performed miracles of mercy above the clouds in evacuation of wounded GIs from Korean battlefields." [...] Her last film was The Revolt of Mamie Stover (1956). However, she continued making sporadic appearances in television shows while her children were at school. She retired from acting in 1991, after appearing in the TV film Fire in the Dark.|$|E

2500|$|The {{first group}} of 24 Naval Flight Nurses {{graduated}} from the Navy <b>Flight</b> <b>Nurse</b> School at the Naval Air Station Alameda, California on 22 January 1945. In addition to <b>flight</b> <b>nurse</b> procedures, they were trained to swim one mile, tow or push a victim for 220 yards, and swim 440 yards in 10 minutes. The newly minted flight nurses soon began active flying service on 24 flying teams, consisting of a nurse and a pharmacist's mate. Each 12-plane squadron operated with the following medical personnel: 24 flight nurses, 24 pharmacists' mates, one flight surgeon, and one Hospital Corps officer. After {{a certain number of}} transcontinental trips with wounded servicemen, the teams were sent to the Pacific to serve in the Naval Air Evacuation Service, the first arriving in Guam in early February 1945. There were three main flights of air evacuation planes to which flight nurses were assigned. [...] First, from target areas to forward hospitals, such as Guam: second, from those forward hospitals to Pearl Harbor; and third, from Pearl Harbor to the contiguous United States. Nurses were rotated so that flight hours did not exceed 100 per month and they were also rotated between combat and noncombat flights.|$|E
