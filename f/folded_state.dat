The conformational states from Rosetta's software can be used to initialize a Markov state model as starting points for Folding@home simulations.

As Rosetta only tries to predict the final <b>folded</b> <b>state,</b> and not how folding proceeds, Rosetta@home and Folding@home are complementary and address very different molecular questions.|$|E
25|$|The phi value should {{range from}} 0 to 1, but also {{negative}} phi values can be observed. A phi value of 0 {{implies that the}} mutation {{has no effect on}} the structure of the rate-limiting transition state on the folding pathway, while a phi value of 1 indicates that {{the degree to which the}} transition state is destabilized by the mutation is exactly equal to the degree to which the <b>folded</b> <b>state</b> is destabilized. A phi value near 0 suggests that the region surrounding the mutation is relatively unfolded or unstructured in the transition state, while a value near 1 implies that the local structure around the mutation site in the transition state closely resembles the structure in the native state. It is generally the case that conservative substitutions on the surface of a protein yield phi values near 1. When the phi value is intermediate between 0 and 1, the method cannot directly distinguish between the alternative hypotheses that the transition state is partially structured, or that there are two populations of mostly-unfolded and mostly-folded states.|$|E

40|$|SummaryMost {{mitochondrial}} proteins are encoded by nuclear DNA, synthesized in the cytoplasm, {{and imported}} into mitochondria. Several proteins of the intermembrane space (IMS) are imported and localized through an oxidative process, being folded through {{the formation of}} structural disulfide bonds catalyzed by Mia 40, and trapped in the IMS. To be imported, these proteins need to be reduced and unfolded; however, no structural information in situ exists on these proteins in the cytoplasm.

2500|$|Phi value {{analysis}} is an experimental protein engineering method {{used to study}} {{the structure of the}} folding transition state in small protein domains that fold in a two-state manner. Since the folding transition state is by definition a transient and partially unstructured state, its structure is difficult to determine by traditional methods such as protein NMR or X-ray crystallography. [...] In phi-value analysis, the folding kinetics and conformational folding stability of the wild-type protein are compared with those of one or more point mutants. [...] This comparison yields a phi value (defined below) that seeks to measure the mutated residue's energetic contribution to the folding transition state (and thus the degree of native structure around the mutated residue in the transition state) from the relative free energies of the unfolded state, the <b>folded</b> <b>state</b> and the transition state for the wild-type and mutant proteins.|$|E
2500|$|The {{study of}} protein folding began in 1910 with a famous paper by Harriette Chick and C. J. Martin, {{in which they}} showed that the {{flocculation}} of a protein was composed of two distinct processes: the precipitation of a protein from solution was preceded by another process called denaturation, in which the protein became much less soluble, lost its enzymatic activity and became more chemically reactive. [...] In the mid-1920s, Tim Anson and Alfred Mirsky proposed that denaturation was a reversible process, a correct hypothesis that was initially lampooned by some scientists as [...] "unboiling the egg". [...] Anson also suggested that denaturation was a two-state ("all-or-none") process, in which one fundamental molecular transition resulted in the drastic changes in solubility, enzymatic activity and chemical reactivity; he further noted that the free energy changes upon denaturation were much smaller than those typically involved in chemical reactions. [...] In 1929, Hsien Wu hypothesized that denaturation was protein unfolding, a purely conformational change {{that resulted in the}} exposure of amino acid side chains to the solvent. [...] According to this (correct) hypothesis, exposure of aliphatic and reactive side chains to solvent rendered the protein less soluble and more reactive, whereas the loss of a specific conformation caused the loss of enzymatic activity. [...] Although considered plausible, Wu's hypothesis was not immediately accepted, since so little was known of protein structure and enzymology and other factors could account for the changes in solubility, enzymatic activity and chemical reactivity. [...] In the early 1960s, Chris Anfinsen showed that the folding of ribonuclease A was fully reversible with no external cofactors needed, verifying the [...] "thermodynamic hypothesis" [...] of protein folding that the <b>folded</b> <b>state</b> represents the global minimum of free energy for the protein.|$|E

Interestingly, the authors report that a preference for the <b>folded</b> <b>state</b> is not unique to aryl esters. For example, the cyclohexyl ester favored the <b>folded</b> <b>state</b> more so than the phenyl ester, and the tert-butyl ester favored the <b>folded</b> <b>state</b> by a preference greater than that shown by any aryl ester.

40|$|A {{major goal}} in biology is to {{understand}} how the amino acid sequence encodes all aspects of a protein's structure and dynamics. A protein spends most of its time in its fully <b>folded</b> native <b>state</b> but it also transiently populates high-energy, partially <b>folded</b> <b>states.</b> These high-energy states can be important for function and regulation, in addition to their importance to protein folding (the process by which a protein folds to its native state from the fully unfolded state). Together, all of these conformational states and the dynamics within and between them constitute a protein's energy landscape. Only by fully characterizing protein energy landscapes of model systems can we make progress on understanding all of the information encoded in an amino acid sequence.

50|$|The {{notion that}} {{depletion}} forces {{can also be}} enthalpically driven has surfaced due to recent experiments regarding protein stabilization induced by compatible osmolytes, such as trehalose, glycerol, and sorbitol. These osmolytes are preferentially excluded from protein surfaces, forming a layer of preferential hydration around the proteins. When the protein folds - this exclusion volume diminishes, making the <b>folded</b> <b>state</b> lower in free energy. Hence the excluded osmolytes shift the folding equilibrium towards the <b>folded</b> <b>state.</b> This effect was generally thought to be an entropic force, {{in the spirit of}} the original Asakura-Oosawa model and of macromolecular crowding. However, thermodynamic breakdown of the free-energy gain due to osmolyte addition showed the effect is in fact enthalpically driven, whereas entropy can even be disfavorable.|$|E
50|$|Kinetical accessibility: {{means that}} the path in the free energy surface from the {{unfolded}} to the <b>folded</b> <b>state</b> must be reasonably smooth or, in other words, that the folding of the chain must not involve highly complex changes in the shape (like knots or other high order conformations).|$|E
50|$|A major {{importance}} of macromolecular crowding to biological systems stems from {{its effect on}} protein folding. The underlying physical mechanism by which macromolecular crowding helps to stabilize proteins in their <b>folded</b> <b>state</b> is often {{explained in terms of}} excluded volume - the volume inaccessible to the proteins due to their interaction with macromolecular crowders. This notion goes back to Asakura and Oosawa, who have described depletion forces induced by steric, hard-core, interactions. A hallmark of the mechanism inferred from the above is that the effect is completely a-thermal, and thus completely entropic. These ideas were also proposed to explain why small cosolutes, namely protective osmolytes, which are preferentially excluded from proteins, also shift theprotein folding equilibrium towards the <b>folded</b> <b>state.</b> However, it has been shown by various methods, both experimental and theoretical, that depletion forces are not always entropic in nature.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Oxidative folding {{combines}} {{the formation of}} native disulfide bond with the conformational folding resulting in the native three-dimensional fold.

50|$|The {{capability}} for self-replication, a fundamental feature of life, emerged when double-stranded polynucleotides disassociated into single-stranded ones {{and each of}} these served as a template for synthesis of a complementary strand, producing two double-stranded copies.
