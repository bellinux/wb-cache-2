On July 1, 1856, a court sale of Lewis' {{property}} (including the undivided half-interest {{in the land of the}} Ranch) was held. King had arranged for Maj W.W. Chapman (died 1859) to bid on the Rincón property, which Chapman acquired for $1,575. Chapman had been the quartermaster of Fort Brown in Brownsville, and regulated the steamboat contracts to supply Fort Ringgold, up river in Rio Grande City.

2500|$|In 1977 Gradishar {{assisted}} the Broncos to Super Bowl XII, their very first. He earned Pro Bowl honors {{and was named}} first team All-Pro. Gradishar anchored a defense that led the AFC in fewest points allowed (148 in the 14-game season) and gave up the 6th fewest yards. Gradishar was also voted the AFC Defensive Player of the Year by the Columbus Touchdown Club. The 1977 Broncos season is documented <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>book</b> by Terry Frei, 77: Denver, the Broncos, and a Coming of Age that features Gradishar, Lyle Alzado and others. The 1977 Broncos season began with a 7–0 shutout of the St. Louis Cardinals that {{had been one of}} the NFL's top offenses from 1974–1976 that featured offensive stars like Jim Hart, Terry Metcalf, Mel Gray, Dan Dierdorf and Conrad Dobler. In a 14–7 win against the Kansas City Chiefs the Broncos made a goal line stand as time expired to preserve a win. Denver Post staff writer Terry Frei's book, 77: Denver, the Broncos, and a Coming of Age, put it this way, [...] "Gradishar penetrated and stopped two running plays, as Gradishar did time and time again on the goal line in his career. It was the trademark of both Gradishar and the defense overall".|$|E

6000|$|... 'There is a vulgar view of {{politics}} which sinks {{them into a}} mere struggle of interests and parties, {{and there is a}} foppish kind of history which aims only at literary display, which produces delightful books hovering between poetry and prose. These perversions, according to me, come from an unnatural divorce between two subjects which belong to one another. Politics are vulgar when they are not liberalised by history, and history fades into mere literature when it loses sight of its relation to practical politics.' These very just remarks are made by Mr. Seeley <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>book</b> which everybody has been reading, and which is an extremely interesting example of that union {{of politics}} with history which its author regards as so useful or even indispensable for the successful prosecution of either history or politics. His lectures on the expansion of England contain a suggestive and valuable study of two great movements in our history, one of them the expansion of the English nation and state together by means of colonies; the other, the stranger expansion by which the vast population of India has passed under the rule of Englishmen. Mr. Seeley has in his new volume recovered his singularly attractive style and power of literary form. It underwent some obscuration in the three volumes in which the great transformation of Germany and Prussia during the Napoleonic age was not very happily grouped round a biography of Stein. But here the reader once more finds that ease, lucidity, persuasiveness, and mild gravity that were first shown, as they were probably first acquired, in the serious consideration of religious and ethical subjects. Mr. Seeley's aversion for the florid, rhetorical, and over-decorated fashion of writing history has not carried him to the opposite extreme, but it has made him seek sources of interest, where alone the serious student of human affairs would care to find them, in the magnitude of events, the changes of the fortunes of states, and the derivation of momentous consequences from long chains of antecedent causes.|$|E
6000|$|... § XXVIII. But our higher {{instincts}} are not deceived. We take no {{pleasure in the}} building provided for us, resembling that which we take <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>book</b> or a new picture. We may be proud of its size, complacent in its correctness, and happy in its convenience. We may take the same pleasure in its symmetry and workmanship as in a well-ordered room, or a skilful piece of manufacture. And this we suppose to be all the pleasure that architecture was ever intended to give us. The idea of reading a building as we would read Milton or Dante, and getting {{the same kind of}} delight out of the stones as out of the stanzas, never enters our minds for a moment. And for good reason:--There is indeed rhythm in the verses, quite as strict as the symmetries or rhythm of the architecture, and a thousand times more beautiful, but there is something else than rhythm. The verses were neither made to order, nor to match, as the capitals were; and we have therefore a kind of pleasure in them other than a sense of propriety. But it requires a strong effort of common sense to shake ourselves quit of all that we have been taught for the last two centuries, and wake to the perception of a truth just as simple and certain as it is new: that great art, whether expressing itself in words, colors, or stones, does not say {{the same thing over and}} over again; that the merit of architectural, as of every other art, consists in its saying new and different things; that to repeat itself is no more a characteristic of genius in marble than it is of genius in print; and that we may, without offending any laws of good taste, require of an architect, as we do of a novelist, that he should be not only correct, but entertaining.|$|E
6000|$|True romantic art, again, makes {{a romance}} of all things. It {{reaches into the}} highest {{abstraction}} of the ideal; it does not refuse the most pedestrian realism. [...] "Robinson Crusoe" [...] is as realistic as it is romantic; both qualities are pushed to an extreme, and neither suffers. Nor does romance depend upon the material importance of the incidents. To deal with strong and deadly elements, banditti, pirates, war and murder, is to conjure with great names, and, {{in the event of}} failure, to double the disgrace. The arrival of Haydn and Consuelo at the Canon's villa is a very trifling incident; yet we may read a dozen boisterous stories from beginning to end, and not receive so fresh and stirring an impression of adventure. It was the scene of Crusoe at the wreck, if I remember rightly, that so bewitched my blacksmith. Nor is the fact surprising.
