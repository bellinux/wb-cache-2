40|$|In {{this thesis}} we {{introduce}} {{a method of}} storing static <b>text</b> <b>data,</b> and algorithms for operations on the data, in a relational database programming language. We introduce a <b>text</b> <b>data</b> type, and implement relational algebra operations on the <b>text</b> <b>data</b> type. Our method stores the <b>text</b> <b>data</b> in <b>text</b> files external to the relations, and maintains pointers to the <b>text</b> <b>data</b> within the relations. Our algorithms minimize accesses to the actual <b>text</b> <b>data</b> so as to maintain the efficiency of database operations. We also implement a text processing mechanism where a text script can be joined to a relation, producing an individualized text script for each tuple in the relation. Our implementation includes queries involving pattern searches within text attribute values. All operations on <b>text</b> <b>data</b> are relational algebra operations, requiring the <b>text</b> <b>data</b> to be in relations, and returning relations as results...|$|R

Colors {{are used to}} signify different entity types based on a palette used by Axis Maps in commercially sold Typographic Maps. Abstract—We present a method for automatically building typographic maps that <b>merge</b> <b>text</b> and spatial <b>data</b> into a visual representation where text alone forms the graphical features. We further show how to use this approach to visualize spatial data such as traffic density, crime rate, or demographic data. The technique accepts a vector representation of a geographic map and spatializes the textual labels in the space onto polylines and polygons based on user-defined visual attributes and constraints. Our sample implementation runs as a Web service, spatializing shape files from the OpenStreetMap project into typographic maps for any region. Index Terms—Geovisualization, spatial <b>data,</b> <b>text</b> visualization, label placement. ...|$|R
