5|$|From its {{headwaters}} <b>downstream</b> to the downstream-most {{crossing of}} the Scranton/Moosic line, the drainage basin of Stafford Meadow Brook is designated as a High-Quality Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. From that point <b>downstream</b> to its mouth, the stream is classified as a Warmwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. A large section of the stream from its headwaters to the lower Pennsylvania Route 307 bridge meets the criteria for an Exceptional Value designation. Wild trout naturally reproduce in the stream {{at least as far}} upstream as river mile 6.82 and as far <b>downstream</b> as its mouth. The stream was stocked with 500 adult and fingerling rainbow trout in 1894–1895. In 1984, the Pennsylvania Fish Commission speculated that there were native brook trout in part of the stream.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, {{the habitat}} quality of upper Fishing Creek {{and its tributaries}} were rated {{on a scale of}} 1 to 200 (with a higher rating {{indicating}} better habitability) by Point Park University and the Fishing Creek Sportsmans' Association. The headwaters of West Creek were given a rating of 192. The rating is significantly lower further <b>downstream,</b> with it being 175 <b>downstream</b> of the crossing of Pennsylvania Route 239. The rating averages 138 where the creek is in Benton and the lowest rating is 115. This rating occurred <b>downstream</b> of the Market Street bridge in Benton.|$|E
5|$|Messers Run is {{infertile}} and acidic upstream of the Lofty Reservoir. The stream has {{the potential}} to be affected by acid precipitation in this part of it. The stream also has these attributes from the Lofty Reservoir <b>downstream</b> to the Blue Head Reservoir and from the Blue Head Reservoir <b>downstream</b> to the mouth.|$|E
5|$|Some hydrologists expect <b>downstream</b> riverbanks {{to become}} more {{vulnerable}} to flooding.|$|E
5|$|The Gunnison River is {{designated}} as a Gold Medal Water from 200 yards <b>downstream</b> of Crystal Reservoir Dam to the North Fork. This includes the 12 miles within the Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park. Only artificial flies and lures are permitted, and all rainbow trout are catch and release. Additionally, fishing is prohibited within 200 yards <b>downstream</b> of Crystal Dam.|$|E
5|$|The River Kennet is navigable from Newbury <b>downstream</b> to the {{confluence}} with the River Thames at Kennet Mouth, in Reading.|$|E
5|$|The dam {{discharges}} its reservoir {{during the}} dry season between December and March every year. This increases the flow rate of the river <b>downstream,</b> and provides fresh water for agricultural and industrial usage. It also improves shipping conditions. The water level upstream drops from 175m to 145m, preparing for the rainy season. The water also powers the Gezhouba Dam <b>downstream.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{drainage}} basin of Spring Brook is {{designated as a}} High-Quality Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery from its headwaters <b>downstream</b> to the Northeast Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike (Interstate 476). From that point <b>downstream</b> to its mouth, the {{drainage basin}} of the stream is designated as a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. Wild trout naturally reproduce in Spring Brook from its headwaters <b>downstream</b> to its mouth. A 2.4-mile (4-kilometer) section of the stream from the Watres Dam <b>downstream</b> to the Nesbitt Reservoir is considered by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission to be Class A Wild Trout Waters for both brook trout and brown trout. The tributaries Green Run and Panther Creek are Class A Wild Trout Waters for brook trout {{and part of the}} tributary Rattlesnake Creek is Class A Wild Trout Waters for both brook trout and brown trout.|$|E
5|$|The next tributaries of Catawissa Creek going <b>downstream</b> are Dark Run and Little Catawissa Creek. Dark Run {{is close}} to four miles long and flows into Catawissa Creek from the southwest. Little Catawissa Creek is {{approximately}} ten miles long and flows into Catawissa Creek from the west, {{less than a mile}} <b>downstream</b> from Dark Run. Little Catawissa Creek starts near Centralia and passes by Ringtown.|$|E
5|$|Tomhicken Creek is {{the next}} {{tributary}} of Catawissa Creek flowing <b>downstream.</b> It has a few tributaries, including Raccoon Creek and Sugarloaf Creek. Approximately two miles <b>downstream</b> of Tomhicken Creek, Crooked Run, Cranberry Run and Klingerman's Run join Catawissa Creek from the south about 2 to 3 miles apart.|$|E
5|$|A {{party from}} the Anglican Church Missionary Society (CMS) arrived the same month, but {{decided it was}} not {{suitable}} for a base and instead located the mission <b>downstream</b> at Bor.|$|E
5|$|AT may {{not have}} {{anticipated}} the <b>downstream</b> effects of iPhone customers' high data usage. As a result, AT call centers were flooded with complaints {{about the size of}} the bills.|$|E
5|$|Above {{the swamp}} on Twomile Run, the {{discharge}} of the stream is 511 gallons per minute. Upstream of Middle Branch Twomile Run, the discharge is 618 gallons per minute and <b>downstream</b> of Robbins Hollow, the discharge is 1402 gallons per minute. <b>Downstream</b> of the sampling site KC121, the discharge is 1893 gallons per minute and upstream of Huling Branch, the discharge is 2258 gallons per minute. The discharge {{at the mouth of}} Twomile Run ranges from 200 to 10,000 gallons per minute, which is between 0.6 and 2 percent of {{the discharge of}} Kettle Creek.|$|E
5|$|After DNA damage, {{cell cycle}} checkpoints are activated. Checkpoint {{activation}} pauses the cell cycle {{and gives the}} cell time {{to repair the damage}} before continuing to divide. DNA damage checkpoints occur at the G1/S and G2/M boundaries. An intra-S checkpoint also exists. Checkpoint activation is controlled by two master kinases, ATM and ATR. ATM responds to DNA double-strand breaks and disruptions in chromatin structure, whereas ATR primarily responds to stalled replication forks. These kinases phosphorylate <b>downstream</b> targets in a signal transduction cascade, eventually leading to cell cycle arrest. A class of checkpoint mediator proteins including BRCA1, MDC1, and 53BP1 has also been identified. These proteins seem to be required for transmitting the checkpoint activation signal to <b>downstream</b> proteins.|$|E
5|$|After the two split up, Fitzgerald ambushes {{and kills}} Henry. Glass uses Henry's corpse {{on his horse}} as a decoy and shoots Fitzgerald in the arm. He pursues Fitzgerald to a {{riverbank}} where they engage in a brutal fight. Glass is about to kill Fitzgerald, but spots a band of Arikara <b>downstream.</b> He remembers Hikuc's words and pushes Fitzgerald <b>downstream</b> {{into the hands of}} the Arikara. The chief kills and scalps Fitzgerald and the Arikara spare Glass. Heavily wounded, Glass retreats into the mountains where he is visited by the spirit of his wife.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 19th {{century the}} main {{industries}} were tobacco and cigarette manufacture, led by the dominant W.D. & H.O. Wills company, paper and engineering. The port facilities were migrating <b>downstream</b> to Avonmouth and new industrial complexes were founded there.|$|E
5|$|Bristol Harbour was the {{original}} Port of Bristol, but as ships and their cargo have increased in size, it has now largely been replaced by docks at Avonmouth and Portbury. These are located 7miles (11.3km) <b>downstream</b> {{at the mouth of}} the River Avon.|$|E
5|$|Crossings of the Kootenay River {{are listed}} from {{upstream}} to <b>downstream.</b> The {{name of the}} road/track, the coordinates, and the location are given.|$|E
5|$|Damming of the Canning caused {{dramatic}} flow reductions {{that significantly}} altered <b>downstream</b> aquatic macroinvertebrate communities. The {{lack of water}} flow has also resulted in a poor flushing effect below the dam wall. An excessive amount of nutrients from fertilizers and animal waste has caused algal blooms and eutrophication.|$|E
5|$|<b>Downstream</b> of Germania Branch's {{confluence}} with Kettle Creek, {{the latter}} creek's banks {{have a tendency}} to be high on one side and low on the other side.|$|E
5|$|During {{the storm}} of 10 July 1968, the lake gained an extra 471millionimperial gallons (2,140,000m³) and rose 19inches (480mm) in under 12hours. At one point worried Bristol police issued a warning that the dam might not hold, {{prompting}} localised evacuation of populated valley areas <b>downstream</b> including Pensford and Keynsham.|$|E
5|$|Harveys Creek {{begins in}} Harveys Lake in the {{community}} of Harveys Lake. The creek flows southwest and soon enters Lake Township. A short distance <b>downstream,</b> it picks up the tributary Bear Hollow Creek and turns south for several miles. The creek receives the tributary Paint Spring Run during this stretch. It eventually enters Lehman Township and turns southeast, crossing Pennsylvania Route 118. Slightly more than a mile (two kilometers) <b>downstream,</b> the creek turns south again. It eventually enters Jackson Township, where it crosses Pennsylvania Route 29 and picks up the tributary Pikes Creek. It then turns southeast and enters a valley, where it flows roughly parallel to Pennsylvania Route 29 for a number of miles. The creek enters Plymouth Township and soon afterwards turns abruptly southwest. Several miles <b>downstream</b> it enters the community of West Nanticoke. Here, it crosses U.S. Route 11 and reaches its confluence with the Susquehanna River.|$|E
5|$|In 1975, a {{study found}} no fish {{species on the}} creek. However, brook trout have been {{observed}} at seven locations on Solomon Creek. Brook trout are especially common on the tributary Sugar Notch Run. Trout reproduce everywhere in the tributary Pine Creek and reproduce in the main stem as far <b>downstream</b> as southern Wilkes-Barre. Above of the South Wilkes-Barre borehole, {{a number of other}} fish species have been observed. These include eastern blacknose dace, bluegill, creek chub, fallfish, minnows, northern hog sucker, and white sucker. However, there are no species of fish <b>downstream</b> of the borehole. Out of 46 sites on the creek, 30 had sufficient macroinvertebrate concentrations to support trout. 2.6 stream miles in the watershed are home to brook trout fisheries. This area is in Hanover Township, Laurel Run, and Bear Creek Township.|$|E
5|$|In 2015 {{a common}} grey seal {{found its way}} from the Wash up the river and spent a few weeks {{sleeping}} in gardens next to the river in Deeping St James. The seal was spotted further <b>downstream</b> in Spalding as it eventually made its {{way back to the}} sea.|$|E
5|$|In {{southern}} Scott Township, Hull Creek is {{flanked by}} native trees and understory. However, further <b>downstream,</b> in Blakely, {{there is virtually no}} riparian buffer. Beyond this reach, the creek's riparian buffer again contains native trees and understory.|$|E
5|$|In {{the other}} direction, between Kehl and the Schutter, which lay <b>downstream,</b> the fortifications were equally secured. The redoubt there held about 8 cannons and 400 men, {{and covered the}} street between the hamlet of Auenheim and Kehl.|$|E
5|$|In this {{championship}} {{version of}} the game, a finish line is set up farther <b>downstream</b> {{and the winner is}} the first to pass this point. The competition originally took place every January, but it was moved to March due to icy weather in 1997.|$|E
5|$|Mongalla or Mangalla is a {{community}} in Jubek State in South Sudan, {{on the east side}} of the Bahr al Jebel or White Nile river. It lies about 75km by road northeast of Juba. The towns of Terekeka and Bor lie <b>downstream,</b> north of Mongalla.|$|E
5|$|Plans {{to build}} a new bridge at The Narrows <b>downstream</b> from the Causeway in the {{aftermath}} of World War II were put on hold while a new Causeway could be constructed. Vehicle traffic using the Causeway had almost doubled between 1930 and 1939.|$|E
5|$|Shortly <b>downstream</b> of the {{confluence}} of Catawissa Creek with Messers Run, the pH of Catawissa Creek ranges between 4.1 and 6.2, {{with an average of}} 4.5. Further <b>downstream,</b> at Davis Run, the pH changes to 4.5 to 4.9, and averages 4.64. After picking up Rattling Run, Dark Run, and Little Catawissa Creek, but before picking up Tomhicken Creek, Catawissa Creek's pH ranges from 3.2 to 6.4 and averages 4.96. After {{the confluence}} with Tomhicken Creek, Catawissa Creek's pH ranges from 4.7 to 5.4.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the filling}} of the {{reservoir}} in 2003, the Three Gorges Dam has supplied an extra 11cubic kilometres {{of fresh water}} to <b>downstream</b> cities and farms during the dry season.|$|E
5|$|Soils in {{the river}} and its basin reflect past {{glaciation}} in the area. Glacial till covers much of the river bottom in its headwaters. Further <b>downstream</b> there is stratified drift and alluvium in the sediments.|$|E
5|$|The Berwick Axis, {{which is}} also known as the Montour Axis, crosses the Susquehanna River half a mile <b>downstream</b> of the mouth of Little Wapwallopen Creek. There is {{concealed}} Marcellus shale near the creek in Hollenback Township.|$|E
5|$|The John Day River, a {{tributary}} of the Columbia River, flows generally west from the Strawberry Mountains before reaching the national monument. It turns sharply north between the Mascall Formation Overlook and Kimberly, where the North Fork John Day River joins the main stem. <b>Downstream</b> of Kimberly, the river flows generally west to <b>downstream</b> of the unincorporated community of Twickenham, and generally north thereafter. Rock Creek enters the river {{at the north end of}} Picture Gorge. Bridge Creek passes through Mitchell, then north along the eastern edge of the Painted Hills Unit to meet the John Day <b>downstream</b> of Twickenham. Intermittent streams in the Clarno Unit empty into Pine Creek, which flows just beyond the south edge of the unit and enters the John Day upstream of the unincorporated community of Clarno.|$|E
