5|$|Before the 2001–02 season began, Salo {{injured his}} groin in an {{exhibition}} game against the Toronto Maple Leafs in September. In addition to missing the first three games of the season, he was later sidelined {{for a total of}} 13 more contests due to separate cases of the flu, a broken <b>finger</b> <b>and</b> back spasms. He recorded 18 points in 66 games. In the proceeding off-season, Salo underwent shoulder surgery. Becoming a free agent, he accepted an $880,000 qualifying offer from the Senators on 31 July 2002. Nearly two months later, he was traded to the Vancouver Canucks in exchange for forward Peter Schaefer on 21 September.|$|E

This attraction is most commonly expressed with fingering, handjobs, sucking on the <b>fingers</b> <b>and</b> licking the palms. <b>Fingering</b> <b>and</b> Handjobs are an extremely common sexual act, so are not always linked to hand fetishism.

40|$|Aim. To {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} alpha-fetoprotein <b>and</b> zinc <b>fingers</b> <b>and</b> homeoboxes 2 in hepatocellular carcinoma. Materials and Methods. The expressions of zinc <b>fingers</b> <b>and</b> homeoboxes 2, nuclear factor-YA, and alpha-fetoprotein mRNA in 63 hepatocellular carcinoma were detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and compared with the clinical parameters of the patients. Selectively, silence of zinc <b>fingers</b> <b>and</b> homeoboxes 2 in HepG 2 cells was detected by RNA interference technique. Results. Alpha-fetoprotein mRNA expression was detected in 60. 3 % of hepatocellular carcinoma cases. Zinc <b>fingers</b> <b>and</b> homeoboxes 2 mRNA expression (36. 5 %) was significantly negatively correlated with serum alpha-fetoprotein concentration and mRNA expression. A strong positive correlation was found between zinc <b>fingers</b> <b>and</b> homeoboxes 2 and nuclear factor-YA mRNA expression (42. 9 %), while the latter was negatively correlated with serum alpha-fetoprotein concentration and mRNA expression. Treatment with zinc <b>fingers</b> <b>and</b> homeoboxes 2 small interfering RNA led to 85 % and 83 % silence of zinc <b>fingers</b> <b>and</b> homeoboxes 2 mRNA and protein expression and 60 % and 61 % reduction of nuclear factor-YA mRNA and protein levels in the HepG 2 cells, respectively. Downregulation of zinc <b>fingers</b> <b>and</b> homeoboxes 2 also induced a 2. 4 -fold increase in both alpha-fetoprotein mRNA and protein levels. Conclusions. Zinc <b>fingers</b> <b>and</b> homeoboxes 2 can regulate alpha-fetoprotein expression via the interaction with nuclear factor-YA in human hepatocellular carcinoma and {{may be used as}} an adjuvant diagnostic marker for alpha-fetoprotein-negative hepatocellular carcinoma...|$|R

This gene encodes member 2 of this gene family. In addition to forming homodimers, this protein heterodimerizes with member 1 of the zinc <b>fingers</b> <b>and</b> homeoboxes family.|$|R

Gilligan played in a career-high 82 games, while also recording career highs in RBI (38), strikeouts (41), and on-base percentage (.325) and leading MLB in defensive games as a catcher (81). After finishing {{at the top of the}} NL, the Grays played in the 1884 World Series against the New York Metropolitans of the American Association.

5|$|The {{most common}} {{presenting}} sign is a coarse slow tremor {{of the hand}} at rest which disappears during voluntary movement of the affected arm and in the deeper stages of sleep.

A feature of tremor is pill-rolling, the tendency of the index <b>finger</b> <b>and</b> thumb to touch and perform together a circular movement. The term derives from the similarity between the movement of people with PD and the early pharmaceutical technique of manually making pills.|$|E

Johnston's inclusion at the expense of McCool was the only difference between the team for the First Test and those against Worcestershire and the MCC.

However, one of three good fairies named Merryweather alters the curse so that Aurora will instead sleep until she is awoken by a kiss from her true love. Merryweather and the two other fairies, Flora and Fauna, take extra precautions by raising the princess in a secluded cottage under the alias Briar Rose {{to protect her from}} Maleficent until her birthday arrives. Several years later, a 16-year-old Aurora meets a handsome man in the forest. Unaware that he is actually a prince named Phillip, to whom she has been betrothed since infancy, the two fall in love and agree to meet again. However, the fairies finally reveal Aurora's true identity to her and thus forbid her from seeing him because they plan on returning the heartbroken princess to her parents. While alone at their castle, Aurora is hypnotized by Maleficent, who causes her to prick her <b>finger</b> <b>and</b> fulfill Merryweather's prophecy.
