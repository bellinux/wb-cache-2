Pregnancy results in major changes in a girl's life, physically, emotionally, socially and economically and jeopardises her transition into adulthood. Adolescent pregnancy, more often than not, stems from a girl's lack of choices. or abuse. Child marriage (see below) is a major contributor worldwide, since 90% of births to girls aged 15–19 occur within marriage.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Human {{resources}} in <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>system</b> in sub-Saharan Africa are generally picturing {{a lack of}} adequacy between expected skills from the professionals and <b>health</b> <b>care</b> needs expressed by the populations. It is, however, possible to analyse these various lacks of adequacy related to human resource management and their determinants to enhance {{the effectiveness of the}} <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>system.</b> From two projects focused on nurse professionals within the <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>system</b> in Central Africa, we present an analytic grid for adequacy levels looking into the following aspects: - adequacy between skills-based profiles for health system professionals, quality of care and service delivery (<b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>system</b> /medical standards), needs and expectations from the populations, - adequacy between allocation of health system professionals, quality of care and services delivered (<b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>system</b> /medical standards), needs and expectations from the populations, - adequacy between human resource management within <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>system</b> and medical standards, - adequacy between human resource management within education/teaching/training and needs from <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>system</b> and education sectors, - adequacy between basic and on-going education and realities of tasks expected and implemented by different categories of professionals within the <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>system</b> body, - adequacy between intentions for initial and on-going trainings and teaching programs in health sciences for trainers (teachers/supervisors/health <b>care</b> <b>system</b> professionals/ directors (teaching managers) of schools [...] .). This tool is necessary for decision-makers as well as for <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>system</b> professionals who share common objectives for changes at each level of intervention within the health system. Setting this adequacy implies interdisciplinary and participative approaches for concerned actors in order to provide an overall vision of a more broaden system than health district, small island with self-rationality, and in which they operate. </p...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{theoretical}} {{literature on the}} demand for private health insurance {{and its effect on}} the use of <b>health</b> <b>care</b> services and applies the theoretical framework to the type of private health insurance that exists alongside a universal <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>system.</b> The predominant share of the theoretical literature on private health insurance is developed to model private health insurance in settings where this provides the primary source of coverage and the choice is between purchasing private health insurance and going uninsured. This type of private health insurance is termed principal private health insurance in the following. Private health insurance that co-exists with a universal <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>system</b> may be classified as complementary, supplementary or duplicate in relation to the universal <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>system</b> based on its coverage.

The {{objective}} of the research was to present the model of future <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>system</b> revenues and expenditures in Poland and to discuss projection assumptions and results. The projections are based on methodology adopted in the International Labour Organization (ILO) Social Budget model. The projection examines impact of demographic changes and changes in health status on future (up to 2050) health expenditures. Next to it, future changes in the labour market participation and their impact on the <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>system</b> revenues are examined. Impact of demography on the <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>system</b> financial balanced is examined in four different scenarios: baseline scenario, death-related costs scenario, different longevity scenario and diversified employment rates scenario. Results indicate dynamic and systematic increase of the health expenditures in the next 30 years. Afterwards the dynamics of this process is foreseen to slow down. Despite the increase of the revenues of the <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>system,</b> the system will face deficit in the close future. This holds for each scenario, however the size of the deficit differs depending on longevity and labour market participation assumptions.
