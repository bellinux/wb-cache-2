5|$|Bristol has a {{long history}} of trade, {{originally}} exporting wool cloth and importing fish, wine, grain and dairy products; later imports were tobacco, tropical fruits and plantation goods. Major imports are motor vehicles, grain, timber, produce and petroleum products.

5|$|After {{years of}} piping raw sewage {{directly}} into the waterway, Portland built its first sewage treatment plant next to the lower slough in 1952.

5|$|Below Winsford, {{the course}} of the river has been altered several times, by the {{construction}} of cuts and locks, to enable small ships to trade on it.

5|$|Historically, most rain {{falling on}} the {{watershed}} was taken up by vegetation, <b>flowed</b> <b>into</b> wetlands, soaked into the ground, or evaporated. Heavy rain in the winter months recharged the groundwater and provided baseflows to the slough during dry summers. Urban development, which replaced vegetation and water-absorbing soils with airport runways, house roofs, highways, warehouses, parking lots, and other hard surfaces, interrupted this cycle. In 1999, a study estimated that impervious surfaces covered 54percent of the watershed. Storm runoff that might have taken days to reach the historic slough reaches the developed slough in hours.|$|E

Hiʻiaka is the goddess of dance and patroness of the Big Island of Hawaii, where the Mauna Kea Observatory is located.

5|$|A 1991 {{agreement}} between the City of Portland and the State of Oregon to dramatically reduce combined sewer overflows (CSOs) led to Portland's Big Pipe Project.

When that occurred, some of the raw sewage in the system <b>flowed</b> <b>into</b> the river instead of into the city's wastewater treatment plant. The Big Pipe project and related work reduces CSO volume on the lower river by about 94percent.|$|E

5|$|About 23 Ma, in the Pleistocene, {{continental}} ice sheets {{expanded from}} the polar {{regions of the}} globe to cover lower latitudes far north of the region, starting a series of cold glacial periods that were interrupted by warmer interglacial periods. Snowmelt from alpine glaciers on the nearby Sierra Nevada during glacial periods fed rivers that <b>flowed</b> <b>into</b> the valleys of the region year round. Since the topography of the Basin and Range region was largely formed by faulting, not by river erosion, many of the basins have no outlets, meaning they will fill up with water like a bathtub until they overflow into the next basin. So during the cooler and wetter pluvial climates of the glacial periods, much of eastern California, all of Nevada, and western Utah were covered by large lakes separated by linear islands (the present day ranges).|$|E

5|$|As {{the glaciers}} of the Wisconsin {{glaciation}} began to recede from the Hudson Valley area, a glacial lake {{known today as}} Lake Albany extended across the mid and upper Hudson Valley and a large delta formed west of Albany where the predecessor of the Mohawk River <b>flowed</b> <b>into</b> the lake. Along the shoreline of the lake, lacustrine sands were deposited between the present-day cities of Hudson and Glens Falls; this became the Hudson Valley sandplain. Relieved from {{the weight of the}} glacier, the land began to rebound, and the lake receded by draining into the Hudson River. The deposits of sand in the delta area were gradually sculpted by wind into sand dunes. Plants later colonized the land and stabilized the dunes.

Water from Lake Erie was pumped into two reservoirs on the peninsula, where particulates in the water were allowed to settle, removing them from the lake water.

In 1917 a pumphouse powered by a steam boiler and engine was built: this pumped the water from one basin into the other, then across Presque Isle Bay to Erie.
