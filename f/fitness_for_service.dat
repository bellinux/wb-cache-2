50|$|Finland has {{mandatory}} {{military service}} for men of a minimum duration {{of five and}} half months (165 days); depending on the assigned position: those trained as officers or NCOs serve for eleven and half months (347 days), specialist troops serve for eight and half (255 days) or eleven and half months, while rank and file serve for the minimum period. Unarmed service is also possible, and lasts eight and half months (270 days) or eleven and half (347 days). All males are required {{to participate in the}} drafting event (kutsunnat) in their municipality of domicile in the year that they turn 18. The <b>fitness</b> <b>for</b> <b>service</b> and the actual induction to the service then takes place at the time and place decided individually for each conscript during the drafting event. The induction takes place usually at the age of 19 but the allowed age range is 18 - 29. The delayed induction is permissible for serious personal reasons, such as studies, but induction cannot be delayed beyond 29. The military strives to accommodate the wishes of the future conscript when determining the time of induction and the duty location, but these are ultimately determined by the needs of service.|$|E

5|$|Racism, {{especially}} antisemitism, was {{a central}} feature of the regime. The Germanic peoples (the Nordic race) were considered by the Nazis to be the purest branch of the Aryan race and were therefore viewed as the master race. Millions of Jews and other peoples deemed undesirable by the state were murdered in the Holocaust. Opposition to Hitler's rule was ruthlessly suppressed. Members of the liberal, socialist and communist opposition were killed, imprisoned or exiled. Christian churches were also oppressed, with many leaders imprisoned. Education focused on racial biology, population policy, and <b>fitness</b> <b>for</b> military <b>service.</b> Career and educational opportunities for women were curtailed. Recreation and tourism were organised via the Strength Through Joy program and the 1936 Summer Olympics showcased the Third Reich on the international stage.

40|$|Zirconium alloy tubes act as {{miniature}} {{pressure vessels}} in Pressurized Heavy Water Reactors (PHWR) and {{are subjected to}} aqueous corrosion resulting in hydrogen pick up. Hydrogen exceeding solid solubility precipitates out as brittle hydride phase and may cause embrittlement of the host matrix.

It is of particular interest how military experience may affect ADHD in remission and if such individuals might be at elevated risk for relapse of ADHD symptoms. Method: We performed a systematic review f the available literature including the Department of Defense (DOD) guidelines for both eligibility to enlist and <b>fitness</b> <b>for</b> deployment based on reported history and current symptomatology of ADHD. Results: The after care for veterans with ADHD relapse is inconsistent and presents with number of challenges.

40|$|During {{operation}} under flow accelerated corrosion (FAC) favourable conditions, CANDU outlet feeder pipes experience {{general and}} local wall thinning. The wall thickness of such feeders is monitored {{as part of}} the life cycle management plans developed and used by the utilities. Thickness measurements of CANDU feeder bends are performed using a bracelet tool that has 14 probes equally spaced along the circumference covering a 140 o angle producing 4 sets of thickness data (Extrados, Intrados, Left Cheek, and Right Cheek). Close to the Grayloc hub weld, a 6 -probe tool is used producing two sets of thickness data for the extrados and intrados.

40|$|During the {{fabrication}} {{of two different}} structures (a ship, a bridge) some unacceptable anomalies were detected; the structures were almost completely fabricated and a repair of the defected structural details was impractical, due {{to the extent of}} the defected zones. As far as the ship was concerned the anomalies were represented by a large number of welded joints, judged unacceptable according to the Design and Fabrication Code, while {{in the case of the}} bridge, the anomalies were represented by planar flaws in the plates forming the girder web, subjected to outof-plane loads for effect of fillet welded connections of bracing. A <b>fitness</b> <b>for</b> <b>service</b> assessment has therefore been carried out, in both cases, by performing fatigue tests on representative samples, cut-off from the structure, and by evaluating the fatigue resistance curve.

40|$|Many {{advances}} in Non-Destructive Examination (NDE) {{have occurred in}} recent years. Some of these are becoming common in typical industry applications and are slowly migrating their way into niche industries, such as high-pressure applications. These advanced NDE techniques {{include the use of}} Linear Phased Array (LPA) ultrasonic examination for volumetric examination and Eddy Current Array (ECA) technology for surface examination. Advancements in ultrasonic Guided Wave Testing (GWT) also show promise for the examination of long tubes, such as in tubular low density polyethylene (LDPE) reactors. Effective deployment and delivery of these advanced techniques is critical to the collection and analysis of the inspection data. Common challenges found in high-pressure equipment include access issues such as small diameter deep bores, large and thick section components, weld overlays and examination of thick section welds, complex geometries, and small crack sizes required for detection due to materials and design. Applying these modern techniques in new designs and updating of in-service inspection plans for this high-pressure equipment can lead to a more accurate assessment of the equipment’s <b>fitness</b> <b>for</b> continued <b>service,</b> reduced maintenance costs, proper asset management of key capital equipment, and reduced turn-around time...|$|R

40|$|In {{this article}} we propose a {{discrete}} lattice model to simulate the elastic, plastic and failure behaviour of isotropic materials. Focus is given on the mathematical derivation of the lattice elements, nodes and edges, {{in the presence of}} plastic deformations and damage, i. e. stiffness degradation.
