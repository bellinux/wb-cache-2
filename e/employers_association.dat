25|$|The {{story of}} the Battle of Ballantyne Pier {{can be traced back}} to 1912 when the International Longshoremen’s Association (ILA), began {{organizing}} amongst waterfront workers in Canada, and alongside the Lumber Handlers’ Union in Vancouver. Going head to head with the <b>employers</b> <b>association,</b> the Shipping Federation, several strikes resulting in wage increases were won by workers in the coming years. Victories on the waterfront increased over the next decade, and by 1923 the Shipping Federation became determined to break the power of the ILA.|$|E
25|$|It {{was said}} that during {{the last half of}} the 19th century more of San Francisco's workers enjoyed an eight-hour workday than any other American city. The molders' and boilermakers' strike of 1864 was called in {{opposition}} to a newly formed iron-works <b>employers</b> <b>association</b> which threatened a one thousand dollar a day fine on any employer who granted the strikers' demands and had wired for strikebreakers across the country. The San Francisco Trades Union, the city's first central labor body, sent a delegation to meet a boatload of strikebreakers at Panama and educated them. They arrived in San Francisco as enrolled union members.|$|E

This <b>employers</b> <b>association</b> cut wages twice in one year, and the Metal Trades Council was defeated, losing an agreement that had been in effect since 1907.

40|$|Since the 1980 's, {{industrial}} relations structures and processes in Australia {{have been subject}} to significant changes, particularly {{in the direction of a}} greater focus upon productivity, flexibility and other issues at the workplace level. Australian <b>employer</b> <b>associations</b> have played an important role in these changes, often influencing if not leading the change process. <b>Employer</b> <b>associations</b> have themselves undergone significant changes in both their structure and functions in order to achieve needed change.

Indeed, their industrial relations activities defined them as <b>employer</b> <b>associations</b> within the meaning of relevant Acts and this article.

Scores of strikers were beaten or wounded by gunfire during the battle. During a coordinated {{raid on the}} union mess hall {{at the corner of}} Steuart and Mission, San Francisco Police shot and killed Howard Sperry, a striking sailor, and Nick Counderakis (AKA Nick Bordoise), member of the cook's union and a strike sympathizer helping out at the mess hall. Scores of other men were wounded by police gunfire as well, including a number of bystanders, as the ensuing battle quickly spilled into the nearby downtown area.|$|E
2500|$|In March 2004, AUT members took {{industrial}} action over {{the proposed new}} pay structures (the Framework Agreement) offered by the Universities and Colleges <b>Employers</b> <b>Association</b> (UCEA). The original proposals from UCEA would have meant large reductions in income due to smaller annual increments. The action involved a one-day national strike and one-day strikes {{in each of the}} four countries of the UK, followed by an assessment boycott that threatened to derail examinations that summer. [...] The {{industrial action}} lasted 25 days before UCEA gave in and agreed to many of the union's demands. The agreement included the so-called Memorandum of Understanding which provided certain safeguards on the way the new pay structures were to be implemented in pre 1992 universities. However the agreement did not cover post 1992 universities.|$|E
2500|$|In 2006 AUT and NATFHE {{engaged in}} {{industrial}} dispute with Universities and Colleges <b>Employers</b> <b>Association</b> (UCEA) over pay. AUT and NATFHE claimed that UCEA promised that {{one third of}} the extra income from top up fees would be spent on pay and their 2006 pay claim was based on this. UCEA's initial response was [...] "that it is very likely that a significant proportion of the HE sectors new income will be spent on improvements in staff pay and conditions, but that HEIs had never given a commitment". AUT and NATFHE both voted for strike action and carried out a one-day stoppage on 8 March. From 9 March to 6 June they boycotted the marking of exams and coursework, with the AUT (but not NATFHE) also boycotting the setting of exams and they rejected an offer of 12.6% over three years which was made on 8 May and a further offer of 13.12% over three years made on 30 May. Concerns grew that students {{might not be able to}} graduate in 2006 until the industrial action was suspended at midnight on 7 June while members were balloted on a new offer.|$|E
40|$|The free {{circulation}} {{of workers and}} services in the European Union after its latest enlargements has been believed to foster a ‘race to the bottom’ in wage standards. This paper explains the strategies of national <b>employer</b> <b>associations</b> towards labour market regulations geared to protect national wage standards {{in the context of}} labour mobility. First, this article shows that employers in non-tradable sectors confronted with strong trade unions support the regulation of wage standards in order to prevent foreign competitors from using lower wages as a competitive advantage. Second, the strategies of national <b>employer</b> <b>associations</b> (as protagonists, consenters or antagonists) are explained by sectoral power relationships within <b>employer</b> <b>associations,</b> trade union power resources and the risk of unilateral public intervention. A comparative case study analysis of regulation processes in Austria, Switzerland and Ireland shows that <b>employer</b> <b>associations</b> dominated by firms in non-tradable sectors are protagonists of wage regulation, while <b>employer</b> <b>associations</b> dominated by firms in tradable sectors consent to negotiate with trade unions about wage regulation in order to ensure labour acquiescence, or contain unilateral public intervention...|$|R

50|$|In September 2007, {{there was}} a fierce debate about the minimum wage for the post office {{employees}} in Germany. The trade union ver.di came to {{an agreement with the}} postal services <b>employer's</b> <b>association</b> for a collective agreement specifying a minimum wage of 8.00 - 9.80 euro per hour. This was strongly criticized by the private post office enterprises. Deutsche Post used its leadership in the <b>employer's</b> <b>association</b> of the postal services to dictate minimum wages, which did not allow the private post office enterprises to fairly compete.

40|$|This paper {{challenges}} the conventional explanation for declining density of German <b>employers</b> <b>associations.</b> The dominant account asserts that German trade unions {{have taken advantage}} of increased globalization since the 1980 s – which has made internationally active enterprises more vulnerable to production disruptions – to extract additional monopoly rents from multinational employers via aggressive collective bargaining. Small firms have responded to the- 1 -increased union pressures by avoiding membership <b>employers</b> <b>associations,</b> which has produced the density declines. Data, however, disconfirm the conventional explanation; compensation increases have actually become increasingly smaller over the decades. This paper presents an alternative explanation that is consistent with the data. We argue that it is the large product manufacturers rather than the trade unions that have greatly increased price pressures on parts suppliers, which has led to a disproportionate number of suppliers to quit <b>employers</b> <b>associations.</b> The paper also discusses these findings in light of the “varieties of capitalism ” literature. It points out that this literature has depicted national models as too homogeneous. The decision of several German <b>employers</b> <b>associations</b> to offer different classes of membership represents an accentuation of variety within national varieties of capitalism...|$|R

In developing the dominant theory of Australian <b>employer</b> <b>associations,</b> David Plowman has consistently argued that Australian <b>employers</b> developed permanent <b>associations</b> as a response to the introduction of compulsory arbitration. From this developed a history of reactive employer involvement within the arbitration sys-tem. By linking association formation with the introduction of a unique system of compulsory arbitration, Plowman saw formal employer combination in Australia as exceptional as well as reactionary. This paper challenges the reactivity thesis by subjecting a number of Plowman’s key assumptions to historiographic and comparative scrutiny. First. permanent associations, whether organized on a trade, industry or state basis. existed before the advent of arbitration. Second, the increase in <b>employer</b> <b>association</b> formation and activity that occurred around the turn of the century can only partly be attributed to the introduction of compulsory arbitration.
