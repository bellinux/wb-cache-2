When he and Donna return to where the TARDIS landed, he discovers that a local merchant sold it to sculptor Lobus Caecilius. The Doctor and Donna go to Caecilius's house to retrieve it.

He thinks she is asking for a raise and attempts to negotiate salary, but she tells him {{it is not about}} money. She holds back tears as he kisses her hand. She walks out of the office and smiles as she waits for an elevator.|$|E

25|$|Finally, {{a relief}} showing {{starving}} Bedouins was unearthed, {{which is very}} similar to the one from the pyramid of Unas.

Jonang is particularly important in that it has preserved the Kālacakra practice lineage, especially of the completion stage practices. In fact, the Kālacakra is the main tantric practice in the Jonang tradition. Khenpo Kunga Sherab Rinpoche is one contemporary Jonangpa master of Kālacakra.|$|E
25|$|The Epistle to a Friend {{concerning}} Poetry {{is neither}} startling nor contemptible; it <b>has,</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact,</b> {{much more to}} say than the rhymed treatises on verse by Roscommon and Buckinghamshire. Its remarks on Genius are fresh, though tantalizing in their brevity, and it defends the Moderns with both neatness and energy. Much of its advice is cautious and commonplace—but such was {{the tradition of the}} poetical treatise on verse. Appearing within two years of Collier's first attack upon the stage, it reinforces some of that worthy's contentions, but we are not aware of its having had much effect.|$|E

Canon 915 thus does not apply in cases of undeclared latae sententiae (automatic) excommunication, such as that incurred, according to canon 1398, by someone who actually procures an abortion. While someone in this situation should not receive Communion until the excommunication is lifted, a priest may not {{on the grounds of}} the automatic excommunication refuse to administer the sacrament even if he knows of its existence.|$|E
