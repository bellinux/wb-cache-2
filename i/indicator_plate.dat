40|$|We have {{developed}} an <b>indicator</b> <b>plate</b> that works well for diverse types of substrates and microorganisms. The plates are inexpensive and easy to prepare. The essential components are agar, buffer, growth-supporting nutrients, a test substrate, and 2, 3, 5 -triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC). Using various strains of Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli, we have studied and defined the contribution of each component to the satisfactory function of the plate. Colonies capable of catabolizing the test substrate reduce TTC and produce a deep red formazan, whereas colonies failing to catabolize the substrate remain uncoloured. Those with intermediate rates of catabolism differ in rate and/or extent of color formation. In all cases the color is stable because TTC reduction is essentially irreversible. Since the mode of action of these plates is fairly well understood, alternative formulations can be devised to meet specific needs. The general applicability of this TTC indicator system makes it an extremely useful tool in microbial genetics, metabolism, and taxonomy...|$|E
40|$|Experimental clostridial myonecrosis closely {{resembling}} {{gas gangrene}} {{was produced in}} goats by the intramuscular injection of washed clostridia suspended in adrenalin. The preparation provides {{a model for the}} study of clostridial myonecrosis that is relatively isolated from preceding trauma. A new test for the demonstration of clostridial exotoxins, the hemolysin <b>indicator</b> <b>plate</b> test, was described. This test gave reliable results within 6 hr, and only minute quantities of test material were required. Application of this test to would exudates of goats with experimental clostridial myonecrosis demonstrated the presence of the γ toxin of Clostridium novyi, α toxin of C. septicum, and the α toxin of C. perfringens in exudates from animals injected with washed Clostridium bacilli suspended in adrenalin. Exudates from goats injected with C. perfringens were lethal for mice and produced necrosis of guinea pig skin typical of C. perfringens. The convincing demonstration of clostridial exotoxins formed in vivo in this experimental model could be the basis for definition of clostridial exotoxin actions which have evaded study in the past...|$|E

40|$|The gene which encodes alcohol {{dehydrogenase}} II (adhB) from Zymomonas mobilis was cloned in Escherichia coli as a 1. 4 -kilobase DNA fragment {{by using a}} novel <b>indicator</b> <b>plate</b> which directly detects the expression of this activity by recombinant colonies. The DNA sequence for this clone contained an open reading frame encoding a polypeptide of 383 amino acids, with a molecular weight of 40, 141. Although this protein exhibited very little homology with other known {{alcohol dehydrogenase}}s, the predicted amino acid composition was in excellent agreement with that reported for the purified alcohol dehydrogenase II protein from Z. mobilis. In Z. mobilis, the adhB gene was transcribed from tandem promoters which were separated by 100 base pairs and ended with a transcriptional terminator (13 -base-pair palindrome). In Escherichia coli, {{only one of the}} Z. mobilis promoters was used, despite apparent similarity to the enteric consensus promoter. The adhB gene was transcribed at low levels in E. coli from the P 2 promoter of Z. mobilis but was expressed well in E. coli under control of the lac promoter (approximately 0. 25 % of the total cell protein) ...|$|E

Enzyme libraries were created in Escherichia coli, transfected into Bacillus subtilis 168 by an electroporation method and expressed. The transfected library was screened using a Rhodamine B plate containing olive-oil and a phenol-red pH <b>indicator</b> <b>plate</b> containing glyceryl tricaprylate as substrates. One lipase variant, M 58, which has five amino acid (S 21 F, 102 G, S 103 F, D 299 E and N 300 H) mutations, was selected and characterized. The acyl chain-length selectivity of the in vitro expressed lipases against various p-nitrophenyl (p-NP) monoesters were compared by their relative hydrolysis rates. The result showed that lipase mutant M 58 increased its selectivity for the short-C 2 and C 4 and the long-chain esters, C 10, C 12, C 14 and C 16, but decreased its selectivity for the middle-chain esters, C 6 and C 8. Wild-type and M 58 lipases had been expressed in the presence and absence of its lipase-specific foldase (lif) in B. subtilis 168 and relative activity was measured. As a result, the activities o...|$|E
40|$|We have {{developed}} a dual reporter screen in Escherichia coli for identifying variants of the Flp site-specific recombinase that have acquired reactivity at an altered target site (mFRT). In one reporter, the lacZalpha gene segment is flanked by mFRTs in direct orientation. In the other, the red fluorescence protein (RFP) gene is flanked by the native FRTs. Hence, {{the color of a}} colony on an X-gal <b>indicator</b> <b>plate</b> indicates the recombination potential of the variant Flp protein expressed in it: blue if no recombination or only FRT recombination occurs, red if only mFRT recombination occurs and white if both FRT and mFRT recombinations occur. The scheme was validated by identification and in vivo characterization of Flp variants that show either relaxed specificity (active on FRT and mFRT) or moderately shifted specificity toward mFRT. We find that alteration of Lys- 82 to Met, Thr, Arg or His enables the corresponding Flp variants to recombine FRT sites as well as altered FRT sites containing a substitution of G-C by C-G at position 1 of the Flp binding element (mFRT 11). In contrast, wild-type Flp has no detectable activity on mFRT 11. When Lys- 82 is replaced by Tyr, the resulting Flp variant shows a small but reproducible preference for mFRT 11 over FRT. However, this preference for mFRT 11 is nearly lost when Tyr- 82 is substituted by Phe...|$|E

40|$|The ABC {{transporter}} (TliDEF) from Pseudomonas fluorescens SIK W 1, which mediated the secretion of a thermostable lipase (TliA) {{into the}} extracellular space in Escherichia coli, was engineered using directed evolution (error-prone PCR) {{to improve its}} secretion efficiency. TliD mutants with increased secretion efficiency were identified by coexpressing the mutated tliD library with the wild-type tliA lipase in E. coli and by screening the library with a tributyrin-emulsified <b>indicator</b> <b>plate</b> assay and a microtiter plate-based assay. Four selected mutants from one round of error-prone PCR mutagenesis, T 6, T 8, T 24, and T 35, showed 3. 2 -, 2. 6 -, 2. 9 -, and 3. 0 -fold increases {{in the level of}} secretion of TliA lipase, respectively, but had almost the same level of expression of TliD in the membrane as the strain with the wild-type TliDEF transporter. These results indicated that the improved secretion of TliA lipase was mediated by the transporter mutations. Each mutant had a single amino acid change in the predicted cytoplasmic regions in the membrane domain of TliD, implying that the corresponding region of TliD was important for the improved and successful secretion of the target protein. We therefore concluded that the efficiency of secretion of a heterologous protein in E. coli can be enhanced by in vitro engineering of the ABC transporter...|$|E
40|$|Mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{deficient}} in mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity were isolated by chemical mutagenesis with ethyl methanesulfonate. The mutants were selected by {{their inability to}} grow on ethanol as the sole carbon source. The ALDH mutants were distinguished from alcohol dehydrogenase mutants by an aldehyde <b>indicator</b> <b>plate</b> test and by immunoscreening. The ALDH gene was isolated from a yeast genomic DNA library on a 5. 7 -kb insert of a recombinant DNA plasmid by functional complementation of the aldh mutation in S. cerevisiae. An open reading frame which specifies 533 codons was found within the 2. 0 -kb BamHI-BstEII fragment in the 5. 7 -kb genomic insert which can encode a protein with a molecular weight of 58, 630. The N-terminal portion of the protein contains many positively charged residues which {{may serve as a}} signal sequence that targets the protein to the mitochondria. The amino acid sequence of the proposed mature yeast enzyme shows 30 % identity to each of the known ALDH sequences from eukaryotes or prokaryotes. The amino acid residues corresponding to mammalian cysteine 302 and glutamates 268 and 487, implicated to be involved at the active site, were conserved. S. cerevisiae ALDH was found to be localized in the mitochondria as a tetrameric enzyme. Thus, that organelle is responsible for acetaldehyde oxidation, as was found in mammalian liver...|$|E
40|$|The Myco{{bacteria}} are a genus {{of bacteria}} which are acid-fast, non-motile, grampositive rods. The genus comprises several species classified into three main groups. Firstly, the major group of these organisms, which poses the biggest threat, is the M. tuberculosis complex {{which can cause}} tuberculosis-like disease. These include M. bovis, M. africanum and M. microti. Members of the M. tuberculosis complex are {{not found in the}} environment. The second group is M. leprae which is the causative agent of leprosy. The last group constitutes the nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM), which are all the environmental mycobacteria that can cause various diseases resembling tuberculosis. Due to the importance of environmental mycobacteria, 15 mycobacteria isolates were isolated from environmental samples such as soil, water and drinking water biofilms. After PCR amplification of the hsp 65 gene using genus specific primers hsp 65, the isolates revealed sequences similarities when compared with the well characterized mycobacteria in the GenBank. Alignment of the nucleotide sequences and homology analysis were done with Clustall. It has been suggested that mycobacteria-associated phages (mycobacteriophages) may make an important contribution to the evolution of pathogenic mycobacteria. Spontaneous induction of phage associated with mycobacteria isolates using overlay and <b>indicator</b> <b>plate</b> methods was not successful to detect the presence of any inducible phage. A phage was isolated from soil samples that was designated the name A 22. After purification and characterization. A 22 phage was compared morphologically to well characterized L 5 phage using electron microscopy. Morphological studies revealed that A 22 mycobacteriophage had a non-contractile tail approximately 150 nm long with an isometric head approximately 60 nm, the phage could be assigned to the family Siphoviridae, According to these criteria, both of the phages (A 22 and L 5) belong to the order Caudovirales (tailed bacteriophages). Based on PCR amplification of A 22 phage DNA using L 5 gp 71 specific primers and the infection of M. smegmatis L 5 lysogen, we believe that this novel A 22 phage differs from L 5 phage...|$|E

40|$|A major {{bottleneck}} {{preventing the}} economically favourable production of biofuels from cellulose {{is the high}} cost of the cellulase enzymes used to convert cellulose into fermentable glucose units. One way to reduce the cost and increase the efficiency of cellulose hydrolysis is to develop new cellulase systems with enhanced cellulose hydrolysis rates and efficiencies. A better understanding of the relationship between cellulose structure and cellulose hydrolysis mechanisms will facilitate the development of cellulases with sufficiently enhanced hydrolysis rates and efficiencies. To achieve this, I am pursuing the following two research objectives: (i) express a library of evolutionarily diverse endoglucanases representing each of several different glycosyl hydrolase families and tertiary structures; and; (ii) perform detailed characterizations on the enzymes to gain insight into the relationship between cellulase structure and cellulase function. For these studies, I compared the hydrolysis capabilities of a library of novel endoglucanases against Trichoderma reesei (T. reesei) cellulase system endoglucanases using the model substrate phosphoric acid swollen cellulose (PASC), a substrate used in commercial ethanol production (pre-treated wheat straw), carboxymethylcellulose glucooligosaccharides and various hemicellulose components found in pretreated lignocellulose feedstocks. About 100 fungal genome sequences were downloaded from public databases. From these, 23 fungal species were selected based on their ability to hydrolyze vascular plant biomass and their evolutionary diversity. The 75 genes encoding endoglucanases selected from 23 fungal species were manually annotated, cloned and expressed using Aspergillus niger as the expression host. Congo Red <b>indicator</b> <b>plate</b> screening revealed that at least 37 of the endoglucanase genes expressed an active secreted endoglucanase (EG). Among the 37 EGs subjected to preliminary biochemical characterization, it was shown that the optimal pH and temperature of the 26 endoglucanases with the highest levels of activity ranged from pH 3. 0 to pH 6. 0 and from 40 ˚C to 70 ˚C. Based on the results of this detailed screening, 17 endoglucanases were selected for further analyses that included: assessing their thermostability, assessing their ability to hydrolyze short oligosaccharides, determining their substrate specificity and assessing their ability to enhance the saccharification of cellulosic substrates by the T. reesei cellulase system and various derivatives thereof...|$|E

40|$|Pseudomonas putida PpF 1 {{degraded}} toluene via a dihydrodiol {{pathway to}} tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates. The initial reaction was catalyzed by a multicomponent enzyme, toluene dioxygenase, which oxidized toluene to (+) -cis- 1 (S), 2 (R) -dihydroxy- 3 -methylcyclohexa- 3, 5 -diene (cis-toluene dihydrodiol). The enzyme {{consisted of three}} protein components: NADH-ferredoxintol oxidoreductase (reductasetol), ferredoxintol, and a terminal oxygenase which is an iron-sulfur protein (ISPtol). Mutants blocked {{in each of these}} components were isolated after mutagenesis with nitrosoguanidine. Mutants occurred as colony morphology variants when grown in the presence of toluene on <b>indicator</b> <b>plates</b> containing agar, mineral salts, a growth-supporting nutrient (arginine), 2, 3, 5 -triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC), and Nitro Blue Tetrazolium (NBT). Under these conditions, wild-type colonies appeared large and red as a result of TTC reduction. Colonies of reductasetol mutants were white or white with a light blue center, ferredoxintol strains were light blue with a dark blue center, and strains that lacked ISPtol gave dark blue colonies. Blue color differences in the mutant colonies were due to variations in the extent of NBT reduction. Strains lacking all three components appeared white. Toluene dioxygenase mutants were characterized by assaying toluene dioxygenase activity in crude cell extracts which were complemented with purified preparations of each protein component. Between 40 and 60 % of the putative mutants selected from the NBT-TTC <b>indicator</b> <b>plates</b> were unable to grow with toluene as the sole source of carbon and energy.

We have adapted this method for use with the oral pathogen Streptococcus mutans, a gram-positive, aerotolerant anaerobe that uses predominantly carbohydrates as carbon sources for growth. Streptozotocin selectively kills growing cells of S. mutans GS- 5, and under appropriate conditions it can reduce the number of viable cells in actively growing cultures by a factor of 10 (3) to 10 (4). However, unlike in enteric bacteria, which take up this antibiotic by a single NAG-specific transport system, streptozotocin appears to be taken up in S. mutans by both a NAG-specific system and a relatively nonspecific system that is also involved in glucose, fructose, and mannose uptake. Combining streptozotocin selection and a screening procedure involving <b>indicator</b> <b>plates</b> containing triphenyl-tetrazolium chloride, we developed a general method for the isolation of carbohydrate-negative and auxotrophic mutants of S. mutans.
