5|$|During India's {{independence}} struggle, Gandhi {{launched the}} Dandi March along India's west coast to {{protest against the}} sales tax levied on salt extraction. His close associate C. Rajagopalachari, who would later become independent India's first Governor-General, carried out a salt march in parallel, {{on the east coast}} starting from Trichonopoly (modern day Tiruchirappalli) in Vedaranyam. His group, <b>having</b> <b>people</b> like Sardar Vedaratnam, started from Tiruchirappalli, in Madras Presidency (now part of Tamil Nadu), to the coast of the town. After making illegal salt there on 30 April 1930, the group was arrested by the British. After India's independence, Vedaranyam continued {{to be a part of}} Thanjavur district until 1991, and later became part of the newly created Nagapattinam district.|$|E

25|$|Early social {{networking}} on the World Wide Web {{began in the}} form of generalized online communities such as Theglobe.com (1995), Geocities (1994) and Tripod.com (1995). Many of these early communities focused on bringing people together to interact with each other through chat rooms, and encouraged users to share personal information and ideas via personal webpages by providing easy-to-use publishing tools and free or inexpensive webspace. Some communities – such as Classmates.com – took a different approach by simply <b>having</b> <b>people</b> link to each other via email addresses. PlanetAll started in 1996.|$|E

25|$|Because of KMT {{strategy}} of <b>having</b> <b>people</b> boycott the referendum, one major controversy, like in 2004 was {{the format of}} the polling, specifically as whether the referendum questions would be on the same or different ballots as the Presidency. While in 2004 the Central Electoral Commission allowed U shaped line in which people would first cast a ballot for President and then cast a separate ballot for each of the two questions, the Commission ordered voters to cast all votes at once on separate ballots. Voters who choose not to cast a referendum ballot simply declined to pick up the extra two ballots.|$|E
25|$|As {{with many}} other underachieving {{baseball}} teams, a curse is believed to lurk over the Tigers. After their 1985 Japan Series win, fans celebrated by <b>having</b> <b>people</b> who looked like Tigers players jump into the Dotonbori Canal. According to legend, because none of the fans resembled first baseman Randy Bass, fans grabbed a life-sized statue of Kentucky Fried Chicken mascot Colonel Sanders and threw it into the river (like Bass, the Colonel had a beard and was not Japanese). After many series without a series win, the Tigers {{were said to be}} doomed never to win the season again until the Colonel was rescued from the river.|$|E
25|$|Only Holinshed {{contains}} {{information about}} the Peasants' Revolt of 1381, which Shakespeare used for the scenes of Cade's rebellion throughout Act 4 (for example, details such as <b>having</b> <b>people</b> killed because they could read, and promises of setting up a state with no money). The presentation of Henry's reaction to the rebellion also differs in Hall and Holinshed. In Hall, Henry pardons everyone who surrenders and lets them all return home unpunished, {{and this is how}} Shakespeare presents it in the play. In Holinshed, by contrast, Henry convenes a court and has several of the leaders executed (as he did in reality). Another historical parallel found in Holinshed is that Henry is presented as unstable, constantly on the brink of madness, something which is not in Hall, who presents a gentle but ineffective King (again, Shakespeare follows Hall here).|$|E

500|$|After the October 2008, election, Harper again named Senate {{reform as}} a priority. By December, he {{recommended}} {{the appointment of}} 18 senators and, in 2009, provided an additional nine people for appointment as senators. Many of those appointed had close ties with the Conservative Party, including the campaign manager of the Conservative Party, Doug Finley. Critics accused Harper of hypocrisy (the Liberals coined the term [...] "Harpocrisy"). Conservative Senator Bert Brown defended Harper's appointments and said [...] "the only way 's ever been filled is by <b>having</b> <b>people</b> that are loyal {{to the prime minister}} who's appointing them." ...|$|E
500|$|Filming {{began on}} February 5, 2007 at Pinewood Studios, and was {{completed}} by May 11, despite a brief interruption when Depp's daughter was taken seriously ill. Burton opted to film in London, where he had felt [...] "very much at home" [...] since his work on Batman in 1989. Production designer Dante Ferretti created a darker, more sinister London by adapting Fleet Street and its surrounding area. Burton initially planned to use minimal sets and film {{in front of a}} green screen, but decided against it, stating that physical sets helped actors get into a musical frame of mind: [...] "Just <b>having</b> <b>people</b> singing in front of a green screen seemed more disconnected".|$|E

[...] The final cut of the interview video included footage from the live web cast of the interview that showed Ezarik's webcam viewpoint. When Sites asked her to turn off her lifecasting equipment later in the interview, he noted that [...] "at once the conversation seemed more relaxed and natural," [...] and she discussed the difficulty of <b>having</b> <b>people</b> watching and publicly judging her all day.|$|E

500|$|Friedman was a {{supporter}} of the candidacy of Barry Goldwater against Lyndon Johnson following Kennedy in 1964. Later, he served as a member of President Reagan's Economic Policy Advisory Board starting at 1981. In 1988, he received the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the National Medal of Science. He said that he was a libertarian philosophically, but a member of the U.S. Republican Party for the sake of [...] "expediency" [...] ("I am a libertarian with a small 'l' and a Republican with a capital 'R.' And I am a Republican with a capital 'R' on grounds of expediency, not on principle.") But, he said, [...] "I think the term classical liberal is also equally applicable. I don't really care very much what I'm called. I'm much more interested in <b>having</b> <b>people</b> thinking about the ideas, rather than the person." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{last six}} months of {{production}} were spent by Whyte [...] "trying to glue everything together so it made sense as an album." [...] This involved adding intros to some tracks and other motifs to [...] "make it make more sense". Whyte created around one hundred tracks for the album and whittled down the album to a final selection of fourteen. These tracks were sent {{back and forth between}} himself and Warp which Whyte described as a [...] "long process" [...] as he found it difficult <b>having</b> <b>people</b> critique the music he wanted to release. Prior to the release of Glass Swords and any single, Whyte released the EP Sunburst in 2010. Several tracks originally planned for the album were described by Whyte as [...] "a lot weirder and more ambient", but that Warp [...] "didn't really want that".|$|E
500|$|... "I wrote a song a {{while back}} even before [...] "One Sweet Day" [...] {{and it was not}} my {{favorite}} song in the world, but I wrote it. Someone asked me to write a song and they told me the story, and you know {{it was kind of a}} moving concept or whatever. And I did it, and I was like you know it’s not necessarily what I like per se, but after doing the song over and over again and <b>having</b> <b>people</b> coming up to and saying, thank you for writing ‘Hero’ because it saved my life or it saved my father’s life or my brothers or sisters life, or something of that nature, I said I always have to sing that song when I’m performing because if I don’t, you never know who I’m leaving out and you know what, in times of my life I’ve had to turn to that song lyrically and flip it onto my own life and sing it to myself. So its from the ‘Music Box’ album, and it’s called ‘Hero', this is for you." ...|$|E

500|$|Of Robbins' performance, Gleiberman {{said that}} in his [...] "laconic-good-guy, neo-Gary Cooper role, [...] is unable to make Andy connect with the audience". Conversely, Maslin said that Andy has the more subdued role, but that Robbins portrays him intensely, and {{effectively}} depicts the character as he transitions from new prisoner to aged father figure, and Klady stated that his [...] "riveting, unfussy ... precise, honest, and seamless" [...] performance anchors the film. Howe {{said that while the}} character is [...] "cheesily messianic" [...] for easily charming everyone to his side, comparing him to [...] "Forrest Gump goes to jail," [...] Robbins exudes the perfect kind of innocence to sell the story. The Hollywood Reporter stated that both Freeman and Robbins gave outstanding, layered performances that imbued their characters with individuality, and Rolling Stones Peter Travers said that the pair create something [...] "undeniably powerful and moving". Gunton and Brown were cited as [...] "extremely credible" [...] as villains, Howe countered that Gunton's warden was a clichéd character who extols religious virtues while <b>having</b> <b>people</b> murdered.|$|E
500|$|On his hiring, Baker explained, [...] "I did the Dino De Laurentiis {{version of}} King Kong in 1976 {{and was always}} {{disappointed}} because I wasn't {{able to do it}} as realistically as I wanted. I thought Apes would {{be a good way to}} make up for that." [...] In addition to King Kong, Baker previously worked with designing ape makeup on , , and the 1998 remake of Mighty Joe Young. The makeup took 4.5 hours to apply and 1.5 hours to remove. Burton explained, [...] "it's like going to the dentist at two in the morning and <b>having</b> <b>people</b> poke at you for hours. Then you wear an ape costume until nine at night." [...] Burton was adamant that the apes should be substantially [...] "more animal-like; flying through trees, climb walls, swing out of windows, and go ape shit when angry." [...] For a month and a half before shooting started, the actors who portrayed apes attended [...] "ape school". Industrial Light & Magic, Rhythm and Hues Studios and Animal Logic were commissioned for the visual effects sequences. Rick Heinrichs served as the production designer and Colleen Atwood did costume design.|$|E
500|$|After {{spending}} {{several years}} operating at a loss, GoodHome.com reorganized {{under the name}} Scene7, which formally launched in January 2001, with $15 million raised from investors that included Hearst Interactive Media. The new company focused on helping companies prepare interactive advertisements for consumers. Mack, the Broderbund executive who had decided to spin off the company, reflected on the decision to reorganize and relaunch: [...] "We got a year into [...] and the whole B2C (business-to-consumer) market tanked, and we realized we could not build a successful business as a portal [...] But the whole time we kept <b>having</b> <b>people</b> approach us to license the technology , and finally a light bulb went off when we realized we were {{sitting on top of}} a great technology we could sell." [...] Scene7 raised a round of financing on July 12, 2001 that totaled $11.3million, which helped stabilize the company. The deal was led by venture capitalists from several firms, including Louis Bacon's Moore Capital Management and Xcelera of the Cayman Islands, with cash investments from Cooley Godward and Perkins Coie. After the latest round of financing, Mack planned for Scene7 to have 15clients and a burn rate, or negative cash flow, of less than $700,000 a month, stating, [...] "What we learned was to stick to your strategy, and don't get nervous when the competition is adopting a strategy to spend their way to victory." [...] At the time, the company's revenues were well below its peak of $1million a month, but Mack intended to increase revenues past that point in a few months.|$|E
