60|$|This {{process may}} be greatly {{accelerated}} by heat. If {{a portion of}} the wood is raised in temperature to a certain point, the elements begin to combine with the oxygen near, with so much violence as to release the reserved power with great rapidity. And as this force re-appears in the form of heat, the next portions of the wood are at once raised to the right temperature to allow the process of reoxidation to go on rapidly with them. This is the process of combustion. Observations and experiments on decaying wood have been made, showing that the amount of heat developed by the combustion of a mass of wood, though much more intense for a time, is the same in amount as that which is set free by the slower process of re-oxidation by gradual decay; both being the equivalent of the amount absorbed by the leaves from the sun, in the process of <b>deoxidizing</b> the carbon and hydrogen when the wood was formed.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Based on the {{investigation}} of the characteristics of the waste rocks of Xinqiao pyrite mine in Tongling, the possibility of AMD was discussed, and the speciation of Pb in the waste rocks was studied by the improved five steps sequential extraction method. The results reveal that the NP is less than the AP, the waste rocks have a high acid potential and produce AMD. The speciation of Pb in the waste rocks exist mainly in the silicate, secondly in <b>deoxidize</b> and oxidizable mode. But the Pb contents in the <b>deoxidize</b> mode are correlative to the total contents in waste rocks, if the waste rocks react with the AMD, the Pb in the <b>deoxidize</b> and oxidizable modes may easily release from the waste rocks.

The uniform germination {{followed by the}} vigorous early growth is regarded as an essential character for the rice genotypes having a high and stable productivity in the direct sowing cultivation system. In this research we examined the characteristics in germination and early growth of 17 varieties of 0. sativa and 0. glabewima under the <b>deoxidized</b> water condition. Oxygen in water was removed by sodium dithionite. The germination ratio of 0. glaberrima was strongly restricted in the <b>deoxidized</b> water, while the restriction on 0. sativa was not so strict. There was little difference in germination ratio among the varieties of 0. sativa tested in the <b>deoxidized</b> water, but a large difference was detected for the early growth after germination. In the <b>deoxidized</b> water, the two varieties (Razza and Calrose 76) among the 15 varieties of 0. sativa had a continuous growth, while the other 13 varieties had no response in growth after germination. It may be expected that these two varieties have a high enzymatic activity in the anaerobic respiration metabolism to get energy necessary for the initial growth. The responses of germination and early growth of rice varieties to the deoxidization treatment had a good agreement with those determined in the flooded paddy soil. This may prove that the germination test in the <b>deoxidized</b> water is useful for screening the rice genotype suitable to the direct sowing cultivation...|$|R

50|$|Reducing the {{activity}} in the slag (aO) will lower the oxygen levels in the slag. Afterwards, oxygen will diffuse from the steel into the lesser concentrated slag.

50|$|Deoxidized {{steel is}} steel {{that has some}} or all of the oxygen removed from the melt during the {{steelmaking}} process. Liquid steels contain dissolved oxygen after their conversion from molten iron, but the solubility of oxygen in steel decreases with cooling. As steel cools, excess oxygen can cause blowholes or precipitate FeO. Therefore, several strategies have been developed for deoxidation. This may be accomplished by adding metallic <b>deoxidizing</b> agents to the melt either before or after it is tapped, or by vacuum treatment, in which carbon dissolved in the steel is the deoxidizer.|$|E

5000|$|Ferro{{titanium}} is a ferroalloy, an alloy of {{iron and}} titanium with between 10-20% iron and 45-75% titanium and sometimes {{a small amount of}} carbon. It is used in steelmaking as a cleansing agent for iron and steel; the titanium is highly reactive with sulfur, carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen, forming insoluble compounds and sequestering them in slag, and is therefore used for <b>deoxidizing,</b> and sometimes for desulfurization and denitrification. In steelmaking the addition of titanium yields metal with finer grain structure. Ferrotitanium can be manufactured by mixing titanium sponge and scrap with iron and melting them together in an induction furnace. [...] Ferrotitanium powder can be also used as a fuel in some pyrotechnic compositions.|$|E

To convert coal mined on nearby Fredonia Mountain into coke, Douglas built the first of 268 ovens. The company used an incline railway to move the coal from the mountain to the ovens. Although Douglas went bankrupt in 1904, the Chattanooga Iron and Coal Company purchased the ovens, and continued producing coke until 1927.

5000|$|Rimmed steel, {{also known}} as drawing quality steel, has little to no <b>deoxidizing</b> agent added to it during casting which causes carbon {{monoxide}} to evolve rapidly from the ingot. This causes small blow holes in the surface that are later closed up in the hot rolling process. Another result is the segregation of elements; {{almost all of the}} carbon, phosphorus, and sulfur move {{to the center of the}} ingot, leaving an almost perfect [...] "rim" [...] of pure iron on the outside of the ingot. This gives the ingot an excellent surface finish because of this iron rim, but also form the most segregated composition. Most rimmed steel has a carbon content below 0.25% carbon, a manganese content below 0.6%, and is not alloyed with aluminum, silicon, and titanium. This type of steel is commonly used for cold-bending, cold-forming, cold-heading and, as the name implies, drawing. Due to the non-uniformity of alloying elements it is not recommended for hot-working applications.|$|E
