50|$|However, {{days before}} the Iowa Caucuses were held, {{negative}} campaigning by Dean and Gephardt took a late toll on the two campaigns in Iowa as well as nationally.

5000|$|Although Gephardt {{was ahead}} in the Iowa caucus {{throughout}} early 2003, Vermont Governor Howard Dean pulled {{ahead in the}} polls by August, his campaign fueled by anti-war activists. The Gephardt campaign was embarrassed by an early August St Louis Post-Dispatch article that revealed that 11 of 33 [...] "Gephardt team leaders" [...] listed on his Iowa campaign's web site were actually supporting other candidates or neutral. The race between <b>Gephardt</b> <b>and</b> Dean became negative. In {{the final days of}} the campaign, both Dean and Gephardt faded and finished third and fourth, respectively.|$|E
50|$|During {{the last}} weeks of the campaign, however, the polls began to {{indicate}} {{a significant change in}} support. Dean <b>and</b> <b>Gephardt</b> had been hammering each other with negative advertisements, and both began losing support to revived Edwards and Kerry campaigns.

50|$|Serious early {{speculation}} surrounded Bill Bradley, a U.S. Senator {{and former}} basketball player for the New York Knicks, {{who had long}} been considered a potential Democratic contender for the presidency. In December 1998, Bradley formed a presidential exploratory committee and began organizing a campaign. Gore, however, had been considered the favorite for the Democratic nomination as early as 1997, with the commencement of President Bill Clinton’s second term. Though numerous candidates for the Democratic nomination tested the waters, including Senator John Kerry, Governor Howard Dean, Representative Richard <b>Gephardt,</b> <b>and</b> Reverend Jesse Jackson, only Gore and Bradley ultimately entered the contest.|$|E

50|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the September 11, 2001 attacks, the nation's focus was changed to issues of national security. All but one Democrat (Representative Barbara Lee) voted with their Republican counterparts to authorize President Bush's 2001 invasion of Afghanistan. House leader Richard <b>Gephardt</b> <b>and</b> Senate leader Thomas Daschle pushed Democrats to vote for the USA PATRIOT Act and the invasion of Iraq. The Democrats were split over entering Iraq in 2003 and increasingly expressed concerns about both the justification and progress of the War on Terrorism, as well as the domestic effects, including threats to civil rights and civil liberties, from the Patriot act. Senator Russ Feingold was the only Senator to vote against the act.|$|E

500|$|In 2014, Hastert's firm Dickstein Shapiro and the {{lobbying}} firm of former House majority leader-turned lobbyist Dick Gephardt split a $1.4 million annual lobbying {{contract with the}} government of Turkey. In April 2013, Hastert <b>and</b> <b>Gephardt</b> traveled with eight members of Congress to Turkey, with all expenses paid by the Turkish government. While members of Congress are generally prohibited from corporate-funded travel abroad with lobbyists (a rule enacted after the Abramoff scandal), the law permits lobbyists to plan and attend trips overseas if paid for by foreign countries. Hastert defended the trip, saying that he had [...] "meticulously" [...] followed the rules and that the involvement of himself <b>and</b> <b>Gephardt</b> [...] "allowed those members of Congress who were there to have a fuller experience." [...] A National Journal investigation highlighted the trip as an example of loopholes creating a situation in which [...] "lobbyists who can't legally buy a lawmaker a sandwich can still escort members on trips all around the world." ...|$|R
