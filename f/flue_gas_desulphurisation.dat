5|$|All six {{units are}} served by an {{independent}} wet limestone-gypsum <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> <b>desulphurisation</b> (FGD) plant, which was installed between 1988 and 1996. This diverts gases from the boilers and passes them through a limestone slurry, which removes at least 90% of the sulphur dioxide (SO2). This is equivalent to removing over 250,000 tonnes of SO2 each year. The process requires 10,000 tonnes of limestone a week, sourced from Tunstead Quarry in Derbyshire. A byproduct of the process is gypsum, with 15,000 tonnes produced each week. This goes {{to be used in}} the manufacture of plasterboard. The gypsum is sold exclusively to British Gypsum, and it is transported by rail to their plants at Kirkby Thore (on the Settle-Carlisle Line), East Leake (on the former Great Central Main Line) and occasionally to Robertsbridge (on the Hastings Line). DB Cargo UK transport the gypsum.|$|E

40|$|Abstract] In {{this paper}} an {{overview}} is given {{of a new}} biotechnological process to remove hydrogen sulphide from gas streams. This process is jointly developed by Wageningen University, Delft University of Technology, Paques B. V. and Shell Global Solutions International B. V. In 1992, the first full-scale installation for H 2 S removal from biogas was taken into operation whilst in 2002 the first unit for high pressure natural <b>gas</b> <b>desulphurisation</b> was started-up. The removal of sulphur dioxide from <b>flue</b> <b>gasses</b> is feasible as well and in 2006 the first unit went on-stream in China. Currently, more than 75 full-scale plants are in operation worldwide. The formed bio-sulphur has a hydrophilic nature which enables its re-use, e. g. as a fertilizer or fungicide...|$|R

40|$|In {{a utility}} boiler, the most heat loss {{is from the}} exhaust <b>flue</b> <b>gas.</b> In {{order to reduce the}} exhaust <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> {{temperature}} and further boost the plant efficiency, an improved indirect <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> heat recovery system and an additional economizer system are proposed. The waste heat of <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> is used for high-pressure condensate regeneration heating. This reduces high pressure steam extraction from steam turbine and more power is generated. The waste heat recovery of <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> decreases coal consumption. Other approaches for heat recovery of <b>flue</b> <b>gas,</b> direct utilization of <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> energy and indirect <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> heat recovery system, are also considered in this work. The proposed systems coupled with a reference 330 MWe power plant are simulated using equivalent enthalpy drop method. The results show that the additional economizer scheme has the best performance. When the exhaust <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> temperature decreases from 153 ℃ to 123 ℃, power output increases by 6. 37 MWe and increment in plant efficiency is about 1. 89 %.

50|$|The {{stack effect}} in {{industrial}} <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> stacks {{is similar to}} that in buildings, except that it involves hot <b>flue</b> <b>gases</b> having large temperature differences with the ambient outside air.

50|$|The {{purpose of}} the air {{preheater}} is to recover {{the heat from the}} boiler <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> which increases the thermal efficiency of the boiler by reducing the useful heat lost in the <b>flue</b> <b>gas.</b> As a consequence, the <b>flue</b> <b>gases</b> are also conveyed to the <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> stack (or chimney) at a lower temperature, allowing simplified design of the conveyance system and the <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> stack.

40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} {{the influence of}} humidity of combusted wood biomass on the <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> losses. A mathematical relation between <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> losses of the boiler on wood biomass humidity is presented as well as temperature of <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> emitted from the boiler into the atmosphere. The limits of model application for the humidity of wood biomass falls into the interval 10 – 60 % whereas the range of temperatures of <b>flue</b> <b>gases</b> emitted from the boiler to the atmosphere is 120 – 200 °C. The influence of the humidity of wood biomass has an adverse effect on increasing {{the extent of the}} boiler <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> losses and thus inefficiency of the heat production. The increase of the wood biomass humidity from the value of 10 % to 60 % with the outlet temperature of <b>flue</b> <b>gases</b> from the boiler 120 °C causes an increase in <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> loss of the boiler from the value 8. 37 % to 12. 43 %, similarly the increase of <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> loss by 200 °C from 15. 19 % to 22. 55 %, or the increase of the <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> loss by 7. 36 %...|$|R

40|$|This project {{dealt with}} use of {{condensing}} heat exchangers to recover water vapor from <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> at coal-fired power plants. Pilot-scale heat transfer tests were performed to determine the relationship between <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> moisture concentration, heat exchanger design and operating conditions, and water vapor condensation rate. The tests also determined {{the extent to which}} the condensation processes for water and acid vapors in <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> can be made to occur separately in different heat transfer sections.
