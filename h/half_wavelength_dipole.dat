One of the most attractive attributes of hyperthermia is the possibility of providing therapeutic benefit noninvasively, minimizing side effects.

40|$|The use of {{spherical wave}} {{expansion}} of {{the solution of the}} wave equation to predict Far-Field values from data measured in the Near-Field region is a well known technique, typically used to perform antenna measurements in compact anechoic chambers. However, when designing the computing algorithm it is fundamental to validate the results and to quantify the numerical error of the method. In this regard, a computer application that samples the electric Near-Field and calculates the values of the electric Far-Field region using {{spherical wave expansion}} was developed to measure antenna radiation patterns in the Fresnel zone inside a fully anechoic chamber. In order to validate the code, this paper describes three validation methods: firstly, using the theoretical electric Near-Field values of an infinitesimal dipole as the input to the algorithm to compare the output with the response analytically expected; secondly, using a Far-Field electric field data of a calibrated <b>half</b> <b>wavelength</b> <b>dipole</b> measured in an anechoic chamber and finally, using an electric Near-Field data of a calibrated <b>half</b> <b>wavelength</b> <b>dipole</b> measured in the same chamber.

40|$|A novel idea is {{investigated}} for {{radio frequency identification}} (RFID) and tagging, based on a radio frequency analogy of the ubiquitous optical barcode. The proposed method, referred to as an RF barcode, is based upon microwave resonators of different frequencies and requires no integrated circuits. RF barcodes, like optical barcodes, are passive devices requiring neither batteries nor reader power. These low cost components can potentially be "printed" on the tagged items or the packaging using metal-loaded ink. Each tag consists of parallel strips of microstrip <b>half</b> <b>wavelength</b> <b>dipoles</b> with varying widths as well varying lengths, each with a specific resonant frequency. A collection of these resonant dipoles forms a multi-bit tag with a specific binary code. With n different resonant RF barcodes, 2 n_ 1 different items can be tagged and identified. Like optical barcodes, RF barcodes are disposable and read-only devices since the barcode reader cannot alter the information they contain, hence no readwrite capability as,is found with chip-based RFID devices. This {{is often referred to}} as a write-once, read-many (WORM) tag type_ It is shown that RF barcodes have longer read range compared to optical barcodes; a range of up to 10 m is achievable using allowable transmit levels in the license-exempt Industrial Scientific and Medical (ISM) frequency bands. It is shown for the first time that a useable number of bits can be achieved by operating within multiple bands. Prototype tags are demonstrated in the 2. 4 GHz and 5 - 6 GHz frequency bands. Techniques are presented for accurately estimating barcode centre frequency, quality factor and bandwidth in order to maximise the number of information bits in the tag. A number of RF barcode reader design strategies are presented based on monostatic and bistatic detection methods. Both of these methods can potentially employ pulsed or continuous-sweep excitation. The advantages and disadvantages of each excitation technique are discussed in detail and results presented based on bistatic continuous frequency-sweep excitation.

40|$|Abstract—New {{reconfigurable}} {{antenna array}} is demonstrated for {{multiple input multiple output}} (MIMO) communication sys-tems that improves link capacity in closely spaced antenna arrays. The antenna system {{consists of an}} array of two printed dipoles sep-arated by a distance of a quarter wavelength. Each of the dipoles can be reconfigured in length using PIN diode switches. The switch configuration can be modified in a manner adaptive to changes in the environment. The configuration of switches effects the mu-tual coupling between the array elements, and subsequently, the radiation pattern of each antenna, leading to different degrees of pattern diversity which can be used to improve link capacity. The PIN diode-based reconfigurable antenna solution is first motivated through a capacity analysis of the antenna in a clustered MIMO channel model. A new definition of spatial correlation coefficient is introduced to include the effects of antenna mismatch and ra-diation efficiency when quantifying the benefit of pattern diver-sity. Next, the widespread applicability of the proposed technique is demonstrated, relative to conventional <b>half</b> <b>wavelength</b> printed <b>dipoles,</b> using computational electromagnetic simulation in an out-door and indoor environment and field measurements in an indoor laboratory environment.

The {{objective is to}} print flexible electronic devices onto fabrics solely by inkjet printing or pneumatic dispenser printing. Antennas and capacitors, as intermediate inkjet printed electronic devices, are addressed before transistor fabrication. There are many publications that report inkjet printed flexible electronic devices. However, none of the reported methods use fabrics as the target substrate or are processed under a sufficiently low temperature (? 150 oC) to enable fabrics to survive. The target substrate in this research, standard 65 / 35 polyester cotton fabric, has a maximum thermal curing condition of 180 oC for 15 minutes and 150 oC for 45 minutes. Therefore the total effective curing time is best below 150 oC within 30 minutes to minimise any potential degradation of the fabric substrate. This thesis reports on an inkjet printed flexible <b>half</b> <b>wavelength</b> fabric <b>dipole</b> antenna, an inkjet printed fabric patch antenna, an all inkjet printed SU- 8 capacitor, an all inkjet printed fabric capacitor and an inkjet printed transistor on a silicon dioxide coated silicon wafer.

In this paper, the authors have compared quantum particle swarm optimization (QPSO) and backtracking search algorithms (BSA) in failure correction of linear antenna arrays constructed using half wavelength uniformly spaced dipoles. The QPSO algorithm is a combination of classical PSO and quantum mechanics principles to enhance the performance of PSO and BSA is considered as a modernized PSO using historical populations. These two algorithms are applied to obtain the voltage excitations of the nondefective elements in the failed antenna array such that the necessary objectives, namely, the minimization of parameters like side lobe level (SLL) and voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR), are achieved leading to their values matching closely the desired parameter values. The results of both algorithms are compared in terms of parameters used in the objective function along their statistical parameters. Moreover, in order to reduce the processing time, inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) is used to obtain the array factor.

In a smart antenna system a specialized signal processor computes the direction of arrival (DOA) of a user and also adds {{the strength of the}} signals from each antenna element together to form a beam towards the direction as computed by DOA. If additional users join in the system, the adaptive antenna processor can tune out unwanted interferers by placing nulls towards the signals not of interest, and concentrate on the desired user by the main beam toward the signal of interest. Smart antenna systems integrate with radio intelligence with antenna array technology to increase the channel capacity, coverage range and improve link quality.
