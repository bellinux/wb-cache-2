25|$|According to Polybius (bold <b>emphasis</b> <b>added)</b> Just at this time, Gaius Atilius, {{the other}} Consul, had reached Pisa from Sardinia with his legions {{and was on}} his way to Rome, marching in the {{opposite}} direction to the enemy. When the Celts were near Telamon in Etruria, their advanced foragers encountered the advance guard of Gaius and were made prisoners. On being examined by the Consul they narrated all that had recently occurred and told him of the presence of the two armies, stating that the Gauls were quite near and Lucius behind them. The news surprised him but at the same time made him very hopeful, as he thought he had caught the Gauls on the march between the two armies. He ordered his Tribunes to put the legions in fighting order and to advance thus at marching pace in so far as the nature of the ground allowed the attack in line. He himself had happily noticed a hill situated above the road by which the Celts must pass, and taking his cavalry with him, advanced at full speed, being anxious to occupy the crest of the hill before their arrival and be the first to begin the battle, feeling certain that thus he would get the largest share of credit for the result.|$|E

500|$|The {{etymology}} of Sinthgunt is unclear. [...] Within {{the original}} manuscript, Sinthgunt is spelled Sinhtgunt (<b>emphasis</b> <b>added).</b> In the 19th century, Sophus Bugge stuck strictly to this reading, proposing a complex compound based on Germanic *Sin-naχt-gund, i.e. [...] "the night-walking one". As {{a result of}} the pairing with Sunna, the personified sun, this etymology has been interpreted as a reference to the moon. However, this reading has yielded problems; the moon in Germanic mythology is considered masculine, exemplified in the personification of the moon in Norse mythology, Máni, a male figure. According to Simek, the historical record lacks evidence for any cult of personified celestial bodies among the ancient Germanic peoples.|$|E
500|$|In April 2010 Patel {{introduced}} an ambiguity {{in a second}} report for the CPS, saying he had found [...] "intraabdominal fluid with blood about 3l with small blood clot" [...] (<b>emphasis</b> <b>added).</b> The ambiguity had to be clarified, because {{the second and third}} pathologists had relied in part on Patel's original notes to form their views. Patel was interviewed twice by the CPS. According to Starmer, Patel [...] "maintained that the total fluid was somewhat in excess of three litres but that it was mainly ascites (a substance which forms in a damaged liver), which had been stained with blood. He had not retained the fluid nor had he sampled it in order to ascertain the proportion of blood because, he said, he had handled blood all his professional life and he knew that this was not blood but blood-stained ascites." [...] Patel also said he had found no internal rupture that would have led to this degree of blood loss.|$|E

[...] (Russell 1938: 204; <b>emphasis</b> <b>added)</b> As Kirk Willis remarked on Russell's outlook during the 1930s, [...] "the foreign and domestic policies of successive national governments repelled him, as did the triumph of totalitarian regimes on the continent and the seemingly inexorable march to war brought in their wake... Despairing that war could be avoided and convinced that such a European-wide conflict would herald a new dark age of barbarism and bigotry, Russell gave voice to his despondency in Which Way to Peace? (1936) – not so much a reasoned defence of appeasement as an expression of defeatism". (Russell 1938:xxii-xxiii) ...|$|E

5000|$|Multiple affirmation: In English, {{repeated}} affirmation {{can be used}} to <b>add</b> <b>emphasis</b> to {{an affirmative}} statement, just as repeated negation can <b>add</b> <b>emphasis</b> to a negative one. When we say something along the lines of, I do love you, with a stronger intonation on the do, we are putting double affirmation into use. This is because all languages, by default, automatically express their sentences in the affirmative and must then alter the sentence {{in one way or another}} to express the opposite. Therefore, the sentence I love you is already affirmative, and adding the extra do only <b>adds</b> <b>emphasis</b> and does not change the meaning of the statement.|$|R
