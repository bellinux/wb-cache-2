40|$|Urban {{economic}} theory states that transit improvements result in travel time savings and consequently warrant higher rents particularly with proximity to surrounding stations. This research uses the Sheppard subway corridor {{as a case}} study to test the established theories by measuring the changes to residential intensification and property values (1) as a function of time before and after the construction, and (2) as a function of distance to subway stations. Two metrics are established to observe residential intensification and property value: <b>Dwelling</b> Density and <b>Value</b> Density respectively. <b>Dwelling</b> Density is the number of dwellings contained in its property parcel divided by property area; Value Density is total property value of a given property parcel divided by its property area. Using obtained property sales data in four identified analysis years (1991, 1996, 2001, and 2006) and ArcGIS, spatial interpolation surfaces are generated to visualize the changes on a geographical plane through time. <b>Dwelling</b> and <b>Value</b> Density scatterplots are generated by extracting values from the interpolated surfaces and computing its distance to the nearest subway station and to major development nodes. The generated interpolated surfaces show a strong increase in <b>Dwelling</b> and <b>Value</b> Density in North York Centre which suggest that (1) planning policies succeeded in guiding residential growth, (2) a time lag is present of which the full benefits of rapid transit construction are realized, and (3) there may be positive network effects associated with the completion of the Sheppard subway. The scatterplot results demonstrated moderate change in <b>Dwelling</b> and <b>Value</b> Density at the Bayview station area and little change for the remaining stations (Bessarion, Don Mills, and Leslie) based on observations up to December 2006. The results warrant a degree of optimism about Sheppard subway’s ability to attract residential intensification and raise property values, especially given that data was analyzed only up to four years after the subway corridor began revenue service. It is recommended that a similar methodology be performed at a later date when the corridor’s ridership and surrounding development reaches maturity. A preliminary forecasting exercise determined that <b>Dwelling</b> and <b>Value</b> Density will rise, particularly surrounding stations that have since demonstrated little change in residential land use...|$|R

40|$|Although certain {{provisions}} of the federal tax code provide subsidies to homeowners, others provide subsidies to renters {{in the form of}} tax incentives for investments in rental housing. We demonstrate that the renter subsidies dominate for households in low tax brackets whereas homeowner subsidies dominate for households in high tax brackets. Moreover the dollar magnitude involved in the tenure decision can easily push a household across tax brackets. Based on this relation, we identify an upper bound on the <b>value</b> of a <b>dwelling</b> that a household with a given income will prefer to own rather than rent for tax purposes. If the household were to choose a <b>dwelling</b> <b>valued</b> in excess of this household-specific upper bound, the tax effect would reverse and favor renting.

40|$|This paper {{treats the}} stock of {{residential}} units as portfolios of neighbourhood built environments. It describes the frontiers of the portfolios in Toronto and examines their changes between 1991 and 1996. In this paper, I argue that suburbanization has brought about homogenous residential built environments and might have increased the risk of owning a home – an argument that is in contrary {{to what has been}} commonly believed: homogeneity has been welcomed by households because it is believed that households can better anticipate changes in the physical condition of the neighbourhood environment and can therefore derive a better sense of control over their housing asset. However, what has been neglected is that homogeneity has also increased the substitutability of nearby units. Increased substitutability implies that any changes in <b>dwelling</b> <b>values</b> can easily affect the <b>value</b> of other <b>dwellings</b> in the neighbourhood. That is, homogeneity might have increased housing values on the one hand, but has at the same time magnified the risk of housing values. 1...|$|R

40|$|When home {{ownership}} {{is the dominant}} tenure form in any country, the fiscal subsidies directed towards it need continual reassessment. This paper updates an earlier study on direct and indirect assistance to {{home ownership}} in Australia, {{a country with a}} mature home ownership sector. It examines the changing pattern of deposit assistance provided to first homebuyers and the trends in indirect assistance provided through the tax system, with tenure neutrality taken as the preferred tax expenditure benchmark. It was motivated by a significant growth in real <b>dwelling</b> <b>values</b> and changes to the tax system since the mid- 1980 s that have resulted in increased tax concessions to owner-occupiers. Indirect assistance is shown to dominate direct assistance and is poorly targeted, with the greatest amount of assistance being provided to those households who need it least. On a per household basis, outright owners receive more than five times the amount received by those with a mortgage, with high-income outright owners receiving an estimated benefit of close to $ 9, 000 (€ 5, 400) per annum. Home purchasers in the bottom 80 per cent of the income distribution received less than $ 500 (€ 300) per household per year.

Apart from five geological events, all others (156) {{are the result of}} meteorological hazards—tropical cyclones, floods, thunderstorms, hailstorms and bushfires. In this study, we normalise the weather-related losses to estimate the insured loss that would be sustained if these events were to recur under year 2006 societal conditions. Conceptually equivalent to the population, inflation and wealth adjustments used in previous studies, we use two surrogate factors to normalise losses—changes in both the number and average nominal <b>value</b> of <b>dwellings</b> over time, where nominal <b>dwelling</b> <b>values</b> exclude land value. An additional factor is included for tropical cyclone losses: this factor adjusts for the influence of enhanced building standards in tropical cyclone-prone areas that have markedly reduced the vulnerability of construction since the early 1980 s. Once the weather-related insured losses are normalised, they exhibit no obvious trend over time that might be attributed to other factors, including human-induced climate change. Given this result, we echo previous studies in suggesting that practical steps taken to reduce the vulnerability of communities to today's weather would alleviate the impact under any future climate; the success of improved building standards in reducing tropical cyclone wind-induced losses is evidence that important gains can be made through disaster risk reduction. 8 page(s...|$|R
