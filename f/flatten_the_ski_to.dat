5000|$|By 1977, <b>the</b> <b>Ski</b> <b>to</b> Sea Race {{had become}} so popular that the entire Blossom Time festival was renamed Blossom Time <b>Ski</b> <b>to</b> Sea. Six years later, [...] "Blossom Time" [...] was removed and the event became known simply as <b>the</b> <b>Ski</b> <b>to</b> Sea. Even <b>the</b> parade was renamed <b>the</b> <b>Ski</b> <b>to</b> Sea Parade. Today <b>the</b> <b>Ski</b> <b>to</b> Sea is {{considered}} an entire weekend-long event that is centered on the race. More than 400 teams with over three thousand racers participate in the race. Tens of thousands of spectators gather along the sidelines to watch and participate in fair-like events throughout Bellingham, Ferndale and Fairhaven near the finish line at Marine Park.|$|R
50|$|In waterskiing, a bevel is the {{transition}} {{area between the}} side of <b>the</b> <b>ski</b> and <b>the</b> bottom of <b>the</b> <b>ski.</b> Beginners tend <b>to</b> prefer sharp bevels, which allow <b>the</b> <b>ski</b> <b>to</b> glide on <b>the</b> water surface.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Ski</b> <b>to</b> Sea has {{its origins}} in the Mount Baker Marathons of 1911-1913. The early races ran {{from the city of}} Bellingham to the top of Mount Baker and back. The event was {{canceled}} after a runner fell into a crevasse. <b>The</b> <b>Ski</b> <b>to</b> Sea would be a toned-down version of those races where people race from <b>the</b> <b>ski</b> slopes of Mount Baker to Bellingham Bay.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Ski</b> <b>to</b> Sea Race (S2S), {{widely known}} as <b>the</b> <b>Ski</b> <b>to</b> Sea, is a seven-legged, 93 mi long, multi-event {{competition}} {{held on the}} Sunday of Memorial Day weekend in Whatcom County. The race starts on <b>the</b> <b>ski</b> slopes of Mount Baker, a 10800 ft volcano, and ends at Marine Park in Fairhaven, {{on the shore of}} Bellingham Bay. The seven legs of the race are: cross country skiing, downhill skiing or snowboard, running, road biking, canoeing, Cyclocross biking, and finally kayaking. <b>The</b> <b>Ski</b> <b>to</b> Sea Race is managed by Whatcom Events, with a race committee that includes a race director, a race coordinator, and one or two chairmen to oversee each event, along with hundreds of volunteers.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Ski</b> Wheelers (When old Mr Brown gives <b>the</b> gang some <b>skis,</b> they resolve <b>the</b> {{problem of}} the lack of snow by fixing <b>the</b> <b>skis</b> <b>to</b> roller skates. Havoc results, but it's the two nasty louts who steal <b>the</b> <b>skis</b> who are arrested by the police.) ...|$|R
50|$|During the 1950s and 60s, several {{developments}} in downhill ski equipment dramatically changed the sport. These changes were first introduced by <b>the</b> Head Standard <b>ski,</b> <b>the</b> Look Nevada <b>ski</b> binding, and <b>the</b> Lange and Rosemount plastic ski boots. Each of these further, and dramatically, improved {{the ability to}} transmit rotational forces <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ski,</b> and from <b>the</b> <b>ski</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> snow. This allowed <b>the</b> <b>ski</b> <b>to</b> be turned by directly rotating it onto its edge, exposing the curved sidecut to the snow, bending <b>the</b> <b>ski</b> into an arc, and causing it to naturally turn along that arced path. The parallel turn developed from what was essentially a weight-balanced version of the stem Christy into a much less athletic version, today known as carving.|$|R
50|$|A carve turn is a <b>skiing</b> term, used <b>to</b> {{refer to}} a turning {{technique}} in which <b>the</b> <b>ski</b> shifts <b>to</b> {{one side or the}} other on its edges. When edged, the sidecut geometry causes <b>the</b> <b>ski</b> <b>to</b> bend into an arc, and <b>the</b> <b>ski</b> naturally follows this arc shape to produce a turning motion. The carve is very efficient and allows the skier to maintain their speed, unlike older techniques like the stem Christie and parallel turns based on stemming which can create significant drag.|$|R
50|$|The Bellingham Bay leg {{was added}} in 1980, {{and it was}} made {{exclusively}} a kayaking event in 1992. The final leg of the event that stretched across Bellingham Bay was added <b>to</b> tie in <b>the</b> <b>Ski</b> <b>to</b> Sea name and to add a more exciting finish to the race. Originally this leg used Hobie cats, though sailboats were allowed in 1981. In 1990 the choice of sailboats or sea kayaks was added for this leg of <b>the</b> <b>Ski</b> <b>to</b> Sea Race. Two years later, the leg was restricted to kayaks, because wind to move sailboats is unreliable on Bellingham Bay.|$|R
25|$|Bellingham Sister Cities Association is {{very active}} in {{promoting}} Bellingham's sister city relationships and is very well supported by the community. The relationship with Tateyama, the oldest relationship (which celebrated its 50th year in 2008), is the most active and includes regular events such as an annual city hall staff exchange and community cultural visits. Tateyama frequently fields a team for <b>the</b> annual <b>Ski</b> <b>to</b> Sea race, or at minimum has representation in <b>the</b> <b>Ski</b> <b>to</b> Sea parade.|$|R
5000|$|Ski bindings: secure {{only the}} toe of <b>the</b> boot <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ski.</b> In cross-country, it must be placed so that not more than 57% of <b>the</b> entire <b>ski</b> length is used as the front part. In jumping, a cord {{attaches}} <b>the</b> <b>ski</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> boot and prevents <b>the</b> wobbling of <b>skis</b> during flight.|$|R
50|$|Climbing skins are strips that {{attach to}} the bottom of nordic, alpine touring or randonnée <b>skis</b> <b>to</b> help while {{ascending}} backcountry slopes. They are designed to be removed for skiing downhill. They are typically attached <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>skis</b> via a loop on <b>the</b> <b>ski</b> tip, a hook on the tail, and adhesive on the base of the skin. They are called skins because they resemble sealskin, from which <b>the</b> first <b>ski</b> skins were made. They are typically made from nylon or mohair or a combination thereof, and are designed <b>to</b> let <b>the</b> <b>ski</b> slide forward on snow but not backward. They are usually narrower than <b>the</b> <b>ski</b> <b>to</b> allow <b>the</b> <b>ski</b> edges <b>to</b> get a grip. Some ski resorts permit skinning.|$|R
50|$|In {{the tail}} pivot, e.g., to the left, little turning steps are {{done to the}} left while keeping the tails of <b>the</b> <b>skis</b> {{together}} in place. Repeat the following two steps until the required amount of turn is reached: step the front of <b>the</b> left <b>ski</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> left with its tail in place, bring <b>the</b> right <b>ski</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> left <b>ski.</b> <b>The</b> tip pivot is similar, done while keeping <b>the</b> <b>ski</b> tips in place while moving the tails.|$|R
50|$|Carving {{is based}} on the shape of <b>the</b> <b>ski</b> itself; when <b>the</b> <b>ski</b> is rotated onto its edge, the pattern cut into its side causes it to bend into an arc. The contact between the arc of <b>the</b> <b>ski</b> edges and <b>the</b> snow {{naturally}} causes <b>the</b> <b>ski</b> <b>to</b> tend to move along that arc, slowing the skier and changing their direction of motion.|$|R
25|$|The {{ability of}} a ski or other runner to slide over snow depends on both the {{properties}} of the snow and <b>the</b> <b>ski</b> <b>to</b> result in an optimum amount of lubrication from melting the snow by friction with the ski—too little and <b>the</b> <b>ski</b> interacts with solid snow crystals, too much and capillary attraction of meltwater retards <b>the</b> <b>ski.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: A late model Huitfeldt-style binding. The {{toe clip}} {{runs through the}} core of <b>the</b> <b>ski</b> <b>to</b> bend up on either side. This model uses a metal heel strap with a lever buckle instead of an all-leather design.|$|R
50|$|Ski {{bikes are}} also used in the Freestyle {{category}} however this requires further structural changes to the size and motor, allowing <b>the</b> <b>Ski</b> <b>to</b> become considerably shorter in length, lighter in weight and able to perform better at low engine speeds.|$|R
50|$|Management planned <b>to</b> expand <b>the</b> <b>skiing</b> <b>to</b> a {{new area}} {{to be known as}} the West Bowl. The {{expansion}} has been postponed several times, and it is unsure whether the resort has the support of the state to conduct such major construction in the forest.|$|R

50|$|Conventional <b>ski</b> {{bindings}} attach <b>to</b> flanges {{extending from}} the toe and heel of <b>the</b> <b>ski</b> boot. These are well-standardized in size and shape, under ISO 5355. However, as they {{are attached to the}} ends of the boots, the distance from the toe to heel changes from boot to boot. This requires the binding system to have the ability to move fore and aft on <b>the</b> <b>ski</b> <b>to</b> accommodate different sized boots.|$|R
50|$|Around 1850 {{artisans}} in Telemark, Norway invent <b>the</b> cambered <b>ski.</b> This ski arches {{up in the}} middle, {{under the}} binding, which distributes the skier's weight more evenly across the length of <b>the</b> <b>ski.</b> Earlier plank-style <b>skis</b> had <b>to</b> be thick enough not to bow downward and sink in the snow under the skier’s weight. Norheim's <b>ski</b> was also <b>the</b> first with a sidecut that narrowed <b>the</b> <b>ski</b> underfoot while <b>the</b> tip and tail remained wider. This enabled <b>the</b> <b>ski</b> <b>to</b> flex and turn more easily.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: The {{medium and}} normal {{hill in the}} {{background}} and <b>the</b> <b>ski</b> stadium <b>to</b> <b>the</b> left ...|$|R
50|$|The skier initiates {{the turn}} by moving their knees or {{the whole body}} {{laterally}} {{in the direction of}} the desired turn. The motion of knees is translated through the calf to the high cuffs on <b>the</b> <b>ski</b> boots, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bindings, and then <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>skis.</b> This reduces <b>the</b> edge hold and causes <b>the</b> <b>skis</b> <b>to</b> rotate on their edges, with the skier's weight and the force they put upon them to change the edge of <b>the</b> <b>skis</b> which turns them across the line of greatest slope. To stop the turn the knee or the body is rotated back to the neutral position until the edge holds and the skidding stops. While both skis take part, in practice <b>the</b> <b>ski</b> on <b>the</b> outside of the turn is dominant.|$|R
5000|$|This is {{possibly}} the most dangerous part of the race. Though {{no one has ever}} been killed in the 37 years of <b>the</b> <b>Ski</b> <b>to</b> Sea, Lorri Rasmussen of Bellingham was killed in 2002 while training for the race. [...] Her canoe tipped and she was swept up in a log jam.|$|R
50|$|When <b>the</b> <b>Ski</b> <b>to</b> Sea {{debuted in}} 1973, the race covered 35 mi in three legs: {{downhill}} skiing, bicycling, and canoeing or kayaking the Nooksack River. Over {{the next twenty}} years, <b>the</b> <b>Ski</b> <b>to</b> Sea would grow to seven legs covering 94 mi. It has also become a continuous event, with a token (wrist-band or timing chip) passed from one teammate to the other {{at the end of}} each leg. Though the race has always kept the various legs in the same order, over the years most legs had been modified in one form or another. Some legs have changed the methods used to complete them, and most have adjusted their lengths on at least one occasion. The bicycling leg has changed length a total of nine times with the shortest distance being 20 mi and the longest being 42 mi.|$|R
50|$|During the 1930s, the Kandahar binding was introduced, {{which could}} be locked down at the heel for the {{downhill}} portions. The Kandahar remained in widespread use until the 1960s. As more skiers took up the sport, especially in the 1950s, broken legs became common. Dr. Richard Spademan saw 150 spiral fractures pass through his emergency department near Squaw Valley in three days, an event {{that led to the}} development of the Spademan binding. By the early 1950s, several safety bindings were on the market that allowed <b>the</b> <b>ski</b> <b>to</b> come off when <b>the</b> <b>ski</b> twisted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> side. This helped reduce the incidence of spiral fractures.|$|R
50|$|NIS (Nordic Integrated System), {{introduced}} in 2005 by Rossignol, Madshus, Rottefella, and Alpina, is fully compatible with NNN boots and bindings, {{but is a}} different way of attaching <b>the</b> bindings <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ski.</b> It features an integrated binding plate on the top of <b>the</b> <b>ski</b> <b>to</b> which <b>the</b> bindings attach, allowing adjustment in <b>the</b> field. NIS <b>skis</b> allow installation of non-NIS bindings. In 2007, Fischer abandoned SNS and entirely switched to NIS.|$|R
50|$|Today alpine skis often {{feature a}} {{combination}} of rocker and camber. This is often subtle, with natural camber at the waist, and rocker at the tip and tail. These designs often lack sidecut as well, relying on their interaction with the snow to provide the curving shape that causes <b>the</b> <b>ski</b> <b>to</b> turn smoothly.|$|R
5000|$|Clipping-in also {{presents}} a serious danger, locking <b>the</b> <b>ski</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> leg during falls. It was estimated that 10% of all skiers using these bindings were injured during any given season. It was this injury rate {{that led to}} the nickname [...] "bear trap", for the way the leg was trapped in the jaws of the binding.|$|R

50|$|Equipment {{during this}} era was {{designed}} for the cross-country portions. This normally consisted of a wooden ski, a leather winter boot, and a cable binding to keep the two together. This combination of equipment was far from optimal for downhill <b>skiing.</b> During <b>the</b> downhill portions <b>the</b> <b>skis</b> are turned by rotating them onto their edges; in traditional cable bindings, the heel is free <b>to</b> lift from <b>the</b> <b>ski</b> <b>to</b> allow a striding motion, and the system offers little support for edging.|$|R
