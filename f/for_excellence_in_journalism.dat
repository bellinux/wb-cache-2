5|$|During the mid-1990s, {{television}} critics praised Jennings for {{his insistence}} on not letting the O.J. Simpson murder case swamp the newscast. Instead, Jennings devoted his energies to covering the War in Bosnia and Herzegovina, anchoring three hour-long prime time specials {{on the subject}} and one Saturday-morning special aimed at children. ABC dedicated more time to covering the conflict than any other network from 1992 to 1996. Jennings received the Goldsmith Career Award <b>for</b> <b>Excellence</b> <b>in</b> <b>Journalism</b> from the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, in large part for his passion for the story. Jennings was also credited for raising the profile in the U.S. of another international story, the 1995 Quebec referendum. The Canadian press in particular raved about his in-depth coverage of the issue, {{and he was the}} only anchor to broadcast from Canada {{on the eve of the}} referendum.|$|E

5|$|In {{a survey}} {{released}} by the Pew Research Center in April 2007, viewers who watch both The Colbert Report and The Daily Show {{tend to be more}} knowledgeable about news than audiences of other news sources. Approximately 54% of The Colbert Report and The Daily Show viewers scored in the high knowledge range, followed by Jim Lehrer's program at 53% and Bill O'Reilly's program at 51%, significantly higher than the 34% of network morning show viewers. The survey shows that changing news formats have not made much difference on how much the public knows about national and international affairs, but adds that there is no clear connection between news formats and what audiences know. The Project <b>for</b> <b>Excellence</b> <b>in</b> <b>Journalism</b> released a content analysis report suggesting that The Daily Show comes close to providing the complete daily news.|$|E

25|$|Besides {{beating out}} its {{competition}} in the 10:00p.m. time slot, The Ten O'Clock News has also placed ahead of KRON, KPIX and KGO's 11:00p.m. newscasts in overall late news viewership for much of its history; however as its news programming expanded, KTVU's newscasts avidly competed for first overall with KRON-TV and KGO-TV during the 1990s. Its newscasts became the highest-rated among the Bay Area's television stations in the early 2000s, firmly taking first place from KRON-TV following Channel 4's January 2002 disaffiliation from NBC. The May 1999 retirement of Zehnder brought changes to the newsroom; however, KTVU was ranked as the highest quality local newscast {{in the nation in}} 2000 by the Project <b>for</b> <b>Excellence</b> <b>in</b> <b>Journalism</b> under his immediate successor, Andrew Finlayson (who began his tenure at KTVU as a noon news producer in 1988, and left the station in 2003), while maintaining the top ratings slot at 10:00 and throughout the noon and morning newscasts. Varying prime time numbers and improvements at competitors (as well as audience erosion for local programming in general) have since led to a decline in the once-dominant news operation's ratings, although it retains the #1 spot, a rarity for a Fox station. For the month of August 2010, KTVU's newscasts ranked #1 among adult viewers 25-54, beating KPIX, KGO, KNTV and KRON.|$|E
