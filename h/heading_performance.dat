40|$|The aim of {{the present}} work {{was to develop a}} method for the {{evaluation}} of soccer <b>heading</b> <b>performance</b> in jumping headers by means of a stereophotogrammetric system. Three non-professional players were involved in this pilot study. The attention was focused on the following variables: the player’s jump height at the impact instant, the ball velocity variation and the initial ball angle after the impact with the forehead of the player. The analysis of these parameters permitted to characterize the biomechanical technique and the performance ability of each player {{in such a way that}} a trainer can define individual procedures to improve the efficacy of this fundamental skill in soccer. Finally an Elevation Index (E. I.) was developed to compare the players performances and to draft a ranking between them. KEY WORDS: soccer, <b>heading,</b> <b>performance.</b> INTRODUCTION: It is well known that in modern soccer an efficient technique in heading the ball is very important. There are several ways to impact the ball and the choice of the proper one is determined by the situation during the match.

40|$|The {{presented}} research investigates to {{what extent}} current feed forward control improves the positioning performance of Dynamically Positioned (DP) Floating Production Storage and Offloading (FPSO) vessels in varying currents. Positioning performance refers {{to the accuracy of}} positioning (both heading and horizontal position) and the associated power usage. Tidal current reversals and so called ‘internal soliton ’ currents are examples of varying currents, in which current feed forward control is expected to improve positioning performance. Time domain simulations are carried out using the DpSim software, as developed by the Maritime Research Institute Netherlands (MARIN). In this research project, the DpSim software is extended with a module containing current feed forward control. When current feed forward control is applied in DP in varying currents, the mean and standard deviation of the control point excursion are reduced. The <b>heading</b> <b>performance</b> and power usage do not change significantly while achieving this reduction...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: We {{investigated}} whether retinis pigmentosa (RP) {{patients with}} residual visual field of < 100 degrees could perceive heading from optic flow. METHODS: Four RP patients and four age-matched normally sighted control subjects viewed displays simulating an observer walking over a ground. In experiment 1, subjects viewed either the entire display with free fixation (full-field condition) or through an aperture with a fixation {{point at the}} center (aperture condition). In experiment 2, patients viewed displays of different durations. RESULTS: RP patients' performance was {{comparable to that of}} the age-matched control subjects: heading judgment was better in the full-field condition than in the aperture condition. Increasing display duration from 0. 5 s to 1 s improved patients' <b>heading</b> <b>performance,</b> but giving them more time (3 s) to gather more visual information did not consistently further improve their performance. CONCLUSIONS: RP patients use active scanning eye movements to compensate for their visual field loss in heading perception; {{they might be able to}} gather sufficient optic flow information for heading perception in about 1 s...|$|E

40|$|The recent {{development}} of compact, inexpensive sensors {{makes it possible}} to apply self-contained sensor-only navigation techniques for pedestrian motion. Previous research efforts have employed gyroscopes and magnetic compasses to determine system orientation, and have used accelerometers for step detection and stride length estimation. To simplify the problem of determining the orientation of the Sensor Frame with respect to the User Frame, previous systems have fixed the sensors to the user’s torso. In this paper, the performance of a novel shoe-mounted sensor solution is compared to solutions from GPS and torso-mounted sensors. The proposed dead-reckoning navigation system applies an array of accelerometers and magneto-resistive sensors worn on the subject’s shoe. Measurement of the foot's acceleration allows the precise identification of separate stride segments, thus providing improved stride length estimation. The system relies on identifying the stance phase to resolve the sensor attitude and determine the step <b>heading.</b> <b>Performance</b> metrics include accuracy of step detection, foot angle, foot velocity, stride length estimation and heading with respect to a high accuracy reference trajectory. ...|$|E

40|$|The MEMS based Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) has a {{wide range}} of {{applications}} due to its low-cost, small size, and low power consumption. However, its performance is affected by sensor noise, bias, and scale factor error. So the traditional strap-down algorithm, only using low-cost MEMS, cannot satisfy the attitude and <b>heading</b> <b>performance</b> requirements. To achieve a long term stable solution, modern attitude and heading reference systems (AHRS) generally integrate IMU with other sensors, such as magnetometers. This paper proposed a new dynamic modelling method for low-cost IMU and magnetometer integrated AHRS. In this method, the system dynamics model is based on the Psi-angle error equation. The acceleration residuals in North and East detraction and heading residual are chosen as the observation vectors, and the corresponding system observation model has been developed. In order to yield optimal estimates, an adaptive Kalman filter is adopted, in which the measurement noise covariance matrix is tuned adaptively according to the system dynamics sensed by the accelerometers. This proposed method doesn’t need to model the system angular motions, avoids the nonlinear problem of system dynamic model, and considers the influence of dynamic acceleration to the filter. The performance tests are conducted with a low-cost AHRS sensor, and the results show that the proposed method is a promising alternative for the AHRS...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThere {{has been}} a long debate among {{researchers}} on whether soccer heading is capable of causing brain trauma. A recent study suggests that headings exceeding a threshold level of 855 to 1, 550 per year, results in microstructural abnormalities in the brain's white matter. This shows that brain trauma is caused by cumulative effect of repetitive headings. The use of protective headgear is one of the suggested preventive measures to protect the brain especially for younger players. Researchers have tested several commercial headgears and found that they are only effective in head-to-head impact, but ineffective in attenuating impact caused by heading. This {{is due to the fact}} that soccer ball is compliant in nature relative to the head. The aim of this study is to investigate materials that can be utilised to minimise the acceleration of the brain caused by soccer heading. A vertical drop ball test was conducted on an instrumented dummy skull. The inner cavity of the skull is filled with ultrasound gel that represents the brain. Six impact-absorbing materials were tested to determine the most effective material that reduces the acceleration of the brain substitute. The speed of the ball before and after impact as well as impact duration were measured using high-speed camera. Coefficient of restitution was calculated to ensure the material is not only capable of reducing the brain acceleration, but also maintains <b>heading</b> <b>performance.</b> It was found that polymer kneepad foam is the most effective material that minimises the acceleration of brain substitute whilst maintaining the speed of the ball after impact...|$|E
40|$|Self-motion {{through space}} generates a visual pattern called optic flow. It {{can be used}} to {{determine}} one’s direction of self-motion (heading). Previous studies have already shown that this perceptual ability, which is of critical importance during everyday life, changes with age. In most of these studies subjects were asked to judge whether they appeared to be heading to the left or right of a target. Thresholds were found to increase continuously with age. In our current study, we were interested in absolute rather than relative heading judgements and in the question about a potential neural correlate of an age-related deterioration of heading perception. Two groups, older test subjects and younger controls, were shown optic flow stimuli in a virtual-reality setup. Visual stimuli simulated self-motion through a 3 -D cloud of dots and subjects had to indicate their perceived heading direction after each trial. In different subsets of experiments we varied individually relevant stimulus parameters: presentation time, number of dots in the display, stereoscopic vs. non-stereoscopic stimulation, and motion coherence. We found decrements in <b>heading</b> <b>performance</b> with age for each stimulus parameter. In a final step we aimed to determine a putative neural basis of this behavioural decline. To this end we modified a neural network model which previously has proven to be capable of reproduce and predict certain aspects of heading perception. We show that the observed data can be modeled by implementing an age related neuronal cell loss in this neural network. We conclude that a continuous decline of certain aspects of motion perception, among them heading, might directly be based on an age-related progressive loss of groups of neurons being activated by visual motion...|$|E

40|$|There are {{two primary}} {{purposes}} for head-mounted systems in aeronautical settings. One is for helmet-mounted sights and teleoperated (head-slaved) weapons systems. Bennett, Johnson, Perrone, and Phatak (1988) evaluated <b>head</b> tracking <b>performance</b> during passive and controlled flight. In that study, comparisons were also made of <b>head</b> tracking <b>performance</b> in sterile and relatively complex virtual worlds.
