Laboratory experiments using an E. coli mutant resistant to nalidixic acid showed that the ubiquitous slug species Deroceras reticulatum could carry viable E. coli on its external surface for up to 14 days. Slugs that had been fed E. coli shed viable bacteria in their feces with numbers showing a short but statistically significant linear log decline.

40|$|Previous {{observations}} {{have shown}} that slugs found favourable conditions for reproduction in wildflower strips and that they caused high damage to oilseed rape adjacent to the strips. In the current study slug numbers and damage were estimated in wildflower strips and at different distances from the strips into winter wheat crops, from 1994 to 1996. Slug damage was estimated using an index of defoliation and slug numbers and activity were measured using wheat bran traps. Investigations began when winter wheat seedlings emerged and lasted for five weeks. Slug damage was never severe {{in any of the}} fields studied. In most <b>fields,</b> <b>slug</b> damage was higher close to the wildflower strips than at greater distances from the strips. The declining slug damage with increasing distances from the wildflowers strips was related to the distribution pattern of juvenile Arion lusitanicus, suggesting that this species was responsible for the higher damage near the strips.

50|$|During {{external}} sperm exchange, {{the penis}} of the donor slug is everted {{along with its}} ejaculate. The everted penis is several fold larger than its usual size, and appears as a bulbous, transparent structure. The ejaculate, an amorphous soft mass, is transferred {{onto the surface of}} the receiver slug’s everted penis. At least one species, the grey <b>field</b> <b>slug</b> (Deroceras reticulatum), shows a primitive degree of sperm packaging. The retraction of the receiver’s penis then takes the ejaculate with it. In most cases, both partners donate and receive simultaneously via intertwined penises; unilateral sperm transfer is only an occasional occurrence. Entwinement is allowed by the curvature present in slug penises; close entwinement aids successful sperm exchange, which occurs at the peak of penis eversion. When an individual of a species with external sperm transfer lacks a penis, it can still reproduce uniparenterally, such as by self-fertilisation, provided it possesses the other components of a normal reproductive system. Uniparental reproduction has been observed in the marsh slug (Deroceras laeve).|$|E
50|$|In {{a popular}} {{publication}} quoted below occurs the following notice of a well-known land mollusk, {{in connection with}} a traditionary story of the plague, which has long had general currency in Scotland: ‘In the woodlands, the more formidable black nude slug, the Arion or Limax, will also be often encountered. It is a huge voracious creature, herbivorous, feeding, to Barbara’s astonishment, on tender plants; fruits, as strawberries, apples; and even turnips and mushrooms; appearing morning and evening, or after rain; suffering severely in its concealment in long droughts, and remaining torpid in winter. The gray <b>field</b> <b>slug</b> (Limax agrestis) is actually recommended to be swallowed by consumptive patients! In the town of Dundee there exists a strange traditionary story of the plague, connected with the conversion, from dire necessity of the Arion ater, or black slug, to a use similar to that which the luxurious Romans are said to have made of the great apple-snail. Two young and blooming maidens lived together at that dread time, like Bessie Bell and Mary Gray, in a remote cottage on the steep (indeed almost perpendicular) ascent of the Bonnetmaker’s Hill. Deprived of friends or support by the pestilence that walked at noonday, they still retained their good looks and healthful aspect, even when the famine had succeeded to the plague. The jaundiced eyes of the famine-wasted wretches around them were instantly turned towards the poor girls, who appeared to thrive so well whilst others were famishing. They were unhesitatingly accused of witchcraft, and had nearly fallen a prey to that terrible charge; for betwixt themselves they had sworn never to tell in words by what means they were supported, ashamed as they felt of the resource to which they had been driven; and resolved, if possible, to escape the anticipated derision of their neighbours on its disclosure. It was only when about to be dragged before their stern inquisitors, that one of the girls, drawing aside the covering of a great barrel which stood in a corner of their domicile, discovered, without violating her oath, that the youthful pair had been driven to the desperate necessity of collecting and preserving for food large quantities of these Limacinae, which they ultimately acknowledged to have proved to them generous and even agreeable sustenance. To the credit of the times of George Wishart—a glimpse of pre-reforming enlightenment—the explanation sufficed; the young women escaped with their lives, and were even applauded for their prudence.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. The grey <b>field</b> <b>slug</b> Deroceras reticulatum {{has become}} a pest in no tillage {{sunflower}} (Helianthus annuus L.) and soybean (Glycine max L.) crops in the southeast of Buenos Aires province, Argentina. Ground beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae) are {{an important component of}} the arthropod community in agricultural systems and have the potential to reduce pest populations. We tested the predation capacity of the carabid beetle Scarites anthracinus on Deroceras reticulatum individuals of different body mass (10, 20 and 30 mg) and on their eggs, in a controlled laboratory no-choice assay. We also tested its preference for juvenile slugs and the similarly-sized pillbugs (Armadillidium vulgare), under choice conditions. This beetle preyed upon both eggs and juvenile slugs, with the highest consumption rate on 20 mg body mass individuals. While preferring the pillbug during the first 24 h of the choice test, our results suggest that in field conditions, S. anthracinus might be a natural enemy of D. reticulatum, consuming slug eggs and juveniles of different body mass.

40|$|The sacoglossan sea slug Elysia clarki {{is able to}} photosynthesize {{for three}} to four months using chloroplasts sequestered from its algal food sources. Furthermore, the slug is able to store {{multiple}} chloroplasts from different algal species within the same cell. This research, consisting of several related studies, explores the role that provision of organic nutrients via photosynthesis plays in the biology of the slug. The first chapter demonstrates that, under conditions of starvation, photosynthetic activity in E. clarki remains fully functional for one month after which it then declines. During the first month of starvation the slug exhibits similar feeding behavior as slugs provided a continuous supply of food, suggesting that photosynthesis delays the onset of starvation-induced behavioral changes. The second chapter explores E. clarki 2 ̆ 7 s spatial relationships with algae known to be food sources in the field. In areas with high slug density, edible algal populations were very low.

40|$|The <b>field</b> <b>slug,</b> Deroceras reticulatum, {{a common}} pest of {{agricultural}} and horticultural crops, is a generalist herbivore with distinct preferences for particular food items. However, these preferences are not fixed, but {{are influenced by}} the recent dietary history of the slugs. In particular, slugs tend to select novel food items ('neophilia'). We investigated the basis of such influences, using artificial diets in which protein and carbohydrate composition could be controlled and non-nutritional ('secondary') chemicals added as flavours. The slugs showed no general inclination for neophilia based on taste alone. There was a possible learned association between protein content and taste, but this was weakly expressed. However, the slugs selected food items, when given a choice, containing nutrients that were deficient in earlier diets, even though all the food items contained the same familiar secondary taste chemicals. Injections of missing nutrients into the haemocoel of slugs inhibited such changes in food preference, indicating that slugs' feeding preferences are influenced directly by their internal nutritional status. We suggest that neophilia in D. reticulatum is a physiological response to a nutritional imbalance arising from a suboptimal diet.

40|$|Deroceras reticulatum (Müller) is {{the most}} {{destructive}} slug pest of arable crops in Britain. Control on a field scale relies heavily on molluscicide pellets. These are often only partially effective; considerable economic loss and collateral damage still occur. More effective targeting of pellets will depend on accurate predictions of damage severity through {{a better understanding of}} population dynamics, reliable estimates of surface activity and behavioural studies to evaluate current control strategies. Lifecycle parameters of D. reticulatum were studied. There was considerable variation in growth even under identical conditions and growth rate was inversely related to survival. For <b>field</b> collected <b>slugs,</b> the association between growth rate and temperature was low but negative for spring hatching individuals; however, this was relatively trivial compared to the high and positive association exhibited by those hatching in autumn. For self-fertilised slugs, egg development took longer and the hatching rate was lower than for <b>slugs</b> laid by <b>field</b> collected adults, but the growth rate was faster. It is suggested that field populations may be composed of fast and slow growers, and that this might be determined by whether eggs are fertilised with auto- or allosperm. An equation was derived to predict female-phase maturity from body weight. Refuge traps sampled approximately one third of the surface active population over a 24 hour period. The timing and number of trap entries and exits did not differ between small and large D. reticulatum. Behavioural studies of D. reticulatum demonstrated that the time elapsed and distance travelled before feeding on bait pellets was shorter when they were broadcast compared to drilled. Soil splash did not reduce pellet efficacy. Trails were more sinuous on fine than coarse seedbeds and were reduced by pellets. The practical implications of these results for assessing and controlling D. reticulatum in arable crops are discussed.

In the petroleum industry, a two-phase flow is observed during the production and transportation of oil and gas. Among flow patterns encountered in <b>field</b> operations, the <b>slug</b> flow appears to be dominant in horizontal and near horizontal pipelines, and is, unfortunately, the most complicated one.

In this paper, a spatially explicit individual based model (IbM) is developed to study the dynamics of a population of D. reticulatum. The IbM establishes a virtual <b>field</b> within which <b>slug</b> spatial dynamics and changes in abundance were simulated. The strong dependence of slug behaviour on environmental conditions is built into the model, which is based upon previous work on the environmental dependence of slug population dynamics.

The IbM proved capable of describing slug populations over 3. 5 years, including the presence, magnitude and duration of D. reticulatum population crashes within this period. Moreover, the model was capable of reproducing slug population dynamics at two sites, with distinct weather and some 100 km apart, with minor changes in initialisation values but no change in model structure and parameter values. A study of field heterogeneity, which might simulate various field designs, indicated the importance of spatial structuring to slug population dynamics and the utility of the IbM for simulating a range of potential spatial management treatments for slug control to maximise crop yield.

Lady beetles (Coccinellidae) provide an important model to study how competitor introductions impact native communities since several native coccinellids have experienced declines that coincide with the establishment and spread of exotic coccinellids. This study tested the central hypothesis that intraguild predation by exotic species has caused these declines. Using sentinel egg experiments, we quantified the extent of predation on previously-common (Hippodamia convergens) and common (Coleomegilla maculata) native coccinellid eggs versus exotic coccinellid (Harmonia axyridis) eggs in three habitats: semi-natural grassland, alfalfa, and soybean. Following the experiments quantifying egg predation, we used video surveillance to determine the composition of the predator community attacking the eggs. The extent of predation varied across habitats, and egg species. Native coccinellids often sustained greater egg predation than H. axyridis. We found no evidence that exotic coccinellids consumed coccinellid eggs in the <b>field.</b> Harvestmen and <b>slugs</b> were responsible for the greatest proportion of attacks. This research challenges the widely-accepted hypothesis that intraguild predation by exotic competitors explains the loss of native coccinellids. Although exotic coccinellids may not be a direct competitor, reduced egg predation could indirectly confer a competitive advantage to these species. A lower proportion of H. axyridis eggs removed by predators may have aided its expansion and population increase and could indirectly affect native species via exploitative or apparent competition. These results do not support the intraguild predation hypothesis for native coccinellid decline, but do bring to light the existence of complex interactions between coccinellids and the guild of generalist predators in coccinellid foraging habitats...|$|R

This project aims to better understand invertebrate resistance in oilseed rape along with the genetic and metabolic basis of UV-B-enhanced defence against two agricultural pests, the grey <b>field</b> <b>slug</b> and caterpillars of the Diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella). UV-B treatment of B. napus and Arabidopsis thaliana has been found to enhance their resistance to these pests, and gene expression analysis of B. napus identified several genes similarly regulated by UV-B radiation, JA application, and/or slug or Plutella grazing. It is thought that these genes are important in UV-B enhanced plant resistance. Transgenic Arabidopsis lines over-expressing three of these oilseed rape genes have been generated to evaluate their role in UV-B-mediated defence. If found to be more resistant to pests, these lines will serve as ‘proof of concept’ that manipulation of the UV-B response pathway in members of the Brassica family could be used to develop new invertebrate resistant varieties...|$|E
40|$|The {{impact of}} {{predation}} by the generalist carabid beetle Pterostichus melanarius (Illiger) on {{populations of the}} <b>field</b> <b>slug</b> Deroceras reticulatum (Müller), {{and the effects of}} prey size on the predator–prey interaction, were measured under semi-field conditions. It was hypothesized that environmental heterogeneity would lead to very different patterns of comparative mortality than might be deduced from size choice experiments conducted in the laboratory. Results from outdoor mini-plots, emulating conditions in a field of wheat, demonstrated that P. melanarius significantly reduced numbers of slugs from all size classes, with no apparent preferences. This was in marked contrast to results from earlier laboratory studies, where this beetle fed preferentially on the smallest slugs. The slugs in the mini-plots ranged in size from 2 – 100 mg and the numbers in the mini-plot reflected the size frequency distribution in the field. Beetles in mini-plots containing high densities of slugs increased significantly in weight, in contrast to beetles in mini-plots with low slug density or no added slugs, which did not. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), using anti-slug monoclonal antibodies, showed that where there was a higher density of slugs there was more slug protein in the guts of the beetles. It was concluded that environmental heterogeneity probably provided a greater number and diversity of refugia for smaller than for larger slugs, counteracting laboratory-measured size preferences measured in arenas without refugia. These results have implications for a range of ecological studies involving inter- and intra-specific prey size choice, and emphasize the dangers of extrapolating from the laboratory to the field...|$|E
40|$|The {{invasive}} Iberian slug, Arion lusitanicus, {{is spreading}} through Europe and poses {{a major threat}} to horticulture and agriculture. Natural enemies, capable of killing A. lusitanicus, may be important to our understanding of its population dynamics in recently invaded regions. We used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to study predation on A. lusitanicus by carabid beetles in the field. A first multiplex PCR was developed, incorporating species-specific primers, and optimised in order to amplify parts of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (cox 1) gene of large Arion slugs, including A. lusitanicus from the gut contents of the predators. A second multiplex PCR, targeting 12 S rRNA mtDNA, detected predation on smaller Arion species and the <b>field</b> <b>slug</b> Deroceras reticulatum. Feeding trials were conducted to measure the effects of digestion time on amplicon detectability. The median detection times (the time at which 50 % of samples tested positive) for A. lusitanicus and D. reticulatum DNA in the foreguts of Carabus nemoralis were 22 h and 20 h, respectively. Beetle activity-densities were monitored using pitfall traps, and slug densities were estimated using quadrats. Predation rates on slugs in the field by C. nemoralis in spring ranged from 16 – 39 % (beetles positive for slug DNA) and were density dependent, with numbers of beetles testing positive being positively correlated with densities of the respective slug species. Carabus nemoralis was shown to be a potentially important predator of the alien A. lusitanicus in spring and may contribute to conservation biological control...|$|E
40|$|Multiphase pipe flow is {{investigated}} using proper orthogonal decomposition for tomographic X-ray data, where holdup, cross-sectional phase distributions and phase interface characteristics {{within the}} pipe are obtained. Six cases of stratified and mixed flow with water content of 10 %, 30 % and 80 % are investigated to {{gain insight into}} effects of velocity and proportion {{of water on the}} flow <b>fields.</b> Dispersed and <b>slug</b> flows are separately analyzed to consider the added interface complexity of the flow fields. These regimes are also highly applicable to industry operational flows. Instantaneous and fluctuating phase fractions of the four flow regime are analyzed and reduced order dynamical descriptions are generated. Stratified flow cases display coherent structures that highlight the liquid-liquid interface location while the mixed flow cases show minimal coherence of the eigenmodes. The dispersed flow displays coherent structures for the first few modes near the horizontal center of the pipe, representing the liquid-liquid interface location while the slug flow case shows coherent structures that correspond to the cyclical formation and break up of the slug in the first 5 modes. The low order descriptions of the high water content, stratified flow field indicates that main characteristics can be captured with minimal degrees of freedom. Reconstructions of the dispersed flow and slug flow cases indicate that dominant features are observed in the low order dynamical description utilizing less than 1 % of the full order model. POD temporal coefficients a 1, a 2 and a 3 show a high level of interdependence for the slug flow case. The coefficients also describe the phase fraction holdup as a function of time for both dispersed and slug flow. The second coefficient, a 2, and the centerline holdup profile show a mean percent difference below 9 % between the two curves. The mathematical description obtained from the decomposition will deepen the understanding of multiphase flow characteristics and is applicable to long distance multiphase transport pipelines, fluidized beds, hydroelectric power and nuclear processes to name a few...|$|R
40|$|The {{sponsoring}} {{company of}} the project is BP. The framework within which the research is placed {{is that of the}} Transient Multiphase Flow Programme (TMF- 4), a consortium of companies that are interested in phenomena related to ﬂow of liquids and gases, in particular with relevance to oil, water and air. The deliverables agreed for the project were: • validating EMAPS through simulations of known problems and experimental and <b>ﬁeld</b> data concerning <b>slug</b> ﬂow • introducing numerical enhancements to EMAPS • decreasing computation times in EMAPS • using multi-dimensional methods to investigate slug ﬂow The outcome of the current project has been a combination of new product development (1 D multiphase code EMAPS) and a methodological innovation (use of 2 D CFD for channel simulations of slugs). These are: • New computing framework composed of: – Upgraded version of 1 D code EMAPS – Numerical enhancements with velocity proﬁle coeﬃcients – Validation with wave growth problem – Parallelisation of all models and sources in EMAPS – Testing suite for all sequential and parallel cases – Versioning control (SVN) and automatic testing upon code submission. • Use of 2 D CFD VOF for channel simulation with: – Special initialisation techniques to allow transient simulations – Validation with wave growth problem – Mathematical perturbation analysis – Simulations of 92 experimental slug ﬂow cases The cost of uptake of the above tools is relatively small compared to the beneﬁts that are expected to follow, regarding predictions of hydrodynamic slugging. Depending on the timescales involved, it is also possible to use external consultancies in order to implement the solutions proposed, as these are software based and their uptake could be carried out in a small time-frame. Moreover it may not be necessary to build a parallel hardware infrastructure as it is now possible to have easy access to large parallel clusters and pay rates depending on use...|$|R
40|$|It is {{increasingly}} being recognised in New Zealand that denitrification {{occurring in the}} groundwater zone {{can result in a}} substantial reduction of the nitrate load leached from agricultural land before this load can reach water supply wells or discharge into groundwater-fed surface water bodies. This natural attenuation process provides an ecosystem service with regard to the protection of the quality of our freshwater resources that to date has not been adequately accounted for. This is largely due to the major challenges involved in trying to understand and quantify the denitrification occurring in a particular water management zone. Based on the example of research conducted at the 'Waihora' site in the Lake Taupo catchment, we demonstrate a multi-pronged approach to elucidate the biogeochemical and hydrological controls on denitrification. The site is unique in New Zealand inasmuch as it has allowed investigating shallow groundwater underlying a pastoral hillslope in great detail using 11 multi-depth well clusters (comprising 26 wells in total). As denitrification is only active under mildly reduced conditions, a systematic approach to characterise redox conditions based on measured concentrations of dissolved oxygen, nitrate, dissolved manganese, dissolved iron, and sulphate provided fundamental initial information on the denitrification potential of the groundwater system. Determining stable isotope signatures of nitrate (δ¹⁵N, δ¹⁸O) and excess N₂ dissolved in the groundwater can help differentiate between denitrification potential and denitrification that has actually occurred in a given groundwater sample. As the interpretation of these data is strongly dependent on the understanding of the temporal and spatial variation of groundwater flows at the site, hydrological understanding proved critical. Tritium, chlorofluorocarbons, and silica were determined on selected groundwater samples to gain insight into the distribution of groundwater mean residence times ('ages') at the <b>field</b> site and <b>slug</b> tests provided estimates of the hydraulic conductivity of the different deposits found in the shallow groundwater system. Given that most biogeochemical and hydrological parameters analysed showed substantial spatial variation, hydrological modelling of the hillslope proved the only promising way to ascertain the overall effect denitrification may have on the groundwater nitrate discharges from this site...|$|R
