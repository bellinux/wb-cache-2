40|$|Aims: The aim of {{this study}} was to obtain Perioperative Nurse Surgeon 2 ̆ 7 s Assistants’ views about their {{emerging}} new role in contemporary nursing practice in Australia. Background: Internationally advanced practice nursing has led to a range of specialist roles aimed at delivering higher quality, efficient nursing care. In 2005 an Australian university developed the Perioperative Nurse Surgeon 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Assistant</b> graduate education and training program to provide nurses with an opportunity to gain advanced practice knowledge and extended skills specifically in the perioperative setting. Design: This study was a qualitative research design that used online surveys and in-depth interviews to explore the issues and challenges associated with the introduction of the (currently non-accredited) Perioperative Nurse Surgeon 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Assistant</b> role in Australia. Methods: Experienced Australia perioperative nurses who had undertaken graduate education and training in this field were recruited for this study. Data were collected between August and October 2011. An inductive thematic analysis was used to interpret the findings. Results: Eighteen nurses completed the online survey and six were interviewed (n = 24). Nurses cited their commitment to professional development and the delivery of high quality patient care, along with surgeons’ encouragement for them to complete specialist clinical training, as key reasons for undertaking Perioperative Nurse Surgeon 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Assistant</b> education and training. Conclusions: The Perioperative Nurse Surgeon 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Assistant</b> role led to greater job satisfaction and autonomy, and assisted nurses to better meet the needs of patients, surgeons and clinical perioperative teams. Without formal recognition of the Perioperative Nurse Surgeon 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Assistant</b> role its future in the Australian health care system is under threat...|$|R

40|$|Fumaric acid (FA) is a {{promising}} biomass-derived building-block chemical. Bio-based FA production from renewable feedstock is {{a promising}} and sustainable alternative to petroleum-based chemical synthesis. Here {{we report on}} FA production by direct fermentation using metabolically engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{with the aid of}} in silico analysis of a genome-scale metabolic model. First, FUM 1 was selected as the target gene on the basis of extensive literature mining. Flux balance analysis (FBA) revealed that FUM 1 deletion can lead to FA production and slightly lower growth of <b>S.</b> cerevisiae. The <b>engineered</b> <b>S.</b> cerevisiae strain obtained by deleting FUM 1 can produce FA up to a concentration of 610 ± 31 mg L(- 1) without any apparent change in growth in fed-batch culture. FT-IR and (1) H and (13) C NMR spectra confirmed that FA was synthesized by the <b>engineered</b> <b>S.</b> cerevisiae strain. FBA identified pyruvate carboxylase as one of the factors limiting higher FA production. When the RoPYC gene was introduced, S. cerevisiae produced 1134 ± 48 mg L(- 1) FA. Furthermore, the final <b>engineered</b> <b>S.</b> cerevisiae strain was able to produce 1675 ± 52 mg L(- 1) FA in batch culture when the SFC 1 gene encoding a succinate-fumarate transporter was introduced. These results demonstrate that the model shows great predictive capability for metabolic engineering. Moreover, FA production in S. cerevisiae can be efficiently developed with the aid of in silico metabolic engineering...|$|R
