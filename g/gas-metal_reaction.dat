40|$|The {{corrosion}} behaviour of NiCrAl alloys in air containing {{small amounts}} of S 0 $_{ 2 }$ has been invetigated. The alloys containing 9 - 20 wt% chromium and 6 - 10 wt% aluminium were oxidized in air and in air containing 1 vol% S 0 $_{ 2 }$. In addition to long term tests, {{the initial stages of}} oxidation were examined using various surface analysis techniques. The results have shown that small SO$_{ 2 }$ additions to the test atmosphere cause a much higher oxidation rate, especially for cast alloys of low chromium and high aluminium contents. The mechanism of the deleterious effect of SO$_{ 2 }$ on the oxidation rate was studied in two ways: - measurement of the <b>gas-metal</b> <b>reaction</b> kinetics using gas chromatographical analysis of the test gas - investigation of trace amounts of sulphur in the alloy. On the basis of the results obtained, it can be shown that the high oxidation rates caused by the presence of S 0 $_{ 2 }$ in the test atmosphere can be significantly reduced by increasing the chromium content of the alloy, by adding yttrium to the alloy, and by ensuring a fine-grained microstructure...|$|E
40|$|Isostatic-pressing {{techniques}} using reversible gels as {{the pressing}} medium were studied {{for improving the}} uniformity in density and structure of UC [...] ZrC bodies. Control of powder-size fraction was studied {{as a means for}} controlling the pore distribution. Control of the carbon content by thermal treatment in a mixture of H/sub 2 / and hydrocarbon was also studied. Near stoichiometric 30 UC [...] 70 ZrC powder was prepared by <b>gas-metal</b> <b>reaction.</b> Assembly of an apparatus for study of the thermochemical vapor-deposition of tungsten is near completion. The vaporization and fission product release rates of a hot- pressed high-density 30 UC - 70 ZrC sample were measured from 1800 to 2000 deg C. A low-pressure gas adsorption apparatus was set up for measuring the true surface area of UC-ZrC samples. The cell used for the study of fission product diffusion through tungsten was fabricated. Samples are being prepared for fuel-clad compatibility and refractory-metal interdiffusion studies. Diffusion-emission studies were made on a rhenium-clad UC sample at 1800 deg C. The molybdenum pedestal of the loading device of a high-temperature mechanical testing furnace was modified. Thermionic emission microscopy showed that areas of high work function can co-exist with betteremitting UO/sub 2 / dispersions on the surface of a W-UO/sub 2 / cermet at 1650 deg C. Life-testing cells for fueled cesium converters using planar, as well as cylindrical fueled emitters were designed. The cylindrical configuration was favored, since a reliable cylindrical cell envelope was developed. (auth...|$|E
40|$|A {{new model}} that {{addresses}} the shortcomings of Sievert 's law for predicting hydrogen absorption is proposed ABSTRACT. A systematic review of previ· ous {{research has shown that}} the use of Sievert's law {based on equilibrium ab· sorption of diatomic hydrogen) to calcu· late the hydrogen absorption reaction temperature in the weld pool is invalid. A new model of hydrogen absorption is proposed which can explain both previ-ously measured data and the data ob· tained in this study. This two-step model proposes that the hydrogen dissociation reaction is gov· erned by the temperature of the cathode boundary layer, and that the hydrogen absorption reaction (of both monatomic and diatomic hydrogen) is governed by the surface temperature of the weld pool. Following this hypothesis further, the rna· jority of the hydrogen will absorb into the outer portion of the weld pool rather than the central region as has been proposed by others. This new model can be used to predict phenomena that the previous theory was unable to address. In addition, a theoret-ical foundation is formulated {{in order to understand the}} effect of the arc plasma on other <b>gas-metal</b> <b>reactions</b> that occur dur-ing welding...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to determine the mechanism of decarburization and carburization of alloy 617 by determining the <b>gas-metal</b> <b>reactions.</b> Binary gas mixtures containing only CO and CO 2 as impurities were chosen to circumvent the complications caused by impurities H 2, H 2 O, and CH 4, normally, present in helium in addition to CO and CO 2; and oxidation tests were conducted between 850 C- 1000 C in six environments with CO/CO 2 ratio varying between 9 and 1272. A critical temperature corresponding to the equilibrium of the reaction 2 Cr + 3 CO Cr 2 O 3 + 3 Csolution was identified. Below the critical temperature the alloy reacted with CO resulting in formation of a stable chromia film and carburization, whereas, above the critical temperature the decarburization of the alloy occurred via reaction between the chromia film and carbon in the alloy producing CO and Cr. In environment with CO/CO 2 of 9 the critical temperature was between 900 C and 950 C, whereas, in environment with CO/CO 2 ratio higher than 150, it was greater than 1000 C. 	The decarburization of the alloy occurred via two reactions occurring simultaneously on the surface: 2 Cr + 3 / 2 O 2 Cr 2 O 3 							 Cr 2 O 3 + 3 Csolution 2 Cr + 3 CO. 				 At 1000 C, the rate liming step was the formation of chromia which prevented the growth of chromia film until the carbon in the sample was depleted. The time taken for this to occur was 300 h. The carburization of the alloy resulted in the formation of mixed Cr 2 O 3 and Cr 7 C 3 surface scale. The Cr 7 C 3 was a metastable phase which nucleated due to preferential adsorption of carbon on the chromia surface. The Cr 7 C 3 precipitates coarsened at the gas/scale interface via outward diffusion of Cr cations through the chromia scale until the activity of Cr at the reaction site fell below a critical value. Decrease in activity of Cr at the carbide/chromia interface triggered a reaction between chromia and carbide: Cr 2 O 3 + Cr 7 C 3 9 Cr + 3 CO. 			 The CO so produced was transported through the oxide cracks and pores and was released into the environment. Chromium diffused outward from the reaction site to the gas/scale interface where it was re-oxidize...|$|R
40|$|An ultra {{high vacuum}} system capable of {{attaining}} pressures of 10 - 12 mm Hg {{was used for}} thermal desorption experiments. The metal chosen for these experiments was tantalum because of its suitability for thermal desorption experiments and because relatively little {{work has been done}} using this metal. The gases investigated were carbon monoxide, hydrogen and ethylene. The kinetic and thermodynamic parameters relating to the desorption reaction were calculated and the values obtained related to the reaction on the surface. The thermal desorption reaction was not capable of supplying all the information necessary to form a complete picture of the desorption reaction. Further information was obtained by using a quadrupole mass spectrometer to analyse the desorbed species. The identification of the desorbed species combined with the value of the desorption parameters meant that possible adatom structures could be postulated. A combination of these two techniques proved to be a very powerful tool when investigating <b>gas-metal</b> surface <b>reactions</b> and gave realistic values for the measured parameters such as the surface coverage, order of reaction, the activation energy and pre-exponential function for desorption. Electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction were also used to investigate the effect of the gases on the metal surface...|$|R
