5|$|Lieutenant Bush's twelve-man {{military}} police unit {{arrived at the}} site from Los Alamos on December 30, 1944. This unit established initial security checkpoints and horse patrols. The distances around the site proved too <b>great</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> horses, so they resorted to using jeeps and trucks for transportation. The horses were used for playing polo. Maintenance of morale among men working long hours under harsh conditions along with dangerous reptiles and insects was a challenge. Bush strove to improve the food and accommodation, and to provide organized games and nightly movies.|$|E
5|$|From 1979, keg Stones {{began to}} be {{promoted}} heavily nationwide, and the beer {{was introduced to the}} South of England for the first time. The beer was promoted following the withdrawal of the unpopular Brew Ten, which was itself intended to replace Bass's regional ales. Originally the beer would be produced at the Cannon Brewery and then transported to Bass' Hope & Anchor brewery, also in Sheffield, for pasteurisation and kegging, but eventually demand for Stones Bitter became too <b>great</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Cannon alone, and production was also extended to other Bass breweries. In the early 1980s, it was produced at Bass' Runcorn brewery, although this was quickly halted after drinkers complained of headaches from the poorly manufactured beer. The Runcorn beer had been brewed at a higher temperature, which increased the amount of hangover-inducing fusel oils in the beer.|$|E

5|$|On this occasion, {{an unknown}} number of fire engines were either wheeled or dragged through the streets, some from across the City. The piped water had already failed which they were {{designed}} to use, but parts of the river bank could still be reached. Gangs of men tried desperately to manoeuvre the engines right up to the river to fill their reservoirs, and several of the engines toppled into the Thames.

The 4th Light Horse Brigade had moved by the same route as the 7th Mounted Brigade, but near El Burj they found the road blocked by fire. Brigadier General Grant, reporting to Barrow, ordered the brigade south of Beit Ur el Tahta to support the 6th Mounted Brigade. The 11th Light Horse Regiment was pushed forward with two machine guns to hold Wadi Zeit south west of Beit Ur el Foqa.|$|E
5|$|The 15th Brigade {{embarked}} for the Western Front on 17 June 1916. Its first {{battle was}} the disastrous Battle of Fromelles. Despite his inexperience in trench warfare, {{he pointed out}} to Major H. C. L. Howard of Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig's British Expeditionary Force staff that the width of no-man's land was too <b>great</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> assault to succeed. Major Howard agreed and, on returning to Haig's Chateau, attempted to persuade him that the attack was doomed to fail. But the commander-in-chief decided that the operation must go on, so Elliott did all that was possible {{to make it a}} success by himself going to the front line to personally inspect the lie of the land and encourage his men. He soon realised that the attack had been a complete failure, reported to that effect, and established that he was now organising the defence of the original trenches. In the end, 1,804 of the 5,533 Australian casualties were from the 15th Brigade. For his part, Elliott was made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George, mentioned in despatches, and awarded the Russian Order of St Anna (3rd class, with swords).|$|E

25|$|In {{species or}} {{population}} analysis, {{for example in}} conservation work, PCR primers which amplify microsatellites in one individual or species can work in other species. However, the risk of applying PCR primers across different species is that null alleles become likely, whenever sequence divergence is too <b>great</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> primers to bind. The species may then artificially {{appear to have a}} reduced diversity. Null alleles in this case can sometimes be indicated by an excessive frequency of homozygotes causing deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium expectations.|$|E

25|$|Once {{they are}} juvenile, Nephila inhabit their {{individual}} webs then begin the growth by molting process. The {{period of time}} between molts is called an instar and there can be 7-12 of these depending on food availability. Ecdysis, or the shedding of the exoskeleton occurs through {{the formation of a}} soft exoskeleton inside the current one. Once the old exoskeleton is shed the new larger one begins to harden. Ecdysis occurs when the spiders mass becomes too <b>great</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> current exoskeleton to support. Once they are mature male spiders seek out females for copulation and live on their webs.

He had to collect manuscripts {{from all parts of}} Portugal, decipher, classify and weigh them before he could begin work, and then he found it necessary to break with precedents and destroy traditions. Serious students in Portugal and abroad welcomed the book as an historical work of the first rank, for its evidence of careful research, its able marshalling of facts, its scholarship and its painful accuracy, while the sculptural simplicity of the style and the correctness of the diction made it a Portuguese classic. The second volume of his history appeared in 1847, the third in 1849, and the fourth in 1853.|$|E
25|$|Towards {{the end of}} his consulship, the Senate {{decided that}} {{elections}} should be held as soon as possible.

When the elections were over, Flamininus returned north to continue harassing the Boii, who soon submitted to him. Upon his return to Rome at {{the end of his}} consulship, the Senate ordered him to levy a new army, in order that the incoming consuls could have a force ready should a war begin against Antiochus III the <b>Great.</b> <b>For</b> <b>the</b> following year, he was appointed a legate under the new consul Manius Acilius Glabrio, who fought in Greece with the outbreak of the Roman–Syrian War.

25|$|The {{majority}} of the CSF is formed in the choroid plexus and flows through the brain along a distinct pathway: moving through the cerebral ventricular system, into the subarachnoid space surrounding the brain, then draining into the systemic blood column via arachnoid granulations of the dural sinuses or to peripheral lymphatics along cranial nerve sheathes. Many researchers {{have suggested that the}} CSF compartment constitutes a sink for interstitial solute and fluid clearance from the brain parenchyma. However, the distances between the interstitial fluid and the CSF in the ventricles and subarachnoid space are too <b>great</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> efficient removal of interstitial macromolecules and wastes by simple diffusion alone. Helen Cserr at Brown University calculated that mean diffusion times for large molecules such as albumin would exceed 100hrs to traverse 1cm of brain tissue, a rate that is not compatible with the intense metabolic demands of brain tissue. A clearance system based on simple diffusion would additionally lack the sensitivity to respond rapidly to deviations from homeostatic conditions.|$|E
