5|$|It {{is signed}} as Essex County Road33, as Leamington is {{planning}} to link the <b>discontinuous</b> segments of County Road33 with the East Side Arterial Road.|$|E
5|$|As such, a <b>discontinuous</b> {{alignment}} {{was planned}} as a compromise beginning in 2010. However, no timeline or construction has been announced regarding the widening of Steeles to six lanes or {{the extension of}} Morningside north of Oasis Boulevard.|$|E
5|$|In September 2010, York {{announced}} that it had reached a compromise to construct a <b>discontinuous</b> route, with Donald Cousens Parkway ending at the current Steeles Avenue / Ninth Line intersection, widening the two-laned Steeles to six west of that point, and extending Morningside north to Steeles immediately east of Eastvale Drive.|$|E
5|$|In the 1930s, the Robert Moses-directed {{construction}} of the Henry Hudson Parkway and Mosholu Parkway fragmented Van Cortlandt Park into its six <b>discontinuous</b> pieces. The last remaining freshwater marsh in New York State, Tibbetts Brook, was dredged and landscaped to accommodate construction, causing large-scale ecological disruption within the park.|$|E
5|$|M-35 is an {{original}} state trunkline that was first designated by July 1, 1919, {{originally intended to}} run from Menominee {{in the south to}} near Big Bay in the north, before turning toward L'Anse to end at Ontonagon. However, the section through the Huron Mountains in northern Marquette and Baraga counties was never built. Automobile pioneer Henry Ford helped halt this construction to gain favor with and membership in the exclusive Huron Mountain Club. Some <b>discontinuous</b> sections were later ceded to local control. The northern segment of the route between Ontonagon and Baraga was retained as a <b>discontinuous</b> segment of the highway; this northern segment was redesignated as another state trunkline. The northern end was rerouted out of the City of Negaunee into Negaunee Township to avoid mining activity near Palmer.|$|E
5|$|The first {{incarnation}} of M-68 {{existed in the}} Upper Peninsula before being absorbed into M-35. The current designation was created in 1936. A segment of highway once used by US Highway23 (US23) was incorporated into the trunkline as a <b>discontinuous</b> section in the early 1940s until it was later connected in 1946.|$|E
5|$|The {{powers of}} {{negative}} real numbers {{are not always}} defined and are <b>discontinuous</b> even where defined. In fact, they are only defined when the exponent is a rational number with the denominator being an odd integer. When dealing with complex numbers the complex number operation is normally used instead.|$|E
5|$|This {{provided}} {{a connection between}} Michigan's M-3 and Ontario's Highway3 until 2001, when jurisdictional changes within downtown Detroit created a <b>discontinuous</b> segment of M-3, and this international Route3 connection was lost when the portion of M-3 along Fort Street was redesignated M-85.|$|E
5|$|Trying {{to extend}} these {{functions}} {{to the general}} case of noninteger powers of complex numbers that are not positive reals leads to difficulties. Either we define <b>discontinuous</b> functions or multivalued functions. Neither of these options is entirely satisfactory.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1958, I-75 in Michigan was {{constructed}} in several <b>discontinuous</b> segments. M-76 was {{to become one of}} the portions incorporated into the route of I-75. Although other portions of I-75 were completed and designated in noncontiguous segments, the portion from Standish to Roscommon was first signed as M-76 and the entire stretch rebuilt as freeway before it was redesignated as I-75. This was done while a temporary connecting ToI-75 designation between Bay City and Grayling followed a different path along US10 and US127.|$|E
5|$|Exit {{numbers were}} {{originally}} sequential but are assigned today by mileage from south to east, the same numbering system {{used by the}} majority of U.S. states for their Interstate Highways as well. After passing the Bonner Springs interchange, exit numbers change to match the mileage of Interstate 70 (I-70) east from the Colorado border, which is also used on I-70 west of the turnpike. This results in <b>discontinuous</b> exit numbers on I-70.|$|E
5|$|In the 1953 New Jersey {{state highway}} renumbering, Route 7 was legislated onto its current alignment, with the {{northern}} terminus moved to the Nutley/Clifton border. The route was also realigned to head south on Washington Avenue between the Newark border and Rutgers Street in Belleville on what was Route 11N, a remnant of Pre-1927 Route 11, making Route 7 <b>discontinuous.</b> County Route 506 used to follow the southern portion of Route 7 but has been truncated to the intersection with Routes 7 and 21 in Belleville.|$|E
5|$|It is {{most common}} amongst the kwongan heath of the Geraldton Sandplains north of Jurien; {{it has a}} fairly {{continuous}} distribution there, often as the dominant species, and extends inland to around the 350mm isohyet. On the Swan Coastal Plain to the south, its distribution is <b>discontinuous,</b> being largely confined to patches of suitable sand in the narrow transition zone where tuart forest gives way to jarrah forest. With {{the exception of a}} population at Point Walter (32°00′S), it does not occur on the sandplain south of the Swan River.|$|E
5|$|Kansas Turnpike mileposts are {{continuous}} {{along the}} entire length of the turnpike. Mile markers begin at the point where I-35 enters Kansas at the southern border. These numbers are continued along the other three Interstates that make up the turnpike, rather than numbering each Interstate individually, leading to <b>discontinuous</b> numbering on I-70—the exit numbers on tolled I-70 are much lower than those on free I-70.|$|E
5|$|M-91 {{was formed}} when M-66 was rerouted in the 1940s. At the time, the highway {{continued}} south to Lowell, but subsequent transfers or roadway sections have truncated {{the route to}} its present form. For a time period in the 1980s, M-91 was even a <b>discontinuous</b> highway when a section in the middle was transferred to county control before the southernmost section was transferred.|$|E
5|$|On July 1, 1919, the M-65 {{designation}} {{was used}} on two, <b>discontinuous</b> {{roads in the}} southern part of the Lower Peninsula. The southern segment ran from the Ohio state line north to the Dundee area in Monroe County; the northern section ran between Ann Arbor and Flint by way of Brighton and Fenton. The gap between the two segments was eliminated by the middle of 1926. When the United States Numbered Highway System was created on November 11, 1926, the original M-65 was redesignated as part of US23.|$|E
5|$|Optical {{properties}} of carbon nanotubes derive from electronic transitions within one-dimensional {{density of states}} (DOS). A typical feature of one-dimensional crystals is that their DOS is not a continuous function of energy, but it descends gradually and then increases in a <b>discontinuous</b> spike. In contrast, three-dimensional materials have continuous DOS. The sharp peaks found in one-dimensional materials are called Van Hove singularities.|$|E
5|$|Planning for {{the route}} {{began in the}} 1950s, but the first segment between Wattle Grove and Cloverdale was not opened until 1980. Over the next five years, the highway was {{extended}} north to Great Eastern Highway and south to Albany Highway, and a <b>discontinuous</b> section was constructed north of the Swan River. In 1988 the Redcliffe Bridge linked these sections, and three years later, Reid Highway became the northern terminus. The next major works on the highway, between 2003 and 2005, extended the highway south to Thomas Road.|$|E
5|$|Some {{linguists}} {{have argued}} that Nahuatl displays the properties of a non-configurational language, meaning that word order in Nahuatl is basically free. Nahuatl allows all possible orderings of the three basic sentence constituents. It is prolifically a pro-drop language: it allows sentences with omission of all noun phrases or independent pronouns, not just of noun phrases or pronouns whose function is the sentence subject. In most varieties independent pronouns are used only for emphasis. It allows certain kinds of syntactically <b>discontinuous</b> expressions.|$|E
5|$|State Route 16 (SR 16) is a {{state highway}} in the {{northern}} region of the U.S. state of California that runs from Route 20 in Colusa County to Route 49 just outside Plymouth in Amador County. It is <b>discontinuous</b> through Sacramento, specifically between Interstate 5 in Woodland and U.S. Route 50 east of Sacramento.|$|E
5|$|The Pseudonarcissus {{group in}} their natural habitat prefer humid {{situations}} such as stream margins, springs, wet pastures, clearings of forests or shrublands with humid soils, and moist hillsides. These habitats tend to be <b>discontinuous</b> in the Mediterranean mountains, producing discrete isolated populations. In Germany, which has relatively little limestone, Narcissus pseudonarcissus grows in small groups on open mountain meadows or in mixed forests of fir, beech, oak, alder, ash and birch trees with well-drained soil.|$|E
5|$|The highway {{designation}} {{was extended}} {{south to the}} then-new US16 freeway (now Interstate 96) around 1958. It was later truncated back to M-21 in Lowell in 1968. By 1980, the section of M-91 in Ionia County south of M-44 to the Kent County line was turned back to local control. The highway section in Kent County remained marked as M-91, resulting in a <b>discontinuous</b> highway. The southern section between Lowell and the county line was turned back by 1985, resulting in the modern routing of M-91.|$|E
5|$|The highway {{was formed}} by July 1, 1919 along two <b>discontinuous</b> {{sections}} of its current corridor. The gap was filled in by 1927, but a second break in the routing {{was created in the}} 1930s. This second interruption in the corridor was eliminated within a year. The various paths that M-46 has followed have been straightened over the intervening years, producing the modern corridor by the 1970s. Other changes have been made to the location of the western terminus in Muskegon, but it has remained fixed in its current location since 1984.|$|E
5|$|The {{mistle thrush}} breeds {{in much of}} Europe and {{temperate}} Asia, although it is absent from the treeless far north, and its range becomes <b>discontinuous</b> in southeast Europe, Turkey and the Middle East. In these warmer southern areas, {{it tends to be}} found in the milder uplands and coastal regions. Nominate T. v. viscivorus breeds in Europe and in Asia east to the Ob, beyond which it is replaced by T. v. bonapartei. The southern form T. v. deichleri is resident in North Africa, Corsica and Sardinia.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of mature or decaying trees with holes suitable for nesting is essential, and trees such as oak, beech and hickory are favored {{in the east}} since they provide edible seeds. Although suitable habitat is distributed continentally, it is <b>discontinuous,</b> and the separate populations of this non-migratory species have diverged to form distinct regional subspecies.|$|E
5|$|The walrus (Odobenus rosmarus) {{is a large}} flippered {{marine mammal}} with a <b>discontinuous</b> {{distribution}} about the North Pole in the Arctic Ocean and subarctic seas of the Northern Hemisphere. The walrus is the only living species in the family Odobenidae and genus Odobenus. This species is subdivided into three subspecies: the Atlantic walrus (O. r. rosmarus) which lives in the Atlantic Ocean, the Pacific walrus (O. r. divergens) which lives in the Pacific Ocean, and O. r. laptevi, which lives in the Laptev Sea of the Arctic Ocean.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} patterns of gas exchange demonstrated by different groups of insects. Gas exchange patterns in insects can range from continuous and diffusive ventilation, to <b>discontinuous</b> gas exchange. During continuous gas exchange, oxygen is taken in and carbon dioxide is released in a continuous cycle. In <b>discontinuous</b> gas exchange, however, the insect takes in oxygen while it is active and small amounts of carbon dioxide are released when the insect is at rest. Diffusive ventilation is simply a form of continuous gas exchange that occurs by diffusion rather than physically taking in the oxygen. Some species of insect that are submerged also have adaptations to aid in respiration. As larvae, many insects have gills that can extract oxygen dissolved in water, while others need {{to rise to the}} water surface to replenish air supplies, which may be held or trapped in special structures.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} 2000, MDOT {{proposed}} several highway transfers in Detroit. Some {{of these}} involved transferring city streets in the Campus Martius Park area under the department's jurisdiction to city control; {{another part of the}} proposal involved MDOT assuming control over a section of Fort Street from the then northern terminus of M-85 to the then southern terminus of M-3 at Clark Street. When these transfers were completed the following year, M-3 was severed into two <b>discontinuous</b> segments by the Campus Martius changes, and the southern segment between Clark and Griswold streets was added to an extended M-85.|$|E
5|$|E. c. albipennis was {{described}} by John Gould in 1841 and found in north Queensland, west though the Gulf of Carpentaria in the Northern Territory and across {{into the top of}} Western Australia. It has white on the wings and a <b>discontinuous</b> stripe on the nape. The wing patch is pure white {{in the western part of}} its range and is more cream towards the east. It has a longer bill and shorter tail than the nominate race. Birds also decrease in size with decreasing latitude, consistent with Bergmann's rule. Molecular work supports the current classification of this subspecies as distinct from the nominate subspecies cyanotis.|$|E
5|$|Its {{distribution}} {{has been}} greatly reduced and is now <b>discontinuous.</b> Decades of poaching for its velvety pelt, peaking in the 1950s and 1960s, considerably diminished population numbers. The species was listed as endangered in 1999 and wild population estimates are typically below 5,000. The Guianas {{are one of the}} last real strongholds for the species, which also enjoys modest numbers — and significant protection — in the Peruvian Amazonian basin. It {{is one of the most}} endangered mammal species in the neotropics. Habitat degradation and loss is the greatest current threat. The giant otter is also rare in captivity; in 2003, only 60 animals were being held.|$|E
5|$|NY286 {{begins at}} the ramp {{connecting}} NY590 southbound to Browncroft Boulevard just inside the Rochester city limits. It heads east through residential surroundings as a four-lane highway, proceeding through the remainder of NY590 exit7 as it enters the northernmost portion {{of the town of}} Brighton. East of NY590, NY286 widens to become a divided highway. It passes into Penfield upon crossing Irondequoit Creek and curves southeast as it straddles the northern boundary of Ellison Park. During this stretch, it intersects with Old Browncroft Boulevard, the pre-divided highway alignment of Browncroft Boulevard which is now <b>discontinuous</b> near its midpoint.|$|E
5|$|Starting 260million years ago, the yellowish-gray {{limestone}} of the fossil-rich Kaibab Limestone {{was laid}} {{down as a}} limy ooze in a tropical climate. During this time, sponges, such as Actinocoelia meandrina, proliferated, only {{to be buried in}} lime mud and their internal silica needles (spicules) dissolved and recrystallized to form <b>discontinuous</b> layers of light-colored chert. In the park, this formation {{can be found in the}} Hurricane Cliffs above the Kolob Canyons Visitor Center and in an escarpment along Interstate 15 as it skirts the park. This is the same formation that rims the Grand Canyon to the south.|$|E
5|$|The {{landmark}} scientific expedition (December 1872 – May 1876) of the British Royal Navy {{survey ship}} HMS Challenger yielded {{a tremendous amount}} of bathymetric data, much of which has been confirmed by subsequent researchers. Bathymetric data obtained {{during the course of the}} Challenger expedition enabled scientists to draw maps, which provided a rough outline of certain major submarine terrain features, such as the edge of the continental shelves and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. This <b>discontinuous</b> set of data points was obtained by the simple technique of taking soundings by lowering long lines from the ship to the seabed.|$|E
25|$|Plasma {{alterations}} {{are also}} seen in necrosis. Plasma membranes appear <b>discontinuous</b> when viewed with an electron microscope. This <b>discontinuous</b> membrane {{is caused by}} cell blebbing {{and the loss of}} microvilli.|$|E
