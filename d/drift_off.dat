5|$|While the Dutch rearguard was {{overwhelmed}} by British numbers, a more equal combat was being contested to the north. There the combat was centred around the two flagships, Duncan's Venerable engaging De Winter's Vrijheid 18 minutes after Monarch broke the line to the south. Duncan had originally intended to break the line between Vrijheid and the next ship Staaten Generaal under Rear-Admiral Samuel Story, but Story ensured {{that there was no}} gap between his vessel and the flagship to break through, and their combined fire was so dangerous to the advancing Venerable that Duncan instead cut through behind Staaten Generaal, raking Story's ship twice and causing it to <b>drift</b> <b>off</b> in confusion as Duncan engaged Vrijheid from the east.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} and crew were assigned a VIP transport mission to RAF Reykjavik, specifically to transport Prince George, Duke of Kent to Iceland. The aircraft departed from a seaplane base at RAF Invergordon on the Cromarty Firth at 1305 GMT on Sunday 25 August 1942 into foggy weather. The Sunderland (flying on instruments) veered off its flight plan track {{and crashed into}} the remote Eagle's Rock at 13:42 GMT. The official board of inquiry concluded that the plane crashed into the hillside due to an error of navigation; i.e. {{there was not enough}} allowance made for wind that caused the aircraft to <b>drift</b> <b>off</b> its planned track up the eastern coast of Scotland. Fourteen of the fifteen crew and passengers, including the Duke of Kent, perished in the crash.|$|E
25|$|On the surface, Uhura convinces Evans to {{set things}} right, while in orbit, the Conqueror is {{severely}} damaged {{and about to}} be destroyed by a warp core breach. Harriman sets the ship on a collision course, but helm control fails and the Conqueror begins to <b>drift</b> <b>off</b> course; Chekov separates the saucer, which would allow the warp core explosion to ram it into Mitchell's flagship. Reaching out to try and divert it, Mitchell finds his powers have disappeared, and as the Conquerors engineering section explodes, the shockwave sending the saucer right into the flagship, Mitchell screams Kittrick's name as his ship is destroyed. At the same moment, Evans goes through the Guardian {{and returns to the}} point where he visited the outpost and demanded to know where Kirk was. Waiting for Evans this time, instead of the data clerk, was his future self, who shoots him with a phaser. The timeline reverts to normal, and the landing party returns to the museum ship.|$|E

500|$|The middle-eight that McCartney {{provided}} for [...] "A Day in the Life" [...] {{was a short}} piano piece {{he had been working}} on independently, with lyrics about a commuter whose uneventful morning routine leads him to <b>drift</b> <b>off</b> into a dream. McCartney had written the piece as a wistful recollection of his younger years, which included riding the 82 bus to school, smoking, and going to class. This theme—the Beatles' youth in the north of England—matched that of [...] "Penny Lane" [...] (a street in Liverpool) and [...] "Strawberry Fields Forever" [...] (an orphanage behind Lennon's house), two songs written for the album but were released instead as a double A-side single.|$|E
500|$|Although {{the pair}} were officially equal partners, Cleese later thought that Chapman contributed {{comparatively}} {{little in the}} way of direct writing, saying [...] "he would come in, say something marvellous and then <b>drift</b> <b>off</b> in his own mind." [...] The other Pythons have said that Chapman's biggest contribution in the writing room was an intuition for what was funny. Gilliam later recalled that [...] "Graham would do the nudge that would push it into something extraordinary." [...] The show was an immediate success, and Chapman was delighted to learn that medical students at St Bartholomew's crowded round the television in the bar to watch it. Chapman was frequently late for rehearsing or recording, leading to the other Pythons calling him [...] "the late Graham Chapman".|$|E
500|$|If {{there is}} any {{criticism}} of Strong's golf course architecture it would likely {{be due to the}} severity of his design of greens and their ability to repel poor shots, and even good shots if they hit the green at the wrong speed or angle. His green designs often incorporated two tiers and sometimes featured a crowned central area, in the manner of fellow golf course architect Donald Ross, that rewarded only the finest of shots; poor shots would <b>drift</b> <b>off</b> the back and to the sides of greens, and greens incorporating false fronts would agonize players whose shots were short and not reaching the central plateau of the green. [...] Most players of his era—playing with wood-shafted clubs—struggled with the boldness, originality and aggressiveness of the architectural forms that he used. [...] The original Fairmont Le Manoir Richelieu course in Quebec, Canada, is full of fascinating holes that traverse an extremely hilly and severe property.|$|E

500|$|Although {{predominantly}} a striker, Samaras {{can also}} {{play as a}} left midfielder. During his time at Manchester City, Samaras expressed his disappointment at being used on the left of midfield too often, he publicly said to manager Sven-Göran Eriksson; [...] "I am not a left-midfielder, I am a striker and I like to play there," [...] However, after his move to Celtic, Samaras was more open to playing as a left midfielder. The Daily Mail {{said that this was}} because he was happier at Celtic and more willing to be a team player. In addition to being able to play as a target man, Samaras can also be used in several different roles when playing up front. His natural style of play is to <b>drift</b> <b>off</b> the front line and provide a link between the attack and midfield. In doing this he can use his pace and skill to run at the defence, while also creating chances or opening up space for his teammates. He can also run beyond the centre-backs and his pace means he can run on to through balls hit over the defence.|$|E
500|$|Due {{to advance}} warning, there was minimal damage to {{shipping}} in the region. However, high waves damaged the steamer Madison with 90 {{people on board}} and caused it to <b>drift</b> <b>off</b> Cape Charles, which necessitated rescue from the Coast Guard. Inland flooding occurred along the James River as far west as Richmond, where damage was limited to downed trees and broken windows. The pier of the Jamestown Ferry was washed out in Surry [...] and a marina at Jordan Point near Hopewell was wrecked after the river reached the highest level on record. A powerful storm surge moved up the Chesapeake Bay and flooded waterfront locations. At Colonial Beach along the Potomac River, the surge flooded the town with [...] of water and wrecked a local amusement park. The Potomac in Alexandria was at its highest level since 1899, causing floods [...] deep along U.S. Route 1, and flooding the Old Town section. High winds in the city caused power outages, and flooding along the Cameron Run washed out a bridge. The combination of rain and winds damaged crops in Fairfax and Loudoun counties, mainly to corn and peaches. Statewide, the storm caused $5.25 million in crop damage, largely to corn and tobacco. Damage in the state was estimated at $17.5 million, and there were 15 deaths. After the storm, about 350 people helped clear debris {{from the streets of}} Norfolk.|$|E

2500|$|Prior to {{widespread}} use of synthesizers, in order to pick up stations on different frequencies, radio and television receivers relied on manual tuning of a local oscillator, which used a resonant circuit composed of an inductor and capacitor, or sometimes resonant transmission lines; to determine the frequency. The receiver was adjusted to different frequencies by either a variable capacitor, or a switch which chose the proper tuned circuit for the desired channel, such as with the turret tuner commonly used in television receivers prior to the 1980s. [...] However the resonant frequency of a tuned circuit is not very stable; [...] variations in temperature and aging of components caused frequency drift, causing the receiver to <b>drift</b> <b>off</b> the station frequency. Automatic frequency control (AFC) solves some of the drift problem, but manual retuning was often necessary. Since transmitter frequencies are stabilized, an accurate source of fixed, stable frequencies in the receiver would solve the problem.|$|E
2500|$|Robert Christgau {{was less}} enthusiastic, writing in MSN Music that Maxwell [...] "really {{believes}} {{that the quality of}} the sex is measured by its curlicues—and by {{how long it takes to}} come true"; he named [...] "Badhabits" [...] and [...] "Helpsomebody" [...] as the album's highlights. The Observers Paul Mardles was more critical, accusing Maxwell of exhibiting a [...] "fondness for cliche". Allison Stewart from The Washington Post called the album [...] "cerebral but impersonal" [...] and felt that it [...] "never quite breaks free of its self-imposed restraints". Entertainment Weeklys Leah Greenblatt said Maxwell's [...] "sentiments rarely transcend the boudoir — and listeners lulled by the album's unvaryingly sleek, high-gloss beats may just <b>drift</b> <b>off</b> to dreamland before they get there". In the Chicago Sun-Times, Jim DeRogatis wrote that several songs [...] "never rise above the level of pleasant background music", which he nonetheless found [...] "gorgeously recorded, tastefully arranged and beautifully played".|$|E
2500|$|As Raimi and his {{producing}} partner Robert Tapert progressed {{through various}} drafts, {{they realized that}} there was a potential franchise on their hands. Universal brought in screenwriting brothers Daniel and Joshua Goldin to work on the script. According to Daniel, they were presented with various drafts and [...] "lots of little story documents. There was just material everywhere; drafts seemed to go in many directions." [...] Goldin said that they [...] "spent {{a lot of time talking}} and pulling together a way of making the story work. I think that mostly we talked in terms of the nuts and bolts of the story." [...] The Goldins added new lines of dialogue, new characters and bits of action. The studio still wasn't satisfied so the Raimi brothers wrote drafts six through twelve before they had a shooting script. For Raimi, he wanted to emphasize Peyton/Darkman's arc over the course of the film. He said, [...] "I decided to explore a man's soul. In the beginning, a sympathetic, sincere man. In the middle, a vengeful man committing heinous acts against his enemies. And in the end, a man full of self-hatred for what he's become, who must <b>drift</b> <b>off</b> into the night, into a world apart from everyone he knows and all the things he loves." ...|$|E
