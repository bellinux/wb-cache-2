30|$|In {{addition}} to potential coastal spread from Fujian or Taiwan, {{there appears to}} be the spread of upland rain-fed rice and foxtail millets through the hills of south China (Guangdong, Guangxi) and into the upland zones of Southeast Asia, perhaps 2500 to 2000 BC (Castillo and Fuller 2010; Castillo 2011), ultimately from the Daxi-Qiujialing tradition of the middle Yangtze (Figs.  5, 6 and 7). In some regions, hinted at by recent archaeobotanical evidence from central Thailand (Weber et al. 2010), rice may have been abandoned for a focus on millets, with rice only becoming important again later on, as social complexity increased (see Castillo 2011). Whether this early spread included some early Austroasiatic speakers (AA) is unclear, but as suggested by Blench (2005) much of their shared vocabulary points to a hill cultivation and swidden culture, in which taro (Colocasia esculenta) would have been present alongside rice. This would seem at odds with the notion that they spread mainly along rivers (as per Higham 2003), but it may be that there were several different waves of Austroasiatic with a rice–millet wave overlying an earlier vegecultural wave, which might help to account for their widespread diversity. Might we also see some early Tai-Kadai speakers in this area? It is presumably to this period that western Austroasiatics, as pre-Proto-Munda speakers (the westward AA arrow in Fig.  7), also focused on islands of hill forest habitat and shifting cultivation moved into India towards the hills of Orissa (Fuller 2003). Once into areas near the Indian peninsula (perhaps broadly around 2000 BC or the centuries after), these farmers picked up native <b>Indian</b> <b>millets</b> and pulses and domesticated sheep, goat and zebu, in some cases apparently with connected early Dravidian vocabulary. At this time the plains were already occupied by more intensive, and probably denser, rice farmers. The potential role of a distinct domestication of aus rices connected to {{all or part of the}} Austroasiatic expansion needs research. The genetic evidence of McNally et al. (2009) indicates that aus genomes have seen substantial hybridization both with japonica and indica rice, which hints at a complex history of dispersal and cultural interactions involved in the spread of rice within and through the greater Bengal–Assam–Burma region.|$|R

40|$|Pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum) is {{the most}} drought {{tolerant}} of all domesticated cereals and can yield grain under rainfall as low as 200 to 250 mm (Bidinger and Hash, in press) making it the only reliably productive cereal in the driest rainfed regions of the arid and semi-arid tropics.

40|$|Pearl millet [Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R. Br. ] is an {{important}} cereal crop of arid and drier semiarid regions of south Asia and Africa valued for both grain and stover. Drought {{is the most common}} production constraint in these regions. Drought-resilient landraces are widely grown but their cultivation results in a yield penalty under favorable conditions. Both high productivity and adaptation to drought stress are essential for cultivars targeted for arid regions. This study was conducted to assess whether crosses between <b>Indian</b> pearl <b>millet</b> landraces and African elite composites offer any advantage over landraces. Twenty-five crosses produced by hybridizing five Indian landraces with five African elite composites were evaluated for three seasons (2006 – 2008) at Jodhpur, India. Improvement in crosses was quantified by measuring midparent heterosis and differences between crosses and their parental populations. On an average, crosses had significantly higher biomass and stover yield than both landraces and composites but had grain yield similar to the parental populations. There was differential magnitude and direction of midparent heterosis for various traits: heterosis was positive for biomass (10 %) and stover yield (12 %) but negative for harvest index (– 7 %). Although there was little overall heterosis for grain yield, a few individual crosses had significant grain yield heterosis up to + 33 %. More than one-third of the crosses had greater grain and stover yields than their landrace parent, resulting in a mean advantage of 18 % in their total crop value over landraces. These results indicate that hybridization of Indian landraces with elite composites based on African germplasm is an attractive and useful strategy to enhance biomass, stover, and grain productivity under drought-prone condition...|$|R
40|$|The paper investigates {{management}} and cultivar type effects on pearl millet stover yield and fodder quality. Sixteen pearl millet cultivars available to farmers in India {{were selected to}} represent three cultivar types: (1) traditional landrace germplasm from the arid/semi-arid millet production zones, (2) improved dual-purpose (grain and stover) open-pollinated varieties incorporating differing amounts of traditional landrace germplasm and (3) commercial, grain-type F 1 hybrids, bred {{for use in the}} arid/semi-arid zone. The cultivars were grown for 2 years (2000 and 2001) at high fertility (HF: 65 kg N ha- 1 and 18 kg P ha- 1) and low fertility (LF: 21 kg N ha- 1 and 9 kg P ha- 1). Within each fertility level high (HP) and low (LP) plant population densities were established by varying sowing rate and then thinning to the target populations (HP: 11 plants m- 2 and LP: 5 plants m- 2). Stover fodder quality traits (nitrogen concentration, sugar content, in vitro digestibility and metabolizable energy content) were analyzed using a combination of conventional laboratory analysis and near infrared spectroscopy. In general, fertility level and cultivar type had strong effects on grain and stover yields, and on a range of stover nutritional quality traits, but with significant year interactions. In contrast, the effect of population density on these variables was largely insignificant. Higher fertilizer application significantly increased grain and stover yields and stover nitrogen concentration, in vitro digestibility and metabolizable energy content. As a result, fertilization resulted in significant increases in the yields of both digestible and metabolizable stover. Landrace cultivars as a group produced higher quality fodder than modern hybrids, but at a significant cost in grain yield. Dual-purpose, open-pollinated cultivars were generally intermediate between the landraces and hybrids, in terms of both stover quality and grain yield, but produced the highest yields of both digestible and metabolizable stover.

Genetic resources of pearl millet including landraces, improved elite material, traditional cultivars, genetic stocks and wild relatives are very rich and, therefore, their characterization, documentation, conservation and distribution is very essential to ensure utilization in breeding programmes. This review assesses the status of pearl millet genetic resources, and identifi es the gaps in their collection, conservation and utilization. A total of 56, 580 accessions (including possible duplicates) of pearl millet in 70 genebanks of 46 countries across world are available. Landraces represent the largest part of pearl millet germplasm, followed by breeding/research material and wild relatives. The Indian national collection includes 7, 059 accessions at the National Bureau of Plant Genetic Resources (NBPGR), New Delhi. Global collections managed by ICRISAT comprise of 22, 888 pearl millet accessions from 51 countries. However, only a very small fraction of these accessions has been utilized so far. Critical assessment of collection for geographical and trait-diversity gaps using various GIS tools revealed several gaps in germplasm collection from Asian and African continents. Almost all cultivated accessions have been characterized for 23 morpho-agronomic characters following prescribed pearl millet descriptors. A large variation exists for phenotypic and phenological traits among available germplasm. In general, <b>Indian</b> pearl <b>millet</b> landraces have mainly contributed for earliness, high tillering, high harvest index and local adaptation; whereas African material has been a good source of bigger panicles, large seed size, and disease resistance.
