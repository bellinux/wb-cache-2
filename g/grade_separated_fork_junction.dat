40|$|Nucleation of {{promoter}} melting in bacteria is {{coupled with}} RNA polymerase (RNAP) binding to a conserved − 10 promoter element {{located at the}} upstream edge of the transcription bubble. The mechanism of downstream propagation of the transcription bubble to include the transcription start site is unclear. Here we introduce new model downstream <b>fork</b> <b>junction</b> promoter fragments that specifically bind RNAP and mimic the downstream segment of promoter complexes. We demonstrate that RNAP binding to downstream <b>fork</b> <b>junctions</b> is coupled with DNA melting around the transcription start point. Consequently, certain downstream <b>fork</b> <b>junction</b> probes can serve as transcription templates. Using a protein beacon fluorescent method, we identify structural determinants of affinity and transcription activity of RNAP-downstream <b>fork</b> <b>junction</b> complexes. Measurements of RNAP interaction with double-stranded promoter fragments reveal that the strength of RNAP interactions with downstream DNA plays {{a critical role in}} promoter opening and that the length of the downstream duplex must exceed a critical length for efficient formation of transcription competent open promoter complex...|$|R

40|$|The rate-limiting step in {{transcriptional}} initiation typically {{is opening}} the promoter DNA {{to expose the}} template strand. Opening is tightly regulated, but how it occurs is not known. These experiments identify an activity, recognition of specific DNA <b>fork</b> <b>junctions,</b> and {{suggest that it is}} critical to bacterial promoter opening. This activity is both sequence and structure specific; it recognizes the bases that constitute the upstream double-stranded/single-stranded boundary of the open complex. Promoter mutations known to reduce opening rates lead to comparable reductions in <b>fork</b> <b>junction</b> binding affinity. The activity acts to establish the upstream boundary of melted DNA and works in conjunction with two single-stranded DNA binding activities that recognize separately the two melted strands. The junction binding activity is contained within the sigma factor component of the holoenzyme. The activity occurs in both a typical prokaryotic transcription system and in a eukaryotic-like bacterial system that responds to enhancers and needs ATP. Thus DNA opening catalyzed by <b>fork</b> <b>junction</b> binding may occur in a variety of systems in which DNA must be opened to be copied...|$|R
50|$|Prior to the {{junction}} with the A14 being created, {{there was a}} simple <b>fork</b> <b>junction,</b> opened in 1971, joining the M6 to the M1. At that stage traffic, travelling from Birmingham on the M6, wishing to travel North and East left the M6 at junction 1 to join the A426 road.|$|R

25|$|The rock {{formation}} {{underlying the}} area around the Oconaluftee-Raven <b>Fork</b> <b>junction</b> contains some of the oldest exposed rocks in the Eastern United States. This formation, which is composed primarily of an Early Precambrian basement rock known as granite gneiss, was formed over a billion years ago from the gradual accumulation of marine sediment and igneous rocks.|$|R
50|$|On 8 August 1852 the Maryport and Carlisle Railway {{opened a}} west-to-north curve from <b>Forks</b> <b>Junction</b> to Citadel, {{enabling}} {{direct access to}} Carlisle without reversal; from this time goods traffic also used this new connection. The new approach crossed the Canal line on the level; the M&CR were required to appoint a person to make signals at the passage of trains.|$|R

50|$|The Frankston Bypass {{would be}} a 25 km freeway {{standard}} road with two lanes in each direction with a speed limit of 100 km/h. A full <b>grade</b> <b>separated</b> junction would be provided with EastLink and the Frankston Freeway, along with full <b>grade</b> <b>separated</b> diamond interchanges at Dandenong-Frankston Road, Cranbourne-Frankston Road, Golf Links Road, Frankston-Flinders Road, Bungower Road and Old Moorooduc Road / Mornington Peninsula Freeway. Interchanges at Skye Road and Mornington-Tyabb Road will have half diamond <b>grade</b> <b>separated</b> with northbound entry, southbound exit ramps. The cost was estimated between $500 million to $750 million.|$|R
50|$|While {{the overall}} quality of Tasmania's highway network has been {{constructed}} to a high standard, its <b>grade</b> <b>separated</b> freeway network is limited. In the past, Hobart and Launceston have each had comprehensive transport studies conducted, proposing <b>grade</b> <b>separated</b> freeways running through and around them. While some of these roads have been constructed, the majority are limited access featuring at-grade intersections. Devonport and Burnie are the only major population centres with freeway standard roads linking each other. There has been repeated proposals in recent years to fully upgrade the Midland Highway to <b>grade</b> <b>separated</b> freeway standards.|$|R

40|$|Bacterial RNA polymerases (RNAPs) are {{targets for}} antibiotics. Myxopyronin binds to the RNAP switch regions to block {{structural}} rearrangements needed for formation of open promoter complexes. Bacterial RNAPs containing the major variant p 54 factor are activated by enhancer-binding proteins (bEBPs) and transcribe genes whose products {{are needed in}} pathogenicity and stress responses. We show that (i) enhancer-dependent RNAPs help Escherichia coli {{to survive in the}} presence of myxopyronin, (ii) enhancer-dependent RNAPs par-tially resist inhibition by myxopyronin and (iii) ATP hydrolysis catalysed by bEBPs is obligatory for functional interaction of the RNAP switch regions with the transcription start site. We demonstrate that enhancer-dependent promoters contain two barriers to full DNA opening, allowing tight regula-tion of transcription initiation. bEBPs engage in a dual switch to (i) allow propagation of nucleated DNA melting from an upstream DNA <b>fork</b> <b>junction</b> and (ii) complete the formation of the transcription bubble and downstream DNA <b>fork</b> <b>junction</b> at the RNA synthesis start site, resulting in switch region-dependent RNAP clamp closure and open promoter complex formation...|$|R
40|$|The {{opening of}} {{specific}} segments of DNA {{is required for}} most types of genetic readout, including σ 70 -dependent transcription. To learn how this occurs, a series of single point mutations were introduced into σ 70 region 2. These were assayed for duplex DNA binding, DNA opening and DNA double strand–single strand <b>fork</b> <b>junction</b> binding. Band shift assays for closed complex formation implicated a series of arginine and aromatic residues within a minimal 26 amino acid region. Permanganate assays implicated two additional aromatic residues in DNA opening, known to form a parallel stack of the type that can accept a flipped-out base. Substitution for either of these aromatics {{had no effect on}} duplex probe recognition. However, when a single unpaired – 11 nucleotide is added to the probe, the mutants fail to bind appropriately to give heparin resistance. A model for DNA opening is presented in which duplex recognition by regions 2. 3, 2. 4 and 2. 5 of sigma positions the pair of aromatic amino acids, which then create the <b>fork</b> <b>junction</b> required for stable opening...|$|R
