5|$|A {{simplified}} {{version of}} the model was popularized by Paul Krugman in the 1990s in his book Peddling Prosperity. In this set up there are two firms, one foreign and one domestic which are considering entering a new export market in a third country (or possibly the whole world). The demand in the export market is such that if only one firm enters, {{it will make a}} profit, but if they both enter each will make a loss, perhaps because of initial set up, infrastructure, product development, marketing or other <b>fixed</b> <b>costs</b> of entry. The matrix below presents a stylized example of the game that the two firms are engaged in.|$|E

40|$|Intermediaries and {{wholesalers}} play {{an important}} role in international trade. This paper develops a model of international trade with heterogeneous firms that offers an explanation of the existence of wholesalers. All exporting firms have to pay a <b>fixed</b> <b>cost</b> of establishing a distribution network in the foreign market. However, wholesalers possess a technology different to normal manufacturing firms: they can buy manufacturing goods domestically and sell in foreign markets and handle more than one good. A wholesaler therefore faces an additional <b>fixed</b> <b>cost</b> which is convex and monotonically increasing in the number of goods it ships. The entry of wholesale firms leads to productivity sorting. The most productive firms export on their own, as in the standard model, by paying a <b>fixed</b> <b>cost</b> to do so, while the least productive firms do not export. However, a range of firms with intermediate productivity levels export through international wholesalers. The existence of wholesale firms increases total exports and the number of firms that export. Moreover, a higher <b>fixed</b> <b>cost</b> of exporting leads to (i) a higher share of exported goods that is distributed by wholesalers, and (ii) a higher share of total exports that is distributed by wholesalers. The higher the <b>fixed</b> <b>cost</b> of exporting, the more important is the role of wholesalers since these can spread the <b>fixed</b> <b>cost</b> across more than one good. The wholesale technology therefore exhibits economies of scope. Finally, a larger <b>fixed</b> <b>cost</b> of exporting increases the scope of each wholesaler firm. heterogeneous firms; international trade; intermediation; wholesalers...|$|R
25|$|In economics, {{marginal}} cost {{is the change}} in the opportunity cost that arises when the quantity produced is incremented by one unit, that is, it is the cost of producing one more unit of a good. Intuitively, {{marginal cost}} at each level of production includes the cost of any additional inputs required to produce the next unit. At each level of production and time period being considered, marginal costs include all costs that vary with the level of production, whereas other costs that do not vary with production are considered fixed. For example, the marginal cost of producing an automobile will generally include the costs of labor and parts needed for the additional automobile and not the <b>fixed</b> <b>costs</b> of the factory that have already been incurred. In practice, marginal analysis is segregated into short and long-run cases, so that, over the long run, all costs (including <b>fixed</b> <b>costs)</b> become marginal.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} unified {{analytical}} theory {{of production and}} capital structure of firms. It is extended from an analytical theory of production, whose main result is an analytical formula of variable cost of production {{as a function of}} <b>fixed</b> <b>cost</b> and uncertainty. Problems on capital structure can be naturally incorporated into the theory on production from a simple observation. Debt is fixed income for investors and hence <b>fixed</b> <b>cost</b> for issuing firms. The decision on capital structure is part of the decision process that determines the level of the <b>fixed</b> <b>cost</b> and variable cost of firms to achieve a high rate of return based on the understanding of current and future market conditions. The new theory offers a simple and parsimonious understanding to a broad range of empirical patterns documented in the literature. It reinforces the impression from other recent studies that puzzles in corporate finance often result not from “imperfect market” but rather from “imperfect theory”. capital structure, analytical theory, <b>fixed</b> <b>cost,</b> variable cost, imperfection...|$|R

During upturns, TSMC must ensure that it has enough production capacity to meet strong customer demand. However, during downturns, it must contend with excess capacity because of weaker demand, and the high <b>fixed</b> <b>costs</b> associated with its manufacturing facilities. As a result, the company's financial results tend to fluctuate with a cycle time of a few years.

40|$|Based on Bernard et al. ’s research, {{we focus}} on the Pareto optimal {{insurance}} design with the insured’s Rank-Dependent Expected Utility (RDEU). Compared with their previous work, our novelties are the more general <b>fixed</b> <b>cost</b> function of the insurer and the discussion of adverse selection and moral hazard.

So, we explore the more general <b>fixed</b> <b>cost</b> function including both the linear and nonlinear functions. On the other hand, we consider adverse selection and moral hazard which are involved by Bernard et al. Leading adverse selection and moral hazard into our research makes our results more practical and meaningful.
