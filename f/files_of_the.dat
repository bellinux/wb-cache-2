5|$|A six-page {{preview of}} the first issue was {{included}} with 3 Story: Secret <b>files</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Giant Man, a one-issue continuation of another work by Kindt, in April 2012. The same month, three short stories were released online for free to promote the series. They were later printed as issue #0 in November 2012.|$|E
5|$|After the Dream's {{bootloader}} was dumped, {{work began}} on modifying {{it so that}} it could install third-party firmware, and on converting official Android update files into a format that could be installed using the modified bootloader. Around the same time, Google made the Android Dev Phone 1 available for registered Android developers; the Dev Phone 1 was a SIM- and hardware-unlocked version of the HTC Dream that came pre-configured for superuser access to the internal <b>files</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> phone, allowing users to completely replace the bootloader and operating system.|$|E
5|$|In 2006 Wałęsa quit Solidarity {{in protest}} of the union's support of the ruling right-wing Law and Justice party, and Lech and Jarosław Kaczyński—twin {{brothers}} who had been prominent in Solidarity and were now serving as the country’s president and prime minister, respectively. The main point of disagreement was the Kaczyńskis’ focus on rooting out {{those who had been}} involved in communist rule and their party's attempt to make public all the <b>files</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> former communist secret police. Until then only members of the government and parliament had to declare any connection with the former security services. Wałęsa and his supporters argued the so-called transparency legislation advocated by the government might turn into a witch hunt and the more than 500,000 Poles who had possibly collaborated with the communist secret police could face exposure.|$|E

5|$|Little of {{this was}} true, {{but at the time}} the British {{had no way of knowing}} this. The <b>files</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Admiralstab in Berlin show that he was {{approached}} by N, rather than volunteering for intelligence service, entered their employment as early as May 1914 (rather than in August as he claimed), received regular pay rather than being unpaid, and intended to return to Berlin on completing his mission. It is unknown whether he really had any intention of going to the US, and there is no indication from the Admiralstab files that he had been asked to keep his controller's name a secret. After hearing Lody's evidence the court martial was adjourned until the following Monday.|$|E
5|$|Other offices {{included}} the sworn clerks, the examiners, the clerk to the barons, and the clerk to the King's Remembrancer. There were eight sworn clerks, so called {{because they were}} sworn officers of the court, who held their offices for life and worked under the Remembrancer. Each clerk acted as {{an attorney for the}} parties in court, and every party was required to employ one. The first clerk was known as the First Secondary, and administered oaths out of the Red Book of the Exchequer. The sworn clerks were assisted by 24side clerks, of whom each sworn clerk appointed three. Each side clerk studied under a sworn clerk for five years before practising himself, although under the sworn clerk's name. A side clerk had the chance of being promoted to sworn clerk, first by the Remembrancer and then by the sworn clerks themselves. The examiners were tasked with supervising depositions of witnesses, bringing the witness to a Baron, administering the oath and keeping the <b>files</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> depositions. In 1624 it was decided these examiners should be sworn officers of the court, and from then on each Baron had an examiner, who acted in the Baron's name. The office of examiner was dissolved in 1841, when the equity jurisdiction of the Exchequer came to an end. In addition to an examiner, each Baron had at least one clerk, who acted as their private secretary; although not paid, they were authorised to take fees for their work. The Chief Baron had two clerks, while the puisne Barons had one each. The King's Remembrancer also employed a clerk, who was also a secretary. He received no salary and was not a sworn officer of the court, meaning the Remembrancer could have him replaced at any time.|$|E
5|$|The II SS-Panzer Corps {{reported}} 842 soldiers killed, wounded, {{or missing}} for 12 July, and 2,672 for 12 to 16 July inclusive. Since the German forces controlled {{much of the}} Prokhorovka battlefield until 17 July, {{they were able to}} recover most of their disabled armoured vehicles. The II SS-Panzer Corps' logistics report for 12 July did not record any confirmed permanent tank losses. Other German sources show that three tanks of the II SS-Panzer Corps (two Panzer IVs and a Tiger) that were immobilized in the battlefield could not be subsequently recovered and therefore the permanent losses can only be adjusted to a possible maximum of three tanks for 12 July. A study by the US Army's Center for Strategy and Force Evaluation attributed six permanent tank losses, not counting Panzer I and Panzer II light tanks or German assault guns if any. Archival <b>files</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> II SS-Panzer Corps and 4th Panzer Army show that the II SS-Panzer Corps permanently lost 17 tanks and assault guns from 12 to 23 July inclusive, which therefore represents the maximum permanent losses the unit could have incurred for the engagement on 12 July up till the end of Operation Roland.|$|E

25|$|The Staats-Zeitung was {{particularly}} hard hit during the October 1871 Great Chicago Fire.

25|$|While in London, Riazanov read {{extensively}} {{from the}} <b>files</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> New York Tribune and other newspapers, collecting material written by Karl Marx and Frederick Engels for the periodical press.

25|$|In 2015, Briggs {{received}} {{another call}} from Universal, saying that Hellboy 3 had been cancelled and asking him and Mason {{to return for}} a reworked Silverlance, with producer Lawrence Gordon involved.

25|$|Win16 is the API for the first, 16-bit {{versions}} of Microsoft Windows.

The functions of Win16 API reside in mainly the core <b>files</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> OS: kernel.exe (or krnl286.exe or krnl386.exe), user.exe and gdi.exe.

25|$|Before {{the advent}} of digital online public access catalogs and the Internet, {{creating}} and maintaining a library's authority files were generally carried out by individual cataloging departments within each library.
