Since these were often aircraft crippled by battle damage and seeking asylum, resentment among Allied aircrew was considerable. The {{causes of the}} misdirected bombing attacks were bad weather, faulty equipment, incompetence, or excess pilot zeal, rather than malice or purposeful planning, {{but the lack of}} intent did not allay the sufferings and suspicions of the Swiss, and the embarrassment to the United States was considerable. A pattern of violation, diplomatic apology, reparation, and new violation ensued through much of the war, and grew in scope as Allied tactical forces neared Germany. It is still a matter of debate if these bombings occurred by accident, since U.S. strategic air forces had a standing order requiring visual identification before bombing any target within [...] of the Swiss frontier, or if some members of the Allies wanted to punish Switzerland for their economic and <b>industrial</b> <b>cooperation</b> with Nazi Germany. In particular, Switzerland permitted train transportation through its territory carrying matériel between Germany and Italy, which was readily visible from the air by Allied pilots.|$|E

Cooperation is not synonymous with <b>industrial</b> peace. <b>Cooperation</b> may take place even when bargaining leads to work stoppages; conversely, the mere absence of strikes is no evidence that there is labor-management cooperation. In the current period, there is a tendency to equate concessionary bargaining with labor-management cooperation. Demand for and acceptance of 2 ̆ 2 givebacks 2 ̆ 2 reflect economic pressures and relative bargaining strength and ought not to be interpreted as evidence of a cooperative relationship...|$|R
