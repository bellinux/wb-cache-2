30|$|Water {{absorption}} {{rate of the}} porous ceramics was {{in a range of}} 17.6 – 23.0 (± 0.5)% of their masses when a well pulverized mixture of volcanic ash and waste glass with a mass ratio of 5 : 2 was sintered with an extra amount (5 mass%) of wood charcoal at 900 – 1000  °C for 45 – 75  min.

The highest water absorption rate of 23.0 % was established when the mixture was sintered at 950  °C for 45  min. Comparable water absorption rate was achieved when the mixture was heated at 950  °C for 30  min, but the mechanical strength was not satisfactory. A prolonged sintering at 950  °C for more than 45  min resulted in an increased strength, but the absorption rate decreased to 20.2 % (60  min) and 19.5 % (75  min) since some pores were collapsed in the molten glassy phase to reduce the volume fraction of the 3 <b>D-channels.</b> When the mixture was sintered at 1000  °C, water absorption rates were 21.3 % (45  min) and 18.6 % (60  min), while most pores collapsed and disappeared after 75  min sintering. In this study, the highest water absorption rate of 23.0 (± 0.5)% was achieved when the mixture was thoroughly pulverized before the sintering to the grain size of less than 100 mesh. In contrast, it was 17 – 18 % when the pulverization was not enough. Five or 10 mass% of wood charcoal was investigated. As a result, 5 mass% of wood charcoal proved to have higher mechanical strength and higher water absorption rate being suitable for the practical use. Because of its complicated structure of 3 <b>D-channels,</b> the volcanic ash-derived porous ceramics showed higher water-holding property and higher mechanical strength.|$|R
5000|$|The other ISDN access {{available}} is the Primary Rate Interface (PRI), which is carried over an E1 (2048 kbit/s) {{in most parts}} of the world. An E1 is 30 'B' channels of 64 kbit/s, one 'D' channel of 64 kbit/s and a timing and alarm channel of 64 kbit/s. This is often referred to as 30B+2D. In North America PRI service is delivered on one or more T1 carriers (often referred to as 23B+D) of 1544 kbit/s (24 channels). A PRI has 23 'B' channels and 1 'D' channel for signalling (Japan uses a circuit called a J1, which is similar to a T1). Inter-changeably but incorrectly, a PRI is referred to as T1 because it uses the T1 carrier format.

Purification test using the porous ceramics (750  g) was successfully achieved in artificial waste water (15  L) containing 100  mL of milk and 15  mL of active sludge. In this case, BOD (biochemical oxygen demand) decreased from 740 – 800 to 2.6  mg L− 1 with a cleaning rate of 99.0 – 99.7 %, and COD (chemical oxygen demand) from 250 – 270 to 7.5 – 10  mg L− 1 with a cleaning rate of 96 – 99 % in one or 2  weeks (Nishida 2010). These cleaning rates were comparable to those determined from the experiments using “white corals” which are used for water purification in the fish tank or fish reserve; i.e., 99.6 % from the measurement of BOD and 97.8 % from COD.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{experiments}} are presented which {{belong to the}} ﬁeld of mesoscopic physics which is situated at {{the border between the}} macroscopic world with the laws of classical physics and the microscopic world where quantum mechanics rules. In quantum mechanics the properties of a physical system are described by a complex wave function. The length scale on which its phase is deﬁned is called the coherence length Lφ which is a good measure in order to deﬁne the border mentioned above. Even though this description would also ﬁt to optical measurement conﬁgurations with very large Lφ ’s, the notion mesoscopic physics is in general used for a sub-ﬁeld of solid state physics dealing with small devices in the micron and nanometer range. Mesoscopic physics is strongly related to the technological development of processing techniques which allows the controlled design of structures smaller than or in the range of the coherence length. This gives an additional possibility to study quantum mechanics by having a wider control over the parameters of the system. For instance the separation of the energy levels of a quantum dot can be controlled by varying its size. The base material used in this thesis are two-dimensional electron gases (2 DEG) which are conducting planes that establish on the sharp interface between two semiconductors with diﬀerent band gap. Applying a perpendicular magnetic ﬁeld, the electron transport is governed by one-dimensional channels {{along the edge of the}} border. This 1 <b>D-channels</b> can be considered as electron beams in a solid state environment. A description of sample preparation techniques is given in chapter 3. Electronic transport measurements are an often used tool for the characterization of mesoscopic devices. Applying a voltage V and measuring the mean current I gives the mean transmission through the device and a ﬁrst information about its electronic structure. The ﬂuctuations of the current around its mean value ∆I(t) = I(t) − I provide further information as the quantization of the charge. They are characterized by the variance ∆I 2 = I 2 − I 2, which is called noise. In addition, in multi-terminal devices, the sign of the cross correlation of ﬂuctuations between diﬀerent terminals, ∆I 1 ∆I 2, can provide additional information as for instance the particle statistics. The basics of electron transport in mesoscopic systems are described in chapter 2. In phase coherent systems, interference pattern develop. Single particle or amplitude interference arises from a superposition of single-particle processes and can be seen in the mean current I which is a function of the phase diﬀerence between the individual processes. It is also possible to probe the interference capability by two-particle or intensity interference. This is a consequence of a superposition of indistinguishable two-particle processes and appears in the cross correlation ∆I 1 ∆I 2 of the currents between two detectors and is as well a function of the phase diﬀerence between the two-particle processes. Textbook experiments concerning interference are mostly provided by the ﬁeld of optics. An example for amplitude interference is a double slit experiment where the light passing the two slits is superposed and gives rise to an interference pattern on the screen behind. The ﬁrst intensity interference experiments have been carried out by Hanbury Brown and Twiss in 1956 [1, 2] where they examined thermal light sources. In addition to an interference pattern they measured positive correlations, which is often labeled as photon bunching and was the starting point of the ﬁeld of quantum optics [3 – 5]. It is interesting to compare such experiments with similar ones carried out with electrons. Because electrons interact much more with their surrounding environment, they loose their phase coherence much faster and therefore the length scales of such experiments are much smaller. However, the technical progress allows the production of such small structures, leading to realizations of electronic equivalents [6 – 9] with negative sign of the cross correlation (electron antibunching). A detailed discussion is given in chapter 4. In chapter 5 the experiments of Henny et al. [6] and Oberholzer et al. [8],which used edge states as electron beams, are extended. Inspired by a proposal of Texier and Büttiker [10], which itself follows from a discussion of Refs. [6, 8], the impact of equilibration of current and current ﬂuctuations between such edge states due to inelastic scattering is investigated. A beam 3 splitter experiment is presented where for the ﬁrst time positive correlations have been measured in a normal-conducting Fermionic environment [11]. In the mentioned electron anti-bunching experiments [6 – 9] negative cross correlation have been shown but no interference pattern because the phase diﬀerence could not be changed in these experiments. In 2004, Samuelsson et al. [12] proposed a realization of a two-electron interferometer using again edge states as electron beams. This proposal was inspired by the electronic Mach-Zehnder interferometer reported by Ji et al. a year before [13]. While for an electronic Mach-Zehnder interferometer interference eﬀects are seen in the conductance, for the two-electron interferometer they only show up in intensity correlations. Compared to conductance measurements, correlation measurements are much more complex. The signal is much smaller which leads to time consuming averaging processes. In order to produce such a two-source electron interferometer the same technical challenges have to be overcome as for a single-particle Mach-Zehnder interferometer. These are e. g. the small working Ohmic contacts in the middle of the sample or the free-standing bridges. Hence, in chapter 6 of this thesis a Mach-Zehnder interferometer has been produced and characterized in a ﬁrst step in order to realize a two-source electron interferometer in a second step. Compared to other implementations of electronic Mach-Zehnder interferometers [13 – 16] the visibility has been investigated for a broad range of transmission values revealing an unexpected DC bias dependence. Electronic Mach-Zehnder interferometer are very sensitive to a change of the phase diﬀerence between the two interferometer arms. Hence, as soon as they are understood good enough, they could be nice phase sensor devices to probe decoherence eﬀects. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} the electronic states of underdoped La_{ 2 -x}Sr_xCuO_ 4 (LSCO) {{by using a}} microscopic model, i. e., t-t'-t''-J model, containing vertical charge stripes. The numerically exact diagonalization calculation on small clusters shows the consistent explanation of the physical properties in the angle-resolved photoemission, neutron magnetic scattering and optical conductivity experiments such as the antiphase domain and quasi-one-dimensional charge transport. The pair correlation function of the <b>d-channel</b> is suppressed by the stripes. These results demonstrate a crucial role of the stripes in LSCOComment: 4 pages, 4 EPS figures, revised version, to appear in Phys. Rev. Lett. Vol. 82, No. 25, 199...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe heme-copper oxidases may {{be divided}} into three categories, A, B, and C, which include {{cytochrome}} c and quinol-oxidising enzymes. All three types {{are known to be}} proton pumps and are found in prokaryotes, whereas eukaryotes only contain A-type cytochrome c oxidase in their inner mitochondrial membrane. However, the bacterial B- and C-type enzymes have often been reported to pump protons with an H+/e- ratio of only one half of the unit stoichiometry in the A-type enzyme. We will show here that these observations are likely {{to be the result of}} difficulties with the measuring technique together with a higher sensitivity of the B- and C-type enzymes to the protonmotive force that opposes pumping. We find that under optimal conditions the H+/e- ratio is close to unity in all the three heme-copper oxidase subfamilies. A higher tendency for proton leak in the B- and C-type enzymes may result from less efficient gating of a proton pump mechanism that we suggest evolved before the so-called <b>D-channel</b> of proton transfer. There is also a discrepancy between results using whole bacterial cells vs. phospholipid vesicles inlaid with oxidase with respect to the observed proton pumping after modification of the <b>D-channel</b> residue asparagine- 139 (Rhodobacter sphaeroides numbering) to aspartate in A-type cytochrome c oxidase. This discrepancy might also be explained by a higher sensitivity of proton pumping to protonmotive force in the mutated variant.

40|$|Numerical {{solutions}} to the equations describing Ericksen-Leslie dynamic theory for 2 D nematic liquid crystal flows subject to a magnetic field are obtained. The governing equations are solved by a finite difference technique based on the GENSMAC methodology. The resulting numerical technique was verified by comparing numerical solutions for 2 <b>D-channel</b> flow by means of mesh refinement. To demonstrate the capabilities of this method, the flow of a nematic liquid crystal in a planar 1 : 4 expansion was simulated. Calculations were performed for various Ericksen and Reynolds numbers. The results showed that {{an increase in the}} Ericksen number caused the appearance of lip and corner vortices...|$|E

The proposed technique combines finite mixture modeling for probability density function estimation, copulas for multivariate distribution modeling and a Markov random field (MRF) approach to Bayesian classification. The novelty {{of this research is}} in introduction of copulas to classification of <b>D-channel</b> SAR, with D> 2, within the mainframe of finite mixtures - MRF approach. This generalization results in a flexible and well performing multichannel SAR classification technique.

40|$|High {{harmonic}} generation (HHG) {{is used to}} measure the spectral phase of the recombination dipole matrix element (RDM) in argon over a broad frequency range that includes the 3 p Cooper minimum (CM). The measured RDM phase agrees well with predictions based on the scattering phases and amplitudes of the interfering s- and <b>d-channel</b> contributions to the complementary photoionization process. The reconstructed attosecond bursts that underlie the HHG process show that the derivative of the RDM spectral phase, the group delay, does not have a straight-forward interpretation as an emission time, in contrast to the usual attochirp group delay. Instead, the rapid RDM phase variation caused by the CM reshapes the attosecond bursts. Comment: 5 pages, 5 figure...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} the Rashba-type spin splitting in the Shockley surface states on Au(111) and Ag(111) surfaces, based on first-principles calculations. By turning {{on and off}} spin-orbit interaction (SOI) partly, we show that although the surface states are mainly of p-orbital character with only small d-orbital one, <b>d-channel</b> SOI determines the splitting and the spin direction while p-channel SOI has minor and negative effects. The small d-orbital character of the surface states, present even without SOI, varies linearly with the crystal momentum k, resulting in the linear k dependence of the splitting, the Hallmark of the Rashba type. As a way to perturb the d-orbital character of the surface states, we discuss effects of electron and hole doping to the Au(111) surface. Comment: 7 pages, 4 figure...|$|E
