40|$|A {{desk study}} {{has been carried out}} in order to develop a {{conceptual}} model for the erosion of <b>inner</b> <b>dike</b> slopes with reinforced grass cover. Based on the results the following can be concluded: The presence of a geosynthetic in a grass slope can be taken into account in the EPM method by increasing the critical flow velocity. In particular, a factor Cgeo has been added to the Mirtskhoulava formula. The value of Cgeo in this formula is unknown. Prediction of the failure of a reinforced grass cover did not result in a failure as the erosion is less than the thickness of the layer on top of the geosynthetic. In summary, it is recommended to continue with the results obtained, because the elements for a prediction are available although a correct prediction is not possible yet. In this respect it is recommended to incorporate the failure mechanism of slope material underneath the geosynthetic which probably can be treated in a similar way as geosynthetics in erosion control applications. The Mirtskhoulava formula is valid for the stability of individual elements, but probably there exists a relation with the Edelman-Joustra method for the stability against sliding based on the Mohr-Coulombrelation. It is recommended to attempt to develop this relationship because it might link the stability of individual elements with the stability of soil layers. Furthermore, it is recommended to develop depth-dependant strength parameters in accordance with the observed strength as shown in Figure 4. 2 : high strength at the surface due to roots, then decreasing to a depth of about 10 cm due to decreasing number of roots, and then increasing again due to clay properties.

40|$|This {{document}} {{reports the}} progress of Delft Cluster project CT 04. 30 "Safety against flooding" till June 2009. Fundamental knowledge from the project {{has resulted in a}} large number of scientific publications, PhD theses and MSc theses. Work package A 1 in particular has resulted in high-profile scientific publications, immediately awarded with high scores on the citation index. Furthermore, the project has provided education and training as scientists and practising engineers to a large group of PhD and MSc students. Research knowledge from the project has been implemented in models, such as Delft 3 D, and has enhanced the expertise of staff of Delft Cluster institutes. For instance, Jos Dijkman has been appointed, as the only foreigner, in an American review commission under the National Academy of Engineering and the National Research Council, charged with the review of all post-Katrina studies by the Interagency Performance Evaluation Taskforce. Applied knowledge from the project has been used and disseminated in various ways. Optical glass fibre cables from work package A 1 provided the spinoff of a method to monitor groundwater upwelling at the toe of <b>inner</b> <b>dike</b> slopes. Consultancies (DHV, HKV) now routinely apply morphological models of work package A 2 to P KB Room for the River measures. Work package A 3 has established the probability of occurrence of super storm surges with greater accuracy by reconstructing storm-surge levels from the last 10, 000 years using novel deposit dating methods. Findings from work package B are to be incorporated in guidelines for flood defence design and evaluation, thus affecting the evaluations for the "Hydraulische Randvoorwaarden". The system behaviour identified and analyzed in work package C turns out to be so important for the overall safety of dike rings, that it will inevitably lead to the need of adopting a new safety philosophy on a short term. Knowledge from work package A 1 has been implemented in the hydrology curriculum of Delft University of Technology. Knowledge from work package A 2 has been included in the PAO course on Room for the River...|$|E
40|$|Hardly any flood defence {{system is}} a {{continuous}} dike system, since it is often interrupted by non-water retaining structures, as for example stairs, buildings, roads, fences and trees. Also larger hydraulic structures as floodgates and sluices are sometimes situated in the dike alignment. The transition between these different objects and the dikes with grass covers is still an area that receives limited attention in current methods for design and safety assessment in the Netherlands and other countries. The problem at hand is that during flood disasters in New Orleans, Thailand and France, these transitions appeared to be vulnerable spots in the flood defence system. The erosion process of the grass cover developed fast around objects or structures which {{were placed on the}} inner slope and suffered from wave overtopping. The objective of this thesis is to gain insight into the vulnerability of transitions between dikes with grass covers and (non-) water retaining objects during overtopping of flood defences. This is achieved by testing the applicability of current erosion models for the structural transition zone. The defined erosion models are separated in a load and strength side, which are expanded with a load and strength parameter to define the influence of an object on the <b>inner</b> <b>dike</b> slope. For the impact zone of the wave is chosen for two models that use the pressure load of the wave as input, because the velocity is (nearly) zero at this point. In the zone next to the object or structure is chosen for a flow erosion model, because the velocity is assumed to be an important mechanism to initiate erosion. Numerical analyses are performed on the load side of the erosion process by the program ComFLOW. This model should determine the pressures and velocities that occur around an object. This is validated with a field experiment that used a similar set-up. It appears the model calculates the velocities on the slope accurately, but {{due to the lack of}} friction in the model this velocity accelerates too much on the transition between the slope and the horizontal part. However, it does show that the velocity next to the object has no peak acceleration, like was expected. Therefore the assumption that a velocity difference influences the load on the grass cover next to an object seems not plausible. For the field experiment with the overtopping simulator, two pressure gauges were installed in the impact zone in front of the object and on the slope. These showed with respect to measurements on the slope, besides a difference in the hydrostatic pressures, a large difference in the dynamic pressures. Conclusions with respect to the actual erosion around the object could not be drawn, because due to gaps in the soil in front of the object; this area was filled with concrete. The numerical modelling and field experiments led to erosion models for zone A and B, including the load and strength parameters for the influence of a structure. As a first validation of these models, the field experiment at the Vechtdijk is used. This experiment consisted of a slope with a tree close to the toe. For the erosion in the wave impact zone, it appeared the model predicted the time needed to reach the different erosion states quite well. However, the grass quality was assumed as average, which was not investigated during the experiment. Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E

Wave overtopping can be characterised by mean overtopping discharges but this does not provide information on individual wave overtopping events. This study was focused on parameters related to individual wave overtopping events with a low probability of exceedance. Measurements of velocities and the thickness of water-layers have been performed at the crest and <b>inner</b> slope of <b>dikes.</b> The height, width and roughness of the crest have been varied and also the angle and roughness of the inner slope. Based on these tests prediction formulae have been derived for velocities, the thickness of water-layers, and low-exceedance wave overtopping discharges. The estimates of these parameters can be used to characterise the wave loading on the crest and <b>inner</b> slope of <b>dikes,</b> especially as the characteristic wave loading for the initial phase of breaching of dikes initiated by erosion at the crest or inner slope. Besides above mentioned parameters also other measurements have been performed. This includes pressures at the seaward slope, mean wave overtopping discharges, percentages of overtopping waves, and volumes of water within individual overtopping waves...|$|R

The tests show the behaviour of various <b>inner</b> slopes of <b>dikes,</b> embankments or levees under simulation of wave overtopping, up to a mean overtopping discharge of 125 l/s per m.

40|$|Recently, {{formulae}} {{have been}} derived for maximum flow depths and velocities {{on the crest}} and <b>inner</b> slope of <b>dikes</b> or levees at wave overtopping. Two independent physical model test programs in different wave flumes showed, however, a large difference in the results. The present paper clarifies this discrepancy and shows that the empirical coefficients are dependent on the gradient of the outer slope. Subsequently, a formula for the overtopping time was created, based on the difference between fictive wave run-up and crest freeboard. The overtopping time appeared {{not to be a}} function of the outer slope. The variation of flow depth and velocity in time can be approached with a linear function.

40|$|Although dikes {{are very}} {{important}} they can provide more than only water safety. We have a future with possible sea level rise and dikes will need to become higher. The land protected by the dike will lose contact with the water. It is time to rethink the dike as a solitude element and create new possibilities to provide new space in dense urban environments, new connections between water and land and better use of land in a sustainable, durable way. Building within the dike creates beautiful architectural challenges and opportunities with the play of the levels, the view on landscape and river, on top of and behind the dike, the play of the light, the contradictions in light and dark, closed and openness. All this {{can be used to}} create areas with distinct architectural atmospheres. The funeral center uses these elements to create spaces for the needs of the different faces of a service. Three kilometres from the ‘Rotterdam Blaak’ station in the bend of the river Meuse lies the ‘Eschpolder’, enclosed within two dikes. Around 1970 polluted slit was stored in the area on top of which nature took over and created a beautiful landscape. The funeral center is situated along the outer dike and has certain elements within the natural area, such as an urn cemetery and a meditative building. Along the <b>inner</b> <b>dike</b> there is ample space for recreational functions. For example boat rentals from which one can paddle along the islands. The project creates a new place for remembrance, close to the city, which can also be used for recreation and nature experience. This gives the Eschpolder a new character, where death is part of life. A place for grieving, for religion and beauty, but also for recreation, relaxation and fun. Just like the water, attractive and dangerous at the same time, it is two sided. Within the building is a water defense wall of sheet piles which will take over the function of the dike and provide water safety for the building and the land behind. The rusting surface has a beautiful weather beaten face which is a reference to the beauty and acceptance of decline. The water defense wall is designed for 5, 0 m. NAP. This provides a large safety factor which will ensure adequate protection into the distant future. The openings in the wall can be closed in emergencies. The water defense wall divides the dike into two sides. The land side is related to the functions of the building that are more private, about contemplation, remembrance and grieving in a protected environment behind the dike. The river side relates to the everyday life, the fact that one has to go on without the deceased and that life goes on. The building is approached on top of the dike. When moving through the building the floorlevel lowers into the dike. The moment of contemplation in the auditorium lies safely behind and within the dike and has a view to the polder. The service is followed by the ritual of bearing the coffin along the dike, to the crematorium building, into the earth. When one proceeds to the condolence the floor level rises {{up to the top of}} the dike, the water, the wind, life goes on. The project can be used for inspiration and to promote the discussion on multifunctional use of dikes. It shows the possibilities of the Eschpolder, functioning as a beautiful and integral part of the city of Rotterdam. The funeral center gives the Rotterdam people a place for a pleasant experience of parting in a beautiful ambiance. Delta InterventionsArchitectureArchitectur...|$|E
40|$|This thesis shows {{a set of}} {{equations}} {{that define}} the micro-stability and macro-stability of reinforced grass revetments with geosynthetics on <b>inner</b> <b>dike</b> slope during an overtopping event. At micro-stability level, it has been analyzed that the equilibrium in a soil particle using the criterion of incipient motion of soil particle. The forces in normal direction to water flow are considered the most {{important to keep in}} equilibrium the soil particles of the reinforced grass revetment. As unstable forces are considered: Lift force, this force can be defined in function of depth-averaged relative turbulence intensity and averaged-velocity (Hoffmans’ Model, 2006). Likewise, the averaged-velocity can be defined in function of concentration factor of stems, bent vegetation height and vegetation height (Carollo’s Model, 2005). As stable forces are taken account: Friction force due to cohesion stress, the cohesion forces produced by root and geosynthetic in the soil are assumed in the same direction of the water flow and they cause a frictional forces in the normal direction of water flow when the particle tend to detach. Also, gravity force, as it is referred to submerged weight of soil particle. The stability equation of a soil particle of reinforced grass revetment is deduced from the application of the equilibrium between these forces; it means unstable forces must be equal or less than stable forces. At macro-stability level, it has been analyzed the acting forces on reinforced grass revetment during an overtopping event has been applied to the equilibrium in the system. The diagram of free body of reinforced grass revetment is divided in two wedges and identified like active and passive wedges (Koerner’s model 1991). The wedge located at top of the slope exerts an active function in the system that means it tends to push away the soil of the revetment so that is in the toe of the slope. The other wedge located at toe exerts a passive function that consist to hold the active wedge giving equilibrium to the system. The forces taken account in the diagram of free body of both wedges are: the weight of the soil, the shear force of the water, the cohesion forces produced by cohesive soil, roots and geosynthetics, reactive forces located in the failure plane and pressure forces between the passive and active wedges. To define the stability of the system, the safety factor is introduced in the friction angles of different soils and soil-geosyntethic besides in the cohesion produced by root and geosynthetics. The polygon method is applied in the forces acting on each wedge and it is deduced in a quadratic equation in function of safety factor. A safety factor higher than one defines a stable system. The geosynthetic analyzed are the geogrid and geocell. Unlike geogrid for the geocell an additional force is considered and this is the shear force which is generated in the contact between geocell wall and soil and it is in normal direction of the surface. This additional force is independent of the geocell tension; it means the geocell {{does not need to be}} in tension to help the stability of the system. In the case of geogrid could not be affirm the same. With much analysis of micro-stability as macro-stability of the system, the cohesive forces produced by roots and geosynthetics are important. In this thesis is described in brief mathematical models, based on equation’s coulomb, which defined these cohesions. The cohesion produced by root in the soil is calculated using the simple root perpendicular model (Model of Wu et al, 1979). The additional cohesion produced by the geosynthetic uses the model of Jewell, 1980, to be calculated. Both cohesion models are based on the tension stress of the root or geosynthetic located inside of the soil layer produce shear stress in this layer. The shear stress could be in any plane but it is used the failure plane. This shear stress in the failure plane is composed of two components, one of the component is the projection of tension stress in the failure plane and the other is the friction stress produced by the normal component to the failure plane of tension. The tension of roots and geosynthetics are important in both cohesion models. The tension of root is easily to obtain from laboratory. Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
