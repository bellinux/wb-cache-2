25|$|An {{advantage}} of index-based insurance {{is that it}} can potentially be delivered at lower cost. A significant barrier that hinders uptake of claim-based insurance is the high transaction cost for searching for prospective policyholders, negotiating and administering contracts, verifying losses and determining payouts. Index insurance eliminates the loss verification step, thereby mitigating a significant transaction cost. A second {{advantage of}} index-based insurance is that, because it pays an indemnity based on the reading of an index rather than individual losses, it eliminates much of the fraud, moral hazard and adverse selection, which are common in classical claim-based insurance. A further advantage of index insurance is that payments based on a standardized and indisputable index also allow for a fast <b>indemnity</b> <b>payment.</b> The <b>indemnity</b> <b>payment</b> could be automated, further reducing transaction costs.|$|E
2500|$|Since American Secretary of State John Hay {{suggested}} that the US$30 million plus Boxer Rebellion indemnity money paid to the United States was excessive, in 1909, President Roosevelt then obtained congress approval to reduce the Qing Dynasty [...] <b>indemnity</b> <b>payment</b> by $10.8 million USD, {{on the condition that}} the said fund was to be used as scholarship for Chinese students to study in the United States. Using this fund, the Tsinghua College (清華學堂 Qīnghuá Xuétáng) was established in Beijing, China, on 22 April 1911 on the site of a former royal garden belonging to a prince. It was first a preparatory school for students later sent by the government to study in the United States. The faculty members for sciences were recruited by the YMCA from the United States and its graduates transferred directly to American schools as juniors upon graduation. In 1925, the school established its College Department and started its research institute on Chinese Study.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impact of <b>indemnity</b> <b>payments</b> from index {{insurance}} on the asset recovery of households after a catastrophic weather disaster occurs. Our {{focus is on the}} Index-Based Livestock Insurance (IBLI) in Mongolia. We analyze the effect of IBLI <b>indemnity</b> <b>payments</b> after a once-in- 50 -year winter disaster struck Mongolia over 2009 / 10. The database for our analysis is three waves of a household panel survey implemented in western Mongolia. We employ the bias-corrected matching estimator to account for selection into purchasing IBLI. Results indicate that pastoralist households purchasing IBLI before the shock recover faster from shock-induced asset losses than comparable non-insured households. We find a significant, positive and economically large effect of IBLI <b>indemnity</b> <b>payments</b> on herd size one and two years after the shock. In the medium term - three and four years after the shock - the effect slowly vanishes. Results are robust to defining post-shock livestock recovery in different ways, varying the number of matches per observation, the choice of covariates, and the use of alternative propensity score estimators. An analysis of shock coping strategies as well as complementary qualitative interviews conducted in the field suggest that <b>indemnity</b> <b>payments</b> help herders to avoid selling and slaughtering animals and smooth their productive asset base. Also, IBLI appears to have relieved households from credit constraints. Our study is among the first to provide evidence on the beneficial effects of index insurance after a weather shock in a developing economy...|$|R

40|$|Averting or {{limiting}} {{the outbreak of}} infectious disease in domestic livestock herds is an economic and potential human health issue that involves both the government and individual livestock producers. Producers have private information about preventive biosecurity measures they adopt on their farms prior to outbreak (ex ante moral hazard), and following outbreak they possess private information {{about whether or not}} their herd is infected (ex post adverse selection). We investigate how <b>indemnity</b> <b>payments</b> can be designed to provide incentives to producers to invest in biosecurity and report infection to the government, while simultaneously addressing the information asymmetry between producers and the government. We show how addressing the adverse selection problem leads to a risk-sharing tradeoff in the moral hazard problem. We compare the relative magnitude of the first- and second-best levels of biosecurity investment and <b>indemnity</b> <b>payments</b> to further demonstrate the tradeoff between risk-sharing and efficiency, and we discuss the implications for status quo U.
