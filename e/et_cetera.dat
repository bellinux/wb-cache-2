The winner of the stage received one point, the second rider two points, <b>et</b> <b>cetera.</b> After the eighth stage, only 16 cyclists were remaining, and the results from the first eight stages were recalculated, with only the remaining cyclists, and the points were redistributed among the remaining riders in accordance with their positions in those stages.|$|E
5|$|Under HCI's Integrated Programme, the Sabbatical Programme {{is offered}} whereby {{students}} from Secondary 1 to 4 go on one week sabbatical courses in each {{term in the}} first semester (Terms 1 and 2). The programme is unique in allowing {{the majority of the}} school populace to put aside formal curricular lessons for a week in pursuit of their passions or interests. Sabbaticals offered are of a wide variety, in categories as defined by the school: Arts & Aesthetics, Chinese Studies, Humanities, English & Literature, Leadership, Technology, Science and Math, Camps and Student Exchange; they are essentially courses for students to opt for, such as beginner guitar and songwriting lessons, professional music production, Model United Nations training camps, football friendlies with other schools, <b>et</b> <b>cetera.</b> Also, the school requires students to use the specifically designed Online Bidding System - the i-ComP - to organise their sabbatical plans. Students who accumulate demerit points as a result of various offences are penalised in their sabbatical bidding or are recommended for corrective work order.|$|E
5|$|Uxmal is a Mayan {{city in the}} Puuc Hills of Yucatán Peninsula, Mexico. The Governor's Palace at Uxmal {{is often}} used as an exemplar of why it is {{important}} to combine ethnographic and alignment data. The palace is aligned with an azimuth of 118° on the pyramid of Cehtzuc. This alignment corresponds approximately to the southernmost rising and, with a much greater precision, to the northernmost setting of Venus; both phenomena occur once every eight years. By itself this would not be sufficient to argue for a meaningful connection between the two events. The palace has to be aligned in one direction or another and why should the rising of Venus be any more important than the rising of the Sun, Moon, other planets, Sirius <b>et</b> <b>cetera?</b> The answer given is that not only does the palace point towards significant points of Venus, it is also covered in glyphs which stand for Venus and Mayan zodiacal constellations. Moreover, the great northerly extremes of Venus always occur in late April or early May, coinciding with the onset of the rainy season. The Venus glyphs placed in the cheeks of the Maya rain god Chac, most likely referring to the concomitance of these phenomena, support the west-working orientation scheme.|$|E

60|$|Having said this, he {{was forced}} to console Fanny in her shame at her own kind attempt at this gentle little {{feminine}} subterfuge. He gratified her, however, by not interfering with her hospitable instincts of doing honour to and entertaining his brother, for whose sake her first approach to a dinner party was given; a very small one, but treated by her and her household as a far more natural occurrence than was any sort of entertainment at the Homestead.

Mrs. Curtis was less easy in her mind, her housewifely soul questioned the efficiency of her niece's establishment, and she was moreover persuaded that Lord Keith must be bent on inspecting his brother's choice, while even Rachel felt as if the toils of fate were being drawn round her, and let Grace embellish her for the dinner party, in an odd sort of mood, sometimes rejecting her attempts at decoration, sometimes vouchsafing a glance at the glass, chiefly to judge whether her looks were really as repellently practical and intellectual as she had been in the habit of supposing. The wreath of white roses, which she wore for the first time, certainly had a pleasing and softening effect, and she was conscious that she had never looked so well; then was vexed at the solicitude with which her mother looked her over, and fairly blushed with annoyance at the good lady's evident satisfaction.|$|R
60|$|After {{a little}} confusion, Mr. Henderson's old Mrs. Golding {{proved to be}} Mrs. Frost's young Mrs. Golding; and, on the eager inquiry whether she were present, ensued the melancholy answer that she was deaf and infirm, only just able to smile with {{pleasure}} at the tidings of her old friend's restoration; and the daughter, whom she could only just believe to be grown up, was a worn, elderly woman. Not even the one heartfelt greeting was without sadness; and Clara likewise met with one solitary satisfaction, and that a very mixed one. Mr. Danvers, the young curate, whom Oliver had not thought worth presenting, was hailed by Fitzjocelyn as if their slight Oxford acquaintance had been an intimacy, and was by him introduced to Clara as belonging to James's college. She frankly held out her hand, but was discomfited by his inquiry for her brother, whom {{he had hoped to}} meet. Louis said something about not expecting the schoolmaster abroad in the half-year, and Clara was not at all grateful to him for relieving her from the embarrassment, but regarded the reply as a shabby prevarication, and was much inclined to speak out; but Louis was drawing the curate into conversation about the population, and hearing but a desponding history. It was interrupted when Oliver, after waiting in vain for more distinguished company, began to marshal his guests to the grand hall, paved with black and white marble, and with a vast extent of wall and window, decked with evergreens, flags, and mottoes. Here a cold collation was prepared, with a band in a music-gallery above, and all the <b>et</b> <b>ceteras</b> dear to county papers.

40|$|One of the {{purposes}} of this book is to address conflict construing in the erroneous comments or belief that "Latin is a dead language". This fallacious comment that “Latin is a dead language” potentially contradicts the use of some viable aspects in Literatures of Sciences, Humanities and Social Sciences today. Scholars are never in favour of the generalization that all has been said about any subject matter, and this is why research continues forever. It is pertinent to know that there are many languages in the world which are only spoken by considerable number of speakers but without their orthographic forms. And on the other hand, there are also a few languages which have written form without a spoken form and such language where this is witnessed is the Latin language. Whether spoken or written, Latin language has survived in a written form and it is still regarded as a language. We can also see by analyzing some major words of some Physical Sciences, Arts and Humanities and Social Sciences literatures, using etymological lexicon analysis (Applied Linguistics), we would realise that nearly seventy per cent of word-contents of these literatures originated from Latin. For instance, the system of classification of living things in Biological Science used today is still based on that introduced by a Swiss Scientist called Car Von Linne (1707 - 1778). His name was latinized to Carolous Linnaeus, simply because his classification is done in Latin language whereby the names of organisms as classified in his work are still in use in the same manner till date. The system is called binomial system of nomenclature. In this system, each organism or living thing is given two names, hence the term binomial nomenclature. The first name is generic name (common to the genius) and the second name is the specific name. Examples of scientific names of some organisms as coined from Latin words are cited below: I. Man homo sapiens (homo is man, while sapiens is wise) Lion panthera leo (panther is leopard and leo is lion) Maize zea mays Rat rattus rattus Dog canis domestica House fly musca domestica Rice oryza sativa Orange citrus sinensis; <b>et</b> <b>ceteras</b> Also, in Mathematics; words like formula, formulae, radius, radii, parabilis, parabile, parabila (from this, the word ‘parabola’ was coined), algebra and so on are still present. Phenomena like these have provoked scholastic writings on various topics: Is Latin a dead language? Latin: Influenced French, Spanish, English, Italian, Portuguese, Latin: Catholic Ritual language, Latin: Medical, Biological, Botanical, Zoological language. As part of the contributions to the argument that Latin is not a dead language but an everlasting theoretical language that aids proficiency in Science and Humanity, ‘Lawyers' Latin’ is being brought to fore in order to reveal some ignorantly concealed (aliud celare, aliud tacere) but vital information that are to make learning of Law and English Language simple. Latin passages, conjugations, inflections, declensions and other good examples are utilised and varieties of exercises are provided for ample practice on different aspects of the Latin works. The extracted passages (Latin passages) that are used are veritable tools in the development of decoding (denotation) skills most especially in Latin maxims expressions, Law of Contract, Law of Evidence, Conflict of laws, Land law, Jurisprudence, Equity and Trusts Classes. Most of these passages have African/Roman backgrounds, and are within the common environmental word items and of the Law parlance which formed part of natural daily practice. Many valuable expressions, lexical items which had enhanced the performance of students in English Language, Sciences and particularly the study of Law have been extensively applied in this work...|$|R
