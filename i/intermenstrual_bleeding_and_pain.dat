40|$|Laparoscopic {{myomectomy}} {{offers a}} real benefit to infertile patients with uterine fibroids and peritoneal adhesions. The procedure requires a skilled surgeon and laparoscopy technique to minimize adhesion formation and other proven benefits. Restrictions arise since this procedure requires power morcellation for fibroid tissue extraction. Two years ago, the Food and Drug Administration in the United States of America (FDA) issued the alert on power morcellation for uterine leiomyomas, addressing {{the risk of}} malignant cell spreading within the abdominal cavity (actual risk assessment from 1 in 360 to 1 in 7400 cases). We review a 30 -year-old female, without previous gestations, hypermenorrhea, <b>intermenstrual</b> <b>bleeding,</b> <b>and</b> chronic pelvic <b>pain.</b> Transvaginal ultrasound reports multiple fibroids in the right portion of a bicornuate uterus. Relevant history includes open myomectomy 6 years before and a complicated appendectomy, developing peritonitis within a year. Laparoscopy revealed multiple adhesions blocking uterine access, a bicornuate uterus, and myomas in the expected site. Myomectomy was performed utilizing power morcellation with good results. FDA recommendations have diminished this procedure’s selection, converting many to open variants. This particular case was technically challenging, requiring morcellation, and safety device deployment was impossible, yet the infertility issue was properly addressed. Patient evaluation, safety measures, and laparoscopy benefits may outweigh the risks in particular cases as this one...|$|R

30|$|Fibroids or leiomyomas are benign {{encapsulated}} tumors {{made up of}} uterine muscular tissues. They {{are extremely}} common and are found in up to 80 % of all women {{by the age of}} 50  years [1]. The incidence of myomas in infertile women without any obvious cause of infertility is estimated to be between 1 and 2.4 % [2, 3].Only 5 – 10 % of fibroids are estimated to be submucous [4], but they are often symptomatic. Common symptoms include menorrhagia, <b>intermenstrual</b> <b>bleeding,</b> <b>and</b> subfertility. Submucous fibroids are classified according to the European Society of Hysteroscopy as: Type 0 (complete intracavitary myoma), Type I (< 50 % of the myoma contained within the myometrium), or Type II (> 50 % of the myoma contained within the myometrium) [5].|$|R

Abnormal uterine bleeding included heavy menstrual <b>bleeding,</b> <b>intermenstrual</b> <b>bleeding</b> <b>and</b> postmenopausal <b>bleeding.</b> Women were excluded if office polypectomy was considered not feasible, malignancy was suspected or another surgical uterine intervention was needed. All participants provided written informed consent. In clinics which provided a ‘see and treat’ service, consent was obtained and the patient was registered on the on-line recruitment system prior to the diagnostic hysteroscopy, so that if a uterine polyp was diagnosed and the woman’s preference was for office polypectomy, treatment could be performed straight away without an interruption to register the patient into the study.|$|R

30|$|In a Cochrane {{systematic}} review, Lethaby et al.

The LNG-IUS was compared with oral cyclical norethisterone, transcervical resection of the endometrium or balloon ablation. Lethaby et al. {{concluded that the}} LNG-IUS {{is more effective than}} cyclical norethisterone as a treatment for heavy menstrual bleeding. Women with an LNG-IUS are more satisfied with the results of the treatment and more willing to continue with the treatment, but they also experience more side effects, such as <b>intermenstrual</b> <b>bleeding</b> <b>and</b> breast tenderness.

The {{mean age of the}} pediatric patients (81 girls and 97 females) was 6. 7 ± 2. 4 years (range 3 – 13 years) and {{the mean age of the}} adults (20 males and 15 females) was 21. 8 ± 7. 07 years (range 15 – 41 years).

"nPatients and Methods: Sonography was accomplished for 61 pregnant women in the first trimester of pregnancy who were referred with chief complaints of vaginal <b>bleeding</b> <b>and</b> pelvic <b>pain.</b> Severity of vaginal <b>bleeding</b> <b>and</b> pelvic <b>pain</b> correlated with final diagnosis by Chi-square and Fischer exact test.
