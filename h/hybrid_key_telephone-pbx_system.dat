40|$|Wireless ad hoc and sensor {{networks}} have received attention from research communities {{over the last}} several years. The ability to operate without a fixed infrastructure is suitable {{for a wide range of}} applications which in many cases require protection from security attacks. One of the first steps to provide security is to distribute cryptographic keys among nodes for bootstrapping security. The unique characteristics of ad hoc networks create a challenge in distributing keys among limited resource devices. In this dissertation we study the impact on secure connectivity achieved through key pre-distribution, of jamming attacks which form one of the easiest but efficient means for disruption of network connectivity. In response to jamming, networks can undertake different coping strategies (e. g., using power adaptation, spatial retreats, and directional antennas). Such coping techniques have impact in terms of the changing the initial secure connectivity created by secure links through key predistribution. The objective is to explore how whether predistribution techniques are robust enough for ad hoc/sensor networks that employ various techniques to cope with jamming attacks by taking into account challenges that arise with key predistribution when strategies for coping with jamming attacks are employed. In the first part of this dissertation we propose a <b>hybrid</b> <b>key</b> predistribution scheme that supports ad hoc/sensor networks that use mobility to cope with jamming attacks. In the presence of jamming attacks, this hybrid scheme provides high key connectivity while reducing the number of isolated nodes (after coping with jamming using spatial retreats). The hybrid scheme is a combination of random key predistribution and deployment-based key predistribution schemes that have complementary useful features for secure connectivity. In the second part we study performance of these key predistribution schemes under other jamming coping techniques namely power adaptation and directional antennas. We show that the combination of the <b>hybrid</b> <b>key</b> predistribution and coping techniques can help networks in maintaining secure connectivity even under jamming attacks...|$|R
