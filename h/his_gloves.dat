5|$|In early , Koufax asked Dodgers GM Buzzie Bavasi {{to trade}} {{him because he}} wasn't getting enough playing time. By the end of 1960, after going 8–13, Koufax was {{thinking}} about quitting baseball to devote himself to an electronics business that he'd invested in. After the last game of the season, he threw <b>his</b> <b>gloves</b> and spikes into the trash. Nobe Kawano, the clubhouse supervisor, retrieved the equipment to return to Koufax the following year (or to somebody else if Koufax {{did not return to}} play).|$|E
5|$|Tallon {{retired in}} {{dramatic}} circumstances {{after the first}} match of the 195354 Sheffield Shield season. During the match, he suddenly took off <b>his</b> <b>gloves</b> and handed the keeping duties to Peter Burge. He scored 21 and 54 not out in a drawn match against New South Wales. Two months later, he played for Arthur Morris's XI against Hassett's XI, a testimonial match for the latter. Tallon made 17 not out and nine in a 121-run win. Tallon continued to play local cricket in Bundaberg for another decade.|$|E

These characteristics were emphasized by the developer of the Wii game which included cutscenes which depict Glass Joe in French settings. Glass Joe {{is considered one of the}} most well-known characters in the Punch-Out!! series and a Nintendo icon. His name has been used to describe poor performance by sportspeople and teams. In The Wii game his dialogue consists of him pleading not for the player to strike him in the jaw, complaints about the tightness of <b>his</b> <b>gloves,</b> and counting to ten in French.|$|E
5|$|With {{time running}} out, Phlox and T'Pol {{find a way}} to disrupt the virus using deadly levels of radiation. Archer and Phlox, while wearing {{environmental}} suits, escort Tucker and Sato to Sickbay for treatment. Sato soon goes into cardiac-arrest, and Archer removes <b>his</b> <b>gloves</b> and helmet to assist her, but she cannot be resuscitated. They then administer a dose of radiation to Tucker, but that too is ineffective. Phlox then leaves to resume work from the Bridge. Suddenly, Tucker and Sato are reanimated by the aliens, whowhile possessing the crewmenexplain the situation to a surprised Archer, who then makes an impassioned speech on behalf of his crew. The aliens decide to modify their procedures, choosing to resurrect and cure the infected crew members, when they previously would have left them to die. The aliens erase the encounter from the crew's memory. Archer orders a warning beacon to be placed above the planet, and the aliens leave to begin planning first contact with more advanced humans at a later time.|$|E
5|$|Although David James {{remained}} as England's starting goalkeeper in a 2–2 draw against Austria {{in the first}} 2006 FIFA World Cup qualification match, Robinson started every subsequent match, keeping six clean sheets in nine competitive appearances, with a further three in seven friendly matches before the tournament. At the World Cup finals in Germany, Robinson was named in England's World Cup squad and was ever-present in England's campaign, keeping clean sheets in {{four out of five}} matches that he played. After the opening World Cup match against Paraguay, when his counterpart Justo Villar was injured seven minutes into the match, Robinson sent Villar <b>his</b> <b>gloves</b> as a gesture of goodwill. England had won the match 1–0. In addition to the clean sheet against Paraguay, he kept one in the group match against Trinidad and Tobago, although he drew criticism for making errors on crosses. Following England's progression from the group stage, he kept a clean sheet against Ecuador in the round of 16. He also kept a clean sheet in the following match, a quarter-final match against Portugal, although Portugal won 3–1 in a penalty shoot-out to eliminate England from the tournament.|$|E

5|$|The series {{then moved}} on to Britain, where Roberts would be {{involved}} in one of the closest races in Grand Prix history. Roberts' battle with Sheene at the 1979 British Grand Prix at Silverstone has been cited {{as one of the greatest}} races of the 1970s. Minutes before the start of the race, Roberts' Yamaha blew a seal and sprayed the bike with oil. His crew managed to replace the seal in time, but Roberts went to the starting line with <b>his</b> <b>gloves</b> coated with oil, causing his hand to slip on the throttle during the race. The race began with Roberts, Sheene and Dutch rider Wil Hartog breaking away from the rest of the field of riders. Hartog eventually fell behind as Roberts and Sheene continued to battle for the lead. The event featured numerous lead changes throughout the 28 lap race, with Roberts winning ahead of Sheene by a narrow margin of just three-tenths of a second. A third-place finish in the season-ending French Grand Prix, along with a crash by his main championship rival Ferrari, secured his second consecutive world championship.|$|E

25|$|After an evenly matched 3 rounds, the 4th round started more in Maccarinelli's favour. Halfway {{through the}} round, Maccarinelli dropped Jones with an uppercut. Jones beat the count and carried on for 10–12 seconds more with <b>his</b> <b>gloves</b> to his face, eating several more uppercuts. Against the ropes, he then absorbed a huge right hook which {{caused him to}} stiffen and fall {{face down on the}} canvas. Referee Ingo Barrabas waved off the fight in what was Jones' 9th career defeat, the 5th by KO.|$|E
25|$|Most goalkeepers also wear {{gloves to}} improve their grip on the ball, and to protect {{themselves}} from injury. Some gloves now include rigid plastic spines down each finger to help prevent injuries such as jammed and sprained fingers. Though gloves are not mandatory attire, it is uncommon for goalkeepers to opt against them due to the advantages they offer. At UEFA Euro 2004, Portuguese goalkeeper Ricardo famously took off <b>his</b> <b>gloves</b> for the quarter-final penalty shoot-out against England. He then went on to score a penalty in sudden death before saving Darius Vassell's penalty to win it for the Portuguese.|$|E
25|$|Ernest Austin Halliwell, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} Baberton Halliwell (7 September 1864 – 2 October 1919) was a first-class cricketer, who played eight Test matches for South Africa between 1892 and 1902, including three as captain. He played as a wicket-keeper, {{and was the}} first to put raw steaks inside <b>his</b> <b>gloves</b> to protect his hands. At his peak, he was considered one of the best wicket-keepers in the world, and was named one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1905. He was particularly praised for standing close to the wickets, even against fast bowlers.|$|E

25|$|Penn knocked Stevenson down seconds {{into the}} first round with a right uppercut, then took Stevenson down, {{delivering}} a well placed elbow from the top position that inflicted a serious cut near Stevenson's hairline. In the second round, Stevenson fought more aggressively but was still unable to threaten Penn. Penn worked to back mount and defeated him by rear naked choke at 4:02 of the second round to win the Lightweight Championship. He celebrated the win by licking Joe Stevenson's blood off of <b>his</b> <b>gloves.</b> The win for Penn was awarded Beatdown of the Year by Sherdog for 2008. With this win, Penn became the second man (after Randy Couture) to win UFC titles in two different weight classes.|$|E
25|$|Beck {{probably}} witnessed {{his first}} cardiac arrest during his internship in 1922 {{while on the}} surgery service at the Johns Hopkins Hospital. During a urologic operation, the anaesthetist announced that the patient's heart had stopped. To the amazement of Beck, the surgical resident removed <b>his</b> <b>gloves</b> {{and went to a}} telephone {{in a corner of the}} room and called the fire department. Beck remained in total bewilderment as the fire department rescue squad rushed into the operating room 15minutes later and applied oxygen-powered respirators to the patient's face. The patient died, but the episode left an indelible impression on him. Beck would go on to develop techniques to take back the management of cardiac arrest from the fire department and place it in the hands of surgeons.|$|E
25|$|Undertaker {{would return}} on the March 6 episode of Raw after Braun Strowman called out Reigns. Strowman left the ring {{following}} a brief staredown with Undertaker, who was then confronted by Reigns. After disrespectful comments were made by Reigns, The Undertaker performed a chokeslam on him. This led to a No Holds Barred match between Undertaker and Reigns at WrestleMania 33 on April 2, where Undertaker lost to Reigns after five spears in his fourth WrestleMania main event. After the match, Undertaker left <b>his</b> <b>gloves,</b> coat and hat {{in the center of}} the ring before slowly making his exit, also walking over to his wife Michelle McCool to kiss her, then walked up the ramp and performed his signature arm-raised pose as smoke surrounded him and he descended down into the ramp to the sound of his music. After he disappeared, the lights went out and his signature gong sounded off three times to end the show.|$|E

25|$|Australia captain Michael Clarke {{declared}} {{overnight and}} sent India in to bat {{at the start}} of Day 3. Shikhar Dhawan made a brisk start but was bowled by Ryan Harris for 25. Murali Vijay and Cheteshwar Pujara put on an 81-run partnership before Mitchell Johnson dismissed Vijay caught behind (53). India reached lunch at a solid 2/119. Pujara and Kohli continued their partnership after lunch and put on another 81-run stand until Pujara was bowled by Nathan Lyon for 73. Kohli and Ajinkya Rahane saw out a late onslaught from Lyon to be 3/223 at tea. Rahane pushed on after tea, but was caught off <b>his</b> <b>gloves</b> for 62. Rohit Sharma came in and helped push them towards 400 as Kohli brought up his 2nd century at Adelaide Oval. Kohli (115) was eventually dismissed with 4 overs remaining in the day. Wriddhiman Saha and Sharma successfully saw India to 5/369 at stumps.|$|E
25|$|From {{the opening}} bell Liston {{attempted}} to close with Ali, looking {{to land a}} hard punch to the head to end the fight quickly and decisively. Though Ali often carried <b>his</b> <b>gloves</b> down at his waist, seemingly open to attack, he proved very difficult to hit. With Ali quickly ducking his head left, right or away, Liston's leading left jabs largely failed to land. As Liston pursued his target Ali retreated away, using his foot speed to slip away into open space in the ring, largely circling {{to the left and}} away from the threat of a Liston left hook. Though the opening round saw Ali largely on the defensive, it was soon established that Ali could reverse roles quickly and take to the offensive with a remarkably fast series of combinations delivered to Liston's head. A sudden violent combination delivered with 30 seconds left in the round electrified the crowd. The opening round was fought an extra 20 seconds, as both fighters and referee Barney Felix apparently did not hear the bell.|$|E
25|$|Sri Lanka {{started the}} innings slowly, {{constrained}} by good bowling from Zaheer and committed fielding from Yuvraj Singh, Suresh Raina, and Virat Kohli inside the 30-yard circle. Zaheer began with three consecutive maidens and the wicket of Tharanga, conceding only six runs in his five-over spell. Dilshan was bowled by Harbhajan when a delivery carried {{on to the}} stumps after deflecting off <b>his</b> <b>gloves.</b> Sangakkara came in after Tharanga's dismissal, and was building a solid foundation with Dilshan before the latter was dismissed. Jayawardene came to the crease when Sri Lanka were 60/2 in the 17th over. Sangakkara and Mahela went about the task of consolidating the innings, but eventually Sangakkara was caught behind by Dhoni at 48. New batsman Thilan Samaraweera was adjudged not out by the umpire when a ball hit his thigh pad off the bowling of Yuvraj Singh. The Indians decided to review the decision and he was ultimately given out. Chamara Kapugedera, who was playing his first World Cup match, was caught off a deceptive slower ball by Zaheer Khan. Jayawardene, meanwhile, continued with his quality batting, ultimately scoring 103 not out from 88 balls in a high-class batting display. Helped by the hard-hitting of Kulasekara and Thisara, Sri Lanka scored 91 runs in the last 10 overs, including 63 in the batting powerplay (45–50 overs) to take the score to 274/6.|$|E
