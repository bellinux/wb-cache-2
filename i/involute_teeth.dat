40|$|Abstract The tooth {{flanks of}} bevel gears with <b>involute</b> <b>teeth</b> are still cut using approximations such as Tredgold’s and octoid curves, while the {{geometry}} of the exact spherical involute is well known. The modeling of the tooth flanks of gears with skew axes, however, still represents a challenge to geometers. Hence, {{there is a need}} to develop algorithms for the geometric modeling of these gears. As a matter of fact, the modeling of gears with skew axes and <b>involute</b> <b>teeth</b> is still an open question, as it is not even known whether it makes sense to speak of such tooth geometries. This paper is a contribution along these lines, as pertaining to gears with skew axes and cycloid teeth. To this end, the authors follow and extend results reported by Martin Disteli at the turn of the 20 th century concerning the general synthesis of gears with skew axes. The main goal is to shed light on {{the geometry of}} the tooth flanks of gears with skew axes. The dualization of the tooth profiles of spherical cycloidal gears leads to ruled surfaces as conjugate tooth flanks such that at any instant the contact points are located on a straight line. A main result reported herein is Theorem 5, which is original. All results are proven by means of a consistent use of dual vectors representing directed lines and rigid-body twists...|$|E
40|$|For {{increasing}} the {{load carrying capacity}} of geared power transmissions several tooth designs alternative to the standard involute have been proposed. The use of non-involute teeth {{has a number of}} disadvantages and for this reason asymmetric involute-type teeth have been studied as a promising alternative. In this article the idea of one-sided involute asymmetric spur gear teeth is introduced to increase load carrying capacity and combine the good meshing properties of the driving involute and the increased strength of non-involute curves. These novel teeth are intended for constant direction of rotation, although they {{can be used in a}} limited way for reverse rotation. Both profiles are fully generated by a hob, the design of which is also investigated. The increase in load carrying capacity can reach up to 28 {%} compared to the standard 207 ° <b>involute</b> <b>teeth...</b>|$|E

Using plated CBN hard honing wheels with {{standard}} <b>involute</b> <b>tooth</b> profiles, {{there will be}} the middle concave error around pitch circle on the machined gear tooth surfaces. Therefore, standard <b>involute</b> <b>tooth</b> profiles of honing wheels have to be modified properly before electroplating CBN. In the paper, aiming at the tooth profile modification of honing wheels, the standard involute curve was converted into a spline curve, and control points of the spline curve were parameterized in solid modeling of honing wheels. By the Pro/E and ANSYS Workbench software, the engaging situation between honing wheel and gear was analyzed. Based on the analysis results, assuming the control points around pitch circle were set as variable parameter, and basically equal contact pressures were set as response variable parameter, the tooth surfaces of hard honing wheels were properly corrected, it was proved useful to reduce or eliminate middle concave error in practice...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} a survey of {{benefits}} and drawbacks of embedding a variable gearbox instead of a single reduction gear in electric vehicle powertrain from efficiency point of view.

The model for a variable gearbox is fulfilled and further employed in a complete vehicle simulation. Simulation model run for a single reduction gear then the results are taken as benchmark for other types of commonly used transmissions. Comparing power consumption, which is obtained from simulation model, shows that the extra load imposed by variable transmission components will shade the benefits of efficient operation of electric motor. The other accomplishment of this {{study is a}} combination of modified formulas that led to a new methodology for power loss prediction in gear meshing which is compatible with modern design and manufacturing technology...|$|E

At present, in the cycloid {{rotational}} indexing processing {{back taper}} technique, machining requirements were achieved mainly through {{the method of}} using cycloid cluster to approach the involute, so that the processing efficiency was hindered.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the development of}} a model for the evaluation of pressure transients occurring within an <b>involute</b> <b>tooth</b> form twin-pinion gear pump and addresses, in particular, the influence of cavitation. The latter can cause erosion, limiting the life of such pumps, and liberate hard particles, leading to secondary damage elsewhere. The model considers the inter-tooth volumes that are formed at the roots of the driver and driven gears and utilizes the continuity equations by considering compressible flow into and out of these volumes. Cavitation arising from insufficient flow into the expanding inter-tooth volumes is taken into account. The continuity equations are expressed in terms of fluid density rather than pressure. Hence correct solutions are ensured even during cavitating conditions, when the minimum void pressure is fixed at the appropriate vapour pressure. The effectiveness of the model is assessed through gear pump meshing pressure measurement and flow visualization. The significant influence of inlet pressure ripple on low-pressure predictions is also investigated...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{non-linear}} one-degree-of-freedom model {{for analysis of}} gear rattle vibrations in automotive manual transmissions is presented. In order {{to take into account}} the damping effects owing to the oil in the gap between two teeth of a meshing gear, a simple one-dimensional model for the oil-film squeeze effects is proposed. The squeeze model assumes that the damping force is proportional to the oil viscosity and to the extension of the oil film in the plane of curvature of the teeth, which may depend on the lubrication conditions (dry sump, splash, bath). The results provided from several numerical simulations, carried out with reference to helical <b>involute</b> <b>tooth</b> pairs, confirm the capability of oil in reducing the high-frequency vibrations subsequent to the impact between the teeth. In particular, the influence exerted by oil viscosity and gap extension on the rattle characteristics is investigated through the analysis of the transient response of the driven gear by imposing a harmonic motion to the driving gear...|$|R
40|$|Signatures are on file in the Graduate School. iii Fluctuation in static {{transmission}} error is the accepted principal cause of vibration excitation in meshing gear pairs and consequently gear noise.
