40|$|The present {{paper is}} {{dedicated}} to the evaluation of the influence played by important design parameters like the <b>interturn</b> <b>insulation</b> thickness and the insulating material permittivity on the voltage distribution among the coils of a stator winding fed by a PWM inverter. The system, composed of a feeder cable and a stator winding is modeled and simulated by using multiconductor transmission line theory. A recently developed time-domain equivalent circuit is used to represent the multiconductor line, with losses possibly dependent on frequency, which allows to correctly describe the dielectric losses and the skin-effect in the conductors. The obtained results can offer a broad guideline to design engineers for a suitable dimensioning of the motor insulation...|$|E
40|$|The {{investigation}} {{object is}} the traction induction motor of the Metro electric train. The {{aim is to}} increase the reliability of traction induction mototrs in the rolling stock of the railways and Metro. The synthesis method of the equivalent circuit for traction induction motor in the pulse condition has been developed; this method permits to design the voltages for the motor winding insulation. The investigation results permit to make the substantiated selection in the level of the case and <b>interturn</b> <b>insulation</b> of motor windings and to improve the insulation protection methods.

40|$|A {{primary goal}} in {{designing}} a superconducting coil is mechanical stability. It {{may also be}} desirable to provide some <b>interturn</b> <b>insulation</b> for coils using large ratios of copper to super-conductor. If the superconductor is in strip form for winding into edge-cooled pancakes, an organic adhesive and insulation can provide a convenient means of meeting these criteria. Such an organic system must provide enough flexibility at liquid helium temperatures to accommodate relative motions due to temperature differentials or differences in thermal expansion. Very few organic materials are known to retain any appreciable ultimate elongation at liquid helium temperatures. At liquid nitrogen temperatures fluorinated olefins (Teflons), polyimides (Kapton), polyethylene terephthalate (Mylar), and some polyurethanes retain an ultimate elongation of a few percent. Only the polyurethanes are practical adhesives for large coils and their sensitivity to moistllre is a problem during coil assembly. A practical solution is a two-component system consisting of an insulating film with good elongation properties and a strong adhesive used in a very thin layer. The elongation of the film protects the adhesive from excessive stress if the adhesive is thin enough {{that it does not}} fracture due to stress from its own high coef-ficient of thermal expansion. A two-component system corsisting of fluorinated ethylene-propylene (FEP) film and an epoxy adhesive has been investigated for use as a cfyogenic adhesive system by Narmco for NASA. A similar system seemed an excellent choice for bonding the superconducting ~ 011 s for the ANL 12 -Foot Bubble Chamber, and was investigated accordingly...|$|E
40|$|All MBI bending magnets {{in each of}} the two LHC {{injection}} {{transfer lines}} will be powered in series. The limited output voltage of existing power converters lead to an unusual coil design avoiding external return bus-bars by combining two overlapping half-coils, electrically separated, with 3 1 / 2 turns each in a monolithic structure. The voltage between turns in one coil can reach up-to 3. 6 kV. The coil has been designed with particular care for obtaining high <b>interturn</b> and ground <b>insulation.</b> Flux-free soldering of connections with plug-in cone sleeves is applied, allowing to execute water cooled current connections as prolongation of the coil conductor. Epoxy compound polymerization in the impregnation mould is obtained by passing overheated water in regulated cycles through the water circuit of the coil conductor. We describe the design basics as well as various test results of pre-series and series produced coils. (4 refs) ...|$|R
