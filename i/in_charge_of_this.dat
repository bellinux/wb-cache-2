5|$|The {{indigenous}} Boorong {{people of}} northwestern Victoria {{saw it as}} Won, a boomerang thrown by Totyarguil (Altair). The Aranda people of Central Australia saw Corona Australis as a coolamon carrying a baby, which was accidentally dropped to earth {{by a group of}} sky-women dancing in the Milky Way. The impact of the coolamon created Gosses Bluff crater, 175km west of Alice Springs. The Torres Strait Islanders saw Corona Australis {{as part of a larger}} constellation encompassing part of Sagittarius and the tip of Scorpius's tail; the Pleiades and Orion were also associated. This constellation was Tagai's canoe, crewed by the Pleiades, called the Usiam, and Orion, called the Seg. The myth of Tagai says that he was <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> canoe, but his crewmen consumed all of the supplies onboard without asking permission. Enraged, Tagai bound the Usiam with a rope and tied them to the side of the boat, then threw them overboard. Scorpius's tail represents a suckerfish, while Eta Sagittarii and Theta Coronae Australis mark the bottom of the canoe. On the island of Futuna, the figure of Corona Australis was called Tanuma and in the Tuamotus, it was called Na Kaua-ki-Tonga.|$|E

25|$|In 1198, the Catholicos of Sis, Grigor VI Apirat, proclaimed a union {{between the}} Armenian Church and the Roman Catholic Church; however, this had no notable effect, {{as the local}} clergy and populace was {{strongly}} opposed to such a union.

25|$|On December 31, Bonifacio and the Magdalo and Magdiwang leaders held {{a meeting}} in Imus, ostensibly to {{determine}} the leadership of Cavite in order to end the rivalry between the two factions. The issue of whether the Katipunan should {{be replaced by a}} revolutionary government was brought up by the Magdalo, and this eclipsed the rivalry issue. The Magdalo argued that the Katipunan, as a secret society, should have ceased to exist once the Revolution was underway. They also held that Cavite should not be divided. Bonifacio and the Magdiwang contended that the Katipunan served as their revolutionary government since it had its own constitution, laws, and provincial and municipal governments. Edilberto Evangelista presented a draft constitution for the proposed government to Bonifacio but he rejected it as it was too similar to the Spanish Maura Law. Upon the event of restructuring, Bonifacio was given carte blanche to appoint a committee tasked with setting up a new government; he would also be <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> committee. He tasked Emilio Aguinaldo to record the minutes of the meeting and requested for it to establish this authority, but these were never done and never provided.|$|E
25|$|She {{continued}} her {{study at the}} Fukien Christian University, which was a top university {{at that time in}} China. She graduated at the age of 22 from this university and earned the bachelor's degree in Physics. Because she was the best one in her class and this university wanted to hire some women, she got the chance to stay in this university and work for 8 years. For the first four years, she worked as an assistant to teach some fundamental courses such as mechanism. She taught so well that many students who were not in this class wanted to listen to her courses. After that she wrote a book named Course for Experiments in Optics and got the certification as a professor. Fukien Christian University had many exchange programs with New York University at that time and many teachers who worked more than 2 years could get the chance to study abroad. However, because she was not a Christian, the person <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> program didn’t give her the chance. So she applied for Dickinson College and got a full scholarship by the help of her workmate named Lairong Li.|$|E

25|$|On July 16, 1862, the United States Congress passed {{legislation}} authorizing the U.S. {{federal government to}} purchase land for national cemeteries for military dead, and put the U.S. Army Quartermaster General <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> program. At this time, the Soldiers' Home in nearby Washington, D.C., and the Alexandria Cemetery were the primary burying grounds for war dead in the D.C. area, but by late 1863 both cemeteries were full. In May 1864, large numbers of Union forces died in the Battle of the Wilderness. Quartermaster General Montgomery C. Meigs ordered that an examination of eligible sites {{be made for the}} establishment for a large new national military cemetery. Within weeks, his staff reported that Arlington Estate was the most suitable property in the area. The estate was high and free from floods (which might unearth graves), it had a view of the District of Columbia, and it was aesthetically pleasing. It was also the home of the leader of the armed forces of the Confederate States of America, and denying Robert E. Lee use of his home after the war was a valuable political consideration. Although the first military burial at Arlington was made on May 13, Meigs did not authorize establishment of burials until June 15, 1864.|$|E
500|$|In 1900, {{near the}} site of the ancient Byzantine city of Theodosia, {{thirteen}} large piles of stones were discovered by Zibold who was a forester and engineer <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> area.
