40|$|The <b>inverter</b> <b>control</b> {{strategy}} {{is the key}} to pump energy-saving operation and should be established based on the current system configurations and system requirements, which is not the case in practice. As a result, the characteristics of pump system requirements and a combination pump with inverter were studied, and the mathematical models were established. A new model for an optimal <b>inverter</b> <b>control</b> strategy based on the current system configurations and system requirements was then established, and a method combining golden section search and genetic algorithm was formulated to solve this optimal model. This model sets up an optimal <b>inverter</b> <b>control</b> strategy to increase the efficiency of pump operation following a process line near the minimum requirements to improve operation conditions. The implementation difficulty of the control law was also reduced. Finally, the optimized model was applied to an industrial circulating pump system, and the result showed that the model can not only determine the optimal <b>inverter</b> <b>control</b> strategy but also evaluate the current operation situation of the pump configuration and determine the energy-saving potential for the current configuration, which can aid in the subsequent energy-saving reconstruction...|$|E
40|$|Motivated by {{the need}} to cope with rapid and random {{fluctuations}} of renewable generation, we presents a model that augments the traditional Volt/VAR control through switched controllers on a slow timescale with <b>inverter</b> <b>control</b> on a fast timescale. The optimization problem is generally nonconvex and therefore hard to solve. We propose a simple convex relaxation and prove that it is exact provided over-satisfaction of load is allowed. Hence Volt/VAR control over radial networks is efficiently solvable. Simulations of a real-world distribution circuit illustrates that the proposed <b>inverter</b> <b>control</b> achieves significant improvement over the IEEE 1547 standard in terms of power quality and power savings...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} controller {{designs of}} a 2 kVA single-phase inverter for photovoltaic (PV) applications. The demand for better controller designs is constantly rising as the renewable energy market continues to rapidly grow. Some background {{research has been}} done on solar energy, PV inverter configurations, <b>inverter</b> <b>control</b> design, and hardware component selection. Controllers are designed both for stand-alone and grid-connected modes of operation. For stand-alone <b>inverter</b> <b>control,</b> the outer control loop regulates the filter capacitor voltage. Combining the synchronous frame outer control loop with the capacitor current feedback inner control loop, the system can achieve both zero steady-state error and better step load performance. For grid-tied <b>inverter</b> <b>control,</b> proportional capacitor current feedback is used. This achieves the active damping needed to suppress the LCL filter resonance problem. The outer loop regulates the inverter output current flowing into the grid with a proportional resonant controller and harmonic compensators. With a revised grid synchronization unit, the active power and reactive power can be decoupled and controlled separately through a serial communication based user interface. To validate the designed controllers, a scaled down prototype is constructed and tested with a digital signal processor (DSP) TMS 320 F 28335...|$|E
40|$|The {{increasing}} number of inverter-based Distributed Generator (DG) units connected to both MV and LV distribution networks {{can be used as}} a resource in order to overcome some emergency conditions. The presence of different inverter-based DG units could introduce issues regarding the management of intentional islanded networks, therefore reliable <b>inverter</b> <b>control</b> strategies for islanded operation assume an essential role. In this paper an inverter operating scheme has been implemented suitable in presence of networks supplied by a single DG or multiple DGs and for both grid tie and grid off operation. This <b>inverter</b> <b>control</b> scheme has been modeled and tested through detailed dynamic simulations in LV and MV islanded networks. Moreover the dynamic behavior of the proposed <b>inverter</b> <b>control</b> strategy has been studied and analyzed in light of the recently issued Italian connection grid codes for active users. The results show that the control scheme allows operation of intentional islanded networks supplied by single or multiple DG units. In case of multiple DG units, simulations show that, grid connection rules influence the dynamic of islanding operations depending on the power balance existing before the islanding forming...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Decentralized <b>inverter</b> <b>control</b> is {{essential}} in distributed generation (DG) microgrids for low deployment/operation cost and high reliability. However, decentralized <b>inverter</b> <b>control</b> suffers from a limited system stability {{mainly because of the}} lack of communications among different inverters. In this paper, we investigate stability enhancement of the droop based decentralized <b>inverter</b> <b>control</b> in microgrids. Specifically, we propose a power sharing based control strategy which incorporates the information of the total real and reactive power generation of all DG units. The information is acquired by a wireless network (such as a WiFi, ZigBee, and/or cellular communication network) in a decentralized manner. Based on the desired power sharing of each DG unit and the acquired information of total generation, additional control terms are added to the traditional droop controller. We evaluate the performance of the proposed control strategy based on smallsignal stability analysis. As timely communication may not be established for a microgrid with low-cost wireless communication devices, two kinds of analytical models are developed with respect to negligible and nonnegligible communication delays, respectively. Extensive numerical results are presented to demonstrate the system stability under the proposed control strategy with respect to different communication delays. Index Terms—Delay, droop control, inverter, microgrid, smart grid, stability, wireless network. I...|$|E

40|$|In inverter-based microgrids, the paralleled {{inverters}} {{need to work}} in grid-connected {{mode and}} stand-alone mode and to transfer seamlessly between the two modes. In grid-connected mode, the <b>inverters</b> <b>control</b> the amount of power injected into the grid. In stand-alone mode, however, the <b>inverters</b> <b>control</b> the island voltage while the output power is dictated by the load. This can be achieved using the droop <b>control.</b> <b>Inverters</b> can have different power set points during grid-connected mode, but in stand-alone mode, they all need their power set points to be adjusted according to their power ratings. However, during sudden unintentional islanding (due to loss of mains), transient power can flow from inverters with high power set points to inverters with low power set points, which can raise the dc-link voltage of the inverters causing them to shut down. This paper investigates the transient circulating power between paralleled inverters during unintentional islanding and proposes a controller to limit it. The controller monitors the dc-link voltage and adjusts the power set point {{in proportion to the}} rise in the voltage. A small-signal model of an islanded microgrid is developed and used to design the controller. Simulation and experimental results are presented to validate the design...|$|R
