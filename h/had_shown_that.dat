On the other hand, Anglo-Spanish {{political}} relations suffered following the battle. Wellington placed most of the blame for the losses on Blake, while a dispatch read in the Spanish cortes implied that the British had played only a minor role in the battle, despite their much higher losses.|$|E

5|$|Although {{civilian}} evacuations {{had begun}} in January for the Gulf Coast and San Antonio de Béxar, the Texian military was either on the offensive or standing firm until the smaller Gulf Coast skirmishes happened in February. Houston was now facing a choice of whether to retreat to {{a safe place to}} train his new army, or to meet the enemy head-on immediately.

5|$|Einstein {{contributed to}} these {{developments}} by linking {{them with the}} 1898 arguments Wilhelm Wien had made.

Einstein noted in 1911 that the same adiabatic principle shows that the quantity which is quantized in any mechanical motion must be an adiabatic invariant. Arnold Sommerfeld identified this adiabatic invariant as the action variable of classical mechanics.|$|E
5|$|Holden began {{assembling}} the compact HA series Vauxhall Viva in 1964. This was superseded by the Holden Torana in 1967, a {{development of the}} Viva ending Vauxhall production in Australia. Holden offered the LC, a Torana with new styling, in 1969 with the availability of Holden's six-cylinder engine. In the development days, the six-cylinder Torana was reserved for motor racing, but research <b>had</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> there was a business case for such a model. The LC Torana was the first application of Holden's new three-speed Tri-Matic automatic transmission. This {{was the result of}} Holden's A$16.5million transformation of the Woodville, South Australia factory for its production.|$|E

He has received praise since moving to Scotland. Newspaper The Daily Record described him as being one of the most skilled attackers in the SPL.

NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen has stated that NATO membership is still an option for Ukraine, and support for NATO membership has risen to 63.9 percent in government-controlled Ukraine according to a July 2015 poll. Previous polls <b>had</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> the decline in opposition to membership was linked to the ongoing Russian intervention.|$|E

As early as 734, however, K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat <b>had</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> {{he was no}} longer an obedient subordinate of Copán when he started to refer to himself as k'ul ahaw, holy lord, instead of using the lesser term ahaw, subordinate lord; {{at the same time he}} began to use his own Quiriguá emblem glyph.

5|$|The {{design of}} the {{reactors}} for plutonium production involved several problems, not just in nuclear physics but in engineering and construction. Issues such as the long-term effect of radiation on materials received considerable attention from the Metallurgical Laboratory. Two types of reactors were considered: homogeneous, in which the moderator and fuel were mixed together, and heterogeneous, in which the moderator and fuel were arranged in a lattice configuration. By late 1941, mathematical analysis <b>had</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> the lattice design had advantages over the homogeneous type, {{and so it was}} chosen for CP-1, and for the later production reactors as well. For a neutron moderator, graphite was chosen {{on the basis of its}} availability compared with beryllium or heavy water.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{research into}} thinking machines {{was inspired by}} a confluence of ideas that became prevalent in the late 30s, 40s and early 50s. Recent research in neurology <b>had</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> the brain was an electrical network of neurons that fired in all-or-nothing pulses. Norbert Wiener's cybernetics described control and stability in electrical networks. Claude Shannon's information theory described digital signals (i.e., all-or-nothing signals). Alan Turing's theory of computation showed that any form of computation could be described digitally. The close relationship between these ideas suggested that {{it might be possible to}} construct an electronic brain.|$|E

The Environmental Working Group objected to his report, mainly questioning his statements about bacteria, but also managed to determine that the produce had never been tested for pesticides. They communicated this to Stossel, but after the story's producer backed Stossel's statement that the test results had been as described, the story was rebroadcast months later, unchanged, and with a postscript in which Stossel reiterated his claim. Later, after a report in The New York Times confirmed the Environmental Working Group's claims, ABC News suspended the producer of the segment for a month and reprimanded Stossel. Stossel apologized, saying that he had thought the tests had been conducted as reported. However, he asserted that the gist of his report had been accurate.|$|E

All three prototypes were completed {{by the end of}} September and the third prototype had been modified to reduce the outer-wing dihedral to 3 degrees. Both the second and third prototypes remained unflown when the Ministry of Supply ordered that flying be ceased and work on the aircraft be stopped. Later in the month, however, the third prototype was allocated to tests of powered aileron controls, as testing of the first prototype <b>had</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> while adequate at cruise speed, the ailerons were heavy both at low and high speed.

5|$|In 1950, {{calculations}} by the Polish mathematician Stanislaw Ulam and his collaborator Cornelius Everett, {{along with}} confirmations by Fermi, <b>had</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> {{not only was}} Teller's earlier estimate of the quantity of tritium needed for the H-bomb a low one, but that even with higher amounts of tritium, the energy loss in the fusion process would be too great to enable the fusion reaction to propagate. However, in 1951 Teller and Ulam made a breakthrough, and invented a new design, proposed in a classified March 1951 paper, On Heterocatalytic Detonations I: Hydrodynamic Lenses and Radiation Mirrors, for a practical megaton-range H-bomb. The exact contribution provided respectively from Ulam and Teller to {{what became known as}} the Teller–Ulam design is not definitively known in the public domain, and the exact contributions of each and how the final idea was arrived upon has been a point of dispute in both public and classified discussions since the early 1950s.|$|E

5|$|In Roman Egypt {{during the}} 2nd century CE, Claudius Ptolemaeus (Ptolemy) {{attempted}} {{to address the}} problem of the orbital motion of Mars. Observations of Mars <b>had</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> the planet appeared to move 40% faster on one side of its orbit than the other, in conflict with the Aristotelian model of uniform motion. Ptolemy modified the model of planetary motion by adding a point offset from the center of the planet's circular orbit about which the planet moves at a uniform rate of rotation. He proposed that the order of the planets, by increasing distance, was: the Moon, Mercury, Venus, Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and the fixed stars. Ptolemy's model and his collective work on astronomy was presented in the multi-volume collection Almagest, which became the authoritative treatise on Western astronomy for the next fourteen centuries.|$|E
5|$|Instead {{of solving}} {{for the two}} hyperbolas, Newton {{constructs}} their directrix lines instead. For any hyperbola, the ratio of distances from a point Z to a focus A and to the directrix is a fixed constant called the eccentricity. The two directrices intersect at a point T, and from their two known distance ratios, Newton constructs a line passing through T on which Z must lie. However, the ratio of distances TZ/TA is also known; hence, Z also lies on a known circle, since Apollonius <b>had</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> a circle {{can be defined as}} the set of points that have a given ratio of distances to two fixed points. (As an aside, this definition is the basis of bipolar coordinates.) Thus, the solutions to Apollonius' problem are the intersections of a line with a circle.|$|E

In particular, a DNV report from 1999 <b>had</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> the train could act as a sled, lose contact with the tracks and slide on top of the snow. A former NSB employee who worked with route planning, stated that a locomotive-hauled train would be better suitable for such situations, because more of the weight is located {{at the front of the}} train, and it will therefore plow instead of slide. The National Rail Administration said that they took extra precautions for the Class 73 trains and that during snowfall they would run a snow-clearing unit ahead of all Class 73 runs. NSB stated that they would consider the possibility of reverting to conventional trains, but that unless new information could shed light on the situation, they would retain use of the Class 73 trains.|$|E
