5|$|While the tricking of a {{tortoise}} was {{the most}} popular method in Bulgarian mythology, in Dalmatia the legend refers to snakes, and among Serbs another version involves the locking of young <b>hedgehogs</b> in a box for their mother to unlock. In Serbia, one would also have to be quick to take the raskovnik, as the hedgehog would swallow it after use. In any case, turtles, snakes and <b>hedgehogs</b> are all animals with chthonic characteristics which were often variously associated with the underworld in South Slavic tradition.|$|E
5|$|Cattle are grazed in Poor's Field {{each year}} to {{maintain}} {{the level of the}} vegetation. Wild mammals include foxes, <b>hedgehogs,</b> stoats, weasels, mink, grey squirrels and badgers. Several species of bat also live in the woods.|$|E
5|$|Both spiders and {{scorpions}} are venomous, {{so their}} threat displays can be considered generally aposematic. However, some predators such as <b>hedgehogs</b> and spider-hunting wasps (Pompilidae) actively hunt arachnids, overcoming their defences, so when a hedgehog is startled by, for instance, the sounds made by a scorpion, {{there is reason to}} describe the display as deimatic.|$|E

50|$|The {{southern}} white-breasted <b>hedgehog</b> (Erinaceus concolor), {{sometimes referred}} to as white-bellied <b>hedgehog</b> or white-chested <b>hedgehog,</b> is very similar in lifestyle and appearance to the European <b>hedgehog,</b> but the former has a white spot on its chest. For a long time these two species were considered to be one. The northern white-breasted <b>hedgehog</b> was formerly recognized as a subspecies of the Southern white-breasted <b>hedgehog</b> but newer investigations see both as different species. The Southern white-breasted <b>hedgehog</b> and European <b>hedgehog</b> can hybridize.|$|R
5|$|The {{eggs and}} chicks of this ground-nesting bird are {{vulnerable}} to predation by red foxes, pine martens, European <b>hedgehogs,</b> least weasels and domestic dogs, and by birds including crows, Eurasian magpies, Eurasian jays and owls.

2500|$|The <b>Hedgehog</b> protein {{family is}} {{involved}} in induction of cell types {{and the creation of}} tissue boundaries and patterning and are found in all bilateral organisms. <b>Hedgehog</b> proteins were first discovered and studied in Drosophila. [...] <b>Hedgehog</b> proteins produce key signals for the establishment of limb and body plan of fruit flies as well as homeostasis of adult tissues, involved in late embryogenesis and metamorphosis. At least three [...] "Drosophila" [...] <b>hedgehog</b> homologs have been found in vertebrates: sonic <b>hedgehog,</b> desert <b>hedgehog,</b> and Indian <b>hedgehog.</b> Sonic <b>hedgehog</b> (SHH) has various roles in vertebrae development, mediating signaling and regulating the organization of central nervous system, limb, and somite polarity. Desert <b>hedgehog</b> (DHH) is expressed in the Sertoli cells involved in spermatogenesis. Indian <b>hedgehog</b> (IHH) is expressed in the gut and cartilage, important in postnatal bone growth.|$|R

5|$|Several {{species of}} {{elongate}} organisms form their bodies into a loop to roll, including certain caterpillars (which do so to escape danger), tiger beetle larvae, myriapods, mantis shrimp, Armadillidiidae, and Mount Lyell salamanders. Other species adopt more spherical postures, primarily {{to protect their}} bodies from predators; this posture has been seen in pangolins, wheel spiders, <b>hedgehogs,</b> armadillos, Armadillo girdled lizards, isopods, and fossilized trilobites. Pangolins and wheel spiders have been observed to purposely roll away from predators. These species may roll passively (under the influence of gravity or wind) or actively, typically by altering their shape to generate a propulsive force.|$|E
5|$|Sonic the Hedgehog is a 2006 {{platform}} {{video game}} developed by Sonic Team {{and published by}} Sega for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 consoles. It is a reboot of the Sonic the Hedgehog series, and was produced in commemoration of the series' fifteenth anniversary. The story follows three hedgehogs—Sonic, Shadow, and Silver—who battle Solaris, an ancient evil pursued by Doctor Eggman. Gameplay is split into three separate campaigns for the <b>hedgehogs,</b> each of whom have their own unique abilities and must complete a series of levels to advance the story.|$|E

The game features an anthropomorphic hedgehog named Sonic in a quest to defeat Doctor Robotnik, a scientist who has imprisoned animals in robots and stolen the magical Chaos Emeralds. Sonic the <b>Hedgehogs</b> gameplay involves collecting rings {{as a form of}} health and a simple control scheme, with jumping and attacking controlled by a single button.|$|E
5|$|Only 18 {{species of}} mammals {{are found in}} Bahrain, animals such as gazelles, desert rabbits and <b>hedgehogs</b> are common in the wild but the Arabian oryx was hunted to {{extinction}} on the island. 25 species of amphibians and reptiles were recorded as well as 21 species of butterflies and 307 species of flora. The marine biotopes are diverse and include extensive sea grass beds and mudflats, patchy coral reefs as well as offshore islands. Sea grass beds are important foraging grounds for some threatened species such as dugongs and the green turtle. In 2003, Bahrain banned the capture of sea cows, marine turtles and dolphins within its territorial waters.|$|E
5|$|Other mammals {{found in}} Greater London are <b>hedgehogs,</b> rats, mice, rabbit, shrew, vole, and squirrels, In wilder areas of Outer London, such as Epping Forest, {{a wide variety}} of mammals are found {{including}} hare, badger, field, bank and water vole, wood mouse, yellow-necked mouse, mole, shrew, and weasel, in addition to fox, squirrel and hedgehog. A dead otter was found at The Highway, in Wapping, about a mile from the Tower Bridge, which would suggest that they have begun to move back after being absent a hundred years from the city. Ten of England's eighteen species of bats have been recorded in Epping Forest: soprano, nathusius and common pipistrelles, noctule, serotine, barbastelle, daubenton's, brown Long-eared, natterer's and leisler's.|$|E

40|$|SummaryLoss-of-function {{mutations}} in glypican- 3 (GPC 3), {{one of the}} six mammalian glypicans, causes the Simpson-Golabi-Behmel overgrowth syndrome (SGBS), and GPC 3 null mice display developmental overgrowth. Because the <b>Hedgehog</b> signaling pathway positively regulates body size, we hypothesized that GPC 3 acts as an inhibitor of <b>Hedgehog</b> activity during development. Here, we show that GPC 3 null embryos display increased <b>Hedgehog</b> signaling and that GPC 3 inhibits <b>Hedgehog</b> activity in cultured mouse embryonic fibroblasts. In addition, we report that GPC 3 interacts with high affinity with <b>Hedgehog</b> but not with its receptor, Patched, and that GPC 3 competes with Patched for <b>Hedgehog</b> binding. Furthermore, GPC 3 induces <b>Hedgehog</b> endocytosis and degradation. Surprisingly, the heparan sulfate chains of GPC 3 are not required for its interaction with <b>Hedgehog.</b> We conclude that GPC 3 acts as a negative regulator of <b>Hedgehog</b> signaling during mammalian development and that the overgrowth observed in SGBS patients is, at least in part, the consequence of hyperactivation of the <b>Hedgehog</b> signaling pathway...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The <b>hedgehog</b> (Hh) {{signaling}} pathway regulates many processes {{of development and}} tissue homeostasis. Activation of <b>hedgehog</b> signaling {{has been reported in}} about 30 % of human cancer including ovarian cancer. Inhibition of <b>hedgehog</b> signaling has been pursued as an effective strategy for cancer treatment including an ongoing phase II clinical trial in ovarian cancer. However, the rate of <b>hedgehog</b> signaling activation in ovarian cancer was reported differently by different groups. To predict the successful for future clinical trials of <b>hedgehog</b> signaling inhibitors in ovarian cancer, we assessed <b>hedgehog</b> pathway activation in 34 ovarian epithelial tumor specimens through analyses of target gene expression by in-situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry, RT-PCR and real-time PCR. In contrast to previous reports, we only detected a small proportion of ovarian cancers with <b>hedgehog</b> target gene expression, suggesting that identification of the tumors with activated <b>hedgehog</b> signaling activation will facilitate chemotherapy with <b>hedgehog</b> signaling inhibitors. </p...|$|R
5|$|The larger Welsh mammals {{died out}} during the Norman period, {{including}} the brown bear, wolf and the wildcat. Today, mammals of note include shrews, voles, badgers, otters, <b>hedgehogs</b> and fifteen species of bat. Two species of small rodent, the yellow-necked mouse and the dormouse, are of special Welsh note being found at the historically undisturbed border area. Other animals of note include, otter, stoat and weasel. The pine marten which has had the occasional sighting, has not been officially recorded since the 1950s. The polecat was nearly driven to extinction in Britain, but hung on in Wales and is now rapidly spreading. Feral goats {{can be found in}} Snowdonia.|$|E
5|$|The larvae are {{themselves}} eaten by various {{animals such as}} carnivorous invertebrates and water birds, and are especially vulnerable to predatory fish. Adults generally avoid predators through their hidden lifestyle but are sometimes eaten by herons and other birds, snakes such as the grass snake, and mammals such as shrews, badgers and <b>hedgehogs.</b> They secrete the poison tetrodotoxin from their skin, albeit much less than for example the North American Pacific newts (Taricha). The bright yellow or orange underside of crested newts is a warning coloration which can be presented in case of perceived danger. In such a posture, the newts typically roll up and secrete a milky substance.|$|E
5|$|Fossorial creatures live in {{subterranean}} environments. Many fossorial mammals {{were classified}} under the, now obsolete, order Insectivora, such as shrews, <b>hedgehogs</b> and moles. Fossorial mammals have a fusiform body, thickest at {{the shoulders and}} tapering off at the tail and nose. Unable {{to see in the}} dark burrows, most have degenerated eyes, but degeneration varies between species; pocket gophers, for example, are only semi-fossorial and have very small yet functional eyes, in the fully fossorial marsupial mole the eyes are degenerated and useless, talpa moles have vestigial eyes and the cape golden mole has a layer of skin covering the eyes. External ears flaps are also very small or absent. Truly fossorial mammals have short, stout legs as strength is more important than speed to a burrowing mammal, but semi-fossorial mammals have cursorial legs. The front paws are broad and have strong claws to help in loosening dirt while excavating burrows, and the back paws have webbing, as well as claws, which aids in throwing loosened dirt backwards. Most have large incisors to prevent dirt from flying into their mouth.|$|E
40|$|As a major {{regulatory}} pathway for embryonic development and tissue patterning, <b>hedgehog</b> signaling is not active in most adult tissues, but is reactivated {{in a number}} of human cancer types. A major milestone in <b>hedgehog</b> signaling in cancer is the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of a smoothened inhibitor Vismodegib for treatment of basal cell carcinomas. Vismodegib can block ligand-mediated <b>hedgehog</b> signaling, but numerous additional clinical trials have failed to show significant improvements in cancer patients. Amounting evidence indicate that ligand-independent <b>hedgehog</b> signaling plays an essential role in cancer. Ligand-independent <b>hedgehog</b> signaling, also named non-canonical <b>hedgehog</b> signaling, generally is not sensitive to smoothened inhibitors. What we know about non-canonical <b>hedgehog</b> signaling in cancer, and how should we prevent its activation? In this review, we will summarize recent development of non-canonical <b>hedgehog</b> signaling in cancer, and will discuss potential ways to prevent this type of <b>hedgehog</b> signaling...|$|R

After many trials Hans My <b>Hedgehog</b> marries a princess and becomes a handsome young man. An even more popular tale in this collection, The Hare and the <b>Hedgehog,</b> is about the race between a hare, who is proud of his swift legs, and a <b>hedgehog.</b> The <b>hedgehog</b> teams up with his wife who hides {{on the other side of}} the field across which the hare and the <b>hedgehog</b> are to race. The <b>hedgehog</b> does not race all the way but simply cowers in his furrow after a few steps. When the hare has crossed the field, Mrs. <b>hedgehog</b> raises her head on the other side and announces [...] "I am here already." [...] They repeat the race until finally the hare dies of exhaustion. The story illustrates the dangers of pride on the side of the hare who cannot overcome the common <b>hedgehog's</b> cunning.|$|R
