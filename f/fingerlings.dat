5|$|The {{aquaculture}} {{potential for}} sand whiting was first investigated {{in the late}} 1980s, {{with a number of}} reports detailing both successful trials and also a number of problems with such trials. A 1988 study showed that sand whiting were more likely to grow in captivity than other whiting species, but the mortality rate of over 50% was unacceptable for use in an economic setting. A number of problems with diseases such as ulcerative dermatitis and the failure of the swim-bladder to inflate properly were also documented, however many of these initial problems have been overcome, and some facilities are breeding around 2000 larvae with a 95% survival rate. Some of these <b>fingerlings</b> are used to restock depleted estuaries, while others form the basis of commercial fish crops.|$|E

In 1992, around 200,000 young fish (<b>fingerlings),</b> propagated in DSI's Atatürk Fish Hatchery, were introduced into the reservoir.

25|$|On January 11, 2008, the Cagayan Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) {{stated that}} tilapia (species of cichlid fishes from the tilapiine cichlid tribe) {{production}} grew and Cagayan Valley {{is now the}} Philippines’ tilapia capital (Saint Peter's fish). Production supply grew 37.25% since 2003, with 14,000 metric tons (MT) in 2007. The recent aquaculture congress found that the growth of tilapia production was due to government interventions: provision of fast-growing species, accreditation of private hatcheries to ensure supply of quality <b>fingerlings,</b> establishment of demonstration farms, providing free <b>fingerlings</b> to newly constructed fishponds, and the dissemination of tilapia to Nueva Vizcaya (in Diadi town).|$|E
40|$|The {{composition}} and preferences of depth levels and habitats of pelagic <b>fingerling</b> was {{studied in the}} canyon-shaped Vír Reservoir during years 2009 - 2011. The perch (Perca fluviatilis) <b>fingerling</b> was dominant in all three years. The density of <b>fingerling</b> was above the mean in years 2009 and 2010. It was as many as 278 individuals in 100 m 3 (mean is 52 individuals in 100 m 3). A marked fall on 1, 9 individual in 100 m 3 was registered in 2011. Perch <b>fingerling</b> was mainly observed in metalimnion {{during the day and}} also at night, where concentration of oxygen was very low. The highest density of perch <b>fingerling</b> was observed in the middle part within longitudinal profile.

40|$|Survival {{from birth}} to a {{reproductive}} adult is a challenge that only robust individuals resistant {{to a variety of}} mortality factors will overcome. To assess whether survival traits share genetic architecture throughout the life cycle, we estimated genetic correlations for survival within <b>fingerling</b> stage, and across egg, <b>fingerling</b> and grow-out stages in farmed rainbow trout. Genetic parameters of survival at three life cycle stages were estimated for 249 166 individuals originating from ten year classes of a pedigreed population. Despite being an important fitness component, survival traits harboured significant but modest amount of genetic variation (h 2 = 0 · 07 – 0 · 27). Weak associations between survival during egg-fry and <b>fingerling</b> periods, between early and late <b>fingerling</b> periods (rG= 0 · 30) and generally low genetic correlations between <b>fingerling</b> and grow-out survival (mean rG= 0 · 06) suggested that life-stage specific survival traits are best regarded as separate traits. However, in the sub-set of data with detailed time of death records, positive genetic correlations between early and late <b>fingerling</b> survival (rG= 0 · 89) showed that during certain years the best genotypes in the early period were also {{among the best in the}} late period. That survival across <b>fingerling</b> period can be genetically the same, trait was indicated also by only slightly higher heritability (h 2 = 0 · 15) estimated with the survival analysis of time to death during <b>fingerling</b> period compared to the analysis treating <b>fingerling</b> survival as a binary character (h 2 = 0 · 11). The results imply that (1) inherited resistance against unknown mortality factors exists, but (2) ranking of genotypes changes across life stages...|$|R

25|$|Krill {{are small}} animals, {{considered}} {{a type of}} zooplankton, and hence need to be fished with fine-meshed plankton nets. Such nets pose several problems: they tend to clog fast, and they have high drag, producing a bow wave that deflects the krill to the sides. Trawling must hence be done at low speeds. Additionally, fine nets are delicate, and the first krill nets designed exploded while fishing through the krill schools. Furthermore, fine nets increase unwanted bycatch, such as fish <b>fingerlings,</b> which might have unforeseen side-effects on the ecosystem, even though large krill aggregations tend to be monospecific.|$|E

25|$|The fishery {{sector has}} {{continuously}} developed {{and become a}} key economic sector of the province. At present the province has around 3,200 fishing boats with power of over 67,000CV. In the year 2000, the output of sea products is estimated at 17,104 tons, of which about 1,600 tons is from raising. The province has 3 shrimp nursery stations, 8 fish nursery stations supplying 5–7 mil. tiger baby shrimps, 40 – 45mil. baby fish and 4 – 5 mil. <b>fingerlings</b> annually. At present the province has 2 factories of processing frozen sea products and 4 factories of processing dried products for exportation. The services of fishing sector such as making and repairing ships, purchasing, processing sea products and providing technical assistance and infrastructure for fishing are continuously developed.

500|$|Young American {{paddlefish}} {{are poor}} swimmers {{which makes them}} susceptible to predation. [...] Therefore, rapid first-year growth is important to their survival. [...] Fry can grow about [...] per week, and by late July the <b>fingerlings</b> are around [...] long. [...] Their rate of growth is variable and highly dependent on food abundance. [...] Higher growth rates occur in areas where food is not limited. [...] The feeding behavior of <b>fingerlings</b> {{is quite different from}} that of older juveniles and adults. They capture individual plankton one by one, which requires detection and location of individual Daphnia on approach, followed by an intercept maneuver to capture the selected prey. [...] By late September <b>fingerlings</b> have developed into juveniles, and are around [...] long. [...] After the 1st year their growth rate slows and is highly variable.

500|$|Spawning {{sites are}} usually {{a bed of}} fine gravel in a riffle above a pool. A female trout clears a redd in the gravel by turning on her side and beating her tail up and down. Female rainbow trout usually produce 2000 to 3000 [...] eggs per {{kilogram}} of weight. During spawning, the eggs fall into spaces between the gravel, and immediately the female begins digging at the upstream edge of the nest, covering the eggs with the displaced gravel. [...] As eggs are released by the female, a male moves alongside and deposits milt (sperm) over the eggs to fertilize them. The eggs usually hatch in about four to seven weeks although the time of hatching varies greatly with region and habitat. Newly hatched trout are called sac fry or alevin. In approximately two weeks, the yolk sac is completely consumed and fry commence feeding mainly on zooplankton. The growth rate of rainbow trout is variable with area, habitat, life history and {{quality and quantity of}} food. As fry grow, they begin to develop [...] "parr" [...] marks or dark vertical bars on their sides. In this juvenile stage, immature trout are often called [...] "parr" [...] because of the marks. These small juvenile trout are sometimes called <b>fingerlings</b> because they are approximately the size of a human finger. [...] In streams where rainbow trout are stocked for sport fishing but no natural reproduction occurs, some of the stocked trout may survive and grow or [...] "carryover" [...] for several seasons before they are caught or perish.|$|E
