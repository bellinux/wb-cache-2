40|$|Financial crises are {{associated}} with reduced volumes and extreme levels of rates for term inter-bank loans, reflected in the one-month and three-month Libor. We explain such stress by modeling leveraged banks' precautionary demand for liquidity. Asset shocks impair a bank's ability to roll over debt because of agency problems associated with high leverage. In turn, banks hoard liquidity and decrease term lending as their rollover risk increases over the term of the loan. High levels of short-term leverage and illiquidity of assets lead to low volumes and high rates for term borrowing. In extremis, <b>inter-bank</b> <b>markets</b> can completely freeze...|$|R

5000|$|In 1984, {{it became}} {{apparent}} that an increasing number of banks were trading actively in a variety of relatively new market instruments, notably interest rate swaps, foreign currency options and forward rate agreements. While recognizing that such instruments brought more business and greater depth to the London <b>Inter-bank</b> <b>market,</b> bankers worried that future growth could be inhibited unless a measure of uniformity was introduced. In October 1984, the British Bankers' Association (BBA)—working with other parties, such as the Bank of England—established various working parties, which eventually culminated in the production of the BBA standard for interest rate swaps, or [...] "BBAIRS" [...] terms. Part of this standard included the fixing of BBA interest-settlement rates, the predecessor of BBA Libor. From 2 September 1985, the BBAIRS terms became standard market practice. BBA Libor fixings did not commence officially before 1 January 1986. Before that date, however, some rates were fixed for a trial period commencing in December 1984.|$|E

Muranjan commented that call loans in India are provided to the bill market, rendered between banks, and given for the purpose of dealing in the bullion market and stock exchanges.

It is the most sensitive section of the money market and the changes in the demand for and supply of call loans are promptly reflected in call rates. There are now two call rates in India: the Inter bank call rate and the lending rate of DFHI. The ceilings on the call rate and inter-bank term money rate were dropped, with effect from May 1, 1989.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{framework}} {{to analyze the}} functioning of the inter-bank liquidity market and the occurrence of liquidity crises when banks can face liquidity shocks on their assets. When such shocks occur, banks are confronted with adverse selection-asset quality is private information - and moral hazard - the quality of assets can be improved through unobservable effort -. Under these conditions, the market for liquidity is shown to work as an increasing return to scale technology, i. e. the equilibrium (riskad-justed) return on liquidity increases with the aggregate volume of liquidity in the economy. As a consequence, banks always provision too little liquidity compared to the social optimum. Within this framework we derive two main results. First credit rationing on the <b>inter-bank</b> <b>market</b> is more likely to happen when the individual probability for a bank to face a liquidity shock is lower. Second ex ante competition between banks on illiquid long term investment can hamper {{the functioning of the}} <b>inter-bank</b> <b>market...</b>|$|E

Furthermore, the authors propose four leading indicators for monitoring China's financial instability, and provide a primary early warning system for China's macroprudential regulations. Finally, they conduct a test to evaluate the predictive power of the CNFSI and the early warning system with reference to the 2015 episode. Their results suggest that both work well...|$|R

40|$|Financial crises are {{associated}} with reduced volumes and extreme levels of rates for term inter-bank transactions, such as in one-month and three-month LIBOR markets. We provide an explanation of such stress in term lending by modelling leveraged banks’ precautionary demand for liquidity. When adverse asset shocks materialize, a bank’s ability to roll over debt is impaired because of agency problems associated with high leverage. In turn, a bank’s propensity to hoard liquidity is increasing, or conversely its willingness to provide term lending is decreasing, in its rollover risk over the term of the loan. High levels of short-term leverage and illiquidity of assets can thus lead to low volumes and high rates for term borrowing, even for banks with profitable lending opportunities.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report is to {{concentrate}} on performing in-depth analyses of selected issues of prominence and importance for the future success of the reform process rather than describing the current day-to-day operations and procedures in the financial sector.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the interaction between}} the roles of a bank as a facilitator of payments in the economy and as a lender. In our model, banks make loans by issuing digital claims to an entrepreneur, who then uses them to pay for inputs. Issuing digital claims has two effects on a bank’s liquidity. First, some of these claims used as payment are cashed in before the project is over, necessitating transfers in the <b>inter-bank</b> <b>market</b> to meet these intermediate liquidity needs. Second, the lending bank must transfer reserves to the other banks when the project is done to settle its claims. Each of these transfers has a cost; the endogenous interest rate in the <b>inter-bank</b> <b>market</b> and a settlement cost for final transfers. These costs, in turn, are frictions that affect bank lending. Banks in our model are strategic. If productivity is similar, a high cost of final transfers leads to a coordination friction and multiple equilibria, with each bank trying to match the average number of digital claims issued by other banks. We {{consider the}} effects of financial innovations (i. e., FinTech) on the payments system and show that a reduction in the need for intermediate liquidity can lead to an increase in the inter-bank interest rate, because it also induces each bank to increase its lending. We also show that innovations may shift investments from more productive to less productive regions...|$|E

In a cross-section regressions some variables have similar effects on financing decisions across countries, while others may play a different role; risk, measured as the volatility of the market value of assets, is the best predictor of observed leverage ratios.

This study aims to analyse the causes behind the imbalances experienced during this period, and also to draw some lessons for monetary policy and operations. Fluctuations in overnight interest rates are largely irrelevant for monetary policy unless they spill over to longer maturities as well. This usually does not happen, however, as our econometric results show, in the period considered fluctuations in liquidity had a considerable impact on the 3 -month inter-bank interest rate. The hectic fluctuations in liquidity were {{partly due to the}} Russian crisis and to the changes implemented in the MNB's set of monetary instruments. However, deficiencies in the commercial banks' liquidity management also contributed to the market turbulence. The analysis of market data revealed several occasions where market players behaved irrationally, and such behaviour resulted in long-lasting periods of disequilibrium on the money market.
