5|$|In the {{improved}} vigilance effect, groups {{are able to}} detect predators sooner than solitary individuals. For many predators, success depends on surprise. If the prey is alerted early in an attack, they have an improved chance of escape. For example, wood pigeon flocks are preyed upon by goshawks. Goshawks are less successful when attacking larger flocks of wood pigeons than they are when attacking smaller flocks. This is because the larger the flock size, {{the more likely it}} is that one bird will notice the hawk sooner and fly away. Once one pigeon flies off in alarm, the rest of the pigeons follow. Wild ostriches in Tsavo National Park in Kenya feed either alone or in groups of up to four birds. They are subject to predation by lions. As the ostrich group size increases, the frequency at which each individual raises it <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for predators decreases. Because ostriches are able to run at speeds that exceed those of lions for great distances, lions try to attack an ostrich when its head is down. By grouping, the ostriches present the lions with greater difficulty in determining how long the ostriches' heads stay down. Thus, although individual vigilance decreases, the overall vigilance of the group increases.|$|E
25|$|The head tracker {{registers}} {{the translation}} and {{rotation of the}} user's head. Pointman uses these inputs to map {{the movements of the}} user's head and torso one-for-one to those of his avatar. The virtual view changes as the user turns his <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> around or leans his torso in any direction. When the weapon is raised into an aim position its sights remain centered in the field of view, so that turning the head also adjusts the aim. The user can aim as precisely as he can hold his head on target. Hunching the head down by flexing the spine is also registered by the head's translation, and the avatar adopts a matching posture. Leaning forward and hunching are used to duck behind cover. Rising up and leaning to the side are used to look out and shoot from behind cover.|$|E
50|$|Stand at Ease (U.S.) This is {{the same}} as Parade Rest, except that {{soldiers}} are expected <b>to</b> turn their <b>heads</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at whoever is addressing them. This {{should not be confused with}} At Ease.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh--ho--I like that!" [...] said Troy, {{recovering}} himself. [...] "Why, {{her hair}} has been admired by everybody {{who has seen}} her since she has worn it loose, {{which has not been}} long. It is beautiful hair. People used <b>to</b> turn their <b>heads</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at it, poor girl!" ...|$|R
60|$|The two blacks {{looked at}} Tier earnestly; then {{they turned their}} <b>heads</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at each other. The idea struck each as bold and novel, but each saw serious {{difficulties}} in it. At length Josh, as became his superior station, took on himself the office of expressing the objections that occurred to his mind.|$|R

2500|$|The {{impact of}} Garbo's acting and screen {{presence}} quickly established her {{reputation as one}} of Hollywood's greatest actresses. Film historian and critic David Denby argues that Garbo introduced a subtlety of expression to the art of silent acting and that its effect on audiences cannot be exaggerated. She [...] "lowers her <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> calculating or flutters her lips," [...] he says. [...] "Her face darkens with a slight tightening around the eyes and mouth; she registers a passing idea with a contraction of her brows or a drooping of her lids. Worlds turned on her movements." ...|$|E
2500|$|The bonnet {{is usually}} a copper shell with {{soldered}} brass fittings. It covers the diver's head and provides sufficient space to turn the <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> out of the glazed faceplate and other viewports (windows). The front port can usually be opened for ventilation and communication when the diver is on deck, by being screwed out or swung to the side on a hinge. The other lights (another name for the viewports) are generally fixed. Viewports were glass on the early helmets, {{with some of the}} later helmets using acrylic, and are usually protected by brass or bronze grilles. [...] The helmet has fittings to connect the air line and the diver's telephone.|$|E
60|$|The <b>Head</b> began <b>to</b> <b>look</b> puzzled. There was {{something}} in his visitor's manner which suggested unpleasant possibilities.|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{would be}} no {{difficulty}} about that. Now, let us put on our disguises at once, and be off. Sometimes the turnkeys take it into their <b>heads</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> in during the night, {{and we had to}} keep one on watch while we were at work, and take to our beds when we heard a footstep approaching.|$|R
60|$|After one look, {{the hunters}} dashed {{down the hill}} and {{were in the midst of}} the {{astonished}} animals almost before they could raise their <b>heads</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at them. Now commenced a scene which it is not easy to describe correctly. Each man had selected his own group of animals, so that the whole party was scattered in a moment.|$|R
2500|$|Triathletes {{will often}} use their legs less vigorously and more {{carefully}} than other swimmers, conserving their leg muscles for the cycle and run to follow. Many triathletes use altered swim strokes {{to compensate for}} turbulent, aerated water and to conserve energy for a long swim. In addition, the majority of triathlons involve open-water (outdoor) swim stages, rather than pools with lane markers. As a result, triathletes in the swim stage must jockey for position, and can gain some advantage by drafting, following a competitor closely to swim in their slipstream. Triathletes will often use [...] "dolphin kicking" [...] and diving to make headway against waves, and body surfing to use a wave's energy {{for a bit of}} speed {{at the end of the}} swim stage. Also, open-water swims necessitate [...] "sighting": raising the <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for landmarks or buoys that mark the course. A modified stroke allows the triathlete to lift the head above water to sight without interrupting the swim or wasting energy.|$|E
2500|$|Maududi then continues, [...] "Though al-Khushoo is {{actually}} a condition of the heart, as stated by the above tradition, it is manifested by the body {{as a matter of}} course. The Shariah has enjoined certain etiquette which, on the one hand, helps produce al-Khushoo in the heart, and on the other, helps sustain the physical act of the Prayer in spite of the fluctuating condition of the heart. According to this etiquette, one should neither turn to the right or left, nor raise one's <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> up: one may, however, look around from the corner of the eye, but as far as possible, one must fix the gaze on the place where the forehead would rest in prostration; one is also forbidden to shift about, incline side ways, fold the garments or shake off dust from them. It is also forbidden that while going down for prostration, one should clean the place where one would sit or perform prostration. Similarly it is disrespectful that one should stand stuffy erect, recite the verses of the Qur'an in a loud resounding voice, or sing them, or belch or yawn repeatedly and noisily. It has also not been approved that one should offer the Prayer in a hurry. The injunction is that each article of the Prayer should be performed in perfect peace and tranquility, and unless one article has been completely performed, the next should not be begun. If one feels hurt by something during the Prayer, one may cast it aside by one hand, but moving the hand repeatedly or using both the hands for the purpose is prohibited. with this etiquette of the body, it is also important that one should irrelevant things during the Prayer. If thoughts come to the mind intention, it is a natural human weakness, but one should try one's best and try to ensure with one's utmost that the mind and heart are wholly turned towards Allah, and the mind is in full harmony and tune with the tongue, and as soon as one becomes conscious of irrelevant thoughts one should immediately turn the attention to the Prayer".|$|E
60|$|Then Shefford {{raised his}} <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> with bated breath and strange curiosity.|$|E
60|$|The {{three young}} women, who {{appeared}} to be very industrious and comfortable, raised their <b>heads</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at me, and then went on with their work. Stitch, stitch, stitch. At the same time there came from a workshop across a little yard outside the window, a regular sound of hammering that kept a kind of tune: RAT--tat-tat, RAT--tat-tat, RAT--tat-tat, without any variation.|$|R
6000|$|... "Women {{looked at}} me then; and turned their <b>heads</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> a second time. Strange that I never married. But the girl. That's what I started to tell you about. I met her a {{thousand}} miles from anywhere, and then some. And she quoted to me those very words of Thoreau that Bardwell quoted a moment ago--the ones about the day-born gods and the night-born." ...|$|R
60|$|The men obeyed, and then, for {{the first}} time, did they turn their <b>heads,</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at those they had been so vehemently pursuing. The other boat was quite {{half a mile from}} them, and it had again tacked. This last {{occurrence}} induced Spike to pull slowly ahead, in quest of another short passage to cut the fugitives off; but no such opening offered.|$|R
60|$|Miss Dunross {{laid down}} her pen, and slowly turned her <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at me.|$|E

6000|$|... “One of the Vice-Presidents,” Mr Verloc breathed out heavily; and the First Secretary of the Embassy {{raised his}} <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at him.|$|E
60|$|Had Arthur {{not been}} in quite such a hurry to leave the hotel, he might have seen {{something}} which would have interested him, namely, a very lovely woman--so lovely, indeed, that everybody turned their <b>heads</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> {{at her as she}} passed, accompanied by another woman clad in a stiff black gown, not at all lovely, and rather ancient, but, for all that, well-favoured and pleasant <b>to</b> <b>look</b> on, being duly convoyed to their room in the hotel by his friend the manager.|$|R
60|$|The three {{brothers}} turned their <b>heads</b> <b>to</b> <b>look,</b> {{and on their}} cudgel-hand, about two leagues distant, stood Solmi; to the west, and a little in front of them, Mōōt and Makkri. Upon the topmost edge of the snow-slope {{at the foot of}} which they were now encamped ran a long, low border of a kind of thorn-bush, huddling among great rocks and boulders, resembling a little the valleys of the Babbabōōmas.|$|R
6000|$|... "He startled me," [...] {{repeated}} Heyst. She {{noted the}} anxiety in his tone, {{and turned her}} <b>head</b> slightly <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at him across the table.|$|R
6000|$|The Mule {{turned his}} <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> reproachfully {{at his old}} friend, the young girl. [...] "Who can fight against magic?" [...] he asked.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well,' he said, {{lifting his}} <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at her, 'I guess I'll answer {{for my own}} faults, if {{everybody}} else'll answer for theirs.' ...|$|E
60|$|He {{turned his}} <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at her. She {{was so close}} to him that their hats collided. He was profuse in his apologies.|$|E
6000|$|... "Blaspheme {{not against}} the usages of our city," [...] said Pietro Cennini, much offended. [...] "There are new wits who think they see things more truly because they stand on their <b>heads</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at them, like {{tumblers}} and mountebanks, instead of keeping the attitude of rational men. Doubtless it makes little difference to Maestro Vaiano's monkeys whether they see our Donatello's statue of Judith with their heads or their tails uppermost." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I {{was a rare}} young devil," [...] Percival obliged, [...] "after I played {{ducks and}} drakes at home and sported out over the world. And I was some figure of a man before I lost my shape--polo, steeple-chasing, boxing. I won medals at buckjumping in Australia, and I held more than several {{swimming}} records from the {{quarter of a mile}} up. Women turned their <b>heads</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> when I went by. The women! God bless them!" ...|$|R
5000|$|Series 3 & 4: their <b>heads</b> {{returned}} <b>to</b> <b>looking</b> like dragons, with ruffs, {{though they}} had furry bodies and monkeylike tails, and they were almost identical to each other.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll ask him," [...] she replied, {{turning her}} <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for him. But he and Cassandra were {{absorbed in the}} aye-aye once more.|$|E
6000|$|... 'There, {{they are}} leaving off,' as Arthur led away the pony, and Violet began to ascend the steps, turning her <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> after him.|$|E
6000|$|... "What's wrong?" [...] {{asked the}} animal, {{slightly}} turning his wooden <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> {{at the party}} with one eye, which was a knot of wood.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's a bit o' real lace," [...] ses the gal, {{twisting}} her <b>'ead</b> round <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at the collar; [...] "it cost me one and two-three {{only last}} night." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{do you suppose}}," [...] said Mr. Jaggers, bending forward <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at the ground, {{and then}} {{throwing}} his <b>head</b> back <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at the ceiling,--"what do you suppose you are living at the rate of?" ...|$|R
50|$|One day, {{when she}} has {{established}} herself in a regular job, Fang's friend comes to see her. She was told of Feng's progressively worsening condition and <b>heads</b> off <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for him.|$|R
