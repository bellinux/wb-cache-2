Savalas <b>had</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>in</b> <b>The</b> Dirty Dozen in 1967, leading to Broccoli {{suggesting}} him to director Peter Hunt, for the role, {{in place of}} Donald Pleasence, who had appeared in You Only Live Twice.

5|$|The {{fossils of}} the Burgess Shale were hidden in store rooms until the 1960s. When Whittington {{and his colleagues}} first began to publish their Burgess finds in the early 1970s, the fossils became central to the debate about how quickly animals arose, and were {{interpreted}} as evidence that all the living bilaterian phyla <b>had</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Early Cambrian, {{along with many other}} phyla that had become extinct {{by the end of the}} Cambrian.|$|E
5|$|During the Permian, the dragonflies Odonata {{were the}} {{dominant}} aerial predator and probably dominated terrestrial insect predation as well. True Odonata {{appeared in the}} Permian and all are amphibian. Their prototypes are the oldest winged fossils, {{go back to the}} Devonian, and are different from other wings in every way. Their prototypes may have had the beginnings of many modern attributes even by late Carboniferous and it is possible that they even captured small vertebrates, for some species had a wing span of 71cm. The earliest beetle-like species during the Permian had pointed, leather like forewings with cells and pits. Hemiptera, or true bugs <b>had</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of Arctiniscytina and Paraknightia having forewings with unusual venation, possibly diverging from Blattoptera.|$|E

5|$|Hergé also {{introduced}} a new character, Peggy Alcazar, whom he had based upon the American secretary to a Ku Klux Klan spokesman whom Hergé observed in a television documentary. In his preparatory notes for the story, Hergé had considered introducing Peggy {{as the daughter of}} arms dealer Basil Bazaroff– the satirical depiction of the old times real-life arms dealer Basil Zaharoff, who <b>had</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>in</b> <b>The</b> Broken Ear. He {{also introduced}} the Jolly Follies into the story, a group who were based on three separate touring party groups that Hergé had encountered. He had initially considered a number of alternative names for the troupe, including the Turlupins, Turlurans, and Boutentrins.|$|E
5|$|Joseph-François Dailly, {{the first}} actor {{to play the}} role of Passepartout in Around the World in Eighty Days, was cast as Valdemar; another cast member of Around the World, Augustin-Guillemet Alexandre, played {{opposite}} him as Tartelet. Paul-Félix Taillade, who <b>had</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>in</b> <b>The</b> Children of Captain Grant, was cast as Doctor Ox, and Marie Daubrun, a well-known féerie actress who was also the mistress and muse of Charles Baudelaire, played Eva. The production was directed by Paul Clèves (born Paul Collin), the director of the Théâtre de la Porte Saint-Martin from 1879 to 1883. Oscar de Lagoanère, a prolific composer and music director, wrote the music for the play.|$|E
5|$|The Gillette Cup {{was first}} contested in 1963, {{as the first}} English {{domestic}} knock-out competition between first-class sides. Sussex <b>had</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Gillette Cup Final on five previous instances; they won the tournament {{in each of the}} first two years (1963 and 1964), and were runners-up in 1968, 1970 and 1973. In contrast, Somerset had only reached the final of the competition once previously, losing to Kent in 1967. Somerset were one of only two first-class counties in 1978 to have never won a domestic competition. Tony Greig, who had been the Sussex captain from 1973 to 1977, was released from his contract midway through the 1978 season.|$|E

5|$|The Olympic program {{remained}} {{similar to}} previous Winter Olympics, {{with only a}} few exceptions: neither skeleton nor military patrol events were held; curling, which <b>had</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first Winter Olympic Games, was a non-medal demonstration sport in 1932, as were a sled dog race and women's speed skating. Both men and women competed in these Games, although the only medal events women contested were the ladies' singles and pairs in figure skating. Warm weather forced officials to hold the four-man bobsleigh competition two days after the closing ceremonies, which had been conducted on February 13.|$|E
5|$|The fourth {{film in the}} Eon series, Thunderball, was {{the third}} to portray Leiter and the {{producers}} chose a third actor to play the role, Rik Van Nutter. Van Nutter was married to Swedish actress Anita Ekberg {{at the time and}} the couple had dined with Cubby and Dana Broccoli after Ekberg <b>had</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Eon-produced Call Me Bwana. Van Nutter was subsequently offered the Leiter role without an audition, although he did have screen tests with some of the Bond girls.|$|E
5|$|The {{magazine}} was canceled after the April 1941 issue, {{but when a}} boom in science fiction magazines began in 1950, the publishers revived it. The first {{issue of the new}} series was dated November 1950; a further six issues appeared, the last dated May 1952. In addition to Kuttner, contributors to the first run included Arthur J. Burks and Jack Williamson; the second run published stories by Arthur C. Clarke, Isaac Asimov, Jack Vance, and L. Sprague de Camp, among others. In the opinion of science fiction historian Joseph Marchesani, the quality of the second incarnation of the {{magazine was}} superior to the first, but it was unable to compete with the new higher-quality magazines that <b>had</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> interim.|$|E
