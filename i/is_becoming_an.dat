In the first week of the massacres, there were reports in the Israeli press that Israel did not want to put all its ground forces in Gaza because it was preparing attacks on Iran. Then there were reports it was planning attacks on Lebanon. It is a lunatic state.|$|E

Tosker, meanwhile, has lost his fortune in the stock market crash.|$|E

Women's Wear Daily Taylor Harris questioned the impact of Ratajkowski's feminism.
