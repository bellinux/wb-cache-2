40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to determine the efficacy of prophylactic administration of <b>gabexate</b> for the prevention of post-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) pancreatitis, hyperamylasemia and pancreatic pain. Patients scheduled for ERCP were randomized into two groups in a double-blind manner: the patients in the <b>gabexate</b> group were treated with continuous intravenous infusion of 300 mg <b>gabexate</b> dissolved in 500 mL Ringer's solution at 111 mL/h, starting 30 min before the endoscopic maneuvers and continuing up to 4 h after them; placebo group patients were treated only with Ringer's solution also starting 30 min before the endoscopic maneuvers and continuing up to 4 h. Data for 193 patients were analyzed. The incidence of post-ERCP pancreatitis was 3 patients (3. 1 %) in the <b>gabexate</b> group and 10 (10. 5 %) in the placebo group (P = 0. 040). The incidence of hyperamylasemia was 33 patients (33. 7 %) in the <b>gabexate</b> group and 42 (43. 7 %) in the placebo group (P = 0. 133). The incidence of pancreatic pain was 15 patients (15. 3 %) in the <b>gabexate</b> group and 28 (29. 5 %) in the placebo group (P = 0. 018).

40|$|The {{effects of}} the {{cholecystokinin}} (CCK) -receptor antagonist proglumide, the protease inhibitor <b>gabexate,</b> and the hormones secretin and cholecystokinin-octapeptide (CCK- 8) were studied in a model of acute hemorrhagic pancreatitis induced by feeding mice a choline-deficient, ethionine-supplemented (CDE) diet. Injections of <b>gabexate</b> and proglumide from initiation of CDE diet (before induction of pancreatitis) increased survival from 37 % (diet alone) to 85 and 75 %, respectively, and also ameliorated histological alterations and increases in serum amylase concentration and pancreatic activated trypsin. Secretin had no major beneficial effect. When proglumide or <b>gabexate</b> were given after induction of pancreatitis, proglumide still increased survival to 75 %, whereas <b>gabexate</b> no longer did. Injection of nontoxic doses of CCK- 8 before proglumide or <b>gabexate</b> injections completely abolished all beneficial effects and also increased the severity of pancreatitis due to CDE diet alone.

40|$|Endoscopic {{retrograde}} cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) {{is associated}} with elevated levels of pancreatic enzymes and pancreatitis. <b>Gabexate,</b> a protease inhibitor, {{has been used to}} prevent pancreatic damage related to ERCP. Methods: We conducted a multicenter, double-blind comparison of <b>gabexate</b> (1 g given by intravenous infusion starting 30 to 90 minutes before endoscopy and continuing for 12 hours afterward) with placebo (mannitol and sodium chloride, administered in the same fashion). A total of 435 adults scheduled to undergo ERCP and, when indicated, endoscopic sphincterotomy underwent randomization; 17 were excluded from the final analysis for various reasons. The remaining 418 patients (mean age, 60. 4 years) - 208 in the <b>gabexate</b> group and 210 in the placebo group-were analyzed. Acute pancreatitis was considered to be present if serum amylase or lipase levels (or both) were five times greater than the upper limits of normal in association with the onset of pancreatic pain. Results: After the procedures, 276 patients (66 percent) had elevated pancreatic-enzyme levels; the frequency was similar in the two groups. Mean serum amylase values were higher in the placebo group than in the <b>gabexate</b> group through 24 hours of observation (P= 0. 03). Twelve patients in the <b>gabexate</b> group and 29 in the placebo group had abdominal pain (6 percent vs. 14 percent, P= 0. 009). Sixteen patients in the placebo group and five in the <b>gabexate</b> group had acute pancreatitis (8 percent vs. 2 percent, P= 0. 03). Two patients treated with <b>gabexate</b> and six given placebo had adverse events, all of which resolved. Two patients given placebo died of acute pancreatitis; one was excluded from the evaluation because pancreatitis was present before endoscopy. One patient in the <b>gabexate</b> group died, from a myocardial infarction.

40|$|Abstract Background Acute {{pancreatitis}} is {{a common}} complication of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and the benefit of its pharmacological treatment is unclear. Although prophylactic use of <b>gabexate</b> for the reduction of pancreatic injury after ERCP has been evaluated, the discrepancy about gabexate's beneficial effect on pancreatic injury still exists. This study aimed {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} and safety of <b>gabexate</b> in the prophylaxis of post-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography pancreatitis (PEP). Methods We employed the method recommended by the Cochrane Collaboration to perform a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of <b>gabexate</b> in the prevention of post-ERCP pancreatitis (PEP) including three RCTs conducted in Italy and one in China. Results All of the four RCTs were of high quality. When the RCTs were analyzed, odds ratios (OR) for <b>gabexate</b> mesilate were 0. 67 [95 % CI (0. 31 ~ 1. 47), p = 0. 32] for PEP, 3. 78 [95 % CI (0. 62 ~ 22. 98), p = 0. 15] for severe PEP, 0. 68 [95 % CI (0. 19 ~ 2. 43), p = 0. 56] for the case-fatality of PEP, 0. 88 [95 % CI (0. 72 ~ 1. 07), p = 0. 20] for post-ERCP hyperamylasemia, 0. 69 [95 % CI (0. 39 ~ 1. 21), p = 0. 19] for post-ERCP abdominal pain, thus indicating no beneficial effects of <b>gabexate</b> on acute pancreatitis, the death rate of PEP, hyperamylasemia and abdominal pain. No evidence of publication bias was found. Conclusion <b>Gabexate</b> mesilate can not prevent the pancreatic injury after ERCP.

40|$|Background/Aims: Acute {{pancreatitis}} is {{a common}} complication of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). Only a few pharmacologic agents {{have been shown to}} have potential efficacy for the prophylactic treatment of post-ERCP pancreatitis (PEP). The aim {{of this study was to}} determine whether prophylactic <b>gabexate</b> and ulinastatin can decrease the incidence of PEP. Methods: From January 2005 to April 2010, 1, 679 patients undergoing ERCP treatment were consecutively enrolled in the study. After selective exclusion, a total of 1, 480 patients were included in the analysis. The patients were separated into 3 groups according to the prophylactic administration of <b>gabexate</b> (593 patients), ulinastatin (229 patients), or saline solution (658 patients) and analyzed retrospectively. The primary outcome measurements were the incidence of pancreatitis and hyperamylasemia. Results: PEP occurred in 21 of the 593 (3. 5 %) patients who received <b>gabexate,</b> 16 of the 229 (7. 0 %) patients who received ulinastatin, and 48 of the 658 (7. 3 %) patients who received a saline solution.

40|$|Received on 26 - 06 - 2012 Accepted on 10 - 07 - 2012 <b>Gabexate</b> {{mesilate}} {{has been}} mainly {{used in the}} treatment of disseminated intravascular coagration (DIC) in Japan since 1983. Recently, several generic versions of injectable <b>gabexate</b> mesilate with or without d-mannitol as an additive have been put on the Japanese market. In our study, thermo gravimetry (TG) did not show any differences between <b>gabexate</b> mesilate products with or without d-mannitol as an additive. However, differential thermal analysis (DTA) showed a significant change in absorption derived from endothermic reactions. Differential thermal analysis for M 1, M 2 and M 3, with 100 mg of d-mannitol produced two endothermic peaks during the first rise in temperature from 30 ◦ C to 170 ◦ C, followed by an exothermic peak derived from the 170 ◦ C to 30 ◦ C cooling period. During the second rise in temperature from 30 ◦ C to 170 ◦ C another endothermic peak was produced. On the other hand, N 1, N 2, N 3, and FOY without d-mannitol derived from <b>gabexate</b> mesilate produced only one endothermic peak, and were followed by no exothermic peaks during the cooling period. Interestingly, a glass transition was found at the second rise in temperature. In addition, we confirmed that <b>gabexate</b> mesilate undergoes hydrolysis in the presence of water due to the ester bonds in its chemical structure.

40|$|Pancreatitis {{remains the}} most common and {{potentially}} fatal complication following ERCP. Various pharmacological agents have been used in an attempt to prevent post-ERCP pancreatitis, but most randomized controlled trials have failed to demonstrate their efficacy. Antiproteases, which have been clinically used to manage acute pancreatitis, would theoretically reduce pancreatic injury after ERCP because activation of proteolytic enzymes is considered {{to play an important role}} in the pathogenesis of post-ERCP pancreatitis. <b>Gabexate</b> and ulinastatin have recently been evaluated regarding their efficacy in preventing post-ERCP pancreatitis. Long-term (12 hours) infusion of <b>gabexate</b> significantly decreased the incidence of post-ERCP pancreatitis; however, no prophylactic effect was observed for short-term infusion (2. 5 and 6. 5 hours). These results may be due to the short-life of <b>gabexate</b> (55 seconds). Since long-term infusion requires additional hospitalization, the use of <b>gabexate</b> in all patients at average risk of developing post-ERCP pancreatitis is an expensive strategy. Ulinastatin has a half-life of 35 minutes and can be given as a bolus infusion. Short-term (10 minutes) administration of ulinastatin showed a significant reduction in the incidence of post-ERCP pancreatitis in one randomized controlled trial. Ulinastatin is superior to <b>gabexate</b> in terms of cost because it does not require additional hospitalization. At present, there is no other randomized, placebo-controlled trial on ulinastatin under way. Large scale randomized controlled trials revealed that both the long-term infusion of <b>gabexate</b> and the short-term administration of ulinastatin may reduce pancreatic injury, but these studies involve patients at average risk of developing post-ERCP pancreatitis. Additional research is needed to confirm the preventive efficacy of these antiproteases in patients at a high risk of developing post-ERCP pancreatitis...|$|E
40|$|The {{employment}} of anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibodies represents a {{backbone of the}} therapeutic options {{for the treatment of}} metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). However, this therapy is poorly effective or ineffective in unselected patients. Mutations in KRAS, BRAF and PIK 3 CA genes have recently emerged as the best predictive factors of low/absent response to EGFR-targeted therapy. Due to the need for efficacious treatment options for mCRC patients bearing these mutations, in this short report we examined the antitumoral activity of the protease inhibitor <b>gabexate</b> mesilate, alone and in combination with the anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody cetuximab, in a panel of human CRC cell lines harbouring a different expression pattern of wild-type/mutated KRAS, BRAF and PIK 3 CA genes. Results obtained showed that <b>gabexate</b> mesilate significantly inhibited the growth, invasive potential and tumour-induced angiogenesis in all the CRC cells employed in this study (including those ones harbouring dual KRAS/PIK 3 CA or BRAF/PIK 3 CA mutation), while cetuximab affected these parameters only in CRC cells with KRAS, BRAF and PIK 3 CA wild-type. Notably, the antitumoral efficacy of <b>gabexate</b> mesilate and cetuximab in combination was found to be not superior than that observed with <b>gabexate</b> mesilate as single agent. Overall, these preliminary findings suggest that <b>gabexate</b> mesilate could represent a promising therapeutic option for mCRC patients, particularly for those harbouring KRAS, BRAF and PIK 3 CA mutations, either as mono-therapy or in addition to standard chemotherapy regimens.

40|$|There is no proven {{specific}} {{drug therapy}} {{for the treatment}} of acute pancreatitis, including protease inhibitors. In this virtual Round Table, our invited authors reviewed the past, present, and projected future clinical relevance of protease inhibitors. Through their discussion, protease inhibitors are demonstrated to have broad inhibitory actions on serine proteases, the coagulation system, the complement system and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, both in vitro and in vivo. We are assured that proteases remain an important and active field of study. Several protease inhibitors, including <b>gabexate</b> mesilate, nafamostat mesilate and ulinastatin, have been used {{for the treatment of}} acute pancreatitis in Japan [1, 2]. Camostat mesilate, an orally active protease inhibitor, has also been used for the treatment of chronic pancreatitis [2].

40|$|Patients {{with small}} vessel {{vasculitis}} present fluctuating antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) levels {{to the point}} that positive ANCA may be missed even if only up to 10 % of patients with microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) are ANCA-negative. The first-line treatment of MPA is the association of steroids and cyclophosphamide, especially {{in the presence of a}} rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis. Plasmapheresis, intravenous immunoglobulins, and tumor necrosis factor inhibitors have been proposed as alternative to standard therapy. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a possible event in the course of small vessel vasculitis. <b>Gabexate</b> mesylate is a protease inhibitor able to suppress endothelial cell injury, and it may be administered to treat DIC related to different diseases. In ANCA-associated vasculitis, cytokines play a key role in promoting endothelial damage. DIC-related thrombocytopenia may be misinterpreted as drug-induced because of the immunosuppressive properties of cyclophosphamide. Two cases of ANCA-positive MPA associated with DIC and treated with <b>gabexate</b> are reported in the literature with improvement of both hematological disorder and renal function. Our patient presented a rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, and the renal biopsy showed MPA, in the absence of ANCA. After two weeks of steroid treatment, our patient developed a DIC. This case represents the first report of ANCA-negative MPA managed with <b>gabexate,</b> which showed improvement of coagulation disorders and kidney function.

40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} {{the efficacy of}} continuous regional arterial infusion therapy (CRAI) with <b>gabexate</b> mesilate and antibiotics for severe acute pancreatitis (SAP). METHODS: We conducted a prospective study on patients who developed SAP with or without CRAI. Out of 18 patients fulfilled clinical diagnostic criteria for SAP in Japan, 9 patients underwent CRAI, while 9 patients underwent conventional systemic protease inhibitor and antibiotics therapy (non-CRAI). CRAI was initiated within 72 h of the onset of pancreatitis. <b>Gabexate</b> mesilate (2400 mg/d) was continuously administered for 3 to 5 d. The clinical outcome including serum inflammation-related parameters were examined. RESULTS: The duration of abdominal pain in the CRAI group was 1. 9 ± 0. 26 d, whereas that in the non-CRAI group was 4. 3 ± 0. 50. The duration of SIRS in the CRAI group was 2. 2 ± 0. 22 d, whereas that in the non-CRAI group was 3. 2 ± 0. 28. Abdominal pain and SIRS disappeared significantly {{in a short period}} of time after the initiation of CRAI using <b>gabexate</b> mesilate. The average length of hospitalization significantly differed between the CRAI and non-CRAI groups, 53. 3 ± 7. 9 d and 87. 4 ± 13. 9 d, respectively. During the first two weeks, levels of serum CRP and the IL 6 /IL 10 ratio in the CRAI group tended to have a rapid decrease compared to those in the non-CRAI group.

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of the pharmacological prevention of post-ERCP pancreatitis can be established only from large controlled randomized studies. Over the last decade, fifteen studies dealt with these characteristics and a cumulative series of about 3, 000 non-selected patients were evaluated. Cumulating the data of the placebo groups, the median incidence of post-ERCP pancreatitis was 8. 7 % (mean 9. 3 %), the range varied from 1. 6 to 17. 7 % likely due to case mix and/or different criteria defining acute pancreatitis. These variables, other than differences in the modalities of {{the administration of the}} drugs, could explain their contrasting effectiveness between the studies. Somatostatin and octreotide were the prophylactic drugs more frequently experimented (8 studies) followed by corticosteroids such as hydrocortisone, prednisone or methylprednisolone (four studies) and <b>gabexate</b> (three studies). While octreotide was confirmed to be ineffective, somatostatin and <b>gabexate</b> seem to be the best for the prevention of post-ERCP pancreatitis, but both can present some limits such as unreported sample size calculation in the statistical analysis for somatostatin studies and lack of widespread commercial availability for <b>gabexate.</b> Pharmacoeconomic studies are lacking in English language literature.

An initial meta-analysis of all available controlled trials on this topic has confirmed these findings. The indiscriminate use of these drugs in all patients is unlikely to be cost-effective, but the selective use of prophylaxis for high-risk patients might be advocated. Moreover, inasmuch as 85 % of complications developed within 4 to 6 hours of completing the ERCP, it would be reasonable to infuse drugs only for this limited length of time. A recent prospective trial, carried out on high-risk patients, has surprisingly documented a higher incidence, although a non-significant one, of pancreatitis in patients who received short-term prophylaxis with somatostatin or <b>gabexate</b> mesilate than those given a placebo: 11. 5 % and 8. 1 % vs. 6. 5 %, respectively. In order to explore this discrepancy, the original meta-analysis was updated by including data of this negative trial: heterogeneity among the trials was apparent. A careful scrutiny of the most recent studies has revealed differences in patient population, protocols of drug administration, technique and operator-related risk factors for complications among the trials, which could explain, by themselves, the contrasting results reported by the interventional studies. In conclusion, current literature does not support the prophylactic use of either somatostatin or <b>gabexate</b> mesilate for the prevention of ERCP-related pancreatic damage, even in patients deemed to be at high risk for complications.

All of these reactions to ioxaglate were reversed by the pretreatment with <b>gabexate</b> mesilate (10 and 50 mg kg− 1, 5 min prior to injection) or nafamostat mesilate (3 and 10 mg kg− 1), in which the inhibition was complete after {{injection of}} nafamostat mesilate (10 mg kg− 1). Both <b>gabexate</b> mesilate and nafamostat mesilate inhibited the activity of purified human lung tryptase, although the latter compound was far more potent than the former. Ioxaglate enhanced the nafamostat-sensitive protease activity in the extracellular fluid of rat peritoneal mast cell suspensions. Tryptase enhanced the permeability of protein through the monolayer of cultured human pulmonary arterial endothelial cells. Ioxaglate, when applied in combination with rat peritoneal mast cells, also produced the endothelial barrier dysfunction. These effects of tryptase and ioxaglate were reversed by nafamostat mesilate. Consistent with these findings, immunofluorescence morphological analysis revealed that tryptase or ioxaglate in combination with mast cells increased actin stress fibre formation while decreasing VE-cadherin immunoreactivity.

Compared with the placebo, ulinastatin had significantly better effects in preventing post-ERCP pancreatitis (OR= 0. 26, 95 %CI: 0. 13 - 0. 53, P= 0. 000 2), hyperamylasemia (OR= 0. 47, 95 %CI: 0. 33 - 0. 67, P＜ 0. 001), and abdominal pain (OR= 0. 56, 95 %CI: 0. 34 - 0. 91, P= 0. 020). Compared with <b>gabexate,</b> ulinastatin had similar effects in preventing post-ERCP pancreatitis, hyperamylasemia, and abdominal pain (P= 0. 52, 0. 13, and 0. 79); low-dose ulinastatin also had similar effects as <b>gabexate</b> in preventing post-ERCP pancreatitis and hyperamylasemia (P= 0. 49 and 0  25). The funnel plots based on the effect of ulinastatin in preventing post-ERCP pancreatitis were slightly asymmetric, which suggested the presence of publication bias. ConclusionUlinastatin (≥ 15 × 104 U) can effectively prevent post-ERCP pancreatitis, hyperlipidemia, and abdominal pain in the general population and it is recommended to start using this drug before surgery...|$|E
40|$|P>Bronchiolitis obliterans {{syndrome}} (BOS) {{is characterized}} by persistent alloreactive, infective and non-specific epithelial injury, loss of epithelial integrity and dysregulated repair. We have reported increased apoptosis of epithelial cells collected from the large airway in lung transplant recipients. As part of the alloreactive response, T cells induce apoptosis of target epithelial cells by secreting granzyme b. We hypothesized that granzyme b would be increased in lung transplant patients with acute rejection and BOS and that commonly used immunosuppressive agents would fail to suppress this serine protease adequately. We investigated intracellular T cell granzyme b in blood, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and large airway brushing (23 controls, 29 stable transplant, 23 BOS, 28 acute rejection, 31 infection) using flow cytometry and assessed the effect of clinically relevant concentrations of cyclosporin A, tacrolimus, methylprednisolone and a protease inhibitor, <b>gabexate</b> mesilate, on in vitro granzyme b production. Granzyme b was increased significantly in all compartments of all transplant groups compared to controls. Surprisingly, granzyme b was even higher in patients with BOS than in patients with acute rejection. In longitudinal analysis in three patients, blood granzyme b increased prior to or {{at the onset of}} BOS. In vitro, methylprednisolone and <b>gabexate</b> mesilate had no effect and cyclosporin A and tacrolimus only a moderate effect on production of granzyme b by CD 8 + T cells. Increased T cell granzyme b production may contribute to BOS pathogenesis and is not curtailed by current immunosuppressants. Longitudinal investigation of granzyme b in blood may provide an adjunctive non-invasive method for predicting BOS/OB...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} {{our experience}} of resectional surgery with microsurgical reconstruction of the hepatic arteries in 20 cases with biliary tract malignancy. Hepatic artery thrombosis (HAT) is a lethal complication; therefore, {{it is important to}} perform microsurgical reconstruction safely. Recently, we adopted the back wall support suture technique with double needle sutures that does not require the damaged short arteries to be turned over. In this technique, each stitch is placed from the inner side to the outer side to keep endothelial cells. The {{purpose of this study was}} to develop safety methods. From 2003 to 2012, 20 patients with biliary tract malignancy with possible involvement of the hepatic arteries underwent resectional surgery with microvascular reconstruction (cholangiocarcinoma: n = 15; others: n = 5). For this cohort study, patients were divided into two groups: group I (n = 5) included patients who underwent the conventional ‘twist technique' and group II (n = 15) included patients who underwent the microsurgical back wall support suture technique with double needle sutures and received <b>gabexate</b> mesilate, a strong serine protease inhibitor (40 mg/kg/day) for 7 days. We investigated HAT using Doppler ultrasonography for 10 days. No postoperative mortality was observed. The incidence of HAT was only one case in group I, and there was no significant difference between the two groups. However, the value of the pulsatile index and acceleration time were significantly improved in group II. In conclusion, the back wall support suture technique with <b>gabexate</b> mesilate administration during microvascular reconstruction was found to be safe. It is important to keep endothelial cells healthy for microvascular reconstruction...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{management}} of acute pancreatitis (AP) is still based on speculative and unproven paradigms in many centers.

Methods: A comprehensive Medline and Cochrane Library search was performed evaluating the indication and timing of interventional and surgical approaches, {{and the value of}} aprotinin, lexipafant, <b>gabexate</b> mesylate, and octreotide treatment. Each study was ranked according to the evidence-based methodology of Sackett; whenever feasible, we performed new meta-analyses using the random-effects model. Recommendations were based on the available level of evidence (A large randomized; B small randomized; C prospective trial). Results: None of the evaluated medical treatments is recommended (level A). Patients with AP should receive early enteral nutritio...|$|E

40|$|We {{designed}} this study in sows {{to investigate the}} enzyme inhibitory action of <b>gabexate</b> mesylate (GM) directly in the pancreatic juice. We studied 16 sows, each weighing about 130 kg. The pancreatic duct was identified and cannulated to collect the pancreatic juice. Sows in the treated group received intravenous GM infusion at a dose of 1000 mg over 24 h. Control sows underwent the same sampling schedule while receiving physiological solution. GM inhibited the two pancreatic enzymes amylase and phospholipase A 2 (PA 2) in pancreatic juice. Thus, the enzyme inhibition in the pancreatic gland itself and {{the central role of}} PA 2 inhibition in the enzyme cascade responsible for activating other proteases confirm the therapeutic use of GM in acute pancreatitis...|$|E
40|$|Background: The Italian Association for the Study of the Pancreas {{released}} a diagnostic and therapeutic algorithm for acute pancreatitis in 1999. Aim: This {{study focused on}} {{the analysis of the}} therapeutic approach for the treatment of acute pancreatitis in Italy. Patients: One thousand, one hundred and seventy-three patients were recruited: 1006 patients (85. 8 %) had mild acute pancreatitis (MAP) and 167 (14. 2 %) had the severe acute pancreatitis (SAP); 161 patients showed pancreatic necrosis at computed tomography; 121 patients (10. 3 %) had sequelae and 36 (3. 1 %) died. Results: Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and tramadol were used more frequently in patients with the MAP whereas opioids and the association schedules were used more frequently in patients with the SAP (P < 0. 001). <b>Gabexate</b> mesilate was utilised in 831 out of 1173 patients (70. 8 %); in particular, <b>gabexate</b> mesilate was used in 70. 6 % patients with MAP and in 73. 1 % of those with SAP (P = 0. 521). The duration of the drug administration was significantly shorter in those having MAP than in those having the SAP (P < 0. 001). The antibiotics most frequently used for the prophylaxis against infection from pancreatic necrosis (43. 1 %) were carbapenems. Only a small number of patients received enteral nutrition (4. 7 %). Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was carried out in 344 of the 1173 patients (29. 3 %). Surgery was performed in 48 with SAP (19 had elective biliary surgery and 29 had pancreatic surgery). Conclusions: The results of this survey indicate a lack of compliance with the guidelines which regard the indications mainly for interventional endoscopy and surgery. © 2007 Editrice Gastroenterologica Italiana S. r. l...|$|E
40|$|A 49 -year-old semi-conscious {{woman was}} {{admitted}} due to fever and dehydration. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), renal dysfunction and diabetic ketoacidosis were detected. Whole body computed tomography showed multiple nodular lesions in bilateral lungs and kidneys indicating septic emboli, and intrauterine lesions. We diagnosed multiple organ failure followed by intrauterine infection due to untreated diabetes mellitus. Vaginal discharge and blood culture revealed Klebsiella pneumoniae. We used multi-antibiotics for sepsis,respirator at low tidal volume ventilation, 200 mg of sivelestat sodium hydrate and 300 mg of hydrocortisone for respiratory failure, <b>gabexate</b> mesilate and anti-thrombin III for DIC, transfusion for bleeding from uterus and regular insulin {{aiming for a}} blood glucose range of from 80 to 140 mg/dl.

40|$|Background. The {{putative}} circulating factor {{responsible for}} the glomerular permeability alterations induced in vitro by serum from patients affected by focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) remains unidentified. Wehave observed that a serine proteinase isolated from patient serum increases albumin permeability in isolated glomeruli. The objective {{of the present study}} was to determine the effect of various proteinase inhibitors on glomerular albumin permeability (Palb) in isolated glomeruli incubated with FSGS serum. Methods. The study population consisted of 12 FSGS patients (eight males; mean age: 21 ± 10 years) previously shown to have elevated serum albumin permeability activity. Palb was determined by measuring the change in glomerular volume induced by applying oncotic gradients to isolated healthy rat glomeruli treated with patient serum in comparison to control serum. Solutions of seven different proteinase inhibitors (0. 5 mg/ml) were added to the incubation media with the sera (1 : 1 vol/vol) : serine proteinase inhibitors (PMSF, leupeptin, aprotinin, <b>gabexate</b> mesylate), the cysteine proteinase inhibitor E- 64, the metalloproteinase inhibitor EDTA and the aspartate proteinase inhibitor pepstatin. Sera from the same patients were also tested with the addition to the incubation media of quinaprilat, an inhibitor of the metalloproteinase angiotensin-converting enzyme. Results. Mean Palb of the sera was 0. 86 ± 0. 11, with the addition of PMSF 0. 41 ± 0. 09, leupeptin 0. 30 ± 0. 17, aprotinin 0. 09 ± 0. 14, <b>gabexate</b> mesylate 0. 27 ± 0. 25, E- 64 0. 81 ± 0. 09, EDTA 0. 68 ± 0. 10 or pepstatin 0. 76 ± 0. 11. The mean Palb of the sera combined with quinaprilat was reduced to 0. 34 ± 0. 35. Thus, only the serine proteinase inhibitors consistently blocked the increased Palb induced by the FSGS sera. Conclusions. In the cascade of events that lead to the initiation of glomerular fibrosis in FSGS, the putative glomerular permeability factor associated with FSGS may require a serine proteinase to effect its activity...|$|E
40|$|A 59 -year {{old woman}} with SLE was {{admitted}} to our hospital {{for the treatment of}} pulmonary miliary tuberculosis. She was given isoniazid and rifampicin, as an initial treatment regimen. On the 10 th hospital day, she suddenly developed nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and left back pain. Furthermore, marked elevation of serum amylase level was observed. From her symptoms and laboratory findings, she was diagnosed as having acute pancreatitis and administered <b>gabexate</b> mesilate and antibiotics. In spite of treatment, her pancreatitis became worse gradually, and she developed respiratory distress. Methylprednisolone pulse therapy was performed, but she was complicated with pulmonary hemorrhage and died of respiratory failure. Autopsy findings suggested that acute pan- creatitis was associated with the vasculitis of SLE. To our knowledge, there have been few SLE patients complicated with acute pancreatitis, and the pathophysiology of SLE pan- creatitis is still unclear.

40|$|Pancreaticopleural fistula is an {{uncommon}} complication of chronic pancreatitis. We report {{a case of}} pan-creaticopleural fistula that was presented with right-sided hemothorax. A 49 -year-old male {{with a history of}} chronic alcoholism was presented with a month of dyspnea. A chest radiography showed a right-sided massive pleural effusion with old-blood-colored fluids and amylase levels of 1, 020 IU/L. On the chest computerized tomography (CT), there was pleural effusion and a well-defined tract from the posterior mediastinum to the pseudocyst in the tail of the pancreas. Even with conservative treatment with closed thoracostomy, octreotide and <b>gabexate</b> mesi-late, he developed hemothorax. Abdominal CT revealed an increase of the hemorrhagic pancreatic pseudocyst. Distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy and external drainage of the pancreaticopleural fistula on the posterior mediasternum were performed.
