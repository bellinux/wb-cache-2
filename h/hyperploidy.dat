40|$|Aneuploidy, an {{abnormal}} {{number of copies}} of a genomic region, might be a significant source for neuronal complexity, intercellular diversity, and evolution. Genomic instability associated with aneuploidy, however, {{can also lead to}} developmental abnormalities and decreased cellular fitness. Here we show that neurons with a more-than-diploid content of DNA are increased in preclinical stages of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and are selectively affected by cell death during progression of the disease. Present findings show that neuronal <b>hyperploidy</b> in AD is associated with a decreased viability. <b>Hyperploidy</b> of neurons thus represents a direct molecular signature of cells prone to death in AD and indicates that a failure of neuronal differentiation is a critical pathogenetic event in AD...|$|E
40|$|The {{sphingolipid}} ceramide {{has been}} recognized as an important mediator in the apoptotic machinery, and its efficient conversion to glucosylceramide {{has been associated with}} multidrug resistance. Therefore, inhibitors of glucosylceramide synthase are explored as tools for treatment of cancer. In this study, we used (D,L) -threo- 1 -phenyl- 2 -decanoylamino- 3 -morpholino- 1 -propanol to sensitize Neuro- 2 a murine neuroblastoma cells to the microtubule-stabilizing agent paclitaxel. This treatment resulted in a synergistic inhibition of viable cell number increase, which was based on a novel mechanism: (a) After a transient mitotic arrest, cells proceeded through an aberrant cell cycle resulting in <b>hyperploidy.</b> Apoptosis also occurred but to a very limited extent. (b) <b>Hyperploidy</b> was not abrogated by blocking de novo sphingolipid biosynthesis using ISP- 1, ruling out involvement of ceramide as a mediator. (c) Cyclin-dependent kinase 1 and 2 activities were synergistically decreased on treatment. In conclusion, instead of inducing apoptosis through ceramide accumulation, (D,L) -threo- 1 -phenyl- 2 -decanoylamino- 3 -morpholino- 1 -propanol by itself affects cell cycle-related proteins in paclitaxel-arrested Neuro- 2 a cells resulting in aberrant cell cycle progression leading to <b>hyperploidy...</b>|$|E
40|$|Fluorescence in situ {{hybridization}} (FISH) assay {{was used}} to detect tumor cells in the urine sediment of patients diagnosed as having urinary bladder cancer (UBC). For this, the investigators applied a fluorescence DNA probe kit (UroVysion) that could reveal the cytogenetic abnormalities characteristic for UBC, such as <b>hyperploidy</b> for chromosomes 3, 7, and 17 and deletion of the 9 p 21 locus, in the cast-off cells. Twenty-eight patients with the primary diagnosis of UBC, 12 with its suspected recurrence, 3 subjects without UBC were examined. The findings were compared with cystoscopic data after urine samples were taken. The sensitivity of the UroVysion test totaled 78. 5 ± 9. 7 % for all stages of primary cancer (pT 1 -pT 4), 87. 5 ± 11. 6 % for its early stage (рТ 1), and 100 % for UBC recurrences. <b>Hyperploidy</b> was a predominant type of cytogenetic abnormalities in the cast-off tumor cells. Among the abnormal cells, the types of <b>hyperploidy</b> (tri-, tetrasomy) were most common for chromosome 3 and less for chromosome 7. Thus, the UroVysion test is a noninvasive highly sensitive tool {{that may be used}} in clinical practice to improve the diagnosis of UBC, to detect recurrences, and to monitor the efficiency of treatment. </p...|$|E

As a curcumin analogue, PGV- 1 was considered to have anticancer activities. This research was conducted to study the effect of PGV- 1 on the cycle progression of T 47 D cells. Cyto-toxic effects of PGV- 1 on T 47 D cells were determined using MTT assay, and the the effect on cell cycle progression was carried out using flowcytometry. Western blot {{analysis was used to}} analyze protein expression correspond-ing to cell cycle progression. The result showed that at the concentration of 2. 5 µM PGV- 1 inhibited cell cycle progression through G 2 /M arrest and induced of cells <b>hyperploidy</b> formation.

40|$|Retinal {{ganglion}} cells (RGCs) are neurons that relay visual {{signals from}} the retina to the brain. The RGC cell bodies reside in the retina and their fibers form the optic nerve. Full transection (axotomy) of the optic nerve is an extra-retinal injury model of RGC degeneration. Optic nerve transection permits time-kinetic studies of neurodegenerative mechanisms in neurons and resident glia of the retina, the early events of which are reported here. One day after injury, and before atrophy of RGC cell bodies was apparent, glia had increased levels of phospho-Akt, phospho-S 6, and phospho-ERK 1 / 2; however, these signals were not detected in injured RGCs. Three days after injury there were increased levels of phospho-Rb and cyclin A proteins detected in RGCs, whereas these signals were not detected in glia. DNA <b>hyperploidy</b> was also detected in RGCs, indicative of cell cycle re-entry by these post-mitotic neurons. These events culminated in RGC death, which is delayed by pharmacological inhibition of the MAPK/ERK pathway. Our data show that a remote injury to RGC axons rapidly conveys a signal that activates retinal glia, followed by RGC cell cycle re-entry, DNA <b>hyperploidy,</b> and neuronal death that is delayed by preventing glial MAPK/ERK activation. These results demonstrate that complex and variable neuro-glia interactions regulat...|$|E
40|$|On Moon and Mars, {{there will}} be more galactic cosmic rays and higher {{radiation}} doses than on Earth. Our experimental studies showed that heavy ion radiation can effectively cause mutation and chromosome aberrations and that high Linear Energy Transfer (LET) heavy-ion induced mutants can be irreversible. Chromosome translocations and deletions are common in cells irradiated by heavy particles, and ionizing radiations are effective in causing <b>hyperploidy.</b> The importance of the genetic changes in the evolution of life is an interesting question. Through evolution, there is an increase of DNA content in cells from lower forms of life to higher organisms. The DNA content, however, reached a plateau in vertebrates. By increasing DNA content, there can be an increase of information in the cell. For a given DNA content, the quality of information can be changed by rearranging the DNA. Because radiation can cause <b>hyperploidy,</b> an increase of DNA content in cells, and can induce DNA rearrangement, {{it is likely that the}} evolution of life on Mars will be effected by its radiation environment. A simple analysis shows that the radiation level on Mars may cause a mutation frequency comparable to that of the spontaneous mutation rate on Earth. To the extent that mutation plays a role in adaptation, radiation alone on Mars may thus provide sufficient mutation for the evolution of life...|$|E

40|$|Aberrations in {{centrosome}} {{numbers have}} long been implicated in aneuploidy and tumorigenesis, but their origins are unknown. Here we have examined how overexpression of Aurora-A kinase causes centrosome amplification in cultured cells. We show that excess Aurora-A does not deregulate centrosome duplication but gives rise to extra centrosomes through defects in cell division and consequent tetraploidization. Over expression of other mitotic kinases (Polo-like kinase 1 and Aurora-B) also causes multinucleation and concomitant increases in centrosome numbers. Absence of a p 53 checkpoint exacerbates this phenotype, providing a plausible explanation for the centrosome amplification typical of p 53 -/- cells. We propose that errors during cell division, combined with the inability to detect the resulting <b>hyperploidy,</b> constitute a major cause for numerical centrosome aberrations in tumors...|$|E
40|$|Cancer cells {{accommodate}} multiple {{genetic and}} epigenetic alterations that initially activate intrinsic (cell-autonomous) and extrinsic (immune-mediated) oncosuppressive mechanisms. Only once these barriers to oncogenesis have been overcome can malignant growth proceed unrestrained. Tetraploidization {{can contribute to}} oncogenesis because hyperploid cells are genomically unstable. We report that hyperploid cancer cells become immunogenic because of a constitutive endoplasmic reticulum stress response resulting in the aberrant cell surface exposure of calreticulin. Hyperploid, calreticulin-exposing cancer cells readily proliferated in immunodeficient mice and conserved their increased DNA content. In contrast, hyperploid cells injected into immunocompetent mice generated tumors only after a delay, and such tumors exhibited reduced DNA content, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and calreticulin exposure.

40|$|A basic {{assumption}} {{about the}} normal nervous {{system is that}} its neurons possess identical genomes. Here we present direct evidence for genomic variability, manifested as chromosomal aneuploidy, among developing and mature neurons. Analysis of mouse embryonic cerebral cortical neuroblasts in situ detected lagging chromosomes during mitosis, suggesting the normal generation of aneuploidy in these somatic cells. Spectral karyotype analysis identified ≈ 33 % of neuroblasts as aneuploid. Most cells lacked one chromosome, whereas others showed <b>hyperploidy,</b> monosomy, and/or trisomy. The prevalence of aneuploidy was reduced by culturing cortical explants in medium containing fibroblast growth factor 2. Interphase {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} on embryonic cortical cells supported the rate of aneuploidy observed by spectral karyotyping and detected aneuploidy in adult neurons.

Chinese hamster cells have little or no MT activity and the presence of human chromosome 10 was a necessary condition for MT activity in cell hybrids. In some cell hybrids carrying chromosome 10, however, MT activity was not higher than that of hamster cells. As an explanation for this result, genetic determinants repressing MT expression and/or activity might be present in other human chromosomes carried by MT-negative cell hybrids.

Methods:We examined possible antitumor effects of adenoviruses with a deletion of the E 1 B- 55 kD gene (Ad-delE 1 B 55) on mesothelioma and investigated combinatory actions with the first-line chemotherapeutic agents. Results:Ad-delE 1 B 55 produced cytotoxicity on mesothelioma cells, which was associated with p 53 phosphorylation, pRb dephosphorylation, and cleavage of caspases. Ad-delE 1 B 55 –infected cells displayed <b>hyperploidy</b> at the cell-cycle analysis and showed enlarged nuclear configurations. Combination of Ad-delE 1 B 55 plus cisplatin or pemetrexed produced antitumor effects in vitro. Furthermore, Ad-delE 1 B 55 and cisplatin showed combinatory effects in an orthotopic animal model.

40|$|In their {{extensive}} {{analysis of}} the effects of segmental aneuploidy on development to the adult stage, Lindsley and Sandler et al. (1972) identified salivary chromosome region 83 D-E as apparently uniquely dose-sensitive. Neither the hypoploid nor hyperploid classes appeared to survive to the adult stage, although segmental <b>hyperploidy</b> of all other regions of the genome is compatible with normal or quasi-normal development. In the present investigation, this genetic behavior is shown to be a concomitant of region 83 D-E itself, and independent of the particular Y-autosome translocations utilized to generate aneuploid classes. Newly induced chromosomal duplications including 83 D-E are recovered by their ability to complement the corresponding deficiency; these aberrations indicate that the phenomenon depends on genetic dosage per se and is independent of linkage relationships. Further tests involving the generation of large numbers of aneuploid zygotes support the conclusion that these individuals very rarely and possibly never survive to the adult stage. Finally, crosses yielding hypertriploid females and intersexes indicate that these aneuploids often survive and, in the former case, are fertile.

Air-dried smears were prepared from semen samples and treated with DTT and lithium diiodosalicylate to expand sperm chromatin. Hybridization with fluorescently tagged DNA probes for chromosomes 1 (pUC 177) or Y (pY 3. 4) yielded average frequencies of sperm with two fluorescent domains of 14. 2 +/- 2. 4 / 10, 000 and 5. 6 +/- 1. 6 / 10, 000 sperm, respectively.

Maize B–A–A translocations contain segments of two nonhomologous essential A chromosomes in tandem arrangement attached to {{a segment of the}} long arm of a supernumerary B chromosome. By utilizing the frequent nondisjunction of the B centromere at the second pollen mitosis we produced plants containing an extra copy of the two A chromosome segments.

A 20 -year-old man presented with bilateral tonsillar enlargement and lymphadenopathy in the cervical, axillary, and inguinal regions. Full blood count was: hemoglobin 88 g/L, white blood cell count 57 x 109 /L, platelets 69 x 109 /L. The bone marrow was hypercellu-lar with 93 % blasts, some with coarse granules but no Auer rods. Sudan Black was faintly positive in 3 % of the blasts.

Results RPR- 130401 inhibited cell growth with an IC 50 of 50 nM (HCT- 116), 120 nM (MiAPaCa- 2) and 710 nM (A- 549), with a poor incidence of apoptosis. The drug brought about G 1 and S phase depletion together with arrest of cells in G 2 phase and induced a significant accumulation of hyperploid cells showing active S phase DNA synthesis, with HCT- 116 and A- 549 cells {{being the most}} and least responsive, respectively. The drug also produced dramatic changes of the nuclear lamin B pattern, without lamin B cleavage and perturbation of the actin cytoskeleton. On the other hand, RPR- 130401 elicited strictly additive interaction in combined treatment with ionizing radiation with regard to cell kill, altered cell cycle progression and induced <b>hyperploidy.</b> Conclusions The data suggest that disruption of orderly progression through mitosis and cytokinesis, is a major outcome of drug action and that this effect proceeds from inhibition of lamin B farnesylation. It is anticipated from the strict additivity of RPR- 130401 and radiation that neither induced radiation resistance nor acute or late complications of radiotherapy, should occur in combined treatment with RPR- 130401. </p...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAn {{increase}} {{in the incidence of}} aneuploidy is well documented with increasing maternal age, in particular in human females. Remarkably, little is known regarding the underlying molecular basis for the age-associated {{increase in}} aneuploidy, which is a major source of decreased fertility in humans. Using mouse as a model system we find that eggs obtained from old mice (60 – 70  weeks of age) display a 6 -fold {{increase in the}} incidence of <b>hyperploidy</b> as assessed by chromosome spreads. Expression profiling of transcripts in oocytes and eggs obtained from young and old mice reveals that ∼ 5 % of the transcripts are differentially expressed in oocytes obtained from old females when compared to oocytes obtained from young females (6 – 12  weeks of age) and that this fraction increases to ∼ 33 % in eggs. The latter finding indicates that the normal pattern of degradation of maternal mRNAs that occurs during oocyte maturation is dramatically altered in eggs obtained from old mice and could therefore be a contributing source to the decline in fertility. Analysis of the differentially expressed transcripts also indicated that the strength of the spindle assembly checkpoint is weakened and that higher errors of microtubule–kinetochore interactions constitute part of molecular basis for the age-associated increase in aneuploidy in females. Last, BRCA 1 expression is reduced in oocytes obtained from old females and RNAi-mediated reduction of BRCA 1 in oocytes obtained from young females results in perturbing spindle formation and chromosome congression following maturation...|$|E
40|$|Fluorescence in situ {{hybridization}} (FISH) is {{a powerful}} new technique that allows numerical chromosome aberrations (aneuploidy) to be detected in interphase cells. In previous studies, FISH {{has been used to}} demonstrate that the benzene metabolites hydroquinone and 1, 2, 4 -benzenetriol induce aneuploidy of chromosomes 7 and 9 in cultures of human cells. In the present study, we used an interphase FISH procedure to perform cytogenetic analyses on the blood cells of 43 workers exposed to benzene (median = 31 ppm, 8 -hr time-weighted average) and 44 matched controls from Shanghai, China. High benzene exposure (> 31 ppm, n = 22) increased the hyperdiploid frequency of chromosome 9 (p < 0. 01), but lower exposure (< or = 31 ppm, n = 21) did not. Trisomy 9 was the major form of benzene-induced hyperdiploidy. The level of <b>hyperploidy</b> in exposed workers correlated with their urinary phenol level (r = 0. 58, p < 0. 0001), a measure of internal benzene dose. A significant correlation was also found between hyperdiploidy and decreased absolute lymphocyte count, an indicator of benzene hematotoxicity, in the exposed group (r = - 0. 44, p = 0. 003) but not in controls (r = - 0. 09, p = 0. 58). These results show that high benzene exposure induces aneuploidy of chromosome 9 in nondiseased individuals, with trisomy being the most prevalent form. They further highlight the usefulness of interphase cytogenetics and FISH for the rapid and sensitive detection of aneuploidy in exposed human populations...|$|E
40|$|Objective: {{to study}} the impact of {{chromium}} levels on cytogenetic impairments in T lymphocytes in miners from the south of Kuzbass. Subjects and methods. Peripheral blood leukocytes were cultured, as described by P. S. Moorhead (1960), by using the cytogenetic assay of the obtained specimens. Analysis of chromosomes considered changes {{in the number of}} chromosomes (hyper-, hypo-, or polyploid sets of chromosomes) and their structural derangement. Ninety-three miners from Novokuznetsk and Mezhdurechensk (Kemerovo Region) were examined. According to the length of underground service, the miners were divided into 2 groups: 1) 32 miners with a service length of 1 — 5 years; 2) 31 with a service length of 10 — 15 years. A control group included 30 employees from the mine maintenance departments. The mean age of the miners was 38. 6 ± 3. 4 years. Previous coal chemical analysis in a number of mines revealed significant concentrations of chromium compounds (as high as 298 mg/kg in the clarke of 83 mg/kg). Lymphocytic chromium was quantified by the atomic emission method using inductively bound plasma. The statistically data were processed using a package of Statistica 5. 01 computer programs. Results. Cytogenetic study and measurement of peripheral blood chromium were made in miners with a various underground service length. They were found to have elevated peripheral blood T lymphocytes with cytogenetic disorders, which correlated with the increased blood chromium levels. Conclusion. Thus, the miners with an underground service length of 10 — 15 years were ascertained to have high blood chromium levels, which was accompanied by increases in the count of both cells with chromosomal structural aberrations and those with poly- and <b>hyperploidy.</b>  </p...|$|E
40|$|Induction of {{ovulation}} with pregnant mare’s serum (PMS) and {{the timing}} of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) injection on chromosomal normality were examined in preimplantation hamster embryos. Two separate experimental trials were done. The first compared superovulation (SO, PMS on Day I of the cycle followed by hCG on Day 4) to natural ovulation. Natural mating was used. In the second series of trials, precocious super-ovulation (PSO, PMS on Day 1 followed by hCG on Day 3) was used. Since there is poor sperm transport in PSO females, direct uterine artificial insemination (Al) was used to achieve fertilization. The control animals in the second series of trials were naturally ovulating females subjected to the artificial insemination procedure. Of 785 embryos analyzed in the SO group, 9 (1. 1 %) were aneuploid (5 <b>hyperploidy</b> and 4 hypoploidy) and 8 (1. 0 %) showed triploidy. In the PSO group, artificial insemination resulted in a normal development rate of 85. 5 % up to the 2 -cell stage. A total of 2. 6 % karyotypically abnormal embryos, consisting of 5 (1. 1 %) aneuploid and 7 (1. 5 %) polyploid, were found among 460 embryos examined in PSO females. No {{significant difference in the}} incidence of chromosomal abnormalities was observed between the stages of development. The overall incidence of chromosomal imbalance in hormonally treated females was not significantly differ-ent from that in controls (2. 2 % in SO cycles vs. 1. 2 % in natural cycles, 2. 6 % in PSO with Al vs. 2. 4 % in natural cycles with Al). These results indicate that PMS-hCG treatment has no adverse effect on the chromosomal in-tegrity of hamster preimplantation embryos...|$|E
40|$|In many human cancers, the INK 4 A locus is {{frequently}} mutated by homozygous deletions. By alternative splicing this locus encodes two non-related tumor suppressor genes, p 16 (INK 4 A) and p 14 (ARF) (p 19 (ARF) in mice), which regulate cell cycle and cell {{survival in the}} retinoblastoma protein (pRb) and p 53 pathways, respectively. In mice, the role of p 16 (INK 4 A) as the critical tumor suppressor gene at the INK 4 A locus was challenged when {{it was found that}} p 19 (ARF) only knock-out mice developed tumors, including gliomas. We have analysed the genetic status of the INK 4 A locus in 105 primary gliomas using both microsatellite mapping (MSM) and quantitative real-time PCR (QRT-PCR). Comparison {{of the results of the}} two methods revealed agreement in 67 % of the tumors examined. In discordant cases, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis was always found to support QRT-PCR classification. Direct assessment of p 14 (ARF) exon 1 beta, p 16 (INK 4 A) exon 1 alpha and exon 2 by QRT-PCR revealed 43 (41 %) homozygous and eight (7 %) hemizygous deletions at the INK 4 A locus. In 49 (47 %) gliomas, both alleles were retained. In addition, QRT-PCR, but not MSM, detected <b>hyperploidy</b> in five (5 %) tumors. Deletion of p 14 (ARF) was always associated with co-deletion of p 16 (INK 4 A) and increased in frequency upon progression from low to high grade gliomas. Shorter survival was associated with homozygous deletions of INK 4 A in the subgroup of glioblastoma patients older than 50 years of age (P= 0. 025, Anova test single factor, alpha= 0. 05) ...|$|E
40|$|Malignant ectomesenchymoma (MEM) {{represents}} a heterogeneous group of tumors, most likely originating from pluripotent primitive neural crest cells. In this report, we present an 8 -month-old infant boy with an MEM {{on the left}} scrotum. Retrospective review of the incision biopsy showed {{the presence of a}} few ganglion cells in an otherwise classic embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), whereas in the resection specimen after chemotherapy the combined RMS and ganglioneuroma components were very obvious. Cytogenetic analysis of the residual lesion showed an abnormal karyotype, 49, XY, + 2, - 6, + 11, + 20, +mar, with a <b>hyperploidy</b> in a subset of cells. By fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis, the marker chromosome was identified as originating from chromosome 6, and the tumor cells were negative for PAX 3 /PAX 7 disrupting translocations specific for alveolar RMS. Gains of chromosomes 2, 11, and 20, found in the current case, are a common finding in embryonal RMS. These gains probably reflect the myogenic differentiation of MEM and support the genetic link between these 2 neoplasms. In addition to the conventional cytogenetics, array comparative genomic hybridization analysis was performed on the primary and residual tumors. The genomic profiles of both specimens were basically the same including the presence of 2 distinctive chromosome 6 p 21. 32 -p 21. 2 and 6 p 11. 2 amplification regions in the primary tumor, which vanished in the postchemotherapy specimen. The pretreatment biopsy exhibited strong expression of HMGA 1 and HMGA 2 proteins in immunohistochemistry, with the shift toward the loss of expression of both genes in the posttreatment tumoral tissue. This finding supports the oncogenic properties of the HMGA family of proteins and their role in the process of malignant transformation. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Non-cytotoxic {{concentrations}} (1. 5, 3 and 6 pM) {{of sodium}} arsenite (SA) {{were used to}} study its cytogenetic effects with special reference to the frequency and nature of chromosomal aberrations on the X chromosome at Xq 21 and at centromeric regions in CHO 9, EM-C 11, V 79, V-H 4 and CHE cell lines using Giemsa and FISH techniques. A high frequency of chromosomal breakpoints was distrib-uted on the X chromosome localized at the secondary constriction region of the q arm (Xq 21) {{and to a lesser}} degree at the centromeric region (c band-positive region), showing a high degree of fragility of these regions. This phenomenon was observed in all cell lines except for V 79, where aberrations were localized only in the Xq 21 region, and CHO 9, where the observed breakage frequency was lowest in comparison with other cell lines and breaks were mostly located in the centromeric region rather than at Xq 21. Homozygous expression of the breakpoint at Xq 21 (fragile site) and in the centromeric region was also con-firmed using a female Chinese hamster embryonic (CHE) cell line, which showed a similar high frequency of breakpoints at Xq 21 and in the centromeric region of both X chromosomes. Further, a detailed cytogenetic study in CHO 9 and its ligase-deficient mutant EM-C 11 cell line showed slightly higher sensitivity to SA in a cell survival assay. No difference was found for chromosomal aberra-tions in Giemsa stained preparations. For SCEs a higher spontaneous frequency was evident in EMC- 11. SA signi-ficantly increased the frequency of SCEs in CHO 9, but no effect was found in EM-C 11. Further, we observed an increased number of abnormal cells with pulverised chro-mosomes, decondensed chromatin, isochromosomes and <b>hyperploidy</b> in CHO 9 and EM-C 11 cell lines at all doses of SA...|$|E
40|$|By {{combining}} {{elements of}} two Y-autosome translocations with displaced autosomal breakpoints, {{it is possible}} to produce zygotes heterozygous for a deficiency for the region between the breakpoints, and also, as a complementary product, zygotes carrying a duplication for precisely the same region. A set of Y-autosome translocations with appropriately positioned breakpoints, therefore, can in principle be used to generate a non-overlapping set of deficiencies and duplications for the entire autosomal complement. —Using this method, we have succeeded in examining segmental aneuploids for 85 % of chromosomes 2 and 3 in order to assess the effects of aneuploidy and to determine the number and location of dosage-sensitive loci in the Drosophila genome (Figure 5). Combining our data with previously reported results on the synthesis of Drosophila aneuploids (see Lindsley and Grell 1968), the following generalities emerge. — 1. The X chromosome contains no triplo-lethal loci, few or no haplo-lethal loci, at least seven Minute loci, one hyperploid-sensitive locus, and one locus that is both triplo-abnormal and haplo-abnormal. 2. Chromosome 2 contains no triplo-lethal loci, few or no haplo-lethal loci, at least 17 Minute loci, and at least four other haplo-abnormal loci. 3. Chromosome 3 contains one triplo-lethal locus that is also haplo-lethal, few or no other haplo-lethal loci, at least 16 Minute loci, and at least six other haplo-abnormal loci. 4. Chromosome 4 contains no triplo-lethal loci, no haplo-lethal loci, one Minute locus, and no other haplo-abnormal loci. —Thus, the Drosophila genome contains 57 loci, aneuploidy for which leads to a recognizable effect on the organism: one of these is triplo-lethal and haplo-lethal, one is triplo-abnormal and haplo-abnormal, one is hyperploid-sensitive, ten are haplo-abnormal, 41 are Minutes, and three are either haplo-lethals or Minutes. Because of the paucity of aneuploid-lethal loci, it may be concluded that the deleterious effects of aneuploidy are mostly the consequence of the additive effects of genes that are slightly sensitive to abnormal dosage. Moreover, except for the single triplo-lethal locus, the effects of <b>hyperploidy</b> are much less pronounced than those of the corresponding hypoploidy...|$|E
40|$|Although aneuploidy, {{variations}} in chromosome number from haploid genome multiples, is {{a feature of}} several nervous system diseases, aneuploid cells {{have been found in}} the non-diseased developing and adult brain. This genetic mosaicism may contribute to the phenotypic and functional diversity in the central nervous system. This dissertation aims to characterize aneuploidy in embryonic cortical neural progenitor cells (NPCs) over a time frame that coincides with neurogenesis, and to identify functional consequences of this phenomenon. As neurogenesis proceeds, neurons are produced from two genetically distinct progenitor populations. In the studies described in Chapter 2, we tested the hypothesis that these molecular differences will be reflected in changes in the rate of aneuploidy in the developing cortex. Metaphase spread analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization determined that aneuploid NPCs were present throughout neurogenesis, with peak levels found in dividing cells during the middle stage of neurogenesis. Our results revealed that lagging chromosomes, a mitotic defect that leads to aneuploidy, are evident in various stages of embryonic cortical development. The finding that aneuploidy increases during stages of cortical development when the most functionally and phenotypically varied cortical projection neurons are produced suggests that there is positive selection for cells with favorable aberrant karyotypes as a means of generating a great amount of diversity in a limited time. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) represents inactivation of a wild-type allele that renders the cell homozygous or hemizygous for a deleterious allele. Given that <b>hyperploidy</b> is {{the most common form of}} aneuploidy observed in NPCs, it is likely that LOH via chromosome loss may lead to changes in the developing brain. The analyses outlined in Chapter 3 determined whether mosaic aneuploidy, through LOH, influences leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) -mediated astrocyte differentiation of NPCs. Using flow cytometry, we have shown that loss of chromosome 15, on which the LIFR allele resides, reduced the ability of cortical NPCs to generate astrocytes in response to ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF). In summary, this work demonstrates that aneuploidy is a normal feature of NPCs across cortical neurogenesis, and one potential outcome of this variation is a change in the balance of neural and glial cell fate...|$|E
40|$|We have {{explored}} {{the hypothesis that}} hypertrophy of vascular smooth muscle cells may be regulated, in part, by growth inhibitory factors that alter {{the pattern of the}} growth response to serum mitogens by characterizing the effects of the potent growth inhibitor, transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), on both hyperplastic and hypertrophic growth of cultured rat aortic smooth muscle cells. TGF-beta inhibited serum-induced proliferation of rat aortic smooth muscle cells (ED 50 = 2 pM); this is consistent with previously reported observations in bovine aortic smooth muscle cells (Assoian et al. 1982. J. Biol. Chem. 258 : 7155 - 7160). Growth inhibition was due in part to a greater than twofold increase in the cell cycle transit time in cells that continued to proliferate in the presence of TGF-beta. TGF-beta concurrently induced cellular hypertrophy as assessed by flow cytometric analysis of cellular protein content (47 % increase) and forward angle light scatter (32 - 50 % increase), an index of cell size. In addition to being time and concentration dependent, this hypertrophy was reversible. Simultaneous flow cytometric evaluation of forward angle light scatter and cellular DNA content demonstrated that TGF-beta-induced hypertrophy was not dependent on withdrawal of cells from the cell cycle nor was it dependent on growth arrest of cells at a particular point in the cell cycle in that both cycling cells in the G 2 phase of the cell cycle and those in G 1 were hypertrophied with respect to the corresponding cells in vehicle-treated controls. Chronic treatment with TGF-beta (100 pM, 9 d) was associated with accumulation of cells in the G 2 phase of the cell cycle in the virtual absence of cells in S phase, whereas subsequent removal of TGF-beta from these cultures was associated with the appearance of a significant fraction of cycling cells with greater than 4 c DNA content, consistent with development of tetraploidy. Results of these studies support a role for TGF-beta in the control of smooth muscle cell growth and suggest that at least one mechanism whereby hypertrophy and <b>hyperploidy</b> may occur in this, as well as other cell types, is by alterations in the response to serum mitogens by potent growth inhibitors such as TGF-beta...|$|E
