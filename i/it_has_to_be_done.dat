25|$|Countries where {{fixed rate}} loans are the {{common form of}} loan for a house {{purchase}} usually {{need to have a}} specific legal framework in place to make this possible. For example, in Germany and Austria the popular Bausparkassen, a type of mutual building societies, offer long-term fixed rate loans. They are legally separate from banks and require borrowers to save up a considerable amount, at a rather low fixed interest rate, before they get their loan; this is done by requiring the future borrower to begin paying in his fixed monthly payments well before actually getting the loan. It is generally not possible to pay this in as a lump sum and get the loan right away; <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> in monthly installments of the same size as what will be paid during the payback phase of the mortgage. Depending on whether there are enough savers in the system at any given time, payout of a loan may be delayed for some time even when the savings quota has already been met by the would-be borrower. The advantage for the borrower is that the monthly payment is guaranteed never to be increased, and the lifetime of the loan is also fixed in advance. The disadvantage is that this model, in which you have to start making payments several years before actually getting the loan, is mostly aimed at once-in-a-lifetime home buyers who are able to plan ahead for a long time. That has become a problem with the generally higher mobility that is demanded of workers nowadays.|$|E

Del Toro took a new approach to directing actors, allowing [...] "looser" [...] movements and improvisation; the director maintained tight control over the production: [...] "Everything, 100% goes through me sooner or later.

Scorsese first read the novel in 1989 and obtained the movie rights soon afterwards. When asked why he retained interest in the project for over 26 years, Scorsese stated: [...] "As you get older, ideas go and come. Questions, answers, loss of the answer again and more questions, and this is what really interests me. Yes, the cinema and the people in my life and my family are most important, but ultimately as you get older, there's got to be more... Silence is just something that I'm drawn to in that way. It's been an obsession, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done...</b> it's a strong, wonderful true story, a thriller in a way, but it deals with those questions." ...|$|E

500|$|Despite Ice-T's {{attempts}} to differentiate Body Count {{from his work}} in the hip hop genre, the press focused on the group's rap image. Ice-T felt that politicians had intentionally referred to the song [...] "Cop Killer" [...] as rap to provoke negative criticism. [...] "There is absolutely no way to listen to the song 'Cop Killer' and call it a rap record. It's so far from rap. But, politically, they know by saying the word rap they can get {{a lot of people who}} think, 'Rap-black-rap-black-ghetto,' and don't like it. You say the word rock, people say, 'Oh, but I like Jefferson Airplane, I like Fleetwood Mac — that's rock.' They don't want to use the word rock & roll to describe this song." [...] Body Count has since been credited for pioneering the rap metal genre popularized by groups such as Rage Against the Machine and Limp Bizkit, although Ice-T does not rap on any of the album's tracks. Ernie C stated that [...] "A lot of rappers want to be in a rock band, but <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> sincerely. You can't just get anybody on guitar and expect it to work.

[...] Blum said the law was intended for use in cases with no clear jurisdiction, such as piracy in international waters, and should not be expanded for political aims. Israeli officials, acting under orders from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, told the British ambassador they expect quick action to change the law. Livni called the arrest warrant [...] "an abuse of the British legal system". At a security conference in Israel, Livni did not directly address the arrest warrant but defended Israel's conduct during Operation Cast Lead, saying she [...] "would make the same decisions all over again".

2500|$|In Shadowrun, {{corporations}} are effectively [...] "ranked" [...] {{by the amount}} of assets under their control, including material, personnel, and property, as well as profit. These ranks are A, AA, and AAA; AAA {{corporations are}} top tier. Most corporations in the AA and AAA level are immune to domestic law, responsible only to themselves, and regulated only by the Corporate Court, an assembly of the ten AAA-rated corporations. All AAA-rated and most AA-rated corporations exhibit a privilege known as [...] "extraterritoriality", meaning that any land owned by the corp is sovereign territory only to the corp and immune to any laws of the country within. Corporate territory is not foreign soil but corporate soil, just like its employees are corporate citizens, though dual citizenship in a corporation and a nation is common. The AAA corps, as well as numerous minor corporations, fight each other not only in the boardroom or during high-level business negotiations but also with physical destruction, clandestine operations, hostile extraction or elimination of vital personnel, and other means of sabotage. Because no corporation wants to be held liable for damages, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> by deniable assets, or shadowrunners, invisible to the system where every citizen is tagged with a System Identification Number (SIN).|$|E
