40|$|The {{investigation}} of the bonding pressure change on the different quality aspects of the solid-liquid interdiffusion (SLID) interconnects is presented. The stacks were produced by a flux-assisted bonding of two Si dies with an area array of square Cu/SnAg bumps on the bottom die and Cu bumps on the top die at approx. 250 °C. The bonding pressure was varied between 0 MPa, 0. 35 MPa, 0. 69 MPa, 1. 04 MPa, 1. 38 MPa, 1. 73 MPa, 2. 08 MPa, 2. 42 MPa. Cross-sections of the stacks were analyzed by optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Tilt, standoff height (SOH) variation, void fraction, interlayer thickness and Cu 3 Sn thickness were measured. It will be shown that increase of the bonding pressure can reduce the void fraction from 35. 1 % (0 MPa) to 10. 7 % (2. 42 MPa) and decrease the interlayer thickness at the same time. Decrease of the interlayer thickness is accompanied by solder squeeze and increase of Cu 3 Sn thickness. Shear tests revealed an average shear str <b>ength</b> <b>of</b> (81. 3 ± 21. 5) MPa for the produced samples.

40|$|Highly {{selective}} tching of Si 3 N 4 over SiO 2 {{has been}} investigated employing F and C 1 atoms generated by the micro-wave discharge of an NFa. + C 12 mixture. F atoms alone react spontaneously with both Si 3 N 4 and SiO 2, leading to insuffi-cient Si 3 N 4 /SiO 2 selectivity. By adding C 12 to NF~, most of the F atoms are rapidly converted to interhalogen FC 1 by a ti-tration reaction with C 12 in the gas phase. The resultant FC 1 molecules etch SigN 4 as well as St, but do not react with SiO 2 without any radiation assistance. As a result, infinite Si 3 N~/SiOa selectivity has been achieved. The faster etching for SigN 4 is attr ibuted to a lower ionicity in the chemical bond state for SiaN ~ than that for SiO 2. Si l icon nitride (Si 3 N 4) film is widely used as a mask ma-terial for the local oxidation of silicon, LOCOS (1), in VLSI manufacturing. Continual shrinkage of VLSI devices has led to decrease in device isolation width using LOCOS, which requires thinner pad SiO 2 to minimize the bird's beak length, which is the lateral <b>ength</b> <b>of</b> the SiO 2 region beneath Si 3 N 4 after oxidation.

40|$|The {{problem of}} the order of the {{fluctuation}} of the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) of two independent sequences has been open for decades. There exist contradicting conjectures on the topic, [1] and [2]. Lember and Matzinger [3] showed that with i. i. d. binary strings, the standard deviation of the length of the LCS is asymptotically linear in the length of the strings, provided that 0 and 1 have very different probabilities. Nonetheless, with two i. i. d. sequences and a finite number of equiprobable symbols, the typical size of the fluctuation of the LCS remains unknown. In the present article, we determine the order of the fluctuation of the LCS for a special model of i. i. d. sequences made out of blocks. A block is a contiguous substring consisting only of one type of symbol. Our model allows only three possible block lengths, each been equiprobable picked up. For i. i. d. sequences with equiprobable symbols, the blocks are independent of each other. In order to study the fluctuation of the LCS in this model, we developed a method which reformulates the fluctuation problem as a (relatively) low dimensional optimization problem. We finally proved that for our model, the fluctuation <b>of</b> the <b>ength</b> <b>of</b> the LCS coincides with the Waterman’s conjecture [2]. We belive that our method can be applied to any other case dealing with i. i. d. sequences, only that the optimization problem might be more complicated to formulate and to solve...|$|R

Cluster membership, physical parameters and evolutionary status of the star are reinvestigated. Radial velocity data do not support the cluster membership to Stock 14 }. Ultraviolet and optical spectrophotometry is combined with optical and infrared photometry to evaluate the physical parameters of the yellow supergiant (Teff = 5970 K, M_bol = - 8. 5, R = 420 R_sun) and of its B 0 III companion. From theoretical stellar evolutionary tracks, an initial mass of 25 M_sun is estimated for V 810 Cen, which is actually {{at the end of its}} first redward evolution. V 810 Cen is a multi-periodic small amplitude variable star, whose amplitudes are variable with time. The period of the main mode, 156 d, is in agreement with the Period [...] Luminosity [...] Colour relation for supergiants. This mode is most probably the fundamental radial one. According to the theoretical pulsation periods for the radial modes, calculated from a linear non-adiabatic analysis, the period of the observed second mode, 107 d, is much too long to correspond to the first radial overtone. Thus, this second mode could be a non-radial p-mode. Other transient periods are observed, in particular at 187 d. The l <b>ength</b> <b>of</b> this period suggests a non-radial g-mode.

40|$|The work {{described}} in the thesis is concerned with making new polymeric materials via ring opening metathesis polymerisation (ROMP) using a well-defined ruthenium carbene as an initiator. The object {{of the study was}} to provide a process for producing shaped articles by introducing a reactive liquid mixture into a mould in which the reacting liquid mixture undergoes ROMP in the bulk to produce the moulded article. Mono- and difunctional imidonorbomene derivatives were used as monomer and crosslinker respectively. The properties of the cured samples were determined by sol-gel analysis, DSC, TGA, nmr and IR spectrometry. Gel fraction, Tg and content of unreacted monomer were used to characterise the cured samples. The results indicated a strong dependence of the polymers appearance and properties on the polymerization formulation and protocol, i. e. the monomer, the crosslinker and the polymerization conditions. The relative reactivity of the exo- and endo-monomers was investigated using the 'Hnmr technique since the initiation and propagation steps of the polymerisations can be followed in detail by this technique. The results showed that the polymerisations are living and the exo-isomer is more reactive than endo-isomer. A wider range of polymers can be prepared from solution polymerisation as compared to bulk polymerisation. The polymers derived from solid monomers, the monofunctional monomer with short N-alkyl pendant groups and all the difunctional monomers, could be prepared more easily in solution than in bulk polymerisation. The endo-monomer and the monofunctional monomer with long N-alkyl pendant group showed very low reactivity and were not suitable for ROMP in bulk but underwent solution polymerisation. It was found that the thermal properties of the linear polymers depend upon the amount of each monomer isomer incorporated into the polymer chain and the <b>ength</b> <b>of</b> the N-alkyl pendant groups. All linear polymers are soluble in chlorinated solvents from which clear films can be cast.
