50|$|In 1986, the Si trim was {{extended}} to the Civic hatchback, offering the same powertrain of the CRX Si but with four-seats. Added improvements for the Civic Si hatchback included a removable glass sunroof, a five-speed manual gearbox, tilt steering wheel, a full-width taillight panel, a color-keyed front airdam, sedan-style <b>disk</b> <b>wheel</b> covers, and a roof spoiler. Like the CRX Si, the Si hatchback was powered by a , 12-valve SOHC engine designated EW4/D15A3 (the latter code {{was used for the}} 1987 model year but with the same specs). The Civic Si also saw a release in New Zealand and Australia in 1987, sharing specifications {{similar to those of the}} American-market Si.|$|E
50|$|Wheelchair rugby is {{a contact}} sport, meaning that {{significant}} pressure is placed upon the players’ wheelchairs. Therefore {{they must be}} lightweight and easy enough to manoeuvre, while still being strong enough to withstand high impact forces and protect players. The wheelchairs have several special features including bumpers at the front and wings to protect the side area. There are both attack and defence wheelchairs, the differences being that attack chairs have bumpers where the players’ feet are to make them difficult to stop and hold, while defence wheelchairs have a pick bar instead, which are designed for striking and holding the opposition. Metal <b>disk</b> <b>wheel</b> armour acts as spoke protectors and anti-tip devices are mandatory. All wheelchairs must meet IWRF regulations.|$|E

40|$|It is {{well-known}} that automobile transport {{as well as}} industry are the main sources of air pollution. In addition to exhaust gases, the flow of traffic releases a cloud of dust, consisting of over 60 % of micro- and ultramicroscopic particles with radius of 10. 0 – 0. 25 µm, which are formed due to wheel abrasion (caused by the road grip of a tyre) {{and the use of}} the brake blocks (in braking).

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} a temporal study using dynamic finite element {{methods of the}} dynamic response of a 2 D mechanical model composed of a deformable rotating <b>disk</b> (<b>wheel)</b> in contact with a deformable translating body (rail) with constant Coulomb friction. Under global sliding conditions, oscillatory states at specific frequencies occur in the contact patch even {{in the case of}} a constant friction coefficient. A parallel is drawn between the frequencies of these states and the modal analysis of the entire mechanical model. The influence on local contact conditions of parameters such as normal load, global sliding ratio, friction coefficient, and the transient value for applying sliding conditions is then evaluated. Finally, the consequences of these states on local rail plastic deformation are presented and correlated with rail corrugation occurring on straight tracks under acceleration and deceleration conditions...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the work undertaken to assess potential improvements in high performance bicycles. There are several wheel options available for elite riders {{to use in}} competition and this research has investigated the aerodynamic properties of different wheel type. The research has also developed CFD and FEA models of carbon fibre bicycle wheels {{to assist in the}} wheel improvements process. An accurate and repeatable experimental test rig was developed to measure the aerodynamic properties of bicycle wheels in the wind tunnel, namely translational drag, rotational drag and side force. Both disk wheels and spoked wheels were tested. It was found that disk wheels of different hub widths have different aerodynamic properties with the 53 mm wide Zen <b>disk</b> <b>wheel</b> requiring the lowest total power of the wheels tested. There was little difference between the translational power requirements of the wheels but there was greater variation in the rotational power requirements. Compression spoked wheels of 3 and 5 spokes were found to require less power than wire spoked wheels. There was little difference between the total power requirements of the compression spoked wheels tested, with the differences at 50 km/hr being less than the experimental uncertainty. The Zipp 808 wheel demonstrated considerably lower axial force than all other wheels at 10 ° yaw angle, confirming Zipp design intention to have optimum wheel performance between 0 - 20 °. The Zen 3 -spoke wheel showed the lowest axial drag and side force at yaw of the compression spoked wheels tested and had similar side force results to the Zipp 808. CFD models of the disk and 3 -spoke wheel achieved good agreement with the experimental results in terms of translational drag. Rotational drag did not agree so well, most likely due to the turbulence model being designed for higher Reynolds number flows. A FE model of the <b>disk</b> <b>wheel</b> was validated with experimental testing. In order to simplify modelling, the FE model of the 3 -spoke wheel did not include the hub, which led to a large discrepancy with experimental results for the particular loading scenario. The experimental rig and CFD models were used to develop aerodynamic improvements to the wheel and the FE models were used to identify the implication of geometric changes to the wheel structural integrity. These improvements are not reported in this thesis due to the results being commercially sensitive...|$|E
40|$|In recent times, {{there has}} been {{considerable}} interest in creating and deploying modular cooperating collectives of robots. Interest in such cooperative systems typically arises when certain tasks are either too complex to be performed by a single robot or when there are distinct benefits that accrue by cooperation of many simple robotic modules. In this dissertation, we examine these aspects {{in the context of}} cooperative payload manipulation and transport by wheeled mobile module collectives with tightlycoupled dynamics arising from the physical interactions between various modules. Our basic module is a wheeled mobile manipulator (WMM) formed by mounting a multi-link manipulator on top of a <b>disk</b> <b>wheeled</b> mobile base. By merging mobility with manipulation, mobile manipulators derive significant novel capabilities for enhanced interactions with the world. However, a careful resolution of the redundancy and active control of the reconfigurability created by the surplus articulated degrees-of-freedom and actuation is key to unlocking this potential. Addition of nonholonomic constraints creates additional challenges when <b>disk</b> <b>wheeled</b> mobile base is used and needs to be carefully addressed...|$|R

40|$|Electrical drives lie at {{the heart}} of most {{industrial}} processes and make a major contribution to the comfort and high quality products we all take for granted. Electrical drives involving different types of electrical motors turn the wheels of industry. In an industrialized country, more than 60 % of the generated electrical energy is used in motor drives. The application of electrical drives spread from low fractional horse power applications in instruments to the industrial applications. Wide power, torque and speed ranges, adaptability to almost every operating condition, high efficiency, fast response, control simplicity, ability to operate as a generator in braking mode and various mechanical design types make the electrical drive very competitive among the other drive types. This work is based on the Robust Control Adjustable Electrical DC Drive System using PI (Proportional Integrator) controller. It encompasses the development of the DC drive. It also includes the design and fabrication of the mechanical load wheel structure. Thus the work finally gave a product in the form of a test jig for checking the wear and tear of a small metallic material after being spring pressed and scrubbed on the edged copper face of the aluminum <b>disk</b> <b>wheel.</b> The integrity of the system is based on keeping the wheel speed constant. In nullifying the steady state error the PI control algorithm was eventually used with root locus design method that could enable finding the PI coefficients.

40|$|Our {{long-term}} goal {{is one of}} designing land-based vehicles to provide enhanced uneventerrain locomotion capabilities. In this paper, we examine and evaluate candidate articulated leg-wheel subsystem designs for use in such vehicle systems. The leg-wheel subsystem designs under consideration consist of <b>disk</b> <b>wheels</b> attached to the chassis through an articulated linkage containing multiple lower-pair joints. Our emphasis is on creating a design that permits the greatest motion flexibility between the chassis and wheel while maintaining the smallest degree-of-freedom (DOF) within the articulated chain. We focus our attention on achieving two goals: (i) obtaining adequate ground clearance by designing the desired/feasible motions of the wheel axle, relative to the chassis, using methods from kinematic synthesis; and (ii) reducing overall actuation requirements by a judicious mix of structural equilibration design and spring assist. This process is examined in detail {{in the context of}} two candidate single-degree-of-freedom designs for the articulated-leg-wheel subsystems—a coupled-serial-chain configuration and a four-bar configuration.
