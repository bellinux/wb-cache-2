500|$|Although Bill Veeck took much of {{the public}} {{criticism}} for the fiasco, his son Mike suffered repercussions as the actual front-office promoter behind it. [...] Mike Veeck remained with the White Sox until late 1980, when he resigned; his father sold the team to Jerry Reinsdorf soon afterward. [...] He was unable to find a job in baseball for some time after that, leading him to claim that he had been blackballed from the game. For several years, he worked for a jai-alai fronton in Florida, battling alcoholism. As Mike Veeck related, [...] "The second that first guy shimmied down the outfield wall, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>my</b> life was over!" [...] Mike Veeck has since become an owner of minor league baseball teams. In July 2014 the Charleston RiverDogs, of whom Veeck is president, held a promotion involving the destruction of Justin Bieber and Miley Cyrus merchandise. Dahl is still a radio personality in Chicago and also reaches his listeners through podcasting.|$|E
500|$|Rowe's {{illness and}} Blanchflower's arrival {{together}} signalled {{the end of}} Ramsey's playing career. Ramsey missed matches during the 1954–55 season through injury, and in April 1955 suffered what he called [...] "a terrible roasting" [...] {{at the hands of}} the Leicester City winger Derek Hogg. After Tottenham ended the season in 16th place, Rowe retired permanently; his deputy Jimmy Anderson took over and appointed Nicholson to his coaching staff. When Ramsey was omitted from a post-season tour of Hungary, despite still being club captain, he realised that his time at Tottenham had come to an end. He had played a total of 250 competitive games for Tottenham in all competitions, across six seasons. [...] "I was 35 years old and obviously concerned about my future," [...] he later wrote. [...] "I really didn't know what was going to happen to me. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>my</b> days as a player were numbered, and there was only one way things could go for me in this respect—downhill." ...|$|E
500|$|IGN {{claimed that}} [...] "Monolith forges new shooter {{territory}} with some truly freaky elements, challenge, fun, and beauty." [...] GameSpy praised the game's plot, later awarding it their [...] "Best Story" [...] Game of the Year award. The New York Times thought differently, stating [...] "I was never quite clear {{on what was}} going on in the game. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>my</b> goal—track down a psychic, escort a corporate executive's daughter out of danger—but I didn't ever care who these people were nor did I understand their motives." [...] The game has also received criticism for its system requirements, which called for an extremely powerful PC for its time. The Xbox 360 port has also received positive reviews, almost as favorable as the PC version. The multiplayer and instant-action mode were praised for better gameplay, but the control scheme was negatively viewed. Reviews have also stated that it lacked bonus features, despite the new mission included in the game. GameSpot gave the game 8.6. while IGN rated it 9.1 ...|$|E

500|$|... "Stay Together for the Kids" [...] {{is written}} about divorce {{from the point}} of view of a {{helpless}} child. Its heavier sound was inspired by bands the group's members were listening to in the two weeks they wrote their fourth album, Take Off Your Pants and Jacket, such as Fugazi and Refused. Primarily written by guitarist Tom DeLonge, the song is biographical in nature. He and bassist Mark Hoppus were growing up when their parents divorced. For Hoppus, he was eight years old when he was sent to live with his father. [...] "The thing you realize as you get older is that parents don’t know what the hell they’re doing and neither will you when you get to be a parent. You’ve just got to understand that people are human and they make mistakes," [...] he said. DeLonge remembered learning of his parents' divorce when he discovered scrape marks on the driveway of their home. [...] "Right then, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>my</b> dad had dragged out his furniture single-handedly," [...] he recalled. He spoke on the song's inspiration in 2001: ...|$|E

There {{was no way}} that guy wasn't going to be great." [...] At one point, Butkus gained a {{reputation}} as one of the best players on an otherwise bad Bears team in the late 1960s; during his tenure, the Bears won 48 games, lost 74, and tied 4.|$|E

In his first {{news conference in}} office, he made an unprecedented statement acknowledging that Japan waged a war of aggression in World War II. He later said: [...] "You can obviously define 'aggression' {{in any number of}} ways, depending on context. But if you have any common sense, you just cannot say in good conscience that Japan was not the aggressor when Japan did in fact cause tremendous anguish and loss of life in China, Korea and Southeast Asian nations in order to protect its own interests. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>my</b> opinion was going to invite heated controversy." ...|$|E

2500|$|Gwynn was {{friendly}} and accessible {{to both the}} media and fans. Even on the occasions that he began an interview tight-lipped, he almost inevitably opened up and offered abundant material. He spoke with a twang in his high-pitched voice, often filled with loud, infectious, childlike laughter. Gwynn possessed a cheerful personality, being friendly towards others while being critical of himself. He considered himself [...] "a good player ... but <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>my</b> place. I was not a game-changer. I was not a dominant player". His demeanor was even-keeled; Rettenmund said, [...] "You couldn't tell if [...] gone 3-for-3 or 0-for-3." [...] After {{the death of his}} father in 1993, Gwynn followed his father's advice and became more outspoken and more of a team leader.|$|E
2500|$|Beck {{acknowledged}} {{the impact of}} folk on the song, saying [...] "I'd realized {{that a lot of}} what folk music is about taking a tradition and reflecting your own time. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>my</b> folk music would take off, if I put hip-hop beats behind it." [...] He had also perceived similarities between Delta blues and hip hop, which helped to inspire the song. The A.V. Club's Annie Zaleski opines that the song imitates abstract hip hop, while James Reed from The Boston Globe called it an alternative rock anthem, and Veronica Chambers for Vibe magazine described the song as a [...] "folk-based hip hop song." [...] "Loser" [...] revolves around several recurring musical elements: a slide guitar riff, Stephenson's sitar, the bassline, and a tremolo guitar part. The song's drum track is sampled from a Johnny Jenkins cover of Dr. John's [...] "I Walk on Gilded Splinters" [...] from the 1970 album Ton-Ton Macoute!. During the song's break, there is a sample of a line of dialogue from the 1994 Steve Hanft-directed film Kill the Moonlight, which goes [...] "I’m a driver/I’m a winner/Things are gonna change, I can feel it". Hanft and Beck were friends, and Hanft would go on to direct several music videos for Beck, including the video for [...] "Loser".|$|E
