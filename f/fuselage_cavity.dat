2500|$|The Carbon Dragon is {{predominantly}} a conventional wood and doped aircraft fabric glider, making judicious use of carbon fiber in the wing spar caps, control rods, flaperons and the elliptical tail boom to save weight. The control tubes are constructed by laying up the carbon fiber on aluminium tubing and then, when the carbon has cured, dissolving the aluminium with swimming pool acid. The cockpit is totally enclosed {{and the original}} design called for a cockpit width of [...] at the hips and [...] at the shoulder, although some have been modified to accommodate pilots of larger dimensions. The main aircraft structure consists of dual triangular torque boxes {{on each side of}} the fuselage. The wing employs a Culver SD airfoil that was designed by Irv Culver for the project and full-span flaperons of 30% chord. The flaperons can deploy from −5° to +15° as flaps and −4° to +16° as ailerons, with a 4:1 differential. The flaperons are driven by two, vertically mounted pushrods enclosed within the fuselage and connected to the side stick. The wing ribs forward of the spar are fabricated from [...] 5-ply mahogany and aft of the spar from [...] square spruce. The landing gear is a fixed monowheel, mounted on the hinged cockpit bottom door, that opens to allow the pilot to lift the aircraft for foot-launching. The aircraft was designed so that if the pilot falls while foot-launching his body will be in the rear <b>fuselage</b> <b>cavity</b> and not pinned under the aircraft. The ultimate structural load limit is +/-7.5 g, with a +/-5.0 g operational load limit.|$|E
50|$|On August 12, 1985, Japan Air Lines Flight 123, a Boeing 747-SR100, {{experienced}} {{cabin decompression}} 12 minutes after takeoff from Haneda Airport in Tokyo, Japan, at 24,000 feet. The decompression {{was caused by}} failure of a previously repaired aft pressure bulkhead. Cabin air rushed into the unpressurized <b>fuselage</b> <b>cavity,</b> overpressurizing the area and causing failure of the auxiliary power unit (APU) firewall and the supporting structure for the vertical fin. The vertical fin separated from the airplane. Hydraulic components located in the aft body were also severed, leading to a rapid depletion of all four hydraulic systems. The loss of the vertical fin, coupled {{with the loss of}} all four hydraulic systems, left the airplane extremely difficult, if not impossible, to control in all three axes. Lack of independence of four hydraulic systems from a single failure event was a zonal hazard. The aircraft struck a mountain at forty-six minutes after takeoff with 520 fatalities and 4 survivors.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{methods of}} {{high frequency noise}} and vibrations computation of cabin part of EV– 55 M (aircraft developed by Evektor Kunovice). There is a brief summary of methods used for determining high frequency noise and vibrations {{in the first part}} of the thesis. Detailed explanation is given for Statistical Energy Analysis (SEA) which is nowadays the most dominant method in this area. The energy balance equation is derived in this chapter and SEA parameters such as modal density, damping loss factor, coupling loss factor and power input are introduced here. Next part deals with main noise sources of propeller driven and jet aircraft and passive and active noise controls are discussed. Practical part of this thesis deals with modeling aircraft EV– 55 M fuselage using VA One SEA module. Two models were created. First of them is only an outside fuselage with aircraft flooring and the second one is extended by interior trim panels and is applicable for simulation of noise control treatments. Computational modeling is accompanied by experimental measurement of passive noise control material characteristics. Postprocessing of information obtained from impedance tube measurement was performed in FOAM – X. Determined characteristics of porous material were used as inputs to VA One and reduction of sound pressure level in <b>fuselage</b> <b>cavities</b> by using noise control treatment was found. In conclusion there is a summary of noise transmission paths from sources to interior cavity and some treatments of them are simulate...|$|R
40|$|The {{negative}} impact of aircraft noise includes effects on population's health, land use planning and economic issues such as building restrictions and operating restrictions for airports. Thus, the reduction of noise generated by aircraft at take-off and approach is an essential consideration {{in the development of}} new commercial aircraft. Among the different aircraft noise sources, landing gear noise {{is one of the most}} significant during approach. This research presents results from the European Clean Sky funded ALLEGRA project, which investigated a full-scale Nose Landing Gear (NLG) model featuring the belly <b>fuselage,</b> bay <b>cavity</b> and hydraulic dressing. Tests were performed for a variety of wind speeds and yaw angles. In this paper, a characterization of thenoise generated by the full-scale Nose Landing Gear (NLG) model is presented and the different techniques used for characterizing acoustic sources on the NLG are described. The landing gear noise source is characterized in terms of OASPL, directivity, source spectra, PNL and PNLT. A comparison between the NLG with and without the application of low noise technology is presented. © 2015 by ASME...|$|R
40|$|An {{infrared}} {{telescope is}} mounted in a <b>cavity</b> in the <b>fuselage</b> of a C- 141 airplane. The cavity is sealed {{off from the}} rest of the fuselage and can be opened to the outside for viewing. A retractable porous spoiler is installed ahead of the opening to inhibit cavity resonance. The paper presents the mean pressures, pressure fluctuations, spectra, phase, and coherence of the pressures in the cavity and on the <b>fuselage</b> near the <b>cavity,</b> along with pertinent acceleration and torque information for the aircraft structure and telescope. It is shown that a moderate spoiler extension controls resonance in normal flight attitudes and produces a cavity environment with approximately the same turbulence intensity as an attached turbulent boundary layer...|$|R
40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{analysis was}} made of the severity and effect of nonadiabatic surface conditions for a model in the NTF cryogenic wind tunnel. The nonadiabatic condition arises from heaters that are used to maintain a constant thermal environment for instrumentation internal to the model. The analysis was made for several axi-symmetric representations of a <b>fuselage</b> <b>cavity,</b> using a finite element heat conduction code. Potential flow and boundary layer codes were used to calculate the convection condition for the exterior surface of the model. The results of the steady state analysis show {{that it is possible to}} maintain the surface temperature very near the adiabatic value, with the judicious use of insulating material. Even for the most severe nonadiabatic condition studied, the effects on skin friction drag and displacement thickness were only marginally significant. The thermal analysis also provided an estimate of the power required to maintain a specified cavity temperature...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} <b>fuselage</b> shell and <b>cavity</b> {{response}} measurements conducted on a DC- 9 aircraft test section are described. The objectives of these measurements were {{to define the}} shell and cavity model characteristics of the fuselage, understand the structural-acoustic coupling characteristics of the fuselage, and measure {{the response of the}} fuselage to different types of acoustic and vibration excitation. The fuselage was excited with several combinations of acoustic and mechanical sources using interior and exterior loudspeakers and shakers, and the response to these inputs was measured with arrays of microphones and accelerometers. The data were analyzed to generate spatial plots of the shell acceleration and cabin acoustic pressure field, and corresponding acceleration and pressure wavenumber maps. Analysis and interpretation of the spatial plots and wavenumber maps provided the required information on modal characteristics, structural-acoustic coupling, and fuselage response...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect on}} drag of {{positioning}} symmetrically mounted Douglas Aircraft Company, Inc. stores in pairs on a parabolic fuselage of fineness ratio 10. 0 {{has been determined}} by flight tests of rocket-propelled, zero-lift models through a range of Mach number from 0. 9 to 1. 8. The stores were mounted in half-submerged positions and on pylons and were tested in three longitudinal locations on the fuselage with the forward position being located at the maximum diameter of the fuselage. The effects on drag of removing the half-submerged stores or extending them outward on pylons also was investigated by tests of models with half-submerged-store <b>cavities</b> on the <b>fuselage.</b> Two pylons differing in airfoil section and thickness were tested at the forward position of the stores on the <b>fuselage</b> with <b>cavities.</b> The half-submerged stores gave the smallest drag increments, which were approximately equal regardless of their respective longitudinal locations. Removing the half-submerged stores to expose the cavities increased the drag increments from two to three times. For the pylon-mounted stores, the store in the midposition had less drag than in the forward or rear positions at supersonic speeds. Adding the half-submerged-store cavities to the pylon-mounted-store configurations reduced the drag at the rear position between Mach numbers 0. 95 and 1. 50 and increased the drag at the midposition throughout the speed range. Changing from the 6 -percent-thick flat pylon to the 10 -percent-thick airfoil pylon increased the total drag slightly above Mach number 1. 10. Good agreement was obtain& between the experimental and theoretical interference drag coefficients for the pylon-mounted stores (without fuselage cavities} in the three longitudinal locations tested at Mach numbers 1. 2 and 1. 5...|$|R
