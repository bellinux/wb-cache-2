40|$|To {{stabilize}} the greenhouse gas {{concentrations in the}} atmosphere, market-based policy instruments are considered as effective solutions. Among these, the cap-and-trade systems are very popular and have been established over the globe. In most carbon markets, the European Union <b>Emission</b> <b>Trading</b> Scheme (EU ETS) has the largest scale. The regulatory framework of <b>international</b> and European <b>emission</b> <b>trading</b> scheme will be studied in this thesis. The benchmark product of EU ETS, the EUA futures contract, is largely traded. In the present research for pricing the carbon permits, reduced-form models {{have proved to be}} useful. The performance of the model proposed by Carmona and Hinz will be empirically analyzed. As evidence for a time-varying market price of risk can be found by applying statistical tests, the Carmona-Hinz framework can be extended by introducing a bivariate pricing model. This extended pricing model is able to extract information on the market price of risk and evaluate its impact on the EUA options.

5000|$|The {{roots of}} eco-capitalism {{can be traced}} back to the late 1960s. The [...] "Tragedy of the Commons", an essay {{published}} in 1968 in Science by Garrett Hardin, claimed the inevitability of malthusian catastrophe due to liberal or democratic government's policies to leave family size matters to the family, and enabling the welfare state to willingly care for potential overpopulation. Hardin argued that if families were given freedom of choice in the matter, but were removed from a welfare state, parents choosing to overbear would not have the resources to provide for their [...] "litter", thus solving the problem of overpopulation. This represents an early argument made from an eco-capitalist standpoint: overpopulation would technically be solved by a free market. John Baden, a collaborator with Garrett Hardin on other works including Managing the Commons, founded the Political Economy Research Center (now called the Property and Environment Research Center [...] ) in 1982. As one of the first eco-capitalist organizations created, PERC's ongoing mission is [...] "improving environmental quality through property rights and markets". The most popular eco-capitalist idea was emissions trading, or more commonly, cap and trade. Emissions trading, a market-based approach that allows polluting entities to purchase or be allocated permits, began being researched in the late 1960s. <b>International</b> <b>emissions</b> <b>trading</b> was significantly popularized in the 1990s when the United Nations adopted the Kyoto Protocol in 1997.|$|E
5000|$|The {{statement}} {{published on}} 29 March 1997 read as follows: I. The review {{conducted by a}} distinguished international panel of scientists {{under the auspices of}} the International Panel on Climate Change has determined that [...] "the balance of evidence suggests a discernable human influence on global climate." [...] As economists, we believe that global climate change carries with it significant environmental, economic, social, and geopolitical risks, and that preventive steps are justified.II. Economic studies have found that there are many potential policies to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions for which the total benefits outweigh the total costs. For the United States in particular, sound economic analysis shows that there are policy options that would slow climate change without harming American living standards, and that these measures may in fact improve U.S. productivity in the long run.III. The most efficient approach to slowing climate change is through market-based policies. In order for the world to achieve its climatic objectives at minimum cost, a cooperative approach among nations is required - such as an <b>international</b> <b>emissions</b> <b>trading</b> agreement. The United States and other nations can most efficiently implement their climate policies through market mechanisms, such as carbon taxes or the auction of emissions permits. The revenues generated from such policies can effectively be used to reduce the deficit or to lower existing taxes.|$|E
