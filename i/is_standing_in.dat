5|$|While rain {{starts to}} fall, and {{people start to}} clear the streets, Carey remains walking on the pathway. The girl now reaches her destination, and is welcomed into the home of her lover. They soon board a bus, and travel to a new home where they will live together. As {{they are about to}} enter the bus, the girl's mother is seen {{screaming}} in tears for her daughter to return to her. She hesitates, and then continues with her lover onto the transport. The scene once again focuses on Carey, who <b>is</b> <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> the midst of a torrential downpour, singing to the heavens. As she reaches the song's climax, Carey, now dry and dressed in a long black gown, is shown singing at the altar of a church. As she sings at the church, scenes of the girl lighting a candle, and her lover laying together with her on a bed are shown, before focusing back on Carey. She stares at an elderly couple in the first row at the church, an inter-racial couple now revealed to be her parents, and smiles while wearing her mother's charmbracelet. The elderly woman begins crying, as her husband holds her hand as they intently stare at Carey. Their faces rejuvenate to show them as a young couple, as their photo is taken and placed into the family album {{from the beginning of the}} video.|$|E

25|$|To prevent false-triggering of the {{automatic}} flush, most infrared detectors require that a presence be detected {{for at least}} five seconds, such as when a person <b>is</b> <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> front of it. This prevents a whole line of automatic flush units from triggering in succession if someone just walks past them. The automatic flush mechanism also typically waits for the presence to go out of sensor range before flushing. This reduces water usage, compared to a sensor that would trigger a continuous flushing action the whole time that a presence is detected.|$|E

25|$|In para-Alpine, skiers in this {{classification}} {{compete with}} one skis and two ski poles. The para-Alpine ski configuration {{is sometimes called}} a 3 track. FIS rules for para-Alpine ski boots and binding heights are modified for this class from rules applied to able bodied competitor's equipment. In para-Nordic, skiers compete with two skis and two poles. Skiers use skis that would be slightly longer than if they were able bodied. Skiers in this classification may use outriggers. Outriggers are forearm crutches with a miniature ski on a rocker at the base, and are fitted for the skier based {{the height of the}} skier's hip joint when the skier <b>is</b> <b>standing.</b> <b>In</b> the biathlon, athletes with amputations can use a rifle support while shooting.|$|E
25|$|The {{most famous}} Parthian art {{work is the}} bronze statue of a local prince found in the Iranian {{province}} of Bachtiyārī at Shami. It was found by farmers in {{the remains of a}} small shrine of Greek gods and Seleucid kings, who eventually became the cult of the gods and also of past rulers. The statue is almost perfectly preserved, with only the hands missing. It is made of two parts and consists of the body and the head, which was carried out separately and fitted later. The prince <b>is</b> <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> Parthian clothes with a dagger on the side. He wears medium length hair and a mustache. He wears long trousers and a tunic that leaves his chest partially exposed. The figure is aligned in front, radiating power and authority, even if the head seems disproportionately small. Daniel Schlumberger remarks that there is certainly a specific type that would have dressed thus. Here is a typical Parthian nobleman, {{as can be seen in}} the details of the costume. An inscription at the base assigns it to a specific person. The dating is uncertain, ranging somewhere from the 2nd century BC to the 2nd century AD The prince has not yet been identified, though, is often assumed to be Surenas. The high quality of the work sparked a lively debate about the place of manufacture. Theories range from Susa to an artist from Palmyra, who created the work on site.|$|E
500|$|While in Skinner's office, {{the camera}} angles and {{position}} of the characters reveals that the scene {{is intended to be}} a recreation of Leonardo da Vinci's famous painting The Last Supper. Skinner <b>is</b> <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> Saint Peter's spot, and Scully <b>is</b> <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> Judas Iscariot's place. Bush argues that, in this manner, the show is suggesting that Scully, like Judas, directly affects the fate of the savior, in this case Mulder. She notes that Scully's actions result in a fate that [...] "could not be realized without her participation". This {{is not the first time}} Scully has been compared to Judas in the show: the previous seventh season episode [...] ""—which is heavily based on Nikos Kazantzakis's novel The Last Temptation of Christ—features Scully in a role with direct literary parallels to Kazantzakis's heroic interpretation of Judas.|$|E

500|$|A {{digitally}} rejuvenated Patrick Stewart {{also makes}} an uncredited cameo as a younger Charles Xavier {{who appeared to}} not yet lose {{the use of his}} legs. However, with timeline and story inconsistencies within the film series, Singer developed an idea to tie all the films together and fix the continuity. In [...] Xavier loses the use of his legs at a much younger age, than he appears in Origins. As an explanation, Xavier can be seen walking in [...] (which chronologically takes place prior to the events of this film), by creating the illusion that he <b>is</b> <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> various scenes, when in reality the character is only present by telepathic projection.|$|E
500|$|Inside {{the cave}} are major carvings of Bahubali, Parshvanatha and Mahavira with {{symbolic}} display of other Tirthankaras. Bahubali <b>is</b> <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> Kayotsarga meditating posture with vines {{wrapped around his}} leg, his classic iconography. Parshvanatha is shown with the five-headed cobra hood. Mahavira is represented sitting on a lion throne, whose identifying markers are not visibly and is identified by some scholars simply as a [...] "seated Jina". This figure is flanked by bas-reliefs of attendants with chauri (fans), sardulas and makara's heads. Other carvings include Indrabhuti Gautama covered by four snakes, Brahmi and Sundari. In the sanctum is an image of Mahavira resting on a pedestal containing a 12th-century Kannada inscription marking {{the death of one}} Jakkave. Twenty four small Jaina Tirthankara images are engraved on the inner pillars and walls. In addition there are idols of Yakshas, Yakshis and Padmavati.|$|E

500|$|Stela 26, {{dating from}} 628 AD, {{features}} the aforementioned war with Palenque. This monument is notable because it {{marks the first}} time that a stela at Piedra Negras had carvings on multiple faces, in this case dedication texts. Stela 26 is aligned with Itzam K'an Ahk II's Stela 35, creating a direction connection between the two monuments, conveying [...] "an image of continuity, repetition, and renewal over time and across generations." [...] Stela 31, dating from around 637 AD, depicts the war with Sak Tz'i'. Stela 31's placement is also notable, as it <b>is</b> <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> front of Structures R-3 and R-4, where many of Piedras Negras's earliest monuments, such as Stela 30, stood. The platform for the monument was more expansive than other stelae platforms, giving more room for observation. The stela was also extremely tall, at about [...] meters in height, making it nearly two meters taller than Stela 26.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} scenes show Buchanan, Range and Buena at {{an outdoor}} swimming pool; Buchanan {{is sitting on a}} chair, Range <b>is</b> <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> front of a fence, and Buena is sitting on the pool's stairs. Five women are later shown dancing simultaneously by the pool. The video cuts to Buchanan sitting {{in the middle of a}} support group in a room in a university, with a blackboard behind her reading [...] "Heartbroken" [...] and [...] "Anonymous". She later leaves the room, and the video then shows the Sugababes sitting on a bench near the pool. Range is shown on the stage in a nightclub disco as a stripper. Like Mutya Buena, she acts up the courage and leaves her profession, then she throws the microphone into the water in the nightclub [...] Meanwhile, all three Sugababes appear under the running water of a shower tap, and are shown dancing with the group of women from the previous scenes. The final scenes of the video show three children swimming underwater in the pool, resembling the members of the Sugababes.|$|E
500|$|The {{universe}} of Howl's Moving Castle {{is depicted as}} not having clear-cut villains and heroes; instead, the characters are complex, and even those that are initially portrayed in a negative light, such as Howl, are shown as capable of change. Matt Kimmich has stated, however, that the simplistic message {{of the film is}} that [...] "war is bad." [...] A scene where Sophie <b>is</b> <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> a beautiful field of flowers is interrupted by a war machine, [...] "a finger accusing empire as the destroyer of peace." [...] This portrayal is in strong contrast to other Miyazaki films like Princess Mononoke, which criticizes military conflict in a more nuanced manner. Andrew Osmond stated that [...] "Howl's pure-hearted anti-war stance is presented as nihilism with no alternative as he fights forces from each side and becomes the worst terror of all," [...] {{in the form of the}} monstrous bird. By transforming into the bird, Howl risks losing his own humanity; Calcifer comments at one point that he will soon not be able to return to human form. In contrast, Ashitaka in Princess Mononoke fights the demonic sickness with which he is afflicted, and tries to negotiate a peace between the two sides. Osmond states that both films also point out the limits of masculinity, as exemplified by Howl and Ashitaka.|$|E

George and Anna Maria enter the palace and its catacombs where {{they find a}} golden cherub; they {{take it back to}} the hotel. After a romantic night with Anna Maria, George wakes up without her, and Mevlut comes in armed with a gun. George is locked up in a cell, as he is {{suspected}} to be a terrorist. In his cell, George gets a visit from Father Nicolas and Sister Immaculata, who says that he should meet her on the roof. George escapes from the cell and meets with Immaculata, who appears to be Nicole [...] "Nico" [...] Collard (his companion in previous installments). They return to the hotel, where George finds out Anna Maria has an apartment in Rome. In Rome, in front of Anna Maria's apartment building, George meets Brother Mark.

500|$|Sednaoui {{experimented with}} a variety of {{cinematography}} techniques including wide-angle lenses, shots from below the subjects, superimposition, vertically cut screens displaying different angles of the same shot, reverse film effects, multiple lighting situations and flashy clothing to convey his concept. Frusciante noted the feeling of the video to be extremely vibrant and over the top: [...] "When it was us just painting ourselves silver and wearing these big silver boots and stuff, I mean it felt like glam rock or something." [...] The video begins with a wide-angle shot of Flea in a desert setting wearing pants with several gold colored horns protruding from each leg. The bassist <b>is</b> <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> a meditative stance and brings his arms together above his head when the music begins to play. The video then transitions between a variety of shots edited together that consist of the four band members standing with their eyes closed; the band dancing around in a dimly lit setting; a ground view of Frusciante playing a reflective silver Fender Stratocaster in between his legs while wearing pants made up entirely of small pieces of mirror; the band members moving around with full makeup on; and the band members dancing frenziedly. Kiedis adopted a deliberately outlandish wardrobe which incorporated gold lipstick, thinly braided hair, revealing meshed shorts and bright silver boots.|$|E
