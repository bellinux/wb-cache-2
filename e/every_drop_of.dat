5|$|Rarely, Banai {{also appears}} in Khandoba's chief legend where he slays the demons Mani and Malla. Mhalsa and Banai (or Ganga) futilely help Khandoba {{in the battle}} to collect the blood of Mani, <b>every</b> <b>drop</b> <b>of</b> which was {{creating}} a new demon. Finally, the dog of Khandoba swallows all the blood. Rarely, Banai is described as seated behind Khandoba on the horse and fighting with a sword or spear, a role generally assigned to Mhalsa.|$|E
5|$|Oral stories {{continue}} {{the process of}} Sanskritization of Khandoba— his elevation from a folk deity to Shiva, a deity of the classical Hindu pantheon— that was initiated by the texts. Khandoba's wives Mhalsa and Banai are also identified with Shiva's classical Hindu wives Parvati and Ganga. Hegadi Pradhan, the minister and brother-in-law of Khandoba and brother of Lingavat Vani Mhalsa, the faithful dog that helps Khandoba kill the demons, the horse given by Mani and the demon brothers are considered avatars of Vishnu, Krishna, Nandi and the demons Madhu-Kaitabha respectively. Other myth variants narrate that Khandoba defeats a single demon named Manimalla, who offers his white horse, sometimes called Mani, to the god. Other legends depict Mhalsa (or Parvati) and Banai or Banu (or Ganga) as futilely helping Khandoba in the battle to collect the blood of Mani, <b>every</b> <b>drop</b> <b>of</b> which was creating a new demon. Finally, the dog of Khandoba swallows all the blood. Sometimes, Mhalsa, or rarely Banai, is described as seated behind Khandoba on the horse and fighting with a sword or spear.|$|E
25|$|During {{a fierce}} battle {{in which the}} Great Goddess {{demonstrates}} her omnipotence by defeating powerful demons who terrify the devas, she encounters the fierce Raktabija (chapter 8). <b>Every</b> <b>drop</b> <b>of</b> blood Raktabija sheds transforms into another demon as it touches the earth. A unique strategy has to be devised to vanquish him. A fiery burst of energy emerging from Devi's third eye takes the dark skeletal form of goddess Kali. With her huge mouth and enormous tongue she ferociously laps up Raktabija's blood, thus preventing the uprising of further demons.|$|E

The U.S. federal government was the main driving force behind the construction of dams and aqueducts, although many state and local water agencies were also involved. Most of the major dams were built between 1910 and 1970; the system keystone, Hoover Dam, was completed in 1935.

500|$|Critics also {{commented on}} the {{contrast}} between lyrical themes and underlying music. Digital Spys Harry Fletcher wrote that there is [...] "something eminently Mancunian" [...] about the clash in styles. Uncut praised the band's [...] "innovative songcraft", but added [...] "their tendency to overthink and squeeze <b>every</b> <b>drop</b> <b>of</b> pleasure from their work does them few favours", while Mojo suggested that they were [...] "self-consciously dialing everything up to 11 before things go up in flames". The Guardians Alexis Petridis compared the album's sound to its themes in a three-star review, suggesting that the album [...] " [...] the information overload of 24-hour rolling news so well that it essentially provokes the same reaction: it's often compelling, but you occasionally find yourself gripped by an overwhelming urge to turn it off". The album was among the favourites for the Mercury Prize, with British bookmakers Ladbrokes at one time offering odds of 4/1, but was not among the twelve albums selected for the shortlist. BBC News Online included the album on their list of [...] "ten albums they missed".|$|E

500|$|Her {{best known}} {{appearance}} on the battlefield is in the sixth century Devi Mahatmyam. The deity of {{the first chapter of}} Devi Mahatmyam is Mahakaali, who appears from the body of sleeping Vishnu as goddess Yoga Nidra to wake him up in order to protect Bramha and the World from two demons Madhu and Kaitabha. When Vishnu woke up he started a war against the two demons. After a long battle with Lord Vishnu when the two demons were undefeated Mahakaali took the form of Mahamaya to enchant the two asuras. When Madhu and Kaitabha were enchanted by Mahakaali, Vishnu killed them. In the later chapters the story of two demons can be found who were destroyed by Kaali. Chanda and Munda attack the goddess Durga. Durga responds with such anger that her face turns dark and Kaali appears out of her forehead. Kaali's appearance is black, gaunt with sunken eyes, and wearing a tiger skin and a garland of human heads. She immediately defeats the two demons. Later in the same battle, the demon Raktabija is undefeated because of his ability to reproduce himself from <b>every</b> <b>drop</b> <b>of</b> his blood that reaches the ground. Countless Raktabija clones appear on the battlefield. Kaali eventually defeats him by sucking his blood before it can reach the ground, and eating the numerous clones. Kinsley writes that Kaali represents [...] "Durga's personified wrath, her embodied fury." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{classical}} rabbis argued that, in {{a number}} of cases, only if it is impossible to remove <b>every</b> <b>drop</b> <b>of</b> blood, the prohibition against consuming blood was impractical, and there should be rare exceptions: they claimed that consuming the blood that remained on the inside of meat (as opposed to the blood on the surface of it, dripping from it, or housed within the veins) should be permitted and that the blood of fish and locusts could also be consumed.|$|E

2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the drift, the total rations consisted of 45 biscuits, two tins of chocolate and six tins of malted milk tablets per raft. Water was not a problem {{in the early part of}} the voyage due to frequent heavy rain. In May however, it became scarce and was reduced at one stage to 3 oz per man per day. Rations were supplemented by an occasional fish caught by the Malays using an improvised spear made from a pair of scissors lashed to a raft stanchion. Fishing lines in the rafts were useless as the hooks had been stolen. [...] In all 27 fish, along with two birds and one small turtle, were captured in this manner and eaten raw. However, there were long periods with no solid food - up to 10 days at one stage and nine days on another.
