40|$|The Australian National Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease Registry (ANCJDR) was {{established}} by the Commonwealth Government in October 1993 {{in response to the}} recognition of four probable <b>human</b> <b>pituitary</b> <b>hormone</b> related Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) deaths. An inquiry 1 into CJD in Australia and the use of human pituitary hormones under the Australian <b>Human</b> <b>Pituitary</b> <b>Hormone</b> Program suggested the expansion of some activities of the Registry to include retrospective case ascertainment from 1 January 1970. In parallel with monitoring possible medically acquired (iatrogenic) cases of CJD, the ANCJDR prospectively monitors and investigates all suspect cases of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies occurring within the states and territories of Australia, including sporadic and familial, and the potential occurrence of variant CJD. The ANCJDR also actively participates in an international surveillance consortium. This brief report summarises methods of classifi cation and ascertainment as well as current epidemiological fi ndings and new surveillance techniques that are being adopted to improve case ascertainment.

40|$|We {{have shown}} {{recently}} that leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and oncostatin M (OSM), {{two members of}} the gp 130 -dependent cytokine family, stimulate murine proopiomelanocortin (POMC) transcription and adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH) secretion. LIF and corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) also synergistically induced in vivo ACTH secretion in fetal nonhuman primates. To elucidate the role of the gp 130 -related cytokines in <b>human</b> <b>pituitary</b> <b>hormone</b> regulation, we tested expression of gp 130 -related cytokine receptors in human fetal pituitaries. Using RT-PCR, mRNA expression of receptors for LIF, IL- 6, and CRH, and the gp 130 subunit, were all detected in fetal pituitaries of 18 - and 31 -wk gestation. Recombinant human IL- 6, LIF, and OSM treatments of primary human fetal pituitary cultures (16 - 31 wk) increased ACTH secretion by up to 48 % (P < 0. 05) using doses of 1 nM, and when fetal cultures were cotreated with CRH, ACTH was induced five- to sixfold as compared to CRH alone (three- to fourfold; P = 0. 01). Incubation with gp 130 -specific antibody suppressed basal and cytokine-stimulated ACTH secretion (alone or with CRH) from human fetal cells. Human POMC promoter - 879 /+ 6 fused to the luciferase reporter gene and transfected into AtT- 20 cells, was stimulated by LIF (7 -fold), which also exerted strong (22 -fold) synergy with CRH on POMC transcription. Growth hormone (GH) release from fetal cultures was modestly stimulated (15 - 31 %, P < 0. 05), while other anterior pituitary hormones were not altered by these cytokines. Thus, physiologic concentrations of the gp 130 -related cytokines have direct effects on ACTH and GH regulation in the human pituitary, indicating that gp 130 -dependent signals serve as a paracrine system controlling early human pituitary function...|$|E

GHB stimulated the releases of growth hormone (GH), prolactin (PRL) and cortisol but not luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and thyrotropin (TSH) in healthy male volunteers. In patients with hypothalamic disorders, plasma GH, PRL and cortisol levels did not increase after GHB administration. In patients with diabetes insipidus, plasma GH responses to GHB were lower than those in normal control, but plasma cortisol and PRL responses were normal. In patients with hypopituitarism, plasma GH and cortisol levels did not elevate after GHB injection, but plasma PRL responses to GHB was normal in three out of patients. In patients with pituitary dwarfism, plasma PRL and cortisol levels increased after GHB injection but plasma GH did not respond to GHB. In patients with acromegaly, plasma GH responses after GHB administration was not consistent. In cases with Cushing's syndrome, plasma cortisol levels increased in patients with adrenocortical hyperplasia but not in those with adrenocortical adenoma. Although plasma GH responses after GHB injection disappeared in patients with Cushing's syndrome, plasma PRL responses was slightly greater than that in normal subjects. In a patient with Addison's disease, plasma ACTH level increased, and plasma PRL and GH responses were normal after GHB injection. To study the relationship between GHB and biogenic amines induced release of <b>human</b> <b>pituitary</b> <b>hormones,</b> the dopaminergic mechanism was blocked by pimozide or stimulated by CB- 154 administration, and the serotonergic mechanism was blocked by parachlorophenyl-alanine (PCPA) before GHB administration. GHB induced GH release after treatment with pimozide or PCPA was not significantly different from GH release induced by GHB alone. CB- 154 inhibited the increase of plasma GH induced by GHB. Plasma PRL responses to GHB was completely inhibited by CB- 154 pretreatment, but not altered by pimozide or PCPA pretreatment. Plasma cortisol responses to GHB was inhibited by pimozide or PCPA pretreatment, but CB- 154 had no effect on plasma cortisol responses to GHB injection. GH and cortisol releases induced by GHB was inhibited by continuous TRH infusion. These results suggest that GHB administration is a useful method for examining <b>pituitary</b> <b>hormone</b> secretion.

40|$|Human prion {{diseases}} {{can be classified}} as sporadic, hereditary or acquired. The cause of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is unknown, hereditary cases are associated with mutations of the prion protein gene (PRNP) and acquired forms are caused by the transmission of infection from human to human or, as a zoonosis, from cattle to human. Although acquired forms of human prion disease are rare, the transmission of a fatal and untreatable neurological disorder has had major implications for public health and public policy. Iatrogenic CJD Since the first evidence of iatrogenic transmission of CJD in 1974, via a corneal transplant, other mechanisms of iatrogenic transmission have been identified including neurosurgical instruments, depth electrodes, <b>human</b> <b>pituitary</b> <b>hormones</b> and <b>human</b> dura mater grafts.

40|$|Abstract—Objective: To {{investigate}} {{risk factors}} for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) in patients in the United Kingdom treated with <b>human</b> <b>pituitary</b> growth <b>hormone</b> (hGH). Methods: Incidence rates of CJD, based on person-year denominators, were assessed in a cohort of 1, 848 patients treated with hGH in the United Kingdom from 1959 through 1985 and followed {{to the end of}} 2000. Results: CJD developed in 38 patients. Risk of CJD was significantly increased by treatment with hGH prepared by the Wilhelmi method of extraction from <b>human</b> <b>pituitaries.</b> Risk was further raised if this treatment was administered at ages 8 to 10 years. The peak risk of CJD was estimated to occur 20 years after first exposure, and the estimated lifetime cumulative risk of CJD in Wilhelmi-treated patients was 4. 5 %. Conclusions: Sizeexclusion chromatography, used in non-Wilhelmi preparation methods, may prevent CJD infection. Susceptibility to CJD may vary with age, and susceptibility may be present in only a few percent of the population.

PATIENTS [...] All patients (1246 male, 662 female) treated for short stature with <b>pituitary</b> growth <b>hormone</b> under the Medical Research Council working party and health services human growth hormone committee. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Death or development of neoplasia. RESULTS [...] 110 patients died (68 male, 42 female; aged 0. 9 - 57 years) from 1972 to 1990. Fifty three death were from neoplasia responsible for growth hormone deficiency (27 craniopharyngioma, 24 other intracranial tumour, two leukaemia); two from histiocytosis X; and 13 from pituitary insufficiency. Six patients died of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, six of other neurological disorders, and eight of acute infection. Other deaths were apparently unrelated to growth hormone deficiency or its treatment. Seventeen tumours (in 16 patients) were identified during or after growth hormone treatment. Four were in patients with previous intracranial neoplasia and two were after cranial irradiation. Thirteen were intracranial, the others being Hodgkin's lymphoma, osteosarcoma, carcinoma of colon, and basal cell carcinoma. CONCLUSIONS [...] Recurrence or progression of intracranial tumours and potentially avoidable metabolic consequences of hypopituitarism were the main causes of death. Growth hormone treatment probably did not contribute to new tumour development. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease after <b>pituitary</b> growth <b>hormone</b> treatment continues to occur in the United Kingdom. This cohort must remain under long term review...|$|R
