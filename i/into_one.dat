5|$|In general, any three {{distinct}} circles {{have a unique}} circle—the radical circle—that intersects all of them perpendicularly; {{the center of that}} circle is the radical center of the three circles. For illustration, the orange circle in Figure6 crosses the black given circles at right angles. Inversion in the radical circle leaves the given circles unchanged, but transforms the two conjugate pink solution circles <b>into</b> <b>one</b> another. Under the same inversion, the corresponding points of tangency of the two solution circles are transformed <b>into</b> <b>one</b> another; for illustration, in Figure6, the two blue points lying on each green line are transformed <b>into</b> <b>one</b> another. Hence, the lines connecting these conjugate tangent points are invariant under the inversion; therefore, they must pass through the center of inversion, which is the radical center (green lines intersecting at the orange dot in Figure 6).|$|E

5|$|A {{benzodiazepine}} can {{be placed}} <b>into</b> <b>one</b> of three groups by its elimination half-life, or {{time it takes for}} the body to eliminate half of the dose. Some benzodiazepines have long-acting active metabolites, such as diazepam and chlordiazepoxide, which are metabolised into desmethyldiazepam. Desmethyldiazepam has a half-life of 36–200 hours, and flurazepam, with the main active metabolite of desalkylflurazepam, with a half-life of 40–250 hours. These long-acting metabolites are partial agonists.|$|E

5|$|A steel {{arch bridge}} {{was built in}} the 1950s over the Northeast Arm. It was named the East River Bridge. It was {{replaced}} by a new bridge with the same name in December 2015.

It was closed in 2017, as part of the plan to consolidate four schools in the area <b>into</b> <b>one</b> new, larger school.|$|E
5|$|After the {{revisions}} were completed, much of {{the plot}} stayed the same, but several events in the original draft were cut out to strengthen the whole book. Stead combined two characters <b>into</b> <b>one,</b> having a stronger outline and also cut out several scenes for minor characters. In the end, Stead found that the revisions helped to make the book more cohesive.|$|E
5|$|Although {{many of the}} first-season cast {{were set}} to return, the {{producers}} had {{a large number of}} new characters to cast for the second season. Due to this, Benioff and Weiss postponed the introduction of several key characters and merged several characters <b>into</b> <b>one</b> or assigned plot functions to different characters.|$|E
