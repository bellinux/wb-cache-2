5000|$|An {{incredible}} discovery {{on one of}} Saturn’s moons leads a {{force of}} humans to a broken planet on {{the far reaches of}} the universe. A source of energy called Aleph exists there that grants ultimate power to who ever controls it.However, after becoming trapped on the planet, the human forces split into factions and fight amongst themselves for supremacy and dominion over the Aleph. The peaceful inhabitants of the planet decide enough is enough and a hero emerges amongst them who hopes to lead his people to freedom. Using nefarious means and exploiting the disunity amongst the human ranks, <b>Harec</b> recruits a rag tag group of rogues, outlaws and hired guns from the various factions and pits them against those who would destroy his people. As they begin to fight back against the human invaders, the Raiders soon face a new deadly threat wholly intent on making the entire universe burn, just for kicks…. whose side will you take in the fight to come? ...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} the management situation for the Columbiaroot-knot nematode (Meloidogyne chitwoodi) in potato, using an approach with systems thinking and interactive meetings. The focus of current research for control of this nematode was evaluated. Control practices include crop rotation, and this study also evaluated popcorn cultivars for their potential as resistant rotation crops. Popcorn cultivars were grown in M. chitwoodi race 1 infested soil at the Hermiston Agricultural Research and Extension Center (<b>HAREC),</b> Hermiston, OR. Soil samples were taken soon after planting (initial) and before harvest (final), {{and the number of}} M. chitwoodi juveniles / 250 g dry soil was calculated for each sample. A reproduction index was calculated for the nematode reproduction on each cultivar: R value = initial / final population. Cultivars were categorized as good, poor- and nonhosts depending on their R values. Popcorn cultivars were also tested for their host status in the greenhouse. Plants were inoculated with approximately 5000 M. chitwoodi eggs (initial), and after 55 days, eggs were extracted from the roots (final). In the field and greenhouse tests, field corn (FC) cv Pioneer 3578 was tested as a good host check. Among cultivars tested in both the field and greenhouse, the seven with the lowest R values as...|$|E
