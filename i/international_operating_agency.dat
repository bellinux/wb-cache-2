40|$|One of the {{fundamental}} principles of the Chicago Convention is the principle of nationality of aircraft. It is {{the means by which}} the Convention attaches most of the rights and obligations that it creates to aircraft and state of registry, irrespective of who owns or operates the aircraft. Yet the rules of the Convention on nationality and registration can give rise to serious practical problems when an aircraft registered in one state is cooperatively arranged to be operated by an operator belonging to another state. This thesis takes {{a closer look at the}} principle of nationality of aircraft in international aviation law and gives an outline of the history of this concept. Further, it explains how nowadays this principle is applied to aircraft <b>operated</b> by <b>international</b> <b>operating</b> <b>agencies,</b> and to aircraft registered in one state and leased, chartered or inter-changed by operators belonging to other states. The concept of 'nationality of aircraft' should not be confused with the concept of 'nationality of airlines'. Another part of my thesis is dedicated to this concept of 'nationality of airlines', which is of major importance in aviation too. This part contains a general explanation on this concept as well as some examples of the ownership and control requirements in different national laws. Besides introducing the Community Air Carrier concept, it focusses on the question if the ownership and control clauses included in bilateral agreements are compatible with today's trend towards global carriers and international mergers.

40|$|Kosovo is {{currently}} operating {{as an independent}} economic state, having severed the majority of economic links with the former Yugoslavia. This article explains why the Yugoslav dinar {{was replaced by the}} DM (in turn replaced by the Euro) as the new national currency of post-conflict Kosovo. Use of the DM, coupled with a relatively open trade policy, has resulted in a severe visible trade deficit. The stock of DM is continuously being replenished by the inflow of money both from the various <b>international</b> <b>agencies</b> <b>operating</b> in Kosovo and from remittances from Kosovars working abroad. The article argues that, even with the current low level of export earnings, the economy of Kosovo is economically sustainable, since the international presence in Kosovo is partly responsible for the high demand for imports. However, {{in the absence of a}} competitive export sector, the economy is still highly reliant upon the inflow of remittances, without which Kosovo would be unable to meet the costs of vital imports. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} investigates {{reasons for}} differences in quality between advertisements created by local and <b>international</b> advertising <b>agencies</b> <b>operating</b> in Saudi Arabia. It focuses on the investment in, and use of, computer technology {{as a factor in}} creating these differences, along with other factors such as work practices, skills, organizational structure, education and design strategies. The objectives of this research are to identify the causes of differences in quality of advertising design outputs between local agencies and <b>international</b> advertising <b>agencies</b> <b>operating</b> in Saudi Arabia; to compare the advertising design processes, practices, resources and difficulties of local and international advertising agencies; and to identify strategies that may improve the quality of local advertising design. The research uses a multi-method approach, using both questionnaires and semi-structured interviews to collect data from 223 professionals working in the field of advertising design in four major cities in Saudi Arabia (Riyadh, Jeddah, Dammam and Khamis Mushait). Participants were selected to provide a balance between local and international advertising agencies. These data confirm that advertisements created by local advertising agencies are commonly considered lower in quality than those of international agencies; it also quantifies participants’ understanding {{of the reasons for the}} differences. These reasons, rarely operating alone, include the skill of local staff in using modern computer technology and design software; weaknesses in professional processes and business structures; insufficient design education and training of local designers; limited investment of financial resources in local agencies in terms of technology, management and employment; low investment in novel ideas and concepts; and over-involvement of clients in creative processes. Several strategies and policies to improve the quality and strength of the local advertising industry are identified. In particular, improve the take up and use high performance computer hardware and appropriate professional design software in the field of local advertising; this research also identifies the importance of improving Saudi design education and training, with particular note made of the lack of training in this field for males in Saudi universities. Local Saudi media have a significant role to play in helping to improve visual cultural awareness in Saudi Arabian society. This research offers insights and suggestions that will have positive benefits for local advertising agencies and their clients...|$|R
