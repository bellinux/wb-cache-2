5|$|Two events {{affected}} me most, one when a colleague dropped himself from second floor to escape under-covered police who stormed school. The second incident was when a dear teacher was arrested. That is when my voice started {{to rise and}} become annoying. I was caught vandalizing a school wall by writing apolitical human rights statements on school walls and was given the choice to either be submitted to police or to switch school. So I took the <b>easy</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> and since I was the top student back then, I choose to switch to Sheikh Abdul Aziz school.|$|E
25|$|Other {{languages}} such as Epigram {{make the}} value of all expressions in the language decidable so that type checking can be decidable. However, in general proof of decidability is undecidable, so many programs require hand-written annotations that may be very non-trivial. As this impedes the development process, many language implementations provide an <b>easy</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> {{in the form of}} an option to disable this condition. This, however, comes at the cost of making the type-checker run in an infinite loop when fed programs that do not type-check, causing the compilation to fail.|$|E
25|$|Kathy persuades The Samaritans to {{take her}} back as a volunteer, on the {{condition}} she is shadowed following her previous stint. Disa O'Brien (Jan Graveson) phones The Samaritans and tells Kathy her baby, Billie O'Brien, {{is the product of}} rape and fathered by her stepfather, Ken Raynor (Ian Redford). Willmott-Brown is released from prison. He sends Kathy a tape telling her that he wants to meet her and that he has changed. Kathy pleads with him to leave and never return but he moves to the Square and continues to pester her, until Kathy relays the hurt and anger he had caused her, gaining some closure. James threatens suicide but Kathy stops him, refusing to let him take the <b>easy</b> <b>way</b> <b>out.</b> After a heated conversation in which James pleads for forgiveness, Kathy convinces him to leave Walford. She also convinces Pete — who has been hoping for reconciliation — that their marriage is over. Later, Kathy begins a relationship with market inspector Richard Cole (Ian Reddington), which sours when she discovers that he is taking a cash bribe and allowing a mobile hot dog van to trade in direct competition with her café.|$|E

500|$|Many reviews also {{commented on}} the game's {{relationship}} with Final Fantasy VII. 1UP.com called {{it one of the}} best prequels of all time, arguing that it [...] "does a better job of putting players in FFVII's world than even the original game did." [...] While GameTrailers stated that Crisis Core [...] "doesn't take the <b>easy</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> and photocopy the source," [...] they found it, unlike Dirge of Cerberus, to be appealing. Computer and Video Games mentioned that despite the game's main story only lasting 12 hours, the side-quests helped expand the game's length. They further praised the battle system, claiming [...] " [...] never becomes tiresome," [...] and {{the fact that some of}} the weak points from Final Fantasy VII ("lengthy wandering, and an overlong center") were not issues in this game.|$|E
500|$|This {{conceptualisation}} of the Wake as a {{dream is}} a point of contention for some. Harry Burrell, representative of this view, argues that [...] "one of the most overworked ideas is that Finnegans Wake is about a dream. It is not, and there is no dreamer." [...] Burrell argues that the theory is an <b>easy</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> for [...] "critics stymied by the difficulty of comprehending the novel and the search for some kind of understanding of it." [...] The point upon which a number of critics fail to concur with Burrell's argument is its dismissal of the testimony of the book's author on the matter as [...] "misleading... publicity efforts". Parrinder, equally skeptical of the concept of the Wake as a dream, argues that Joyce {{came up with the idea}} of representing his linguistic experiments as a language of the night around 1927 as a means of battling his many critics, further arguing that [...] "since it cannot be said that neologism is a major feature of the dreaming process, such a justification for the language of Finnegans Wake smacks dangerously of expediency." ...|$|E

500|$|Allegations {{were made}} by the online {{community}} that Odex had passed off fansubs as its own work. Sing admitted that this was partially true as Odex had hired anime fans to do subtitling in 2004 who had taken [...] "the <b>easy</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> and copied word for word the subtitles on fansubs they downloaded". Sing explained that when Odex released its anime, the company did not realise what the anime fans had done, and it has been [...] "paying for this mistake ever since". It was reported {{at the same time that}} all of Odex's translation and subtitling was now done [...] "in house". However, Odex's release of The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya in September 2007 was found to contain translations strongly resembling an earlier unauthorised fansub release. Emails were also sent to the media saying that Sing and Go were directors and shareholders of a defunct company, Games Mart, that shared the same corporate address as Odex and had been raided in 1999 by the police for selling game consoles with unauthorized modifications. This information was confirmed by the press, and Go wrote a letter to the media explaining that Games Mart was not affiliated with Odex in any way.|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert gave a very {{positive}} review. [...] "Superman is a pure delight, a wondrous combination of all the old-fashioned things we never really get tired of: adventure and romance, heroes and villains, earthshaking special effects and wit. Reeve is perfectly cast in the role. Any poor choice would have ruined the film." [...] Ebert placed the film on his 10 best list of 1978. He would later go on to place it on his [...] "Great Movies" [...] list. James Berardinelli believed [...] "there's no doubt that it's a flawed movie, but it's {{one of the most}} wonderfully entertaining flawed movies made during the 1970s. It's exactly what comic book fans hoped it would be. Perhaps most heartening of all, however, is the message {{at the end of the}} credits announcing the impending arrival of Superman II." [...] Harry Knowles is a longtime fan of the film, but was critical of elements that did not represent the Superman stories as seen in the comics. Dave Kehr felt [...] "the tone, style, and point of view change almost from shot to shot. This is the definitive corporate film. It is best when it takes itself seriously, worst when it takes the <b>easy</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> in giggly camp. When Lex Luthor enters the action, Hackman plays the arch-villain like a hairdresser left over from a TV skit." [...] Neal Gabler similarly felt that the film focused too much on shallow comedy. He also argued that the film should have adhered more to the spirit of Mario Puzo's original script, and referred to the first three Superman films collectively as [...] "simply puffed-up TV episodes." ...|$|E
500|$|Television critics {{reacted with}} mixed {{reaction}} toward the episode, with one critic calling the storyline [...] "pretty dull." [...] In a simultaneous {{review of the}} episodes of American Dad!, The Simpsons and Bob's Burgers that preceded the show, and the episode of The Cleveland Show that followed it, The A.V. Clubs Rowan Kaiser wrote, [...] "I don't {{have much to say}} about tonight's Family Guy. Last week, we had some comments about how Family Guy seems to be willing to play with its format this season. That didn't happen this week at all." [...] Kaiser went on to criticize the flashback involving Lois and Joyce in high school, stating, [...] "Having a previously unknown flashback as the big reveal feels like cheating, if you're inclined to view Family Guy as consistent." [...] He concluded his review by praising [...] "the burning bush" [...] joke, and ultimately gave the episode a C- rating, the worst rating of the night. It was beaten by the American Dad! episode [...] "Fart-Break Hotel", The Cleveland Show episode [...] "How Do You Solve a Problem Like Roberta?", The Simpsons episode [...] "Flaming Moe", and the Bob's Burgers episode [...] "Crawl Space". In a slightly more positive review of the episode, Jason Hughes of TV Squad praised the episode for some of its [...] "silly side jokes," [...] but felt disappointed by the ending to the show, commenting, [...] "it didn't follow any real logic [...] It was an <b>easy</b> <b>way</b> <b>out,</b> as if they'd written themselves into a corner." [...] Hughes also criticized the episode for its dependence on cutaway gags, writing, [...] "at least there were some funnier moments in this one. Unfortunately, a lot of those came in the cutaways. And I thought we were starting to move away from a dependence on them." [...] Hughes went on to comment that he felt confused by Stewie possibly being fathered by a porn star, adding that [...] "it would be far more likely that Chris or Meg was fathered by the porn star." ...|$|E

2500|$|In The A.B.C. Murders, {{the murderer}} has killed four {{innocent}} people {{and attempted to}} frame an unstable man for the crimes. Hercule Poirot, however, prevents this <b>easy</b> <b>way</b> <b>out,</b> ensuring a trial and hanging. In And Then There Were None, the killer's own death is intrinsic to the plot; the red herring is when and how the killer actually died. However, stage, film, and television productions {{of some of these}} mysteries were traditionally sanitized with the culprits not evading some form of justice, for a variety of reasons– e.g., censors, plot clarity, and Christie's own changing tastes. (When Christie adapted Witness for the Prosecution into a stage play, she lengthened the ending so that the murderer was also killed; this format was followed in screen versions, including the Billy Wilder film from 1957.) In Death Comes as the End, set in ancient Egypt, the culprit is killed by one of the few surviving characters before he can claim another victim [...]|$|E
2500|$|... "It is {{a widely}} held opinion that {{dyslexia}} is associated with remarkably artistic creativity." [...] This leads to {{us to look at}} art schools {{to see if there are}} high numbers of people who have dyslexia. The answer is yes, there is an unusually high correlation between people with dyslexia and art students. The question should be why? [...] There are speculations that dyslexics have differing brain structures and functions. There tends to be a lack of objective studies that confirm the art and dyslexia relationship. The Wolff and Lundberg article implies that it isn't that easy to get into art school; that people with dyslexia earn their entrance into the art schools on artistic merit, as an <b>easy</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> of conventional academics. Corlu, Özcan, and Korkmazlar suggest that further research is a valid research concern. There are studies that seemingly coincide with the concept that people with dyslexia see the world differently. There seems to be evidence that dyslexics have a superior level of visuospatial skill. Gross and Bornstein think that dyslexia might be due to a difficulty in treating mirror images as the same stimulus, when taking into consideration words that are commonly switched, such as god and dog, no and on, and saw and was.|$|E

40|$|Two {{plausible}} claims {{seem to be}} {{inconsistent with}} each other. One {{is the idea that}} if one reasonably believes that one ought to fi, then indeed, on pain of acting irrationally, one ought to fi. The other is the view that we are fallible with respect to our beliefs about what we ought to do. Ewing’s Problem is how to react to this apparent inconsistency. I reject two <b>easy</b> <b>ways</b> <b>out.</b> One is Ewing’s own solution to his problem, which is to introduce two different notions of ought. The other is the view that Ewing’s Problem rests on a simple confusion regarding the scope of the ought-operator. Then, I discuss two hard <b>ways</b> <b>out,</b> which I label objectivism and subjectivism, and for which G. E. Moore and Bishop Butler are introduced as historical witnesses. These are hard <b>ways</b> <b>out</b> because both of these views have strong counterintuitive consequences. After explaining why Ewing’s Problem is so difficult, I show that there is conceptual room in-between Moore and Butler, but I remain sceptical whether Ewing’s Problem is solvable within a realist framework of normative facts...|$|R

2500|$|Jazz music {{commonly}} uses {{both the}} major and the minor pentatonic scales. Pentatonic scales {{are useful for}} improvisers in modern jazz, pop, and rock contexts because they work well over several chords diatonic to the same key, often better than the parent scale. For example, the blues scale is predominantly derived from the minor pentatonic scale, a very popular scale for improvisation in the realms of blues and rock alike. [...] For instance, over a C major triad (C, E, G) in the key of C major, the note F can be perceived as dissonant {{as it is a}} half step above the major third (E) of the chord. It is for this reason commonly avoided. Using the major pentatonic scale is an <b>easy</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> of this problem. The scale tones 1, 2, 3, 5, 6 (from the major pentatonic) are either major triad tones (1, 3, 5) or common consonant extensions (2, 6) of major triads. For the corresponding relative minor pentatonic, scale tones 1, 3, 4, 5, 7 work the same way, either as minor triad tones (1, 3, 5) or as common extensions (4, 7), as they all avoid being a half step from a chord tone.|$|E
