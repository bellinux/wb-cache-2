5|$|On 13 April 1948, the <b>goods</b> <b>hoist</b> to the Waterloo and City line {{began to}} sink while a M7 class tank engine was pushing loaded coal wagons onto it. The engine {{dropped into the}} hoist's shaft, ending up {{upside-down}} and spurting steam over it. The driver and fireman managed to jump free, and the locomotive was rescued piecemeal and used for spares.|$|E
50|$|Al-Samaha Trade Holding Company {{specializes in}} trade within {{local and global}} markets. Its {{activities}} include importation of consumer <b>goods,</b> <b>hoist</b> platforms and servicing contracts to operate e-government services.|$|E
50|$|The {{basement}} is a utilitarian space extending {{under the}} west wing of the Institute. It is accessed from a staircase below the main staircase in the entrance hall and from a vehicle ramp at the south west corner {{at the rear of}} the building. There is also an open well at the northwest corner of the building which gives access to ground and first floor from the basement. A <b>goods</b> <b>hoist</b> and beam are suspended below the first floor ceiling. A steep, steel industrial staircase and balustrade connects the three levels.|$|E
60|$|On {{arriving}} at the ship, which was lying in the port of Malamocco, they found {{that she was just}} ready for sailing. The last bales of <b>goods</b> were being <b>hoisted</b> on board, and the sailors were preparing to loosen the sails.|$|R
60|$|Indeed, {{to board}} the Farallone, in that exposed {{position}} where she lay, was an affair of some dexterity. The less precious <b>goods</b> were <b>hoisted</b> roughly; the chronometer, after repeated failures, was passed gently and successfully from hand to hand; and there remained only the more difficult business of embarking Huish. Even that piece of dead weight (shipped A.B. at eighteen dollars, and described by the captain to the consul as an invaluable man) was at last hauled on board without mishap; and the doctor, with civil salutations, took his leave.|$|R
60|$|In some of {{the streets}} the canal was in the centre, {{and there was a}} road way along by the houses on each side. In others there was a road way only on one side, and the walls of the houses and stores rose up {{directly}} from the water's edge on the other. It was curious, in this case, to see the men in the upper stories of these stores, <b>hoisting</b> <b>goods</b> up from the vessels below by means of cranes and tackles projecting from the windows.|$|R
50|$|The {{symmetry}} {{of the building}} is reinforced by equally spaced segmental arch windows on both levels, and ridge ventilators {{at each end of}} the corrugated custom orb profile roof. Internally, the upper floor is dominated by Queen Post trusses which meet at the gable crossing with cruciform trusses. Along each end of the bottom chord are support rails with rope eyelets for suspension of tarpaulins. The original windlass is supported at the centre trusses for <b>hoisting</b> <b>goods</b> to and from the upper and lower levels through a timber trapdoor.|$|R
5000|$|In shipping, cargo {{lift nets}} {{are used to}} load and unload cargo. The net is spread out by stevedores, who load the goods onto it. They then attach the cinches to a crane hook. Lifting the hook draws {{the corners of the}} net around the cargo. This results in a {{balanced}} and secure load which can be safely <b>hoisted.</b> <b>Goods</b> are transferred {{from one place to another}} in the construction industry using cargo nets. When used to transfer cargo by helicopter, they are referred to as [...] "underslung" [...] cargo nets.|$|R
500|$|The GWR built a [...] goods shed on {{the north}} side of the station {{adjacent}} to the Floating Harbour, with a small dock for transhipment of goods to barges (not seagoing ships, as the wharf was upstream of Bristol Bridge). Wagons had to be lowered [...] to the <b>goods</b> shed on <b>hoists.</b> On 11 March 1872, a direct connection to the harbour was made in the form of the Bristol Harbour Railway, a joint operation of the three railways, which ran between the passenger station and the goods yard, across the street outside on a bridge, and descended into a tunnel under the churchyard of St. Mary Redcliffe on its way to a wharf downstream of Bristol Bridge.|$|R
50|$|The {{second floor}} was {{partitioned}} by three masonry walls with archway access between, {{and served as}} showrooms. The third storey contained a single, undivided space utilised as the packing and unpacking department. There were three rear doors on {{the second and third}} levels, and American lifts were installed to permit <b>goods</b> to be <b>hoisted</b> to or from the back yard. A shed and workshop, fitted with machinery and racks, was located {{at the rear of the}} yard - (this structure was two-storeyed by 1918, and probably by 1913) - and along the northern wall of the yard were out-offices and a three-stalled stables. In October 1887, a month before they opened, Watson Brothers advertised half to two-thirds of the building for lease. In subsequent years the firm occupied the entire warehouse.|$|R
50|$|Niemans {{questions}} Fanny Ferreira (Nadia Far√®s), a glaciologist and student, who {{is immediately}} suspect {{because of her}} climbing ability. Despite her contempt for the school and its arrogant professors, she works for the university to steer away frequent avalanches, and is incensed when Niemans implies she might withhold evidence to protect the school. She tells him that anyone with <b>good</b> equipment could've <b>hoisted</b> the body up the cliff, and brushes off his obvious attraction. Soon after, the pathologist reports that it was acid rain in Callois' eye sockets, which has not fallen in the area since the seventies. Niemans enlists Fanny to take him up the glacier to get ice samples to compare with the acid rain in Callois' eyes. On a hunch, Niemans follows a glacial melt tunnel to a cave that contains a second body, frozen into the ice.|$|R
60|$|I {{found the}} children's {{hospital}} established {{in an old}} sail-loft or storehouse, of the roughest nature, and on the simplest means. There were trap-doors in the floors, where <b>goods</b> had been <b>hoisted</b> up and down; heavy feet and heavy weights had started every knot in the well-trodden planking: inconvenient bulks and beams and awkward staircases perplexed my passage through the wards. But I found it airy, sweet, and clean. In its seven and thirty beds I saw but little beauty; for starvation in {{the second or third}} generation takes a pinched look: but I saw the sufferings both of infancy and childhood tenderly assuaged; I heard the little patients answering to pet playful names, the light touch of a delicate lady laid bare the wasted sticks of arms for me to pity; and the claw-like little hands, as she did so, twined themselves lovingly around her wedding-ring.|$|R
50|$|The link from Newport to Wappenshalll was crossed by a towpath bridge {{immediately}} before the junction. This {{is still in}} situ, and is a grade II listed structure. Nearby is a three-storey dock warehouse, which straddles {{a section of the}} canal. The first floor includes trap doors, which allowed <b>goods</b> to be <b>hoisted</b> up from the canal boats into the warehouse. It is also listed, and was built by George Sutherland-Leveson-Gower, the Earl of Sutherland, rather than the canal company, as was the basin. The Sutherland Estate also built a fine office for the canal toll clerk. It is a two-storey building, constructed of red bricks, with a central half-octagonal bay containing three sets of windows. A small community developed around the junction, as several cottages and the Sutherland Arms public house were built close by. The building is now called Bridge House, and it was rented to John Tranier when it was first opened.|$|R
