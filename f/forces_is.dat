5|$|Attempting to {{list the}} {{equipment}} available to the DRC's land <b>forces</b> <b>is</b> difficult; most figures are unreliable estimates based on known items delivered in the past. The IISS's Military Balance 2007 and Orbat.com's Concise World Armies 2005 give only slightly differing figures however (the figures below are from the IISS Military Balance 2007). Much of the Army's equipment is non-operational due to insufficient maintenance—in 2002 only 20 percent of the Army's armoured vehicles were estimated as being serviceable.|$|E

5000|$|President Ronald Reagan in 1985 said [...] "the <b>Force</b> <b>is</b> with us", {{referring}} to the United States, to create the Strategic Defense Initiative. The Gospel According to Star Wars asserts that {{his use of the}} phrase was actually perverting Star Wars's [...] "self-dispossessing" [...] (or other-focused) ethos. The blessing [...] "May the <b>Force</b> <b>be</b> with you" [...] is the expression of a hope for others ("May the <b>Force</b> <b>be</b> with you"), not for ourselves as with Reagan ("The <b>Force</b> <b>is</b> with us"). Moreover, the Star Wars blessing is precisely a request for hope for others ("May the <b>Force</b> <b>be</b> with you"), whereas Reagan's claim sounds like a possessive assertion ("The <b>Force</b> <b>is</b> with us").|$|R
5|$|CFB Winnipeg is a Canadian Forces Base at the Winnipeg International Airport. The base is home {{to flight}} {{operations}} support divisions and several training schools, {{as well as the}} 1 Canadian Air Division and Canadian NORAD Region Headquarters. 17 Wing of the Canadian <b>Forces</b> <b>is</b> based at CFB Winnipeg; the Wing has three squadrons and six schools. It supports 113 units from Thunder Bay to the Saskatchewan/Alberta border, and from the 49th parallel north to the high Arctic. 17 Wing acts as a deployed operating base for CF-18 Hornet fighter–bombers assigned to the Canadian NORAD Region.|$|E
5|$|Dark <b>Forces</b> <b>is</b> a first-person shooter (FPS). The player {{controls}} Kyle Katarn from a first-person perspective, with a {{focus on}} combat against various creatures and characters from the Star Wars universe, although the game also includes environmental puzzles and hazards. Dark Forces follows a central storyline outlined in mission briefings and cutscenes. Each mission includes specific objectives which are related to the story. The missions take place in a variety of environments across the Star Wars universe, including a Star Destroyer interior, Jabba the Hutt's space yacht, and the planet Coruscant, where the player must infiltrate a computer vault.|$|E

On a custom built bicycle with spring-loaded outriggers that exactly cancel this couple, so that the bicycle and rider may assume any lean angle when traveling in a straight line, riders find it impossible to make a turn. As soon as the wheels deviate from a straight path, the bicycle and rider begin to lean in the opposite direction, {{and the only way to}} right them is to steer back onto the straight path.|$|E

5|$|Market <b>Forces</b> <b>is</b> {{a science}} fiction thriller novel by Richard Morgan. Set in 2049, the story follows Chris Faulkner as he starts his new job as a junior {{executive}} at Shorn Associates, working in their Conflict Investment division where the company supports foreign governments {{in exchange for a}} percentage of the country's gross domestic product. Contracts are awarded, and promotions are given to employees, through driving duels in which combatants race vehicles on empty roads and often kill their opponents. With the Shorn-supported Colombian dictator Echevarria expected to transfer power to his son, who is supported by a competing firm, Chris allies Shorn with a rebel group to overthrow the government, though other executives attempt to sabotage his plans.|$|E
5|$|Since {{forces are}} {{perceived}} as pushes or pulls, this can provide an intuitive understanding for describing forces. As with other physical concepts (e.g. temperature), the intuitive understanding of <b>forces</b> <b>is</b> quantified using precise operational definitions {{that are consistent with}} direct observations and compared to a standard measurement scale. Through experimentation, it is determined that laboratory measurements of forces are fully consistent with the conceptual definition of force offered by Newtonian mechanics.|$|E

The device {{has been used in}} experiment and the typical signal of jet impact <b>force</b> <b>was</b> obtained. The variational characteristic of the <b>force</b> with time <b>was</b> given. The result shows that during the experiment the target material sustains three forces. In order of time, the first <b>force</b> <b>is</b> the laser ablation force, and the other two <b>forces</b> <b>are</b> jet impact <b>forces.</b> The first jet impact <b>force</b> <b>is</b> greater than the ablation force and the second jet impact <b>force</b> <b>is</b> smaller than the first jet impact force...|$|R

The CS spray used by UK police is generally more concentrated than that used by American police forces (5% vs 1%). The liquid stream is directed where the user points the canister, being accurate up to 4 metres. They are also trained in helping the incapacitated person recover once successfully restrained.|$|E
5|$|The {{connection}} between macroscopic nonconservative forces and microscopic conservative <b>forces</b> <b>is</b> described by detailed treatment with statistical mechanics. In macroscopic closed systems, nonconservative forces act {{to change the}} internal energies of the system, and are often associated with the transfer of heat. According to the Second law of thermodynamics, nonconservative forces necessarily result in energy transformations within closed systems from ordered to more random conditions as entropy increases.|$|E

This force included hundreds of cavalry with chain armour. Trunajaya also built fortifications along the Brantas (Kediri is on the east bank of this river), and his artillery generally outgunned the loyalists.|$|E

50|$|<b>Force</b> <b>is</b> {{the action}} of one body on another. A <b>force</b> <b>is</b> either a push or a pull. A force tends to move a body in the {{direction}} of its action. The action of a <b>force</b> <b>is</b> characterized by its magnitude, by the direction of its action, and by its point of application. Thus, <b>force</b> <b>is</b> a vector quantity, because its effect depends on the direction {{as well as on the}} magnitude of the action.|$|R

5|$|Under federal law, the {{drinking}} age for the Armed <b>Forces</b> <b>is</b> {{the same as}} the state or nation where the military base is located, or {{the drinking}} age of a state or nation within 50 miles of the base. Effectively, that restricts the purchase of alcohol at New Jersey military bases to those over 21. Irrespective of state laws on underage consumption, the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard prohibit the consumption of alcohol by underage personnel when stationed in the United States. Marines under 21 are permitted to drink alcohol at U.S. bases on special occasions.|$|E
5|$|Ziyadat Allah's {{council was}} divided over the issue, {{but in the}} end the exhortations of the {{respected}} qadi of Kairouan, Asad ibn al-Furat, who used quotations from the Quran to support his case, swayed them. Asad was placed {{at the head of the}} expedition even while retaining his office of qadi, normally incompatible with a military post. The Muslim expeditionary <b>forces</b> <b>is</b> said to have consisted of ten thousand foot soldiers and seven hundred cavalry, mostly Ifriqiyan Arabs and Berbers, but possibly also some Khurasanis. The fleet comprised seventy or a hundred ships, to which were added Euphemius' own vessels.|$|E
5|$|As well {{as being}} added, forces can also be {{resolved}} into independent components {{at right angles to}} each other. A horizontal force pointing northeast can therefore be split into two forces, one pointing north, and one pointing east. Summing these component forces using vector addition yields the original force. Resolving force vectors into components of a set of basis vectors is often a more mathematically clean way to describe forces than using magnitudes and directions. This is because, for orthogonal components, the components of the vector sum are uniquely determined by the scalar addition of the components of the individual vectors. Orthogonal components are independent of each other because forces acting at ninety degrees to each other have no effect on the magnitude or direction of the other. Choosing a set of orthogonal basis vectors is often done by considering what set of basis vectors will make the mathematics most convenient. Choosing a basis vector that is {{in the same direction as}} one of the <b>forces</b> <b>is</b> desirable, since that force would then have only one non-zero component. Orthogonal force vectors can be three-dimensional with the third component being at right-angles to the other two.|$|E

5|$|Human {{rights in}} Madagascar are {{protected}} {{under the constitution}} and the state is a signatory to numerous international agreements including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Religious, ethnic and sexual minorities are protected under the law. Freedom of association and assembly are also guaranteed under the law, although in practice the denial of permits for public assembly has occasionally been used to impede political demonstrations. Torture by security <b>forces</b> <b>is</b> rare and state repression is low relative to other countries with comparably few legal safeguards, although arbitrary arrests and the corruption of military and police officers remain problems. Ravalomanana's 2004 creation of BIANCO, an anti-corruption bureau, resulted in reduced corruption among Antananarivo's lower-level bureaucrats in particular, although high-level officials have not been prosecuted by the bureau.|$|E
5|$|In peacetime, the {{commander}} of the land <b>forces</b> <b>is</b> the minister of defense, while in wartime, the President of Romania becomes the supreme commander of the armed forces. The main combat formations of Romania are the 2nd Infantry Division Getica, and the 4th Infantry Division Gemina. Until 2015 the Romanian land forces fielded a third division, namely the 1st Division Dacia. Before June 2008, the 1st and 4th divisions were known as the 1st Territorial Army Corps and the 4th Territorial Army Corps and in turn they used to be called the 1st Army and 4th Army prior to 2000. However due to their personnel having been reduced considerably in order to reach compatibility with NATO standards they were renamed and reorganized as divisions. In 2010, the Joint HQ command was renamed as 2nd Infantry Division Getica and received units from the 1st and the 4th Infantry divisions.|$|E
5|$|Market <b>Forces</b> <b>is</b> a science-fiction thriller set nearly {{fifty years}} after its writing {{featuring}} a protagonist who fights lethal battles to win contracts for his company and to retain his position within the company. While the story is fictional, the author included a bibliography section that informed the story's satire of globalisation and modern corporate practices. Morgan extrapolates trends in free market capitalism out fifty years {{to a point where}} corporations are unfettered by domestic governments. It is a dystopian vision where large corporations constantly battle to rule entire countries using humans as pawns. The protagonist, Chris Faulkner, {{can be viewed as a}} personification of the story's take on the development of its economic system; the character is written to be likeable but becomes increasing brutal as he invests himself deeper into the corporate culture.|$|E
