50|$|In fluid dynamics, drag (sometimes called air resistance, {{a type of}} {{friction}}, or <b>fluid</b> <b>resistance,</b> {{another type}} of friction or fluid friction) is a force acting opposite to the relative motion of any object moving {{with respect to a}} surrounding fluid. This can exist between two fluid layers (or surfaces) or a fluid and a solid surface. Unlike other resistive forces, such as dry friction, which are nearly independent of velocity, drag forces depend on velocity.Drag force is proportional to the velocity for a laminar flow and the squared velocity for a turbulent flow. Even though the ultimate cause of a drag is viscous friction, the turbulent drag is independent of viscosity.|$|E

40|$|As small {{waterplane}} area twin hull (SWATH) has excellent seakeeping {{performance and}} low wave resistance, this structure {{has been applied}} to unmanned surface vehicle (USV). However, with the increase of speed, <b>fluid</b> <b>resistances</b> will increase exponentially because of its large wet surface. A way to improve this situation is to reduce the depth of draft at high speed, so that all or a part of the volume of the submerged bodies is above the surface of water. Based on this idea, a new type of SWATH USV is designed in this paper. The two submerged bodies of the USV have a planing boat shape. At high speed, hydrodynamic lift force generated by the submerged bodies of the USV can push most part of the submerged bodies out of water, which can greatly reduce the resistance of the USV. In this paper, computational fluid dynamic (CFD) method is used to analyze the attitude and resistance of the USV at different speed, showing that the designed USV can achieve the expected movement characteristics and low resistance at high speed. <br type="_moz" /...|$|R

40|$|Researchers {{have studied}} the {{behaviours}} of generalist swimmers for decades with aim to develop more agile and efficient robotic swimmers. The high efficiency of subcarangiform swimming motion in particular is postulated to {{be a result of}} the ability of the muscles and other elastic tissues to passively transmit an undulatory wave, generated in the pre-caudal region, posteriorly through the caudal region (Blight, 1977; Wassersug and Von Seckendorff Hoff, 1985). Wassersug and Von Seckendorff Hoff (1985) and Liao (2004) have shown that even the bodies of dead fish are able to produce thrust in certain circumstances because of the stiffness properties inherent in their bodies. This passive transmission of an undulatory wave through natural energy storage mechanisms suggests that the high efficiencies exhibited in biological swimmers may be both internal forces and external forces using calculated values of the drag and added mass based on the literature. Physical and theoretical models with the same lengths, masses, stiffnesses, damping and drag characteristics are tested at the same angular amplitude and frequency of oscillations. Comparisons between the performances of the theoretical and analogous physical models are used to validate the theoretical models. The theoretical model without <b>fluid</b> <b>resistance</b> is proven accurate in its ability to predict the undulatory amplitude (UA) of its physical analogue within ± 5 %. The performance of the model with <b>fluid</b> <b>resistance</b> shows that the effect of <b>fluid</b> <b>resistance</b> is overestimated. <b>Fluid</b> <b>resistance</b> in the physical experiments reduced the undulatory amplitude by 35. 7 % on average. In the numerical simulations, <b>fluid</b> <b>resistance</b> was calculated to reduce the undulatory amplitude 59. 4 %. However the calculated relative response at resonance was observed to increase dramatically, underscoring the importance of tuning the oscillatory properties in the presence of <b>fluid</b> <b>resistance.</b> An abridged system identification process is adopted to explore the numerical relationships of certain parameters to the movement of the body. This reveals the likely causes for the overestimation: the added mass is currently underestimated; the estimated drag force is currently overestimated; the stiffness value is underestimated in water. Changing these values would increase the calculated TBA with <b>fluid</b> <b>resistance.</b> One could carry out the full system identification process on the model to determine a set of parameters which replicate this set of experiments but there is no value in doing so until the stiffness and dissipation coefficients are more accurately accounted for and the flow around the physical model is incorporated into the model. In summary, this thesis has derived and validated a theoretical model which accurately predicts the motion of linked segment models without <b>fluid</b> <b>resistance</b> as a series of linked harmonic oscillators. The incorporation of fluid dynamics into the model caused noticeable changes in the frequency response of the system as well as greatly decreased the calculated undulatory amplitude. Based on numerical analysis, likely causes for the misrepresentation of the fluid dynamics are identified. Recommendations are made for improvements of the model with <b>fluid</b> <b>resistance</b> which will make it a valuable tool in the design of AUVs. achieved in man-made propulsion mechanisms by tuning their stiffness properties. The literature review of this study outlines findings from previous research into the modes of swimming, swimming behaviours and the forces present on the body of a fish as it propels itself. From this, it is shown that the stiffness properties of the bodies of real fish are highly specialised swimming modes. Previous studies in robotics have focused on creating biomimetic autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) with anteriorly placed actuators which generate a wave to be transmitted {{through the rest of the}} tail passively. The current studies identify flexible continuous beam models and linked segment structures as two leading biomimetic designs for such robots. In the literature review it is shown that linked segment structures hold a considerable advantage in imitating kinematics and are thus a promising avenue for progressing the understanding of how fish achieve such high levels of efficiency. It is shown that the undulatory wave travelling along the swimming fish body can be approximated as a series of finite heaving linked segments (Lighthill, 1969) connected by flexible joints (Hebrank, 1982; Bowtell and Williams, 1991). This study builds and validates two theoretical models, derived from kinematics and hydrodynamic principles outlined in the literature review, for tuning the oscillatory properties of linked segment systems. The first theoretical model accounts for only the internal forces of the mechanism by neglecting <b>fluid</b> <b>resistance.</b> The second theoretical model incorporate...|$|E

A particle with a higher restitution bounces forward and backward repeatedly, whereas a particle with a lower restitution only bounces forward, because the higher bounce height increases the impulse exerted on the particle during a collision, which induces a drastic change in the horizontal velocity from the collision.

The calculated viscosity of water at different temperatures was comparable to reported values. The activation energy of viscous flow (Ea) of the different solutions was calculated and followed a similar trend as that for the viscosities of solutions of various concentrations. This experiment allowed students to better understand and explain the behaviour of macromolecules with respect to changing concentration and temperature. Furthermore, students correlated the viscosity and Ea results to understand how an increase in the concentration of a polymer solution resulted in increased entanglement of the polymer chains, consequently leading to an increase in viscosity and an increase in the activation energy of viscous flow.
