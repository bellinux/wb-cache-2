50|$|Aspirin {{inhibits}} {{platelet aggregation}} and formation of blood clots. It is effective {{across the entire}} spectrum of acute coronary syndromes, and it actually {{has been shown to}} reduce the rate of death <b>in</b> <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>STEMI</b> and in patients presenting without ST elevation. Aspirin is contraindicated in patients with documented allergy or known platelet disorder. Patients who have had long gastrointestinal symptoms while on long-term aspirin therapy are usually able to tolerate aspirin in the short term. For patients with true intolerance to aspirin clopidogrel is recommended. Lower doses need days to achieve full antiplatelet effect, therefore a loading dose is necessary for patients who are not already on aspirin.|$|E

40|$|Patients with ST-segment {{elevation}} {{myocardial infarction}} (STEMI) require immediate reperfusion therapy {{in order to}} salvage ischemic myocardial tissue and reduce mortality. Reperfusion therapy can be provided mechanically with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), or pharmacologically with fibrinolysis. Regardless of the reperfusion strategy selected, the appropri-ate use of anticoagulant therapy is critical to its success.

40|$|Background Primary {{percutaneous}} coronary intervention (PCI) reduces {{mortality in}} patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) complicated by cardiogenic shock (CS). Despite PCI, mortality in CS is still approximately 50 %. Admission glucose concentration is an independent predictor of mortality <b>in</b> <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>STEMI</b> and {{is associated with the}} occurrence of CS. Whether admission glucose is also a predictor of mortality in CS patients treated with primary PCI is unexplored. We therefore assessed the relation between admission glucose concentration and 1 -year mortality <b>in</b> <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>STEMI</b> with CS without a prior diagnosis of diabetes on admission and treated with PCI. Methods We investigated a cohort of 208 consecutive patients with STEMI without a prior diagnosis of diabetes with CS on admission. Patients were classified according to glucose levels at admission: 11. 0 mmol/L (group 3, n = 80). Results The overall 1 -year mortality was 38 %. One-year mortality was 21 %, 27 %, and 60 % in groups 1, 11, and 111, respectively (P <. 001). In a multivariate logistic regression analysis, the odds for Mortality increased by 16 % for every I mmol/L increase in plasma glucose concentration (OR 1. 155, 95 % Cl 1. 070 - 1. 247), after adjustment for left ventricular ejection fraction < 40 %, age older than 75 years, male sex, and thrombolysis in myocardial infarction 3 flow after PCI. Conclusions <b>in</b> <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>STEMI</b> with CS and without a prior diagnosis of diabetes undergoing primary PCI, admission glucose concentration is a very strong independent predictor for 1 -year mortality.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundPrevious {{studies have}} {{reported}} diffuse destabilization of atherosclerotic plaques in acute myocardial infarction (AMI). We used intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) to assess coronary culprit lesions in ST segment elevation MI (STEMI) vs. in non-ST segment elevation MI (NSTEMI). MethodsPatient population comprised 125 STEMI and 185 NSTEMI patients. IVUS findings included ruptured plaque (a cavity that communicated with the lumen with an overlying residual fibrous cap fragment), lipid-pool like image (a pooling of hypoechoic or echolucent material covered with a hyperechoic layer), thrombus (discrete intraluminal filling defects), and plaque prolapse (tissue extrusion through the stent strut at post-stenting). ResultsCulprit lesions had larger external elastic membrane area (13. 5 ± 4. 9 mm 2 vs. 11. 9 ± 4. 3 mm 2, p= 0. 002), larger plaque plus media area (10. 8 ± 4. 4 mm 2 vs. 9. 1 ± 4. 1 mm 2, p= 0. 001), and greater plaque burden (78. 7 ± 10. 1 % vs. 74. 8 ± 12. 0 %, p= 0. 002), and smaller culprit lesion site calcium arc (96 ± 90 ° vs. 153 ± 114 °, p= 0. 002) <b>in</b> <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>STEMI</b> than in those with NSTEMI. Culprit lesion plaque ruptures, lipid-pool like images, and thrombus were observed more frequently <b>in</b> <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>STEMI</b> than in those with NSTEMI (46 % vs. 29 %, p= 0. 002; 39 % vs. 25 %, p= 0. 010; and 34 % vs. 21 %, p= 0. 006, respectively). Culprit lesions were more predominantly hypoechoic <b>in</b> <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>STEMI</b> than in those with NSTEMI (62 % vs. 40 %, p< 0. 001).

Results: NT-proBNP concentration measured in STEMI acute phase was significantly higher {{in comparison with the}} value measured one year later (1833 pg/ml: 419 pg/ml, p < 0. 001). NT-proBNP was significantly higher <b>in</b> <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> anterior <b>STEMI</b> (n = 15) compared <b>with</b> the <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> inferior <b>STEMI</b> (n = 20) in acute phase and one year later. <b>In</b> <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> inferior <b>STEMI</b> a mean NT-proBNP value one year after infarction was below the limit values of 300 pg/ml (236 pg/ml).

Background The relative safety of DES and BMS <b>in</b> <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>STEMI</b> continues to be debated, and whether advances {{have been made in}} this regard with second-generation DES is unknown. Methods Randomized controlled trials comparing currently U.

Information on study design, inclusion and exclusion criteria, sample characteristics, and clinical outcomes was extracted. Results Twenty-two trials including 12, 453 randomized patients were analyzed. At 1 -year follow-up, cobalt-chromium everolimus eluting stents (CoCr-EES) were associated with significantly lower rates of cardiac death or myocardial infarction (MI) and stent thrombosis (ST) than BMS. Differences in ST were apparent as early as 30 days and were maintained for 2 years. CoCr-EES were also associated with significantly lower rates of 1 -year ST than paclitaxel-eluting stents (PES). Sirolimus-eluting stents (SES) were also associated with significantly lower rates of 1 -year cardiac death/myocardial infarction than BMS. CoCr-EES, PES, and SES, but not zotarolimus-eluting stents, had significantly lower rates of 1 -year target vessel revascularization (TVR) than BMS, with SES also showing lower rates of TVR than PES.

However, its impact over the results of reperfusion therapies <b>in</b> <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>STEMI</b> is still a matter of controversy. Aim: To determine the impact of admission hyperglycemia on hospital and long term mortality, according to the method of reper-fusion utilized <b>in</b> <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>STEMI.</b> Material and Methods: Prospective registry of 1, 634 consecutive patients aged 60 ± 12 years (77 % male), from 3 participating hospitals in the Chilean Registry of Myocardial Infarction (GEMI). We evaluated demographic, clinical and laboratory variables, reperfusion method used, hospital and long term mortality. The impact of hyperglycemia on hospital and long term mortality was evaluated by a logistic regression analysis and Cox risk, respectively, adjusted by Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) risk score. Results: Twenty four percent of patients were diabetics and in 45 %, the infarct was located on the anterior wall. The mean TIMI risk score was 3. 2 ± 2. 4. Hyperglycemia at entry was associated to a greater hospital and long term mortality, independently of the reperfusion strategy utilized. Primary angioplasty was associated to a greater benefit, compared to thrombolysis among hyperglycemic patients with an odds ratio: 2. 9, 95 % confi dence intervals: 1. 0 - 8. 0 and a hazard ratio of 2. 9, 95 % confi dence intervals: 1. 44 - 5. 88, independently of a previous history of diabetes mellitus and TIMI risk score. Conclusions: <b>In</b> <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>STEMI,</b> admission hyperglycemia {{is associated with a}} worse prognosis which was significantly improved with primary angioplasty compared to thrombolysis, independently of the admission TIMI risk score...|$|E

The aim {{of the study was}} to determine wheather laboratory monitoring of antiaggregation therapy helps to improve the management of <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> acute <b>STEMI.</b> Material and methodsA pilot prospective study <b>in</b> <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> acute <b>STEMI</b> treated <b>with</b> direct percutaneous coronary intervention (dPCI) of culprit lession. Optic aggregometry was chosen to assess the effectivity of antiaggregation treatment. Samples were taken prior to coronarography (sample 1) as well as at first day after diagnostic procedure (sample 2). MACE (in-stent trombosis, heart failure, in hospital death, all cases mortality, ventricular arrhytmia, needs of repeat revascularization) were sequently monitored. Study group included 22 patients (average age 66 years, 11 men, 11 women), from whom 14 had recieved clopidogrel loding dose and 8 had recieved prasugrel loding dose. ResultsIn clopidogrel group 11 patients did not reach effective drug activity in first sample and 3 patients did not reach effective drug activity in second sample. While in prasugrel group ineffective antiaggregation was seen just <b>in</b> 1 <b>patient</b> <b>in</b> first sample. <b>In</b> <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> clopidogrel treatment more MACE developed in followed period (13 vs. 6). ConclusionOur results show that optic aggregometry seems to be a usefull laboratory method for antiaggregation drugs effectivity assessment.

40|$|AbstractObjectivesThe aim of {{this study}} was to examine whether manual {{thrombus}} aspiration reduces microvascular obstruction assessed by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) presenting late after symptom onset. BackgroundThrombus aspiration is an established treatment option <b>in</b> <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>STEMI</b> undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). However, there are only limited data on the efficacy of thrombus aspiration <b>in</b> <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>STEMI</b> presenting ≥ 12 h after symptom onset. MethodsPatients with subacute STEMI presenting ≥ 12 and ≤ 48 h after symptom onset were randomized to primary PCI with or without manual thrombus aspiration in a 1 : 1 ratio. Patients underwent cardiac magnetic resonance imaging 1  to 4 days after randomization. The primary endpoint was the extent of microvascular obstruction. ResultsA total of 152 patients underwent randomization. The mean time between symptom onset and PCI was 28  ±  12 h. Baseline characteristics were comparable between groups. The majority of patients (60 %) showed at least a moderate amount of viable myocardium in the affected region. Extent of microvascular obstruction was not significantly different between patients assigned to thrombus aspiration and the control group (2. 5 ± 4. 0 % vs. 3. 1 ± 4. 4 % of left ventricular mass, p = 0. 47). There were also no significant differences in infarct size, myocardial salvage, left ventricular ejection fraction, and angiographic and clinical endpoints between groups. ConclusionsIn this first randomized trial of thrombectomy <b>in</b> <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>STEMI</b> presenting late after symptom onset, routine thrombus aspiration before PCI failed to show a benefit for markers of reperfusion success.

To {{review the}} {{currently}} available data {{to investigate the}} clinical benefit of high- and low-dose glucose-insulin-potassium (GIK) in patients with ST-segment elevation acute myocardial infarction (STEMI). Design. Quantitative analysis of all randomised trials on GIK <b>in</b> <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>STEMI.</b> Electronic and manual searches for randomised controlled trials of GIK in STEMI were performed with regard to inclusion criteria, dose of GIK and additional use of reperfusion therapy, and a meta-analysis with the primary endpoint 30 -day mortality was performed. Patients. Data from 16 randomised trials, involving 26, 273 patients, were included. Results. Studies were conducted between 1962 and 2005. Overall, hospital mortality was 9. 6 % after GIK compared with 10. 2 % in controls (p= 0. 088). GIK infusion {{was not associated with}} an increase in major adverse events. Conclusion.

40|$|Introduction: Although {{percutaneous}} coronary {{intervention is}} an accepted "first-line" therapy in acute ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in general population, few {{data are available}} on the short- and long-term outcomes of very old patients (age > 90 years). Our aim is to evaluate and compare the short and long-term outcomes after primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) or medical therapy <b>in</b> nonagenarian <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>STEMI.</b> Methods: We retrospectively identified patients older than 90 years old in our clinic, <b>with</b> acute <b>STEMI</b> who presented within 12 hours after symptoms onset, either underwent PPCI or medically treated. In hospital events and long-term results analyzed subsequently. Results: From January 2005 to December 2014, 73 <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>STEMI</b> either underwent PPCI (PPCI group n =  42) or had only medical treatment (Non-PPCI group n =  31). Mean age was 92. 4  ±   3. 1 (90 - 106). Patients were followed 26. 5  ±  20. 1 months. Recurrent myocardial infarction during hospitalization was not observed in both groups. In-hospital mortality, cerebrovascular events and acute renal failure rate were similar between two groups (respectively P = 0. 797 and P = 1. 000, P = 0. 288), whereas arrhythmia was significantly higher in the PPCI group (0; 21. 4 %, P = 0. 009). Results show re-infarction was similar in both groups (respectively 3. 2 %; 11. 9 %, P = 0. 382) but mortality in long-term was significantly lower in the PPCI group (respectively 40. 9 %; 12. 9 %, P = 0. 02). Conclusion: <b>In</b> nonagenarian <b>patients,</b> <b>with</b> <b>STEMI</b> mortality is very high.

40|$|Background: Although intracoronary {{abciximab}} {{failed to}} improve prognosis compared with intravenous route in unselected ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients, {{little is known}} about the role of intracoronary abciximab <b>in</b> diabetic <b>patients.</b> Objectives: To evaluate the efficacy of intracoronary abciximab administration <b>in</b> diabetic <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>STEMI</b> undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Methods: Reperfusional and clinical outcomes of intracoronary abciximab compared with intravenous bolus abciximab according to diabetic status were evaluated in a pooled analysis of five randomized trials including 3158 STEMI patients. The primary clinical endpoint of the study was the composite of death or reinfarction at 30 -day follow-up. Results: Among 584 diabetic patients (18. 5 %), the composite of death or reinfarction was significantly reduced with intracoronary abciximab compared to intravenous abciximab (4. 7 % vs. 8. 8 %; rate ratio [RR], 0. 50; 95 % confidence intervals [CI], 0. 26 - 0. 99; p = 0. 04), driven by numerically lower deaths (3. 7 % vs. 6. 4 %; RR, 0. 56; 95 % CI, 0. 26 - 1. 20; p = 0. 13). Moreover, a significant reduction in definite or probable stent thrombosis was observed <b>in</b> <b>patients</b> receiving intracoronary abciximab (1 % vs. 3. 5 %; RR, 0. 27; 95 % CI, 0. 07 - 0. 99; p = 0. 04). Although formal tests for interaction were not significant, no clinical benefit was apparent in the cohort of STEMI patients without diabetes (n = 2574). Conclusions: <b>In</b> diabetic <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>STEMI</b> undergoing primary PCI, intracoronary abciximab may improve clinical outcomes as compared with standard intravenous use. These findings require confirmation in a dedicated randomized trial. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundInflammation plays a {{significant}} role in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). There may be similar inflammatory changes <b>in</b> non-DM <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> ST elevation myocardial infarction (<b>STEMI)</b> and DM <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> stable angina (SA), and DM <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>STEMI</b> may have more severe changes than the former two groups. The objectives of this study were to investigate whether the level of inflammation was similar <b>in</b> <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> non-DM <b>STEMI</b> and DM SA, and to evaluate whether the changes in the level of inflammation were more severe <b>in</b> <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> DM <b>STEMI</b> compared to the other two groups. Methods and resultsA variety of inflammatory markers including: highly sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), interleukin- 6 (IL- 6), IL- 18, vascular cell adhesion molecule- 1 (VCAM- 1), and matrix metallopeptidase- 9 (MMP- 9) as well as insulin resistance were compared among the three groups: DM STEMI (90 patients), DM SA (91 patients), and non-DM STEMI (76 patients). Inflammatory marker levels were not significantly different between the DM SA and non-DM STEMI groups. However, hsCRP and IL- 6 were increased in the DM STEMI compared to the DM SA patients (p= 0. 005 and p= 0. 004, respectively). In addition, hsCRP, ESR, and IL- 18 were increased in the DM STEMI compared to the non-DM STEMI patients (p= 0. 017, p= 0. 020, and p= 0. 033, respectively). Furthermore, the fasting insulin and the homeostasis model assessment were significantly increased in the DM STEMI compared to the DM SA patients (p= 0. 04 and p= 0. 004, respectively). ConclusionsDM SA and non-DM STEMI may have similar inflammatory changes. DM STEMI may be a more severe inflammatory condition compared to <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> DM SA or non-DM STEMI...|$|R
