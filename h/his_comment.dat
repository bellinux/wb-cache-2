5|$|By then, {{there was}} already a {{movement}} within the Army General Staff to have Matsui removed from his post. Reports of the atrocities in Nanking had reached the Japanese government and some within the Army General Staff blamed Matsui for mishandling the crisis and causing Japan international embarrassment. Some even wanted him court-martialed for negligence. Even so, the Japanese government was not planning on dismissing Matsui solely because of the Nanking Massacre. The Foreign Ministry was displeased by anti-Western statements Matsui had made after becoming CCAA commander, including <b>his</b> <b>comment</b> {{that he did not}} recognize the neutrality of foreign concessions in Shanghai, and the Army General Staff was concerned about Matsui's severe personality conflicts with his subordinate commanders, which were interfering with the chain of command. The Army Minister Hajime Sugiyama told General Shunroku Hata that the inability of Matsui and his subordinates to coordinate and cooperate with one another was the reason he was being removed.|$|E

25|$|Later in life, Groucho would {{sometimes}} note to talk show hosts, not entirely jokingly, {{that he was}} unable to actually insult anyone, because the target of <b>his</b> <b>comment</b> would assume that it was a Groucho-esque joke, and would laugh.|$|E
25|$|While Hugo Chávez was President of Venezuela at {{the time}} he made <b>his</b> <b>comments,</b> José María Aznar was not head of {{government}} of any nation when he made <b>his</b> <b>comments.</b> Additionally, Hugo Chávez made <b>his</b> <b>comments</b> in public and through broadcasting media, while Aznar's comments were made in a private meeting with PAN members and were not intended for broadcasting.|$|R
50|$|After {{the public}} backlash, Trump stood by <b>his</b> <b>comments,</b> citing news {{articles}} to back his claims. Trump {{said that he}} intended <b>his</b> <b>comments</b> to be aimed solely at the government of Mexico, specifically for using the insecure border {{as a means of}} transferring criminals into the United States and said he did not intend <b>his</b> <b>comments</b> to refer to immigrants themselves.|$|R

25|$|Up to 1930, Kraus {{directed}} his satirical writings to {{figures of the}} center and the left of the political spectrum, as he considered the flaws of the right too self-evident to be worthy of <b>his</b> <b>comment.</b> Later, his responses to the Nazis included The Third Walpurgis Night.|$|E
25|$|The {{evidence}} {{strongly suggests}} that Cantor was quite confident in the result itself and that <b>his</b> <b>comment</b> to Dedekind refers instead to his then-still-lingering concerns {{about the validity of}} his proof of it. Nevertheless, Cantor's remark would also serve nicely to express the surprise that so many mathematicians after him have experienced on first encountering a result that is so counter-intuitive.|$|E
25|$|Forman died of {{dementia}} related issues on 11 May 2017. In {{the last year}} of his life he was reported to have been dismayed by the result of the 2016 Brexit referendum and to have stated that the UK had become a country he hardly knew. However, obituarists drew attention to <b>his</b> <b>comment</b> (quoted above) published thirty years earlier concerning the tendency of the Conservative party to be occasionally swept along in particular ideologies.|$|E
5000|$|<b>His</b> <b>comments,</b> {{including}} the use of the words [...] "rape thing", drew local and national criticism. Koster acknowledged that <b>his</b> <b>comments</b> may have caused him to lose the election in Washington's most competitive district.|$|R

5000|$|Hazan also courted {{controversy}} for <b>his</b> <b>comments</b> about Arabs, stating [...] "The Arabs are worms {{who work}} underground and indiscriminately murder Muslim soldiers." [...] Despite being {{asked by the}} Knesset speaker, he refused to retract <b>his</b> <b>comments.</b>|$|R
25|$|So, {{while the}} name Packer appears {{many times in}} the book, the only serious comment that the writer makes about the whole affair (and he is right in <b>his</b> <b>comment)</b> is ”In one respect, and in only one I think, he (Packer) has done a service to the game by forcing us all to face the fact cricketers have been abysmally ill-paid.” So, as a whole “The Best Loved Game” is not about any {{controversial}} issue, it is simply about cricket being part of the English summer.|$|E
25|$|Haddin was {{involved}} in a controversy relating to the dismissal of Neil Broom in an ODI between Australia and New Zealand in Perth in February 2009. Broom was given out bowled but replays clearly showed that Haddin's gloves had disturbed the bails. New Zealand captain Daniel Vettori expressed his dissatisfaction with Haddin's actions in not calling Broom back to the wicket. <b>His</b> <b>comment</b> led to an angry retort from Australian captain Ricky Ponting. Ponting defended his team mate saying that Haddin was convinced the ball hit the stumps. On 15 February 2009, Haddin became acting Australian captain for the Twenty20 against New Zealand after Ricky Ponting was rested and Michael Clarke was injured.|$|E
25|$|For 18 years Hersey {{also taught}} two writing courses, in fiction and non-fiction, to undergraduates. Hersey taught his last class in fiction writing at Yale during 1984. In his {{individual}} sessions with undergraduates {{to discuss their}} work, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author was sometimes known to write his comments in the margin, and having discussed his suggestion with the student, to then take out his pencil and erase <b>his</b> <b>comment.</b> As Master of Pierson College, he subsequently hosted his old boss Henry Luce– with whom Hersey had become reconciled after their dispute years prior– when Luce spoke to the college's undergraduates. Time founder Luce was a notoriously dull public speaker, and his address to the Pierson undergraduates was no exception. After Luce's somnolent speech, the former publisher privately revealed to Hersey {{for the first time}} that he and his wife Clare Boothe Luce had taken LSD while supervised by a physician. Hersey later confessed he was relieved that Luce had saved that particular revelation for a more private audience.|$|E

2500|$|Osby Davis claimed <b>his</b> <b>comments</b> {{were taken}} out of context. The New York Times {{released}} the interview with Davis. The parts the New York Times did not originally report were portions where Davis compared the LGBT community to thieves, murderers, liars, drug addicts and child molesters. [...] Many within the community saw <b>his</b> <b>comments</b> as divisive and bigoted and demanded that he step down. Many other residents of Vallejo agreed with <b>his</b> <b>comments</b> and offered their full support. Many who opposed <b>his</b> <b>comments</b> felt this showed the supposed intolerance of the LGBT community in Vallejo by the so-called [...] "faith" [...] community. In the next election in November 2011, Osby Davis was re-elected mayor of Vallejo.|$|R
500|$|Eminem's sixth studio album Relapse (2009) {{features}} a song entitled [...] "Bagpipes from Baghdad", with lyrics suggesting that Eminem {{is still in}} love with Carey, and features insulting comments about the singer and her then-husband Nick Cannon. After, Cannon made a post on his website, defending Carey and expressing his disgust at the rapper's comments, Eminem responded to <b>his</b> <b>comment</b> by saying he meant well and that the song is actually [...] "wishing the couple the best", and later noted that he respected Cannon for <b>his</b> <b>comment,</b> expecting him to defend his wife.|$|E

500|$|Also, Guy often {{says things}} that are {{inappropriate}} and sexually explicit and after noticing the reaction from the person to whom he is speaking, follows <b>his</b> <b>comment</b> with [...] "... let me finish" [...] and a clarification.

50|$|Khan later {{clarified}} <b>his</b> <b>comments</b> in January 2016, {{saying that}} he never meant that India was intolerant or he thought about leaving the country. He said that <b>his</b> <b>comments</b> were {{taken out of context}} and the media was responsible for it to some extent.|$|R

5000|$|This led {{allies of}} Wahhab to {{distance}} themselves from <b>his</b> <b>comments.</b> Sunni Muslim protesters yelled [...] "There is no God but Allah", and [...] "Wiam, you pig: you should be chained down".

500|$|NBPA leaders {{met with}} around 30players on October 14 and {{stressed}} unity.

Fisher said McGee had [...] "no ability to make that statement" [...] based on the limited time he spent at the meeting.|$|E
500|$|At Monk's Café, Jerry {{discusses}} {{the situation with}} George and Elaine. They speculate whether <b>his</b> <b>comment</b> {{may have been a}} factor, though both are self-centered: Elaine wonders about her own death, and George urges Jerry to play in the softball game, because he thinks Jerry needs [...] "to play left field", as Jerry's replacement fielder [...] "stinks," [...] and, George adds, [...] "I just don't see what purpose is it gonna serve your going? I mean, you think dead people care who's at their funeral? They don't even know they're having a funeral." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{only other}} {{reference}} to a baptism of Phips is not first-hand but a sardonic reference by Blathwayt (Randolph's boss in London) mentioning Phips being made a general the same year he was [...] "publicly christened at Boston." [...] Expanding the franchise of New England away from {{the control of the}} clergy was one of Blathwayt's obsessions, and <b>his</b> <b>comment</b> probably goes to this point, as well as noting Phips loyalty with New England as opposed to the crown. In short, if something like Cotton Mather's March 23 church scene happened at all, it should be understood as foremost a political event.|$|E

500|$|Edward caused unease in {{government}} circles with actions that were interpreted as interference in political matters. <b>His</b> <b>comment</b> during {{a tour of}} depressed villages in South Wales that [...] "something must be done" [...] for the unemployed coal miners {{was seen as an}} attempt to guide government policy, though it has never been clear what sort of remedy he had in mind. Government ministers were reluctant to send confidential documents and state papers to Fort Belvedere, because it was clear that Edward was paying little attention to them, and it was feared that Simpson and other house guests might read them, improperly or inadvertently disclosing information that could be detrimental to the national interest.|$|E

[...] His Mirror colleague Simon branded Donna supremely unsubtle in her pursuit of Michael, deeming her [...] "unsinkable", and in a later piece for The Guardian, Shelley commented on Donna's proclivity for sleeping with senior staff members at inopportune moments, {{to the detriment of}} patient care. She was dubbed [...] "man crazy" [...] by Tina Miles of the Liverpool Echo, and [...] "shameless" [...] by the Mirror Clare Raymond, who noted that she would [...] "stop at nothing to snare a rich doctor".|$|E
500|$|Some evangelicals criticized Zacharias' {{decision}} not to use this opportunity to directly address the [...] "deep and foundational" [...] differences between the historic Christian faith {{and that of the}} LDS church. He responded by asserting that Christians should not immediately condemn Mormonism's theological differences but [...] "graciously build {{one step at a time}} in communicating our faith with clarity and conviction". He said this is just as effective as showing someone the faults of their faith. The speaking engagement was nearly sabotaged by a claim by event organizer Greg Johnson, president of Standing Together, that Zacharias had nothing to do with editing the book The Kingdom of the Cults and had only loaned his name to the latest edition. Johnson later apologized for <b>his</b> <b>comment.</b>|$|E
