This paper reports {{an increase in the}} heat transfer rate density by using wrinkled <b>entrance</b> <b>regions</b> in ducts with laminar flow. The heat transfer rate density is increased by taking advantage of the presence of relatively isothermal fluid in the <b>entrance</b> <b>regions.</b> In order to stimulate a more complete thermal interaction between walls and fluid, the square entrances are wrinkled on the perimeter, at the one-third and the two-third positions. The new structure has two degrees of freedom. The fluid flow through the ducts is forced by the imposed pressure difference across the duct. Numerical simulations document the effects of the dimensionless pressure drop on the optimized configurations and show a fifteen percent enhancement in heat transfer rate density. vk 201...|$|R

50|$|When {{the fluid}} just enters the pipe, the {{thickness}} of the boundary layer gradually increases from zero moving in the direction of fluid flow and eventually reaches the pipe center and fills the entire pipe. This region from the entrance of pipe {{to the point where the}} boundary layer covers the entire pipe is termed as the hydrodynamic <b>entrance</b> <b>region</b> and length of the pipe in this region is termed as the hydrodynamic entry length. In this region the velocity profile develops and thus the flow is called the hydrodynamically developing flow. After this region, the velocity profile is fully developed and continues unchanged. This region is called the hydrodynamically fully developed region. But this is not the fully developed fluid flow until the normalized temperature profile also becomes constant.|$|E
5000|$|The {{correlations}} for the friction factor in turbulent state {{are based in}} limited data. Increased heat transfer due to the secondary flow is not significant in turbulent state constituting less than 10% for [...] Furthermore, augmentation created {{by the use of}} helically coiled tubes due to the secondary flow is usually employed only for situations where the flow is in the laminar state. In this state, the entrance length is 20% to 50% shorter in comparison with the straight tube. In the case of turbulent flow, the flow becomes fully developed during the first half-turn of the helically coiled tube. For this reason, the <b>entrance</b> <b>region</b> can be neglected in many engineering calculations.If the liquid or gas is heated in a straight tube, the fluid that passes near the centerline, will exit the tube in a much shorter time and will always be cooler than the fluid passing near the wall.|$|E
50|$|The {{hydrodynamic}} <b>entrance</b> <b>region</b> {{refers to}} the area of a pipe where fluid entering a pipe develops a velocity profile due to viscous forces propagating from the interior wall of a pipe. This region is characterized by a non-uniform flow. The fluid enters a pipe at a uniform velocity, then fluid particles in the layer in contact with the surface of the pipe come to a complete stop due to the no-slip condition. Due to viscous forces within the fluid, the layer in contact with the pipe surface resists the motion of adjacent layers and slows adjacent layers of fluid down gradually, forming a velocity profile. For the conservation of mass to hold true, the velocity of layers of the fluid {{in the center of the}} pipe increases to compensate for the reduced velocities of the layers of fluid near the pipe surface. This develops a velocity gradient across the cross section of the pipe.|$|E

The laminar flow is simulated with the commercial Fluent code in an axisymmetric geometry. The discrete ordinates method {{is applied to the}} numerical simulation of radiative heat transfer. The non-gray gas radiative model used is the absorption distribution function (ADF) using high temperature methane radiative properties which were recently published. Several thermal <b>entrance</b> <b>regions</b> of tubular reactors are compared and the influence of methane participation in radiative heat transfer is studied. The results show that the temperature field is significantly influenced by radiation due to methane absorption.

40|$|The time {{mean and}} {{turbulence}} properties of a confined swirling jet using the six orientation, single hot wire technique were obtained. The effect of swirl on a confined, expanding jet {{is to reduce}} the size of the corner recirculation zone and generate a central recirculation zone followed by a precessing vortex core. The effect of introducing a contraction nozzle of area ratio four, located two test section diameters downstream of the inlet, is to dramatically reduce the size and shape of the central recirculation zone for the swirling flows considered. The shear stresses are found to increase by an order of magnitude in the region of the contraction nozzle because of large radial gradients of axial velocity. Reduction of the expansion ratio to D/o = 1 causes the time mean flow field to be homogeneous throughout the entire test section with the tangential velocity dominating in the swirling cases. No recirculation zones were observed for these particular flows. Turbulence levels and dissipation rates were found to be low except in the <b>entrance</b> <b>regions</b> and in areas of acceleration in the swirling flow cases...|$|R
40|$|Heat {{transfer}} {{characteristics in}} a narrow rectangular channel are experimentally investigated for upward and downward flows. The experimental data obtained are compared with existing data and predictions by many correlations. Based on the observations, there are differences from others: (1) there are no different heat transfer characteristics between upward and downward flows, (2) most of the existing correlations under-estimate heat transfer characteristics, and (3) existing correlations do not predict the high heat transfer in the <b>entrance</b> <b>region</b> {{for a wide range}} of Re. In addition, there are a few heat transfer correlations applicable to narrow rectangular channels. Therefore, a new set of correlations is proposed with and without consideration of the <b>entrance</b> <b>region.</b> Without consideration of the <b>entrance</b> <b>region,</b> heat transfer characteristics are expressed as a function of Re and Pr for turbulent flows, and as a function of Gz for laminar flows.

40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with the prediction of the generation of entropy as well as heat transfer characteristics of the two-dimensional laminar forced-convective flows within channels, onto whose walls one or two pairs of transverse fins are attached symmetrically. These fins, placed in the <b>entrance</b> <b>regions</b> of the channels, interrupt the development of the boundary layers, and result in changes of thermal performance and viscous friction. Consequently, local irreversibilities increase significantly due to the existence of the fins. Solutions of the elliptic momentum and energy equations are carried out through the stream function-vorticity analysis. Distribution of the entropy generation can be further obtained from the velocity and temperature solutions by solving the entropy generation equation. A co-ordinate transformation technique 1, 2 has also been employed in the present computation for the treatment of boundary conditions far downstream. Both walls of the channel are maintained at a constant temperature. Two limiting situations for fin properties, namely perfectly conductive and adiabatic, are considered. Results for various geometric arrangements under different Reynolds numbers are presented. A comparison of results for the finned and unfinned channels has also been carried out. ...|$|R

40|$|Numerical {{simulations}} {{are made}} of thermal field flow fractionation (TFFF) to illustrate and quantify transport effects in experiments. In TFFF, molecular diffusion and thermal diffusion compete to create a concentration gradient in an otherwise uniform concentration field. In any flow device there are <b>entrance</b> <b>regions</b> in which the velocity and temperature profile are developing. Thus, interpretation of data is clouded {{by the fact that}} the temperature gradient is not established over the total region of flow. The magnitude of such errors is determined for flow devices described in the literature. In a thermal diffusion cell, used to measure the Soret coefficient, the ratio of the thermal diffusion coefficient to the molecular diffusion coefficient, the profile is developed over some time. A macroscopic model provides guidance about the time to reach steady state. The same phenomenon is relevant in the experiments by Braun and Libchaber (1). In this experiment, a thin cylinder of fluid containing DNA is heated by a laser along the centerline. Convection is created through a gravitational force, and a temperature gradient is established. This temperature gradient then provides a driving force for thermal diffusion, which causes the DNA to increase in concentration near the center and bottom of the cylinder.
