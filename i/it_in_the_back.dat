5|$|The Union {{increased}} its pace with Andrew Wenger playing wide {{on the left}} where he repeatedly got past Yedlin {{to get to the}} byline or cut back to shoot. Maidana and Le Toux strengthened Philadelphia's position by combining {{on the other side of}} the field to penetrate Seattle's defense. Wenger connected with Le Toux who took a shot, but Seattle goalkeeper Stefan Frei was quick enough to make the stop. In the 38th minute, Maidana was fouled by Leonardo González wide right of the penalty area. Maidana's resulting free kick curled towards the back post where Brad Evans lost his footing and Edu glanced the ball with his forehead to put <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of the net. The home team kept control of the first half and continued creating scoring opportunities.|$|E
25|$|On 29 November 1937 Ladd's mother, who {{was staying}} with him {{following}} the breakup of a relationship, asked Ladd for some money to buy something at a local store. Ladd gave her the money, thinking it was for alcohol.

25|$|Noël Agazarian's {{father was}} Berge Agazarian (died 1944), an Armenian {{who arrived in}} the United Kingdom in 1911 as a {{teenager}} with little money. However he eventually prospered, owning a successful electrical engineering company. He married Frenchwoman Jacqueline Marie-Louise le Chevalier. They had six children, four boys (three of whom later joined the Royal Air Force) and two girls, one of whom, Monique Agazarian, later served as a pilot in the Air Transport Auxiliary. The four siblings' interest in aviation may have been sparked by their mother, who bought a World War I surplus Sopwith Pup fighter for £5 at a Croydon auction, and parked <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> garden of the family house {{for use as a}} plaything by her children.|$|E

25|$|In September 2013, the {{original}} Medal of Honor awarded to Chamberlain in 1893 was {{donated to the}} Pejepscot Historical Society, which owns the Joshua L. Chamberlain Museum in Brunswick, after being authenticated by the Maine State Museum, the Library of Congress, the Smithsonian Institution, and the Awards and Decorations Branch of the Department of the Army. The donor, who chose to remain anonymous, found <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of a book bought during a church sale at the First Parish Church in Duxbury, Massachusetts; Chamberlain's granddaughter Rosamond Allen, his last surviving descendant, had donated her estate to that church upon her death in 2000.

500|$|The {{scheduled}} {{release date}} for Axis was almost delayed when Hendrix lost the master tape of side {{one of the}} LP, leaving <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> seat of a London taxi. With the deadline looming, Hendrix, Chandler, and engineer Eddie Kramer remixed most of side one in a single overnight session, {{but they could not}} match the quality of the lost mix of [...] "If 6 Was 9". Bassist Noel Redding had a tape recording of this mix, which had to be smoothed out with an iron as it had gotten wrinkled. During the verses, Hendrix doubled his singing with a guitar line which he played one octave lower than his vocals. Hendrix voiced his disappointment about having re-mixed the album so quickly, and he felt {{that it could have been}} better had they been given more time.|$|E
500|$|On July 1, 1951, Feller {{recorded}} his third career no-hitter against the Detroit Tigers. [...] "I was depending on my slider and I didn't {{begin to think}} of a no-hitter until about the seventh inning. I tried to keep <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of my mind, bearing down and concentrating on one hitter at a time", Feller said. Feller was the third pitcher, after Larry Corcoran and Cy Young, to record three career no-hitters. He became the first pitcher of the 1951 season to reach 20 wins after he pitched a shutout against the Washington Senators on August 21. Along with Early Wynn and Mike Garcia, Feller reached the 20-win mark during the season; they were the first trio of pitchers on the same staff to earn 20 wins since 1931. Feller was named the Sporting News Pitcher of the Year.|$|E

500|$|Smithers {{was partly}} {{based on how}} {{numerous}} Fox executives and staff members acted towards Barry Diller. The idea for Smithers' orientation was pitched by Sam Simon, who proposed that Smithers should be gay, but the writers should never draw {{too much attention to}} it and should try to keep <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of their heads. [...] Jay Kogen said [...] "Originally he was gay and black...But we thought it was too much so we just kept him gay." [...] The script for [...] "Blood Feud" [...] originally featured Smithers saying [...] "Just leave me enough to get home to my wife and kids", but the line had to be cut for time. Smithers is voiced by Harry Shearer, who is also the voice of Mr. Burns. Shearer is often able to perform dialogue between the two characters in one take. Dan Castellaneta occasionally fills in for Shearer at table reads and voices Smithers. The name Waylon was first used in [...] "I Married Marge" [...] and comes from the puppeteer Wayland Flowers.|$|E
500|$|Most {{resources}} in the game are scarce except for gasoline, which is needed for driving. The player can collect one jerrycan at a time, storing <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of the Magnum Opus, and can find collectibles (history relics) throughout the game. The relics are primarily photos and notes of the wasteland before the apocalypse. Food and water are vital to Max's survival; the player can collect them in the wasteland {{and use them to}} replenish their health. Max can also eat small animals, such as rodents, and maggots from decomposing corpses, to replenish his health, and areas where he can find food and supplies have crows flying around them. The player can venture into the Big Nothing, an uncharted, volatile area of the wasteland with dangerous sandstorms and no food or water in which rare parts for the Magnum Opus can be found. According to Avalanche, due to the [...] "Big Nothing", the game's map is infinite. A dynamic day-night cycle, a weather system and a variety of environmental hazards are included in the game, whose terrain is affected by weather and natural disasters.|$|E
2500|$|In November, Raisman {{decided to}} become a {{professional}} athlete, giving up her NCAA eligibility and a scholarship to University of Florida. She signed with the Octagon sports management firm. She said: [...] "It was a hard decision, but I’ve always thought about <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of my mind. I just wanted to try it and have no regrets, because I thought if I didn’t try to go pro, I’d always wonder. I know all the girls at Florida, and they love it there so much. But {{not a lot of people}} get the opportunity to be a professional gymnast and be able to have sponsors. I love fashion, so it’s cool to be sponsored by Ralph Lauren." ...|$|E
50|$|During the American Civil War from 1861-1865, some {{soldiers}} pinned paper notes with their name and home address to <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> of their coats.

500|$|Ron Harris was haunted {{for many}} years by his role in Masterton's death: [...] "It bothers you {{the rest of your}} life. It wasn't dirty and it wasn't meant to happen that way. Still, it's very hard because I made <b>the</b> play. <b>It's</b> always <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of my mind." [...] But Masterton's family held no {{animosity}} towards the players involved or the game. [...] Carol referred to the incident as a fluke, saying that it could have happened to anyone.|$|R

Mătăsăreanu wore only a Type IIIA bulletproof vest, but included a metal trauma plate to protect vital organs. Additionally, both robbers had sewn watch faces onto the back of their gloves to check their timing inside the bank. Before entering, they took the barbiturate phenobarbital, prescribed to Mătăsăreanu as a sedative, to calm their nerves.|$|E
2500|$|As {{possible}} {{evidence that}} the [...] "sexual song" [...] theory was created later, songwriter LaBostrie was quoted as saying, [...] "Little Richard didn't write none of 'Tutti Frutti'. I'll tell you exactly how I came to write that. I used to live on Galvez Street and my girlfriend and I liked {{to go down to}} the drug store and buy ice cream. One day we went in and saw this new flavor, Tutti Frutti. Right away I thought, 'Boy, that's a great idea for a song'. So I kept <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of my mind until I got to the studio that day. I also wrote the flip side of 'Tutti Frutti', 'I'm Just A Lonely Guy', and a spiritual, 'Blessed Mother', all in the same day." [...] LaBostrie was still receiving royalty checks on the average of $5,000 every three to six months from the song in the 1980s.|$|E

40|$|Macrophage {{inflammation}} is a {{key process}} of atheroscle-rosis. Macrophages ensure tissue cholesterol homeosta-sis by removing oxidized low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (oxLDL-C) from the intercellular space. Macrophages then degrade the damaged apolipoprotein (Apo) B of oxLDL-C, but cannot degrade the cholesterol. Instead, they release choles-terol to high-density lipoprotein that carries <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> circulation <b>back</b> to <b>the</b> liver where <b>it</b> is excreted <b>in</b> bile salts, {{a process known as}} reverse cholesterol transport. However, if choles-terol accumulates in macrophages because of excess uptake of oxLDL-C or because of impaired cholesterol efflux, macro-phages become foam cells that constitute the main component of atherosclerotic plaques. 1 Of note, oxLDL-C stimulates foam cell production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines 2 that further impair macrophage cholesterol efflux 3 and recruit circulating monocytes to the atherosclerotic lesion, leading to further plaque formation and artery occlusion. ...|$|R
50|$|Full size vans require lifts <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{form of a}} {{platform}} that can be raised and lowered from inside the vehicle {{down to the ground}} outside.There are many types of lifts available on the market. Mono-arm lifts, double-arm lifts and underbody lifts. Double-arm and underbody lifts are best-able for bigger vehicles such as minibuses or buses used for public transport. They have a bigger platform and higher load capacity so they are suitable even for heavy electric wheelchairs with a heavy occupant (more than 300 kg. in all). A mono-arm Lift is preferable for private transport because it can fit smaller vehicles. A mono-arm lift is lighter and smaller than the other ones and it ensures a clear view when <b>it's</b> installed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of <b>the</b> car. Moreover, mono-arm lifts are preferable for the side-door installation because they are thinner than a double-arm.|$|R
