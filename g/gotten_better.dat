[...] Jim Vejvoda of IGN rated {{the film as}} perfect, deeming it [...] "a singular accomplishment from a filmmaker who has only <b>gotten</b> <b>better</b> with each film."

Marceline {{was the first person}} to address Bubblegum by her first name—Bonnibel—which occurred in the episode [...] "Go with Me". Their connections are explored further in the season three episode [...] "What Was Missing". In the episode, Marceline's song [...] "I'm Just Your Problem" [...] and the dialogue between her and Bubblegum implied that there may have had some sort of relationship in the past, although the exact details surrounding the nature of the relationship were not explained. This later caused an internet controversy over Marceline's sexual orientation. However, after the events of [...] "What Was Missing", Marceline and Bubblegum's relationship seems to have <b>gotten</b> <b>better,</b> as the two spend quality time together in [...] "Sky Witch", [...] "Varmints", Stakes, and [...] "Broke His Crown".|$|E

Kevin Perry of NME called it [...] "a grimy, back-to-basics return to form", while Pitchforks Jayson Greene said Nas had [...] "settled gracefully into strengths", Slant Magazines Manan Desai said Nas sounded [...] "inspired" [...] and praised the album's [...] "narrative unity" [...] as [...] "a wide-angle {{look of the}} artist as a grown man." [...] Evan Rytlewski of The A.V. Club deemed Nas' lyrics [...] "beautifully expressed" [...] and the music just [...] "as thoughtful". Randall Roberts of the Los Angeles Times called it a [...] "thoughtful, fierce, honest and – most important – heavy-duty work" [...] and stated, [...] "Nas has <b>gotten</b> <b>better</b> at rolling with the punches – and you can hear it in every verse". Carl Chery from XXL said it is [...] "arguably Nas' best LP since Stillmatic" [...] and asserted, [...] "At this juncture—21 years and 10 solo albums in—no other MC has ever rhymed at such a high level this deep into their career." ...|$|E

500|$|McCready {{said that}} a lot of the songs were {{developed}} out of jam sessions, and said [...] "I think we kind of rushed it a little bit." [...] Ament said that the band members would bring in fragments of songs, and it would take hours before Vedder could have music to which he could add vocals. He added that [...] "Ed's typically the guy who finishes off the songs...But by the end of No Code, he was so burnt, it was so much work for him." [...] The band's mood had <b>gotten</b> <b>better</b> by the time the album was finished, and the bandmembers gave credit for this to Irons. Regarding Irons, O'Brien stated that [...] "everybody was on their best musical behavior around him." [...] McCready said that Irons urged the band members to discuss their problems, and called him [...] "a big spiritual influence, if not the biggest." [...] Vedder said, [...] "Making No Code was all about gaining perspective." [...] Commenting upon the sessions as a whole, O'Brien said, [...] "It was really a transitional record. We had a good time making it." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Moment of Surrender" [...] {{was well}} {{received}} by critics {{after the release}} of No Line on the Horizon. David Fricke of Rolling Stone enjoyed the song, writing, [...] "The rising-falling effect of the harmony voices around Bono... is a perfect picture of where he really wants to be, when he gets to the line about 'vision over visibility.'" [...] Blender considered it the high-point of the album, comparing it to the band's 1987 single [...] "I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For". Reviewer Rob Sheffield complimented the melding of bass, guitar, and vocals, calling it [...] "the kind of gimme-divinity anthem that U2 cut their teeth on, except it really does seem like they've <b>gotten</b> <b>better</b> at these songs now that they've picked up some bummed-out adult grit. Bono actually sounds scared of something in this song, and whether his nightmares are religious or sexual, the fear gives his voice some heft." [...] NME felt that it was the [...] "most impressive" [...] song on the album, describing it as a [...] "gorgeously sparse prayer built around Adam Clayton's heartbeat bassline and Bono's rough growl", and noting that despite its seven-minute length, it did not feel too long. Alexis Petridis of The Guardian was more critical of the song, saying it [...] "doesn't have enough of a tune to support the full seven-minute gospel treatment", a sentiment that The Times agreed with.|$|E
500|$|Catherine Seipp of National Review Online {{described}} it as a [...] "nasty but extremely funny" [...] cartoon. Caryn James of The New York Times called it a show with an [...] "outrageously satirical family" [...] that [...] "includes plenty of comic possibilities and parodies". The Sydney Morning Herald named Family Guy the [...] "Show of the Week" [...] on April 21, 2009, hailing it a [...] "pop culture-heavy masterpiece". Frazier Moore from The Seattle Times called it an [...] "endless craving for humor about bodily emissions". He thought it was [...] "breathtakingly smart" [...] and said a [...] "blend of the ingenious with the raw helps account for its much broader appeal". He summarized it as [...] "rude, crude and deliciously wrong". The New Yorkers Nancy Franklin said that Family Guy is becoming one of the best animated shows; she commented on its ribaldry and popularity. The show has become a hit on Hulu; it is the second-highest viewed show after Saturday Night Live. IGN called Family Guy a great show, and commented that it has <b>gotten</b> <b>better</b> since its revival. They stated that they cannot imagine another half-hour sitcom that provides as many laughs as Family Guy. Empire praised the show and its writers for creating really hilarious moments with unlikely material. They commented {{that one of the reasons}} they love the show is because nothing is sacred—it makes jokes and gags of almost everything. Robin Pierson of The TV Critic praised the series as [...] "a different kind of animated comedy which clearly sets out to do jokes which other cartoons can't do." [...] Family Guy has proven popular in the United Kingdom, regularly obtaining between 700,000 and 1 million viewers for re-runs on BBC Three.|$|E

500|$|Not all reviews were positive, however. Film4 criticized {{both the}} film's long running time and its {{treatment}} of female characters, remarking [...] " [...] cameo strikingly in buttock form. Others actually have first names". But Film4 praised Johnson's role as DSS agent Luke Hobbs, saying he [...] "provides a more credible anti-antagonist to our anti-heroes than the straight up villains can manage". [...] The Boston Herald gave a more mixed reaction: it derided the lack of realism as removing any sense of threat to the protagonists, but conceded that [...] "these films may be robustly anti-intellectual and deplorably commercialized, {{but they are the}} envy {{of the rest of the}} world." [...] Despite giving the film a positive review and praising the action, The Hollywood Reporter was critical of its stars, saying [...] "it's clear the budget wasn't used on acting lessons for the cast." [...] The New York Posts Kyle Smith gave the film a negative review, criticizing the shortage of car-related action before the finale and calling it less a [...] "vroomer" [...] and more a [...] "knucklehead Ocean's Eleven". [...] Smith went on to call the film's villain Reyes (Almeida) [...] "unforgivably dull" [...] and considered the long running time a result of taking [...] "that long to read every item in the cliché dictionary." [...] Time Out New York stated that [...] "The Fast and the Furious movies haven't exactly <b>gotten</b> <b>better</b> as they've gone along" [...] but gave the director a backhanded compliment, saying [...] "Justin Lin, taking his third turn behind the franchise's wheel, is at least a competent hack." [...] Ebert was more complimentary, saying [...] "Justin Lin is emerging as a first-rate director in this second-rate genre" [...] and Rolling Stone managed [...] "Justin Lin, who misdirected the last two sequels, finds his pace this time, staging dynamite action." ...|$|E
500|$|Stipe {{later called}} chorus lyrics of [...] "Sitting Still" [...] from R.E.M. debut album, Murmur, [...] "nonsense", {{saying in a}} 1994 online chat, [...] "You all know there aren't words, per se, {{to a lot of}} the early stuff. I can't even {{remember}} them." [...] In truth, Stipe carefully crafted the lyrics to many early R.E.M. songs. Stipe explained in 1984 that when he started writing lyrics they were like [...] "simple pictures", but after a year he grew tired of the approach and [...] "started experimenting with lyrics that didn't make exact linear sense, and it's just gone from there." [...] In the mid-1980s, as Stipe's pronunciation while singing became clearer, the band decided that its lyrics should convey ideas on a more literal level. Mills explained, [...] "After you've made three records and you've written several songs and they've <b>gotten</b> <b>better</b> and better lyrically the next step would be to have somebody question you and say, are you saying anything? And Michael had the confidence at that point to say yes [...] [...] [...]" [...] Songs like [...] "Cuyahoga" [...] and [...] "Fall on Me" [...] on Lifes Rich Pageant dealt with such concerns as pollution. Stipe incorporated more politically oriented concerns into his lyrics on Document and Green. [...] "Our political activism and the content of the songs was just a reaction to where we were, and what we were surrounded by, which was just abject horror," [...] Stipe said later. [...] "In 1987 and '88 there was nothing to do but be active." [...] Stipe has since explored other lyrical topics. Automatic for the People dealt with [...] "mortality and dying. Pretty turgid stuff", according to Stipe, while Monster critiqued love and mass culture.|$|E

2500|$|Since Chang started Pan Asian Repertory Theatre, {{a lot of}} {{progress}} has been made for Asian American actors in American theatre. However, as The New York Times writes in 2007, [...] "the struggle continues, and not only in the live theater." [...] Daniel Dae Kim, a Korean American actor who first worked with Pan Asian in 1990, told the newspaper that [...] "whereas it’s <b>gotten</b> <b>better</b> for ethnic minorities in terms of general representation, what hasn’t really improved is the complexity of the roles that we’ve been given to play.

So as 1961 progressed, the Yanks were now [...] "Mickey Mantle's team," [...] and Maris was ostracized as the [...] "outsider," [...] and said to be [...] "not a true Yankee."

Mantle was unexpectedly hospitalized by an abscessed hip he got from a flu shot late in the season, leaving Maris to break the record (he finished with 61).
