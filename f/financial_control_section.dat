40|$|In {{building}} {{a system of}} <b>financial</b> <b>control</b> important place belongs to its diverse and adequate provision. Legal regulation of relations {{in the field of}} <b>financial</b> <b>control</b> is aimed at organizing social relations arising in the process of the state <b>financial</b> <b>control.</b> That legal regulation of relations in the sphere of state <b>financial</b> <b>control</b> is exercised through a system of effective legal, regulatory and organizational influence on social relationships that develop in the course of state <b>financial</b> <b>control.</b> Legal regulation of <b>financial</b> <b>control</b> is to organize social relations which are formed in the process of state <b>financial</b> <b>control.</b> In the field of legal provision of state <b>financial</b> <b>control</b> and enforcement practice in Ukraine there are some problems. So, first, the notion of "a unified system of state financial control" is not regulated by any domestic law, and therefore the activity of many regulatory bodies remains uncoordinated properly, resulting in duplication of functions, remains high (and sometimes excessive) "control" load by controlled entities. Secondly, there is no basic law of Ukraine on the state <b>financial</b> <b>control,</b> which would define the essence of state <b>financial</b> <b>control,</b> its functional purpose, principles of organization, objects and subjects, and the object types, forms, techniques and methods of its implementation. Thirdly, the status of Supreme Audit Institution is not legally secured. Fourthly, applicable laws and regulations in the area of public <b>financial</b> <b>control</b> sometimes are not consistent. Finally, the legislation virtually governs the organization of state <b>financial</b> <b>control</b> at the regional and municipal levels, which causes lack of a unified system of <b>financial</b> <b>control</b> at the level of business and local government. To ensure full and high-quality legal support system of <b>financial</b> <b>control</b> it is necessary to deepen diverse theoretical research on this subject, learn positive foreign experience and critically analyze existing national practice, to use in supervisory authorities practice recent achievements of knowledge management, information technology and financial management, to improve the overall economic culture...|$|R
