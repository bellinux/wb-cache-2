40|$|Small {{and medium}} format digital cameras {{are widely used}} in Photogrammetric {{applications}} due to their accessibility, availability and quick image acquisition and processing. In addition, the resolution of these cameras has significantly increased while their prices decreased. Generally, a small-format digital camera {{does not have a}} pre-definition of the <b>internal</b> <b>geometric</b> <b>characteristics,</b> commonly known as the interior orientation parameters (IOPs), which are computed by a bundle adjustment with a self-calibration procedure that uses a set of images, geometrically acquired over the calibration test field. However, to extract precise and reliable 3 D metric information from images, an important condition should be considered: are the interior orientation parameters accurate enough for photogrammetric applications? Usually, the camera calibration procedure is performed using a target or a linear test field, regardless of the photogrammetric project that will be performed later. For photogrammetric applications, the camera should be stable and the interior orientation parameters should not vary over time. Considering airborne photogrammetric mapping, the digital camera is exposed to different conditions from the ones registered during the terrestrial calibration procedure. Two aspects should be discussed: Do the interior orientation parameters change? Do the changes modify the quality of the derived information? In this paper we try to answer these questions. The digital camera Kodak DCS Pro 14 n is calibrated under different conditions to determine the geometric stability of the Interior Orientation Parameters. Using traditional terrestrial calibration and airborne (on-the-job) calibration procedures, the camera is calibrated in two different situations.

30|$|Establishing the {{geometric}} model of camera imaging and determining {{the parameters of}} the camera model are the main content of camera calibration in computer vision, and it is also the primary task of image correction. The internal and external parameters of the camera determine the mapping relationship between the 3 D scene and the corresponding 2 D image. The process of restoring and determining the parameters inside and outside the camera is called camera calibration. The <b>internal</b> optical and <b>geometric</b> <b>characteristics</b> of the camera determine the camera’s internal parameters, such as camera focal length, distortion factor, and image center. However, the camera’s external parameters represent the three-dimensional position and orientation information of the world coordinate system and camera coordinate system [5]. Since {{the end of the nineteenth}} century, camera calibration and lens correction have been the research hotspots in academia. The development of this research hotspot has formed a very perfect theoretical basis, and many algorithms have been proposed to improve the calibration results from accuracy and speed [6].|$|R

The experimental materials comprised 384 Ross 308 chickens (four groups, three replications), divided into groups of males and females, and raised to 35 days of age. Control group 1 birds were fed a commercial diet throughout the experiment. Birds of three other experimental groups received for the first two weeks of rearing standard diets with a different content of propolis and/or bee pollen: group 2 – 0. 025 % propolis, group 3 – 0. 5 % bee pollen, group 4 – 0. 5 % bee pollen and 0. 025 % propolis. The following parameters of the tibia were determined: weight, length, mid-shaft circumference, vertical and horizontal external diameters, vertical and horizontal <b>internal</b> diameters. The <b>geometric</b> <b>characteristics</b> of the bones were determined based on the above measurements. Mid-shaft shear strength was measured using an Instron universal testing machine 4301 (Instron, Norwood, MA, USA). The crude ash, calcium (Ca) and phosphorus (P) content of the tibia was also determined. Higher values of geometric parameters were noted in the tibial bones of broilers fed a diet supplemented with a combination of propolis and bee pollen, in comparison with birds fed diets containing propolis or bee pollen administered alone. The shear strength values and physical properties of bones were similar in all groups...|$|R

40|$|Manual {{fingerprint}} classification proceeds {{by carefully}} inspecting the <b>geometric</b> <b>characteristics</b> of major ridge curves in a fingerprint image. We propose an automatic approach of identifying the <b>geometric</b> <b>characteristics</b> of ridges based on curves {{generated by the}} orientation field called orientation field flow curves (OFFCs). The <b>geometric</b> <b>characteristics</b> of OFFCs are analyzed by studying the isometric maps of tangent planes as a point traverses along the curve {{from one end to}} the other. The path traced by the isometric map consists of several important features such as sign change points and locations as well as values of local extremas, that uniquely identify the inherent <b>geometric</b> <b>characteristics</b> of each OFFC. Moreover, these features are invariant under changes of location, rotation and scaling of the fingerprint. We have applied our procedure on the NIST 4 database consisting of 4, 000 fingerprint images without any training.

We use this result to study a variant of the higher order theory of Dedekind finite objects and the higher order theory of field objects considered as ring objects with no non-trivial ideals. Topoi are categories which have enough structure to interpret higher order logic. They admit two notions of morphism: logical morphisms which preserve all of the structure and therefore the interpretation of higher order logic, and geometric morphisms which only preserve only some of the structure and therefore only some of the interpretation of higher order logic. The question then arises: what kinds of higher order theories are preserved by geometric morphisms? It is known that certain first order theories called <b>internal</b> <b>geometric</b> theories are preserved by geometric morphisms, and these admit what are known as classifying topoi.

40|$|We {{relate the}} {{collective}} dynamic <b>internal</b> <b>geometric</b> {{degrees of freedom}} to the gauge fluctuations in ν= 1 /m(m odd) fractional quantum Hall effects. In this way, in the lowest Landau level, a highly nontrivial quantum geometry in two-dimensional guiding center space emerges from these <b>internal</b> <b>geometric</b> modes. Using the Dirac bracket method, we find that this quantum geometric field theory is a topological non-commutative Chern-Simons theory. Topological indices, such as the guiding center angular momentum (also called the shift) and the guiding center spin, which characterize the fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states besides the filling factor, are naturally defined. A noncommutative K-matrix Chern-Simons theory is proposed as a generalization to a large class of Abelian FQH topological orders. Comment: 11 pages, no figure,published versio...|$|R
