5|$|During the Sun Dance, {{which is}} practiced by many Plains Indian tribes, the <b>eagle</b> is {{represented}} in several ways. The <b>eagle</b> nest {{is represented by the}} fork of the lodge where the dance is held. A whistle made from the wing bone of an <b>eagle</b> is used {{during the course of the}} dance. Also during the dance, a medicine man may direct his fan, which is made of <b>eagle</b> feathers, to people who seek to be healed. The medicine man touches the fan to the center pole and then to the patient, in order to transmit power from the pole to the patient. The fan is then held up toward the sky, so that the <b>eagle</b> may carry the prayers for the sick to the Creator.|$|E

5|$|<b>Eagle</b> Boys {{was founded}} in Albury, New South Wales by {{businessman}} Tom Potter in 1987. Since 1992, <b>Eagle</b> Boys national headquarters have been located in Annerley, Queensland. In 2007 NBC Capital, a Queensland-based venture capital group, bought <b>Eagle</b> Boys from Potter. At the chain's peak, in 2013, more than 340 <b>Eagle</b> Boys stores were operating across Australia. Outlet numbers fell drastically {{between the end of}} 2013 and the end of 2014 to around 170. In July 2016, fewer than 130 stores remained open and administrators were brought in to the head office to identify restructuring options ahead of a potential sale of the business, although the move did not extend to franchisee-operated outlets. In November 2016, Pizza Hut announced to media that it had merged with <b>Eagle</b> Boys. As at that date, 114 <b>Eagle</b> Boys stores operated throughout Australia; making it the fourth largest pizza chain in the country, with less than 10% share of the country's pizza market.|$|E

5|$|The Indian Head gold pieces or Pratt-Bigelow {{gold coins}} were two {{separate}} coin series, identical in design, {{struck by the}} United States Mint: a two-and-a-half dollar piece, or quarter <b>eagle,</b> and a five-dollar coin, or half <b>eagle.</b> The quarter <b>eagle</b> was struck from 1908 to 1915 and from 1925–1929.

The common name is a misnomer; Liberty does not wear a turban but a cap, believed by some to be a pileus or Phrygian cap (Liberty cap): her hair twisting around the headgear makes it resemble a turban.|$|E

5|$|The bald <b>eagle</b> is {{a sacred}} bird in some North American cultures, and its feathers, {{like those of the}} golden <b>eagle,</b> are central to many {{religious}} and spiritual customs among Native Americans. Eagles are considered spiritual messengers between gods and humans by some cultures. Many pow wow dancers use the <b>eagle</b> claw as part of their regalia as well. <b>Eagle</b> feathers are often used in traditional ceremonies, particularly in the construction of regalia worn and as a part of fans, bustles and head dresses. In the Navajo Tradition an <b>Eagle</b> feather is represented to be a Protector, along with the Feather Navajo Medicine Man use the leg and wing bones for ceremonial whistles. The Lakota, for instance, give an <b>eagle</b> feather as a symbol of honor to person who achieves a task. In modern times, it may be given on an event such as a graduation from college. The Pawnee considered eagles as symbols of fertility because their nests are built high off the ground and because they fiercely protect their young. The Choctaw considered the bald <b>eagle,</b> who has direct contact with the upper world of the sun, as a symbol of peace.|$|E
5|$|The bald <b>eagle</b> is the {{national}} bird of the United States of America. The founders of the United States were fond of comparing their new republic with the Roman Republic, in which <b>eagle</b> imagery (usually involving the golden <b>eagle)</b> was prominent. On June 20, 1782, the Continental Congress adopted the design for the Great Seal of the United States depicting a bald <b>eagle</b> grasping 13 arrows and an olive branch with its talons.|$|E
5|$|The dorsal spots {{make the}} spotted <b>eagle</b> ray an {{aquarium}} attraction, although {{because of its}} large size it is likely kept only at public aquariums. There are no target fisheries for the spotted <b>eagle</b> ray, but it is often eaten after being caught unintentionally as bycatch. There have been several reported incidents of spotted <b>eagle</b> rays leaping {{out of the water}} onto boats and landing on people. Nevertheless, spotted <b>eagle</b> rays do not pose a significant threat to humans, as they are shy and generally avoid human contact. Interactions with an individual snorkeler in the Caribbean has been reported especially in Jamaica involving one, two and even three spotted <b>eagle</b> rays. The rays may exhibit a behavior similar to human curiosity which allows the snorkeler to observe the <b>eagle</b> ray who may slow down so as to share more time with the much slower human observer if the human observer appears to be unthreatening or interesting to the spotted <b>eagle</b> ray.|$|E
50|$|In 1996, Thomas went undrafted. He {{signed a}} deal with the Philadelphia <b>Eagles</b> as an undrafted free agent.

50|$|The 1991 Georgia Southern <b>Eagles</b> {{football}} team represented the Georgia Southern <b>Eagles</b> of Georgia Southern University during the 1991 NCAA Division I-AA football season.

The team was coached by Tim Stowers, {{in his second}} year as head coach for the <b>Eagles.</b> This would be the <b>Eagles</b> next to last year as a Division I-AA Independent school.|$|R
50|$|After {{a heartbreaking}} {{overtime}} loss in Dallas, the <b>Eagles</b> traveled to MetLife Stadium {{to take on}} the Giants. The <b>Eagles</b> started of slow. Wentz threw 2 interceptions and the defense allowed 2 touchdowns by Eli Manning to Odell Beckham Jr and to Roger Lewis. The <b>Eagles</b> defense struggled all day especially Leodis McKelvin until the 4th quarter when the <b>Eagles</b> intercepted Manning twice. But, they werent able to comeback as the <b>Eagles</b> failed to score a touchdown. The loss dropped the <b>Eagles</b> to 4-4 and 4th place in the NFC East.|$|R
5|$|The spotted <b>eagle</b> ray (Aetobatus narinari) is a {{cartilaginous}} fish of the <b>eagle</b> ray family, Myliobatidae. As traditionally recognized, it {{is found}} globally in tropical regions, including the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans. Recent authorities have restricted it to the Atlantic (including the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico) with other populations recognized as the ocellated <b>eagle</b> ray (A. ocellatus) and Pacific white-spotted <b>eagle</b> ray (A. laticeps). Spotted <b>eagle</b> rays are most commonly seen alone, but occasionally swim in groups. They are ovoviviparous, the female retaining the eggs then releasing the young as miniature versions of the parent.|$|E
5|$|The spotted <b>eagle</b> ray {{has many}} {{different}} common names, including white-spotted <b>eagle</b> ray, bonnet skate, bonnet ray, duckbill ray and spotted duck-billed ray.|$|E
5|$|The white-bellied sea eagle's affinities {{beyond the}} Sanford's sea <b>eagle</b> {{are a little}} less clear; {{molecular}} data indicate that {{it is one of}} four species of tropical sea <b>eagle</b> (along with the African fish <b>eagle</b> and the Madagascar fish <b>eagle),</b> while allozyme data indicate it might have a closer relationship with the sea eagles of the northern hemisphere. A further molecular study published in 2005 showed the white-bellied and Sanford's sea eagles to be basal to the four fish eagles (the two mentioned above plus the two hitherto untested species of the genus Ichthyophaga).|$|E
