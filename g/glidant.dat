40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Pharmaceutics)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2009. The primary {{prerequisites}} for powder mixtures/granules intended for tableting is to posses {{the quality of}} (i) homogenous composition; (ii) acceptable flowability, (iii) sufficient compressibility; and (iv) anti-adhesiveness. The most important prerequisite for these powder mixture/granulates is undoubtedly the ability to flow, due to its effect on product quality, especially dose and dosage form uniformity. A comprehensive literature study on the flowability of powders revealed that flow is affected by physical properties such as molecular- and interparticle forces, particle size and size distribution, particle shape, particle density, surface structure of the particle, and particle packing geometry. Various flow tests are available to determine powder flow, each measuring a variety of the properties mentioned above, resulting in different flow results and a subsequent variation in the classification of powders. Particle characterization {{of a wide range}} of pharmaceutical fillers through SEM and particle size analysis, indicated considerable differences between physical properties of the various fillers, which suggested significant differences in their flow behaviour. Flow tests were conducted determining the critical orifice diameter (COD); percentage compressibility (%C); angle of repose (AoR) and flow rate (FR) of the fillers in the absence and presence of a <b>glidant</b> (0. 25 % Aerosil® 200). The results confirmed the expected differences in flow obtained from the various tests, with no one of the fillers achieving the same flow behaviour in all the tests. The difference in flow amongst the fillers for a specific test could, to a large extent, been correlated with specific physical properties of the particles within the powder bed. COD results illustrated the influence of particle size and shape and surface structure on the flowability of these materials, with fillers with a smaller average particle size, less spherical shaped particles and uneven / rough surface structures performing poorer than their counterparts. The percentage compressibility (%C) of the materials was affected by the shape and size of the particles and the density of the materials, whilst the packing geometry also affected flow behaviour. Particles with high density and a low internal porosity tended to posses free flowing properties. Powders with a larger difference in the ratio between their respective bulk and tapped densities/volumes presented better flow results. The AoR of the fillers was affected by the cohesiveness and friction between the particles as well as the shape, surface structure and size of the particles. This method was less discriminative in terms of indicating differences in the flow of powders with comparable physical properties. A further drawback of this method was the variation in results between repetitions, which is affected by the way the samples were handled prior to measurement. The flow rate (FR) of the fillers was predominantly affected by the density of the materials and the size, shape, and surface structure of the particles. Powders with a higher density seemed to exhibit a better flow rate, although some of the other factors affected the flow rate more when the densities were very close or identical. The following general rank order for the various fillers (as an average of their performance in all the tests) were established (with no <b>glidant</b> present) : Cellactose® 80 > FlowLac® 100 > Prosolv® HD 90 * Ludipress® > Emcompress® >Avicel® PH 200 > Starlac® » Emcocel® 50 M * chitosan » lactose monohydrate. Addition of a <b>glidant</b> failed to change the rank order significantly. During the final stage of the study an attempt was made to modify and/or refine the composite flow index (CFI) proposed by Taylor ef a/. (2000 : 6) through (i) inclusion of flow rate results in its computation and/or (ii) varying the contribution (percentage) of each test to the CFI (Taylor & co-workers used equal contributions, namely 33 V* %, in their calculation of the CFI). The results indicated that including the results from the flow rate test was not beneficial in terms of providing a more representative CFI (in fact it reduced the accuracy of the index). Next various weight ratios for COD, %C and AoR was used to determine the CFI of each filler, and an optimum ratio was found at 50 %: 40 %: 10 % (COD:%C:AoR) resulting in the highest CFI for each powder and the widest range for the CFI (largest difference between minimum and maximum values). This ratio was found in the presence and absence of a <b>glidant.</b> At this ratio the CFI discriminated well between the different powders in terms of their flowability. Lastly, the flowability scale for powders as used by the USP (20007 : 644) for %C and AoR results was adapted and fitted on the CFI results obtained for the various powders. This scale provided an exceptional fit for the powders both in the absence and presence of a <b>glidant)</b> and offered an excellent means for the grouping and classifcation of powders based on their CFI.

The analytical estimation of drugs {{was found to}} be accurate and precise. The results of rheological characteristics indicated that, the powder beds of both core formulations of PP are freely flowable and easily compressible. Acryl EZE coating over the core tablets protects PP from GI fluids and helps in release of drug in intestinal pH. These studies on coat granules indicated that, the granule beds of all the coat formulations of CA are easily compressible and that flow increases with the addition of <b>glidants.</b> The release rate of CA from HPMC K 4 M formulations is majorly by burst effect, since HPMCK 4 M (p< 0. 05) is relatively more hydrophilic and when swells it forms weaker gel. Also, the release of CA from guar gum and xanthan gum formulations follows zero order release (p< 0. 05). The guar gum when it swells forms thicker gels hence the release rate ‘k’ is small of the three diluents.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Pharmaceutics)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2007 In some {{diseases}} it {{is preferable}} that the drugs {{used in their}} treatment are released in the colon. The colon is also suitable for systemic delivery {{of a variety of}} drugs. A variety of systems have been developed for the purpose of achieving colonic targeting. These approaches are either drug-specific (prodrugs) or formulation specific (coated or matrix preparations) and depends on the pH, transit time and pressure or bacteria in the colon. Different polymers, like chitosan, have been evaluated for their susceptibility to degradation by these bacterial enzymes. Chitosan is considered a good candidate for bacterial degradation and is widely available at low cost and has favourable biological properties. To investigate the influence of formulation factors on the properties of chitosan minitablets, it was necessary to ensure that the chitosan had satisfactory powder flow characteristics to ensure uniform compression in the tablet press and to prevent unacceptable variation in the tablet properties such as weight, thickness, disintegration and strength. Moisture content of the powder, particle size and the inclusion of <b>glidants</b> had an effect on the flowability and it could be improved from a composite flow index value of 32. 7 to a value of 58. 8. The compressibility of chitosan is very poor and different factors that might influence it, was investigated. Compression forces of between 15 and 20 bar resulted in tablets with acceptable physical characteristics. An increase in moisture content, using the powder fraction > 212 ym as well as a decrease in powder weight resulted in tablets with a higher tensile strength. Lower compression forces resulted in tablets that are extremely porous. This suggests that the chitosan can only be compressed at high compression forces which are difficult to obtain using a standard tablet press. The standard tablet press was therefore modified to fill more powder in the die and generate higher compression forces. Minitablets were compressed and the dissolution of isoniazide from these tablets was investigated. Varying the punch depth or the compaction of the powder did not result in the desired slower release of the drug as a result. The porosity of the tablets compressed at all the punch depth settings and compaction percentages was probably too high to {{have an effect on the}} wettablity of the tablets and as a result on the dissolution of the isoniazide from the tablets. The inclusion of excipients such as citric acid (an organic acid which would lower the pH in the tablet, allowing the chitosan to form a gel) and pectin (which would form an insoluble complex with the chitosan) into the formulation delayed the dissolution of the isoniazide from the minitablets. Coating of the minitablets with an enteric coating (Eudragit S ®) initially delayed the dissolution of the isoniazide and would protect the tablets from the harsh environment of the stomach so that the tablets will reach the colon and release the drug.

40|$|Challenges facing {{pharmaceutical}} efforts {{aimed at}} utilization of medicinal plants as formulated dosage forms are: formulation of an effective, safe, elegant and stable dosage form {{to be used}} by an appropriate route of administration at a suitable dose and frequency of administration to give the required therapeutic activity for the proper period of time, without or with minimal side or toxic effects. A questionnaire was used to investigate the practice of house-hold usage of medicinal herbs, and the data collected indicated that the herb most commonly used as an antispasmodic remedy was Solenostemma argel(48 %) among another four medicinal plants. Botanical and phytochemical experiments were carried out for the identification and classification of the herb as well as extraction, separation and identification of the main constituents of S. argelleaves. They included general identity tests of S. argel leaves, e. g. the macroscopical, microscopical, macro-chemical analysis, thin layer chromatography and column analysis for the presence of characteristic alkaloids and flavonoids. Detection, separation, and isolation of flavonoids involved the use of silica gel columns eluted with different solvent systems. Alkaloids were extracted from S. argelhomogenised leaves in a soxlet with different solvent systems. The identification tests confirmed the presence of both alkaloids and flavonoids in these extracts. Phytochemical experiments also included detection, separation and identification of flavonoid compounds in water or methanol extracts of S. argelby using paper chromatography or thin layer chromatography, silica gel, run in B:A:W system. The chromatograms were sprayed with natural substances reagent or ninhydrin. Separation of different flavonoid compounds was carried out by using an accelerated eluted solvent passage through a polyamide chromatographic column using different solvent systems, and these portions were examined for their pharmacological effects. Microbiological quality control of Solenostemma argelleaves powders and preparations showed that these products were negative for Escherichia coliand Salmonella spp., and their levels of contamination did not exceed 200 cfu/g. Pharmacological and toxicological experiments were conducted for verification and confirmation of the biological activities of the powder, extracts, and alkaloids of S. argel on different experimental models, and authentication of the effectiveness of S. argel preparations. They included using different experimental animal models, and this was followed by other experiments for further investigation of the possible toxic effects of S. argelpreparations, in different dosage regimens, to ascertain the safety of these S. argelproducts. Solenostemma argelextract showed inhibitory effects upon the spontaneous as well as induced contractions produced by acetylcholine (1 µg/ml) or barium chloride (0. 002 mg/ml) in contracting rabbit small intestine model or guinea pig small intestine model, and the degrees of relaxation were compared with those produced by reference drugs such as hyoscine or papaverine. Other experimental models including isolated rabbit heart and intact African toad heart showed the depressant effects on the myocardium of different S. argelextracts, perfused continuously, and reduction of the heart rate and stroke. The local anaesthetic effects of S. argelextracts were studied on African toad’s foot withdrawal reflex and compared with those of lignocaine, kaempferol, quercetin and rutin. The relative potency of S. argelalkaloids was 50 % of that of lignocaine and equivalent to that of kaempferol. Solenostemma argelalkaloids diffusion across rabbit small intestine was studied before and after the addition of 0. 01 g of sodium fluoride. This revealed the inhibitory effects (70 - 90 %) of sodium fluoride on S. argelalkaloids diffusion rate across the rabbit small intestine, and indicated involvement of an active transport mechanism. X Median effective doses (ED 50) of S. argelalkaloids (0. 275 mg) and hyoscine (0. 035 mg) were calculated by the MedUSA system used to compare their antispasmodic effects by recording the inhibitory effects of these two drugs on acetylcholine-induced contraction of guinea pig ileum model. The activity of hyoscine was eight times that of S. argelalkaloids. Toxicological investigations included evaluation of acute toxicity of S. argelby determination of lethal doses of S. argel in four Albino Canadian rats and four local species rabbits. The mean lethal dose was 6. 35 g/kg for the rabbits and 5. 49 g/kg for the rats (n= 4)). The median lethal dose, (LD 50), of S. argelalkaloids was determined in sixty Albino rats assigned to six groups of ten animals each. Starting from the lethal dose of 5. 49 g/kg, each group was given a different intra-peritoneal injection of: 25 %, 37. 5 %, 50 %, 75 %, 87. 5 %, or 100 % of the lethal dose, and the log dose was plotted versus the mean deaths; the LD 50 obtained from the graph was 5. 0 g/kg in Albino rats. Evaluation of acute toxicity of S. argelwas carried out in a group of seven young Nubian goats and compared with the control group. Individual animals in the test group were given a 5 g/kg dose of S. argelsyrup once daily for 45 days, and the animals were sacrificed and investigations carried out revealed: no significant (P< 0. 05) changes in the weight of the vital organs; but their histopathological examination revealed some tissue abnormalities including: congested heart; hyperaemia of the intestinal tissues and catarrhal inflammation with lymphocyte infiltration; liver tissue necrosis of centrilobular hepatocytes and fatty cytoplasm vacuolation; kidney tissue necrosis of renal tubules and interstitial mononuclear cells infiltration. There were changes in serum concentrations of urea, inorganic phosphorus, creatinine, calcium, total protein and albumin; alkaline phosphatase and aspartate aminotransferase had high levels. RBCs count, MCV and PCV were higher in treated animals compared to normal goats. Similar studies of toxic effects of S. argelalkaloids were conducted in white Albino Canadian rats, without significant changes occurring in their vital organs, but there were significant increases in urea, creatinine, calcium, phosphorous, alkaline phosphatase and aspartate aminotransferase. Phosphorus, creatinine, calcium, total protein, albumin concentrations, as well as alkaline phosphatase and aspartate aminotransferase activities were at high levels in animals given high dose of 0. 63 gm/kg of S. argel alkaloids. Changes in haematological parameters included decreases in haemoglobin and packed cell volume with the maximum dose of 640 mg/kg and the effective dose of 160 mg/kg, while there was an increase with the median effective dose of 320 mg/kg. Solenostemma argelleaves preparations were designed and formulated in tablets as an oral dosage form similar to its oral use in folkloric medicine. Tablets were selected as a dosage form because of their several advantages including: improved dosage accuracy and reliable delivery of the drug; ease of their preparation, evaluation, control, storage, and dispensing; convenience of use and compliance of patients; their inherently higher chemical stability and their rapid mass production, and are the least expensive of the solid dosage forms. Pharmaceutical experiments included optimization of physicochemical characters of S. argeltablets prepared from the powdered leaves, extracts or alkaloids {{in a wide range of}} pharmaceutical formulations with different types and concentrations of diluents, binders and disintegrants, in addition to optimization of drug particle size and process conditions, such as the state and time of binder or disintegrant additions. The optimized formulations were subjected to a wide range of quality control tests including physical and chemical parameters, particularly hardness, friability, disintegration and dissolution, and hence affecting drug release, bioavailability, absorption and therapeutic activity. Solenostemma argelleaves were powdered using a hammer mill to a particle size and distribution that would flow freely. Sieve analysis and separation of S. argelleaves powder, applicable to particles in the size range of ≤ 160 to ≥ 250 microns, was used XI both as a method of particle size analysis and separation of powder into various sizes ranges, in order to produce materials within a specified range, and screen out very fine particles or over-size materials. The amount of powder that passed through the 160 -micron mesh was found to be 63 %, and this fraction of powdered S. argel leaves was mainly used in the formulation of optimized S. argeltablets. Preparation of the granules of different formulae involved preparation and use of various binders. The wet masses of different formulations were forced through a No. 12 -mesh screen manually in the case of small batches, or by using Erweka granulating machine with large batches. The prepared granules were dried in a hot air oven at 50 °C overnight, and the dried granules were sized by passing through a No. 14 -mesh screen, to facilitate the granules flow and compressibility. Following granules sizing, the granules were mixed with the other formulation ingredients, such disintegrants, lubricants and <b>glidants,</b> and compressed into tablets using a single-punch tableting machine. Different formulae of S. argel tablets were prepared by compressing unit volumes equivalent to 500 mg of the granulation or leaves powders and 250 mg of the granulation in the case of the dried extracts or alkaloids of S. argel. From these optimization trials, it was concluded that: a) a combination of binding agents was needed and a reduction of binder concentration was a must to optimize these formulae; and b) the use of a disintegrating agent, before and after granulation, in S. argelleaves tablets also optimized these formulae.

In the case of tablets, several physical demands can be set to the formulation like having certain (minimum or maximum) values for the crushing strength, the disintegration time, the friability, the weight variation, content uniformity, etc. The desired properties should be reached by changing the concentrations of the filler-binders, sometimes the disintegrant and/or by changing the manufacturing conditions. Another important property of a formulation is to keep the desired values of the physical demands as constant as possible during production or shelf-life despite (small) variations in the manufacturing conditions or in the concentrations of the components. In other words the fomulation should ideally be robust against the mentioned sources of error or a certain quality level should be maintained. This thesis considers only the mixture optimization part (changing filler-binderldisintegrant concentrations) of the formulation optimization and robustness against errors in the mixture concentration settings. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} aimed at {{developing}} risperidone oral disintegrating mini-tablets (OD-mini-tablets) as age-appropriate formulations and to assess their suitability for infants and pediatric use. An experimental Box-Behnken design was applied to assure high quality of the OD-mini-tablets and reduce product variability. The design was employed to understand {{the influence of the}} critical excipient combinations on the production of OD-mini-tablets and thus guarantee the feasibility of obtaining products with dosage form uniformity. The variables selected were mannitol percent in Avicel (X 1), swelling pressure of the superdisintegrant (X 2), and the surface area of Aerosil as a <b>glidant</b> (X 3). Risperidone-excipient compatibilities were investigated using FTIR and the spectra did not display any interaction. Fifteen formulations were prepared and evaluated for pre- and post-compression characteristics. The prepared OD-mini-tablet batches were also assessed for disintegration in simulated salivary fluid (SSF, pH 6. 2) and in reconstituted skimmed milk. The optimized formula fulfilled the requirements for crushing strength of 5 kN with minimal friability, disintegration times of 8. 4 and 53. 7 s in SSF and skimmed milk, respectively. This study therefore proposes risperidone OD-mini-tablet formula having robust mechanical properties, uniform and precise dosing of medication with short disintegration time suitable for pediatric use...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Pharm.)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2004. The {{most widely}} used {{lubricant}} in the pharmaceutical industry is probably magnesium stearate. Magnesium stearate exhibits its lubricating properties by forming a film of low shear strength between the die wall and the compact, thus reducing the friction (Banker & Anderson, 1986 : 306). It also exhibits anti-adhesive and flow enhancement properties by preventing tablets from sticking to the die wall and punch faces and ensuring uniformity of tablets. Besides these advantageous properties, the lubricant forms a hydrophobic film around the carrier particles which can negatively affect the tablet properties such as crushing strength, disintegration time, friability and dissolution (Bolhuis et al., 1975 : 324; Levy & Gumtow, 1963 : 1142). Due to the deleterious effects on the tablet properties, lubricant concentrations must be restricted to an absolute minimum. These effects are known to increase with prolonged mixing, and in practice one tries to keep the lubricant mixing time as short as possible (Ragnarsson et al., 1979 : 130). It {{has been shown that}} the die wall film of magnesium stearate is resistant to wearing off and the lubricating effect remains for several compactions when an unlubricated granulation is added to a lubricated die (Holzer & Sjogren, 1981 b: 276). The lubricant film around the particles is formed during the final mixing, while the film at the die wall is formed during the compaction. This implicates that the lubricant is mixed for shorter (mixing) times with the other excipients in the formulation. Sodium stearyl fumarate (Pruv®) has been suggested as a suitable lubricant in tableting (Mendell, 2002 : 5) and it is claimed not to have the disadvantages of magnesium stearate in respect of tablet strength, disintegration and dissolution (Lindberg, 1972 : 213). These properties could prove advantageous regarding tablet strength as well as drug release properties (especially for immediate release tablet formulations). Since the primary function of lubricants is the reduction of friction, it was this property that provided the challenge that was circumvented in this study. The addition of the sparingly water-soluble, hydrophobic drug, furosemide, perplexed the formulation of tablets, however, provided a mode of evaluation of the effects of formulation variables on tracer substance dissolution behaviour. Systematic evaluations of various commercially available excipients were investigated to determine their effects on the physical tablet properties as well as on tracer dissolution. Magnesium stearate or Pruv® was incorporated into Avicel® PH- 200, Emcompress® and Tablettose® fillers/binders. Mixing time was varied between 1 and 16 minutes and mixing speed between 33 and 97 rpm under certain specified testing environments in a Turbula® mixer. Compression was done with a Manesty® F 3 single station tablet press with biconcave punches (10 mm). Evaluation on the powder and the compressed formulation was done. The aim was to evaluate and compare the lubricant, <b>glidant</b> and antiadherent properties of magnesium stearate and Pruv®, as well as the effect both had on tablet properties (crushing strength, friability and disintegration) and drug release. It was found that magnesium stearate had superior <b>glidant</b> properties compared to its counterpart {{as a result of its}} flatter particle shape and larger specific surface area. Lubricant concentrations below 0. 5 % w/w gave optimum glidancy for both lubricants and mixing times between 4 and 8 minutes was sufficient to optimize this <b>glidant</b> effect. Tablet strength decreased when lubricant concentration increased, due to less interparticulate binding surface between the carrier particles. This decrease subsided when lubrication surpassed the 1. 5 % w/w concentration level. Mixing, however, had the opposite effect on Pruv® than on magnesium stearate, since Pruv® increased the tablet strength with continuous mixing. Disintegration and dissolution deteriorated with the addition of magnesium stearate and Pruv®. This was due to the hydrophobic nature of magnesium stearate and increase in tablet strength observed with Pruv®. The evaluation of the extent of drug release (AUC) and rate of release (DR|) indicated of an average increase of 50 % in drug release in formulations with Pruv® compared to magnesium stearate as lubricant. Magnesium stearate had superior lubricant and antiadherent properties as opposed to Pruv® and optimum lubricant efficiency was experienced at low concentrations (< 1 % w/w) and low mixing times (< 4 minutes). The apparatus and methods for lubricant evaluation were newly developed and gave accurate, repeatable measurements. Master...|$|E
40|$|Chitosan is a polymer {{derived from}} chitin that is widely {{available}} at relatively low cost, {{but due to}} compression challenges it has limited application {{for the production of}} direct compression tablets. The aim {{of this study was to}} use certain process and formulation variables to improve manufacturing of tablets containing chitosan as bulking agent. Chitosan particle size and flow properties were determined, which included bulk density, tapped density, compressibility and moisture uptake. The effect of process variables (i. e. compression force, punch depth, percentage compaction in a novel double fill compression process) and formulation variables (i. e. type of <b>glidant,</b> citric acid, pectin, coating with Eudragit S®) on chitosan tablet performance (i. e. mass variation, tensile strength, dissolution) was investigated. Moisture content of the chitosan powder, particle size and the inclusion of glidants had a pronounced effect on its flow ability. Varying the percentage compaction during the first cycle of a double fill compression process produced chitosan tablets with more acceptable tensile strength and dissolution rate properties. The inclusion of citric acid and pectin into the formulation significantly decreased the dissolution rate of isoniazid from the tablets due to gel formation. Direct compression of chitosan powder into tablets can be significantly improved by the investigated process and formulation variables as well as applying a double fill compression process.

In this study, goat fat (Capra hircus) andmelon oil were extracted and used to formulate self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery systems (SNEDDS) based on either goat fat alone or its admixture with melon oil by employing escalating ratios of oil(s), surfactant blend (1 : 1 Tween 60 and Tween 80), and cosurfactant (Span 85), with or without carbosil, a <b>glidant,</b> for the delivery of indomethacin. The formulations were encapsulated in hard gelatin capsules and then assessed using isotropicity test, aqueous dilution stability and precipitation propensity, absolute drug content, emulsification time, in vitro drug release, and anti-inflammatory activity. The SNEDDS exhibited low precipitation propensity and excellent stability on copious dilution, as well as high drug release in vitro and in vivo. The inhibition produced by the SNEDDS was {{comparable to that of}} indomethacin injection (positive control) for much of the 5 h test period, indicating a high degree of bioavailability of the administered SNEDDS. The absolute drug contents and emulsification times fell within narrow limits. This study has shown that a 1 : 1 ratio of melon oil and goat fat could confer favourable properties with respect to drug release and anti-inflammatory activity on SNEDDS for the delivery of indomethacin, thus encouraging further development of the formulations. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{impact of}} excipients with high water {{affinity}} {{on the physical}} and chemical stability of a moisture sensitive active ingredient was evaluated. The active drug, theophylline anhydrous, was mixed {{with one or more}} excipients and subjected controlled humidity conditions for 30 to 120 days. X-ray diffraction was performed on the blends following storage {{in order to determine the}} conversion of theophylline anhydrous to theophylline monohydrate. ^ Conversion of theophylline anhydrous to theophylline monohydrate was evaluated based on excipients present in the formulations. Two diluents, hydrous lactose and dicalcium phosphate dihydrate, were utilized, either alone or in combination. Polyvinylpyrrolidone, a binder in wet granulation processes, and fumed silica, a <b>glidant</b> and moisture scavenger, were also included in several blends. Both polyvinylpyrrolidone and fumed silica have high moisture affinity and are able to bring moisture into a formulation. The ability of these excipients to preferentially adsorb moisture in a formulation and protect theophylline anhydrous from hydration was addressed in this study. The formulations were found to have predictable results based on the excipients used. The type of diluent used in formulations containing fumed silica was found to be of particular importance. ^ The role of the excipients may also have a great effect on properties affecting tablet production. In order to determine if the blends studied would have properties allowing them to be easily tableted, functional parameters affecting powder flow were evaluated.

40|$|Levothyroxine is {{a narrow}} {{therapeutic}} index, {{and to avoid}} adverse effect associated with under or excessive dosage, the dose response is carefully titrated. The tablets are marketed with a score providing an option to split. However, there are no systematic studies evaluating the effect of splitting on dose accuracy, and current study was undertaken to evaluate effects of splitting and potential causes for uniformity failures by measuring assay and content uniformity in whole and split tablets. Stability was evaluated by assaying drug {{for a period of}} 8  weeks. Effect of formulation factors on splittability was evaluated by a systematic investigation of formulation factors by preparing levothyroxine tablets in house by varying the type of excipients (binder, diluent, disintegrant, <b>glidant)</b> or by varying the processing factors (granulating liquid, mixing type, compression pressure). The tablets were analyzed using novel analytical tool such as near infrared chemical imaging to visualize the distribution of levothyroxine. Assay was not significantly different for whole versus split tablets irrespective of method of splitting (hand or splitter), and splitting also had no measurable impact on the stability. Split tablets either by hand or splitter showed higher rate of content uniformity failures as compared to whole tablets. Tablet splitter produced more fragmentation and, hence, more content uniformity and friability failures. Chemical imaging data revealed that the distribution of levothyroxine was heterogeneous and was dependent on type of binder and the process used in the manufacture of tablets. Splitting such tablets could prove detrimental if sub- or super-potency becomes an issue...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- The {{present study}} {{involves}} {{the development of}} porous osmotic tablets of Venlafaxine Hydrochloride in order to release the drug in sustained and predictable manner. Venlafaxine Hydrochloride is a unique antidepressant that differs structurally from other currently available antidepressants. Short biological half life, low bioavailability and frequent administration of drug led for rational development of 300 mg sustained release osmotic tablets of Venlafaxine Hydrochloride that releases the drug and maintain the plasma drug concentration for more than 8 hrs. The method of preparation of these SR osmotic tablets follows osmotic bursting pump model. Polymers like {{hydroxy propyl methyl cellulose}} (HPMC) K 15 M with lactose as diluents, magnesium stearate as <b>glidant</b> and talc as lubricant were selected for sustaining the drug release. The drug to polymer ratio was 1 : 1. The tablets were prepared by wet granulation method. A film coating with a semi permeable membrane of 2 % m/v cellulose acetate in acetone was done to the core tablets. Hence, the developed formulation provides advantages of less steps of manufacturing procedure, no need of laser drilling, and economical all of these made the procedure easily amenable to mass production using conventional tablet machines. All polymers and excipients used in optimized formula were found to be compatible with the drug and it was confirmed by FT-IR studies. Drug release from the developed formulations was independent of pH and dependent only on osmotic pressure. Kinetic modeling of in vitro drug release data follows first order release plot.

Matrices are destined to be introduced into enteric-coated capsules and thereby carried to and liberated in the ileum. There, drug release should be prevented until matrices reach descending colon where release should occur. Matrices (50 mg, diameter 0. 6 mm) were prepared by compression of powders or of granules prepared by melt granulation. The ingredients comprised 30 - 70 % w/w 5 -FU, glyceryl palmitostearate as rate-controlling material and 5 % w/w Aerosil as <b>glidant.</b> Drug release was measured by the rotating basket method. The matrix containing 60 % w/w drug, prepared by compression of powders, was appropriate to make the planned system, in virtue of its fairly high drug load and its nearly constant and reasonable release rate. This matrix was spray-coated with Eudragit S 100 (EUD). Subsequently, an external layer of chitosan hydrochloride (CH-HCl) was applied by a dipping-drying technique. When transit of coated matrix through ileum (phosphate buffer (PB) pH 7. 4), ascending colon (PB pH 6 containing rat cecal contents) and descending colon (PB pH 7. 4) was simulated in vitro, the pH 4. 7 of the CH-HCl gel layer and the pH 6 of the ascending colon prevented dissolution of the protective EUD film until descending colon was reached, then controlled release started.
