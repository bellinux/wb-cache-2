Korean dairy farms have production costs that are 63. 9 % higher than the international milk price, and the producer support by the Korean government is 2. 5 times higher than the average of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development countries.

Production of bacteriocin was positively influenced by the pH and the highest production was obtained at pH 4. However, complete inactivation of antimicrobial activity from temperature and salinity influenced was also observed.

40|$|Volatile {{compounds}} of fermented beverages may {{derive from}} raw matter, {{but the majority}} are formed during fermentative processes. In the some specific cases, e. g. wines, they may also arise during conservation and ageing. These volatiles belong to a diversity of chemical families, including alcohols, esters, fatty acids, volatile phenols, terpenes and norisoprenoids. Levels of individual compounds may range from few ng/L to hundreds of mg/L. Although major volatiles may be analysed directly by gas chromatography, most of them needs a previous step of concentration. Concentration was traditionally achieved by solvent extraction, liquid-liquid mixture, soxhlet and SPE, followed by evaporation; more recently solvent-free extractive techniques SPME and SBSE, became usual due to their detection limits and selectivity. However, these techniques have some drawbacks: environmental aspects when using large quantities of solvents, price, needs of specialized equipment and workmanship. Furthermore, chromatographic detectors may be selective, e. g. pulse flame photometric detector (PFPD) for sulphurous compounds or nitrogenous compounds, or somewhat universal as mass spectrometer (MS). However, although MS permits the quantification {{of a wide range}} of volatiles, the equipment is very expensive and cost-maintenance. Another detector largely used by research centres and institutions linked to beverages sector, the flame ionisation detector, acquire attractiveness due to its good response to the methyl groups of organic compounds and its appellative price. These constraints makes difficult to achieve a universal methodology to analyse, in a single and quick approach, all the constituents of a fermented beverage like wine, beer or other products obtained by the fermentation of fruit juices. Moreover, when analysts of research centres and tutelary institutions need to compare samples, to quantify some few key volatile compounds or even to confirm its authenticity, they aspire for an easy and accurate methodology, which additionally uses inexpensive equipment. This work refers to the implementation of a quick methodology to quantify volatile compounds of <b>fermented</b> beverages, carried <b>out</b> by liquid-liquid micro-extraction followed by chromatographic analysis. The optimized methodology, reached to maximize the number of extractions per day, only uses 8 mL of sample and 400 L of dichloromethane. Each battery of extracts, ready for chromatographic analysis by GC-FID, may be obtained after 30 min, and only uses ordinary labware. Although the proposed methodology may permit the identification and quantification of a large number of compounds, it was implemented for 40, belonging to the following families: alcohols, esters, terpenes, volatile fatty acids, volatile phenols and norisoprenoids. Validation was performed in terms of linearity, limits of detection and quantification, repeatability, reproducibility and recovery...|$|R
60|$|The pretender will {{no doubt}} bring us good medicines, and cure us of all our hypochondriac vapours that now make us so giddy. But, say some, he will bring popery in upon us; popery, say you! alas! it is true, popery is a sad thing, and that, say some folk, {{ought to have been}} thought on before now; but suppose then this thing called popery! How will it come in? Why, say the honest folk, the pretender is a papist, and if a popish prince come upon the throne we shall have popery come in upon us without fail. Well, well, and what hurt will this be to you? May not popery be very good in its kind? What if this popery, like the vomit made of poison, be the only physic that can cure you? If this vomit make you spew out your filth, your tory filth, your idolatrous filth, your tyrannic filth, and restore you to your health, shall it not be good for you? Where pray observe in the allegory of physic; you heard before when you take a vomit, the physic given you to vomit is always {{something}} contrary to nature, something that if taken in quantity would destroy; but how does it operate? It attacks nature, and puts her upon a <b>ferment</b> to cast <b>out</b> what offends her; but remark it, I pray, when the patient vomits, he always vomits up the physic and the filth together; so, if the nation should take a vomit of popery, as when the pretender comes most certain it is that this will be the consequence, they will vomit up the physic and the filth together; the popery and the pretender will come all up again, and all the popish, arbitrary, tyrannical filth, which has offended the stomach of the nation so long, and ruined its digesture, it will all come up together; one vomit of popery will do us all a great deal of good, for the stomach of the constitution is marvellous foul. Observe, people! this is no new application; the nation has taken a vomit of this kind before now, as in Queen Mary I.'s time; the reformation was not well chewed, and being taken down whole, did not rightly digest, but left too much crudity in the stomach, from whence proceeded ill nourishment, bad blood, and a very ill habit of body in the constitution; witness the distemper which seized the Gospellers in Suffolk, who being struck with an epilepsy or dead palsy in the better half of their understanding, to wit, the religious and zealous part, took up arms for a popish pretender, against the protestant successor, upon the wild-headed whimsey of the right line being jure divino. Well, what followed, I pray? Why, they took a vomit of popery; the potion indeed was given in a double vehicle, viz., of fagots a little inflamed, and this worked so effectually, that the nation having vomited, brought up all the filth of the stomach, and the foolish notion of hereditary right, spewed out popery also along with it. Thus was popery, and fire and fagot, the most effectual remedy to cure the nation of all its simple diseases, and to settle and establish the protestant reformation; and why then should we be so terrified with the apprehensions of popery? Nay, why should we not open our eyes and see how much to our advantage it may be in the next reign to have popery brought in, and to that end the pretender set up, that he may help us to this most useful dose of physic? These are some other of my reasons against the protestant succession; I think they cannot be mended; it may perhaps be thought hard of that we should thus seem to make light of so terrible a thing as popery, and should jest with the affair of the protestants; no, people! no; this is no jest,--taking physic is no jest at all; for it is useful many ways, and there is no keeping the body in health without it; for the corruption of politic constitutions are as gross and as fatal as those of human bodies, and require as immediate application of medicines. And why should you people of this country be so alarmed, and seem so afraid of this thing called popery, when it is spoken of in intelligible terms, since you are not afraid alternately to put your hands to those things which as naturally tend in themselves to bring it upon you, as clouds tend to rain, or smoke to fire; what does all your scandalous divisions, your unchristian quarrellings, your heaping up reproaches, and loading each other with infamy, and with abominable forgeries, what do these tend to but to popery? If it should be asked how have these any such reference? the question is most natural from the premises. If divisions weaken the nation; if whig and tory, even united, are, and have been, weak enough to keep out popery, surely then widening the unnatural breaches, and inflaming things between them to implacable and irreconcileable breaches, must tend to overthrow the protestant kingdom, which, as our ever blessed Saviour said, when divided against itself cannot stand. Besides, are not your breaches come up to that height already as to let any impartial bystander see that popery must be the consequences? Do not one party say openly, they had rather be papists than presbyterians; that they would rather go to mass than to a meeting-house; and are they not to that purpose, all of them who are of that height, openly joined with the jacobites in the cause of popery? On the other hand, are not the presbyterians in Scotland so exasperated at having the abjuration oath imposed upon them, contrary, as they tell us, to their principles, that they care not if he, or any else, would come now and free them from that yoke? What is all this but telling us plainly that the whole nation is running into popery and the pretender? Why then, while you are obliquely, and by consequences, joining your hands to bring in popery, why, O distracted folk! should you think it amiss to have me talk of doing it openly and avowedly? Better is open enmity than secret guile; better is it to talk openly, and profess openly, for popery, that you may see the shape and real picture of it, than pretend strong opposition of it, and be {{all at the same time}} putting your hands to the work, and pulling it down upon yourselves with all your might.|$|R
40|$|Lactobacillus plantarum is a {{versatile}} and widespread microorganism found in materials and environments ranging from vegetable, dairy products and meat fermentations {{to the human}} gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Some strains are marketed as probiotics that are claimed to provide a health benefit for the consumer. Furthermore, certain strains of Lb. plantarum {{are known for their}} ability to produce several natural antimicrobial substances. The production of these metabolites could represent stress conditions that strongly affects the development of undesirable microbial species. There are many scientific reports that highlight antimicrobial effects of Lb. plantarum strains on undesirable bacteria. Several strains of Lb. plantarum showed a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity (including Bacillus cereus, S. aureus, Listeriamonocytogenes, Salmonella enterica, E. coli, and Enterobacteraerogenes) and carries several plantaricin genes of the pln locus. Moreover various other bacteriocins produced by Lb. plantarum species isolated from fermented food are well known. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of bacteriocin-producing strains in foods can be limited by several factors including narrow activity spectrum, limited, diffusion in solid matrices, inactivation through proteolytic enzymes or binding to food ingredients such as lipids, low production level and the emergence of bacteriocin-resistant bacteria. Although, the use of class IIa bacteriocins or bacteriocins-producing strains represent a promising alternative for the control of spoilage or pathogenic microorganisms in foods, their efficacy could be compromised by onset of bacteriocins resistant strains and cross-resistance between bacteriocins. However, the use of bacteriocins in combination with other hurdles (e. g. salt, acid, other natural substances etc.) may result extremely effective for inhibit L. monocytogenes and reduce its resistance. A number of experiments have been showing the anti-listeria effect due to production of acid organics, including lactic acid by Lb. plantarum and 3 -Phenyllactic acid (2 -hydroxy- 3 -phenylpropanoic acid, PLA). The genomic architecture and the induced metabolic consequencesare central to the success of Lb. plantarum in industrial applications. Moreover, the most of Lb. plantarum selected for their antimicrobial activity has been isolated from fresh or fermented food. Therefore, the characterization and selection of food-borne Lb. plantarum strains remains a topic of great interest for applied research. On the basis of this last finding, {{the first part of this}} PhD study (Chapter II) was devoted to isolate and identify food borne Lb. plantarum as well as to evaluate their antimicrobial range. Thirty-two samples from three type of traditional fermented food were subjected to microbiological analyses in order to isolate and select Lb. plantarum strains to be used as antagonistic strains (producers) against undesirable food-stuff microorganisms. To identify LAB isolates, several approaches were used, consisting of the DGGE analysis and 16 S rRNA gene sequencing. While the antimicrobial activity, exerted by cells or cell-free supernatants of Lb. plantarum strains, were evaluated by spot on the lawn test and by agar well diffusion assay test. The results evidenced that Lb. plantarum represents the prevailing lactobacilli species in sourdough andred wine, while this species were detected only in few sample of fermented sausages. In detail 60 Lb. plantarum strains were isolated from red wines, 36 strains from sourdoughs, and 10 from <b>fermented</b> sausages. <b>Out</b> 106 Lb. plantarum strains, seven strains evidenced the ability to inhibit Gram negative and Gram positive bacteria as well as moulds strains. These inhibitory effect was not attributable to pH decrease, sincein the presence of neutralized CFS of producer strains were also detected with a strong antimicrobial activity. Noticeablewas the data that evidenced a strong antimicrobial activity produced by Lb. plantarum RTB strain against L. innocua ATCC 33090. Since L. innocua has been deemed a suitable biological indicator for L. monocytogenes and it revealed a similar sensitivity to different stress condition. In the last years, great attention was focused on the inhibitory action against Listeria monocytogenes exerted by Lb. plantarum strains. The interest towards this topic is due to diseases caused by L. monocytogenes and which are known as “listeriosis” (causative agent of abortions, gastrointestinal diseases or septicaemia, thatoften lead to the death of infected individuals). This pathogen bacterium, growing at low pH, at refrigeration temperature, and at very high salt concentrations, is isolable from several food products, albeit in low numbers. Several studies reported the characterization of antimicrobial substances produced by certain Lb. plantarum strains. However it is well known that the knowledge of the undesirable strains response to these antimicrobial substances (stress conditions) represents a crucial step for the definition of an effective bio-control tool. Several mechanisms, can be developed by Listeria spp. in order to resist the injuries caused by stress conditions (temperature, acidity, NaCl). In detail, the stress seems to induce variations in the synthesis of certain cell components, especially proteins. Nevertheless the literature is very poor in studies focusing on the mechanisms of response, in terms of susceptibility or resistance, expressed by L. monocytogenes against antimicrobial substances produced by Lb. plantarum. Therefore, the second part of the present PhD activity focused the attention on the stress response of Listeria to the presence of Lb. plantarum (Chapter III e Chapter IV). In detail, a commercial L. innocua strain was used as a pathogen surrogate throughout this study. For this purpose a multiple technique approach was adopted in the study, consisting of microbiological (dynamic model to predict the growth, cell counts) and proteomics (SDS-PAGE and 2 D-E) approaches Results showed that both cell and cell free supernatant of Lb. plantarum strain RTB represent a strong stress factor for L. innocua ATCC 33090, expressed through its growth inhibition. In detail, the inhibition was not attributable to organic acids produced by Lb. plantarum, since L. innocua ATCC 33090 expressed a series of new protein including Universal Stress Protein (USP) in the presence of lactic acid alone, that allowed to react to the acidic environment. On the other hand, the presence of Lb. plantarum RTB produced on L. innocua not only the expression of USP, but also the degradation or non-expression of other proteins. This phenomenon could be due to several antimicrobial substances and mechanisms carried out by the producer strain, and they could be responsible for the inhibition exerted by Lb. plantarum RTB against L. innocua ATCC 33090. Particular attention was focused on the neo-expressed USP, a group of proteins induced by different stress conditions and which are found in numerous prokaryotic as well as eukaryotic organisms. The majority of UPS genes are monocistronically expressed, and different transcription factors, promote transcription of USPs. The significance of USPs in the resistance or susceptibility model of L. monocytogenes is presently unknown. Moreover few information are available in literature about the biochemical function and 3 D-structures of USPs in bacteria and there are no 3 D-structures for USP ofListeria. available. Bioinformatics approach can help to get more information about the structure of USPs and the function of these proteins. Therefore in the 3 rd phase of this PhD study (Chapter V), the three-dimensional (3 D) structure of a USP (EHN 60729. 1) belonging to L. innocua was predicted on the basis of the available template (PDB code: 3 S 3 T; structure deposited by Osipiuk et al., 2011) homologues from Protein Data Bank. The Comparative Homology Modeling procedure uses the structure of proteins experimentally determined (template) to predict the 3 D structure of a protein that has a similar amino acid sequence (target). The Comparative Homology Modeling approach can be used when the template and target possess at least 30 % identity. In the present study the hypothetical USP of L. innocua shares 31 % amino acid with the template 3 S 3 T which corresponds to about 85 % of the C-α with 3. 5 Å from the correct position. The accuracy of the model is confirmed by the values of the torsion angles phi and psi showed in the Ramachandran plot as well as the QMEAN Z-score. The RMSD (0. 3 Å) of the final refined model confirms the evolutionary relationship between the model and the template. Of interest are the results regarding the analyses of the interfaces carried out with both PISA WebServer and with the multiple structural alignment (MUSTANG). The surface of the interfaces (ΔG < 0, see Figure 5. 6) is amongst the average values of expected forhomologous proteins, but even more interesting is the presence of highly conserved residues in the region involved in the formation of the dimer and of residues that represent the ATP-binding motif, which is fundamental in the formation of the tetramer. This work suggests that L. innocua possesses a UspFG-Type and that this protein can assemble in a tetrameric structure. These results, although to be confirmed experimentally, provide important information about a poorly studied protein and may stimulate experimental investigations. Overall, the results obtained in this study improved the knowledge both in stress response of L. innocuaand in develop of bio-control (anti-listeria adjunct starter or protective cultures) useful in food bio-preservation.
