5|$|Schafer {{stated that}} they began the {{development}} with the character of Eddie, and recognizing what he should be doing in the gameâ€”specifically, swinging around his axe, playing his guitar, and driving his hot rod. Once they found this combination of elements to work well in combat and general gameplay, {{they were able to}} expand {{out the rest of the}} game from there, as these <b>elements</b> <b>provided</b> a means of testing the game to make sure it remained enjoyable. The first major feature developed for the game was the multiplayer element, given that no previous game from Double Fine had included this feature, and was the highest risk element to the game.|$|E
5|$|Troop {{numbers for}} each side have been {{difficult}} to estimate. The North Korean army had around 70,000 combat troops committed to the Pusan Perimeter on August 5, with most of its divisions far understrength. It likely had less than 3,000 personnel in mechanized units, and around 40 T-34 tanks at the front, due to extensive losses so far in the war. MacArthur reported 141,808 UN troops in Korea on August 4, of which 47,000 were in US ground combat units and 45,000 in South Korean combat units. Thus the UN ground combat force outnumbered the North Koreans 92,000 to 70,000. UN forces had complete control of the air and sea throughout the fight as well, and US Air Force and US Navy <b>elements</b> <b>provided</b> support for the ground units throughout the battle virtually unopposed.|$|E

25|$|The {{roots of}} algebra {{can be traced}} to the ancient Babylonians, who {{developed}} an advanced arithmetical system with which they were able to do calculations in an algorithmic fashion. The Babylonians developed formulas to calculate solutions for problems typically solved today by using linear equations, quadratic equations, and indeterminate linear equations. By contrast, most Egyptians of this era, as well as Greek and Chinese mathematics in the 1st millennium BC, usually solved such equations by geometric methods, such as those described in the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus, Euclid's Elements, and The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art. The geometric work of the Greeks, typified in the <b>Elements,</b> <b>provided</b> the framework for generalizing formulae beyond the solution of particular problems into more general systems of stating and solving equations, although this would not be realized until mathematics developed in medieval Islam.|$|E
25|$|In {{the latter}} hypothesis, {{promoted}} by Robert Allan Doughty and Karl-Heinz Frieser, the Manstein Plan was {{a return to}} the principles of 19th century Bewegungskrieg (war of manoeuvre), adapted to modern technology by a sudden and unexpected departure from established German doctrine, through the Blitzkrieg <b>elements</b> <b>provided</b> and executed by Guderian. The influence of Fuller and Liddell Hart in Germany was limited and much exaggerated by the two writers after the war; no explicit Blitzkrieg doctrine can be found in pre-war German army records. German tank production had no priority and plans for the German war economy were based on the premise of a long war, not a swift victory. The hypothesis allows for a gradual adoption during the thirties of technologically-advanced military equipment and integration into an existing Bewegungskrieg doctrine familiar to all the great powers prior to 1940, the differences between the nations being variations on a theme. The invasion of Poland was not a Blitzkrieg campaign but a classic annihilation battle fought according to Vernichtungsgedanke (annihilation theory). The lack of Blitzkrieg elements in the plans for Fall Gelb is seen as unremarkable; only after the crossing of the Meuse at various points, the sudden success of the breakout and the insubordination of Guderian and other tank commanders during the rush along the Somme valley, would Blitzkrieg have been adopted as an explicit doctrine, in this view making Operation Barbarossa the first deliberate Blitzkrieg campaign.|$|E
500|$|Allen {{rejected}} {{plans for}} a retractable roof {{during the early stages}} of the stadium's design. The lack of a retractable roof made it open to the <b>elements,</b> <b>provided</b> better views, and reduced the total cost of the project. The roof, at 200,000sqft(19,000m2), covers 70% of the seats but leaves the field open. The roof spans [...] between concrete pylon supports at the north and south ends of the stadium. Its two expansive sections are held from below by trusses. From above, two arches with additional supports rise [...] over the field. Post-tensioned cables were used to achieve its final shape and positioning. To minimize damage in the event of an earthquake, the roof has a friction pendulum damper system. This disconnects the roof from the support pylons so that it can move independently of the structure. The technology had never been applied to a large-scale roof before CenturyLink Field.|$|E

500|$|The {{existence}} of transuranium elements was suggested by Enrico Fermi {{based on his}} experiments in 1934. However, even though four actinides were known by that time, {{it was not yet}} understood that they formed a family similar to lanthanides. The prevailing view that dominated early research into transuranics was that they were regular elements in the 7th period, with thorium, protactinium and uranium corresponding to 6th-period hafnium, tantalum and tungsten, respectively. Synthesis of transuranics gradually undermined this point of view. By 1944 an observation that curium failed to exhibit oxidation states above 4 (whereas its supposed 6th period homolog, platinum, can reach oxidation state of 6) prompted Glenn Seaborg to formulate a so-called [...] "actinide hypothesis". Studies of known actinides and discoveries of further transuranic <b>elements</b> <b>provided</b> more data in support of this point of view, but the phrase [...] "actinide hypothesis" [...] (the implication being that a [...] "hypothesis" [...] is something that has not been decisively proven) remained in active use by scientists through the late 1950s.|$|E
