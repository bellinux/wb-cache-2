50|$|Following {{the success}} of the European Green Capital Award (EGCA), many smaller cities seek EU {{recognition}} for their efforts and commitment in the areas of sustainability & environment. In response, the European Commission has launched a new pilot <b>European</b> <b>Green</b> <b>Leaf</b> (EGL) initiative in 2015.The <b>European</b> <b>Green</b> <b>Leaf</b> is a new competition aimed at cities, with between 20,000 and 100,000 inhabitants, that recognises commitment to better environmental outcomes, with a particular accent on efforts that generate green growth and new jobs.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Green</b> <b>Leaf</b> is an {{experimental}} rock & roll band from San Diego, California led by Mark Whitney Mehran (MWM). The <b>Green</b> <b>Leaf</b> {{was formed in}} 1992 and released its first full length original album titled <b>Green</b> <b>Leaf</b> in 1995. MWM composes, arranges, and plays all of the instruments and vocals on The <b>Green</b> <b>Leaf</b> recordings after 1996. In the 1990s The <b>Green</b> <b>Leaf</b> toured the independent music club scene {{for a number of}} years playing live shows as a traditional three piece rock outfit. In 2007 Mark Whitney Mehran teamed up with Harley Davidson of Deadbolt (band) to record original instrumental music for the HOT ROD SURF How To Service Your Hot Rod! movie. The <b>Green</b> <b>Leaf</b> music is published by HOT ROD SURF Publishing (ASCAP).|$|R

40|$|<b>Green</b> <b>leaf</b> {{proportion}} is {{an important}} factor affecting nutritive value, ingestive behavior and forage intake. Determination of <b>green</b> <b>leaf</b> proportion by hand separation of plant samples is time consuming and expensive. The aim of this work was to establish whether a stable relationship exists between the proportion of <b>green</b> <b>leaf</b> blade and total mass of harvestable forage in ungrazed kleingrass (Panicum coloratum L.) cv. Verde. The study was carried out during four consecutive growing seasons in an established pasture of kleingrass. During two growing seasons, 90 kg N ha- 1 was applied. Forage samples were collected at biweekly intervals and separated into leaf blades, stems (inclusive of leaf sheaths), and senescent material. Regression analysis indicated a consistent relationship (y = 0. 70 x- 0. 41, R² = 0. 84, P< 0. 001, n = 180) between the proportion of <b>green</b> <b>leaf</b> blade and total mass of harvestable forage in ungrazed kleingrass, even under varying environmental conditions of rainfall and N availability. Thus, total harvestable forage might be used to predict the <b>green</b> <b>leaf</b> proportion of kleingrass in contrasting environments, and used as an easy-to-measure indicator of <b>green</b> <b>leaf</b> proportion that would permit a balance of forage quality and quantity in kleingrass...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The <b>Green</b> <b>Leaf</b> Certification is Thailand’s nationally {{recognised}} {{certification of}} environment friendly hotels. Hotels interested in obtaining <b>Green</b> <b>Leaf</b> Certification must demonstrate their practical commitment towards {{environmental protection and}} efficient consumption of energy and natural resources. Although Thailand has been promoting the <b>Green</b> <b>Leaf</b> Certification for about 15 years, the number of certified hotels is less than 5 %. This study aims to investigate the barriers {{in the path of}} implementing the <b>Green</b> <b>Leaf</b> Certification by hotel operators, with a particular focus on small-and medium-sized hotels (SMHs). The top executives of SMHs were invited to participate in this study, in which an in-depth interview technique was used to probe the deep hindrances of implementing the green practice according to this standard. The results reveal that SMHs have taken several environmental steps towards participating in the <b>green</b> <b>leaf</b> programme. Their employees are highly involved in greening activities, but these hotels are facing several barriers including certification standards considered too high and several criteria that obstruct service operations. In addition, there is no empirical evidence to suggest that SMHs gain competitive advantages in the market with the <b>Green</b> <b>Leaf</b> Certification. Moreover, the cost of green products is rather high and the number of green suppliers is limited. Finally, SMHs have a limited budget for investing in green projects; moreover the government provides inconsistent support...|$|R

GC-EAD {{analysis of the}} head-space volatiles from fresh bark chips of B. pendula revealed two <b>green</b> <b>leaf</b> alcohols, I-hexanol and (273 hexen- 1 - 01, that consistently elicited antennal responses by T. piniperda and T. minor. Further analyses with synthetic mixtures showed that the antennae of these two Tomicus species also responded to other <b>green</b> <b>leaf</b> alcohols, such as (E) - 2 -hexen- 1 - 01 found from the non-host leaves, and C,-alcohols, 3 -octanol and I-octen- 3 - 01, from bark of non-host birches and aspen. No antennal responses of the Tomicus species were observed to <b>green</b> <b>leaf</b> C 6 -aldehydes and C 6 -acetate or to non-host bark volatiles like trans-conophthorin, benzaldehyde, salicylaldehyde, and benzyl alcohol.
