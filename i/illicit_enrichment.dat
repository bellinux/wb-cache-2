2500|$|PAN members accused Veracruz's {{governor}}, Fidel Herrera Beltrán, of [...] "ordering {{the attack}} on the statue," [...] and Fox called the governor intolerant.

2500|$|Quoting Pope Francis's {{description}} of corruption as [...] "a weed {{of our times}} that infects politics, economy, and society," [...] the editors of La Nación accused Argentinian officials in October 2013 of [...] "embezzlement, bribery, extortion, <b>illicit</b> <b>enrichment,</b> negotiations incompatible with the exercise of public functions, concealment and laundering,...influence peddling and misappropriation of public funds," [...] and blamed official corruption for 194 deaths at a dance club in 2004, 51 deaths in a train crash in Once in 2012, and 60 deaths in floods in 2013.

50|$|<b>Illicit</b> <b>enrichment,</b> UNCAC {{non-mandatory}} requirement, is not criminalized in Azerbaijan’s national legislation. Very {{few states}} have introduced this corruption offence to their criminal legislation: different controversies {{about this issue}} include the point that {{a reversal of the}} burden of proof is used in <b>illicit</b> <b>enrichment</b> (Dionisie and Checchi, 2007). To elaborate, in <b>illicit</b> <b>enrichment,</b> public officials are obliged to explain the source of a significant increase in his/her assets and financial situation. It {{is important to note that}} the reversal of the burden of proof is contrary to the principles of the presumption of innocence and the protection of property, as laid down in the European Convention on Human Rights (Huseynov, 2014).|$|E
50|$|Some reports {{suggest that}} rampant {{corruption}} {{within the government}} and elite perpetuate poverty and {{make it impossible for}} advancement.

50|$|Criticized {{during the}} {{administration}} of Nestor Kirchner as a “dark character…whose activities have characterized the worst side of the president in his native province,” Ulloa has been implicated {{in some of the}} allegedly criminal activity surrounding the Kirchner administration that {{has come to be known}} as the “K money trail,” and in this connection has been charged with <b>illicit</b> <b>enrichment,</b> drug trafficking, and money laundering.|$|E

He was released because a judge considered that there was not sufficient evidence to support the charges of organized crime and <b>illicit</b> <b>enrichment.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Ballen's term {{in office}} was also {{characterized}} by a continued political stalemate with a Congress led by his former party. It spearheaded many of the corruption allegations against his administration and members of his family, accused of <b>illicit</b> <b>enrichment,</b> in cases such as [...] "Flores y Miel" [...] ("Flowers and Honey"). The impeachment of his Vice President Alberto Dahik, for allegedly using public funds illicitly, further weakened his stance.|$|E
50|$|Yue's {{aggressive}} stance {{had been}} {{opposed by the}} Governor of Sichuan, Yu Yangzhi, and both officials were suspended by the Emperor after an inquiry that found them guilty of <b>illicit</b> <b>enrichment.</b> Yue successor, Tang Xishun, put Xierda in charge of military operations in Sichuan.

50|$|The {{personal}} allegiance {{required of}} new {{graduates of the}} academy and the police academy by the Head of State made it difficult training and effective monitoring {{of the members of}} the police force. This resulted in a staff officer whose training and ethics are inadequate, and that a significant fraction is related to human rights abuses, drug trafficking, <b>illicit</b> <b>enrichment,</b> and most vicious crimes, including the latest fashion is to say the kidnapping of peaceful and honest citizens, as well as their wives and their children.|$|E
5000|$|The African Union Convention on Preventing and Combating Corruption [...] {{was adopted}} in Maputo on 11 July 2003 to fight rampant {{political}} corruption on the African continent. It represents regional consensus on what African states should {{do in the}} areas of prevention, criminalization, international cooperation and asset recovery.

50|$|Other {{mandatory}} crimes include {{obstruction of}} justice, and the concealment, conversion or transfer of criminal proceeds (money laundering). Sanctions extend {{to those who}} participate in and may extend to those who attempt to commit corruption offences. UNCAC thus goes beyond previous instruments of this kind that request parties to criminalize only basic forms of corruption. Parties are encouraged - but not required - to criminalize, inter alia, passive bribery of foreign and international public officials, trading in influence, abuse of function, <b>illicit</b> <b>enrichment,</b> private sector bribery and embezzlement, and the concealment of illicit assets.|$|E
50|$|In 2009, an {{executive}} of a Bolivian-Argentine hydrocarbon firm, Cartler Uniservice, {{was shot in}} La Paz while allegedly delivering a large kickback {{to the family of}} the then president of YPFB, Santos Ramirez, and a close friend of Morales's.

5000|$|Bosch campaigned {{hard against}} alleged {{corruption}} in the Guzmán and Jorge Blanco administration even publishing what his party called the [...] "corruption album" [...] which consisted of pictures that were claimed to be proof of <b>illicit</b> <b>enrichment</b> of his former party mates. Attacks were also directed towards Balaguer bringing up the deaths of [...] "the 12 years". A popular slogan during the PLD campaign was [...] "Juan Bosch ni robo ni mato!" [...] {{a reference to the}} lack of corruption or political murders during Juan Bosch's Presidency in 1963.|$|E
5000|$|... “The {{high level}} of {{corruption}} in Central Asian States,” explains one source, “can {{be attributed to the}} low wages of civil servants, the many opportunities for corruption during the last decade, historical roots and the lack of political will in implementing anticorruption measures.” Two “bright spots” are that Central Asia's “perceived corruption is decreasing over time and its levels of illicit financial flows (IFFs) have been fairly low.” Yet as the region continues to experience economic growth, without standards of accountability, elites will have access to <b>illicit</b> <b>enrichment</b> from enlarging natural resource industries.|$|E
50|$|The Law against Corruption, <b>Illicit</b> <b>Enrichment,</b> and the Investigation of Assets criminalizes most {{forms of}} corruption. The Anti-Corruption Law of 2010 which {{applies to all}} public {{officials}} and has no statute of limitations, does not specifically address narcotics-related corruption, but was used in 2011 to bring narcotics charges and to indict judges for dismissing narcotics charges. A law adopted in 2004 requires all executive-branch institutions to make their budget information public and respond in a timely way to information requests. There are several more laws in place to prevent corruption in its various forms. None of these laws, however, is adequately enforced.|$|E
50|$|Another {{primary goal}} of his {{government}} was to improve the health {{of men and women}} in Mexico. Therefore, he fought malnutrition among children and promoted an immunization campaign.Ruiz Cortines turned his attention to social problems and imposed an era of austerity on the Mexican government. He modified the law in order to promote responsibility and honesty among public servants since there was a lot of corruption. Ruiz Cortines created a law that forced public servants to declare their assets before beginning to work in the government. Ruiz's purpose was to compare the public servants fortune before and after their participation in public charges, in order to combat <b>illicit</b> <b>enrichment</b> and corruption.|$|E
