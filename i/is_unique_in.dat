Local folklore holds that the stones arrived in their position after being thrown at Corfe Castle by the Devil.|$|E

Another reliable method to identify water hemlock {{is to examine the}} leaf veins. Water Hemlock <b>is</b> <b>unique</b> <b>in</b> the Apiaceae family in that it has leaf veins which terminate in the notches between the leaf tips, rather than extend to the tip of the leaf, as is found in the leaf structure of other members of this family.|$|E
