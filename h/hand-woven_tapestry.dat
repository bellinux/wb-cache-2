Friends of Acton had the portrait commissioned from the Australian Tapestry Workshop.

40|$|This work {{builds on}} my {{long-term}} research themes relating to textiles and ecology, especially the mutation {{of water on}} our planet (the three states of water). It joins references to clothing as our 'home' (what we live in) with ancient hand weaving techniques in an experimental three-dimensional manner to explore ecological concepts. The piece is presented as an installation, in which thread exists both as woven cloth, and in copious quantities in its non-woven state. I used traditional <b>hand-woven</b> <b>tapestry</b> techniques (French Gebelin technique) to construct – and I then deconstructed – a child's dress, to examine the flow variants of water around our planet. The work uses the everyday object of clothing {{as a vehicle to}} explore and present concepts relating to ecology and hydro-sustainability. The dress is a facsimile, not an actually wearable garment, and the cloth is custom hand-woven, in contrast to the 'meterage' of cloth woven industrially: the notion of 'made by our own hands' is central to the work's concept, reflecting the perception that ecological problems such as global warming are constructed by human beings. The style of the dress is modelled on a simple 1950 s day dress, suggesting an innocent time – both through its references to childhood, and to the era it is from. This work involves a synthesis of traditional and new textile processes presented in a fine art context. It builds on research I have made in previous work, into global flooding and human fragility; it also draws on and makes direct reference to Bachelard's essay Water and Dreams: An Essay on the Imagination of Matter...|$|E
50|$|The {{coat-of-arms}} is {{from modern}} times. They were granted on 30 November 1984. The arms show three silver diamond shapes in a vertical line {{on a red}} background. The designs are taken from an old and common pattern used in <b>hand-woven</b> <b>tapestries</b> in the area. They also symbolize the three churches in the municipality: Ål, Torpo, and Leveld.|$|R
2500|$|On 6 October 2011, Emin {{opened a}} {{site-specific}} exhibition at a Georgian house on Fitzroy Square. The title {{is taken from}} her novel which {{has served as a}} catalyst for a series of works, created for a neoclassical house designed by Robert Adam in 1794. The exhibition also featured a series of embroidered texts and <b>hand-woven</b> <b>tapestries</b> which continued Emin's interest in domestic and handcrafted traditions. Emin herself has said that, [...] "I called it that because I saw part of myself as drying and not there anymore and I wanted to question the whole idea of love and passion, whether love exists anymore...Why? Because I'm nearly 50, I'm single, because I don't have children." ...|$|R
