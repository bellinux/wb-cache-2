[...] As for my voice, I made a recording.

[...] "I {{heard a lot of}} talk then that I'd never get 110 points like <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> WHA," [...] said Gretzky. He proved his critics wrong, scoring 137 points in 1979–80 and winning the first of nine Hart Trophies (including 8 consecutive awards from 1980–1988) as the NHL's most valuable player. [...] Over the next several seasons, Gretzky established new highs in goals scored in a season, with 92 in the 1981–82 season; in assists, with 163 in the 1985–86; and in total points, with 215 in 1985–86. [...] He also scored 50 goals in 39 games, the fastest any player had reached the total in a single season. [...] Gretzky scored his 1,000th NHL point in his 424th game, breaking Guy Lafleur's old record of 720 games.|$|E

[...] In 1991, Cindy McCain brought an abandoned three-month-old girl, who badly needed medical treatment for a severe cleft palate, to the U.S. from a Bangladeshi orphanage run by Mother Teresa; the McCains decided to adopt her, and named her Bridget. [...] A drawn-out adoption process began, slowed down by uncertainty over the exact fate of the girl's father, but in 1993 the adoption was ruled final. [...] McCain then stood by his wife when she disclosed in 1994 a previous addiction to painkillers {{and said that she}} hoped the publicity would give other drug addicts courage in their struggles. [...] Beginning in the early 1990s, McCain began attending the 6,000-member North Phoenix Baptist Church in Arizona, part of the Southern Baptist Convention, later saying [...] " [...] the message and fundamental nature more fulfilling than <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Episcopal church. [...] They're great believers in redemption, and so am I."

[...] "And when {{we were working on}} the America project I {{spent a lot of time}} on the road, which meant away from my editor's desk, and I just got much more connected to the Founding Fathers' dreams and ideas for the future." [...] His work had prepared him well for the citizenship test, which he passed easily. [...] "Can you imagine I, who just finished a whole series on America and had been an anchorperson for an American broadcast...could you imagine if I had failed?" [...] he asked. [...] "It would have been horrendous." [...] The anchor's formal pledge of allegiance took place at a regular citizenship ceremony on May 30 in Lower Manhattan. The occasion overwhelmed him. [...] "I went in the front door and came out the front door. They were regular people. They were very touching. And I cried a little bit — my kids didn't cry, but I cried a bit — but I'm a fairly emotional character anyway." ...|$|E

2500|$|Boardman {{competed with}} Graeme Obree {{for the hour}} record using radically {{modified}} time-trial bikes, beating each other's records in turn; in one eight-month period in 1994 the record fell four times. Boardman won fame by winning the prologue of the 1994 Tour de France with {{what was then the}} fastest time ever recorded. In the process he caught Luc Leblanc, who had previously been dismissive about Boardman's 1993 hour record, claiming that it could probably be beaten by half the professional peloton. However he subsequently lost the yellow jersey in a team time trial. He was hailed as the UK's future Tour de France winner, despite his own insistence that it was a long shot. [...] After retirement he said {{he was not able to}} recover from the rigours of stage racing due to a low hormone profile.

2500|$|Seeing further {{potential}} in the idea, Horn teamed Jeczalik and Langan with Dudley in February to develop the project and brought {{in one of his}} business partners, ex-NME journalist Paul Morley, as a provider of concepts, art direction and marketing ideas. Morley came up with the project name (taken from the essay [...] "The Art of Noises" [...] by noted futurist Luigi Russolo, and finalised at Jeczalik's request by dropping the final 's'). Much later, in a July 2002 article penned for The Guardian, Morley wrote [...] "I loved the name Art of Noise so much that I forced my way into the group. If over the years people asked me what <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> group, I replied that I named them, and it was such a great name, that was enough to justify my role. I was the Ringo Starr of Art of Noise. I made the tea. Oh, and I wrote the lyrics to one of the loveliest pieces of pop music ever, Moments in Love." [...] Horn himself joined the new group as production advisor and provider of further ideas. This {{was the first time that}} he had been part of a group since parting company with his The Buggles' partner Geoff Downes (after they had been part of Yes). It would also be the first and last time that he would enjoy chart success as an artist since the new wave hit in 1979 with [...] "Video Killed the Radio Star".|$|E
2500|$|Nicklaus won the Masters in 1965 and 1966, {{becoming}} the first consecutive winner of this event, and the youngest two-time and three-time winner. He broke Ben Hogan's 72-hole scoring record of 274 from 1953 by compiling a new aggregate of 271 in the 1965 Masters Tournament, which while tied by Raymond Floyd in 1976, lasted until Tiger Woods shot 270 in 1997, a 72-hole record subsequently tied by Jordan Spieth in 2015. [...] Woods's and Spieth's scores of 270 were achieved with significantly improved golf equipment on essentially the same-length golf course over which Nicklaus and Floyd scored 271. During this 1965 tournament, Nicklaus hit 62 of 72 greens in regulation, and had 123 putts, inclusive of just one three-putt green. This {{was good enough to}} win by nine shots over Arnold Palmer and Gary Player; this margin of victory was a tournament record that would last for 32 years until Woods won by 12 shots in 1997. The week's performance was highlighted by a third-round 64 that consisted of eight birdies and no bogeys. It was of this round that Nicklaus said, [...] "I had never before and have never since played quite as fine a complete round of golf in a major championship as <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> third round of the 1965 Masters". This round tied Lloyd Mangrum's record set in 1940 at Augusta National and remained in place until Nick Price shot 63 during the third round in 1986. It was at this time that Bobby Jones stated Nicklaus played a game with which he was unfamiliar; Jones called Nicklaus' result [...] "the greatest performance in all of golfing history." ...|$|E
