40|$|<b>Forced-air</b> <b>cooling</b> is {{the common}} method for {{precooling}} horticultural produce. Ventilated packaging systems are often used to facilitate cooling efficiency. A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modelling system was developed to simulate airflow and heat transfer processes in the layered and bulk packaging systems during the <b>forced-air</b> <b>cooling</b> of fresh produce. Airflow and heat transfer models were developed using a porous media approach. The areas inside the packaging systems were categorised as solid, plain air, and produce-air regions. The produce-air regions inside the bulk packages or between trays in the layered packages were treated as porous media, in which the volume-average transport equations were employed. This approach avoids dealing with the situation-specific and complex geometries inside the packaging systems, and therefore enables {{the development of a}} general modelling system suitable {{for a wide range of}} packaging designs and produce. The calculation domains were discretised with a block-structured mesh system that was referenced by global and local grid systems. The global grid system specifies the positions of individual packages in a stack, and the local grid system describes the structural details inside individual package. The solution methods for airflow and heat transfer models were based on SIMPLER (Semi-Implicit Method for Pressure-Linked equations Revised) method schemes, and the systems of linear algebraic equations were solved with GMRES (Generalised Minimum Residual) method. A prototype software package CoolSimu was developed to implement the solution methods. The software package hid the core components (airflow and heat solvers) from user, so that the users without any knowledge of CFD and heat transfer can utilise the software to study cooling operations and package designs. The user interaction components in CoolSimu enable users to specify packaging systems and cooling conditions, control the simulation processes, and visualise the predicted airflow patterns and temperature profiles. When the predicted and measured product centre temperatures were compared during the <b>forced-air</b> <b>cooling</b> of fresh fruit in several layered and bulk packaging systems, good agreements between the model predictions and experimental data were obtained. Overall, the developed CFD modelling system predicted airflow patterns and temperature profiles with satisfactory accuracy...|$|R

40|$|A 3 -D {{computational}} {{fluid dynamics}} (CFD) model was developed to describe and predict the temperature profiles of palletised polylined kiwifruit packages undergoing <b>forced-air</b> <b>cooling.</b> The geometrical configuration of the kiwifruit, polyliner and cardboard box were explicitly modelled. The model included the effects of natural convection on the airflow behaviour and heat transfer process occurring within the packed fruits inside the polyliner. The capability of the model to predict the fruit temperatures in each package was quantitatively validated against experimental data. A laboratory scaled experimental rig was used to monitor the <b>forced-air</b> <b>cooling</b> process of a half pallet of kiwifruit boxes under controlled operating conditions. The numerical model was able to predict cooling times within experimental error. Cooling within the pallet was primarily influenced by air temperature {{and to a lesser}} extent airflow distribution into each package. A maximum recommended volumetric flowrate through the pallet of 0. 34 L kg(- 1) s(- 1), far lower than flowrates recommended for the cooling of non-polylined produce, was identified. Successive increases to the flowrate, particularly beyond 0. 34 L kg(- 1) s(- 1), resulted in increasingly diminished reductions (< 12 %) to cooling rate. Within the polyliner there was a low transfer of energy between kiwifruit and kiwifruit surrounding air. Instead cooling was reliant on the air temperature flowing over the top of the polyliner.

40|$|New Zealand is the world’s third biggest {{producer}} of kiwifruit, with 94 % of the kiwifruit produced exported (NZ $ 1. 0 bn in 2014). <b>Forced-air</b> <b>cooling</b> of the produce (from the harvest temperature of about 20 °C to near storage temperature of 0 °C) immediately after harvest improves storage potential and maintains produce quality before transportation to market. The {{design of the}} kiwifruit packaging system influences the rate of cooling and temperature achieved, mainly by affecting the airflow within and throughout the package. The typical kiwifruit package contains 10. 5 kg of fruit and consists of a cardboard box and polyliner bag to prevent the loss of moisture and fruit shrivelling. Individual boxes are assembled onto pallets (10 boxes to a pallet layer, 10 layers high) Open areas or vents (in the box) facilitate cooling by allowing cool air to enter and circulate throughout the package. In <b>forced-air</b> <b>cooling</b> pallets are assembled into double rows with an aisle between the rows. Cool air is sucked through the pallets by a fan in the aisle, cooling the fruit and warming the air. The air is then either blown or ducted to the refrigeration system to be re-cooled. The polyliner keeps the local humidity high near the fruit, preventing weight loss due to evaporative cooling, but, {{as a barrier to}} direct fruit to air contact, slows the cooling rate. This project investigated the impact of operating conditions and package design on the cooling performance in such systems. A numerical model was developed (a CFD model implemented using the Fluent CFD software) that describes and predicts the temperature profiles of palletised kiwifruit packages undergoing <b>forced-air</b> <b>cooling.</b> The capability of the model to predict the fruit temperatures in each package was quantitatively validated against experimental data. The numerical model was able to predict temperature profiles within experimental error bars over 14 h of cooling. The numerical model was used to determine the operating point (in terms of pressure drop and flowrate across the pallet) to ensure rapid cooling of the produce without incurring excessive operational costs due to the power requirements. Results from both experimental work and the numerical model informed that there was an effective limit to the volumetric flowrate of 0. 243 L kg- 1 s- 1 : flowrates in excess of the limit had no or little effective benefit. This threshold flowrate is below the typical range recommended in industry for the <b>forced-air</b> <b>cooling</b> of non-polylined horticultural produce, which is 0. 5 – 2. 0 L kg- 1 s- 1. The numerical model demonstrated that the overall cooling performance (cooling rate, uniformity, power consumption and pallet throughput per week) can be improved by controlling the airflow distribution between the fastest and slowest cooling kiwifruit packages. An alternative design that channels cool air through the pallet towards the slowest cooling packages, located {{at the back of the}} pallet, by using two package designs in the same pallet, was presented. At 0. 243 L kg- 1 s- 1 it was found that the pressure drop and power required to achieve equivalent cooling rates with the new design was reduced (by 24 % each) compared to the conventional design. Additionally, at the half-cooling time the cooling uniformity was improved by 19 %. The key features of the new design can be expected to be applicable for the cooling of horticultural produce involving an inner packaging liner...|$|R

Weight loss of blackberries and firmness of red raspberries were also not affected by cooling treatments. Immediately room cooled fruits of red raspberry lost less weight than <b>forced-air</b> <b>cooled</b> fruits. Delayed cooling of 4 hr for red raspberry and 8 hr for blueberry increased weight loss during storage.

Weight loss was greater in fruits packaged without cover. Berry quality was generally much more dramatically affected by storage duration. Weight loss and decay increased while anthocyanin increased initially after harvest but then remained unchanged during later storage stages.

50|$|The GTO used on 1996 stock {{achieves}} this by 'chopping' out short {{pulses of}} current, whereas modern AC traction {{such as the}} 1995 stock uses the IGBT (which is actually an amalgamation of a MOSFET and a conventional transistor), which can switch very high currents very rapidly without damage. In consequence, the 'whine' effect is less noticeable on 1995 stock than on 1996 stock. One disadvantage of IGBTs is that a higher voltage is dropped across them than other devices (high being about ¾ of a volt).

50|$|Small {{dry-type}} and liquid-immersed transformers {{are often}} self-cooled by natural convection and radiation heat dissipation. As power ratings increase, transformers are often <b>cooled</b> by <b>forced-air</b> <b>cooling,</b> forced-oil cooling, water-cooling, or combinations of these. Large transformers {{are filled with}} transformer oil that both cools and insulates the windings. Transformer oil is a highly refined mineral oil that cools the windings and insulation by circulating within the transformer tank. The mineral oil and paper insulation system has been extensively studied and used for more than 100 years. It is estimated that 50% of power transformers will survive 50 years of use, that {{the average age of}} failure of power transformers is about 10 to 15 years, and that about 30% of power transformer failures are due to insulation and overloading failures. Prolonged operation at elevated temperature degrades insulating properties of winding insulation and dielectric coolant, which not only shortens transformer life but can ultimately lead to catastrophic transformer failure. With a great body of empirical study as a guide, transformer oil testing including dissolved gas analysis provides valuable maintenance information. This underlines the need to monitor, model, forecast and manage oil and winding conductor insulation temperature conditions under varying, possibly difficult, power loading conditions.|$|R
