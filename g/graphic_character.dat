25|$|ISO/IEC 6937:2001, Information {{technology}} — Coded <b>graphic</b> <b>character</b> set for {{text communication}} — Latin alphabet, is a multibyte extension of ASCII, or rather of ISO/IEC 646-IRV. It {{was developed in}} common with ITU-T (then CCITT) for telematic services {{under the name of}} T.51, and first became an ISO standard in 1983. Certain byte codes are used as lead bytes for letters with diacritics (accents). The value of the lead byte often indicates which diacritic that the letter has, and the follow byte then has the ASCII-value for the letter that the diacritic is on. Only certain combinations of lead byte and follow byte are allowed, and there are some exceptions to the lead byte interpretation for some follow bytes. However, that no combining characters at all are encoded in ISO/IEC 6937. But one can represent some free-standing diacritics, often by letting the follow byte have the code for ASCII space.|$|E
50|$|The kanji {{set and the}} <b>graphic</b> <b>character</b> set for Latin {{characters}} can be used {{together as}} specified in JIS X 0208 (Latin characters + 7-bit code for kanji and the Latin characters + 8-bit code for kanji). The kanji set, <b>graphic</b> <b>character</b> set for Latin characters, and JIS X 0201’s <b>graphic</b> <b>character</b> set for katakana can be used together as specified in JIS X 0208 (the shift-coded character set; i.e. Shift JIS). The kanji set and <b>graphic</b> <b>character</b> set for katakana can be used together in EUC-JP.|$|E
50|$|Stipulated in the {{standard}} itself. The IRV <b>graphic</b> <b>character</b> set of IRV + 7-bit code for kanji is replaced by the <b>graphic</b> <b>character</b> set for Latin characters of JIS X 0201.|$|E
50|$|However, for {{the best}} compatibility, the id {{component}} may consists of <b>graphic</b> <b>characters,</b> which include all <b>graphic</b> <b>characters</b> defined in ISO/IEC 646 and all <b>graphic</b> <b>characters</b> defined in Unicode except white space.

5000|$|An easily {{programmable}} <b>graphics</b> <b>character</b> set {{like the}} Commodore Pet, so aspiring programmers could write BASIC language programs that would impress their friends. The Sorcerer design was eloquent {{with the highest}} resolution in the marketplace and innovative because the <b>graphic</b> <b>characters</b> could be reprogrammed to represent any kind of 8x8 character the programmer wanted and was not fixed like the <b>graphic</b> <b>characters</b> on the Commodore Pet. Howell did {{such a good job}} in this area of the design that it was to achieve a “Most Innovative” award at the Consumer Electronics Show after its introduction.|$|R
50|$|The kanji set lacks three {{characters}} {{included in}} JIS X 0201’s <b>graphic</b> <b>character</b> set for Latin characters: 2/2 (QUOTATION MARK), 2/7 (APOSTROPHE), and 2/13 (HYPHEN-MINUS). The kanji set contains all character included in JIS X 0201’s <b>graphic</b> <b>character</b> set for katakana.|$|E
50|$|The delete {{character}} is strictly a control character, not a <b>graphic</b> <b>character.</b> This is true {{not only in}} ISO 646, but also in all related standards including Unicode. However, many modern character sets deviate from ISO 646, {{and as a result}} a <b>graphic</b> <b>character</b> might occupy the position originally reserved for the {{delete character}}.|$|E

Although non-spacing <b>graphic</b> <b>characters</b> are uncommon in traditional code pages, {{there are many}} such in Unicode.
