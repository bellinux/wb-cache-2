Thanks so much <b>for</b> <b>joining</b> <b>us.</b> <b>This</b> week {{we begin}} our star of the month festival for March — a thirty-six-film salute {{to one of the}} most underrated actresses of the Golden Age of Hollywood, the {{delightful}} Ann Sothern. Over the course of her sixty-year career, Ann Sothern found success on the stage, on radio, on film and, certainly, on television, becoming one of those faces which would, invariably, make an audience, en masse, kind of give it a happy sigh of relief, knowing well, now we're in good hands, I know I'm gonna have a good time. And with Ann Sothern, they always did. Still, I don't think the film industry ever really fully appreciated her abilities and rarely gave her a chance to stretch as an actress, something Ann lamented about later in her life. Early on, she spent time working all over Hollywood — at Warner Brothers, RKO, Twentieth Century Fox and things got particularly promising for her when she signed with the mighty MGM in 1939. But that didn't really pan out much either. She was so charming in whatever she was given to do, MGM put her in one film after another and never really upping the stakes by teaming with any of the big male stars on the MGM contract list, people like Tracy or Gable, Bob Taylor, Walter Pidgeon. But all that was still in the future when she made our next film, as a contract player at colo… Columbia Studios.|$|E

40|$|I am {{very pleased}} to have this {{opportunity}} to welcome you to San Francisco and to the 2015 AAEA and WAEA Joint Annual Meeting. I {{want to thank all}} of our AAEA members and guests <b>for</b> <b>joining</b> <b>us</b> in <b>this</b> beautiful city. Likewise, it is a special pleasure to partner with the Western Association. We have a very ex-citing meeting organized and I am confident that we will find intellectual stimulation, exciting professional interactions, fun, and an opportunity to meet old and new friends alike. The future of any organization lies in its young members. With that in mind, I am especially excited to welcome our newest generations of agricultural, applied, and environmental economists to what I am sure will be a very fulfilling meeting. These meetings play an important role in our professional lives, but no role is as important as that of presenting our association and all that it has to offer to our younger members. I recall the excitement that I experienced in attending my first meeting and I encourage all of our more senior members (that’s anyone who is beyond their first year of membership) to make a special effort to welcome our newest and youngest members who may be attending for the first time. At the same time, I encourage our younger members, especially students, to introduce yourselves to these more senior members. It’s a big meeting but we are really a small and very friendly community. The meetings have something to offer for everyone. My biggest frustration with our meetings is that I cannot be in several places at once to enjoy so many of the outstanding presentations and activities. There are two pre-conference workshops.

40|$|Thanks <b>for</b> <b>joining</b> <b>us</b> {{again in}} <b>this</b> our latest issue (V/ 1) of Journal of Social Studies Education Research (JSSER). Our journal has turned 5 {{years old with}} this issue. We are {{extremely}} delighted and proud to see the seeds we planted {{in the autumn of}} 2010 take root and grow. Social studies as a system of scientific research, and an academic career, is relatively new to Turkey, so achieving this success here means even more compared to in other countries with more deeply rooted traditions and a greater accumulation of knowledge in this area. Therefore I am grateful to everyone who contributed to achieving this success over the last four years. JSSER {{is a member of the}} Association for Social Studies Educators (ASSE). From ASSE’s perspective JSSER‘s role is to provide a basis for social studies academicians to fulfill their national and wider responsibilities and mission by contributing to the advancement of the social science research and to the sharing of research results. The second contribution of the JSSER in this area was to set up and institutionalize an International Symposium on Social Studies Education. Last month we held the third such symposium. Every year we bring together hundreds of native and foreign scientists, teachers and students in these symposiums, which have gained the status of a scientific banquet. Among our medium term targets is the advancement of these two activities in quality and quantity...|$|R

40|$|Hello, Thanks <b>for</b> <b>joining</b> <b>us</b> {{again in}} <b>this</b> November 2014 issue (V/ 2) of Journal of Social Studies Education Research (JSSER). Our journal has {{completed}} its 5 years with this current issue. As {{the family of}} Association of Social Studies Educators (ASSE), we are extremely delighted and proud to see the blossoms that we first watered in 2009. JSSER has turned to a qualified electronic journal that has been acknowledged and indexed by various indexes in recent years. One of those indexes has been recognized by Turkish Higher Education Council as a database that includes periodicals regarded as publishing quality academic papers that fulfills the requirements for applying associate professorship. Since its foundation, ASSE, {{the publisher of the}} JSSER has been playing the role of an instrument to manifest and improve the “New Social Studies Movement” which emerged through the end of 1990 s. The mission of JSSER in this context is to meet the requirement for academic periodical, publishing studies on social studies education. Being published as an electronic journal, JSSER gives us an opportunity to take advantages of the so called Information Age. As a matter of fact, today’s electronic journals have a potential to reach more readers than most of the best-selling published periodicals of late 20 th Century. Nevertheless, the same technologies present some risks that we cannot keep under control. The problems that the have been experiencing in the preparation processes of the last two issues are in this kind. In this issue, we have also experienced some communication problems as result of the moving of JSSER’s technical substructure to the Turkish Journal Park. As a result, only three papers, whose peer-reviewing processes had completed could be published in this current issue: Rishabh Kumar Mishra “Social Constructivism and Teaching of Social Science”, Hatice Türe and Arife Figen Ersoy “Sosyal Bilgiler Öğretmenlerinin Hoşgörü Algısı” (Social Studies Teachers’ Perceptions of Tolerance) and Feryal Çubukçu “Values Education Through Literary Texts”. These valuable papers have potential to contribute the literature on social studies education. One of the main aims of ASSE was to establish a regular scientific event through which social studies educators from Turkey and abroad get together to share their academic works and ideas. In conjunction with the Faculty of Education of Bolu Abant Izzet Baysal University we are organizing the Fourth International Symposium on Social Studies Education (ISSE) in April 2015. The main theme of ISSE the 4 th is “Peace Education”. The preference of this theme emphasizes on our hopes and determination for our envision for peace in the late Ottoman geography, in which guns have still been on fire and people have still been shedding tears. And this could be regarded as something similar to the action of Mustafa Kemal Pasha who thought of about the reconstruction of the country after the war and assembled an “Educational Congress” in Ankara to discuss educational issues, during the most difficult days of the War of Independence in 1921. Adopting this approach, we have been considering putting effort to institutionalize the values of democracy, human rights, justice, freedom of thought and freedom of conscience. As a final remark, I would like to thank everyone who contributed to the production of this issue and special thanks to Assoc. Prof. Dr. Erkan Dinç who acted as issue editor. Best regards and hope to meet you in ISSE the 4 th...|$|R
