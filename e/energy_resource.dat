5|$|Hydrogen {{is not an}} <b>energy</b> <b>resource,</b> {{except in}} the {{hypothetical}} context of commercial nuclear fusion power plants using deuterium or tritium, a technology presently far from development. The Sun's energy comes from nuclear fusion of hydrogen, but this process is difficult to achieve controllably on Earth. Elemental hydrogen from solar, biological, or electrical sources requires more energy to make than is obtained by burning it, so in these cases hydrogen functions as an energy carrier, like a battery. Hydrogen may be obtained from fossil sources (such as methane), but these sources are unsustainable.|$|E

25|$|How might {{climate change}} have other effects that {{indirectly}} shape energy {{production and consumption}} in the United States? The research evidence about indirect effects ranges from abundant information about possible {{effects of climate change}} policies on energy technology choices to extremely limited information about such issues as effects on energy security. Based on this mixed evidence, it appears that climate change is likely to affect risk management in the investment behavior of some energy institutions, and it is very likely to have some effects on energy technology R investments and <b>energy</b> <b>resource</b> and technology choices. In addition, climate change can be expected to affect other countries in ways that in turn affect U.S. energy conditions through their participation in global and hemispheric energy markets, and climate change concerns could interact with some driving forces behind policies focused on U.S. energy security.|$|E

25|$|Because the Earth's tides are {{ultimately}} due to gravitational {{interaction with the}} Moon and Sun and the Earth's rotation, tidal power is practically inexhaustible and classified as a renewable <b>energy</b> <b>resource.</b> Movement of tides causes a loss of mechanical energy in the Earth–Moon system: this {{is a result of}} pumping of water through natural restrictions around coastlines and consequent viscous dissipation at the seabed and in turbulence. This loss of energy has caused the rotation of the Earth to slow in the 4.5billion years since its formation. During the last 620million years the period of rotation of the earth (length of a day) has increased from 21.9hours to 24hours; in this period the Earth has lost 17% of its rotational energy. While tidal power will take additional energy from the system, the effect is negligible and would only be noticed over millions of years.|$|E
25|$|Since 1980, China's energy {{production}} has grown dramatically, {{as has the}} proportion allocated to domestic consumption. Some 80 percent of all power is generated from fossil fuel at thermal plants, with about 17 percent at hydroelectric installations; only about two percent is from nuclear energy, mainly from plants located in Guangdong and Zhejiang. Though China has rich overall energy potential, most {{have yet to be}} developed. In addition, the geographical distribution of energy puts most of these resources relatively far from their major industrial users. Basically the northeast is rich in coal and oil, the central part of north China has abundant coal, and the southwest has immense hydroelectric potential.
