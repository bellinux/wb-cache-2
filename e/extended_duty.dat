25|$|While at Langley, the ACTS was {{hampered}} by a chronic shortage of instructors, {{caused by a}} lack of policy within the Army for filling vacancies despite a rapid turnover in staff in the first three years. School administrators were forced to double as instructors. The situation was somewhat ameliorated in August 1924 when the Chief of the Air Service authorized <b>extended</b> <b>duty</b> for instructors, most of whom afterwards served four-year tours on the faculty, with an overlap between incoming and outgoing staff. Between 1925 and 1929 the number of instructors gradually doubled to 16 but even that number proved insufficient to research the vast collection of aviation literature the school’s library was collecting to establish doctrine.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} the Aircrew Scheduling Problem of determining {{tours of duty}} (TODs) for aircrews, given a set of sectors (or flights) requiring regular crews. A regular crew consists of two crew members, but by including supplementary crew (a third pilot) on some sectors {{it is possible to}} <b>extend</b> <b>duty</b> periods to generate more cost efficient TODS. A related problem is thus to generate TODs for these third pilots, but the sectors requiring a third pilot are not known in advance. To solve these two related problems simultaneously, we apply a heuristic procedure that solves a sequence of matching problems, i. e. a repeated matching algorithm. Numerical results based on the solution of a real problem show that this approach is a valid and efficient method for solving the Aircrew Scheduling Problem, especially when there is the option of using supplementary crew to <b>extend</b> <b>duty</b> periods. ...|$|R

50|$|The {{meaning is}} {{different}} {{when considering the}} actual and most common use of the term. Today a collateral warranty generally defines an agreement ancillary to another principal contract and/or a letter of appointment. For the benefice of a third party, it imposes an <b>extended</b> <b>duty</b> of care and a broader liability on two separate parties involved in a contract.

5000|$|In {{addition}} to the command and control mission, Torrejón Air Base hosted SAC reflex operations. Reflex operations consisted of rotating Boeing B-47 Stratojet wings overseas for <b>extended</b> <b>duty</b> {{as part of a}} dispersal program. Another reason for establishing Reflex bases was the relatively short range of the B-47, unlike the intercontinental range of the Convair B-36 [...] "Peacemaker" [...] and Boeing B-52 Stratofortress which could remain based permanently in the United States. Also, in this way SAC could spread out its potential as a Soviet target by placing its aircraft, weapons, and personnel on many more bases, with each bombardment wing having two additional installations to which it could disperse.|$|E
