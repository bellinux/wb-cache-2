5000|$|<b>Hairline</b> {{lowering}} {{can sometimes}} be used to lower a high <b>hairline</b> secondary to hair loss, although {{there may be a}} visible scar after further hair loss.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Hairline</b> {{lowering}} {{is typically}} performed on an outpatient basis with local anesthesia and intravenous sedation. The surgeon marks the anticipated postoperative <b>hairline</b> prior to surgery. The new <b>hairline</b> can {{be tailored to}} the patient’s preferences and is often wavy to mimic a natural <b>hairline.</b> During the surgery, the excess forehead and/or scalp is excised and the scalp is advanced to the new <b>hairline.</b> The incisions are made {{in such a manner}} (trichophytic) so that hair regrows through and in front of the eventual <b>hairline</b> scar making it undetectable. [...] The scalp has to be separated from the skull going far back almost to the neck. [...] Additional scalp advancement can be achieved by incising the galea (the deep fibrous inelastic scalp layer) which allows the scalp to stretch. Sometimes the surgeon will use implantable devices or sutures to secure the scalp to the bone at its new forward location. The surgeon will usually close the wound with 2 layers of sutures or surgical clips.|$|R
5000|$|Frontal fibrosing alopecia, a {{clinical}} variant of lichen planopilaris, is a female scarring alopecia characterized by progressive recession of the frontotemporal <b>hairline.</b> It is characterised {{by the absence}} of vellus hair in the <b>hairline.</b>|$|R

40|$|The paper {{addresses}} a clinically challenging problem of <b>hairline</b> mandibular fracture detection from Computed Tomography (CT) images. A <b>hairline</b> fracture that has critical clinical importance, {{can be easily}} missed {{due to lack of}} sharp discontinuity and presence of intensity inhomogeneity, if not scrutinized carefully. In this work, 2 D image slices containing mandibles with <b>hairline</b> fractures are separated first from input image sequences of broken craniofacial skeletons. This is achieved through an intensity-based image retrieval scheme with Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance as the measure of similarity and an unbroken mandible as the reference image. Since, a <b>hairline</b> fracture is essentially a discontinuity in the bone contour, we model it as a minimum cut in an appropriately weighted flow network. Existing graph cut-based segmentation framework is enhanced with a novel construction of the flow network, guided by the geometry of the mandible. Ford-Fulkerson algorithm is employed next to obtain a minimum cut, which represents the <b>hairline</b> fracture in these already separated slices. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Index Terms — <b>Hairline</b> mandibular fracture, Max-flow mincut, Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance...|$|R
50|$|Frontal Fibrosing Alopecia is the frontotemporal <b>hairline</b> {{recession}} and eyebrow loss in postmenopausal women that {{is associated with}} perifollicular erythema, especially along the <b>hairline.</b> It {{is considered to be a}} clinical variant of lichen planopilaris.|$|R
50|$|Satisfactory <b>hairline</b> {{lowering}} is {{a balance}} between patient expectations and anatomical limitations. Scalp laxity is a primary determinant of extent of <b>hairline</b> advancement. When scalp laxity is insufficient for the desired amount of advancement, use of tissue expanders can greatly increase the possible advancement.|$|R

5000|$|A widow's peak is a {{distinct}} point in the <b>hairline</b> {{in the center of}} the forehead; [...] it is a dominant inherited trait. There are varying degrees of the peak. People who do not have a widow's peak have a <b>hairline</b> that runs straight across.|$|R
50|$|Another {{symptom of}} FND is the V-shaped <b>hairline.</b> In the normal situation, hair growth {{surrounding}} the eyes is inhibited. However, in FND this suppression is prevented in the midline by the increased inter-ocular distance. This causes the so-called widow’s peak (a V-shaped <b>hairline)</b> in FND patients.|$|R

5000|$|Diagonal and {{vertical}} <b>hairlines</b> and serifs are relatively strong, while horizontal serifs {{are small and}} intend to emphasize stroke endings rather than stand out themselves. This principle is most noticeable in the italics where the lowercase characters are subdued in style. It is somewhat more condensed than average for a font of its kind. A profile of Bosma for the Monotype website commented: [...] "One of the defining features of the typeface is its contrast between heavy vertical serifs and <b>hairlines</b> - which keep the font sturdy, and ensures the design is preserved at small sizes - and its relatively thin horizontals, which ensure the typeface remains crisp when used at larger sizes." ...|$|E
50|$|Times Eighteen, a {{headline}} version for point sizes of 18 and larger. The characters are subtly condensed and the <b>hairlines</b> are finer. The current version has no italics, but {{does have a}} lower case (whereas some Times titling fonts were capitals only).|$|E

40|$|At 3 – 4 {{months of}} age, infants respond to gender {{information}} in human faces. Specifically, young infants display a visual preference toward female over male faces. In three experiments, using a visual preference task, we investigated {{the role of}} <b>hairline</b> information in this bias. In Experiment 1, we presented male and female composite faces with similar hairstyles to 4 -month-olds and observed a preference for female faces. In Experiment 2, the faces were presented, but in this instance, without <b>hairline</b> cues, and the preference was eliminated. In Experiment 3, using the same cropping to eliminate <b>hairline</b> cues, but with feminized female faces and masculinized male faces, infants’ preference toward female faces was still not in evidence. The findings show that <b>hairline</b> information is important in young infants’ preferential orientation toward female face...|$|R

5000|$|This {{practice}} {{is part of}} the modesty-related dress standard called tzniut.

Traditional sheitels are secured by elastic caps and are often designed with heavy bangs to obscure the hairline of their wearers. However, more modern designed lace-front wigs with realistic <b>hairlines</b> are growing in popularity.|$|E
5000|$|These nibs, while often a great {{introduction}} {{into the}} ability—and art, as most calligraphers would argue—of flexible nibs for new users, lack {{some of the}} control and finesse of gold nibs and the capability to make <b>hairlines</b> that traditional steel dip nibs possess. These nibs also don't possess the same [...] "spring-back" [...] that some 14K fountain pen nibs offer. They are, however, more forgiving in the accidental case of over-flexing, given steel's more resilient characteristics, and at a price that is accessible for most people.|$|E
