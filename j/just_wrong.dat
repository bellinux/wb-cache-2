Summer explains that Tom was right about true love existing; he was <b>just</b> <b>wrong</b> about it being with her. She says she got married because she felt sure about her husband, something she wasn't with Tom. Summer puts her hand on Tom's and says she is glad to see he is doing well.

500|$|Elworthy {{suggested}} that the Ooser was a depiction of the Devil, an idea supported by Dewar, who believed that, as the Devil, its imagery was [...] "intended to inspire terror {{in the minds of}} the foolish and the wicked". Conversely, others have {{suggested that}} it is a depiction of a pre-Christian god. In her 1931 book The God of the Witches, Margaret Murray connected the Ooser to her version of the witch-cult hypothesis—the idea that those persecuted in the Early Modern witch trials were adherents of a surviving pre-Christian fertility religion—claiming that the mask was a cult item that reflected continuing worship of the cult's Horned God. Murray's hypothesis is now discredited. The historians Jeffrey B. Russell and Brooks Alexander have stated that [...] "today, scholars are agreed that Murray was more than <b>just</b> <b>wrong</b> [...] she was completely and embarrassingly wrong on nearly all of her basic premises". The Ooser's pre-Christian origin theory was echoed in the Reader's Digest encyclopedia of British folklore, Folklore, Myths and Legends of Britain, where it was described as [...] "the idol of a former god of fertility". Although not believing that the Ooser was a specific depiction of a surviving pre-Christian deity, Dewar {{suggested that the}} imagery of the Devil, and thus of the Ooser, was originally drawn from the pre-Christian gods of [...] "phallic or fertility worship".|$|E

Concurring with this assessment, historian Jeffrey B. Russell and Brooks Alexander stated that [...] "Murray's use of sources in general is appalling". They went on to assert that [...] "Today, scholars are agreed that Murray was more than <b>just</b> <b>wrong</b> [...] she was completely and embarrassingly wrong on nearly all of her basic premises." [...] In his sociological study of the Early Modern witchcraft, Gary Jensen highlighted that Murray's work had been [...] "seriously challenged" [...] and {{that it did not}} take into account [...] "why it took so long for the heretic witch to be invented and targeted", noting that had the Murrayite witch-cult been a reality, then it would have been persecuted throughout the Medieval and not just in the Early Modern period.|$|E

He added: [...] "Sadly, this sentiment has been plaguing Thailand for at least a decade — the belief that those {{on the other side of}} the political divide are not <b>just</b> <b>wrong,</b> but are enemies that need to be 'removed'". He pointed out that under the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, [...] "some 2 million of the 8-million population were killed for the sake of a political ideology that saw 'the other' as an enemy that had to be eradicated". Although [...] "Thailand is far from becoming another killing field of that scale," [...] stated Pravit, [...] "the seeds of mutual destruction are quite visible as they continue being nurtured by hate speech on social media and watered by remarks from people like Prayuth".

Dutch Ruppersberger (D-MD), a ranking member of the United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence ("House Intelligence Committee"). Ruppersberger, who was a guest on the show, responded, [...] "We have rules {{as far as the}} committee and what you can have and what you cannot have. However, based on that, that statement I just made, is that since this incident occurred with Snowden, we've had three different hearings for members of our Democratic Caucus, and the Republican Caucus.... And we will continue to do that because what we're trying to do now is to get the American public to know more about what's going on." [...] Rep. King, who was also a guest on This Week as a ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, stated: [...] "o me it's unprecedented to have all of these top people from an administration during this time of crisis still come in and answer question after question after question.

2500|$|To wit, {{the novel}} is deeply {{invested}} in exploring Shakespeare scholarship and the [...] "Shakespeare-Industrial Complex" [...] - in particular the work of Harold Bloom, whose books The Anxiety of Influence and Shakespeare: The Invention of the Human are explicitly referenced. The Introduction features countless references to Shakespeare plays, many of which, Phillips claims were unintentional, artifacts of [...] "things that stuck in memory" [...] from his research. The book also references the grand scope of Shakespeare's influence – the narrator claims that his writing is [...] "a nursery of titles for other, better writers" [...] going on to list Pale Fire, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead, Infinite Jest, The Sound and the Fury and many other texts. Furthermore, {{the novel is}} remarkably dismissive of the anti-Stratfordian (i.e., {{those who do not}} believe that a man named William Shakespeare wrote the plays attributed him) camp of Shakespeare scholarship. Phillips calls their theories [...] "a gentle, harmless madness," [...] and as plausible as the narrative of Roland Emmerich's Independence Day (Emmerich directed the 2011 anti-Stratfordian film Anonymous). He immersed himself in their argumentation in researching the book and [...] "came to the conclusion that while [...] can appreciate their passion and their willingness to hold on against a sometimes-scornful majority, they are really, really <b>just</b> <b>wrong.</b> Their approach to factual documentation and to the reading of fiction, both, require a view of the universe that [...] just can’t accept."
