40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>High</b> <b>risk</b> {{medications}} {{are commonly}} prescribed to older US patients. Currently, less {{is known about}} <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> medication prescribing in other Western Countries, including the UK. We measured trends and correlates of <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> medication prescribing in {{a subset of the}} older UK population (community/institutionalized) to inform harm minimization efforts. METHODS: Three cross-sectional samples from primary care electronic clinical records (UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink, CPRD) in fiscal years 2003 / 04, 2007 / 08 and 2011 / 12 were taken. This yielded a sample of 13, 900 people aged 65  years or over from 504 UK general practices. <b>High</b> <b>risk</b> medications were defined by 2012 Beers Criteria adapted for the UK. Using descriptive statistical methods and regression modelling, prevalence of 'any' (drugs prescribed at least once per year) and 'long-term' (drugs prescribed all quarters of year) <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> medication prescribing and correlates were determined. RESULTS: While polypharmacy rates have risen sharply, <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> medication prevalence has remained stable across a decade. A third of older (65 +) people are exposed to <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> medications, but only half of the total prevalence was long-term (any[*]=[*] 38. 4  % [95  % CI: 36. 3, 40. 5]; long-term[*]=[*] 17. 4  % [15. 9, 19. 9] in 2011 / 12). Long-term but not any <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> medication exposure was associated with older ages (85  years or over). Women and people with higher polypharmacy burden were at greater risk of exposure; lower socio-economic status was not associated. Ten drugs/drug classes accounted for most of <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> medication prescribing in 2011 / 12. CONCLUSIONS: <b>High</b> <b>risk</b> medication prescribing has not increased over time against a background of increasing polypharmacy in the UK. Half of patients receiving <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> medications do so for less than a year. Reducing or optimising the use of a limited number of drugs could dramatically reduce <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> medications in older people. Further research is needed to investigate why the oldest old and women are at greater risk. Interventions to reduce <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> medications may need to target shorter and long-term use separately...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Introduction & Objective: Brucellosis is a {{zoonotic}} disease {{that may have}} a major public health and economic impact in most countries. The disease appears as a Malt fever in humans and abortion in animals. This {{study was designed to}} determine the serologic titer of Brucella in <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> and non <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> people in Boyerahmad. Materials & Methods: A retrospective seroepidemiological study was performed on samples collected from 604 <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> and non <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> people using Rose Bengol test, tube standard test as a rapid test and 2 mercaptoethanol (2 ME) and comb's wright as a confirmatory test. The data collected were analyzed by X 2 test via SPSS. Results: Seroprevalence of Brucellosis in <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> people appeared to be high in the Rose Bengal and tube standard test (TST) 6. 62 at titer ≥ 1 / 40 whereas for non <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> it was 0 %. Confirmation test in <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> people was shown with 2 ME in four people. Conclusion: Brucellosis is a major cause of disease in <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> people which can be due to direct or indirect contact with diary products of the related animals...|$|R
50|$|<b>High</b> <b>Risk</b> was {{released}} in 2000 and {{is perhaps the most}} well recorded example of Luke's capabilities. <b>High</b> <b>Risk</b> was strongly supported by Dr Greg Finucane (Neuropsychiatrist) who is credited as Executive Producer and who was also a member of two bands 'The Clear' and 'Thin Red Line' previously. <b>High</b> <b>Risk</b> took 4 years to record and complete.

5|$|Preterm newborns {{are known}} to be at <b>higher</b> <b>risk</b> for bronchopulmonary {{dysplasia}} with extended exposure to high concentrations of oxygen. Other groups at <b>higher</b> <b>risk</b> for oxygen toxicity are patients on mechanical ventilation with exposure to levels of oxygen greater than 50%, and patients exposed to chemicals that increase risk for oxygen toxicity such the chemotherapeutic agent bleomycin. Therefore, current guidelines for patients on mechanical ventilation in intensive care recommends keeping oxygen concentration less than 60%. Likewise, divers who undergo treatment of decompression sickness are at increased risk of oxygen toxicity as treatment entails exposure to long periods of oxygen breathing under hyperbaric conditions, in addition to any oxygen exposure during the dive.|$|E
