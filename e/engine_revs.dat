25|$|The CSR, has {{a variety}} of other {{features}} which enhance its performance. There are no power brakes or power steering, making the CSR extremely responsive and extremely agile. The clutch also engages extremely high, allowing for quick shifts while racing. In addition, the flywheel is very light. This makes heel-and-toeing extremely quick and easy as the <b>engine</b> <b>revs</b> up very quickly with little momentum.|$|E
25|$|Another {{addition}} is the Media Nav system, already introduced {{earlier in}} the same year on the Lodgy, consisting of a 7-inch touchscreen display with multimedia functions and a navigation software included. Other new features are speed limiter, cruise control, rear parking sensors, and front and side airbags, as well as ABS and ESP, as standard. The interior has been significantly revised, with new chromed elements added, and the hood is now supported with a strut. A new Eco button, placed on the dashboard, limits the <b>engine</b> <b>revs</b> to 4,000 rpm.|$|E
25|$|The Williams team's {{decision}} {{to develop their}} new semi-automatic gearbox by racing with it {{at the start of}} the season, was at the cost of points in the opening rounds of the championship. Senna was on 40 points with four straight wins to open the season by the time Mansell gained his first finish with a second in Monaco. Mansell then had the next race in Canada practically won when his Williams FW14 stopped half a lap from the finish with what was reported to be transmission failure, though it was suspected that Mansell had let his <b>engine</b> <b>revs</b> drop too low while he was waving to the crowd in celebration and stalled his engine. Ironically this handed Nelson Piquet his 23rd and last F1 race win. Despite a good mid-season, which included a hat-trick of victories, Senna's consistency (and Mansell's retirements at key races) meant that he finished second in the Championship for the third time in his career, this time behind Senna.|$|E

2500|$|In a 2013 interview, Perkins {{claimed that}} the 1988 Tooheys 1000 was [...] "the one that got away", {{claiming}} that Walkinshaw had disobeyed orders regarding gear changes and <b>engine</b> <b>revs</b> which caused the cars failure on lap 137. However, had Perkins gone {{on to win the}} race, the #10 cars ultimate disqualification would have been a public relations disaster for Holden {{in the wake of the}} split with the Holden Dealer Team and its highly popular boss Peter Brock, and because the Holden VL Commodore SS Group A SV road car had been many months late in being released (it was actually released to the public after the VL models successor, the Holden VN Commodore had been released causing it to be already out of date). Critics generally believe that the cars failure to finish saved Holden from a public backlash at having a factory backed winning car disqualified from the countries highest profile domestic motor race.|$|E

5000|$|In 1977 the Pelland Mk II Steam Car was built, {{this time}} by Pelland Engineering in the UK. It had a three-cylinder {{double-acting}} engine in a 'broad-arrow' configuration, mounted in a tubular steel chassis with a Kevlar body, giving a gross weight of just 1050 lb. Uncomplicated and robust, the steam engine was claimed to give trouble-free, efficient performance. It had huge torque (...) at zero <b>engine</b> <b>revs,</b> and could accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in under 8 seconds.|$|E

50|$|When {{a car is}} {{in first}} gear, small {{variations}} in engine speed translate to large changes in acceleration and engine braking. However, {{with a combination of}} clutch control and careful use of engine speed, a much smoother ride can be achieved by allowing the clutch to slip. Variations in <b>engine</b> <b>revs</b> are not immediately translated into changes in drive shaft rotation speed, but rather the friction on the clutch plate allows the drive shaft to gradually equalize with the speed of the engine.|$|E
5000|$|The GV4s {{also became}} {{powerful}} enough to contest for overall wins in the 24 Hours of Le Mans, with Oreca Dallaras running the GV4 finishing fifth and sixth in [...] {{as well as an}} overall victory for Doran Lista at the Rolex 24 at Daytona the same year. The engine's reliability record at Le Mans was still patchy and, while it could challenge for pole in Domes and Dallaras, the <b>engine</b> <b>revs</b> had to be reduced to ensure it survived the race.|$|E
50|$|Wroooom is an onomatopoeia that {{represents}} {{the sound of an}} <b>engine</b> <b>revving</b> up. It also describes the act of purposefully operating a motor vehicle at high speeds so as to create loud engine noises. The word is a common early childhood sound, and is used in speech therapy techniques. It is also an example of a cross-linguistic onomatopoeia.|$|R
5000|$|The {{stories are}} set {{in the city of}} Birmingham, England, since in {{addition}} to its onomatopoeic nature of a car <b>engine</b> <b>revving,</b> [...] "Brum" [...] (as a contraction of [...] "Brummagem") is a common colloquial name for Birmingham.

50|$|One of Burden’s most {{reproduced}} and cited pieces, Trans-Fixed {{took place}} on April 23, 1974 at Speedway Avenue in Venice, California. For this performance, Burden lay face up on a Volkswagen Beetle and had nails hammered into both of his hands, {{as if he were}} being crucified on the car. The car was pushed out of the garage and the <b>engine</b> <b>revved</b> for two minutes before being pushed back into the garage.|$|R
50|$|Engine-driven {{fans are}} often {{regulated}} by a viscous-drive clutch from the drivebelt, which slips {{and reduces the}} fan speed at low temperatures. This improves fuel efficiency by not wasting power on driving the fan unnecessarily. On modern vehicles, further regulation of cooling rate is provided by either variable speed or cycling radiator fans. Electric fans are controlled by a thermostatic switch or the engine control unit. Electric fans also {{have the advantage of}} giving good airflow and cooling at low <b>engine</b> <b>revs</b> or when stationary, such as in slow-moving traffic.|$|E
50|$|Another {{addition}} is the Media Nav system, already introduced {{earlier in}} the same year on the Lodgy, consisting of a 7-inch touchscreen display with multimedia functions and a navigation software included. Other new features are speed limiter, cruise control, rear parking sensors, and front and side airbags, as well as ABS and ESP, as standard. The interior has been significantly revised, with new chromed elements added, and the hood is now supported with a strut. A new Eco button, placed on the dashboard, limits the <b>engine</b> <b>revs</b> to 4,000 rpm.|$|E
50|$|Under the bonnet {{only the}} {{original}} engine block and head must remain from the production car but <b>engine</b> <b>revs</b> {{are limited to}} 8500 RPM to aid reliability and reduce costs. Racing transmissions and suspensions could be incorporated, but the suspension had to remain true to the original design of the road going model. Closer racing was also engineered into the rules by having different weight limits for front- and rear-wheel drive, and by limiting overall wheel and tyre sizes and by restricting each car to only six tyres per event.|$|E
5000|$|The Advance V4 {{aero engine}} {{was made from}} two V-twin engines bolted {{together}} back-to-back. One of the engines would have been running backwards {{and it is not}} known how the crankshafts were joined. The carburettor was a Brown & Barlow type 65DU or GU as used by cars of the time and fed a one-into-two-into-four manifold. With an output of [...] and a capacity of 2290 cc, the flywheel was 9.25 in in diameter and weighed 36 lb. The <b>engine</b> <b>revved</b> to 1,800 rpm.|$|R
25|$|Variable-geometry or variable-nozzle turbochargers use {{moveable}} vanes {{to adjust}} the air-flow to the turbine, imitating a turbocharger of the optimal size throughout the power curve. The vanes are placed {{just in front of}} the turbine like a set of slightly overlapping walls. Their angle is adjusted by an actuator to block or increase air flow to the turbine. This variability maintains a comparable exhaust velocity and back pressure throughout the <b>engine’s</b> <b>rev</b> range. The result is that the turbocharger improves fuel efficiency without a noticeable level of turbocharger lag.|$|R
