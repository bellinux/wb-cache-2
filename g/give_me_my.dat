500|$|It topped several [...] "best {{episode of}} 2010" [...] lists, {{including}} Den of Geek, <b>Give</b> <b>Me</b> <b>My</b> Remote, and TV.com. Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly named [...] "Entrada" [...] the fifth best {{episode of the}} series, calling it [...] "the sensational climax to season 3's sensational Olivia/Fauxlivia parallel universe interplay, which seemed {{to bring out the}} best in both the writers of Fringe as well as its actors, especially Anna Torv, who rocked the tricky material and created a convincingly distinct and unique doppelganger iteration of Olivia. She deserved an Emmy nomination for her work this season. Oh, well." ...|$|E

[...] Beyoncé and her production quickly organized the show in seven days, based on a script provided by filmmaker Matthew Dickens. She often rehearsed during sound checks of her 2009 tour.|$|E

500|$|<b>Give</b> <b>Me</b> <b>My</b> Remote {{listed the}} episode {{as the third}} best episode of Veronica Mars, writing [...] "everything about this episode is superb, from the plotlines, to the stunts, and the performances. Kristen Bell, in particular, churned out gut- wrenching, Emmy- worthy scenes." [...] IGN ranked the episode as the best episode of Veronica Mars, writing [...] "Once you realize Aaron is the one, you're glued to your seat {{for the rest of}} the episode, {{possibly}} hiding behind a blanket.

[...] On a similar list, TV Line ranked the episode as the fourth best episode of the show.|$|E

He highlighted Pam's prank as well as Michael's attempt to break up with Jan via voicemail, calling the latter [...] "easily the funniest moment in the episode, and perfectly played by both Steve Carell and Melora Hardin." [...] Zoromski did however criticize the series for abandoning plot points, such as the publicity fiasco from the previous episode. <b>Give</b> <b>Me</b> <b>My</b> Remote's Kath Skerry called it a [...] "hilarious episode," [...] and observed [...] "I don’t think The Office has ever pushed the envelope in terms of sexual discussion {{as much as it}} did tonight." ...|$|E

[...] She again expressed her dislike for Karen, but thought it [...] "was a fun episode for my two favorite Dunder Mifflin couples: Ryan & Kelly and Dwight & Angela." [...] Entertainment Weekly columnist Abby West enjoyed the Dwight-Angela scenes, asserting that [...] "some of the best moments on screen are when those two let their freak flags fly." [...] For his work on this episode, Michael Schur received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series, but lost to Greg Daniels for his work on [...] "Gay Witch Hunt".|$|E
500|$|Writing for AOL TV, Michael Sciannamea thought [...] "The Convict" [...] seemed {{different}} from previous episodes, citing as evidence {{the scene of}} Michael and Martin discussing trustworthy black men; Sciannamea attributed this to its guest writers: [...] "I don't think Gervais and Merchant went over the top...it just seemed {{a little different than}} the others." [...] Also in his review, Sciannamea expressed his gradual enjoyment of Andy, [...] "When I first saw him up in Stamford, I thought he was just the Connecticut version of Dwight. But now I think he adds greatly to the mix and is definitely one who is going to stir things up in Scranton." [...] <b>Give</b> <b>Me</b> <b>My</b> Remote's Kath Skerry believed [...] "the uncomfortable, unbearably awkward moments that the UK version perfected are definitely present throughout the episode."

Likewise, <b>Give</b> <b>Me</b> <b>My</b> Remote contributor Marisa Rothman ranked [...] "The Day We Died" [...] one of the best episodes of the year, explaining [...] "Between Walter's eventual reunion with his loved ones and Olivia's tragic demise, few episodes were as heartbreaking as 'The Day We Died'...not to mention, no episode shocked me as much with a plot twist. (I literally bolted up in my seat when Peter vanished into thin air after creating a bridge between the universes.)" [...] Entertainment Weekly included the episode's ending in their list of television's best cliffhangers of 2011, and later named it the sixteenth best episode of the series.

[...] BuzzFeed called the episode the best episode of the series, stating, [...] "It's {{extremely}} violent, extremely scary, and extremely moving. If you don't cry watching this episode, there's a tiny little rock where your heart should be." [...] On a similar list, TV Line ranked the episode third, only behind [...] "A Trip to the Dentist" [...] and [...] "Pilot". <b>Give</b> <b>Me</b> <b>My</b> Remote also ranked the episode as the best of the series, writing, [...] "If I had to pick a single episode to represent the show, this would be it.

500|$|Kath Skerry of <b>Give</b> <b>Me</b> <b>My</b> Remote called Dwight's groveling [...] "hilarious," [...] but {{was unsure}} about Jim and Karen's ending scene, {{explaining}} that it [...] "was adorable. Too adorable. And I’m {{not quite ready}} to handle the fact that I’m not HATING the idea of Jim and Karen. I feel like I’m betraying Pam. I’m still a JAM shipper all the way, but it’s nice to see Jim smile again." [...] Skerry concluded that [...] "there were some seriously funny, laugh out loud moments tonight, but I don’t think this episode {{is going to make}} my favorites list. But even when The Office isn’t at its best, it’s still hands down the best comedy on TV." [...] Television Without Pity graded the episode with an A-. In the audio commentary, Wilson noted that [...] "The Coup" [...] is [...] "not a fan favorite," [...] though it was submitted for an Emmy Award.

500|$|E! {{reacted to}} the scene by writing, [...] "We seemed to {{experience}} the same whirlwind of emotions they did: The hesitance, the shock, the elation, the weirdness of how right it felt, and then, of course, the inevitable 'Oh crap, what did we just do and what does this mean?' awkwardness of it all. They, and the show, {{would never be the}} same. In the best way possible." [...] Buzzfeed ranked the episode as the 4th best Veronica Mars episode, behind [...] "A Trip to the Dentist", [...] "Leave It to Beaver", and [...] "Not Pictured." [...] TV Line ranked the episode 6th on a similar list. <b>Give</b> <b>Me</b> <b>My</b> Remote ranked [...] "Weapons of Class Destruction" [...] as the fifth best episode of Veronica Mars, particularly noting the kiss scene between Logan and Veronica. [...] "Veronica kisses Logan in a scene that was full of so much chemistry that it gave me chills.

Veronica and Logan had finally realized that their chemistry was undeniable!" ...|$|E
500|$|<b>Give</b> <b>Me</b> <b>My</b> Remote writer Kath Skerry {{liked the}} cast's scenes with the sumo suits, but saved {{most of her}} praise for Pam's speech. She {{declared}} that it [...] "was AMAZING. Jenna Fischer blew me away with that speech. It’s what I have been hoping for since the first episode of this season. It didn’t end with Jim swooping in and kissing Pam but there’s still one episode left in the season. So that’s {{what we have to}} ponder over the next week." [...] Jay Black of AOLTV also enjoyed the episode. He wrote, [...] "I thought that it was a bit more low key than some of the previous episodes (hilarious sumo outfits not withstanding) and that suited me just fine. I thought that Michael's ridiculousness, always a difficult balancing act, was reigned-in to just this side of believable where it belongs. I thought that it was filled with a great assortment of gags, both character-based and farcical." [...] However, Black was critical of Pam's speech because it felt both [...] "forced" [...] and out of character for Pam to publicly state her feelings.|$|E

Collingwood's dispatches about the battle were carried to England aboard , and when the news arrived in London, a messenger was sent to Merton Place to bring the news of Nelson's death to Emma Hamilton. She later recalled, They brought me word, Mr Whitby from the Admiralty. [...] "Show him in directly", I said.

500|$|Feminism {{academic}} Camille Paglia {{said that}} she used to be transfixed by this [...] "temperamental diva bitch", due to the contrast with the ideal of womanhood that she had been presented to as a child: [...] "Mary, this silent mother; and here was the witch queen who has this weird dialogue in the mirror and it didn't have to be charitable and it didn't have to be nice. I thought she was fabulous." [...] Likewise, Lana Parrilla, who later herself played the Evil Queen in Once Upon A Time, said that whenever she watched Disney's Snow White as a young girl she rooted for and [...] "loved the evil queen―every time the evil queen came on, I was like 'OK!' She was just so fascinating to me."
