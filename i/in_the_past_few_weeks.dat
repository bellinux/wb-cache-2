[...] The article described a rumour that had been circulating on campus that Paul was dead. At that point, the rumour included numerous clues from recent Beatles albums, including a message, interpreted as [...] "turn me on, dead man", that is heard when [...] "Revolution 9" [...] (from the White Album) is played backwards. In wire reports published as early as 11 October, Beatles press officer Derek Taylor responded to the rumour saying, [...] "Recently we've been getting a flood of inquiries asking about reports that Paul is dead. We've been getting questions like that for years, of course, but <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> we've been getting them at the office and home night and day.

60|$|He broke off. This was not {{the first}} time he had caught himself forgetting how his {{circumstances}} had changed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks.</b> It was ridiculous to be telling hard-luck stories about not being able to buy a farm, when he had the wherewithal to buy dozens of farms.

Then he noticed that a buggy was approaching from the opposite direction, and when he reached the homestead a man in white shirt and store clothes had just pulled up his horse.

Often and often <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks,</b> ever since her father had formally betrothed her to Victor de Marmont, she had thought of this coming morning, and steeled herself to be brave against the fateful day. She had been resigned to the decree {{of the father and}} to the necessities of family and name--resigned but terribly heartsore. She was obeying of her own free will but not blindly. She knew that her marriage to a man whom she did not love was a sacrifice on her part of every hope of future happiness. Her girlish love for St. Genis had opened her eyes to the possibilities of happiness; she knew that Life could hold out a veritable cornucopia of delight and joy in a union which was hallowed by Love, and her ready sacrifice was therefore all the greater, all the more sublime, because it was not offered up in ignorance.|$|E
