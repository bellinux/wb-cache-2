30|$|Enginalp {{and other}} respondents’ {{practical}} and symbolic neighborhood use {{is directed to}} {{other places in the}} city, mostly ethnically diverse neighborhoods. Ferda has moved from the ethnically diverse inner-city area of Kreuzberg to a residential area in Berlin’s South-West, to find a better school for her children (Barwick, 2016). She never really warmed up to the new neighborhood and neighbors, and spends much of her free-time in <b>her</b> old <b>neighborhood,</b> where she wants to move back to as soon as her youngest child leaves primary school. Ferda highly appreciates <b>her</b> old <b>neighborhood,</b> particularly that life takes place outside in the streets and you always meet people you know and can chat with. This is a public familiarity she does not find in <b>her</b> own <b>neighborhood</b> of residence. Due to experiences of exclusion and marginalization in predominantly white neighborhoods, these second-generation Turks thus develop a feeling of belonging to neighborhoods other than their own.|$|R

500|$|Another {{factor in}} {{not having a}} studio {{attached}} before was Atchison's desire to direct it as he wanted to ensure his story would remain the one he envisioned.
