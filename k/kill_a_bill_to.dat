In one incident, he <b>killed</b> <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> <b>to</b> sentence convicted communists to the death penalty by inserting a poison pill amendment to sentence those who were only suspected of communism to life imprisonment.

500|$|The {{original}} planning maps plotted {{the first}} turnpike {{to the west}} of Detroit, running near US24 (Telegraph Road). This route was later proposed for I-75 itself; I-275 would have been the freeway to loop into downtown Detroit. [...] The proposed length was increased by December 1955; the extended Michigan Turnpike would have run from a connection across the Ohio state line to Toledo north through Detroit and Saginaw and eventually to {{the southern end of the}} Mackinac Bridge. By the following April, any extensions were cancelled leaving the turnpike to its original termini; the east–west companion road was also cancelled at that time. The MTA proposed a state constitutional amendment in January 1956 that would allow the Michigan Legislature to issue state-guaranteed bonds for part of the MTA's construction expenses. According to The Wall Street Journal, the authority [...] "struggled for survival" [...] in the face of opposition from the MSHD just two months later; the department's actions impaired the authority's appropriations from the state legislature and its ability to sell the necessary bonds to pay for construction. When the federal government approved the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956, Ziegler and the MSHD announced plans for a full freeway to run north through the Lower Peninsula and continue across to the Upper Peninsula. This announcement undermined the efforts to build the Michigan Turnpike. By August 1956, the MTA voted to reduce its operations to a skeleton staff, but moved forward in May 1957 on a bond sale to finance construction of the roadway. Financiers stated such a sale was only feasible if the turnpike was to be safe from competition. The Michigan Townships Association called for the abolition of the MTA in 1958. The legislature <b>killed</b> <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> <b>to</b> do so in June 1959, but it later voted to repeal the act that created the authority in 1962.|$|R
5000|$|After {{the death}} of President pro tem John Raines {{near the end of}} the {{previous}} year, it became necessary for the Republican majority to elect a successor. The majority of the Republican state senators met in caucus on January 4, 1910, and chose Allds who was supported by the Republican party machine. Seven state senators, allied with reform governor Charles Evans Hughes and objecting to Allds, met separately at the Ten Eyck Hotel in Albany, New York. At this meeting, State Senator Benn Conger told his fellow senators that he had paid Allds a bribe of $1000 in 1901, when both had been assemblymen and Allds was the Majority Leader of the State Assembly, <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> objected <b>to</b> by bridge construction companies in which Conger was interested. On January 5, Allds was chosen President pro tempore and Majority Leader of the State Senate. Shortly afterwards the Conger's statement about the bribe was leaked to the press, but Conger then denied having paid the bribe himself. On January 20, the State Senate appointed a Committee on Plan and Scope (three senators: Brackett, Grady and Meade) to decide on how to proceed. The committee decided to investigate only this one charge and hear testimony before the full senate. On January 30, Conger filed the accusation before the State Senate, stating that Allds had [...] "demanded, received and accepted $1,000 on or about April 23, 1901, in consideration for his failure <b>to</b> pass <b>a</b> certain <b>bill</b> then pending before the Assembly." [...] On February 3, Allds answered the accusation with a denial. Hiram G. Moe testified before the State Senate on February 8 and 9 that he had handed over the envelope containing the money. On February 23, Allds resigned the Presidency pro tempore, and on March 11 George H. Cobb was chosen to succeed. On March 29, the State Senate found Allds guilty by a vote of 40 to 9, but Allds had resigned just before the begin of the session to avoid expulsion. On April 4, Conger also resigned his seat, and retired from politics. Allds died of liver disease at Norwich Memorial Hospital in Norwich, N.Y., in 1923.|$|R
