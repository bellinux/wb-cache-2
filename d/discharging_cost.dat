40|$|The {{contribution}} of vehicle-to-grid to balance fluctuating generation: Comparing different battery ageing approaches Abstract-This paper analyzes how energy throughput {{and depth of}} discharge-based battery ageing affects vehicle-to-grid operation of plug-in electric vehi-cles. Plug-in electric vehicles are discussed as a grid resource to balance the fluctuating electricity generation of renewable energy sources, but their contri-bution to balance fluctuating generation strongly depends on battery ageing and costs to feed back electricity. Therefore, an electricity system scenario with a very high share of wind and solar generation for Germany 2030 is analyzed fo-cusing on different battery cost scenarios and ageing assumptions for plug- in vehicle batteries. The agent-based approach used renders price-based control with vehicle specific dispatch decision possible.

40|$|China has {{modified}} its {{pollution control}} policy system with such price tools as the pollution charge (PC) {{policy and the}} payment for initial emission allowance (PIEA) policy. The aim of PC policy is {{to compensate for the}} environment damage caused by pollutants, while PIEA {{is in charge of the}} initial emission allowance (IEA) within the emission trading system (ETS). However, since the implementation of PIEA, it has been criticized as redundant because of the similar pricing scheme with the PC. In addition, the existing PIEA pricing approaches have ignored interactions with other policies, such as PC and total emission control (TEC) policies. In this research, we established an optimal control-based model with chemical oxygen demand (COD) and ammoniacal nitrogen (NH 3 -N), two independent pollutants variables, to simulate the water pollutants' PIEA price. Simulation results indicated that emission quantity and optimal social benefit in the PC–PIEA combination scenario was equal to the situation in the PIEA scenario. Under this design, PC compensated for the emission damage, and PIEA paid for the scarcity rent, while PIEA does not duplicate the PC policy. In addition, the PIEA policy has a complex effect on pollutant emission. Because PIEA policy increases the enterprises' <b>discharging</b> <b>cost,</b> most regions' COD emissions are less than the baseline, excepting Beijing, Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Shandong, and Guangdong, in which emission quantities are greater than the baseline. The NH 3 -N emission shows an opposite trend. The simulation result is that excluding Inner Mongolia, Hubei, Hunan, Tibet, Gansu, Qinghai, Ningxia, and Xinjiang, the NH 3 -N emissions in the rest of regions are increased. TEC policy has a significant effect on pollutant emissions and the PIEA price. The COD emission quantity with TEC is lower than that without the TEC policy, therefore, the TEC policy will be effective for pollutant emission control. The pollutant beyond the restricted target will be charged a payment for IEA at a higher price than without the TEC policy...|$|E

30|$|Figure  5 {{illustrates}} {{the outcomes of}} active management with S 1 that the charging process of PEV is non-interruptible, and it starts to charge whenever arriving if needed. There are 694 PEVs to be charged during the dispatching horizon in this case. As shown in Fig.  5, the charging load grows {{with more and more}} PEVs to be pluged in when people arrive home from work, and it is not until time period 16 : 00 – 17 : 00, when the load demand is larger than the forecasted PV generation, there is no curtaiment in PV generation. The power purchased from the upper grid increases from time period 15 : 00 – 16 : 00 and eventually becomes the dominate power source, with the PV generation decreases to zero gradually due to getting dark. And from the time period 7 : 00 – 8 : 00 in Day 2, the power purchased from the upper grid decreases for the power generated by PV increases. In the intelligent charging mode, when S 2 is adopted, the charging load of PEVs is distributed among the dispatching horizons, as shown in Fig.  6. And the power purchased from the upper grid is altered as well, which has a smaller peak compared with S 1. The economic benefit obtained is 166695 Yuan, and 4  % more than that in S 1, as shown in Table  2. The scenario is illustrated in Fig.  7 when the discharging mode is considered. There are 747 PEVs involved in the active management process, and an obvious pattern, that the equivalent charging process moves to the midnight and the next early morning when the residential load and electricity price are low, can be observed in Fig.  7. The price purchasing power the upper grid from time 17 : 00 to 24 : 00 is higher than <b>discharging</b> <b>cost,</b> so PEVs are scheduled to discharge to compensate the peak load without violating the constraints of the PEVs.

We compared VA costs to community rehabilitation hospitals using a sample from the Uniform Data System for Medical Rehabilitation of 190, 112 patients discharged in 1999 from 697 facilities. LOS was a strong predictor of cost for VA and non-VA hospitals. Functional status, measured by Functional Independence Measure (FIM) scores at admission, was statistically significant but added little explanatory value after controlling for LOS. Although FIM scores were associated with LOS, FIM scores accounted for little variance in cost after controlling for LOS. These results are most applicable to researchers conducting cost-effectiveness analyses. ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThere are {{varieties}} of constraints for a short-term scheduling problem {{of crude oil}} operations in a refinery. These constraints are difficult to model and complicate the short-term scheduling problem. Among them, oil residency time and high fusion point crude oil transportation constraints are the challenging ones. With high setup cost for high fusion point oil transportation, it is desired that the volume of high fusion point oil can be transported {{as much as possible}} by a single setup. This may result in late transportation of other types of crude oil, leading to the violation of crude oil residency time constraint. These constraints are ignored by existing methods in the literature. To solve this problem, this paper studies the problem in a control theory perspective by viewing an operation decision in the schedule as a control. With this idea, the system is modeled by a hybrid Petri net. With this model and tank grouping strategy, schedulability analysis is carried out and schedulability conditions are presented with tank charging and <b>discharging</b> <b>costs</b> being taken into consideration. These conditions are necessary for determining a refining schedule and can be used to check whether a target-refining schedule is realizable or not.

We also aimed to compare costs for the two strategies. Methods: The study was a systematic review and a meta-analysis of 12 randomized controlled trials including 2962 patients, followed by trial sequential analysis. An estimation of cost was considered. Follow-up time was 30  days. Results: For early discharge, pooled effect for the composite endpoint was relative risk of efficacy (RRe) = 0. 65, 95 % confidence interval (CI) (0. 52 – 0. 81). Rehospitalization had a pooled effect of RRe= 1. 10, 95 % CI (0. 88 – 1. 38).

40|$|Aim: Although {{working life}} issues {{are subject to}} European health {{monitoring}} schemes, not many routine data sources include information on occupations or working conditions. Additional in-depth analysis is therefore necessary for diseases with high public health impact. The aim {{of this paper is}} to introduce a multidimensional ranking procedure for priority setting of diseases based on European and national data. Subject and methods: Multidimensional ranking was carried out on ten disease-specific indicators. First, suitable data sources were identified and information on indicators was retrieved. Second, the diseases were sorted by their ranks according to each indicator. Third, all ranks were added to a rank sum. Finally, the diseases were sorted by their rank sum. Results: Diseases of the circulatory system account for the highest rank sum. The high public health impact is visible in regard to most criteria, particularly to mortality, hospital <b>discharges,</b> and <b>costs.</b> Diseases of the digestive system rank second mainly because of high ranks for hospital <b>discharges</b> and <b>costs.</b> The third place is assigned to diseases of the musculoskeletal system. Conclusion: A multidimensional ranking procedure has advantages when used for priority setting of diseases. The procedure leads to an overall rank as a summary measure for the public health impact but information for each indicator is still retrieved.
