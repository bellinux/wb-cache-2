The formation energies of defects are obtained according to the elemental chemical potentials which are determined by the phase stability conditions. The most stable self-interstitials are all found in the hexahedral position surrounded by two Ti(2) and three Si atoms. For the entire elemental chemical potential range considered, our results demonstrated that Si and C related defects, including vacancies, interstitials and <b>Frenkel</b> <b>defects</b> are the most dominant defects. Besides, the present calculations also reveal that the formation energies of C and Si <b>Frenkel</b> <b>defects</b> are much lower than those of all Schottky defects considered.

We have classified the possible <b>Frenkel</b> <b>defects</b> in a metastable monatomic quasicrystal with respect to geometric and energetic properties. With numerical simulation we have studied the behaviour of the quasicrystal under a load of <b>Frenkel</b> <b>defects</b> for various defect concentrations. We find three ranges of behaviour: up to 5 % defects per atom the structure remains icosahedral, in a middle range it stays disordered icosahedral or it becomes either disordered or perfect crystalline, depending on the implementation of the defects. If there are more than 10 % defects the structure becomes irreversibly amorphous. We finally compare our results with experimental data...|$|R
50|$|Similarly to a Schottky defect, a <b>Frenkel</b> <b>defect</b> is an {{intrinsic}} point defect {{that produces a}} vacancy site on either the cation or anion sublattice along with an interstitial site on that same lattice.

50|$|There {{are several}} {{possible}} scenarios {{for the energy}} of PKAs, and these lead to different forms of damage. In the case of electron or gamma ray bombardment, the PKA usually does not have sufficient energy to displace more atoms. The resulting damage consists of a random distribution of <b>Frenkel</b> <b>defects,</b> usually with a distance {{no more than four}} or five interatomic distances between the interstitial and vacancy. When PKAs receive energy greater than Ed from bombarding electrons, they are able to displace more atoms, and some of the <b>Frenkel</b> <b>defects</b> become groups of interstitial atoms with corresponding vacancies, within a few interatomic distances of each other. In the case of bombardment by fast-moving atoms or ions, groups of vacancies and interstitial atoms widely separated along the track of the atom or ion are produced. As the atom slows down, the cross section for producing PKAs increases, resulting in groups of vacancies and interstitials concentrated {{at the end of the}} track.|$|R

The goal of the project was to study the effect of <b>Frenkel</b> <b>defects</b> in silicon(Si), zinc sulphide(ZnS) and gallium phosphide(GaP). The research was based on a theoretical model(computer model) of a lattice. The model was a program written in Fortran 77. The program was written so that it could simulate a crystal lattice structure where the size of the lattice and density of defects could be changed and the perturbation due to the defects can be calculated. This main objective of this thesis is to study the effect of these defects on the energy band structure of extrinsic Si, ZnS and GaP assuming that all the donor levels were shallow donors. The basis for the thesis is laid by reviewing the theory of the effective mass approximation of shallow donor states, energy of formation of <b>Frenkel</b> <b>defects</b> and finally running the program for different parameters such as concentration of defects, size of lattice and type of material.

50|$|The atoms that do {{not find}} a vacancy come to rest in non-ideal locations; that is, not along the {{symmetrical}} lines of the lattice. These atoms {{are referred to as}} interstitial atoms, or simply interstitials. An interstitial atom and its associated vacancy are known as a <b>Frenkel</b> <b>defect.</b> Because these atoms are not in the ideal location, they have an energy associated with them, much as a ball {{at the top of a}} hill has gravitational potential energy. This energy is referred to as Wigner energy. When a large number of interstitials have accumulated, they pose a risk of releasing all of their energy suddenly, creating a rapid, very great increase in temperature. Sudden, unplanned increases in temperature can present a large risk for certain types of nuclear reactors with low operating temperatures; one such was the indirect cause of the Windscale fire. Accumulation of energy in irradiated graphite has been recorded as high as 2.7 kJ/g, but is typically much lower than this. Graphite, having a heat capacity of 0.720 J/g°C, could see a sudden increase in temperature of about 3750 °C (6780 °F).|$|E

Vacancy, interstitial, Schottky and <b>Frenkel</b> <b>defects</b> were considered. Rock salt PbO was included for comparison.
