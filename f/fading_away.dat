5|$|By 1949 Swift was 35 years old, but {{was still}} {{performing}} well enough to maintain {{his place in the}} England team. However, he decided that he wanted to retire while still capable of playing at the top level, rather than <b>fading</b> <b>away.</b> To this end he announced that he would retire {{at the end of the}} 1948–49 season. He made what he intended to be his last Manchester City appearance against Huddersfield Town on 7 May, which was followed by a parade in his honour organised by the Supporters' Club. However, just before the next season started, Swift's replacement Alec Thurlow fell ill with tuberculosis, and Swift agreed to step in until City found a new goalkeeper. Four further appearances took his career total to 338. Aware of attempts by other clubs to tempt Swift out of retirement, most notably by Manchester United, the Manchester City board continued to hold Swift's playing registration for several years.|$|E

Nowe and Gismor battle, and Gismor is wounded again, {{transforming}} into a shadow-like being and using Eris to block Nowe's final attack. Believing Eris dead, Nowe and Manah pursue Gismore, but are met by Seere, who unsuccessfully tries to stop them. When they confront Gismor, he reveals {{himself to be a}} vindictive survivor of the Empire from eighteen years before. Defeated, Gismor destroys the final seal himself, releasing Angelus from her imprisonment. After Seere reveals the true consequences of Manah's actions, Nowe and Legna pursue Angelus. When they find her, they find that Angelus has been driven mad by the pain of being the final seal. Caim asks them to kill her, and as she dies, he and Angelus share a final moment together before <b>fading</b> <b>away.</b> With the seals destroyed, the world begins to fall into chaos and Manah is driven mad by the memories of her actions eighteen years before. Legna then takes Nowe to the fortress of the holy dragons, where they hear a prophecy concerning Nowe: according to the prophecy, Nowe is a New Breed created to aid the dragons in their war against the Watchers. Nowe then reunites with Eris, who had been healed by Seere, and frees Manah from her madness. Legna then takes the three to the Promised Land, a dragon stronghold that holds the Bone Casket, an object given to the dragons by and imbued with the power of the Watchers that can speed up Nowe's evolution into the New Breed. It is also where Seere has gone to initiate a new Goddess of the Seal. The game has three endings, each achieved on a separate playthrough.|$|E

Ludlow took on a position as an associate editor at Vanity Fair, a magazine which at the time resembled Punch in tone. It was probably through the Vanity Fair staff that Ludlow was introduced to the New York City bohemian and literary culture, centered around Pfaff’s beer cellar on Broadway and Saturday night gatherings at Richard Henry Stoddard’s home. This scene attracted the likes of Walt Whitman, Fitz James O’Brien, Bayard Taylor, Thomas Bailey Aldrich, Edmund Clarence Stedman, and Artemus Ward.|$|E
25|$|As {{had been}} feared, the President of France, Charles de Gaulle, vetoed Britain's {{application}} for admission to the EEC on 14 January 1963, citing the Nassau Agreement {{as one of the}} main reasons.

Ground colour is uniformly whitish-corneous, the upper whorls are lighter, with four spiral light chestnut-brown bands, a small one below the white-lined suture, two broader ones {{above and below the}} periphery (which in some specimens are faintly subdivided into two equally broad bands) and a fourth band encircling the umbilicus. The surface is lustreless, with growth striae and spiral lines of fine, punctuate granulation, starting shallowly on the postnepionic whorl, but becoming rapidly more conspicuous on the following and <b>fading</b> <b>away</b> inside the umbilicus. The protoconch is pit-reticulate. The shell has 6.3 whorls that are somewhat convex. The last whorl is saccate. The suture is impressed, somewhat crenulate, at the aperture ascending in front.

The aperture is 1.30 times as long as wide, 0.70 times the total height. The peristome is broadly expanded and backwardly reflexed, glossy whitish. Columellar margin is straight, broadly expanded and merging into the rather thick parietal callus.|$|E
25|$|After the breakstrain, {{the trio}} is heard again, either {{for one last}} time or and the 2nd (or third) time. If the trio after the breakstrain is the last, it is usually played in the same style as the first trio. Sometimes this trio has added counter-melodies or obbligatos. After this trio, the breakstrain is played again, then moves on to the final trio. The final trio {{is known as the}} grandioso. It is {{typically}} much louder than the previous playing(s) of the trio and utilizes all sections of the band, bringing everything to a close. The grandioso is considered the most exciting section of the march and serves the purpose of instilling the trio melody into the mind of the listener. The grandioso sometimes adds yet another counter-melody or obbligato, such as the one in Stars and Stripes Forever. The last measure of the march sometimes contains a stinger, a I chord played in unison on the upbeat after a quarter rest. Most, but not all, marches carry a stinger; the Semper Fidelis march is a famous march not to have an ending stinger (when not recapitulated {{back to the beginning of}} the march – see below). Most marches end at the volume forte (loud), but an example that doesn't is Sousa's Manhattan Beach, which ends <b>fading</b> <b>away.</b>|$|E
