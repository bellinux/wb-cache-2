500|$|In an {{interview}} for USA Today, D'Angelo said of the album's title and its meaning, [...] "the myriad influences found on it can be traced through the blues and back deeper in history through songs sung–in religious [...] ceremonies." [...] In {{an interview}} for Jet magazine, he stated that his intentions for recording the album were to express the power of music and artistic respect for it. The theme is illustrated in Voodoos liner photography by Thierry LesGoudes, which depicts D'Angelo participating in a voodoo ceremony. Voodoos press release discussed D'Angelo's concept, stating [...] "Lyrically, D'Angelo offers that much of Voodoo is personal reflection: touching on subjects like spirituality, sexuality, growth, and in particular, becoming a father. Musically, as he puts it, Voodoo is 'definitely groove-based'". D'Angelo also said that [...] "My inspiration was <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> farther. To get to that next level. To push it even further. To work against the floss and the grain and to get even deeper into the sound that I'm hearing ... and the thing is, I'm just looking at Voodoo as just the beginning. I'm still developing and growing and still listening to that sound I hear inside my head ... So {{this is the first}} step".|$|E

500|$|The {{controversy}} surrounding Manhunt reached a peak on July 28, 2004, {{when the game}} {{was linked to the}} murder of 14-year-old Stefan Pakeerah by his 17-year-old friend Warren Leblanc in Leicestershire, England. Initial media reports claimed that police had found a copy of the game in Leblanc's bedroom, which police had seized as evidence, and Giselle Pakeerah, the victim's mother, stated [...] "I think that I heard some of Warren's friends say that he was obsessed by this game. To quote from the website that promotes it, it calls it a psychological experience, not a game, and it encourages brutal killing. If he was obsessed by it, it could well be that the boundaries for him became quite hazy." [...] Stefan's father, Patrick, added [...] "they were playing a game called Manhunt. The way Warren committed the murder this is how the game is set out, killing people using weapons like hammers and knives. There is some connection between the game and what he has done." [...] Patrick continued [...] "The object of Manhunt is not <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> out and kill people. It's a point-scoring game where you increase your score depending on how violent the killing is. That explains why Stefan's murder was as horrific as it was. If these games influence kids to go out and kill, then we do not want them in the shops." [...] A spokesman for the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers' Association (ELSPA) responded to the accusations by stating [...] "We sympathize enormously with the family and parents of Stefan Pakeerah. However, we reject any suggestion or association between the tragic events and the sale of the video game Manhunt. The game in question is classified 18 by the British Board of Film Classification and therefore its copies should not be in the possession of a minor. Simply being in someone's possession does not and should not lead to the conclusion that a game is responsible for these tragic events." ...|$|E
2500|$|It was {{announced}} in April 2008 {{that all of the}} original cast (except Kaya Scodelario and Lisa Backwell) would be replaced for series 3. Elsley said: [...] "There are risks associated with dumping a cast, but we just did it. There was some disquiet at the channel, but then they told us <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> with it." [...] Speaking at Broadcast's television drama conference, he also confirmed the show would stick to its pattern of introducing college-age characters, moving them on in the next series, then letting them go. [...] "The first year is about getting to know the kids, and the second gives us the advantage of being able to explore their psyches a little more," [...] said Elsley. Brittain said that the new cast would be quite different from the original characters, although people may still spot some similarities. Open auditions for the second generation of cast members were held in Bristol, which attracted 1,500 16- to 18-year-olds, followed by a further two days of auditions in London.|$|E
2500|$|The nadir came in 1941, {{when the}} Phillies {{finished}} with a ghastly 43–111 record, setting a franchise record for losses in a season. [...] A year later, they needed an advance from the league <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to spring training. [...] Nugent realized he didn't {{have enough money to}} operate the team in 1943, and put it up for sale. [...] He found a willing buyer in minor-league executive Bill Veeck, who had the intention of stocking it with Negro League stars. [...] Unfortunately for Veeck, when Baseball Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis, an ardent segregationist, found out about it, he pressured National League president Ford Frick to have the league take over the Phillies. [...] The story was initially challenged by a 1998 article in the Society for American Baseball Research's The National Pastime, arguing that Philadelphia's black press made no mention of a sale to Veeck. [...] However, in 2006, Jules Tygiel published an article in the 2006 edition of Baseball Research Journal which proved Veeck indeed planned to buy the Phillies. [...] He expanded on it in an appendix, entitled [...] "Did Bill Veeck Lie About His Plan to Purchase the ’43 Phillies?," [...] published in Paul Dickson's biography, Bill Veeck: Baseball's Greatest Maverick. Joseph Thomas Moore wrote in his biography of Doby, [...] "Bill Veeck planned to buy the Philadelphia Phillies with the as yet unannounced intention of breaking that color line." ...|$|E
