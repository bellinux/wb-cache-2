40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} {{implications}} of Narcissism, Machiavellianism and psychopathic personality traits on leaders' preferences in <b>followers.</b> The research was conducted {{from the perspective of}} leaders who possess any of these dark personalities and their preferences in <b>followers.</b> This research gives <b>followers</b> a sense of what to expect if confronted with a situation in which a system is run a by a leader who possesses any of these three dark personality traits. The results indicated that Narcissistic leaders with a dominant sub characteristic of selfishness prefer <b>followers</b> who are achievers, proficient and ambitious. Narcissists who like authority prefer dependable, team players and proficient <b>followers.</b> Narcissists who like to show off prefer <b>followers</b> who are very good team players and are negatively correlated to <b>followers</b> who possess high ethics and morals. Demanding Narcissists prefer <b>followers</b> who don't need much supervision. Machiavellians who only think of their personal gain do not prefer <b>followers</b> who are independent and require little supervision. Machiavellian leaders whose dominating sub characteristic is to attain power are positively correlated to hard working and ambitious <b>followers.</b> Machiavellian leaders do not prefer <b>followers</b> who like to give their own ideas to the managers. Machiavellian leaders who like to manipulate their employees do not prefer <b>followers</b> who are self-driven and confident. Psychopathic leaders who have dominant selfish characteristics are negatively correlated to majority of the <b>followers</b> with ideal characteristics. Finally, indecisive psychopaths prefer <b>followers</b> who are independent. [...] Leaf ii. The original print copy of this thesis may be available here: [URL]...|$|R

5|$|During the Ottoman period, al-Azhar regained {{its status}} as a favored {{institution}} of learning in Egypt, overtaking the madrasas that had been originally instituted by Saladin and greatly expanded by the Mamluks.

This period also saw the introduction of more secular courses taught at al-Azhar, with science and logic joining philosophy in the curriculum. During this period, al-Azhar saw its first non-Maliki rector; Abdullah al-Shubrawi, a <b>follower</b> of the Shafii madhab, was appointed rector.
