50|$|Most R-22 {{boats are}} now {{equipped}} with Inner Mast Furling (IMF) {{as well as}} roller reefing jibs. The R-22 can be sailed single handed from the large, self-bailing cockpit. The cockpit features a flat floor bottom, comfortable seating, and an optional Boom Room. The boom can be raised or lowered, allowing the boat to be sailed with a Bimini top in place providing shade from the sun. The cabin features a partitioned V-berth, 4' long galley with stove and icebox, {{as well as an}} enclosed head. The cabin ceiling features two standing room hatches and an optional pop top and canvas enclosures. The sailboat also uses the swing keel as a self-centering feature when loading onto the trailer. Unlike most sailboats in its class, this boat features positive foam flotation that render it unsinkable, even if holed. The sturdy mast is supported by 9 stays and 9 chain plates: one forward <b>jib</b> <b>stay,</b> 3 stays on each side, and two back stays. The mast can remain upright with any broken stay, even the single forward <b>jib</b> <b>stay.</b> One R-22 boat was caught in hurricane-force winds in Long Island Sound and knocked down 3 times. The R-22 is unsinkable and self-righting, but hurricane-force winds tested its mettle. It broke one shroud and one stay, but was never de-masted and sailed back to Mamaroneck Harbor when the winds died to about 30 mph.|$|E
60|$|He was not wrong. The {{pleasant}} days of towing ended all too soon, {{though the}} Haliotis trailed behind her a heavily weighted <b>jib</b> <b>stayed</b> {{out into the}} shape of a pocket; and Mr. Wardrop was no longer an artist of imagination, but one of seven-and-twenty prisoners in a prison full of insects. The man-of-war had towed them to the nearest port, not to the headquarters of the colony, and when Mr. Wardrop saw the dismal little harbour, with its ragged line of Chinese junks, its one crazy tug, and the boat-building shed that, under the charge of a philosophical Malay, represented a dockyard, he sighed and shook his head.|$|R
5000|$|Original usage in 18th and 19th century square-rigged ships {{distinguished}} between the fore staysail, {{set on the}} forestay running from the foremast head to the ship's peak, the foremost part of the hull, and the <b>jibs</b> set on <b>stays</b> running to the bowsprit. Jibs, but not staysails, could also be [...] "set flying," [...] i.e. not attached to the standing rigging. Sails set beyond the peak were typically called <b>jibs,</b> set on <b>stays</b> running from the fore topmast to the bowsprit, or the fore topgallant mast to the jibboom or even the fore royal mast to the flying jibboom. A large square-rigged ship typically has four jibs, but could {{have as many as}} six.|$|R
60|$|There {{was a quick}} snap, {{followed}} by a crash. The steel weather-rigging carried away at the lanyards, and mast, <b>jib,</b> mainsail, blocks, <b>stays,</b> sea-anchor, French Pete--everything--went over the side. Almost by a miracle, the captain clutched at the bobstay and managed to get one hand {{up and over the}} bowsprit. The boys ran forward to drag him into safety, and Red Nelson, observing the disaster, put up his helm and ran down to the rescue.|$|R
