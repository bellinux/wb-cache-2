Of Dumas' contribution to macroeconomic theory, Kenneth Boulding wrote in the preface to Dumas' book, The Overburdened Economy, [...] "This is a very important book[...] [...] [...] Lloyd Dumas has challenged one of the implicit assumptions of the Keynesian Revolution ... the assumption that all activity which is paid for must be productive. His questioning of this assumption may well set off a reorganization of the <b>economic</b> <b>information</b> <b>system</b> ... Dumas's work is a very valuable contribution to the coming transformation of economic thought" [...] (pg. xi). In praise of the same book (see blurbs or dust jacket), Galbraith wrote [...] "This is a book of real substance by a scholar of high competence. ...

40|$|IT IS ONLY in {{the last}} eight or ten years that the {{numerical}} aspects of bibliography have attracted attention, although some of the numerical regularities that occur in bibliography have been known for thirty or forty years. Results are, therefore, still meager and applications are still few. Moreover, most of the work so far reported has been limited to numerical analysis of the literature of the natural sciences. This is in part because the secondary sources in the natural sciences are the best organized and so provide the most accessible data; in part because the literature of the natural sciences are the least restricted by linguistic barriers; and in part because the proposed world-wide systems, such as those advocated in the UNISIST report, offer an immediate field of application in the design of economic and efficient systems {{based on the results of}} numerical bibliographic analysis. However, the field of possible application is gradually widening: serious efforts are now being made to organize the more diffused literatures of the social sciences, for example. The main practical purposes that numerical analysis can serve are based on the belief that quantification is a necessary component of the design of <b>economic</b> <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> and that measurement of the key processes of an <b>information</b> <b>system</b> is a necessary component of management control.

40|$|Abstract. Adjustment {{models are}} used {{increasingly}} to analyze population and employment changes in regional economies. However, questions remain {{about the most}} appropriate geographic scales and time lags for these models. In this paper we estimate a well-known adjustment model for a recent 25 -year period in the USA. Regional population and employment changes (levels and densities) are examined at three scales (states, Bureau of Economic Analysis regions, counties) using various time lags (one to ten years). Two-stage least squares regression estimates, based on Regional <b>Economic</b> <b>Information</b> <b>System</b> data running between 1969 and 1994, are generated and discussed. Analysis is restricted to the core relationships between population and employment; the roles of other exogenous variables, normally included in adjustment models, are not considered. Instead, concern is focused {{on issues such as}} stability and directional causality of the interacting population-employment systems. Some brief suggestions regarding future research conclude the paper. ...|$|E
