5|$|Young Calhoun showed {{scholastic}} talent, {{and although}} schools were scarce on the Carolina frontier, he was enrolled briefly in an academy in Appling, Georgia, which soon closed. He continued his studies privately. When his father died, his brothers were away starting business careers {{and so the}} 14-year old Calhoun took over management of the family farm and five other farms. For four years he simultaneously kept up his reading and his hunting and <b>fishing.</b> <b>The</b> family decided he should continue his education, and so he resumed studies at the Academy after it reopened.|$|E

25|$|Nearest {{neighbour}} distance – The nearest neighbour distance (NND) {{describes the}} distance between the centroid of one <b>fish</b> (<b>the</b> focal <b>fish)</b> and <b>the</b> centroid of <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> nearest to <b>the</b> focal <b>fish.</b> This parameter can be found for each fish in an aggregation and then averaged. Care must be taken to account for <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> located at <b>the</b> edge of a fish aggregation, since these fish have no neighbour in one direction. The NND is also related to the packing density. For schooling <b>fish</b> <b>the</b> NND is usually between one-half and one body length.|$|R
50|$|Here {{the spear}} gun is {{connected}} to a buoy via a float rope. After spearing a <b>fish,</b> <b>the</b> spearfisher detaches the float rope and uses a speed stick (a metal spike) attached to the float rope to thread <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> onto <b>the</b> float rope through its gills. <b>The</b> <b>fish</b> will then gradually slide up the float rope as the diver swims until it rests underneath the buoy. When shooting larger <b>fish,</b> <b>the</b> diver can {{let go of his}} gun and play <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> from <b>the</b> float line, giving <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> more room to tire and preventing it from tearing off the spear or dragging the spearfisher under the water.|$|R
5|$|Banished {{revolves}} around the player guiding citizens of a remote community of outcasts to grow and maintain a settlement through a command economy. The game focuses on the player's town as a whole, with {{the citizens of the}} town acting as a resource to be managed. The player must assign citizens to various jobs such as building or <b>fishing.</b> <b>The</b> citizens then perform the job without specific direction from the player. Citizens have needs that must be met in order to keep them happy and healthy, such as ensuring enough food is available or that they have a home. Additional citizens come from two sources, the birth of children and the arrival of nomads, wandering groups that wish to join the player's town. The player's citizens will age and eventually die.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 20th century, formal {{schooling}} had again become {{a feature of}} the islands, and in 1906 the church was extended to make a schoolhouse. The children all now learned English and their native Gaelic. Improved midwifery skills, denied to the island by John Mackay, reduced the problems of childhood tetanus. From the 1880s, trawlers <b>fishing</b> <b>the</b> north Atlantic made regular visits, bringing additional trade. Talk of an evacuation occurred in 1875 during MacKay's time as minister, but despite occasional food shortages and a flu epidemic in 1913, the population was stable at between 75 and 80, and no obvious sign existed that within a few years the millennia-old occupation of the island was to end.|$|E
5|$|In the {{beginning}} of the 18th century, there was a decline in the Ribeira shipyard activities, due to the aggradation of the Portuguese coast and the Povoan shipyard started to work in the construction of fishing vessels. There was a significant increase of the fisher community {{in the middle of the}} century, becoming the main activity, and during the reign of Joseph I with the country in the middle of an economic crisis, Póvoa started a rapid development. The Royal Academy of Sciences of Lisbon noticed their overwhelming notoriety in the Minho coast and considered Povoans to be the most expert fishermen from Cape St. Vincent to Caminha, with a sizable number of fishermen, ships and high sea <b>fishing.</b> <b>The</b> result was a very considerable quantity of caught fish.|$|E
50|$|With <b>the</b> <b>Fish</b> Symbol feature disabled, an angler {{can learn}} to {{distinguish}} between fish, vegetation, schools of baitfish or forage fish, debris, etc. Fish will usually appear on the screen as an arch. This is because the distance between <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> and <b>the</b> transducer changes as the boat passes over <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> (or <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> swims under <b>the</b> boat). When <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> enters <b>the</b> {{leading edge of the}} sonar beam, a display pixel is turned on. As <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> swims toward <b>the</b> centre of the beam, the distance to <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> decreases, turning on pixels at shallower depths. When <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> swims directly under the transducer, it is closer to the boat so the stronger signal shows a thicker line. As <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> swims away from the transducer, the distance increases, which shows as progressively deeper pixels.|$|R

5|$|Lake Phelps and the Scuppernong River {{are both}} open for <b>fishing.</b> <b>The</b> North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission (NCWRC) has {{established}} fishing regulations, such as catch and length limits, that {{are meant to}} enhance sport fisheries in public waters such as Lake Phelps and the Scuppernong River. The NCWRC has had regulations in place at Pettigrew State Park since 2002. The regulations specify that anglers may keep largemouth bass that are greater than 20inches (50.8cm) or between 14 and 16inches (35.6-40.6cm). This rule {{was put in place}} {{to increase the number of}} tropy fish, fish over 20inches (50.8cm). Additionally the NCWRC stocks Lake Phelps with bluegill and they have begun a program to reintroduce alewife and blueback herring via fish ladder on Bee Tree Canal from the Scuppernong River.|$|E
5|$|Scotland {{is roughly}} {{half the size of}} England and Wales and has {{approximately}} the same amount of coastline, but only between a fifth and a sixth of the amount of the arable or good pastoral land, under 60 metres above sea level, and most of this is located in the south and east. This made marginal pastoral farming and <b>fishing</b> <b>the</b> key factors in the pre-modern economy. Its north Atlantic position means that it has very heavy rainfall, which encouraged the spread of blanket peat bog, the acidity of which, combined with high level of wind and salt spray, made most of the western islands treeless. The existence of hills, mountains, quicksands and marshes made internal communication and conquest extremely difficult.|$|E
5|$|So, after Thor secures his goats at Egil's home, Thor and Týr go to Hymir's hall {{in search}} of a {{cauldron}} large enough to brew ale for them all. They arrive, and Týr sees his nine-hundred-headed grandmother and his gold-clad mother, the latter of which welcomes them with a horn. After Hymir—who is not happy to see Thor—comes in from the cold outdoors, Týr's mother helps them find a properly strong cauldron. Thor eats a big meal of two oxen (all the rest eat but one), and then goes to sleep. In the morning, he awakes and informs Hymir that he wants to go <b>fishing</b> <b>the</b> following evening, and that he will catch plenty of food, but that he needs bait. Hymir tells him to go get some bait from his pasture, which he expects should not be a problem for Thor. Thor goes out, finds Hymir's best ox, and rips its head off.|$|E
50|$|Most {{freshwater}} mussels reproduce by releasing their larvae, called glochidia, into the water, {{where they are}} then taken in by <b>fish.</b> <b>The</b> glochidia lodge in the gills or fins of <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> and develop into juvenile mussels encysted in <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> tissue. They then drop off <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> into <b>the</b> substrate. Little is known about how this species transfers its glochidia to fish hosts, but it may occur when the adult female is eaten by <b>the</b> <b>fish.</b> <b>The</b> <b>fish</b> host for this mussel species is the freshwater drum (Aplodinotus grunniens).|$|R

5|$|The Izak {{catshark}} is harmless and of no commercial value. It {{is regularly}} caught incidentally (and discarded) by a bottom trawl fishery targeting hake south of Cape Town. In contrast to most cartilaginous fishes, its {{numbers have been}} increasing {{in the presence of}} commercial <b>fishing.</b> <b>The</b> reasons for this may include its high reproductive rate, its breeding in less-fished shallower waters, its hardiness allowing for high post-capture survival, and its opportunistic diet. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has consequently listed the Izak catshark under Least Concern, while still noting that it merits continued population monitoring because of its highly restricted range.|$|E
5|$|The {{album is}} the band's first after joining the main Victor Entertainment roster, after {{releasing}} two albums with Victor sub-label BabeStar. After {{the release of}} Night <b>Fishing,</b> <b>the</b> band began {{looking for a new}} management company to sign a contract with. Originally, the members did not want to leave Sapporo, especially guitarist Motoharu Iwadera and bassist Ami Kusakari. Of the five management companies they were choosing between, none of them needed the band to relocate, except for Hipland Management. Vocalist Ichiro Yamaguchi realized that staying in Sapporo was against the band's goal of making music for a much wider group of listeners, and was surprised when all of the members agreed with him. In Spring 2008, the band moved to Tokyo from Hokkaido.|$|E
5|$|The blacktip shark {{is popular}} with {{recreational}} anglers in Florida, the Caribbean, and South Africa. It {{is listed as}} a game fish by the International Game Fish Association. Once hooked, this species is a strong, steady fighter that sometimes {{jumps out of the}} water. Since 1995, the number of blacktip sharks taken by recreational anglers in the United States has approached or surpassed the number taken by commercial <b>fishing.</b> <b>The</b> International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed the blacktip shark as Near Threatened, as its low reproductive rate renders it vulnerable to overfishing. The United States and Australia are the only two countries that manage fisheries catching blacktip sharks. In both cases, regulation occurs under umbrella management schemes for multiple shark species, such as that for the large coastal sharks category of the US National Marine Fisheries Service Atlantic shark Fisheries Management Plan. No conservation plans specifically for this species have been implemented.|$|E

5|$|The {{passing of}} the Antarctic Conservation Act (1978) in the U.S. brought several {{restrictions}} to U.S. activity on Antarctica. The introduction of alien plants or animals can bring a criminal penalty, as can the extraction of any indigenous species. The overfishing of krill, which plays {{a large role in}} the Antarctic ecosystem, led officials to enact regulations on <b>fishing.</b> <b>The</b> Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), a treaty that came into force in 1980, requires that regulations managing all Southern Ocean fisheries consider potential effects on the entire Antarctic ecosystem. Despite these new acts, unregulated and illegal fishing, particularly of Patagonian toothfish (marketed as Chilean Sea Bass in the U.S.), remains a serious problem. The illegal fishing of toothfish has been increasing, with estimates of 32,000tonnes (35,300short tons) in 2000.|$|E
5|$|The {{west coast}} of Canada by 7,000–5000BCE (9,000–7,000years ago) saw various {{cultures}} who organized themselves around salmon <b>fishing.</b> <b>The</b> Nuu-chah-nulth of Vancouver Island began whaling with advanced long spears at about this time. The Maritime Archaic is one group of North America's Archaic culture of sea-mammal hunters in the subarctic. They prospered from approximately 7,000BCE–1,500BCE (9,000–3,500 years ago) along the Atlantic Coast of North America. Their settlements included longhouses and boat-topped temporary or seasonal houses. They engaged in long-distance trade, using as currency white chert, a rock quarried from northern Labrador to Maine. The Pre-Columbian culture, whose members were called Red Paint People, is indigenous to the New England and Atlantic Canada regions of North America. The culture flourished between 3,000BCE–1,000BCE (5,000–3,000years ago) and was named after their burial ceremonies, which used large quantities of red ochre to cover bodies and grave goods.|$|E
