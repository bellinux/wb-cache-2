40|$|The article {{describes}} the regulation of execution proceedings in administration of the selected European socialist States. The analysis {{is limited to the}} legislations of those States, where the execution proceedings has been more completely regulated. It is the case of Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Yougoslavia, Poland and Hungary. In the remaining States the execution proceedings occupies a secondary position and is fragmentarily regulated in various legislations of detailed problems of state's administration. Various normative models adopted in the socialist States can be specified on the grounds of varying modes of regulating the procedure. The author focused on the problem of safeguarding legally protected interests of citizens in the execution proceedings in the compared legislations. The very fact of legislating the proceedings by means of parliamentary acts has the essential effect upon the protection of citizen's interest. Out of detailed questions the following were analysed: mode of regulating some execution means (substituted execution, immediate <b>enforcement),</b> <b>principles</b> of execution proceedings and the system of appeals. The author concludes that the priority is attributed to the protection of State's interest in the specific collission of State's and citizen's interest which is observed in legislations of execution proceedings in the socialist States. Polish legislation however, can effectively protect the interest of citizens in the execution proceedings. The author indicates at the necessity of further actions aiming at more effective citizen's interest protection by means of submitting decisions given in the execution proceedings under judicial control of administrative decisions.

40|$|In general, {{the formal}} {{definition}} {{of the principle of}} equality is basically the same in the countries compared in this contibution. On the other hand, the fact that courts apply this principle according to their national point of view may account for some differences. Consequently, the same factual situations that arise in each of the compared countries may be treated in different ways. In {{the first part of this}} contribution, the <b>enforcement</b> of the <b>principle</b> of equality with respect to taxation in the Netherlands was analysed. The Dutch Supreme Court leaves the legislature a wide margin of appreciation in answering the question of whether cases must be considered as alike and, if so, whether an objective and reasonable justification exists to nevertheless regulate those cases differently. The observation by the Court that a legal provision is discriminatory does not always mean that the taxpayer is successful. Immediate justice is not always done to the taxpayer: in some cases, the Court does not remove the discrimination and, in other cases, it leaves the case undecided. In these cases, the Court does not want to usurp the function of the legislature. Especially politically sensitive issues, for which more than one solution is available, are left to the legislature. In our opinion, the Court should be more activist in less politically sensitive issues in case of arbitrary decisions of the legislature. When more than one solution is available, the Court may leave the removal of the discrimination to the legislature, but should set a deadline for the legislature. In exceptional cases, the Court can even better not apply provisions which are the result of deliberately discriminatory naked preferences or deliberately maintained discriminations. In the second part, we offered a legal comparison which concentrated on the different sources of the principle of equality in tax law, the <b>enforcement</b> of this <b>principle,</b> and some aspects of constitutional (or judicial) review in tax law. Judicial review is instrumental to the <b>enforcement</b> of the <b>principle</b> of equality. However, there are relevant factors other than those related to judicial review. Even when judicial review of statute law is excluded, as is the case in the Netherlands, the courts may find a way to protect the principle of equality, although in a reserved way. Thus, the <b>enforcement</b> of the <b>principle</b> of equality may differ according to whether the source of the principle is a domestic constitutional provision or (solely) Article 14 of the Convention. Often, however, the judiciary leaves the legislature a wide margin of appreciation in tax matters. Furthermore, we have seen that different constitutional and ordinary courts operate in different societies and legal and political cultures, which accounts for the different results of the application of the principle of equality. The practice of constitutional review of tax laws in Germany and its absence in the United Kingdom might both be considere...|$|R
40|$|In this report, the {{phenomenon}} of vowel lengthening in Standard Italian and two Northern Italian dialects, Friulian and Milanese, is discussed. For each language, the facts of vowel lengthening are presented and analyzed {{in the framework of}} several theories previously proposed to account for the data. These include primarily derivational theory, moraic theory, and optimality theory. Vowel lengthening is analyzed predominantly from a synchronic perspective for Standard Italian, but for Friulian and Milanese, both diachronic and synchronic accounts are presented. Vowel length in Italian and Milanese is seen to result from bimoraic <b>enforcement,</b> a <b>principle</b> requiring that all stressed syllables be bimoraic. A constraint prohibiting long vowels in word-final position interacts with the <b>principle</b> of bimoraic <b>enforcement</b> in Italian. In Milanese, bimoraic enforcement responds to a lexical contrast in moraic and non-moraic codas. Vowels before non-moraic codas lengthen to create a bimoraic syllable, while those before moraic codas do not since those syllables are already bimoraic. In Friulian, on the other hand, historical vowel lengthening which resulted from compensatory lengthening following the apocope of final vowels has been reanalyzed a...|$|R
