25|$|If {{substrate}} molecules {{are moving}} from areas of lower concentration to areas of higher concentration (i.e., {{in the opposite}} direction as, or against the concentration gradient), specific transmembrane carrier proteins are required. These proteins have receptors that bind to specific molecules (e.g., glucose) and transport them across the cell membrane. Because energy is required in this process, it is known as 'active' transport. Examples of active transport include the transportation of sodium out of the cell and potassium into the cell by the sodium-potassium pump. Active transport often takes place in the <b>internal</b> <b>lining</b> of the small intestine.|$|E

Mondino goes on to describe the organs in the order in which they present themselves during the dissection process. Dissection began {{with the opening of the}} abdominal cavity via vertical incision running from the stomach to the pectoral muscles and a horizontal cut above the navel. First, the musculature of the intestinal tract is described in detail, followed by an extensive discussion of the form, function, and position of the stomach. According to the text, the stomach is spherical; the stomach wall has an <b>internal</b> <b>lining,</b> which is [...] "the seat of sensation", and an external fleshy coat that is involved in digestion. In order to access the spleen, which was thought to secrete black bile into the stomach through imaginary canals, the dissector was required to remove the [...] "false ribs". The liver is said to have five lobes, the gallbladder is described as the seat of yellow bile, and the cecum is described with no mention of the vermiform appendix. Though Anathomia only vaguely describes the pancreas, the pancreatic duct is discussed in greater detail. He also makes new observations regarding the anatomy of the bladder and the enlargement of the uterus during both menstruation and pregnancy.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} work {{deals with the}} application of dual series equations {{to the problems of}} simply supported rectangular plate with an <b>internal</b> <b>line</b> support under uniformly distributed load. Two different types of problem are considered depending on the nature of singularities that allowed in the fields, The first is the plate having an <b>internal</b> <b>line</b> unsagged support that the moment singularity is assumed at the tip of <b>internal</b> <b>line</b> support. The second involves the advancing contact problem between the plate and the <b>internal</b> <b>line</b> sagged support in which the shear singularity exhibits at the tip of contact. However, both types of singularity are in the order of an inverse square root. By choosing the proper finite Hankel transform, the dual series can be converted to the inhomogeneous Fredholm integral equation. This equation, with a numerical technique, is then reduced to a set of simultaneous equations suitable for numerical solution. The physical quan-tities of the plates and the extent of contact related to the level of loading in the case of free contact are provided in the present work...|$|R

40|$|A free {{vibration}} analysis of moderately thick skew plates with oblique <b>internal</b> <b>line</b> supports is presented. Mindlin 2 ̆ 7 s plate theory is employed and the pb- 2 Rayleigh-Ritz method {{is applied to}} obtain the governing eigenvalue equation for internally supported skew plates. A set of natural frequencies for skew Mindlin plates with oblique <b>internal</b> <b>line</b> supports having different combinations of boundary conditions has been determined for various aspect ratios a/b, relative thickness ratios t/b and skew angles α. The validity of the approach is illustrated {{by comparing the results}} with other established values. From literature searches, it appears that no work has previously been done on the {{free vibration}} of moderately thick skew plates with oblique <b>internal</b> <b>line</b> supports. Thus this paper may provide some important information to designers and engineers for use in practical applications...|$|R
