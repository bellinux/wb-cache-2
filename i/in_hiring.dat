30|$|Given the {{inability}} to explain the decline by shifts {{in the composition of}} individual and business characteristics, we explored a few additional methods of explaining the decline. The distribution of establishment-level employment change has been narrowing during the last 10 to 15 years, fully accounting for the decline in job creation and job destruction, yet this narrowing only explains {{about a third of the}} decline <b>in</b> <b>hires</b> and separations. This tells us that the explanation for the decline <b>in</b> <b>hires</b> and separations will be different than the explanation for the decline in job creation and job destruction. We also find that the decline <b>in</b> <b>hires</b> and separations is being driven by the decline in job-to-job flows and the disappearance of short-duration jobs in the U.S. economy.|$|R

As McGraw {{did not want}} to block Bresnahan from the opportunity, the Giants traded Bresnahan to the Cardinals for Red Murray, Bugs Raymond and Admiral Schlei after the 1908 season. Bresnahan led the Cardinals, who won only 49 games in 1908, to 54 wins in 1909 and 63 wins in 1910. Attendance increased from 205,000 fans in 1908 to 299,000fans in 1909, and 355,000 fans in 1910.|$|E

5|$|Although {{there are}} minor traces of Punic-Phoenician and Romano-Italian influence, the Delian mosaics {{generally}} {{conform to the}} major trends found in Hellenistic art. The same wealthy patrons who commissioned paintings and sculptures at Delos may have also been involved <b>in</b> <b>hiring</b> mosaic artists from abroad. Delian mosaics share certain characteristics with mosaics {{in other parts of}} the Greek world, such as Macedonian mosaics in Pella. They also share some attributes with Greek painting traditions and often employ a similar black-background technique found in red-figure pottery of the Classical period. Some of the styles and techniques used at Delos were later found in Roman art and mosaics, although contemporary Roman examples from Pompeii, for instance, reveal significant differences in the production and design of mosaics in the western versus eastern Mediterranean.|$|E

30|$|We {{document}} {{and attempt to}} explain the recent decline in employment dynamics in the U.S. We have four major empirical findings. First, each measure exhibits a “stair step” pattern, with the declines concentrated in recessions and little increase during subsequent expansions. Second, changes {{in the composition of}} workers and businesses can explain only a small amount of the decline. Third, any explanation for the decline in job creation and job destruction will account for no {{more than one-third of the}} decline <b>in</b> <b>hires</b> and separations. Fourth, the decline <b>in</b> <b>hires</b> and separations is driven by the disappearance of short-duration jobs.|$|R
5|$|In July 2011, {{following}} {{the revelation that}} the News of the World had paid private investigators to hack into the phones of Milly Dowler, {{as well as the}} families of murder victims and deceased servicemen, Miliband called for News International chief executive Rebekah Brooks to resign, urged David Cameron to establish a public, judge-led inquiry into the scandal, and announced that he would force a Commons vote on whether to block the News International bid for a controlling stake in BSkyB. He also called for the Press Complaints Commission to be abolished – a call later echoed by Cameron and Nick Clegg – and called into question Cameron's judgement <b>in</b> <b>hiring</b> former News of the World editor Andy Coulson to be his director of communications. Cameron later took the unusual step of saying that the government would back Miliband's motion that the BSkyB bid be dropped, and an hour before Miliband's motion was due to be debated, News International announced that it would withdraw the bid.|$|E
5|$|In 2012 Belahcen Fitzgerald found a {{property}} to rent and registered Amal Women's Training Center and Moroccan Restaurant as a non-profit organization. In early 2013 the center {{raised more than}} $7300 through crowdfunding on RocketHub, exceeding its $5000 goal. The money was used to purchase kitchen equipment and to ensure the kitchen was up to code. The restaurant opened in April 2013, and in July 2013, the center was awarded a three-year grant by the Drosos Foundation {{with the goal of}} making the program self-sustaining by 2016. The first group of trainees began training in February 2014. Within the first month of operation, several of the restaurant's customers had expressed interest <b>in</b> <b>hiring</b> future Amal graduates to work at local hotels and restaurants. The center completed a second round of crowdfunding on RocketHub in 2014, raising more than $9600. In October 2015 the center was awarded €25,000 by the Orange Foundation. Belahcen Fitzgerald stated that the prize money would be used to help women start their own catering micro businesses.|$|E

30|$|The {{empirical}} quantification of {{this equation}} using the LEHD data {{is also in}} Table  7. The hires and separations measures, {{as well as the}} job-to-job flows across dominant jobs, are from the data in Figures  1 and 3; the estimates of employment inflows and outflows are from tabulations of the confidential LEHD microdata. We find that 12 percent of the decline <b>in</b> <b>hires</b> and separations is associated with a decline in employment inflows and outflows, 43.4 percent is associated with job-to-job flows across dominant jobs, and the rest (44.6 percent) is associated with declines in secondary or short-duration job activity. While different from the point estimate using the CPS data (− 65 percent compared to 12 percent), the two datasets are telling the same story that flows into and out of employment are not the dominant explanation for the trend decline <b>in</b> <b>hires</b> and separations. Rather, the decline <b>in</b> <b>hires</b> and separations is driven by a decline in the job-to-job flow rates as well as by declines in worker flows associated with secondary and short-duration jobs.|$|R
30|$|The decline <b>in</b> <b>hires</b> and separations {{from all}} three data sources shows a “stair-step” pattern, with declines {{concentrated}} in or around recessions, from which the measures never fully recover during expansions. Using NBER recession dates, all of the 8.9 percentage point decline <b>in</b> LEHD <b>hires</b> (from 2001 :Q 1 – 2010 :Q 4) occurs during the 2001 and the 2007 – 2009 recessions, and 6.3 percentage points of the 8.1 percentage point decline in LEHD separations occurs during the recessionary quarters. Similarly, more {{than all of the}} decline <b>in</b> JOLTS <b>hires</b> occurs during recessions, and half of the decline in JOLTS separations occurs during recessions. The CPS series is somewhat different: as seen in Figure  1, much of the decline <b>in</b> CPS <b>hires</b> and separations occurs in 2002, immediately following the 2001 recession, and in 2007, immediately preceding the 2007 – 2009 recession.|$|R

These correspondence tests showed that equivalent minority candidates need to send around 50% more applications to be invited for an interview than majority candidates.
