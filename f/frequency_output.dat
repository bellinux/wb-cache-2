25|$|The key to {{the ability}} of a {{frequency}} synthesizer to generate multiple frequencies is the divider placed between the output and the feedback input. This is usually {{in the form of a}} digital counter, with the output signal acting as a clock signal. The counter is preset to some initial count value, and counts down at each cycle of the clock signal. When it reaches zero, the counter output changes state and the count value is reloaded. This circuit is straightforward to implement using flip-flops, and because it is digital in nature, is very easy to interface to other digital components or a microprocessor. This allows the <b>frequency</b> <b>output</b> by the synthesizer to be easily controlled by a digital system.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>output</b> <b>frequency</b> of the {{transmitter}} {{is proportional to}} the speed of the rotor. To keep the frequency constant, the speed of the electric motor turning it was controlled with a feedback loop.
