25|$|The American Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and Dietitians of Canada {{state that}} {{properly}} planned vegan diets {{are appropriate for}} all life stages, including pregnancy and lactation. They indicate that vegetarian diets may be more common among adolescents with eating disorders, but that its adoption may serve to camouflage a disorder rather than cause one. The Australian National Health and Medical Research Council similarly recognizes a well-planned vegan diet as viable for any age. The British National Health Service's Eatwell Plate allows for an entirely plant-based diet, as <b>does</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> Department of Agriculture's (USDA) MyPlate. The USDA allows tofu to replace meat in the National School Lunch Program. The German Society for Nutrition does not recommend a vegan diet for babies, children and adolescents, and for those pregnant or breastfeeding.|$|E

2500|$|The Bronx is {{referred}} to with the definite article as [...] "The Bronx", both legally and colloquially. The County of Bronx does not place [...] "The" [...] immediately before [...] "Bronx" [...] in formal references, unlike the coextensive Borough of the Bronx, nor <b>does</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> Postal Service in its database of Bronx addresses (the city and state mailing-address format is simply [...] "Bronx, NY").

It was continued in the [...] "Borough of The Bronx", which included a larger annexation from Westchester County in 1898. The use of the definite article is attributed to the style of referring to rivers. Another explanation {{for the use of the}} definite article in the borough's name is that the original form of the name was a possessive or collective one referring to the family, as in visiting [...] "the Broncks", [...] "the Bronck's", or [...] "the Broncks".|$|E
