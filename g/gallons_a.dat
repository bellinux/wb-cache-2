5|$|A microbrewery, or craft brewery, {{produces}} {{a limited amount}} of beer. The maximum amount of beer a brewery can produce and still be classed as a microbrewery varies by region and by authority, though is usually around 15,000 barrels (1.8 megalitres, 396 thousand imperial gallons or 475 thousand US <b>gallons)</b> <b>a</b> year. A brewpub is a type of microbrewery that incorporates a pub or other eating establishment. The highest density of breweries in the world, most of them microbreweries, exists in the German Region of Franconia, especially in the district of Upper Franconia, which has about 200 breweries. The Benedictine Weihenstephan Brewery in Bavaria, Germany, can trace its roots to the year 768, as a document from that year refers to a hop garden in the area paying a tithe to the monastery. The brewery was licensed by the City of Freising in 1040, and therefore is the oldest working brewery in the world.|$|E

50|$|Many {{measures}} of capacity were understood as fractions or multiples of <b>a</b> <b>gallon.</b> For example, <b>a</b> quart is {{a quarter of}} <b>a</b> <b>gallon,</b> and <b>a</b> pint is half of a quart, or an eighth of <b>a</b> <b>gallon.</b> These ratios applied regardless of the specific size of the gallon. Not only did {{the definition of the}} gallon change over time, but there were several different kinds of gallon, which existed at the same time. For example, <b>a</b> wine <b>gallon</b> with <b>a</b> volume of 231 cubic inches (the basis of the U.S. <b>gallon),</b> and <b>an</b> ale <b>gallon</b> of 282 cubic inches, were commonly used for many decades prior to the establishment of the imperial gallon. In other words, a pint of ale and a pint of wine were not the same size.

25|$|In the 19th century, the dam {{was built}} to ensure the water supply for Verviers, {{the center of the}} wool {{industry}} in Belgium. Wool was imported through Antwerp and washed at Verviers, situated between the Ardennes and Belgium's Carboniferous region, before it was shipped for manufacture in Germany and Austria. Wool washing was facilitated by the high acidity of the water. Originally, the industry's water source was the Vesdre river, which proved to be insufficient; moreover, water was returned to the river so polluted that it destroyed the fish population and was blamed for the spread of malaria downstream. In the summer, when water levels were at their lowest, the industry faced shortages, and the local population relied on a limited supply of drinking water from springs. A dam was proposed, with studies to be undertaken by the engineer Bidaut. The goal was to provide the river Vesdre with about 3,000,000 cubic metres of water for the year, and 14,600,704 cubic metres to industry (8,808,000 <b>gallons</b> <b>a</b> day). After delays, a design was submitted in 1868 to the Minister of Public Works.|$|E
25|$|In 1386, the Portuguese and English {{signed the}} Treaty of Windsor. The pact of mutual support fostered a strong {{diplomatic}} {{alliance between the}} two countries (and was still valid and applicable as of 2009). Over the ensuing centuries, whenever England was in conflict with other European powers (most notably France), Portugal and its many vineyards were there to fill in the gap caused by the disruption of trade. Portuguese wine also served as a bargaining chip in English politics. In 1679, the English Parliament banned all imports of French wine as a means of limiting the tariff income of Charles II and forcing him to come to Parliament and ask them directly for funds. Charles and the English wine merchants turned again to Portugal, dramatically increasing imports of Portuguese wines from 427 tuns in 1678 to averaging over 14,000 tuns (roughly equivalent to 16 million liters or over 4million US <b>gallons)</b> <b>a</b> year by 1685. However, it is very likely that not all these imported tuns were truly Portuguese wines, as some wine merchants found their way around the French wine embargo by shipping their wares in Portuguese wine barrels with forged documentation.|$|E

500|$|In {{the later}} 1950s an issue arose which {{tarnished}} the reputations of both Braddocks {{in the eyes}} of much of Liverpool's Welsh community and the people of Wales. In 1955 Liverpool council applied for the compulsory purchase of land in the Tryweryn Valley, Merionethshire, North Wales, {{for the construction of a}} reservoir to serve Liverpool's increasing needs for water—some 65 million <b>gallons</b> <b>a</b> day. The proposal would mean the flooding of the small village of Capel Celyn, and several farms. On 7November a deputation led by the Plaid Cymru president Gwynfor Evans sought to address the council in a plea for a change in policy. According to Bessie's biographer Ben Rees, while Evans was speaking, Bessie banged on the table and joined other councillors in insulting Evans and demanding that he [...] "go back to Wales". In July 1957, when the enabling legislation reached its second House of Commons reading, Bessie described the scheme as regional rather than local, and claimed that some parts of Wales would benefit from it. The land to be flooded in the Tryweryn Valley was not, she said, of high agricultural value, and [...] "nothing was done that was not agreed to by the tenants in the area". The bill became law, and construction began in 1959, but protests and demonstrations continued until the reservoir's opening in 1965. The slogan Cofio Treweryn ("I Remember [...] Tryweryn") was coined by nationalists, says Rees, as [...] "a reminder of Liverpool's greed and lack of sensitivity". In October 2015, on the 50th anniversary of the reservoir's completion, protestors demonstrated around the statue of Bessie at Liverpool's Lime Street Station.|$|E
