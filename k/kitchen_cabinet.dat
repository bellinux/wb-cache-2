25|$|In {{an effort}} to purge the {{government}} of corruption, Jackson launched presidential investigations into all executive Cabinet offices and departments. He believed appointees should be hired on merit and withdrew many candidates he believed were lax in their handling of monies. He asked Congress to reform embezzlement laws, reduce fraudulent applications for federal pensions, revenue laws to prevent evasion of custom duties, and laws to improve government accounting. Jackson's Postmaster Barry resigned after a Congressional investigation into the postal service revealed mismanagement of mail services, collusion and favoritism in awarding lucrative contracts, failure to audit accounts and supervise contract performances. Jackson replaced Barry with Treasury Auditor and prominent <b>Kitchen</b> <b>Cabinet</b> member Amos Kendall, {{who went on to}} implement much needed reforms in the Postal Service.|$|E

500|$|In 1832, Jackson {{nominated}} Van Buren to be Minister to England. Calhoun {{killed the}} nomination with a tie-breaking vote against it, claiming his act would [...] "...kill him, sir, kill dead. He will never kick, sir, never kick." [...] However, Calhoun only made Van Buren seem {{the victim of}} petty politics, which were rooted largely in the Eaton controversy. Van Buren was nominated for vice president, and was elected as Jackson's running mate when Jackson won a second term in 1832. The affair also {{had a hand in}} the replacement of the Telegraph as the main propaganda instrument for the administration. Jackson enlisted the help of longtime supporter Francis Preston Blair, who in November 1830 established a newspaper known as The Washington Globe, which from then on served as the mouthpiece of the Democratic Party. It also contributed {{to the creation of the}} <b>Kitchen</b> <b>Cabinet.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1831, Jackson, at Van Buren's suggestion, demanded the resignations of all the cabinet member except Barry. Van Buren himself {{resigned}} to avoid the appearance of bias. In 1832, Jackson nominated Van Buren to be Minister to England. Calhoun blocked the nomination with a tie-breaking vote against it, claiming the defeated nomination would [...] "...kill him, sir, kill dead. He will never kick, sir, never kick." [...] Van Buren, however, fully recovered and {{played a leading role}} in the Jackson's unofficial <b>Kitchen</b> <b>Cabinet.</b> The <b>Kitchen</b> <b>Cabinet</b> emerged as an unofficial group of advisors to the president. Its existence was partially rooted in Jackson's difficulties with his official cabinet, even after the purging.|$|E

2500|$|Since {{starting}} his course at Hornsey, Goddard had married fellow student Carol Mills, {{with whom he}} lived at her parents' residence in Muswell Hill. Shortly after, he developed anorexia. [...] "I just didn't eat," [...] he has said of this period, [...] "I wasn't attempting to slim, I was attempting to kill myself." [...] Eventually, Goddard took an overdose of all the pills he could find in his mother-in-law's <b>kitchen</b> <b>cabinet.</b> After having his stomach pumped, {{he was sent to}} Colney Hatch mental hospital in North London, eventually being discharged after 3 months on condition of supervision by Mills. [...] "I was totally fucked up in the head. Things went wrong and something snapped. I just became a vegetable for three months. I couldn't talk to people. I was very ill and {{that was part of the}} reason I left college." ...|$|E
2500|$|That night—November 4, 1981—the Minister of Justice, Jean Chrétien, {{met with}} Attorney General of Saskatchewan Roy Romanow and Attorney General of Ontario Roy McMurtry {{in the kitchen}} of Ottawa's Government Conference Centre. The premiers {{discussed}} a scenario in which the provinces would agree to the charter and disallowing opting-out with compensation, while Chrétien agreed to the Vancouver amending formula and reluctantly offered to include the Notwithstanding Clause in the constitution. Chrétien, who had been deeply involved in supporting the [...] "no" [...] side of the Quebec referendum and was abhorred at the possibility of another one, recommended the compromise to Trudeau, but the Prime Minister felt, given the previous chaos, it would still be impossible to obtain the agreement of his provincial counterparts and demurred. Hatfield and Davis, however, agreed in principle to the compromise and told Trudeau that he should do so as well, informing him they would not be on his side if he proceeded unilaterally at that point. Trudeau, who knew that his position in London was growing tenuous, even with the support he had, accepted. Thus, working with the draft proposal created by the Newfoundland delegation, the nine groups worked through the night to prepare the compromise proposal. This period would be called the Kitchen Accord; the men at the table that night became known as the <b>Kitchen</b> <b>Cabinet.</b>|$|E

60|$|There was Mr. Dick Follingsbee, {{with a pair}} of waxed, tow-colored moustaches {{like the}} French emperor's, and ever so much longer. He was a little, thin, light-colored man, with a yellow {{complexion}} and sandy hair; who, with the appendages aforesaid, looked like some kind of large insect, with very long antennae. There was Mrs. Follingsbee,--a tall, handsome, dark-eyed, dark-haired, dashing woman, French dressed from the tip of her lace parasol to the toe of her boot. There was Mademoiselle Thérèse, the French maid, an inexpressibly fine lady; and there was la petite Marie, Mrs. Follingsbee's three-year-old hopeful, a lean, bright-eyed little thing, with a great scarlet bow on her back that made her look like a walking butterfly. On the whole, the tableau of arrival was so impressive, that Bridget and Annie, Rosa and all the <b>kitchen</b> <b>cabinet,</b> were in a breathless state of excitement.|$|E

Finally, {{on the day that}} their furniture began to arrive, and to provide abundant material for gossip and comment to {{the other members of the}} <b>kitchen</b> <b>cabinet,</b> Mary's mind appeared suddenly made up. She came into my mother's room looking as a certain sort of women do when they have made a resolution which they mean to stand by,--very pale, very quiet, and very decided. She asked to see my mother alone, and in that interview she simply expressed gratitude for all her kindness to her, but said that circumstances would oblige her to go to New York.|$|E

6000|$|There is {{one thing}} more which {{goes a long way}} towards the {{continued}} health of these English ladies, and therefore towards their beauty; and that is, the quietude and perpetuity of their domestic institutions. They do not, like us, fade their cheeks lying awake nights ruminating the awful question who shall do the washing next week, or who shall take the chambermaid's place, {{who is going to be}} married, or that of the cook, who has signified her intention of parting with the mistress. Their hospitality is never embarrassed by the consideration that their whole <b>kitchen</b> <b>cabinet</b> may desert at the moment that their guests arrive. They are not obliged to choose between washing their own dishes, or having their cut glass, silver, and china left to the mercy of a foreigner, who has never done any thing but field work. And last, not least, they are not possessed with that ambition to do the impossible in all branches, which, I believe, is the death of a third of the women in America. What is there ever read of in books, or described in foreign travel, as attained by people in possession of every means and appliance, which our women will not undertake, single-handed, in spite of every providential indication to the contrary? Who is not cognizant of dinner parties invited, in which the lady of the house has figured successively as confectioner, cook, dining-room girl, and, lastly, rushed up stairs to bathe her glowing cheeks, smooth her hair, draw on satin dress and kid gloves, and appear in the drawing room as if nothing were the matter? Certainly the undaunted bravery of our American females can never enough be admired. Other women can play gracefully the head of the establishment; but who, like them, could be head, hand, and foot, all at once? ...|$|E
