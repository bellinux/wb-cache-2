25|$|As {{mentioned}} before SSRIs are rather promiscuous {{in that they}} also bind to the homologous NET and DAT, although with much lower affinity than to their principal target SERT. The selectivity of SSRIs for SERT is really interesting where {{only one or two}} different functional group substituents are sufficient to convert an SSRI into a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (NRI) with higher affinity to NE. SSRI antidepressants all have the same mechanism of action and are at least 10-fold more selective for 5-HT re-uptake inhibition than for NE re-uptake inhibition. However, despite the sharing of the same mechanism of action, SSRIs differ in their potency and selectivity in inhibiting 5-HT re-uptake and many of them have important effects on other transporters and receptors. SSRIs are structurally diverse with clear variations in their pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profiles, which leads to <b>differences</b> <b>among</b> <b>them</b> in their half-lifes, clinical activity, adverse effects and drug interactions, which explains the differences in their efficacy and tolerability among patients. However, all SSRIs are clinically equal {{when it comes to their}} efficacy over time.|$|E
500|$|Super Mario Strikers {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics, with reviewers lauding the game's characterisation and visual style, being reminiscent {{to that of}} Kazuto Nakazawa. GameSpot's Brian Ekberg praised the game's accessibility, stating that [...] "Strikers' pick-up-and-play design will have you playing like a cartoon Pele in no time". Similarly, critics welcomed the developers' choice to forgo traditional football rules in the favour of a more arcade-like style of gameplay. Despite this, IGN complained of a [...] "disappointingly slim" [...] variety of modes, {{as well as the}} perceived small roster of characters and inflexibility when choosing teams. On a similar note, Eurogamer criticised the vague presentation of characters attributes, making it difficult to determine what their respective strengths and weaknesses are. Despite enjoying the variety and appearance of Strikers stadia, GameSpot noted only cosmetic <b>differences</b> <b>among</b> <b>them,</b> and criticised a lack of physical features to make them more interesting.|$|E

[...] Despite the considerable <b>differences</b> <b>among</b> <b>them,</b> they shared some basic features: [...] all three were empiricists concerned not with metaphysics but with the foundations of philosophy; they were interested in philosophy itself, not merely its history; they understood philosophy in positive terms, but none of them was a Positivist in the old style.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{dozens of}} species were {{described}} in the late 19th century and early 20th century, many were based on partial skeletons and {{turned out to be}} synonyms. Currently, eleven species are formally recognised, although recent studies using ancient DNA recovered from bones in museum collections suggest that distinct lineages exist within some of these. One factor that has caused much confusion in moa taxonomy is the intraspecific variation of bone sizes, between glacial and inter-glacial periods (see Bergmann’s rule and Allen’s rule) as well as sexual dimorphism being evident in several species. Dinornis seems to have had the most pronounced sexual dimorphism, with females being up to 150% [...] as tall and 280% as heavy as malesso much bigger that they were formerly classified as separate species until 2003. A 2009 study showed that Euryapteryx curtus and Euryapteryx gravis were synonyms. A 2010 study explained size <b>differences</b> <b>among</b> <b>them</b> as sexual dimorphism.

2500|$|Only once {{since then}} has the House of Representatives chosen the President: In 1824, Andrew Jackson {{received}} 99 electoral votes, John Quincy Adams (son of John Adams) 84, William H.

All of the candidates {{were members of the}} Democratic-Republican Party (though there were significant political <b>differences</b> <b>among</b> <b>them),</b> and each had fallen short of the 131 votes necessary to win. Because the House could only consider the top three candidates, Clay could not become President. Crawford's poor health following a stroke made his election by the House unlikely. Andrew Jackson expected the House to vote for him, as he had won a plurality of the popular and electoral votes. Instead, the House elected Adams on the first ballot with thirteen states, followed by Jackson with seven and Crawford with four. Clay had endorsed Adams for the Presidency; the endorsement carried additional weight because Clay was the Speaker of the House. When Adams later appointed Clay his Secretary of State, many—particularly Jackson and his supporters—accused the pair of making a [...] "Corrupt Bargain". In the less contested election for vice president, John C. Calhoun received 182 electoral votes and was elected outright.|$|E
