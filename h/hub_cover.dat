The XFY-1 was like no other propeller driven aircraft before it. No previous aircraft with a similar weight, engine power, or size had ever attempted to take off and land vertically. For the safety of both the craft and its pilot, the propeller <b>hub</b> <b>cover</b> was removed and replaced by safety tether lines for the first flight, in case Coleman would lose control of the craft and {{would need to be}} tethered to prevent the craft falling to the ground. On {{the other end of the}} tether was another engineer, Bob McGreary. If Coleman ever lost control, McGreary controlled the winch which could be turned to raise the tethers to prevent the craft from plummeting to the ground. For further safety precautions, four security cables were fastened to each wing in case control was lost in any axis. The tests were conducted inside of a naval airship hangar at Moffett Field in Mountain View, California.|$|E
40|$|As {{techniques}} for graph query processing mature, {{the need for}} optimization is increasingly becoming an imperative. Indices {{are one of the}} key ingredients toward efficient query processing strategies via cost-based optimization. Due to the apparent absence of a common representation model, it is difficult to make a focused effort toward developing access structures, metrics to evaluate query costs, and choose alternatives. In this context, recent interests in covering-based graph matching appears to be a promising direction of research. In this paper, our goal is to formally introduce a new graph representation model, called Minimum <b>Hub</b> <b>Cover,</b> and demonstrate that this representation offers interesting strategic advantages, facilitates construction of candidate graphs from graph fragments, and helps leverage indices in novel ways for query optimization. However, similar to other covering problems, minimum <b>hub</b> <b>cover</b> is NP-hard, and thus is a natural candidate for optimization. We claim that computing the minimum <b>hub</b> <b>cover</b> leads to substantial cost reduction for graph query processing. We present a computational characterization of minimum <b>hub</b> <b>cover</b> based on integer programming to substantiate our claim and investigate its computational cost on various graph types.

40|$|The minimum <b>hub</b> <b>cover</b> {{is a new}} NP-hard {{optimization}} problem that has been recently introduced to the literature {{in the context of}} graph query processing on graph databases. The problem has been introduced as a new graph representation model to expedite graph queries. With this representation, a graph database can be represented by a small subset of graph vertices. Searching over only that subset of vertices decreases the response time of a query and increases the efficiency of graph query processing. We introduce the problem of finding a subgraph including the minimum number of vertices as an {{optimization problem}} referred to as the minimum <b>hub</b> <b>cover</b> problem. We demonstrate that searching a query over the vertices in minimum <b>hub</b> <b>cover</b> increases the efficiency of query processing and surpasses the existing search methods. We also introduce several mathematical programming models. In particular, we give two binary integer programming formulations as well as a novel quadratic integer programming formulation. We use the linear programming relaxations of the binary integer programming models. Our relaxation for the quadratic integer programming model leads to a semidefinite programming formulation. We also present several rounding heuristics to obtain integral solutions after solving the proposed relaxations.

Our algorithm is based on a well-known graph decomposition technique that partitions the graph into a set of outerplanar graphs and provides an approximate solution with a proven performance ratio. We conduct a comprehensive computational experiment to investigate the empirical performance of the algorithm. Computational results demonstrate that the empirical performance of the algorithm surpasses its guaranteed performance. We also apply the same decomposition approach to develop a decomposition-based heuristic, which is much more efficient than the approximation algorithm in terms of computation time.

40|$|Kara and Tansel (Management Science, Volume 47, 2001, 1408 [...] 1420) {{introduce}} the latest arrival hub location problem {{as a more}} realistic way of modeling cargo delivery. The key feature of the new model is that each link in the network is served by a single vehicle that makes exactly one trip. As a result, the traffic requiring a particular link {{may be forced to}} wait for all other traffic requiring the same link to arrive. Therefore, the travel time between a particular pair of nodes depends not just on travel times of the links on the path taken, but also on these forced "waiting times," which are called transient times in Kara and Tansel (2001). We show, however, that if the objective function depends only on the maximum travel time, this "new" model is essentially the same as the classical model that ignores the transient times.

40|$|The Center for Integrated Manufacturing Studies (CIMS) is {{studying}} the improvement of military Light Armored Vehicles (LAVs) for the United States Department of Defense. A focus {{of this study is}} the Marine Corps LAVs that are experiencing failures in the planetary assembly which serves as the vehicle 2 ̆ 7 s final drive system. The primary failure source is the bushings that provide the interface between the planet gears and their respective pins. Currently, to detect a bushing failure, vehicle occupants must exit the LAV and place their hand on the wheel <b>hub</b> <b>cover</b> to check for excessive heat. If the hub 2 ̆ 2 feels too hot, 2 ̆ 2 travel must stop so the planetary assembly can cool down. These overheating wheel hubs can lead to catastrophic failure of the planetary assembly. Therefore, CIMS is working to analyze these bushing failures and develop a method that will allow occupants to detect potential bushing failures from inside the moving vehicle. In the past, the relationship of pin-bushing interface temperature and wear showed that temperature does not indicate bushing failure soon enough for practical implementation. It was the intention of this current wear study to evaluate bushing failures using vibration signatures {{as part of an effort}} to develop failure prognostic tools for (future) in-service use. This thesis was conducted as a feasibility assessment study to evaluate bushing failure from a vibration and signal processing standpoint. Accelero meters were used to collect vibration data from the bushings. Collected vibration signatures were analyzed and examined as bushing wear progressed to determine whether or not remaining bushing life could be predicted using vibration signatures. Vibration data was analyzed from an energy standpoint; that is, the band power was calculated for several frequency bands of interest. Band power was plotted versus bushing wear to reveal any potential relationship between the two. Test results showed that a direct, linear relationship exists between bushing wear and band power in the 2000 to 2100 Hz frequency range. The results of this thesis suggest that vibration data can be used to identify the severity bushing wear. Since this investigation was conducted as a feasibility assessment, additional work is required before this wear detection method can be implemented on an actual LAV. It is recommended that similar bushing wear-vibration studies be conducted where bushings are tested on the Mustang dynamometer (at CIMS) and then on an actual LAV...|$|E

40|$|Graphs are {{becoming}} {{one of the most popular}} data modeling paradigms since they are able to model complex relationships that cannot be easily captured using traditional data models. One of the major tasks of graph management is graph matching, which aims to find all of the subgraphs in a data graph that match a query graph. In the literature, proposals in this context are classified into two different categories: graph-at-a-time, which process the whole query graph at the same time, and vertex-at-a-time, which process a single vertex of the query graph at the same time. In this paper, we propose a new vertex-at-a-time proposal that is based on graphlets, each of which comprises a vertex of a graph, all of the immediate neighbors of that vertex, and all of the edges that relate those neighbors. Furthermore, we also use the concept of minimum <b>hub</b> <b>covers,</b> each of which comprises a subset of vertices in the query graph that account for all of the edges in that graph.

The limited predictability, non-linearity, and self-organized criticality of the flares allow us to study systems of flares in the field of the complex systems. Both the occurrence time and the location of flares detected from January 1, 2006 to July 21, 2016 are used to design the growing flares network. The solar surface is divided into cells with equal areas. The cells, which include flare(s), are considered as nodes of the network. The related links are equivalent to sympathetic flaring. The extracted features present that the network of flares follows quantitative measures of complexity. The power-law nature of the connectivity distribution with a degree exponent greater than three reveals that flares form a scale-free and small-world network. The great value of the clustering coefficient, small characteristic path length, and slowly change of the diameter are all characteristics of the flares network.

40|$|Wheels {{are one of}} {{the major}} noise sources of landing gears. Accurate {{numerical}} predictions of wheel noise can provide an insight into the physical mechanism of landing gear noise generation and can aid in the design of noise control devices. The major noise sources of a 33 % scaled isolated landing gear wheel are investigated by simulating three different wheel configurations using high-order numerical simulations to compute the flow field and the FW-H equation to obtain the far-field acoustic pressures. The baseline configuration is a wheel with a hub cavity and two rim cavities. Two additional simulations are performed; one with the <b>hub</b> cavity <b>covered</b> (NHC) and the other with both the hub cavity and rim cavities covered (NHCRC). These simulations isolate the effects of the hub cavity and rim cavities on the overall wheel noise. The surface flow patterns are visualised by shear stress lines and show that the flow separations and attachments {{on the side of the}} wheel, in both the baseline and the configuration with only the <b>hub</b> cavity <b>covered,</b> are significantly reduced by covering both the hub and rim cavities. A frequency-domain FW-H equation is used to identify the noise source regions on the surface of the wheel. The tyre is the main low frequency noise source and shows a lift dipole and side force dipole pattern depending on the frequency. The hub cavity is identified as the dominant middle frequency noise source and radiates in a frequency range centered around the first and second depth modes of the cylindrical hub cavity.

Shipping lines attempt to maintain network simplicity, with limited ports of call, considering the overall cost aspects of the entire service network. As an example, maintaining a single <b>hub</b> port to <b>cover</b> multiple neighboring regions could be cost effective, but it requires multiple feeder links. However, some shipping lines select ports not called by many other services to create and expand their cargo bases.

Moreover, the possibilities of obtaining berth windows, on-arrival berths, virtual terminal agreements, and so on are highlighted as important attractive features. Regarding network types, interviews revealed that, although hub and spoke networks dominate, shipping lines currently focus on relay networks as well due to the opportunities of deploying their own mainline vessels. However, a relay network cannot be used independently in many cases without counting on feeder lines due to the capacity limitations of minor ports.|$|R
40|$|Wheels are signiﬁcant {{landing gear}} noise sources. In this project, {{high-order}} numerical simulations {{were conducted to}} investigate the landing gear wheel noise generation mechanisms and noise reduction treatments. The high-order solver solves the Navier-Stokes equations on multiblock structured grids. In this work, a modiﬁed solver was developed based on cell-centred formulation, which can provide more accurate solutions than cell-vertex space. This solver applies a ﬁnite-diﬀerence scheme at interior control points and at block interfaces with smooth grid metrics. At discontinuous block interfaces, a ﬁnite-volume method is employed as an interface condition. Two sets of interpolation schemes were developed to apply the ﬁnite volume method. This cell-centred high-order solver is accurate and robust for aeroacoustic simulations of complex geometries. The numerical solver was applied to investigate the major noise sources of a 33 % scaled isolated landing gear wheel by simulating three diﬀerent wheel conﬁgurations using a hybrid CFD/FW-H approach. The conﬁgurations simulated include a baseline wheel with a hub cavity and two rim cavities. Two additional simulations were performed; one with the <b>hub</b> cavity <b>covered</b> {{and the other with}} both the hub cavity and rim cavities covered. The tyre is the main low frequency noise source and shows a lift dipole and side force dipole pattern depending on the frequency. The hub cavity is identiﬁed as the dominant middle frequency noise source and radiates in a frequency range centred around the ﬁrst and second depth modes of the cylindrical hub cavity. The rim cavities are the main high-frequency noise sources. The largest noise reduction is achieved by covering both hub and rim cavities in the hub side direction. Simulations of two wheels in tandem were also performed to study the wheel interaction noise at diﬀerent angles of attack. The interaction noise is greatest at zero angle of attack, radiating towards the two sideline directions with a spectral peak at StW = 0. 19, based on the width of the wheel. The dominant interaction noise source is the upstream shoulder of the downstream wheel. The wheel interaction noise is reduced at positive angles of attack, as less of the downstream wheel is immersed {{in the wake of the}} upstream wheel. A gap fairing was simulated, and it can signiﬁcantly reduce the interaction noise by eliminating large-scale turbulent structures in the gap region.

40|$|In Uganda, use of {{high-quality}} agricultural inputs like hybrid seed, agrochemicals, and fertilizer is extremely low. This depresses farm incomes {{and contributes to}} low agricultural productivity that continues to be hampered by poor agronomic practices, low quality germplasm, declining soil fertility, and losses due to pests, disease, and postharvest handling practices. Low levels of agricultural technology adoption have been compounded {{by a lack of}} farmer trust in the current inputs supply system, which has been plagued by counterfeiting. Counterfeit products range from benign fake or adulterated materials to banned substances that are harmful to crops and human health. Counterfeit agricultural inputs directly reduce productivity and, together with the perception of widespread counterfeiting, reduce demand for high-quality inputs. This lowers input prices and reduces profits for producers of genuine products, causing a form of “adverse selection” in which counterfeit products push high-quality genuine products out of the market. In the face of this problem, United States Agency for International Development (USAID) through the Feed the Future (FTF) initiative is supporting the development of a program for input quality assurance called e-verification (EV). E-verification involves labeling genuine agricultural inputs with a scratch-off label that provides an authentication code {{that can be used to}} confirm that the labeled product is genuine. Given the potential importance of this initiative, USAID is funding an independent impact evaluation of the effectiveness of the EV system at improving adoption {{of high-quality}} inputs and reducing the prevalence of counterfeiting. The impact evaluation will estimate the impact of the e-verification scheme on each of these outcomes and will examine how the e-verification project achieved its results. To undertake the impact evaluation, IFPRI conducted a baseline survey of communities, shops, and households. This survey resulted in the dataset contained in this study. The team identified ten major maize growing regions, termed market <b>hubs,</b> which <b>covered</b> districts (and surroundings) of Hoima, Iganga, Kasese, Kiboga, Luwero, Masaka, Masindi, Mbale, Mityana, and Mubende.

Within each market location, a matched pair of two villages was sampled. The baseline survey was targeted towards ten households in each of the 240 villages (LC 1 s). The sample ultimately resulted in 2, 378 households being surveyed. The study is designed to measure the impact of e-verification interventions on glyphosate herbicide, hybrid maize seed and inorganic fertilizer.

Participaram do pÃlo empÃrico 89 mÃes e pais cegos, prioritariamente mulheres (53, 9 %), com cegueira de nascenÃa (55, 1 %), idade mÃdia de 37, 91 anos, nÃo casados (52, 8 %), ensino mÃdio (60, 7 %) e exercendo atividade remunerada (56, 2 %), provenientes dos estados de Pernambuco (51, 6 %) e PiauÃ (41, 6 %). A maioria atribuiu nota cinco a todos os itens. As melhores pontuaÃÃes vieram da faixa etÃria entre 30 e 39 anos, casados e com renda familiar entre 2, 2 e seis salÃrios mÃnimos. Dentre os tÃpicos da tecnologia, todos apresentaram mÃdias favorÃveis, sendo melhor avaliado o conteÃdo (91, 1 Â 11, 7), seguido de acesso online (84, 4 Â 18, 9) e aspectos pedagÃgicos (82, 9 Â 15, 9). Os resultados viabilizam a hipÃtese que a TA âCuidando da alimentaÃÃo do bebÃâ Ã meio vÃlido e viÃvel de disseminaÃÃo de informaÃÃes a pais cegos. Ao fim deste estudo, vislumbra-se que o enfermeiro deve utilizar a construÃÃo da TA como estratÃgia de promoÃÃo da saÃde com clientes cegos. Blind {{people have}} children and, {{due to their}} sensory limitation, they experience difficulties {{to take care of}} their children. Complementary feeding of infants is critical, as it involves not only foods, but also preparation, hygiene and offering. Nursing assists blind people through the development of assistive technology (AT), granting them autonomy and independence. The objective was to validate AT for blind parents about complementary feeding of infants, available online. Study as Pasquali (2010) model undertaken between August/ 2011 and March/ 2013 at the Health Communication Laboratory of Universidade Federal do CearÃ. The theoretical and methodological framework consisted of theoretical, empirical and analytic hubs. The theoretical <b>hub</b> <b>covered</b> the construction of the technology through an integrative review and the consultation of specialized materials; assessment of the AT by experts in child health and pedagogical aspects and online access by blind people; and a pilot test with blind people, natural or adoption fathers and mothers, as from the age of 18 years. The empirical hub included the assessment of the AT by a large number of blind mothers and fathers. All participants answered instruments using a Likert scale ranging from one to five, with one indicating the worst and five the best score. The analytic hub permitted the statistical analysis of the data. The qualitative variables were analyzed using the Chi-Square test and likelihood ratio. The means and standard deviation of the quantitative variables were calculated and the means for the topics were compared using Studentâs t-test for independent data or Snedecorâs F-test (ANOVA). Inferential statistical analyses were considered significant when p< 0. 05. Approval for the project was obtained from the Research Ethics Committee at Universidade Federal do CearÃ. The AT entitled âTaking care of the infantâs feedingâ discussed the types of complementary foods; offering food to the child; preparation of the childâs food and hygiene of the child and was made available on the website www. labcomsaude. ufc. br. When assessed by nine experts, three from each area, they suggested: corrections in content information, non-professional language, references to the parentsâ blindness in the text, access mechanisms. After the adjustments, the experts predominantly scored all items as five, confirming the appropriateness of their content and access to the target public. Eighty-nine blind mothers and fathers participated in the empirical hub, mainly women (53. 9 %), blind from birth (55. 1 %), mean age 37. 91 years, not married (52. 8 %), secondary education (60. 7 %), having a paid job (56. 2 %), from the states of Pernambuco (51. 6 %) and PiauÃ (41. 6 %). The best scores came from the age range between 30 and 39 years, married and with a family income between 2. 2 and six minimum wages. Among the topics addressed in the technology, all obtained favorable mean scores. The highest score was for the content (91. 1 Â 11. 7), followed by online access (84. 4 Â 18. 9) and pedagogical aspects (82. 9 Â 15. 9). The results permit the hypothesis that the AT âTaking care of the infantâs feedingâ is a valid and feasible means to transmit information to blind parents. At the end of this study, it is considered that nurses should use the construction of AT as a health promotion strategy with blind clients...|$|R
