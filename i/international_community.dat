5|$|In 1978, when Vietnamese leaders {{launched}} their invasion of Kampuchea {{to remove the}} Khmer Rouge regime, they did not expect a negative reaction from the <b>international</b> <b>community.</b> However, the events that followed the invasion showed that Vietnamese leaders had severely miscalculated international sympathies towards their cause. Instead of backing Vietnam, most United Nations member countries denounced the Vietnamese {{use of force against}} Kampuchea, and even moved to revive the battered Khmer Rouge organisation that had once governed the country with such brutality. Thus, more than just a military problem, Kampuchea quickly evolved into an economic and diplomatic problem for Vietnam on the international arena. Throughout the decade in which Vietnam occupied neighbouring Kampuchea, the Vietnamese Government, and the PRK regime which it installed, were placed {{on the periphery of the}} <b>international</b> <b>community.</b>|$|E

5|$|After {{the scale}} of the damage became clear, the {{government}} of Yemen requested for assistance from the <b>international</b> <b>community.</b> The hardest hit areas had poor infrastructure, which caused difficulties in communications as relief goods were distributed.

Agencies under the United Nations provided food and logistical support. Relief efforts continued to make progress until 2011 due to a political uprising in Yemen.|$|E
