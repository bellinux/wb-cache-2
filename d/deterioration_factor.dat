40|$|This paper {{presents}} the time-variant flexural reliability {{analysis of a}} RC highway bridge strengthened with CFRP. Three <b>deterioration</b> <b>factors</b> are dealt with. The first is the growth of traffic live load over time. The second is the resistance deterioration of steel reinforcing bars due to corrosion. The third is the deterioration due to aging of CFRP. The reliability analysis is performed implementing five flexural failure modes. A Monte-Carlo simulation is used to develop time-dependent statistical models for steel areas and daily live load extreme effects. The reliability of a RC bridge CFRP-strengthened interior beam, designed in accordance to AASHTO-LRFD (Load and Resistance Factor Design) specifications, is evaluated under various traffic volumes, different corrosion environments and strengthening configurations. The results of the analysis have shown that, among the <b>deterioration</b> <b>factors,</b> corrosion has the most significant effect on a bridge service life followed by live load growth.

To achieve the objective, {{a large number of}} long term pavement performance (LTPP) test sites were set up throughout the six SEQ regions. The methodology for the selection of the SEQ-LTPP test sites and the rationale behind the design of the LTPP site selection matrix are discussed. Pavement condition data were collected from the LTPP test sites over a period of five years. Modelling of the pavement deterioration at the test sites were carried out using SMEC pavement management system (SMEC PMS) with HDM-III deterioration models. The aim was to determine the most appropriate HDM-III roughness <b>deterioration</b> <b>factors</b> for the six regions covered in the study. Three statistical techniques namely; linear rate of roughness deterioration (LRRD), regression analysis and statistical t test approach were used in analysing the roughness data obtained from the LTPP sites and the predicted roughness data generated by SMEC PMS.

40|$|Abstract. The {{durability}} of a concrete structure is most significantly {{influenced by the}} corrosion of reinforcing bars, {{rather than by the}} deterioration of concrete itself. The corrosion of reinforcement bars due to chloride serves as a main <b>deterioration</b> <b>factor</b> at the interface between the bars and the concrete in the concrete structure. Accordingly, the corrosion inhibitors are widely used to improve the resistance to chloride penetration into reinforced concrete. Corrosion inhibitors are generally divided into the anode-type inorganic inhibitors and anode-cathode-type organic inhibitors, in terms of the reaction type. It is known that when the Cl:OH concentration ratio exceeds 0. 6 %, film on passive state metal on the bar-concrete interface is damaged and local corrosion starts regardless of the chloride ion content. In this study, the performance of the corrosion inhibitor was examined using a potentiostat, with chloride ion contents of 1. 2 kg/m 3 (as reference), 2. 4 kg/...|$|E
