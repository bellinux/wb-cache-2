5|$|On 28 February 2011, MLS {{announced}} that for their qualification, United would play the Philadelphia Union in a play-in game for U.S. Open Cup qualification. The decision for United {{to play the}} Union {{was due to the}} Union's proximity to United, and their relative record during the 2010 season. The match will be played 6 April 2011 at the Maryland SoccerPlex. United hosts the Union due to winning a coin flip.

5|$|Parthian art can {{be divided}} into three geo-historical phases: the art of Parthia proper; the art of the Iranian plateau; and the art of Parthian Mesopotamia. The first genuine Parthian art, found at Mithridatkert/Nisa, {{combined}} elements of Greek and Iranian art in line with Achaemenid and Seleucid traditions. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>phase,</b> Parthian art found inspiration in Achaemenid art, as exemplified by the investiture relief of Mithridates II at Mount Behistun. The third phase occurred gradually after the Parthian conquest of Mesopotamia.|$|E
5|$|The {{first phase}} saw the {{addition}} of an inner railway track, {{which was designed to}} take a third of the weight of the telescope. The outer railway track, which had been decaying and sinking over the previous years, was relaid <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>phase.</b> Four bogies and their steelwork were added on the inner track, and the existing bogies on the outer track were overhauled.|$|E
5|$|Operation Southern Move was to {{be carried}} out in two stages.

The whole operation was planned to take four days, immediately preceding a country-wide ceasefire scheduled to take effect on the morning of 12 October 1995. According to Brigadier Ante Kotromanović, then commander of the 126th Home Guard Regiment, the offensive was approved by the United States, and U.S. warplanes attacked VRS positions near Banja Luka in preparation of the offensive.|$|E

5|$|The {{second phase}} of {{construction}} added three salient bastions, each of which were over {{twice the size of}} the northern bastion. The new bastions were placed along the part of al-Rahba's citadel that faced the desert to the west. The builders <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>phase</b> also reinforced al-Rahba's walls with roughly cut conglomerate blocks fixed together by high-quality mortar. In the third phase, higher quality mudbrick was used, the western curtain wall was elevated and the southwestern curtain wall was replaced and decorated with bands of Arabic inscriptions. In addition, a large, brick dome was built atop the ground-level chamber of the northwestern bastion. The external walls of the fortress reached their final form during the third phase, though there would be further restorations in later decades.|$|E
5|$|Work {{began on}} cutting the ditch around Conwy Castle {{within days of}} Edward's decision. The work was {{controlled}} by Sir John Bonvillars and overseen by master mason James of St. George, and {{the first phase of}} work between 1283 and 1284 focused on creating the exterior curtain walls and towers. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>phase,</b> from 1284 and 1286, the interior buildings were erected, while work began on the walls for the neighbouring town. By 1287, the castle was complete. The builders recruited huge numbers of labourers from across England for the task. At each summer building season the labourers massed at Chester and then walked into Wales. Edward's accountants did not separate the costs of the town walls from that of the castle, but the total cost of the two projects came to around £15,000, a huge sum for the period.|$|E
5|$|Al-Talaba {{maintained}} their {{performance in the}} 2005–06 Iraqi Premier League by finishing the first phase as the leaders of Group Four with 24 points from seven wins, three draws and two losses. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>phase,</b> they finished in second place with seven points behind Al-Quwa Al-Jawiya, who had {{the same number of}} points but a better goal difference of +4 against Al-Talaba's +1. In the last match of the second phase, Al-Talaba faced Al-Quwa Al-Jawiya with a chance to retain the league leadership, but they lost 3–1. From 2–9 September 2005, Al-Talaba participated in the 2005 Damascus International Championship, reaching the final against fellow Iraqi club Al-Zawra'a. Al-Talaba won 5–4 on penalties. In the 2005–06 Arab Champions League, Al-Talaba won their first round tie against Al-Shabab by 3–1 in the first leg and 4–1 in the second leg. They faced Al-Qadisiyah in the second round and were defeated 1–0 in the first leg and 2–1 in the second leg to be eliminated the competition.|$|E

5|$|Al-Talaba {{participated in}} the 2003–04 Arab Champions League, {{reaching}} the proper group stage where they finished in third place with three points. Before {{the start of the}} 2004–05 season, Al-Talaba {{participated in the}} 2004 Damascus International Championship. They played three games in the tournament, winning two and losing one, being knocked out in the group stage. They also participated in the 2004 Tishreen Cup, one week after they were knocked out of the Damascus International Championship. In the Tishreen Cup, they finished top of their group to qualify for the semi-finals. They defeated Tishreen SC 1–0 to reach the final, which they lost by 3–2 to fellow Iraqi club Al-Zawra'a. In the 2004–05 Iraqi Premier League, Al-Talaba finished the first phase as leaders of Group Three with 28 points, having won eight matches, drawn four and lost four. They also became leaders of Group Two <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>phase</b> with eight points, ahead of Al-Naft who had seven points, after winning two matches and drawing two. In the semi-finals, Al-Talaba came up against Al-Quwa Al-Jawiya; they were beaten in the first leg 1–0 and drew the second leg 2–2. Al-Talaba won the third-place play-off against Al-Zawra'a 4–2 on penalties after a 1–1 draw.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the start}} of the 2007–08 season, Al-Talaba participated in the 2007 Press Club Championship, hosted in Syria. Al-Talaba drew both of their group stage matches, {{finishing}} second in their group to qualify for the semi-finals. In the semi-final, they lost 3–1 against Nawair SC and were knocked out. Al-Talaba considered withdrawing from the 2007–08 Iraqi Premier League due to a financial crisis that led to their players not being paid all their salaries on time, but eventually decided not to withdraw. Under the management of Karim Saddam, Nabil Zaki and Karim Salman, Al-Talaba finished in fifth place in {{the first phase of the}} league with 36 points, having won nine matches, drew nine, and lost four. They played poorly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>phase,</b> ending the phase in third place in their group with seven points with only one win, four draws, and three losses. They were knocked out in the round of 32 in the 2007–08 Arab Champions League, losing 4–0 on aggregate to USM Alger. In the 2008–09 Iraqi Premier League, with Abdul Ghani Shahad as Al-Talaba's manager, they finished in third place in their group with 47 points, only three points behind Najaf FC, with 14 wins, five draws, and five losses.|$|E
5|$|Foraging {{behaviour}} {{depends on}} the type of termite. For example, certain species feed on the wood structures they inhabit, and others harvest food that is near the nest. Most workers are rarely found out in the open, and do not forage unprotected; they rely on sheeting and runways to protect them from predators. Subterranean termites construct tunnels and galleries to look for food, and workers who manage to find food sources recruit additional nestmates by depositing a phagostimulant pheromone that attracts workers. Foraging workers use semiochemicals to communicate with each other, and workers who begin to forage outside of their nest release trail pheromones from their sternal glands. In one species, Nasutitermes costalis, there are three phases in a foraging expedition: first, soldiers scout an area. When they find a food source, they communicate to other soldiers and a small force of workers starts to emerge. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>phase,</b> workers appear in large numbers at the site. The third phase is marked by a {{decrease in the number of}} soldiers present and an increase in the number of workers. Isolated termite workers may engage in Lévy flight behaviour as an optimised strategy for finding their nestmates or foraging for food.|$|E

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>Second</b> <b>Phase,</b> events play in vaguely {{the same}} fashion, {{but there are}} minor variations: Lorica forms an {{alliance}} with Milites rather than being conquered, and while Concordia offers an alliance, Imperial sympathizers within Concordia orchestrate the Queen's death and ally with Concordia. After overcoming Lorica and Concordia, the Rubrum forces storm the Militesi capital and Cid is killed. Before dying, he warns the Cadet and his comrades of the Crystals' role in Orience's cycle. When Tempus Finis arrives, Ace goes alone to find the one mentioned by Cid. He is himself marked as a l'Cie and transformed into Judge Ace. As with the previous cycle, he is defeated, but Tempus Finis arrives and the cycle continues. In a final side story episode, various additional stories revolving around the main cast are revealed. Among the events presented are a talk between Myuria and Arecia as to whether to continue the experiment, and then Lean and Tono are chosen by Arecia to exist outside the cycle and retain their memories. In this new form, the two agree to gather the memories of Orience's people {{and find a way}} of liberating the world from its cycle. The story ends with them wishing the Cadet well, saying that they hope to meet them again in a future cycle.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>phase</b> of attacks, shipping, coastal airfields, {{radar and}} {{stations}} south of London were attacked during 8–18 August. The Luftwaffe gradually increased {{the frequency of}} attacks. German bombers also raided targets {{as far north as}} Liverpool during night hours. The first major raid inland and against RAF airfields came on 12 August. RAF Hawkinge, Lympne, Manston and radar stations at Pevensey, Rye and Dover were to be destroyed. Portsmouth docks were also targeted. The results of the raids were mixed. The Radar station at Ventnor was badly damaged and others targeted were also damaged, but not destroyed. All were in working order by the following morning. The attacks against the harbour and RAF stations had failed to destroy them. All were not in fully working order {{by the end of the}} day, but were back in action the following morning. Unknown to German intelligence, Lympne itself was not even an operational station. This sort of intelligence blunder contributed to the failure of Adlertag.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>phase</b> of the operation, the 17th Infantry Brigade {{exploited}} the breach {{made in the}} perimeter, and pressed south {{as far as a}} secondary line of defences known as the Switch Line. On the second day, the 16th Infantry Brigade captured the township of Bardia, cutting the fortress in two. Thousands of prisoners were taken, and the Italian garrison now held out only in the northern and southernmost parts of the fortress. On the third day, the 19th Infantry Brigade advanced south from Bardia, supported by artillery and the Matilda tanks, now reduced in number to just six. Its advance allowed the 17th Infantry Brigade to make progress as well, and the two brigades reduced the southern sector of the fortress. Meanwhile, the Italian garrisons in the north surrendered to the 16th Infantry Brigade and the Support Group of the British 7th Armoured Division outside the fortress. In all, some 36,000 Italian prisoners were taken.|$|E

5|$|The Louisiana Maneuvers pitted Krueger's Third Army against Lieutenant General Ben Lear's Second Army. The {{maneuvers}} were a test {{ground for}} doctrine and equipment, and gave senior commanders experience in maneuvering their formations. In the first phase, Krueger quickly proved {{himself to be}} the more modern general. He responded adroitly to a changed battle situation by re-orienting his front from northeast to northwest, {{and was able to}} inflict a series of reverses on Lear's forces. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>phase,</b> Krueger had a superior force, and had to advance on Shreveport, Louisiana. Lear's forces conducted a stubborn withdrawal, demolishing bridges in order to slow Krueger down. Krueger responded by sending Major General George S. Patton, Jr.'s 2nd Armored Division on a wide flanking maneuver through Texas. Afterwards, Eisenhower became the head of the War Plans Division, and was replaced by Colonel Alfred M. Gruenther. After he too was transferred, Krueger replaced him with Colonel George B. Honnen.|$|E
5|$|The {{battalion}} {{arrived in}} Egypt on 18 May 1940, {{and joined the}} 17th Brigade's other two infantry battalions in camp at Beit Jirja. A further period of training in Palestine followed before the battalion {{took part in the}} fighting against the Italians in Libya in January–February 1941, during which the 2/5th was involved in attacks on Bardia and Tobruk, as the Australians went into battle for the first time. During the fighting around Bardia, the battalion's commander, Wrigley, was seriously wounded in an artillery bombardment, and was temporarily replaced by Major George Sell, as the battalion was committed to the fighting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>phase</b> of the assault, advancing through the bridgehead that had been established towards the railway switchline. Later, during the assault on Tobruk, the 2/5th was tasked with conducting a diversionary attack to the east of the Italian perimeter. The battalion's time in Libya cost it 32 killed, and 60 wounded.|$|E
5|$|After Zhou and Lin {{negotiated}} Stalin's approval, Peng {{attended a}} conference in Beijing with Mao, Zhou, and Gao Gang on October 18, and they ordered {{the first wave of}} Chinese soldiers—in total more than 260,000 men—to cross into Korea on the night of October 19. On October 25 the PVA had its first confrontation with UN troops at Onjong and Unsan, and pushed the UN forces south of the Chongchon River by November 4 in the aftermath of First Phase Campaign. From November 24 to December 24, Peng directed 380,000 PVA troops to confront UN forces <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Second</b> <b>Phase</b> Campaign, and he successfully recovered the area north of the thirty-eighth parallel. Despite his personal reservations, Peng then began an ambitious campaign to take the area south of the 38th parallel in order to fulfill Mao's political objectives for the war. About 230,000 Chinese soldiers crossed into South Korean territory on December 31 and captured Seoul as part of the Third Phase Campaign, but were forced to evacuate it with heavy losses on March 14, 1951 as the UN forces counterattacked during the course of Fourth Phase Campaign. Peng launched a final Fifth Phase Campaign from April 22 – June 10 to retake Seoul with 548,000 Chinese troops, but it failed, and the Korean War came to a standstill just above the 38th parallel. In the evaluation of Korean War historian Roy Edger Appleman, Peng's performances in the war were unremarkable in terms of military talents despite his aggressiveness and leadership skills. During the Cultural Revolution, Red Guards claimed that Peng's successful campaigns, from October–December 1950, were fought under Mao's direction, but that his unsuccessful campaigns, from January–May 1951, were organized by Peng against Mao's instructions. Modern scholars reject this interpretation, and credit Peng with both the successes and failures of the war.|$|E
