25|$|Streptococcus dysgalactiae form large colonies (>0.5cm) after 24 {{hours of}} incubation, and produce haemolysis on blood agar; SDSD is alpha-haemolytic, whereas SDSE is {{predominantly}} beta-haemolytic. They are facultative anaerobic, incapable of respiratory metabolism, but are aerotolerant. Growth {{is enhanced by}} incubation in 5% CO2 atmosphere, but they usually grow adequately in ambient air. The optimum temperature for growth is approximately 37° Celsius. Lancefield group C and <b>G</b> <b>carbohydrate</b> antigens are predominantly expressed, but group A and L have been documented. However, the above characteristics are not unique to S.dysgalactiae, and further testing is required to confirm the species identity. Although many laboratories currently identify bacteria by mass-spectrometry (Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption/ionization Time Of Flight (MALDI TOF MS), phenotypic testing is still widely used. Unlike Streptococcus pyogenes (harbouring Lancefield group A antigen), S.dysgalactiae is PYR-negative and Bacitracin resistant. The distinction from the Streptococcus anginosus group (Lancefield A, C, G or F) {{can be made by}} colony size and Voges Proskauer test (VP); the S.anginosus group being VP positive. Streptococcus equi contains Lancefield group C, and Streptococcus canis harbours group G, but unlike S.dysgalactiae, they are both Hyaluronidase negative.|$|E

50|$|The GI {{was invented}} in 1981 by Dr Thomas Wolever and Dr David Jenkins at the University of Toronto and {{is a measure of}} how quickly a food {{containing}} 25 or 50 grams of carbohydrate raises blood-glucose levels. Because some foods typically have a low carbohydrate content, Harvard researchers created the GL, which takes into account the amount of carbohydrates in a given serving of a food and so provides a more useful measure. Liu et al. were the first to show that based on their calculation, the glycemic load of a specific food—calculated as the product of that food's carbohydrate content and its glycemic index value—has direct physiologic meaning in that each unit can be interpreted as the equivalent of 1 <b>g</b> <b>carbohydrate</b> from white bread (or glucose depending on the reference used in determining the glycemic index). It became immediately apparent that such direct physiological quantification of glycemic load would allow patients with diabetes to do “glycemic load” counting as opposed to the conventional “carbohydrate counting” for monitoring the glycemic effect of foods. The concept of glycemic load addresses the concern about rating foods as good or bad {{solely on the basis of}} their glycemic index. For example, although the glycemic index for carrots is reported to be as high as 131, the glycemic load for one serving of carrots is small because the amount of carbohydrate in one serving of carrots is minimal (≈7 <b>g</b> <b>carbohydrate).</b> Indeed, ≈700 g carrots (which provides 50 <b>g</b> <b>carbohydrate)</b> must be consumed to produce an incremental glucose response 1.31 times that of 100 g white bread containing 50 <b>g</b> <b>carbohydrate.</b>|$|E

However, these factors could also negatively affect renal function. We investigated changes in renal function after a 12 -wk resistance exercise program combined with protein supplementation in community dwelling older adults. Patients (N = 237, 73. 7 ± 5. 7 y, 58. 2 % female) participated in a 12 -wk resistance exercise program (3 times/wk) designed to increase strength and muscle mass of major muscle groups. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three dietary supplements consumed directly after training: whey protein drink (20 g whey protein, 20 <b>g</b> <b>carbohydrates),</b> milk protein drink (20 g milk protein, 20 <b>g</b> <b>carbohydrates),</b> or <b>carbohydrate</b> drink (40 <b>g</b> <b>carbohydrates).</b> Renal function was estimated as glomerular filtration rate (GFR, Cockcroft-Gault formula), and dietary intake was measured as 3 -d-weighed food record at baseline and endpoint. During the intervention, energy intake did not increase. Carbohydrate intake increased in the carbohydrate group and protein intake increased in the milk group, both approximately in accordance with the supplementation. In the whey group, protein intake did not increase, but carbohydrate intake did. GFR increased after the intervention (+ 4. 4 mL/min/ 1. 73 m 2; P < 0. 001), and the changes were similar in men and women or in the age quartiles. Changes in GFR at endpoint were not associated with LBM, dietary supplements, or total protein intake. A 12 -wk resistance exercise program combined with protein supplementation in community dwelling older adults does not negatively affect GFR. The supplementation had only minor effects on total dietary intake...|$|R

50|$|An {{adjuvant}} (from Latin adiuvare - to help) is any substance, {{distinct from}} antigen, which enhances immune response by various mechanisms: recruiting of professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs) {{to the site}} of antigen exposure; increasing the delivery of antigens by delayed/slow release (depot generation); immunomodulation by cytokine production (selection of Th1 or Th2 response); inducing T-cell response (prolonged exposure of peptide-MHC complexes 1 and stimulation of expression of T-cell-activating co-stimulators 2 on the APCs' surface) and targeting (e. <b>g.</b> <b>carbohydrate</b> adjuvants which target lectin receptors on APCs). Adjuvants have been used as additives to improve vaccine efficiency since the 1920s. Generally, administration of adjuvants is used both in experimental immunology and in clinical settings to ensure a high quality/quantity memory-enhanced antibody response, where antigens must be prepared and delivered in a fashion that maximizes production of a specific immune response. Among commonly used adjuvants are Complete and Incomplete Freund's adjuvant and solutions of aluminum hydroxide or aluminum phosphate.|$|E
50|$|Authentic bird's-nest soup is {{made from}} nests of some species of swiftlet, mainly the edible-nest (or white-nest) swiftlet (Aerodramus fuciphagus) and the black-nest swiftlet. Instead of twigs, {{feathers}} and straw, these swiftlets make their nest only from strands of their gummy saliva, which hardens when exposed to air. Once the nests are harvested, they are cleaned and sold to restaurants. Eating swiftlet nest material is believed to help maintain skin tone, balance qi ("life energy") and reinforce the immune system. It is also believed to strengthen the lungs and prevent coughs, improve the constitution and prolong life.
