40|$|In this study, {{we attempt}} to {{experimentally}} {{address the question of}} whether p,p′-dimercaptoazobisbenzene (DMAB) can be produced from p-aminothiophenol (PATP) by surface photochemistry reaction in the <b>junctions</b> <b>of</b> a Ag nanoparticle-molecule-Ag (or Au) film. First, utilizing surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectra, we provide experimental and theoretical evidence that DMAB can be produced from PATP by surface photochemistry reaction in the <b>junctions</b> <b>of</b> a Ag nanoparticle-molecule-Ag film. Second, we investigate the SERS spectra utilizing both experimental and theoretical approaches, ultimately revealing that DMAB cannot be produced from PATP in the <b>junctions</b> <b>of</b> a Ag nanoparticle-molecule-Au film. The electromagnetic enhancements are estimated with three-dimensional finite-difference time domain methods, which are about 9 × 105 times in the <b>junctions</b> <b>of</b> Ag nanoparticle-PATP-Ag/Au films. 1...|$|R

5|$|All of Midler Avenue, {{including}} {{the portion of}} the street not currently part of NY598 in DeWitt, was originally designated as NY433 in the early 1950s. At the time, NY433 ended at the <b>junction</b> <b>of</b> Midler Avenue and Court Street Road (then NY298). By 1954, New Court Avenue, an east–west connector between NY298 and NY433 in DeWitt, was designated as NY436. In the late 1950s, construction began on a bypass of Court Street that extended from the western terminus of NY436 in Salina to the <b>junction</b> <b>of</b> NY298 and Thompson Road (modern NY635) in DeWitt. The bypass was opened to traffic as a realignment of NY298 by 1961. NY433 was then extended northeastward along NY298's former routing on Court Street to Carrier Circle, where it met the realigned NY298.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{the above}} sites, several {{domestic}} sites existed within Cheadle Hulme. These provided sleeping, eating and washing facilities for the Airmen and women stationed at RAF Handforth. Grove Lane park {{was the site of}} an Officers' mess, Cinema, NAAFI, Post Office, chapel and bath house among other buildings. The Grove, near the <b>junction</b> <b>of</b> Grove Lane and Pingate Lane, was Nissen hut accommodation, as were the flats on Gillbent Road opposite the shops and the large field at the <b>junction</b> <b>of</b> Longsight Lane and Stanley Road. The remains of the air raid shelters can still be seen at this location to this day. The wooded area to the rear of numbers 48–64 Hall Moss Lane also housed an officers' mess, NAAFI, post office, chapel and bath house.|$|E

5|$|In 1908, the New York State Legislature created Route20, an {{unsigned}} legislative route {{extending from}} Elbridge to Rochester via Fairport. Initially, Route20 entered the village on High Street and followed Main Street south across the Erie Canal to Church Street, where it turned west toward Rochester. On March1, 1921, Route20 was realigned to enter Monroe County on modern NY31. At the <b>junction</b> <b>of</b> Palmyra and Moseley Roads, Route20 turned north, following SH1290 into Fairport. It rejoined its original alignment at the <b>junction</b> <b>of</b> Church and Main Streets.

5|$|The {{decline of}} heavy {{industry}} in the 20th century left Windy Nook with no major employer and there was little {{in terms of economic}} activity. There is no major commercial area and residents usually travel to neighbouring Felling town centre to shop or use the small shopping area at the <b>junction</b> <b>of</b> Windy Nook Road and Carr Hill Road/Albion Street. However, in November 2011, planning permission was approved for conversion of the Black House Inn at the <b>junction</b> <b>of</b> Carr Hill Road and Coldwell lane into a 'Tesco Extra' store. The approval was granted in spite of complaints and concerns as to noise and traffic being raised by local residents. This store is now the largest employer in Windy Nook, employing around 20 staff.|$|E
