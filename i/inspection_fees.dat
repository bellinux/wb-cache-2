5000|$|Cooperative {{traders and}} {{exporters}} can sell coffee as Fairtrade certified if they meet the political standards of FLO and they pay a certification and <b>inspection</b> <b>fee.</b> Other administration costs and production costs are incurred {{to meet these}} standards.

50|$|In {{mortgage}} securitization transactions, {{the mortgage}} servicer forwards the borrower's {{payment of principal}} and interest to the certificate holders (investors) of the special securitized trust that owns and holds the promissory notes secured by the mortgages and deeds of trust. The mortgage servicer, however, is allowed to retain late fees, BPO fees, <b>inspection</b> <b>fees,</b> and other fees charged or assessed to a borrower's account. In addition to the fee income, the servicer is allowed to retain the net liquidation proceeds of any foreclosure sale (net after foreclosure expenses and principal balance to investors). This provides an incentive to unscrupulous servicers who aggressively interpret mortgage documents to add additional fees to a borrower's mortgage account. Many times, the additional fees added on create an event of default allowing the mortgage servicer to foreclose on the property.

5000|$|To use an example; Fair trade coffee packers in {{developed}} countries pay a fee to their country's Fairtrade organization {{for the right to}} use the brand and logo. Nearly the entire fee goes to marketing. Packers and retailers can charge as much as they want for the coffee. The coffee has to come from a certified Fairtrade cooperative, which pays certification and <b>inspection</b> <b>fees.</b> The importer is obliged to pay the exporter a base price which keeps the price from sinking below that level.It is sometimes higher than the going world price, but at times when coffee prices are high, it may be lower than the going price. There is also an additional [...] "producer premium" [...] (20c/lb for coffee). For a few products, like coffee, there is also a minimum price.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that if bidders have {{independent}} private values and homogeneous entry costs a …rst- or second-price auction with a reserve price equal to the seller’s value maximizes social surplus and seller revenue, and leaves bidders with no surplus. Further, in mixed strategy entry equilibria, social surplus and seller revenue decrease with the number of bidders. We show that when entry costs are heterogeneous (and private information) the revenue maximizing reserve price is above the seller’s value, a positive <b>inspection</b> <b>fee</b> (and a reserve price equal to the seller’s value) generates even more revenue, and in either case bidders capture informational rents. Further, seller revenue and social surplus may either increase or decrease with the number of bidders. Nevertheless, seller revenue is asymptotically the same whether entry costs are homogeneous or heterogeneous. Our results are framed in terms of screening values rather than reserve prices, and apply to any standard auction...|$|R

5000|$|The Fairtrade Foundation {{does not}} monitor {{how much of}} the extra money paid to the {{exporting}} cooperatives reaches the farmer. The cooperatives incur certification and <b>inspection</b> <b>fees,</b> additional marketing costs, costs in meeting the Fairtrade political standards, and possibly costs arising from the monopoly power of the cooperative. Farmers also incur additional production costs on all of their production, even if only a small amount is sold at Fairtrade prices. Over the years, Fairtrade producers have only been able to sell 18% to 37% of their output as Fairtrade certified, selling the rest without certification at world prices. While both proponents and opponents of Fairtrade acknowledge this problem, there are scarce economic studies presenting the actual revenues of Fairtrade cooperatives and how they spend their money. Weber (2006) examined the additional marketing costs of some cooperatives and found, for example, that '[...] [...] after six years Oro Verde can cover only 70 percent of its marketing costs with its current income stream' and that the cooperative needs to double its current annual export volume in order to sustain its management team. At the time they were losing money on their Fairtrade membership. FLO figures show that 40% of the money reaching the developing world is spent on 'business and production', which includes the costs mentioned above as well as costs incurred by any inefficiency and corruption in the cooperative or the marketing system. The rest is spent on social projects, rather than being passed on to farmers.|$|E
30|$|However, this {{procedure}} has drawbacks for determining responsibility as there still exists {{a possibility that}} agencies mix the eels for export, owing to farms producing small amounts. Although the rules of this two-stage inspection procedure demands that each eel from every pond is inspected before export (second stage), agencies may not have all eels from every pond inspected to save on <b>inspection</b> <b>fees.</b> If an eel is found to contain drug residues, {{it is difficult to}} confirm the farm where it was produced because of the possibility of agencies or dealers having mixed all the eels together. Another worrying aspect is that Taiwan exports about 20, 000 tons of eel to Japan annually; if every batch weighs about 2 tons, this equates roughly to 10, 000 batches requiring inspection, and as every batch needs to be inspected twice, 20, 000 inspections are needed. Assuming 200 working days per year, 100 batches require inspection every day. At present, sampling is done by the Eel Farmers’ Association, and this places a large burden on that body. Inevitably, mistakes occur.|$|E

40|$|Building {{regulations}} set {{minimum requirements}} for safe, healthy, energy-efficient and accessible buildings. To guarantee that these requirements are applied, a building control system is indispensable. The trend towards a common market for construction {{products and services}} justifies gaining a better insight into the building control systems in the European Union (EU). This paper presents {{a comparison of the}} building permit procedures adopted in the 27 EU countries. To collect the necessary information, a questionnaire on building regulatory systems was distributed to national experts in each country and the major legal documents were reviewed. The information was organized in thematic tables containing all the countries. The main conclusion is that the organization of a regular building permit procedure is similar in the EU countries. No major differences were found concerning the several steps it takes to get a building permit and to carry out a construction work: pre-consultation, possibility of phasing, submission demands, checks carried out and maximum procedure time for plan approval, possibility and moment to object to a building permit being issued, start of construction works, frequency and moment of site <b>inspections,</b> <b>fees,</b> and completion of construction works. The main differences concern detail aspects in several of these steps. There is one basic type of building permit procedure in countries from continental Europe. The United Kingdom countries are those presenting more deviations from the common pattern. These deviations aim to reduce the burden of administrative aspects, while ensuring good levels of compliance. In the last 10 to 15 years, the dominant trends identified in the building permit procedure were a decrease in the types of construction works submitted to building authorities’ control during plan approval, and the reduction in the maximum building permit procedure times. Building authorities’ control during the construction phase has remained unchanged. Altogether, there is a movement towards simpler and faster building permit procedures. For the near future, no major changes are expected in the building permit procedures. OTB ResearchOTB Research Institute for the Built Environmen...|$|R
