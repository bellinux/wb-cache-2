The <b>flacon</b> of the perfume is inspired by apothecary bottles and is made to resemble a magical potion, featuring a light golden colour scheme.|$|E

Categorised as a floral oriental perfume, Wild Elixir features top notes of cassis and mandarin; heart notes of honeysuckle flower, orange blossom, and peach fruit accord; the base notes consist of benzoin resin, patchouli, and sandalwood. The <b>flacon</b> of the perfume {{is similar to}} the original one, but instead features a contrasting colour scheme of golden and black. The packaging was again designed by Estrada and features illustrations of flowers and wild cats set on a brownish orange background and {{is similar to the}} look of the African savannah.|$|E

According to Jose Manuel Albesa, chief brand officer of Puig, it is inspired by the bottles used in the historic medical practice of apothecary. In an interview with Latina, Shakira revealed {{that she wanted to}} [...] "depict the kind of bottle that was used in ancient times, but that looked modern and chic as well" [...] {{and come up with a}} design similar to a magical potion, which is the definition of the word 'elixir'. As the scent is inspired by the desert, she chose the tint of the bottle to be golden so that it can [...] "evoke the memories of sands and sunsets". The packaging of the fragrance was designed by Colombian artist Catalina Estrada and features colourful illustrations of various birds and leaves printed on a pale background.|$|E

40|$|English {{abstract}} The fundamental goal of {{this thesis}} includes {{a closer look at}} the glass-making industry of flaconware in Bohemia during the 19 th century and the early 20 th century. The first chapter provides a brief introduction to the history of <b>flacons</b> as containers for fragrances and their use in different countries. Perfume bottles have been in use since ancient times for the preservation of fragrances. The chapter describes the emergence of the first <b>flacons</b> and different techniques for their production. The second chapter provides insight into the centers of production of scent bottles in Bohemia. There were several production centers, where the perfume bottles were manufactured. Glass factories varied in methods of production, ornamentation techniques and stylistic orientation. The chapter introduces the most significant glass factories, where the flaconware was developed. The third chapter is dedicated to the situation in the Czech flaconware in the first half of the 19 th century. The political situation in Europe influenced the appearance of Czech <b>flacons.</b> Classicism and, subsequently, the Empire style from France were adopted. Since the 30 s the style tendencies of flaconware had turned to the use of elements of Biedermeier. In Bohemia during this period can be observed experiments with techniques [...] ...|$|R

60|$|Nevertheless, however courageously I formed this resolution, you cannot but {{too well}} guess the {{difficulties}} I must needs have felt in carrying it into execution; since want of habitual intercourse with the charmers {{of the other}} sex has rendered me a sheepish cur, only one grain less awkward than thyself. Then she was so very beautiful, and assumed an air of so much dignity, that I was like to fall under the fatal error of supposing she should only be addressed with something very clever; and in the hasty raking which my brains underwent in this persuasion, not a single idea occurred that common sense did not reject as fustian on the one hand, or weary, flat, and stale triticism on the other. I felt as if my understanding were no longer my own, but was alternately under the dominion of Aldeborontiphoscophornio, {{and that of his}} facetious friend Rigdum-Funnidos. How did I envy at that moment our friend Jack Oliver, who produces with such happy complacence his fardel of small talk, and who, as he never doubts his own powers of affording amusement, passes them current with every pretty woman he approaches, and fills up the intervals of chat by his complete acquaintance with the exercise of the fan, the <b>FLACON,</b> and the other duties of the CAVALIERE SERVENTE. Some of these I attempted, but I suppose it was awkwardly; at least the Lady Green Mantle received them as a princess accepts the homage of a clown.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- A {{protocol}} {{has been}} developed for the manufacture of model miniature cheeses. Pas-teurised milk (63 OC x 30 min) at 31 °C was placed in each of 6 wide-mouth centrifuge bottles (200 mL). The standard protocol for the manufacture of Cheddar cheese was then followed up to corn-pletion of cooking. When the pH of the curd rcached 6. 2, curds and whey in the bottles were centrifuged for 60 min at 1700 g. The supematant whey was drained and the matted curd {{was held in the}} bottles in a water bath at 36 "C and turned every 15 min until pH of the curd reached 5. 2 - 5. 3. The acidified curd, inverted with respect to the first centrifugation, was recentrifuged at 1 700 g for 20 min. After whey drainage, the miniature cheeses (20 - 22 g) werc immersed in brine (20 % NaCI and 0. 05 % CaCI 2) for 30 min and then vacuum packed. Chee ses were analysed for rnoisture, salt and pH; statistical anal-ysis showed no significant (P> 0. 05) variation within a batch, between batches made on the same day or on different days. Miniature cheeses were compared to a control Cheddar chee se (made in a pilot plant from 20 L milk) after 2 or 4 months of ripening at 8 oc. The miniature cheeses were similar to the control in terms of gross composition, proteolysis and sensory scores. The model system devel-oped in this study will be useful for screening the cheesemaking properties of starters, adjuncts or enzymes or for small-scale work involving expensive reagents. © Inra/Elsevier, Paris. miniature cheeses / Cheddar cheese / model cheese system Résumé- Protocole de fabrication de mini-fromages.

40|$|This report {{contains}} lectures {{presented at}} the 4 th expert meeting of Sueddeutsche Kunststoff-Zentrum (Wuerzburg, Federal Republic of Germany) on Transparent Plastics-Innovations in Processing and Application in Wuerzburg, April 28 th until April 29 th 2003. This meeting contributes to transparent plastics and proceedings in processing and application of transparent plastics. The first lectures deals with polycarbonate, synthesized by melt transesterification. Semifinished polycarbonate products are used as roof materials in stadiums and thermal baths. Transparent poly(methyl methacrylate) is produces non-dazzling light. As an additive, transparent PMMA is used for high-speed spinning of poly(ethylene terephthalate) and in displays of electronic devices and flat screens. Further applications of transparent PMMA are related to lighting technology, construction of aquariums and protection or removal of graffities. New products are styrene-butadiene-block copolymers with a particularly bright colour. Methyl methacrylate-acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene copolymers have an increased thermal stability and tenacity. Aliphatic polyamides have a transparent neutral own colour and a low density. These materials are applied to spectacle frames, scratch-resistant lenses and <b>flacons</b> in the cosmetic industry. The synthesis of polyolefins by means of metallocene catalysis results in products with a unique combination of optical, mechanical and processing technological properties. Fields of application are household articles, Lufthansa catering boxes and packaging for CD-ROM and DVD. Topas Cycloolefine Copolymers are transparent polyolefins offering protection against moistness and enabling unbreakable and transparent syringes. Poly(ethylene terephthalate) is an innovative material with manifold applications in modern packaging such as plastic films and foils, casting foils, biaxial orientated foils or as a packaging for juice and beer concerning to its high oxygen and carbon dioxide barriere. High-performance plastics such as poly(arylene ether sulfone), poly(ether sulfone) or poly(ether imide) are used as secretion container in the medicine, packaging in household articles, microwave dishes for example. The precise moulding of thick-walled plastic materials is a great challenge in the optics. With respect to the optimization of the production process, Fries Research and Technology GmbH (Bergisch Gladbach, Federal Republic of Germany) developed a measuring instrument to study the surface of moulded articles. The advantage of this instrument is the point by point measurement and measurement by line at variable defined measuring tasks. Further lectures deal with optical polymer fibres for data exchange over short distances, microstructured transparent surfaces of plastics with optical functions for sun-protective systems or components of displays, biocide surfaces for the increase of anti-microbial efficiency of products and transparent scratch-resistant coatings.
