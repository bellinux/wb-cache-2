25|$|Australia {{began the}} fifth day looking to knock over England's last wicket quickly, and set a modest chase, but Dilley and Emburey were {{determined}} to drag it out as long as possible. They remained for close to two hours, add 37 to England's overnight score, but finally succumbed when Hughes bowled a short pitched delivery to Dilley, who could only fend the ball <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> hands of David Boon. He was out for 24, and Emburey had made an excellent 36 not out, England finishing on 359 all out. Whilst it was England's best score of the series so far, it still only left Australia with a target of 117 to win.|$|E

25|$|England won the toss {{and chose}} to field – a {{decision}} which looked correct {{as the new}} ball bowlers found plenty of movement of the pitch. However, they failed {{to take advantage of}} this situation, and the two wickets earned during the first session of play were due to lbw decisions that the batsmen could consider themselves unlucky to get out to. The biggest wicket of the day for England was that of Kumar Sangakkara, who pulled a ball out to deep square leg <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> hands of Monty Panesar. He had scored 46, but looked set for a much larger score. At the end of the day’s play, Sri Lanka were 147/4, but with Mahela Jayawardene still at the crease.|$|E

25|$|Instead of {{providing}} {{pressure from the}} center out like with a bladder press, the membrane of a membrane press is mounted {{on one side of}} the press horizontally between the two ends. On the opposite ends are drain screens that allow the release juice to drain through <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> press pan. Like a bladder press external pressure is applied by pressurized air (rarely water) that gradually inflates the membrane that gently presses the grapes against the drain screen. The advantage of this style of press is the gentle pressure and minimal movement of the grapes, which minimizes the amount of tearing and scouring of the skins and seeds. This limits the amount of suspended solids and extracted phenolics in the pressed wine. Also, many membrane presses are fully enclosed, allowing for anaerobic winemaking without any exposure to oxygen. In addition to the same labor and time disadvantages (some presses can take 2 to 4 hours a batch) of the other batch presses is that these computerized and enclosed membrane press are often some of the more expensive pieces of equipment a winery can buy.|$|E

25|$|Nomad {{is ordered}} to repair {{one of the}} carrier's damaged nuclear reactors. The Nanosuit is {{resistant}} {{to high levels of}} radiation, although prolonged exposure proves deadly. While Nomad is in the reactor room, Helena sends an experimental signal through Nomad's suit that causes several alien machines to absorb too much power and overload, destroying them. As Nomad returns to the flight deck, Admiral Morrison is killed and Nomad takes the prototype TAC-Cannon. On the flight deck, Nomad fights an alien exosuit similar to the one that killed Strickland. A massive alien warship then emerges from the sea, and Helena manages to deactivate its shields by sending a signal through Nomad's Nanosuit. Nomad then uses the TAC-Cannon to destroy the alien warship, which crashes down onto the carrier and begins to sink it. Nomad runs across the flight deck and jumps off the carrier <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> VTOL, which is piloted by Psycho. As they fly away, Helena is nearly pulled out of the aircraft by the energy field created by the destroyed alien warship. The ship drags the Constitution beneath the surface and vaporizes, creating a massive vortex that engulfs and destroys the entire carrier fleet. Psycho then receives a transmission that there is another carrier strike group en route to the island and suggests meeting them. Nomad protests, claiming that since they now know how to defeat the aliens, they need to continue fighting. A transmission from Prophet, who is inside the energy field on the island, is then received. The VTOL is then seen turning around and heading back to the island.|$|E

On the right side were a series of rooms which included generator/ventilation rooms and the telephone switchboard. On the left side was Eva Braun's bedroom/sitting room (also known as Hitler's private guest room), an ante-chamber (also known as Hitler's sitting room), which led into Hitler's study/office. On the wall hung a large portrait of Frederick the Great, [...] one of Hitler's heroes. A door led into Hitler's modestly furnished bedroom.

500|$|Fisher {{would serve}} just {{over four years}} of his sentence. On February 10, 1962, he was {{exchanged}} for the shot-down American U-2 pilot Francis Gary Powers. The exchange {{took place on the}} Glienicke Bridge that linked West Berlin with Potsdam, which became famous during the Cold War as the Bridge of Spies. At precisely the same time, at Checkpoint Charlie, Frederic Pryor was released by the East German Stasi <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> arms of his father. A few days later Fisher, reunited with his wife Elena and daughter Evelyn, flew home.

The myth of the master spy Rudolf Abel replaced the reality of Fisher's illegal residency. Yet the party hierarchy was well aware that Fisher had achieved nothing of real significance. During his eight years as an illegal resident he appears not to have recruited, or even identified, a single potential agent.|$|E

500|$|In 1962, cabana motel owners Jay Sarno and Stanley Mallin {{applied for}} a $10.6 million loan from the Teamsters Central States Pension Fund. He began {{plans to build a}} hotel on land owned by Kirk Kerkorian. Sarno would later act as {{designer}} of the hotel he planned to construct. His vision was to emulate life under the Roman Empire. The objective of the palace was to ensure an atmosphere in which everybody staying at the hotel would feel like a Caesar. Caesars Palace was instrumental in beginning a new era of lavish casinos from the late 1960s onward. Architectural writer, Alan Hess, stated: [...] "Caesars Palace needed only a sumptuous array of Classical statuary and a host of marble-white columns to establish its theme. The visitor's imagination, in league with well-placed publicity, filled in the opulence". Jefferson Graham wrote that the result was [...] "the gaudiest, weirdest, most elaborate, and most talked about resort Vegas had ever seen.

500|$|Swarms of army ants are an {{important}} resource used by some species of antbird, and the one from which the family's common name is derived. Many species of tropical ant form large raiding swarms, but the swarms are often nocturnal or raid underground. While birds visit these swarms when they occur, the species most commonly attended by birds is the Neotropical species Eciton burchellii, which is both diurnal and surface-raiding. It was once thought that attending birds were actually eating the ants, but numerous studies {{in various parts of}} Eciton burchellii's range has shown that the ants act as beaters, flushing insects, other arthropods and small vertebrates <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> flocks of [...] "ant followers". The improvement in foraging efficiency can be dramatic; a study of spotted antbirds found that they made attempts at prey every 111.8 seconds away from ants, but at swarms they made attempts every 32.3 seconds. While many species of antbirds (and other families) may opportunistically feed at army ant swarms, 18 species of antbird are obligate ant-followers, obtaining most of their diet from swarms. With only three exceptions, these species never regularly forage away from ant swarms. A further four species regularly attend swarms but are as often seen away from them. Obligate ant-followers visit the nesting bivouacs of army ants in the morning to check for raiding activities; other species do not. These species tend to arrive at swarms first, and their calls are used by other species to locate swarming ants.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the first}} quarter, the Rams {{got off to}} a good start as they marched down the field to the Viking 2-yard line. The drive stalled there, and coach Chuck Knox, recalling the NFC {{championship}} game in Minnesota two years ago (when the Rams were intercepted in the end zone after driving to the Viking 2-yard line) ordered a field goal attempt. Nate Allen blocked the field goal attempt, and the ball bounced off the ground right <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> arms of Bobby Bryant, who returned it 90 yards for a Minnesota touchdown. [...] The first quarter ended with the Rams dominating the stat sheet.

2500|$|The 1980 {{season is}} still fondly remembered by Browns fans. After going 3–3 {{in the first}} six games, the Browns won three {{straight}} games with fourth-quarter comebacks, and stopped a late comeback by the Baltimore Colts to win a fourth. The Browns won two more games in that fashion {{by the end of the}} season, and even lost a game to the Minnesota Vikings on the last play when a Hail Mary pass was tipped <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> hands of Ahmad Rashād. Sipe passed for 4,000 yards and 30 touchdowns with only 14 interceptions (enough for him to be named the NFL MVP), behind an offensive line that sent three members to the Pro Bowl: Doug Dieken, Tom DeLeone, and Joe DeLamielleure. The [...] "Kardiac Kids" [...] name stuck. A fourth-quarter field goal by Don Cockroft in the final game against the Bengals helped the Browns capture the division with an 11–5 mark, with the Oakland Raiders their opponent in the team's first playoff game in eight years. However, a heartbreaking end to this dramatic season came in the closing seconds when Rutigliano called what became known as [...] "Red Right 88" [...] and had Sipe pass toward the end zone, only to watch Oakland's Mike Davis intercept the ball. The Raiders went on to win the Super Bowl, and [...] "Red Right 88" [...] has numbered among the list of Cleveland sports curses ever since.|$|E

2500|$|Despite the UDA women {{having found}} Ogilby guilty, the two UDA men {{present at the}} [...] "trial" [...] couldn't reach a verdict and gave orders that she be released. The women drove her to the Glengall Street bus station where she got on a bus headed for the YWCA hostel she had moved to on the Malone Road. The women then [...] "rearrested" [...] her. It was alleged that this {{decision}} came about after she sarcastically remarked in reference to Douglas, [...] "Who does she think she is? The Queen?" [...] which had freshly infuriated Douglas and the others. Blocking the bus as it {{pulled out of the}} station into the street, Douglas and her [...] "Heavy Squad" [...] then boarded the bus and dragged her off <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> car for a further grilling. Minutes later, after being alerted by the bus station staff, the car was stopped by the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC). Although Douglas claimed {{they were on their way}} to a party, the querying policeman told the women about the report of one of them having been forced off the bus. In an attempt to mollify Douglas, Ogilby then spoke up admitting that she was the person who had been removed from the bus but that [...] "It was nothing. Just a couple of us fooling around". The police however remained unconvinced of their claims and the eight women and Ogilby were taken into the RUC Queen Street station for questioning. All of the women were asked for their names and addresses; the majority lived in the Sandy Row area. [...] Fearing the grisly fate that typically befell informers, Ogilby did not say anything to the RUC about the UDA kangaroo court or threats against her. Therefore, she and the eight other women were released without being charged the following morning at 2.00 a.m. Ogilby returned to the police station a few hours later, visibly frightened, but was sent home in a taxi after refusing to give the reason for her distress. That same day inside a Sandy Row pub, Douglas told the other women that Ogilby was a troublemaker who had to die, and she speedily made arrangements to facilitate the murder.|$|E
