25|$|Fritz Perls {{presented}} {{his theory of}} dreams {{as part of the}} holistic nature of <b>Gestalt</b> <b>therapy.</b> Dreams are seen as projections of parts of the self that have been ignored, rejected, or suppressed. Jung argued that one could consider every person in the dream to represent an aspect of the dreamer, which he called the subjective approach to dreams. Perls expanded this point of view to say that even inanimate objects in the dream may represent aspects of the dreamer. The dreamer may, therefore, be asked to imagine being an object in the dream and to describe it, in order to bring into awareness the characteristics of the object that correspond with the dreamer's personality.|$|E

The aim of {{this study}} was to explore and {{describe}} the experiences of professionals utilizing sensory-motor play (SMP) with young children (YC) in <b>Gestalt</b> play <b>therapy</b> in order to provide recommendations for professionals and to create an awareness of the value of SMP in <b>Gestalt</b> play <b>therapy.</b> Coming from an occupational therapy background, the researcher became aware of the potential value of utilizing sensorymotor play in <b>Gestalt</b> play <b>therapy</b> with YC. SMP, being a vital part of the sensory integration developmental process of YC, promotes body awareness through muscle movement and control. Awareness is one of the major aims of <b>Gestalt</b> play <b>therapy.</b> All the senses contribute to YC's awareness, including the frequently unacknowledged vestibu lar and proprioceptive senses. In order to treat YC holistically, the developmental importance of SMP should be acknowledged and integrated in the therapy process. Professionals young children working in this field, coming from diverse educational backgrounds, do not necessarily have the knowledge or experience of the utilization of SMPwith YC. A qualitative research approach with a case study research design was adopted in order to explore and describe the experiences of professionals regarding the utilization of SMP with YC in <b>Gestalt</b> play <b>therapy,</b> through applied research. The empirical data was collected by conducting two focus group discussions with professionals from diverse educational backgrounds. Two main themes with different sub-themes and categories were identified by analysing the data. The main themes are that participants are of the opinion that SMP enhances the therapeutic relationship and that SMP has a self-regulatory function.

40|$|Thesis (MA (Psychology)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2013. The changed {{appearance}} {{as a result}} of burns for a child in middle childhood years has several implications in terms of its physical, emotional, and social development. It seems that the burnt child in middle childhood years can benefit from therapeutic assistance, and specifically, empowerment. As far as the researcher could determine, <b>Gestalt</b> play <b>therapy</b> has not yet been utilized for this purpose nor has there been research done in connection to this. For the purpose of this study, the value of the <b>Gestalt</b> play <b>therapy</b> process, as described by Oaklander, in empowering the burn victim in the middle childhood years is explored and described. Consultations with experts as well as a literature review was undertaken in order to obtain background information about the <b>Gestalt</b> play <b>therapy</b> process, with specific reference to the empowerment aspect as well as the implications of the burn wounds and burn marks on the burn victim in the middle childhood years. The literature studied produced a theoretical framework within which this study was performed. Following the literature review, an empirical investigation into <b>Gestalt</b> play <b>therapy</b> was used, with the focus on empowerment. A qualitative study was conducted with a single case study as data collection method. For the duration of the empirical study, 17 therapeutic sessions were conducted with the participant, within the framework of qualitative research investigation. Data collected was described, analysed, and verified through a literature study.

2500|$|Fritz Perls, {{who helped}} to develop <b>Gestalt</b> <b>therapy,</b> was {{influenced}} by Reich, Jung and Freud.

[...] These wholes, called gestalts, are [...] "patterns involving all the layers of organismic function – thought, feeling, and activity." [...] Neurosis is seen as splitting {{in the formation of}} gestalts, and anxiety as the organism sensing [...] "the struggle towards its creative unification." [...] <b>Gestalt</b> <b>therapy</b> attempts to cure patients through placing them in contact with [...] "immediate organismic needs." [...] Perls rejected the verbal approach of classical psychoanalysis; talking in <b>gestalt</b> <b>therapy</b> serves the purpose of self-expression rather than gaining self-knowledge. <b>Gestalt</b> <b>therapy</b> usually takes place in groups, and in concentrated [...] "workshops" [...] rather than being spread out {{over a long period of}} time; it has been extended into new forms of communal living.|$|E
40|$|Text in AfrikaansThe {{utilization}} {{value of the}} paradoxical theory of change in <b>Gestalt</b> Play <b>Therapy</b> with adolescents Adolescents undergo significant changes on physical, emotional, and cognitive levels during this development stage. These changes have a great influence on their self-awareness. Most adolescents experience great problems with {{who they are and}} who they should be according to the expectations of others. This causes a never-ending process of efforts to change. Change can only take place if the adolescent is who he is, but not if he tries to be what he is not. The consequence hereof is that change cannot take place in the adolescent, because he should first become aware of who he is. The awareness of who he is leads to change. The paradoxical theory of change is all about being who one is and not about trying to be what others expect one to be. The adolescent should be accompanied to become aware of who he is, by utilization of the paradoxical theory, {{in order to be able}} grow and change. The aim of this study was to explore and describe the {{utilization value}} of the paradoxical theory of change in <b>Gestalt</b> Play <b>Therapy</b> with adolescents. In order to achieve this goal, the research process was directed by qualitative research, and triangulation was utilized as a technique for gathering information. Out of the processing and integration of conclusions drawn during the empirical investigation, data could contribute to exploration and description of the assessment of the paradoxical theory of change in <b>Gestalt</b> play <b>therapy</b> with adolescents.
