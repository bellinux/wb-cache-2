Among the factors are Security Culture, Management and Employee Commitment, Security Assessment, Security Policy, Documentation and Communication, Process Control, Continuous Security Improvement, Security <b>Incidents</b> <b>Handling</b> and Business Partners Security. The model was tested empirically through in-depth interviews with high-rank security professionals from shipping companies in Singapore who confirmed the importance of these security factors. However, further validation of the model will be conducted. The model will also be further developed into a security management toolbox that would help senior management in shipping companies to manage security effectively...|$|R

40|$|This study {{seeks to}} {{understand}} the factors influencing the adoption of an <b>incident</b> <b>handling</b> strategy by organisational cloud service users. We propose a conceptual model that draws upon the Situation Awareness (SA) model and Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) to guide this research. 40 organisational cloud service users in Malaysia were surveyed. We also conduct face-to-face interviews with participants from four of the organisations. Findings from the study indicate that four PMT factors (Perceived Vulnerability, Self-Efficacy, Response Efficacy, and Perceived Severity) have a significantly influence on the adoption of cloud <b>incident</b> <b>handling</b> strategy within the organisations. We, therefore, suggest a successful adoption cloud <b>incident</b> <b>handling</b> strategy by organisational cloud service users involves the nexus between these four PMT factors.
