5000|$|Wide {{to gauge}} trap points have {{switches}} {{that work in}} opposite directions and are therefore either both open or both closed. Vehicles derailed at these points will tend to continue in a forward direction rather than being thrown to one side. Wide to gauge points are typically found on sidings situated <b>between</b> <b>running</b> <b>lines.</b>|$|R
50|$|The station's running layout {{has three}} tracks, with the centre track having {{platforms}} {{on each side}} meaning that it can handle trains running in either direction. A siding <b>between</b> the <b>running</b> <b>lines</b> {{to the north of}} the station allows trains from Central London to be reversed and run back eastwards. Trains going out of service can return to the below-ground White City depot to the south of the station via sidings <b>between</b> the <b>running</b> <b>lines.</b>|$|R

50|$|On {{the other}} side of federal highway 170 {{opposite}} the main entrance is the station’s east wing. Several bay platforms are arranged in an elevated position <b>between</b> the <b>running</b> <b>lines</b> from the north and south hall. These are mainly used for stabling short sets.|$|R
50|$|Two storage {{tracks are}} located <b>between</b> the <b>running</b> <b>lines</b> {{north of the}} station for use by trains {{terminating}} at this station. On {{the west side of}} the station lies the Kawagoe maintenance depot, which is responsible for minor overhauls of Tojo Line rolling stock.|$|R
50|$|A {{turnback}} siding {{is located}} <b>between</b> the two <b>running</b> <b>lines</b> {{just to the}} south of the station for peak hour terminating services from Melbourne.|$|R
50|$|There were minimal goods {{facilities}} {{at the station}} and the station had an island platform with the buildings on the platform <b>between</b> the two <b>running</b> <b>lines.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{stop here}} serves Queens Drive {{and other parts}} of Ramsey, and is the closest stop to the famous Queen's Pier, {{landmark}} of the town. At this point the <b>line</b> becomes inter-urban, <b>running</b> parallel to the roadway, notably featuring traction poles mounted {{at the side of the}} line, rather than <b>between</b> the <b>running</b> <b>lines</b> as is standard elsewhere.|$|R
50|$|The {{station has}} two island {{platforms}} serving four tracks, with the station building located above, {{and at a}} right angle to the platforms. There are two storage tracks adjacent to platform 1, and four storage tracks located <b>between</b> the <b>running</b> <b>lines</b> on the down (Kawagoe) side of the station, {{as well as a}} permanent way maintenance storage siding next to platform 4 at the south (Ikebukuro) end of the station.|$|R
50|$|The {{station is}} {{sometimes}} {{used as a}} terminus for trains travelling north, instead of them continuing to Edgware. Some regular off-peak service patterns {{in recent years have}} seen all trains joining the Edgware branch from the Bank branch terminating at Colindale, though this was not the pattern in 2009. Reversal of trains at this station makes use of a turn-back siding, situated <b>between</b> the <b>running</b> <b>lines</b> north of the station.|$|R
50|$|Sections of {{the route}} between the former Elliot Junction station and Arbirlot have become a nature walk. The site of Elliot Junction station remains part of the {{operational}} railway between Dundee and Aberdeen, with {{the outline of the}} central island platform visible <b>between</b> the two <b>running</b> <b>lines.</b>|$|R
25|$|In 1917 the Princes Bridge {{locomotive}} depot was closed, {{and replaced by}} the Jolimont Workshops. Built {{as part of the}} electrification of the Melbourne suburban network, it was the main storage, servicing and maintenance depot for the new fleet of suburban trains. The workshops was erected to the south along Batman Avenues, with the storage sidings located <b>between</b> the <b>running</b> <b>lines.</b> A footbridge ran from Flinders Street across the entire yard to provide access for train drivers.|$|R
50|$|A {{double track}} entry by tunnel led to three {{terminal}} platforms. Further spurs were provided as a bay platform for parcels {{and a short}} one for a station pilot locomotive. All pointwork was grouped together in the station throat, switching <b>between</b> the main <b>running</b> <b>lines</b> and platforms being by two crossovers: one facing, one trailing.|$|R
50|$|In 1872, the South Wales Railway was re-gauged from {{broad gauge}} to {{standard}} gauge. By 1875 the wire works was also {{served by a}} level crossing and a crossover <b>between</b> the two <b>running</b> <b>lines,</b> controlled by a signal box. It is likely that this relaying was carried out earlier, {{as part of the}} re-gauging work.|$|R
50|$|Built {{as part of}} the {{electrification}} of the Melbourne suburban network, it was {{the main}} storage, servicing and maintenance depot for the new fleet of suburban trains. The workshops was erected to the south along Batman Avenues, with the storage sidings located <b>between</b> the <b>running</b> <b>lines.</b> The site had been home to the Princes Bridge locomotive depot built in 1888. This depot had replaced a small engine shed located east of the station of the same name and built in 1859 by the Melbourne and Suburban Railway Company.|$|R
50|$|To {{alleviate}} congestion which frequently sees loaded trains queuing, in November 2013 construction commenced on five relief roads at Hexham {{that will}} be located <b>between</b> the two <b>running</b> <b>lines,</b> with the westbound line relocated further south. This will allow coal trains to be pass one another and reach the ports in a more logical order. It is scheduled for completion in 2015.|$|R
50|$|The station {{currently}} has six London Underground tracks, {{with the two}} Jubilee line tracks in the centre flanked in turn by the Slow and Fast (outermost) Metropolitan line tracks. Fast trains call at the station only during off-peak periods (Northbound during the morning peak and southbound during the evening peak). Both Metropolitan and Jubilee line trains may start or end their service at the station. Jubilee line trains that terminate at Wembley Park reverse via sidings <b>between</b> the <b>running</b> <b>lines</b> {{to the north of}} the station. Meanwhile, Metropolitan line trains that terminate at Wembley Park use the fly-under and Neasden depot to reverse.|$|R
50|$|Belgrave and Birstall {{station was}} {{built as a}} part of the Great Central Railway's London Extension and opened to {{passengers}} on 15 March 1899. The station was built to the standard London Extension country station pattern of a single large 'island' platform <b>between</b> the two <b>running</b> <b>lines,</b> on which stood the station buildings, including ticket office and waiting rooms. Access was made by descending a flight of stairs from a road bridge (structure number 363) that crossed the line.|$|R
50|$|Radyr was {{originally}} a major railway junction {{and the location}} of sidings forming a marshalling yard for freight trains used in the industries in the Glamorgan valleys. It was first opened by the Taff Vale Railway in June 1863, and {{was originally}} named Penarth Junction. At one time there were four <b>running</b> <b>lines</b> through the station, up and down passenger and up and down goods on the Taff Vale main line to the valleys northwards and via Llandaff to Cardiff and the docks to the south east. Immediately south of the station, the Cardiff City line diverged southwards and reached the east side of Cardiff via Waterhall Junction, en route to the harbour at Penarth. The marshalling yard was south of the station in the fork <b>between</b> the <b>running</b> <b>lines.</b> Following the down-turn in coal traffic; the marshalling yard closed (in 1993) and the sidings were greatly rationalised, becoming a permanent way depot. The platforms were also rationalised, from five to two, one up and one down.|$|R
5000|$|Volmari [...] "Vomma" [...] Fritijof Iso-Hollo (5 January 1907 - 23 June 1969) was a Finnish runner. He competed at the 1932 and 1936 Olympics in the 3000 m steeplechase and 10000 m and won two gold, one {{silver and}} one bronze medals. Iso-Hollo {{was one of}} the last [...] "Flying Finns", who {{dominated}} <b>distance</b> <b>running</b> <b>between</b> the World Wars.|$|R
5000|$|Treptower Park is {{a railway}} {{station in the}} Alt-Treptow {{locality}} of Berlin. It is served by the S-Bahn lines , , , [...] and [...] and so represents an important interchange point on the Berlin S-Bahn network. The station consists of two island platforms, enabling cross-platform interchange <b>between</b> <b>lines</b> <b>running</b> in the same direction. It is located next to the park of the same name.|$|R
50|$|Rothley {{station was}} {{built as a}} part of the Great Central Railway's London Extension and opened to {{passengers}} on 15 March 1899. The station was built to the standard London Extension country station pattern of a single large 'island' platform <b>between</b> the two <b>running</b> <b>lines,</b> on which stood the station buildings, including ticket office and waiting rooms. The platform at Rothley measures 441 ft long and 33 ft wide at its widest point. Access is made by descending a flight of stairs from a road bridge (structure number 354) that crosses the line.|$|R
5000|$|Both {{electrostatic}} and {{electromagnetic induction}} {{were used to}} develop wireless telegraph systems that saw limited commercial application. In the United States, Thomas Edison, in the mid-1880s, patented an electromagnetic induction system he called [...] "grasshopper telegraphy", which allowed telegraphic signals to jump the short <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> a <b>running</b> train and telegraph wires running parallel to the tracks. [...] This system was successful technically but not economically, as there {{turned out to be}} little interest by train travelers in an on-board telegraph service. During the Great Blizzard of 1888, this system was used to send and receive wireless messages from trains buried in snowdrifts. The disabled trains were able to maintain communications via their Edison induction wireless telegraph systems, perhaps the first successful use of wireless telegraphy to send distress calls.|$|R
50|$|Found {{primarily}} on metro systems, rapid transit light rail networks, and tramways, a reversing headshunt allows certain trains or trams to change direction, even on lines with high traffic flow, whilst others continue through the station. Typically {{there will be}} two <b>running</b> <b>lines,</b> one for each direction of travel, and the headshunt will be positioned <b>between</b> the two <b>running</b> <b>lines,</b> linked to both by points. Although most trains will pass through the station and continue in the same direction, an individual train may be directed into the reversing headshunt, before exiting onto the other <b>running</b> <b>line,</b> in the opposite direction of travel. This procedure allows a greater frequency of trains on a city-centre section of the line, and reduced frequency on the suburban sections, by allowing certain trains to shuttle back and forth only on the city centre part, using the reversing headshunts to change direction within the flow of trains.|$|R
2500|$|Although {{scale and}} gauge are often confused, scale means the ratio between {{a unit of}} {{measurement}} on a model compared with a unit of measurement in corresponding full size prototype, while gauge is the <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> the two <b>running</b> rails of the track. About 60% of the world's railways have a track gauge of [...] known as [...] "standard gauge", {{but there are also}} narrow-gauge railways where the track gauge is less than standard and broad-gauge railways where the gauge is wider. In a similar manner, a scale model railway may have several track gauges in one scale.|$|R
5000|$|Formerly {{there were}} goods and coal sidings {{trailing}} off the Up Line at the Petersfield {{end of the}} station. There was only one crossover <b>between</b> the two <b>running</b> <b>lines,</b> which meant that goods trains that arrived from the Petersfield direction (usually on the 0450 Goods Woking to Rowland's Castle) had to [...] "set-back" [...] into the headshunt and [...] "fly shunt" [...] (i.e. run off) wagons into the sidings rather than propelling them. This was a skilled movement and not normally permitted by the Rule Book. There was also a siding trailing off the up line, Havant side of the station, serving a brickworks adjacent to {{the remains of the}} Castle.|$|R
5000|$|As built, {{the shed}} had four [...] "roads" [...] (tracks) each with an {{individual}} entrance, all under a double-pitched section roof. It had facilities to provide maintenance, coal and water, which was stored in a reservoir in the triangle <b>between</b> the <b>running</b> <b>lines.</b> The shed's fortunes followed the line, by 1886 it {{had been reduced to}} providing motive power for four passenger trains, three of which were local, local shunting and trip working and a handful of goods trains. This level of activity continued well into the 20th Century. New Holland's local services all ran along very level lines, which provided gentle semi-retirement for ancient locomotives and rolling stock, such as ex-MS&LR 2-4-0s and non-corridor clerestory coaches. The writing was on the wall for New Holland shed from 1912 when Immingham Dock and engine shed opened. It soldiered on as an independent entity until 1941 when it became a sub-shed of Immingham, which it remained until at least 1963.|$|R

5000|$|Perranporth station (...) was the {{terminus}} of {{the line}} from 6 July 1903 until completion to Newquay on 2 January 1905; {{it was the only}} passing place between Chacewater and Shepherds until St Agnes station was extended in 1937. The platform was situated <b>between</b> the two <b>running</b> <b>lines,</b> and the accommodation was considerable in expectation of holiday traffic. A small goods yard with a goods shed was situated on the south (right) side {{of the line}}. 3/4 mi beyond the station towards Newquay is the 89 yd Cox or Cocks Viaduct; (50° 19′ 57.3″ N 5° 7′ 51.2″ W) it is still intact. Nothing remains of the station; an industrial estate was developed on the site during the 1970s.|$|R
6000|$|... "One {{would think}} so, my dear, certainly; but, you see, a man having the least {{idea that he}} was watched, which I admit we have no reason for believing that this fellow has, would {{naturally}} choose a very circuitous route. However, I think that we need hardly try so far to the north, to begin with; I should say that the area of our search need go no farther north than Downham, and that <b>between</b> a <b>line</b> <b>running</b> west from that place and the river the child is most likely to be hidden." ...|$|R
50|$|In Germany block posts {{are known}} as Blockstellen (abbreviation: Bk) and are defined as railway {{facilities}} on the open line that, {{as part of a}} block system, mark the end of a block section. They usually have a home signal in each direction and on each <b>running</b> <b>line.</b> They are mainly found where the <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> two railway stations is greater than average.|$|R
5000|$|The {{length of}} an indoor cricket pitch {{is the same}} as a {{conventional}} cricket pitch, and has 3 stumps at each end, but there the similarities end. The pitch is marked in line with the stumps at each end, and is 1.83 metres in width at the batting end and 2.47 metres at the bowling end, with the stumps in the centre, and the middle stumps are 20 metres apart. The popping crease is in front of, and parallel with, the wicket lines at both ends. At the bowler's end, the pitch is specified as the line extending between the return creases and will be called the bowler's crease or the front foot line. The return creases of the pitch at the bowler's end is marked by a lines at right angles to the bowling crease to the line of the wickets. The return creases are marked 1.22 metres from the middle stump on the line of the wicket. The running crease (or non-striking batter's crease), which is the edge of the crease marking nearest the bowling end, is parallel to the popping crease and extends {{from one side of the}} court to the other. The <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> the <b>running</b> crease and the batting crease is 11 metres.|$|R
50|$|The rails {{are laid}} using a UIC 60 kg/metre rail profile, with {{electrically}} welded rails attached to 2.30 metres-long prestressed reinforced concrete sleepers, spaced 60 cm apart with Pandrol clips. The interconnections between the high-speed {{lines and the}} old Florence-Bologna lines are implemented through lines that separate away from the opposing line and pass under or over both new lines rather than crossing over the opposing track on the level. The switches <b>between</b> the two <b>running</b> <b>lines</b> are capable of supporting speeds of up to 100 km/h, while the 15 switches to connecting lines support speeds of up to 160 km/h. The line is electrified at 3 kV DC, and supplied by substations at 16 km intervals. It is proposed to re-electrify the line at 25 kV AC and replace the signalling and train protection system with the European Train Control System to raise the maximum speed from 250 km/h to 300 km/h.|$|R

50|$|The Rhein-Taunus Nature Park, much {{of which}} is wooded, lies within {{community}} limits and abuts residential areas in places. Of particular scenic charm is the ridge <b>running</b> <b>between</b> a <b>line</b> between Niederseelbach and Engenhahn and the local recreation and conservation area of the Theiß valley running parallel thereto. The highest elevation is the Hohe Kanzel at 592 m above sea level. From west to east, a dale runs through the municipal area, over whose slopes Niedernhausen’s residential neighbourhoods stretch. In Oberjosbach is found a 500-year-old oak. North of Niedernhausen, on the Eselskopf, are a few bizarre crag formations {{in the middle of}} the forest (Hohler Stein - “Hollow Stone”).|$|R
5000|$|Born in Prudhoe, Northumberland, Honeyman joined Sunderland's academy {{at the age}} of 10. He {{made his}} {{professional}} debut on 15 February 2015 in the fifth round of the FA Cup, replacing Ricky Álvarez for the final four minutes of a 2-0 loss at Valley Parade. Manager Gus Poyet admitted that Honeyman would have been put on earlier had the team not had injury concerns, admitting that [...] "George would have been coming on earlier because we needed a bit of his <b>running</b> <b>between</b> the <b>lines</b> and ability to make runs". He was included in the matchday squad for one Premier League match that season, remaining unused in a 1-1 draw at Stoke City.|$|R
