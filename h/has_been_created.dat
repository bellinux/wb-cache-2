5|$|Approximately 50 {{people work}} {{together}} in animating and producing an episode of SpongeBob SquarePants. Throughout its run, production of the series has been handled domestically at Nickelodeon Animation Studio in Burbank, California, while the finished animation <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>created</b> overseas at Rough Draft Studios in South Korea. Storyboarding for each episode {{is done by the}} crew in California. The storyboards are then used as templates by the crew in Korea, who animate by hand, color cels on computers, and paint backgrounds. Episodes are finished in California, where they are edited and have music added. Every season, character designs are updated or modified to solve technical issues in the animation.|$|E

5|$|Like all Hawaiian volcanoes, Mauna Kea <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>created</b> as the Pacific {{tectonic plate}} has moved over the Hawaiian hotspot in the Earth's {{underlying}} mantle. The Hawaii island volcanoes {{are the most}} recent evidence of this process that, over 70 million years, has created the -long Hawaiian Ridge–Emperor seamount chain. The prevailing, though not completely settled, {{view is that the}} hotspot has been largely stationary within the planet's mantle for much, if not all of the Cenozoic Era. However, while Hawaiian volcanism is well understood and extensively studied, there remains no definite explanation of the mechanism that causes the hotspot effect.|$|E

5|$|People {{displaced}} by the 2010 earthquake are at {{an increased risk of}} sex trafficking and forced labor. The international protections in place for the internally displaced, primarily the 1998 United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement, do not apply to earthquake survivors who have crossed an international border. There is nothing protecting the externally displaced, which creates significant protection gaps for those most vulnerable to trafficking—girls and young women—who are treated as migration offenders rather than forced migrants in need of protection. No temporary protected status <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>created</b> or granted in the Dominican Republic.|$|E
5|$|Plant recolonization and {{succession}} {{has occurred}} in Glacier Bay {{as a result of}} the retreat of the glacier bay in the last about 300 years. The succession, which occurred in the new wilderness of Glacier Bay was stated to be a raw landscape. A simile given is that “It was like seeing an owl with no feathers”. A vegetative wilderness <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>created,</b> which has resulted in the coastal forest. 333 Vascular plant species of individual taxa have been recorded in the Glacier Bay. Dense thickets of Sitka alder and devil's club abound along the shoreline.|$|E

Collectable statues of the characters have also been created. However, despite references in Purcell's sketchbooks and demand from both fans and journalists alike, plush toys of the characters have not been produced. However, a plush toy of Max <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>created</b> and sold, albeit limited edition, as a collaboration between internet shop Hashtag Collectibles and Steve Purcell.|$|E
