A 380MHz digital trunked TETRA radio communication system from Motorola is used on all lines to carry both voice and data information. For Blue Line Siemens Transportation Systems has supplied the electronic interlocking Sicas, the operation control system Vicos OC 500 and the automation control system LZB 700 M. An integrated system comprising optical <b>fibre</b> <b>cable,</b> on-train radio, CCTV, and a centralised clock and public address system is used for telecommunication during train operations as well as emergencies. For Red and Yellow lines ALSTOM has supplied signalling system and for Green and Violet lines Bombardier Transportation has supplied CITYFLO 350 signalling system.|$|E

25|$|Data {{communications}} {{are provided}} by several companies. Telstra was the first company to provide dial-up Internet access via the Ballarat exchange, however the first network for broadband Internet access available in the city was a hybrid optical fiber cable and coaxial cable built by Neighbourhood Cable in 2001. Since then, Telstra and Optus have entered the Ballarat market, providing Asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL) services for residential Internet access from four main exchangesâ€”Ballarat, Wendouree (Howitt Street), Sebastopol (Skipton Street) and Alfredton (Cuthberts Road). These companies also provide mobile data access Evolved HSPA and since late 2011 3GPP Long Term Evolution (4G). Ballarat's rollout of the National Broadband Network (NBN) is seen as vital for the city's growing IT industry. During Ballarat's first stage NBN rollout in 2012, 17,800 homes will be directly connected to the network via optical <b>fibre</b> <b>cable.</b>|$|E

50|$|Optical {{attached}} cable (OPAC) {{is a type}} of <b>fibre</b> optic <b>cable</b> that {{is installed}} by being attached to a host conductor along overhead power lines. The attachment system varies and can include wrapping, lashing or clipping the <b>fibre</b> optic <b>cable</b> to the host. Installation is typically performed using a specialised piece of equipment that travels along the host conductor from pole to pole or tower to tower, wrapping, clipping or lashing the <b>fibre</b> optic <b>cable</b> in place. Different manufacturers have different systems and the installation equipment, cable designs and hardware are not interchangeable.Although lashed cable systems and clipped cable systems have been investigated as a means of attaching optical <b>fibre</b> <b>cables</b> to overhead power lines, wrapped cables were the first type to be developed and are the only type in common use today.|$|R
