40|$|International audienceObjectives: The {{objective}} {{of our work}} {{was to determine the}} effects of co-interventions used during labor with oxytocin or for labor dystocia. Methods: We searched for reports of the interventions we sought to study published between 1987 and 2015, looking especially for meta-analyses and randomized trials via the Medline database and the Cochrane Library. We limited our research to studies of spontaneous labor in singleton pregnancies at term. Results: In the absence of labor dystocia, active management of labor is not recommended (<b>Grade</b> <b>B).</b> It is recommended that amniotomy should not be performed routinely during the first stage of labor (<b>Grade</b> <b>B).</b> In cases of labor dystocia during the active phase, an amniotomy is recommended before the administration of oxytocin (professional consensus). The encouragement of continuous support during labor is recommended (<b>Grade</b> <b>B).</b> No scientific evidence justifies the recommendation of any of the following methods for the sole purpose of limiting oxytocin use during labor: maternal position during the first or second stages of labor (grade C), immersion in a water during the first stage (<b>grade</b> <b>B),</b> intravenous infusion, oral hydration, or solid food (<b>grade</b> <b>B),</b> antenatal preparation with hypnosis sessions (grade C), use of relaxation techniques (grade C), acupuncture or acupressure (<b>Grade</b> <b>B),</b> or the use of muscle-relaxant agents (professional consensus).

5000|$|Govt. Zirtiri Residential Science College is {{the only}} {{institution}} that offers purely science education in the State of Mizoram. It is <b>graded</b> <b>B</b> by NAAC [...] and has students 608 currently studying in the college. [...] Government Zirtiri Residential Science College {{was born out of}} the rising demand for a purely Science College which the State of Mizoram had so far been bereft of. The ever increasing thirst for scientific knowledge coupled with the pressure put on the Government by the Science Teachers’ Association of Mizoram and Mizoram College Teachers’ Association has led to the conversion of the erstwhile Government Zirtiri Women’s College into Govt. Zirtiri Residential Science College. Realising the needs and aspirations of the people and inspired by the vision of achieving scientific and technological proficiency, the College began functioning in the year 2000. The existing Home Science Department of Zirtiri Women’s College was amalgamated with the Science faculties from other Government Colleges of the State. It became a co-educational institute and has occupied the status of being the only Science College in Mizoram and the only College in the State to offer the study of Home Science. The College has been accredited with a B Grade (CGPA 2.22) by NAAC in the first accreditation cycle in 2009.|$|E

40|$|ObjectiveWe {{sought to}} {{delineate}} {{the effects of}} competitive and reverse flow on the intermediate-term patency of arterial conduits and examined graft arrangements for maximizing antegrade bypass flow. MethodsThe angiograms of 2083 bypass grafts in 570 patients who underwent off-pump total arterial revascularization without aortic manipulation since December 2000 were reviewed. The blood flow in the bypass grafts were graded A (antegrade), B (competitive), C (reverse), or O (occlusion). The mean number of distal anastomoses was 3. 65 ± 0. 94 per patient. ResultsIn the early angiography 91. 3 % (1901 / 2083) of the bypasses were grade A. Thirty (1. 4 %) bypasses were grade O, whereas 2. 9 % (61 / 2083) were grade B, and 4. 4 %(91 / 2083) were grade C. In the multivariate analysis the end-to-side anastomosis (P <. 0001), 4 or more distal anastomoses of the conduit (P =. 01), native coronary stenosis of less than 75 % (P <. 0001), and target branch location of the right coronary artery territory (P <. 0001) and left circumflex artery territory (P =. 02) significantly correlated with grade non-A. The patency rate in the late angiography of the bypasses <b>graded</b> <b>B</b> or C in the early angiography was 7 (28. 0 %) of 25, whereas that of the bypasses graded A was 164 (89. 1 %) of 184 (P <. 0001). The actuarial graft patency rate of the bypasses graded A was 72. 3 % at 3 years and {{was significantly higher than}} that of the bypasses <b>graded</b> <b>B</b> or C (28. 6 % at 3 years after surgical intervention, P <. 0001). ConclusionsThe sufficient antegrade bypass flow had a favorable effect on the graft patency of arterial conduits. The graft arrangement should be adjusted for each patient so as to maximize the antegrade bypass flow and to confirm the advantage of arterial grafts...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to develop contextual based {{teaching}} materials to enhance students self efficacy and mathematics achievement in algebra at a junior high school. The developed product consisted of students textbook, teachers lesson plan and student worksheet which were valid, practical, and effective. This is a research and developement (R&D) study which consisted of 4 steps: (1) preliminary investigation, (2) design, (3) realization/construction and (4) validations, evaluations, test and revsion. The subjects of this research were 32 students of class 7 C with their mathematics teacher at SMPN 2 Mlati, in Yogyakarta. The instruments used were validation sheets, the practicality evaluation sheets and the effectivity instruments. The validation sheets included the validation sheets for the developed products as well as the students self efficacy questionnaire and the achievement test. The praticality instruments which were evaluated by the teachers and the students included the teachers evaluation sheet about the developed product, teachers and students questionnaire about the teaching and learning process of the CTL approach. The effectivity instruments included students self efficacy questionnaire, the short tests and the achievement test conducted during and after the treatment respectively.

40|$|The {{collection}} of wild breeders of the Indian white prawn Fenneropenaeus indicus from two semi-industrial trawlers fishing in Maputo Bay is assessed {{for the period}} between August and November 1993. The daily mean catch (12 - 21 prawns dayˉ¹) increased until October but monthly yields {{were not significantly different}} (P> 0. 05). The monthly mean mortality ranged between 8 % and 20 % and was similar for males and females. More than 70 % of the catch comprised small (<b>grade</b> <b>B</b> 1 : 20 - 39 g) and medium size (<b>grade</b> <b>B</b> 2 : 40 - 59 g) prawns. While males were exclusively of <b>grade</b> <b>B</b> 1 (99 %), the females were predominantly of <b>grades</b> <b>B</b> 2 and B 3 (60 - 80 g). The {{collection of}} larger breeders (<b>grade</b> <b>B</b> 4 : > 80 g) was low and represented only 1 % of total catches and a maximum of 3 % of females. The net profit of breeders collection increased with size (grade) of prawns, and represented a maximum yield of 114 % for <b>grade</b> <b>B</b> 3. The added value of live prawns exceeded 450 % of the cost to the fisherman, but decreased with size of breeders. It is considered that the semi-industrial trawling fishery operating in Maputo Bay has potential for supplying wild breeders of the Indian white prawn for aquaculture. This activity can also contribute to value adding of part of the catch traditionally destined for human consumption...|$|R
