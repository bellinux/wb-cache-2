5|$|Anna Schwartz {{collaborated with}} Friedman to produce one of monetarism's major works, A Monetary History of the United States (1963), which linked money {{supply to the}} {{business}} cycle. The Keynesians of the 1950s and 60s had adopted the view that monetary policy does not impact aggregate output or the business cycle based on evidence that, during the Great Depression, interest rates had been extremely low but output remained depressed. Friedman and Schwartz argued that Keynesians only looked at nominal rates and neglected the role inflation plays in real interest rates, which had been high <b>during</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> the Depression. In real terms, monetary policy had effectively been contractionary, putting downward pressure on output and employment, even though economists looking only at nominal rates thought monetary policy had been stimulative.|$|E

5|$|Charles Atangana (c. 1880 – 1 September 1943), {{also known}} by his birth name, Ntsama, and his German name, Karl, was the {{paramount}} {{chief of the}} Ewondo and Bane ethnic groups <b>during</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> the colonial period in Cameroon. Although from an unremarkable background, Atangana's loyalty and friendship with colonial priests and administrators secured him successively more prominent posts in the colonial government. He proved himself an intelligent and diplomatic administrator and an eager collaborator, and he was eventually named paramount chief of two Beti-Pahuin subgroups, the Ewondo and Bane peoples. His loyalty and acquiescence to the German Empire was unquestioning, and he even accompanied the Germans on their escape from Africa in World War I.|$|E
5|$|Chikka Devaraja (r. 1672–1704), {{the most}} notable of Mysore's early kings, who ruled <b>during</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> this period, managed to not only survive the exigencies but further {{expanded}} territory. He achieved this by forging strategic alliances with the Marathas and the Mughals. The kingdom soon grew to include Salem and Bangalore to the east, Hassan to the west, Chikkamagaluru and Tumkur {{to the north and}} the rest of Coimbatore to the south. Despite this expansion, the kingdom, which now accounted for a fair share of land in the southern Indian heartland, extending from the Western Ghats to the western boundaries of the Coromandel plain, remained landlocked without direct coastal access. Chikka Devaraja's attempts to remedy this brought Mysore into conflict with the Nayaka chiefs of Ikkeri and the kings (Rajas) of Kodagu (modern Coorg); who between them controlled the Kanara coast (coastal areas of modern Karnataka) and the intervening hill region respectively. The conflict brought mixed results with Mysore annexing Periyapatna but suffering a reversal at Palupare.|$|E

McGovern battled the Nixon administration and Southerners in Congress <b>during</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> the next year over an expanded Food Stamp Program; he had to compromise {{on a number of}} points, but legislation signed in 1970 established the principles of free food stamps and a nationwide standard for eligibility.|$|E
