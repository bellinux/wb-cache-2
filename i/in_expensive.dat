5|$|Discussions {{regarding}} {{the building of}} a line through Lier started in 1895, and construction commenced in 1901. The line opened on 12 July 1904 and was initially profitable, in part because of tourist traffic. In 1920, the Drammen Line was converted to standard gauge, resulting <b>in</b> <b>expensive</b> transshipment between the two lines. This and falling traffic caused the line to become unprofitable. The Lier line was closed for ordinary traffic on 23 October 1932. All traffic ceased on 1 January 1937 and the track was demolished shortly afterwards.|$|E
5|$|For a subplot, Chaplin first {{considered}} a character even {{lower on the}} social scale, a black newsboy. Eventually he opted for a drunken millionaire, a character previously used in the 1921 short The Idle Class. The millionaire plot {{was based on an}} old idea Chaplin had for a short in which two millionaires pick up the Little Tramp from the city dump and show him a good time <b>in</b> <b>expensive</b> clubs before dropping him back off at the dump, so when he woke up, the Tramp would not know if it was real or a dream. This was rewritten into a millionaire who is a friend of the Tramp when drunk but does not recognize him when sober.|$|E
5|$|John {{had lost}} most of his ancestral lands in France to King Philip II in 1204 and had {{struggled}} to regain them for many years, raising extensive taxes on the barons to accumulate money {{to fight a war}} which ended <b>in</b> <b>expensive</b> failure in 1214. Following the defeat of his allies at the Battle of Bouvines, John had to sue for peace and pay compensation. John was already personally unpopular with many of the barons, many of whom owed money to the Crown, and little trust existed between the two sides. A triumph would have strengthened his position, but in the face of his defeat, within a few months after his return from France John found that rebel barons in the north and east of England were organising resistance to his rule.|$|E

25|$|The {{painting}} {{is in the}} Northern Renaissance style and was completed most likely around 1630. The Virgin Mary is depicted without the infant Jesus. The artwork soon became known as miraculous and inspired a following. A dedicated chapel was built in 1671 by the Discalced Carmelites. At the same time, possibly borrowing from the Eastern Orthodox tradition, the painting was covered <b>in</b> <b>expensive</b> and elaborate silver and gold clothes leaving only the face and hands visible.|$|E
25|$|With {{previous}} album sessions, {{the band}} had always looked to maximise their labels resources, working with different producers and <b>in</b> <b>expensive</b> studios - but had always ended up {{coming back to}} Sapone. It was decided early on by the band that they would work with Sapone, using his studio. This would also allow the band to remain local to their homes while recording, and also allow them to spend their advance from the label on general living costs, as opposed to production and studio costs.|$|E

The Patsy contains her imitations which she usually did for friends, of silent stars Lillian Gish, Mae Murray and Pola Negri. King Vidor saw Davies as a comedic actress instead of the dramatic actress that Hearst wanted her to be. He noticed she was the life of parties and incorporated that into his films.|$|E

25|$|As an {{alternative}} to the power suit, the safari jacket, Nehru suit and Mao suit remained popular in Australia, South Africa, India, China, and Zaire, where it was known as an Abacost and worn with a leopard print hat resembling the Astrakhan cap. At the same time, young African dandies known as sapeurs rebelled against the post-decolonisation government's suppression of Western fashions by investing <b>in</b> <b>expensive</b> designer suits from Italy and France and listening to the soukous music of Papa Wemba. This continued until the kleptocratic dictator Mobutu's deposition and death in the late 1990s, when the outbreak of a civil war in Zaire resulted in the sapeurs' disappearance until the 2010s.|$|E
25|$|Remarkably, the new {{techniques}} were only tried once, though successfully, at the Battle of Nieuwpoort in 1600, by the States Army. Maurice {{was not in}} favor of looking for open battles, as this could result <b>in</b> <b>expensive</b> losses of valuable mercenary soldiers. He preferred the steady but more secure slog of siege warfare, in which he (and his successor Frederick Henry) developed a great proficiency. The States Army therefore seldom engaged in open battles during the entire course of the Eighty Years' War, but used its field army strategically as a threatening chess piece on a chess board, often to good effect. The main war was fought with garrisons and besieging forces. The army that really employed the new tactics was that of Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden, who used them, with some improvements of his own, to great effect in the 1630s.|$|E
25|$|When Gonzalo {{arrived at}} the main bohío of Quemuenchatocha, he found the Muisca ruler sitting in his throne and {{surrounded}} by his closest companions. All men were dressed <b>in</b> <b>expensive</b> mantles and adorned with golden crowns. On August 20, 1537, the Spanish beat the zaque and the big and strong Muisca ruler was taken captive to Suesca. There he was tortured and the Spanish soldiers hoped he would reveal where he hid his precious properties. The absence of Quemuenchatocha paved the route for his nephew Aquiminzaque to succeed him as ruler of the northern Muisca, a practice common in Muisca traditions. When Quemuenchatocha was finally released from captivity in Suesca, he fled to Ramiriquí, where he died shortly after. The Spanish soldiers found gold, emeralds, silver, mantles and other valuables in Tunja. They {{were not able to}} take all the precious pieces and many were secretly taken away by the Muisca, using folded deer skins. They hid the valuables in nearby hills.|$|E

25|$|In the mid-17th {{century the}} Discalced Carmelites built the Church of Saint Teresa and their monastery near the Gate of Dawn. In 1655, {{the city was}} captured, looted, and {{depopulated}} during the Battle of Vilnius of the Russo-Polish War. It was likely that the city government, short of funds, transferred maintenance of the gate and the paintings to the Carmelites. The painting of Christ {{was moved to the}} Carmelite monastery and later to Vilnius Cathedral (a fresco of Jesus was painted in its original niche in the 19th century; it was uncovered in 1976). In 1671, the monks built a wooden chapel to Our Lady next to the gate tower; it was around the time that the painting was covered <b>in</b> <b>expensive</b> silver clothes. By then, the painting was already an object of public veneration and the chapel dedication ceremony was attended by many prominent figures of the time including Chancellor Krzysztof Zygmunt Pac, Grand Hetman Michał Kazimierz Pac, and senators of the general sejm.|$|E
25|$|Less than 30 pence {{in every}} pound spent on some carbon offset schemes goes {{directly}} to projects {{designed to reduce}} emissions. The figures reported by the BBC and based on UN data reported that typically 28p goes to the set up and maintenance costs of an environmental project. 34p goes to the company that takes on {{the risk that the}} project may fail. The project's investors take 19p, with smaller amounts of money being distributed between organisations involved in brokering and auditing the carbon credits. In that respect carbon Offsets are similar to most consumer products, with only a fraction of sale prices going to the off-shore producers, the rest being shared between investors and distributors who bring it to the markets, who themselves need to pay their employees and service providers such as advertising agencies most of the time located <b>in</b> <b>expensive</b> areas.|$|E
25|$|The {{availability}} of inexpensive {{digital signal processing}} electronics in the late 1970s and 1980s {{led to the development}} of the first digital delay effects. Initially, they were only available <b>in</b> <b>expensive</b> rack-mounted units but eventually as costs came down and the electronics grew smaller, they became available in the form of foot pedals. The first digital delay offered in a pedal was the Boss DD-2 in 1984. Rack-mounted delay units evolved into digital reverb units and on to digital multi-effects units capable of more sophisticated effects than pure delay, such as reverb and Audio timescale-pitch modification effects. Digital delay systems function by sampling the input signal through an analog-to-digital converter, after which the signal is passed through a series of digital signal processors that record it into a storage buffer, and then play back the stored audio based on parameters set by the user. The delayed ("wet") output may be mixed with the unmodified ("dry") signal after, or before, it is sent to a digital-to-analog converter for output.|$|E
