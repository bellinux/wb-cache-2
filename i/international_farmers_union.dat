40|$|The problem, then, {{to which}} this study is {{directed}} has two parts: (1) Has the National <b>Farmers</b> <b>Union</b> accurately reflected the interests of family-type and low-income farmers since 1941 ? (2) Can specific allegations of “leftism” directed at the National <b>Farmers</b> <b>Union</b> be justified? In order {{to determine if the}} purposes of the <b>Farmers</b> <b>Union</b> have changed since 1941, it is necessary to define the purposes prior to that year. Chapter II is devoted to that end and comprises a brief history of the <b>Farmers</b> <b>Union</b> prior to 1941. Because the major portion of this study is devoted to an analysis of the legislative record of the National <b>Farmers</b> <b>Union</b> since 1941, emphasis is placed on legislation advocated or supported by the organization prior to 1941. Chapters III through VI consider the positions taken by the National <b>Farmers</b> <b>Union</b> on various legislative issues—agricultural credit, support prices, medical care facilities, and cooperative taxation. The issues were selected for two reasons:(1) they were important to the American farmer, and (2) they provide a limited but fairly representative coverage of agricultural policy. Chapters II through VI also include an analysis of the positions taken by the Farm Bureau and the Grange on the legislative issues, to ascertain whether the <b>Farmers</b> <b>Union</b> has represented family-type and low-income famers more accurately. Chapter VII constitutes a description of a long-range agricultural program proposed by the National <b>Farmers</b> <b>Union.</b> The purpose of Chapter VII is to clearly show the basic philosophy of the organization. Chapter VIII presents specific allegations of “leftism” directed at the National <b>Farmers</b> <b>Union.</b> It also includes some of the evidence that was used in justifying the allegations. Material presented to refute the allegations constitutes Chapter IX. Conclusions regarding {{the extent to which the}} National <b>Farmers</b> <b>Union</b> has been representative of family-type and low-income farmers and the justification for the allegations are stated in Chapter X.

40|$|Various farm {{organizations}} {{and political parties}} are taking sides on whether the FAIR Act needs to be scraped or just modified. This study analyzes three such proposals: the U. S. House of Representatives proposal (H. R. 2646), the American Farm Bureau proposal, and the National <b>Farmers</b> <b>Union</b> proposal. The continuation of the FAIR Act is also included as an another alternative. The H. R. 2646 and the American Farm Bureau proposals are modifications of the FAIR Act while the National <b>Farmers</b> <b>Union</b> proposal is a totally redesigned bill. The H. R. 2646 and the Farm Bureau proposals are very similar in their results. They provide higher net farm income for the large size farm than the <b>Farmers</b> <b>Union</b> proposal does early in the forecast period, but the <b>Farmers</b> <b>Union</b> proposal provides higher net farm income {{in the last three}} years of the time period. The <b>Farmers</b> <b>Union</b> proposal provides higher net farm income for the medium and small size farm than either the H. R. 2646 or the Farm Bureau proposals because of the targeting feature. The FAIR Act provides less net farm income for all size farms than any other proposal. Farm Bill, Targeting, North Dakota Representative Farms, H.
