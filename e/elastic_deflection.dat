40|$|Initial {{stage of}} {{incompressible}} liquid impact onto a corrugated elastic panel with account for compressible gas trapping between the corrugations is studied. The liquid free surface is flat and {{parallel to the}} panel before impact. The impact velocity is constant in this study. The corrugations are modelled as identical rigid short structures {{on the surface of}} the flat panel. The panel is either of infinite or finite length. There are only two corrugations which are placed symmetrically on the panel. Only a part of the panel between these two corrugations is elastic. The liquid free surface closes the gas cavity between the two corrugations at the initial instant of impact and compresses the gas before the fluid comes in contact with the elastic part of the panel. The <b>elastic</b> <b>deflections</b> of the panel are caused by gas pressure in the cavity. The <b>elastic</b> <b>deflections</b> modify both the pressure in the cavity and the hydrodynamic pressure distribution along the wetted part of the panel. The hydroelastic problem is solved within the Wagner approach. The effect of gas compressibility on the elastic behaviour of the corrugated elastic panel is investigated. It is shown that the pressure in the gas cavity and <b>elastic</b> <b>deflections</b> grow beyond all bounds for the panel of infinite length and are finite if the panel is of finite length.

50|$|Elastohydrodynamic lubrication: Mostly for nonconforming {{surfaces}} {{or higher}} load conditions, the bodies suffer elastic strains at the contact. Such strain creates a load-bearing area, which provides an almost parallel gap for the fluid to flow through. Much as in hydrodynamic lubrication, {{the motion of}} the contacting bodies generates a flow induced pressure, which acts as the bearing force over the contact area. In such high pressure regimes, the viscosity of the fluid may rise considerably. At full film elastohydrodynamic lubrication the generated lubricant film completely separates the surfaces. Contact between raised solid features, or asperities, can occur, leading to a mixed-lubrication or boundary lubrication regime. In addition to Reynolds equation, elastohydrodynamic theory considers the <b>elastic</b> <b>deflection</b> equation, since in this regime elastic deformation of the surfaces contributes significantly to the lubricant film thickness.|$|E

30|$|By {{observing the}} tooth {{movement}} especially in Fig.  2 c, {{we can understand}} that bowing caused by <b>elastic</b> <b>deflection</b> of the archwire was another reason for lingual tipping of the incisors. This tipping occurred under a condition where a moment was applied from the archwire to the incisor, and therefore, {{it was a kind}} of controlled tipping. The tipping angle of the incisor was greater than the maximum rotation angle Δθ in each archwire size. The difference between both angles is due to the <b>elastic</b> <b>deflection</b> of the archwire, which increases by decreasing the archwire size. In Fig.  2, the tipping angle due to the <b>elastic</b> <b>deflection</b> becomes 4.1 ° (=[*] 6.4 – 2.3 °), 6.9 ° (=[*] 16.7 – 9.8 °), and 7.6 ° (=[*] 25.6 – 18.0 °) when decreasing the archwire size. <b>Elastic</b> <b>deflection</b> of the archwire affected individual teeth differently. In the central incisor, an <b>elastic</b> <b>deflection</b> caused lingual tipping, and it was added to that produced by the play. As a result, lingual tipping of the central incisor became remarkable. In the canine, crown distal tipping was caused by an <b>elastic</b> <b>deflection</b> of the archwire. In the molars, the influence of <b>elastic</b> <b>deflection</b> was small. In all kinds of tooth, tipping due to the <b>elastic</b> <b>deflection</b> can be prevented by using an inversely prebent archwire or torqueing (third-order bend) of archwire [13].|$|E

In addition, the amount of the <b>elastic</b> <b>deflection</b> is proportional to the retraction force P [14].

30|$|It {{was found}} that tipping of the {{anterior}} teeth was due to three causes, a play of the archwire-bracket slot, an <b>elastic</b> <b>deflection</b> of the archwire, and a rotation of the entire dentition.

When using such archwires, only tipping due to <b>elastic</b> <b>deflection</b> decreased, but the other types of tipping are left.

A lateral force of 1. 6 mN was necessary to move the slider disconnected from the compliant MEMS device, which is comparable to the forces required to achieve the planned <b>elastic</b> <b>deflections</b> of the device itself.

40|$|Geometrical in {{accuracies}} of {{sheet metal}} parts due to springback {{are one of the}} main sources of lack of dimensional accuracy. Therefore, when designing a process to obtain a piece,it is mandatory to take in to consideration its springback behaviour. This requires making adjustments to tool geometries or any process variable. These modifications, classified as springback compensation,include several strategies that may reduce the shape deviations between the target geometry and the actual result of the forming operation. Those strategies include the modification of tool geometries, the initial blank shape and/or the blank holder force. However, the number and complexity of this parameter set makes this task very material and time consuming. A solution can be obtained using numerical optimization approaches, Response Surface Methods (RSM) or ANOVA[1]. Thus, in this paper,all strategies are applied to the springback compensation of a U- shaped rail, a well-known benchmark that shows large <b>elastic</b> <b>deflections</b> after the tool removing.

40|$|Equations {{of motion}} for a coupled rotor-body system were derived {{for the purpose}} of {{studying}} air and ground resonance characteristics of helicopters that have bearingless main rotors. For the fuselage, only four rigid body degrees of freedom are considered; longitudinal and lateral translations, pitch, and roll. The rotor is assumed to consist of three or more rigid blades. Each blade is joined to the hub by means of a flexible beam segment (flexbeam or strap). Pitch change is accomplished by twisting the flexbeam with the pitch-control system, the characteristics of which are variable. Thus, the analysis is capable of implicitly treating aeroelastic couplings generated by the flexbeam <b>elastic</b> <b>deflections,</b> the pitch-control system, and the angular offsets of the blade and flexbeam. The linearized equations are written in the nonrotating system retaining only the cyclic rotor modes; thus, they comprise a system of homogeneous ordinary differential equations with constant coefficients.
