40|$|Purpose – This paper aims to {{identify}} and assess different configurations to design logistics networks in global sourcing contexts. A framework to support {{the choice of the}} most suitable logistics network is developed. Design/methodology/approach – Starting from an overview of previous research on global sourcing and global logistics network design, followed by a series of interviews with international freight forwarders and logistics providers, five main logistics network configurations are identified and the paper proposes a framework to evaluate their cost-effectiveness, deriving the overall logistics cost by means of simulation. Findings – On the basis of the analysis of different scenarios the paper develops a taxonomy for selecting the most suitable logistics network configuration, with respect to some key logistics factors and purchasing strategies. Research limitations/implications – The analysis has been focused on ocean container shipping, the primary transportation mode for world trade. Practical implications – In a context characterised by the widespread adoption of direct shipment with <b>Full</b> <b>Container</b> <b>Load</b> (<b>FCL)</b> ocean shipping (with implications on inventory levels), the provided taxonomy can represent a useful tool to support companies in choosing the most suitable combination of configurations for setting their global logistics network.

40|$|Human’s {{impact on}} earth through {{global warming is}} more or less an {{accepted}} fact. Ocean freight is estimated to contribute 4 - 5 % of global carbon emissions and manufacturing companies can aid in reducing this amount. Many companies that ship goods through <b>full</b> <b>container</b> <b>loads</b> do not have the capabilities to ensure the containers they are using minimizes their carbon footprint. One of the reasons is the choice of non-ideal container sizes for their shipments. This paper provides a mathematical model to minimize companies’ shipping carbon footprints by selecting the ideal container sizes appropriate for their shipment volumes. Using data from a selected real-world business case in the manufacturing industry, we show that our model can provide a 13. 4 % reduction in carbon footprint.

We first provide a method to compute the policy parameters of an QS policy such that item target service levels can be met, under the assumption that demand can be modeled as a compound renewal process. The approximate formulas are based on renewal theoretic results and are tested in a simulation study, revealing a good performance. Second, we compare the QS policy with a simple allocation policy, where replenishment orders are triggered by the individual inventory positions of the items. At the moment when an individual inventory position drops below its item reorder level a replenishment order is triggered and the total vehicle capacity is allocated among all items such that the expected elapsed time before the next replenishment order is maximized. In an extensive simulation study it is illustrated that the QS policy outperforms this allocation policy, standing for lower inventory levels to obtain the same service level.

40|$|Container Freight Station (CFS) in the {{simplest}} term, is an intermodal consolidation facility that builds up <b>container</b> <b>load</b> for export cargo and deconsolidates <b>full</b> <b>container</b> <b>load</b> for import cargoes. CFS {{is very important in}} a hub city, in a global physical transportation network, because of the high level activities or loading, sorting and reloading. Recently, due to the trends of globalization, customization and outsourcing of non-core activities for manufacturers, supply chain management is rapidly rising. By its vary nature, CFS can be served as a regional distribution center for MNC's inbound cargoes, a merge-in-transit facilitation along the supply chain and a supplier hub for global manufacturers. Despite the high potential of CFS for value adding or cost saving along the supply chain, CFS has received little research on its business nature, challenges and business opportunities as well as pitfalls. Therefore, we select Hong Kong's cargo-consolidation industry, named as "Container Freight Station" in particular to illustrate the issue and to explore potential research for future study. We clearly illustrate the central role of CFS among other transportation parties, and also various important characteristics that govern the past, present and future CFS industrial development. We also illustrate the changes and challenges at this special time period such that Hong Kong's CFS cargoes are being increasingly divided by various competitive ports of in Asia, including those developing in Greater China Region.

40|$|Purpose: Many {{manufacturing}} companies that ship goods through <b>full</b> <b>container</b> <b>loads</b> found themselves under-utilizing the containers and resulting in higher carbon footprint per volume shipment. One {{of the reasons}} is the choice of non-ideal container sizes for their shipments. Consolidation fills up the containers more efficiently that reduces the overall carbon footprint. The objective {{of this paper is to}} support decisions on selection of appropriate combination of container sizes and shipment consolidation for a manufacturing company. We develop two-steps model which first takes the volumes to be shipped as an input and provide the combination of container sizes required; then evaluate possibility of shipment consolidation from multiple ports (of loading) within the same country to the same destination (port of discharge). In both steps, the objective function is to minimize carbon footprint by applying linear/integer programming. Only consolidation within the same country is considered due to practical considerations to avoid the need for cross border clearances. Design/Methodology/Approach: In this paper, we first provide an Integer Programming model to minimize the companies’ shipping carbon footprints by selecting the ideal container sizes appropriate for their shipment volumes. Secondly, we proposed a strategy to minimize the carbon footprint by consolidating the shipments in the same country from multiple domestic locations at a port of loading by road freight, before the international sea shipment. A mixed-Integer Programming model has been developed to determine if one should ship each shipment separately or have shipments consolidated first before being shipped. Findings: Computational results using real-world data will be showcased. Originality/Value: Optimize the container size for shipment for a manufacturing company and consolidating the shipments within the same country. Practical Implications: We verify our model with a real-world business case (and data) in the consumer product manufacturing industry. By applying the proposed approach and models, the company can reduce the carbon footprint by 13. 4 % by using the optimal container size and further reduce the carbon footprint by 12. 1 % from consolidation of shipments as compared to the current practice without optimization...|$|R
40|$|The {{emissions}} {{of greenhouse gases}} (GHG) but the foremost carbon-dioxide (CO 2), is beginning human induced climate change {{have turned out to be}} a global and ominous issue. All participants, society, groups etc ought to be betrothed in the mission of mitigating the anticipated impacts. For any business organisation determined to deal with the issue, measuring its carbon footprint is an indispensable footstep to take. Since 2003, A. P. Moller Maersk group has monitored the level of CO 2 emissions associated from their ship‟s operations for carrying freight cargoes from one port to the other. The scope of this study is to measure CO 2 emissions originating from fuel consumption from their UK landside operations i. e. movement of container from port to inland locations or consignee sites and other facilities and back to port. During the last year the emissions figures from ships have been published in their annual sustainability report and also published in shipping news, from which it is evident that MAERSK group have managed to reduce the group‟s total CO 2 emissions. These are in lines with the projected CO 2 reduction targets, and in a carbon constrained future it will be seen as a competitive advantage for an organisation to continue on this route. Carbon-dioxide emissions from the landside transportation of freight containers have so far been kept outside the monitoring scope. These sources are likely to contribute significantly to the total carbon impact of a leading multinational liner shipping company like MAERSK LINE, and hence they should also be screened, monitored and managed. In this report of carbon-dioxide emissions accounting, MAERSK LINE freight transports are examined. The identification of emission sources, the handling of transport activity data, the application of proper emissions calculation methodologies and organisational aspects. 4 Emissions calculations are carried out for two specific intermodal systems managed by MAERSK LINE; the Road Freight and the Rail Freight Transport System. The road and rail freight transports, operates within the UK for the distribution of import consignment and collecting export loads which are moved in <b>full</b> <b>container</b> <b>loads.</b> It is estimated to contribute with 126, 583 tonnes CO 2 during 2008. Since the system is not optimised to a reasonable degree between rail and road transport systems, the CO 2 impact per tonne-km is relatively low for rail mode of transportation. Over the same period the road freight‟s estimated CO 2 emissions are 100, 707 tonnes. Together these transport activities contributes to about 3 percent of the MAERSK LINE‟s total CO 2 based on the reporting of 2006. The potential for carbon-dioxide (CO 2) reductions is covered by two possible change-oriented case studies. It can be concluded that short-sea transportation seldom is an alternative to road transports. Intermodal transports combining road and rail can, depending on the circumstances, reduce the CO 2 impact considerably compared to only using road transports. Reducing transportation work by optimising a transport activity has been viewed as the best option for CO 2 reductions. Resolution should be put into reducing the need for road freight transports, considering a high emissions level per tonne-km. Monitoring emissions for both the transport mode activities that falls under MAERSK‟s responsibility will reduce the risk of sub optimisation. While introducing system alterations in order to reduce CO 2 emissions will have a range of implications for all stakeholders / actors involved. Further, effects on lead-time, costs and storing capacity are some of the factors that will have to be further analysed and examined. Other constraints to introducing system changes could require of knowledge, resources and available transport options...|$|R

40|$|Logistics plays a {{more and}} more {{important}} role in manufacturing company to sharp competitive in today’s supply chain integration. As the end of logistics in manufacturer, <b>container</b> <b>loading</b> intellectualization has attracted {{more and more}} focuses. Harmonious coordination between planning and execution ground high performance of the <b>container</b> <b>loading.</b> Several challenges exist in business operations. Firstly, <b>container</b> <b>loading</b> planning is time-consuming. Several case-based constraints exist in the optimization defined by different customers and the Customs. Secondly, execution driven by <b>container</b> <b>loading</b> is inefficient. Operators may use unclear or unreadable paper-based guidance during execution which is inconvenient to handle. Besides, due to various situations, shipping documentations are complex. Afterwards Order-picking, a critical part in executions, is a costly activity. Thirdly, coordination during whole <b>container</b> <b>loading</b> process is another challenge. Information sharing between planning and execution is delayed and inaccurate. The whole procedure usually cannot be monitored by managers in a remote office. Problems cannot be addressed without timely provision of data. This research targets to establish a smart <b>container</b> <b>loading</b> platform based on real life practices and constraints. Unlike common warehouse operation, warehouse executions are driven by <b>container</b> <b>loading.</b> To overcome the challenges, an integrated solution is proposed with three main parts. The first one is to establish RFID-enabled real-time smart environment where device-level data is collected timely with bidirectional communications under Wi-Fi occasionally connected situation. Secondly, Service-oriented Architecture (SOA) is applied in rule-based computation and heterogeneous information sources integration. In rule-based computation, constraint is computed and wrapped as rule. It {{is a kind of}} service which is restored in service repository according to its properties. Under different cases, several rules are addressed and invoked in a specified sequence to realize different business logics. And the platform should communicate with heterogeneous sources within short time. Systems wrap application programming interfaces (API) as web services which can be invoked flexibly at any time. Data fetch process is divided into several threads which extract data concurrently. Thirdly, <b>container</b> <b>loading</b> optimal model is provided based on practical constraints. Based on various rules, shipments are clustered as groups before <b>loading.</b> To <b>load</b> <b>containers</b> more equally, heuristic algorithm is provided with reducing container capacity continuously until other constraints are violated or more shipment groups are separated. Four contributions have been made in this study. Firstly, a five-layer system architecture is proposed for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) applications especially in occasionally connected network environment, rule-based computations, and efficient data exchanges. Secondly, several practical constraints of loading planning are addressed and a heuristic algorithm is designed. Shipments can be equally loaded while satisfying most conflicted constraints. Thirdly, a solution for auto-ID enabled warehouse execution is provided. The solution is driven by <b>container</b> <b>loading</b> equipped with real-time information capturing and processing. Fourthly, a guidance can be refereed for real life implementations in SME. The guidance summarizes system customization procedures with reengineered resources. published_or_final_versionIndustrial and Manufacturing Systems EngineeringMasterMaster of Philosoph...|$|R
