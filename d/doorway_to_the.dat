5|$|Early in the 18th century, John Hylton (died 1712), {{the second}} son of Henry Hylton, de jure 16th Baron Hylton, gutted the {{interior}} {{to form a}} three-storeyed block (one room on each floor). He also inserted large, alternating, pedimented sash windows in the Italianate style and added a three-storeyed north wing to the castle (as seen in Bucks' engraving of 1728). A <b>doorway</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> new wing was added and approached by a semi-circular staircase. Above the doorway was a coat of arms, {{believed to be the}} one created to commemorate the marriage between John Hylton and his wife, Dorothy Musgrave. It is now located above the <b>doorway</b> <b>to</b> <b>The</b> Golden Lion Inn at South Hylton, {{on the opposite side of}} the River Wear.|$|E
5|$|Occasionally, Ganapati and {{his brother}} Kartikeya (Kumara, Subramanya) or the saktis, the female counterparts, {{can be found at}} either end of this carving.

50|$|Micklegate Bar {{once had}} a barbican or outer gateway in front of it, which became ruinous and was {{demolished}} in 1826. <b>The</b> two <b>doorways</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> top of the barbican {{can be seen in}} the photo above right.|$|R
50|$|Built {{in about}} 1910, it is a modest, single-story, wood-framed {{construction}} with a gable roof. The front {{slope of the}} roof has a long shed-roof dormer, providing some second-level storage space for the shops below. The building is vernacular in style, with paired recessed <b>doorways</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> stores. The building typifies Barnstable's modestly-scaled commercial district, fitting well with earlier residential structures.|$|R
5|$|The <b>doorway</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Blessed Sacrament Chapel on {{the north}} wall of the nave is topped by carvings of shields {{representing}} three Christian religious centers, Jerusalem, Rome, and Canterbury, and flanked by carvings representing the seven virtues and corresponding seven vices. The other door leaving the Blessed Sacrament Chapel is topped by carvings of shields representing three medieval universities, Oxford, Paris, and Salamanca, and flanked by carvings representing the seven liberal arts (the Trivium and the Quadrivium) and the seven gifts of the Holy Spirit.|$|E
5|$|Ten {{days after}} Kennedy was assassinated, the Associated Press in Dallas {{reported}} that Altgens' first photograph along Elm Street had {{captured the attention}} of people who noticed that one of the men standing in the main <b>doorway</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> book depository appeared to resemble the accused killer Lee Harvey Oswald. Those observers raised the question of whether Oswald could have killed Kennedy, saying he {{would not have been able}} to get to the doorway from the sixth floor of the building. The report quoted depository superintendent Roy Truly, who identified fellow employee Billy Lovelady as the man in the image. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) told the AP they had already investigated the photograph and also identified Lovelady.|$|E
5|$|Sutton Court {{is built}} of squared and coursed {{sandstone}} rubble throughout with freestone and ashlar dressings, copings, slate roofs. The north front comprises a central three-storey fourteenth century pele tower with a taller circular stair turret and two-storey ranges linking {{it to the}} 1558 'Bess of Hardwick Building' {{to the left and}} a four bay 1858–1860 servants' wing of three storeys to the right. Windows to the pele tower and right-hand linking range are 15th century, of two cusped lights with hood moulds, some of which have been renewed, and some relocated from other areas. The <b>doorway</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> tower dates from 1858–60. The windows to the left-hand linking range and the 'Hardwick Building' are four and six lights, with chamfered mullions. The two-storey 'Hardwick' range has diagonal offset buttresses. There are eighteenth-century battlements to the pele tower, with tall octagonal ashlar stacks.|$|E

5|$|Madonna in the Church (or The Virgin in the Church) {{is a small}} {{oil panel}} by the early Netherlandish painter Jan van Eyck. Probably {{executed}} between c. 1438–40, it depicts the Virgin Mary holding the Child Jesus in a Gothic cathedral. Mary is presented as Queen of Heaven wearing a jewel-studded crown, cradling a playful child Christ who gazes at her and grips {{the hem of her}} red dress in a manner that recalls the 13th-century Byzantine tradition of the Eleusa icon (Virgin of Tenderness). Tracery in the arch {{at the rear of the}} nave contains wooden carvings depicting episodes from Mary's life, while a faux bois sculpture in a niche shows her holding the child in a similar pose. Erwin Panofsky sees the painting composed as if the main figures in the panel are intended to be the sculptures come to life. In a <b>doorway</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> right, two angels sing psalms from a hymn book. Like other Byzantine depictions of the Madonna, van Eyck depicts a monumental Mary, unrealistically large compared to her surroundings. The panel contains closely observed beams of light flooding through the cathedral's windows. It illuminates the interior before culminating in two pools on the floor. The light has symbolic significance, alluding simultaneously to Mary's virginal purity and God's ethereal presence.|$|E
25|$|When {{it first}} opened on October 27, 1904, Times Square {{was a local}} station on New York City's first subway, so named by IRT {{president}} August Belmont because it was located directly under the Times Building, headquarters of The New York Times. Three shuttle tracks have served it since 1918; the southbound express track was removed and replaced by a temporary wooden platform {{for access to the}} original northbound express track. The former southbound platform (serving track 1) still has a vestiges of a <b>doorway</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Knickerbocker Hotel, while the northbound platform (serving track 4) retains a former <b>doorway</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Times Building.|$|E
25|$|The Browne doorway, {{originally}} {{located on}} Lower Abbeygate Street but now {{standing at the}} north end of Eyre Square, was the <b>doorway</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> townhouse of the Browne family, one of the fourteen Tribes of Galway.|$|E
50|$|The {{building}} {{was designed by}} John Moffat and was erected <b>to</b> <b>the</b> South of Church Street. The architecture of the pro-cathedral was criticised for being inconsistent - each of <b>the</b> <b>doorways</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> church were of different designs. The church had a single tower which measured 108 feet (33m) in height, {{the upper part of}} which was octagonal in shape and contained a peal of eight bells.|$|R

25|$|The House of the Virgin Mary near Selçuk, Turkey. This is {{a shrine}} frequented by both Christians and Muslims. It {{is known as}} Panaya Kapulu ("the <b>Doorway</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Virgin") in Turkish. Pilgrims drink water from a spring under her house which is {{believed}} to have healing properties. Perhaps the shrine's most distinctive feature is the Mereyemana or wishing wall on which visitors attach their written wishes; because the House of the Virgin Mary is increasingly famous internationally, these messages are composed in English, Italian, Japanese, Chinese, French and Spanish, as well as Turkish. A giant statue of the Virgin Mary – similar in dimensions to that of Christ the Redeemer in Rio de Janeiro – is planned to be erected {{in the vicinity of the}} shrine.|$|E
25|$|The 13th-century north aisle is of {{limestone}} and ironstone work, {{with a string}} course at the eaves, and a plinthdefined by a simple raised band below {{the line of the}} windowsbroken by an blocked chamfered and arched <b>doorway</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west end. Both ends of the aisle are supported by clasping buttresses terminated with gables. An angled buttress of the same style sits between the two identical rectangular north windows, each of three lights with cusped ogee heads. The north aisle pointed west window opening has a chamfered reveal and a hood mould, with an inset window of two simple pointed lights. The pointed east window with hood mould is of four lightstwo central lights, with cusped heads with quatrefoil device above, define a dropped section of the cill below, with a simple raised pointed light each side. All north aisle windows are clear glazed. Above the aisle runs a plain parapet which meets a raised half gable at the east and west ends.|$|E
25|$|Inside, {{the walls}} are single skinned. The {{south-west}} end of the building contains the office and the former goods room, with a small walled cubicle at the south-west (goods room) end. The partition wall between the office and the goods room has been removed. There are two windows (one casement and one with timber louvres) at the south-west end of the space, along with a door to the platform and a casement window to the south-east (Kamerunga Road) elevation. The office space, which retains some timber counters, has a casement window and a modern sliding window on the south-east side, two sash windows on the north-west elevation, and a stable door and ticket window on the north-east side, through to the waiting shed. The waiting shed retains its bench seating, and has a glass-louvre window to the south-east elevation and a timber double folding door to the platform. North-east of the waiting shed is the ladies toilet, with a <b>doorway</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> platform and a small glass louvre window to the south-east. The remains of gardens, with concrete retaining walls to Kamerunga Road, are located south- west of the station building.|$|E

The pantry, accessed from an arched doorway, has a monolithic stone table and a spring from the old cistern. The kitchen, with sink and stone table, is surmounted by a long wooden shelf with chimney, while a long wine cellar is created from a space consisting of six arches.|$|R
25|$|The decorations in {{the hall}} consist of {{protective}} deities. Included are for instance the gods Herymaat and Nebneru ("Lord of Terror"). Herymaat represents the rebirth of Queen Tyti. <b>The</b> <b>doorways</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> side chambers (or annexes) are decorated with guardians that are reminiscent of the Book of the Dead. <b>The</b> entrance <b>to</b> <b>the</b> final chamber is decorated with the Four Sons of Horus.

50|$|The {{church is}} {{constructed}} of rubble limestone with herringbone stonework {{on the north}} and east walls, and stone-slate roofs. There are <b>doorways</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north (now blocked) and south. The south door has a triangular head and is covered by a porch which has a chamfered segmental arch. The south wall of the nave contains two lancet windows and a two-light Perpendicular window with a square head, added in the 15th century. There are no windows in the north wall.|$|R
25|$|Inside the lobby, Sweeny, District Engineer Farley and his firemen, Cain, and {{the other}} police {{officers}} eventually cleared the dress circle stairs {{to work their way}} up to the doors, where there was the connecting <b>doorway</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> family gallery stairway. They tried going up to the family gallery but were stopped by thick smoke. They heard no traffic on the stairway, heard no human sounds. They called up but received no response. Farley ordered one last inspection of the dress circle, but saw no activity. Nor was there any signs of life in the parquet and orchestra, below, now burning fiercely. To Farley the building seemed evacuated, barring, perhaps, a few stragglers. Not wanting to subject himself or others to any further risk, he ordered his men to quit the building. Within minutes, cracks appeared on the exterior theatre walls facing Johnson street, where, within, the heart of the blaze raged. At 11:45pm, less than a half hour after J. W. Thorpe had spied a flame no larger than his hand, the Johnson Street end of the building collapsed and an intense rush of air was drawn in, feeding the flames. Anyone who could speak of events transpiring within the building had already left.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} in {{records are}} those {{represented in the}} paintings of the Egyptian tombs, {{in which they are}} shown as single or double doors, each in a single piece of wood. Doors were once believed to be the literal <b>doorway</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> afterlife, and some doors leading to important places included designs of the afterlife. In Egypt, where the climate is intensely dry, there would be no fear of their warping, but in other countries it would be necessary to frame them, which according to Vitruvius (iv. 6.) was done with stiles (sea/si) and rails (see: Frame and panel): the spaces enclosed being filled with panels (tympana) let into grooves made in the stiles and rails. The stiles were the vertical boards, one of which, tenoned or hinged, is known as the hanging stile, the other as the middle or meeting stile. The horizontal cross pieces are the top rail, bottom rail, and middle or intermediate rails. The most ancient doors were made timber, such as those referred to in the Biblical depiction of King Solomon's temple being in olive wood (I Kings vi. 31-35), which were carved and overlaid with gold. The doors dwelt upon in Homer would appear to have been cased in silver or brass. Besides olive wood, elm, cedar, oak and cypress were used. A 5,000-year-old door has been found by archaeologists in Switzerland.|$|E

2500|$|David Stronach has {{suggested}} that there were originally four such figures, set against <b>doorways</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Palace of Cyrus in Pasargadae. That this bas-relief has such an eclectic styling with elements of Egyptian, Elamite, and Assyrian, reflects [...] "..'the oecumenical attitude of the Achaemenian kings, who {{from the time of}} Cyrus, onward adopted a liberal policy of tolerance and conciliation toward the various religions embraced within their empire'..." [...] It would therefore depict the eclectic nature of Achaemenid life from policies of <b>the</b> kings <b>to</b> their choice of architecture.|$|R
