5|$|From 1749 to the 1760s, Fort Chambray {{was built}} on the island of Gozo. It was {{intended}} to be a new fortified city like Valletta, and eventually to replace the Cittadella as the island's capital. This was unsuccessful, and eventually only the fort was built. It saw some action during the French occupation of 1798, but its importance eventually diminished. It was converted <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>hospital</b> in the 19th century. In the 1990s, the interior of the fort began to be redeveloped, but the outer bastions and some barracks remain intact.|$|E

Simpson had been in constant contact with Helen, who was now working in Stuttgart, Germany, meeting with her between races.

5|$|Following {{financial}} difficulties during the First World War, the mining operations were bought by Store Norske, which was incorporated in Oslo on 30 November 1916.

The same year, the first truck was delivered for use in the mining operations.|$|E

Back in the present, Mulder awakens {{in a hotel room}} in Providence, Rhode Island, covered in blood. Mulder calls Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), who arrives, finding him in shock. Mulder has a {{pounding}} headache and has no memory of what he has done in the past two days. Scully finds that two bullets have been fired from Mulder's gun and that he has keys belonging to a David and Amy Cassandra. Scully wants Mulder to check <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>hospital,</b> but he wants to find out if he was involved in a crime before doing so.

The agents enter the home, where they find the Cassandras dead from gunshot wounds.|$|E
5|$|In January 1943, Centaur {{was handed}} over to the Australian {{military}} for conversion <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>hospital</b> ship, as the ship's small size made her suitable for operating in Maritime Southeast Asia. The refit (including installation of medical facilities and repainting with Red Cross markings) was completed in March, and the ship undertook a trial voyage: transporting wounded from Townsville to Brisbane, then from Port Moresby to Brisbane. After replenishing in Sydney, Centaur embarked the 2/12th Field Ambulance for transport to New Guinea, and sailed on 12 May. Before dawn on 14 May 1943, during her second voyage, Centaur was torpedoed and sunk by a Japanese submarine off North Stradbroke Island, Queensland. The majority of the 332 aboard died in the attack; the 64 survivors were discovered 36 hours later. The incident resulted in public outrage as attacking a hospital ship is considered a war crime under the tenth 1907 Hague Convention. Protests were made by the Australian and British governments to Japan and efforts were made to discover the people responsible so they could be tried at a war crimes tribunal. In the 1970s the probable identity of the attacking submarine, I-177, became public.|$|E
