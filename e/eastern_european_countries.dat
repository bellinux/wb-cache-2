5|$|The {{first of}} the International Mathematical Olympiads (IMOs) was held in Romania in 1959. The oldest of the International Science Olympiads, the IMO has since been held annually, except in 1980. That year the {{competition}} initially planned to hold in Mongolia was canceled due to soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Because the competition was initially founded for <b>Eastern</b> <b>European</b> <b>countries</b> participating in the Warsaw Pact, {{under the influence of}} the Eastern Bloc, the earlier IMOs were hosted only in <b>Eastern</b> <b>European</b> <b>countries,</b> gradually spreading to other nations. Sources differ about the cities hosting some of the early IMOs and the exact dates when they took place.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, the {{collapse}} of the USSR in Eastern Europe gave many new countries the opportunity to compete. Three countries—Croatia, Slovenia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, all of them former Yugoslav republics, won through from a pre-qualifier to compete. After the 1993 event, a relegation system was introduced, allowing even more <b>Eastern</b> <b>European</b> <b>countries</b> to compete: seven more made their debut in 1994.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{these reports}} of toxicity, L.torminosus {{mushrooms}} are prepared in Finland, Russia, and other northern and <b>eastern</b> <b>European</b> <b>countries</b> by parboiling, soaking in brine for several days, or pickling, after {{which it is}} valued for its peppery taste. In Norway, it is roasted and added to coffee. Mushrooms are harvested for commercial sale in Finland. The nutrient composition of Finnish specimens has been analyzed and found to contain the following components (as a percentage of dry weight): protein, 17.2%; phosphorus, 0.46%; calcium, 0.12%; magnesium, 0.088%; potassium, 2.97%; sodium 0.011%.|$|E

5|$|Domestic {{politics}} in <b>Eastern</b> <b>European</b> <b>countries</b> continued {{to push for}} more enlargement, and political parties reluctant to move on NATO membership, such as the Bulgarian Socialist Party and Slovak HZDS, were voted out of office. Hungary's interest in joining was confirmed by a November 1997 referendum that returned 85.3 percent in favor of membership. Russia's actions in the First Chechen War were also a motivating factor for several countries that had memories of similar Soviet offensives.|$|E
5|$|In {{countries}} of the former Soviet Union and other <b>eastern</b> <b>European</b> <b>countries,</b> a team {{has in the past}} been chosen several years beforehand, and they are given special training specifically for the event. However, such methods have been discontinued in some countries. In Ukraine, for instance, selection tests consist of four olympiads comparable to the IMO by difficulty and schedule. While identifying the winners, only the results of the current selection olympiads are considered.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s and 1970s, theories, which {{contained}} ideas about reforming society and struggling for truth, and religious convictions were not referred to delusional paranoid disorders in practically all foreign classifications, but Soviet psychiatry, proceeding from ideological conceptions, referred {{critique of the}} political system and proposals to reform this system to the delusional construct. Diagnostic approaches of conception of sluggish schizophrenia and paranoiac states with delusion of reformism were used only in the Soviet Union and several <b>Eastern</b> <b>European</b> <b>countries.</b>|$|E

5|$|The first IMO {{was held}} in Romania in 1959. Since then it has been held every year except in 1980. That year, it was {{cancelled}} due to internal strife in Mongolia. It was initially founded for eastern European member countries of the Warsaw Pact, under the Soviet bloc of influence, but later other countries participated as well. Because of this eastern origin, the IMOs were first hosted only in <b>eastern</b> <b>European</b> <b>countries,</b> and gradually spread to other nations.|$|E
5|$|The mushroom's {{common names}} {{refer to the}} {{gastrointestinal}} distress they cause when consumed raw. The flesh is extremely peppery, but this offensive taste, along with its toxicity, can be removed by parboiling or pickling. Although {{it used to be}} widely eaten in Russia and <b>eastern</b> <b>European</b> <b>countries,</b> it is generally not recommended for consumption. There are many similar Russula species that have a red cap with white stem and gills, some of which can be reliably distinguished from R.emetica only by microscopic characteristics.|$|E

While not keeping official contacts, it was in addition very supportive of left-wing nationalist parties such as the Scottish National Party, Irish Sinn Féin and Basque Herri Batasuna. Some of the parties it established contacts with most recently was the Freedom Party of Austria and the Italian Lega Nord, which {{after a period of}} distrust, maintained contacts since 2002.|$|E
5|$|The {{perception}} {{of communism in}} the US was shaped by the Cold War, which began after World WarII when the Soviet Union failed to uphold the commitments it made at the Yalta Conference. Instead of holding elections for new governments, as agreed at Yalta, the Soviet Union occupied several <b>Eastern</b> <b>European</b> <b>countries,</b> leading to a strained relationship with the US. Subsequent international events served to increase the apparent danger that communism posed to Americans: the Stalinist threats in the Greek Civil War (1946–1949); the Czechoslovak coup d'état of 1948; and the 1948 blockade of Berlin.|$|E
5|$|After {{the fall}} of the Iron Curtain and the {{economic}} and political barriers that followed, central and <b>eastern</b> <b>European</b> <b>countries</b> with local mushroom harvesting traditions, such as Albania, Bulgaria, Macedonia, Romania, Serbia and Slovenia, developed into exporters of porcini, concentrating primarily on the Italian market. Exported porcini and other wild fungi are also destined for France, Germany and other western European markets, where demand for them exists, but collection on a commercial scale does not. Picking B.edulis has become an annual seasonal income earner and pastime in countries like Bulgaria, especially for many Roma communities and the unemployed. A lack of control has led to heavy exploitation of the mushroom resource.|$|E

5|$|In August 1939, the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany {{signed the}} Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, in which <b>Eastern</b> <b>European</b> <b>countries</b> {{were divided into}} spheres of interest; Finland belonged to the Soviet sphere of interest. In October 1939, Stalin gained control of the Baltic states and turned his sights on Finland, {{confident}} that control could be gained without great effort. The Soviet Union demanded territories on the Karelian Isthmus, the islands of the Gulf of Finland and a military base near the Finnish capital Helsinki, similar to the demands presented in the previous years. The Finns again refused, and the Red Army attacked on 30 November 1939. Simultaneously, Stalin set up a puppet government for the Finnish Democratic Republic, headed by the Finnish communist Otto Wille Kuusinen.|$|E

The series also airs on Disney-affiliated channels {{around the world in}} countries such as the United Kingdom, Australia, India, South Africa, and several <b>Eastern</b> <b>European</b> <b>countries.</b> On May 2, 2016, the series began airing on Disney's Freeform network as part of the late-night That's So Throwback block. In addition to maintaining consistently high ratings throughout its four-season run, Kim Possible was the longest-running Disney Channel Original Series until it was finally surpassed by Phineas and Ferb in 2013.|$|E
5|$|The ZX81 {{was also}} sold {{for a while}} in {{duty-free}} shops at UK airports. However, this fell foul of government export restrictions aimed at preventing the Soviet bloc countries from obtaining Western high technology goods. It was not uncommon for visitors from the Soviet Union and other <b>eastern</b> <b>European</b> <b>countries</b> to pick up gadgets in Western countries with the aim of transferring their technology to their own states' industries. In 1983 the government ordered that the ZX81s were to be withdrawn from sale at airports. There was no such restriction on sales to communist China and in November 1983 Sinclair Research announced that it had signed an agreement to export ZX81 kits to a factory in Guangzhou, where they would be assembled for the Chinese market.|$|E

Even the elite Waffen-SS divisions were often deficient in manpower.|$|E

5|$|In {{the period}} from the 1960-s to 1986, the abuse of {{psychiatry}} for political purposes {{was reported to have}} been systematic in the Soviet Union and episodic in other <b>Eastern</b> <b>European</b> <b>countries</b> such as Romania, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia. The practice of incarceration of political dissidents in mental hospitals in Eastern Europe and the former USSR damaged the credibility of psychiatric practice in these states and entailed strong condemnation from the international community. Psychiatrists have been involved in human rights abuses in states across the world when the definitions of mental disease were expanded to include political disobedience. As scholars have long argued, governmental and medical institutions have at times classified threats to authority during periods of political disturbance and instability as a form of mental disease. In many countries political prisoners are still sometimes confined and abused in mental institutions.|$|E
