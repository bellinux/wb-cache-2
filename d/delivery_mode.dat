25|$|The {{technique}} of selecting only one embryo {{to transfer to}} the woman is called elective-single embryo transfer (e-SET) or, when embryos are at the blastocyst stage, {{it can also be}} called elective single blastocyst transfer (eSBT). It significantly lowers the risk of multiple pregnancies, compared with e.g. Double Embryo Transfer (DET) or double blastocyst transfer (2BT), with a twinning rate of approximately 3.5% in sET compared with approximately 38% in DET, or 2% in eSBT compared with approximately 25% in 2BT. At the same time, pregnancy rates is not significantly less with eSBT than with 2BT. That is, the cumulative live birth rate associated with single fresh embryo transfer followed by a single frozen and thawed embryo transfer is comparable with that after one cycle of double fresh embryo transfer. Furthermore, SET has better outcomes in terms of mean gestational age at <b>delivery,</b> <b>mode</b> of delivery, birthweight, and risk of neonatal intensive care unit necessity than DET. e-SET of embryos at the cleavage stage reduces the likelihood of live birth by 38% and multiple birth by 94%. Evidence from randomized, controlled trials suggests that increasing the number of e-SET attempts (fresh and/or frozen) results in a cumulative live birth rate similar to that of DET.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{strategic}} {{design and}} operation of outbound logistics network in an automotive manufacturing supply chain is directly related with the competitive strategy adopted by the firm. We discuss here an outbound logistics network model with four echelons and flexible <b>delivery</b> <b>modes</b> by incorporating cross-dock facility in the network. The paper aims to achieve a minimum total logistics cost for flexible <b>delivery</b> <b>modes</b> adopted in the network. The mathematical model is formulated as a mixed integer programming model and solved by using a hybrid algorithm named co-evolutionary immune-particle swarm optimization with penetrated hyper-mutation (COIPSO-PHM). The proposed model is combinatorial in nature owing to varying problem instances. The proposed solution methodology is tested on a sample data set mimicking the real life situation {{and the results are}} found to be satisfactory...|$|R

We propose a model on how to optimally operate multiple <b>delivery</b> <b>modes.</b> We consider a serial supply chain and an expediting option from intermediate installations to the downstream of the chain. The goods move stochastically among the installations and the system faces a stochastic demand.

Expediting allows the system to be leaner due to the reduced regular order amount.

50|$|When {{courtship}} occurs, we {{see that}} adult male plethodontid salamanders transfer protein pheromones that augment female receptivity. The majority of plethodontid species apply pheromones transdermally to the female's dorsal skin. These pheromones will have diffused through the skin and enter into circulation, a unique type of pheromone delivery in vertebrates. In contrast, a behavioral and physiological transition occurred in the Plethodontinae, resulting in one clade of species (Plethodon glutinosus group) that uses a different pheromone <b>delivery</b> <b>mode.</b> We see that males within this clade apply pheromones directly to the nares of a female, and the pheromones subsequently are detected by the vomeronasal organ. Than they staged courtship encounters and recorded the behavior of females given either pheromones or control solutions on the dorsal skin for Female receptivity. They found that female red legged salamanders are not stimulated by pheromones delivered dermally and alludes that this condition may characterize {{all the members of}} the P. glutinosus group, which use olfactory pheromone delivery.|$|E
