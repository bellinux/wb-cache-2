40|$|Synopsis: The {{punching}} shear capacity of concrete slabs reinforced with three-dimensional fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) double-layer reinforcement cages composed of glass fiber-reinforced pultruded grating elements {{has been investigated}} using full-scale experimental tests {{and a number of}} different analytical models. Test specimens were full-scale prototype bridge deck slabs with varying end restraint and support conditions, differing dimensions, and two different FRP bar fiber lay-ups. The tests results were compared with the {{punching shear}} models in ACI 318, ACI 440, Eurocode 2, BS 8110, CEB-FIB MC 90, JSCE, and a number of models proposed in the literature specifically for FRP reinforced slabs. Based on this investigation a new empirical model has been developed to predict the punching shear capacity of double layer grids having either restrained or simply supported edges and including an overlapping splice. The model is shown to <b>give</b> <b>reasonably</b> <b>good</b> <b>predictions</b> for both simply supported and restrained slabs...|$|R

40|$|A biomass {{combustion}} {{model with}} a thermally thick approach is presented and applied to the simulation of a commercial biomass domestic boiler. A subgrid scale model is used to divide the particles into several grid points, each representing one of the different combustion stages. These grid points determine the variables of the solid phase located in the packed bed calculated as a porous zone with a volume-averaged approach. The combustion model is coupled with a fuel-feeding model based on Lagrangian trajectories of particles. Those are transformed into solid phase variables {{as soon as they}} reach the packed bed, allowing the numerical model to simulate the transient behavior of such a system. This methodology is here applied to a 27 -kW boiler operating in stable conditions with two feeding systems: one in which the particle feeding rate is kept constant in time and another in which the feeding rate varies randomly through time. The behavior of such a boiler is better understood thanks to the completeness of the model here presented, whose results are also compared to experimental measurements. The CFD model <b>gives</b> <b>reasonably</b> <b>good</b> <b>predictions</b> of the heat transferred, the flue gas temperature, the excess air coefficient and CO 2 emissions, as well as the fluctuations of the boiler when the feeding rate is not constant.

40|$|Strain induced {{precipitation}} of microalloy elements during hot deformation of steels {{has been an}} area of Interest for several decades. Several researchers have produced models for strain {{induced precipitation}} phenomena that <b>gave</b> <b>reasonably</b> <b>good</b> <b>predictions</b> of precipitate evolution during hot deformation. These models were however, applicable only for single pass deformation. The present work aims {{to develop a new}} model that could be extended to prediction of precipitate evolution during multi-pass hot deformation during rolling. In this work, a new approach has been adopted in modelling strain induced precipitation of niobium carbonitrides during hot deformation. A dislocation geometry is proposed for a typical microband, which is considered as a key factor In the model. This microband geometry enables one to obtain the local solute concentration gradients in the regions between the microbands. Diffusion of solute atoms towards the microbands is considered to govern the growth rate of the precipitates on the dislocation nodes in the microbands; i. e., the solute atoms reaching the microbands are immediately consumed in either nucleating a new precipitate or growing an existing precipitate. Depending on the considerations of how precipitates nucleate on the microbands, different models have been proposed and their results analysed. Extending this model to a multipass model depends on the location of the next generation microbands after a second/subsequent deformation. The local solute concentration, already obtained after the first pass, will govern the precipitation potential of the nodes on the second generation microband. Plane strain compression tests were conducted on Fe- 30 wt. %Ni-Nb alloys at different temperatures and deformation conditions. The test samples were subjected to thin foil transmission electron microscopy to obtain the particle size distribution of the niobium carbonitride particles. The experimental results were then correlated with the model results and found to be in <b>reasonably</b> <b>good</b> agreement. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Many {{sports fans}} are {{interested}} in predicting the results of sports matches. But predicting {{the result of a}} match is difficult because there are many factors to be considered. Bayesian inference and rule-based reasoning are widely used scientific techniques to predict future information including sports results, stock prices, etc. In this paper we propose a novel framework for sports prediction using these techniques together with an in-game time-series approach. Our framework is novel and unique in three ways. Firstly, the framework consists of two major components: a rule-based reasoner and a Bayesian network component. This is a compound one in the sense that two different methods cooperate in predicting the results of sports matches. The concept of combining two different techniques into one framework is motivated by the fact that most sports results are highly stochastic, but at the same time, the strategies of a team (or a player) can be determined by certain crisp logic rules. Furthermore, because of the rule-based component, our framework can <b>give</b> <b>reasonably</b> <b>good</b> <b>predictions</b> even when statistical data are scanty, so {{it can be used to}} predict the result of a match between two teams (or players) which have had few or no previous encounters; while most machine learning techniques may not be used because they can suffer from insufficient data. Secondly, our framework considers many factors like current scores, morale, fatigue, skills, etc. when it predicts the results of sports matches; while most previous works considered only one factor, usually score, or few factors. Thirdly, contrary to most previous works on sports prediction we use a knowledge-based in-game time-series approach to predict sports matches. This approach enables our framework to reflect the tides/flows of a sports matc...|$|R
40|$|The present {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the two-dimensional collapse of piles of granular materials, a problem analogous to the classical dam break problem in hydraulics. This study is intended to aid in the development of constitutive equations and modeling procedures that can be applied to predict various flows involving high concentration liquid-particle mixtures. We consider the granular collapse as a test problem and attempt to validate our modeling by comparing our predictions with previously published granular collapse experiments. The time-dependent evolution of the collapsing granular piles is calculated by making use of COMSOL, a commercial finite element code that is designed to handle a wide variety of Multiphysics problems. We begin by considering the collapse of a rectangular block of dry granular material and calculate the temporal evolution of the free surface by making use of the Level Set method. Good agreement is found between these predictions and the laboratory experiments of Balmforth and Kerswell (2005). The collapse of granular material submerged in a water is then investigated using a Mixture Model approach. The experiments of Rondon et al. (2011) revealed drastically different collapse periods depending upon whether the initial pile was in a loose or a dense, compacted state. The simple Mixture Model approach <b>gave</b> <b>reasonably</b> <b>good</b> <b>predictions</b> of the Rondon et al. (2011) experiments for the case of initially loose piles that collapsed in about a second, but it was unsuccessful in simulating the collapse of the initially dense piles that were observed by Rondon et al. (2011) to take around 30 - 40 s. Some simple empirical modifications to the material constitutive behavior were able to roughly predict such long collapse times, but a more comprehensive and detailed investigation of the phenomenon is warranted. 9 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Nowadays {{there is a}} tendency that the traditional prescription-based design of concrete structures is moving towards the performance-based design, in which models are needed for assessment of durability of concrete structures exposed in aggressive environments, such as chloride environments. In order to apply the models in the durability design and redesign of concrete structures it is necessary to validate the models against long-term field data for their applicability with respect to exposure climate. In this study, three models including the simple ERFC-model, the DuraCrete model and the ClinConc model for prediction of chloride ingress in concrete were selected for validation using the field data collected from both the field exposure sites after over 10 years exposure and the real concrete structures after 30 years in service.

40|$|A summary and {{analysis}} of the results obtained from work-packages 1 - 6 of the ASCHLIM project is presented in this document, with the aim of defining the performances and shortcomings of CFD turbulence models currently adopted for the simulation of Heavy Liquid Metals flows in nuclear applications. Two classes of problems are analysed, one related to liquid metals physical characteristics (low Prandtl number) and one related to the flow morphology in typical ADS applications. Concerning the first class, some drawbacks were found in the use of wall-functions for HLM flows. In fact, thermal wall-functions currently implemented in commercial CFD codes are in general unsuitable for HLM flows, unless the first grid point lays in the thermal sublayer y+ < 70 ÷ 100. It was also proved that the Reynolds analogy is not applicable for very low Peclet number flows (100). However, correct results were obtained for higher Pe (1000), even using a constant value for the turbulent Prandtl number (0. 9). Due to the lack of experimental measurements of turbulence quantities, {{it was not possible to}} draw strong conclusions concerning the second class of problems. However, results confirmed the capability of two-equation models to <b>give</b> a <b>reasonably</b> <b>good</b> <b>prediction</b> of the main flow characteristics in complex flow morphology typical of spallation-targets applications.

40|$|A {{series of}} {{centrifuge}} model tests {{was conducted to}} investigate the behavior of pile groups of various sizes and configurations behind a retaining wall in very soft clay. With a 1. 2 -m excavation {{in front of the}} wall, which may simulate the initial stage of an excavation prior to strutting, the test results reveal that the induced bending moment on an individual pile in a free-head pile group is always smaller than that on a corresponding single pile located at the same distance behind the wall. This is attributed to the shadowing and reinforcing effects of other piles within the group. The degree of shadowing experienced by a pile depends on its relative position in the pile group. With a capped-head pile group, the individual piles are forced to interact in unison though subjected to different magnitudes of soil movement. Thus, despite being subjected to a larger soil movement, the induced bending moment on the front piles is moderated by the rear piles through the pile cap. A finite element program developed at the National University of Singapore is employed to back-analyze the centrifuge test data. The program <b>gives</b> a <b>reasonably</b> <b>good</b> <b>prediction</b> of the induced pile bending moments provided an appropriate modification factor is applied for the free-field soil movement and the amount of restraint provided by the pile cap is properly accounted for.

40|$|The {{shear modulus}} at very small strains (less than 0. 001 %) is an {{important}} parameter {{in the design of}} geotechnical structures subjected to static and cyclic loadings. Although numerous soil models are available for predicting shear modulus of saturated and dry soils, only a few ones can predict shear stiffness at very small strains of unsaturated soils correctly. In this study, a few unsaturated soil models are evaluated critically and compared with a newly developed model. This newly proposed model is verified by using measured shear modulus at very small strains for three different low plasticity fine grained soils available in the literature. It is found that this new model can predict shear modulus at very small strain resulting from an increase and a decrease in mean net stress at constant matric suction for low plasticity fine grained soils. Moreover, this model is able to <b>give</b> a <b>reasonably</b> <b>good</b> <b>prediction</b> on shear stiffness at very small strain during wetting of a collapsible unsaturated soil. In addition, the newly proposed model is illustrated to capture a consistent trend with experimental data of shear stiffness at very small strain for non-collapsible soils obtained during drying-wetting cycles. This evaluation revealed that the newly proposed model has better predictive capabilities than some earlier formulations of the same simplicity. In addition, the proposed model with fewer parameters has similar predictive capability as compared with a more complex model. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Comparison {{of methods}} to predict equilibrated Kt/V in the HEMO Pilot Study. The ongoing HEMO Study, a National Institutes of Health (NIH) {{sponsored}} multicenter trial {{to test the}} effects of dialysis dosage and membrane flux on morbidity and mortality, was preceded by a Pilot Study (called the MMHD Pilot Study) designed to test the reliability of methods for quantifying hemodialysis. Dialysis dose was defined by the fractional urea clearance per dialysis determined by the predialysis BUN and the equilibrated postdialysis BUN after urea rebound is completed (eKt/V). In the Pilot Study the blood side standard for eKt/V was calculated from the predialysis, postdialysis, and 30 -minute postdialysis BUN. Four techniques of approximating eKt/V that eliminated the requirement for the 30 -minute postdialysis sample were also evaluated. The first adjusted the single compartment Kt/V using a linear equation with slope based on the relative rate of solute removal (K/V) to predict eKt/V (rate method). The second and third techniques used equations or mathematical curve fitting algorithms to fit data that included one or more samples drawn during dialysis (intradialysis methods). The fourth technique (dialysate-side) predicted eKt/V from {{an analysis of the}} time-dependent profile of dialysate urea nitrogen concentrations (BioStat method; Baxter Healthcare, Inc., Round Lake, IL, USA). The Pilot Study demonstrated the feasibility of conventional and high dose targets of about 1. 0 and 1. 4 for eKt/V. Based on the blood side standard method, the mean ± SD eKt/V for patients randomized to these targets was 1. 14 ± 0. 11 and 1. 52 ± 0. 15 (N = 19 and 16 patients, respectively). Single-pool Kt/Vs were about 0. 2 Kt/V units higher. Results were similar when eKt/V was based on dialysate side measurements: 1. 10 ± 0. 11 and 1. 50 ± 0. 11. The approximations of eKt/V by the three blood side methods that eliminated the delayed 30 -minute post-dialysis sample correlated well with eKt/V from the standard blood side method: r = 0. 78 and 0. 76 for the single-sample (Smye) and multiple-sample intradialysis methods (N = 295 and 229 sessions, respectively) and 0. 85 for the rate method (N = 295). The median absolute difference between eKt/V computed using the standard blood side method and eKt/V from the four other methods ranged from 0. 064 to 0. 097, with the smallest difference (and hence best accuracy) for the rate method. The results suggest that, in a dialysis patient population selected for ability to achieve an equilibrated Kt/V of about 1. 45 in less than a 4. 5 hour period, use of the pre and postdialysis samples and a kinetically derived rate equation <b>gives</b> <b>reasonably</b> <b>good</b> <b>prediction</b> of equilibrated Kt/V. Addition of one or more intradialytic samples does not appear to increase accuracy of predicting the equilibrated Kt/V in the majority of patients. A method based on dialysate urea analysis and curve-fitting yields results for equilibrated Kt/V that are similar to those obtained using exclusively blood-based techniques of kinetic modeling...|$|R
40|$|Abstract We have {{initially}} {{developed a}} time-independent forecast for southern California by smoothing {{the locations of}} magnitude 2 and larger earthquakes. We show that using small m � 2 earthquakes <b>gives</b> a <b>reasonably</b> <b>good</b> <b>prediction</b> of m � 5 earthquakes. Our forecast outperforms other time-independent models (Kagan and Jackson, 1994; Frankel et al., 1997), mostly because it has higher spatial resolution. We have then developed a method to estimate daily earthquake probabilities in southern California by using the Epidemic Type Earthquake Sequence model (Kagan and Knopoff, 1987; Ogata, 1988; Kagan and Jackson, 2000). The forecasted seismicity rate {{is the sum of}} a constant background seismicity, proportional to our timeindependent model, and of the aftershocks of all past earthquakes. Each earthquake triggers aftershocks with a rate that increases exponentially with its magnitude and decreases with time following Omori’s law. We use an isotropic kernel to model the spatial distribution of aftershocks for small (m � 5. 5) mainshocks. For larger events, we smooth the density of early aftershocks to model the density of future aftershocks. The model also assumes that all earthquake magnitudes follow the Gutenberg-Richter law with a uniform b-value. We use a maximum likelihood method to estimate the model parameters and test the short-term and time-independent forecasts. A retrospective test using a daily update of the forecasts between 1 January 1985 and 10 March 2004 shows that the short-term model increases the average probability of an earthquake occurrence by a factor 11. 5 compared with the time-independent forecast...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Laboratory experiments concerning stage-discharge, flow resistance, bedforms, sediment transport and flow structures {{have been carried out}} in a meandering channel with simulated non-vegetated and vegetated floodplains for overbank flow. The effect of placing solid blocks in different arrangements as a model of rigid, unsubmerged floodplain vegetation on a floodplain adjacent to a meandering channel is considered. The aim was to investigate how density and arrangements of floodplain vegetation influence stage-discharge, flow resistance, sediment transport and flow behaviours. Stage-discharge curves, Manning's n and drag force FD are determined over 165 test runs. The results from the laboratory model tests show that the placing of solid blocks along some part of the bend sections has a significant effect on stage-discharge characteristics. The change in stage-discharge by the blocks is compared using different arrangements, including the non-vegetated floodplains case. The experimental results show that the presence of energy losses due to momentum exchange between the main channel and the floodplain as well as the different densities of the blocks on a floodplain induce additional flow resistance to the main channel flow, particularly for shallow overbank flows. In general, the results show that the density and arrangement of blocks on the floodplains are very important for stage-discharge determination and, in some cases, for sediment transport rates, especially for a mobile main channel. Also, the correction parameter, a is introduced {{in order to understand the}} effects of blocks and bedforms on the force balance equation. By applied the correction factor c; a stagedischarge rating curve can be estimated when the avalue is calibrated well. Telemac 2 D and 3 D were applied to predict mean velocity, secondary flow and turbulent kinetic energy. Telemac computations for non-vegetated and vegetated floodplain cases in a meandering channel generally <b>give</b> <b>reasonably</b> <b>good</b> <b>predictions</b> when compared with the measured data for both velocity and boundary shear stress in the main channel. Detailed analyses of the. predicted flow variables were therefore carried out in order to understand mean flow mechanisms and secondary flow structures in compound meandering channels. The non-vegetated and two different cases of vegetated floodplain for different relative depths were considered. For the arrangement on a non-vegetated floodplain shows how the shearing of the main channel flow as the floodplain flow plunges into and over the main channel influences the mean and turbulent flow structures, particularly in the cross-over region. While applying vegetated floodplain along a cross-over section confirmed that the minimum/reduction shearing of the main channel flow by the floodplain flow plunging into and over the main channel is observed from the cross-sectional distributions of the streamwise velocity (U), lateral velocity (V), and secondary flow vectors. In addition to that, the vegetated floödplain along the apex bend region shows a small velocity gradient within the bend apex region. However, strong secondary flow in the cross-over section suggested that the flow interaction was quite similar to the non vegetation case in the cross-over section region...|$|R

Most notable are the occasional bursts of extreme stock price volatility (including the recent boom-and-bust cycle in the NASDAQ) and the limited success of the Capital Asset Pricing Model in accounting for the actual risk-return behavior of stocks. 2002 Morgan Stanley. ...|$|R
40|$|Nonlinear {{electron}} emission processes induced by surface plasmon oscillations {{have been studied}} both experimentally and theoretically. The measured above-threshold electron spectra extend up to energies whose appearance cannot be explained solely by standard non-perturbative methods, which predict photon energy separated discrete energy line spectra with the known fast fall - plateau - cutoff envelope shape, even when taking the large field enhancement into account. The theoretical analysis of our data, based {{on the concept of}} plasmon-induced near-field effects, <b>gives</b> <b>reasonably</b> <b>good</b> explanation and qualitative agreement in the whole intensity range.

Aluminium-based composites containing 2 % by wt copper reinforced with 2. 5 and 5 [*]wt% TiB 2 composites were made in induction furnace by in situ synthesis process using simultaneous addition of halide fluxes (K 2 TiF 6 and KBF 4). These cast composites were evaluated for microstructures, hardness, flow curve properties, and tensile properties.

40|$|Seven RANS models (Spalart-Allmaras, k-epsilon, k-omega; {{and their}} variants, Reynolds Stress Model (RSM)), DES-SST and LES model {{have been used}} to predict the {{pressure}} coefficient (Cp) distribution on a cube and the Cp difference of a canopy in an atmospheric boundary layer flow. The simulation results show that k-omega-SST gives the best prediction in both cases. The RSM also accurately predicts the Cp in the cube case. The k-omega-SST and DES-SST models {{have been used to}} simulate the wind load on flat roof mounted solar panels under similar flow conditions with different wind attack angles. The simulation results demonstrate that both k-omega-SST and DES-SST give <b>good</b> <b>prediction</b> of the drag force at all wind attack angles and <b>reasonably</b> <b>good</b> <b>prediction</b> of the lift force at most wind attack angles. The k-omega-SST model has also been used to investigate the change of wind load on solar panels with three different configurations...|$|R
40|$|In our {{previous}} paper we reported {{the results of}} modeling of 14 selected well -observed strong halo coronal mass ejection (CME) events using the WSA -ENLIL cone model combination. Cone model input parameters were obtained from white light coronagraph images of the CME events using the analytical method developed by Xie et al. This work verified that coronagraph input <b>gives</b> <b>reasonably</b> <b>good</b> results for the CME arrival time prediction. In contrast to Taktakishvili et al., where we started the analysis by looking for clear CME signatures in the data and then proceeded to model the interplanetary consequences at 1 AU, in the present paper we start by generating a list of observed geomagnetic storm events and then work {{our way back to}} remote solar observations and carry out the corresponding CME modeling. The approach used in this study is addressing space weather forecasting and operational needs. We analyzed 36 particularly strong geomagnetic storms, then tried to associate them with particular CMEs using SOHO/LASCO catalogue, and finally modeled these CMEs using WSA-ENLIL cone model. Recently, Pulkkinen et al. developed a novel method for automatic determination of cone model parameters. We employed both analytical and automatic methods to determine cone model input parameters. We examined the CME arrival times and magnitude of impact at 1 AU for both techniques. The results of the simulations are compared with the ACE satellite observations. This comparison demonstrated that WSA -ENLIL model combination with coronagraph input <b>gives</b> <b>reasonably</b> <b>good</b> results for the CME arrival times for this set of 'geoeffective" CME events as well...|$|R
40|$|We revisit {{a totally}} {{asymmetric}} simple exclusion process (TASEP) with open boundaries and a global constraint {{on the total}} number of particles [Adams, et. al. 2008 J. Stat. Mech. P 06009]. In this model, the entry rate of particles into the lattice depends on the number available in the reservoir. Thus, the total occupation on the lattice feeds back into its filling process. Although a simple domain wall theory provided <b>reasonably</b> <b>good</b> <b>predictions</b> for Monte Carlo simulation results for certain quantities, it did not account for the fluctuations of this feedback. We generalize the previous study and find dramatically improved predictions for, e. g., the density profile on the lattice and provide {{a better understanding of the}} phenomenon of "shock localization.

40|$|One of {{the central}} issues in credit risk {{measurement}} and management is modeling and predicting correlated defaults. In this paper we introduce a novel model to investigate the relationship between correlated defaults of different industrial sectors and business cycles {{as well as the}} impacts of business cycles on modeling and predicting correlated defaults using the Probabilistic Boolean Network (PBN). The key idea of the PBN is to decompose a transition probability matrix describing correlated defaults of different sectors into several BN matrices which contain information about business cycles. An efficient estimation method based on an entropy approach is used to estimate the model parameters. Using real default data, we build a PBN for explaining the default structure and making <b>reasonably</b> <b>good</b> <b>predictions</b> of joint defaults in different sectors. 11 page(s...|$|R
