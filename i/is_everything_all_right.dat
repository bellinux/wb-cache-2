5000|$|Harry, however, is {{determined}} to marry Kay. Certain divorce would hurt and humiliate Pat too much. So, he decides to kill her by lacing her daily digestive aid with poison. He visits Kay, who unexpectedly ends their relationship. Harry departs, then returns to ask for all the correspondence he has sent her, only to discover Kay {{in the arms of}} Richard, who had secreted himself upstairs. Realization sets in, and Harry races home to stop his wife from taking her nightly dose of medication. When Harry returns home he finds his wife sleeping, thinking she consumed the poison Harry walks towards the bedroom window and opens it. He is startled by Pat waking up and saying, [...] "You're home early, <b>is</b> <b>everything</b> <b>all</b> <b>right</b> honey." [...] Harry looks out the window in his backyard and sees John O'Brien running away from the house while getting dressed. It was implied that at this moment Harry comes to know about Pat's infidelity. Harry never confronts her, maybe consumed by his own guilt.|$|E
5000|$|The {{housekeeper}} helps Morosus put on {{his finest}} dress-jacket. The Barber arrives and reassures the captain that he has arranged all of the details for the marriage ceremony. He then introduces the three potential brides. Carlotta stands forward acting as [...] "Katherine" [...] a simple country girl. Morosus is not keen: she has {{spent too much time}} with calves and become one herself. The Barber next introduces Isotta, playing the role of noble lady educated {{in a wide range of}} subjects. Morosus is not impressed by this and is suspicious of her ability to play the lute. Lastly, the Barber introduces Aminta acting as the modest and shy [...] "Timidia". Morosus is quite captivated by [...] "Timidia" [...] and tells the barber [...] "she is the one" [...] and orders him to get the priest and notary for the marriage ceremony. Vanuzzi and Morbio act out the roles of parson and notary and the sham marriage takes place. Farfallo arrives with the rest of the troupe playing sailors who have come to celebrate the marriage, making a lot of noise. Morosus is driven mad by the noise and ejects them from the house. Aminta has become quite touched by the genuine love of Morosus, who wants to know why she seems troubled. Eventually, she has to carry out the barber’s plan and starts shouting at Morosus in feigned anger. She wreaks havoc in the house pulling down the curtains and throws some of the captains most precious possessions onto the floor ("away with this junk"). Then Henry arrives to save the day. He forcefully deals with Timidia, and assures his uncle that he will deal with everything. A grateful Morosus thanks Henry: he has survived many sea battles and hurricanes, but would not stand a chance against someone like Timidia. Henry sends the captain off to bed, where he dozes off. Now alone, Aminta and Henry then sing of their love for each other. Morosus awakes and calls down: <b>is</b> <b>everything</b> <b>all</b> <b>right?</b> Yes says Henry. Morosus falls back asleep with a deep sigh which counterpoints with Amita’s sighs of love as the scene closes.|$|E

6000|$|... "That's {{where you}} make a mistake. We're all {{inclined}} to say that <b>everything</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>right</b> as long we aren't ourselves hurt. I sometimes wonder if it is extinct--bullying." ...|$|R

60|$|In {{the morning}} she {{received}} a visit from Sarah--the second in all the period of her marriage; and she could easily guess her sister-in-law's ghoulish errand.

60|$|The person coming was Mary Jane. She {{went to the}} coffin, very soft, and kneeled {{down and}} looked in; then she put up her handkerchief, and I see she begun to cry, though I couldn't hear her, and her back was to me.
