5|$|Most {{bacterial}} {{species are}} either spherical, called cocci (sing. coccus, from Greek kókkos, grain, seed), or rod-shaped, called bacilli (sing. bacillus, from Latin baculus, stick). Elongation {{is associated with}} swimming. Some bacteria, called vibrio, are shaped like slightly curved rods or comma-shaped; others can be spiral-shaped, called spirilla, or tightly coiled, called spirochaetes. A small number of species even have tetrahedral or cuboidal shapes. More recently, some bacteria were discovered deep under Earth's crust that grow as branching filamentous types with a star-shaped cross-section. The large surface {{area to volume ratio}} of this morphology may give these bacteria an advantage in nutrient-poor environments. This wide variety of shapes is determined by the bacterial cell wall and cytoskeleton, and <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> can influence the ability of bacteria to acquire nutrients, attach to surfaces, swim through liquids and escape predators.|$|E
5|$|The {{state of}} Kerala is {{often viewed as}} the ideal {{progressive}} leader in the women’s rights movement in India among states. Kerala maintains very high relative levels of female literacy and women’s health, as well as greater female inheritance and property rights. For example, a 1998 study conducted by Bina Agarwal found that while only 13% of all women in India with landowning fathers inherited that land as daughters, 24% of such women {{were able to do}} so in the state of Kerala. This <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> has been shown that measures to improve such access to property and economic independence through channels such as education not only directly improve women’s wellbeing and capabilities, but also reduce their risk of exposure to marital or any sort of domestic violence.|$|E
25|$|As {{the group}} of all isometries, , the Euclidean group <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> makes Euclidean {{geometry}} a case of Klein geometry, a theoretical framework including many alternative geometries.|$|E
50|$|This case <b>was</b> <b>important</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> one of {{the first}} cases in Illinois to {{challenge}} the patriarchal system and assert the rights of women.|$|R
60|$|She called {{attention}} to the fact that this campaign <b>was</b> <b>important</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> promised more beautiful and attractive houses for the farmers and townsmen alike.|$|R
25|$|The case of Folger vs. Lecuyer <b>was</b> <b>important</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> {{resulted}} in the United States ending French extraterritorial rights with respect to privateers and their prizes.|$|R
25|$|Geometry <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> is more {{difficult}} to push water through a long, narrow pipe than a wide, short pipe. In the same way, a long, thin copper wire has higher resistance (lower conductance) than a short, thick copper wire.|$|E
25|$|The {{language}} of category theory provides a concise definition for Lie groups: a Lie {{group is a}} group object {{in the category of}} smooth manifolds. This <b>is</b> <b>important,</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> allows generalization of the notion of a Lie group to Lie supergroups.|$|E
25|$|The {{viscosity}} of lava <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> {{determines how}} the lava will behave. Lavas with high viscosity are rhyolite, dacite, andesite and trachyte, with cooled basaltic lava also quite viscous; {{those with low}} viscosities are freshly erupted basalt, carbonatite and occasionally andesite.|$|E
50|$|Two, {{a measure}} to {{validate}} the SPFD. Validation <b>was</b> <b>important,</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> would allow the district to implement a 2% hotel tax to further fund construction.|$|R
5000|$|While the {{majority}} demographic of the Gay Activist Alliance were men, this sub-committee <b>was</b> <b>important</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> devoted to planning events in order, “to support {{a sense of}} community among all lesbians.” ...|$|R
50|$|Father Kapsner died in Minnesota in January 1973. His {{pamphlet}} <b>was</b> <b>important</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> {{brought a}} detailed account of an American exorcism to a large audience {{for the first time in}} the United States.|$|R
25|$|An {{important}} thing for Adler is that God (or the idea of God) motivates people to act, and that those actions do have real consequences for ourselves and for others. Our view of God <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> embodies our goals and directs our social interactions.|$|E
25|$|This {{relative}} weakness <b>is</b> <b>important,</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> {{would allow}} the relatively small east-west compressive forces associated with the continuing continental drift of the North American plate to reactivate old faults around New Madrid, making the area unusually prone to earthquakes in spite of it being far from the nearest tectonic plate boundary.|$|E
25|$|Sirens {{must also}} be {{approved}} by local agencies, in some cases. For example, the California Highway Patrol approves specific models for use on emergency vehicles in the state. The approval <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> ensures the devices perform adequately. Moreover, using unapproved devices could {{be a factor in}} determining fault if a collision occurs.|$|E
5000|$|Chongju <b>was</b> <b>important</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> {{provided}} {{as an important}} center for transporting supplies to Japanese forces in the north. Also, Chongju was one way to Hanseong (Seoul). Chongju was under the general of Hachisuka Iemasa (1558-1638).|$|R
5000|$|In Commission v Italy (1968) Case 7/68, Italy was {{not allowed}} to tax the export of art treasures. This case <b>was</b> <b>important</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> helped define {{the meaning of the word}} [...] "goods" [...] under European Law.|$|R
50|$|This product <b>was</b> <b>important</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{the first}} {{loudspeaker}} system which, {{due to its}} particular crossover, showed a flat impedance curve (except for the resonance peak) with a consequent easier work for the amplifier and linear frequency response.|$|R
25|$|Critical {{infrastructure}} protection {{requires the}} development of a national capability to identify and monitor the critical elements and to determine when and if the elements are under attack or are the victim of destructive natural occurrences. CIP <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> is the link between risk management and infrastructure assurance. It provides the capability needed to eliminate potential vulnerabilities in the critical infrastructure.|$|E
25|$|Therefore, ‘A’ and ‘B’ were {{copied from}} the same archetype/s as they agree on the grand total (less 1600 for Buckingham), yet differ only in their final sentence/statements {{as to what the}} figures demonstrate, a formula for {{manpower}} or a total of hidage. This <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> evidentially contradicts any proposal that the recensions had burh added or subtracted to reflect ‘new’ or ‘abandoned’ burh.|$|E
25|$|Phosphorylation helps many {{proteins}} {{bind the}} polypeptide, keeping it from folding prematurely. This <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> prevents chloroplast proteins from assuming their active form and carrying out their chloroplast {{functions in the}} wrong place—the cytosol. At the same time, they have to keep just enough shape {{so that they can}} be recognized by the chloroplast. These proteins also help the polypeptide get imported into the chloroplast.|$|E
50|$|Very few animal models exhibit A. terreus infections. Some {{successful}} animal models {{include the}} mouse and rabbit where A. terreus has formed pulmonary aspergillosis. These studies <b>are</b> <b>important</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> provides {{evidence that this}} fungal infection can cause disease.|$|R
5000|$|Historically {{the rocks}} <b>were</b> <b>important</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{likely that a}} ford had been created here by the Elbe which could {{eventually}} {{have resulted in the}} settlement that led to the city of Magdeburg growing up on its present site.|$|R
50|$|The {{remains of}} the old {{fortress}} of Humaitá are located {{on the left side}} of the Paraguay River, approximately 430 km to the south of Asunción.During the Paraguayan War (1864-1870) this fortress <b>was</b> <b>important</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> controlled river access to the capital, Asunción.|$|R
25|$|Soaking the maize in limewater <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> makes {{available}} the B vitamin niacin and {{the amino}} acid tryptophan. When maize {{was brought to}} Europe, Africa and Asia from the New World, this crucial step was often omitted. Those whose diet consisted mostly of corn meal often became sick— {{because of the lack}} of niacin and tryptophan— with the deficiency disease pellagra, which was common in Spain, Northern Italy, and the southern United States.|$|E
25|$|The {{geographic}} location <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> affects transportation {{costs to the}} refinery. Light crude oil is more desirable than heavy oil since it produces a higher yield of gasoline, while sweet oil commands a higher price than sour oil because it has fewer environmental problems and requires less refining to meet sulfur standards imposed on fuels in consuming countries. Each crude oil has unique molecular characteristics which are revealed {{by the use of}} Crude oil assay analysis in petroleum laboratories.|$|E
25|$|The {{information}} that follows describing the other {{various types of}} creosote materials and its uses {{should be considered as}} primarily being of only historical value. This history <b>is</b> <b>important,</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> traces the origin of these different materials used during the 19th and early 20th centuries. Furthermore, it must be considered that these other types of creosotes –- lignite-tar, wood-tar, water-gas-tar, etc. –- are not currently being manufactured and have either been replaced with more economical materials, or replaced by products that are more efficacious.|$|E
50|$|Besuki is {{the name}} of a {{district}} (kecamatan) in Situbondo Regency, East Java, Indonesia with an area of 26.08 km2. In 2004, its population was 57,109 people. In ancient time the city <b>was</b> <b>important</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> the capital of the Residency of Besuki.|$|R
50|$|For some individuals, {{over two}} years had elapsed between their first and last sittings, with some {{subjects}} being photographed multiple times. This time lapse <b>was</b> <b>important</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> enabled researchers to study, for the first time, changes in a subject’s appearance that occur over a year.|$|R
50|$|According to the President of the European Parliament, Jerzy Buzek {{who opened}} the conference: The Bulgarian {{opposition}} <b>was</b> <b>important</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> preserved European values - democracy, the right of ownership, the ideas of freedom of thought and expression - which are {{the basis of the}} European Union.|$|R
25|$|Dr. Gordon Willey and Albert Norweb {{excavated}} the Cruz site (named {{after the}} Cruz Hacienda), on the North East {{part of the}} island. This site <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> produced nearly 30,000 sherds, most of which belonged to the Late Polychrome Period. The upper levels of the site produced the diagnostic ceramic types which came to define the Late Polychrome Period {{for the whole of}} the Rivas area. Pieces were also found from the San Jorge phase of the Zoned Bichrome Period (Healy, 1980).|$|E
25|$|Phenotypic {{plasticity}} <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> allows {{an individual}} {{to adapt to a}} changing environment and can ultimately alter their evolutionary path. It not only plays an indirect role in defense as individuals prepare themselves physically to take on the task of avoiding predation through camouflage or developing collective mechanical traits to protect a social hive, but also a direct one. For example, cues elicited from a predator, which may be visual, acoustic, chemical, or vibrational, may cause rapid responses that alter the prey’s phenotype in real time.|$|E
25|$|Studying bilingual {{acquisition}} <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> {{may have}} real effects on academic performances for bilingual children in school. Research {{has shown that}} vocabulary size is an indicator of academic performance and literacy. As we know, different contexts can cause differences in vocabulary in each language. Despite these differences, have suggested that bilingual children are not necessarily disadvantaged in academic performance or academic spoken language {{because they have a}} good grasp on the language used for their academics. Regardless, home vocabulary is still relevant to academic life, and it is important to get a better balance in vocabulary acquisition to be able to effectively communicate in both languages.|$|E
5000|$|Despite its short life, this {{constitution}} <b>was</b> <b>important</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{the first}} time a Brazilian constitution was written from scratch by directly elected deputies in multi-party elections. As a consequence of this, it incorporated a number of improvements to Brazilian political, social and economical life: ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to his law enforcement work, Pitchess served on the Los Angeles County Civil Defense and Disaster Commission during the nuclear crisis in the early 1960s. [...] The position <b>was</b> <b>important</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{at the time of}} the peak of the cold war nuclear scare.|$|R
40|$|Clinic {{supervision}} as one {{of supervision}} models must be improved it's effectivity of implementation. <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>because</b> <b>it's</b> solution can improve the teacher's weakness {{in teaching and learning}} process. profesionality and self development of teacher are an effort to reach national education, goal, therefore clinic supervision <b>is</b> <b>important...</b>|$|R
