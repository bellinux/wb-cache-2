His precinct responds to a hostage situation at a local liquor store that becomes difficult when it evolves into a media circus, complicated by an aggressive SWAT team leader, Howard Hunter (James B. Sikking), who encounters nervous young gang members. Furillo attempts to negotiate with their gang leader. His secret lover, public defender Joyce Davenport (Veronica Hamel), appears to be his nemesis as she hounds him about a client who is the lost victim of police bureaucracy.

5|$|Jonathan Jennings was {{the first}} Governor to have an {{attempted}} impeachment brought against him <b>in</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> actions {{as an agent of}} the federal government during the negotiations of the Treaty of St. Mary's in 1819, illegal under Indiana's constitution. The evidence of his role was destroyed, and after two months of investigation the proceedings were dropped. The only other time was when the General Assembly attempted to bring impeachment proceedings against Governor James B. Ray for a similar action in 1826, but the action was also defeated 28–30.|$|E

5|$|The {{legislature}} heeded some of Clark's message. They added {{a second}} auditor {{in the office}} of the state auditor, and gave greater discretion to the state's sinking fund commission. They created a state board of education and the office of state superintendent.

5|$|In 1860, Terry {{was elected}} Councillor for York's Monk Ward, {{a rural area}} close to the modern day Strays of York, as a Conservative. He would later be {{appointed}} Chairman of the York Conservative Association (something that his grandson, Noel Goddard Terry, would also later achieve). Experience in local government was heightened by his election as sheriff, equivalent to a deputy mayoral position, in 1870 under Liberal MP George Leeman, who served as Member of Parliament for the City of York constituency for three years prior to his appointment as Lord Mayor. In 1874, Terry became an Alderman of the City, granting him a seat at York's Guildhall for debate in a then partisan chamber under the Conservatives. The party, <b>in</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> growing popularity, allowed him {{to run for the}} Lord Mayoralty within the same year, to which he was elected by consensus, defeating the incumbent local brewer, John March. This position granted him the style the 'Right Honourable' (a title exclusive to the Lord Mayoralty, not the individual).|$|E
5|$|In August 1994, Parliament {{intended}} to amend Article 22H {{to restrict the}} President's powers thereunder to only non-constitutional bills which provided for the circumvention or curtailment of the President's discretionary powers conferred upon him by the Constitution. Because Article 5(2A) was not in force, a question arose {{as to whether the}} President had the power under Article 22H(1) to withhold his assent to any bill seeking to amend any of the provisions referred to in Article 5(2A), and specifically to any bill seeking to amend Article 22H. President Ong Teng Cheong stated that in the interest of testing out the system, he wished to have this question referred to the courts for a ruling, and that he would accept as correct whatever interpretation of Article 22H was given by the court. <b>In</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> request, Article 100 was inserted into the Constitution by Parliament for that purpose.|$|E

5|$|Kenyatta {{sought to}} find a wife; his first attempt failed when it was {{revealed}} that his proposed bride was related to his clan. He subsequently entered a relationship with Grace Wahu, who had attended the CMS School in Kabete; she initially moved in to Kenyatta's family homestead, although joined Kenyatta in Dagoretti when Ngengi drove her out. On 20 November 1920 their son was born, and named Peter Muigui. In October 1920, Kenyatta was called before the Thogota Kirk Session and suspended from taking Holy Communion; the suspension was <b>in</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> drinking and his relations with Wahu out of wedlock. The church insisted that a traditional Kikuyu wedding would be inadequate, and that he must undergo a Christian civil marriage; this took place on 8 November 1922. Kenyatta had initially refused to cease drinking, but in July 1923 officially renounced alcohol and was allowed to return to Holy Communion.|$|E
5|$|Kratos {{is leading}} the Spartan army in a rampage across Greece. During the campaign, he is {{attacked}} {{by a number of}} beasts led by Argos, who was sent by the gods to stop Kratos. After a series of skirmishes, Argos is killed by an unknown assassin, who frames Kratos in an attempt to turn the gods against him. The Spartan pursues his foe across Greece to discover the identity of the assassin, but is slowed by constant attacks from the minions of Hades, the God of the Underworld. Zeus sends Ceryx to deliver a message to Kratos: stop the relentless pursuit and take heed of the destruction already caused. Kratos, however, battles and kills Ceryx, which inadvertently allows the assassin to escape. Kratos then realizes his actions have further alienated the gods, and Zeus will soon act <b>in</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> defiance.|$|E
5|$|The revolt {{probably}} {{took place}} at Amorion, {{the capital of the}} Anatolic Theme. From there, the rebel army, comprising almost half of the Empire's available military forces, marched north and west, following the military road to Nicomedia and then to Chrysopolis, the town that lay across the Bosporus from the imperial capital, Constantinople. There, Bardanes encamped for eight days, awaiting a possible uprising against Nikephoros inside the capital <b>in</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> own rebellion. Since this did not materialize, and the populace proved not overtly enthusiastic, he withdrew to the great army base at Malagina. There, two of his associates, Michael the Amorian and Leo the Armenian, abandoned him, and were richly rewarded by Nikephoros for their defection: Michael became Count of the Tent to the Emperor, and Leo was appointed commander of the Foederati regiment.|$|E

5|$|The {{trial of}} Thomas Paine for seditious libel {{was held on}} 18 December 1792, <b>in</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> {{publication}} of {{the second part of}} the Rights of Man. The government of William Pitt, worried by the possibility that the French Revolution might spread to England, had begun suppressing works that espoused radical philosophies. Paine's work, which advocated the right of the people to overthrow their government, was duly targeted, with a writ for his arrest issued on 21 May. Paine fled to France in September, having been elected a member of the National Convention in France. He was instead represented in absentia by Thomas Erskine, a noted lawyer and orator who was severely criticised by government supporters in the months leading up to the trial.|$|E
5|$|The {{journey to}} the Eastern Mediterranean was inevitably long and eventful. Travelling overland, Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor, drowned in the Saleph River, and few of his men reached the Eastern Mediterranean. Travelling by sea, Richard the Lionheart, King of England conquered Cyprus in 1191 <b>in</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> sister and fiancée, who were {{travelling}} separately, being taken captive by the island's ruler, Isaac Komnenos. Philip II of France was the first king {{to arrive at the}} siege of Acre; Richard arrived on 8June 1191. The arrival of the French and Angevin forces turned the tide in the conflict, and the Muslim garrison of Acre finally surrendered on 12July. Philip considered his vow fulfilled and returned to France to deal with domestic matters, leaving most of his forces behind. But Richard travelled south along the Mediterranean coast, defeated the Muslims near Arsuf, and recaptured the port city of Jaffa. He twice advanced to within a day's march of Jerusalem before judging that he lacked the resources to successfully capture the city, or defend it in the unlikely event of a successful assault, while Saladin had a mustered army. This marked the end of Richard's crusading career and was a calamitous blow to Frankish morale. A three-year truce was negotiated that allowed Catholics unfettered access to Jerusalem. Politics in England and illness forced Richard's departure, never to return, and Saladin died in March 1193. Emperor HenryVI initiated the German Crusade to fulfil the promises made by his father, Frederick, to undertake a Crusade to the Holy Land. Led by Conrad, Archbishop of Mainz, the army captured the cities of Sidon and Beirut. However, in 1197 Henry died and most of the Crusaders returned to Germany to protect their holdings and take part in the election of his successor as Emperor.|$|E
