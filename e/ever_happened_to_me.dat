5|$|As I {{look back}} on it today, I see the whole picture very differently. It's true that I hated missing out on Sexton. And the first few months, I was miserable at Everett. But being bused to Everett {{turned out to be one}} of the best things that <b>ever</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> It got me out of my own little world and taught me how to {{understand}} white people, how to communicate and deal with them.|$|E
500|$|... "Sometimes when I'm {{writing a}} song, {{it does come}} from such a raw place that I'm {{actually}} crying while writing it," [...] Mariah admitted. Her second single, a tribute to her late father, is also meant to reach anyone else who has suffered a loss of a loved one. [...] "Sometimes I hear it and {{feel that this is}} going to touch a lot of people, and that's why it's important that no matter what's <b>ever</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> over my career, that I stay the course and continue to write and try and reach people who need." [...] Anyone who manages to do the reverse, and touch Mariah with one of their songs, [...] "I'm indebted to them forever." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} played only once and {{received}} minor treatments afterwards, {{with the addition}} of a cello part in the introduction and some editing, which included removing a verse to reduce the song's length. Eno was outraged that U2 wanted to shorten the song, and he was adamant that the band not alter the original track too much, saying, [...] "These fucking guys, they're supposed to be so spiritual—they don't spot a miracle when it hits them in the face. Nothing like that <b>ever</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> in the studio in my whole life." [...] The band's original concept for No Line on the Horizon was to create an album of future hymns—songs that would be played forever. According to Eno and Lanois, [...] "Moment of Surrender" [...] is the closest the band came to reaching that concept.|$|E

500|$|She later {{formed the}} Pagan Babies with friend Kat Bjelland, whom she {{met at the}} Satyricon club in Portland in 1984. As Love later reflected, [...] "The best thing that <b>ever</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> in a way, was Kat." [...] Love asked Bjelland to start a band with her as a guitarist, and the two moved to San Francisco in June 1985, where they {{recruited}} bassist Jennifer Finch and drummer Janis Tanaka. According to Bjelland, [...] " [...] didn't play an instrument at the time" [...] aside from keyboards, so Bjelland would transcribe Love's musical ideas on guitar for her. The group played several house shows and recorded one 4-track demo before disbanding in late 1985. After Pagan Babies, Love moved to Minneapolis, where Bjelland had formed the group Babes in Toyland, and briefly worked as a concert promoter before returning to California.|$|E
500|$|Patton {{attracted}} controversy {{as military}} governor {{when it was}} noted that several former Nazi Party members continued to hold political posts in the region. When responding to the press about the subject, Patton repeatedly compared Nazis to Democrats and Republicans in noting {{that most of the people}} with experience in infrastructure management had been compelled to join the party in the war, causing negative press stateside and angering Eisenhower. On September 28, 1945, after a heated exchange with Eisenhower over his statements, Patton was relieved of his military governorship. He was relieved of command of the Third Army on October 7, and in a somber change of command ceremony, Patton concluded his farewell remarks, [...] "All good things must come to an end. The best thing that has <b>ever</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> thus far is the honor and privilege of having commanded the Third Army." ...|$|E
500|$|Angelou {{came up with}} Letter to My Daughter, {{which became}} a New York Times bestseller, while going through old boxes of notes and papers full of {{concepts}} for future books and poems, which she called [...] "WIP" [...] ("Works in Progress"). She found twenty years worth of notes written to her friend Oprah Winfrey, and realized that she should put the essays they inspired into a book so that others could read them. Although she had no daughters, and {{gave birth to a}} son (Guy Johnson), which she called [...] "the best thing that <b>ever</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> in my life", many women in Angelou's career looked to her as a mother figure. She wrote Letters to speak to those women and to share with them the wisdom she has gained throughout her long life. According to writer Gary Younge of The Guardian, most of the essays [...] "end with the kind of wisdom that, depending on your taste, qualifies as either homespun or hokey". For example, she uses what has been called her most famous statement, when speaking of Cuban artist Celia Cruz: [...] "We are more alike than unalike". Although Angelou discounts the idea when he brings it up to her, Younge thinks Letter reads like an extended farewell; in her 500-word introduction she mentions death twice.|$|E

6000|$|... "Some lifetimes," [...] said Mr. Chalk, gloomily. [...] "I’m fifty-one next year, and {{the only}} thing I <b>ever</b> had <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> was seeing a man stop a runaway horse and cart." ...|$|R
2500|$|In a {{press conference}} on May 19, Bunning called Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell a [...] "control freak": [...] "If Mitch McConnell doesn't endorse me, {{it could be the}} best thing that <b>ever</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> in Kentucky." ...|$|E
2500|$|In her 2010 {{episode of}} Behind the Music, Courtney Love {{reflected}} on her formative years in rock music in Portland, Oregon, and said, [...] "The {{best thing that}} <b>ever</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> in a way, was Kat", noting their friendship and musical collaboration. Because of Kat's closeness with Kurt Cobain, Bjelland went to Seattle immediately after Kurt Cobain's death in 1994. Bjelland also participated in the Behind the Music segment on Love in 2010.|$|E
2500|$|James D. Watson {{was born}} in Chicago, Illinois, on April 6, 1928, as the only son of Jean (Mitchell) and James D. Watson, a {{businessman}} descended mostly from colonial English immigrants to America. His mother's father, Lauchlin Mitchell, a tailor, was from Glasgow, Scotland, and her mother, Lizzie Gleason, was the child of Irish parents from Tipperary. Raised Catholic, he later described himself as [...] "an escapee from the Catholic religion." [...] Watson said, [...] "The luckiest thing that <b>ever</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> was that my father didn't believe in God." ...|$|E
60|$|I can't {{imagine why}} Aunt Jemima thought I should like a diary. Probably she didn't {{think about it}} at all. I suppose it <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> {{be the first thing}} she saw when she started out to do her Christmas duty by me, and so she bought it. I'm sure I'm the last girl in the world to keep a diary. I'm not a bit sentimental and I never have time for soul outpourings. It's jollier to be out skating or snowshoeing or just {{tramping}} around. And besides, nothing <b>ever</b> <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> worth writing in a diary.|$|R
6000|$|... "Always, Nelly," [...] Jack said earnestly. [...] "Wherever or {{whatever}} Jack Simpson may be, he {{will ever be}} your true and faithful friend, and nothing which may <b>ever</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> no rise I may ever make, will give me the pleasure which this good fortune which has befallen you has done. If I ever rise it will make <b>me</b> happy <b>to</b> help Harry, but I know you would never have let me help you, and this thought would have marred my life. Now that I {{see you in a}} position in which I am sure you will be successful, and which is an honourable and pleasant one, I shall the more enjoy my rise when it comes.--Does any one else know of it?" [...] he asked as they went on their way.|$|R

2500|$|Hazel Mangle Rivers, who {{had paid}} $8 for her ticket—"one-tenth of her husband's weekly salary"—was {{quoted in the}} August 29 New York Times. Rivers stated that she was {{impressed}} by Washington's civility: [...] "The people are lots better up here than they are down South. [...] They treat you much nicer. Why, when I was out there at the march a white man stepped on my foot, and he said, [...] "Excuse me," [...] and I said [...] "Certainly!"

5000|$|Most {{tracks on}} Red Flag {{were written by}} Lewis with themes very {{personal}} to the group. They were written with a significantly more mature perspective {{than that of the}} group's previous releases. In an interview for The Observer, Lewis explained: [...] "Because we're old enough to know that hey, life's not perfect, and it's not like: 'I'm in love and nothing bad will <b>ever</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> …' No. Shit happens." [...] One Strike" [...] was inspired by the breakdown of group member Nicole Appleton's highly-publicised marriage to Oasis and Beady Eye band member Liam Gallagher. It details Nicole's emotions when it was revealed to her that Gallagher had an affair and was expecting a child with American journalist Liza Ghorbani. Blatt cited Red Flag as the group's best output and her favourite All Saints album and the one she [...] "always wanted them to make", while Lewis said it [...] "couldn't feel any more right".|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{shall not}} quit you, ma'am, {{now that you}} are married?" [...] Ann Sidley timidly asked; for, {{although}} she could scarcely think such an event {{within the bounds of}} probability, and Eve had already more than once assured her of the contrary with her own tongue, still did she love to have assurance made doubly sure. [...] "I hope nothing will <b>ever</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> make <b>me</b> quit you, ma'am?" ...|$|R
50|$|The very {{worst part}} was, after that surgery {{they had to}} take all my {{bandages}} off in this place called the whirlpool room. That was pure hell because it felt like they were just ripping my skin off. The pain wasn’t like anything I’ve ever felt. It’s so different from anything that I’ve <b>ever</b> felt <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> on a skateboard. It felt like it was constantly burning, like I was still on fire.|$|R
60|$|HIGGINS [with dignity, in {{his finest}} {{professional}} style] You have {{caused me to}} lose my temper: a thing that has hardly <b>ever</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> before. I prefer to say nothing more tonight. I am going to bed.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{never have}} had," [...] Jack said; [...] "it {{has been the}} best thing that <b>ever</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> If I had had my own way I should still be working before the mast instead of being a captain in the army." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no," [...] she answered, [...] "none now--at least, none here. I have--I mean I had--a sister, my twin, but {{she died}} {{when we were}} seventeen. This was the most dreadful thing that <b>ever</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> the thing which made me what I am." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{do indeed}} feel {{the loss of}} Manning, if {{and as far as}} I am capable [...] of feeling anything. It comes <b>to</b> <b>me</b> cumulated, and doubled, with [...] that of James Hope.

6000|$|So she did that, {{and when}} her own son bowed his head, her {{servants}} put a mark on him that she would know him again. And when they were all sitting at their dinner after that, she said to Jack, that was the cook's son, [...] "It is {{time for you to}} go away out of this, for you are not my son." [...] And her own son, that we will call Bill, said, [...] "Do not send him away, are we not brothers?" [...] But Jack said, [...] "I would have been long ago out of this house if I knew it was not my own father and mother owned it." [...] And for all Bill could say to him, he would not stop. But before he went, they were by the well that was in the garden, and he said to Bill, [...] "If harm <b>ever</b> <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> that water {{on the top of the}} well will be blood, and the water below will be honey." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think I might manage that, Gerald. It is {{not likely}} that the duenna <b>ever</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> notice <b>me.</b> I might {{therefore}} put on any sort of disguise as a beggar and take my place on the road as she goes to chapel, and somehow or other get your note into her hand. I have heard Spanish girls are very quick at acting upon the smallest sign, and if I can manage to catch her eye {{for a moment she}} may probably be ingenious enough <b>to</b> afford <b>me</b> an opportunity of passing the note to her." ...|$|R

"Now, {{of all the}} disgustin' {{things that}} <b>ever</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> this is the worst," [...] remarked Captain Dunning, in a very sulky tone of voice, as he descended to the cabin to change his garments, Ailie having preceded him in order to lay out dry clothes.|$|E

6000|$|... "Lucky!"

60|$|There {{must have}} been a lurking anxiety in all the boys' hearts when they went in without leave, or, as my boy was apt to do, when {{explicitly}} forbidden. He was not apt at lying, I dare say, and so he took the course of open disobedience. He could not see the danger that filled the home hearts with fear for him, and he must have often broken the law and been forgiven, before Justice one day appeared for him on the river-bank and called him away from his stolen joys. It was an awful moment, and it covered him with shame before his mates, who heartlessly rejoiced, as children do, in the doom which they are escaping. That sin, at least, he fully expiated; and I will whisper to the Young People here {{at the end of the}} chapter, that somehow, soon or late, our sins do overtake us, and insist upon being paid for. That is not the best reason for not sinning, but it is well to know it, and to believe it in our acts as well as our thoughts. You will find people to tell you that things only happen so and so. It may be; only, I know that no good thing <b>ever</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> when I had done wrong.|$|R

He is of one-quarter Irish and three-quarters Italian descent. His father, Joseph, worked {{as a police officer}} in Newark. At five years of age, Rogan's parents divorced, and his father has not been in contact with him since he was seven. Rogan said of his father: [...] "All I remember of my dad are these brief, violent flashes of domestic violence ... But I don't want to complain about my childhood.
