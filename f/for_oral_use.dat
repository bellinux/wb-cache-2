25|$|In 1931, Butenandt {{found that}} the benzoic acid ester of estrone had a {{prolonged}} duration of action. Subsequently, Schwenk and Hildebrant synthesized estradiol benzoate from estradiol in 1933, and estradiol benzoate was introduced by Schering-Kahlbaum for medical use via intramuscular injection under the brand name Progynon-B in 1936. It was the first estrogen ester to be marketed, and has since been followed by many additional esters, for instance estradiol valerate and estradiol cypionate in the 1950s. Ethinylestradiol was synthesized from estradiol by Inhoffen and Hohlweg in 1938 and was introduced <b>for</b> <b>oral</b> <b>use</b> by Schering in the United States under the brand name Estinyl in 1943.

40|$|The {{magnitude}} of the relative risk of venous thrombosis caused by low-dose <b>oral</b> contraceptive <b>use</b> is still debated because previous studies might {{have been affected by}} diagnostic suspicion and referral bias. We conducted a case-control study in which the effect of diagnostic suspicion and referral bias was excluded. The study was performed in 2 diagnostic centers to which patients with clinically suspected deep vein thrombosis of the leg were referred. History of <b>oral</b> contraceptive <b>use</b> was obtained before objective testing for thrombosis. Young females with an objective diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis were considered case patients, and those who were referred with the same clinical suspicion but who had no thrombosis served as control subjects. Participants were seen between September 1, 1982, and October 18, 1995 : 185 consecutive patients and 591 controls aged 15 to 49 years with a first episode of venous thrombosis and without malignant neoplasms, pregnancy, or known inherited clotting defects. The overall odds ratio <b>for</b> <b>oral</b> contraceptive <b>use</b> was 3. 2 (95 % confidence interval [CI], 2. 3 - 4. 5); after adjustment for age, family history of venous thrombosis, calendar time, and center, the odds ratio was 3. 9 (95 % CI, 2. 6 - 5. 7). In the idiopathic group (120 patients and 413 controls, excluding recent surgery, trauma, or immobilization), the odds ratio <b>for</b> <b>oral</b> contraceptive <b>use</b> was 3. 8 (95 % CI, 2. 5 - 5. 9); after adjustment, the odds ratio was 5. 0 (95 % CI, 3. 1 - 8. 2).

40|$|Summary The anticancer drug {{paclitaxel}} is formulated for i. v. {{administration in}} a mixture of Cremophor EL and ethanol. Its oral bioavailability is very low due to the action of P-glycoprotein in the gut wall and CYP 450 in gut wall and liver. However, proof-of-concept studies using the i. v. formulation diluted in drinking water have demonstrated the feasibility of the oral route as an alternative when given in combination with inhibitors of P-glycoprotein and CYP 450. Because of the unacceptable pharmaceutical properties of the drinking solution, a better formulation <b>for</b> <b>oral</b> application is needed. We have evaluated the suitability of various self-micro emulsifying oily formulations (SMEOF’s) of paclitaxel <b>for</b> <b>oral</b> application <b>using</b> wild-type and P-glycoprotein knockout mice and cyclosporin A (CsA) as P-glycoprotein and CYP 450 inhibitor.

In the current study, blood samples of oral cancer patients were analyzed using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to derive a metabolic signature <b>for</b> <b>oral</b> cancer. <b>Using</b> multivariate chemometric analysis, we obtained an excellent discrimination between serum samples from cancer patients and from a control group and could also discriminate between different stages of disease.

50|$|Solid lipid {{nanoparticles}} {{have recently}} materialized as {{a novel approach}} to oral and parenteral drug delivery systems. SLNs combine the advantages of lipid emulsion and polymeric nanoparticle systems while overcoming the temporal and in vivo stability issues that troubles the conventional as well as polymeric nanoparticles drug delivery approaches (Mehnert et al., 2001). It has been proposed that SLNs combine numerous advantages over the other colloidal carriers i.e. incorporation of lipophilic and hydrophilic drugs feasible, no biotoxicity of the carrier, avoidance of organic solvents, possibility of controlled drug release and drug targeting, increased drug stability and no problems with respect to large scale production. A recent study has demonstrated the use of solid lipid nanoparticles as a platform <b>for</b> <b>oral</b> delivery of the nutrient mineral iron, by incorporating the hydrophilic molecule ferrous sulphate (FeSO4) in a lipid matrix composed of stearic acid.

40|$|BACKGROUND—Women with Crohn's {{disease are}} usually advised {{not to take}} oral contraceptives, but, unlike smoking, {{there is no clear}} {{association}} between current <b>oral</b> contraceptive <b>use</b> and more severe disease.  AIM—To assess the effect of <b>oral</b> contraceptive <b>use</b> on the clinical course of Crohn's disease.  PATIENTS— 331 women, aged 16 - 50 years, with Crohn's disease and Crohn's disease activity index < 200, were enrolled consecutively during a one year period. Patients were classified at inclusion as oral contraceptive users or non-users and smokers or non-smokers.  METHODS—A prospective 12 - 18 month cohort study was used. The main outcome measures were flare up rate and time to flare up.  RESULTS—In total, 134  women <b>used</b> <b>oral</b> contraceptives, in most cases low oestrogen formulations. During the study period, 61  oral contraceptive users (46 %) developed a flare up, compared with 85  non-users (43 %). The hazard ratio <b>for</b> <b>oral</b> contraceptive <b>use</b> was 1. 11  (95 % confidence interval 0. 80  to 1. 55). Variables associated with flare up were smoking status, recently active disease, baseline Crohn's disease activity index, and presence of anoperineal lesions. The same results were obtained when the analysis was restricted to patients eligible for a relapse prevention trial.  CONCLUSION—Unlike smoking, oral contraceptives have no effect on Crohn's disease activity.    Keywords: Crohn's disease; smoking; oral contraceptive...|$|R
