5|$|Before {{and during}} the summit US {{president}} George W. Bush, British prime minister Tony Blair, Canadian prime minister Stephen Harper and Dutch Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende made a plea to European NATO members to make more troops available for deployment in Afghanistan, remove the national caveats (i.e. national restrictions on <b>how,</b> <b>when</b> and where forces can be used) and start sending its troops into the conflict-ridden south of the country. According to Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR) General James L. Jones {{it was not the}} lack of combat troops and the caveats were the problem, but the lack of adequate helicopters and military intelligence to support airlift and on-the-ground operations.|$|E
5|$|During a hailstorm in Washington state, {{university}} students run to find shelter. One girl, Lauren (Kristi Angus), {{stands in the}} rain, lights a cigarette, and goes up in flames. Millennium Group consultant Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) travels to the university to interview witnesses to the death. A teaching assistant tells Black that the dead girl was highly intelligent, pointing out an armillary sphere Lauren had constructed. She also tells Black that the previous Millennium Group contact had taken great interest in this sphere. Black did not realize the Group had sent another member, but on leaving, he meets the man in question—Dennis Hoffman (Brad Dourif). Hoffman describes his theories to Black, detailing <b>how</b> <b>when</b> several planets achieve syzygy on May 5, 2000, a series of natural disasters will bring {{about the end of}} the world. Hoffman believes that this cataclysm will be preceded by strange events and weather patterns.|$|E
5|$|While {{pursuing}} the thief, Spyro discovers a world once inhabited by the dragons, but long abandoned and forgotten. This world {{is under the}} iron-fisted reign of the Sorceress and her Rhynoc army. Spyro meets with Shiela the Kangaroo, Sergeant Byrd the Penguin, Bentley the Yeti, and Agent 9 the Monkey who help him on his quest. Shiela tells Spyro <b>how</b> <b>when</b> the dragons left the realm, the world's magic began to dry up. Spyro travels through each world in the forgotten realm, acquiring aid from the local inhabitants and rescuing the dragon eggs. It is revealed that the Sorceress is seeking not the baby dragons themselves, but merely their wings to concoct a spell that can grant her immortality. Once Bianca learns about this, she turns against the Sorceress and decides to help Spyro defeat her. Spyro fights and defeats the Sorceress, but she survives the battle and waits for him. After he defeats her again and retrieves the last dragon egg, Spyro returns all of the baby dragons to the Dragon Realms.|$|E

25|$|Exactly <b>how,</b> <b>when,</b> or why Harry Nyquist had {{his name}} {{attached}} to the sampling theorem remains obscure. The term Nyquist Sampling Theorem (capitalized thus) appeared as early as 1959 in a book from his former employer, Bell Labs, and appeared again in 1963, and not capitalized in 1965. It had been called the Shannon Sampling Theorem as early as 1954, but also just the sampling theorem by several other books in the early 1950s.|$|E
25|$|Workers {{were given}} the right {{to belong to a}} {{registered}} trade union or not to belong to a registered or unregistered trade union. Collective agreements were to be legally enforceable unless a disclaimer clause was inserted. There was a greater chance that collective 'no strike' clauses could be implied into individual contracts of employment. Only registered trade unions had legal rights and to enjoy legal immunities. Continued registration was dependent on the organisation having rules which specified <b>how,</b> <b>when</b> and by whom, authority was to be exercised, especially concerning the taking of industrial action.|$|E

25|$|The Zachman Framework is an {{enterprise}} ontology {{and is a}} fundamental structure for Enterprise Architecture which provides a formal and structured way of viewing and defining {{an enterprise}}. The ontology is a two dimensional classification schema that reflects the intersection between two historical classifications. The first are primitive interrogatives: What, <b>How,</b> <b>When,</b> Who, Where, and Why. The second {{is derived from the}} philosophical concept of reification, the transformation of an abstract idea into an instantiation. The Zachman Framework reification transformations are: Identification, Definition, Representation, Specification, Configuration and Instantiation.|$|E
25|$|After {{entering}} a picture gallery, {{he meets with}} an old poet, Eumolpus. The two exchange complaints about their misfortunes (83–84), and Eumolpus tells <b>how,</b> <b>when</b> he pursued {{an affair with a}} boy in Pergamon while employed as his tutor, the youth got the better of him (85–87). After talking about the decay of art and the inferiority of the painters and writers of the age to the old masters (88), Eumolpus illustrates a picture of the capture of Troy by some verses on that theme (89).|$|E

Blackborrow eventually proved his worth, earning the Bronze Polar Medal, and the honour of becoming the first human being ever to set foot on Elephant Island.

25|$|The concept {{goes back}} {{at least as far}} as Aristotle who, in Poetics, {{referred}} to narration and action as different modes or manner of representing something. For many years, fiction writing was described has having two types: narration and dialogue. Evan Marshall, in The Marshall Plan for Novel Writing (1998) noted that writers should know what they are doing at all times. He described what he called fiction-writing modes—the types of writing of which all fiction is made. He listed five modes: action, summary, dialogue, feelings/thoughts, and background, each with its own set of conventions regarding <b>how,</b> <b>when,</b> and where it should be used.|$|E
25|$|Later in the epic, Utnapishtim tells Gilgamesh {{the story}} of the Great Flood, which was sent by the god Enlil to annihilate all life on earth because the humans, who were vastly overpopulated, made too much noise and {{prevented}} him from sleeping. Utnapishtim tells <b>how,</b> <b>when</b> the flood came, Ishtar wept and mourned over the destruction of humanity, alongside the Anunnaki. Later, after the flood subsides, Utnapishtim makes an offering to the gods. Ishtar appears to Utnapishtim wearing a lapis lazuli necklace with beads shaped like flies and tells him that Enlil never discussed the flood with any of the other gods. She swears him that she will never allow Enlil to cause another flood and declares her lapis lazuli necklace a sign of her oath. Ishtar invites all the gods except for Enlil to gather around the offering and enjoy.|$|E
