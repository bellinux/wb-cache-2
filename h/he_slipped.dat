5|$|Among Scott's first acts as {{governor}} was appointing Jesse Bledsoe as Secretary of State. Bledsoe delivered Scott's first {{address to the}} legislature on December 13, 1808. Later that winter, Scott was injured when <b>he</b> <b>slipped</b> on the icy steps of the governor's mansion; the injury left him confined to crutches {{for the rest of}} his life and rendered him even more dependent on Bledsoe to perform many of his official functions. His physical condition continued to worsen throughout his term {{as governor}}.|$|E

5|$|Tom Pryce {{began his}} final race weekend, the 1977 South African Grand Prix at Kyalami, by setting the fastest {{time in the}} Wednesday {{practice}} session, held in wet weather. Pryce posted a time of 1 minute 31.57 seconds with the next best, the eventual 1977 World Champion Niki Lauda, a full second slower. The weather dried up prior to the Thursday session, and <b>he</b> <b>slipped</b> back down the grid to fifteenth place, almost two seconds slower than James Hunt's pole position time.|$|E
5|$|As a {{consequence}} of the race, Webber's third-place finish allowed him to increase his lead in the World Drivers' Championship. Alonso's victory allowed him to move up into second place, eleven points behind Webber. Hamilton's retirement meant that <b>he</b> <b>slipped</b> to third place, nine points behind Alonso. Vettel's second-place finish resulted in him moving into fourth place ahead of Button. In the World Constructors' Championship, Red Bull's strong finish allowed them to draw further ahead of McLaren who were now twenty-four points behind. Ferrari remained in third on 319 points, forty points behind McLaren. Mercedes increased their points advantage over Renault to thirty-five with four races remaining in the season.|$|E

5|$|Candaules {{depicts a}} scene from the first book of the Histories by Herodotus. Candaules, king of the ancient kingdom of Lydia, {{believed}} his wife Nyssia to be the world's most beautiful woman. He discussed his wife's beauty with his favourite bodyguard Gyges, but felt Gyges was lying when he told him that he agreed about her beauty. Candaules arranged, over the protests of Gyges, for Gyges to hide behind his bedroom door and secretly watch Nyssia undressing without her knowledge. Although he was unhappy at being forced to take part, Gyges reluctantly hid behind the door and watched Nyssia undress. Nyssia noticed Gyges as <b>he</b> <b>slipped</b> out of the room afterwards, but remained silent.|$|E
5|$|Offshore, a {{schooner}} carrying {{four people}} capsized in rough seas roughly 250mi (400km) east of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina on June30. The four crew were {{a father and}} his three kids. A diabetic, the 30-year-old father searched for his insulin pen in the capsized ship; however, for the fifteen days they were stranded, {{he was unable to}} find it. During the event, <b>he</b> <b>slipped</b> into a coma and later died on July4, leaving his kids on the boat. On July14, the three kids were rescued by the Ellinora, a Greek merchant ship.|$|E
5|$|The {{race was}} Alonso's second {{consecutive}} victory and his {{fourth of the}} 2010 season; he had started from pole position to win the Italian Grand Prix two weeks earlier. The win meant Alonso moved into {{second place in the}} World Drivers' Championship, eleven points behind leader Webber. Hamilton's retirement meant <b>he</b> <b>slipped</b> to third, while Vettel's second-place finish moved him into fourth ahead of Jenson Button. In the Constructors' Championship Red Bull extended its lead to twenty-four points ahead of McLaren. Ferrari was a further forty points behind, with four races remaining in the season.|$|E

With two races of the season remaining, Ferrari was a further twenty-five points adrift.|$|E
5|$|When old enough, Brunt was {{enrolled}} at Ellesmere College, where his mischievous streak became quickly apparent through pranks and dares; once, {{while in the}} sanatorium with mumps, <b>he</b> <b>slipped</b> a laxative into the matron's tea. Nevertheless, he is fondly remembered at the school. It was {{while he was at}} Ellesmere that he contracted measles, resulting in his need to wear glasses. An enthusiastic sportsman, Brunt played cricket, hockey, rugby, water polo and wrestling. He was the only pupil at the school to tackle the headmaster while playing rugby, injuring the older man's knee in the process.|$|E
5|$|Kessiakoff {{moved into}} his highest overall {{position}} after stage 12, occupying third overall just nine seconds behind the race leader. Kessiakoff at last cracked on stage 14, finishing 21st two minutes off the pace on La Farrapona. He had such time in {{hand over the}} bulk of the field, however, that <b>he</b> <b>slipped</b> only to sixth overall. Kessiakoff badly cracked in the next stage, losing almost 22 minutes and falling to 26th overall. Kiserlovski then became the team's top overall rider. He took ninth on stage 18 into Noja, part of a breakaway that took over seven minutes against the race's top riders. The result installed him into 16th place overall. He ended the Vuelta in 18th, as Astana's best-placed rider. Kessiakoff's final position was 34th, and Kashechkin was 89th.|$|E

5|$|Laffoon's early {{education}} was {{obtained in the}} public schools of Madisonville. While there, one of his teachers was his sister, Susan Isabella Laffoon, who was only 16 years old. At age 15, while plowing a field, Laffoon was kicked in the hip by a mule, requiring a six-week stay in a Nashville hospital. In the winter of the same year, <b>he</b> <b>slipped</b> on some ice and re-injured the hip. As a result of these injuries, his right leg was one-and-a-half inches shorter than his left leg, requiring him to wear special shoes and walk with a cane and a limp {{for the rest of his}} life. After his injury, Laffoon's parents decided that he could not make his living as a farmer and sent him to the private school of W. C. O'Bryan. By age 17, he was teaching in the common schools of Charleston in Hopkins County.|$|E
5|$|Waddington {{was less}} {{effective}} in 1923, and despite a good bowling average, he was inconsistent. In July, <b>he</b> <b>slipped</b> on wet grass {{when he was}} about to bowl against Leicestershire at Fartown Ground, Huddersfield; the subsequent shoulder injury effectively ended his season, apart from one match against Lancashire in which he bowled just six overs. In September, the injury required an operation to repair a torn ligament. The injury affected the remainder of his career and his bowling was never as effective. In total, before his injury, he took 65 wickets at 18.23 in 1923. That season, he recorded his best figures with the bat; after never having a first-class batting average better than 12 in an English season, he scored 317 runs at 24.38, including his first fifty in England.|$|E
5|$|As a player, Peel {{was very}} popular and admirers often entertained him socially; he became {{well known for}} liking alcohol. On {{the morning of the}} match that England won after {{following}} on, Peel was intoxicated and had to be sobered up. In 1897, he was suspended by Yorkshire for drunkenness during a match. Although it is unclear what exactly happened—Peel said <b>he</b> <b>slipped</b> when fielding, but Hirst later recalled that he came on the field drunk and when asked to leave, bowled a ball in the wrong direction—he never played for the county again. Decades later, a widely circulated story suggested that Peel urinated on the pitch before being sent away. Historians consider the story unlikely, and attribute it to a misunderstanding by its reporter. Peel continued to play and coach cricket {{for most of his life}} and in later years became associated with Yorkshire once again. Among his other jobs, he became the landlord of a public house and worked in a mill. He died in 1941 at the age of 84.|$|E

5|$|With his {{improved}} ranking (No. 37), Raonic earned direct {{entry to}} Grand Slam tournaments and other ATP World Tour events {{for the first}} time. He reached the third round at both the Indian Wells Masters and the Monte-Carlo Masters. In May, Raonic rose to a new career-high ranking of No. 25. He was seeded {{for the first time}} at a Grand Slam event at the French Open, but lost in the first round to Michael Berrer. At the Halle Open, Raonic reached his first ATP World Tour doubles final, partnered with Robin Haase. The pair lost to Rohan Bopanna and Aisam-ul-Haq Qureshi in the deciding super tiebreak. During his second round singles match at Wimbledon against Gilles Müller, Raonic retired with an early lead after injuring his right hip when <b>he</b> <b>slipped</b> and fell on the grass. He underwent hip surgery which prevented him from competing until September. His only significant result in the latter half of 2011 after returning from injury was a semifinal appearance at the Stockholm Open, where he lost to Gaël Monfils.|$|E
