25|$|Emil Abderhalden (March 9, 1877 – August 5, 1950) was a Swiss {{biochemist}} and physiologist. His main findings, though disputed {{already in}} the 1920s, were not finally rejected until the late 1990s. Whether his misleading findings were based on fraud or simply {{the result of a}} lack of scientific rigor remains unclear. Abderhalden's <b>drying</b> <b>pistol,</b> used in chemistry, was first described by one of his students in a textbook Abderhalden edited.|$|E
5000|$|Abderhalden's <b>drying</b> <b>pistol</b> is a {{piece of}} {{laboratory}} glassware used to free samples from traces of water, or other impurities. It is called a [...] "pistol" [...] because of its resemblance to the firearm. Its use has declined due to modern hotplate technology and vacuum pumps. The apparatus was first described in a book edited by Emil Abderhalden. The <b>drying</b> <b>pistol</b> allows the sample to be dried at elevated temperature; this is especially preferred when storage in a desiccator at room temperature does not give satisfactory results.|$|E

A Ruger-issued warning states that, due to the disconnector, <b>dry</b> firing the <b>pistol</b> without the magazine inserted will cause unnecessary wear to the striker block, but published firearms industry information notes that the SR9's disconnect can be deactivated simply by removing some of the disconnector linkage.|$|R
2500|$|In August 2016 the Indianapolis Metro Police Department (IMPD) started {{training}} with {{a batch of}} Glock 17M pistols. The most obvious difference with the Glock third and fourth-generation models on published images is the omission of finger grooves on the grip. The IMPD issued a Glock 17M voluntary recall following failures encountered while <b>dry</b> firing the <b>pistols</b> during training. According to Major Riddle with the IMPD; [...] "Glock is working to correct the problem {{and we hope to}} begin issuing the new [...] as soon as December".|$|R
50|$|The <b>drying</b> <b>pistol</b> {{consists}} of two concentric barrels; the inner is connected to a vacuum source via a trap. The outer barrel is connected at the bottom to a round bottom flask, and a condenser. To operate the <b>drying</b> <b>pistol,</b> a sample is placed within the inner barrel, and the barrel is evacuated. The round bottom flask, filled with an appropriate solvent, is heated to a boil. Hot vapors warm the inner barrel; losses are avoided with the condenser. By choosing the appropriate solvent, the temperature at which the sample is dried can be selected.|$|E
50|$|Desiccators are {{sometimes}} used to remove traces {{of water from}} an almost-dry sample. Where a desiccator alone is unsatisfactory, the sample may be dried at elevated temperature using Abderhalden's <b>drying</b> <b>pistol.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Drying of solids can {{be brought}} about by storing the solid over a drying agent such as {{phosphorus}} pentoxide (...) or silica gel, storing in a drying oven/vacuum-drying oven, heating under a high vacuum or in a <b>drying</b> <b>pistol,</b> or to remove trace amounts of water, simply storing the solid in a glove box that has a dry atmosphere.|$|E
50|$|The SR9 boasts {{multiple}} {{safety devices}} such an ambidextrous manual thumb safety and magazine release, a loaded chamber indicator, a visual and tactile cocked-striker indicator, and a firing pin block safety which prevents the pistol from firing {{if it is}} accidentally dropped. The SR9 also features a magazine disconnector.The Ruger SR9 can safely be dry fired with an empty magazine in the pistol. A Ruger-issued warning states that, due to the disconnector, <b>dry</b> firing the <b>pistol</b> without the magazine inserted will cause unnecessary wear to the striker block, but published firearms industry information notes that the SR9's disconnect can be deactivated simply by removing some of the disconnector linkage.|$|R

40|$|Conduritol B epoxide (CBE, ot,- 1, 2 -anhydro-myu-inositol, (8)) is an in-activating {{inhibitor}} {{of several}} D-glucosidases, particularly the mammalian enzyme which cleaves glucosylceramide. This enzyme is defective {{in the human}} genetic disorder Gaucher disease, and the ready availability of the inhibitor would enable investigators to study the disorder in animal models. The synthetic route to 8, based on the procedures of Angyal et al. ‘, Nakajima et aL 2, Nagabhushan”. Leglet’, and Radin and Vunnam”, utilized the readily available myo-inositol (1) as starting material. The need for larger amounts and less variable yields led us to study the steps in greater depth, by use of t. 1. c. and g. 1. c. in time studies. A somewhat improved, faster method is described, in which only two recrystallization steps are required. A design for a large Abderhalden <b>drying</b> <b>pistol</b> is described. The first step, glycol protection with cyclohexanone, utilized p-toluene-sulfonic acid as catalyst and benzene as the azeotroping medium. The reaction was made difficult by the low solubility of the reagents in the medium. The reaction proceded beyond the desired point, with formation of an uncertain amount of diacetals and triacetal which required ethanolysis to form the desired 1, 2 -monoacetal 2 * *. It was not clear from the literature how to minimize the formation of myo-inositol (1) by excessive ethanolysis. We replaced benzene with cyclo-hexane to minimize toxicity, ground myo-inositol (1) in situ with a motor-driven homogenizer to make the particle-size reduction more reproducible, and added dimethyl sulfoxide to increase the miscibility of the reagents. The reaction temper-ature was brought under control by empirically adjusting the volume of azeotroping agent to produce a reaction temperature of- 110 ” while maintaining rapid distilla-tion. This volume {{is a function of}} the volumes of the reactants and the glasswar...|$|E
