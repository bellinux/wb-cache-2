50|$|The wings were {{mounted on}} a low {{fuselage}} pylon, with the open cockpit immediately ahead of it. The 40-P's fuselage was oval in cross-section, tapering to the tail and entirely ply covered. There was a landing skid under the forward fuselage and the wing aided, by a tail bumper. As on the 41-P, the ply covered fixed fin and tailplane were very narrow, with generous, fabric covered control surfaces. Its tailplane was mounted {{on top of the}} fuselage and far enough forward that only a shallow reduction in <b>elevator</b> <b>chord</b> near the root was needed for movement of the rudder, which extended to the fuselage keel.|$|E
50|$|At {{the rear}} a tall, {{straight}} edged fin mounted a narrow rectangular balanced rudder {{and also the}} high aspect ratio, parallel chord tailplane, positioned about halfway up the fin {{to keep it out}} of the spray and braced with a single strut on each side {{to the top of the}} hull. It had separate, narrow <b>chord</b> <b>elevators.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The {{fuselage}} {{was constructed}} from spruce and ply box girders and was ply covered, with flat sides and bottom and a pitched top. The engine was mounted uncowled on a steel tube frame {{and the open}} single cockpit was half under the trailing edge, allowing clear views {{above and below the}} wing. Its empenange was conventional and of similar construction to the wing; the tailplane was [...] mounted at mid-fuselage and had a plan {{similar to that of the}} wing, with full span, narrow <b>chord</b> <b>elevators</b> controlled by rods. The vertical fin was quadrant shaped and carried a cable controlled semi-circular rudder that extended down as far as the tailplane.|$|R
50|$|The Anfibio Varese had a caulked plywood covered, {{hexagonal}} section fuselage {{with an open}} cockpit immediately {{ahead of}} the wing pedestal. The fuselage tapered slightly rearwards to the tail, where the rectangular tailplane was mounted on top, supported by a single small strut on each side, and carried constant <b>chord</b> <b>elevators.</b> The fin was small but the balanced rudder was tall and somewhat pointed; it extended down to the keel and moved in an elevator cut-out. The fuselage underside was formed into a single step hull, though {{there was also a}} standard glider skid, running from just aft of the nose via the step to aft of mid-chord, assisted by a very small tail skid for land operations.|$|R
50|$|Its {{fuselage}} was a semi-monocoque structure, elliptical {{in cross-section}} and tapering uniformly towards the tail. The fin and rudder together were trapezoidal, with a T tail and <b>elevator</b> of constant <b>chord</b> within tapered tips. Lacking the more usual wing mounted airbrakes, the BJ-2 {{had a pair}} of petal type, fuselage mounted brakes for glide angle control just aft of the wing. It also had two cruciform braking parachutes deployable from the lower rear fuselage below the rudder. Forward of the wing the upper fuselage line blended smoothly into that of the single piece, sideways opening canopy to limit dive speeds. The undercarriage combined a retractable monowheel, fitted with a brake, and a co-retracting forward skid. The nose was of glass reinforced plastic.|$|R
2500|$|Like some Zöglings, the Hols der Teufel had a light nacelle, ending {{under the}} wing at a forward leaning {{vertical}} knife edge around the aft central wing strut, enclosing both the pilot's seat {{and the other}} supporting struts. [...] Aft, the cross braced girder had a horizontal upper beam onto which the tailplane was mounted, strut braced from below. Its leading edge was straight and strongly swept; the cropped, parallel <b>chord</b> <b>elevators</b> had a central cut out for rudder movement. The fin was under the tailplane, formed by fabric covering between the last two vertical fuselage fames. Its upright, near rectangular rudder was hinged on the extended, final vertical frame member. The Hols der Teufel landed on a rubber sprung skid which ran from the nose to a little beyond the aft lift struts.|$|R
50|$|Its flat-sided {{fuselage}} was dural framed, {{with all}} sides covered in corrugated dural sheet. The upper- and undersides had rounded deckings. The nose was semi-cylindrical in plan and contained an open cockpit for the navigator, who was {{provided with a}} flexibly mounted pair of machine guns. The pilot was also in an open cockpit, which was built into the wing leading edge; the rear gunner/observer's position was a little behind the trailing edge, equipped with another pair of flexibly mounted guns. Its floor had an opening into which a reconnaissance camera could be fitted. The gunner also had access to a ventral gun position. Behind him the fuselage tapered slightly to a conventional, cantilever tail with its triangular tailplane mounted on top and carrying narrow <b>chord</b> <b>elevators.</b> The fin was also triangular, with a tall, trapezoidal rudder which extended to the keel.|$|R
2500|$|The {{smoothly}} faired and contoured short fuselage of the DDr.I positioned {{the open}} pilot's cockpit between two [...] Siemens-Halske Sh.I nine cylinder rotary engines, {{one with a}} two blade tractor propeller and the other driving a four blade pusher turning just aft of the lower wing trailing edge. [...] The empennage was mounted on four longitudinal, tubular outrigger beams, braced with vertical and transverse members. [...] There were no fixed rear surfaces; the single piece, constant <b>chord</b> <b>elevator</b> reached between the two upper beams {{and a pair of}} similarly shaped rudder went from the upper to the lower beams, hinged further aft than the elevator but with their lower ends on a hinged frame that moved with it. The DDr.I had a fixed conventional undercarriage, with its mainwheels on a single axle mounted on wide spread V-struts attached to the lower fuselage at the lower corner points of each engine's firewall.|$|R
50|$|The Poppenhausen had a light nacelle {{fuselage}} extending {{well behind}} the wing trailing edge and ending at a forward leaning vertical knife edge.The forward cockpit was largely {{ahead of the}} leading edge and the rear one under the wing. Behind the wing the fuselage had the same flat, cross braced girder form as the Hols der Teufel, with a horizontal upper beam, its first diagonal brace within the nacelle. The tailplane was mounted {{on top of the}} horizontal beam, its leading edge straight and strongly swept. Cropped, parallel <b>chord</b> <b>elevators</b> had a central cut out for rudder movement. The fin was under the tailplane, formed by fabric covering between the last two vertical fuselage fames. Its upright, balanced, near rectangular rudder was hinged on the extended, final vertical frame member. The Poppenhausen landed on a rubber sprung skid which ran from the nose to a little beyond the aft lift struts.|$|R
50|$|The Biposto Roma's {{fuselage}} was a wooden, rectangular {{cross section}} structure, skinned with plywood. Its two cockpits, both open and unscreened, were in tandem. If the aircraft was flown solo it was piloted from the font seat; the occupation or otherwise {{of the rear}} cockpit left the trim little changed as {{it was on the}} c.g. Under the fuselage a rubber sprung wooden landing skid ran from forward of the cockpits to well aft of the wing trailing edge. The tailplane was triangular, mounted on top of a short, trapezoidal fin and braced {{to the top of the}} fuselage. Its <b>elevators</b> had parallel <b>chord</b> and a central cut-out for the rudder, as this, hinged on the fin's trailing edge, was about twice as high as the tailplane. The rudder was straight edged and reached down to the keel; above the tailplane, it had an aerodynamic balance on its upper leading edge.|$|R

2500|$|The M.1 was {{powered by}} a [...] le Rhône 9C nine {{cylinder}} rotary engine, fitted with a two blade propeller and an unusually large domed spinner which left only a small gap for cooling air {{between it and the}} almost complete cylindrical engine enclosure. [...] Behind the engine the fuselage was flat sided, with a curved upper decking. [...] The open single cockpit was at the wing trailing edge, and there were cut-outs in both planes to improve the pilot's view. [...] The fuselage tapered aft where the horizontal tail was mounted on top of the fuselage; the original tail surfaces were very small and without a fixed fin. [...] Later versions had an enlarged straight edged tailplane and split pair of angle tipped <b>elevators,</b> a wide <b>chord</b> fin and enlarged rudder. [...] The M.1 had a fixed conventional undercarriage, with mainwheels on a single axle mounted on a pair of V-struts from the lower fuselage longerons and wire cross braced. The only armament was a single Lewis gun, mounted well above the upper wing surface.|$|R

2500|$|The {{fuselage}} was {{a rectangular}} plywood covered structure, slender in plan. [...] A 28hp (21kW) Aero Engines Sprite, an air-cooled [...] flat twin engine, was mounted on steel bearers and well streamlined. The single cockpit {{was over the}} wing, with a baggage compartment aft. [...] The Dove was offered with an enclosed Coupé cockpit cover. [...] The tail unit was built of fabric covered wood. [...] Both horizontal and vertical surfaces were heavily revised for the third aircraft, though on all three, all control surfaces were horn balanced. [...] The early machines had tailplanes which were strut braced {{to the top of}} the fin, with a straight leading edge of modest sweep and carrying generous, curved elevators. [...] The fin was sharply triangular, but the rudder extended the leading edge line, was curved at the rear and ended above the elevators. [...] On the third Dove the bracing was abandoned, the leading edge sweep increased and the <b>elevators</b> decreased in <b>chord</b> and made straight edged. [...] Its vertical surfaces were altered to produce a more conventional shape, the rudder projecting less above the fin but continuing downwards between the elevators to the fuselage bottom.|$|R

50|$|The forward {{fuselage}} frame consisted of two, parallel horizontal members, one above the other. They were {{connected by a}} vertical pair of members and two diagonal ones, attached at two points on the lower frame and three on the upper. The rear vertical member was lighter than the forward three uprights, which formed a distorted N; together with the parallel horizontals, this core frame formed a cross braced trapezium. The forward vertical supported the wing at its front spar and the two diagonals met on the rear one. The lower frame extended forwards, with the pilot's seat projecting either side of it immediately ahead of the forward vertical frame. Underneath it, a curved skid was mounted and faired in, forming a long, deep, narrow box, reaching aft to the rear vertical frame. From the trailing edge rearwards the upper frame member was split into two, running {{parallel to each other}} and cross braced in the horizontal plane. This provided extra stiffness against sideways flexing and further reduced the wire bracing. Aft of the second vertical member the lower frame sloped upwards, meeting the upper member at the tail. Here, the triangular tailplane was mounted on the upper frame with a trapezoidal fin below. Parallel <b>chord</b> <b>elevators</b> projected behind with a cut-out for the movement of the tall rudder, which was hinged on the extreme frame and was rectangular apart from a cropped under edge. The BS.16 sat with its tail well clear of the ground, so no tail bumper was required, though there was a short aft horizontal extension of the main skid.|$|R
