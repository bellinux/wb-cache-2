40|$|Abstract. In this paper, which {{presents}} a simplified behavioral finance model, we incorporate regret into {{the decision-making process}} of a pension fund and derive the optimal asset allocation of a final-wealth-maximizing pension fund in the accumulation and <b>decumulation</b> <b>phases.</b> We find that the optimal allocation must be congruent in both phases {{if and only if}} the pension fund is upside regret averse. In particular, our results suggest that allocation to risky assets must increase through time in the accumulation and <b>decumulation</b> <b>phases</b> so that the pension fund can realize gains from any upsides in the risky asset market, thereby maximizing final wealth and limiting the feeling of regret ex-post. Although decisions in both phases are congruent, we find that the optimal asset allocation generally depends on wealth levels. This evidence implies that separate management of the accumulation and <b>decumulation</b> <b>phases</b> of a pension fund decreases available wealth levels and is not an optimal strategy. Keywords.

Particular emphasis {{is devoted to}} longevity risk, i. e. the risk arising from uncertainty in future mortality trends. This risk must be faced by insurance companies and pension plans that have guaranteed lifelong payoffs. Solvency is investigated referring to immediate annuities, and hence the so-called <b>decumulation</b> <b>phase</b> is addressed. To assess solvency, assets are compared with the random present value of liabilities. Several requirements are considered, each leading to a required asset level that must be financed both with premiums (or contributions) and capital allocation. ...|$|E

40|$|Focusing on a “safe {{withdrawal}} rate” {{and then}} deriving a “wealth accumulation target” to achieve by the retirement date {{is the wrong}} way to think about retirement planning. Such a formulation isolates the working (accumulation) and retirement (<b>decumulation)</b> <b>phases.</b> When considered together, the lowest sustainable withdrawal rates (which give us our idea of the safe withdrawal rate) tend to follow prolonged bull markets, while the highest sustainable withdrawal rates tend to follow prolonged bear markets. The focus of retirement planning should be on the savings rate rather than the withdrawal rate. The “safe savings rate” may be based on historical simulations as the savings rate which proves sufficient to support the desired retirement expenditures from a lifecycle perspective including both the accumulation and <b>decumulation</b> <b>phases.</b> Safe savings rates derived in this manner are less volatile than withdrawal rates and imply a lower ex-post cost to having been overly conservative. Unlike the 4 percent rule, there is not a universal "safe savings rate," but guidelines can be created. Starting to save early and consistently for retirement at a reasonable savings rate will provide the best chance to meet retirement expenditure goals. Actual withdrawal rates and wealth accumulations at retirement may be treated as almost an afterthought in this framework. But the savings plan should be adhered to regardless of whether it seems one is accumulating either more or less wealth than is needed based on traditional criteria. ...|$|R

40|$|Most {{literature}} about retirement planning treats the working (accumulation) and retirement (<b>decumulation)</b> <b>phases</b> separately. The traditional approach decides on safe withdrawal rate, {{uses it to}} derive a wealth accumulation target, and then calculates the savings rate required to achieve this wealth target. Because low sustainable withdrawal rates tend to occur after bull markets, such a formulation will push individuals toward unnecessarily high savings rates to attain their desired retirement spending goals, reducing their feasible lifestyle prior to retirement. By jointly considering both phases of retirement planning, this study provides savings rate guidelines for individuals in 25 emerging market countries. The savings rates calculated here are those which provide an adequate success rate in financing desired retirement expenditures using bootstrapped Monte Carlo simulations. For many emerging market countries, these savings rates will be high, given the high volatility of returns for savings instruments and the inflationary environment. Starting to save early and using a relatively low stock allocation, a finding that contrasts with studies about the United States, provide the lowest necessary savings rate for a given probability of success. ...|$|R

40|$|Most {{countries}} that reform their pension systems {{focus more on}} the accumulation phase and pay less attention to the <b>decumulation</b> <b>phase.</b> This is because the number of beneficiaries is initially likely to be very small, especially if older workers are discouraged from joining the new system. Policymakers place priority on the need to ensure that the new system is administratively efficient and well regulated. But for a successful new pension system the <b>decumulation</b> <b>phase</b> must also be well organized and efficient. The primary purpose of pension systems is to pay retirement benefits [...] -old age, survivor and disability pensions. This paper argues that (1) pay-out arrangements are likely to evolve gradually, through a trial and error process, as problems are discovered and tackled; (2) adverse selection may not be as great a problem as is sometimes thought; but (3) many other annuity and insurance market problems remain to be solved and policies must be formulated to make these markets work well. The paper argues that the underdevelopment of voluntary annuity markets is only partly explained by adverse selection. It is also due to a number of other factors: the bequest and precautionary motives for saving; ignorance and myopia by individuals; mistrust of insurance companies; the "luxury good" nature of annuities; tax policies that favor lump sum withdrawals; and, last but by no means least, public policies (such as the offer of social security pensions and the encouragement of occupational pension plans) that tend to crowd out individual annuities.

The required pension fund is decided by the pension fund target, measured using the income replacement ratio. We consider four assets in the asset allocation and observe four types of changes to the rebalancing investment strategies.

40|$|The present {{article focuses}} on issues related to asset decumulation. In {{discussing}} these issues, a key proposition is that financial institutions are most {{willing and able to}} offer decumulation products with fixed payment promises to the extent they are able to invest in financial assets that allow them to hedge a considerable part of the risks associated with the payment promises they extend. Indeed, what is sometimes overlooked in discussions bout shifts from asset accumulation to decumulation is that the <b>decumulation</b> <b>phase</b> also involves investment challenges, especially if specific patterns of payouts such as regular payouts of fixed amounts are aimed at. Many writers have argued for some time now that pension fund managers will have difficulty implementing asset-liability matching because there are insufficient quantities of suitable assets. As it turns out, the shortfall in hedging instruments extends to more than just the “toxic” tail of longevity risk, as is commonly being argued. The analysis in this article shows that hedging interest rate risk is also not as straightforward as one may think. ...|$|E

The plan’s optimal funding and investment strategies therefore depend on the desired profile of consumption over the lifetime of the member. We investigate these strategies under the assumption that the member is a rational life cycle financial planner and has an Epstein-Zin utility function, which allows a separation between risk aversion and the elasticity of intertemporal substitution. We also take into account the member’s human capital during the accumulation phase of the plan and we allow the annuitisation decision to be endogenously determined during the <b>decumulation</b> <b>phase.</b> We show that the optimal funding strategy involves a contribution rate that is not constant over the life of the plan but is age-dependent and reflects the trade-off between the desire for current versus future consumption, the desire for stable consumption over time, the member’s attitude to risk, and changes in the level of human capital over the life cycle.

40|$|Decumulation in the {{retirement}} income context is the using up of retirement savings {{by way of}} drawing out regular income – for example, a fixed amount each month. It’s the converse of accumulating retirement savings while in paid work by regularly putting money aside. And return on investment plays its part in both: in the accumulation phase it enhances the amount saved; in the <b>decumulation</b> <b>phase</b> it enhances the regular amount that can be paid out.

40|$|In this paper, {{we develop}} an {{expected}} utility {{model for the}} retirement behavior in the <b>decumulation</b> <b>phase</b> of Australian retirees with sequential family status subject to consumption, housing, investment, bequest and government provided means-tested Age Pension. We account for mortality risk and risky investment assets, and introduce a health proxy to capture the decreasing level of consumption for older retirees. Then we find optimal housing at retirement, and optimal consumption and optimal risky asset allocation depending on age and wealth. The model is solved numerically as a stochastic control problem, and is calibrated using the maximum likelihood method on empirical data of consumption and housing from the Australian Bureau of Statistics 2009 - 2010 Survey. The model fits {{the characteristics of the}} data well to explain the behavior of Australian retirees. The key findings are the following: First, the optimal policy is highly sensitive to means-tested Age Pension early in retirement but this sensitivity fades with age. Secondly, the allocation to risky assets shows a complex relationship with the means-tested Age Pension that disappears once minimum withdrawal rules are enforced. As a general rule, when wealth decreases the proportion allocated to risky assets increases, due to the Age Pension working as a buffer against investment losses. Finally, couples can be more aggressive with risky allocations due to their longer life expectancy compared with singles. Comment: 28 pages, 7 figure...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a {{constrained}} investment problem for a defined contribution (DC) pension fund where retirees are allowed to defer {{the purchase of the}} annuity at some future time after retirement. This problem has already been treated in the unconstrained case in a number of papers. The aim of this work is to deal with the more realistic case when constraints on the investment strategies and on the state variable are present. Due to the difficulty of the task, we consider, as a first step, the basic model of Gerrard, Haberman and Vigna (2004), where interim consumption and annuitization time are fixed. We extend their model by adding a no short-selling constraint on the control variable and a final capital requirement constraint on the state variable. This implies, in particular, no ruin. The mathematical problem is naturally formulated as a stochastic control problem with constraints on the control and the state variable, and is approached by the dynamic programming method. We write the non-linear Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation for the problem and transform it into a dual one that is semi-linear, following a well-established duality procedure. In the special relevant case without running cost, we explicitly compute the value function for the problem and give the optimal strategy in feedback form.

40|$|We explore four issues {{concerning}} annuitization options that retirees might {{use in the}} <b>decumulation</b> <b>phase</b> of an "individual accounts" retirement saving system. First, we investigate the operation of both real and nominal annuity individual annuity markets in the United Kingdom. The widespread availability of real annuities in the U. K. dispels the argument that private insurance markets could not, or would not, provide real annuities to retirees. Second, we consider the current structure of two inflation-linked insurance products available in the United States, only one of which proves {{to be a real}} annuity. Third, we evaluate the potential of assets such as stocks, bonds, and bills, to provide retiree protection from inflation. Because equity real returns have been high over the last seven decades, a retiree who received income linked to equity returns would have fared very well on average. Nevertheless we cast doubt on the "inflation insurance" aspect of equity, since this is mainly due to stocks' high average return, and not because stock returns move in tandem with inflation. Finally, we use a simulation model to assess potential retiree willingness to pay for real, nominal, and variable payout equity-linked annuities. For plausible degrees of risk aversion, inflation protection appears to have only modest value. People would be expected to value a variable payout equity-linked annuity more highly than a real annuity because the additional real returns associated with common stocks more than compensate for the volatility of prospective payouts. These finding are germane to concerns raised in connection with Social Security reform plans that include individual accounts. ...|$|E

We define and study the problem at two different complexity levels. In the first level (problem P 1), we only require no short-selling.
