5|$|Auburn {{head coach}} Tommy Tuberville {{was named the}} Associated Press Coach of the Year on December 24, <b>due</b> <b>in</b> <b>large</b> <b>part</b> <b>to</b> his success in using Auburn's new West Coast offense to drive the Tigers to an undefeated 12–0 regular season. In {{response}} to his success, Auburn administrators agreed to a seven-year, $16million contract extension with Tuberville prior to the Sugar Bowl. Tuberville planned an offense that finished the regular season averaging 33.4points and 430.8yards of total offense per game.|$|E

50|$|Representative Lindsey Graham had no {{challenge}} for the Republican nomination and thus avoided a primary election. This was <b>due</b> <b>in</b> <b>large</b> <b>part</b> because the South Carolina Republicans were preoccupied with the gubernatorial race and also because potential rivals were deterred by the huge financial war chest Graham had amassed early in the campaign.|$|R

5|$|Erected at {{the behest}} of the Illinois General Assembly, the University of Illinois Observatory became {{important}} in the development of astronomy <b>due,</b> <b>in</b> <b>large</b> <b>part,</b> <b>to</b> pioneering research by Dr. Stebbins, from 1907 to 1922. Joel Stebbins left the University of Illinois in 1922 but left behind a legacy of discovery that helped alter the face of modern astronomy. The building served the University of Illinois astronomy department from its opening until 1979, when the department moved into a new, larger building to house its growing staff.|$|E
5|$|Owen's {{argument}} that the Federal Reserve's deflationary stance was largely responsible for causing the Great Depression {{would have been considered}} unorthodox at the time he made it. In more recent decades, however, such a view has come to be widely accepted, <b>due</b> <b>in</b> <b>large</b> <b>part</b> <b>to</b> the influence of the 1963 study A Monetary History of the United States by Milton Friedman and Anna J.

5|$|The {{potential}} political {{threat to}} Apollo blew over, <b>due</b> <b>in</b> <b>large</b> <b>part</b> <b>to</b> {{the support of}} President Lyndon B.

5|$|Beginning in the 1780s, a {{large number}} of {{prominent}} Americans called {{for the establishment of a}} central mint to supply the United States with official coinage; all such proposals failed <b>due</b> <b>in</b> <b>large</b> <b>part</b> <b>to</b> lack of funds and opposition from individuals and groups who preferred that coins be struck by the individual states. Since there were no federal coins issued, the needs of the states were fulfilled by a variety of domestic and foreign coins and tokens, including Spanish eight-real coins (popularly known as Spanish dollars or pieces of eight).|$|E
5|$|By 1920, <b>due</b> <b>in</b> <b>large</b> <b>part</b> <b>to</b> the city's {{economic}} prosperity, Cleveland {{became the}} nation's fifth largest city. The city counted Progressive Era politicians {{such as the}} populist Mayor Tom L. Johnson among its leaders. In commemoration of the centennial of Cleveland's incorporation as a city, the Great Lakes Exposition debuted in June 1936 along the Lake Erie shore north of downtown. Conceived {{as a way to}} energize a city after the Great Depression, it drew four million visitors in its first season, and seven million by the end of its second and final season in September 1937. The exposition was housed on grounds that are now used by the Great Lakes Science Center, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Burke Lakefront Airport, among others.|$|E

50|$|While {{cellulosic}} biomass like corn stover and switchgrass is abundant and cheap, {{it is much}} more difficult to utilize than corn and sugar cane. This is <b>due</b> <b>in</b> <b>large</b> <b>part</b> because of recalcitrance, or a plant's natural defenses to being chemically dismantled. Adding to the complexity is the fact biofuel production that involves several steps—pretreatment, enzyme treatment and fermentation—is more costly than a method that combines biomass utilization and the fermentation of sugars to biofuel into a single process.|$|R
5000|$|Population {{increase}} was common throughout Europe in the 13th century, but in Wales {{it was more}} pronounced. By Llywelyn II's reign as much as 10 per cent of the population were town-dwellers. Additionally, [...] "unfree slaves... had long disappeared" [...] from within Pura Wallia <b>due</b> <b>in</b> <b>large</b> <b>part</b> form the social upheavals of the 11th century," [...] argued Davies.

5|$|Despite {{the failure}} to deliver a winning season, Vanderlinden did oversee {{substantive}} improvement in the program. In 1998, the Terrapins {{were one of the}} most improved teams in defense, scoring defense, passing defense, and rushing. In 1999, Maryland allowed a conference low of 11 sacks compared with 56 in 1997. In that same period, Maryland also improved from last to first in the conference in rushing, <b>due</b> <b>in</b> <b>large</b> <b>part</b> <b>to</b> Heisman Trophy candidate and school career rushing leader LaMont Jordan. During Vanderlinden's tenure, Maryland also recruited several key players who were instrumental in the team's later success.|$|E
5|$|Dick Harp was in {{the midst}} of his first season as head coach of the Kansas Jayhawks as the team entered the National Championship game. Kansas came into the season favored to win the {{national}} title. This was <b>due</b> <b>in</b> <b>large</b> <b>part</b> <b>to</b> Wilt Chamberlain joining the varsity team after finishing his freshman year on the freshman team per NCAA rules. At the beginning of the season, the Jayhawks starting line up consisted of Seniors Gene Elstun, Maurice King, John Parker, Lew Johnson, and Sophomore Chamberlain. Ron Loneski replaced Johnson's spot in the starting line up during the season. Harp began the season with a man to man defense, but later switched to a zone in order to give them an advantage in rebounding the basketball.|$|E

5|$|Many of {{the rural}} ranchers and Cowboys resented the growing {{influence}} of the city residents over county politics and law enforcement. The ranchers largely maintained {{control of the country}} outside Tombstone, <b>due</b> <b>in</b> <b>large</b> <b>part</b> <b>to</b> the sympathetic support of Cochise County Sheriff Johnny Behan, who favored the Cowboys and rural ranchers, and who also grew to intensely dislike the Earps. Behan tended to ignore the Earps' complaints about the McLaurys' and Clantons' horse thieving and cattle rustling. The Earps were known to bend the law in their favor when it affected their gambling and saloon interests, which earned them further enmity with the Cowboy faction.|$|E
5|$|The {{music that}} would {{ultimately}} become the Hybrid Theory album was first produced by Linkin Park in 1999 as a nine-track demo tape. The band sent this tape to various recording companies and played forty-two different showcases for recording industry representatives, including performances for Los Angeles promoter and impresario, Mike Galaxy's showcase at The Gig on Melrose. However, they were initially {{turned down by}} most of the major labels and several independent record labels. The band was signed by Warner Bros.

These guns remained on the battleships Iowa, Missouri, and Wisconsin {{from the time they}} were commissioned until they were reactivated for service in the 1980s. As each battleship arrived for modernization during the early and mid-1980s the Bofors mounts that remained aboard were removed <b>due</b> <b>in</b> <b>large</b> <b>part</b> <b>to</b> the ineffectiveness of such manually aimed weapons against modern day jet fighters and enemy missiles.

Three weeks later, on 1 July, the battleship and her escorts sailed once more for Japanese home waters for carrier air strikes on the enemy's heartland. Nine days later, carrier planes from TF 38 destroyed 72 enemy aircraft {{on the ground}} and smashed industrial sites in the Tokyo area.

As early as 53 BC, the Roman general Crassus had invaded Parthia, but he was killed and his army was defeated at the Battle of Carrhae. In the years following Carrhae, the Romans were divided in civil war and hence unable to campaign against Parthia. Trajan also campaigned against the Parthians from 114–117 AD and briefly captured their capital Ctesiphon, putting the puppet ruler Parthamaspates on the throne. However, rebellions in Babylonia and the Jewish revolts in Judea {{made it difficult to}} maintain the captured province and the territories were abandoned.|$|E

Corn was the main crop at first but drought and grasshopper plagues severely hurt the crops. When hardy Winter wheat was introduced to Kansas by Russian settlers, it eventually became the predominant crop in Smith County.
