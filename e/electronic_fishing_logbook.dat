40|$|International audienceThe European Research project " Catch, Effort, and eCOsystem {{impacts of}} FAD-fishing " (CECOFAD) {{set out to}} improve our {{understanding}} of the use of drifting fish-aggregating devices (DFADs) in tropical purse seine tuna fisheries in open ocean ecosystems. Data from unofficial technology information related to FAD-fishing were retrieved and the changes over time in systems used for positioning buoys at-sea (radio, satellite transmitters, echo sounder buoys) were quantified. The total number of DFADs deployed at sea in the Atlantic and Indian oceans over the last ten years was estimated from 2 different approaches, based on information provided by the French tuna association and extrapolated to the other purse seiner fleets. From data collected within the FAD National Management Plan, the relationship between the number of active DFADs and the catch per Spanish purse seiner (with or without the assistance of a supply vessel), was explored. Owing to the difficulty of gathering unofficial information, the standardization of CPUE was limited to juvenile bigeye caught using DFADs and to non-standard explanatory variables provided by the French fleet. The analysis was repeated for the combined French and Spanish fleets but with a smaller number of predictors because data for the Spanish fleet was missing. However the relevance of some non-traditional factors was highlighted, in particular the needs to collate the links between each supply vessel and its associated purse seiners and the number of active DFADs per vessel. As an alternative to CPUE, direct indices of tuna abundance through the use of echo sounder buoys attached to DFADs in the Spanish fleet were investigated. Due to the heterogeneity of echo sounder buoy information several criteria for cleaning datasets before performing an " alternate " Buoy-derived Abundance Index (BAI) were identified. Nominal measurements were then standardized using a GLMM approach. Behavioral models representing the continuous process of association and disassociation under FADs, were also identified as an alternative to commercial catch data for estimating abundance. Information collected by national FAD management plans was used to explore the rate of deployment of non-entangling DFADs and the apparent survival rate of released species of incidental catch. Time-area moratoria on DFADs, introduced regularly by tuna RFMOs, are limited to the protection of juvenile tuna and do not account for the potential impact on bycatch or associated megafauna (whales and whale sharks). A simple iterative " fishing-day " model, which included realistic scenarios in terms of difference in fishing strategies between the French and Spanish fleets, was developed to investigate the consequences on tropical tuna and bycatch of introducing wide area, six-month moratoria on DFAD sets. The simulations predicted a decrease in DFAD sets and an increase in free school sets, leading to an overall decrease in tuna catch of ~ 100 t/yr/boat in the Atlantic Ocean and 600 – 1800 t/yr/boat in the Indian Ocean. The bycatch for all groups considered (other bony fishes, billfishes, sharks and turtles) decreased, except for turtle and shark in the Atlantic Ocean. Because the fishing practices were modified, whale and whale shark associated sets increased slightly in the Indian Ocean. French GPS buoy trajectories were analyzed to detect the potential damage of lost DFADs on vulnerable coastal ecosystems. This showed that, for the period 2007 - 2013, around 10 % of the trajectories of floating objects with GPS-buoys ended with a “beaching event” in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans, with significant portions of these beaching events occurring in areas with sensitive habitats, such as coral reefs. Bycatch data collected under the EU observer programs in the Indian, Pacific and the Atlantic Oceans, was used to evaluate the effect of FAD-fishing in terms of diversity. Regional differences were identified but the species diversity associated with the DFADs was found to be richer than for free school sets. One of the tasks of CECOFAD was to provide bridges between the various databases used in the project. The French versions of the Balbaya (logbooks) and ObsTuna (observer data) databases were linked using the Standard Data-Exchange Format used within the EU Data Collection Framework (DCF). This format allows a data aggregation level while respecting data confidentiality issues and should be considered as a good candidate for the exchange of data within the tropical tuna research community. Owing to the lack or imprecision of DFAD-fishing activity data, the definitions of variables required for evaluating DFAD-fishing activities that should be continuously recorded in logbooks were reviewed. On the basis on the most recent recommendations from tRFMOs the <b>electronic</b> <b>fishing</b> <b>logbook</b> data model (ERS) was extended to floating objects with the aim to incorporate the information required for measuring the DFAD-fishing effort and to produce indicators of the effect on the ecosystem of deploying floating objects.

40|$|Abstract Commercial <b>fishing</b> <b>logbook</b> {{data from}} the Shark Bay managed prawn fishery in Western Australia provide king prawn catch rate data densely {{informed}} and irregularly spaced in both the spatial and temporal domains. Space–time geo-statistical analysis for the {{data from the}} 2001 to 2004 fishing seasons has shown that short term catch rate prediction is possible {{with the use of the}} product-sum covari-ance model and the subsequent kriging estimation process. However the operation of closure lines within the fishery makes it difficult to capture the high catch rate be-haviour in areas as they first open to trawling. One of these regions is the Extended Nursery Area which usually opens in the first week of May. Analysis of the survey trawls from seasons 2001 to 2003 in this region in March and April shows there is a moderate positive correlation between the actual catch rate and the survey catch rate. By using the survey catch rate data as additional data in space–time geostatisti-cal estimation of the catch rates for May 2004, the space–time behaviour of the king prawn catch rate data is more successfully captured. ...|$|R

Fishing effort {{was measured by the}} detection of boat lights by the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) Operational Linescan System (OLS). Visual confirmation of fishing vessels by nocturnal aerial surveys indicated that lights detected by satellites are reliable indicators of fishing effort. Overall, fishing activity was concentrated off the following Channel Islands: Santa Rosa, Santa Cruz, Anacapa, and Santa Catalina. Fishing activity occurred at depths of 100 m or less. Landings, effort, and squid abundance (measured as landings per unit of effort, LPUE) markedly declined during the 1997 − 98 El Niño; landings and LPUE increased afterwards. Within a fishing season, the location of fishing activity shifted from the northern shores of Santa Rosa and Santa Cruz Islands in October, the typical starting date for squid fishing in the Bight, to the southern shores by March, the typical end of the squid season.

40|$|Abstract OnlyTwo major {{institutional}} revolutions are impacting fisheries {{around the}} globe [...] sustainability and property rights. The sustainability revolution ensures that fisheries and supporting ecosystems are conserved so that future generations can access healthy fishery resources. The second revolution creates institutions {{in the form of}} economic incentives and privileges that are necessary for achieving sustainability. But a third less heralded fishery revolution is gaining recognition for its role in supporting the first two revolutions‚ (near) real time information systems.

40|$|Recreational {{fisheries}} can be {{prone to}} severe declines, yet these fisheries, particularly catch-and-release, are often data-limited, constraining our ability to conduct stock assessments. A combination of catch and effort indices derived from fisheries-dependent data (FDD) gathered from <b>fishing</b> <b>logbooks</b> could be a powerful approach to inform these data gaps. This study demonstrates the utility of using different catch metrics such as indices of abundance, species richness associated with reported catch, and the success rate of targeted trips, to assess historical shifts in the trajectory of the data-limited bonefish (Albula vulpes) fishery in Florida Bay, an economically-important recreational fishery within the Caribbean Basin. We used FDD from fishing guide reports submitted to Everglades National Park to determine temporal patterns in the bonefish population over the past 35 years. These reports indicated a decline in recreational catches in Florida Bay since the late 1980 s, with an accelerated decline starting in the late 1990 s-early 2000 s. Analyses showed an overall 42 % reduction in bonefish catches. Trends {{in the proportion of}} positive trips (i. e., the probability of catching success) followed the declining catch patterns, suggesting major population changes starting in 1999 - 2000. As bonefish catches declined, species richness in bonefish trips increased by 34 %, suggesting a decrease in bonefish abundance and/or shift in fishing effort (e. g., giving-up time, changes in preferred species). Results provide additional resolution to a pattern of decline for bonefish in South Florida and highlight the value of reconstructing time-series for the development of hypotheses about the potential driving mechanisms of species decline. Further, the data-limited nature of most recreational fisheries, and the increase in a use of catch-and-release as a fisheries management strategy point to the need to develop further data integration tools to assess population trends and the sustainability of these fishery resources...|$|R

40|$|The {{sociology}} and habits of recreational anglers on the Island of Majorca (western Mediterranean) were evaluated using telephone and on-site surveys, {{as well as}} <b>fishing</b> <b>logbooks</b> and recreational <b>fishing</b> competitions. The recreational fishery {{is one of the}} island's main leisure activities, 5. 14 % of the population (37 265 people) participating. Enthusiasts tend to be mainly middle class (most anglers own boats moored at marinas), middle-aged males (90 % male, mean age 46 ± 2 years). The most popular fishing method is from a boat (62. 9 %), followed by fishing from shore (32. 4 %), and spearfishing (3. 6 %). The mean time spent fishing is 3. 86 ± 0. 03 h d- 1, and more than one type of gear (mean 1. 27 ± 0. 21) is used simultaneously by a single angler. The frequency of fishing is 4 - 6 times per month, mainly on holidays and weekends, increasing in summer. The activity has a sizeable impact on the coastal fauna, with diverse catches of at least 1209. 25 t year- 1 (about 615 000 fishing outings year- 1). Thus, the amount of carbon extracted annually is at least 137. 34 kg C km- 2 year- 1, and the recreational fishery removes about 31 % of production at trophic level 4. Although these are gross estimates and more detailed study of the effect on trophic level and local production is needed, the values do highlight the pressure the recreational fishery exerts on coastal fish communities. Assuming that this level of exploitation is common to north-shore Mediterranean countries, there may be cause for concern about sustainable exploitation in the recreational fishery, and the effectiveness of current protection measures is discussed. Despite the limitations of the study, recreational fisheries clearly should be taken into account when considering measures for fisheries management. Moreover, fishing has considerable social import, and the benefits {{must be taken into account}} when investments to protect exploited resources are being contemplated. © 2005 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

After the power source and sensors were installed, differing electrode sizes, shapes, and configurations (horizontal, vertical, vertical w/ cable, “L” shaped) were placed and tested. The most important finding of this project to date is that electrode configuration is important, but the voltage to amperage ratio applied to those electrodes is even more so.

The {{spatial distribution of}} fish stocks is recognized as being {{an important aspect of}} stock abundance and spatial management tools, such as marine reserves, have become common. Information on the spatial distribution of fishing effort is critical to conducting this type of spatially-oriented management for at least two reasons. First, harvest information from individual vessels can generate data used in higher spatial resolution stock assessment. Second, understanding the location choice behavior of fishermen is important in understanding the effects of policy on both fish stocks and the fishermen themselves. In this paper, we compare for consistency two sources of two high-resolution data sets on <b>fishing</b> location: self-reported <b>logbook</b> data and vessel monitoring system data...|$|R
40|$|Gear for {{collecting}} fish samples continues to develop. Gear {{familiar to us}} now may not be familiar to our successors 100 years from now. The most common types of gear are described in the following sections. Consider these descriptions as standards; gear with other features must be more fully described in the <b>electronic</b> <b>Fish</b> Collection System or on the FISH COLLECTION form. Whenever you collect samples, make sure the gear is adequately described so that potential bias can be recognized, the information can be properly interpreted (both {{now and in the}} future), and the survey can be repeated at a later date. The Fish Collection System allows each net (or type of net) to be numbered so that its characteristics need be entered in the system only once. Then, in subsequent surveys, only net number need be recorded to link survey results to gear type and description. New gear or techniques are sometimes needed, use your training and experience to the fullest. 3. 1 Trap nets Description There are two types of trap nets in use for inland surveys; the " 3 -foot trap " and the " 6 / 3 -foot trap. " Walter Crowe (1950) described the 3 -foot trap (Figure 3. 1). Dave Havens and Joe Drew developed the 6 / 3 -foot trap (Figures 3. 1 and 3. 2). Both nets have 1 -inch stretched mesh in the pots...|$|R
