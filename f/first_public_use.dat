5|$|With {{water levels}} above the {{structure}} remaining fairly constant, £400,000 {{was spent on}} refurbishing City Mills Lock. Although some work had been carried out in 2006, including the fitting of new metal gates, it was not operational, and had not been used for around 40 years. The second phase of restoration included fitting the equipment to automate its operation. The <b>first</b> <b>public</b> <b>use</b> of the lock occurred on 31 July 2010. British Waterways hoped to restore the Carpenters Road Lock soon afterwards, but the project was postponed until {{after the completion of}} the Olympic games, as temporary 'Land Bridges' were erected over the site of the lock to enable pedestrians to reach the stadium, some of which will be removed after the event. Following the Olympic games, it is hoped the waterways will continue to be used by both commercial and leisure craft.|$|E

2500|$|There is no {{evidence}} that the name [...] "Little Round Top" [...] was used by soldiers or civilians during the battle. Although the larger hill was known before the battle as Round Top, Round Top Mountain, and sometimes Round Hill, accounts written in 1863 referred to the smaller hill with a variety of names: Rock Hill, High Knob, Sugar Loaf Hill, Broad Top Summit, and granite spur of Round Top. Historian John B. Bachelder, who had an enormous influence on the preservation of the Gettysburg battlefield, personally favored the name [...] "Weed's Hill," [...] in honor of Brig. Gen. Stephen H. Weed, who was mortally wounded on Little Round Top. Bachelder abandoned that name by 1873. One of the <b>first</b> <b>public</b> <b>uses</b> of [...] "Little Round Top" [...] was by Edward Everett in his oration at the dedication of the Soldiers' National Cemetery on November 19, 1863.|$|R

50|$|Cape Henlopen, on Delaware Bay, {{has long}} been a public use area {{although}} it did not officially become a Delaware state park until 1964.

Penn's decree established Cape Henlopen as one of the <b>first</b> <b>public</b> <b>use</b> parcels of land in the Thirteen Colonies.|$|E

50|$|At {{various times}} during its history, Hart Island {{has had a}} workhouse, a hospital, prisons, a Civil War {{internment}} camp, a reformatory and a Nike missile base. The island's area is 0.531 km² (0.205 sq mi, or 131.22 acres) and had no permanent population as of the 2000 census. Currently it serves as the city's potter's field and {{is run by the}} New York City Department of Correction.

5000|$|Brian Eno, who {{coined the}} term {{generative}} music, has used generative techniques on many of his works, starting with Discreet Music (1975) {{up to and including}} (according to Sound on Sound Oct 2005) Another Day on Earth. His works, lectures, and interviews on the subject have done much to promote generative music in the avant-garde music community. Eno used SSEYO's Koan generative music system (created by Pete Cole and Tim Cole of Intermorphic), to create his hybrid album Generative Music 1 (published by SSEYO and Opal Arts in April 1996), which is probably his <b>first</b> <b>public</b> <b>use</b> of the term generative music.|$|E
50|$|On 18th August a {{goods train}} of eleven trucks, {{weighing}} 120 LT, travelled the 8+1/4 mi, Exeter to Starcross, in 15 minutes. On 8th September 1847, besides the usual service of trains hauled by locomotives, four extra ones commenced running, these being propelled by the atmospheric system. This was the <b>first</b> <b>public</b> <b>use</b> {{of the system}} on the South Devon Railway. Although the line was opened as far as Newton Abbot, between that station and Teignmouth locomotives were employed, but the piston carriage on the down train went on to Newton, where it was taken off with the superfluous carriages and placed on a convenient line to {{be attached to the}} up train when required, so that, on arriving at Teignmouth, where the locomotive was removed, the piston carriage started the train when the signal was given.|$|E
5000|$|In 1908 the WSPU adopted purple, white, {{and green}} as its {{official}} colours. These colours were chosen by Emmeline Pethick Lawrence because [...] "Purple...stands for the royal blood that flows in the veins of every suffragette...white stands for purity {{in private and}} public life...green is the colour of hope and the emblem of spring". June 1908 saw the <b>first</b> major <b>public</b> <b>use</b> of these colours when the WSPU held a 300,000-strong [...] "Women's Sunday" [...] rally in Hyde Park.|$|R
40|$|In June 2015, a cholera {{outbreak}} {{was declared}} in Juba, South Sudan. In addition to standard outbreak control measures, oral cholera vaccine (OCV) was proposed. As sufficient doses {{to cover the}} at-risk population were unavailable, a campaign using half the standard dosing regimen (one-dose) targeted high-risk neighborhoods and groups including neighbors of suspected cases. Here we report the operational details of this <b>first</b> <b>public</b> health <b>use</b> of a single-dose regimen of OCV and illustrate the feasibility of conducting highly targeted vaccination campaigns in an urban area...|$|R

By the time he was five, he had taught himself well enough for his <b>first</b> <b>public</b> performance, <b>using</b> his fist at times to reach the black keys. He did not receive formal lessons until he was ten, and when he was twelve he was accepted by the pre-eminent music teacher of the time, Nils Larsen. On several occasions, his parents pawned their wedding rings to pay for music lessons.|$|R

5000|$|Yablochkov’s major {{invention}} was {{the first}} model of an arc lamp that eliminated the mechanical complexity of competing lights that required a regulator to manage the voltaic arc. He went to Paris the same year where he built an industrial sample of the [...] "electric candle" [...] (French patent № 112024, 1876). It was in Paris that he developed his arc light idea into a complete system of electric lighting powered by Zénobe Gramme direct current dynamos fitted with an inverter to supply single-phase alternating current. The <b>first</b> <b>public</b> <b>use</b> of the Yablochkov system was in October 1877 at Halle Marengo of the Magasins du Louvre which was lit by six Yablochkov candles. By 1880, the system had grown in size to 120 lamps with 84 lit at a time powered by a 100-horsepower steam engine and had been operating every night for two and one half years.|$|E
5000|$|Uranian is a 19th-century {{term that}} {{referred}} to a person of a third sex—originally, someone with [...] "a female psyche in a male body" [...] who is sexually attracted to men, and later extended to cover homosexual gender variant females, {{and a number of}} other sexual types. It is believed to be an English adaptation of the German word Urning, which was first published by activist Karl Heinrich Ulrichs (1825-95) in a series of five booklets (1864-65) which were collected under the title Forschungen über das Räthsel der mannmännlichen Liebe ("Research into the Riddle of Man-Male Love"). Ulrichs developed his terminology before the <b>first</b> <b>public</b> <b>use</b> of the term [...] "homosexual", which appeared in 1869 in a pamphlet published anonymously by Karl-Maria Kertbeny (1824-82). The word Uranian (Urning) was derived by Ulrichs from the Greek goddess Aphrodite Urania, who was created out of the god Uranus' testicles. Therefore, it stands for homosexual gender, while Aphrodite Dionea (Dioning) represents the heterosexual gender.|$|E
25|$|The {{first line}} to obtain such an act, in 1758, {{was a private}} coal-owner's wagonway, the Middleton Railway in Leeds. The <b>first</b> for <b>public</b> <b>use,</b> and on cast iron rails, was the Surrey Iron Railway {{incorporated}} in 1799. It obtained an Act of Parliament on 21 May 1801 to build a tramroad between Wandsworth and Croydon {{in what is now}} south London; the engineer was William Jessop. Although it survived only until 1845 and was for freight traffic only, it prefaced many others {{in different parts of the}} country. Meanwhile, the <b>first</b> passenger-carrying <b>public</b> railway was the Oystermouth Railway, authorised in 1807. All three of these railways were initially worked by horses; the Surrey Iron Railway remained horse-drawn throughout its life.|$|R
50|$|Dating back to 1838, {{the library}} was Ohio's <b>first</b> <b>public</b> library founded <b>using</b> tax money. The Toledo Public Main Library at 325 North Michigan Street officially opened on September 5, 1940. The current system was created in 1970 when the Toledo Public, Lucas County, and Sylvania Public {{libraries}} merged. In 2001, the Main Library had a major expansion and restoration, which added 100000 sq ft to an Art Deco facility.|$|R
