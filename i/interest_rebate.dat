40|$|For {{agricultural}} businesses, managing {{debt capital}} means choosing from among myriad sources and terms for financing for inputs, machinery, equipment, and land. Providers of debt capital, including input suppliers, equipment dealers, commercial banks, and the Farm Credit System, offer differing <b>interest</b> rates, <b>rebates,</b> points and other non-interest costs. Microsoft Excel™-based financing decision aids {{were developed to}} help agricultural decision makers evaluate options by determining {{the true cost of}} capital from supplier financing, machinery and equipment financing, and real estate purchases. These same tools were also used as a teaching aid in senior-level university courses in farm management and agricultural finance to reinforce agricultural cost of capital concepts.

40|$|Major {{competitors}} {{of commercial}} banks frequently refinance consumer loans before maturity. They may do so either {{to maintain an}} ongoing credit relationship with a customer or to alleviate payment problems for customers experiencing credit difficulties. From a legal standpoint, creditors who engage in refinancings often are subject to laws regulating calculations of <b>interest</b> <b>rebates</b> on prepaid obligations. In addition, occasionally, as in Maine, refinanced balances nay be subject to different finance rate ceilings, etc., depending {{on the length of}} time unpaid balances are left outstanding. However, practically nothing is known {{about the extent to which}} commercial banks engage in consumer loan refinancings and whether, in fact, they need be much concerned about such laws. Little is known, also, about the types of loans banks are most likely to refinance and of their motives for doing so (to maintain bank-customer relationships or to reduce customer payment difficulties). This paper analyzes data on over 30, 000 consumer loans made from 1965 - 71 in five regions of the country by banks that participated in a Federal Reserve survey of bank consumer lending practices. By analyzing the frequency with which consumer loans were paid off by refinancing and the reasons for the refinancing it provides several useful insights into bank behavior. In particular, this analysis suggests that banks refinance only a small and declining portion of their total consumer loans. They do not appear to use refinancings as a way to maintain ongoing customer relation ships; however, they refinance loans more frequently to allow customers to make new expenditures than to meet payment problems. Nonetheless, refinancings to meet payment difficulties rose consistently during the 1969 - 70 recession. Data computed in this study suggests that riskier types of loans were not more likely to be refinanced than better quality types of loans however, individual bad loans were more likely to be refinanced than individual good loans. Finally, over time, possibly because of the growth of revolving credit, loans were les-s likely to be refinanced to allow bank customers to make new expenditures. I...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} long- and short-run {{neutrality}} of open-market monetary policy {{in a world}} of fixed exchange rates and imperfect substitutability between bonds denominated in different currencies. Using an illustrative portfolio-balance model, it shows that when the public discounts the future tax liabilities associated with the national debt and the central bank supports the exchange rate by trading non-interest-bearing foreign assets, open-market policy has a short-run effect, but no long-run effect, on the domestic price level and interest rate. When the foreign-exchange intervention assets earn <b>interest</b> that is <b>rebated</b> to and capitalized by the public, open-market policy loses even its short-run efficacy [...] the capital-account offset to monetary policy is complete. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we study political-economy {{determinants}} of the differentiation of environmental taxes between sectors. Using a common-agency model, we provide predictions on tax differentiation {{which are then}} tested {{using data from the}} German Ecological Tax Reform. As the reform is revenue neutral and reduces labor costs, tax differentiation is not only determined by the activity of lobby groups favoring reduced tax rates, but also by the groups' <b>interest</b> in revenue <b>rebates</b> to labor. Empirical data underpin our theoretical findings: A regression analysis of Germany's green tax reform explains environmental tax differentiation by the presence of sectoral interest groups. Besides market concentration and energy demand elasticities, the exposure of industries to international trade flows {{plays an important role in}} the environmental tax design...|$|R
40|$|STATE INCOME TAX REBATE. INITIATIVE STATUTE. The State Constitution {{requires}} {{tax revenues}} {{in excess of}} the state 2 ̆ 7 s appropriations limit be returned. This initiative would implement this requirement by establishing an income tax rebate system. Excess revenues for 1986 - 87 would be returned by October 15, 1988 through personal income tax rebate of 15 percent of 1986 taxes, but not to exceed 300 for married couples filing joint returns, heads of household, surviving spouses and 150 for all others. Future excess revenues would be returned pursuant to similar formula but rebate limits could fluctuate depending upon amount of excess revenues. Summary of estimate by Legislative Analyst and Director of Finance of fiscal impact on state and local governments: Approximately 1. 2 billion in <b>rebates</b> including <b>interest</b> would be available for distribution to taxpayers in October 1988 as a result of excess revenues attributable to 1986 - 87 fiscal year. Annual costs to the State General Fund for administering the rebate program would be approximately 4 million. <b>Interest</b> on the <b>rebated</b> revenues would also be a General Fund charge, estimated to be 110 million for the rebates to be distributed in October 1988...|$|R
