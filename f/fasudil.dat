50|$|The proliferative {{effects of}} ROCK on {{vascular}} endothelial cells {{is due to}} the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). ERK mediates cell proliferation via the phosphorylation of p27Kip1, thus accelerating the degradation rate of p27Kip1. p27Kip1 is a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor which down-regulates cell cycle by binding cyclin-CDK complex. Human pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells treated with <b>fasudil</b> showed a decrease in cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. <b>Fasudil</b> also decreases ERK activities, as well as increases level of p27Kip1. This suggested that the anti-proliferative effects of <b>fasudil</b> {{is due to the}} decrease of ERK activities via the inhibition of ROCK.|$|E

BackgroundSeveral small, non–placebo-controlled trials suggest that <b>fasudil</b> reduces myocardial ischemia in patients with stable or vasospastic angina. MethodsIn a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial, the efficacy and safety of <b>fasudil</b> were evaluated in stable angina patients. Of the 206 patients screened, 84 patients with reproducible exercise times were randomized 1 : 1 to <b>fasudil</b> or placebo. Nitroglycerin as needed and a beta- or calcium-channel blocker were allowed. <b>Fasudil</b> or matching placebo was force-titrated from 20 mg three times daily to 80 mg twice daily with 20 mg twice-daily increments every two weeks. Symptom-limited exercise testing was performed after two, four, six, and eight weeks of treatment. ResultsAt peak, exercise duration was significantly improved at all visits in both groups, although exercise duration was numerically greater in patients receiving <b>fasudil</b> versus those receiving placebo. Time to ≥ 1 mm ST-segment depression was increased with <b>fasudil</b> at both peak and trough compared with placebo (172. 1 s vs. 44. 0 s, p = 0. 001, and 92. 8 s vs. 26. 4 s, p = 0. 02, respectively). <b>Fasudil</b> improved Seattle Angina Questionnaire scores.

We also analyzed its effects in offspring from hypertensive mothers treated with a nitric oxide synthesis inhibitor (L-NAME; 50 mg/day). Prenatal exposure to <b>Fasudil</b> did not affect birth weight, but increased body weight from postnatal day 7 (P 7) to 9 months. In intrauterine growth-restricted (IUGR) fetuses exposed to L-NAME, maternal <b>Fasudil</b> treatment increased birth weight. At P 42 and P 180, rats exposed to <b>Fasudil</b> and L-NAME showed alterations of their food intake {{as well as an}} increased basal glycemia associated with mild glucose intolerance at 6 months which was also observed in Fasudil-exposed rats.

BackgroundAlthough Rho-kinase {{is reported}} {{to play an important}} role in vascular injury, the contribution of Rho-kinase to the progression of renal injury remains unestablished. MethodsWe examined the effect of <b>fasudil,</b> a Rho-kinase inhibitor, on the progression of renal injury in subtotally nephrectomized spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Rats were randomly assigned to three groups: sham-operated SHR; salt-loaded subtotally nephrectomized rats (SHR-subtotal nephrectomy); SHR-subtotal nephrectomy given <b>fasudil</b> for 6 weeks (SHR-subtotal nephrectomy + fasudil; 3 mg/kg/day). Renal morphologic and molecular analysis as well as urinary protein excretion was evaluated. ResultsIn SHR-subtotal nephrectomy treated with <b>fasudil,</b> systolic blood pressure was not significantly different from that in SHR-subtotal nephrectomy without <b>fasudil</b> (208 ± 8 mm Hg vs. 217 ± 14 mm Hg). Urinary protein excretion was markedly increased in SHR-subtotal nephrectomy (124 ± 16 mg/day), but this increase was significantly suppressed by <b>fasudil</b> (79 ± 12 mg/day). Renal histologic examination revealed that <b>fasudil</b> improved glomerular and tubulointerstitial injury scores with parallel amelioration of proliferating cell nuclear antigen-positive and ED- 1 –positive cell infiltration. Furthermore, Western blot analyses showed that both expression and activity of Rho-kinase were enhanced in SHR-subtotal nephrectomy, compared with those in SHR without nephrectomy, and <b>fasudil</b> suppressed Rho-kinase activity.

The treatment of <b>Fasudil</b> shifted inflammatory M 1 to anti-inflammatory M 2 macrophages in both early and late treatment, being shown by inhibiting CD 16 / 32, iNOS, IL- 12, TLR 4 and CD 40 and increasing CD 206, Arg- 1, IL- 10 and CD 14 in spleen. By using Western blot and immunohistochemistry, iNOS and Arg- 1, as two most specific markers for M 1 and M 2, was inhibited or induced in splenic macrophages and spinal cords of EAE mice treated with <b>Fasudil.</b> In vitro experiments also indicate that <b>Fasudil</b> shifts M 1 to M 2 phenotype, which {{does not require the}} participation or auxiliary of other cells.

Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) was recently described as a novel neuroprotective target in PD. Since alpha-synuclein (alpha-Syn) aggregation is a major hallmark in the pathogenesis of PD, we aimed to evaluate the anti-aggregative potential of pharmacological ROCK inhibition using the isoquinoline derivative <b>Fasudil,</b> a small molecule inhibitor already approved for clinical use in humans. <b>Fasudil</b> treatment significantly reduced alpha-Syn aggregation in vitro in a H 4 cell culture model as well as in a cell-free assay. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy analysis revealed a direct binding of <b>Fasudil</b> to tyrosine residues Y 133 and Y 136 in the C-terminal region of alpha-Syn. Importantly, this binding was shown to be biologically relevant using site-directed mutagenesis of these residues in the cell culture model. Furthermore, we evaluated the impact of long-term <b>Fasudil</b> treatment on alpha-Syn pathology in vivo in a transgenic mouse model overexpressing human alpha-Syn bearing the A 53 T mutation (alpha-Syn(A 53 T) mice). <b>Fasudil</b> treatment improved motor and cognitive functions in alpha-Syn(A 53 T) mice as determined by Catwalk (TM) gait analysis and novel object recognition (NOR), without apparent side effects.

Accumulating {{evidence}} {{has demonstrated that}} the Rho/Rho-associated protein kinase (Rho/ROCK) and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling pathways {{are involved in the}} pathogenesis of diabetic vascular injury. In this study, we investigated the beneficial effects of <b>fasudil,</b> a ROCK inhibitor, on vascular endothelial injury induced by advanced glycation end products (AGEs) in vitro. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were stimulated with AGEs and AGEs plus <b>fasudil</b> in various concentrations for different time periods. Monocyte-endothelial cell adhesion, vascular cell adhesion molecule- 1 (VCAM- 1) and monocyte chemoat-tractant protein- 1 (MCP- 1) expression, protein expression and activation of Rho/ROCK, activation of NF-κB and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production were evaluated. <b>Fasudil</b> suppressed AGE-induced monocyte-endothelial adhesion. <b>Fasudil</b> also reduced the mRNA and protein expression of VCAM- 1 and MCP- 1 in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Moreover, increases in the protein levels of Rho/ ROCK and ROCK activity mediated by AGEs were inhibited by the addition of <b>fasudil.</b> Additionally, <b>fasudil</b> attenuated AGE-induced NF-κB-dependent transcriptional activity and inhibition of NF-κB (IκB) phosphorylation.

The possible involvement of oxidative stress in the effect of <b>fasudil</b> during hyperinsulinemia was investigated in MetS patients (n = 5) by infusing vitamin C (25 mg/min). In MetS patients, compared with saline, <b>fasudil</b> enhanced endothelium-dependent and -independent vasodilator responses during insulin infusion (P < 0. 001 and P = 0. 008, respectively), but not in the absence of hyperinsulinemia (P = 0. 25 and P = 0. 13, respectively).

We investigated {{the effect of the}} Rho/Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) inhibitor <b>fasudil</b> on cardiac mitochondria from rats in which diabetes was induced by a combination of streptozotocin (STZ) and a sustained high-fat diet. Eight weeks after diabetes was induced by a single intraperitoneal injection of 50 [*]mg/kg STZ followed by a sustained high-fat diet, either <b>fasudil</b> (5 [*]mg/kg bid) or equivalent volumes of saline (control) were administered over four weeks. <b>Fasudil</b> significantly protected against the histopathologic changes of cardiac mitochondria in diabetic rats. <b>Fasudil</b> significantly reduced the abundances of the Rho A, ROCK 1, and ROCK 2 proteins, restored the activities of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) and monoamine oxidase (MAO) in cardiac mitochondria, inhibited the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, and decreased the total antioxidant capacity, as well as levels of malonyldialdehyde, hydroxy radical, reduced glutathione, and superoxide dismutase in heart. <b>Fasudil</b> improved the structures of cardiac mitochondria and increased both SDH and MAO activities in cardiac mitochondria. These beneficial effects may be associated with the attenuation of oxidative stress caused by <b>fasudil</b> treatment...|$|E
40|$|Rho-Rho kinase (Rho-ROCK) {{triggers}} an intracellular signalling cascade {{that regulates}} cell survival, death, adhesion, migration, neurite outgrowth and retraction and influences the generation {{and development of}} several neurological disorders. Although <b>Fasudil,</b> a ROCK inhibitor, effectively suppressed encephalomyelitis (EAE), certain side effects may limit its clinical use. A novel and efficient ROCK inhibitor, FSD-C 10, has been explored. In the present study, we present chemical synthesis and structure of FSD-C 10, {{as well as the}} relationship between compound concentration and ROCK inhibition. We compared the inhibitory efficiency of ROCKI and ROCK II, the cell cytotoxicity, neurite outgrowth and dendritic formation, neurotrophic factors and vasodilation between <b>Fasudil</b> and FSD-C 10. The results demonstrated that FSD-C 10, like <b>Fasudil,</b> induced neurite outgrowth of neurons and dendritic formation of BV- 2 microglia and enhanced the production of neurotrophic factor brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and neurotrophin- 3 (NT- 3). However, the cell cytotoxicity and vasodilation of FSD-C 10 were relatively small compared with <b>Fasudil.</b> Although <b>Fasudil</b> inhibited both ROCK I and ROCK II, FSD-C 10 more selectively suppressed ROCK II, but not ROCK I, which may be related to vasodilation insensitivity and animal mortality. Thus, FSD-C 10 may be a safer and more promising novel ROCK inhibitor than <b>Fasudil</b> for the treatment o...|$|E
40|$|Resistance {{mechanisms}} of rho-associated kinase (ROCK) inhibitors {{are associated with}} the enhanced expression of cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX- 2). The therapeutic effects of ROCK on nervous system diseases might be enhanced by COX- 2 inhibitors. This study investigated the synergistic effect of the combined use of the ROCK inhibitor <b>fasudil</b> and a COX- 2 inhibitor celecoxib on spinal cord injury in a rat model established by transecting the right half of the spinal cord at T 11. Rat models were orally administrated with celecoxib (20 mg/kg) and/or intramuscularly with <b>fasudil</b> (10 mg/kg) for 2 weeks. Results demonstrated that the combined use of celecoxib and <b>fasudil</b> significantly decreased COX- 2 and Rho kinase II expression surrounding the lesion site in rats with spinal cord injury, improved the pathomorphology of the injured spinal cord, and promoted the recovery of motor function. Moreover, the effects of the drug combination were better than celecoxib or <b>fasudil</b> alone. This study demonstrated that the combined use of <b>fasudil</b> and celecoxib synergistically enhanced the functional recovery of injured spinal cord in rats...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Accumulating {{evidence}} suggests that inflammatory cell infiltration is crucial pathogenesis during the initiation and progression of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Given Rho-kinase (ROCK), an important kinase control the actin cytoskeleton, regulates the inflammatory cell infiltration, thus, we investigate the possibility and mechanism of preventing experimental AAA progression via targeting ROCK in mice porcine pancreatic elastase (PPE) model. Methods and Results: AAA was created in 10 -week-old male C 57 BL/ 6 mice by transient intraluminal porcine pancreatic elastase infusion into the infrarenal aorta. The mRNA level of RhoA, RhoC, ROCK 1 and ROCK 2 were elevated in aneurismal aorta. Next, PPE infusion mice were orally administrated with vehicle or ROCK inhibitor (<b>Fasudil</b> at dose of 200 mg/kg/day) {{during the period of}} day 1 prior to PPE infusion to day 14 after PPE infusion. PPE infusion mice treated with <b>Fasudil</b> produced significantly smaller aneurysms as compare to PPE infusion mice treated with vehicle. AAAs developed in all vehicle-treated groups within 14 days, whereas AAAs developed in six mice (66 %, 6 / 9) treated with <b>Fasudil</b> within 14 days. Furthermore, our semi-quantitative histological analysis revealed that blood vessels and macrophages were significantly reduced in <b>Fasudil</b> treated mice during the AAA progression. Finally, when mice with existing AAAs were treated with <b>Fasudil,</b> the enlargement was nearly completely suppressed. Conclusion: <b>Fasudil</b> inhibits experimental AAA progression and stabilize existing aneurysms, through mechanisms likel...|$|E
40|$|Background: Neurite {{outgrowth}} {{is one of}} {{the important}} therapeutic strategies for neuronal plasticity and regeneration in neural disorders. <b>Fasudil</b> is a clinical medication that is used to treat subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) and that is beneficial for many animal models of central nervous system (CNS) diseases. In this study, we hypothesised that <b>fasudil</b> administration would promote neurite outgrowth in neural stem cells (NSCs). Methods: Changes in cell morphology were imaged under a light microscope, and neurite-bearing cells were counted. Cell viability and the necrosis rate were determined by MTT and LDH assays, respectively. Additionally, western blot and immunofluorescence analyses were performed to detect protein expression levels. Results: We found that <b>fasudil</b> promoted neurite outgrowth in C 17. 2 cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. The neurite-bearing C 17. 2 cells were differentiated by detecting the changes in neural and astrocytic markers after <b>fasudil</b> treatment through down-regulating Notch signalling. Previously, <b>fasudil</b> was reported to induce autophagy, which {{plays an important role in}} neural differentiation. However, both rapamycin, an autophagy inducer, and 3 -methyl-adenine (3 -MA), an autophagy inhibitor, had no effects on the fasudil-induced neurite outgrowth, suggesting that autophagy may be not involved in this process. Conclusion: In summary, <b>fasudil</b> could stimulate neurite outgrowth and differentiation in C 17. 2 cells by modulating Notch signalling but not autophagy...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Previous studies {{suggested}} that the RhoA/ROCK pathway may contribute to vascular complications in diabetes. The present {{study was designed to}} investigate whether ROCK inhibitor <b>fasudil</b> could prevent high glucose-induced monocyte-endothelial cells adhesion, and whether this was related to <b>fasudil</b> effects on vascular endothelial cell expression of chemotactic factors, vascular cell adhesion molecule- 1 (VCAM- 1) and monocyte chemoattractant protein- 1 (MCP- 1). Methods HUVECs were stimulated with high glucose (HG) or HG[*]+[*]fasudil in different concentration or different time. Monocyte-endothelial cell adhesion was determined using fluorescence-labeled monocytes. The mRNA and protein expression of VCAM- 1 and MCP- 1 were measured using real-time PCR and western blot. The protein levels of RhoA, ROCKI and p-MYPT were determined using western blot analysis. ELISA was employed to measure the expression of soluble VCAM- 1 and MCP- 1 in cell supernatants and human serum samples. Results <b>Fasudil</b> significantly suppressed HG-induced adhesion of THP- 1 to HUVECs. <b>Fasudil</b> reduced Rho/ROCK activity (as indicated by lower p-MYPT/MYPT ratio), and prevented HG induced increases in VCAM- 1 and MCP- 1 mRNA and protein levels. <b>Fasudil</b> also decreased MCP- 1 concentration in HUVEC supernatants, but increased sVCAM- 1 shedding into the media. In human diabetic subjects, 2 [*]weeks of <b>fasudil</b> treatment significantly decreased serum MCP- 1 level from 27. 9 [*]±[*] 10. 6 [*]pg/ml to 13. 8 [*]±[*] 7. 0 [*]pg/ml (P [*] P [*] Conclusions Treatment with the Rho/ROCK pathway inhibitor <b>fasudil</b> attenuated HG-induced monocyte-endothelial cell adhesion, possibly by reducing endothelial expression of VCAM- 1 and MCP- 1. These results suggest inhibition of Rho/ROCK signaling may have therapeutic potential in preventing diabetes associated vascular inflammation and atherogenesis. </p...|$|E
