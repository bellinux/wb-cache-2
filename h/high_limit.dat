50|$|In <b>higher</b> <b>limit</b> games, players {{tend to be}} tighter, and it is {{more common}} for {{everyone}} to fold to the blinds. In this case, chopping would occur so frequently {{that it would be}} pointless. Furthermore, <b>higher</b> <b>limit</b> games {{are much more likely to}} be short-handed. Finally, the rake in <b>higher</b> <b>limit</b> games is usually much smaller in comparison to the size of the pot, and if a collection is taken instead of a rake, this removes the economic reason for chopping. For all these reasons, chopping is much more common in lower limit games than in <b>higher</b> <b>limit</b> games.|$|R

5000|$|An aquastat is {{a device}} used in {{hydronic}} heating systems for controlling water temperature. To prevent the boiler from firing too often, aquastats have a <b>high</b> <b>limit</b> temperature {{and a low}} limit. If the thermostat is calling for heat, the boiler will fire until the <b>high</b> <b>limit</b> is reached, then shut off (even if the thermostat is still calling for heat). The boiler will re-fire if the boiler water temperature drops below a range around the <b>high</b> <b>limit.</b> The <b>high</b> <b>limit</b> exists {{for the sake of}} efficiency and safety. The boiler will also fire (regardless of thermostat state) when the boiler water temperature goes below a range around the low limit, ensuring that the boiler water temperature remains above a certain point. The low limit is intended for tankless domestic hot water---it ensures that boiler water is always warm enough to heat the domestic hot water. Many aquastats also have a differential ("diff") control which determines the size of the range around the [...] "low" [...] and/or [...] "high" [...] controls.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} higher derived functors of the inverse limit of a functor F: D [...] > Z_{(p) }-mod, where D {{is one of}} the {{standard}} categories which arise when studying the homotopy theory of the classifying space of a finite group G, e. g., the orbit category or the Quillen category of G. These <b>higher</b> <b>limits</b> are of importance e. g., for the study of maps between classifying spaces as well as for group cohomology. We show that these <b>higher</b> <b>limits</b> can be identified with the G-equivariant Bredon cohomology of the subgroup complex of p-subgroups in G (i. e., the nerve of the poset of p-subgroups in G) with values in a G-local coefficient system. We examine when smaller complexes can be used e. g., taking only p-radical subgroups, p-centric subgroups, elementary abelian p-subgroups or various subcollections thereof. Since the subgroup complexes are finite complexes, and often rather small, this provides concrete, computable formulas for these <b>higher</b> <b>limits,</b> generalizing earlier work of especially Jackowski-McClure-Oliver. As an application we look at the special case where all the <b>higher</b> <b>limits</b> vanish, as for example is the case for group cohomology. If F is a functor on the orbit category our formulas for the <b>higher</b> <b>limits</b> in this case yield five different expressions of F(G) in terms of values of F on proper subgroups. Two of these are `classical' namely Webb's exact sequence of Mackey functors and a formula for calculating stable elements, previously obtained using Alperin's fusion theorem. Examining this case also leads to improvements of sharpness results of homology decompositions due to Dwyer and others...|$|R

50|$|For example, basic limit loss {{costs or}} rates may be {{calculated}} for many territories and classes of business. At {{a relatively low}} limit of liability, such as $100,000, {{there may be a}} high volume of data {{that can be used to}} derive those rates. For <b>higher</b> <b>limits,</b> there may be a credible volume of data at the countrywide level but not much data available for individual territories or classes. Increased limit factors can be derived at the countrywide level (or some other broad grouping) and then applied to the basic limit rates to arrive at rates for <b>higher</b> <b>limits</b> of liability.|$|R
50|$|Most new {{snowmelt}} systems {{operate in}} conjunction with an automatic activation device that will turn on the system on when it senses precipitation and freezing temperatures and turn off the system when temperatures are above freezing. These types of devices ensure the system is only active during useful periods and reduces energy waste. A <b>high</b> <b>limit</b> thermostat further increases efficiency when installed {{in conjunction with}} the automatic snow melt controller to temporarily disable the system once the slab has reached a sufficient snow melting temperature. Some building codes require the <b>high</b> <b>limit</b> thermostat to prevent energy waste. Though their total environmental impact depends on their energy source. Current systems are more cost effective in the long run than continual salt dumping and removal, and reduce waste by extending the life of the concrete.|$|E
