The data showed {{the configuration of the}} seafloor where he saw that some undersea mountains had flat tops.Hess called these undersea mountains 'guyots' because they resembled Guyot Hall, the flat roofed biology and geology building at Princeton University which was itself named after the 19th century geographer Arnold Henry Guyot.Hess postulated they were once volcanic islands that were beheaded by wave action yet they are now deep under sea level. This idea was used to help bolster the theory of plate tectonics.|$|E

[...] The remainder of the ridge was discovered in the 1920s by the German Meteor expedition using <b>echo-sounding</b> <b>equipment.</b> The exploration of the MAR in the 1950s lead to the general acceptance of seafloor spreading and plate tectonics.|$|E
30|$|During World War II, Harry H. Hess, Captain of the U.S.S. Cape Johnson, {{an assault}} transport, let his vessel’s <b>echo-sounding</b> <b>equipment</b> run {{continuously}} during long traverses across the Pacific Ocean. Hess was thus able {{to reveal the}} profiles of extensive tracts along the Pacific Ocean’s floor. Hess discovered in the South Pacific flat-topped undersea mountains that he named guyots. He realized that these were originally volcanic mountains whose heights over time eroded first to sea level where they existed for a time as the support base for coral atolls. Slowly, {{the movement of the}} seafloor to which they were attached brought them into deeper water where they were submerged and finally brought them {{to the edge of a}} trench into which they would ultimately plunge. Reflecting on those observations, Hess (1954) proposed the concept of seafloor spreading, the idea that oceanic basalt, the rock comprising seafloors, continually erupts from volcanoes at the mid-ocean ridges, creeps across the ocean bottom, and ultimately plunges into the Earth at trenches that often occur beside the continents. Hess adopted Holmes’ idea of mantle convection to explain the fate of subducted seafloor.|$|E
50|$|For the {{remainder}} of the war, most of Kühnhold’s research at the NVK was in underwater acoustic techniques, working closely with the firm Electroacoustik GmbH (ELAC) in Kiel. Founded in 1926, ELAC was the primary supplier of <b>echo-sounding</b> (sonar) <b>equipment</b> for the Kriegsmarine, with a staff that peaked near 5,000. When the war ended in May 1945, the NVK was closed, and ELAC was restricted to commercial audio products and reduced to a small number of employees. In 1948, the U.S. High Commissioner for Germany relaxed restrictions on ELAC and the firm formed a Nautik Division for the design and production of nautical equipment. Kühnhold joined ELAC and initiated research in commercial radar. His work there resulted in patents, included one registered in the United States in 1954. ELAC had major financial problems, resulting in selling its Nautik Division and ending Kühnhold’s professional career in the 1960s.|$|R
