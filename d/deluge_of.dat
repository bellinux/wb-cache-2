5|$|The main {{method of}} Candides satire is to {{contrast}} ironically great tragedy and comedy. The story does not invent or exaggerate evils of the world—it displays real ones starkly, allowing Voltaire to simplify subtle philosophies and cultural traditions, highlighting their flaws. Thus Candide derides optimism, for instance, with a <b>deluge</b> <b>of</b> horrible, historical (or at least plausible) events {{with no apparent}} redeeming qualities.|$|E
5|$|Władysław IV's father, Sigismund III Vasa, {{grandson}} of Sweden's King Gustav I, had succeeded {{his father to}} the Swedish throne in 1592, only to be deposed in 1599 by his uncle, subsequently King Charles IX. This resulted in a long-standing feud, with the Polish kings of the House of Vasa claiming the Swedish throne. This led to the Polish–Swedish War of 1600–29 and later to the <b>Deluge</b> <b>of</b> 1655.|$|E
5|$|Constitutional {{objections}} {{were raised}} in House debates as to whether both houses of Congress could constitutionally authorize admission of territories, rather than states. Moreover, if the Republic of Texas, a nation in its own right, were admitted as a state, its territorial boundaries, property relations (including slave property), debts and public lands would require a Senate-ratified treaty. Democrats were particularly uneasy about burdening the United States with $10 million in Texas debt, resenting the <b>deluge</b> <b>of</b> speculators, who had bought Texas bonds cheap and now lobbied Congress for the Texas House bill. House Democrats, at an impasse, relinquished the legislative initiative to the southern Whigs.|$|E

5|$|The New York {{stage was}} filled with ribald humor and sexually {{offensive}} comedy; when movie producers started to put wisecracks in their sound pictures, they sought New York performers. Popular comics such as the Marx Brothers got their start on Broadway in front of live audiences. Censors complained {{when they had to}} keep up with the <b>deluge</b> <b>of</b> jokes in pictures in the early 1930s, some of which were designed to go over their heads. The comic banter of some early sound films was rapid-fire, non-stop, and frequently exhausting for the audience by the final reel.|$|E
5|$|With {{the score}} now 2–0 {{in favor of}} Spassky, many {{observers}} believed that the match was over and Fischer would leave Iceland, and, indeed, Fischer looked to board the next plane out of Iceland, only to be dissuaded by his second, William Lombardy. His decision {{to stay in the}} match was attributed by some to another phone call from Kissinger and a <b>deluge</b> <b>of</b> cablegrams to Fischer. Spassky, owing to his sporting spirit and respect and sympathy for Fischer, agreed to play the third game in a small room backstage, {{out of sight of the}} spectators. According to Pal Benko and Burt Hochberg, this concession was a psychological mistake by Spassky.|$|E
5|$|After their {{conquest of}} Pasir Panjang Ridge, the Japanese {{proceeded}} to march towards {{the city of}} Singapore for their final decisive thrust against remaining Allied forces there. Perched on a hill (near present Keppel Country Club) along Pasir Panjang Road, the escaped Malay and British soldiers had gathered together and waited patiently to ambush the Japanese convoy heading towards the city. Using mounted Bofors guns, they let loose <b>deluge</b> <b>of</b> gunshots causing the Japanese to scramble for cover. The Japanese tanks attempted to move forward to engage the enemy {{but they could not}} advance due to the sea of dead and wounded bodies blocking its way. About 100 Japanese soldiers were killed during the ambush before the Anglo-Malay force retreated to the city to join their fellow men for their final stand against the Japanese.|$|E

5|$|Gorbachev {{set aside}} 5 billion rubles (about $8 billion U.S. dollars) in {{funds for a}} start on what would likely be a {{recovery}} cost that would exceed the cleanup bill for the 1986 nuclear and radiation accident in Ukraine. While foreign doctors did assist with the Chernobyl incident, the Soviet relief effort after the earthquake was augmented by the largest foreign cooperation since World War II. That <b>deluge</b> <b>of</b> western aid was a byproduct of the disaster that {{may have had a}} positive effect on Soviet Union–United States relations. The cost of rebuilding would be a severe obstacle for Perestroika, Gorbachev's plan for economic restructuring. Another adverse effect of the disaster was that the Armenians were already distrustful of Gorbachev's dismissal of their claims to the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, which the Armenians had been contesting with neighboring Azerbaijan.|$|E
5|$|The 1935 Jérémie {{hurricane}} was {{a highly}} destructive and catastrophic tropical cyclone that impacted the Greater Antilles and Honduras in October 1935, killing well over 2,000 people. Developing on October 18 over the southwestern Caribbean Sea, the storm proceeded to strike eastern Jamaica and southeastern Cuba while overwhelming southwestern Haiti in a <b>deluge</b> <b>of</b> rain. The hurricane—a Category 1 at its peak—completed an unusual reversal of its path on October 23, heading southwestward toward Central America. Weakened by its interaction with Cuba, the storm soon regained strength and made its final landfall near Cabo Gracias a Dios in Honduras on October 25. The cyclone weakened upon moving inland and dissipated two days later.|$|E

The film was posted on video.google.com and quickly {{garnered}} 1.5 million hits and a <b>deluge</b> <b>of</b> fan mail to the jamesmceachin.com website; this inspired McEachin's latest contribution, Old Glory, which he wrote, produced, directed, and acted in. Old Glory was McEachin's directorial debut.|$|E
25|$|Sambalpur {{retains its}} classic sleepy charm, {{even in the}} face of rapid, albeit {{unplanned}} expansion and a <b>deluge</b> <b>of</b> retail establishments. Some of the houses along the old part of Sambalpur are still maintained, and used, like they were a century ago. A peculiar way the houses in the older parts of town are arranged is, the gulli system, literally, mazeway. Houses in Patnaikpara, Nandpara, and along the parallel streets of Sansadak and Badsadak are examples of this.|$|E
25|$|For 1923, {{he succeeded}} his two elder {{brothers}} as captain of Cambridge University, {{but was unable}} to emulate his brothers in the varsity match. Oxford batted all the first day, and during the night a severe thunderstorm with a <b>deluge</b> <b>of</b> rain completely altered the conditions at Lord's, with the result that Cambridge were dismissed twice and beaten on the Tuesday by an innings and 227 runs, the most overwhelming defeat in the whole series of University matches and the three most decisive results to occur consecutively. Claude thus ended his time with the university in rather dismal circumstances.|$|E
60|$|The {{sight that}} met his gale {{when he looked}} out was {{sufficiently}} terrible. Day had begun to dawn, and the grey light showed him a large mass of earth and trees moving down the ravine. The latter were crashing and overturning. As he gazed they went bodily over the cliffs, a mighty avalanche, into the sea. The whole had evidently been loosened from the rocks {{by the action of}} the wind on the trees, coupled with the <b>deluges</b> <b>of</b> rain.|$|R

Their troops are joined, and our destruction nigh.|$|R

25|$|Wayne Chiang, a Fall 2006 {{graduate}} of Virginia Tech and an ardent {{supporter of the}} right to bear arms, was widely mistaken as the killer, as his profile matched several key attributes of the suspected shooter falsely reported by the Chicago Sun-Times. After receiving a <b>deluge</b> <b>of</b> hate-mail and death threats, he came out declaring he was not the shooter. Following the identification of the perpetrator, several media outlets named Chiang, including Geraldo Rivera on Fox News and CNN. His picture was also included twice in a CTV montage of pictures of the actual shooter, even after the shooter had been positively identified as Cho Seung-Hui.|$|E
25|$|The {{only part}} of the railway {{property}} that remained Lowe's was the observatory on Echo Mountain. It boasted a 16-inch (406.4mm) reflective telescope from which many astronomical finds were made. It was blown down in a gale in 1928. The railway fell in stages to the Echo Mountain House fire, a kitchen fire on February 4, 1900; a wind-aided brush fire on Echo Mountain in 1905, which wiped out everything except the observatory and the astronomer's cabin; a Rubio Canyon flash flood in 1909 that destroyed the Pavilion; and an electrical fire that razed the Tavern in 1936. The line was abandoned after the Los Angeles <b>deluge</b> <b>of</b> March 1938.|$|E
25|$|By early 1986, {{even though}} the ship had survived the expense of staging Stinkfoot, and {{even though the}}re was a plan to sail Thekla at least to the port of New York City to try her artistic mettle there, Ki had become {{exhausted}} by the day-to-day running of such a huge venture. Vivian, buoyed by the experience of Stinkfoot, was eager to renew his recording career, and Ki to continue her career as a novelist. Ki was also experiencing ill-health due to the stress of managing something so complex as The Old Profanity Showboat. Announcing closure of the ship, there came a <b>deluge</b> <b>of</b> protest by artists and customers whose home it had become. Accordingly, the Old Pro continued to showcase theatre and bands until August 1986.|$|E

This part is designed by NOX architects from Rotterdam. There are no windows and the floors are not level. Walking through these corridors is different from normal museum exhibits as each stage provides different experiences such as liquid water spray from a geyser, things to make a person jump and large <b>deluges</b> <b>of</b> rain, in addition to educational pieces about whales and whaling in the black part of the building designed by Kas Oosterhuis.|$|R
