Protein-associated DNA {{occupies}} about 1/4 of the intracellular volume forming a concentrated viscous phase with liquid crystalline properties, called the nucleoid. Similar DNA packaging exists also in chloroplasts and mitochondria. Bacterial DNA is sometimes referred to as the bacterial chromosome. Bacterial nucleoid evolutionary represents an intermediate engineering solution between the protein-free <b>DNA</b> <b>packing</b> in viruses and protein-determined packing in eukaryotes.|$|E

Mechanistic details of <b>DNA</b> <b>packing</b> are essential for its functioning in the process of gene regulation in living systems. Condensed DNA often has surprising properties, which one would not predict from classical concepts of dilute solutions. Therefore, DNA condensation in vitro serves as a model system for many processes of physics, biochemistry and biology.

5000|$|DNA {{diameter}} {{is about}} 2 nm, while {{the length of}} a stretched single molecule may be up to several dozens of centimetres depending on the organism. Many features of the DNA double helix contribute to its large stiffness, including the mechanical properties of the sugar-phosphate backbone, electrostatic repulsion between phosphates (DNA bears on average one elementary negative charge per each 0.17 nm of the double helix), stacking interactions between the bases of each individual strand, and strand-strand interactions. DNA is one of the stiffest natural polymers, yet {{it is also one of}} the longest molecules. This means that at large distances DNA can be considered as a flexible rope, and on a short scale as a stiff rod. Like a garden hose, unpacked DNA would randomly occupy a much larger volume than when it is orderly packed. Mathematically, for a non-interacting flexible chain randomly diffusing in 3D, the end-to-end distance would scale as a square root of the polymer length. For real polymers such as DNA, this gives only a very rough estimate; what is important, is that the space available for the DNA in vivo is much smaller than the space that it would occupy in the case of a free diffusion in the solution. To cope with volume constraints, DNA can pack itself in the appropriate solution conditions with the help of ions and other molecules. Usually, DNA condensation is defined as [...] "the collapse of extended DNA chains into compact, orderly particles containing only one or a few molecules". This definition applies to many situations in vitro and is also close to the definition of DNA condensation in bacteria as [...] "adoption of relatively concentrated, compact state occupying a fraction of the volume available". In eukaryotes, the DNA size and the number of other participating players are much larger, and a DNA molecule forms millions of ordered nucleoprotein particles, the nucleosomes, which is just the first of many levels of <b>DNA</b> <b>packing.</b>|$|E
40|$|It is {{well known}} that genomic {{materials}} (long DNA chains) of living organisms are often packed compactly under extreme confining conditions using macromolecular self-assembly processes but the general <b>DNA</b> <b>packing</b> mechanism remains an unsolved problem. It has been proposed that the topology of the packed DNA may be used to study the <b>DNA</b> <b>packing</b> mechanism. For example, in the case of (mutant) bacteriophage P 4, DNA molecules packed inside the bacteriophage head are considered to be circular since the two sticky ends of the DNA are close to each other. The DNAs extracted from the capsid without separating the two ends can thus preserve the topology of the (circular) DNAs. It turns out that the circular DNAs extracted from bacteriophage P 4 are non-trivially knotted with very high probability and with a bias toward chiral knots. In order to study this problem using a systematic approach based on mathematical modeling, one needs to introduce a <b>DNA</b> <b>packing</b> model under extreme volume confinement condition and test whether such a model can produce the kind of knot spectrum observed in the experiments. In this paper we introduce and study a model of equilateral random polygons con_ned in a sphere. This model is not meant to generate polygons that model DNA packed in a virus head directly. Instead, the average topological characteristics of this model may serve as benchmark data for totally randomly packed circular DNAs. The difference between the biologically observed topological characteristics and our benchmark data might reveal the bias of DNA packed in the viral capsids and possibly lead {{to a better understanding of}} the <b>DNA</b> <b>packing</b> mechanism, at least for the bacteriophage DNA. The purpose of this paper is to provide information about the knot spectrum of equilateral random polygons under such a spherical confinement with length and confinement ratios in a range comparable to circular DNAs packed inside bacteriophage heads...|$|E

40|$|DNA toroids {{produced}} by the condensation of λ phage DNA with hexammine cobalt (III) have been investigated by cryoelectron microscopy. Image resolution obtained by this technique has allowed unprecedented views of <b>DNA</b> <b>packing</b> within toroidal condensates. Toroids oriented coplanar with the microscope image plane exhibit circular fringes with a repeat spacing of 2. 4 nm. For some toroids these fringes are observed around almost the entire circumference of the toroid. However, for most toroids well-defined fringes are limited to less {{than one-third of the}} total toroid circumference. Some toroids oriented perpendicular to the image plane reveal DNA polymers organized in a hexagonal close-packed lattice; however, for other toroids alternative packing arrangements are observed. To aid interpretation of electron micrographs, three-dimensional model toroids were generated with perfect hexagonal <b>DNA</b> <b>packing</b> throughout, as well as more physically realistic models that contain crossover points between DNA loops.

40|$|Plants {{are able}} to {{recognize}} and degrade double-strand RNA molecules employing the mechanism of post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS). PTGS is both a vegetal defense strategy against viral infections and a conserved eukaryotic mechanism for regulate endogenous gene expression. The VIGS methodology(Virus Induced Gene Silencing) uses this mechanism to selectively silence genes employing viral vectors, which contain the target gene, becoming a tool for functional gene validation. Geminiviridae family, with the Begomovirus, Curtovirus, Mastrevirus and Topocuvirus genera, encompass viruses of circular, single-strand <b>DNA</b> <b>packed</b> in icosahedric geminated particles, {{and some of them}} had been evolved to infect particular plant species.

40|$|Bacteriophages {{initiate}} infection {{by releasing}} their double-stranded DNA into the cytosol of their bacterial host. However, what controls {{and sets the}} timescales of DNA ejection? Here we provide evidence from stochastic simulations which shows that the topology and organization of <b>DNA</b> <b>packed</b> inside the capsid {{plays a key role}} in determining these properties. Even with similar osmotic pressure pushing out the DNA, we find that spatially ordered DNA spools have a much lower effective friction than disordered entangled states. Such spools are only found when the tendency of nearby DNA strands to align locally is accounted for. This topological or conformational friction also depends on DNA knot type in the packing geometry and slows down or arrests the ejection of twist knots and very complex knots. We also find that the family of (2, 2 k+ 1) torus knots unravel gradually by simplifying their topology in a stepwise fashion. Finally, an analysis of DNA trajectories inside the capsid shows that the knots formed throughout the ejection process mirror those found in gel electrophoresis experiments for viral DNA molecules extracted from the capsids...|$|R

40|$|Jumbo phages, the phages with genome length {{larger than}} 200 Kbp, are extreme {{examples}} of how the capsid and genome coordinate in evolution. To learn the mechanism of capsid size change during evolutionary time, the capsid and DNA of several jumbo phages were characterized. The capsid structure and protein of a T= 25 Sphingomonas paucimobilis phage PAU and a T= 28 Escherichia coli phage 121 Q were studied in detail. The high resolution cryo-EM structures show that the major capsid proteins (MCPs) of both phages adopt the HK 97 fold which is conserved in all solved tailed phage MCP structures. The capsids contain decoration proteins with unprecedented shape and location. A pentameric protein structure is attached on the inner surface of the pentamer in both capsids. The PAU capsid has arcs of density located on hexamers surrounding the pentons, which may bend the conformation of the subunit it interacts with to improve capsid stability. 121 Q capsid contains dimeric density near the local 2 -fold symmetry axes and knob-like density at {{the middle of the}} hexamer, which may participate in forming the capsid shell because the 121 Q MCP leaves holes at the two locations. Both capsids contain a number of internal proteins whose roles are not clear. The study on the jumbo phage DNA started with showing that partial modification of the cytosine in PAU and phage G DNA significantly slowed the phage DNA in electrophoresis. A new technique was developed to quantify the effect of base modifications in large DNA in electrophoresis, with which reliable measurements of the chromosome size of our jumbo phage collection were made. Jumbo phages have larger terminal redundancy and lower <b>DNA</b> <b>packing</b> density compared to small and mid-sized phages. The result on the <b>DNA</b> <b>packing</b> density in different sizes of phages reveals a negative correlation between the capsid size and the <b>DNA</b> <b>packing</b> density.
