5000|$|While none of <b>Gnocchi's</b> {{music has}} been published, one CD {{of some of his}} {{instrumental}} works is available: a 2005 recording of sonatas by Brixia Musicalis. [...] In 2005, LIBER, a non-profit society in Alfianello, <b>Gnocchi's</b> birthplace, initiated the [...] "Eventi nel segno di Pietro Gnocchi", a festival of sacred music. Some of his masses, as well as vocal and instrumental works were played. The concerts take place on the third Sunday of October.|$|R
25|$|Most of <b>Gnocchi's</b> {{output of}} music is stored in the {{archives}} of the Brescia Cathedral and Chiesa della Madonna delle Grazie in Brescia.|$|R
25|$|Firstly {{introduced}} in the 1970s as a celebration of potato as the main local agricultural produce, the Gnocchi's Festival (in Italian, Sagra degli <b>Gnocchi)</b> is a typical mid-August event in San Lorenzo Nuovo. The town's main square {{is transformed into a}} large, open-air restaurant where the visitors can taste potato <b>gnocchi,</b> and other typical local recipes such as pigskin beans, tripe, and roasted sausages. A special atmosphere is created by liscio and rock orchestras in the context of cultural, sporting and religious (patron saint day and Assumption of Mary) events.|$|E
25|$|On the Season 1 finale, it was {{revealed}} that Paulie's campaign against <b>gnocchi</b> began when his parents both ordered it at a restaurant, thinking it was pasta, and died from potato allergies.|$|E
25|$|The {{above-mentioned}} dishes {{have developed}} a distinctively Argentine nuance. That is why, for example, Argentine pasta includes {{a wide variety of}} dishes ranging from spaghetti, fusiles (fusilli), ñoquis (<b>gnocchi),</b> ravioli, cintas (pasta ribbons), and lasagne to the Argentine-made sorrentinos, agnolottis (agnolotti), canelones (cannelloni), and fetuchines (fetuchini).|$|E
2500|$|David Fallows, in {{his article}} on [...] "spoof articles" [...] in the 2001 New Grove, cites <b>Gnocchi's</b> unusual career, {{singularly}} titled and voluminous works, and [...] "lugubrious" [...] portrait (in Die Musik in Geschichte und Gegenwart) {{as an example of}} why spoof articles do not need to exist in music encyclopedias: there are already musicians so strange that spoofs would be superfluous.|$|R
5000|$|On 23 March 2007, at 52 {{years of}} age, he finally signed a three-month {{contract}} with Parma, his favourite Serie A team, for a yearly wage of €18,000, the minimum salary allowed in Italy {{for a professional}} footballer. He chose to wear the #52 shirt, referring to his age, with the name [...] "Gnoccao", a spoof on Brazilian footballers based on his name. He was initially expected to make his debut {{on the day of}} the last league match, 27 May 2007, against Empoli. However, as Parma was still involved in the relegation battle, <b>Gnocchi's</b> Serie A debut did not happen. He made his debut with the Parma jersey on 31 May in a friendly match against Carpenedolo.|$|R
25|$|Italian staples, such as {{pizza and}} pasta, are eaten as {{commonly}} as beef. Fideos (noodles), tallarines (fettucine and tagliatelle), ñoquis (<b>gnocchi),</b> ravioles, and canelones (cannelloni) {{can be bought}} freshly made in many establishments in the larger cities. Italian-style ice cream is served in large parlours and even drive-through businesses.|$|E
25|$|First, {{the chef}} must prepare choux pastry dough, a light pastry dough {{used to make}} profiteroles, croquembouches, éclairs, French crullers, beignets, St. Honoré cake, quenelles, Parisian <b>gnocchi,</b> dumplings, gougères, chouquettes and craquelins. It {{contains}} only butter, water, flour and eggs. Instead of a raising agent, it employs high moisture content to create steam during cooking to puff the pastry. The pastry is used in many European and European-derived cuisines.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} scene, Rosie waits for Sam {{to come and}} cook dinner in her flat. Rosie tries on Joanna Rupelford's dresses. And the spanner in the works is that a woman keeps trying to contact Joanna, first by phone, and then in person. Rosie hurries her away, and the date itself works {{extremely}} well – so well, in fact, that Sam's hands-on demonstration with Rosie of how to roll <b>gnocchi</b> ends up with them kissing on the work surface.|$|E
25|$|In {{the north}} of Italy, in particular, in the Friuli region of the northeast, {{potatoes}} serve to make a type of pasta called <b>gnocchi.</b> Similarly, cooked and mashed potatoes or potato flour {{can be used in}} the Knödel or dumpling eaten with or added to meat dishes all over central and Eastern Europe, but especially in Bavaria and Luxembourg. Potatoes form one of the main ingredients in many soups such as the vichyssoise and Albanian potato and cabbage soup. In western Norway, komle is popular.|$|E
500|$|Italian Food {{begins with}} a chapter on [...] "The Italian store cupboard", giving British cooks, who at that time were {{generally}} unacquainted with most of Italy's cuisine and methods, an insight into Italian herbs, spices, tinned, bottled or dried staples including anchovies, tuna, funghi, prosciutto, and chickpeas, and Italian essentials such as garlic and olive oil, both seldom seen in Britain in the early 1950s. The rest of the book follows the basic pattern of the earlier works, with chapters on soups, fish, meat, vegetables and sweets, {{with the addition of}} extra subjects relevant to Italian food, pasta asciuta, ravioli and <b>gnocchi,</b> rice, and Italian wine. In a description of the 2009 edition, the publisher wrote: ...|$|E
500|$|Sue Dyson and Roger McShane, {{reviewing}} {{the book on}} FoodTourist, call it the [...] "very antithesis" [...] of the elaborate haute cuisine of Marie-Antoine Carême, and note {{that it was one}} of the first cookery books to provide quantities, timings, and lists of ingredients. They find the recipe for Mulligatawny soup [...] "wonderful", the oyster sausages [...] "very tasty", and the [...] "Potato Boulettes" [...] like a French equivalent of <b>gnocchi.</b> But [...] "the section that really caught our interest" [...] was puddings and desserts. They conclude that [...] "this is an inspirational book with an Aladdin's Cave of recipes and wonderful, timeless writing" [...] and an [...] "absolutely essential part of any serious cookbook collection." ...|$|E
500|$|Two further {{hardback}} {{selections of}} David's writings were published, with Norman as editor. At Elizabeth David's Table (2010) was published {{to mark the}} 60th anniversary of David's first book. With prefatory contributions from several prominent British chefs including Hopkinson, Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, Rose Gray and Jamie Oliver, it comprises recipes and essays from David's previously published works. There are twelve chapters, covering the various courses of a dinner from soups to desserts, and other topics such as baking, [...] cooking [...] "fast and fresh", and David's descriptions of French and Italian markets. [...] Elizabeth David on Vegetables (2013) [...] was drawn principally from Mediterranean Food, Italian Food, French Provincial Cooking and An Omelette and a Glass of Wine. There are sections on soups; small dishes; salads; pasta; <b>gnocchi</b> and polenta; rice; beans and lentils; main dishes; breads; and desserts.|$|E
500|$|Unlike its two predecessors, Mediterranean Food and French Country Cooking, David's Italian Food (1954) drew {{little from}} {{anything}} {{she had already}} written. She spent many months in Italy researching it before starting work on the manuscript. With two successful books already published, David felt less in need of extracts from earlier writers to bolster her prose, and interspersed the recipes with her own essays and introductions to the various sections. [...] The book [...] begins with a chapter on [...] "The Italian store cupboard", giving British cooks, who at that time were generally unacquainted with most of Italy's cuisine and methods, an insight into Italian herbs, spices, tinned, bottled or dried staples including anchovies, tuna, funghi, prosciutto, and chickpeas, and Italian essentials such as garlic and olive oil, both seldom seen in Britain in the early 1950s.

2500|$|Something of a polymath, {{he wrote}} {{on a wide}} array of topics in history, {{geography}} and archaeology in addition to composing music and performing his duties as a priest. [...] He produced a treatise on memorial tablets in the Brescia region, as well as a 25-volume history of ancient Greek colonies; both of these <b>Gnocchi</b> sold to Prince Faustino Lechi of Brescia, who was a student, and later friend and patron of <b>Gnocchi.</b>|$|E
2500|$|After {{the end of}} World War II, Poland {{fell under}} Soviet / Communist occupation. Some {{restaurants}} were nationalized. The communists envisioned a net of lunch rooms called [...] "bufet" [...] for the workers at various companies, and milk bars for the public. The majority of restaurants that survived the 1940s and 1950s were state-owned. Workplace lunch rooms promoted mostly inexpensive meals, including soups of all kinds, meatballs and pork chops, and staples such as placki ziemniaczane (potato pancakes), placki z jablkami (apple pancakes), kopytka (potato <b>gnocchi),</b> leniwe (farmer's cheese <b>gnocchi</b> served sweet) and pierogi. A typical second course consisted of meat cutlet served with potatoes or buckwheat and [...] "surówka" [...] (raw, julienned vegetables). The popular Polish kotlet schabowy is a breaded cutlet similar to the Austrian Wiener schnitzel and the Italian and Spanish Milanesa.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Gnocchi</b> {{was greatly}} {{interested}} {{in history and}} geography, and these interests show in the titles of his compositions, {{many of which are}} highly eccentric: [...] a Magnificat, Il capo di buona speranza (The Cape of Good Hope), and masses named [...] "Europe", [...] "America", [...] "Africa", and [...] "Asia" [...] are characteristic.|$|E
2500|$|Pietro <b>Gnocchi</b> (February 27, 1689 – December 9, 1775) was an Italian composer, choir director, historian, and {{geographer}} of {{the late}} Baroque era, active mainly in Brescia, where he was choir director of Brescia Cathedral. [...] In addition to composing an abundance of eccentrically-titled sacred music, all of which remains in manuscript, he wrote a 25-volume history of ancient Greek colonies.|$|E
2500|$|Varenne {{also raised}} money for {{disabled}} children. [...] The proceeds of his 2002 victory at the “Premio Mario Locatelli” went entirely to charity for the Carlo <b>Gnocchi</b> Italian center. These proceeds helped complete the project on [...] "Cascina Linterno" [...] in Milan that provided a range of services for people with disabilities, including an equestrian facility for the rehabilitation of people with physical and mental disabilities, through horse therapy.|$|E
2500|$|The {{principal}} {{source for}} information on Gnocchi's life is an unpublished manuscript written by his associate C. Cristoni, now in the Biblioteca Civica Queriniana in Brescia. [...] <b>Gnocchi</b> was born in Alfianello, in the Province of Brescia. [...] The second {{of at least three}} sons of a middle-class family, he studied music and eventually became a priest. [...] Following the death of his younger brother he commenced a period of travel, initially studying music in Venice, and later going to Hungary, Vienna, and Munich; after these travels he returned to Brescia where he spent most of the remainder of his long life, devoting it to scholarly and musical pursuits.|$|E
2500|$|Pasta is also {{widespread}} in the Southern Cone, as well {{most of the rest}} of Brazil, mostly pervasive in the areas with mild to strong Italian roots, such as Central Argentina, and the eight southernmost Brazilian states (where macaroni are called macarrão, and more general pasta is under the umbrella term massa, literally [...] "dough", together with some Japanese noodles, such as bifum rice vermicelli and yakisoba, which also entered general taste). The local names for the pasta are many times varieties of the Italian names, such as ñoquis/nhoque for <b>gnocchi,</b> ravioles/ravióli for ravioli, or tallarines/talharim for tagliatelle, although some of the most popular pasta in Brazil, such as the parafuso ("screw", [...] "bolt"), a specialty of the country's pasta salads, are also way different both in name and format from its closest Italian relatives, in this case the fusilli.|$|E
2500|$|Common restoranes or restaurantes and rotiserias (grill restaurants) nearly {{anywhere}} in Argentina today serve (into the small hours) quickly prepared meals {{that in the}} course of the 20th century came to be known as minutas, [...] "short-order dishes." [...] Some of the dishes included in the category of minutas are milanesas, churrascos, bifes (beefsteaks), escalopes, tallarines, ravioles (ravioli), ñoquis (<b>gnocchi),</b> although some are very typical of locations that sell food: [...] "bifes" [...] and [...] "milanesas" [...] are served [...] "a caballo" [...] ("on horseback", with fried egg on top), [...] "milanesa completa" [...] (a milanesa with two fried eggs and French fries), [...] "revuelto Gramajo", [...] "colchón de arvejas" [...] (an omelette made with peas), [...] "suprema de pollo" [...] (chicken supreme, usually breaded as a milanesa), matambres, [...] "lengua a la vinagreta" [...] (pickled tongue), and [...] "sandwiches" [...] (sandwiches de miga) are made with sliced white bread, rather than, say, rolls.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Gnocchi</b> left an {{enormous}} amount of music, mostly sacred, but including some secular vocal music as well as some instrumental compositions. [...] None was published, and the only thing to emerge from a printer was the title page and dedication for a 12-volume set of masses, the Salmi brevi. [...] His compositions included 60 masses, many of which were Requiems, for four to eight voices, some with instruments; six Requiems, for two to four voices; six sets of Vespers for the entire church year, also for four to eight voices, with organ accompaniment; 12 settings of the Magnificat, for four voices; six settings of the Miserere, for four to eight voices; motets, hymns, and miscellaneous liturgical music. [...] In addition to the sacred music, he wrote some canzonette, and a body of instrumental music that includes a concerto for seven strings and basso continuo and three trio sonatas for two violins and basso continuo. [...] Stylistically his music borrows some traits from the Venetians, unsurprisingly considering that he studied there. [...] He uses double choirs in a homophonic texture, a style descended from the early Baroque Venetian School, rarely writing imitatively.|$|E
2500|$|Paulie (Raskopoulos), a {{young man}} of unknown Mediterranean heritage, dressed in a green-and-pink striped polo shirt, confronts various people to {{complain}} about what might be termed pedantic issues. For example, in his first appearance, he explains to a cashier at a store that <b>gnocchi</b> is actually made of potatoes, {{and should not be}} placed in the pasta aisle. Other complaints he made included wanting to change the nickname of the Australian soccer team because a [...] "socceroo" [...] isn't a real animal, and that George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four is [...] "incorrect" [...] because its events did not occur in 1984. [...] In a more recent episode, Paulie confronts the owner of an Adult Sex shop telling him that the [...] "edible undies" [...] should have a nutritional value printed on the box, just in case a vegan is starving to death and needs to know that there is no beef in them. At the end of each sketch Paulie recommends that the problem be solved by putting a sticker on the offending object, and assures the target of his complaint that [...] "I've got my eye on youse". Perhaps to prove a point, the scenarios are often shown later on in the episode.|$|E
