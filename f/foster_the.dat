5|$|For the French Byzantinologist Gilbert Dagron, Philip's Christianity is a legend—albeit a {{very old}} one—that intended, in a Late Roman/Early Byzantine context, to <b>foster</b> <b>the</b> idea of a Roman Empire that was Christian almost from the beginning, thereby melding Roman Imperial {{ideology}} and Christianism, and therefore offering a base for other later legends showing Roman emperors, beginning with Augustus , to be aware and/or sympathetic to Christian revelation, forming a legendary corpus that was brought together during the 6th century by the chronicler John Malalas.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to better understand, from a foster parent perspective, how the {{integration}} process of <b>the</b> <b>foster</b> child is carried out in <b>the</b> <b>foster</b> family. <b>The</b> purpose is to identify the challenges and success factors in the process. The study is based on a qualitative method. The data consist of interviews with six <b>foster</b> families. <b>The</b> study’s theoretical framework is mostly based on system theory and also on the theory of ambivalence. The results show that most of our families considered five factors to be important in order to facilitate the integration process. <b>The</b> <b>foster</b> family needs to bond with <b>the</b> <b>foster</b> child, let <b>the</b> <b>foster</b> child in into the family system, open up and be who they really are, respect each other and reserve time to be able to satisfy <b>the</b> needs of <b>foster</b> child. <b>The</b> results emphasize that <b>the</b> <b>foster</b> parents should treat <b>the</b> <b>foster</b> child in <b>the</b> same way as the biological child.   We have also been able to identify factors that may have an impact on integration, like the age of <b>the</b> <b>foster</b> child. Our results suggest that foster parents experience different varieties of ambivalence to both <b>the</b> <b>foster</b> child and <b>the</b> <b>foster</b> child's biological parents. Those children who have a poor relationship with their biological parents and are of relatively young age tend to be over-integrated in <b>the</b> <b>foster</b> family...|$|R

5|$|Shorter hydroperiods {{of three}} or four months promote the growth of periphyton: algae and other {{microscopic}} organisms covered with calcium carbonate crystals. Periphyton is the basic building block of marl, a calcitic mud. In areas with hydroperiods of longer than nine months, peat builds up over hundreds or thousands of years due to many generations of decaying plant matter. Peat and marl are considered nutrient-poor soils that <b>foster</b> <b>the</b> growth of specialized vegetation depending on the length of the regional hydroperiod.|$|E

5|$|Environmental {{sociology}} is {{the study}} of human interactions with the natural environment, typically emphasizing human dimensions of environmental problems, social impacts of those problems, and efforts to resolve them. As with other sub-fields of sociology, scholarship in environmental sociology may be at one or multiple levels of analysis, from global (e.g. world-systems) to local, societal to individual. Attention is paid also to the processes by which environmental problems become defined and known to humans. As argued by notable environmental sociologist John Bellamy <b>Foster,</b> <b>the</b> predecessor to modern environmental sociology is Marx's analysis of the metabolic rift, which influenced contemporary thought on sustainability. Environmental sociology is often interdisciplinary and overlaps with the sociology of risk, rural sociology and the sociology of disaster.|$|E

5|$|The {{precursor}} to Arlene was first identified in satellite images as {{a cluster of}} disturbed weather east of the Mosquito Coast on June9. Over the following week, the system grew in expanse as it slowly tracked northwestward as strong wind shear in the area prohibited {{the development of a}} tropical cyclone. On June16, the formation of an upper-level low over the Bay of Campeche and the progression of a tropical wave across the Caribbean Sea helped <b>foster</b> <b>the</b> development of a low-pressure area over the Yucatán Peninsula. Although initially diffuse, new rainbands began to wrap around the new vortex's center, and at 0000UTC, the National Hurricane Center(NHC) classified the system as a tropical depression west of the Yucatán Peninsula. Although the storm was now considered a tropical cyclone, wind shear that had earlier inhibited development remained present, as well as the outflow of Tropical Storm Beatriz in the Eastern Pacific, disrupting the core of the infant tropical depression; aircraft reconnaissance often could not identify a defined center of circulation.|$|E
