40|$|For {{more than}} a decade, human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) {{have been used in}} bone tissue-engineering research. More {{recently}} some of the focus in this field has shifted towards the use of <b>embryonic</b> <b>stem</b> cells. While {{it is well known that}} hMSCs are able to form bone when implanted subcutaneously in immune-deficient mice, the osteogenic potential of <b>embryonic</b> <b>stem</b> cells has been mainly assessed in vitro. Therefore, we performed a series of studies to compare the in vitro and in vivo osteogenic capacities of <b>human</b> and mouse <b>embryonic</b> <b>stem</b> cells to those of hMSCs. <b>Embryonic</b> and mesenchymal <b>stem</b> cells showed all characteristic signs of osteogenic differentiation in vitro when cultured in osteogenic medium, including the deposition of a mineralized matrix and expression of genes involved in osteogenic differentiation. As such, based on the in vitro results, osteogenic ES cells could not be discriminated from osteogenic hMSCs. Nevertheless, although osteogenic hMSCs formed bone upon implantation, osteogenic cells derived from both <b>human</b> and mouse <b>embryonic</b> <b>stem</b> cells did not form functional bone, indicated by absence of osteocytes, bone marrow and lamellar bone.

40|$|SummaryConventional {{generation}} {{of stem cells}} from human blastocysts produces a developmentally advanced, or primed, stage of pluripotency. In vitro resetting to a more naive phenotype has been reported. However, whether the reset culture conditions of selective kinase inhibition can enable capture of naive epiblast cells directly from the embryo has not been determined. Here, we show that in these specific conditions individual inner cell mass cells grow into colonies that may then be expanded over multiple passages while retaining a diploid karyotype and naive properties. The cells express hallmark naive pluripotency factors and additionally display features of mitochondrial respiration, global gene expression, and genome-wide hypomethylation distinct from primed cells. They transition through primed pluripotency into somatic lineage differentiation. Collectively these attributes suggest classification as <b>human</b> naive <b>embryonic</b> <b>stem</b> cells. <b>Human</b> counterparts of canonical mouse <b>embryonic</b> <b>stem</b> cells would argue for conservation in the phased progression of pluripotency in mammals...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} {{determine}} whether <b>human</b> partheno-genetic <b>embryonic</b> <b>stem</b> (hpES) cells {{have the potential to}} differentiate into functional cells, a modified four‑step protocol was used to induce the hpES cells into islet-like clusters (ILCs) in vitro. Growth factors activin A, retinoic acid, nicotinamide, Exendin- 4 and betacellulin were added sequentially to the hpES cells at each step. The terminally differentiated cells were shown to gather into ILCs. Immunohistochemistry and semi quantitative polymerase chain reaction analyses demonstrated that the ILCs expressed islet specific hormones and functional markers. Furthermore, an insulin release test indicated that the clusters had the same physiological function as islets. The ILCs derived from hpES cells shared similar characteristics with islets. These results indicate that hpES cell-derived ILCs may be used as reliable material for the treatment of type I diabetes mellitus...|$|R
40|$|Animal life is {{controlled}} by neurons and in this setting cholinergic neurons play an important role. Cholinergic neurons release ACh, which via nicotinic and muscarinic receptors (n- and mAChRs) mediate chemical neurotransmission, a highly integrative process. Thus, the organism responds to external and internal stimuli to maintain and optimize survival and mood. Blockade of cholinergic neurotransmission is followed by immediate death. However, cholinergic communication has been established {{from the beginning of}} life in primitive organisms such as bacteria, algae, protozoa, sponge and primitive plants and fungi, irrespective of neurons. Tubocurarine- and atropine-sensitive effects are observed in plants indicating functional significance. All components of the cholinergic system (ChAT, ACh, n- and mAChRs, high-affinity choline uptake, esterase) have been demonstrated in mammalian non-neuronal cells, including those of <b>humans.</b> <b>Embryonic</b> <b>stem</b> cells (mice), epithelial, endothelial and immune cells synthesize ACh, which via differently expressed patterns of n- and mAChRs modulates cell activities to respond to internal or external stimuli. This helps to maintain and optimize cell function, such as proliferation, differentiation, formation of a physical barrier, migration, and ion and water movements. Blockade of n- and mACHRs on non-innervated cells causes cellular dysfunction and/or cell death. Thus, cholinergic signalling in non-neuronal cells is comparable to cholinergic neurotransmission. Dysfunction of the non-neuronal cholinergic system is involved in the pathogenesis of diseases. Alterations have been detected in inflammatory processes and a pathobiologic role of non-neuronal ACh in different diseases is discussed. The present article reviews recent findings about the non-neuronal cholinergic system in humans...|$|R
