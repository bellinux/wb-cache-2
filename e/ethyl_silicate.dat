50|$|The , {{also known}} as the , uses a mixture of {{refractory}} aggregate, hydrolyzed <b>ethyl</b> <b>silicate,</b> alcohol, and a gelling agent to create a mold. This slurry mixture is poured into a slightly tapered flask and a reusable pattern (i.e. the item used to create the shape of the mold) is used. The slurry hardens almost immediately to a rubbery state (the consistency of vulcanized rubber). The flask and pattern is then removed. Then a torch is used to ignite the mold, which causes most of the volatiles to burn-off and the formation of ceramic microcrazes (microscopic cracks). These cracks are important, because they allow gases to escape while preventing the metal from flowing through; they also ease thermal expansion and contraction during solidification and shrinkage. After the burn-off, the mold is baked at 1800 F to remove any remaining volatiles. Prior to pouring metal, the mold is pre-warmed to control shrinkage.|$|E

5000|$|In 1946, Fogel {{moved to}} Austin, Texas where he {{accepted}} a teaching position at The University of Texas at Austin. He became {{an integral part}} of the Texas Modernism movement, along with such artists as Kelly Fearing, Lester and Charles Umlauf. In Texas he executed what have been considered the first abstract murals in the state for the American National Bank (1954), which was recognized by Time Magazine as one of the year's most significant achievements in corporate art, the Baptist Student Center at the University of Texas (1949), the First National Bank in Waco (1955), the First Christian Church in Houston (1956) and the Petroleum Club, also in Houston (1950).

5000|$|Laboratory syntheses of {{kaolinite}} at {{room temperature}} and atmospheric pressure have been described by DeKimpe et al. (1961). [...] From those tests the role of periodicity becomes convincingly clear. For DeKimpe et al. (1961) had used daily additions of alumina (as AlCl3 + 6 H2O) and silica (in the form of <b>ethyl</b> <b>silicate)</b> during at least two months. In addition adjustments of the pH took place every day by way of adding either hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide. Such daily additions of Si and Al to the solution {{in combination with the}} daily titrations with hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide during at least 60 days will have introduced the necessary element of periodicity. Only now the actual role of what has been described as the “aging” (Alterung) of amorphous alumino-silicates (as for example Harder, 1978 [...] had noted) can be fully understood. For time as such is not bringing about any change in a closed system at equilibrium, but a series of alternations, of periodically changing conditions (by definition taking place in an open system), will bring about the low-temperature formation of {{more and more of the}} stable phase kaolinite instead of (ill-defined) amorphous alumino-silicates.|$|E

5000|$|Apply {{investment}} materials: The ceramic mould, {{known as}} the investment, is produced by repeating a series of steps—coating, stuccoing, and hardening—until a desired thickness is achieved. Coating involves dipping a pattern cluster into a slurry of fine refractory material and then draining to create a uniform surface coating. Fine materials are used in this first step, also called a prime coat, to preserve fine details from the mould. Stuccoing applies coarse ceramic particles by dipping patterns into a fluidised bed, placing it in a rainfall-sander, or by applying materials by hand. Hardening allows coatings to cure. These steps are repeated until the investment reaches its required thickness—usually 5 to 15 mm. Investment moulds are left to dry completely, which can take 16 to 48 hours. Drying can be accelerated by applying a vacuum or minimizing environmental humidity. Investment moulds can also be created by placing the pattern clusters into a flask and then pouring liquid investment material from above. The flask is then vibrated to allow entrapped air to escape and help the investment material fill any small voids. [...] Common refractory materials used to create the investments are: silica, zircon, various aluminium silicates, and alumina. Silica is usually used in the fused silica form, but sometimes quartz is used because it is less expensive. Aluminium silicates are a mixture of alumina and silica, where commonly used mixtures have an alumina content from 42 to 72%; at 72% alumina the compound is known as mullite. During the primary coat(s), zircon-based refractories are commonly used, because zirconium {{is less likely to}} react with the molten metal. Prior to silica, a mixture of plaster and ground up old molds (chamotte) was used. The binders used to hold the refractory material in place include: <b>ethyl</b> <b>silicate</b> (alcohol-based and chemically set), colloidal silica (water-based, also known as silica sol, set by drying), sodium silicate, and a hybrid of these controlled for pH and viscosity.|$|E

Two treatments were considered in this thesis: a plain <b>ethyl</b> <b>silicate</b> (Prosoco OH 100), and an elastified <b>ethyl</b> <b>silicate</b> (Remmers KSE 300 E). The performance of each treatment was compared through laboratory testing of the following properties: water absorption and drying, water vapor permeability, color changes, scanning electron microscopy, and drilling resistance measurements. Testing showed that both treatments increased the hardness of the stone, however the stone treated with Conservare OH 100 exhibited the greatest increase. Both treatments changed the wetting and drying behavior and the water vapor transmission, with the Remmers KSE 300 E treatment altering the stone slightly more. Through scanning electron microscopy it was shown that both consolidants showed poor adhesion to mineral grains and that Remmers KSE 300 E provided a more uniform coverage than Prosoco OH 100. The application of the latter darkened the surface color of the stone.

40|$|Glycerol ethers {{have the}} {{potential}} to be used as additives with biodiesel as it can be easily blended and can improve fuel performance. It also facilitates easier passing of fuel through injector. Addition of glycerol ether increases the cetane number and improves the antiknocking property. Glycerol ethers are produced by reacting glycerol with tert-butanol (TBA). To initiate the etherification reaction between two alcohols (glycerol and tert-butanol) on solid acid catalyst, acidity of catalyst is one of the primary requirement since the production of protonated molecules in the reaction mixture is crucial. In this work, acidic solid catalysts were developed by the impregnation of heteropolyacids (HPA, H 3 PW 12 O 40) on SBA- 15 support. The SBA – 15 was prepared by hydrothermal method using P 123 polymer, HCl, water and tetra <b>ethyl</b> ortho <b>silicate</b> (TEOS). Textural properties of the support were determined using N 2 – physisorption method and {{it was found that the}} surface area, pore volume and average pore diameters were 819 m 2 /g, 1. 14 cc/g and 5. 02 nm, respectively. The pore volume can accommodate higher amount of HPA. HPA is acidic in nature and impregnation of HPA on support can develop the acidic functional groups. Generally, HPA is highly soluble in alcohol and addition of Cesium (Cs) can exchange the proton from HPA and inhibit the solubility by the formation of CsxH 3 -xPW 12 O 40. Three different catalyst samples were prepared by changing the Cesium (x) wt% (for x = 1. 5, 2. 2 and 2. 9) on SBA- 15 using incipient wetness method. These samples were dried at 120 ˚C for 2 hours and then calcined at 300 ˚C for 3 hours. The catalysts were characterized by N 2 physisorption, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), elemental analysis (inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy, ICP-MS), thermogravimetric/differential thermal analyzer (TG/DTA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and temperature programmed desorption of ammonia (NH 3 -TPD). The progressive reduction in textural properties of the support with HPA loading is identified in BET-Surface area. The enhancement of functional groups is indicated in FTIR. And also the change in crystalline nature is identified in XRD. The screened catalyst was used for etherification of glycerol. Etherification of glycerol with TBA was performed in 100 ml autoclave and the product consists of mono, di and tri-tert butyl glycerol ethers along with some unreacted glycerol. The effects of various reaction parameters such as temperature, catalyst loading and molar ratio (glycerol/TBA) were studied to obtain an optimized condition for etherification of glycerol.

This behavior is explained in terms of diffusion control through the film of zinc corrosion products around the zinc particles. The effect of these corrosion products on the coating's electrochemical activity is discussed. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|In {{the work}} there are {{presented}} {{the results of}} studying the filtering elements weight changes when heated. For all the variants of filtering elements at the primary stages of heating there is characteristic increasing their linear dimensions due to their thermal expansion. It was established that using hydrolyzed <b>ethyl</b> <b>silicate</b> as a binder, as well as water solution of liquid glass with addition of aluminum powder in the refractory material permits to obtain filtering elements without high-temperature solid-phase sintering...|$|E
