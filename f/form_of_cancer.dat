5|$|In 1978, Feynman sought medical {{treatment}} for abdominal pains and {{was diagnosed with}} liposarcoma, a rare <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>cancer.</b> Surgeons removed a tumor {{the size of a}} football that had crushed one kidney and his spleen. Further operations were performed in October 1986 and October 1987. He was again hospitalized at the UCLA Medical Center on February3, 1988. A ruptured duodenal ulcer caused kidney failure, and he declined to undergo the dialysis that might have prolonged his life for a few months. Watched over by his wife Gweneth, sister Joan, and cousin Frances Lewine, he died on February15, 1988.|$|E
5|$|On November 12, 1976, as Fox {{was driving}} to the family home at Morrill Street in Port Coquitlam, he became distracted by nearby bridge construction, and crashed {{into the back of}} a pickup truck. While his car was left undriveable, Fox emerged with only a sore right knee. He again felt pain in December, but chose to ignore it until the end of {{basketball}} season. By March 1977, the pain had intensified and he finally went to a hospital, where he was diagnosed with osteosarcoma, a <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>cancer</b> that often starts near the knees. Fox believed his car accident weakened his knee and left it vulnerable to the disease, though his doctors argued there was no connection. He was told that his leg had to be amputated, he would require chemotherapy treatment, and that recent medical advances meant he had a 50-percent chance of survival. Fox learned that two years before, the figure would have been only 15 percent; the improvement in survival rates impressed on him the value of cancer research.|$|E
5|$|On 27 May, 41-year old former Welsh {{international}} Rob Edwards {{was appointed}} new Tranmere Rovers manager with John McMahon {{staying at the}} club as assistant manager. It was the first managerial experience for Edwards, who had been an assistant at Exeter City previously. The next day, the first signing was made – 22-year old Welsh striker Eliot Richards signed a two-year contract. He was followed by his Bristol Rovers teammate midfielder Matthew Gill. Previously Gill had spent three seasons with Exeter, winning back-to-back promotions from the Conference National and League Two together with Edwards. Further Edwards signings were young central defender Michael Ihiekwe from Wolverhampton Wanderers, ex-Rotherham United striker Kayode Odejayi, 24-year old defender Marcus Holness from Burton Albion, Scottish midfielder Marc Laird released by Southend United and 30-year old defender Danny Woodards, while Evan Horwood cancelled his contract with Tranmere Rovers by mutual consent to return to Northampton Town, where he had spent end of the previous season on loan. On 4 August, ex-Tranmere Rovers player Joe Thompson had been signed by Bury. The midfielder was sidelined since November 2013 when {{he was diagnosed with}} a rare <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>cancer.</b> In June he was given the all-clear after completing a course of chemotherapy, but he had not been contacted to negotiate a new contract with Tranmere Rovers.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In {{the last}} few years boron (B) {{compounds}} became increasingly frequent in the chemotherapy <b>of</b> some <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>cancer</b> with high malignancy and <b>of</b> inoperable <b>cancers.</b> As more B-based therapy chemicals are developed it is necessary to review the correlation between B and the incidence <b>of</b> different <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>cancer,</b> the biochemical and molecular mechanisms influenced by B and to explore the relevance of B in the chemoprevention <b>of</b> <b>cancer.</b> This minireview analyzes dietary and therapeuptic principles based on the chemistry of B compounds. We summarize studies correlating B-rich diets or B-rich environments with regional risks <b>of</b> specific <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>cancers,</b> and studies about the utilization of natural and synthetic B-containing compounds as anticancer agents. We review mechanisms where B-containing compounds interfere with the physiology and reproduction <b>of</b> <b>cancer</b> cells. Types <b>of</b> <b>cancers</b> most frequently impacted by B-containing compounds include prostate, breast, cervical and lung cancer. Mechanisms involving B activity on cancer cells are based on the inhibition of a variety of enzymatic activities, including serine proteases, NAD-dehydrogenases, mRNA splicing and cell division, but also receptor binding mimicry, and the induction of apoptosis. Boron-enriched diets resulted in significant decrease in the risk for pros-tate and cervical cancer, and decrease in lung cancer in smoking women. Boron-based compounds show promising effects for the che-motheraphy <b>of</b> specific <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>cancer,</b> but due to specific benefits should also be included in cancer chemopreventive strategies...|$|R
