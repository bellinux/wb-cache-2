Even when wine bottles are stored on their sides, one side of the cork is still exposed to air. Should the cork begin to dry out, it can allow oxygen to enter the bottle, filling the ullage space and possibly causing the wine to spoil or oxidize. Excessive humidity can also pose the risk of damaging wine labels, which may hinder identification or hurt potential resale value. Wine experts such as Jancis Robinson note that 75% humidity is often cited as ideal but also that there is very little significant research to definitively establish an optimal range. Concern about humidity is one of the primary reasons why wine experts such as Tom Stevenson recommend that wine should not be kept in a refrigerator since the refrigeration process often includes dehumidifying, which can quickly dry out corks.|$|E

6000|$|Certain {{relations}} between locality and coloration {{have long been}} noticed. Mr. Gould observed that birds from inland or continental localities were more brightly coloured than those living near the sea-coast or on islands, and he supposed that the more brilliant atmosphere of the inland stations was the explanation of the phenomenon.[90] Many American naturalists have observed similar facts, and they assert that {{the intensity of the}} colours of birds and mammals increases from north to south, and also with the increase of humidity. This change is imputed by Mr. J.A. Allen to the direct action of the environment. He says: [...] "In respect to the correlation of intensity of colour in animals with the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>humidity,</b> it would perhaps be more in accordance with cause and effect to express the law of correlation as a decrease of intensity of colour with a decrease of humidity, the paleness evidently resulting from exposure and the blanching effect of intense sunlight, and a dry, often intensely heated atmosphere. With the decrease of the aqueous precipitation the forest growth and the protection afforded by arborescent vegetation gradually also decreases, as of course does also the protection afforded by clouds, the excessively humid regions being also regions of extreme cloudiness, while the dry regions are comparatively cloudless districts."[91] Almost identical changes occur in birds, and are imputed by Mr. Allen to similar causes.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate the influence of types of drying on seeds' quality, as recalcitrant, Ocotea puberula and determine their <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> critical <b>humidity</b> and lethal degree. Seeds harvested in Brunópolis, SC, with an initial moisture content of 38 %, were dried to 18 %, with gradients of 2 %; using the equation of target weight to ensure that gradient in the stove (35 oC) and in a desiccator with silica gel (25 oC). After drying, the seeds were evaluated for water content, percentage and germination speed index (GSI), tetrazolium and T 50. It was observed that up to 32 % water content did not change in seed quality, regardless {{of the type of}} drying and verified significant loss of germination after this value. We conclude that the type of drying does not affect the quality of the seed; however, because it is a recalcitrant seed, reducing the water content below 32 % decreased germination, and its <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> critical <b>humidity</b> and seeds with 22 % moisture content had no germination in this study is the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> lethal <b>humidity</b> <b>of</b> this species...|$|R

50|$|Relative {{humidity}} {{is high in}} the Philippines. A {{high amount}} of moisture or vapor in the air makes hot temperatures feel hotter. This quantity of moisture is due to different factors - the extraordinary evaporation from the seas that surrounds the country on all sides, to the different prevailing winds in the different seasons of the year, and finally, to the abundant rains so common in a tropical country. The first may be considered as general causes of the great humidity, which is generally observed in all the islands throughout the year.

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} air warming and humidification, we examined the spirometric responses before and after exposure to a conditioned airsteam.

As heat increased, airflow progressively improved in asthmatic persons as a group. In contrast, patients with chronic bronchitis, who had more severe underlying airflow obstruction, had most improved airflow with warm dry air inhalation and showed less improvement as humidity was added isothermally. We conclude that active warming of air before inhalation can improve airflow significantly in some patients with reactive obstructed airways, and that high <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>humidity</b> may exert an independent adverse effect in persons with chronic bronchitis or in those with serious airflow obstruction...|$|R

40|$|This article {{brings an}} {{analysis}} of the wood supply in a cellulose pulp industry and highlights the influence <b>of</b> wood <b>humidity</b> in its transportation costs. In its natural state, wood contains a high level <b>of</b> <b>humidity</b> that is undesirable in various industrial processing. Regarding the cellulose production, humidity increases the wood weight and, consequently, the transportation costs. The evaporation <b>of</b> the <b>humidity</b> excess, before moving the wood to the industrial plant, is an alternative to overcome this problem. The focus undertaken here is to find the number of stock days that the wood takes in the natural evaporation to reach around 35 % humidity, which gives the minimum logistic cost of transportation. The computation of the safety stock required in the production of bleached hardwood eucalyptus pulp was also considered. In order to obtain the optimum drying time of the wood in the field, a data collection was carried out, concerning various <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>humidity</b> evaporation. Data used were obtained at Aracruz Celulose S. A., a Brazilian cellulose pulp industry, and comprised wood density as a function of evaporation time, freight costs, transport distances, daily stock, among others. As expected, the analysis carried out showed a decrease in wood density due to evaporation during the first three weeks and then remains constant, while the stock of the wood in the field keeps increasing with the time. A safety stock 39 % smaller than the actual observed was found...|$|R

A linear elastic fracture mechanics approach was applied to characterize the material fracture behavior in dry conditions, whereas, because of the considerable ductility exhibited by the samples in the wet state, an elastic–plastic approach based on the essential work of fracture methodology was employed. In the absence of rubber, the presence of silicate layers makes the material fracture resistance decrease relative to neat polymer, depending on the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>humidity.</b> The {{results showed that the}} toughening action of rubber strongly depends on the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>humidity</b> of the material, at least for the rubber contents considered in this study (lower than 10 wt %).
