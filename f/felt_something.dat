Bright has stated that, while too late for the planned release of Guitar Hero 5, they are looking towards future instrument controller interoperability, including use of the DJ Hero controller into gameplay for future Guitar Hero titles, or using drum controllers within DJ Hero.|$|E

During {{the third}} meeting, on 29 March 1990, Icke <b>felt</b> <b>something</b> like a spider's web on his face, and Shine {{told him she}} had a message from Wang Ye Lee of the spirit world. Icke {{had been sent to}} heal the Earth, she said, and would become famous but would face opposition. The spirit world was going to pass ideas to him, which he would speak about to others. He would write five books in three years; in 20 years a new flying machine would allow us to go {{wherever}} we wanted and time would have no meaning; and there would be earthquakes in unusual places, because the inner earth was being destabilized by having oil taken from the seabed.|$|E

5|$|Lydia first {{appears in}} March 2009 {{as a friend}} of Josh Ashworth (Sonny Flood). She orders Steph Cunningham (Carley Stenson) to fire Sarah after her sister Persephone Hart tells her that Sarah hit her. Theresa McQueen (Jorgie Porter) steals Lydia's handbag and she accuses Josh's girlfriend Amy Barnes (Ashley Slanina-Davies). She decides not to press charges against Theresa. Amy accuses Lydia and Josh of having an affair. Josh tells her she is a lesbian and Amy hits her. Amy later apologises, however is still jealous of Lydia and Josh's relationship. At Josh's {{birthday}} party, Michaela McQueen (Hollie-Jay Bowes) assumes that Lydia and Sarah are a couple. Sarah and Lydia then become friends. In late March, after agreeing to dance with Sarah during one of the classes, Lydia kisses her. Sarah denies it when Lydia claims that they <b>felt</b> <b>something.</b> Sarah then shows more of an interest in Lydia.|$|E
25|$|Dalkowski {{was invited}} to major league spring {{training}} in 1963, and the Orioles expected to call {{him up to the}} majors. On March 23, Dalkowski was used as a relief pitcher during a game against the New York Yankees. Most sources say that while throwing a slider to Phil Linz, he <b>felt</b> <b>something</b> pop in his left elbow, {{which turned out to be}} a severe muscle strain. Some uncertainty over the cause of his injury exists, however, with other sources contending that he damaged his elbow while throwing to first after fielding a bunt from Yankees pitcher Jim Bouton. Either way, his arm never fully recovered.|$|E
25|$|There are early {{hints that}} Seishirō {{may not be}} all that he appears. Hokuto jokes about him {{being a member of}} the family of Sakurazukamori, a clan of assassins who use onmyōjitsu to kill, and are {{pronounced}} to be the Sumeragis' opposite. Also, Subaru has dreams about having met someone under a cherry tree blooming out of season when he was but a small child, but he cannot quite recall what was being said. This person was actually Seishirō, upon whom Subaru stumbled when he had just performed a kill. According to the rules of the Sakurazukamori, Seishirō should have killed him, but impressed with the child's purity, he made a bet with him instead: He would meet Subaru again, and would then spend one year with him, protecting him and trying to love him. If, at the end of that year, he <b>felt</b> <b>something</b> for Subaru which distinguished him from a thing he could easily destroy, as he could not with any other person, then he would not kill him. To recognize him, he marked him with inverted pentagrams on both hands, the sign of the Sakurazukamori's prey. These marks are for most of the story hidden beneath the gloves Subaru continually wears on the direction of his grandmother, the previous family head, who recognized the marks and so hopes to conceal them with her magic.|$|E

Jackie and Teddy give Silver her half-birthday by recreating the previous half-birthdays that Jackie couldn't attend because of her alcoholism. Later, Jackie is hospitalized, during which time Kelly and Jackie reconcile before Jackie dies. Navid witnesses Adrianna buying drugs from Jasper which causes him to confront them. Liam finally confides to Dixon, Teddy and Ivy about the events on prom night as they try {{to figure out a way}} to get revenge on Jen.

Teddy begins to pursue Silver more and they share a kiss on the rooftop of the school. Teddy asks Silver out to the dance, but she declines. Navid is hospitalized when Jasper pushes him down the stairs at school because he finds out that Navid is telling people that he is a drug dealer. Navid remembers that it was Jasper who pushed him down the stairs and is determined to let Annie know he is a drug dealer. Navid asks Adrianna to admit to Annie that she bought drugs from Jasper. After Dixon realizes that Jen is the one who slept with Liam and not Annie, he opts to help Annie. Naomi also feels bad for Annie when she learns the truth about prom night. At the dance, Teddy and Silver share a kiss. Silver storms off but later admits to Naomi that she <b>felt</b> <b>something</b> when they kissed. Just as Silver is about to tell Teddy that she wants to give it a shot, she sees him hugging a girl, not knowing it is Teddy's sister. Dixon reveals to Silver that he still has feelings for her, after which he lies and says that he did not know who the girl was that Teddy was embracing.

500|$|... "Rehab" [...] is a mid-tempo R ballad with {{a subtle}} backbeat. According to the digital sheet music {{published}} by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, {{it is written}} in the key of G minor and set in common time, with a moderately slow groove. The vocal range spans nearly an octave {{and a half from}} F3 to B4. [...] "Rehab" [...] opens with a string section, played by Stevie Blacke, and a violin, cello, and tambourine instrumental groove with Hannon Lane's keyboard melody. Rihanna then sings the opening lines, [...] "Baby, baby, when we first met, I never <b>felt</b> <b>something</b> so strong".|$|E
500|$|... "My Prerogative" [...] {{is a song}} by American singer Bobby Brown {{from his}} second studio album Don't Be Cruel (1988). It was {{released}} on October 11, 1988 as the second single from the album. After recording sessions for the album were completed, Brown and producer Gene Griffin travelled to New York City, since he <b>felt</b> <b>something</b> was [...] "missing" [...] from the record. [...] "My Prerogative" [...] was written by Brown {{as a response to}} the criticism he received for his departure from New Edition. He explained the song was about making decisions in one's life and not caring about other people's judgment. [...] "My Prerogative" [...] is often considered a new jack swing anthem, and contains many elements from Teddy Riley productions due to his involvement as one of the song's session musicians.|$|E
500|$|Brown {{had already}} {{completed}} recording sessions for Don't Be Cruel in Los Angeles, California, but <b>felt</b> <b>something</b> was {{missing in the}} record. He said, [...] "I felt my album was lacking a strong, aggressive song and I thought, 'Where better than New York {{to come up with}} it'". He travelled to the city with producer Gene Griffin. [...] "My Prerogative" [...] was written and co-produced by Brown and Griffin. It was recorded at Axis Studios and mixed at Soundworks, in New York. The track was mastered at Future Disc Systems in Hollywood, California. During an interview with The Hour on March 17, 1989, Brown explained the theme behind the song, saying, [...] "A lot of things had been said about Bobby Brown, why was he doing this [...] It's my way of expressing to people it's your prerogative to do as you want, but make sure what you do is the right thing". A CD single of remixes by Joe T. Vannelli was released on October 13, 1995.|$|E

500|$|Much of {{the music}} on Eat a Peach that was {{recorded}} after Duane's death directly dealt with the tragedy. [...] "Ain't Wastin' Time No More" [...] was written by Gregg Allman for his brother, Duane, immediately following his death. The song was composed on an 110-year-old Steinway piano in Studio D of Criteria. [...] "Ain't Wastin'" [...] was composed when Duane was still alive, but the lyrics deal with his passing, as well as veterans coming home from the Vietnam War. The song relates to the theme that [...] "death is an inescapable inevitability — that every day is precious." [...] "Les Brers in A Minor" [...] is an instrumental penned by Dickey Betts, and its title is [...] "bad French" [...] for [...] "less brothers." [...] When writing the song, all in the band <b>felt</b> <b>something</b> was familiar about the song; {{it turned out to}} be a solo of Betts's from live renditions of [...] "Whipping Post." [...] It resurfaced many years later on a bootleg recording. [...] "Les Brers" [...] began recording in the newly constructed Studio C of the recording complex at Criteria, but the band disliked the sound captured in the room and moved to Studio A. As a result, the recording contains a slight pitch variation due to the difficulty of matching the original speed of the instruments when the intro was spliced onto the master tape.|$|E
500|$|On June 1, 1978, {{following}} the monthly meeting of general {{authorities in the}} Salt Lake Temple, Kimball asked his counselors and the ten members of Quorum of the Twelve Apostles then present to remain behind for a special meeting. Kimball began by describing his studies, thoughts, and prayers on removing the restriction and on his growing assurance that {{the time had come}} for the change. Kimball asked each of the men present to share their views, and all spoke in favor of changing the policy. After all present had shared their views, Kimball led the gathered apostles in a prayer circle to seek final divine approval for the change. As Kimball prayed, many in the group recorded feeling a powerful spiritual confirmation. Bruce R. McConkie later said: [...] "There are no words to describe the sensation, but simultaneously the Twelve and the three members of the First Presidency had the Holy Ghost descend upon them and they knew that God had manifested his will.... I had had some remarkable spiritual experiences before... but nothing of this magnitude." [...] L. Tom Perry described: [...] "I <b>felt</b> <b>something</b> like the rushing of wind. There was a feeling that came over the whole group. When President Kimball got up he was visibly relieved and overjoyed." [...] Gordon B. Hinckley later said: [...] "For me, it felt as if a conduit opened between the heavenly throne and the kneeling, pleading prophet of God who was joined by his Brethren." ...|$|E
500|$|Les Bowie {{provided}} the special effects: {{he had made}} his name perfecting an improved technique for matte painting, called the delineating matte, and formed a company with Vic Margutti that specialised in matte effects. Bowie provided a number of matte paintings to enhance the scale of certain key shots in the film, including the crashed rocket, the Westminster Abbey set and the shot of Quatermass walking away from the Abbey at the climax of the movie. Partly because of the concerns raised by the BBFC and partly on account of the low budget, Val Guest kept the creature largely off-screen for much of the film, feeling that audiences' imaginations would fill in the blanks more effectively than he and the special effects team could deliver on-screen. For the climactic scenes at Westminster Abbey, however, Bowie created a monster from tripe and rubber and photographed it against a model of the Abbey. Sparks and fireworks were used for the shots of the creature being electrocuted. Michael Carreras <b>felt</b> <b>something</b> was missing when he viewed the first cut of this scene: he said, [...] "There was this great glob of something hanging about on the scaffolding. And they had put in the best music they could and put the best effects on it, but it meant nothing as far as I was concerned… absolutely nothing at all". An eye was added to the model of the monster and a human scream added to the soundtrack to give the creature some semblance of humanity in its final moments. Models were also used for the rocket blasting off in the final shot of the film.|$|E

500|$|A {{group of}} four or five {{teenagers}} aged between 14 and 16 claim to have been playing near a cave in Cerro Azul, Panama when the creature emerged. They say that it approached them, and, fearing for their safety, they attacked the creature with sticks and rocks, killing it. They claim that they then threw its corpse into a pool of water before leaving the area. They later returned and took photographs of the creature's corpse, before sending the pictures to Telemetro, a Panamanian television station. Virginia Wheeler, writing for The Sun, claimed that the discovery [...] "sparked fear and confusion" [...] in the town. According to some sources, subsequent photographs were taken of the creature after it had further decomposed; however, doubts have been expressed about whether the later photos were of the same specimen. A few days after the photographs were taken, one of the teenagers gave a different account in an interview with Telemetro Reporta, saying [...] "I was in the river and I <b>felt</b> <b>something</b> grabbing my legs ... We took it {{out of the water and}} started throwing rocks and sticks at it. We had never seen anything like that." [...] The photographs show a pale creature that is mostly hairless, with a rubbery body. It has [...] "revolting features"; a snub-nose and long arms. Writers for the Huffington Post said that while the head is clearly animal, the torso is [...] "strange", while the limbs are reminiscent of thin human arms. Writers for WBALTV.com compared it to both a [...] "small, portly" [...] version of the alien in E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial and The Lord of the Ringss Gollum's [...] "long-lost cousin".|$|E
500|$|Oxbow drew post {{position}} {{five for}} the Haskell, carried the highest weight at 122 pounds, {{and was the}} second favorite in the race behind Verrazano. [...] Leading for {{the early part of}} the race, Oxbow was challenged for the lead by Verrazano at the three-quarter-mile marker, then weakened and finished fourth, earning another $60,000. Stevens <b>felt</b> <b>something</b> was wrong with Oxbow at the half-mile pole, later saying the horse [...] "didn’t feel like he did in any of the Triple Crown races", and Lukas stated the jockey [...] "kind of held" [...] Oxbow from that point on. Oxbow was pulled up soon after crossing the finish line, then his rider jumped off and removed the saddle when Oxbow failed to jog sound on the track. [...] The horse walked back to the barn without obvious sign of injury, and radiographs of his right front ankle revealed no fracture, but he did have a soft tissue injury to the area, described as a [...] "sprain". Of Oxbow's overall health, Lukas commented, [...] "he had a pretty set of X-rays. It's amazing. For a horse with that many , they were really clean." [...] Nonetheless, as a result of the soft tissue injury, Oxbow was taken out of races for the duration of the summer, and after three weeks of hand-walking at Saratoga was shipped home to Calumet in mid-August, with an announcement that he was not anticipated to run again in 2013. Lukas said: [...] "He's been a warrior and a hell of a nice horse for us and I don't want to do anything to jeopardize his future down the line." [...] On October 25, 2013, Calumet Farm announced the decision to retire Oxbow. Combined with his winnings in his two-year-old season, his lifetime race earnings were $1,243,500. [...] He stood at stud for the 2014 breeding season at [...] Taylor Made Farm in Lexington, Kentucky, for an introductory stud fee of $20,000. He closed out the year ranked 17th in earnings with $1,146,000 won in 2013. For the 2015 season he moves to Calumet Farms, where he joins seven other stallions, including English Channel, who sired 2014 Travers Stakes winner V.E. Day.|$|E
