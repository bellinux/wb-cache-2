5|$|Each title <b>focuses</b> on the {{extraordinary}} invading the ordinary world, {{though the two}} main Megami Tensei series focus on different things: Shin Megami Tensei <b>focuses</b> more on the main protagonist gaining the power needed {{to survive in a}} world ruled over by tyrannical deities, while Persona <b>focuses</b> on interpersonal relationships and the psychology of a group of people. That protagonist is generally male within the Shin Megami Tensei titles: while a female lead or the ability to choose a lead's gender is not out of the question, some staff feel that Shin Megami Tensei lead roles are better suited to a male character. Throughout its lifetime, the series has incorporated elements of Gnosticism, various world mythologies and religions including Christianity and Buddhism, early science fiction, Jungian psychology and archetypes, occultism, punk, and cyberpunk. The science fiction and fantasy elements are brought together and unified through the use of philosophical concepts, enabling a blending of concepts and aesthetics that might normally clash.|$|E

40|$|In Korean, <b>focus</b> is {{expressed}} in accentual phrasing. To ascertain whether words <b>focused</b> in this manner enjoy a processing advantage analogous to that conferred by <b>focus</b> as expressed in, e. g, English and Dutch, we devised sentences with target words in one of four conditions: prosodic <b>focus,</b> syntactic <b>focus,</b> prosodic + syntactic <b>focus,</b> and no <b>focus</b> as a control. 32 native speakers of Korean listened to blocks of 10 sentences, then were presented visually with words and asked {{whether or not they}} had heard them. Overall, words with <b>focus</b> were recognised significantly faster and more accurately than unfocused words. In addition, words with syntactic <b>focus</b> or syntactic + prosodic <b>focus</b> were recognised faster than words with prosodic <b>focus</b> alone. As for other languages, Korean <b>focus</b> confers processing advantage on the words carrying it.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{acoustic}} realization of single vs. double <b>focus</b> in statements and yes/no questions in General American English. Four speakers produced {{four sets of}} utterances of different lengths with alternating <b>focus</b> and sentence type conditions. Results indicate that double <b>focus</b> increases max F 0 and duration of the <b>focused</b> word to a similar degree as single <b>focus</b> in both statements and yes/no questions. Furthermore, post-focus pitch range suppression occurs in both single- and double-focused statements. However, in yes/no questions, post-focus pitch range compression and raising occur only after single <b>focus</b> and <b>focus</b> 2 of double <b>focus.</b> In contrast, F 0 after <b>focus</b> 1 of double <b>focus</b> falls gradually until the stressed syllable in <b>focus</b> 2 in yes/no questions. These findings suggest that double <b>focus</b> interacts with sentence type in a more complicated way than single <b>focus</b> in shaping F 0 contours of English sentences...|$|R

Time evolutions of <b>focusing</b> entropies and particle trajectories are analyzed contrastively. The results demonstrate that the <b>focusing</b> entropy is an effective scale to measure particles ordering degree and hydrodynamic <b>focusing</b> performance. Higher ordering degree determines lower <b>focusing</b> entropy, which indicates better <b>focusing</b> performance. Channel cross section, particle rigidness and channel Reynolds number are three major factors influencing <b>focusing</b> dynamics and final results. Rectangular microchannel is more advantageous than circular and square ones in hydrodynamic <b>focusing.</b> Particles of different rigidness in rectangular microchannel can be separated significantly with the flow mediation. Increasing channel Reynolds numbers can lead to higher efficiency and better <b>focusing</b> performance...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{word order}} and {{intonation}} to mark <b>focus</b> in child speech has received some attention.

An answer-reconstruction task was used to elicit syntactic (word order) and intonational <b>focus</b> marking of subject and objects (locus of <b>focus)</b> in three <b>focus</b> types (broad, narrow, and contrastive <b>focus).</b> The results indicate that both children and adults used intonation to distinguish broad from contrastive <b>focus</b> but they differed in the marking of narrow <b>focus.</b> Further, both groups preferred intonation to word order as device for <b>focus</b> marking.
