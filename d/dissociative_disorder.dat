5|$|Walker finally meets Konrad at his penthouse. Konrad {{appears to}} be the charismatic, villainous force behind the atrocities that Walker was hoping for, until Walker finds his {{decaying}} corpse on the penthouse deck. Walker finds that Konrad committed suicide after his failed evacuation effort, and he has been communicating with a traumatic hallucinatory Konrad, created in his mind as a <b>dissociative</b> <b>disorder</b> upon the aftermath of the white phosphorus strike. Rationalizing the actions he had witnessed and carried out, Walker distorted many subsequent events of the game to make Konrad look responsible. With this revelation, 'Konrad' forces Walker, at gunpoint, to decide once and for all if he is to blame for his actions in Dubai.|$|E

25|$|Hudson and Weaver are {{revealed}} to be Mason's interrogators. Dragovich has communist sleeper cells placed all over the United States which, when ordered by the numbers broadcast, will release the Nova-6 gas. As a result, the U.S. is preparing a pre-emptive nuclear strike on the Soviet Union, which {{would result in the}} inevitable Mutual Assured Destruction of World War III. Hudson needed Steiner to abort the gas launch, but after his death, only Mason has any knowledge of the numbers station. Hudson reveals that Dragovich brainwashed Mason to understand the numbers broadcasts and assassinate Kennedy, effectively making him a Soviet sleeper agent. The real Reznov never escaped, but died during the Vorkuta breakout attempt, and the Soviet defector in Hue was actually killed before Mason reached him. Mason’s visions of Reznov are a result of a <b>dissociative</b> <b>disorder</b> caused by the traumatic brainwashing program. Prior to the Vorkuta uprising, Reznov reprogrammed Mason to assassinate Dragovich, Kravchenko, and Steiner instead. Mason finally remembers the location of the broadcast station: a Russian cargo ship called Rusalka off the coast of Cuba. An assault on the Rusalka begins, with Mason and Hudson infiltrating the underwater submarine base protecting the ship. Hudson calls in the United States Navy to destroy the Rusalka. Mason and Hudson finally confront Dragovich in the lower levels of the facility, and Mason strangles and drowns him to death before escaping with Hudson. They regroup with Weaver, who declares victory.|$|E
500|$|Early in life, Cook {{was abused}} by his father, {{who had a}} severe {{drinking}} problem. While intoxicated, Cook's father reportedly became violent towards his family. After many years of this abuse Cook developed many psychological problems that ended up following him through to his life as an adult. He developed a severe <b>dissociative</b> <b>disorder</b> and psychogenic amnesia. He recalled having periods of [...] "missing time" [...] but never really understood the cause. In 1990, doctors finally diagnosed the disorders after Cook experienced {{what they thought was}} a severe stroke and was rushed to the Coral Springs Medical Hospital in Fort. Lauderdale.|$|E

They also announced that Asashōryū and his stablemaster Takasago would have their salaries cut by 30% for the next four months. He was also instructed to restrict his movements to his home, his stable, and the hospital. Isenoumi, a Director of the Sumo Association, called Asashōryū's behaviour [...] "a serious indiscretion. Given that a yokozuna should act as a good example for the other wrestlers, this punishment for his action is appropriate." [...] It was the most severe punishment ever imposed on a yokozuna since the Grand Tournament system was adopted over 80 years ago. Asashōryū responded by saying he would get his injuries treated and prepare for the winter regional tour and the January 2008 tournament. However, his stablemaster reported that Asashōryū was finding the severity of the punishment difficult to deal with, and two doctors from the Sumo Association diagnosed him as suffering from acute stress disorder, and then <b>dissociative</b> <b>disorder.</b> On 28 August he was allowed to return to Mongolia for treatment. After recuperation and onsen treatment, he returned to Japan on 30 November 2007, apologising for his actions at a press conference.|$|E
2500|$|Psychogenic amnesia, {{also known}} as dissociative amnesia, is a [...] memory {{disorder}} characterized by sudden retrograde episodic memory loss, said to occur {{for a period of}} time ranging from hours to years.

2500|$|Already in Hitler’s lifetime, some psychiatrists judged {{that such}} a relapse without organic {{explanation}} must be described as an hysterical symptom. The hysteria diagnosis had its greatest popularity with Sigmund Freud's psychoanalysis, but was still in use in the 1930s and 1940s. Loss of the sense organs were among typical symptoms, in addition to self-centered and theatrical behavior. The psychiatrist Karl Wilmanns supposedly said in a lecture: [...] "Hitler has had a hysterical reaction after being buried alive in the field"; Wilmanns then lost his position in 1933. His assistant Hans Walter Gruhle suffered professional disadvantages due to similar statements. In modern psychiatry, the term [...] "hysteria" [...] {{is no longer in}} use; today, corresponding symptoms are rather being associated with <b>dissociative</b> <b>disorder</b> or histrionic personality disorder.|$|E
