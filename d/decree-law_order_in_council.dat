50|$|The Copyright Act 1911 also {{provided}} that “His Majesty may, by <b>Order</b> <b>in</b> <b>Council,</b> extend this Act to any territories under his protection and to Cyprus” and the act would then apply to these countries {{as if they}} were dominions of the British Empire. <b>In</b> 1912 an <b>Order</b> <b>in</b> <b>Council</b> extended the Copyright Act 1911 to Cyprus and the following territories: Bechuanaland, East Africa, The Gambia, the Gilbert and Ellice Islands, Northern Nigeria, the Northern Territories of the Gold Coast, Nyasaland, Northern Rhodesia, Southern Rhodesia, Sierra Leone, Somaliland, Southern Nigeria, the Solomon Islands, Swaziland, Uganda and Weihaiwei.

50|$|The Privy Council legislates on Reserved matters through <b>Orders</b> <b>in</b> <b>Council.</b> Technically {{speaking}} {{these are}} secondary, or delegated legislation, {{and they are}} therefore given UK Statutory Instrument numbers. <b>Orders</b> <b>in</b> <b>Council</b> are however used as primary legislation.|$|R

When an <b>Order</b> <b>in</b> <b>Council</b> is used to exercise a power granted by an Act, such Orders are made as SSIs.|$|R

50|$|Traditionally, <b>Orders</b> <b>in</b> <b>Council</b> {{are used}} {{as a way for}} the Prime Minister to make {{political}} appointments, but they {{can also be used to}} issue simple laws as a sort of decree.

50|$|In {{this second}} case, an <b>Order</b> <b>in</b> <b>Council</b> is merely {{another form of}} Statutory Instrument (in the UK, {{regulated}} by the Statutory Instruments Act 1946), albeit subject to more formalities than a simple statutory instrument. This kind of <b>Order</b> <b>in</b> <b>Council</b> tends to be reserved for the most important pieces of subordinate legislation, and its use {{is likely to become}} more common. Like all statutory instruments, they may simply be required to be laid before both Houses of Parliament, or, they may be annulled in pursuance of a resolution of either the lower House (House of Commons in the UK and Canada or House of Representatives in the other realms), or the upper House (House of Lords in the UK or Senate in other realms) ('negative resolution procedure'), or require to be approved by a resolution of either House, or, exceptionally, both ('affirmative resolution procedure'). That said, the use of <b>Orders</b> <b>in</b> <b>Council</b> has been extended recently, as the Scotland Act 1998 provides that draft <b>Orders</b> <b>in</b> <b>Council</b> may be laid before the Scottish Parliament in certain circumstances {{in the same way as}} they would have been laid before the Westminster Parliament.
