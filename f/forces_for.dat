40|$|For a multiagent {{system in}} free space, the agents are {{required}} to generate sufficiently large cohesive <b>force</b> <b>for</b> network connectivity preservation and sufficiently large repulsive <b>force</b> <b>for</b> collision avoidance. This paper gives an energy function based approach for estimating the control force in a general setting. In particular, the <b>force</b> estimated <b>for</b> network connectivity preservation and collision avoidance is separated from the <b>force</b> <b>for</b> other collective behavior of the agents. Moreover, the estimation approach is applied in three typical collective control scenarios including swarming, flocking, and flocking without velocity measurement...|$|R

40|$|This {{mechanism}} {{design paper}} studies {{the assignment of}} people to projects over time. Inability to communicate interim shocks is a <b>force</b> <b>for</b> long-term assignments, though exceptions exist for extreme risk aversion. In contrast, costless reporting of interim shocks makes switching powerful for virtually all environments. Switching elicits honest reports and mitigates incentive constraints allowing, in particular, ben-e…cial concealment of project quality. Properties of the production technology are also shown to matter. Substitutability of intertemporal e¤ort is a <b>force</b> <b>for</b> long-term assignments while complementarity with Nash equilibrium strategies is a <b>force</b> <b>for</b> job rotation. ...|$|R
5|$|Although {{the road}} had been opened between Yudam-ni and Hagaru-ri, the convoy {{still had to}} fight through the {{numerous}} Chinese positions on the hills overlooking the road. On {{the first night of}} the retreat, the Chinese struck the convoy in force and inflicted heavy casualties upon 3rd Battalion, 5th Marines (3/5). Although strong air cover suppressed most of the Chinese <b>forces</b> <b>for</b> the rest of the march, the cold weather, harassing fire, raiding parties, and road blocks slowed the retreat to a crawl while inflicting numerous casualties. Despite those difficulties, the convoy reached Hagaru-ri in an orderly fashion on the afternoon of 3 December, with the withdrawal completed on 4 December.|$|E
5|$|As {{far as the}} Belgians were concerned, the Dyle Plan had advantages. Instead of {{the limited}} Allied advance to the Scheldt, or meeting the Germans on the Franco-Belgian border, the move to the Dyle river would reduce the Allied front in central Belgium by , freeing more <b>forces</b> <b>for</b> use as a {{strategic}} reserve. It was felt it would save more Belgian territory, in particular the eastern industrial regions. It also {{had the advantage of}} absorbing Dutch and Belgian Army formations (including some 20 Belgian divisions). Gamelin was to justify the Dyle Plan after the defeat using these arguments.|$|E

Further fighting occurred from 31 December 1941 – 2 January 1942, before Bardia was re-taken by the 2nd South African Division.
