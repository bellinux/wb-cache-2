50|$|The most {{prominent}} areas where <b>honour</b> <b>killings</b> occur in India are northern regions. <b>Honour</b> <b>killings</b> are especially seen in Punjab, Haryana, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Jharkhand, Himachal Pradesh, and Madhya Pradesh. <b>Honour</b> <b>killings</b> have notably increased in some Indian states {{which has led}} to the Supreme Court of India, in June 2010, issuing notices to both the Indian central government and six states to take preventative measures against <b>honour</b> <b>killings.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Data and {{its absence}} are {{difficult}} to interpret. One reason is the reluctance to report <b>honour</b> <b>killings</b> to official bodies. Another reason is that <b>honour</b> <b>killings</b> are occurring in cultural and social contexts which do not recognize the criminality of <b>honour</b> <b>killings.</b> The very nature of <b>honour</b> <b>killings</b> reflects deeply entrenched notions of [...] "honour" [...] and [...] "morality", in which the perpetrator is upholding justice and order when the victim commits deplorable social acts. <b>Honour</b> <b>killings</b> thus inverts the roles of [...] "right" [...] and [...] "wrong". The perpetrator becomes the champion of justice while the victim becomes the perpetrator and accused of the criminal act. Furthermore, human rights advocates are in wide agreement that the reported cases {{do not reflect the}} full extent of the issue, as <b>honour</b> <b>killings</b> have a high level of support in Pakistan's rural society, and thus often go unreported. Frequently, women killed in <b>honour</b> <b>killings</b> are recorded as having committed suicide or died in accidents.|$|R
5000|$|As {{in other}} countries, {{the exact number}} of <b>honour</b> <b>killings</b> is not known. Latest {{official}} data puts the number of women killed in <b>honour</b> <b>killings</b> in 2015 at nearly 1,100, suggesting these types of killings are on the rise (or perhaps are being better reported). Sources disagree as to the exact number by year. In 2011, human rights groups reported 720 <b>honour</b> <b>killings</b> in Pakistan (605 women and 115 men), while Pakistan's Human Rights Commission reported that in 2010 there were 791 <b>honour</b> <b>killings</b> in the country, and Amnesty International cited 960 incidents of women alone who were slain in <b>honour</b> <b>killings</b> that year.|$|R

25|$|An <b>honour</b> <b>killing</b> is the {{practice}} wherein {{an individual is}} killed {{by one or more}} family member(s), because he or she is believed to have brought shame on the family. The shame may range from refusing to enter an arranged marriage, having sex outside marriage, being in a relationship that is disapproved by the family, starting a divorce proceeding, or engaging in homosexual relations.|$|E
50|$|A {{recent report}} noted {{that one in}} five homicides in Pakistan are {{attributed}} to <b>honour</b> <b>killings.</b> The prevalence of such <b>honour</b> <b>killings</b> that have been reported are around 2,000 killings every four years. Overall, out of all homicides of {{both men and women}} in Pakistan, <b>honour</b> <b>killings</b> of women constitute 21%. Moreover, the perpetrator in most <b>honour</b> <b>killings</b> is the husband. One study found as high as 92% of all <b>honour</b> <b>killings</b> are committed by the spouse. The highest occurring reason in spousal <b>honour</b> <b>killings</b> was alleged extramarital affairs. Much of the data has been collected by the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan through newspaper reports, however, it is clear there needs to be more systematic research by a health agency is needed to assess this public health crisis and effectively plan for solutions as many cases go unreported. Another analysis of this research states that a possible explanation of the high rate of <b>honour</b> <b>killings</b> towards married women could be attributed to the generally high statistics of domestic violence in Pakistan.|$|R
40|$|Pakistan {{has one of}} {{the highest}} incidences of <b>honour</b> <b>killings</b> in the world. This is a major human rights issue that has {{received}} little attention outside of human rights groups and women activist networks. This paper provides a critical reassessment of <b>honour</b> <b>killings</b> in Pakistan and argues that the prevalence of <b>honour</b> <b>killings</b> is due to the fact that traditional justice prevails over jural law. Since the late 1970 s, aspects of traditional justice have been incorporated in the Pakistan Penal Code, thereby sanctioning homicide of men and women charged with adultery and fornication. In order to analyse the tenuous relationship between jural law and traditional justice, this paper is based on first-hand accounts of <b>honour</b> <b>killings</b> in the North- West Frontier Province (NWFP). This actor-oriented approach shows why traditional justice sanctions <b>honour</b> <b>killings</b> and the inability of jural law and the judiciary to punish offenders. In order to deter <b>honour</b> <b>killings,</b> more strident punishment of offenders is advised to invalidate traditional justice and counteract the private use of violence...|$|R

25|$|Most critics {{agree that}} Hamama's most {{challenging}} role {{was in the}} 1959 film Dua'e Al-Karawan (دعاء الكروان, The Nightingale's Prayer), which {{is considered to be}} one of the best Egyptian films. It is based on the novel of the same name by the prominent Egyptian writer Taha Hussein. In this film, Hamama played the role of Amnah, a young woman who seeks revenge from her uncle for the <b>honour</b> <b>killing</b> of her sister. After this film, Hamama carefully picked her roles. In 1960, she starred in the film Nahr Hob (نهر حب, Love River) which was based on Leo Tolstoy's well known novel Anna Karenina and in 1961, she played the lead role in the film La Tutf'e al-Shams (لا تطفئ الشمس, Don't Turn Off the Sun) based on the novel by Ihsan Abdel Quddous.|$|E
500|$|The {{case was}} the first {{resulting}} in the conviction of khap panchayats and the first capital punishment verdict in an <b>honour</b> <b>killing</b> case in India.

He considered the film [...] "a protest against such traditions and practice". For research, Sinha had visited Haryana and spoken to khap members.|$|E
50|$|A {{majority}} {{of the victims of}} <b>honour</b> <b>killings</b> are women and the punishments meted out to the murderers are very lenient. The practice of summary killing of a person suspected of an illicit liaison is known as karo kari in Sindh and Balochistan. In December 2004, the Government passed a bill that made karo kari punishable under the same penal provisions as murder. In 2016, Pakistan repealed the loophole which allowed the perpetrators of <b>honour</b> <b>killings</b> to avoid punishment by seeking forgiveness for the crime from another family member, and thus be legally pardoned.Many cases of <b>honour</b> <b>killings</b> have been reported against women who marry against their family's wishes, who seek divorce or who have been raped.|$|R
5000|$|An Amnesty International report noted [...] "the {{failure of}} the {{authorities}} to prevent these killings by investigating and punishing the perpetrators." [...] <b>Honour</b> <b>killings</b> {{are supposed to be}} prosecuted as ordinary murder, but in practice, police and prosecutors often ignore it. The Pakistani government's failure to take effective measures to end the practice of <b>honour</b> <b>killings</b> is indicative of a weakening of political institutions, corruption, and economic decline. In the wake of civil crisis, people turn to other alternative models, such as traditional tribal customs.

2500|$|Saladin {{was born}} in Tikrit in modern-day Iraq. His {{personal}} name was [...] "Yusuf"; [...] "Salah ad-Din" [...] is a laqab, an honorific epithet, meaning [...] "Righteousness of the Faith." [...] His family was of Kurdish ancestry, and had originated {{from the city of}} Dvin in medieval Armenia. The Rawadid tribe he hailed from had been partially assimilated into the Arabic-speaking world by this time. In 1132, the defeated army of Imad ad-Din Zengi, the ruler of Mosul, found their retreat blocked by the Tigris River opposite the fortress of Tikrit, where Saladin's father, Najm ad-Din Ayyub served as the warden. Ayyub provided ferries for the army and gave them refuge in Tikrit. Mujahed al-Din Bihruz, a former Greek slave who had been appointed as the military governor of northern Mesopotamia for his service to the Seljuks, reprimanded Ayyub for giving Zengi refuge and in 1137 banished Ayyub from Tikrit after his brother Asad al-Din Shirkuh killed a friend of Bihruz in an <b>honour</b> <b>killing.</b> According to Baha ad-Din ibn Shaddad, Saladin was born on the same night that his family left Tikrit. In 1139, Ayyub and his family moved to Mosul, where Imad ad-Din Zengi acknowledged his debt and appointed Ayyub commander of his fortress in Baalbek. After the death of Zengi in 1146, his son, Nur ad-Din, became the regent of Aleppo and the leader of the Zengids.|$|E
