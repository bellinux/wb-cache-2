5|$|According to a {{study by}} Dr. Nguyen Viet Nhan, {{children}} in the areas where Agent Orange was used have been affected and have multiple health problems, including cleft palate, mental disabilities, hernias, and extra fingers and toes. In the 1970s, high levels of dioxin were found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>breast</b> milk of South Vietnamese women, and in the blood of U.S. military personnel who had served in Vietnam. The most affected zones are the mountainous area along Truong Son (Long Mountains) and the border between Vietnam and Cambodia. The affected residents are living in substandard conditions with many genetic diseases.|$|E

5|$|It {{was at this}} battle, {{regardless}} of exactly when and where this occurred, that a defining moment of Epaminondas's early life would happen. Epaminondas saved the life of his fellow Theban Pelopidas; Pelopidas, after receiving seven wounds in front, sank down upon a great heap of friends and enemies who lay dead together; but Epaminondas, although he thought him lifeless, stood forth to defend his body and his arms, and fought desperately, single-handed against many, determined to die rather than leave Pelopidas lying there. And now he too was in a sorry plight, having been wounded <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>breast</b> with a spear and in the arm with a sword, when Agesipolis the Spartan king came to his aid from the other wing, and when all hope was lost, saved them both. Plutarch says that this incident firmly cemented their friendship, and Pelopidas would be Epaminondas's partner in politics for the next twenty years.|$|E

25|$|Mammographic density {{refers to}} the {{relative}} proportions of radiodense area compared to the radiolucent area on a mammogram, which is basically an x-ray of the breast. The radiodense area on a mammogram is white and is associated with ductal and lobular epithelium, connective tissue and fluid <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>breast.</b> The radiolucent area is dark gray or black and is associated with fat <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>breast.</b> High mammographic density {{is associated with a}} higher risk of developing breast cancer, but the reasons for this link are not certain and are being studied. Conversely, patients with very low mammographic breast density were found to hold a poorer prognosis irrespective of age, BMI and menopausal status.|$|E

25|$|In pregnancy, this sign {{normally}} disappears {{owing to}} increased surface blood flow.

25|$|Breast {{cancer is}} cancer that {{develops}} from breast tissue. Signs {{of breast cancer}} may include a lump <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>breast,</b> a change in breast shape, dimpling of the skin, fluid coming from the nipple, or a red scaly patch of skin. In those with distant spread of the disease, there may be bone pain, swollen lymph nodes, shortness of breath, or yellow skin.|$|E
40|$|Emphasising {{the point}} that <b>the</b> {{contralateral}} <b>breast</b> plays a vital role <b>in</b> <b>the</b> prognosis of <b>breast</b> cancer, Foote & Stewart (1945) reported {{that the presence of}} a cancer <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ipsilateral <b>breast</b> is <b>the</b> single most important factor for increased risk <b>in</b> <b>the</b> opposite <b>breast.</b> Prophylactic mastectomy of <b>the</b> opposite <b>breast</b> had been advocated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past following surgery for carcinoma of <b>the</b> dominant <b>breast</b> (Pack et al., 1951). Although we certainly do not usually advocate such a radical procedure, the need for early detection of a second primary <b>in</b> <b>the</b> contralateral <b>breast</b> cannot be over-emphasised. It is generally believed that frequent clinical and mammographic examination are sufficient to detect the presence of a second primary <b>in</b> <b>the</b> opposite <b>breast.</b> However, clinical examination (Venet et al., 1969) and mammograph...|$|R

25|$|In humans, {{the brain}} {{continues}} to develop after birth, {{and does not}} become similar to its adult structure until around four years of age. By feeding infants formula instead of milk, and presumably through differences in choline amount <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>breast</b> milk of mothers consuming different choline levels, the still-developing brain of an infant may be impacted, which may, in part, contribute to the differences seen between individual adult humans in memory and recall.|$|E
25|$|Another {{reported}} symptom {{complex of}} breast cancer is Paget's disease of the breast. This syndrome presents as skin changes resembling eczema, such as redness, discoloration, or mild flaking of the nipple skin. As Paget's disease of the breast advances, symptoms may include tingling, itching, increased sensitivity, burning, and pain. There may also be discharge from the nipple. Approximately half of women diagnosed with Paget's disease of the breast also have a lump <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>breast.</b>|$|E
25|$|Suspensory ligaments. The {{subcutaneous}} {{layer of}} adipose tissue <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>breast</b> is traversed with thin suspensory ligaments (Cooper's ligaments) that extend obliquely {{to the skin}} surface, and from the skin to the deep pectoral fascia. The structural stability provided by the Cooper's ligaments derives from its closely packed bundles of collagen fibers oriented in parallel; the principal, ligament-component cell is the fibroblast, interspersed throughout the parallel collagen-fiber bundles of the shoulder, axilla, and thorax ligaments.|$|E

25|$|There is an {{association}} between use of hormonal birth control {{and the development of}} premenopausal breast cancer, but whether oral contraceptives use may actually cause premenopausal breast cancer is a matter of debate.

In those with mutations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>breast</b> cancer susceptibility genes BRCA1 or BRCA2, or who {{have a family history of}} breast cancer, use of modern oral contraceptives does not appear to affect the risk of breast cancer.|$|E
25|$|One {{account of}} the origin of the Milky Way is that Zeus had tricked Hera into nursing the infant Heracles: {{discovering}} who he was, she pulled him from her breast, and a spurt of her milk formed the smear across the sky that can be seen to this day.

25|$|The {{technique}} of autologous fat-graft injection to the breast is {{applied for the}} correction of breast asymmetry; of breast deformities; for post-mastectomy breast reconstruction (as a primary and as an adjunct technique); {{for the improvement of}} soft-tissue coverage of breast implants; and for the aesthetic enhancement of the bust. The careful harvesting and centrifugal refinement of the mature adipocyte tissue (injected in small aliquots) allows the transplanted fat tissue to remain viable <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>breast,</b> where it provides the anatomical structure and the hemispheric contour that cannot be achieved solely with breast implants or with corrective plastic surgery.|$|E
