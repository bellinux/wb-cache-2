5|$|He {{is known}} to have absorbed the {{abilities}} of Luke Cage, Vision, Red Hulk and Protector, and it is suggested that he also absorbed the abilities of his current Dark Avengers. In his final form, his body grew to the Hulk's size, and like Hulk he was capable of creating shockwaves by hitting the ground or smashing his hands together. His durability was sufficient to withstand the combined attacks of all the Avengers, and he demonstrated remarkable <b>healing</b> <b>abilities,</b> recovering in seconds after Daisy Johnson used her powers to make his heart explode. He could also turn intangible by manipulating his density, as the Vision does.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Yukio {{arrives and}} kills Dr. Green as Logan fights the Silver Samurai. The Silver Samurai severs Logan's adamantium claws {{and begins to}} extract Logan's <b>healing</b> <b>abilities,</b> {{revealing}} himself to be Ichirō, who had faked his death. Ichirō regains his youth, but Mariko intervenes and stabs Ichirō with Logan's severed claws. Logan regenerates his bone claws and kills Ichirō. Logan collapses and has one final hallucination of Jean, in which he decides to finally let go of her. Mariko becomes CEO of Yashida Industries and bids farewell to Logan {{as he prepares to}} leave Japan. Yukio vows to stay by Logan's side as his bodyguard, and they depart to places unknown.|$|E
5|$|During single-player segments, {{the player}} could select two AI companions after {{selecting}} missions, which {{added to the}} player's total score {{at the end of}} these missions. During missions, the companions could be issued with Team Commands, which could either order them to attack or increase <b>healing</b> <b>abilities</b> while lowering their defensive capabilities. Each attempt at a mission used up the Cadet's stamina meter, which allowed a maximum of three missions at a time. The game used a job system similar to other entries in the Final Fantasy series, where different equipment and weapons alter a character's abilities in battle. Specific skills accompanied each job. Players could create multiple equipment sets, with each item and weapon ranked according to its rarity in-game. Materials gathered during missions could be used to upgrade the player's equipment and abilities.|$|E

5|$|There are six {{different}} specialized combat roles equivalent to standard character classes. They are Battlers (warriors), Dark (dark knights), Gunners, Kanbus (ninja), Koas (paladins), and Somas (mages). A character's class determines {{what types of}} weapons and skills they can equip. Each class consequently uses a different fighting style: the Kanbus focuses on dual weapons and one-hit attacks, the Koas focuses {{on a combination of}} attack and <b>healing</b> <b>abilities,</b> the Dark sacrifices health to deal heavier damage, Gunners specialize in long-range attacks, Battlers focuses on melee attacks, and the Somas use long-range magic over close-range physical attacks. Weapons are equipped based on a character's class, and can be upgraded using special items called Orbs. Weapons and items collected through exploration and from enemy drops can be sold to other players through wireless connection.|$|E
5|$|In 1845, James Howlett, a boy {{living in}} Canada, {{witnesses}} his father {{being killed by}} groundskeeper Thomas Logan. The anxiety activates the boy's mutation: bone claws protrude from his knuckles, and he impales Thomas, who reveals that he is James's birth father before dying. James flees along with Thomas's other son Victor Creed, who is thus James's half-brother and has a healing factor mutation like James. They spend the next century as soldiers, fighting in the American Civil War, both World Wars, and the Vietnam War. In Vietnam, the increasingly violent Victor attempts to rape a Vietnamese woman, and kills a senior officer who tries to stop him. James happens upon the fight and defends Victor, resulting in the pair being sentenced to execution by firing squad, which they survive due to their mutant <b>healing</b> <b>abilities.</b> Major William Stryker approaches them in military custody and offers them membership in Team X, a group of mutants including Agent Zero, Wade Wilson, John Wraith, Fred Dukes, and Chris Bradley. They join the team for a few years, with James now using the alias Logan, but Victor and the group's lack of empathy for human life causes Logan to leave.|$|E
25|$|The various yet sparse healers of the Middle Ages {{were among}} the few, if not the only, proponents of a {{positive}} impression of magic.

25|$|During the epidemic, normal {{gameplay}} was disrupted. Player responses varied but resembled real-world behaviors. Some {{characters with}} <b>healing</b> <b>abilities</b> volunteered their services, some lower-level characters {{who could not}} help would direct people away from infected areas, some characters would flee to uninfected areas, and some characters attempted to spread the disease to others. Players in the game reacted to the disease {{as if there were}} real risk to their well-being. Blizzard Entertainment attempted to institute a voluntary quarantine to stem the disease, but it failed, as some players didn't take it seriously, while others took advantage of the pandemonium. Despite certain security measures, players overcame them by giving the disease to summonable pets. Blizzard was forced to fix the problem by instituting hard resets of the servers and applying quick fixes.|$|E
25|$|After {{the loss}} of his left hand, Aquaman {{initially}} replaced it with a cybernetic retractable hook, then a cybernetic hand. The mechanical hand was replaced by a magical hand made out of water, given to him by the Lady of the Lake, which grants Aquaman numerous abilities, including, but not limited to, the ability to dehydrate anyone he touches and kill them instantly, the ability to shoot jets of water from his hand, scalding or freezing, <b>healing</b> <b>abilities,</b> the ability to create portals into mystical dimensions acting as spontaneous transport, the ability to control almost any body of water he sets his focuses on and the ability to communicate with the Lady of the Lake through the waterbearer hand. His biological hand was restored when the character was resurrected in Blackest Night #8.|$|E

25|$|Although some single-player {{role-playing}} games {{give the}} player an avatar {{that is largely}} predefined {{for the sake of}} telling a specific story, many role-playing games make use of a character creation screen. This allows players to choose their character's sex, their race or species, and their character class. Although many of theses traits are cosmetic, there are functional aspects as well. Character classes will have different abilities and strengths. Common classes include fighters, spellcasters, thieves with stealth abilities, and clerics with <b>healing</b> <b>abilities,</b> or a mixed class, such as a fighter who can cast simple spells. Characters will also have a range of physical attributes such as dexterity and strength, which affect a player's performance in combat. Mental attributes such as intelligence may affect a player's ability to perform and learn spells, while social attributes such as charisma may limit the player's choices while conversing with non-player characters. These attribute systems often strongly resemble the Dungeons & Dragons ruleset.|$|E
25|$|An {{anastomosis}} is {{a surgical}} {{connection between the}} stomach and bowel, or between {{two parts of the}} bowel. The surgeon attempts to create a water-tight connection by connecting the two organs with either staples or sutures, either of which actually makes a hole in the bowel wall. The surgeon will rely on the body's natural <b>healing</b> <b>abilities</b> and its ability to create a seal, like a self-sealing tire, to succeed with the surgery. If that seal fails to form for any reason, fluid from within the gastrointestinal tract can leak into the sterile abdominal cavity and give rise to infection and abscess formation. Leakage of an anastomosis can occur in about 2% of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and less than 1% in mini gastric bypass. Leaks usually occur at the stomach-intestine connection (gastro-jejunostomy). There is a change in the drain fluid contents from serous (before the leak) to fecal/bilious (after the leak). Usually significant leaks need urgent re-operation. Sometimes a minor leakage can be treated with antibiotics only. It is usually safer to re-operate if an infection cannot be definitely controlled immediately.|$|E

500|$|The Edgar Cayce Hospital for Research and Enlightenment was {{established}} in Virginia Beach in 1928 with 60 beds.
