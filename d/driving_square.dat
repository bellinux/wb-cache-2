40|$|Abstract—At certain depths during large {{diameter}} {{displacement pile}} driving, rebound well over 0. 25 inches was experienced, {{followed by a}} small permanent-set during each hammer blow. High pile rebound (HPR) soils may stop the pile driving and results in a limited pile capacity. In some cases, rebound leads to pile damage, delaying the construction project, and the requiring foundations redesign. HPR was evaluated at seven Florida sites, during <b>driving</b> of <b>square</b> precast, prestressed concrete piles driven into saturated, fine silty to clayey sands and sandy clays. Pile Driving Analyzer (PDA) deflection versus time data recorded during installation, was used to develop correlations between cone penetrometer (CPT) pore-water pressures, pile displacements and rebound. At five sites where piles experienced excessive HPR with minimal set, the pore pressure yielded very high positive values of greater than 20 tsf. However, at {{the site where the}} pile rebounded, followed by an acceptable permanent-set, the measured pore pressure ranged between 5 and 20 tsf. The pore pressure exhibited values of less than 5 tsf at the site where no rebound was noticed.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of the electroweak symmetry-breaking (EWSB) is studied {{in the context of}} the heavy top quark, whose large mass may provide a clue as to the mechanism which generates the mass of the W ± and Z bosons. As a result, it seems quite likely that the top quark may be special in the sense that it is involved in dynamics not experienced by the light fermions. Examples of this include models such as the top-condensate model in which a bound state of top quarks condenses, generating both the top mass and the gauge boson masses, and supersymmetric models in which the large top Yukawa coupling naturally explains the EWSB by radiatively <b>driving</b> the <b>squared</b> mass of a scalar particle (which is positive at a large energy scale) negative at low energies.

In the deep quantum regime, scattering is dominated by multiphoton exchanges with the driving field, leading to complex resonance structures in transmission and reflection.

The overall size of the scanner, including the micromirror and the actuator, is 2 mm × 1 mm. A maximum static mechanical tilting angle of 5 ° is achieved at a dc driving voltage of 18 V and current of 23 mA, corresponding to a 10 ° optical scan angle. The scanner can be operated from dc to low frequencies (the 3 dB bandwidth is from 0 Hz to 80 Hz), which meets the requirement for certain practical opto-electronic systems such as optical coherence tomography (OCT) systems. The scanner has a maximum mechanical tilting angle of 8 ° at its resonant frequency of 2. 19 kHz, corresponding {{to a total of}} 16 ° maximum optical scan angle.

A head mounted display was used to present the virtual world. Feedback was given to participants when they failed to scan appropriately for hazards. Twelve novice drivers served as experimental group and were trained with the combined RAPT/SIMRAPT training program. Twelve other novice drivers were given training not relevant to hazard anticipation and served as the control group.

40|$|A {{critical}} PECL (positive emitter-coupled logic) interface to Xilinx interface {{needed to}} be changed on an existing flight board. The new Xilinx input interface used a CMOS (complementary metal-oxide semiconductor) type of input, and the driver could meet its thresholds typically, but not in worst-case, {{according to the data}} sheet. The previous interface had been based on comparison with an external reference, but the CMOS input is based on comparison with an internal divider from the power supply. A way to measure what the exact input threshold was for this device for 64 inputs on a flight board was needed. The measurement technique allowed an accurate measurement of the voltage required to switch a Xilinx input from high to low for each of the 64 lines, while only probing two of them. Directly driving an external voltage was considered too risky, and tests done on any other unit could not be used to qualify the flight board. The two lines directly probed gave an absolute voltage threshold calibration, while data collected on the remaining 62 lines without probing gave relative measurements {{that could be used to}} identify any outliers. The PECL interface was forced to a long-period <b>square</b> wave by <b>driving</b> a saturated <b>square</b> wave into the ADC (analog to digital converter). The active pull-down circuit was turned off, causing each line to rise rapidly and fall slowly according to the input s weak pull-down circuitry. The fall time shows up as a change in the pulse width of the signal ready by the Xilinx. This change in pulse width is a function of capacitance, pulldown current, and input threshold. Capacitance was known from the different trace lengths, plus a gate input capacitance, which is the same for all inputs. The pull-down current is the same for all inputs including the two that are probed directly. The data was combined, and the Excel solver tool was used to find input thresholds for the 62 lines. This was repeated over different supply voltages and temperatures to show that the interface had voltage margin under all worst case conditions. Gate input thresholds are normally measured at the manufacturer when the device is on a chip tester.
