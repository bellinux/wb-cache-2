40|$|Purpose: {{the aim of}} {{this pilot}} study was to test whether {{retinitis}} pigmentosa patients would benefit from <b>filter</b> <b>contact</b> lenses as an effective optical aid against glare and photophobia. Methods: fifteen subjects with retinitis pigmentosa were enrolled in this study. All of them were evaluated with filter soft contact lenses (MaxSight), filter glasses (CPF 527) and without filters (control). All patients were assessed for the three aid conditions by means of best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), contrast sensitivity (without glare and with central and peripheral glare) (CSV- 1000) and a specific subjective questionnaire about quality of vision. Results: BCVA was slightly better with filters than without filter but the differences were not statistically significant. Contrast sensitivity without glare improved significantly with the contact lenses (p< 0. 05). The central glare had significant differences for the frequencies of 3 cpd and 18 cpd between the contact lens filter and the control group (p= 0. 021 and p= 0. 044, respectively). For the peripheral glare contrast sensitivity improved with contact lens versus control group for highest frequencies, 12 and 18 cpd (p< 0. 001 and p= 0. 045, respectively). According to the questionnaire the contact lens filter gave them more visual comfort than the glasses filter under the scenarios of indoors glare, outdoors activities and indoors comfort. Conclusion: the <b>filter</b> <b>contact</b> lenses seem to be a good option {{to improve the quality of}} vision of patients with retinitis pigmentosa...|$|E

The effective transfer of bacteria with the 3 - and 5 -micron membrane filters was 0. 96 +/- 0. 04 (standard error of the mean) and 0. 99 +/- 0. 04, respectively, as compared to 0. 49 +/- 0. 03 for Rodac plates, 0. 09 +/- 0. 01 velvet pad imprints, 0. 05 +/- 0. 01 for velveteen pad imprints, 0. 27 +/- 0. 02 for velvet pad rinses, 0. 005 +/- 0. 001 for velveteen pad rinses, 0. 39 +/- 0. 02 for 0. 45 -micron filters, and 0. 85 +/- 0. 05 for 1. 2 micron filters. In addition, the recovery of S. aureus from contaminated bovine muscle surfaces with the 5 -microns membrane filter was similar to that of quantitative dilutions of biopsy material and was significantly higher than the recovery from Rodac plates. The 5 -microns membrane filters on a paddle recovered 52 +/- 5 CFU/cm 2 from artificially contaminated bovine skeletal muscle, the quantitative dilutions of biopsy recovered 69 +/- 5 CFU/cm 2, and the Rodac plate recovered 5 +/- 3 CFU/cm 2.

40|$|Residue contact map is {{essential}} for protein three‐dimensional structure determination. But most of the current contact prediction methods based on residue co‐evolution suffer from high false‐positives as introduced by indirect and transitive contacts (i. e., residues A–B and B–C are in contact, but A–C are not). Built on the work by Feizi et al. (Nat Biotechnol 2013; 31 : 726 – 733), which demonstrated a general network model to distinguish direct dependencies by network deconvolution, this study presents a new balanced network deconvolution (BND) algorithm to identify optimized dependency matrix without limit on the eigenvalue range in the applied network systems. The algorithm was used to <b>filter</b> <b>contact</b> predictions of five widely used co‐evolution methods. On the test of proteins from three benchmark datasets of the 9 th critical assessment of protein structure prediction (CASP 9), CASP 10, and PSICOV (precise structural contact prediction using sparse inverse covariance estimation) database experiments, the BND can improve the medium‐ and long‐range contact predictions at the L/ 5 cutoff by 55. 59 % and 47. 68 %, respectively, without additional central processing unit cost. The improvement is statistically significant, with a P‐value[*]<[*] 5. 93 × 10 − 3 in the Student's t‐test.

40|$|An {{oversupply}} of Phosphorus {{in water}} bodies accelerates growth of algae and higher forms of plant life to produce undesirable impacts on overall water quality. Phosphorus inputs to surface waters arise {{from a variety}} of point and nonpoint sources. However much of the P is contributed by agricultural runoff and outfall of treated (or untreated) wastewater in receiving water-bodies. Point sourced-P inputs to waters have considerably decreased in recent years, at least partly driven by regulatory requirements, e. g. the EU Water Framework Directive. This has largely been achieved by removing P from treated wastewaters at sewage treatment works (STWs). Studies have shown that introducing an additional treatment step (“P-stripping”) can significantly reduce P in STW outfalls. Given P deposits are depleting, there is much interest in phosphorus recovery from wastewaters. A few STWs have already started to recover P as struvite (NH 4 MgPO 4. 6 H 2 O) mineral – a substitute for commercially produced P-fertilizers. This requires major investment and is not economically viable at small STWs. Nonetheless it is a major breakthrough in terms of P recovery and its use. Effluents from sewage treatment works (STW) can often contain a complex mixture of residual microcontaminants, not removed during wastewater treatment. Organic micro-pollutants have been found in rivers receiving STW effluents. Such residual contaminants have become the focus of an emerging field of water quality study and are collectively referred to as pharmaceuticals and other personal healthcare products, PPHCPs. Many of these chemicals have the ability to effect the hormonal signaling of organisms and are called endocrine disrupting compounds (EDC). Such chemicals have shown some of the most damaging biological effects in aquatic organisms. Biological effects in the aquatic environment are typically related to the development of intersex in fish. Recent research shows the use of STW practices such as upgrading from using a combined trickling <b>filter</b> <b>contact</b> process to activated sludge treatment, ozonation, membrane filtration and use of suspended biofilm reactors reduces the amount of EDCs in waste effluent. It is thus possible to remove contaminants from STW effluents, but it will not be possible without major infrastructure improvements.

40|$|Over {{the last}} twenty years there has been an {{increase}} in reports on bed bug (Cimex lectularius) infestations in hotels, public buildings and private houses worldwide. International travel and migration, the trade of second-hand articles, the unavailability of some insecticides and as the main reason the development of resistance against Pyrethroids, which are the insecticides primarily used for bed bug control, are considered to be responsible for the expansion of the bed bug. Pyrethroid-resistance in bed bugs has been described in many countries. However, for Germany no data about the occurrence and the mechanisms inducing pyrethroid-resistance are available so far. Knockdown-resistance (kdr) to pyrethroids {{has been shown to be}} associated with the presence of two point mutations (V 419 L or L 925 I) in the voltage gated sodium channel α‑subunit gene, the target site of pyrethroids. An increased metabolic detoxification by cytochrome P 450 s has been described as an additional mechanism causing pyrethroid resistance in bed bugs. In the present study, bed bug field strains and populations were collected from 20 infested apartments in Berlin, Germany. In five of these field strains the susceptibility to deltamethrin of C. lectularius was determined in a <b>filter</b> <b>contact</b> bioassay. Resistance ratios (Ri), calculated from LD 50 -values ranged between Ri = 4. 3 and Ri = 20. 6. Furthermore, pyrosequencing of genomic DNA fragments containing the possible polymorphisms of single (10 male and fe-male bed bugs each) and pooled (100 male and female bed bugs each) samples was performed in order to analyze the presence of the two mutations (V 419 L, L 925 I) and to evaluate the genotypes with which they appear. Pyrosequencing showed the presence of mutation L 925 I in 17 of the 20 studied field strains with allele frequencies between 30 % and 100 %. Two of these strains additionally had the mutation V 419 L with allele frequencies between 40 % and 96 %. Results from tests on single bed bugs in each field strain showed non-mutated, heterozygous as well as homozygous mu-tated bed bugs for the substitution L 925 I. Relative mRNA-expression levels of the four CYP-genes cyp 397 a 1, cyp 398 a 1, cyp 4 cm 1 and cyp 6 dn 1 were determined with quantitative real time PCR for eight bed bug strains. 10 male and 10 female bed bugs were investigated per strain. The relative mRNA-expression levels of these four CYP-genes were examined among an insecticide susceptible strain and eight field strains, also comparing them with the mRNA-expression of three reference-genes. In four of the eight samples a higher relative mRNA-expression level of cyp 397 a 1 was detected. One strain showed higher mRNA-expression level of cyp 397 a 1 and cyp 398 a 1. The strain which showed the highest Ri was tested for pyrethroid-resistance under conditions of practice (choice trial system) with an insecticide primarily used for bed bug control. Pyrethroid-resistance was proven, as up to 50 % of the bed bugs survived. A previously developed choice trial system for simulated use-tests of contact insecticides was modified. Adding a plexiglass box allowed the testing of a variety of flexible and unflexible treated surfaces which are present in bed bug infested rooms, e. g. wood. Bed bugs were at-tracted by CO 2 and heat to mimic a potential host. They either crossed the insecticide treated surface or stayed in their shelter. Only the insects which crossed the treated surface were in-cluded in the effectiveness test. In contrast to non-choice surface contact bioassays, were bed bugs were exposed under no choice conditions for a defined time, the time period bed bugs spent on the treated surfaces in the choice test corresponded to their natural seeking behavior. The results showed that the choice experiment simulates a typical bed bug treatment in prac-tice under controlled and reproducible conditions. Therefore it should be used as an important supplement to non-choice surface contact bioassays. As bed bugs are obligate blood feeding insects, their rearing in the laboratory requires the keeping of small mammals as blood donors. The bed bugs used in this study were fed on rab-bits. In order to reduce the number of animals kept as blood donors, a membrane blood-feeding system that could feed all lifestages and large numbers of bed bugs was tested with different types of animal blood. Within the scope of this work it was not possible to establish a bed bug strain which was exclusively reared on the artificial feeder. The results showed that the mortality of the different lifestages as well as the reproduction rate depended on the type and quality of animal blood used in the experiments. Within our present state of knowledge in Germany no data about the current bed bug preva-lence are available. In order to obtain information towards the spread of bed bugs, a Germany-wide survey of pest control companies was conducted. With only 21 evaluable answers it was not possible to show representative data, but the tendency of growing numbers of bed bug treatments in private households and public facilities became apparent...|$|E
40|$|Rolling {{noise is}} {{excited by the}} {{roughness}} of the wheel/rail running surfaces.

The wheel/rail interaction model is applied to evaluate the <b>contact</b> <b>filter</b> effect for different sets of roughness data measured in several parallel lines. It is found that the 3 D contact model gives, as a general tendency, a contact force level several dB lower than the 2 D model.

40|$|Recent {{research}} {{has suggested that}} the contact mechanics between the wheel and rail in railway systems may act as a geometric filter for promoting the growth of short pitch wear-type corrugations. It has been proposed that this effect may explain some field observations indicating a speed insensitivity of the dominant wavelength of short pitch corrugation. In this paper, further insight into <b>contact</b> induced wear <b>filtering</b> is obtained and the relative importance of <b>contact</b> <b>filtering</b> and structural dynamics mechanisms on corrugation growth is quantified. In particular, an analytical model of the wear due to the rolling contact of a wheel over a general rail profile is first presented. This model is able to be implemented in an efficient manner and facilitates an investigation into the non-linear behaviour of the dynamic wear not discussed in previous research. In addition, the relative importance of this mechanism when compared to that of dynamic normal force variations on corrugation growth, is determined and quantified. Comparative results indicate that the <b>contact</b> <b>filtering</b> effect only significantly amplifies short pitch corrugation growth when corrugation amplitudes are small (order of 1 mu m). Over multiple vehicle passes, this contact amplifying effect is shown to decrease to a negligible level and the peak amplitude shifts to longer wavelengths. These <b>contact</b> <b>filter</b> effects are self-limiting on corrugation growth for wavelengths above the contact patch width. When quantitatively compared against corrugation growth due to structural dynamics, the <b>contact</b> <b>filtering</b> effect is shown to make a much smaller contribution to corrugation growth rates for this model of corrugation development, but it provides a lower bound on corrugation wavelength in accordance with Remington.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedThe trade-off between false alarm and detection probability {{is a fundamental}} challenge in the automated detection of contacts in passive sonar systems. A common approach is the application of highgain processing followed by successive classification criteria. Most classification schemes (e. g., matching of signature) are complex and tailored to specific target types. By contrast, the Doppler effect is readily observed in all contacts with discrete tonals and relative velocity to the receiver. This thesis demonstrates that the Doppler effect can be exploited to improve the detection process by <b>filtering</b> out <b>contacts</b> that do not exhibit these characteristics. Cross-correlation (matched <b>filtering)</b> of <b>contact</b> LOFARgrams with templates generated in situ with Doppler compression/dilation is used to achieve this. Velocity information {{and the range of}} the Closest Point of Approach (CPA) are estimated in the process.

Mineral oil was used to block the diffusion of the label through the unfilled pores in the filter. This technique permitted us to establish clearly that the rhizoids absorb all seven of the nutrients tested.

Cells grown in the presence of the microtubule synthesis inhibitors nocodazole and carbendazim elaborated only a stunted rhizoid system, so we examined their ability to accumulate the two classes of compounds.

40|$|Older {{drivers have}} one of the highest crash risks when {{distance}} driven is taken into consideration (Wood & Carberry, 2006). A possible explanation is that the increased prevalence of unilateral cataract in this group results in differential lens opacification which has been found to provoke a spontaneous Pulfrich effect: the paths of objects moving in a fronto-parallel plane to the observer are misjudged (Diaper, Heron, & MacMillan, 2002). Older drivers’ accidents are often multi-vehicle incidents at intersections. Intersections present {{a situation in which the}} Pulfrich effect may occur and interfere with judgements of other vehicles motion. The present study aimed to establish whether inducing the Pulfrich effect in younger drivers effects their judgements of vehicles at intersections. The effect was induced using neutral density filters (a no filter baseline, two-filters, left eye filtered, and right eye filtered) in 20 participants with provisional or open licenses aged between 19 and 54 years. Participants viewed on-road driving footage of target vehicles at intersections and roundabouts and predicted intersection judgements (the target vehicle’s contact with a sight line). To determine if the Pulfrich effect interferes with intersection judgements, two hypotheses were investigated.

The uptake kinetic of furalaxyl enantiomers fitted the first-order kinetics well and the calculated kinetic parameters {{were consistent with the}} low accumulation efficiency.

40|$|Deposited with {{permission}} of Giramondo PublishingBestseller lists are of fundamental symbolic {{importance to the}} publishing industry. They show not only what is selling, but how the industry sees itself. In their margins are written not only the tastes of readers, but the aspirations of publishers, the pretensions of authors, and the topography of the market. Until the late 1990 s in Australia such lists were generally compiled by the literary editors of major daily newspapers and literary magazines, who contacted booksellers and asked what was selling. Such lists were notoriously <b>filtered.</b> Those <b>contacted</b> were most often independents in inner-city locations, close to universities. Genre fiction would routinely be omitted from their quick, usually anecdotal, assessment of what was moving in the shop, along with any non-fiction deemed lowbrow and unbecoming, such as The Guinness Book of Records, a perennial bestseller in almost all bookshops. Instead, such lists were comprised almost entirely of literary fiction and literary non-fiction. Open Acces...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Chromatin {{conformation}} capture {{techniques have}} evolved rapidly {{over the last}} few years and have provided new insights into genome organization at an unprecedented resolution. Analysis of Hi-C data is complex and computationally intensive involving multiple tasks and requiring robust quality assessment. This has led to the development of several tools and methods for processing Hi-C data. However, most of the existing tools do not cover all aspects of the analysis and only offer few quality assessment options. Additionally, availability of a multitude of tools makes scientists wonder how these tools and associated parameters can be optimally used, and how potential discrepancies can be interpreted and resolved. Most importantly, investigators need to be ensured that slight changes in parameters and/or methods do not affect the conclusions of their studies. Results To address these issues (compare, explore and reproduce), we introduce HiC-bench, a configurable computational platform for comprehensive and reproducible analysis of Hi-C sequencing data. HiC-bench performs all common Hi-C analysis tasks, such as alignment, <b>filtering,</b> <b>contact</b> matrix generation and normalization, identification of topological domains, scoring and annotation of specific interactions using both published tools and our own. We have also embedded various tasks that perform quality assessment and visualization. HiC-bench is implemented as a data flow platform with an emphasis on analysis reproducibility. Additionally, the user can readily perform parameter exploration and comparison of different tools in a combinatorial manner that takes into account all desired parameter settings in each pipeline task. This unique feature facilitates the design and execution of complex benchmark studies that may involve combinations of multiple tool/parameter choices in each step of the analysis. To demonstrate the usefulness of our platform, we performed a comprehensive benchmark of existing and new TAD callers exploring different matrix correction methods, parameter settings and sequencing depths. Users can extend our pipeline by adding more tools as they become available. Conclusions HiC-bench consists an easy-to-use and extensible platform for comprehensive analysis of Hi-C datasets. We expect that it will facilitate current analyses and help scientists formulate and test new hypotheses in the field of three-dimensional genome organization...|$|R
40|$|A {{state-dependent}} {{method to}} model contact nonlinearities in rolling contacts is proposed. By pre-calculation of contact stiffness and <b>contact</b> <b>filters</b> as functions of vertical relative displacement, a computationally efficient modelling approach {{based on a}} moving point force description is developed. Simulations using the state-dependent model have been analysed by comparison with measurements. Results from the investigated case – consisting of a steel ball rolling over a steel beam having two different degrees of roughness – show good agreement between nonlinear simulations and measured beam vibrations. The promising results obtained with the proposed method are potentially applicable to wheel–rail interaction and rolling element bearings...|$|R
40|$|An {{unresolved}} {{and debated}} aspect {{in the fast}} pyrolysis of biomass is whether the bio-oil exits as a vapor or as an aerosol from the pyrolytic reactor. The determination of the bio-oil transport phase will have direct and {{significant impact on the}} design of fast pyrolysis systems. Optimization of both the removal of particulate matter and collection of bio-oil will require this information. In addition, the success of catalytic reforming of bio-oil to high-value chemicals will depend upon this transport phase.;A variety of experimental techniques were used to identify the transport phase. Some tests were as simple as examining the catch of an inline filter while others attempted to deduce whether vapor or aerosol predominated by examining the pressure drop across a flow restriction. In supplementary testing, the effect of char on aerosol formation and the potential impact of cracking during direct <b>contact</b> <b>filtering</b> are evaluated.;The study indicates that for pyrolysis of red oak approximately 90 wt-% of the collected bio-oil existed as a liquid aerosol. Conversely, the pyrolysis of corn starch produced bio-oil predominately in the vapor phase at the exit of the reactor. Furthermore, it was determined that the addition of char promotes the production of aerosols during pyrolysis of corn starch. Direct <b>contact</b> <b>filtering</b> of the product stream did not collect any liquids and the bio-oil yield was not significantly reduced indicating measurable cracking or coking did not occur...|$|R
40|$|If we {{limit the}} contact rate of worm traffic, can we {{alleviate}} and ultimately contain Internet worms? This paper {{sets out to}} answer this question. Specifically, {{we are interested in}} analyzing different deployment strategies of rate control mechanisms and the effect thereof on suppressing the spread of worm code. We use both analytical models and simulation experiments. We find that rate control at individual hosts or edge routers yields a slowdown that is linear in the number of hosts (or routers) with the rate limiting <b>filters.</b> Limiting <b>contact</b> rate at the backbone routers, however, is substantially more effective [...] it renders a slowdown comparable to deploying rate limiting filters at every individual host that is covered. This result holds true even when susceptible and infected hosts are patched and immunized dynamically. To provide context for our analysis, we examine real traffic traces obtained from a campus computing network. We observe that rate throttling could be enforced with minimal impact on legitimate communications. Two worms observed in the traces, however, would be significantly slowed down...|$|R

50|$|The {{paradigm}} {{structure for}} a cluster was chosen from the top-scoring 20 segments {{in the database}} as that with the smallest sum of mda values to the other 19. Other structural measures were tried before settling on these two: RMS deviation of a-carbon atoms (rmsd), dme alone, and a structural filter that looked for specific conserved contacts. The latter worked best in discriminating true and false positives, but could not be easily automated. The rmsd and dme {{were found to be}} poor discriminators of the two types of helix cap. The mda-dme combined filter best simulates the conserved <b>contacts</b> <b>filter</b> and is rapidly computed.|$|R
