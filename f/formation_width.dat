The purpose of this study was to gain knowledge in how shell geometry affects the performance of the shell relative to liner structural characteristics and impact conditions. Samples, representing a section of a hockey helmet, consisted of a shell with one of nine geometric <b>formations</b> (<b>width</b> and angle), and a liner (Dertex or EPP). Each sample was impacted three times at three different levels of energy using a monorail drop test. Significant differences were observed for all main effects and two-way interactions for both liner types. Overall the 90 degree angle and 16 mm width performed the best. It was found that geometry influences the elastic properties of the shell in a very specific way. It was also found that geometry can improve energy absorption by 4 - 35 % depending on the combination of other variables involved...|$|R

On this field, a study about geology structure that develops in the connection of a hydrocarbon trap. By means of the deepened interpretation of sub surface geology structure, it’s expected to be beneficial for the exploration of hydrocarbon. The data used on this research are seismic data as main data, together with regional data as a supporting data, seismic data are used for structure analysis and sub surface mapping of TARATARI field. Regional geology is very worthy in interpreting sub surface structure on the research area. The method that used in this research are analysis and descriptive. Based on the result of the research, the developing structure on the TARATARI field is dextral fault and anticline. The fault structure on vertical profile figure can be identified with the occurrence of flower structure. The dextral fault has a North-South oriented direction. Hydrocarbon trap formed on TARATARI field is a structural trap which controlled by anticline and fault. Based on result from this research, the structure that happened in area research are strike slip and anticline. Strike slip can showed by flower structure in line seismic. The orientation of Strike slip is North-South. Trap in this research area is structural trapping.

The interaction tends to create clusters of common opinion.

40|$|Sequence pattern {{avoidance}} is {{a central}} topic in combinatorics. A sequence s contains a sequence u if some subsequence of s can be changed into u by a one-to-one renaming of its letters. If s does not contain u, then s avoids u. A widely studied extremal function related to pattern avoidance is Ex(u, n), the maximum length of an n-letter sequence that avoids u and has every r consecutive letters pairwise distinct, where r {{is the number of}} distinct letters in u. We bound Ex(u, n) using the <b>formation</b> <b>width</b> function, fw(u), which is the minimum s for which there exists r such that any concatenation of s permutations, each on the same r letters, contains u. In particular, we identify every sequence u such that fw(u) = 4 and u contains ababa. The significance of this result lies in its implication that, for every such sequence u, we have Ex(u, n) = Θ(n α(n)), where α(n) denotes the incredibly slow-growing inverse Ackermann function. We have thus identified the extremal function of many infinite classes of previously unidentified sequences. Comment: 20 page...|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this project}} were to find correlations between the 'tidal flow' of traffic {{and the frequency of}} road crashes, as well as between various broad scale road environment factors and the frequency of road crashes. This was achieved through an in depth examination of crash data for the Southern District, as well as the combined data of the areas covered by the Toowoomba City Council and the Gatton Shire Council. When examining the data for correlations, the traffic flow and crash rate along with various road environment characteristics were considered. It was found that a greater traffic flow did not mean a greater crash rate would result with the time periods with lower traffic flow having higher crash rates. However, correlations were established between various road environment factors and the frequency of road crashes. Road environment characteristics that were found to influence the amount of road crashes included the seal width, pavement width, <b>formation</b> <b>width,</b> the speed limit zones and the AADT of the road.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{response}} of fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) reinforced engineered cementitious composite (ECC) members {{with a focus on}} their flexural load-deformation behavior, residual deflection, damage evolution, and failure mode. Critical aspects of conventional FRP-reinforced concrete members—such as interfacial bond strength, flexural crack formation, composite deformation behavior, and brittle failure mode—are briefly reviewed and compared to FRP reinforced ECC. The interaction of linear elastic FRP reinforcement and ECC matrix with ductile stress-strain behavior in tension results in nonlinear elastic flexural response characteristics with stable hysteretic behavior, small residual deflection, and ultimately gradual compression failure. Compatible deformations of reinforcement and matrix lead to low interfacial bond stress and prevent composite disintegration by bond splitting and cover spalling. Furthermore, flexural stiffness and strength as well as crack <b>formation</b> and <b>widths</b> in FRP-reinforced ECC members are found effectively independent of interfacial bond properties due to the tensile deformation characteristics of the cementitious matrix.

Most compounds inhibit {{the growth of}} HeLa cells about as efficiently as that of B. subtilis. However, butyrate and propionate, as well as acetaminophen, antipyrene, phenacetin, and salicylamide, inhibit HeLa at millimolar concentrations whereas, at least 10 times higher concentrations are needed to inhibit B. subtilis. The concentrations needed to inhibit growth by 50 % decrease with increasing octanol-water partition coefficients of the compound. Growth of E. coli is inhibited {{similar to that of}} B. subtilis by all compounds except butylbenzoate, decanoate, and linoleate which cannot penetrate the lipopolysaccharide layer. All growth inhibitors inhibit amino acid uptake into bacteria and their vesicles, and oxygen consumption in bacteria. In HeLa cells or human fibroblasts, neither amino acid uptake nor adenine 5 ′-triphosphate synthesis are inhibited by fatty acids at concentrations that completely inhibit growth. Short chain fatty acids (propionate, butyrate, and pentanoate) induce in HeLa the formation of cell processes. In neuroblastoma cells, grown in the presence of 10 % fetal calf serum, butyrate also induces such processes which slowly continue to grow in length for at least 7 days; these processes differ in speed of <b>formation,</b> <b>width,</b> and cycloheximide susceptibility from the thin processes produced by serum deprivation alone...|$|E

Surgical resection of the osteophyte {{has been reported}} to be an effective treatment; however, little study has been given to the recurrences of osteophytes. A prospective study was performed for seven patients who underwent surgical resection of cervical anterior osteophytes for the treatment of recalcitrant dysphagia caused by osteophytes that accompanied DISH. The seven patients were six men and one woman ranging in age from 55 to 78  years (mean age =  65  years). After a mean postoperative follow-up period of 9  years (range: 6 – 13  years), surgical outcomes were evaluated by symptom severity and plain radiographs of the cervical spine. On all operated intervertebral segments, the effect of postoperative intervertebral mobility (range of movement > 1  degree) on the incidence of recurrent osteophytic <b>formation</b> (<b>width</b> > 2  mm) was analyzed by Fisher’s exact test. Complete relief of the dysphagia was obtained within one month postoperatively in five patients, while it was delayed for 3  months in two patients. All of the patients developed recurrent cervical osteophytic formation, with an average increase rate of approximately 1  mm/year following surgical resection. Of the 20 operated intervertebral segments, the incidence of recurrent osteophytes was significantly higher (P =  0. 0013) in the 16 segments with mobility than in the four segments without mobility. Five of the seven patients remained asymptomatic, although radiological recurrence of osteophytes was seen at the final follow-up. The two remaining patients complained of moderate dysphagia 10 and 11  years after surgery, respectively; one of these two required re-operation due to progressive dysphagia 11  years postoperatively. In patients with cervical DISH and dysphagia, surgical resection of osteophytes resulted in a high likelihood of the recurrence of osteophytes. Therefore, attending surgeons should continue to follow these patients postoperatively for more than 10  years in order to assess the regrowth of osteophytes that may contribute to recurrent symptoms...|$|E

Th e measurement of hippocampal formation dimensions, and comparisons between {{the right and the}} left side were done using evaluate- distance program on the MRI instrument of the Institute of Radiology at Sarajevo Clinics Center. We tested patients with PTSD, years of average age with standard deviation of, years. Based on the analysis of our results regarding the size of hippocampal formation in all the three projections (axial, coronal and sagital), in the group of patients with PTSD, we can the make the following observations:. In axial slice the length of hippocampal formation measured on the left and right side is signifi cantly asymmetric in all patients. In the sagital slice, the hippocampal formation mea-sured on the left side is in many cases longer than in the right –. In coronal slice no signifi cant diff erences were found in the proportion of patients according to symmetry/asymmetry of hippocampal <b>formation</b> <b>width</b> on the left and right.. Th e diff erence in average size of hippocampal formation between the left and right side measured in axial and coronal slices is not statistically signifi cant, but it is signifi cant in sagitall slice. So, the results of this new research, showed smaller hippocampal dimensions in PTSD as measured using MRI. We have to be careful about what projection we are refusing to as being watched hippocampal formation because the results will depend on that.

An increase in NaOH concentration (from 0. 0075 to 8. 0 M) resulted in a shift of the anodic current onset to negative values, from − 1. 12 to − 1. 4 V vs. SCE and significant increase of anodic current, up to values above 10 − 3 A/cm 2. A pronounced increase of anodic current was detected for NaOH concentrations above 1. 0 M.

We report here the {{cloning and functional characterization}} of a Populus class-I KNOX homeobox gene, ARBORKNOX 2 (ARK 2), which we show influences terminal cell differentiation and cell wall properties during secondary growth. In the early stages of secondary growth, ARK 2 is expressed broadly in the cambial zone and in terminally differentiating cell types, before becoming progressively restricted to the cambium. ARK 20 verexpression and synthetic miRNA-suppression' transgenics reveal positi'lle correlations between ARK 2 expression level and the timing of cambium <b>formation,</b> the <b>width</b> of the cambial zone and inhibition of cambial daughter cell differentiation.

Together, our results suggest that ARK 2 functions primarily to regulate a complex suite of genes that together influence cell differentiation during secondary growth.

5000|$|Around implants, {{biologic}} <b>width</b> <b>formation</b> has classically led {{to about}} 1.5 - 2 mm of bone {{loss in the}} vertical dimension at the coronal aspect of the implants because the abutment that attaches to the implant was often removed many times to allow for impression taking, abutment changing and other related clinical functions. As such, the epithelial and connective tissue protection for the bone was unable to reliably form on the continuously disrupted abutment attachment surface and in reaction to this, bone loss occurred on the implant {{in order to provide}} the dimension necessary for the epithelium and soft connective tissue attachment to the implant fixture itself—this defined early implant placement and was often colloquially referred to as [...] "bone loss to the first thread." [...] This vertical loss of bone (X in the diagram at right) diminishes the bone-to-implant contact, contributing to a potential decrease in long-term biomechanical stability and has been well researched.|$|R
5000|$|Z-DNA {{is quite}} {{different}} from the right-handed forms. In fact, Z-DNA is often compared against B-DNA in order to illustrate the major differences. The Z-DNA helix is left-handed and has a structure that repeats every 2 base pairs. The major and minor grooves, unlike A- and B-DNA, show little difference in <b>width.</b> <b>Formation</b> of this structure is generally unfavourable, although certain conditions can promote it; such as alternating purine-pyrimidine sequence (especially poly(dGC)2), negative DNA supercoiling or high salt and some cations (all at physiological temperature, 37 °C, and pH 7.3-7.4). Z-DNA can form a junction with B-DNA (called a [...] "B-to-Z junction box") in a structure which involves the extrusion of a base pair. The Z-DNA conformation has been difficult to study because it does not exist as a stable feature of the double helix. Instead, it is a transient structure that is occasionally induced by biological activity and then quickly disappears.|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Validation of choroidal {{thickness}} {{and other}} biometrics measured by spectral domain {{optical coherence tomography}} (SD-OCT) in predicting lacquer cracks formation in highly myopic eyes. Methods: Patients with a refractive error worse than − 8 diopters and moderate myopic maculopathy were recruited into two groups based on {{the presence or absence}} of lacquer cracks (36 eyes without and 33 eyes with lacquer cracks). Choroidal thickness, refractive error, and axial length were measured and subjected to receiver operating characteristic curve analysis to identify the optimal cutoff values at predicting lacquer crack <b>formation.</b> The <b>width</b> of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), RPE to the inner segment/outer segment line, RPE to the external limiting membrane were also measured and compared to the subfoveal choroidal thickness to assess their relationships as potential markers of lacquer crack formation. Results: Lacquer crack is associated with decreased choroidal thickness, lower best-corrected visual acuity, longer axial length and higher refractive errors. Choroidal thickness has the strongest association with lacquer crack formation versus axial length and refractive error. In eyes with lacquer cracks, stellate lacquer cracks are associated with thinner choroidal thickness compared to eyes with linear lacquer cracks. Subfoveal choroidal thickness less than the width of the retinal pigment epithelium to the inner segment/outer segment line is also associated with lacquer crack formation (sensitivity 78. 8 %, specificity 88. 3 %, and accuracy 81. 2 %). Conclusions: This study suggests that choroidal thickness and other SD-OCT measurements could be employed clinically to predict the development and severity of lacquer cracks in patients with high myopia...|$|R
