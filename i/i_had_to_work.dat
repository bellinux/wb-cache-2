5|$|It all {{happened}} that night. She {{told us the}} title of the song, the concept and sang us the melody. We usually have Big Jim Wright sit in on those kind of sessions to work out the chords. he wasn't there so <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> on the chord myself. So I was playing and there was a part where I said 'Man, what chord am I supposed to do here?' and Mariah has such a good ear that she sang me the chord.|$|E
25|$|Bread and Alley was {{my first}} {{experience}} in cinema and I must say a very difficult one. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with a very young child, a dog, and an unprofessional crew except for the cinematographer, who was nagging and complaining all the time. Well, the cinematographer, in a sense, was right because I did not follow the conventions of film making that he had become accustomed to.|$|E
500|$|Looking {{back at the}} {{creation}} of the album, guitarist Frank Iero was blasé about [...] the band received for this decidedly [...] "non-scene" [...] record. [...] "When we did Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge, we didn't fit in," [...] he said. [...] "There was a little less screaming and a little more melody, but it was still us. Never was it a case of, 'Don't put that melody there because Hardcore Chuck, who took me to my first show at Fairfield American Legion Hall, {{is really going to be}} bummed at me.' I don’t give a shit: If <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> at McDonald's for the rest of my life to play shows and ride in a shitty van on tour? I've done it. I'll do it again." ...|$|E

500|$|Although Ocean had {{creative}} {{freedom for}} both projects, he felt more confident as a songwriter for Channel Orange and typed his lyrics on a laptop rather than composing {{in his head}} as he had done for Nostalgia, Ultra. Since transitioning from writing for other artists, he had been influenced by his [...] "gloriously painful love life" [...] when writing songs. For his lyrics, Ocean used both his past personal experiences and imagination to compose narratives for songs. He was inspired to write the song [...] "Crack Rock" [...] by stories he heard sitting in on Narcotics Anonymous and Alcoholics Anonymous groups mentored by his grandfather, who also dealt with substance abuse in his youth. In an interview for The Guardian, Ocean expressed uncertainty about his penchant for darker subject matter, but speculated that [...] "those were the colours <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with on those days. ... I mean, 'experience' is an interesting word. I just bear witness." ...|$|E
500|$|Moore {{described}} the recording process as challenging {{because she was}} provided with little visual aid, explaining, [...] "All <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> off were a few sketches ... {{but it was also}} fun because it allows you to go into the depths of your imagination." [...] She also revealed that creating Rapunzel's voice was simply a process of [...] "let go". Moore was often required to re-record a single line a total of four times before the directors finally heard a version with which they were satisfied. After watching the completed film for the first time, Moore was disappointed with her own performance because she felt that her voice sounded [...] "shrill". According to composer Alan Menken, Moore's musical background made her [...] "a delight to work with". Moore found the practice of performing in character challenging in comparison to recording her own original music, explaining, [...] "I can't just be like Mandy and sing something the way that I want to necessarily, because you know, you sort of have to stick to certain guidelines." [...] She found recording [...] "When Will My Life Begin" [...] particularly difficult due to the speed at which she had to say certain words, and cites both Menken and discovering Rapunzel herself as a character with guiding her through the process.|$|E
500|$|The Braves {{opened the}} third inning with {{back-to-back}} singles by Ozzie Virgil and Terry Blocker. Hershiser responded by striking out opposing pitcher Rick Mahler and Ron Gant and then retiring Jeff Blauser on a flyball to left. In the seventh inning, a double by Andrés Thomas was followed with an error by Franklin Stubbs, giving the Braves runners at first and third. Hershiser loaded the bases with an intentional walk before retiring Mahler and Gant again. Gant's flyball sent Gibson to the outfield wall. Hershiser felt this was his worst outing of his six consecutive complete games saying: [...] "It was the worst I've thrown {{in the last five}} or six starts,...I was really inconsistent. I didn't have good stuff or location. I couldn't establish a pattern. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> hard adjusting and got away with pitches I wouldn't have if I was going badly." [...] The Dodgers' only run came in the ninth inning on what newspapers described as a successful hit and run play in which Mike Marshall on a 2-2 count doubled Kirk Gibson in from first base. However, as recalled by Marshall: [...] "Let me tell you, it wasn't a hit-and-run. [...] Gibby was probably going with two strikes. [...] We never would hit-and-run with us. [...] You can call it a run-and-hit." [...] Orel and wife Jamie, scheduled induced labor for the following day, an off day for the Dodgers.|$|E

2500|$|The {{design of}} the tower {{received}} {{a fair share of}} criticism. [...] According to Cesar Pelli, the most damaging criticism came from Prince Charles, who said on national television, [...] "I personally would go mad if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> in a place like that". [...] Other criticisms came from former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who said that the building was [...] "not quite stunning".|$|E
2500|$|DeLonge {{first began}} skateboarding {{in the third}} grade, which would consume much his {{activity}} outside of school. [...] "I lived, ate, and breathed skateboarding. All I did all day long was skateboard. It was all I cared about," [...] he later remarked. He and friends would begin at one side of San Diego and attempt to skateboard to the other half, intermittently pulling pranks on people in the process. As such, he was an average student: [...] "I knew exactly how hard <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> in school. As long as I got that C, I wouldn't try one minute extra to get a B. I just cared about skateboarding and music." [...] His parents were constantly fighting in his formative years, culminating in a divorce when DeLonge was 18. [...] Shortly thereafter, his mother lost her job. DeLonge promptly moved out, feeling as though he needed to start his life. His brother was also away {{at that time in}} the United States Army, and his departure affected his family. [...] "My mom and sister were left asking, 'What happened to our family?'".|$|E

[...] He hardly knew which of his studies he liked best. [...] "Physics," [...] he said, [...] "is a wonderful study. I got five per cent in it. But, by Jove! <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> for it. I'd go in for it altogether if they'd let me." ...|$|E
60|$|MRS WARREN. Yes; or {{any other}} point of view. What is any respectable girl brought up to do but to catch some rich man's fancy and get the benefit of his money by marrying him?--as if a {{marriage}} ceremony could make any difference in the right or wrong of the thing! Oh, the hypocrisy of the world makes me sick! Liz and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> and save and calculate just like other people; elseways we should be as poor as any good-for-nothing drunken waster of a woman that thinks her luck will last for ever. [With great energy] I despise such people: theyve no character; and if theres a thing I hate in a woman, it's want of character.|$|E
60|$|I do {{not feel}} now the logical force of the process that must have {{convinced}} me then that I had made my sacrifice and spent my strength in vain. At no time had I been under any illusion that the Tory party had higher ideals than any other party, yet {{it came to me}} like a thing newly discovered that the men <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with had for the most part no such dreams, no sense of any collective purpose, no atom of the faith I held. They were just as immediately intent upon personal ends, just as limited by habits of thought, as the men in any other group or party. Perhaps I had slipped unawares for a time into the delusions of a party man--but I do not think so.|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{good many}} things that you don't dream of. You are not {{treating}} me rightly, and you know it.

6000|$|MANGAN [shuddering liverishly]. Too rich: I can't eat such things. I suppose it's because <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> so {{much with}} my brain.

6000|$|... "I am only twenty-nine. I {{started at}} eighteen, {{and got to}} the top of the tree in seven years. I came down quicker than I went up. I might have gone on easily for fifteen years more, only for {{drinking}} champagne. I wish I had my life to live over again: you wouldnt catch me playing burlesque. If I had got the chance, I know I could have played tragedy or real Italian opera. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> hard at first; and they wont fill my place, very readily: thats one comfort. My cleverness was my ruin. Ned was not half so quick. It used to take him months to learn things that I picked up offhand, and yet you see how much better he has done than I." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{night was}} so rainy that the sentries {{preferred}} their boxes, {{and did not}} disturb me in my work. The log-house was built with upright posts, deeply fixed in the ground, and horizontal logs laid upon it. I had to dig under these, and work a hole sufficient to admit my body to pass. I began in the dark, soon after tattoo. It was some while after midnight before my work was done, when I lifted my hand up under the log and felt the rain from without falling upon it. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> very cautiously for two hours after that, and then crept through to the parapet and silently flung my rope over the gun; not without a little tremor of heart, lest the sentry should see me and send a charge of lead into my body.|$|E
6000|$|... "I used {{to think}} of him," [...] she pursued, {{dropping}} her voice and moving closer to me, [...] "I {{used to think}} of him when Percival left me alone at night to go among the Opera people. I used to fancy what I might have been if it had pleased God to bless me with poverty, and if I had been his wife. I used to see myself in my neat cheap gown, sitting at home and waiting for him while he was earning our bread--sitting at home and working for him and loving him all the better because <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> for him--seeing him come in tired and taking off his hat and coat for him, and, Marian, pleasing him with little dishes at dinner that I had learnt to make for his sake. Oh! I hope he is never lonely enough and sad enough to think of me and see me as I have thought of HIM and see HIM!" ...|$|E
