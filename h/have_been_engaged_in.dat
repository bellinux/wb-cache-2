5|$|In May 2014, Prime Minister Shinzō Abe said Japan {{wanted to}} shed the passiveness it has {{maintained}} {{since the end}} of World War II and take more responsibility for regional security.

5|$|A harsh anti-union clampdown {{followed}} the Haymarket incident.

25|$|There is no {{evidence}} that Samuel Maverick ever owned any other cattle and no other stock at all, beyond a few horses.
