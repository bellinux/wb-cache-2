5|$|After a gap {{of several}} <b>decades,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early 1980s, Vimala Begley studied the {{ceramics}} find {{of the site}} and proposed a preliminary version of the chronology of the occupation of the site.

5|$|Despite the disappointment, the Commonwealth {{was able}} to take {{advantage}} of the Russian weakness and through the territorial advances accomplished to reverse the eastern losses suffered in the earlier <b>decades.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> Truce of Deulino of 1619 the Rzeczpospolita was granted the Smolensk, Chernihiv and Novhorod-Siverskyi regions.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{television}} programmes have included references to Aston Villa {{over the past}} few <b>decades.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> sitcom Porridge, the character Lennie Godber is a Villa supporter. When filming began on Dad's Army, Villa fan Ian Lavender was allowed to choose Frank Pike's scarf from an array in the BBC wardrobe; he chose a claret and blue one—Aston Villa's colours. The character Nessa in the BBC sitcom Gavin & Stacey was revealed as an Aston Villa fan in an episode screened in December 2009.|$|E

5|$|A similar {{initiative}} {{came from}} Norman Pierre Gentieu (1914–2009), an American writer who discovered Sorabji by reading his book Around Music {{just after the}} Second World War. Because of the post-war shortages in England, Gentieu sent Sorabji some provisions, {{and the depth of}} their friendship appears to have been such that he continued to do so for the next four <b>decades.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> early 1950s Gentieu made an offer to Sorabji to pay for the microfilming of his major piano works and to give some copies to selected libraries. All of his unpublished musical manuscripts were eventually microfilmed. Gentieu also sent Sorabji a tape recorder to record some of his music, but Sorabji did not do so.|$|E
5|$|After the {{collapse}} of Imperial Germany in November 1918, the Finns sought new political partners. The United Kingdom had been a significant trading partner since the 18th century, and the Finns worked to improve the relations {{for the next two}} <b>decades.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> 1930s Finland purchased Thornycroft torpedo boats from the United Kingdom, and also refrained from buying bomber aircraft from Germany because of British protests, purchasing instead modern Bristol Blenheims, which later served successfully during the Winter War.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} the war, Pillau was ceded to Italy as a war {{prize in}} 1920. Renamed Bari, she was {{commissioned}} in the Regia Marina (Royal Navy) in January 1924.

In 1943, she was slated to become an anti-aircraft defense ship, but while awaiting conversion, she was sunk by USAAF bombers in Livorno in June 1943. The wreck was partially scrapped by the Germans in 1944, and ultimately raised for scrapping in January 1948.|$|E

5|$|Famous Fantastic Mysteries was an American {{science fiction}} and fantasy pulp {{magazine}} published from 1939 to 1953. The editor was Mary Gnaedinger. It was {{launched by the}} Munsey Company {{as a way to}} reprint the many science fiction and fantasy stories which had appeared over the preceding <b>decades</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Munsey magazines, such as Argosy. The first issue was dated September/October 1939; the magazine was immediately successful, and {{less than a year later}} a companion magazine, Fantastic Novels, was launched.|$|E
5|$|Forrest Gump is a 1994 American comedy-drama film {{based on}} the 1986 novel {{of the same name}} by Winston Groom. The film was {{directed}} by Robert Zemeckis and stars Tom Hanks, Robin Wright, Gary Sinise, Mykelti Williamson, and Sally Field. The story depicts several <b>decades</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> life of Forrest Gump, a slow-witted but kind-hearted, good-natured and athletically prodigious man from Alabama, who witnesses, and in some cases influences, some of the defining events of {{the latter half of the}} 20th century in the United States; more specifically, the period between Forrest's birth in 1944 and 1982. The film differs substantially from Winston Groom's novel, including Gump's personality and several events that were depicted.|$|E

5|$|Freight volumes {{remained}} high {{throughout the}} following <b>decades.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> late 1950s, the Swedish Air Force built a 32 million kroner storage area for aviation fuel at Muruvik. The terminal {{would be a}} reserve {{in case of an}} attack on Sweden, and the Meråker Line was to be used to transport the fuel into Sweden. The depot was sold in 1988 to Petrofina, following the Royal Norwegian Air Force's quest to build a pipeline to the NATO-base at Trondheim Airport, Værnes.|$|E
5|$|In Southern Rhodesia, the UFP {{lost the}} hold that {{it and its}} {{successor}} parties had for <b>decades</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> October election. Ian Smith, a former federal member of the UFP, had united with Winston Field of the Dominion Party to form the Rhodesian Front, a conservative party that was opposed to a fast rate of African political advancement and the 1961 constitution, and in support of Southern Rhodesian independence. The RF won 55% of the vote and 35 A-roll seats, while the UFP won 44% of the vote, 15 A-roll seats and 14 B-roll seats. Welensky now had parties in power in all three territorial legislatures that were opposed to the federation and advocating independence for their respective territories.|$|E
5|$|In the Aleutian Islands, {{a massive}} and {{unexpected}} disappearance of sea otters {{has occurred in}} recent <b>decades.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> 1980s, the area was home to an estimated 55,000 to 100,000 sea otters, but the population fell to around 6,000 animals by 2000. The most widely accepted, but still controversial, hypothesis is that killer whales have been eating the otters. The pattern of disappearances {{is consistent with a}} rise in predation, but there has been no direct evidence of orcas preying on sea otters to any significant extent.|$|E

He also supported the requests by {{human rights organizations}} to turn the former detention centers into memorials for the disappeared. Argentina became a signatory of the UN Convention on the Non-Applicability of Statutory Limitations to War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity in 2003. A creative interpretation of the convention by the courts allowed them to circumvent the statutory limitations to crimes committed <b>decades</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past, and also the ex post facto applicability of laws that were not in force {{at the time of}} the crimes.|$|E
5|$|Phantom Thread, set {{during the}} London fashion {{industry}} in the 1950s, is scheduled for release on Christmas Day 2017.

The cast also includes Lesley Manville, Vicky Krieps and Richard Graham. In September 2016, the U.S. distribution rights were acquired by Focus Features, with Universal handling international distribution. Principal photography began in January 2017, with Anderson also serving as the film's cinematographer, as Robert Elswit was unavailable during production.|$|E
5|$|The direct {{ancestor}} of these used in France and England {{was in the}} Namur region {{in what is now}} Wallonia (Belgium). From there, they spread first to the Pays de Bray on the eastern boundary of Normandy and from there to the Weald of Sussex, where the first furnace (called Queenstock) in Buxted was built in about 1491, followed by one at Newbridge in Ashdown Forest in 1496. They remained few in number until about 1530 but many were built in the following <b>decades</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Weald, where the iron industry perhaps reached its peak about 1590. Most of the pig iron from these furnaces was taken to finery forges for the production of bar iron.|$|E

Composed of Muslim Albanians with mostly German and Yugoslav Volksdeutsche (ethnic German) officers and non-commissioned officers, it was given the title Skanderbeg after medieval Albanian lord George Kastrioti Skanderbeg, who defended the region of Albania against the Ottoman Empire for more than two <b>decades</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 15th century.|$|E
5|$|The {{lighthouse}} {{has been}} threatened by erosion for <b>decades.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> 1930s, {{as a response}} to the erosion, a breakwater was constructed to protect the boat landing area. In 1996, the Connecticut Trust for Historic Preservation and the National Trust for Historic Preservation assisted the task of obtaining funding for a $4.5 million erosion-control project. The funds were approved in 1998 with the help of Connecticut Senators, Joseph Lieberman and Christopher Dodd and New Haven's Congressional Representative Rosa DeLauro. In 2001, the construction of a stone wall and creation of a buffer zone was completed. The second phase of the project calls for protective revetment on the south side of the island.|$|E
5|$|Western {{attitudes towards}} killer whales have changed {{dramatically}} in recent <b>decades.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> mid-1960s and early 1970s, killer whales came to much greater public and scientific awareness, {{starting with the}} first live-capture and display of a killer whale known as Moby Doll, a resident harpooned off Saturna Island in 1964. So little was known at the time, it was nearly {{two months before the}} whale's keepers discovered what food (fish) it was willing to eat. To the surprise of those who saw him, Moby Doll was a docile, nonaggressive whale that made no attempts to attack humans.|$|E
