40|$|International audienceThe most {{commonly}} used method of protection is <b>explosion</b> <b>venting.</b> In its simplest form, a vent is an aperture in the top or side of a vessel to provide a means of pressure relief during an explosion {{in order to achieve}} a reduced explosion pressure Pred. The efficiency of this protection method has been proven by a large number of experiments and documented industrial explosions by which the <b>explosion</b> <b>venting</b> provided adequate protection. From these experiments several correlations have been established to design venting systems. When compared with realistic, less controlled experiments, it appears that the reduced explosion overpressures may be over predicted but also under predicted. During the last ten years, researchers have devoted significant effort and time to study this problem. The state of the dust cloud at ignition and more specificly the initial turbulence has been identified as being a major contributing factor. This paper aims at presenting a technique to take the turbulence into account when designing an <b>explosion</b> <b>venting</b> system...|$|R

40|$|The primary {{objectives}} of the described research were to examine the underlying physical phenomena occurring during flame/obstacles interactions in various chambers of low L/D ratio {{and to develop a}} new empirical equation for <b>explosion</b> <b>venting.</b> A literature review suggested that the propagating flame/obstacle interactions in enclosures with large L/D ratio (> 2) result in flame acceleration and subsequent pressure build-up during a gas explosion. However, the interactions in practical situations with small L/D < 2 were not extensively studied. In this thesis the first investigation involved the flame interaction with different single and multiple obstacles in a 1 / 20 th model of real enclosure. Results provided the basis for flame propagation, local flame displacement speed probability density functions (pdfs), mean flame velocity and explosion pressure. The second investigation of the study involved the flame interaction with multiple bars within chambers of different L/D ratios. The results provided mean flame velocities on each stage, as a function of nondimensional time, and pressure developments as a function of L/D ratio. The final investigation is associated with gas <b>explosion</b> <b>venting.</b> The predictive ability between existing models on <b>explosion</b> <b>venting</b> and experimental results obtained in this thesis were undertaken and found to be deficient. Consequently a new empirical model for predicting <b>explosion</b> <b>venting</b> was developed. The new model was validated with experimental data published in literature...|$|R

40|$|Current <b>explosion</b> <b>vent</b> design {{correlations}} {{and guidance}} {{are based on}} an experimental data base of centrally ignited vented tests. However, there is evidence in the literature that ignition positions other than central produce higher overpressures. The objective of this work was to compare central and end ignition of vented explosions in a 10 L and a 200 L cylindrical vessels of L/D of 2. 8 and 2 respectively, with vent area coefficients of 10. 9, 5. 4 and 3. 1 for free venting. Methane-air (10 % v/v) and ethylene-air (7. 5 %) explosion tests were carried out using a 16 J spark ignition {{at the far end}} wall opposite the vent and half way {{along the length of the}} vessel. The results showed that for both vessels and for both gas/air mixtures end ignition produced the highest overpressures. This was attributed to the higher axial flame speed towards the vent with far end ignition, inducing higher vent mass flows and higher external flame speeds and associated overpressures. The present results and other data from the literature show that the vent design guides may not be based on sufficiently conservative data and need to be reviewed...|$|E
40|$|Explosion venting {{technology}} is widely accepted as the effective constructional protection measures against {{gas and dust}} explosions. The key problem in venting is the appropriate design of the vent area necessary for an effective release of the material i. e. the pressure developed during explosion did not cause any damage to the plant protected. Current gas <b>explosion</b> <b>vent</b> design standards in the USA (NFPA 68, 2002) and European (2007) rely on the vent correlation first published by Bartknecht in 1993 (Siwek, 1996). N FPA 68 also recommends the correlation of Swift (Swift, 1983) at low overpressures. For a vent to give no increase in overpressure other than that due to the pressure difference created by the mass flow of unburnt gases through the vent, the vent mass flow rate {{is assumed to be}} equal to the maximum mass burning rate of the flame and this consideration should be used as the design mass flow through the vent. Two different methods (Method I and Method 2) have been proposed based on the Sμ and Sμ (E- 1) to describe the maximum mass burning rate given as, mb = ASμpμ=CdeA(2 pPμred) o. 5 mb =ASgPm =AgSμ(E-I) P μ=Cde 4,(2 pu Pred) 0, 5 (2) The equation given in (2) is slightly different from (1) as is about 6. 5 times the mass flow of the first method as it takes the effect of (E- 1) where E is the expansion ratio. A critical review were carried out for the applicability, validity and limitation on the venting correlations adopted in NFPA 68 and European Standard with 470 literature experimental data, covering a wide range of values for vessel volume and geometries, bursting vent pressure, Pv L/D ratio, maximum reduced pressure, Pred and ignition location. The fuels involved are methane, propane, hydrogen, town gas, ethylene, acetone/air mixtures with the most hazardous near-stoichiornetric fuel-air concentration. Besides, Molkov's equation (Molkov, 2001) which is regarded as alternative venting design offered in NFPA 68 and Bradley and Mitcheson's equation for safe venting design were also analysed on the experimental data for their validity and limitation as well as the proposed methods. From the results, it is clear that Bartknecht's equation gave a satisfactory result with experimental data for K 200 mbar, providing the parameter PV is added into the equation. Method 2 gave a good agreement to most of the experimental data as it followed assumptions applied for correlations given by Bradley and Mitcheson for safe venting design (Bradley and Mitcheson, 1978 a,B radley and Mitcheson, 1978 b). It is also proven that the vent coefficient, K is confident to be used in quantifying the vessel's geometry for cubic vessel and the use of As/Av term is more favourable for non-cubic vessels. To justify the validity and applicability of the proposed methods, series of simply vented experiments were carried out, involving two different cylindrical volumes i. e. 0. 2 and 0. 0065 M 3. It is found that self acceleration plays important role in bigger vessel in determining the final Pmax inside the vessel. Method 2 gave closer prediction on Pmax in respect with other studied correlations. The investigation of vented gas explosion is explored further with the relief pipe been connected to the vessel at different fuel/air equivalence ratios, ignition position and Pv. The results demonstrate that the magnitude of Pmax was increased corresponding to the increase of Pv- From the experiments,it is found that peak pressure with strong acoustic behaviour is observed related to increase in Pv and in some cases,significant detonation spike was also observed particularly in high burning velocity mixtures. It is found that substantial amount of unburnt gases left inside the vessel after the vent burst is the leading factor in increase of Pmax for high burning velocity mixtures at centrally ignited. The associate gas velocities ahead of the flame create high unburnt gas flows conditions at entry to the vent and this give rise to high back pressures which lead to the severity in final Pmax inside the vessel. It was observed that end ignition leads to a higher explosion severity than central ignition in most cases, implying that central ignition is not a worst-case scenario in gas vented explosions as reported previously...|$|E

The presence of a duct {{has been reported to}} severely increase the violence of the <b>vented</b> <b>explosion</b> posing a problem for the proper design of the venting device.

A 10 L cylindrical vessel of 460 mm length and 162 mm diameter (L/D= 2. 8) was used for <b>vented</b> <b>explosion</b> with free <b>venting</b> (without a vent cover).

The position of the spark ignition was in the centre of the end flange opposite the vent. It was shown for the non-central vent that the flame speed upstream of the vent was lower than for a central vent and this reduced the mass flow through the vent, which reduced the overpressure and reducing the external explosion due to the lower exit velocity of the unburnt gas and hence lower external turbulence. The external flame jets downstream of the vent was influenced by the increase in characteristic length scale of the vent, which was changed by increasing the number of vents...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Bucket {{elevators}} are {{devices for}} the vertical conveying of bulk materials. They {{can be found}} in many plants where silos are used. There are different designs of bucket elevators, whereby for the conveying of combustible bulk materials twin-leg bucket elevators are widely used. The conveyed bulk materials might be quite different, e. g. granulates, grains or pellets, which can contain more or less fine dust. The fine dust will be whirled up and dispersed by the moving buckets. Explosive dust/air mixtures can occur inside the elevator. Bucket elevators are frequently reported as causes of dust explosions [1, 2]. Depending on both the practical operating conditions and the explosion characteristics of the bulk material in many cases explosion protection by prevention of ignition sources are not sufficient to minimize the risk of a dust explosion. Therefore, additional explosion protection by design measures is required in order to limit the dangerous effects of a dust explosion. The technical rules or standards, however, which are available for the layout of explosion protection by design measures, e. g. <b>explosion</b> pressure <b>venting</b> or <b>explosion</b> suppression can not be used due to the specific geometry of bucket elevators.

Results have evidenced that the severity of ducted explosions is mainly driven by the vigorous secondary explosion occurring in the duct (burn-up) rather than by the duct flow resistance or acoustic enhancement. Moreover, it has been found out that the burn-up affects explosion severity due to the reduction of venting rate rather than to the burning rate enhancement through turbulization. © 2006 Elsevier B.
