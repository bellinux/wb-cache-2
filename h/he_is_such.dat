He would knock down trophies of his sister and challenge his sister Krystal to games. His sister later said, [...] "Most people learn basketball early on with a one-on-one kind of mentality... Tim {{at an early age}} didn't have that. He always wanted to make the team better and {{do whatever it takes to}} help team out. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>such</b> a true point guard." [...] In his childhood, he was considered too small for contact sports, but was noted for his quickness, which helped him thrive as a guard on the court.|$|E
500|$|The band's {{style of}} music {{developed}} {{with the arrival}} of Frusciante; producer Michael Beinhorn observed, [...] "It was apparent early on that John was the perfect guitarist for the band—he brought the elements of songwriting and composition to the band which they'd never truly had prior to his involvement. I believe that John is a pivotal figure in the Chili Peppers, being that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>such</b> a distinctive songwriter." [...] Frusciante altered the band's sound by introducing melodies, harmonies and more complex song structures. In contrast to the group's previous albums, which featured groove and rhythm-based songs, Mother's Milk contained melodic compositions that reflected the new guitarist's influence. Most of the record, due to Beinhorn's presence, is composed of heavy metal guitar riffs and excessive layering.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} night, Jerry, Elaine, and George {{have dinner}} with Elaine's father, writer Alton Benes. While preparing for the dinner, George arrives at Jerry's apartment with the song [...] "Master of the House" [...] from the musical Les Misérables stuck in his head. George and Jerry are both very nervous to meet Alton because <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>such</b> a famous author. When {{they are about to}} leave, Jerry puts on his new jacket. George is very impressed and attempts to get Jerry to reveal its cost. Kramer enters the apartment and asks for two minutes' help guarding his illegally parked car as he carries down some doves that he is looking after for a magician friend. However, they refuse to help because he often underestimates how long things take to do.|$|E

[...] "Sherrill was so quick, {{most of the}} offensive linemen couldn’t get to him. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>such</b> a wild man, people didn’t realize <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>such</b> {{a student of the}} game.

500|$|Michael Binstein and Charles Bowden's 1993 book, Trust Me: Charles Keating and the Missing Billions, also {{presents}} Keating {{as a complex}} individual with contradictory tendencies, and concludes:Charlie Keating built things, and, at some level that haunts anyone who looks over his records, he thought his schemes would work. He did not simply rob a bank. He broke a bank with his dreams. If he is simply a thief, why did he put the money into deals and projects instead of into his own pocket? If he is just a hardworking businessman simply {{trying to make a}} profit and create jobs, why the need for jets, fancy meals, big paychecks to his family? If <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>such</b> a devout communicant of his faith, why did he peddle hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of junk bonds to old people when he knew his empire was in serious jeopardy? ...|$|E
500|$|In retrospect, Corgan rued the {{decision}} to hire the two percussionists to play alongside Aronoff, instead of having the drummer play along with loops from the album. [...] "That drove Kenny up the wall because Kenny has perfect time and one guy played on top and the other behind. I remember Kenny saying, 'I feel like I'm tripping on LSD' because he kept hearing things that were not in time, and it drove him crazy," [...] said Corgan in the Adore reissue liner notes. Performing with Garson was also challenging because, according to Corgan, [...] "he made a decision 40 years ago that he would live in the intuitive flow {{of what he was}} feeling, so he literally cannot play the same thing twice. So we'd have gigs where he'd have that same magic as on Aladdin Sane and the next night he'd come and play the extreme opposite style—like honkytonk. I really respect Mike, but to play with him was always challenging; precisely because <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>such</b> a supreme musician." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{features}} a fictional education film called Lava and You, which says lava will pass harmlessly over potential victims who duck and cover their heads. The film {{was inspired by}} actual [...] "Duck and Cover" [...] films from the 1950s and 1960s, in which children were instructed to hide under tables or lean against walls {{in the case of}} a nuclear weapon attack; Parker and Stone, like many critics of the films, found the methods painfully simplistic and did not believe they would actually help in the case of such an attack. Jimbo and Ned are described as veterans of the Vietnam War, the military conflict between North Vietnam and South Vietnam that lasted from 1959 to 1975; Cartman, who is far too young to have participated in the war, claims to have flashbacks to his experiences in it. Patrick Duffy, the American television actor best known for his roles in the shows Dallas and Step by Step, appears in the episode as the living leg of Scuzzlebutt. Matt Stone claimed there was no particular reason Duffy was chosen as the leg except that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>such</b> a nondescript actor: [...] "He's just super bland. Like, how could you possibly be a fan of Patrick Duffy?" ...|$|E

500|$|The soap opera's {{official}} website describes the character as the [...] "powerful millionaire-tycoon {{with a secret}} agenda to take everything from his long-lost mother Katherine Chancellor (Jeanne Cooper)." [...] Nichols describes Tucker as [...] "a self-made success, a regular guy who can tend bar and shoot pool and talk shit with anybody. He's very unassuming in many ways." [...] Nichols stated that he doesn't consider Tucker a villain, but considers him a [...] "player". Following the reveal that Katherine was Tucker's long lost mother, Nichols was asked if Tucker has abandonment issues, to which he stated: [...] "He has all that stuff, but he {{has found a way}} to create a very strong armor. He doesn’t let it break very often. He does not let anyone see his true feelings, and I think the reason <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>such</b> a player is, and it’s my take on it now, is that it’s for that very reason. He does not want to get close to anyone. He does not want to get hurt." [...] In a separate interview, the actor stated: [...] "Family and Katherine in particular means more to Tucker than he is willing to admit and his feelings for Katherine are sneaking up on him." [...] He also described the character as [...] "very, very cool, and [...] "full of a lot of fire and a lot of surprises".|$|E
500|$|Tom Shone, {{writing for}} The Sunday Times, praised the novel for its {{atypical}} qualities for Ellis, [...] "known for his orgies of violence". Shone asks [...] "Why {{is a new}} sequel to Less Than Zero... so moving?", noting the presence of [...] "feelings" [...] in the novel to be starkly different from Ellis' usual style. Touching on its personal qualities, Shone notes [...] "If Lunar Park unspooled the atrocities of American Psycho back to their source, Imperial Bedrooms pulls the thread further and reaches Less Than Zero". The emotive energy {{in the new book}} is traced back to the last pages of Lunar Park as well; fellow writer Jay McInerney observes that [...] "The last few pages of [...] are among the most moving passages I know in recent American fiction ... Bret was coming to terms with his relationship with his father in that book." [...] Vice observes that the [...] "final passages in both Imperial Bedrooms and Lunar Park pack a lot of emotional impact." [...] San Francisco Chronicle hails Imperial Bedrooms as [...] "the very definition of authorly meta: Ellis is either so deeply enmeshed in his own creepy little insular world that he can't write his way out of it, or else <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>such</b> a genius that he's created an entire parallel universe that folds and unfolds on itself like some kind of Escher print." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1903, Pelham Warner, {{who played}} for Middlesex, was chosen to captain the first tour of Australia to be {{sponsored}} by MCC, {{in the winter of}} 1903–04. According to Warner, Hirst and Rhodes were the first two players to be selected, as [...] "the two best bowlers of the present day in this country." [...] Before the tour, critics claimed Hirst would be unsuccessful, citing his failure during his previous tour. However, Warner later wrote: [...] "Hirst, to say nothing of his batting, bowled excellently throughout the tour, and was of much more value as a bowler than his average would suggest". He further described him as the best all-rounder in England and noted that [...] "the tighter the match, the better he plays". Wisden was less convinced, and the report on the tour said that, as a bowler, [...] "Hirst, though by no means the failure he had been with Mr Stoddart's team six years before, fell far below his English form." [...] While commenting on his batting record, the Wisden report noted: [...] "The Australian wickets [...] in fine weather are rather too fast to suit the pulling and hook strokes of which <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>such</b> a master in England." [...] As he could not make the ball swing in Australia in the same way it did in England, Hirst used leg theory, bowling at leg stump with fielders close by on the leg side.|$|E

Debogorski has 11 children and nine grandchildren, and is a year-round resident of Yellowknife. As stated in Season 1, since {{he has been a}} staple driving the ice roads, it is something of a good-luck charm for Debogorski to pull the first load over the ice roads at the beginning of every season. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>such</b> a devout Catholic that by season 9, when he joined long-time rival Hugh Rowland's company in Canada, Debogorski had [...] "The Preacher Man" [...] emblazoned {{on the side of his}} truck.

2500|$|Over the years, Rahul Dravid {{has been}} given {{a lot of credit for}} the way Rahane has matured as a player. With Dravid guiding him, Rahane has {{transformed}} from a shy, long-format specialist into a player capable of batting at any position, in any format. Former India captain Sunil Gavaskar told NDTV, [...] "What has been impressive about Rahane's career is the way he has made those little changes that have helped him to get better in every format of the game. This batsman is a thinking batsman, who keeps thinking about how to get better and that is why <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>such</b> a vital cog in the Rajasthan Royals team and a vital cog in the Indian cricket team." ...|$|E

2500|$|However, one of {{the most}} {{controversial}} moments of Pippen's career came in his first year without Jordan. In the 1994 NBA Playoffs, the Eastern Conference Semifinals pitted the Bulls against the New York Knicks, whom the Bulls had dispatched en route to a championship each of the previous three seasons. On May 13, 1994, down 2–0 in the series in Game 3, Bulls coach Phil Jackson needed a big play from his team to have any chance of going on to the conference finals. With 1.8 seconds left and the score tied at 102, Jackson designed the last play for rookie Toni Kukoč, with Pippen instructed to inbound the basketball. Pippen, who had been the Bulls' leader all season long in Jordan's absence, was so angered by Jackson's decision to not let him take the potential game-winner that he refused to leave the bench and re-enter the game when the timeout was over. Although Kukoč did hit the game-winner, a 23-foot fadeaway jumper at the buzzer, there was little celebrating by the Bulls, as television cameras caught an unsmiling Phil Jackson storming off the court. [...] "Scottie asked out of the play," [...] Jackson told reporters moments later in the post-game interview. Teammate Steve Kerr elaborated when asked to recall the event: [...] "I don't know what got into Pippen. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>such</b> a great teammate and maybe the pressure was getting to him and he just could not take it anymore, no one knows for sure but he is a team player." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dennis Mitchell — an importuning but lovable, freckle-faced five-and-a-half-year-old {{boy with}} a famous blond cowlick and a penchant for mischief. His long-suffering parents can only shake their heads and try to explain their son's antics to others. Despite this, they really do love him very much. Dennis's wide-eyed curiosity, his well-meaning {{attempts}} to help, his innocent, matter-of-fact bluntness, his youthful energy and enthusiastic nature always seem to lead to trouble wherever he goes (most often at Mr. Wilson's expense). He wears a blue/black striped shirt, tennis shoes, and red overalls with pockets that are sometimes filled with snakes, frogs, or his slingshot. He hates carrots and baths, loves root beer (especially with cookies), ketchup, water pistols, his teddy bear [...] "Teddy", getting into fights with other boys his age, mud puddles, and TV Westerns (especially those starring Cowboy Bob), and has occasionally been depicted wearing a cowboy costume. Dennis has a poster and an autographed picture of Cowboy Bob as well. In fact, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>such</b> a fan that once a week {{he goes to the}} local theater to watch a Cowboy Bob western. A favorite TV show of Dennis's is [...] "Uncle Earl." [...] Among the running gags: Dennis has a soft spot for kittens and puppies, which he is always taking home to feed; Dennis loves loud instruments—such as horns and drums; Dennis ruins Christmas songs with shouts of cowboy songs or annoys adults by shouting out loud. Whenever Dennis is in the local department store trying out toys, such as tricycles, he ends up breaking them and his parents have to buy them. In fact Dennis nearly causes kindergarten teachers, Librarians [...] department store Christmas Santas, department store saleswomen, Drugstore salesmen, Hardware store salesmen, shoe salesmen, barbers, and the local post office workers to have nervous breakdowns when he comes around. Dennis also believes in the Easter Bunny and Santa Claus; another running gag is Dennis on Christmas Eve dreaming that he meets Santa Claus, and causing chaos for everyone else.|$|E
2500|$|The {{scene is}} laid in Teos at the poet Anacreon's house, where a feast is being held: the {{landlord}} (basse-taille), his guests, Agathocle (haute-contre) and Euricles (haute-contre), {{and the rest}} of his suite are celebrating Bacchus, the local patron god. Anacreon addresses to his beautiful slave girl, Lycoris (ballerina), a warm request that she cheer up the party with the bloom of her youth and that she be the priestess of all gods he adores, including Cupid as well as Bacchus (aria: [...] "Nouvelle Hébé, charmante Lycoris"). As she is dancing and Anacreon singing, however, an inflamed symphony is suddenly heard and the priestess of Bacchus bursts into the scene, followed by the Maenads, objecting to the festivities on account of their profane character and of their mingling together the cults of their god and of Cupid. A ballet follows thereupon representing the confrontation between Anacreon’s suite and Bacchus’ followers, but eventually Anacreon and his guests yield to the priestess’ demands and agree to worship Bacchus alone. As the Bacchantes go off the stage and Lycoris, as a symbol of love, is driven away, a ravishing sweet music slowly sends the whole drunken party to sleep. In his dreams Anacreon is visited by Cupid (soprano en travesti) and informed that Lycoris is dying of grief because she has been deserted for Bacchus by the insensitive man she is in love with. As he realises <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>such</b> a man, Anacreon throws himself at Cupid’s feet imploring the god to return Lycoris to him, for he is willing to forgo everything else for her. Lycoris re-enters the stage accompanied by the Graces, but, as Anacreon is singing Cupid’s praises, a prelude foretells the return of Bacchus’ followers: they cannot however shrink from bowing down before the present god of love and paying homage to his statue, while Cupid’s retinue pay homage to Bacchus’ as well, and the two dancing parties mingle together under the guidance of Lycoris. The entrée ends in a chorus and in a contredanse accompanied by sistrums and [...] "other Bacchic instruments".|$|E
