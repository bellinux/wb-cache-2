5|$|In 2010, a {{team from}} New York {{described}} detection of PrPSc even when initially present at only one part in a hundred billion (10−11) in brain tissue. The method combines amplification with a novel technology called Surround Optical Fiber Immunoassay (SOFIA) and some specific antibodies against PrPSc. After amplifying and then concentrating any PrPSc, the samples are labelled with a fluorescent dye using an antibody for specificity and then finally loaded into a micro-capillary tube. This tube is placed in a specially constructed apparatus so that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>totally</b> surrounded by optical fibres to capture all light emitted once the dye is excited using a laser.|$|E
25|$|The {{isothermal}} efficiency (Z) is {{a measure}} of where the process lies between an adiabatic and isothermal process. If the efficiency is 0%, then <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>totally</b> adiabatic; with an efficiency of 100%, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>totally</b> isothermal. Typically with a near isothermal process an efficiency of 90-95% can be expected.|$|E

25|$|Desmopressin is {{contraindicated}} in vWD type 2b {{because of}} the risk of aggravated thrombocytopenia and thrombotic complications. Desmopressin is probably not effective in vWD type 2M and is rarely effective in vWD type 2N. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>totally</b> ineffective in vWD type 3.|$|E
25|$|One common way {{of proving}} that a {{polyhedron}} is integral {{is to show}} that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>totally</b> unimodular. There are other general methods including the integer decomposition property and total dual integrality. Other specific well-known integral LPs include the matching polytope, lattice polyhedra, submodular flow polyhedra, and the intersection of 2 generalized polymatroids/g-polymatroids --- e.g. see Schrijver 2003.|$|E

25|$|The unique {{advantage}} of ironless DC motors {{is that there}} is no cogging (torque variations caused by changing attraction between the iron and the magnets). Parasitic eddy currents cannot form in the rotor as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>totally</b> ironless, although iron rotors are laminated. This can greatly improve efficiency, but variable-speed controllers must use a higher switching rate (>40kHz) or DC because of the decreased electromagnetic induction.|$|E
25|$|A {{population}} bottleneck {{occurs when}} the population of a species is reduced drastically over {{a short period of}} time due to external forces. In a true population bottleneck, the reduction does not favor any combination of alleles; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>totally</b> random chance which individuals survive. A bottleneck can reduce or eliminate genetic variation from a population. Further drift events after the bottleneck event can also reduce the population's genetic diversity. The lack of diversity created can make the population at risk to other selective pressures.|$|E
25|$|Paintball {{has been}} {{considered}} an inappropriate game, that promotes violence, by the Parliament of the Province of Buenos Aires. The approved law 14.492 (December 2012) regulates its use: <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>totally</b> forbidden for children under 16 years old, but can be played with written authorization by the parents, or responsible person in charge, of youths between 16 and 18 years old. Originally, the initiative had proposed the total prohibition for players under 21 years old. The penalties are also established by law, as 30 days of communitarian work or other modalities.|$|E

25|$|Baley {{furthermore}} {{proposes that}} the Solarians {{may one day}} use robots for military purposes. If a spacecraft was built with a positronic brain and carried neither humans nor the life-support systems to sustain them, then the ship's robotic intelligence could naturally assume that all other spacecraft were robotic beings. Such a ship could operate more responsively and flexibly than one crewed by humans, could be armed more heavily and its robotic brain equipped to slaughter humans of whose existence <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>totally</b> ignorant. This possibility is referenced in Foundation and Earth where it is discovered that the Solarians possess a strong police force of unspecified size that has been programmed to identify only the Solarian race as human.|$|E
25|$|Many {{high-pressure}} compressors {{used for}} breathing gases {{are suitable for}} compressing breathing gas mixtures containing moderate fractions of oxygen and helium, but the manufacturer should be consulted regarding limits on both gases. Compression of mixtures with a high fraction of oxygen are an increased fire hazard, and the compressor lubricant must be compatible to minimise this risk. Helium poses a very different problem, as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>totally</b> inert, and creates no fire hazard directly, but its temperature rises more than oxygen and nitrogen when compressed, which can cause a compressor designed for air to overheat. This can eventually lead to problems with the compressor lubricant and bearings, and if the oxygen fraction is also high, this will increase the fire hazard. Fortunately most Trimix blends have an oxygen fraction inversely related to the helium fraction, which reduces the probability of this problem.|$|E

500|$|Since the band's 1960s heyday, the {{influence}} of the Monks has grown steadily, beginning with krautrock then followed by successive generations of musicians in disparate genres such as punk rock, experimental, alternative and hip-hop, with acts such as the Dead Kennedys, the Beastie Boys, the White Stripes, and the Fall exhibiting signs of their influence. Music historian Kelley Stoltz described the Monks in 1996 as a group that [...] "overwhelms the listener with a sound they termed 'over-beat' - at their worst <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>totally</b> oddball freakrock that sounds like a pleasurable argument". Stoltz concluded the band was an innovative musical act which [...] "outsexed the [...] Pistols" [...] ten years before any other punk band emerged. In his book, The Rough Guide to Rock, writer Peter Buckley had said Black Monk Time has not [...] "aged one iota. If anything, it has gotten stranger".|$|E
