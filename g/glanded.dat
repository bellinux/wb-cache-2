40|$|A {{new member}} of the (+) -ä-cadinene synthase (CAD 1) family was {{isolated}} from a Gossypium arboreum cDNA library. This cDNA encodes a protein that showed 97. 3 %, 96. 9 %, and 79. 2 % sequence identities with the proteins encoded by previously isolated cDNAs of cad 1 -C 1, cad 1 -C 14, and cad 1 -A, respectively. It may be grouped into the cad 1 -C subfamily as cad 1 -C 2. Seeds of a <b>glanded</b> cotton cultivar, G. hirsutum cv.

The transcripts could be detected in seeds of 27 DPA (days postanthesis) and increased dramatically along with the seed maturation, which coordinated {{with an increase in}} sesquiterpene cyclase activities and subsequently the accumulation of gossypol.

40|$|International audienceRecently {{the world}} has been {{entangled}} by insufficient food such as the lack of rice which threatens the safety of world food and affect sustainable development of the world economy, resulting in rising of food price. To address this issue, cotton appears as a possible source of both fiber and food. The research in recent years indeed showed bright prospects for this expectation. However, gossypol stored in the glands of cotton is toxic to nonruminant animals and humans, which wastes large amounts of cottonseed protein that could potentially provide the annual protein requirements for half a billion people. Gossypium species are characterized by their lysigenous glands containing terpenoid aldehydes, important secondary phytoalexins consisting mainly of gossypol, which constitute one of the important plant's defense system against pests and diseases. The best approach to address this issue is to create glandless seed and <b>glanded</b> plant cotton. A breakthrough in this field would realise the fulfilment of making cotton both a fiber and a food crop, which would be a feat of great magnitude for sustainable development of agriculture. Research on the relationship between glands and their secondary inclusions at the molecular level would be one approach for genetic engineering to control the glands and gossypol content. In this article, we review recent progress on glands and gossypol content for diverse gland types in Gossypium species, inheritance of glands and gossypol content, traditional breeding of glandless seeds and <b>glanded</b> plant cotton, the terpenoid aldehyde biosynthesis pathway, molecular cloning of the related genes, the strategy for genetic engineering, and future prospects...|$|E

40|$|We {{developed}} novel microsatellite markers for D alechampia scandens L. (Euphorbiaceae). The target plants {{belong to}} a distinct, but undescribed, species in the D. scandens species complex, characterized by small resin-producing glands. In total, 110 alleles over 36 novel markers were identified across 39 individuals from three populations. The number of alleles varied from one to seven, {{with an average of}} 3. 06 ± 0. 26 alleles per locus. The developed markers, along with previously developed ones for a large-glanded D. scandens species, were tested for amplification in 11 additional species of the genus D alechampia. Four markers did not produce any detectable allele in 37 individuals from two populations of the large-glanded species. Average expected heterozygosity across all small- and large-glanded specific loci was 0. 36 and 0. 15, for the small and large <b>glanded</b> populations, respectively. Cross-species amplification showed that 89 % of all markers were successfully amplified in {{at least one of the}} 11 other D alechampia species. These microsatellite markers may be useful for detecting undescribed species in the D. scandens species complex, and can be used for comparative analyses of genetic structure, mating system and phylogeography of other D alechampia species.

40|$|Two différent trispecific hybrids were {{developed}} in order to introgress the "glandless seed-glanded plant" trait of Gossypium sturtianum Will. (2 n = 2 x = 26, CI genome) into the main cultivated cotton species (Gossypium hirsutum L., 2 n = 4 x = 52, (AD), genome) using either Gossypium raimondii Ulb. (2 n = 2 x = 26, D 5 genome) or Gossypium thurberi Tor. (2 n = 2 x = 26, Dl genome) as bridge species. Both trispecific hybrids were backcrossed with two G. hirsutum varieties (C 2 and NC 8) originating from Zaire. Observation of the trispecific seeds pointed out the incomplets expression of the seed gossypol glands répressive mechanism of G. sturtianum when its chromosomes set is confronted with the D genome. The glandless trait was expressed in a rather high proportion of the BC, seeds: 6 out of 41. Only {{one of the six}} BC, glandless seeds gave riss to a viable <b>glanded</b> plant. Cytogenetic observations of both trispecific hybrids and of the introgressed plant confirmed the soundness of the introgression strategy followed. All these plants were euploid (2 n = 4 x = 52) and showed high frequencies of multivalent and chiasma formations at métaphase I indicating important genetic material exchanges.

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Gossypol, found in pigment glands, serves as a resistance mechanism against insects in the foliage of cotton, however, is toxic to non-runiinant animals when found in the seed. The ideal genotype would have <b>glanded</b> foliage and glandless seed (GPGS). This trait has been observed in C and G genome diploids. Three hexaploids, developed from crosses of C and G genome diploids with upland-type cottons (G. hirsutum L.), were used for this study: two C genome hexaploids, G. australe x Hancock and G. sturtianum x Acala 44; and one G genome hexaploid, G. bickii x Acala G 8160. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate these hexaploids and their diploid and tetraploid parents for glanding pattern and gossypol content in the seed, foliage, and flower buds. Glanding pattern was determined by counting the glands in cross-sectioned seeds, in the veinal and interveinal regions of the leaves and within the calyx crown of third-grown flower buds, while gossypol content was determined by high performance liquid chromatography (BPLC). Flower bud gossypol was not determined. The C genome hexaploids were intermediate to the parents for seed glanding pattern and gossypol content, both having fewer glands and less gossypol than the tetraploid parent. The G genome hexaploid, derived from glandless parents, had glands as well as gossypol in the seed. The C genome hexaploids were mostly intermediate to the parents for leaf glanding, having fewer glands than the tetraploid parent, with one being more similar to the diploid parent. The G genome hexaploid was intermediate to the parents for glands in the interveinal regions but had more glands than both parents at the veinal regions. All of the hexaploids were mostly intermediate to the parents for terpenoid content. Compared to their respective tetraploid parent, the C genome hexaploids had smaller terpenoid concentrations, whereas the G genome hexaploid had higher concentrations. The C genome hexaploids had significantly more flower bud glands than their tetraploid parent, while conversely, the G genome hexaploid had very few glands. These findings suggest different mechanisms for glanding in the seed, foliage, and flower buds between the C and G genomes...|$|E
