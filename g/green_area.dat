In this study, we aimed to determine two indicators of public <b>green</b> <b>areas</b> relative to the percentage of public <b>green</b> <b>areas</b> (PPGA) and the public <b>green</b> <b>areas</b> index (PGAI) in the urban area of São Carlos, SP. The study area was organized into administrative regions (ARs), using satellite images, topographical maps of 1 : 10, 000 Geographic and Cartographic Institute (1990) and data provided by the Municipality of São Carlos. The results show that public <b>green</b> <b>areas</b> comprise 6. 55 % of the municipality, with a public <b>green</b> <b>areas</b> index (PGAI) of 18. 85 m 2 /inhabitant, indicating good urban environmental quality when compared to rates of 15 m 2 /capita for public <b>green</b> <b>areas</b> for recreation, suggested by the Brazilian Society of Urban Forestry. The differences between the administrative regions are concern with situations from 4. 16 to 36. 30 m 2 /inhabitant. In this context, it is recommend specific public policies and popular participation {{in the process of}} continuous improvement for increasing public <b>green</b> <b>areas</b> in the less favored regions. The Genebrino method applied to indicators of public <b>green</b> <b>areas</b> (GPGA – amount of public <b>green</b> <b>areas</b> divided by population density), showed a commendable goal above 40 % for urban environmental quality...|$|R

40|$|The ambivalence {{of attitudes}} toward urban <b>green</b> <b>areas</b> is {{investigated}} through a cross-sectional survey {{carried out in the}} city of Rome (N = 500). First, the dimensional structure, and then the personal tendency to hold ambivalent attitudes were analyzed in relation to: (a) broader human values and environmental worldviews (such as biospheric value orientations, ecocentrism vs. anthropocentrism) and (b) specific daily residential experience about urban <b>green</b> <b>areas</b> (perceived quality of neighborhood <b>green</b> <b>areas</b> and self-reported frequency of use of <b>green</b> <b>areas).</b> Results show two separate dimensions (moderately correlated) for attitudes toward urban <b>green</b> <b>areas.</b> The two dimensions are interpreted as measuring appreciation and devaluation of the presence of nature in the city, respectively. They showed different patterns of correlations with the other social-psychological factors considered. Moreover, people with more anthropocentric and apathic worldviews and with egoistic values manifested higher degrees of ambivalence in attitudes toward urban <b>green</b> <b>areas,</b> whereas a less straightforward relationship was found with daily residential experience. The implications of these results for the understanding of people’s relationship with urban <b>green</b> <b>areas</b> are discussed...|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the association between parks and <b>green</b> <b>areas</b> and hyperlipidemia in adults with groups stratified by moderate physical activity as a behavioral modification using the 2009 Korean Community Health Survey data and 212, 584 participants enrolled in this study. The geographical codes of study participants were all matched {{on the basis of}} the amount of parks and <b>green</b> <b>areas</b> in each administrative district. Compared with participants living in the highest quartile of parks and <b>green</b> <b>areas</b> (Quartile 4), those living in the lowest quartile of <b>green</b> and park <b>area</b> (Quartile 1) were at an increased risk of physician-diagnosed hyperlipidemia and hyperlipidemia currently under treatment. Participants in the lowest quartile of parks and <b>green</b> <b>areas</b> were likely not to engage in any moderate physical activity. After classifying hyperlipidemia risk depending on the presence of moderate physical activity, those participating in moderate physical activity were less likely to have hyperlipidemia in all quartiles of parks and <b>green</b> <b>areas</b> than those not engaging in moderate physical activity.

5|$|The {{building}} of the railways in the early 1840s introduced new employment opportunities for people {{in places such as}} Stockport and Manchester, as well as an influx of people coming to live in the area. In the mid-19th century, one of the earliest shops was opened in the Smithy <b>Green</b> <b>area,</b> selling groceries, sweets and other provisions. As people settled in the area, more shops were opened and new houses were built, many of which still stand. During the early 20th century Cheadle Hulme experienced a rapid growth in population, mostly due to an influx of people from Manchester and other large towns and cities coming to live in the area, and it gradually became more suburban. In the 1930s more houses were built around the Grove Lane and Pingate Lane, Gill Bent Road, Hulme Hall Road and Cheadle Road areas, and new roads replaced old farms. In the 1960s the Hursthead estate was built on land that was once Hursthead Farm. By 2009 the only farm remaining was Leather's Farm on Ladybridge Road.|$|E

40|$|Thesis {{deals with}} a proposal for {{sustainable}} development of urban <b>green</b> <b>areas</b> in Litoměřice. Aim is to provide suitable conditions to guarantee a long term aesthetis value of cultivated trees and the trees stability in the individual town zones so they are not potentionally dangerous to properties or personal health. Urban <b>green</b> <b>areas</b> are an inseparable part of modern towns and cities. They create favourable living conditions. These areas has positive impact on microclimate in towns; influence psychological and mental state of inhabitans. Therefore, we should {{take care of those}} areas and make an effort to keep them functional and in high-quality conditions. Unfortunately, <b>green</b> <b>areas</b> in towns are exposed to a number of negative factors that have an immense impact on their value as well as lifespan. Among the greatest problems belong salinization of soil along motorways, dogs urine, transport, building operations, warm microclimate, soil and air pollution. In order to perserve quality of cultivated trees, towns need to systematically manage and look after <b>green</b> <b>areas.</b> Thus, a concept for maintenance of <b>green</b> <b>areas</b> has been developed, in which the <b>green</b> <b>areas</b> in Litoměřice were divided into eight zones. This concept includes recommendation of suitable selection of trees and their length of life cycle. Concept also presents development of individual zones depending on their character and utilization. Public <b>green</b> <b>areas</b> are proposed to become a part of maitenance system. Project offers a possible way of better care for <b>green</b> <b>areas</b> and maitain their appropriate conditions. Proposal brings changes into concept of urban <b>green</b> <b>areas</b> maintenance, which needs also the inhabitans understanding and change of their attitude. Overall change can improve environment in towns and provide them with sustainable system of the quality urban <b>green</b> <b>areas...</b>|$|R

In this work was used the <b>Green</b> <b>Areas</b> Index (GAI), that although has job limitations, allowed to identify the variations of <b>green</b> <b>areas</b> distribution in Belém central region. GAI is the total <b>area</b> of leaves, <b>green</b> fruits and green stems per unit of ground area covered by a plant; is a useful tool in canopy management.

Despite the fact that <b>green</b> <b>areas</b> show almost GAI = 17, they seem to have a strong influence on enviromental quality and local climate. The methodology applied show that further calibration and refinement of near-ground remote sensing techniques for vegetation might establish methods more efficient to identify these areas. According to the results, the need for more urban <b>green</b> <b>areas</b> became obvious. The state should encourage the extension of bioclimatic designed parks. Finally those parks should be established in close proximity to each other so as to strongly mitigate the thermal pollution. Pages: 683 - 68...|$|R
