40|$|Thermolysis of {{complexes}} Cp* 2 LnCH(SiMe 3) 2 (1, Ln = Y; 2, Ln = La; 3, Ln = Ce) in cyclohexane {{leads to}} extrusion of CH 2 (SiMe 3) 2 by hydrogen abstraction from a Cp* ligand and postulated {{formation of a}} pentamethylcyclopentadienyl fulvene species Cp*FvLn. For yttrium thermolysis occurs under conditions where Cp*FvY reacts further, e. g. with solvent and CH 2 (SiMe 3) 2, to produce a complicated mixture. In cyclohexane-d 12 extensive H/D scrambling between organometallic species and solvent is observed. For lanthanum and cerium secondary reactions take place between molecules of Cp*FvLn, but solvent and CH 2 (SiMe 3) 2 are not involved. The stable end product for these metals is a tetranuclear complex [Cp* 3 (mu- 3 -eta- 5,eta- 1,eta- 1 -C 5 Me 3 (CH 2) 2) Ln 2] 2 (4, Ln = La; 5, Ln = Ce), formed by intermolecular hydrogen transfer. For 5 the molecular structure was determined by X-ray diffraction. The compound crystallizes in the monoclinic space group C 2 /c (No. 15) with a = 23. 849 (9) angstrom, b = 10. 846 (4) angstrom, c = 30. 11 (1) angstrom, and beta = 104. 29 (3) -degrees. The unit cell contains four molecules of 5 and two cyclohexane-d 12 solvate molecules (Z = 4). Compound 5 contains a novel type of bridging ligand, a doubly metalated pentamethylcyclopentadienyl group, eta- 5,eta- 1,eta- 1 -C 5 (CH 2) 2 Me 3, bridging three cerium atoms in a unique manner. The tetranuclear complex is essentially a tightly <b>fitting</b> <b>assembly</b> of four units Cp* 2 LnR. Thermolysis of 2 and 3 or heating of tetranuclear compounds 4 and 5 in toluene leads {{to the formation of}} the benzyl compounds Cp* 2 LnCH 2 Ph (6, Ln = La; 7, Ln = Ce). Thermolysis of 3 in toluene-d 8 shows that the alkane CH 2 (SiMe 3) 2 has no deuterium built-in, indicating that 6 and 7 are formed through hydrogen abstraction from a pentamethylcyclopentadienyl ligand and that the solvent is not involved here. Compound 7 crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group Pna 2 (1) with a = 16. 730 (4) angstrom, b = 11. 387 (3) angstrom, c = 12. 506 (3) angstrom, and Z = 4. The bonding of the benzyl group is best described as a benzyl anion with regular Sp 2 hybridization of the methylene group eta- 3 -bonded to a Cp* 2 Ce+ cation. The metal has a strong interaction with the methylene, the ipso, and an ortho carbon atom of the benzyl ligand...|$|E

40|$|This review {{addresses}} thickening of {{the bony}} pyramid of the nose, {{a condition that}} is caused by in-flight oxygen masks in otherwise healthy Royal Netherlands Air Force (RNLAF) F- 16 pilots. The overlying skin may show temporary or permanent reddening, irritation, thickening and may become painful. Both in vitro and in vivo animal {{research has shown that}} mechanical stimuli are converted into a biochemical response through a process called mechanotransduction. Examination of the RNLAF F- 16 pilots showed that the oxygen mask exerts pressure and friction on the nose. The biochemical response to chronic exposure to these stimuli results in the development of skin conditions and eventually exostoses of the bony pyramid of the nose. Painful skin conditions are most frequently observed, while the development of exostoses is rare. It lies at the extreme end of the spectrum of the pilotsâ€™ nasal conditions. The suboptimal fit of their work gear probably contributes to the pilotsâ€™ soft and bony tissue nasal conditions. Explaining the pathogenesis of the development of exostoses may aid in the development of preventive measures. Also, the obtained knowledge may be of use in similar occupational health issues that involve mechanical loading. Our conclusions are that areas containing osteocyte precursors and covered by a relatively thin cushioning layer are prone to develop a soft tissue and bony tissue response when they are chronically exposed to intermittently exerted, mechanical stimuli of sufficiently high magnitude. Modification of the suboptimally <b>fitting</b> oxygen maskâ€“helmet <b>assembly</b> is needed to prevent symptoms associated with its use...|$|R
40|$|Assembly process {{engineering}} {{is one of}} the biggest challenges in modern preproduction engineering. The quality of the process largely depends on the sequence of machine or device assembly. With increasing number of parts in the engineering system the number of allowable assembly sequences is rapidly increasing. It is impossible to analyse this copious combinatorial space without using the cutting-edge methods of mathematical modelling. The paper offers the algebraic models that can be used to select the rational design solutions at the preproduction engineering stage of the assembly operation. When assembling any engineering system the coherence and sequence conditions should be met. It is shown that an adequate mathematical description of sequential and coherent assembly operation is shrinkage of edges of the hyper-graph, which describes a mechanical structure of the product. For the product and its parts must be provided a property of the independent assembly. It is shown that this property can be represented as an action of the closure operator on a set of the product parts. The representations of this operator are parts to be assembled independently (the s-sets). Arranged by inclusion, an aggregate of all the sets is a lattice. The lattice is an algebraic structure where are specified two stable operations, namely: lattice intersection and lattice jog. It turned out that it is possible to use this structure, as a universal generating medium to a diversity of design options for the assembly conversion. The lattice terms are used to describe the sequences of product assembly and disassembly, the sequences of assembly and disassembly of the assembly units, the multi-level diagrams of the assembly decomposition, etc. The properties of the independent assembly are required not only to provide the assembly. A lot of design and technology operations can be performed, provided that a set of the parts has a stable and coordinated configuration within the product, i. e. an s-set of the lattice. For example, those are adjustment operation, various types of tests, <b>fitting</b> and trial <b>assembly,</b> etc. One of the most important operations when designing the engineering system is the synthesis of a rational system of design dimension chains. It is shown that the lattice operations can be used to find the minimum length design chains. The lattice structure allows us to state and solve a problem of minimizing the number of tests for geometric solvability (geometric access) while assembling the products of complicated Science & Education of the Bauman MSTU 231 configuration. It is shown that the set of all solvable configurations is the sub-lattice within the lattice of all the assembled configurations. This allows us to solve the problem of minimizing the number of geometrical tests through the algebraic lattice restoration methods...|$|R
40|$|To model {{shrink-fitting}} {{in metal}} components, an analytical model for two long compound cylinders with temperature dependent material properties and interference {{between them is}} developed for calculating transient temperatures and stresses. A finite element model is developed for the same geometry which incorporated the temperature dependent material properties. A convergence study is performed on the finite element and analytical model. The finite element model is validated by comparing the approximations of finite element model with the analytical solution. In an assembly procedure of fulcrums for bascule bridges, called AP 1, the trunnion is shrink-fitted into a hub, followed by shrink <b>fitting</b> the trunnion-hub <b>assembly</b> into the girder of the bridge. In another assembly procedure called AP 2, the hub is shrink-fitted into the girder, followed by shrink-fitting the trunnion in the hub-girder assembly. A formal design of experiments (DOE) study is conducted on both AP 1 and AP 2 using the finite element model to find the influence of geometrical parameters such as radial thickness of the hub, radial interference, and various shrink-fitting methods on the design parameter of overall minimum critical crack length (OMCCL) - a measure of likelihood of failure by cracking. Using the results of DOE study conducted on both the assembly procedures, AP 1 and AP 2 are quantitatively compared for the likelihood of fracture during assembly. For single-staged shrink-fitting methods, for high and low hub radial thickness to hub inner diameter ratio, assembly procedure AP 1 and AP 2 are recommended, respectively. For fulcra with low hub radial thickness to hub inner diameter ratio and where staged shrink-fitting methods are used, for AP 2, cooling the trunnion in dry-ice/alcohol and heating the girder, and for AP 1, cooling the trunnion-hub assembly in dry-ice/alcohol followed by immersion in liquid nitrogen is recommended. For fulcra with high hub radial thickness to hub inner diameter ratio and where staged shrink-fitting methods are used, cooling the components in dry-ice/alcohol and heating the girder is recommended for both AP 1 and AP 2. Due to the limitations of AP 2, assembly procedures by heating the girder with heating coils instead of dipping an already stressed trunnion-hub assembly in liquid nitrogen are studied for decreasing the likelihood of failure by cracking and yielding. In an assembly procedure called AP 3 -A, only the girder is heated to shrink-fit the trunnion-hub assembly in the girder. This assembly procedure AP 3 -A {{is found to be}} infeasible because the girder fails by yielding if heating is expected to be completed in a reasonable amount of time. An alternative assembly procedure called AP 3 -B is suggested for shrink-fitting where the heating of the girder is combined with cooling the trunnion-hub assembly in dry-ice/alcohol mixture. This assembly procedure AP 3 -B is found to be feasible. A complete DOE study is conducted on AP 3 -B to find the influence of parameters like hub radial thickness and radial interference at trunnion-hub interface on the design parameter of overall minimum critical crack length. The design parameter, OMCCL values during the assembly procedure AP 3 -B are quantitatively compared with the widely used assembly procedures (AP 1 single-stage shrink-fitting and AP 1 multi-staged shrink fitting). The results of this work suggest that increasing the hub radial thickness decreases the likelihood of fracture significantly. For hubs with large radial thickness, heating the girder combined with cooling the trunnion-hub in dry-ice/alcohol mixture (AP 3 -B) is recommended but for hubs with low radial thickness, multistage cooling of the trunnion-hub assembly in dry-ice/alcohol mixture followed by dipping in liquid nitrogen (AP 1 - multistage cooling) is recommended...|$|R
