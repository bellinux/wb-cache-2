[...] Ray stated [...] "It took a long while to get Jim out here, but finally we managed it." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Mutt Romney Blues" [...] is a three-chord, {{acoustic}} Delta blues song. Drawing {{parallels between}} the Mitt Romney dog incident and his political [...] "plans and schemes", the song criticizes Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney and is sung {{from the perspective of}} the Romney family's dog. Cooder was inspired by Al Sharpton's quote [...] "how he treated his dog tells you a lot about him", and found the dog to be [...] "a useful character... when you view it in the light of the blues. Like a servant, a yardman, someone very low in the social order. He's just begging to be let down [...]" [...] Bud Scoppa of Uncut characterizes the song as [...] "the musical equivalent of a political cartoon". [...] "Brother Is Gone" [...] is poignantly styled as a sad folktale and features a haunting mandolin riff, a rueful tone, and wounded vocals. Its lyrics attribute the conservative Koch Brothers to the Deal with the Devil myth, which Cooder adapted from Robert Johnson's [...] "Cross Road Blues". The lyrics cite their [...] "crossroads" [...] as [...] "the prairie town of Wichita", where Koch Industries is headquartered. He said in an interview that [...] "the only logical explanation for the Brothers <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>come</b> up with is, they made their deal at the crossroads with Satan." [...] AllMusic's Thom Jurek cites it as [...] "among the finest songs 's written." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2013, she lent {{her voice}} to the {{character}} of Ishani, the reigning Pan-Asian champion from India and the love interest of the main protagonist in the Disney Animation Studios's film Planes, a spinoff of Pixar's Cars franchise. Chopra, a fan of Disney films, had fun voicing the character saying [...] "The closest <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>come</b> to being a Disney princess, I think, was Ishani". The film was a commercial success, grossing approximately US$240 million worldwide. She played an NRI girl in the Apoorva Lakhia's bilingual action drama Zanjeer (Thoofan in Telugu), a remake of the 1973 Hindi film of the same name, which met with poor reactions from critics and was unsuccessful at the box office. Chopra next reprised her role of Priya in Rakesh Roshan's Krrish 3a sequel to the 2006 superhero film Krrishwith Hrithik Roshan, Vivek Oberoi and Kangana Ranaut. The film earned positive reviews though critics opined that Chopra's role in the film was small. Writing for Daily News and Analysis, Sarita A Tanwar commented that [...] "Priyanka is saddled with a role that doesn't do her justice. She deserved a meatier role." [...] The feature became a box office success, earning over [...] worldwide, to become Chopra's biggest commercial success till date and her fourth major hit in the last two years. She also appeared in an item number titled [...] "Ram Chahe Leela" [...] for Sanjay Leela Bhansali's Goliyon Ki Rasleela Ram-Leela. The song, which took four days to rehearse, saw Chopra execute a contemporary mujra, that incorporated complicated dance steps.|$|E

2500|$|Blue Horse came to Burbank's studio one hot day, fanning {{himself with}} a big turkey wing. [...] "He sat down on my bed and, not noticing, put his hat down {{on a sheet of}} sticky flypaper I had placed there. To pull it loose, he grabbed {{the other end of the}} flypaper with his other hand, and soon he was tangled up gloriously. Before <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>come</b> to his rescue, he had managed to stick the flypaper on his little dog’s back. In no time at all, the pup had dashed around the room, {{attaching}} himself to first one object, then another. The situation was funny to everybody but Blue Horse. 'Bad Medicine,' he said in disgust.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Soon after, he {{had moved}} in with the family of his close friend, Ronnie Burns, who became a pop star: first {{as a member of}} The Flies (1964–65) and then as a solo artist. Meldrum had {{followed}} Burns to the latter's home and asked, [...] "Is there any chance <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>come</b> and live with you and your family?" [...] What had started as a two-week stay with the Burns family became nine years. During The Beatles' tour of Australia in June 1964, Meldrum was captured by TV cameras climbing atop the bonnet of their car shortly after arrival at Melbourne airport. Later, he and Burns were ejected from The Beatles' Melbourne concert for being [...] "too enthusiastic".|$|E
2500|$|Patriots {{head coach}} Raymond Berry then {{replaced}} Eason with Steve Grogan, {{who had spent}} the previous week hoping {{he would have the}} opportunity to step onto the NFL's biggest stage. [...] "I probably won't get a chance", he had told reporters {{a few days before the}} game. [...] "I just hope I can figure out some way to get on the field. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>come</b> in on the punt-block team and stand behind the line and wave my arms, or something." [...] But on his first drive, Grogan could only lead them to the 37-yard line, and they decided to punt rather than risk a 55-yard field goal attempt. The Bears then marched 72 yards in 11 plays, moving the ball inside the Patriots' 10-yard line. New England kept them out of the end zone, but Butler kicked his third field goal on the last play of the half to give Chicago a 23–3 halftime lead.|$|E
6000|$|... "My name is Brown," [...] {{said the}} priest sadly, as {{he bent over}} {{something}} and straightened himself again. [...] "Miss Rome sent for me, and I came as quickly as <b>I</b> <b>could.</b> <b>I</b> have <b>come</b> too late." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ready for {{the first}} who daurs to lay hands on the Master! Gin <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have <b>come</b> up in time, the loon had never risen from the ground.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes;--I had heard," [...] And then {{he smiled}} again. [...] "You will have {{understood}} why <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>come</b> to you,--as I should have done but for this little accident." ...|$|R
2500|$|From London, Wild had {{obtained}} an assistant research officer {{job with the}} Council for Scientific and Industrial Research at the Radiophysics Laboratory near Sydney. He described the position as [...] "a humble one": to maintain and develop test equipment. But within a year he had, as he put it, [...] "wheedled his way" [...] into the new science of radio astronomy, and he described 1948–50 as a tremendously exciting time.... The only two really powerful groups in radio astronomy were the Australian one and Cambridge; and... we all thought we had the edge over the Cambridge group. [...] Joe Pawsey {{was the sort of}} father of radio astronomy in Australia. He was a wonderfully inspiring leader, very self-effacing and taking no credit for himself, and he was a delight to work under. And he did something which I appreciated greatly: he left me alone to do my own research but <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>come</b> to him at any time and get his advice.This advice, Wild acknowledged, [...] "was often very perceptive, very good". Pawsey’s approach became a template that Wild would follow.|$|E

6000|$|... "When <b>I</b> say <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>come,</b> <b>I</b> mean <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not see you; for I {{came with}} mamma {{the very day}} we heard what had happened. Mr. MacTurk then told us it was {{impossible}} to admit any stranger." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I must go {{and change}} my clothes, Mr. Waddington," [...] he declared. [...] "I don't know {{how on earth}} <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have <b>come</b> out looking such a sight. I feel like working, too." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ready," [...] I repeated. [...] "I am no blower and boaster {{like some}} that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> name. <b>Come</b> on!" [...] And drawing my sword, I fell on guard as Alan himself had taught me.|$|R
6000|$|... "I know that, mother," [...] {{returned}} Richard rising. [...] "But then <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>come</b> home {{once in a}} while. The city is not so {{very far}} away." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I wish," [...] I said, [...] "it didn't matter. I wish <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>come</b> and go {{and fear}} nobody--and spend long hours with you--oh! at our ease." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Isn't--isn't there {{anything}} I {{could do for}} you, then? I'll stay here in England to do it, if you like. Perhaps <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>come</b> and see you sometimes.' ...|$|E
60|$|MAGGIE. She's very keen. Comtesse, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>come</b> {{for a day}} by and by {{to see how you}} {{are getting}} on. Yes--yes--certainly. [To JOHN] She says she'll be delighted.|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{will be very}} nice. Shall I {{come and}} see you there? It is in this direction, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>come</b> any {{afternoon}} by train for half an hour?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, no, {{you must}} not think of any such thing: I must begin to face the world alone at once. I assure you, Mrs. Crawford, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>come</b> here. <b>I</b> should only keep your friends away." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Allie," [...] {{burst out}} Neale, [...] "they {{never told me}} a word about you--never gave me a hint. They sent {{for me to come}} back to my job. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have <b>come</b> a day sooner--the day Campbell found me.... Oh!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't mind {{saying now}} that I am glad it is so," [...] said Gregory; [...] "though as regards Clary {{that seems to}} be cruel. But I don't think <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have <b>come</b> much here had she become your wife." ...|$|R
