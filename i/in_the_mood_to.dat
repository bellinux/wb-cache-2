It is said, according to Sunni Muslim accounts, that before returning to Syria, the governor Muawiyah, Uthman’s cousin, suggested that Uthman should come with him to Syria as the atmosphere there was peaceful. Uthman rejected his offer, saying that he didn't want to leave the city of Muhammad (referring to Medina). Muawiyah then suggested that he be allowed to send a strong force from Syria to Medina to guard Uthman against any possible attempt by rebels to harm him. Uthman rejected it too, saying that the Syrian forces in Medina would be an incitement to civil war, and he could not be party to such a move.|$|E

30|$|There are two {{possible}} explanations for <b>the</b> decline <b>in</b> <b>the</b> magnitude of the t-statistics of <b>the</b> <b>mood</b> variable. One possible source for this decline is the general decline of the day-of-the-week effect as documented <b>in</b> <b>the</b> previous subsection. The second {{possible explanation is that}} <b>the</b> ability of <b>mood</b> <b>to</b> explain <b>the</b> effect has declined. It appears to us that this reflects more of a general decline <b>in</b> <b>the</b> magnitude of the day-of-the-week effect than a decline <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ability of <b>mood</b> <b>to</b> explain it. <b>The</b> basis for this conjecture {{is the fact that the}} proportion of variation of average abnormal returns explained by <b>the</b> <b>mood</b> variable, as measured by the ratio of R 2, does not show a declining trend over time. For example, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> EW portfolio, the proportion of variation of average abnormal returns explained by <b>the</b> <b>mood</b> variable <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first, second, and third subperiods is 64.1 %, 85.8 %, and 85.5 %, respectively.

We conclude, therefore, that <b>the</b> reduction <b>in</b> <b>the</b> magnitude of the t-statistics of <b>the</b> <b>mood</b> variable is more likely the result of <b>the</b> general decline <b>in</b> <b>the</b> magnitude of the day-of-the-week effect than a decline <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ability of <b>mood</b> <b>to</b> explain <b>the</b> effect.|$|R

40|$|The {{mechanism}} underlying improvement after total {{sleep deprivation}} (TSD) was studied in 14 major depressed patients. The suggestions that (1) circadian processes and/or (2) dimensions of arousal {{may play a}} role <b>in</b> <b>the</b> response to TSD were investigated. Diurnal variation of depressed mood and of mood- and arousal-related vocal parameters was studied <b>in</b> relation to <b>the</b> effect of TSD on depressed mood and vocal parameters. During 3 baseline days, during TSD and 2 days after TSD vocal parameters and depressed mood were assessed 6 and 3 times daily respectively. The mean fundamental frequency (frequency of vocal fold vibration, F 0) (presumably reflecting aspects of arousal) as well as the range of the F 0 (proposed to reflect sadness) showed a clear circadian pattern with a peak at about 4. 00 p. m. TSD affected the circadian organization of the mean F 0 and advanced the peak of the curve. After one night of subsequent sleep this effect disappeared. In addition, improvement after TSD coincided with an increase of the mean F 0. The diurnal variation of mood before TSD predicted <b>the</b> <b>mood</b> response <b>to</b> TSD, whereas diurnal variation of vocal parameters did not. Moreover, circadian changes in vocal parameters were not related to changes in depressed mood.

40|$|Acute {{tryptophan}} (trp) depletion, which purportedly decreases brain serotonin, lowers mood {{in normal}} males with a multigenerational {{family history of}} major affective disorder (FH+), but not in male controls. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> present study, the hypothesis that a <b>mood</b> lowering response <b>to</b> acute trp depletion may reflect a susceptibility to depression was investigated further. As both {{a family history of}} major affective disorder (MAD) and female sex are considered to be risk factors for depression, the effects of trp depletion on mood were investigated in control and FH+ women. The temporal stability of <b>mood</b> change <b>to</b> trp depletion, when rechallenged at least one month later, was also assessed in order to appraise its utility as a putative susceptibility marker. Subjects ingested a trp deficient amino acid mixture on two separate occasions and a balanced control mixture containing trp on another occasion.

PSY-PC- 2990 - 01,Honors Research under Dr. Megan Saylor,Advisor: Dr. Judy GarberChildren of depressed mothers are at a higher risk of developing depression in their lifetime compared to children of nondepressed mothers. Based on the tripartite model of depression and anxiety, low positive affect is the core symptom of depression. The current study examined the affect pattern of children of depressed and nondepressed mothers in general and in response to stimuli. Participants were 92 children (ages 8 to 10, mean= 9. 39, SD=. 83; 55. 4 % female) and their mothers. Thirty-seven children were offspring of mothers with a history of depression during the child’s lifetime (high risk), and 55 were offspring of mothers without a depression history (low risk). The Positive Affect and Negative Affect Schedule was used to measure trait and state positive and negative affect; <b>the</b> Smiley Face <b>Mood</b> Rating was used to measure children’s affect after exposure to audio and visual stimuli that were neutral, negative, and positive.
