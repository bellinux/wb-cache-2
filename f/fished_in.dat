5|$|Teleosts are {{economically}} {{important in}} different ways. They are captured for food around the world. A {{small number of}} species such as herring, cod, pollock, anchovy, tuna and mackerel provide people with {{millions of tons of}} food per year, while many other species are <b>fished</b> <b>in</b> smaller amounts. They provide {{a large proportion of the}} fish caught for sport. Commercial and recreational fishing together provide millions of people with employment.|$|E
5|$|The {{effect that}} seamounts have on fish populations {{has not gone}} unnoticed by the {{commercial}} fishing industry. Seamounts were first extensively <b>fished</b> <b>in</b> {{the second half of}} the 20th century, due to poor management practices and increased fishing pressure seriously depleting stock numbers on the typical fishing ground, the continental shelf. Seamounts have been the site of targeted fishing since that time.|$|E

5|$|Feeding on fishes, cephalopods, and crustaceans, the Japanese {{angelshark}} is a nocturnal ambush predator that {{spends most}} of the day lying still on the sea floor. This species gives birth to live young, which are sustained during gestation by yolk. The litter size varies from two to 10. The Japanese angelshark is not dangerous to humans unless provoked. It is <b>fished</b> <b>in</b> large numbers and used for meat and shagreen, a type of leather. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed it under Vulnerable, citing the intense bottom trawling activity within its range and the low resilience of angel sharks to fishing pressure.|$|E
5|$|Harmless to humans, {{the leopard}} shark is caught by {{commercial}} and recreational fisheries {{for food and}} the aquarium trade. This species is mostly <b>fished</b> <b>in</b> the waters off California where, {{after a period of}} population decline in the 1980s, new fishing regulations in the early 1990s reduced harvesting to sustainable levels. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed this species as of Least Concern, while noting that local stocks may easily become overfished because of the shark's slow growth and limited migratory habits.|$|E
40|$|Shoaling {{behaviour}} {{has been}} shown to provide many benefits to group members. In this study we examined the ability of fish shoals to escape from a novel trawl apparatus. <b>Fish</b> <b>in</b> shoals of 5 found, and escaped through, a hole in the oncoming trawl more quickly than <b>fish</b> <b>in</b> pairs. <b>Fish</b> <b>in</b> the larger shoals displayed a significant decrease in escape latencies over a series of five trawls, providing clear evidence of net avoidance learning, whereas <b>fish</b> <b>in</b> pairs showed no evidence of learning over successive runs. Observations suggested that more information on the location of the escape route was available to <b>fish</b> <b>in</b> larger shoal sizes owing to social stimulation...|$|R

5|$|Native Americans {{occupied}} the river valleys surrounding the Metacomet Ridge {{for at least}} 10,000 years. Major tribal groups active in the area included the Quinnipiac, Niantic, Pequot, Pocomtuc, and Mohegan. Traprock was used to make tools and arrowheads. Natives hunted game, gathered plants and fruits, and <b>fished</b> <b>in</b> local bodies of water around the Metacomet Ridge. Tracts of woodland in the river bottoms surrounding the ridges were sometimes burned to facilitate the cultivation of crops such as corn, squash, tobacco, and beans.|$|E
5|$|Pacific {{angelsharks}} are {{not dangerous}} to humans unless provoked, {{in which case}} their bite can cause a painful injury. They are valued for their meat and are captured by commercial and recreational fishers across their range. A targeted gillnet fishery for this species began off Santa Barbara, California in 1976 and ended in 1994, after overfishing and new regulations led to its near-collapse. This species is now mainly <b>fished</b> <b>in</b> Mexican waters. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as Near Threatened, as the Californian population is largely protected and recovering, while the impact of Mexican fisheries is unknown.|$|E
5|$|The diet of bigfin reef squids {{comprises}} mainly crustaceans {{and small}} fish. They {{are found in}} the temperate and tropical waters of the Pacific and Indian Oceans, and have recently been introduced into the Mediterranean as a Lessepsian migrant. They are commonly found near the shoreline, near rocks, and coral reefs. They are <b>fished</b> <b>in</b> vast quantities for human food in Asia. Because of their rapid growth rate, short life span, and tolerance to handling and captivity, bigfin reef squids are {{regarded as one of the}} most promising species for mariculture. They are also a valuable source of giant axons for medical research.|$|E
2500|$|Following the {{dissolution}} of the union between Norway and Sweden in 1905 there arose a debate concerning access to <b>fishing</b> <b>in</b> Norwegian territorial waters.

5|$|Often {{encountered}} {{resting on}} the bottom during daytime, the reticulate whipray is a predator of bottom-dwelling invertebrates and bony fishes. Like other stingrays, it is aplacental viviparous, with the developing embryos nourished at first by yolk and later by histotroph ("uterine milk"). Females bear litters of up to five pups in summer, following a gestation period of a year. The reticulate whipray is <b>fished</b> <b>in</b> Southeast Asia {{and parts of the}} Indian Ocean for meat, skin, cartilage, and other purposes. It is highly susceptible to population depletion because of its large size, inshore habits, and low reproductive rate, and is additionally threatened by extensive habitat degradation. Consequently, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as Vulnerable.|$|E
5|$|Solitary and nocturnal, the Pacific {{electric}} ray can generate up to 45 volts of electricity {{for the purposes}} of subduing prey or self-defense. It feeds mainly on bony fishes, ambushing them from the substrate during the day and actively hunting for them at night. Reproduction is aplacental viviparous, meaning that the embryos are initially nourished by yolk, later supplemented by histotroph ("uterine milk") produced by the mother. Females bear litters of 17–20 pups, probably once every other year. Care should be exercised around the Pacific {{electric ray}}, as it has been known to act aggressively if provoked and its electric shock can potentially incapacitate a diver. It and other electric rays are used as model organisms for biomedical research. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this species under Least Concern, as it is not <b>fished</b> <b>in</b> any significant numbers.|$|E
5|$|Sinclair {{took up the}} {{environmental}} cause of her birthplace, the Lord Howe Island, in 1982, when it was listed as an UNESCO World Heritage Site. Though the islanders were pleased with the heritage status accorded to the island, Sinclair was unhappy {{with many of the}} planning and management actions initiated by the Government of Australia to conserve the newly accorded heritage status, as it affected the basic rights of the islanders. Her objections were to the cutting of pine trees planted in the 19th century; she considered these trees (though not indigenous) as part of the island's heritage. When the trees were being felled she threatened to lie down between the trees to stop the tree cutters. Her argument was that the trees added to the aesthetic beauty of the island. She also objected to the neglect of maintenance of embankments that were built to extend the airport on the island, as the embankments were eroding. She objected to the garbage that was being dumped in the lagoon of the island as it was causing health hazards. The management plan proposed by the government to preserve the island's heritage status envisaged restricting the tourist accommodation to about 400 and limiting the number of cars on the island to 100, which she objected for the reason that it was limiting the opportunities to the islanders who had lived there for many years. Another of her protests was on the creation of an aquatic reserve {{in a part of the}} island. She considered this action as detrimental to the fishing rights of the local people who had <b>fished</b> <b>in</b> the area for several years. All her objections resulted in the Ministry of Planning and Environment agreeing to address the issues she had raised. In 1967, she worked in the Prime Minister's Department and dealt with public relations and facilitated the Montreal Expo.|$|E
