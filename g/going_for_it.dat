25|$|With under 3 {{minutes to}} go in the first quarter, Oregon State coach Mike Riley took a chance by <b>going</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> on fourth-and-1 at his own 43, and {{converted}} with Jacquizz Rodgers going for five yards. On the next play, the Beavers faked a dive to Jacquizz and handed instead to James Rodgers on a reverse, then watched him dash in front of the Beavers' bench for a 52-yard touchdown.|$|E
25|$|Minnesota {{responded with}} a drive of its own inside the Tech 30, but it stalled there. In what {{would prove to be}} a {{critical}} decision, Mason decided not to try a field goal, instead <b>going</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> on fourth-and-7 from the Tech 31. Cupito was sacked, giving Tech the ball on their own 37. They proceeded to cut the score to 38-28 on a 1-yard run by Harrell.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to the previous stage, many fewer riders were interested in joining an early breakaway group as the stage featured over 60 kilometers of climbing. 17.5 kilometres into the stage, at the first sprint, there were still no riders who had escaped and so Robbie McEwen saw the possibility of <b>going</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> He succeeded, but mainly because the other sprinters did not even challenge him; this means that they have probably given up for the points classification. It seems now that McEwen just needs {{to make it to}} Paris to win that green jersey.|$|E

25|$|Cleveland {{lost to the}} Giants for {{the second}} time in the sixth game of the season at the Polo Grounds in New York. The Giants again managed to stymie the Browns' passing game, but {{employed}} a different strategy from the one they used in three weeks before. Instead of dropping their defensive ends into coverage to handle Cleveland's receivers, New York allowed single coverage on the receivers and had its ends rush Graham, giving him less time to find his men open. Graham lost 71 yards being tackled while dropping back to pass. A fumble by Graham early in the game was recovered by the Giants, leading to New York's first score, a 22-yard field goal. The Browns scored a field goal midway through the second quarter after <b>going</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> on fourth down at midfield and getting help from an interference penalty. Tony Adamle recovered a fumble on the ensuing kickoff, and the Browns drove into New York territory as time ran out in the first half. Groza kicked a field goal, putting the Browns ahead 6–3. After Cleveland kicked off to New York with only a few seconds left in the half, returner Jim Ostendarp let the ball roll to his own one-yard line and the Browns recovered the live ball. Graham then ran a quarterback sneak for a touchdown. The Giants dominated in the second half, scoring a touchdown on their second drive and adding another in the fourth quarter to win the game, 17–13. Graham was held to just 118 yards of passing on 10 completions. Cleveland defensive end Len Ford suffered a severe injury to his face during the game and had to be taken to the hospital. He sat out the remainder of the regular season and had to have his mouth wired shut so it could heal.|$|E
500|$|Mick LaSalle, {{writing in}} the San Francisco Chronicle, criticized Burton's {{perceived}} image as a creative artist. [...] "All Sleepy Hollow has <b>going</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> is art direction, and even in that it falls back on cliché." [...] Doug Walker linked the film to the Hammer Films style of horror cinematography, considering it an homage to those movies, comparing the usage of dignified British actors, choices in color and movie sets and character relations. Walker gave it the merit of recreating the [...] "very specific genre" [...] of Hammer Films, citing the skill and [...] "clever casting" [...] Burton used to manage this.|$|E
500|$|By 1981, Paul Di'Anno was demonstrating {{increasingly}} self-destructive behaviour, particularly {{through his}} drug usage, about which Di'Anno comments, [...] "it wasn't just that I was snorting {{a bit of}} coke, though; I was just <b>going</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> non-stop, 24 hours a day, every day... the band had commitments piling up that went on for months, years, and I just couldn't see {{my way to the}} end of it. I knew I'd never last the whole tour. It was too much." [...] With his performances suffering, Di'Anno was immediately dismissed following the Killer World Tour, at which point the band had already selected his replacement.|$|E

Edge described {{the game as}} [...] "a straightforward blaster at heart", adding that [...] "the layers of embellishment heaped upon this simple concept truly make Jet Force shine." [...] Scott McCall of AllGame felt that Jet Force Gemini [...] "pays homage to 8- and 16-bit games {{with its emphasis on}} high-intensity action and level design that requires skill with the controller." [...] IGN editor Matt Casamassina remarked that, although the game has some flaws and could be more polished, it is [...] "still one of Nintendo 64's most original games and it has much more good <b>going</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> than it does bad." ...|$|E
500|$|... "First and {{foremost}} I {{thought it was}} a good record. It was poppy and catchy and perfect for the summer. I think my core audience is young teenage girls and gay guys. Both of those groups tend to like pure pop music and I think that's what 'Chico' was. It was very different from the slightly leftfield style of 'Look at Me'. [...] The other thing that 'Chico' had <b>going</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> was that the music was Latin-based, I had written the song back in 1998 but by the time the summer of 1999 came around Latin-influenced music was ruling the charts. Ricky Martin had recently had a number one and there were others on the way. So it was a strange example of synchronicity that I should be ready to go with a Latin track which I had written almost a year before".|$|E
500|$|Although {{many critics}} {{identify}} some flaws, often comparing Szwarc negatively to Spielberg, {{they say that}} [...] "this sequel does have some redeeming qualities <b>going</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> that make it a good movie in its own right". Richard Dreyfuss and Robert Shaw are missed, especially since the teenage characters are labeled [...] "largely annoying 'Afterschool Special' archetypes" [...] who are [...] "irritating and incessantly screaming" [...] and [...] "don't make for very sympathetic victims". Because of its emphasis upon the teenage cast, some critics have compared the film to the popular slasher films that would soon follow. Also comparing the film's [...] "interchangeable teens to slasher films, particularly the Friday the 13th franchise, Muir says that [...] "it feels wrong for a Jaws film to dwell in that shallow domain." [...] However, the critic also commends the teen characters' comradeship and heroism, citing the girl killed when saving Sean from the shark.|$|E

500|$|Among {{more recent}} {{reviews of the}} Yellow Submarine album, David Gassman of PopMatters admires the song for its [...] "mordant humor" [...] and interprets the lyrics as a {{possible}} [...] "dig" [...] at Lennon and McCartney. Gassman adds, {{with reference to the}} superior [...] "It's All Too Much": [...] "as long as songs like this were being relegated to throwaway projects, George could be excused for sniping at John and Paul in 'Only a Northern Song'." [...] Discussing the same two tracks, Pitchfork Media's Mark Richardson writes that they offer little of interest aside from their [...] "swirling" [...] psychedelic effects, although he considers that [...] "Only a Northern Song" [...] "at least has a good joke <b>going</b> <b>for</b> <b>it,</b> simultaneously alluding to the North of England and the Beatles' Lennon-McCartney-dominated publishing company". Mark Kemp of Paste dismisses the song as a [...] "meandering bore".|$|E
500|$|Marshall scored first, on a 16-yard {{pass from}} quarterback Chase Litton to tight end Ryan Yurachek. [...] UConn responded {{on the next}} drive, scoring on a eight-yard {{touchdown}} run by Ron Johnson. [...] The Thundering Herd added two field goals, the second as the second quarter clock expired, to make the score 137 at halftime. [...] Marshall's first three drives {{in the second half}} ended in a turnover on downs after <b>going</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> on 4th-and-2 from the Connecticut 17-yard line, a missed 43-yard field goal attempt, and an interception. [...] Despite this, the Huskies were unable to make progress against the Herd's defense, scoring only a single field goal to cut the lead to 1310 {{at the end of the}} third quarter. [...] Marshall added a field goal late in the fourth quarter; after UConn's last drive ended with an incomplete pass, Marshall was able to run out the clock. The final score was 1610 in the Herd's favor.|$|E

He added that [...] "watching Linda Marlowe, Annette Badland, Ann Mitchell and Timothy West <b>going</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> on screen is going to be electric." [...] Marlowe explained that Babe had hidden Sylvie away because of her Alzheimer's disease and the behaviour that accompanies the illness. She noted that Babe and Sylvie were close because they were fond of each other, but opined that Sylvie is [...] "a little bit intimidated" [...] by Babe because she can be [...] "very scary" [...] and [...] "a bit conniving". Hughes (Digital Spy) disapproved of Babe's treatment of Sylvie and noted that Babe struggled to overcome Stan choosing Sylvie instead of her, making her [...] "a woman with issues." ...|$|E

500|$|Pfeiffer {{starred in}} Amy Heckerling's romantic comedy I Could Never Be Your Woman (2007), with Paul Rudd and Saoirse Ronan, portraying [...] Rosie, a 40-year-old {{divorced}} mother {{working as a}} scriptwriter and producer for a television show {{who falls in love}} with a much younger man (Rudd). Her reported salary was US$1 million, with an advance on 15 percent of the gross. However, the film was only distributed on home video markets. Reviews for I Could Never Be Your Woman were moderately positive, with critic James Berardinelli finding Pfeiffer and Rudd to [...] "have adequate chemistry to pull off the romance" [...] in what he described as an [...] "enjoyable romantic comedy that has enough <b>going</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> to make it worth a recommendation". She next starred in Personal Effects (2009), opposite Ashton Kutcher, playing two grieving people coping with the pain and frustration of their loss whose bond spawns an unlikely romance. The drama premiered at Iowa City's Englert Theatre.|$|E
500|$|Varietys Brian Lowry {{called it}} [...] "clever, irreverent, satirical and outfitted" [...] {{but that it}} was [...] "just barely" [...] capable of {{sustaining}} a running time longer than a television episode. Lisa Schwarzbaum praised the voice cast but stated that the [...] "'action' sequences sometimes falter". When comparing the film to the early episodes of the show, Stephen Rowley concluded that the film [...] "has more <b>going</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> than the show in its later years, but {{is still a long way}} short of what made it so invigorating". The Monthly critic Luke Davies echoed Lowry's concerns about the length: [...] "everything moves with the whip-crack speed of a half-hour episode. And that's the paradox: it makes the film feel like three episodes strung together. We're in a cinema, and we expect something epic." [...] He opined that [...] "in the great arc that is the history of The Simpsons, this film will come to be seen as oddity rather than apotheosis." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{adductor}} injury kept Raonic out {{of competition}} for six weeks, {{during which he}} withdrew from the Delray Beach Open and the Mexican Open, and Canada's Davis Cup clash with France. He returned to action at the Indian Wells Masters, reaching the final against world No. 1 Djokovic {{with a string of}} four victories over top20 opponents: Bernard Tomic, Berdych, Monfils, and David Goffin. In the semifinal victory over Goffin, Raonic's average second serve (112mph) was faster than Goffin's average first serve (110mph). Before the final, Djokovic said: [...] "Milos is probably playing the best tennis that he has ever played. His serve was phenomenal before the start of this season, but it seems like he has improved even more, especially the second serve. He's <b>going</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> more.

500|$|IGN's Matt Risley {{rated the}} episode 8 out of 10, praising Gatiss's script which [...] "moved the drama and horror {{straight}} into the miniaturised heart of a rickety creepy dolls house, {{with a set of}} villains that— while never as memorable or scary as their look may suggest— used sound design to its most effective". He said that the main story [...] "soared", though the sidelined Amy and Rory left [...] "little impact" [...] in relation to the Doctor, George, and Alex. Russell Lewin of SFX gave [...] "Night Terrors" [...] three and a half out of five stars, saying that it had [...] "many great things <b>going</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> but perhaps hasn't quite got that little extra something that would have turned it into a classic" [...] and that nothing seemed especially unexpected. However, he praised the shots of the doll house and apartment buildings, the sound, dolls, the acting of Matt Smith and Daniel Mays, and the idea of George being alien who created the reality.|$|E
500|$|Justin Chang of Variety {{called it}} [...] "a gritty, {{convoluted}} but steadily engrossing crime thriller ... a tense, well-acted B movie". Furthermore, he praised its soundtrack, [...] "neon-smeared" [...] cinematography, and [...] "whiplash editing". Neil Young of The Hollywood Reporter {{described it as}} a [...] "likably rough-edged hitmen-vs.-cops thriller", and similarly praised the editing and cinematography. Writing for The New York Times, Jeannette Catsoulis selected On the Job as her [...] "Critic's Pick", calling it a [...] "propulsive thriller" [...] which [...] "is never less than arresting". Gabe Toro of IndieWire gave the film a B minus grade rating and called it [...] "a propulsive new actioner", comparing it to the Hong Kong film Infernal Affairs (2002) and its American remake The Departed (2006). Justin Monroe of Complex magazine gave it 7/10, writing, [...] "On the Job could have been a simple-minded, serviceable action flick if all it had <b>going</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> was the grit and grime of Filipino streets, stylized violence, and its insane premise, but Matti's thriller has more substance, driven by more fully realized characters and the compelling relationships between these men as they struggle to survive." ...|$|E

Listening to it, I {{can tell}} that I was really <b>going</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> when I wrote and {{recorded}} {{a lot of those}} songs." [...] In 2010, Bell told The Aquarian Weekly: [...] "Pinkerton has definitely taken {{on a life of its}} own and became more successful and more accepted ... As an artist, you just have to do what you believe in at the time, whether it’s accepted or not. You just have to keep going with it." [...] In 2015, following the Pinkerton reissue and the [...] "Memories" [...] tour, in which Weezer performed Blue and Pinkerton in their entirety, Cuomo said:The experience of learning those songs again, singing them every night, working on them with the guys, and then being in a relatively small venue with 1,000 of the most hardcore Weezer fans and hearing them sing every syllable, seeing them air-drum all the fills—it was such an amazing experience and so different from what we'd been doing the years before that ...
