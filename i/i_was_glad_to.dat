I hated it every time we played it so <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> see that part go!" [...] In mid August 2006, Machine Head announced that the title of their sixth studio effort would be The Blackening. Flynn and drummer Dave McClain spent August 18 and 19 jamming together, fine tuning songs chosen for the album and performing pre-production. Phil Demmel resumed lead guitar duties and Adam Duce returned as bassist.|$|E

500|$|Both {{the public}} and critics were unnerved {{by the sight of}} the work. Russell {{describes}} being shocked by [...] "images so unrelievedly awful that the mind shut with a snap at the sight of them. Their anatomy was half-human, half-animal, and they were confined in a low-ceilinged, windowless and oddly proportioned space. They could bite, probe, and suck, and they had very long eel-like necks, but their functioning in other respects was mysterious. Ears and mouths they had, but two at least of them were sightless." [...] Writing for Apollo magazine, Herbert Furst recalled, [...] "I, I must confess, was so shocked and disturbed by the Surrealism of Francis Bacon that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> escape from this exhibition.

[...] The triptych caused a sensation, and overnight turned Bacon into the most controversial painter in the country.|$|E
500|$|The project caused {{division}} in Blink-182, mostly between DeLonge and Hoppus. Hoppus {{was interested in}} {{being a part of}} the record, but DeLonge did not want it to turn into a Blink-182 album. DeLonge contended that the involvement of Barker was to refrain from having to pay a session musician. Regardless, Hoppus felt betrayed and unresolved tension dogged the band until their 2005 breakup. [...] "Nobody talked about it. It was this strange situation that nobody addressed," [...] DeLonge told Blender. Barker felt guilty when he told Hoppus they were going to tour in support of the album: [...] "I felt like I had let him down [...] but he was ultimately more upset at Tom because they had ten years of history together before me." [...] Despite this tension, Hoppus lent vocals to the track [...] "Elevator" [...] and shared early ideas for the next Blink-182 album. In a later Reddit AMA, Hoppus concluded, [...] "The whole situation sucked. But I sang on the track because, at the heart of it, Tom and Travis are my friends. I'm sure Tom felt the tension and asked me as an offering. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> have done it, and I was glad that he asked." ...|$|E

She had been at Spithead on 1 May, when the 98-gun [...] caught fire and blew up, with Bellerophon rescuing twelve men. Still with the Channel Fleet, she joined a squadron commanded by Vice-Admiral Sir William Cornwallis which was patrolling off Ushant. The squadron had arrived on station on 7 June, and the following day captured a convoy of eight French merchants off Belle Île. The squadron remained in the area until 16 June, when a lookout on Bellerophon spotted a large fleet to the east-south-east. This was the Brest fleet, consisting of thirteen ships of the line, two frigates, two brigs and a cutter, under Admiral Villaret de Joyeuse. Heavily outnumbered, Cornwallis ordered a retreat, but the Bellerophon and [...] sailed unusually slowly {{and he found himself}} being steadily overhauled by the French. Keeping his ships together, Cornwallis ordered Bellerophon to take up position at the head of his line, later explaining that [...] "The Bellerophon <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> keep in some measure as a reserve, having reason at first to suppose there would be full occasion for the utmost exertions of us all...

500|$|The episode {{received}} positive reviews. The {{episode was}} described as [...] "tense", with Christine Orlando from TV Fanatic, saying that [...] ""Missing" [...] upped the emotional intensity when the autopsies weren't about finding a killer, but about finding a kidnapped little boy". Orlando said that the scenes with Bud were a highlight, {{as well as the}} scenes with Megan and Derek. Orlando said, [...] "I enjoyed the banter between Megan and Derek. He's the optimist to her pessimist. When they get the photo of the boy, Derek pointed out that at least he's alive and not alone. Megan said yes, but he's sick and possibly coughing up blood. The amateur nature of the photo gave Derek hope that the kidnapper wasn't a professional. Great, said Megan, that meant he was incompetent and desperate. Was anyone else seeing a case where opposites attract?". She said it was a [...] "pity" [...] that Megan turned Derek down; [...] "Megan could use a bit of a love life and I'm hoping we see more of Agent Ames in the future". She said she was [...] "thankful" [...] that there was not a storyline with Lacey (Mary Mouser), saying that the storyline with Megan and Kate arguing over Lacey had gotten [...] "old", [...] "I'm happy they seem to be moving on". Finishing, she praised the scenes with Megan and Joan and added, [...] "Having been a bit bored with last week's episode, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> see Body of Proof step up its game.

Proposing a date for it ultimately required comparison with dated texts, {{which tend to be}} in documentary hands (contracts, petitions, letters).
