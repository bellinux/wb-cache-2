5|$|A northwestern {{expansion}} of the City Circle Line was planned, where M4 would divert at Nørrebro and run to the suburbs of Brønshøj and Gladsaxe. This project was abandoned, as the interchange chamber between any such line and the City Circle Line was scrapped {{as part of the}} City of Copenhagen's 2009 budget. In subsequent plans, the northern extension of the M4 has instead been relocated as a Nordhavn branch which will connect with the City Circle Line at Østerport. A Nordhavn line with two stations has been approved by the <b>Danish</b> <b>parliament,</b> and is planned to open in 2019. The southern extension of the M4 will run from Copenhagen Central Station through Sydhavn to Ny Ellebjerg, where the M4 will link up with the S-train and regional train system. The Danish Transport Authority (Trafikstyrelsen) has suggested to convert the F-line of the S-train network to metro standard as an M5 line, but as the only linkup between the M5 and the existing network would be at Flintholm Station (interchange with M1 and M2), this plan is dependent on the approval of a southern extension of the M4, also providing the M5 with an interchange with the M4 at Ny Ellebjerg Station.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the political debate}} and legislation, about women’s right to be clergymen in the Danish church”folkekirken”. By analyzing the debate and how it revealed itself in the <b>Danish</b> <b>parliaments</b> two chambers, “Folketinget” and “Landstinget”, in the period 1947 - 1948, the different arguments about women’s rights to be clergymen in the Danish “folkekirken” is outlined and it is establish that the primary argument, for women´s right to be clergymen, was the argument of gender equality. The part of the parliament, who was against women´s right to be clergymen consisted primarily of conservative politicians, and together with the church bishops, {{they found that the}} law was violating the tradition of the church and pushing the boundaries between the church and the state, especially because the church, did not have a constitution of its own. The paper also examines how the debate and the final legislation, affected the boundaries {{between the state and the}} church. It concludes that this was affected but not violated, because the state, due to the missing constitution of the church, had the right to decide church affairs. Secondly it is examined how the debate affected the broadness of the church, and concludes that the debate together with other debates, broadened the Danish church “folkekirken” considerable, to match the broadness of the Danish state...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project is to analyse how the {{communication}} between <b>Danish</b> Members of <b>Parliament</b> and citizens {{is affected by the}} emerging digital culture by focusing on the politicians’ use of social media. We use a broad range of theory from amongst Castells, Bruns, Deuze, Hjarvard, Gulbrandsen and Just to explain the characteristics of the communication and to see how this affects citizens, politicians and media organizations. Furthermore, we have gathered qualitative data by conducting interviews with <b>Danish</b> Members of <b>Parliament</b> and quantitative data from a survey targeting users of social media. Our results show that there is incongruence between the citizens’ perception of the politicians’ communication on social media and how the politicians conceive their communication towards the citizens. We find that the politicians’ use of social media partly is an instrument to gain general media coverage and to set the political agenda and to a lesser extend a channel in which to create dialogue and public participation...|$|R
