Two different varnishes, one made with a low molecular weight resin and having low viscosity, and another, made with a polymer of high molecular weight and having high viscosity, were applied over glass plates that had been given surface roughness in the micrometer range. Measurement of the topography showed that the polymeric resin eliminated mid-to-high spatial frequency roughness of the ground glass but did not eliminate roughness of lower spatial frequencies. The results are discussed in terms of the surface state of the varnish, using concepts such as root-mean-square roughness, total integrated scattering and the power spectral density. These observations indicate that both varnishes reduce the wide-angle light scattering by the rough substrates, but only the varnish made with the low molecular weight resin reduces the small-angle scattering about the specular refl ection. This suggests that the smoothness of the varnished surface depends both on the molecular weight of the resin and on the spatial frequencies of the surface roughness of the surface beneath it. A model for the drying of varnishes is presented that takes the spatial frequency dependence into account...|$|E
40|$|Human {{observers}} {{are able to}} make fine discriminations of surface gloss. What cues are they using to perform this task? In previous studies, we identified two reflection-related cuesâ€”the contrast of the reflected image (c, contrast gloss) and the sharpness of reflected image (d, <b>distinctness-of-image</b> <b>gloss)</b> [...] but these were for objects rendered in standard dynamic range (SDR) images with compressed highlights. In ongoing work, we are studying the effects of image dynamic range on perceived gloss, comparing high dynamic range (HDR) images with accurate reflections and SDR images with compressed reflections. In this paper, we first present the basic findings of this gloss discrimination study then present an analysis of eye movement recordings that show where observers were looking during the gloss discrimination task. The results indicate that: 1) image dynamic range has significant influence on perceived gloss, with surfaces presented in HDR images being seen as glossier and more discriminable than their SDR counterparts; 2) observers look at both light source highlights and environmental interreflections when judging gloss; and 3) both of these results are modulated by surface geometry and scene illumination. (a) Figure 1 : (a) Luminance maps of a sample high dynamic range (HDR) and standard dynamic range (SDR) image pair of a bunny object. Note the high intensities in the HDR highlights and the highlight compression in the SDR image. (b) Eye movement scanpaths over the sample pair showing fixations made when discriminating gloss...|$|E

For such high quality printing products, printing inks with special effect pigments are used more frequently {{due to the}} unique optical properties and visual appearance. The shifting color, the pearlescent gloss and the visible texture of printed special effect colors fascinate the observer. A {{lack of knowledge about}} the printing of special effect colors and about the description of the optical properties and visual appearance causes problems. First, special effect printing calls for knowledge about the influence of different printing parameters. Therefore, multiple samples varying in the special effect pigment, paper quality, varnishing state and background color were printed. In screen printing, 22 inks with pigments of BASF SE were applied on a white glossy and black uncoated paper. The combination of 22 pigments with two paper grades or background colors results in 44 application cases. In total, 224 application cases were realized in flexo printing with 28 pigments of MERCK KGaA, two paper qualities, two background colors and two varnishing states. A white glossy and matt coated paper was partially primed with a black light-absorbing ink and partly varnished with a clear gloss varnish. Furthermore, some knowledge about the bidirectional reflectance and texture distribution is required to specify the optical properties. A database was thus generated basing on spectral and imaging measurements in multiple geometric configurations. The determined reflectance spectra, color coordinates and texture parameters are filed in a hierarchical structure. Using the freely available bidirectional reflectance and texture data (www. idd. tu-darmstadt. de, office@idd. tudarmstadt. de), the influence of the varied printing parameters on perception-related parameters was investigated. A medium and very high hue difference sum is caused by interference effect and multi-color pigments, respectively. For the comparably large sparkle pigments, the sparkle parameters are particularly high. Perceptually, the lightness difference sum and the relative luminance difference do not satisfactorily represent the lightness shift and the contrast gloss or <b>distinctness-of-image</b> <b>gloss.</b> All considered parameters are significantly lower for the white paper than the black printed background. Finally, the essential visual appearance attributes should be known for the description of the visual appearance. Their number and nature was determined by means of visual experiments and statistical evaluations. In a color matching light both and a multi-angle test bench, 14 rolled screen and 20 planar flexo printing samples were presented, respectively. Visual differences and twelve attributes were rated in relative and absolute category scaling experiments, respectively. They were evaluated in classical multidimensional scaling, in two correlation analyses, a principal component analysis and in an exploratory factor analysis. According to the STRESS values, cumulated variances and the eigenvalues, at most six attributes are essential. Significantly positive correlation coefficients between the two and three tested gloss and texture attributes, respectively, suggest their joint consideration. The composition and factor loadings indicate that the six essential attributes are the four color attributes hue, chroma, lightness and hue shift as well as the two combined attributes for gloss and texture...|$|E
