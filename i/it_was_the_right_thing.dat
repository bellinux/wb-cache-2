5|$|Felton (Daniel Baldwin) visits Harry Prentice (Wilford Brimley), {{the elderly}} and bed-ridden father of his friend Chuckie (Michael Chaban). Ill and miserable, the hard-bitten Harry has decided he wants to die and has hired a suicide doctor. Felton {{believes}} this is wrong and convinces Chuckie to call it off, much to Harry's anger. A few days later, however, Harry wears Chuckie down and convinces his son to shoot him {{to death with a}} handgun. When Lewis (Clark Johnson) and Crosetti (Jon Polito) investigate, Chuckie claims Harry shot himself, which Lewis does not believe. Felton talks to Chuckie at the police station and Chuckie admits to the assisted suicide, but Felton tells him to stick to the original suicide story. Lewis realizes what happened and confronts Felton, who admits what Chuckie did and suggests <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>thing</b> to do, but Lewis adamantly disagrees. Since the bullet evidence is inconclusive, Felton asks Lewis to let Chuckie secretly wash his hands so no gunpowder residue will be found in tests. Lewis initially refuses, but he eventually reluctantly agrees, allowing Chuckie to get away with the shooting.|$|E
25|$|De Gaulle {{initially}} reacted angrily to {{news of the}} Royal Navy’s {{attack on}} the French fleet (3 July); Pétain and others wrongly blamed him for provoking it by his 26 June speech (in fact it had been planned at least as early as 16 June). He considered withdrawing to Canada to live as a private citizen and waited five days before broadcasting. Spears called on de Gaulle on 5 July and found him “astonishingly objective” and acknowledging that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>thing</b> from the British point of view. Spears reported to Churchill that de Gaulle had shown “a splendid dignity”. In his broadcast of 8 July {{he spoke of the}} “pain and anger” caused by the attack and that it was a “hateful tragedy not a glorious battle”, but that one day the enemy would have used the ships against England (sic) or the French Empire, and that the defeat of England would mean “bondage forever” for France. “Our two ancient nations … remain bound to one another. They will either go down both together or both together they will win”.|$|E

500|$|For the Test {{series against}} Pakistan, Trescothick {{was offered the}} {{captaincy}} once more due to an injury to Vaughan. He was unsure whether to accept but realised that as [...] "unofficial second in command...I believe <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>thing</b> to step up. It is exciting to think I could be in charge for a few weeks...I {{know there is a}} chance I maybe won't be a one-match wonder this time – it could be the whole series, but being very close to Michael, I've seen the things it [...] does to you." [...] As it transpired, Trescothick scored 193 in the first innings (although England lost the match), and Vaughan returned for the second Test. Trescothick had considered leaving the tour early when his father-in-law had a serious accident, but stayed in Pakistan as fellow opener Andrew Strauss returned home to attend the birth of his first child.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} given a score of eight out of ten in Dreamwatch magazine, with the review saying that it {{delivered}} a [...] "philosophical meditation {{on the nature of}} power" [...] asking [...] "does the possession automatically corrupt the possessor?" [...] It praised the nature of the episode, saying the plot was [...] "very clever". But the review said that the ending was ambiguous about whether or not Chakotay agrees with what he is doing on behalf of the Co-operative. When reviewing the fourth season for the website DVD Talk, Holly E. Ordway described [...] "Unity" [...] as being [...] "noteworthy as an episode with more depth and complexity than the typical Voyager episode thus far", and said that it was likely to be remembered by the fans as the episode which introduced the Borg to the series. She added that the plot was [...] "well thought out" [...] and that the ending left the viewer with a moral dilemma over whether <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>thing</b> to do.|$|E

Joining the United States Marine Corps, he attended Marine Officers Candidate School and was commissioned as a second lieutenant at Marine Corps Base Quantico in 1967. After this he was deployed to Vietnam, beginning his tour of duty in December 1967. Initially he served as a platoon commander in a motor transport battalion stationed at Gia Le near Da Nang, under the command of Colonel Robert Reilly. While deployed, Gorksi took part in the Battle of Huế during the Tet Offensive, at which time his unit was employed largely in an infantry role. [...] In April 1968, Gorski was the officer responsible for the night watch of battalion headquarters in Gia Le, when a North Vietnamese assault breached the perimeter wire fence. During the skirmish that followed, Gorksi directed artillery and mortar fire. About a dozen North Vietnamese were killed in the engagement, along with three Marines. In January 1969 Gorski returned to the United States, having risen to the rank of captain. He earned no medals for bravery, however, nor was he wounded.|$|E

Yoko Ono was hesitant about allowing Glee {{the rights to}} [...] "Imagine". Series music supervisor P.J. Bloom explained: [...] "It {{was very difficult to}} convince Yoko Ono that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>thing</b> to do. She needed to truly understand how the music was going to be used. The added component of us wanting to have a deaf choir signing the song made for this incredibly poignant moment. ...It really took a lot of convincing to get her on board and realize that it was a great, great moment, and a tribute to John and his song." [...] Jenna Ushkowitz has commented that the performance of [...] "Imagine" [...] brought the cast and crew of Glee to tears, and that several cast members got [...] "Imagine" [...] tattoos afterwards as it was [...] "such a nice checkpoint in our lives." [...] Studio recordings of all the songs performed in the episode except [...] "You're the One That I Want" [...] were released as singles, available for digital download.

I thought about it very much before I pulled the trigger and because of that, I have never looked back. The past is where it's supposed to be."
