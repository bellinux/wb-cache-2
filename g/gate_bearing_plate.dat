Four specimens of the concrete substructure are cast in two different sizes and strain gages embedded in the concrete at several locations. The effects of the thickness of the <b>bearing</b> <b>plate,</b> size of the concrete substructure, ratio of the plate area to block area, overhang of the <b>bearing</b> <b>plate</b> beyond the loaded area, and the ratio of the loaded area to plate area have also been studied. The experimental study comprises of 72 tests in the working stress range and four ultimate load tests. Stresses beneath the <b>bearing</b> <b>plate</b> in the concrete substructure and on the <b>bearing</b> <b>plates</b> are measured and presented. For the ultimate load tests, relative slip between the <b>bearing</b> <b>plate</b> and the concrete, and the relative lift of the plate edge in relation to concrete is measured and presented.

The paper {{presents}} the equations for {{the determination of}} the neutral axis position, when it is on the face, that is, on the <b>bearing</b> <b>plate,</b> and for the highest normal tensile stress in the fastener, {{as well as for the}} determination of highest and lowest normal compressive stress occurring on the face, that is <b>bearing</b> <b>plate</b> when the neutral axis is outside the face, that is, the <b>bearing</b> <b>plate.</b> Which of these three possible cases will occur, depends solely on the force field occurring in the given cross-section for the dimensioning of the joint.

40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{a series of}} web crippling tests on cold-formed unlipped channels with flanges restrained (fastened) as well as channels with flanges unrestrained (unfastened). The tests were performed under end and interior two-flange loading conditions specified in the North American Specification and Australian/New Zealand Standard for cold-formed steel structures, namely end-two-flange and interior-two-flange loading conditions. The concentrated load was applied by a <b>bearing</b> <b>plate</b> at the top flange of the channels, and the reaction force applied by an identical <b>bearing</b> <b>plate</b> at the bottom flange of the channels. The <b>bearing</b> <b>plates</b> acted across the full flange widths of the channels. The flanges of the channels were either bolted {{to one or two}} <b>bearing</b> <b>plates</b> for the specimens with flanges restrained. The web crippling test strengths are compared with the design strengths obtained using the North American Specification, Australian/New Zealand Standard and American Iron and Steel Institute Specification for cold-formed steel structures. It is shown that the design strengths predicted by the North American Specification using the unfastened design rules are generally conservative, but unconservatively predicted using the fastened design rules, even when the flanges of the specimens were restrained. The design strengths predicted by the Australian/New Zealand Standard and American Iron and Steel Institute Specification are unconservative. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Screen {{material}} {{in the form of}} welded wire mesh and geogrids are used in underground coal mines to prevent the fall of small pieces of rock from the roof between roof bolts. Further, if the screen is installed during the production cycle, roof fall injuries can be reduced significantly. Therefore, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), because of the safety implications, conducted an evaluation of screen materials commonly used in U. S. coal mines to determine their support characteristics and identify the parameters that could affect their performance with respect to controlling the fall of rock from the roof surface. To evaluate the load and stiffness characteristics of the screen, a test frame was designed and installed in the Mine Roof Simulator (MRS) at the NIOSH Pittsburgh Research Laboratory (PRL). With this test set up, the screen is bolted at four corners of the frame and a center load is applied. The test set up allows for up to 20 in of screen deflection while the load and screen defection are continuously recorded. A series of tests were conducted to evaluate the effects of various parameters such as bolt tension, the type of load bearing surface and the size of <b>bearing</b> <b>plates</b> on welded screen performance. The most common screen material used in U. S. coal mines is an 8 -gauge wire welded in a 4 -by- 4 -in spacing or aperture. The peak screen load was normally limited by wire breakage. The conditions at the <b>bearing</b> <b>plate</b> influence the nature of the wire breakage. However, the screen stiffness was controlled by slippage at the <b>bearing</b> <b>plates,</b> and by weld and wire failure. The size of the <b>bearing</b> <b>plate</b> had a significant effect on the performance of the welded screen. Therefore, the design capacity of the 8 -gauge screen is evaluated based on plate size. For a 6 -by- 6 -in <b>bearing</b> <b>plate</b> the average peak load is 2, 900 lb with a stiffness of 250 lb/in. For an 8 -by- 8 -in <b>bearing</b> <b>plate,</b> the average peak load is 4, 500 lb with a stiffness of 430 lb/in. These test results are based on a 4 -by- 4 -ft bolt spacing.

Lead sheets were used between the load <b>bearing</b> <b>plates</b> and girder surface to aid in uniform loading. The MTS “MultiFlex” System precisely controlled the applied loads and displacements through the actuators. Each girder was first loaded using Actuators B and C under a load-control mode {{at a rate of}} 9  KN/min. As soon as the slope of load versus displacement curve for girder being tested dropped, the actuator control-mode was switched to a displacement-control at a rate of 5  mm/h until shear failure occurred {{at either end of the}} girder. The displacement-control mode was essential in capturing the ductility or brittleness behavior of the girder failing in shear.|$|R
