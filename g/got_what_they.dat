25|$|One {{episode of}} Harry & Paul {{featured}} a sketch, {{split in two}} parts called On the TARDIS, which was a cross between Doctor Who and On the Buses. Stan Butler (Harry Enfield) played the Doctor while Jack Harper (Paul Whitehouse) was the companion. The pair were planning to flee from Olivia (finding her far more frightening than the Daleks) {{to go to the}} planet Raving Nympho to be with lots of girls. Instead, they land on the planet Woolly Woofter and encounter camp people. In Part 2, Blakely turned up as The Master before the lads <b>got</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> wanted: three gorgeous girls.|$|E
500|$|With 54,288 total entries and a {{combined}} prize pool of $159,796,918, the 2007 WSOP {{was the largest}} series of poker tournaments ever. [...] For many, winning {{a share of the}} prize pool was all that mattered, while others sought the glory associated with winning a bracelet. [...] This dichotomy could not have been illustrated better than a deal negotiated at the Senior Championship event. Tony Korfman wanted the money while Ernest Bennett wanted the glory. [...] Rather than leave their fates to chance, the two of them ensured they <b>got</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> wanted. In exchange for splitting the prize money, Korfman agreed to let Bennett win the bracelet. [...] After winning $8.25million in the Main Event, Jerry Yang and his wife retired. [...] "My winning today also means a lot to me, because I know that I can use this money {{to do a lot of}} good for other people out there," [...] Yang said before donating over a million dollars to charity. [...] Upon winning his record eleventh bracelet, Phil Hellmuth said, [...] "the bracelets have always been a really huge deal, to me more than the other guys, because I knew that they represented history." ...|$|E
2500|$|Most {{university}} lecturers discourage {{students from}} citing any encyclopedia in academic work, preferring primary sources; some specifically prohibit Wikipedia citations. Wales stresses that encyclopedias {{of any type}} are not usually appropriate to use as citable sources, {{and should not be}} relied upon as authoritative. Wales once (2006 or earlier) said he receives about ten emails weekly from students saying they got failing grades on papers because they cited Wikipedia; he told the students they <b>got</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> deserved. [...] "For God's sake, you're in college; don't cite the encyclopedia", he said.|$|E

2500|$|The Fourth of July raid {{had been}} {{specifically}} ordered by General [...] "Hap" [...] Arnold, {{commander of the}} AAF, and approved by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who had promised British Prime Minister Winston Churchill American action against Germany by that date. Arnold believed that the Fourth of July would be an ideal day for the AAF to open its strategic bombing campaign against the Nazis, but General Carl Spaatz, commander of Eighth Air Force, {{did not have any}} of his heavy bombardment groups ready for operational missions, and his only fighter unit, the 31st Fighter Group, was just beginning to familiarize itself with its Supermarine Spitfires. Spaatz considered the mission a stunt triggered by pressure in the American press that believed the people of both the United States and Great Britain needed a psychological boost. He noted in his command diary, [...] "The cameramen and newspapermen finally <b>got</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> wanted-and everybody seemed contented." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the 1950s Federal Republic, {{restitution}} {{laws for}} compensation {{for those who}} had suffered under the Nazis was limited to only those who had suffered from [...] "racial, religious or political reasons", which were defined {{in such a way as}} to sharply limit the number of people entitled to collect compensation. According to the 1953 law on compensation for suffering during the National Socialist era, only those with a territorial connection with Germany could receive compensation for their suffering, which had the effect of excluding the millions of people, mostly from Central and Eastern Europe, who had been taken to Germany to work as slave labor during World War II. In the same vein, to be eligible for compensation they would have to prove that they were part of the [...] "realm of German language and culture", a requirement that excluded most of the surviving slave laborers who did not know German or at least enough German to be considered part of the [...] "realm of German language and culture". Likewise, the law excluded homosexuals, Gypsies, Communists, Asoziale ("Asocials"-people considered by the National Socialist state to be anti-social, a broad category comprising anyone from petty criminals to people who just were merely eccentric and non-conformist), and homeless people for their suffering in the concentration camps under the grounds that all these people were [...] "criminals" [...] whom the state was protecting German society from by sending them to concentration camps, and in essence these victims of the National Socialist state <b>got</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> deserved, making them unworthy of compensation. In this regard it is significant that the 1935 version of Paragraph 175 was not repealed until 1969. As a result, German homosexuals-in many cases survivors of the concentration camps—between 1949 and 1969 continued to be convicted under the same law that had been used to convict them between 1935 and 1945, though in the period 1949–69 they were sent to prison rather than to a concentration camp.|$|E

60|$|J. M.—According to my observation, {{the change}} in my own {{generation}} is different. They have ceased either to trust or to distrust liberty, and {{have come to the}} mind that it matters little either way. Men are disenchanted. They have <b>got</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> wanted in the days of their youth, yet what of it, they ask? France has thrown off the Empire, but the statesmen of the republic are not a great breed. Italy has gained her unity, yet unity has not been followed by thrift, wisdom, or large increase of public virtue or happiness. America has purged herself of slavery, yet life in America is material, prosaic,—so say some of her own rarest sons. Don’t think that I say all these things. But I know able and high-minded men who suffer from this disenchantment.|$|E
