With the amount of space in this area, residents feel that a sports ground is needed. Sport is very popular in Discovery Bay {{with a number of}} sport teams. Recently, there was a protest in the plaza to let Hong Kong Resorts know that everybody wants a sports ground. The government refuses to provide any assistance or land.|$|E
25|$|During his {{period as}} Minister of Finance, Sassoon founded all the {{financial}} and budgeting structures and laws for the Kingdom and looked whole-heartedly after {{the interests of the}} monarchy and the proper fulfilment of its laws. Rather famously, one of his most financially prolific deeds for the State was during negotiations with the British Petroleum Company in 1925. Through a pure stroke of genius and foresight, Sir Sassoon demanded that Iraq’s oil revenue be remunerated in gold rather than sterling; at the time, this request seemed bizarre since sterling was backed by the gold standard. Nevertheless, his demand was reluctantly accepted. Later this concession benefited Iraq’s treasury during World War II, when the gold standard was abandoned and sterling plummeted. He thus secured countless additional millions of Iraqi dinars for the State. This <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Iraqi nation remembers with appreciation and admiration.|$|E

[...] According to the OPCW chief, one abandoned site is in rebel-held territory and routes to others lead through rebel-held territory. Malik Ellahi of the OPCW states that few of the locations inspectors must visit will be difficult to access.|$|E

500|$|The {{asymmetrical}} {{structure of}} the game mostly received praise from critics. Vince Ingenito, from IGN, thought that the system was smart and has successfully delivered a unique multiplayer experience for players. He added {{that the system is}} tactically deep, and that the [...] "evolution" [...] mechanic saved it from being gimmicky. This was contradicted by Steven Strom of Ars Technica, who stated that the game overall was just a [...] "great gimmick and little else: something we'll play for a month or two, and not much longer"., [...] Evan Lahti, from PC Gamer, also commended the structure, and considered it the most compressed multiplayer experience since 2014's Titanfall. He added that such structure <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> genre needs. Anthony LaBella, from Game Revolution, praised the asymmetrical idea. He added that the distant gameplay elements between Monsters and Hunters had successfully introduced Evolve to a broad audience. However, he noted that such a structure may become repetitive and boring for players after months of playthrough. GameSpot's Kevin VanOrd also appreciated the structure, which he thought made every battle feel [...] "vicious and intense". However, Jeff Marchiafava, from Game Informer, thought that the structure felt limited, and that Evolve, even with all the modes, had failed to offer enough variety and challenges to players. Nic Rowan, from Destructoid, thought that Evolve had presented some of the best moments he had had in a multiplayer game, but he felt that these moments are too far between.|$|E

6000|$|The earlier mammals {{probably}} parted {{from their}} offspring {{as soon as}} suckling was over, but, once the capacity for mutual understanding has arisen, the advantages of continuing the association are very great; and we presently find a number of mammalian species displaying {{the beginnings of a}} true social life and keeping together in herds, packs and flocks, watching each other, imitating each other, taking warning from each other's acts and cries. This <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> world had not seen before among vertebrated animals. [...] Reptiles and fish may no doubt be found ill swarms and shoals; they have been hatched in quantities and similar conditions have kept them together, {{but in the case of}} the social and gregarious mammals the association arises not simply from a community of external forces, it is sustained by an inner impulse. They are not merely like one another and so found in the same places at the same times; they like one another and so they keep together.|$|E

However, there are experiences of the need for additional guidance, support, education and contact with the client to enhance a sense of competence in the task and prevent collapse.
