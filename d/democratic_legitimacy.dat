In an effort to enhance transparency, in 2016 the organization held its first public debate between candidates for Secretary-General. On January 1, 2017, Portuguese diplomat António Guterres, who previously served as UN High Commissioner for Refugees, became the ninth Secretary-General. Guterres has highlighted several key goals for his administration, including an emphasis on diplomacy for preventing conflicts, more effective peacekeeping efforts, and streamlining the organization to be more responsive and versatile to global needs.|$|E
5|$|The NMP {{scheme was}} not {{introduced}} without controversy, which may {{lead one to}} question {{the effectiveness of the}} scheme in strengthening representative democracy. Despite the protests of many PAP MPs, the party whip was enforced to effect the passing of this scheme. Criticism of the scheme mainly revolved around the dilution of the <b>democratic</b> <b>legitimacy</b> of the Parliament since the electorate has no say in choosing the NMP based on his or her merits. Further, there may be doubts as to the NMP's commitment and willingness to serve as an MP, since the NMP bypasses the electoral process. The scheme has also given rise to allegations that it serves as another platform for the PAP to undercut support for the opposition.|$|E
5|$|While the Commission is the {{executive}} branch, the candidates are chosen individually by the 28 national governments, which means {{it is not possible}} for a Commission Member or its President to be removed by a direct election. Rather, the legitimacy of the Commission is mainly drawn from the vote of approval that is required from the European Parliament, along with Parliament's power to dismiss the body, which, in turn, raises the concern of the relatively low turnout (less than 50%) in elections for the European Parliament since 1999. While that figure may be higher than that of some national elections, including the off-year elections of the United States Congress, {{the fact that there are}} no elections for the position of Commission President calls the position's legitimacy into question in the eyes of some. The fact that the Commission can directly decide (albeit with oversight from specially formed 'comitology committees') on the shape and character of implementing legislation further raises concerns about <b>democratic</b> <b>legitimacy.</b>|$|E

Self-interest, ideological dedication and even corruption may influence the decisions of judges without any checks and balances in place to prevent this abuse of power if the judiciary is completely independent. The relationship between the judiciary and the executive is a complex series of dependencies and interdependencies which counter-check each other and must be carefully balanced. One cannot be too independent of the other. Furthermore, judicial support of the executive is not as negative as it seems as the executive is the branch of government with the greatest claim to <b>democratic</b> <b>legitimacy.</b> If the judiciary and executive are constantly feuding, no government can function well.|$|E

40|$|The central {{argument}} {{of this work}} is that “democratic constitutional legitimacy”[2] probably does not currently exist {{in the politics of}} any country internationally. This inherent problem in constitutionalism is an endemic governance problem most citizenries should be dealing with, only that we are not in a large extent doing so and haven’t been historically. This position was ascertained using a form of Beck and Grande’s (2010) cosmopolitan methodology in my doctoral thesis (which we shall return to). It is argued that every constitution is in need of considerable rethinking so as to bring its statutes in line with the interests of the plurality of individuals it oversees. Finally, this work attempts to show that research in this area of <b>democratic</b> constitutional <b>legitimacy</b> is lacking in the literature as only a few scholars presently engage the issue (namely Simone Chambers) ...|$|R
40|$|On {{the basis}} of Hannah Arendt’s and Carl Schmitt’s {{writings}} on the constituent power, this article sets out to develop an interpretative framework which would aid {{the understanding of the}} legitimation crisis of European integration initiated by the EU constitutional failure of 2004. The question raised in this essay is whether the successful establishment of <b>democratic</b> constitutional <b>legitimacy</b> is conditional upon the existence of a federal state. From the perspective of the constituent power, two opposing answers are given based on two rivalling notions of the ultimate meaning of constitutional politics: freedom and security. The article concludes that even though the EU as a case remains undecided, it seems likely that democracy and constitutional politics have parted ways in the EU both in the Arendtian and in the Schmittian sense. If that is the case, the constitutional crisis is a serious problem for the future of democracy in the EU...|$|R

As the Constitution places emphasis on the need for <b>democratic</b> <b>legitimacy</b> as well as general elections, it may be reasonable to infer that the structure of the Constitution provides for a right to vote as a fundamental instrument of <b>democratic</b> <b>legitimacy.</b>|$|E

While the path to ratification of the Constitutional Treaty {{appears to have been}} obstructed, the specific provisions in Article 1 - 47 nonetheless invite discussion as to whether the norms may contribute to the theoretical and functional development of democracy beyond an institutionalised conception of representative democracy and whether they can in turn contribute to the legitimation of supranational lawmaking. On the question of 'who can participate', I conclude that contemporary understandings of democracy demand the redefinition of the body politic to encompass all those who reside in the EU...|$|R
500|$|Jackson {{prompted}} {{debate about}} the legitimacy of limiting parliamentary sovereignty and the theoretical justifications for the ruling. Alison Young suggests that the opinions {{could be explained by}} the Parliament Act 1911 modifying the rule of recognition defining valid legal documents or by the Act redefining Parliament in a manner that binds the courts. Christopher Forsyth argues that the Parliament Acts redefined Parliament to be a bicameral body for all legislation which also has a method of unicamerally legislating (except to extend Parliament beyond five years). Jowell proposes that there are two reasons for limiting parliamentary sovereignty – if the <b>democratic</b> <b>legitimacy</b> of the legislature were undermined by its acts or if the body attempted to remove fundamental rights in a democratic society – [...] and cites support for these arguments from the judgment. The case was also criticised for claims made by Lord Steyn and Lord Hope that the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty was solely a judicial creation.|$|E
