25|$|The {{arrangement}} of Matt Dennis's Everything <b>Happens</b> <b>To</b> <b>Me</b> (June Christy, vocal) {{was not done}} under Kenton's aegis but with Christy's later to be husband Bob Cooper as the leader just after the second AFM recording ban. This {{is added to the}} CD and shows the continuity of Graettinger's writing and recorded works for Capitol; the chart had originally been done for the full Kenton instrumentation but was never recorded. The small 11 piece group (to include violin and cello) provides some real insight to the inner workings of Graettinger's writing. The aesture nature of his arrangement and use of pantonality (one might call it atonality in spots) makes one wonder how June Christy is able to pick off the 9th of the F minor chord {{at the top of the}} tune; there is basically no clue given by Graettinger as to what pitch is coming for the singer (the glue that holds this together is the Bb pedal point at the bottom). Interestingly, after first stating the entire tune there is a tutti ensemble section that gives way to the 'last 'A' of the form'. Also, his harmonic transitions between sections are key in their departure from the tune compared to the established harmony while June Christy sings.|$|E
500|$|I mean, don't you {{sometimes}} stop and go, don't you feel hyper aware {{of who you}} are in the moment? And then think, 'God, I'm me inhabiting my flesh and bones, saying my words, breathing the air that I breathe but you're also outside of it and thinking, 'But why? Why am I me? Why... why... what is my place here?' [...] Well, that <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> all the time.|$|E
500|$|Robinson's Hollywood exploits, however, did not {{sit well}} with Dodgers {{co-owner}} Walter O'Malley, who referred to Robinson as [...] "Rickey's prima donna". In late 1950, Rickey's contract as the Dodgers' team President expired. Weary of constant disagreements with O'Malley, and with no hope of being re-appointed as President of the Dodgers, Rickey cashed out his one-quarter financial interest in the team, leaving O'Malley in full control of the franchise. Rickey shortly thereafter became general manager of the Pittsburgh Pirates. Robinson was disappointed at the turn of events and wrote a sympathetic letter to Rickey, whom he considered a father figure, stating, [...] "Regardless of what <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> in the future, it all can be placed on what you have done and, believe me, I appreciate it." ...|$|E

[...] He noted, [...] "I don't really want to play professional football, because there is no privacy and no time to be alone when you're a famous athlete." [...] He emphasized that, if he were ever forced to choose between professional football or studying for the ministry, he would give up football: [...] "I see no reason why I can't do both, but if I have to give up pro ball, I'll certainly do it." [...] Timberlake said the thing he would always remember about playing football was the 20 minutes before kickoff. [...] He recalled that those 20 minutes were [...] "horrible." [...] "You want to go home. [...] You want to quit football. [...] It is times like these when something <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> [...] I can't explain it. [...] I put my face in my hands and ask God to come into my heart and give me courage. He gives me peace." ...|$|E

Before {{he left to}} join the Thirty Years War, he discussed a possible regency {{with members of the}} government and admitted to them that his wife was [...] "a miserable woman". Even so, Gustavus Adolphus could not bring himself to nominate a regency council in which her name did not appear. To Axel Oxenstierna, he confessed: [...] "If anything <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> my family will merit your pity , the mother lacking in common sense, the daughter a minor - hopeless, if they rule, and dangerous, if others come to rule over them." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kitt {{later became}} a vocal {{advocate}} for LGBT rights and publicly supported same-sex marriage, which she considered a civil right. She had been quoted as saying: [...] "I support it [...] because we're asking for the same thing. If I have a partner and something <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> I want that partner to enjoy the benefits {{of what we have}} reaped together. It's a civil-rights thing, isn't it?" [...] Kitt famously appeared at many LGBT fundraisers, including a mega event in Baltimore, Maryland, with George Burns and Jimmy James. Scott Sherman, an agent at Atlantic Entertainment Group, stated: [...] "Eartha Kitt is fantastic... appears at so many LGBT events in support of civil rights." ...|$|E

Still good, and then last lap my car shuts off with a battery failure or whatever. It’s annoying." [...] He was also disappointed over losing the possibility of finishing on the podium, but said it was continually satisfying to compete {{at the front of the}} pack but it felt more satisfying to be the first driver to finish the race: [...] "I don’t know why this always <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> so many times. It’s just really annoying because in the end people forget what happened." ...|$|E

2500|$|There are {{conflicting}} {{accounts of}} Diogenes' death. He is alleged variously to have held his breath; {{to have become}} ill from eating raw octopus; or to have suffered an infected dog bite. When asked how he wished to be buried, he left instructions to be thrown outside the city wall so wild animals could feast on his body. When asked if he minded this, he said, [...] "Not at all, {{as long as you}} provide me with a stick to chase the creatures away!" [...] When asked how he could use the stick since he would lack awareness, he replied [...] "If I lack awareness, then why should I care what <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> when I am dead?" [...] At the end, Diogenes made fun of people's excessive concern with the [...] "proper" [...] treatment of the dead. The Corinthians erected to his memory a pillar on which rested a dog of Parian marble.|$|E
