These theoretical treatments lend themselves to descriptions of signals as digital phenomena they are much less convenient for dealing with descriptions of signals as analogue phenomena. Although attempts were made to accommodate analogue and digital signals in the same theory the results were elaborate, hard to follow and difficult to apply. Thus there remain incompatibilities between the common theoretical treatments of analogue and digital signals and hence difficulties in framing criteria for the comparison of analogue and digital techniques. In spite of the difficulty of any formalised comparison it is frequently presumed that digital systems offer greater capacity, better quality, better accuracy, versatility, <b>freedom</b> <b>from</b> <b>error</b> and greater realism in the effects they produce.

40|$|Despite the {{consensus}} that waste efficient design {{is important for}} reducing waste generated by construction and demolition activities, design strategies for actual waste mitigation remain unclear. In addition, decisive roles required of designers in designing out waste remains inadequately addressed. As such, this study aims to map out attributes of waste effective design and design documents. Drawing on series of semi-structured focus group discussions with experts from the UK leading design and construction companies, this paper employs qualitative approach to explore design and design document qualities for waste efficient construction projects. The study suggests that for a design to assist in reducing construction and demolition waste, it needs to fulfil five key requisites, while its documentation is expected to fulfil four key requisites. A waste efficient design would incorporate standardization and dimensional coordination, employ principles in modern methods of construction, provides measures for spatial and components flexibility, make provisions for end of life deconstruction and employs techniques in BIM for design coordination. Waste efficient design documentation, on the other hand, is characterised by completeness and clarity, certainty and timeliness, <b>freedom</b> <b>from</b> <b>error,</b> and incorporation of set of plans and schedules that are waste militating. A validation of these findings in {{a case study of}} waste-to-energy project confirmed that the strategies are essential to preventing construction waste. Measures through which design and design documents could achieve the identified waste effective attributes are highlighted and discussed. Findings of this study could assist in understanding a set of measures that should be taken at project planning and design stages in order to mitigate waste intensiveness of the construction industry.

40|$|Rational approximations to real {{numbers have}} been used from ancient times, either for {{convenience}} in computation, or {{due to lack of}} more precise knowledge of the magnitude of the numbers. Better approximations may be obtained by making corrections in the form of adding aliquots, adjusting numerators, or adjusting denominators. The latter method, when extended, leads to our modern notion of continued fractions. The classical theory of continued fractions began during the Renaissance when Arabic numerals and the modern fractional notation had become common. It was studied and extended until {{about the end of the}} nineteenth century. This theory is concerned with terminating or non-terminating continued fractions whose elements are integers. The classical theory is essentially complete, being used mainly as a tool in other investigations, chiefly the solution of Diophantine equations. Advances are announced from time to time in special areas of the field. The equivalence of continued fractions to infinite products and to series expansions was recognised early in their study. Series expansions proved most convenient at that time, the other two forms being relatively neglected until more powerful computing aids were developed. Modern function theory regards the elements of a continued fraction as variables or as functions of variables. This analytic theory of continued fractions resulted from developments in the evaluation of integral functions, polynomial interpolation, rational functions and similar problems. This study has developed rapidly during the past sixty years and much research continues to be done. The development during the past decade of programmed electronic digital computers having great speed and <b>freedom</b> <b>from</b> <b>error</b> has stimulated the development of new numerical methods and a reexamination of old methods of computation for computer use. In particular the ability of the digital computer to iterate a series of operations ("loop") has stimulated the search for algorithms that may be used to evaluate functions. One such algorithm is the continued fraction. It is the purpose of this thesis to examine the method of evaluating functions as continued fractions with a view to its adaptability to computer operations...|$|E
40|$|The {{harmonization}} {{of international}} accounting standards has been implemented by more than 120 countries throughout the world. Although these standards have been criticised for disregarding local values and accounting systems, the IFRS and IAS provide many more benefits including enhancing the quality and transparency of financial statements. Unlike previous standards, the revised IFASS 16 – 2007 offers two options, the cost or revaluation models for fixed asset measurement. Therefore, conflict of interests may arise due to these options. The cost model favours reliability of its value (completeness, neutrality and <b>freedom</b> <b>from</b> <b>error</b> characteristics) while the revaluation model provides relevant information (predictive value and confirmatory value characteristics) to the public. This study first proposed a conceptual model that can help Indonesian CFOs in deciding to revalue or not to revalue fixed assets using decision support criteria such as motives, effects, primary decision criteria, business outcomes and impacts. The research then applied stratified random sampling for data gathering over the period of 2008 - 2012. Three categories were used such as companies’ age (young, middle, and old), size (small, medium, and large), and nine IDX industry classifications. A deterministic model was then developed using nine variables which were broken down into 17 proxies. The natural logarithm scenario provided the highest prediction power The R 2 of - 2 Log likelihood, Nagelkerke, and Cox Snell were 57. 69, 56. 4, and 75. 2 per cent consecutively. These scenarios also found the most significant variables among other scenarios with six proxies such as CMS, fixed asset intensity, DER, operating income, DER level, and export sales. Based on those significant proxies, this study concluded that companies’ internal benefits from asset revaluation decision making were more dominant than for external benefits. The internal benefits include four proxies (FAI, CMS, DER, and operating income) from three motives such as to gain efficiency/economics, to reduce debt contracting costs, and to reduce political costs. The external benefits include two proxies (DER level and export sales) from motives such as to provide signals for stakeholders; and to reduce information asymmetry. The results found that as of 31 st December 2012, only 2. 83 per cent of the total 460 Indonesian PLCs applied revaluation model. This figure cited is lower than other countries who have applied IAS 16 earlier than Indonesia such as South Korea, New Zealand, and England and Wales. The research confirms that Indonesian PLCs are cautious in applying the revaluation model because historically, previous IFASS 16 – 1994 only allowed PLCs to apply the cost model only. Furthermore, the revaluation model incurs more costs paid such as for the appraisal fees, auditor fees, and tax agency costs. Furthermore, the having more PLCs applied the revaluation model, external parties such as investors, creditors and consumer. They will enjoy a lower company’s business risk. This circumstance can reduce their expected return and decrease the product and service prices...|$|E
40|$|Abundances of zirconium, hafnium, cadmium, antimony, tantalum, gold, platinum, and iridium {{have been}} {{determined}} in meteorites, tektites, deep-sea sediments, and various terrestrial materials {{by use of}} neutron activation analysis. Among the principal advantages of the method are its high sensitivity and <b>freedom</b> <b>from</b> <b>errors</b> due to reagent and laboratory contamination. These data have considerable significance {{in the fields of}} geochemistry and cosmochemistry. Each of these elements, except platinum, is separated after irradiation from the sample matrices by use of carriers and specific radiochemical separation techniques. Gold and platinum are determined simultaneously by separating and counting only gold. This is possible due to the decay of the irradiation- produced Pt/sup 199 / to its radioactive daughter, Au/sup 199 /. Gamma-ray scintillation spectrometry allows selective counting of the Au/sup 199 / produced from the irradiation of gold and the Au /sup 199 / produced indirectly from the irradiation of platinum in the samples. All abundances are computed by comparison of gamma-ray counting rates of the extracted samples with the counting rates of standard samples of each element irradiated simultaneously. Certain of the abundance data for chondritic meteorites as determined in this work, including zirconium at 34 ppm, gold at 0. 22 ppm, iridium at 0. 49 ppm, and tantalum at 0. 02 ppm, are in good agreement with the relatively few previous determinations found in the literature. However, other abundances, such as hafnium at 0. 19 ppm in chondrites, are substantially different from previously reported data. The significance of these data as related to theories of meteorite formation and nucleosynthesis in the stars is briefly discussed. (auth...|$|R

The method is limited to certain programming styles: it assumes the use of recursive programming techniques, and process interaction in synchronous data-flow style. The thesis explores these styles for soft real-time embedded programming - a field in which prevention of run-time crashes is an issue, and in which type-based crash-prevention techniques would complement the traditional techniques of the field, i. e., formal methods and testing. The thesis contributes with two experimental language designs that each presents a strengthening of Milner and Damas's type-system: one higher-order, functional language with lazy semantics and implicit storage management, and in which well-typed programs dot not busy-loop, nor deadlock; one first-order, functional language with strict semantics and explicit storage management, and in which well-typed programs do not run out of stack-space, nor heap-space. It contributes with two semantic theories that are used to prove the correctness of the stronger type systems: one denotational theory in which crashing programs are viewed as `bottom', in which types excluding this value can be expressed, and in which recursive functions can be shown to be total mappings on such types by fix-point induction; one operational theory, in which a typed abstract machine is used to show that well-typed programs do not get stuck along a chain of reductions, and that a machine-configuration's stack and store never exceed bounds stated in its type.

The two core categories of human security are often held to be complementary to each other. However, by applying a human security analysis to the War on Drugs in Bolivia, particularly {{with reference to the}} ideas of <b>freedom</b> <b>from</b> fear and <b>freedom</b> <b>from</b> want, {{it can be seen that}} the War on Drugs in Bolivia typifies a <b>freedom</b> <b>from</b> fear approach. This is illustrated through the War on Drugs focus on protecting individuals from physical violence and human rights abuses relating to situations of conflict, as well as its use of coercion strategies, such as sanctions or non-unilateral force; all of these of which are usual to a <b>freedom</b> <b>from</b> fear approach. An examination of how the War on Drugs has impacted upon the individuals of Bolivia reveals that despite the desired outcome of protecting individual safety and well-being, the War on Drugs has actually compromised the safety and well-being of Bolivians. In addition, in typifying <b>freedom</b> <b>from</b> fear, the War on Drugs in Bolivia has also challenged <b>freedom</b> <b>from</b> want by marginalising or threatening economic, community, food and health security, and thus defying claims that <b>freedom</b> <b>from</b> fear and <b>freedom</b> <b>from</b> want are complementary.
