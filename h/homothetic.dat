5|$|Several other {{geometrical}} {{solutions to}} Apollonius' problem {{were developed in}} the 19th century. The most notable solutions are those of Jean-Victor Poncelet (1811) and of Joseph Diaz Gergonne (1814). Whereas Poncelet's proof relies on <b>homothetic</b> centers of circles {{and the power of}} a point theorem, Gergonne's method exploits the conjugate relation between lines and their poles in a circle. Methods using circle inversion were pioneered by Julius Petersen in 1879; one example is the annular solution method of HSM Coxeter. Another approach uses Lie sphere geometry, which was developed by Sophus Lie.|$|E
5|$|In summary, {{the desired}} line L1 {{is defined by}} two points: the radical center G of the three given circles and the pole in C1 {{of one of the}} four lines {{connecting}} the <b>homothetic</b> centers. Finding the same pole in C2 and C3 gives L2 and L3, respectively; thus, all six points can be located, from which one pair of solution circles can be found. Repeating this procedure for the remaining three homothetic-center lines yields six more solutions, giving eight solutions in all. However, if a line L'k does not intersect its circle C'k for some k, there is no pair of solutions for that homothetic-center line.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} approach, the given circles are shrunk or swelled (appropriately to their tangency) until one given circle is shrunk {{to a point}} P. In that case, Apollonius' problem degenerates to the CCP , which {{is the problem of}} finding a {{solution}} circle tangent to the two remaining given circles that passes through the point P. Inversion in a circle centered on P transforms the two given circles into new circles, and the solution circle into a line. Therefore, the transformed solution is a line that is tangent to the two transformed given circles. There are four such solution lines, which may be constructed from the external and internal <b>homothetic</b> centers of the two circles. Re-inversion in P and undoing the resizing transforms such a solution line into the desired solution circle of the original Apollonius problem. All eight general solutions can be obtained by shrinking and swelling the circles according to the differing internal and external tangencies of each solution; however, different given circles may be shrunk to a point for different solutions.|$|E
