Once the game was under way it took just 1:50 before the Crunch's Jon Mirasty and the Senators' Jeremy Yablonski engaged in the first fight in Outdoor Classic history. Mirasty had {{previously}} stated that he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>involved</b> in the first outdoor fight. The physical play continued and minutes later at the 3:29 mark Paul Baier and Mike Radja were given matching roughing minor penalties.

Picard became the first player to score in an Outdoor Classic when he beat Senators' goaltender Mike Brodeur putting the Crunch up 1–0. The score remained the same {{at the end of a}} penalty-filled first period. Eight total penalties were called on the two clubs through the first 20 minutes of the game.|$|E
500|$|For {{the naked}} scenes, Spears cleared the set, leaving only Kahn, Blackburn and Rushing {{with her to}} shoot the sequence. Spears also shot scenes {{in which she had}} to dance through a hallway of {{imaginary}} lasers in front of a green screen, something that Kahn deemed as [...] "incredible to watch". The last few scenes of the video in which Spears murders her boyfriend, concerned Kahn, who thought they would be censored. He explained [...] "the trick was to make it look pop at the same time" [...] and told Henderson [...] "'Would you like to be kissed by Britney Spears?'". According to Kahn, the hint of a smile that appears on Henderson's face before Spears pours the poison into his mouth was what managed to get the shot past censors. Although Spears was at first <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>involved</b> in the editing process with Blackburn, she did not contact Kahn after the media scandal over her wedding in Las Vegas.

Lennertz said, the music is [...] "always done from a sense of being sort of in control and savvy and clever, rather than just being strong or just having a superpower or sort of being so much further along than anybody else physically. Part of it was just trying to make it that she's just smarter than everybody else.

40|$|Thesis (Master) [...] İzmir Institute of Technology, Mechanical Engineering, İzmir, 2006 Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves: 88 - 90) Text in English; Abstract: Turkish and Englishxvi, 158 leavesDokuz Eylül Research and Application Hospital, {{founded in}} 1982, {{is located in}} İnciraltı Place, in Balçova. It is placed at the south of İzmir and between the İzmir-Çeşme Highway and İzmir-Çeşme Super Highway. Rather rich geothermal resources found in Balçova, provides the use of geothermal water for heating in the hospital. However, the required cooling capacity for the hospital, which is relatively massive {{when compared with the}} residents, has been supplied by conventional compression chillers. In this study, the aim <b>is</b> <b>to</b> decrease the overall annual costs incurred by cooling of the hospital by implementing an absorption cooling system, which uses geothermal fluid as the heating source. The main idea behind this implementation is that the electricity consumption of an absorption chiller is minimal when compared with a compression chiller. On the other hand, since the source that <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> used in the system is geothermal energy, there will be an additional cost incurred by the use of geothermal fluid. So, the economic analysis that <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> conducted <b>involves</b> the comparison of two alternatives, which are leaving the system as is now and implementing an absorption cooling system. To minimize the costs incurred by the implementation of an absorption cooling system, instead of supplying the full capacity of the hospital, a moderate capacity will be supplied by the absorption chillers, by using the existing compression chillers as the peaking units. Since it is not known which capacity will be suitable for the needs, several absorption cooling machines with various capacities will be examined. After comparing these mutually exclusive alternatives, the effect of the change in geothermal fluid price on the implementation of an absorption cooling system, and the break-even geothermal water price will be found. At the end, the investment worth values of the selected absorption cooling machines will <b>be</b> examined <b>to</b> decide whether to implement an absorption cooling system in the hospital or not...|$|R
40|$|Forestry {{for farmers}} CUE: In Zambia, many forest {{areas have been}} managed by the state Forestry Department {{for as much as}} forty or fifty years, yet during this time they have never had proper {{management}} plans. As a result, forestry officers have not had clear guidelines for how the natural resources of the forest <b>are</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> exploited. How many poles can be removed? How much timber for construction? How much bark for making rope? There have also <b>been</b> no plans <b>to</b> guide how much forest land should be cleared for farming. Cecilia Polansky is a Forest Advisor for the Co-operative League of the United States, an organisation which is supporting community-based natural resources management in Zambia?s Eastern Province. She has <b>been</b> working <b>to</b> improve co-operation between the government Forestry Department and the local communities, so that together they can write plans for how the forest can be managed for the long-term future. Chris Kakunta asked Cecilia about the project, and what it has achieved so far. IN:		?Well so far we started? OUT:		? cash into their households. ? DUR?N	 4 ? 49 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Cecilia Polansky, summarising the importance of community forest management. Transcript Polansky	Well so far we started in 1999, in Chiulukire local forest. That?s a forest that has got almost 11, 000 hectares in it. And at that time when we started we did some village interviews of all these villagers that live around the forest, and there are over 70 new villages that were not in existence at the time when the forest was set up. So now the Forestry Department does not have enough time to do patrols everywhere in that forest, or to properly manage the forest. So we did interviews, to find out people?s interest in managing those resources within that forest. Kakunta	So how are the communities being involved in managing this forest? Polansky	Well, after those interviews in 1999, we developed a strategy of bringing some of the representatives of those communities, together in workshops, to talk about the products they get from that forest, and to write actual chapters for a management plan for that forest. So the people gave us very good ideas about the rates of use of those products, and the best ways to regenerate specific trees which are used for specific products, and we incorporated some scientific information from research in miombo ecology that has already been done, with the community?s knowledge about the same products, and how they regenerate, how much they need to use, and how much income they get from all those products in their areas. So we incorporated those into one management plan that contains one chapter for each user group, and also chapters on administrative aspects so that Forest Department can join in the book-keeping and some of the legal aspects, and the traditional hierarchy <b>is</b> also <b>involved</b> as important in announcing policies that relate to forest ecology. Kakunta	So would you <b>be</b> able <b>to</b> say that, in as far as sustainable forest management is concerned, your programme has had a great impact in achieving your objectives? Polansky	Well we like to think it has had an impact, but it is a bit early. The thing about forest management is it is very long term, and although we managed to write a very good plan for miombo forest in two years, now the implementation will also take time to measure the actual impact on the environment and on people?s attitudes towards protecting their forests better. Kakunta	So, in a nutshell, what would be some of the lessons you have learned in terms of protecting the forest? Polansky	We realised very soon that we need {{to address the problem of}} agriculture along with the problem of forest management. Because the main destruction of the forest right now does seem <b>to</b> <b>be</b> people cultivating inside the boundaries of government-managed and controlled forest. Kakunta	So are there alternative measures that you are putting, so as to enable these communities not to go into the forest, as far as agriculture is concerned? Polansky	Yes, well the main push at the beginning of the project, in the first three years, <b>was</b> <b>to</b> do extension work in conservation farming, to raise yields per hectare of crops, and as a side line, there has also <b>been</b> value-adding <b>to</b> agricultural crops. And the objective <b>is</b> <b>to</b> raise incomes enough for farmers around these forests so that they don?t need to look for so much alternative land, and new land to cultivate, but also to raise their yield per hectare, and that way they also don?t need so many hectares to cultivate for their families. Kakunta	Is there anything that you would like to put across, in as far as sustainable natural resources management, in particular forests, is concerned? Polansky	Well from the government side, I know the government needs to reaffirm its commitment to maintaining the forests that they have already, and the key <b>to</b> doing that <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>involving</b> communities surrounding those forests. And on the community side, they need to also realise that if they are too selfish about their own families? needs, and are not interesting in improving their yields per hectare, then we will have a problem with deforestation, that will make it so that eventually, they won?t even <b>be</b> able <b>to</b> get medicines out of the forest, or those economic resources that both women and men depend on to bring cash into their households. End of track. A forestry advisor for the Co-operative League of the United States describes a programme to build co-operation between the forestry services and local communities in eastern Zambia. The programme has involved stakeholder workshops to write management plans, and support for more productive agriculture...|$|R
