25|$|Analog meters {{are also}} useful where {{the trend of}} a {{measurement}} {{is more important than}} an exact value obtained at a particular moment. A change in angle or in a proportion is easier to interpret than a change in a <b>digital</b> <b>readout.</b> For this reason, digital multimeters often approximate this with a bargraph (typically with a more rapid reading response than the primary readout); the most effective of these are arranged in an arc, to simulate the pointer of an analog meter.|$|E
500|$|The genesis for [...] "Blood" [...] was Glen Morgan's own hematophobia, {{combined}} with the controversy over malathion spraying in Southern California and a note between writers Morgan and Wong that simply read [...] "Postal Workers". In addition, series creator Chris Carter had been wanting an episode of The X-Files to feature a story revolving around digital readouts. Morgan and Wong {{decided to use the}} <b>digital</b> <b>readout</b> idea, crafting a script that turned [...] "regular things," [...] like fax machines and cell phones, into something [...] "scary." [...] The 1966 shooting massacre at the University of Texas was the inspiration for the story's climax, which was only partially filmed at the University of British Columbia because firearms were not allowed on location at the actual university. A replica of its clock tower's interior was used for several key scenes. This episode marks the first time that Darin Morgan, Glen's brother, helped with a script of The X-Files with a [...] "story by" [...] credit. Darin was asked to help flesh out the episode's story. He would later contribute to the second season episode [...] "Humbug".|$|E

50|$|The {{layout and}} design of these {{instruments}} have evolved {{over the years by}} being implemented as <b>digital</b> <b>readouts</b> rather than the traditional analog dial-type indicators.

50|$|With {{the advent}} of the VFD, LED and LCD in {{consumer}} electronics, some manufacturers used instruments with <b>digital</b> <b>readouts</b> to make their cars appear more up to date, but this has faded from practice.

5000|$|Until 1990, {{cars were}} fitted with an {{instrument}} binnacle that used <b>digital</b> <b>readouts.</b> Instrumentation included a display named the [...] "Vehicle Condition Monitor" [...] (VCM), which contained a 32x32 dot-matrix screen capable of 34 functions.

[...] A $40 Heathkit oscilloscope might not be remotely comparable to a factory-built oscilloscopebut there were no $40 (or even $100) factory-built oscilloscopes.|$|R
50|$|The {{exterior}} sequences seen in {{the first}} episode were shot on Thursday 29 October 1981 at Springwell Lock Quarry, near Rickmansworth, Hertfordshire. The Cyberscope prop was built using parts the modelmaker (Martin Bower) had scavenged from the Nostromo set constructed for the movie Alien. Similarly, the <b>digital</b> <b>readouts</b> on the device flash up a random series of numbers, which were also seen on the monitors of the Nostromo set.|$|R
50|$|In an automobile, an {{electronic}} instrument cluster, digital instrument panel or digital dash for short, {{is a set}} of instrumentation, including the speedometer, that is displayed with a <b>digital</b> <b>readout</b> rather than with the traditional analog gauges.

50|$|A {{linear encoder}} is a sensor, {{transducer}} or readhead {{paired with a}} scale that encodes position. The sensor reads the scale in order to convert the encoded position into an analog or digital signal, which can then be decoded into position by a <b>digital</b> <b>readout</b> (DRO) or motion controller.|$|E

40|$|A {{new concept}} of a Charge Sensitive Amplifier without a high-value {{resistor}} in the feedback loop is presented. Basic spectroscopic parameters of the amplifier coupled to a coaxial High Purity Germanium detector (HPGe) are discussed. The amplifier signal input is realized with an n-channel J-FET transistor. The feedback capacitor is discharged continuously by the second, forward biased n-channel J-FET, driven by an RC low–pass filter. Both the analog—with a standard spectroscopy amplifier and a multi-channel analyzer—and the digital—by applying a Flash Analog to <b>Digital</b> Converter—signal <b>readouts</b> were tested. The achieved resolution in the analog and the <b>digital</b> <b>readouts</b> was 0. 17 % and 0. 21 %, respectively, at the Full Width at Half Maximum of the registered 60 Co 1332. 5 keV gamma line...|$|R
50|$|Electronic {{instrument}} clusters are being increasingly common features on railway vehicles, in which individual instruments {{are replaced by}} various forms of <b>digital</b> <b>readouts.</b> Early uses of {{instrument clusters}} often employed LEDs to display analog-type or numeric readings for pressure gauges, electrical gauges, and other displays. They have been increasingly integrated with various cab signalling systems and together with the installation of multi-function displays, have simplified the cab layout and improved user interaction with the engineer.|$|R
25|$|Radio Caroline {{announced}} a wavelength of 199 metres, rhyming with the name, but was actually broadcasting on 197.3 metres (1520kHz). Stations in the UK announced the wavelength in metres, and radios {{at that time}} were tuned using an analogue dial. The absence of precise <b>digital</b> <b>readouts</b> allowed for some leeway between the precise transmission frequency and the channel announced on the air. The Dutch offshore station Radio Veronica was on 192 metres (1562kHz) and Radio Atlanta broadcast on 201 (1493kHz).|$|R
50|$|The new Royal line sold well, but Zenith's {{lead was}} {{steadily}} eroded. By {{the time of}} the release of the 'R7000' in 1979, fierce competition from Sony in Japan - who, with their <b>digital</b> <b>readout</b> tuning dial had, in many ways, a superior product - meant the end of a famous product line.|$|E
50|$|Fully {{automatic}} polarimeters are {{now available}} and simply require the user to press a button and wait for a <b>digital</b> <b>readout.</b> Fast automatic digital polarimeters yield an accurate result within a second, regardless of the rotation angle of the sample. In addition, they provide continuous measurement, facilitating High-performance liquid chromatography and other kinetic investigations.|$|E
5000|$|The 1980 FT-101ZD type {{with the}} WARC amateur bands added (first ZD models {{did not have}} WARC bands), was the same {{transceiver}} but with <b>digital</b> <b>readout</b> and with selectable AM or FM print standard included.

40|$|Many {{previous}} studies of both behavioral and physiological correlates of cognitive workload have burdened subjects with a contrived secondary task {{in order to assess}} the workload of a primary task. The present study investigated event-related potential (ERP) indices of workload in a single task paradigm. Subjects monitored changing <b>digital</b> <b>readouts</b> for values that went 'out-of-bounds'. The amplitude of a long-latency positivity in the ERPs elicited by readout changes increased with the number of readouts being monitored. This effect of workload on ERPs is reported, along with plans for additional analyses to address theoretical implications...|$|R
50|$|In 1974, cars 4650-4659 and 4760-4769 {{were sent}} to Garrett AiResearch's {{facilities}} in Los Angeles, California to test out Flywheel Energy Storage System equipment. The even-numbered cars received energy conservation machinery with batteries and amber-type <b>digital</b> <b>readouts</b> indicating {{the amount of energy}} used by the equipment, while the odd-numbered cars remained untouched. These cars were later tested at the UMTA, and the USDOT Testing Facilities in Pueblo, Colorado for evaluation, and were returned to the MTA in 1976 for in-service testing on all BMT/IND Lines to check the effectiveness of the technology.|$|R
