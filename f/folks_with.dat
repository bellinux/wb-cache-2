500|$|As Obama {{lived in}} Hyde Park, a more {{affluent}} neighborhood {{with a higher}} percentage of White voters {{than the rest of the}} district, the narrative of the race became [...] "the Black Panther against the professor" [...] Obama frequently came off as uptight. Rush criticized Obama: [...] "Barack Obama went to Harvard and became an educated fool. We’re not impressed with these <b>folks</b> <b>with</b> these Eastern elite degrees. Barack is a person who read about the civil-rights protests and thinks he knows all about it." [...] Trotter said, [...] "Barack is viewed in part to be the white man in blackface in our community." [...] Though the Chicago Tribune endorsed Obama, many, including local officials, President Bill Clinton, and Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic Party nominee for President, endorsed Rush.|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{criticism}} towards Moore's Boston accent in the series, executive producer Robert Carlock, {{who is from}} Boston, defended Moore. In an interview with New York magazine, Carlock said, [...] "I grew up with people like that. Not everyone talks like that in Boston, but I think she's enough of an actress to pull it off." [...] When asked if her accent [...] "sounded realistic", he noted, [...] "I'm {{going to go with}} that. I know people who sound like that." [...] In response to the accent, Moore explained [...] "I went to school in Boston and worked with a lot of guys from Dorchester, so that's where [...] came from. We made it thick... for humor's sake, but then again, not really. There are <b>folks</b> <b>with</b> seriously heavy accents there, and they are proud of it." ...|$|E
500|$|Black Lives Matter {{incorporates}} those traditionally on {{the margins}} of black freedom movements. The organization's website, for instance, states that Black Lives Matter is [...] "a unique contribution that goes beyond extrajudicial killings of Black people by police and vigilantes" [...] and, embracing intersectionality, that [...] "Black Lives Matter affirms the lives of Black queer and trans folks, disabled folks, black-undocumented folks, <b>folks</b> <b>with</b> records, women and all Black lives along the gender spectrum." [...] All three founders of the Black Lives Matter movement are women, and Garza and Cullors identify as queer. Additionally, Elle Hearns, one of the founding organizers of the global network, is a transgender woman. The founders believe that their backgrounds have paved the way for Black Lives Matter to be an intersectional movement. Several hashtags such as #BlackWomenMatter, #BlackGirlsMatter, #BlackQueerLivesMatter, and #BlackTransLivesMatter have surfaced on the BLM website and throughout social media networks. Marcia Chatelain, associate professor of history at Georgetown University, has praised BLM for allowing [...] "young, queer women [...] play a central role" [...] in the movement.|$|E

2500|$|The {{idea for}} the first FSP has been {{credited}} to various people, most notably U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Henry Wallace and the program's first administrator, Milo Perkins. Of the program, Perkins said, [...] "We got {{a picture of a}} gorge, with farm surpluses on one cliff and under-nourished city <b>folks</b> <b>with</b> outstretched hands on the other. We set out to find a practical way to build a bridge across that chasm." [...] The program operated by permitting people on relief to buy orange stamps equal to their normal food expenditures; for every US$1 worth of orange stamps purchased, fifty cents' worth of blue stamps were received. Orange stamps could be used to buy any food; blue stamps could be used only to buy food determined by the Department to be surplus.|$|E
2500|$|The {{film was}} {{saved by the}} {{financial}} intervention of prominent black Americans, some of whom appear in the film: Bill Cosby, Oprah Winfrey, Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson, Janet Jackson, Prince, and Peggy Cooper Cafritz, founder of the Duke Ellington School of the Arts. [...] Their contributions were made as donations; as Lee noted: [...] "This is not a loan. They are not investing in the film. These are black <b>folks</b> <b>with</b> some money {{who came to the}} rescue of the movie. As a result, this film will be my version. Not the bond company's version, not Warner Brothers'. I will do the film the way it ought to be, and it will be over three hours." [...] The actions of such prominent members of the African American community giving their money helped finish the project as Lee envisioned it.|$|E

2500|$|He has likened his {{position}} to [...] "Ted Williams's batting coach," [...] because of Obama's celebrated abilities as a speaker and writer. Obama senior adviser David Axelrod said of Favreau, [...] "Barack trusts him...And Barack doesn't trust too many <b>folks</b> <b>with</b> that—the notion of surrendering that much authority {{over his own}} words." [...] In Obama's own words, Favreau is his [...] "mind reader." [...] He and Obama share a fierce sports rivalry, between the Boston Red Sox, favored by Favreau, and the Chicago White Sox, favored by Obama. When the White Sox defeated the Red Sox 3–0 in the 2005 American League playoffs, Obama swept off Favreau's desk with a small broom. During the campaigns, he was obsessed with election tracking polls, jokingly referring to them as his [...] "daily crack." [...] At points during the campaign, he was said to feel overwhelmed by his responsibilities, and would turn to David Axelrod, and his friends for advice.|$|E

When Bush came to the Pittsburgh area on Labor Day 2002, 65-year-old retired steel worker Bill Neel was there to greet him with a sign proclaiming, 'The Bush family must surely love the poor, they made so many of us.' The local police, at the Secret Service's behest, set up a 'designated free-speech zone' on a baseball field surrounded by a chain-link fence {{a third of a}} mile from the location of Bush's speech. The police cleared the path of the motorcade of all critical signs, though <b>folks</b> <b>with</b> pro-Bush signs were permitted to line the president's path.
