50|$|The {{legislative}} {{organ of}} the territory is the Legislative Assembly, a 29-member body comprising twelve directly elected members, ten indirectly elected members representing functional constituencies and seven members appointed by the chief executive. The Legislative Assembly is responsible for general lawmaking, including taxation, {{the passing of the}} budget and socioeconomic legislation. Terms are for four years, with annual sessions running from 15 October to 16 August. There are several standing committees in the assembly that perform the following functions: examination and issuance of reports and statements on projects and proposals of law, on resolutions and deliberations, and on proposals of alteration presented to the Legislative Assembly; <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> <b>petitions</b> submitted to the Legislative Assembly; voting on issues as approved in general by the Legislative Assembly General Meeting; and answering questions raised by the president or the General Meeting.|$|E
5000|$|Çavuş, also anglicized Chaush and Chiaus (from çavuş, [...] "messenger") was an Ottoman title {{used for}} two {{separate}} soldier professions, both acting as messengers although differing in levels. It was a rank below agha and kethüda in units {{such as the}} Janissaries and Sipahi, and was also a term {{for members of the}} specialized unit of çavuşān (also çavuşiyye, çavuş(an)-i divan(i)) consisting of combined cavalry and infantry serving the Imperial Council (as in Ottoman Egypt). The leaders of the council's çavuş were titled çavuşbaşı (or başçavuş). The çavuşbaşı was an assistant (or deputy) to the Grand Vizier, dealing with security matters, accompanying ambassadors visiting the Grand Vizier, and also carried out the first <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> <b>petitions</b> submitted to the Council, and led council meetings when the Grand Vizier was not present. The title has its origin in Uyghur use, where it was the title of ambassadors, and then entered Seljuq use for Byzantine imperial messengers, and Persian and Arabic use for various court attendants.|$|E

40|$|This article expands our {{understanding}} of state-society interactions in rural Algeria under French colonial rule, focusing specifically on villagers in the eastern department of Constantine. I analyze previously untapped administrative records, newspapers, petitions, and complaints to show how sanitary regulations and medical expertise came to shape relationships among villagers, local elites, and the colonial state from the early twentieth century. Villagers responded to state-led medicalization by seeking the protection of medical doctors, not only from disease {{but also from the}} state itself. In particular, they hoped to avoid heavy-handed treatment by qaids and local elites who applied emergency disease control measures without appropriate medical knowledge. Furthermore, close <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> <b>petition</b> literature suggests that hardships experienced by rural communities during the First World War accentuated nascent feelings of entitlement towards state medical treatment that crossed demographic, ethnic, and religious communal boundaries...|$|R
40|$|This {{overview}} {{highlights the}} jurisprudence for the calendar year 2008 of internationallegal norms for the accountability {{of human rights}} violations involving criminal justice systems. The jurisprudence for the three major sources of legal norms for international human rights is highlighted. 1 The international treaty that has global reach is the Interna-tional Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). To monitor compliance, the ICCPR established the UN Human Rights Committee (HRC), which under the First Optional Pro-tocol may examine individual petitions. The European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) was established by the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fun-damental Freedoms (ECHR) {{with the task of}} monitoring compliance with this treaty through the <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> individual <b>petitions.</b> The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IAC) receives, analyzes, and investigates individual petitions that allege human rights violations of the American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man and the American Convention on Human Rights. These human rights documents share a similar language in the specific guarantees affecting criminal justice systems. In this review, the criminal justice-related cases decided by the ECtHR derive from the 1, 881 judgments delivered in 2008. Of these, the ECtHR listed 78 cases available in Eng...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} an {{attempt was made}} to examine the period 1965 - 1975, in Australia, in terms of the {{symbolic}} politics of social change in certain fields of "protest", viz the anti-Vietnam movements, women's movements, environmental movements, Aboriginal movements, "permissiveness" movements and (to a lesser extent) "ethnic consciousness" movements. There was a concern with both the instrumental and the expressive functions of these forms of protest. Particular reliance was placed on some of the concepts developed by Kenneth Burke, Hugh Dalziel Duncan, Orrin. E. Klapp, Murray Edelman, James Combs and Michael Mansfield. These concepts were used in an <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> pamphlets, <b>petitions,</b> editorials, letters to the editor of newspapers and magazines, books, badges, stickers, posters and contemporary accounts of the activities pursued by the movements referred to. This resulted in a classification of various forms of protest action. Within each of these classifications there was <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> both instrumental and expressive elements - and also with paradoxes of unintended consequences. The protest forms were seen to be capable of developing a "life" of their own. One of the main conclusions reached has been concerned with the need, on occasion, to use symbolic forms of protest/challenge in order to place new items on the agenda, or to re-define existing agenda items. However, the very theatricality of the techniques used not only attracts attention and gives reassurance to followers: it can also produce unintended consequences. The study of the theatricalities of agenda - changing merits closer attention by political scientists than it has traditionally received. There is a need to develop new methods of analysis...|$|R
30|$|In {{this paper}} {{we focus on}} the Cabinet Office UK {{petition}} website and the one in the US. In previous work [13] we analyzed data from the first UK website, finding that the number <b>of</b> signatures a <b>petition</b> received on its first day was pivotal to its ultimate success. The low threshold for success (500 signatures) and the coarse daily resolution of data on growth for the earlier site did not allow for an in-depth <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> the critical early moments <b>of</b> <b>petitions.</b> We note that the previous study of the No.  10 petition site found that the category <b>of</b> a <b>petition</b> or the day of week it was launched did not {{play a significant role in}} explaining the number <b>of</b> signatures a <b>petition</b> received [13]. In this paper, we undertake a new in-depth investigation of the early growth <b>of</b> <b>petitions</b> aided by the higher threshold for success on the new platform (100, 000 vs 500 signatures) and a finer-grained capture <b>of</b> <b>petition</b> growth (hourly vs. daily resolution). Analysis of the second UK platform also allows us to compare its dynamics with those of the earlier platform, which we do throughout our analysis where possible, to find properties <b>of</b> <b>petition</b> growth that transcend any specific web platform.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the 'Long Parliament' of 1406 {{as an example}} of politics and legislation in England during the early fifteenth century. It is based {{on a wide range of}} government sources, including manuscripts from the Public Record Office and the British Library, chronicles, printed chancery rolls and literary works. The idea behind this thesis is to shed light both on some aspects of Henry IV's rule and on the significance of the English parliament during the later middle ages. It also takes into account England's relations with France and its other neighbours in Henry IV's reign. As will be seen, these had a more significant effect on the course of the 1406 parliament than has previously been realized. They also influenced one of the most famous legislative acts of the 1406 parliament, the act for the inheritance of the throne. The thesis begins with an introduction analysing the main events of Henry IV's early years and the most important issues raised in his early parliaments (1399 to 1404). Without this analysis, the significance of the 1406 parliament cannot be understood. The first section of the thesis then discusses the backgrounds, political affiliations and connections of the members of the 1406 parliament and the factors that might have influenced their attitudes. The second part of the thesis establishes the chronology of the parliament and {{examines the}} main issues debated during its course. The third part of the thesis is directed towards an <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> the <b>petitions</b> and the <b>petitioning</b> process, and <b>of</b> the legislation enacted by this parliament. This section is largely based on the class <b>of</b> Ancient <b>Petitions</b> (SC 8) in the Public Record Office, London, which is the major primary source for unenrolled parliamentary petitions. Fifty-four additional private petitions submitted to/or during the parliament of 1406 have been discovered, and these are used to analyse the process <b>of</b> parliamentary <b>petitioning.</b> The final chapter discusses the consequences and aftermath of the 1406 parliament, to see the extent to which Henry's concessions in 1406 were implemented during the first ten months of 1407, and why the king was able to resume power during the Gloucester parliament of October 1407...|$|R
