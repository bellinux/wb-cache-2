In his will he bequeathed the funds to complete the construction of the synagogue. The construction was continued by his brother, Moses. It was spent about 200 000 rubles in total for the whole construction. The consecration of Kenasa held on January 27, 1902 by Tauride and Odessa hakham Samuel Pampulov.

Carson’s thesis is that an authentic free market economy would not be capitalism as the separation of labor from ownership and the subordination of labor to capital would be impossible, bringing a class-less society where people could easily choose between working as a freelancer, working for a fair wage, taking part of a cooperative, or being an entrepreneur. He notes, as did Tucker before him, that a mutualist free market system would involve significantly different property rights than capitalism is based on, particularly in terms of land and intellectual property.|$|E
5000|$|The lynch-pin to Brownlee's [...] "native policy" [...] and {{the primary}} reason for its {{relative}} success, was the legal recognition given to traditional Xhosa systems of land tenure, and the cutting of <b>discriminatory</b> <b>taxation</b> on this land. This gave protection from dispossession and abuse by white settlers, and removed one of the key grievances of the Xhosa. The policy of the government at the time was to recognise and respect the authority of the traditional Chiefs over their rural subjects, but that when Xhosa people urbanised or moved out of the tribal areas they became subject to the Cape's overall laws. Although this was intended as a compromise between forceful assimilation {{on the one hand and}} segregation on the other, it was also seen as gradually undermining the authority of traditional chiefs.|$|E
5000|$|Brown v. Maryland, 25 U.S. (12 Wheat.) 419 (1827), was a {{significant}} United States Supreme Court case which interpreted the Import-Export and Commerce Clauses of the U.S. Constitution to prohibit <b>discriminatory</b> <b>taxation</b> by states against imported items after importation, rather than only {{at the time of}} importation. The state of Maryland passed a law requiring importers of foreign goods to obtain a license for selling their products. Brown was charged under this law and appealed. It was the first case in which the U.S. Supreme Court construed the Import-Export Clause. Chief Justice John Marshall delivered the opinion of the court, ruling that Maryland's statute violated the import-export and commerce clauses and the federal law was supreme. He alleged that the power of a state to tax goods did not apply if they remained in their [...] "original package". A license tax on the importer was essentially the same as a tax on an import itself. Despite arguing the case for Maryland, future chief justice Roger Taney admitted that the case was correctly decided.|$|E
500|$|The Fasci {{were the}} result of the revolt of the Sicilian peasants against the {{introduction}} of capitalist relationships into the rural economy aggravated by the world depression in agriculture of the 1880s. [...] The agrarian crisis between 1888 and 1892 led to a steep decrease in wheat prices. The island’s main sources of wealth – wine, fruit and sulphur – suffered a heavy blow. The dominant landowning class channeled most of the economic burden on to the peasantry, in the form of higher rents and <b>discriminatory</b> local <b>taxation.</b> As social tension rose, a handful of young and hitherto quite unknown socialist intellectuals – many of them recent graduates of Palermo University – seized their opportunity. The movement grew under the first government of Prime minister Francesco Crispi (1887-1891) and coincided with unpopular tax increases and ratification of a series of laws curtailing personal freedom. The Italian economy had been sliding into a deep recession since the late 1880s. New protective tariffs had been introduced in 1887 on agricultural and industrial goods, followed by a trade war with France, which badly damaged Italian commerce and affecting Italy’s agricultural exports, the only potentially dynamic economic sector of southern Italy. Many farmers suffered severely.|$|R

The German public has been highly sensitive to environmental concerns, leading to many policy initiatives in this area since the early 1980 s. Significant environmental improvements have been achieved, using an approach frequently based on detailed regulations, often developed with the close involvement of industry and even individual polluters. There has developed a tendency to relieve some of the heaviest polluters from the most stringent regulation, {{on the grounds of}} competitiveness concerns, and some polluting activities receive considerable direct or indirect subsidies; these policies will increasingly make it unnecessarily expensive to meet environmental targets.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to assess the impact of {{presumptive}} business taxation on the choice of organizational form. Presumptions are simplified methods to determine the tax base for small non-corporate firms and represent reliefs from accounting for tax. Our findings suggest that <b>discriminatory</b> presumptive business <b>taxation</b> indeed affects the choice of organizational form and that the effects strongly depend on the design of presumptions. The more extensive the simplifications in the determination of the tax base and the less restrictive the eligibility criteria of the presumption, the smaller is the corporate share of business in the economy. Quantitatively, we find that a presumptive tax regime, which in terms of scope of eligibility and degree of departure from book-keeping obligations corresponds to the average presumption in Europe, is associated with a decrease in the corporate employment share by 3. 6 percentage points and in the corporate firm share by 1. 2 percentage points. However, the attractiveness of departures from book-keeping obligations decreases in the simplicity of the “ordinary” tax regime. Besides compliance costs, potential tax savings seem to play a role as well...|$|R

Part I concludes by considering the constitutionality {{of a variety of}} state tax incentives within our suggested framework and also under alternative approaches that courts might utilize. Part II examines the restraints that the Commerce Clause imposes on state subsidies. It begin with a consideration of the Court 2 ̆ 7 s seminal case in this field, West Lynn Creamery, Inc. v. Healy. After demonstrating that West Lynn Creamery does not jeopardize ordinary business subsidies, Part II considers the constitutionality of subsidies along two dimensions. First, it looks at subsidies in terms of their intended beneficiaries, focusing on whether it matters for Commerce Clause purposes that the subsidy targets a particular firm rather than a general class of businesses. Second, it evaluates whether the particular form the subsidy takes [...] for example, a cash grant, a property transfer, or a user fee waiver [...] alters the constitutional calculus in applying the dormant commerce clause. Part II concludes that neither the target nor the form of the subsidy ordinarily makes a difference. Rather, discriminatory subsidies, unlike discriminatory tax breaks, are almost always constitutional. In Part III, we consider the theoretical underpinnings of the strong tax-break/subsidy distinction that permeates this field. We suggest that this distinction resonates with the law 2 ̆ 7 s deep regard for considerations of form. We observer, in particular, that the distinction may grow out of the same 2 ̆ 2 cautionary function 2 ̆ 2 that helps explain many rules that require use of specified formal structures to achieve legally enforceable results in the private-law context...|$|R

40|$|The states 2 ̆ 7 {{provision}} of tax incentives {{designed to encourage}} economic development within their borders {{has long been a}} feature of the American legislative landscape. Today every state provides tax incentives as an inducement to local industrial location and expansion. Indeed, scarcely a day goes by without some state offering yet another tax incentive to spur economic development, often in an effort to attract a particular enterprise to the state. The debate over the efficacy and wisdom of state tax and other business incentives is intense and important, as other articles in this Symposium plainly reveal. My purpose here, however, is not to enter this fray. Instead, it is to consider the central legal question that state tax incentives raise under the dormant Commerce Clause of the Federal Constitution: How is a constitutionally benign tax incentive designed to attract industry to a state to be distinguished from an unconstitutionally discriminatory tax incentive designed to do the same thing? This question reflects a palpable tension in the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s Commerce Clause opinions. The Court has declared that its decisions 2 ̆ 2 do not prevent the States from structuring their tax systems to encourage the growth and development of intrastate commerce and industry. 2 ̆ 2 The Court, however, has disapproved state tax measures designed to achieve that very objective on the ground that they 2 ̆ 2 foreclose[] tax-neutral decisions 2 ̆ 2 and “provid[e] a direct commercial advantage to local business. 2 ̆ 22 ̆ 7 This Article explores the ill-defined distinction between the constitutional carrot and the unconstitutional stick in state tax cases.
