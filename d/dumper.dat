40|$|Waiting line {{problems}} arise {{because there is}} too much demand on the facilities so that we can say that there is an excess of waiting time or inadequate number of service facilities. At the stone crusher plant mine the <b>dumpers</b> come to load from the loader. The crusher plant has 11 <b>dumpers</b> and these 11 <b>dumpers</b> make 88 trips during 8 -hour day. The company has one loader to load all the <b>dumpers,</b> which results in a formation of long waiting line or queue. Due to this queue there is a long waiting time in queue of <b>dumpers</b> and cost associated with waiting time of <b>dumpers.</b> Queuing theory can quite effectively analyze such queuing phenomenon. In this research paper I have applied the queuing theory to the stone crusher plant mine, where the queue of <b>dumpers</b> formed at the loading station. By applying the single channel queuing theory I analyzed the current situation of the stone crusher plant mine and find the problems of the current system. To overcome the above problems I have applied the multi-channel queuing theory to minimize the waiting time in queue of <b>dumpers</b> and very high cost associated with waiting time of <b>dumpers.</b> In the new system not only waiting time in queue of <b>dumpers</b> and very high cost associated with waiting time of <b>dumpers</b> is reduced but also there is an efficient utilization of <b>dumpers</b> and loaders along with provide the profitable situation to the crusher plant...|$|R

40|$|A {{comparative}} {{analysis of the}} known systems of technical reliability of heavy <b>dumpers</b> functionality has been made. It has been stated that the previously proposed methods to determine the optimal service life of heavy-duty <b>dumpers</b> are not effective enough and do {{not take into account}} the whole range of factors specific to the operation of heavy <b>dumpers</b> in the current economic realities of industrial enterprises.

40|$|The paper {{develops}} {{a model for}} the deployment of optimized quantity of <b>dumpers</b> in a synchronized operation between hot mix asphalt plant production, transportation of hot mix asphalt and laying at pavement construction site. The queuing theory has been applied in arriving at the formula for calculation of quantity of <b>dumpers.</b> The results obtained have been validated by applying it to a runway construction project. The formula can prove to be quite handy in day to day planning for the site engineers and it can become an effective tool in eliminating the wastages. Also a relationship has been developed between plant production, the capacity of <b>dumpers</b> and the capacity of the laying site to handle the number of <b>dumpers</b> and time spent by <b>dumpers</b> at laying site. The relationship so developed can be useful in the selection of right type and capacity of Hot Mix Ashphalt (HMA) plant, Paver Finishers and <b>Dumpers...</b>|$|R

50|$|A Helix <b>Dumper</b> is a rail {{transport}} and unloading solution, designed for continuous rolling discharge of bulk commodities. Originally {{developed for the}} iron ore industry, the Helix <b>Dumper</b> system can handle many types of fine-grained and potentially sticky commodities.When the Helix <b>Dumper</b> wagon enters the unloading area, a wheel {{at the top of}} the wagon makes contact with the spiral-shaped rigid guide that constitutes the unloading station. As the wheel travels along the path of the guide, the wagon chassis remains on the rails while the body of the wagon is rotated 148 degrees to dump its load. After the rotation, the direction of the guide changes and the wagon body is returned to its normal position. The Helix <b>Dumper</b> has a discharge rate of up to 25,000 tonnes per hour.|$|E
