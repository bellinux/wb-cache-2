40|$|In {{fiscal year}} 1998, the Navy missed its {{recruiting}} goal by about 7, 000 {{people and the}} Army fell short by 800. The Delayed Entry Program (DEP) allows new recruits to delay their entry into active military service; and, when individuals already recruited {{drop out of the}} DEP, the manpower planning process becomes even more difficult. <b>High</b> <b>school</b> <b>seniors</b> account for a relatively large proportion of individuals who leave the DEP. The primary purpose of this research was to identify factors that explain why <b>high</b> <b>school</b> <b>seniors</b> drop out of the DEP in such large numbers. Multivariate data analysis was used on archival data files from the Defense Manpower Data Center for fiscal years 1990 through 1996 to identify factors that explain the high attrition rate of <b>high</b> <b>school</b> <b>seniors.</b> A data set from Commander, Navy Recruiting Command was also used to conduct multivariate analysis. Additionally, descriptive data analysis examined <b>high</b> <b>school</b> <b>seniors</b> who left the DEP by their race, gender, service, and other characteristics. The results show that <b>high</b> <b>school</b> <b>seniors</b> who are older, female, and in the lower enlistment test categories have a comparatively high probability of dropping out of the DEP. Recommendations are offered for further research in this area. U. S. Navy (U. S. N.) author...|$|R
