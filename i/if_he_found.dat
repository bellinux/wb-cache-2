According to El Manik, who played a Japanese soldier in Budak Nafsu, Sjumandjaja refused to listen to El Manik's concern that a Japanese man {{would not be able}} to speak Indonesian fluently, instead telling the actor to write Japanese dialog himself if he wanted. Gandasubrata recalled that Sjumandjaja fired his own father-in-law from Jakarta Opera when the latter could not perform to the director's expectations. According to producer Manoo Sukmajaya, Sjumandjaja would refuse to accept a directing offer <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>found</b> the script uninteresting, valuing creative worth over the director's fee.|$|E
5|$|When news of Giorgio's arrest {{arrived in}} Venice, the Great Council decided to replace both him and Venier. The first two choices for replacement, Jacopo Trevisan and Fantino Michiel, refused, but in May 1424, Bernardo Loredan was named duke (governor) of the city, with Jacopo Dandolo as captain (military commander), for a two-year term. In the meantime, Venier was {{instructed}} to secure the release of Giorgio, as well as recognition from the Sultan of Venetian control over Thessalonica, the surrounding villages, and the fort of Kortiach (Mount Chortiatis). In exchange, he was to offer an annual tribute of 1,000 to 2,000 ducats, as well as distribute annuities to the Sultan's chief courtiers. The same instructions were also given to the new captain-general of the fleet, Pietro Loredan, who sailed for Thessalonica. <b>If</b> <b>he</b> <b>found</b> the city under siege, Loredan was to attack Gallipoli—where he had scored a major victory in 1416—hinder the passage of Ottoman troops over the Dardanelles, and if practicable, to try and stir up opposition to the Sultan among neighbouring rulers. To emphasize the fact that Venice did not wish for a war, Loredan {{was instructed to}} inform the local Turkish commanders that his actions were only {{as a consequence of}} the imprisonment of Giorgio and the siege of Thessalonica, which they had acquired legally.|$|E

25|$|The main feud {{heading into}} SummerSlam on the Raw brand was between Hulk Hogan and Shawn Michaels. A feud between Michaels, and Muhammad Hassan and Daivari {{began on the}} April 4 episode of Raw, when Hassan and Daivari {{attacked}} Michaels. Michaels demanded a match against the two, but he would only be given one <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>found</b> a partner. Hogan eventually became Michaels' partner, and they defeated Hassan and Daivari at Backlash. Hogan did not appear again until the July 4 episode of Raw in Carlito's talk show segment. Carlito, along with Kurt Angle, made comments about Hogan's daughter and eventually attacked him. Michaels came out to help Hogan, and they defeated Carlito and Angle in a match later that night. After the match, Michaels performed a superkick on Hogan and left. The following week, Michaels challenged Hogan to a match at SummerSlam, which Hogan later accepted.|$|E

The build-up to Hogan's Hall of Fame induction and preparation for his WrestleMania angle was shown on the first season of Hogan Knows Best. The next night on Raw, Hassan and Daivari came out to confront and assault fan favorite Shawn Michaels. The following week on Raw, Michaels approached Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff demanding a handicap match with Hassan and Daivari. Bischoff refused, but told Michaels <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>found</b> a partner he would be granted a tag team match. Michaels then made a plea for Hogan to team with him. On the April 18 episode of Raw, Hassan again led an attack on Michaels until Hogan appeared, saving Michaels and accepting his offer. At Backlash, Hassan and Daivari lost to Hogan and Michaels.|$|E

25|$|Taksin took {{important}} {{steps to}} show that he was a worthy successor to the throne. He was said to take an appropriate treatment to the remnants of the ex-Royal Family, arranged a grand cremation of the remains of Ekatat, and tackled the problem of locating the capital. Possibly, Taksin realized that Ayutthaya city had suffered such vast destruction that to restore it to its former state would undoubtedly have strained his resources. The Burmese were quite familiar with the various routes leading to Ayutthaya, and in the event of renewal of a Burmese attack on it, the troops under the liberator would be inadequate for the effective defence of the city. With these considerations in mind, he established his capital at Thonburi, nearer to the sea than Ayutthaya. Not only would Thon Buri be difficult to invade by land, it would also prevent an acquisition of weapons and military supplies by anyone ambitious enough to establish himself as an independent prince further up the Chao Phraya River. As Thonburi was a small town, Prince Tak's available forces, both soldiers and sailors, could man its fortifications, and <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>found</b> it impossible to hold it against an enemy's attack, he could embark the troops and beat a retreat to Chantaburi.|$|E

500|$|When Gore {{graduated}} in 1969, his student deferment ended and he immediately became {{eligible for the}} military draft. His father, a vocal anti–Vietnam War critic, was facing a reelection in 1970. Gore eventually decided {{that the best way}} he could contribute to the anti-war effort was to enlist in the Army, which would improve his father's reelection prospects. Although nearly all of his Harvard classmates avoided the draft and service in Vietnam, Gore believed <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>found</b> a way around military service, he would be handing an issue to his father's Republican opponent. According to Gore's Senate biography, [...] "He appeared in uniform in his father's campaign commercials, one of which ended with his father advising: 'Son, always love your country'." [...] Despite this, Gore Sr. lost the election.|$|E
500|$|General Lee also {{understood}} the defensive potential to the Union army if {{they held the}} high ground of Cemetery Hill. He sent orders to Ewell to [...] "carry the hill occupied by the enemy, <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>found</b> it practicable, but to avoid a general engagement until {{the arrival of the}} other divisions of the army." [...] In the face of this discretionary, and possibly contradictory, order, Ewell chose not to attempt the assault. One reason posited was the battle fatigue of his men in the late afternoon, although [...] "Allegheny" [...] Johnson's division of Ewell's Corps was within an hour of arriving on the battlefield. Another was the difficulty of assaulting the hill through the narrow corridors afforded by the streets of Gettysburg immediately to the north. Ewell requested assistance from A.P. Hill, but that general felt his corps was too depleted from the day's battle and General Lee did not want to bring up Maj. Gen. Richard H. Anderson's division from the reserve. Ewell did consider taking Culp's Hill, which would have made the Union position on Cemetery Hill untenable. However, Jubal Early opposed the idea when it was reported that Union troops (probably Slocum's XII Corps) were approaching on the York Pike, and he sent the brigades of John B. Gordon and Brig. Gen. William [...] "Extra Billy" [...] Smith to block that perceived threat; Early urged waiting for Johnson's division to take the hill. After Johnson's division arrived via the Chambersburg Pike, it maneuvered toward the east of town in preparation to take the hill, but a small reconnaissance party sent in advance encountered a picket line of the 7th Indiana Infantry, which opened fire and captured a Confederate officer and soldier. The remainder of the Confederates fled and attempts to seize Culp's Hill on July 1 came to an end.|$|E
500|$|The Audiencia of Charcas {{took up the}} {{investigation}} of Reyes. [...] The Audencias, the judicial system of colonial Spain, had a wide degree of latitude and independence from the viceroy. [...] Charcas (now known as Sucre) was quite distant from the viceregal capital of Lima, amplifying the court's power even further. [...] In 1721, the audiencia sent judge José de Antequera y Castro to Asunción to dispense justice as he saw fit. [...] Antequera was a young rising star of the court, and even his fiercest critics wrote that he was likable, handsome, intelligent, and unusually well-educated for the time. [...] The Audiencia gave Antequera a sealed document to open <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>found</b> Reyes guilty. [...] The Audiencia and Antequera ordered Reyes to release the council members he had imprisoned and that he not interfere in {{the investigation}} in any way. [...] After interviewing the witnesses accusing Reyes of misdeeds, Antequera concluded that the evidence was so strong as to warrant the immediate arrest of Reyes in September 1721. [...] Antequera presented to the cabildo the sealed document he'd been given by the Audiencia. [...] The document gave Antequera the position of governor, which {{he took over the}} objections of Reyes' remaining supporters. [...] In April 1722, Antequera officially found Reyes guilty and dismissed him as governor, although Reyes immediately escaped Asunción on the same day the sentence was handed down. [...] Antequera proceeded to impound much of Reyes' property and also order the arrest of many of Reyes' friends and supporters, taking their property to be sold at public auction as well. [...] With all these actions, Antequera earned the support and adulation {{of the majority of the}} province, though he was hated by those who had done well under Reyes. [...] Antequera clinched his popularity by taking a stand against the hated Jesuits; he endorsed settlers' demands that the mission Indians be distributed to the encomienda, that secular (paid by the Spanish government) priests be put in charge of the Jesuit missions, and that a customs house be established to enforce limits on Jesuit exports of yerba mate. [...] To historian James Saeger, Antequera comes across as mostly well-meaning; he sincerely believed imposing the civil authority upon the independent Jesuit missions would benefit the Empire.|$|E
