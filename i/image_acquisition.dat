25|$|Two {{forms of}} {{radiographic}} images are {{in use in}} medical imaging. Projection radiography and fluoroscopy, with the latter being useful for catheter guidance. These 2D techniques are still in wide use despite the advance of 3D tomography due to the low cost, high resolution, and depending on application, lower radiation dosages. This imaging modality utilizes a wide beam of x rays for <b>image</b> <b>acquisition</b> and is the first imaging technique available in modern medicine.|$|E

40|$|Because of its superb {{temporal}} resolution, echo planar imaging (EPI) {{is widely}} used for {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and monitoring dynamic processes. EPI suffers from geometric distortions caused by magnetic field inhomogeneities, and although these distortions can be corrected by field mapping, current methods require lengthy auxiliary <b>image</b> <b>acquisitions</b> and/or phase unwrapping. We present a 3 -point method for field mapping that circumvents these problems and is robust to additive noise.

25|$|While the {{practicality}} of CBCT fosters its increasing {{application in}} IR, technical limitations hinder its {{integration into the}} field. The two most significant factors that affect successful integration are image quality and time (for set up, <b>image</b> <b>acquisition,</b> and image reconstruction). Compared to MDCT, the wider collimation in CBCT leads to increased scatter radiation and degradation of image quality as demonstrated by artifacts and decreased contrast-to-noise ratio. The temporal resolution of cesium iodide detectors in CBCT slows data acquisition time to approximately 5 to 20 seconds, which increases motion artifact. The time required for image reconstruction takes longer for CBCT (1 minute) compared to MDCT (real time) due to the computationally demanding cone beam reconstruction algorithms.|$|E
25|$|On September 14, 2000, Microsoft {{released}} Windows ME (Millennium Edition), {{the last}} DOS-based version of Windows.

However, Windows ME was faced with criticism for its speed and instability, along with hardware compatibility issues and its removal of real mode DOS support.

40|$|AbstractObjective:To {{assess the}} {{reduction}} of estimated radiation dose in abdominal computed tomography following the implementation of new scan protocols {{on the basis of}} clinical suspicion and of adjusted <b>images</b> <b>acquisition</b> parameters. Materials and Methods:Retrospective and prospective review of reports on radiation dose from abdominal CT scans performed three months before (group A – 551 studies) and three months after (group B – 788 studies) implementation of new scan protocols proposed as a function of clinical indications. Also, the <b>images</b> <b>acquisition</b> parameters were adjusted to reduce the radiation dose at each scan phase. The groups were compared for mean number of acquisition phases, mean CTDIvol per phase, mean DLP per phase, and mean DLP per scan. Results:A significant reduction was observed for group B as regards all the analyzed aspects, as follows: 33. 9 %, 25. 0 %, 27. 0 % and 52. 5 %, respectively for number of acquisition phases, CTDIvol per phase, DLP per phase and DLP per scan (p < 0. 001). Conclusion:The rational use of abdominal computed tomography scan phases based on the clinical suspicion in conjunction with the adjusted <b>images</b> <b>acquisition</b> parameters allows for a 50 % reduction in the radiation dose from abdominal computed tomography scans...|$|R

2500|$|The Illumina dye {{sequencing}} {{method is}} based on reversible dye-terminators and was developed in 1996 at the Geneva Biomedical Research Institute, by Pascal Mayer and Laurent Farinelli. In this method, DNA molecules and primers are first attached on a slide and amplified with polymerase so that local clonal colonies, initially coined [...] "DNA colonies", are formed. To determine the sequence, four types of reversible terminator bases (RT-bases) are added and non-incorporated nucleotides are washed away. Unlike pyrosequencing, the DNA chains are extended one nucleotide {{at a time and}} <b>image</b> <b>acquisition</b> can be performed at a delayed moment, allowing for very large arrays of DNA colonies to be captured by sequential images taken from a single camera. Decoupling the enzymatic reaction and the image capture allows for optimal throughput and theoretically unlimited sequencing capacity; with an optimal configuration, the ultimate throughput of the instrument depends only on the A/D conversion rate of the camera. The camera takes images of the fluorescently labeled nucleotides, then the dye along with the terminal 3' blocker is chemically removed from the DNA, allowing the next cycle.|$|E
