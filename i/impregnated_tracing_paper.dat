50|$|<b>Tracing</b> <b>paper</b> {{is named}} as such {{for its ability}} for an image to be traced onto it. When <b>tracing</b> <b>paper</b> is placed onto a picture, the picture is easily {{viewable}} through the <b>tracing</b> <b>paper.</b> Thus, it becomes easy to find edges in the picture and trace the image onto the <b>tracing</b> <b>paper.</b> Pure cellulose fiber is translucent, {{and it is the}} air trapped between fibers, that makes paper opaque and looks white. If the fibers are refined and beaten until all the air is taken out, then the resulting sheet will be translucent. Translucent papers are dense and contain up to 10% moisture at 50% humidity. This type of paper is roughly 25% lighter than regular paper.|$|R

50|$|The {{majority}} of modern-day home sewing patterns contain multiple sizes in one pattern. Once a pattern {{is removed from}} a package, you can either cut the pattern based on the size you will be making or you can preserve the pattern by tracing it. The pattern is traced onto fabric using one of several methods. In one method, <b>tracing</b> <b>paper</b> with transferable ink on one side is placed between the pattern and the fabric. A tracing wheel is moved over the pattern outlines, transferring the markings onto the fabric with ink that is removable by erasing or washing. In another method, <b>tracing</b> <b>paper</b> is laid directly over a purchased pattern, and the pieces are traced. The pieces are cut, then the <b>tracing</b> <b>paper</b> is pinned and/or basted to the fabric. The fabric can then be cut to match the outlines on the <b>tracing</b> <b>paper.</b> Vintage patterns may come with small holes pre-punched into the pattern paper. These are for creating tailor's tacks, a type of basting where thread is sewn into the fabric in short lengths {{to serve as a}} guideline for cutting and assembling fabric pieces.|$|R

The map was drawn at twice final map scale, and photographically reduced to produce the five film positives for printing. This was a simple process that required very few specialist tools.

40|$|Abstract — We {{proposed}} and experimentally demonstrated a cost-efficient and easy-to-fabricate flexible thin-film {{nanocrystal quantum dot}} (NCQD) photodetector, by sandwiching a piece of NCQD-soaked <b>tracing</b> <b>paper</b> between two PEDOT:PSS elec-trodes. The highly conductive and transparent multilayer poly-mer electrodes are printed with an office inkjet printer without further patterning on commercial unmodified transparency films. The <b>tracing</b> <b>paper</b> is able to act as both the bed for NCQD attachment and the interspacing layer to prevent short-circuiting in vertical devices. Consistent increase in device performance is observed when the bending radius becomes smaller. Linear I–V characteristics are obtained, which show our device structure works as a photoconductor.

50|$|For {{traditional}} media (such as paint), {{the division}} between layout and comp is more clear-cut than for computer-generated art. For traditional media, the distinction between layout and comp is typically one of refinement and presentation. Layouts and comps are often done on different substrates because of this (e.g., <b>tracing</b> <b>paper</b> for a layout vs. calendered bond paper or illustration board for a comp). In this case, a layout done on <b>tracing</b> <b>paper</b> could be laid over other media (e.g., a photo) {{to see how it}} would eventually appear after finish render, and to ascertain overall feasibility, and the comp could be done on opaque bond paper or illustration board as a presentation piece for a client's approval.|$|R

5000|$|To {{understand}} why the calotype process could sometimes produce attractive results but {{was found to be}} generally unsatisfactory, {{it would be useful to}} compare pictures of the same subject taken with first paper and then with glass (or clear plastic film) as the negative substrate. An easier way to gain insight into the destructive effect of low contrast spurious texture is to view a relatively large format (not 35 mm) photographic negative in contact with a piece of <b>tracing</b> <b>paper</b> by transmitted light. [...] Positives can be made with a digital camera and digital image processing so that the two cases, with and without the <b>tracing</b> <b>paper,</b> can be compared side by side. Viewed from a distance, the image made through the <b>tracing</b> <b>paper</b> may seem satisfactory. But from closer up, the paper texture will appear more intrusive and begin to camouflage low contrast scene details. This comparison will also demonstrate that paper texture is relatively coarse and, unlike pixelation in a typical digital image, does not quickly become inconspicuous as the distance from which it is viewed increases. [...] Here it is significant to note that the scale of mottling in paper correlates to the average fiber length, which is on the order of millimeters, rather than to the much smaller fiber width.|$|R

40|$|Museums, libraries, and {{archives}} contain large {{collections of}} pigment-coated and <b>tracing</b> <b>papers.</b> These papers {{are produced by}} specially formulated compositions and manufacturing procedures that make them particularly vulnerable to damage as well as reactive to solvents used in conservation treatments. In order to evaluate the effects of solvents on such papers, several research projects were designed to consider the variables of paper composition, properties, and aging, as well as type of solvent and technique of solvent application. This paper summarizes findings for materials characterization, degradative effects of aging, and some effects of solvents used for stain reduction, and humidification and flattening, of pigment-coated and modern <b>tracing</b> <b>papers.</b> Pigment-coated papers have been used, virtually {{since the beginning of}} papermaking history, for their special properties of gloss and brightness. These properties, however, may render coated papers more susceptible to certain types of damage (surface marring, embedded grime, and stains) and more reactive to certai...|$|R
