In places where a steady wind blows, a ridge may allow virtually unlimited time aloft, although records for duration are no longer recognized because of the danger of exhaustion.|$|E
5|$|A {{saprobic}} species, Lycoperdon perlatum grows solitarily, scattered, or {{in groups}} or clusters on the ground. <b>It</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> grow in fairy rings.

5|$|Carnaby's black {{cockatoo}} flies with deep, slow wingbeats, {{giving it}} a wavelike movement. <b>It</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> glide for extended periods with its wings held downwards. Flocks generally fly at height, descending to treetops to feed or roost. Birds can be agile, manoeuvring quickly if startled or disturbed. In contrast, they waddle awkwardly on the ground.|$|E
5|$|However some {{research}} shows that black carbon will increase global warming, being second only to CO2. They believe that soot will absorb solar energy and transport it to other {{areas such as the}} Himalayas where glacial melting occurs. <b>It</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> darken Arctic ice reducing reflectivity and increasing absorption of solar radiation.|$|E

5|$|In 2001, the Federative Committee on Anatomical Terminology {{accepted}} female prostate as {{an accurate}} {{term for the}} Skene's gland, which {{is believed to be}} found in the G-spot area along the walls of the urethra. The male prostate is biologically homologous to the Skene's gland; it has been unofficially called the male G-spot because <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> be used as an erogenous zone.|$|E
5|$|In Europe, Amanita ceciliae is {{widespread}} everywhere, though infrequently encountered. It often inhabits deciduous forests with hornbeam (Carpinus), oak (Quercus), beech (Fagus) and birch (Betula), but <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> rarely occur with conifers: pine (Pinus), fir (Abies), spruce (Picea) and cedar (Cedrus).

5|$|Iron(III) {{chloride}} finds use {{in water}} purification and sewage treatment, in the dyeing of cloth, as a coloring agent in paints, as an additive in animal feed, and as an etchant for copper {{in the manufacture of}} printed circuit boards. <b>It</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> be dissolved in alcohol to form tincture of iron, which is used as a medicine to stop bleeding in canaries.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> be {{expressed}} as a sum of the angles between the normal vectors at consecutive pairs of inflection points. It is 2 for convex curves and larger for non-convex curves, serving {{as a measure of}} non-convexity of a curve.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> be {{produced}} by oxidising the ephedrine analogue 4-methylephedrine using potassium permanganate dissolved in sulfuric acid. Because 4-methylephedrine can be obtained in a specific enantiomeric form, mephedrone consisting of only one enantiomer can {{be produced}}. The danger associated with this method is it may cause manganese poisoning if the product is not correctly purified.|$|E
