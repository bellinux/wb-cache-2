The pH values are controlled and addition of complexing agents (to form the stable complexes with corrosion products such as chromium and iron ions) is performed with this purpose.

Geological disposal means placing the wastes hundreds of feet underground and far from the biosphere. The U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is following a legislatively well-defined regulatory process to evaluate the safety of the proposed Yucca Mountain Site to meet both the scientific requirements and the institutional requirements. Generation of electricity using nuclear energy produces wastes that require long-term isolation from the biosphere. <b>Radioactive</b> <b>wastes</b> decay over time to nonradioactive wastes; thus, safe disposal is based on isolation of <b>high-level</b> <b>radioactive</b> <b>wastes</b> until most of the radioactivity has decayed away. The U. S.

This repository houses long-lived transuranic wastes from the production of nuclear weapons and research, development, and demonstration activities; the most abundant transuranic element in these wastes is plutonium.

40|$|Assessment {{of nuclear}} {{criticality}} {{potential of the}} S-Area Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF) is required to ensure the safe processing of <b>radioactive</b> <b>waste</b> for final disposal.

This paper demonstrates that criticality poses only a negligible risk in the DWPF process because {{of the characteristics of}} the waste and the DWPF process. The waste contains low concentration of fissile material and many elements which act as neutron poisons.

5|$|Spent {{nuclear fuel}} is the {{radioactive}} by-product of electricity generation at commercial nuclear power plants, and <b>high-level</b> <b>radioactive</b> <b>waste</b> is the by-product from reprocessing spent fuel to produce fissile material for nuclear weapons. In 1982, the United States Congress established a national policy {{to solve the}} problem of nuclear waste disposal. This policy is a federal law called the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, which made the DOE responsible for finding a site, building, and operating an underground disposal facility called a geologic repository. The recommendation to use a geologic repository dates back to 1957 when the National Academy of Sciences recommended that the best means of protecting the environment and public health and safety would be to dispose of the waste in rock deep underground.|$|E
5|$|The {{process of}} {{selecting}} appropriate permanent repositories for high level waste and spent fuel {{is now under}} way in several countries with the first expected to be commissioned some time after 2017. The basic concept is to locate a large, stable geologic formation and use mining technology to excavate a tunnel, or large-bore tunnel boring machines (similar to those used to drill the Chunnel from England to France) to drill a shaft 500–1,000 meters below the surface where rooms or vaults can be excavated for disposal of <b>high-level</b> <b>radioactive</b> <b>waste.</b> The goal is to permanently isolate nuclear waste from the human environment. However, many people remain uncomfortable with the immediate stewardship cessation of this disposal system, suggesting perpetual management and monitoring would be more prudent.|$|E
