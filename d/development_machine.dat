40|$|This paper {{draws on}} {{a study of the}} {{politics}} of development planning in London’s South Bank to examine wider trends in the governance of contemporary cities. It assesses the impacts and outcomes of so-called new localist reforms and argues that we are witnessing two principal trends. First, governance processes are increasingly dominated by anti-democratic <b>development</b> <b>machines,</b> characterized by new assemblages of public- and private-sector experts. These machines reflect and reproduce a type of development politics {{in which there is a}} greater emphasis on a pragmatic realism and a politics of delivery. Second, the presence of these machines is having a significant impact on the politics of planning. Democratic engagement is not seen as the basis for new forms of localism and community control. Instead, it is presented as a potentially disruptive force that needs to be managed by a new breed of skilled private-sector consultant. The paper examines these wider shifts in urban politics before focusing on the connections between emerging <b>development</b> <b>machines</b> and local residential and business communities. It ends by highlighting some of the wider implications of change for democratic modes of engagement and nodes of resistance in urban politics...|$|R

50|$|The Doctor V64 {{unit was}} the first commercially {{available}} backup device for the Nintendo 64 unit. Though the unit was sold as a <b>development</b> <b>machine</b> it could be modified to enable the creation and use of commercial game backups.

For this reason the unit became a popular choice among those looking to proliferate unlicensed copies of games.|$|E

50|$|The Doctor V64 {{came out}} in 1996 and was priced around $450 USD.
