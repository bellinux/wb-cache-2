More recently, glial involvement {{has been shown to}} be essential for ALS-related motoneuronal death. Here, we identified an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor co-agonist, D-serine (D-Ser), as a glia-derived enhancer of <b>glutamate</b> (Glu) <b>toxicity</b> to ALS motoneurons. Cell death assay indicated that primary spinal cord neurons from ALS mice were more vulnerable to NMDA toxicity than those from control mice, in a D-Ser-dependent manner. Levels of D-Ser and its producing enzyme, serine racemase, in spinal cords of ALS mice were progressively elevated, dominantly in glia, with disease progression. In vitro, expression of serine racemase was induced not only by an extracellular pro-inflammatory factor, but also by transiently expressed G 93 A-superoxide dismutase 1 in microglial cells. Furthermore, increases of D-Ser levels were also observed in spinal cords of both familial and sporadic ALS patients. Collectively, Glu toxicity enhanced by D-Ser overproduced in glia is proposed as a novel mechanism underlying ALS motoneuronal death, and this mechanism may be regarded as a potential therapeutic target for ALS...|$|R

50|$|There {{are many}} {{mechanisms}} that exist {{to regulate the}} expression of system Xc-, {{although it is not}} the sole determinate of extracellular glutamate or intracellular glutathione. An example is amino acid deprivation, which triggers up regulation of the transporter. A key regulator is extracellular glutamate; when it becomes excessive, it goes from an excitatory transmitter to an excitotoxin. The inhibition of uptake of extracellular glutamate leads to oxidative <b>glutamate</b> <b>toxicity</b> or ferroptosis. This regulation may be done through Excitatory Amino Acid Transporters (EAATs), which decrease extracellular glutamate and increase intracellular glutamate in astrocytes. When looking at its structure, xCT seems to be the main determinant for the system's activity. Glutamate and cystine can be transported in both directions, but, generally, more cystine is imported and more glutamate is exported. Extracellular glutamate acts as a competitive inhibitor for cystine uptake via system Xc-.|$|E
40|$|In many {{acute and}} chronic {{neurologic}} disorders, both deficits in energy metabolism and defects in glutamate-mediated excitatory synaptic transmission {{have been proposed}} as important pathogenic factors. Brain cells, however, express variable vulnerability to these insults, {{as indicated by the}} fact that certain brain areas and even different cell types in the same area are preferentially spared until the very late stages of various diseases. This can be clearly seen in the striatum, where GABAergic projection cells but not cholinergic interneurons are precociously damaged in the course of both acute metabolic insults (such as hypoxia, hypoglycemia, and ischemia) and chronic neurodegenerative disorders (such as Huntington's disease). A well-mapped pattern of cell loss, in fact, is a common finding in the striatum of patients suffering from these pathologic conditions. Physiologic and molecular studies have been directed in recent years to the identification of the cellular mechanisms underlying the cell-type specific vulnerability of striatal cells. These studied recognized that, in striatal spiny and aspiny cells, specific membrane ion channels, glutamate receptor subtypes and subunits, and intracellular enzymatic activities are involved in the cascade of events responsible for opposite responses and vulnerabilities to oxygen or glucose deprivation and to <b>glutamate</b> receptor-mediated <b>toxicity.</b> Specific molecules able to target these cellular factors might be employed as therapeutic agents during acute and chronic neurologic disorders affecting this brain area...|$|R

5000|$|Binge {{drinking}} {{may induce}} brain damage {{due to the}} repeated cycle of acute intoxication followed by an acute abstinence withdrawal state. Based on animal studies, regular binge drinking in the long-term {{is thought to be}} more likely to result in brain damage than chronic (daily) alcoholism. This is due to the 4- to 5-fold increase in glutamate release in nucleus accumbens during the acute withdrawal state between binges but only in dose 3 g/kg, in 2 g/kg there is no increase in glutamate release. In contrast, during withdrawal from chronic alcoholism only a 2- to 3-fold increase in glutamate release occurs. The high levels of glutamate release causes a chain reaction in other neurotransmitter systems. The reason that chronic sustained alcoholism is thought by some researchers to be less brain damaging than binge drinking is because tolerance develops to the effects of alcohol and unlike binge drinking repeated periods of acute withdrawal does not occur, but there are also many alcoholics who typically drink in binges followed by periods of no drinking. [...] Excessive glutamate release is a known major cause of neuronal cell death. Glutamate causes neurotoxicity due to excitotoxicity and oxidative <b>glutamate</b> <b>toxicity.</b> Evidence from animal studies suggests that some people may be more genetically sensitive to the neurotoxic and brain damage associated with binge drinking regimes. Binge drinking activates microglial cells which leads to the release of inflammatory cytokines and mediators such as tumour necrosis factor, and nitric oxide causing neuroinflammation leading to neuronal destruction.|$|E
40|$|Glutamate kills {{neuronal}} cells {{by either}} a receptor-mediated pathway or the inhibition of cystine uptake, the “oxidative pathway. ” Antioxidants can block cell death initiated by either pathway, suggesting that toxicity {{is dependent on}} the production of free radicals. We provide evidence that in a neuronal cell line, <b>glutamate</b> <b>toxicity</b> via the oxidative pathway requires monoamine metabolism as a source of free radicals. <b>Glutamate</b> <b>toxicity</b> is inhibited by monoamine oxidase (MAO) type-Aspecific inhibitors, but only at concentrations much higher than those required to inhibit classical type-A MAO. Toxicity is not inhibited by MAO type-B-specific inhibitors at any concentration. Furthermore, treatment of cells with agents that block monoamine uptake inhibits <b>glutamate</b> <b>toxicity.</b> These results suggest that an enzyme distinct from MAO is involved in monoamine metabolism and demonstrate a relationship between <b>glutamate</b> <b>toxicity</b> and monoamine metabolism. These data also have implications for the understanding and treatment of neurodegenerative disorders in which <b>glutamate</b> <b>toxicity</b> is thought to be involved. Key words: glutamate toxicity; free radicals; monoamine oxidase; neuronal cells; Parkinson’s disease; hydrogen peroxide; dopamine Free radicals are postulated as mediators of an increasing number of neurodegenerative diseases (Ames and Shigenaga, 1992; Jenner, 1994); however, the pathways that lead to their production are incompletely described.

40|$|The {{chemokine}} fractalkine (CX(3) CL 1) is constitutively {{expressed by}} central neurons, regulating microglial responses including chemotaxis, activation, and toxicity. Through the activation {{of its own}} specific receptor, CX(3) CR 1, CX(3) CL 1 exerts both neuroprotection against <b>glutamate</b> (Glu) <b>toxicity</b> and neuromodulation of the glutamatergic synaptic transmission in hippocampal neurons. Using cultured hippocampal neuronal cell preparations, obtained from CX(3) CR 1 (-/-) (CX(3) CR 1 (GFP/GFP)) mice, we report that these same effects are mimicked by exposing neurons to a medium conditioned with CX(3) CL 1 -treated mouse microglial cell line BV 2 (BV 2 -st medium). Furthermore, CX(3) CL 1 -induced neuroprotection from Glu toxicity is mediated through the adenosine receptor 1 (AR(1)), being blocked by neuronal cell preparations treatment with 1, 3 -dipropyl- 8 -cyclopentylxanthine (DPCPX), a specific inhibitor of AR(1), and mimicked by both adenosine and the specific AR(1) agonist 2 -chloro-N(6) -cyclopentyladenosine. Similarly, experiments from whole-cell patch-clamped hippocampal neurons in culture, obtained from CX(3) CR 1 (+/+) mice, show that CX(3) CL 1 -induced depression of alpha-amino- 3 -hydroxy- 5 -methyl- 4 -isoxazolepropionic acid- (AMPA-) type Glu receptor-mediated current (AMPA-current), is associated with AR(1) activity being blocked by DPCPX and mimicked by adenosine. Furthermore, BV 2 -st medium induced a similar AMPA-current depression in CX(3) CR 1 (GFP/GFP) hippocampal neurons and this depression was again blocked by DPCPX. We also report that CX(3) CL 1 induced a significant release of adenosine from microglial BV 2 cells, as measured by HPLC analysis. We demonstrate that (i) CX(3) CL 1, along with AR(1), are critical players for counteracting Glu-mediated neurotoxicity {{in the brain and}} (ii) AR(1) mediates neuromodulatory action of CX(3) CL 1 on hippocampal neurons...|$|R
40|$|Cerebellar granule {{cells are}} {{susceptible}} to the excitotoxin glutamate, which acts at N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, {{as well as the}} neurotoxin 1 -methyl- 4 -phenylpyridinium ion (MPP+), the active cytotoxic metabolite of 1 -methyl- 4 -phenyl- 1, 2, 3, 6 -tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). Paradoxically, preincubation of cultured cerebellar granule cells with low concentrations of NMDA or glutamate markedly antagonizes the neurotoxicity resulting from subsequent exposure to toxic concentrations of either MPP+ or glutamate. The neuroprotective effects of NMDA and <b>glutamate</b> against MPP+ <b>toxicity</b> are observed at agonist concentrations as low as 1 microM, are blocked by specific NMDA receptor antagonists, and require at least 30 min to develop fully. Moreover, NMDA receptor-mediated neuroprotection is prevented by the RNA synthesis inhibitor actinomycin D or the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. Thus, in cerebellar granule cells activation of NMDA receptors by glutamate can result in either neurotoxicity or neuroprotection, depending on the apparent degree of receptor stimulation. NMDA receptor-mediated neuroprotection requires new RNA and protein synthesis and therefore appears to be mediated by the expression of a neuroprotective protein(s).

40|$|International audiencePURPOSE: Cell {{death is}} often {{related to an}} {{abnormal}} increase in Ca(2 +) flux. In the retina, Ca(2 +) channels are mainly from the L-type that do not inactivate with time. Under excitotoxic and ischemic conditions, their continuous activation may therefore contribute significantly to the lethal Ca(2 +) influx. To assess this hypothesis, the Ca(2 +) channel blocker, diltiazem, was applied in excitotoxic and ischemic conditions. METHODS: To induce excitotoxicity, retinal cell cultures from newborn rats were incubated with <b>glutamate.</b> The <b>toxicity</b> of <b>glutamate</b> was quantified by neuronal immunostaining with an antibody directed against the neuron specific enolase. Glutamate receptor function in vitro was assessed in pig retinal cell cultures by patch clamp recording. Retinal ischemia was induced by raising the intraocular pressure in adult rats. Retinal cell loss was quantified on retinal sections by measuring nuclear cell densities. RESULTS: In retinal cell culture, glutamate application induced a major cell loss. This cell loss was attributed to glutamate excitotoxicity because glutamate receptor blockers like MK- 801 and CNQX increased significantly neuronal survival. MK- 801 and CNQX, which block NMDA and AMPA/Kainate receptors, respectively, had additive effects. Expression of AMPA/Kainate glutamate receptors in mixed adult retinal cell cultures was attested by patch clamp recording. In newborn rat retinal culture, glutamate excitotoxicity was significantly reduced by addition of the L-type Ca(2 +) channel blocker, diltiazem. In in vivo experiments, the increase in ocular pressure induced a decrease in cell number in the inner nuclear and ganglion cell layers. When animals received diltiazem injections, the ischemic treatment induced a less severe reduction in retinal cells; this neuroprotection was statistically significant in the ganglion cell layer. CONCLUSION: These {{results are consistent with}} previous studies suggesting that Ca(2 +) channel activation contributes to retinal cell death following either glutamate excitotoxicity or retinal ischemia. Under both conditions, the L-type Ca(2 +) channel blocker, diltiazem, can limit cell death. These results extend the potential application of diltiazem in retinal neuroprotection to retinal pathologies involving glutamate excitotoxicity and ischemia...|$|R

Studies have shown that tocotrienol-rich fraction (TRF) protecting the brain against oxidative damage more efficient than α-tocopherol. The role of astrocyte in promoting neuronal survival and recovery after glutamate neurotoxicity is also increasingly appreciated. Aims: To elucidate the effects of TRF and α-tocopherol and the synergism between astrocyte and neuron against glutamate neurotoxicity. Methods: Astrocyte and neuron were subjected to glutamate injury followed by TRF and α-tocopherol treatments (100 – 300 ng/ml). Effects of TRF and α-tocopherol on nerve cell viability and glutathione contents against <b>glutamate</b> <b>toxicity</b> were examined. The synergism between astrocyte and neuron was elucidated through co-culture model. Statistical analysis was performed using one way ANOVA. Results: Both TRF and α-tocopherol improved approximately 10 % of glutamate-injured astrocyte and neuronal cell viability. In co-culture model, TRF and α-tocopherol provided nearly complete protection from <b>glutamate</b> <b>toxicity.</b> Besides, TRF and α-tocopherol treatments significantly restored at least 20 % of glutathione contents in glutamate-injured neurons.

Therefore, nutritional enhancement of endogenous antioxidant defenses may represent a viable treatment option. We investigated the neuroprotective properties of a unique whey protein supplement (Immunocal®) that provides an essential precursor (cystine) for synthesis of the endogenous antioxidant, glutathione (GSH). Primary cultures of rat cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs), NSC 34 motor neuronal cells, or HT 22 hippocampal cells were preincubated in medium containing Immunocal and then subsequently treated with agents known to induce oxidative stress. Immunocal protected CGNs against neurotoxicity induced by the Bcl- 2 inhibitor, HA 14 - 1, the nitric oxide donor, sodium nitroprusside, CuCl 2, and AlCl 3. Immunocal also significantly reduced NSC 34 cell death due to either H 2 O 2 or <b>glutamate</b> and mitigated <b>toxicity</b> in HT 22 cells overexpressing β-amyloid 1 - 42.

However, the underlying mechanism of Rd is largely unknown. Excessive extracellular <b>glutamate</b> causes excitatory <b>toxicity,</b> leading to cell death and neurodegenerative processes after brain ischemia. The clearance of extracellular glutamate by astrocytic glutamate transporter GLT- 1 is essential for neuronal survival after stroke. Here we investigated the effects of Rd on the levels of extracellular glutamate and the expression of GLT- 1 in vivo and in vitro. After rat middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), Rd significantly increased the mRNA and protein expression levels of GLT- 1, and reduced the burst of glutamate as revealed by microdialysis. Consistently, specific glutamate uptake by cultured astrocytes was elevated after Rd exposure. Furthermore, we showed that Rd increased the levels of phosphorylated protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) and phospho-ERK 1 / 2 (p-ERK 1 / 2) in astrocyte culture after oxygen-glucose deprivation(OGD). Moreover, the effect of Rd on GLT- 1 expression and glutamate uptake can be abolished by PI 3 K/AKT agonist LY 294002 or ERK 1 / 2 inhibitor PD 98059.

40|$|<b>Glutamate</b> <b>toxicity</b> {{has been}} implicated in various retinal diseases. Green tea leaf extract catechin has {{protective}} effects against cellular toxicity. This study investigated the effects of catechin on the glutamate-treated retina. Porcine retinal homogenates were incubated with glutamate (20 nmol) at 37 °C for 60 min. Catechin was co-incubated with the glutamate-treated retina in the same condition. The malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were determined as an index of lipid peroxidation (LPO). Differential protein expressions were derived from two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Mass spectrometry was conducted to identify the proteins. Glutamate increased the retinal MDA (p < 0. 0001) and catechin reversed the effect (p < 0. 0001). There were significant changes in seven proteins after the glutamate treatment (p < 0. 05), namely, heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein, thioredoxin peroxidase, 5 -hydroxytryptamine receptor, pyruvate dehydrogenase, ARHA protein, peroxiredoxin 6 and proteasome. Catechin significantly reversed the changes in thioredoxin peroxidase, 5 -hydroxytryptamine receptor, peroxiredoxin 6 and pyruvate dehydrogenase (p < 0. 05). Our study shows that (a) retinal <b>glutamate</b> <b>toxicity</b> is mediated by LPO and protein modification, and (b) catechin ameliorates the toxicity.

40|$|The present {{invention}} {{relates to}} the use of an endogenous protein of immunitary origin, fractalkine, as a neuroprotective agent against <b>glutamate</b> <b>toxicity</b> in case of acute cerebral ischemia and spinal cord lesions. The agent is useful also in neurosurgery during operations on the brain as neuroprotective agent in case of blockage of blood circulation in the localized brain region subject to surgical intervention. Neuroprotection is exerted in the interval of a few hours after the ischemic insult and thus should be considered unique in the described pathophysiological applications...|$|E
40|$|Reactive {{oxygen species}} (ROS) {{are thought to}} be {{involved}} in many forms of programmed cell death. The role of ROS in cell death caused by oxidative <b>glutamate</b> <b>toxicity</b> was studied in an immortalized mouse hippocampal cell line (HT 22). The causal relationship between ROS production and glutathione (GSH) levels, gene expression, caspase activity, and cytosolic Ca 2 + concentration was examined. An initial 5 – 10 -fold increase in ROS after glutamate addition is temporally correlated with GSH depletion. This early increase is followed by an explosive burst of ROS production to 200 – 400 -fold above control values. The source of this burst is the mitochondrial electron transport chain, while only 5 – 10 % of the maximum ROS production is caused by GSH depletion. Macromolecular synthesis inhibitors as well as Ac-YVAD-cmk, an interleukin 1 β–converting enzyme protease inhibitor, block the late burst of ROS production and protect HT 22 cells from <b>glutamate</b> <b>toxicity</b> when added early in the death program. Inhibition of intracellular Ca 2 + cycling and the influx of extracellular Ca 2 + also blocks maximum ROS production and protects the cells. The conclusion is that GSH depletion is not sufficient to cause the maximal mitochondrial ROS production, and that there is an early requirement for protease activation, changes in gene expression, and a late requirement for Ca 2 + mobilization...|$|E
40|$|Abstract [...] Astrocyte-rich and astrocyte-poor {{cultures}} {{derived from}} embryonic rat cerebral cortex {{were compared to}} determine whether differences in the location of neuronal somas, dendrites, axons, synapses or astrocytes, relative to the bulk culture medium, could help to explain the large difference in neuronal susceptibility to <b>glutamate</b> <b>toxicity</b> between the two culture systems. The cultures were processed for electron microscopy, thin sectioned across their depths, and photomontaged. In astrocyte-rich cultures, most of the dendrites, axons and synapses were sequestered from the medium by a nearly continuous layer of astrocyte cell bodies and processes. In contrast, astrocytes did not cover the synapses or neuronal processes in astrocyte-poor cultures. In neither culture system were neuronal cell somas covered by glia. Since neuronal cell somas are freely exposed to the medium in both culture conditions, {{it seems unlikely that}} receptors on the somal membrane mediate the greater susceptibility of neurons in astrocyte-poor cultures to <b>glutamate</b> <b>toxicity.</b> The layer of astrocytes in the astrocyte-rich ultures may provide a physical buffer that could hinder diffusion of substances from the medium to the interstitium of the neuropil. This physical buffer combined with avid glutamate uptake mechanisms might allow astrocytes to maintain a sufficiently low concentration of glutamate in the local extracellular space to protect dendrites and synapses in the astrocyte-rich, but not in the astrocyte-poor cultures, from the excitotoxic effects o...|$|E
