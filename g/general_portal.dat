40|$|Motivation: Despite {{substantial}} {{efforts to}} develop and populate the back-ends of biological databases, front-ends to these systems often rely on taxonomic expertise. This research applies techniques from human–computer interaction research to the biodiversity domain. Results: We developed an interactive node-link tool, TaxonTree, illustrating {{the value of a}} carefully designed interaction model, animation, and integrated searching and browsing towards retrieval of biological names and other information. Users tested the tool using a new, large integrated dataset of animal names with phylogenetic-based and classification-based tree structures. These techniques also translated well for a tool, DoubleTree, to allow comparison of trees using coupled interaction. Our approaches will be useful not only for biological data but as <b>general</b> <b>portal</b> interfaces.

40|$|The primary {{advantage}} of Virtual Observatories in scientific research is efficiency: rapid searches for {{and access to}} data in convenient forms {{makes it possible to}} explore scientific questions without spending days or weeks on ancilary tasks. The Virtual Space Physics Observatory provides a <b>general</b> <b>portal</b> to Heliophysics data for this task. Here we will illustrate the advantages of the VO approach by examining specific geomagnetically active times and tracing the activity through the Sun-Earth system. In addition to previous and additional data sources, we will demonstrate an extension of the capabilities to allow searching for model run results from the range of CCMC models. This approach allows the user to quickly compare models and observations at a qualitative level; considerably more work will be needed to develop more seamless connections to data streams and the equivalent numerical output from simulations...|$|E

Most of them have relatively a small number of visitors, while a few capture the majority of surfers. This study seeks to uncover the factors that contribute the perceived quality of a <b>general</b> <b>portal.</b> Based on 21 factors derived from an extensive literature review on Information Product Quality (IPQ), web usage, and media use, an experimental study was conducted to identify the factors that are perceived by web portal users as most relevant.

This experiment suggests a different clustering of factors: Content relevancy, Communication interactiveness, Information currency, and Instant gratification. The findings in this study will help developers find a more customer-oriented approach to developing high-traffic portals. ope...|$|E

Also, we study the prospects of finding the light scalar at the future 100 TeV pp collider, the Z and Higgs factories. With similar luminosity, the current LEP limits on the mixing between S and H can be improved by at least one or two order of magnitudes. Comment: 9 pages, 5 figure...|$|R

40|$|We {{show that}} the relaxion generically stops its rolling at a point that breaks CP leading to relaxion-Higgs mixing. This {{opens the door to}} a variety of {{observational}} probes since the possible relaxion mass spans a broad range from sub-eV to the GeV scale. We derive constraints from current experiments (fifth force, astrophysical and cosmological probes, beam dump, flavour, LEP and LHC) and present projections from future experiments such as NA 62, SHiP and PIXIE. We find that a large region of the parameter space is already under the experimental scrutiny. All the experimental constraints we derive are equally applicable for <b>general</b> Higgs <b>portal</b> models. In addition, we show that simple multiaxion (clockwork) UV completions suffer from a mild fine tuning problem, which increases with the number of sites. These results favour a cut-off scale lower than the existing theoretical bounds. Comment: 46 pages, 6 figures, v 3 : typos fixed, references added, version matches the version published in JHE...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In time, the {{integration}} needs of companies increased. Even though not taken very seriously, integration solutions in <b>general,</b> and <b>portals</b> in particular, slowly become leaders in turning new principles into practical experiences. In the beginning, portals focused on aggregating, organizing, and indexing unstructured data, but modern portals now do much more. Portal software continues to offer {{one of the}} few infrastructure frameworks that truly embrace open and flexible computing. A portal is a point of integration, useful to the organization by integrating internal business processes and by offering information to the outside world. We can use portals in decision making in two ways. One way is by enabling managers to access the data they require by using the portal's interface. Another way, which doesn't exclude the first, is by developing a distinct decision support application within the portal which uses scenarios using the data from the integrated systems to help managers make more well-founded actions...|$|R
40|$|Cirrhotic {{patients}} can develop thrombotic complications, {{which in this}} group of patients occur with a greater frequency than in the <b>general</b> population. <b>Portal</b> vein thrombosis (PVT) {{is the most common}} thrombotic phenomenon, although deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism can also occur. Risk factors for thrombosis include inherited and acquired deficiency of factors involved in anticoagulation mechanisms, venous stasis of the portal vein owing to architectural derangement of the liver and possibly local factors related to the endothelium. Clinical manifestations of PVT range from asymptomatic disease to a life-threatening complication, and although it is no longer considered an absolute contraindication for liver transplant, its presence may require challenging surgical techniques, which entail greater morbidity. Anticoagulation therapy is henceforth an important strategy to treat cirrhotic patients with PVT, although experience in this group of patients is limited. Vitamin K antagonists and low-molecular-weight heparin have been used successfully, achieving recanalization of the thrombosed vessel in patients with cirrhosis; however, the precise drug regimen management and monitoring has not be fully explored in this group of patients...|$|R
