5|$|In the 1970s, Hanna-Barbera {{produced}} an animated series called The Amazing Chan and the Chan Clan. Keye Luke, {{who had played}} Chan's son in many Chan films of the 1930s and '40s, lent his voice to Charlie, employing a much-expanded vocabulary. The series focused on Chan's children, played initially by East Asian-American child actors before being recast, due to concerns that younger viewers would not understand the accented voices. The title character bears some resemblance to the Warner Oland depiction of Charlie Chan. Leslie Kumamota voiced Chan's daughter Anne, before being replaced by <b>Jodie</b> <b>Foster.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{assassination}} attempt was especially difficult for <b>Jodie</b> <b>Foster,</b> who was hounded relentlessly {{by the media}} during 1981 because she was Hinckley's target of obsession. Since then, Foster has only commented on Hinckley on three occasions: a press conference {{a few days after}} the attack, an Esquire magazine article she wrote in 1982, and during an interview with Charlie Rose on 60 Minutes II in 1999; she has otherwise ended or canceled several interviews after the event was mentioned or if the interviewer was going to bring up Hinckley.|$|E
5|$|The film had a {{difficult}} and occasionally troubling pre-production history. When the novel was published in 1999, The Silence of the Lambs director Jonathan Demme, screenwriter Ted Tally, and actress <b>Jodie</b> <b>Foster</b> all declined {{to be involved in}} its adaptation. Ridley Scott became attached as director after the success of Gladiator (2000), and eventually signed onto the project after reading the script pitched by Dino De Laurentiis, who produced Manhunter (1986), based on the 1981 Harris novel Red Dragon. After the departure of Foster and screenwriter Tally, Julianne Moore took on Foster's role while David Mamet and Steven Zaillian wrote the screenplay.|$|E

5|$|Although Attila and The Phantom of the Opera were {{important}} breaks, {{it was only}} in 2007 that Butler gained worldwide recognition for his portrayal of King Leonidas in Zack Snyder's 2007 fantasy war film 300.

5|$|Inside Man is a 2006 American crime thriller film {{directed}} by Spike Lee, and written by Russell Gewirtz. The film centers on an elaborate bank heist on Wall Street over a 24-hour period.

Inside Man marks the fourth film collaboration between Washington and Lee.|$|E
5|$|Susie {{was created}} for the film by {{director}} and screenwriter Steve Kloves. Although Kloves was interested in casting Pfeiffer in the role from the beginning, Pfeiffer was much more hesitant to commit, citing exhaustion after having just recently completed several films at the time until Kloves ultimately convinced her to accept. Actress <b>Jodie</b> <b>Foster</b> and singer Madonna were also considered for the role, among other candidates. Having not sung on-screen since Grease 2 (1982), Pfeiffer initially had reservations about providing her character's vocals herself but ultimately underwent several months of vocal coaching in preparation to perform the film's musical numbers. Pfeiffer researched professional lounge singers in addition to drawing real-life inspiration from the performances of renowned jazz singers Sarah Vaughan, Billie Holiday and Ella Fitzgerald.|$|E
5000|$|In another {{examination}} of paranoia and feminism within the film, titled [...] "Chronic Tomboys: Feminism, Survival, and Paranoia in <b>Jodie</b> <b>Foster’s</b> Body of Work," [...] academic Lynne Stahl takes Panic Room {{as a point}} of departure from which to look holistically at <b>Jodie</b> <b>Foster's</b> career and its trenchant feminist bent. Stahl argues that Foster's aggregate body of work performs a [...] "recuperation of feminist 'paranoia'" [...] through its continual critique of heteronormativity; the tomboy trope that characterized her early roles is characterized by its finitude--conventionally, tomboyism in movies is invariably made to expire as the tomboy character capitulates her defiant attributes in favor of a traditional feminine, heterosexual trajectory. However, Stahl contends, a more enduring mode of tomboyism is posited through the dynamic the film constructs between Foster's character and her daughter, played by Kristen Stewart.|$|R
50|$|Care's {{first feature}} film was The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys, {{produced}} by <b>Jodie</b> <b>Foster's</b> Egg Pictures.

5|$|Due to erotomania, Hinckley's {{motivation}} for the attack was born of his obsession with actress <b>Jodie</b> <b>Foster.</b> While living in Hollywood in the late 1970s, he saw the film Taxi Driver at least 15 times, apparently identifying strongly with Travis Bickle, the lead character portrayed by Robert De Niro. The arc of the story involves Bickle's attempts to protect a 12-year-old child prostitute, played by Foster. Toward {{the end of the}} film, Bickle attempts to assassinate a United States Senator who is running for president. Over the following years, Hinckley trailed Foster around the country, {{going so far as to}} enroll in a writing course at Yale University in 1980 after reading in People magazine that she was a student there. He wrote numerous letters and notes to her in late 1980. He called her twice and refused to give up when she indicated that she was not interested in him.|$|E
5|$|Apart from a cameo role in {{the comedy}} The Ladies Man, Moore's only other {{appearance}} in 2000 was in a short-film adaptation of Samuel Beckett's play Not I. In early 2001, she appeared as FBI Agent Clarice Starling in Hannibal, a sequel to the Oscar winning film The Silence of the Lambs. <b>Jodie</b> <b>Foster</b> had declined to reprise the role, and director Ridley Scott eventually cast Moore, over Angelina Jolie, Cate Blanchett, Gillian Anderson, and Helen Hunt. The change in actress received considerable attention from the press, but Moore claimed she {{was not interested in}} upstaging Foster. Despite mixed reviews, Hannibal earned $58 million in its opening weekend and finished as the tenth-highest-grossing film of the year. Moore starred in three more 2001 releases: with David Duchovny in the science fiction–comedy Evolution, in her husband's dramatic film World Traveler, and with Kevin Spacey, Judi Dench, and Cate Blanchett in The Shipping News. All three films were poorly received.|$|E
