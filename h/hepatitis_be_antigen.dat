40|$|Background and aim. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and {{hepatitis}} C virus (HCV) co-infection {{is associated}} with increased risk of cirrhosis, decompensation, hepatocellular carcinoma, and death. Yet, there is sparse epidemiologic data on co-infection in the United States. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} study was to determine the prevalence and determinants of HBV co-infection in a large United States population of HCV patients. ^ Methods. The National Veterans Affairs HCV Clinical Case Registry was used to identify patients tested for HCV during 1997 – 2005. HCV exposure was defined as two positive HCV tests (antibody, RNA or genotype) or one positive test combined with an ICD- 9 code for HCV. HCV infection was defined as only a positive HCV RNA or genotype. HBV exposure was defined as a positive test for hepatitis B core antibodies, hepatitis B surface antigen, HBV DNA, <b>hepatitis</b> <b>Be</b> <b>antigen,</b> or hepatitis Be antibody. HBV infection was defined as only a positive test for hepatitis B surface antigen, HBV DNA, or <b>hepatitis</b> <b>Be</b> <b>antigen</b> within one year before or after the HCV index date. The prevalence of exposure to HBV in patients with HCV exposure and the prevalence of HBV infection in patients with HCV infection were determined. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify demographic and clinical determinants of co-infection. ^ Results. Among 168, 239 patients with HCV exposure, 58, 415 patients had HBV exposure for a prevalence of 34. 7...|$|E

The sera of statistically selected urban (805), rural (238) and institutionalized (127) black children were tested for markers of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. The age-standardized (6 - 14 years) prevalence rates of HBs antigenaemla for comparison between urban, rural and institutionalized children were 10 %, 18. 5 % and 25. 1 % and the HBV exposure rates were 31. 4 %, 62. 1 % and 72. 0 % respectively. In the newborn {{to six years}} age group the prevalence rates of HBsAg and HBV exposure were 2. 5 % and 7. 1 % for urban children and 53. 1 % and 70. 3 % for institutionalized children. Peak prevalences of HBsAg occurred in the 6 - 8 year age group and were 14. 4 % and 22. 6 % in urban and rural children respectively. <b>Hepatitis</b> <b>Be</b> <b>Antigen</b> (HBeAg) was delected in 46. 5 % and antibodies to <b>hepatitis</b> <b>Be</b> <b>antigen</b> (HBeAb) in 10. 0 % of all HBsAg positive children.

Materials and Methods: Consecutive patients of CHB were included and there HBsAg levels were measured by two methods: (i) Elecsys, Roche Diagnostics, a qualitative assay and (ii) Architect, Abbott Diagnostics, a quantitative assay. The HBV DNA was measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Results: Total of 136 patients {{were included in the}} study and there was a significant overall correlation between both the assays (correlation coefficient [r] = 0. 83; P < 0. 001). Assays correlated well with each other across all subgroups of CHB: treatment naοve (r = 0. 73; P < 0. 001, n = 32), on treatment (r = 0. 56; P < 0. 05, n = 104), <b>hepatitis</b> <b>Be</b> (HBe) <b>antigen</b> positive (r = 0. 67; P < 0. 001, n = 62) and anti-HBe positive (r = 0. 61; P < 0. 05, n = 74) group.

40|$|AIMS: To {{assess the}} {{relevance}} of genetic variants of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and to demonstrate {{the usefulness of the}} polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in cases of HBV diagnostic difficulty. METHODS: Five serum samples from patients that presented diagnostic difficulty in routine laboratories were sent to a research laboratory for PCR, and if appropriate, S gene sequencing, in vitro expression, and antigenic analysis. RESULTS: The demonstration of HBV in serum by PCR allowed a definitive diagnosis of current infection. One serum sample with poor reactivity in a diagnostic assay had a minor hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) variant and another with very poor reactivity had multiple variants of HBsAg. Transient HBsAg reactivity was observed in a recently vaccinated patient. A <b>hepatitis</b> <b>Be</b> <b>antigen</b> (HBeAg) false positive reaction was noted in a patient from a well defined risk group for HBV. One patient who was strongly HBsAg/HBeAg positive, but anti-hepatitis B core antibody negative, was viraemic. CONCLUSIONS: PCR may become the gold standard for the diagnosis of current HBV infection.

Sixteen of the 45 patients receiving interferon were human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody positive: none of these responded. Forty one per cent of the anti-HIV negative patients receiving interferon (12 / 29, p less than 0. 005) lost HBeAg and 17 % (5 / 29) lost hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). The response rate among these anti-HIV negative patients receiving at least three months therapy was 46 % and 19 % respectively. Low pretreatment HBV-DNA and absence of anti-HIV were the only significant independent variables predicting response to therapy (p less than 0. 03 and p less than 0. 05 respectively). In six patients, neutralising antibodies to alpha interferon were detected during therapy, the majority being non-responders...|$|E
40|$|Sera from 116 {{consecutive}} unselected {{cases of}} sporadic acute viral <b>hepatitis</b> in children <b>were</b> examined for <b>hepatitis</b> B antigen (HBAg), smooth-muscle autoantibodies (SMA), other autoantibodies and immunoglobulins, and skin tests were performed with dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB). HBAg was detected in twenty-one and SMA in ninety-eight out of 116 sera {{that had been}} obtained during the 1 st or 2 nd week from the onset of jaundice. <b>Hepatitis</b> B <b>antigen</b> <b>was</b> present in seventeen out of the eighteen SMA negative patients (94 - 4 %) and in only four out of the ninety-eight SMA-positive patients (4 - 1 %). The presence of SMA {{was not related to}} the sex and age of the patients or to the serum bilirubin and transaminase levels. SMA did not persist for more than 6 weeks from the onset of jaundice in most of the cases. In twenty-eight out of forty-one sera which were tested the IgM level was found to be elevated during the acute phase of illness and within normal limits during the recovery stage. A negative correlation between the presence of SMA and the elevated serum IgM level and the presence of HB Ag in the same patients was observed. The DNCB skin test was found to be positive in all fifty-two patients who did not have HBAg in their serum and in twenty out of the twenty-one patients who had circulating HbAg. From these findings {{there appears to be no}} gross impairment of cell-mediated immunity in acute viral hepatitis, and <b>hepatitis</b> A <b>is</b> associated with SMA production and an increase in serum IgM levels, when compared to hepatitis associated with HBAg...|$|R
40|$|Sera from 87 {{patients}} with acute sporadic viral <b>hepatitis</b> <b>were</b> {{tested for the}} presence of the Australia-SH <b>antigen.</b> Forty-three <b>were</b> positive by the complement-fixation test, but only 24 of these reacted in the gel-diffusion test. The <b>antigen</b> <b>was</b> equally distributed in infectious and serum hepatitis. The relationship of naturally occurring antigen-positive hepatitis to the Willow-brook MS- 2 type is discussed...|$|R
40|$|The commercially {{available}} HepProbe kit involving {{the use of}} a 32 P-labeled RNA probe was evaluated for its sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility in detecting hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA in patient serum by dot blot hybridization. The level of detection was 0. 3 pg, corresponding to 3 x 10 (4) genomes in 50 microliters of serum. A total of 181 serum samples were tested; 53 (82 %) of 65 patients positive for both hepatitis B surface antigen and <b>hepatitis</b> e <b>antigen</b> <b>were</b> positive for HBV DNA compared with only 12 of 74 (16 %) hepatitis B surface antigen-positive but hepatitis e antigen-negative individuals. In addition, among all patients positive for HBV DNA, there was a statistically significant correlation between the concentration of HBV DNA in serum and {{the presence or absence of}} hepatitis e antigen. None of the 42 hepatitis B surface antigen- and hepatitis e antigen-negative patients tested was positive for HBV DNA. Reproducibility was 87 %, with all discordant results representing borderline positives. The results indicate that HepProbe can be employed as a sensitive and reliable assay for HBV DNA in patient serum...|$|R
