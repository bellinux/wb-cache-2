500|$|Jake Gyllenhaal as Robert Graysmith, a {{cartoonist}} for the San Francisco Chronicle. While {{researching the}} film, Fincher considered Gyllenhaal to play Graysmith. According to the director, [...] "I really liked him in Donnie Darko and I thought, He's an interesting double-sided coin. <b>He</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> naive thing {{but he can}} also do possessed." [...] To prepare for his role, Gyllenhaal met Graysmith and videotaped him in order to study his mannerisms and behavior.|$|E
500|$|One of his {{earliest}} conversations on the film's casting {{was with the}} actress Jennifer Aniston. She was talking about actors she had worked with who she loved, and two of her favorites were Gyllenhaal (The Good Girl) and Mark Ruffalo (Rumor Has It). While researching the film, Fincher considered Jake Gyllenhaal to play Robert Graysmith. According to the director, [...] "I really liked him in Donnie Darko and I thought, 'He's an interesting double-sided coin. <b>He</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> naive thing but he can also do possessed.

500|$|In December 2013, Wright, {{a fan of}} {{the comic}} book since childhood—owning copies of Tales to Astonish #27 {{featuring}} [...] "The Man in the Ant-Hill" [...] storyline and Marvel Premiere #47 featuring the first appearance of Scott Lang— stated that the difference between Ant-Man and other films featuring size-changing is [...] "other shrinking movies are usually about somebody trapped small. This is different in that he can actually change size and <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> at will, so it becomes more of a power than an impediment." [...] Wright also talked about the challenge of directing a superhero film, saying, [...] "Shaun and Hot Fuzz and World's End are all R-rated films. I like the challenge of making a PG-13 film. Because you've got to entertain in a different way. You don't have the same tools." [...] By December 19, Rudd was in negotiations to star in the film, and Marvel announced that he had been cast as Ant-Man the next day.|$|E

And though {{no one else will}} make himself such a fool as he has done by his letter, {{nevertheless}} even that is a sign of what others are doing. You yourself were saying just now {{that we were going to}} do something,--something particular, you said." ...|$|R

2500|$|On {{his first}} {{appearance}} against more experienced hurdlers, Faugheen contested the Ascot Hurdle over 2m [...] f on 22 November 2014. As in most of his previous races, he took the lead from the start and was never seriously challenged, winning by three and three-quarter lengths from the Nicky Henderson-trained Blue Fashion. Mullins later said: [...] "Dan Skelton, who stood in for me on the day, remarked to Ruby (Walsh) that he'd never saddled a horse as fat as that for a big race. If <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> with that amount of condition on him there must be huge improvement in him". After the race the William Hill made Faugheen 9/4 favourite for the 2015 Champion Hurdle.|$|E

60|$|Poppleton I {{had known}} before slightly. I {{used to see}} him at the club. In club {{surroundings}} he always struck me as an ineffable young ass, loud and talkative and perpetually breaking the silence rules. Yet I {{have to admit that}} in his summer flannels and with a straw hat on <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> things <b>that</b> I can't.|$|R

6000|$|Her assent, {{as if she}} had had a {{delicacy}} about sounding the name, {{was only}} in her face; but she added with it: [...] "Or is there anything <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> would make HER try it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Many a time, lad. He's a great hunter, too, {{let me tell}} you--can hit the bull's-eye at {{a hundred}} paces without half trying. And {{when it comes to}} dancing an Indian war dance <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> too." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Change his clothes!" [...] exclaimed the man. [...] "How ever <b>can</b> <b>he</b> <b>do</b> <b>that?</b> I've nothing that'll fit him, and {{of course}} he has brought nothing along with him." ...|$|R
5000|$|When a {{businessman}} finds himself libeled by a careless journalist, it seems there's little <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> about it <b>that</b> won't bankrupt him. If only {{the law in}} such matters had any part that was equitable to all.|$|R
6000|$|... "Quite right, Edgar. My {{ideas are}} {{that a man}} who can box well is much less likely to get into quarrels than one who cannot. He knows what <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>do,</b> and <b>that,</b> if forced to use his skill, he is able to render a good account of himself, and {{therefore}} <b>he</b> <b>can</b> afford to put up with more, than one who is doubtful as to whether he is likely to come well out of a fight if he begins one." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Shadow-boxing," [...] he {{observed}} in a cavilling spirit to his companion. [...] "Yes, <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> all right, just like I can fox-trot if I ain't got a partner {{to get in the}} way. But one good wallop, and then watch him." ...|$|E
60|$|Now he {{can take}} a bit of chalk to pieces, so that it shall become several {{different}} things, none of which is chalk, or like chalk at all. And then his brother Synthesis can put them together again, so that they shall become chalk, as they were before. <b>He</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> very nearly, but not quite. There is, in every average piece of chalk, something which he cannot make into chalk again when he has once unmade it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not wanton killing, but a judicious slaying. The point is, {{they know}} there is an Invisible Man--as well as we {{know there is}} an Invisible Man. And that Invisible Man, Kemp, must now {{establish}} a Reign of Terror. Yes; no doubt it's startling. But I mean it. A Reign of Terror. He must take some town like your Burdock and terrify and dominate it. He must issue his orders. <b>He</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> in a thousand ways--scraps of paper thrust under doors would suffice. And all who disobey his orders he must kill, and kill all who would defend them." ...|$|E

50|$|Fats {{lines up}} his shot and makes it. He looks up {{intensely}} at Jesse, who is shaking with fear. Fats takes {{something out of}} his pocket - his cue chalk. He sets it down and takes his cue apart. Jesse questions him about the life or death stakes. Fats laughs and says that Jesse will die, in obscurity, as all second-raters do in the end. If he had beaten Fats, he would've lived forever. Fats says that Jesse's good, but not good enough. As Fats disappears, Jesse screams <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> better, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> will practice more and more, and eventually he'll win.|$|R
6000|$|If any man doubts my word now, I {{will kill}} him. No, I will not kill him; I will win his money. I will bet him twenty to one, and let any New York {{publisher}} hold the stakes, that the statements I have above made {{as to the}} authorship of the article in question are entirely true. Perhaps I may get wealthy at this, for I am willing {{to take all the}} bets that offer; and if a man wants larger odds, I will give him all he requires. But he ought to find out whether I am betting on what is termed [...] "a sure thing" [...] or not before he ventures his money, and <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> by going to a public library and examining the London SATURDAY REVIEW of October 8th, which contains the real critique.|$|E

He cuts furze {{because it is the}} only thing <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> does not put any strain upon his poor eyes." [...] The {{contrast}} between the sleeper's appearance and Wildeve's at this moment was painfully apparent to Eustacia, Wildeve being elegantly dressed in a new summer suit and light hat; and she continued: [...] "Ah! you don't know how differently he appeared when I first met him, though it is such a little while ago. His hands were as white and soft as mine; and look at them now, how rough and brown they are! His complexion is by nature fair, and that rusty look he has now, all of a colour with his leather clothes, is caused by the burning of the sun." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Let me assure you, milor--though {{perhaps in}} this I am {{overstepping}} my official powers--that M. le Comte de Stainville has {{no desire to}} deal harshly with you. The {{fact that he is}} the most noted swordsman in France may perhaps be influencing you at this moment, but will you trust to my old experience when I assure you that M. le Comte's noted skill is your very best safeguard? He will be quite content to inflict a slight punishment on you--being a past master with his sword <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> easily, without causing you graver injury. I am telling you this in confidence of course, because I know that these are his intentions. Moreover he starts on an important journey to-morrow and would propose a very brief encounter with you at dawn, in one of the spinneys of the Park. A mere scratch, I assure you, you need fear no more. Less he could not in all honour concede." ...|$|E
2500|$|A common {{response}} from Christian philosophers, such as Norman Geisler or William Lane Craig {{is that the}} paradox assumes a wrong definition of omnipotence. Omnipotence, they say, <b>does</b> not mean <b>that</b> God <b>can</b> <b>do</b> anything at all but, rather, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> anything <b>that's</b> possible according to his nature. The distinction is important. God cannot perform logical absurdities; he cannot, for instance, make 1+1=3. Likewise, God cannot make a being greater than himself because he is, by definition, the greatest possible being. God is limited in his actions to his nature. The Bible supports this, they assert, in passages such as Hebrews 6:18, which says it is [...] "impossible for God to lie." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "None at all, my lad. An officer {{ought to}} be able to show his men how to <b>do</b> everything, and <b>he</b> <b>can</b> never <b>do</b> <b>that</b> if <b>he</b> is afraid of {{dirtying}} his hands. Of course you do know a good deal already about the serving and parcelling of ropes and stays, but likely enough they are done in a different fashion here to what they are on board a smack. I will speak to the head-rigger myself, and tell him you want to learn your business, and are ready to <b>do</b> anything <b>that</b> he likes to set you to; and as you have been already two years at the work he will not find you a lubber." ...|$|R
5000|$|Waldo, meanwhile, having {{satisfied}} {{himself that}} the deKalbs really are having basic problems, also realizes that Grimes is right. Then {{he gets a}} call from NAPA's head of research, Dr. Rambeau, {{who seems to have}} come unhinged. Having seen the wiggling deKalbs, he announces that he knows what is happening. [...] "Magic is loose in the world!" [...] he tells Waldo. He shows Waldo some seemingly impossible tricks <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> now <b>that</b> <b>he</b> understands magic. Waldo calls Stevens to have Rambeau brought to him, but Stevens reports that Rambeau somehow escaped from his restraints without actually unfastening them. Not only that, he has made another set of deKalbs behave as strangely as McLeod's. Waldo asks to have Rambeau's notes and equipment shipped up to him.|$|R
6000|$|This for two reasons, both {{based on}} {{everlasting}} laws. The first, that no great man ever stops working till he has reached {{his point of}} failure: that is to say, his mind is always far in advance of his powers of execution, and the latter will now and then give way in trying to follow it; besides that he will always give to the inferior portions of his work only such inferior attention as they require; and according to his greatness he becomes so accustomed to the feeling of dissatisfaction with the best <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>do,</b> <b>that</b> in moments of lassitude or anger with himself he will not care though the beholder be dissatisfied also. I believe there has only been one man who would not acknowledge this necessity, and strove always to reach perfection, Leonardo; {{the end of his}} vain effort being merely that he would take ten years to a picture and leave it unfinished. And therefore, if we are to have great men working at all, or less men doing their best, the work will be imperfect, however beautiful. Of human work none but what is bad can be perfect, in its own bad way.[161] ...|$|E
6000|$|But however obscure, {{a public}} man may be {{told the truth}} if only once in his life. His office flourishes in the shade; not in the rustic shade beloved of the violet but in the muddled {{twilight}} of mind, where tyranny of every sort flourishes. Its holder need not have either brain or heart, no sight, no taste, no imagination, not even bowels of compassion. He needs not these things. He has power. He can kill thought, and incidentally truth, and incidentally beauty, providing they seek {{to live in a}} dramatic form. He can do it, without seeing, without understanding, without feeling anything; out of mere stupid suspicion, as an irresponsible Roman Caesar could kill a senator. <b>He</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> and there is no one to say him nay. He may call his cook (Moliere used to do that) from below and give her five acts to judge every morning as a matter of constant practice and still remain the unquestioned destroyer of men's honest work. He may have a glass too much. This accident has happened to persons of unimpeachable morality--to gentlemen. He may suffer from spells of imbecility like Clodius. He may [...] . what might he not do! I tell you he is the Caesar of the dramatic world. There has been since the Roman Principate nothing in the way of irresponsible power to compare with the office of the Censor of Plays.|$|E
60|$|Yet when we {{have said}} all our fine things about the arts, we must end with a frank confession, that the arts, as we know them, are but initial. Our best praise is given to what they aimed and promised, not to the actual result. He has {{conceived}} meanly of the resources of man, who believes that the best age of production is past. The real value of the Iliad or the Transfiguration is as signs of power; billows or ripples they are of the stream of tendency; tokens of the everlasting effort to produce, which even in its worst estate the soul betrays. Art has not yet come to its maturity if it do not put itself abreast with the most potent influences of the world, {{if it is not}} practical and moral, if it do not stand in connection with the conscience, if it do not make the poor and uncultivated feel that it addresses them with a voice of lofty cheer. There is higher work for Art than the arts. They are abortive births of an imperfect or vitiated instinct. Art is the need to create; but in its essence, immense and universal, it is impatient of working with lame or tied hands, and of making cripples and monsters, such as all pictures and statues are. Nothing less than the creation of man and nature is its end. A man should find in it an outlet for his whole energy. He may paint and carve only as long as <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>that.</b> Art should exhilarate, and throw down the walls of circumstance on every side, awakening in the beholder the same sense of universal relation and power which the work evinced in the artist, and its highest effect is to make new artists.|$|E
