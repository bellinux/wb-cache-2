25|$|The Egyptian protests {{became the}} most {{critical}} foreign policy crisis so far <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Obama</b> administration, and Obama came to increasingly rely upon Clinton for advice and connections. Clinton had known Mubarak for some twenty years, and had formed {{a close relationship with}} Egyptian First Lady Suzanne Mubarak by supporting the latter's human rights work. Clinton originated the idea of sending Frank G. Wisner as an emissary to Cairo, to tell Mubarak not to seek another term as the country's leader. As Mubarak's response to the protests became violent in early February, Clinton strongly condemned the actions taking place, especially those against journalists covering the events, and urged new Egyptian Vice President Omar Suleiman to conduct an official investigation to hold those responsible for the violence accountable. When Wisner baldly stated that Mubarak's departure should be delayed to accommodate an orderly transition to another government, Clinton rebuked him, but shared a bit of the same sentiment. Mubarak did finally step down on February 11 as the protests became the 2011 Egyptian revolution. Clinton said that the U.S. realized that Egypt still had much work and some difficult times ahead of it. In mid-March, Clinton visited Egypt and indicated support for an Egyptian move towards democracy, but she avoided specific issues of U.S. aid and when elections should take place.|$|E

500|$|Obama {{campaigned for}} her husband's {{re-election}} in 2012. [...] Beginning in 2011, Obama became more politically active {{than she had}} been since the 2008 election, though avoided discussions about the re-election bid. By {{the time of the}} election cycle, she had developed a more open public image, some viewing her as the most popular member of the Obama administration, as her poll numbers having never dropped below 60% since entering the White House and an Obama senior campaign official even dubbed her [...] "the most popular political figure in America". The positive assessment was reasoned to have contributed to her active role in the re-election campaign, but it was noted that the challenge <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Obama</b> campaign was using her without tarnishing her popularity. Obama was viewed as a polarizing figure, having both [...] "sharp enmity and deep loyalty" [...] from Americans, but she was also seen as having improved her image since the time of the last election when her husband initially ran for the presidency.

[...] Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki expressed hope for openness for a new direction, noting that [...] "if Obama chooses the right path, compensates the past, lifts hostility and U.S.hegemony, and revises the previous political mistakes, we will have no hostility." [...] State-owned Channel One Russia, Russia's flagship early evening news show, covered Obama's presidential inauguration as a minor news story, devoting much of the day's airtime instead to the gas war with Ukraine. The People's Republic of China covered the Obama inauguration live on its state‑controlled China Central Television, providing simultaneous translation into Mandarin Chinese with a brief delay to allow censoring of Obama's comments. When President Obama mentioned [...] "earlier generations faced down fascism and communism", Chinese state television officials cut away abruptly from the televised speech and switched to a discussion in the studio. State-controlled print, radio and television media in North Korea provided no coverage or mention of the Obama inauguration in the hours after the event, opting instead to cover news about Equatorial Guinea welcoming the North Korean ambassador.|$|E
