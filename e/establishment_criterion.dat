In the previous work [15], we proposed a new metric, the drain rate, {{to be used to}} forecast the lifetime of nodes according to current traffic conditions. This metric, when combined with the value of the remaining battery capacity, allows us to establish whether or not a node can be part of an active route. We introduced a mechanism, called the Minimum Drain Rate (MDR) {{that can be used in}} any of the existing MANETs routing protocols as a route <b>establishment</b> <b>criterion</b> to achieve a dual goal: to extend both nodal battery life and connection duration. In this paper, we present a modified version, called Conditional MDR (CMDR), which also minimizes the total transmission power consumed per packet besides the above dual goal.

The main purpose of the innovative entrepreneurship policy is to disseminate the awareness of the entrepreneurship and to encourage the entrepreneurship based on Research and Development that has used the advanced technology. The effectiveness of innovative entrepreneurship activities depends on formation of entrepreneurship policies and optimum usage of the policy tools. In the study, among numerous policy tools effecting application {{in the frame of}} entrepreneurship policies, business <b>establishment</b> <b>criteria</b> tools and entrepreneurship education, are analyzed with examples from the world and Turkey. Development of innovative entrepreneurship activities aiming at growth is made possible by generalizing educational programs and easing business <b>establishment</b> <b>criteria.</b> Thereby, positive relation between economic growth and entrepreneurship gets stronger.

40|$|Growing {{demand for}} video {{services}} {{is the main}} driver for increasing traffic in wireless cellular data networks. Wireless video distribution schemes have recently been proposed to offload data via Device-to-Device (D 2 D) communications. These offloading schemes increase capacity and reduce end-to-end delay in cellular networks and help to serve the dramatically increasing demand for high quality video. In this paper, we propose a new scheme for video distribution over cellular networks by exploiting full-duplex (FD) D 2 D communication in two scenarios; scenario one: two nodes exchange their desired video files simultaneously with each other, and scenario two: each node can concurrently transmit to and receive from two different nodes. In the latter case, an intermediate transceiver can serve one or multiple users' file requests whilst capturing its desired file from another device in the vicinity. Analytic and simulation results are {{used to compare the}} proposed scheme with its half-duplex (HD) counterpart under the same transmitter <b>establishment</b> <b>criteria</b> to show the achievable gain of FD-D 2 D scheme in video content delivery, in terms of sum throughput and latency.

Understanding how inoculation characteristics (propagule pressure) affect establishment {{outcome of a}} non-native, invading species {{in the context of}} abiotic and biotic factors (ecological resistance) is a recent area of emphasis in ecology given an urgent need to prevent and manage invasive species globally. The overarching objective of this dissertation research is to quantify how a non-native species (Daphnia magna) establishes in response to different levels of propagule pressure {{in the context of a}} Laurentian Great Lakes port receiving system. Specifically, I described spatial and temporal patterns in the density and diversity of crustacean zooplankton in the context of abiotic factors of the Duluth-Superior Harbor and St. Louis River Estuary (DSHSLRE) and used those measures to develop <b>establishment</b> <b>criteria</b> for the propagule pressure experiments. Next, I evaluated the ability of a surrogate invader, D. magna to successfully colonize 200 -L mesocosm aquaria by manipulating propagule pressure and several components of ecological resistance. Special attention was paid to the density of 10 individuals m- 3 as this is the current standard suggested by the International Maritime Organization for density of permissible non-native species in ballast water discharge from oceangoing vessels. Lastly, I re-analyzed the results from the propagule pressure experiments to evaluate how different <b>establishment</b> <b>criteria,</b> which vary in rigor, influence the perceived outcome. Results demonstrate notable spatial and seasonal patterns in the abiotic conditions and zooplankton diversity and density measured at nine locations sampled biweekly during 2007 and 2008 in the DSHSLRE. Abiotic characteristics of upstream sites were indicative of littoral habitats and changed more dramatically within a year and from year to year. Overall 49 distinct taxa were identified, half at the genus level Copepoda and half Cladocera. Colonization of the mesocosm aquariums by D. magna populations ranged from 50 - 80 % in the spring and fall experiments but never achieved success greater than 33 % in the summer experiments. Only when the background assemblage of zooplankton was first removed from the tanks in the summer was D. magna able to establish suggesting that ecological resistance related to resource competition was prohibitive. Risk of establishment evaluated by different threshold criteria influenced the perceived outcome of the mesocosm experiments. This study demonstrates the multi-faceted nature of drivers that determine establishment success of a non-native species and the complexities of evaluating standards on permissible biological pollution using an experimental, mesocosm venue...|$|R
