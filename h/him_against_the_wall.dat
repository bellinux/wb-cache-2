5|$|Elara's archers, {{shooting}} from the walls, inflicted heavy casualties on the attackers, while soldiers {{on top of}} the walls prevented any attempt to breach the wall by puring down molten metal on them. The elephant Kandula, attempting to break the southern gate, was injured in such an attack. After tending to his injuries and protecting him using thick animal hides, Dutthagamani encouraged Kandula and drove <b>him</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall.</b> The wall was breached and Dutthagamani's army entered the city. The ten champions, unwilling to enter through an opening made by another, destroyed the wall themselves in different places and broke into the city. Led by them, Dutthagamani's army destroyed the defenders and took control of the fortress city of Vijithapura. The survivors retreated to Anuradhapura.|$|E
2500|$|Javad Iqbal, a Pakistani-American cable {{television}} installer from Hicksville, New York, {{was arrested in}} New York in November 2001, on charges of conspiracy to defraud the United States and fraud in relation to identification documents (violations of 18 U.S.C. §§ 371 and 1028) and placed in pretrial detention at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, New York. He alleged that FBI officials carried out a discriminatory policy by designating {{him as a person}} [...] "of high interest" [...] in the investigation of the September 11 attacks solely because of his race, religion, or national origin. Owing to this designation he was placed in the detention center's Administrative Maximum Special Housing Unit for over six months while awaiting the fraud trial. Iqbal claimed that on the day he was transferred to the special unit, prison guards, without provocation, [...] "picked him up and threw <b>him</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> kicked him in the stomach, punched him in the face, and dragged him across the room." [...] He said that after being attacked a second time he sought medical attention but was denied care for two weeks. According to Iqbal’s complaint, prison staff in the special unit subjected him to unjustified strip and body cavity searches, verbally berated him as a [...] "terrorist" [...] and [...] "Muslim killer," [...] refused to give him adequate food, and intentionally turned on air conditioning during the winter and heating during the summer, He claimed that prison staff interfered with his attempts to pray and engage in religious study, and with his access to counsel. Mr. Iqbal pleaded guilty to using another man's Social Security card on April 22, 2002, served a prison term until his release on January 15, 2003, and was later deported to Pakistan.|$|E
60|$|Bill laid {{both his}} {{powerful}} hands on Jeff's shoulders, backed <b>him</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> and surveyed him with great gravity.|$|E
6000|$|He had, in turn, grasped Captain Dick, {{and forced}} <b>him</b> frenziedly <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall.</b> <b>The</b> captain {{released}} himself, and, taking {{the hands of}} his excited visitor, said slowly,-- ...|$|R
60|$|Dan did not {{conclude}} the threat, for, regardless of aunt Dorcas's presence, Joe leaped from the table, and seized the pretended detective by the throat, forcing <b>him</b> back <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall.</b>|$|R
60|$|Then Theseus rushed upon him; {{and sore}} was the battle upon the cliff, for when Sciron felt {{the weight of}} the bronze club, he dropt his own, and closed with Theseus, and tried to hurl him by main force over the cliff. But Theseus was a wary wrestler, and dropt his own club, and caught him by the throat and by the knee, and forced <b>him</b> back <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> of stones, and crushed <b>him</b> up <b>against</b> them, till his breath was almost gone. And Sciron cried panting, ‘Loose me, and I will let thee pass.’ But Theseus answered, ‘I must not pass till I have made the rough way smooth;’ and he forced <b>him</b> back <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> till it fell, and Sciron rolled head over heels.|$|R
6000|$|With a bound Ross seized him {{and flung}} <b>him</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall.</b> [...] "Get back there!" [...] he shouted. [...] "You must take your {{medicine}} with your boss." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{started back}} in alarm, {{and his wife}} gave a faint scream as Flower caught him by the collar, and, holding <b>him</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> went through his pockets.|$|E
60|$|I felt I {{had never}} {{encountered}} a more detestable way of evading a licking. I shoved <b>him</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> {{and left him}} there, forgiving me, and {{went back into the}} house.|$|E
60|$|Clara, much embarrassed, gave <b>him</b> a chair <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> {{opposite}} <b>the</b> white heaps. Then {{she herself}} took her {{place on the}} sofa, shamedly.|$|R
60|$|The steward waived the question; he {{knew from}} {{experience}} the futility of arguing with men in drink. The great thing was to get Teddy Silk home, not to argue with him. He smiled good-temperedly to himself, and with a sudden movement pinned <b>him</b> up <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> in time to arrest another fall.|$|R
5000|$|Turning his {{attention}} to Hamilton, Dillinger said, [...] "Don't let those coppers outside worry you. Take your time {{and be sure to}} get all the dough. We'll take care of them birds on the outside when we get there." [...] Dillinger then discovered the hiding VP, Spencer, and ordered <b>him</b> up <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> with everyone else.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{lifted the}} three-hundred-pound stone god, {{and carried him}} {{into the back room}} of the café--the temple, I mean--and leaned <b>him</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall.</b> It was more work than {{bouncing}} three live ones from an all-night Broadway joint on New-Year's Eve.|$|E
6000|$|... "Fearest!" [...] said Pereo, fiercely, {{clutching}} {{him by the}} throat, {{and forcing}} <b>him</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall.</b> [...] "Fearest! sayest thou. I, Pereo, fear? Dost thou think I would soil these hands, that might strike a higher quarry, with blood of thy game?" ...|$|E
60|$|At those words, {{the truth}} rushed at last into my stupid old head. For the moment, I suppose I {{must have gone}} clean out of my senses. I seized the Sergeant by {{the collar of his}} coat, and pinned <b>him</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall.</b>|$|E
50|$|On October 27, 2012, Sakuragi faced {{grappling}} expert Sanae Kikuta in {{a special}} fight in Grabaka under full vale tudo rules, without gloves and allowing elbows and headbutts. The bout was short, and saw Sakuragi landing a spinning back kick, sidestepping Kikuta's attempts to push <b>him</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> cage <b>wall,</b> and finally knocking him down with strikes.|$|R
6000|$|Hardly {{knowing what}} I did, acting desperately {{on the first}} impulse that {{occurred}} to me, I seized the servant and pushed <b>him</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> vestry <b>wall.</b> [...] "Stoop!" [...] I said, [...] "and hold by the stones. I am going to climb over you to the roof--I am going to break the skylight, and give him some air!" ...|$|R
60|$|But, {{she stopped}} {{him with a}} cry. Looking at her he saw her, with a face quite strange to <b>him,</b> {{shrinking}} back <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> with her hands before her eyes.|$|R
60|$|The Indian {{bent over}} Rojas and flung <b>him</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall.</b> Mercedes, sinking back, lay still. When Rojas got up the Indian stood {{between him and}} escape from the ledge. Rojas backed the other way along the {{narrowing}} shelf of lava. His manner was abject, stupefied. Slowly he stepped backward.|$|E
60|$|Stammering out something, I {{knew not}} what, I rolled away from <b>him</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> and then conjured him, whoever or {{whatever}} he might be, to keep quiet, {{and let me}} get up and light the lamp again. But his guttural responses satisfied me at once that he but ill comprehended my meaning.|$|E
60|$|But {{when he had}} {{got over}} the first shock he {{began to think of}} some way out of the difficulty, and seizing the hunchback in his arms he carried him out into the street, and leaning <b>him</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> of a shop he stole back to his own house, without once looking behind him.|$|E
60|$|Before I {{could do}} {{anything}} to interfere, he had rudely embraced and repeatedly kissed the resisting girl. Next moment I had pulled him away with fury, and flung <b>him</b> heavily <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall.</b> He laughed loud and long, and I feared his wits had given way under the strain; for {{even in the best}} of days he had been a sparing and a quiet laugher.|$|R
60|$|But the Rover {{boys were}} too quick for them, {{and while the}} sheriff {{continued}} to cover Koswell and the so-called doctor, and also {{kept an eye on}} Larkspur, the lads leaped on their old enemies. With a rapid swing of his right hand, Tom gave Sobber a blow on the jaw that sent <b>him</b> staggering <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall.</b> At <b>the</b> same time Dick attacked Josiah Crabtree.|$|R
5000|$|But one brother, called Søren Jacobsen, {{they threw}} {{to the floor}} near the stair to the {{dormitory}} several times, stomped on him with their feet and in <b>the</b> cloister smashed <b>him</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> and dragged <b>him</b> around the cloister by his arms like a dumb ass. When he finally escaped from them, {{he said to his}} brethren: [...] "I tell you, brothers, and it is true, that I feel my death is near after such blows and bumps as I have taken; I am so poorly that I can hardly draw a breath." [...] Several days afterwards this brother went to bed and began to be very ill, such that he spit up blood continually and often fell unconscious to the floor. When Brother Søren lay in his final hours a few (citizens) came to him, councilor Algod Nielsen, Mogens Johansen, Tycho Laurentsen, Tue Sutor, and Peter Olsen came to (see) the aforementioned Brother Søren.|$|R
60|$|The December air was frosty, but {{the sweat}} broke out upon Whistling Dick's face. He thrust {{his head out}} of the window, and looked down. Fifteen feet below <b>him,</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> of the house, he could make out that a border of flowers grew, and by that token he {{overhung}} a bed of soft earth.|$|E
60|$|The closing {{night at}} Plymouth {{was a very}} great scene, and the morning there was {{exceedingly}} good too. You {{will be glad to}} hear that at Clifton last night, a torrent of five hundred shillings bore Arthur away, pounded <b>him</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> flowed on to the seats over his body, scratched him, and damaged his best dress suit. All to his unspeakable joy.|$|E
60|$|On {{the third}} night a Troll came who had nine heads and nine rods, and he struck the lad and flogged him so long, that {{at last he}} swooned away; so the Troll took him up and flung <b>him</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> and this made the flask of {{ointment}} fall down, and it splashed all over him, and he became as strong as ever again.|$|E
60|$|David Blunt {{sat at a}} desk near <b>him,</b> writing diligently. <b>Against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> {{over his}} head hung a row of truncheons. Besides the desk, a bench, two or three wooden chairs, and a chest, there was little {{furniture}} in the room.|$|R
2500|$|Kelly {{said about}} the incident, [...] "It was {{in the course of}} this {{attempted}} arrest Fitzpatrick endeavoured to catch hold of me by the foot, and in the struggle he tore the sole and heel of my boot clean off. With one well-directed blow, I sent <b>him</b> sprawling <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> and <b>the</b> staggering blow I then gave him partly accounts to me for his subsequent conduct towards my family and myself." ...|$|R
60|$|Muldev, however, {{would not}} listen to these words. He ran to the pond hard by, soaked {{the end of his}} waistcloth in water, {{sprinkled}} it over the young Brahman, raised him from the ground, and placed <b>him</b> sitting <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall.</b> And perceiving, when he came to himself, that his sickness was rather of the soul than of the body, the old men asked him how he came to be in that plight.|$|R
60|$|Ben shook in Adam's iron grasp, but, like a plucky {{small man}} as he was, he didn't mean to give in. With his left hand he {{snatched}} the brush from his powerless right, and made a movement {{as if he would}} perform the feat of writing with his left. In a moment Adam turned him round, seized his other shoulder, and, pushing him along, pinned <b>him</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall.</b> But now Seth spoke.|$|E
60|$|Terrible {{was this}} struggle, but brief. Joe {{seemingly}} {{had the strength}} of ten men. Twice he pulled Girty down as a wolf drags a deer. He dashed <b>him</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> throwing him nearing and nearer the knife. Once within reach of the blade Joe struck the renegade a severe blow on the temple and the villain's wrestling became weaker. Planting his heavy knee on Girty's breast, Joe reached for the knife, and swung it high. Exultantly he cried, mad with lust for the brute's blood.|$|E
60|$|Hank {{turned and}} went back to her. Backed by his never before {{questioned}} honesty of purpose, he approached the girl and removed his soft-brimmed hat. Elsie had but time to sum up his handsome frank face with one shy look of modest admiration when a burly cop hurled himself upon the ranchman, seized him by the collar and backed <b>him</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall.</b> Two blocks away a burglar was coming out of an apartment-house with a bag of silverware on his shoulder; but that is neither here nor there.|$|E
60|$|As he {{uttered the}} last words he {{permitted}} Henry to rise. Ere the youth had quite gained his footing, he gave him a violent push and sent <b>him</b> staggering back <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall.</b> When Henry recovered his balance, Gascoyne {{was standing in the}} open doorway.|$|R
6000|$|... "Wait," [...] said Patterson, glancing {{toward the}} building. Its blank, shutterless windows {{revealed}} no inner light; a profound silence encompassed it. [...] "Come quick," [...] he whispered. Letting his grasp slip {{down to the}} unresisting hand of the stranger, he half dragged, half led <b>him,</b> brushing <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> into <b>the</b> {{open door of the}} deserted bar-room he had just quitted, locked the inner door, poured a glass of whiskey from a decanter, gave it to him, and then watched him drain it at a single draught.|$|R
6000|$|... "Peace, sot!" [...] cried Dick, {{and thrust}} <b>him</b> hard <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall.</b> [...] "In two words--if so be {{that such a}} man can {{understand}} me who hath more wine than wit in him--in two words, and a-Mary's name, begone out of this house, where, if ye continue to abide, ye will not only hang yourself, but me also! Faith, then, up foot! be yare, or, by the mass, I may forget that I am in some sort your captain, and in some your debtor! Go!" ...|$|R
