5|$|Copenhagen is {{recognized}} as one of the most environmentally friendly cities in the world. As a result of its commitment to high environmental standards, Copenhagen has been praised for its green economy, ranked as the top green city for the second time in the 2014 Global Green Economy Index (GGEI). In 2001 a large offshore wind farm was built just off the coast of Copenhagen at Middelgrunden. It produces about 4% of the city's energy. Years of substantial investment in sewage treatment have improved water quality in the harbour to an extent that the <b>inner</b> <b>harbour</b> can be used for swimming with facilities at a number of locations.|$|E
5|$|The {{choice of}} targets was {{left up to}} the midget commanders, with advice that they should {{primarily}} target aircraft carriers or battleships, with cruisers as secondary targets. The midgets were to operate {{to the east of}} the Harbour Bridge, although if no suitable targets were to be found in this area they were to move under the Bridge and attack a battleship and large cruiser believed to be in the <b>inner</b> <b>harbour.</b> When the second reconnaissance flyover revealed that the expected British battleship——was nowhere to be found, USS Chicago became the priority target.|$|E
50|$|The two <b>inner</b> <b>harbours</b> in Punic cothon {{were located}} in the southeast; one being commercial, {{and the other for}} war. Their {{definite}} functions are not entirely known, probably for the construction, outfitting, or repair of ships, perhaps also loading and unloading cargo. Larger anchorages existed to the north and south of the city. North and west of the cothon were located several industrial areas, e.g., metalworking and pottery (e.g., for amphora), which could serve both <b>inner</b> <b>harbours,</b> and ships anchored to the south of the city.|$|R
50|$|The Canal de Bourbourg is a 21 km long canal which {{connects the}} Aa River (near Bourbourg) to the <b>inner</b> <b>harbours</b> {{of the port}} of Dunkerque in the Nord department, in {{northern}} France.

5|$|In {{the centre}} of the town lies Weymouth Harbour; {{although}} it was the reason for the town's foundation, the harbour separates the two areas of Melcombe Regis (the main town centre) and Weymouth (the southern harbourside) from each other. Since the 18th century they have been linked by successive bridges over the narrowest part of the harbour. The present Town Bridge, built in 1930, is a lifting bascule bridge allowing boats to access the <b>inner</b> <b>harbour.</b> The Royal National Lifeboat Institution stationed a lifeboat at Weymouth {{for the first time on}} 26 January 1869. A boathouse was built with a slipway by the harbour and is still in use, although the lifeboat is now moored at a pontoon.|$|E
5|$|Arbroath's {{prospects}} originally {{revolved around}} the harbour. The original harbour was constructed and maintained by the abbot within the terms of an agreement between the burgesses and John Gedy, the abbot in 1394 AD. This {{gave way to a}} more commodious port in 1725, which in turn was enlarged and improved in 1839, when the sea wall, quay walls and breakwater were added to the old <b>inner</b> <b>harbour,</b> at a cost of £58,000. Arbroath became a major port for the coastal shipping trade and in 1846, there were 89 Arbroath registered vessels, totalling 9,100 gross tons. In the same year, 599 vessels docked at Arbroath, 56 from foreign ports (mainly Baltic ports) with the remaining 543 employed on the coastal trade. Bark, flax, hemp, hides, oak and fir timber, and guano for manure, groceries from London, and numerous articles of Baltic produce were imported via Arbroath, with manufactured goods (mainly sailcloth) exported via Arbroath.|$|E
5|$|Weymouth Harbour is {{long and}} narrow, and formed the estuary of the River Wey until the {{building}} of a bridge to Westham, which separated the harbour's backwaters from Radipole Lake. For centuries the harbour was a passenger terminal and trade and cargo port: goods handled included wool and spices, and in the 20th century Weymouth was a bulk importer of fertiliser and cars. The old harbourside, {{on both sides of the}} seaward end of the harbour, still hosts a fishing fleet, with docks, unloading areas, and a cross-channel ferry terminal. Fishing and cargo trading employ fewer people in the area since their peak in earlier centuries, but local fishermen catch the largest mass of fish in England and the third largest in the United Kingdom. The <b>inner</b> <b>harbour</b> has been refurbished in two phases, in 1994–1996 and in 2002, to include a new marina with hundreds of berths for pleasure boats, cruisers and sailing boats. Local boats offer fishing and diving trips, pleasure cruises along the Jurassic Coast, and thrill-rides to the Isle of Portland.|$|E
5000|$|South of the citadel, {{near the}} cothon (the <b>inner</b> <b>harbours)</b> was the tophet, a special and very old cemetery, which when begun lay outside the city's boundaries. Here the Salammbô was located, the Sanctuary of Tanit, not a temple but an {{enclosure}} for placing stone stelae. These were mostly short and upright, carved for funeral purposes. Evidence from here may indicate {{the occurrence of}} child sacrifice. Probably the tophet burial fields were [...] "dedicated at an early date, perhaps by the first settlers." ...|$|R

2500|$|... 1824 Kronstadt, {{the main}} {{base of the}} Russian Baltic Fleet was swept by the {{disastrous}} flood of 1824. Of 28 capital ships moored in the <b>inner</b> <b>harbours</b> of Kotlin Island, only five were spared by the flood, and only {{three of them were}} deemed safe for the open seas. Twenty-two capital ships were written off and broken up. Most of them remained afloat when the flood recessed, but were too rotten to be worth salvaging. Alexander I saw no need to resurrect the fleet to its past strength, and in 1825 the shipyards of Arkhangelsk laid down only two new ships: Azov and Ezekiel.|$|R
