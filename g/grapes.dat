5|$|The <b>grapes</b> exhibit {{an uneven}} pattern of ripening: a single bunch may contain both raisin-like, {{over-ripe}} <b>grapes</b> and green, unripened <b>grapes.</b> Some winemakers choose to vinify the bunches with these {{varying levels of}} ripeness, while others hand-harvest the bunches, even by single berries, in multiple passes through the vineyards over several weeks. This extensively laborious practice is one component in {{the high cost of}} some Zinfandels.|$|E
5|$|All around are pubs and brothels. The Earl of Cardigan tavern is on {{one side}} of the street, and {{opposite}} is the Rummer, whose sign shows a rummer (a short wide-brimmed glass) with a bunch of <b>grapes</b> on the pole. Masonic lodges met in both taverns during the 1730s, and the Lodge at the Rummer and <b>Grapes</b> in nearby Channel Row was the smartest of the four founders of the Grand Lodge. The publican is adulterating a hogshead of wine, a practice recalled in the poetry of Matthew Prior who lived with his uncle Samuel Prior, the Landlord successively of both the Rummer and <b>Grapes</b> and the Rummer".|$|E

5|$|<b>Grapes</b> {{are mostly}} grown for making wine and vinegar as basic {{components}} of the Mediterranean diet, as well for drying as raisins or for eating as table <b>grapes.</b> Raisins and table grape varieties are chosen for their flavour. Grape production remains important in the Mediterranean area, with Southern Europe accounting for 21% of the world's harvest. In 2014, Italy produced 6.9 million tonnes (mt) of <b>grapes,</b> Spain 6.2 mt, France 6.2 mt, Turkey 4.2 mt, and Germany 1.2 mt.

5|$|Irrigation made it {{possible}} to grow <b>grapes</b> for wine. The first <b>grapes</b> were planted at Hanwood in the spring of 1913 by John James McWilliam and his eldest son Jack who had come to the district from their winery in Junee. Irrigation was by carting of water until the irrigation channels were opened a few months later. The first <b>grapes</b> were picked in 1916 and sent to Junee for processing. Penfolds established their winery in the region in 1919.|$|E
5|$|Since almost its {{inception}} in 1914, Grapico was associated with real <b>grape</b> juice by J. Grossman's Sons through its advertisements and business stationery. Publicly associating Grapico with genuine <b>grape</b> juice allowed J. Grossman's Sons to compete directly with real <b>grape</b> juice producers such as Welch <b>Grape</b> Juice Co. and have an advantage over other imitation <b>grape</b> flavored beverage producers. A problem with this approach was that Grapico was an artificial <b>grape</b> drink that included neither real <b>grape</b> juice nor fruit from the <b>grape.</b>|$|R

The <b>grapes</b> on the southern facing slope add more power and character. <b>Grapes</b> across the district contribute to the bouquet and headiness. The abundance of southern facing slopes in the Vallée de la Marne produces the ripest wines with full aroma. The Côte des Blancs <b>grapes</b> are known for their finesse and the freshness they add to blends with the extension of the nearby Côte de Sézanne offering similar though slightly less distinguished traits.|$|E
5|$|Zinfandel vines {{are quite}} {{vigorous}} and grow best in climates that are warm {{but not too}} hot, because <b>grapes</b> may shrivel in hot weather. Zinfandel's thin-skinned <b>grapes</b> grow in large, tight bunches that are sometimes prone to bunch rot. The fruit ripen fairly early and produce juice with high sugar content. If weather conditions permit, the <b>grapes</b> may be late-harvested to make dessert wine. Zinfandel is often praised {{for its ability to}} reflect both its terroir and its winemaker's style and skill.|$|E

5|$|A new viticultural area {{along the}} Snake River was {{established}} on April 9, 2007. Principally located in Idaho, the area also encompasses two large counties in Eastern Oregon, Baker County and Malheur County. The region's climate is unique among AVAs in Oregon; the average temperature is relatively cool and rainfall is low, creating a shorter growing season. Current production {{is led by}} hardy <b>grapes</b> such as Riesling, Gewürztraminer, and Chardonnay. The climate also lends itself extremely well {{to the production of}} ice wine. However, the AVA is quite large and warmer microclimates within the area can also support different types of <b>grapes</b> such as Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot.|$|E
5|$|Among the reds, Grenache, Syrah, Carignan, Cinsault, and Mourvedre {{are major}} <b>grapes</b> of the Corbières, Faugères, Fitou, and Minervois AOCs.

50|$|Cabernet blanc {{is a white}} German and Swiss wine <b>grape</b> {{variety that}} is a {{crossing}} of the French wine <b>grape</b> Cabernet Sauvignon and an unknown hybrid <b>grape</b> variety. The <b>grape</b> was bred by Swiss <b>grape</b> breeder Valentin Blattner in 1991. Cabernet blanc has strong resistance to most <b>grape</b> disease including botrytis bunch rot, downy and powdery mildew and tends to produce loose clusters of small, thick-skinned <b>grape</b> berries which can hang on the vine late into the harvest season to produce dessert wines. Today the <b>grape</b> is found primarily in the Palatinate wine region of Germany with some experimental plantings in the Netherlands.|$|R

5|$|The first {{batches of}} vinegar {{produced}} by fermentation probably followed {{errors in the}} winemaking process. If must is fermented at too high a temperature, acetobacter will overwhelm the yeast naturally occurring on the <b>grapes.</b> As the demand for vinegar for culinary, medical, and sanitary purposes increased, vintners quickly learned to use other organic materials to produce vinegar in the hot summer months before the <b>grapes</b> were ripe and ready for processing into wine.

40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>grape</b> seeds extract and <b>grape</b> peels extract {{prepared}} from <b>grape</b> pomace on {{the activity of}} antioxidant enzymes, degree of lipid peroxidation in serum and liver tissue were investigated in rabbits fed on high cholesterol diet. New Zealand white rabbits were divided as follows; 1) NOR (normal group); 2) CHOL (cholesterol group); 3) GSH (cholesterol + <b>grape</b> seed extract group); 4) GPE (cholesterol + <b>grape</b> peel extract); 5) GSP (cholesterol + <b>grape</b> seed powder); 6) GPP (cholesterol + <b>grape</b> peel powder); 7) GE (cholesterol + <b>grape</b> seed and peel extract); 8) GP (cholesterol + <b>grape</b> seed and peel powder). Eight groups of rabbits were studied for 8 weeks. At {{the end of the}} experimental period, rabbits were sacrificed and the liver tissue were removed. Then, GSH, GPx, GST, CAT and MDA in the liver were measured. In liver tissues, total glutathione contents (GSH), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and catalase (CAT) activity, which was significantly higher by <b>grape</b> seed extract supplementation. The level of malondialdehyde (MDA) was lower in the serum of rabbits fed <b>grape</b> seed extract or <b>grape</b> peel powder plus cholesterol than in the serum of rabbits fed cholesterol alone. It is therefore likely that <b>grape</b> seed extract prepared from <b>grape</b> pomace functioned as antioxidants in vivo, negating the effects of the oxidative stress induced by 1 % cholesterol diet. The <b>grape</b> seed extract was found effective in converting the oxidized glutathione into reduced glutathione, and in removing H 2 O 2 that is created by oxidative stress. The <b>grape</b> peel powder was found to have small influence on reduced glutathione content, CAT and GPX activity, but it increased GST activity in liver tissues, resulting in promoting the combination of lipid peroxide and glutathione (GSH), and further, lowering the formation of lipid peroxide in the serum. Therefore, <b>grape</b> pomace (<b>grape</b> seed extract and <b>grape</b> peel powder) supplementation is considered to activate the antioxidant enzyme system and prevent damage with hypercholesterolemia...|$|R
