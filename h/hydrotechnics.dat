Representing the Water resource taken directly from natural sources of surface and ground water, requirement ensures water supply used in various destinations such as population and industrial and agricultural businesses. The water resource is not evenly distributed in time and space. Also, and its use is done unevenly, with maximum requirement periods, medium or low. There are periods when the water requisit are not covered by unarranged direct sources even though technological processes are equipped with internal water circulation systems or connected external to water networks.
