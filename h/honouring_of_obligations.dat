The Commission's resulting March 2009 report criticised the Georgian law. The law was at odds with UN Security Council resolutions that were binding both on the Russian Federation and on Georgia. The report said that the law raised concerns [...] "with regard to humanitarian access to the conflict affected areas." [...] The terms used in Article 2 contradicted 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). Limitation on free migration [...] "may be in contradiction with the Georgian international engagements." [...] The Commission also stressed Georgia's obligation to respect the 1951 Refugee Convention. The commission also criticised the law's lack of clarity, saying that [...] "the text {{of the law is}} not clear." [...] In its aspects dealing with private property (Article 5), it might have violated Article 1 of the First Protocol of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and the principle of proportionality, as well as additionally violating further aspects of the Hague Convention (The Laws and Customs of War on Land). A restriction and criminalisation of economic activities (Article 6) was contrary to the rule of customary international law, and also the IV Geneva Convention. The Commission also recommended [...] "to insert a clarifying provision" [...] into the law regarding basic documents issued by illegal authorities concerning the personal status.|$|E

2500|$|Beowulf's {{eventual}} {{death from}} the dragon presages [...] "warfare, death, and darkness" [...] for his Geats. The dragon's hoard symbolizes the vestige {{of an older}} society, now lost to wars and famine, left behind by a survivor of that period. His imagined elegy foreshadows Beowulf's death and elegy to come. Before he faces the dragon, Beowulf thinks of his past: his childhood and wars the Geats endured during that period, foreshadowing the future. At his death, peace in his lands will end, and his people will again suffer a period of war and hardship. An embattled society without [...] "social cohesion" [...] {{is represented by the}} avarice of the [...] "dragon jealously guarding its gold hoard", and the elegy for Beowulf becomes an elegy for the entire culture. The dragon's hoard is representative of a people lost and antique, which is juxtaposed against the Geatish people, whose history is new and fleeting. As king of his people, Beowulf defends them against the dragon, and when his thanes desert him, the poem shows the disintegration of a [...] "heroic society" [...] which [...] "depends upon the <b>honouring</b> <b>of</b> mutual <b>obligations</b> between lord and thane".|$|R

40|$|Credit {{may mean}} both {{a way of}} doing {{business}} and the reputation of the individuals transacting it. Both aspects are explored in this thesis. Access to sources of finance for business {{and the ways in which}} trade credit transactions took place are amongst the economic issues examined. The cultural aspects of credit, such as trust, personal standing and the language in which this was expressed, adherence to, or deviation from, socially acceptable standards of behaviour, are discussed. Credit is used as a tool of analysis to investigate orthodoxies about women's use of it for business purposes. Small-scale capitalism, with its specific objectives of industrious independence and economic individualism centring on the family firm, provides the organising concept and the explanation for how and why women from the middle ranks of society ran businesses during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. Findings, based on the business activities and trade credit transactions of women resident in, or conducting business in, the English West Midlands, reveal their greater participation in the economic community than has been recognised hitherto. Furthermore, they indicate that trade credit transactions between men and women regarding the new consumer goods and services of the first industrial revolution were not an arena for the working out of gender politics. Women belonged to mixed-sex business networks where they were judged, as men were, on the punctuality of their payments and the <b>honouring</b> <b>of</b> their <b>obligations.</b> As a result, the limitations of the existing historiography are shown. Arguments for a specifically female type of credit negotiated between women principally for domestic purposes or that women with capital restricted their economic activity to investment to provide for their non-working existence do not do justice to the 'middling sort' businesswomen whose contribution to the processes of industrialisation is now recognised in this work...|$|R
40|$|The {{rebellion}} against Charles I's authority {{that began in}} Edinburgh in 1637 involved the Scots in successive invasions of England and armed intervention in Ireland. Historians have almost universally taken a negative view of Scottish involvement in these wars, {{because it has been}} assumed that the Scottish political leadership sacrificed all other considerations in order to pursue an unrealistic religious crusade. This article suggests that aspects of the Anglo-Scottish relationship need to be reappraised. Using estimates of English payments to the Scots during the 1640 s, it will be argued that the Scottish leadership made pragmatic political decisions based on a practical appreciation of the country's military and fiscal capacity. Substantial payouts from the English parliament enabled the Scottish parliamentary regime to engage in military and diplomatic activities that the country could not otherwise have afforded. The 1643 treaty that brought the Scots into the English Civil War on the side of parliament contrasts favourably with the 1647 Engagement in support of the king. It will be shown that, although the English parliament did not <b>honour</b> all <b>of</b> its <b>obligations</b> to the Scots, it does not automatically follow that the alliance was a failure in financial terms...|$|R

40|$|This Master thesis {{deals with}} the {{comparison}} of trade relationships <b>of</b> <b>obligation</b> in Germany and the Czech Republic. In order to introduce and analyse the topic thoroughly at first the main legal acts connected with relationships <b>of</b> <b>obligation</b> and trade relationships <b>of</b> <b>obligations</b> in both compared countries are being introduced. The main stress is put {{on the content of}} these legal acts, on their historical development, their application methods as well as on their mutual relationship. The next part of this Master thesis then explains the term trade relationship <b>of</b> <b>obligation</b> with respect to the definitions obtained in both compared legal systems. After the theoretical introduction the general legal regulation of the trade relationships <b>of</b> <b>obligation</b> is being characterised. Since the general legal regulation of the trade relationships <b>of</b> <b>obligation</b> is based on the general legal regulation of the relationships <b>of</b> <b>obligation</b> at first the differences between these two legal regulations in Germany are explained. After that the German general legal regulation of trade relationships <b>of</b> <b>obligation</b> is being compared with the Czech general legal regulation of this area. After the characterisation of the general legal regulation of the trade relationships <b>of</b> <b>obligation</b> the individual types of German trade relationships <b>of</b> <b>obligation</b> are being compared with their equivalents in the Czech legal system. The specific trade relationships <b>of</b> <b>obligation</b> that are being analysed and compared in both legal systems are namely contract with a commission agent, contract of consignment, forwarding contract and storage contract...|$|R

5000|$|Article 55 of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China prescribes {{conscription}} by stating: [...] "It is {{a sacred}} duty of every citizen of the People's Republic of China to defend his or her motherland and resist invasion. It is an <b>honoured</b> <b>obligation</b> <b>of</b> {{the citizens of the}} People's Republic of China to perform military service and to join the militia forces." [...] the 1984 Military Service Law spells out the legal basis of conscription, describing military service as a duty for [...] "all citizens without distinction of race... and religious creed". This law has not been amended since it came into effect. Conscription has only existed officially since the establishment of the People's Republic in 1949, and, theoretically, all Chinese citizens have had the duty of performing military service. Technically, those 18-22 years of age enter selective compulsory military service, with a 24-month service obligation. This includes 18-19 years of age for female high-school graduates who meet requirements for specific military jobs. Military service is normally performed in the regular armed forces, but the 1984 law does allow for conscription into the reserve forces. Residents of the Hong Kong and Macau SAR however, as of 1997 and 1999 are exempted from joining the military.|$|R
