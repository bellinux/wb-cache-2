40|$|This article {{investigates the}} {{specification}} of discount window borrowing. The author establishes empirically that the borrowing function is heteroskedastic and nonlinear. Subsequently, he proceeds {{to propose a}} simple theoretical framework that generates endogenously these anomalies. In particular, the author demonstrates that such phenomena are precipitated by the response of depository institutions to <b>discount</b> <b>credit</b> rationing and Federal Reserve collateral limitations.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present an {{integrated}} model of accounts receivable. The model incorporates the major components of credit and collection policies such as the cash <b>discount,</b> <b>credit</b> period and charges for late payments. It considers the investment in accounts receivable, losses from bad debts and the impact of credit terms on sales. The objective is to maximize the present value of net earnings from accounts receivable. After deriving the general model, a simplified version is solved by classical optimization techniques under various sets of assumptions that are gradually relaxed. ...|$|E

30|$|In today’s {{business}} era, {{retailers have}} the dominant power of controlling or affecting another member’s decision in a supply chain. A retailer {{has the ability}} to offer an effective promotional effect such as price <b>discount,</b> <b>credit</b> period etc. The retailers often try to stimulate the demand by offering price discounts. Price discounts could improve economic benefits to consumers and influence consumers’ beliefs about the brand which will increase consumers’ purchase intentions. In real life, there are situations in which the retailer announces price discount offers to the customers who can commit their orders before the selling period. Due to the booming in IT, customers can easily commit their orders prior to selling period and the estimation error in demand can also be reduced. This situation is adopted more in the selling of musical disks, apparel, video games, or books. In dairy product manufacturing scheme prior to selling season, the retailer offers price discount to the customers who register their orders via email or phone call etc.|$|E
30|$|Zhang et al. (2014 a) {{investigated}} a manufacturer–retailer {{supply chain}} where the manufacturer is risk averse and delivers lower {{amount of the}} retailer’s order quantity when the retailer has a delay in payments. In this situation, they proposed a modified quantity discount in which the manufacturer induces the retailer to increase its order quantity while having an advanced payment. Heydari (2014) proposed a time-based temporary price discount coordination plan for a two-echelon SC, in which the seller tries to induce the buyer to globally optimize safety stock. Yin et al. (2014) developed a game theoretic model to help a manufacturer for supplier selection and having a long-term relationship using a quantity discount coordination scheme. Yang et al. (2014) discussed about three plans: quantity <b>discount,</b> <b>credit</b> period and centralized SC in a two-echelon system consisting of one manufacturer and one retailer where demand depends on stock level of the retailer. The authors showed that the credit period contract is preferred to induce the retailer to increase its order quantity when the manufacturer interest rate {{is less than the}} retailer interest rate. In that model, irrespective of interest rates, centralized decision making result in equal or higher SC profit than two other ones.|$|E
40|$|Recent {{improvements}} in fiscal positions in advanced countries have sharply curtailed {{the issuance of}} government securities and created the possibility that government securities could disappear in some countries. The possibility that this might occur in the United States has attracted the most attention, {{in large part because}} of the international role of the U. S. dollar and the widespread perception that U. S. treasury securities have the lowest total financial risk (the combination of credit, market, and liquidity risks) among U. S. dollar assets. This paper analyzes the unique features of government securities and links them to the important roles that government securities, in particular U. S. treasury securities, have come to play in national and international financial markets. The paper then identifies and examines financial market-oriented public policy questions raised by the shrinking supply of U. S. treasuries.
