50|$|In 2000, the Chimpanzee Health <b>Improvement,</b> <b>Maintenance,</b> and Protection (CHIMP) Act {{was signed}} into law, authorizing the {{retirement}} of chimpanzees in research who were “not needed.” More than a decade later, roughly 900 chimpanzees remained in U.S. labs {{and the vast majority}} were not being used.

The Act stipulated that the government would pay 75 percent of the operating cost and 90 percent of the construction funds for the sanctuary system. The organization chosen to run the system would have to raise the remainder of the funding from private sources.|$|E

50|$|On 22 January 2013, an NIH {{task force}} {{released}} a report calling {{for the government to}} retire most of the chimpanzees under U.S. government support. The panel concluded that the animals provide little benefit in biomedical discoveries except in a few disease cases which can be supported by a small population of 50 primates for future research. It suggested that other approaches, such as genetically altered mice, should be developed and refined instead. On 13 November 2013, Congress and the Senate passed ‘The Chimpanzee Health <b>Improvement,</b> <b>Maintenance</b> and Protection Act’, which approved funding to expand the capacity of Chimp Haven and other chimpanzee sanctuaries, allowing for the transfer of almost all of the apes owned by the federal government to live in a more natural and group environment.

50|$|In {{response}} to {{the decline of the}} horse racing industry, the Illinois Legislature passed the Act in 2006. Major findings were that riverboat gaming has had a negative impact on horse racing. From 1992, the first full year of riverboat operations, through 2005, Illinois on-track wagering has decreased by 42% from $835 million to $482 million. Further, the Act found that the decrease in wagering had had a negative effect on the purses at the tracks, {{as well as on the}} state’s breeding industry, which could be remedied by requiring that the riverboat casinos contribute a portion of their revenues to the competition. The Act specifically requires that any casino with adjusted gross receipts of over $200 million in 2004 must pay daily 3% of their adjusted gross receipts into the Horse Racing Equity Trust Fund. Distribution of the Fund would then be made to the horse racing tracks to be spent as follows: 60% for purses; and 40% for track <b>improvement,</b> <b>maintenance</b> and to otherwise operate the facility. The Illinois Racing Board would monitor how the funds are distributed, but not how the tracks actually spend the money. In essence, the track operators would have complete discretion on at least 40% of the money. The Act’s payment obligation was to cease in May 2008; however in November 2008, the Legislature extended the payments for an additional three years.|$|E
