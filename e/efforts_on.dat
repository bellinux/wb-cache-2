40|$|This article {{examines}} the effects of intellectual property rights (IPR) protection on growth and convergence. Firms in a country undertake both innovation and imitation to improve their productivity. IPR protection reduces the cost of innovation, but makes imitation more costly. Countries at early stages of growth adopt a strategy of high <b>effort</b> <b>on</b> imitation, and switch to the strategy of high <b>effort</b> <b>on</b> innovation at some point. A higher degree of IPR protection makes the switch to the strategy of high <b>effort</b> <b>on</b> innovation earlier. There are two possible growth traps. A middle-income trap arises when a country fails to switch to high <b>effort</b> <b>on</b> innovation due to a low degree of IPR protection. Whereas a poverty trap may exist at the early stage of development, {{when there is no}} enough <b>effort</b> <b>on</b> imitation due to a strict IPR protection. innovation, imitation, intellectual property rights, convergence, traps,...|$|R

40|$|International audienceWe use {{a unique}} and {{confidential}} database of 15, 392 tax audits performed by the Croatian Tax Administration during the 2002 – 2006 period to {{examine the impact of}} task complexity, auditor experience, and auditor <b>effort</b> <b>on</b> audit performance. We provide external validation to prior experimental and analytical research showing that task complexity decreases while auditor experience and effort increase audit performance. We also extend this literature by examining the roles of task complexity and experience in moderating the impact of the <b>effort</b> <b>on</b> audit performance. We find that task complexity mitigates, while experience enhances the positive relationship between auditor effort and performance. However, we also find that auditor experience reinforces the positive effect of auditor <b>effort</b> <b>on</b> performance to a greater degree when complexity is high. Taken together, our findings provide new evidence on how audit and auditor characteristics impact audit performance, and new insight into how task complexity and auditor experience separately and jointly moderate the impact of auditor <b>effort</b> <b>on</b> performance...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} how tennis players can optimize their {{chance of winning}} a match by using strategies to utilize their energy resources. This {{can be achieved by}} either increasing <b>effort</b> <b>on</b> certain points, games and sets in a match, or by increasing and decreasing effort about an overall mean. The results show that increasing <b>effort</b> <b>on</b> any point in a game before deuce is reached has the same effect on the player’s chances of winning the game. By increasing <b>effort</b> <b>on</b> the important points and decreasing <b>effort</b> <b>on</b> the unimportant points in a game, players can increase their chances of winning a game. For the better player, this gain {{is a result of the}} variability about the mean and also the importance of points.
