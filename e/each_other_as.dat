5|$|Lacaille gave {{twelve stars}} Bayer designations, {{labelling}} them Alpha through to Kappa, including two stars next to <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>as</b> Delta and another two stars near <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>as</b> Kappa. Within the constellation's borders, there are 39 stars brighter {{than or equal}} to apparent magnitude6.5. Beta, Gamma and Delta Apodis form a narrow triangle, with Alpha Apodis lying to the east. The five brightest stars are all red-tinged, which is unusual among constellations.|$|E

5|$|Borga {{suffered}} a legit ankle injury, however, {{and was replaced}} by Bam Bam Bigelow. Although the substitution took place shortly before the event, Bigelow and Tatanka also had a heated rivalry. In 1993, Bigelow had cut Tatanka's dyed red hair as an insult to his Lumbee heritage. The two faced <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>as</b> part of a six-man match at SummerSlam 1993, but the feud continued even after Tatanka's team emerged victorious.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, the {{decision}} was taken that its work should continue and that alumni of the Hall should have an effective mechanism {{to keep in touch}} with the Manor Hall and <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> <b>As</b> such the Association was brought out of abeyance in December 2007 with Christopher Didcote acting as its first Chairman.|$|E

All the guests are enjoying dinner except for the Van Houtens, who argue with <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>as</b> Milhouse plays in another room with Bart and the other children.

5|$|Margunn Bjørnholt and Ailsa McKay {{argue that}} the {{financial}} crisis of 2007–08 and the response to it revealed a crisis of ideas in mainstream economics and within the economics profession, and call for a reshaping of both the economy, economic theory and the economics profession. They argue that such a reshaping should include new advances within feminist economics that take as their starting point the socially responsible, sensible and accountable subject in creating an economy and economic theories that fully acknowledge care for <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>as</b> well as the planet.|$|E

5|$|Since {{then the}} role that {{telecommunications}} has played in social relations has become increasingly important. In recent years, the popularity of social networking sites has increased dramatically. These sites allow users to communicate with <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>as</b> well as post photographs, events and profiles for others to see. The profiles can list a person's age, interests, sexual preference and relationship status. In this way, these sites can play important role in everything from organising social engagements to courtship.|$|E
5|$|St Peter's {{is made up}} {{of three}} parts, {{including}} a mid-19th-century west tower, which replaced the original in 1859–60 after it fell down. The perpendicular clerestory is decorated with shields in quatrefoils and is lit with closely set three-light windows. The tall decorated chancel has very large windows. The side windows have reticulated tracery. The large east window was partly rebuilt in 1875–76, and is composed of six lights with two large mouchettes nodding to <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> <b>as</b> well as a very large reticulation unit.|$|E

5|$|The basic, local {{organisational}} unit of Freemasonry is the Lodge. The Lodges are usually supervised and governed {{at the regional}} level (usually coterminous with either a state, province, or national border) by a Grand Lodge or Grand Orient. There is no international, worldwide Grand Lodge that supervises all of Freemasonry; each Grand Lodge is independent, {{and they do not}} necessarily recognise <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>as</b> being legitimate.|$|E
5|$|The {{gravitational}} attraction that masses {{have for}} one another decreases inversely with {{the square of the}} distance of those masses from <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> <b>As</b> a result, the slightly greater attraction that the Moon has for the side of Earth closest to the Moon, as compared to the part of the Earth opposite the Moon, results in tidal forces. Tidal forces affect both the Earth's crust and oceans.|$|E
5|$|To {{maintain}} control and improve administration, various schemes {{to divide the}} work of the Roman Emperor by sharing it between individuals were tried between 285 and 324, from 337 to 350, from 364 to 392, and again between 395 and 480. Although the administrative subdivisions varied, they generally involved a division of labour between East and West. Each division was a form of power-sharing (or even job-sharing), for the ultimate imperium was not divisible and therefore the empire remained legally one state—although the co-emperors often saw <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>as</b> rivals or enemies.|$|E
