50|$|Polyptychoceras shells have {{an abrupt}} weight {{increase}} after {{formation of the}} initial shaft, which represents the shell's automatic balance condition. This would have caused the shell to topple over if on land. The soft body of the animal {{would have to have}} been large, {{in order to keep the}} <b>falling</b> <b>shaft</b> off of the ground. The body would not have been resistant to the pressing shell.|$|R
60|$|A half-mile {{from the}} main road, which seemed to him to have dropped out of sight the moment he had left it, he came upon a half-cleared area, where the hastily-cut stumps of pines, of {{irregular}} height, bore an odd resemblance to the broken columns of some vast and ruined temple. A few <b>fallen</b> <b>shafts,</b> denuded of their bark and tessellated branches, sawn into symmetrical cylinders, lay beside the stumps, and lent themselves to the illusion. But the freshly-cut chips, so damp that they still clung in layers {{to each other as}} they had fallen from the axe, and the stumps themselves, still wet and viscous from their drained life-blood, were redolent of an odor of youth and freshness.|$|R
60|$|A {{magnificent}} city, of {{an architecture}} {{with which he}} was unacquainted, offered to his entranced vision its gorgeous ruins and deserted splendour; long streets of palaces, with their rich line of lessening pillars, here and there broken by some <b>fallen</b> <b>shaft,</b> vast courts surrounded by ornate and solemn temples, and luxurious baths adorned with rare mosaics, and yet bright with antique gilding; now an arch of triumph, still haughty with its broken friezes; now a granite obelisk covered with strange characters, and proudly towering over a prostrate companion; sometimes a void and crumbling theatre, sometimes a long and elegant aqueduct, sometimes a porphyry column, once breathing with the heroic statue that now lies shivered at its base, all suffused with the warm twilight of an eastern eve.|$|R

6000|$|... "And mind 'ee, don't {{go off the}} road, sur," [...] shouted Maggot, a {{few seconds}} after {{the young man had}} left him, [...] "if 'ee don't want to <b>fall</b> down a <b>shaft</b> and scat your skull." ...|$|R
50|$|Trompes can be enormous. At Canadian Hydro Developers' Ragged Chute {{facility}} in New Liskeard, Ontario, water <b>falls</b> down a <b>shaft</b> 351 ft deep and 9 ft across to generate compressed air for mining equipment and ventilation.|$|R
50|$|Following the {{disaster}} mining resumed, however the yield from the mine continued to decline. Following a substantial rock <b>fall</b> in the <b>shaft</b> in 1908 {{it was decided}} that the clearance of the debris would prove to be uneconomical and the mine was closed.|$|R
50|$|The {{shaft lining}} {{performs}} several functions; it {{is first and}} foremost a safety feature preventing loose or unstable rock from <b>falling</b> into the <b>shaft,</b> then a place for shaft sets to bolt into and lastly a smooth surface to minimise resistance to airflow for ventilation.|$|R
50|$|Monk quickly hands Randy the nametag he {{snatched}} from Murdoch. No sooner has Randy read Murdoch's name {{when there is}} a scream as Murdoch <b>falls</b> down a <b>shaft</b> to his death. Stottlemeyer and Disher identify him, and Randy suggests that Murdoch slipped while trying to escape.|$|R
50|$|Yield {{continued}} to be below expectations, and following a major rock <b>fall</b> in the <b>shaft</b> in 1908 it was deemed {{that the cost of}} making good the damage was greater than the value of the company. The mine was therefore closed and the company was wound up.|$|R
5000|$|Years later, Patema is a {{respected}} teenager {{who lives in}} an underground society - Aiga- which imposes rules to keep its members away from [...] "danger zones" [...] that surround the community. Inspired by her friend Lagos, who has mysteriously disappeared, Patema explores the tunnels. One day, she is startled by a figure that walks on the ceiling while exploring and <b>falls</b> into the <b>shaft</b> below.|$|R
60|$|His {{father had}} been a shaft-sinker, earning good money, but had been killed by a <b>fall</b> down the <b>shaft</b> when Aaron was only four years old. The widow had opened a shop: Aaron was her only child. She had done well in her shop. She had wanted Aaron to be a schoolteacher. He had served three years apprenticeship, then {{suddenly}} thrown it up and gone to the pit.|$|R
50|$|There is a {{proposal}} to build a 480 megawatt combined wind farm-hydroelectric facility at this location which could contribute towards the county's goal of becoming self-sufficient in energy supply. The project would use wind turbines to pump sea water up to energy storage {{in the form of}} reservoirs on Glinsk Mountain. When required, the reservoirs would feed power generating turbines by allowing the water to <b>fall</b> down a <b>shaft</b> back to the ocean.|$|R
6000|$|... "What, {{is there}} honour among pigs?" [...] said Chaka. [...] "Then I will settle it. See this assegai? I throw {{it into the}} air; if the blade falls {{uppermost}} the tall man shall go free; if the <b>shaft</b> <b>falls</b> uppermost, then life is to the short one, so!" [...] And he sent the little spear whirling round and round in the air. Every eye watched it as it wheeled and fell. The haft struck the ground first.|$|R
60|$|Here, also, the handiwork of man lay ruined: but {{the plants}} were all alive and thriving; the view below was fresh with the colours of nature; {{and we had}} {{exchanged}} a dim, human garret for a corner, even although it were untidy, of the blue hall of heaven. Not a bird, not a beast, not a reptile. There was no noise {{in that part of}} the world, save when we passed beside the staging, and heard the water musically <b>falling</b> in the <b>shaft.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{elevator}} doors {{open to reveal}} the private apartments of Harrison Hightower, the idol sitting {{on a table in}} the center. Hightower, under a ghostly form, glowing blue, appears beside it and reaches out to touch it. The idol zaps him with a bolt of green electricity, blasting him backwards past open {{elevator doors}} {{at the opposite end of}} the apartments, where Hightower <b>falls</b> down the <b>shaft,</b> which then fades away, replaced by a star field. The idol turns toward the guests' elevator and laughs before the doors close.|$|R
60|$|Will and Hans {{knocked down}} the {{foremost}} of their assailants; {{and the whole}} body, foiled in their attempted surprise, discomfited at {{the appearance of the}} strange white-faced men, and exposed to the arrows of the defenders, at once darted away--several of their number having already <b>fallen,</b> under the <b>shafts</b> from above. With exulting shouts, the warriors of the village poured down their ladders from the huts, and took up the pursuit; and soon no one remained in the village, save the white lads and the women and children.|$|R
60|$|Joseph {{halted the}} young man just within the doorway, cautioning him against the danger of <b>falling</b> into the <b>shaft,</b> then he closed the panel, {{and a moment later}} had found the lantern he had hidden there and lighted it. The rays {{disclosed}} to the American the rough masonry of the interior of a narrow, well-built shaft. A rude ladder standing upon a narrow ledge beside him extended upward to lose itself in the shadows above. At its foot the top of another ladder was visible protruding through the opening from the floor beneath.|$|R

6000|$|Something had happened. What? [...] "Nothing" [...] (the {{speaker is}} fluent, but uneasy)--"one of the gentlemen, {{in trying to}} {{dislodge}} a 'specimen' from the wall, had knocked away a support. There had been a 'cave'--the gentleman was caught, and buried below his shoulders. It was all right, they'd get him out in a moment--only it required great care to keep from extending the 'cave.' Didn't know his name. It was that little man, the husband of that lively lady with the black eyes. Eh! Hullo, there! Stop her! For God's sake! Not that way! She'll <b>fall</b> from that <b>shaft.</b> She'll be killed!" ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{internal}} lift of {{the building}} is clearly audible, and Clegg surveys Klein's movements, when he arrives. She interrupts his inspections when {{he is about to}} open the roof door. She takes him to the lift, sending him downwards. However, just as she is talking him off, she sees Waxman sitting on top of the lift car. He mounts a bomb on the lift car and, when the car begins moving, nearly <b>falls</b> down the <b>shaft.</b> He is saved by Clegg, and they both attempt keeping up the [...] "just business"-facade, although some romantic appreciation is apparent.|$|R
50|$|Fell Beck is {{a stream}} {{located near the}} foot of Ingleborough, in the Yorkshire Dales National Park. It is notable {{for the fact that}} it runs into Gaping Gill, the second-largest natural cave shaft in the UK (after Titan). As it <b>falls</b> down the <b>shaft</b> for 110 metres it is the tallest {{unbroken}} waterfall in the UK. It later emerges as Clapham Beck in Beck Head Cave. This was proven by fluorescent dye tests many years ago, but only confirmed by cave divers in the 1983. At times it is blocked off by a temporary dam to allow members of the public to descend the shaft on a winch.|$|R
50|$|Abîmes are a {{structure}} which form {{late in the}} life of a limestone cave. They can be 1-10 meters in diameter and up to 50 meters in height vertically. The walls have grooves that serve as a contrast to the smooth nature of the rest of the cave. They are known to lie under heads of stream valleys, sinkholes, or along non-carbonated rocks. Water will occasionally <b>fall</b> down the <b>shaft,</b> creating subterranean waterfalls. Only a small portion of the abîme connects to the rest of the cavern. They can extend to the present water table, while the rest of the cavern lies above it.|$|R
5000|$|He {{joins the}} third {{incarnation}} of the Suicide Squad and apparently dies on his first mission alongside Killer Frost, Putty, Eliza and Larvanaut. He <b>falls</b> through a <b>shaft,</b> breaks his leg and is attacked by killer ants. He is seen dead {{in the hands of}} Killer Frost. [...] He later turns up alive again in the pages of Identity Crisis #1 and is badly injured by two street kids, suffering a punctured lung and two punctured kidneys. [...] He has since joined The Society. His seemingly miraculous resurrections have been noted by other characters, mostly notably during his recovery from his gunfire related injuries.|$|R
6000|$|For {{a moment}} he stood almost erect, and then {{collapsed}} suddenly into his chair. [...] "Devine has a brain of another and very much lower order, though it is of a kind that is apt to prove more useful to its possessor, and in his own sphere {{there are very few}} men to equal him. If I do not <b>fall</b> down the <b>shaft</b> in the meanwhile, we will certainly show this province what we can do together. And now I believe it is advisable for me to go to bed, while I feel to some extent capable of reaching it. My head is at least as clear as usual, but my legs are unruly." ...|$|R
50|$|They {{realize that}} the vines contain an acidic sap that burns their hands after they pulled the vines away from Heinrich's body. At {{the top of the}} hill is a camp with tents, a campfire and {{windlass}} and rope that leads down a mine shaft. Much of the camp is overgrown with the same acidic vines. Hearing the ring of a cell phone from the bottom of the shaft, they use the rope to lower Pablo down in an attempt to retrieve it. However, the acid from the vines has weakened the rope, which snaps, sending Pablo <b>falling</b> down the <b>shaft.</b> His back is broken and the group raises him on a makeshift backboard.|$|R
60|$|He {{was found}} {{at the bottom of}} a {{detached}} shaft which had been sunk and abandoned at the commencement of the work for the new electric railway near Baker Street Station. His arm and leg and two ribs were broken. The shaft is protected by a hoarding nearly 20 feet high, and over this, incredible as it seems, Mr. Bessel, a stout, middle-aged gentleman, must have scrambled in order to <b>fall</b> down the <b>shaft.</b> He was saturated in colza oil, and the smashed tin lay beside him, but luckily the flame had been extinguished by his fall. And his madness had passed from him altogether. But he was, of course, terribly enfeebled, and at the sight of his rescuers he gave way to hysterical weeping.|$|R
30|$|An {{objective}} of this step is rough positioning of a ring part to a shaft part. Firstly, the robotic manipulator picks up a ring part from a feeder. Then, the robotic manipulator approaches the shaft part and releases the ring part on the shaft part. In this case of precise assembly of a ring part, the assembly cannot succeed because a clearance between a ring part and a shaft part disappears by deformation of the ring part. Therefore, the ring part is released once. On the other hand, if the positional difference between the ring part and the shaft part is large, the ring part <b>falls</b> from a <b>shaft</b> part. Therefore, {{it is assumed that}} the robotic manipulator is controlled with possible accuracy.|$|R
50|$|Eddie and Rock's personalities clash {{many times}} during the trip to Camp Lejeune. When they reach their destination, they {{discover}} that the prisoner they are transporting is a pretty young woman, Toni Johnson (Erika Eleniak). However, they soon discover that taking her back is no easy job when she attempts to escape disguised as a waitress at a diner but is caught. Later, she feigns the onset of her period and puts tampons inside the van's gas tank {{which leads to the}} van being stalled in the road. While walking, the trio come across an abandoned mine and accidentally <b>fall</b> down the <b>shaft.</b> They try to get out standing on each other's shoulders. Toni gets out first, ditches them and runs away but has a change of heart later and comes back for them.|$|R
50|$|Consumed with curiosity, Jill enters Abe's house {{through an}} open window while he's out and finds incriminating notes. Jill confronts Abe and accuses him of the murder. Abe then admits his guilt and {{explains}} his motive. Jill decides to break off their relationship but promises not to turn him in. However, after an innocent man is accused of the crime, she presses Abe {{to go to the}} police, warning him that otherwise she will report him. Abe, who has only recently started enjoying life, is determined to stay out of jail. He attempts to kill Jill by pushing her into an elevator shaft, but, instead, he stumbles backward and <b>falls</b> down the <b>shaft</b> to his death. Jill then begins repairing her life. Her first step is to reconcile with Roy.|$|R
60|$|I {{spoke of}} the {{underground}} Virginia as a city. The Gould and Curry is only one single mine under there, among a great many others; yet the Gould and Curry's streets of dismal drifts and tunnels were five miles in extent, altogether, and its population five hundred miners. Taken as a whole, the underground city had some thirty miles of streets and a population {{of five or six}} thousand. In this present day some of those populations are at work from twelve to sixteen hundred feet under Virginia and Gold Hill, and the signal-bells that tell them what the superintendent above ground desires them to do are struck by telegraph as we strike a fire alarm. Sometimes men <b>fall</b> down a <b>shaft,</b> there, a thousand feet deep. In such cases, the usual plan is to hold an inquest.|$|R
50|$|The {{most notable}} United States {{architectural}} innovation {{has been the}} skyscraper. Several technical advances made this possible. In 1853 Elisha Otis invented the first safety elevator which prevented a car from <b>falling</b> down the <b>shaft</b> if the suspending cable broke. Elevators allowed buildings {{to rise above the}} four or five stories that people were willing to climb by stairs for normal occupancy. An 1868 competition decided the design of New York City's six story Equitable Life Building, which would become the first commercial building to use an elevator. Construction commenced in 1873. Other structures followed such as the Auditorium Building, Chicago in 1885 by Dankmar Adler and Louis Sullivan. This adopted Italian palazzo design details to give the appearance of a structured whole: for several decades American skyscrapers would blend conservative decorative elements with technical innovation.|$|R
50|$|The {{music video}} {{features}} Matt Bellamy {{standing on a}} ledge then the song begins as he leaps and begins <b>falling</b> through a <b>shaft</b> in space. The shaft looks {{to be on a}} space station possibly on an abandoned planet, but the clear technology looks to be futuristic and well beyond what exists at this time. The other band members can be seen throughout the video watching Matt Bellamy as he falls each in their own pods along the shaft that Matt Bellamy is falling through. As the song reaches its climax he exits the shaft into space and towards what looks like a nebula or a star's photo-sphere. At that point, the light causes him to fade out as he begins to turn into dust as he edges closer to a white light and the song fades out.|$|R
5000|$|Elevator doors protect riders from <b>falling</b> {{into the}} <b>shaft.</b> The most common {{configuration}} {{is to have}} two panels that meet in the middle, and slide open laterally. In a cascading telescopic configuration (potentially allowing wider entryways within limited space), the doors roll on independent tracks so that while open, they are tucked behind one another, and while closed, they form cascading layers on one side. This can be configured so that two sets of such cascading doors operate like the center opening doors described above, allowing for a very wide elevator cab. In less expensive installations the elevator can also use one large [...] "slab" [...] door: a single panel door {{the width of the}} doorway that opens to the left or right laterally. Some buildings have elevators with the single door on the shaft way, and double cascading doors on the cab.|$|R
6000|$|... "As to {{the danger}} which attends so great a descent, I have {{thoroughly}} provided against that. In fact, I do not see, if I carry out my plans, how there could be any danger, more than constantly surrounds us, {{no matter what we}} are doing. In the first place, we should not think of that great depth. If a man fell down any one of the deep shafts in our silver mines, he would be as thoroughly deprived of life as if he should <b>fall</b> down my <b>shaft.</b> But to <b>fall</b> down mine--and I want you to consider this, Margaret, and thoroughly understand it--would be almost impossible. I have planned out all the machinery and appliances which would be necessary, and I want to describe them to you, and then, I am sure, you will see for yourself that the element of danger is more fully eliminated than if I should row you on the lake in a little boat." ...|$|R
