This unique type of overdub was a one-time experiment that Zappa never repeated. Hungarian composer Péter Eötvös said in an interview:"Dangerous Kitchen", off the album [...] "The Man From Utopia", grew to become a basic piece for me, especially in later years, after I began working on operas. The technique that he uses in this particular song is very interesting: it's this half-sung, half-spoken performing method that's not quite like Sprechgesang, but what makes it so interesting is that he accompanies it with an instrumental solo. I was very surprised to find out that the guitar part was recorded separately. As it seemed so synchronous, I was convinced that Zappa had sung and played at the same time. Nevertheless the technique itself, the idea of [...] "the singing instrument" [...] comes from [...] "Dangerous Kitchen".|$|R

40|$|AbstractIf {{there were}} no express {{provisions}} in the charter party as to seaworthiness or a ship owner's obligation to exercise reasonable dispatch, there is an implied obligation in common law. At other times, {{in the absence of}} an express term, the right to nominate a port does not give rise to a correlative warranty on the nomination to a safe port. Likewise, a change of circumstances occurring after the conclusion of the contract may be sufficient to <b>discharge</b> the <b>parties</b> from further performance of their contract. In common law, the shipper has an implied obligation to inform the ship owner on the dangerous nature of the shipped goods. Last but not least, whether the owner of the vessel operates a liner service or a under a charter undertakes that his vessel, while performing its obligations under the contract of carriage, will not deviate from the contract of carriage. Based on theoretical and jurisprudential aspects, this article aims to analyze the consequences of the ship owner's breach of the contract, the implications of express liberty clauses, and where appropriate, the Hague-Visby Rules incorporation effect.

25|$|Sanity is a rebuttable {{presumption}} and {{the burden of}} proof is on the party denying it; the standard of proof is on a balance of probabilities, that is to say that mental incapacity is more likely than not. If this burden is successfully <b>discharged,</b> the <b>party</b> relying upon it is entitled to succeed. In Lord Denning's judgement in Bratty v Attorney-General for Northern Ireland 1963 AC 386, whenever the defendant makes an issue of his state of mind, the prosecution can adduce evidence of insanity. However, this will normally only arise to negate the defence case when automatism or diminished responsibility is in issue. In practical terms, the defence {{will be more likely to}} raise the issue of mental incapacity to negate or minimise criminal liability. In R v Clarke 1972 1 All E R 219 a defendant charged with a shoplifting claimed she had no mens rea because she had absent-mindedly walked out of the shop without paying because she suffered from depression. When the prosecution attempted to adduce evidence that this constituted insanity within the Rules, she changed her plea to guilty, but on appeal the Court ruled that she had been merely denying mens rea rather than raising a defence under the Rules and her conviction was quashed. The general rule was stated that the Rules apply only to cases in which the defect of reason is substantial.|$|R

40|$|Extract: This text is a {{study of}} the tumultuous {{doctrine}} of subrogation. The doctrine of marshalling of securities, which is based on subrogation, will be treated in a separate text. Chapter 1 emphasises the distinction between subrogation and assignment. Chapter 2 examines the right of subrogation to the trustee 2 ̆ 7 s right of indemnity. The importance, in practice, of the distinc¬ tion between the trustee 2 ̆ 7 s right of exoneration and the trustee 2 ̆ 7 s right of reimbursement is also discussed in this chapter. Chapter 3 addresses the insurer 2 ̆ 7 s right of subrogation. It examines the discrete situations where the insurer 2 ̆ 7 s right of subrogation is enlivened. Chapter 4 deals with those situations where the right of subrogation vests in a person (other than a surety) who <b>discharges</b> a third <b>party</b> 2 ̆ 7 s debt to a secured creditor. It also examines the right of subrogation of a surety who discharges the principal debtor 2 ̆ 7 s debt to the secured creditor. Chapter 5 examines the right of subrogation of a putative lender who purports to lend money to an ultra vires borrower who then uses the proceeds of the putative loan to discharge its intra vires debts. Chapter 6 discusses those situations where a third party payer does not have any right to be subrogated to the (former) right of the payee against the debtor...|$|R
60|$|Then, indeed, {{the long}} {{practice}} of Deerslayer, as a hunter did him good service. Accustomed to fire with the deer on the bound, and often when the precise {{position of the}} animal's body had in a manner to be guessed at, he used the same expedients here. To cock and poise his rifle were the acts of a single moment and a single motion: then aiming almost without sighting, he fired into the bushes where he knew a body ought to be, in order to sustain the appalling countenance which alone was visible. There was not time to raise the piece any higher, or {{to take a more}} deliberate aim. So rapid were his movements that both <b>parties</b> <b>discharged</b> their pieces at the same instant, the concussions mingling in one report. The mountains, indeed, gave back but a single echo. Deerslayer dropped his piece, and stood with head erect, steady as one of the pines in the calm of a June morning, watching the result; while the savage gave the yell that has become historical for its appalling influence, leaped through the bushes, and came bounding across the open ground, flourishing a tomahawk. Still Deerslayer moved not, but stood with his unloaded rifle fallen against his shoulders, while, with a hunter's habits, his hands were mechanically feeling for the powder-horn and charger. When about forty feet from his enemy, the savage hurled his keen weapon; but it was with an eye so vacant, and a hand so unsteady and feeble, that the young man caught it by the handle as it was flying past him. At that instant the Indian staggered and fell his whole length on the ground.|$|R
60|$|The horses of {{the army}} and of the royal stables were no longer shy, having been daily led before me; and one of the Emperor's huntsmen, on a large courser, took my foot, shoe and all, which was indeed a prodigious leap. I amused the Emperor one day in a very {{extraordinary}} manner. I took nine sticks, and fixed them firmly in the ground in a square. Then I took four other sticks, and tied them parallel at each corner, about two feet from the ground. I fastened my handkerchief to the nine sticks that stood erect, and extended it on all sides till it was as tight as the top of a drum; and I desired the Emperor to let a troop of his best horse, twenty-four in number, come and exercise upon this plain. His majesty approved of the proposal, and I took them up one by one, with the proper officers to exercise them. As soon as they got into order they divided into two <b>parties,</b> <b>discharged</b> blunt arrows, drew their swords, fled and pursued, and, in short, showed the best military discipline I ever beheld. The parallel sticks secured them and their horses from falling off the stage, and the Emperor was so much delighted that he ordered this entertainment to be repeated several days, and persuaded the Empress herself to let me hold her in her chair within two yards of the stage, whence she could view the whole performance. Fortunately no accident happened, only once a fiery horse, pawing with his hoof, struck a hole in my handkerchief, and overthrew his rider and himself. But I immediately relieved them both, and covering the hole with one hand, I set down the troop with the other as I had taken them up. The horse that fell was strained in the shoulder; but the rider was not hurt, and I repaired my handkerchief as well as I could. However, I would not trust to the strength of it any more in such dangerous enterprises.|$|R
40|$| {{determined}} by its performance, {{and this was}} the ruling view in the German science of law {{since the end of the}} 19 th Century. Windscheid’s conclusion, that a debtor can be replaced by a third party without canceling the obligation, was generally accepted. This development allowed for the transfer of a liability, in the meaning of singular succession of a debt, to be recognized in the German science of law before the end of the 19 th Century. It was recognized that replacing the debtor might have an influence on the ability to collect on the claim. For this reason a change of debtor can not take place without the cooperation of the creditor. This issue provoked the question in German science of law, whether a creditor shall be a party to the transfer of the liability, or whether it suffices for him to consent to the transfer (the decision theory). Following custom as it existed in practice, most legal authors deemed that cooperation of the creditor could be limited to providing his consent to an agreement between original debtor and declared debtor. German Law concurred with this view in § 415 BGB. The agreement to transfer the liability, according to § 415 BGB, can be entered into by original debtor and declared debtor and becomes effective if the creditor provides his consent. By providing this consent, the creditor does not become a party to the agreement, according to German law. Separately, § 414 BGB provides that a transfer of a liability can also be effected by an agreement between the creditor and the declared debtor. In practice this type of agreement is less important. Although the Dutch science of law followed its German counterpart in paying attention to the doctrine of liability transfer, there was no true debate on the question whether a transfer of a liability could be adopted within the framework of the OBW. At the time when Meijers commenced designing a new Civil Code, there existed no consensus on this issue. While referring to the need evidenced by actual practice, Meijers incorporated a transfer of a liability in the draft of the new Civil Code. In drafting the provisions he was influenced by German law. Novation was omitted from the new Civil Code, because, according to Meijers, there no longer was a need for it. In fact, the regulations for a transfer of a liability differ from novation on two fundamental issues, allowing the regulations to better accord to the needs of daily practice. Firstly, the parties, when agreeing that the declared debtor will discharge the debt instead of the debtor, usually only intend to replace the debtor, without canceling the obligation including all related rights and defenses. This result can be achieved by transfer of a liability, but not with novation. Secondly, article 6 : 155 of the Dutch Civil Code has been drafted to provide that a transfer of a liability is effected by an agreement between debtor and declared debtor, without the creditor becom-ing a party to the agreement. But in the case of novation, the creditor has to, and had to, be a party to the agreement. It is usual practice, however, that an agreement for the transfer of a liability is made between debtor and his successor, while it suffices for the creditor to provide his consent to the agreement. The regulations covering the transfer of a liability for this reason accords better with reality in practice than the regulations for novation. The agreement to transfer a liability is an obligatory arrangement between debtor and declared debtor. The actual transfer of the liability only takes place when the creditor, after being notified, has consented to the agree-ment. The function of the creditor’s consent is comparable to the notice of assignment to the assigned debtor upon transfer of a claim. It is my opinion that, for this reason, it can be stated that the creditor, while not a party to the obligatory agreement, does become a party to the delivery act that causes the debt to actually transfer to the assets of the declared debtor. Although not provided for in the Civil Code, and although Meijers in fact expressly excluded this as a possibility, it is my opinion that the transfer of a liability can also be effected by an agreement between creditor and declared debtor. This ties into the possibility, expressly permitted in the OBW, of effecting novation of a liability by way of expromission and with the possibility, also recognized by the Civil Code, of having a third <b>party</b> <b>discharge</b> a debt. In an agreement between creditor and declared debtor the obligatory agreement and the delivery act coincide. The liability transfers to the declared debtor at the time the agreement becomes effective, i. e. when executed. Article 6 : 155 through 6 : 158 of the Dutch Civil Code has not copied the German regulations verbatim, but nevertheless both sets of regulations are in effect largely similar. An important difference between the regulations is that in German law consent of the creditor is given retroactive force, whilst this retroactive force is expressly denied in Dutch law. To achieve that the parties are not dependent on consent from the creditor to determine the moment when the liability transfers, Dutch law has determined that debt, as it pertains to the relationship between debtor and declared debtor, transfers simultaneously with the agreement for the transfer of the liability being executed. From the point of view of Dutch Law, the consequences of the transfer have therefore been made relative; as between declared debtor and original debtor, the moment in time the liability transfers is different from that at which it transfers in the relationship between declared debtor and creditor. Creating such a relative transfer of a liability however denies the nature of the obligation and is therefore impossible. That is the reason why transfer of a liability, as between debtor and declared debtor, occurs only when the creditor has consented. The debt is transferred in its then existing capacity as it results from the obligation between debtor and creditor at the moment of transfer. Both German and Dutch Law apply the rule that transfer of a debt is dependent upon the validity of the agreement governing the transfer of the liability. This means that if such agreement is invalid, then the debt has not transferred to the declared debtor. The declared debtor can raise the defense against the creditor that the debt, because the agreement transferring the liability is invalid, did not transfer to him. Because the agreement to transfer the debt can be viewed as title of transfer, this means that a transfer of a liability, contrary to the law’s intention, in fact constitutes a causal legal act. Intrinsically, a transfer of a liability in this regard does not differ substantially in its effect from novation. In the case of novation an invalid agreement to transfer a liability will create a bar to establishing a new obligation for the succeeding debtor. A creditor can be prejudiced by an invalid agreement to transfer a liability, because, for example, he has neglected to take legal action against the debtor. Both German and Dutch Law contain no specific provisions to protect the position of the creditor. It is my opinion that a creditor, who has, in good faith, relied on the validity of a transfer of a liability, can lodge an appeal on the basis of article 3 : 36 of the Dutch Civil Code. This means that an invalid transfer cannot be raised as a defense, and that he can hold the declared debtor responsible for payment of the debt. Deficiencies in the underlying legal relationship between debtor and declared debtor do not however affect the validity of the transfer of the liability. This also accords with the general principles of Dutch property laws, providing that the motivation to enter into a legal proceeding does not affect its validity. In this regard, regulations governing the transfer of liabilities do not only accord with those of German Law, but also accord with what was the rule with respect to delegation under Justinian Law and with respect to novation as governed by the OBW. ...|$|R
