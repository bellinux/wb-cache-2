25|$|Floo powder can be {{used with}} any {{fireplace}} connected to the Floo Network. To transport from one to another, the fire at the point of departure must first be lit. The traveler throws a handful of Floo powder into the flames, turning them emerald green, then steps into the fireplace and states the intended destination in a clear and purposeful voice. Floo powder can also be used for communication; a wizard or witch can kneel in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fireplace</b> and stick their head into the fire, which will then appear in the fire of the destination fireplace, leaving the witch or wizard free to talk. It is also known that other body parts may be transported via Floo Powder, as Umbridge almost catches Sirius the second time he converses with Harry through the Floo network. Voices can also be transmitted through the Floo Network, as seen in the Prisoner of Azkaban by Snape, who summons Lupin through his office's fireplace while interrogating Harry about the Marauder's Map.|$|E

60|$|Perhaps {{there was}} never a moment in <b>the</b> lives <b>of</b> these two men when their utter and radical dissimilarity, {{physically}} {{as well as in the}} larger ways, was more strikingly and absolutely manifest. Like a great sea animal, huge, black-bearded, bronzed, magnificent, but uncouth, Andrew de la Borne, in the oilskins and overalls of a village fisherman, stood in the great bare hall in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> open <b>fireplace,</b> reckless <b>of</b> his drippings, at first only mildly amused by the half cynical, half angry survey <b>of</b> <b>the</b> very elegant young man who had just descended the splendid oak staircase, with its finely carved balustrade, black and worm-eaten, Cecil de la Borne stared at his brother with <b>the</b> angry disgust <b>of</b> one whose sense of all that is holiest stands outraged.

5000|$|In Kent's {{design for}} the {{enlarged}} Number 10, the Cabinet Room was a simple rectangular space with enormous windows. As part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> renovations begun in 1783, it was extended, giving the space its modern appearance. Probably not completed until 1796, this alteration was achieved by removing the east wall and rebuilding it several feet inside the adjoining secretaries' room. At the entrance, a screen of two pairs of Corinthian columns was erected (to carry <b>the</b> extra span <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ceiling) supporting a moulded entablature that wraps around the room. Robert Taylor, the architect who executed this concept, was knighted on its completion. The resulting small space, framed by the pillars, serves as an anteroom to the larger area. Hendrick Danckerts' painting [...] "The Palace of Whitehall" [...] (shown at <b>the</b> beginning <b>of</b> this article) usually hangs in the ante-room. It also contains two large bookcases that house the Prime Minister's Library; Cabinet members traditionally donate to the collection on leaving office a tradition that began with Ramsay MacDonald in 1931.Although Kent intended the First Lord to use this space as his study, it has rarely served that purpose; it has almost always been the Cabinet room.

40|$|Rabbi Ifargan is approaching! Please {{make room}} {{to let him}} pass! Women! Move aside! The Rabbi will not enter the place if you stay so thickly crowded!

Women reluctantly give up their places in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> big metal <b>fireplace</b> where hundreds of candles are burning. Rabbi Ifargan, a young Jewish orthodox man, clad in a black cloak and a hat comes in followed by a dozen young men. It is slightly after midnight and freezing cold. The 'Tikkun Hazot' ritual {{is about to begin}} on a mountain slope by <b>the</b> grave <b>of</b> Zaddiq Yonatan ben Uziel. An elderly man who is holding the microphone starts singing popular religious songs. The crowd joins in loudly. About 300 people are standing on the muddy ground, far away from their warm beds.

On the one hand, immigrants seek their special ethnic identity, tending to socialize among themselves, while on the other, they are a part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> larger society, influencing it and influenced by it. In this paper, I will discuss <b>the</b> stories <b>of</b> 5 pilgrims in Israel who currently participate repetitively in rituals held at sites where sacred graves exist. I will show how for second and third-generation Moroccan-immigrants in Israel, such pilgrimages enhance continuity with their ancestor heritage. For other pilgrims it is a new tradition they choose to embrace. Israel is an immigrant society. By 1948 <b>the</b> Jewish population <b>of</b> Israel was estimated at about 700, 000. In 50 years the number has risen to about 5, 000, 000. Immigration of Jews, in waves, was the main reason for this population increase. In the 50 s and 60 s, most immigrants were from Northern Africa, especially from Morocco. These immigrants encountered a society composed mainly by people <b>of</b> European origin. <b>The</b> official cultural policy was called 'The melting pot' and aimed to create one cultural entity. The result was that North-African immigrants had to conform to the mainstream ideas and give up many of their traditions. Two decades later, composing about a third <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Jewish population in Israel, <b>the</b> groups <b>of</b> North-African origin started a struggle to recover some of their lost heritage. By the year 2000, the Israeli cultural arena became more diverse. My ethnographic fieldwork was conducted mainly in the years 1998 and 1999, with a few follow-ups during 2000 and 2001. My main focus is on a nightly ceremony conducted in <b>the</b> vicinity <b>of</b> Zaddiq graves in the northern and southern regions of Israel. A Zaddiq is a righteous person who cures ill people and helps those in need. This is accomplished by miracles, attributed to his faith in God and his distinct and holy way of life. In some aspects it is a Jewish parallel to a Christian or a Muslim saint. ...|$|R
