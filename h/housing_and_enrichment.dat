40|$|Ferrets {{are being}} used more often in {{scientific}} research. In order to maintain animal welfare, {{it is important to}} know what kind of <b>housing</b> <b>and</b> <b>enrichment</b> types ferrets prefer. In order to assess the preferred enrichment of ferrets, a closed economy set-up has been made with 2 chambers. Six adult female ferrets were used in the experiment. One of the two chambers represented the housing cage with a sleepingbox, food and water ad lib. The other chamber was designed to place the various enrichments. To assess the motivation of the ferrets, a weighted door between the two cages had to be pushed. First, the food was only placed in the enrichment cage to determine what the maximum pushing capacity (MPC) of all individual ferrets was. After determining the MPC of the ferrets, they had to push the weighted door for an empty cage to set a control value. Despite the ferrets having their sleepingbox, food and water in their housing cage, the ferrets did not push significantly more for food than for the empty cage. One of the six ferrets pushed more for the empty cage than when there was food in the cage. Another ferret pushed as much for the empty cage as for when the food was in the cage. To investigate the effect of the weighted door on the ferrets, a whole was made between the two cage, giving the ferrets free access from one cage to the other. Despite this free passage, five out of the six ferrets still pushed the weighted door, even if not as heavy as they did without the free passage. This pilot study shows more research has to be done on ferrets to determine what is the most effective set-up to make a preferential consumer demand study. This closed economy with a two-chamber set-up and a pushing task does not permit to evaluate preferences for enrichment for ferrets...|$|E

40|$|Family-to-work {{conflict}} <b>and</b> <b>enrichment</b> {{indicate how}} {{participation in the}} family can influence negatively or positively participation at work, respectively. These experiences have been proved to co-occur within individuals at different levels and explain their well-being in a more nuanced way than conflict <b>and</b> <b>enrichment</b> in isolation. This study examines how Spanish women and men experience conflict <b>and</b> <b>enrichment</b> concurrently in different types and the consequences to their subjective health. First, in line with social role theory and the gendered division of household labor, we hypothesized on {{gender differences in the}} types of combined conflict <b>and</b> <b>enrichment</b> experiences. Second, incorporating theory on conservation of resources and identity, we hypothesized on the consequences of the specific types of combined conflict <b>and</b> <b>enrichment</b> to subjective health from a gender perspective. Using chi-square test on a sample of 236 women and 165 men, we confirmed that women and men differed in their types of combined conflict <b>and</b> <b>enrichment</b> experience: the beneficial (higher <b>enrichment</b> than conflict) <b>and</b> active types (similar higher conflict <b>and</b> <b>enrichment)</b> were mainly composed of women whereas the passive type (similar lower conflict <b>and</b> <b>enrichment)</b> was mainly composed of men. Using a MANOVA, we confirmed that the types of combined conflict <b>and</b> <b>enrichment</b> explained significant differences in subjective health in a similar way for women and men. Overall the findings debunk the belief that higher participation in family roles interferes with work more negatively among women, or that higher participation in family roles affect their health more negatively than men.

40|$|Work-family {{imbalance}} can induce negative consequences, such as poor {{physical and}} psychological well-being for individuals. Hong Kong employees commonly agree that work-family balance is important for them, {{but it is difficult}} to balance work and family lives (Mahtani, 2006). Very few studies have comprehensively explored how to eliminate the conflict, and to enhance the integration between work and family domains. This may hinder researchers and practitioners from exploring effective strategies for promoting work-family balance. The present study explored work-family conflict <b>and</b> <b>enrichment</b> among Hong Kong employees. This study examined the relationships between demands and resources in work and family lives, work-family conflict <b>and</b> <b>enrichment,</b> personal <b>and</b> work outcomes, and optimism and Confucian work values as moderator variables. The longitudinal mediating effects of work-family conflict <b>and</b> <b>enrichment</b> were examined, <b>and</b> potential cross-sectional and longitudinal moderating effects on the relationships between predictor variables and work-family conflict <b>and</b> <b>enrichment</b> were also explored. A two-wave panel design was adopted with data collection separated by a ten-month interval. Questionnaires were designed for the participants and their supervisors. 509 participants at Time 1 and 208 participants at Time 2 from three universities in Hong Kong completed self-report questionnaires, and 208 supervisors of the participants completed another questionnaire at Time 2. Predictor variables at work were significantly associated with work-family conflict <b>and</b> <b>enrichment</b> perceived in the work domain, and predictor variables in the family domain were significantly related to work-family conflict <b>and</b> <b>enrichment</b> perceived in the family domain. Work-family conflict <b>and</b> <b>enrichment</b> were significantly associated with personal and work outcomes. Mediation analyses showed that there were very few longitudinal mediating effects of work-family conflict <b>and</b> <b>enrichment</b> between predictor <b>and</b> criterion variables. These findings suggest that work-family conflict <b>and</b> <b>enrichment</b> might not consistently contribute mediating effects in the relationships between these predictor and criterion variables over time. Potential effects of optimism and Confucian work values have been rarely explored in previous Chinese work-family studies, and therefore this study examined the moderating effects of these two variables in relation to work-family conflict <b>and</b> <b>enrichment.</b> However, moderating analyses indicated that there were very few cross-sectional and longitudinal moderating effects of optimism and Confucian work values confirmed in this study. Overall, the findings of this research illustrate that work-family conflict <b>and</b> <b>enrichment</b> could be separately affected by demands and resources in work and family lives. Work-family conflict <b>and</b> <b>enrichment</b> could also contribute significant effects on individuals’ well-being and work productivity. The results also imply that the significance of mediation and moderation effects for work-family conflict <b>and</b> <b>enrichment</b> might be determined by personal factors (e. g. coping strategies of individuals) or organisational factors (e. g. organisational culture). The present study separately examined two directions of work-family conflict <b>and</b> <b>enrichment,</b> which extends the understanding of these topics in the Chinese context. The findings support related Western literature that perceived work-family conflict <b>and</b> <b>enrichment</b> in one domain were determined by the source in the same domain, and each direction of conflict or enrichment was associated with outcomes in the domain receiving the conflict or enrichment. These findings may extend the discussion of the relationships between potential factors and consequences of work-family conflict <b>and</b> <b>enrichment</b> for Hong Kong employees. The present study also provided additional information to understand the relationships between cultural values and work-family conflict <b>and</b> <b>enrichment.</b> The results may aid practitioners to formulate appropriate interventions, such as family-friendly employment policies and practices in enhancing work-family balance in Hong Kong...|$|R

40|$|Our {{previous}} work {{has shown that}} male Sprague–Dawley rats reared in social isolation, standard <b>housing</b> <b>and</b> environmental <b>enrichment</b> differ in their spontaneous open-field activity and in some neurobehavioral depressive-like parameters. Here, we extended this evidence by using a shorter postweaning rearing period (1 month) and including additional evaluations. First, {{in order to obtain}} a better characterization of the exploratory strategies among rearing conditions we analyzed in detail the spontaneous activity at the first minute and during the 10 -min session. Second, we asked whether the changes in open-field activity were related with basal anxiety levels in the elevated plus-maze. Third, behavior in the forced-swimming test was analyzed and afterward, the tissue levels of hippocampal norepinephrine and serotonin were assessed. The possible relationship between neurotransmitters and forced-swimming behavior were explored through correlation analyses. We found that rearing conditions (i) differed on locomotor habituation and on sensory-motor exploration at the first minute and during the 10 -min session without modifying the plus-maze behavior; (ii) affected differentially the grooming time, its sequential components, and the relationship between grooming and locomotor parameters; (iii) modified forced-swimming behavior and the hippocampal concentration of norepinephrine, serotonin, and its turnover; and (iv) produced different correlation patterns between both neurotransmitters and forced-swimming behaviors. Overall, environmental enrichment accelerated open-field habituation and led to behavioral and neurochemical antidepressant-like effects. In contract, isolation rearing strongly impaired habituation and simple information processing, but showed marginal effects on depressive-like behavior and on hippocampal neurochemistry. The current results suggest that differential rearing is not only a useful procedure to study behavioral plasticity or rigidity in response to early experience, but also to modeling some developmental protective or risk factors underlying depressive disorders.

40|$|Past {{research}} has demonstrated support for both the negative (i. e., work-family conflict) and the positive (i. e., work-family enrichment) sides of the work-family interface, but {{an understanding of how}} work-family conflict <b>and</b> <b>enrichment</b> are connected is still not fully understood. The current research looks to further our knowledge of the nature of this connection both conceptually and empirically. To do this, I draw on the extant work-family literature to suggest that resources are a connecting factor between conflict <b>and</b> <b>enrichment.</b> Following this, I integrate research on the work-family interface with conservation of resources theory and self-determination theory to discuss how conflict <b>and</b> <b>enrichment</b> operate as part of stress and motivational processes, respectively. I suggest that we can better understand the connection between work-family conflict <b>and</b> <b>enrichment</b> by examining conditions that have variations of stress and motivational implications related to resources. Accordingly, I propose and test two models, a differentiated demands model and a proactive resource accumulation model, and discuss their relevance for both work-family conflict <b>and</b> <b>enrichment.</b> ^ The hypothesized relationships were tested on a sample of 205 full-time employees who were married or cohabitating with a significant other. Significant other ratings of certain study variables were also obtained for 118 of these employees. The results support the notion that resources are a connecting factor between conflict <b>and</b> <b>enrichment.</b> The findings also suggest that work-family enrichment does in fact operate as part of an autonomously motivated process, and some support is found for the premise that antecedents having both stress and motivational implications will demonstrate relationships with both conflict <b>and</b> <b>enrichment.</b> The details of these findings are presented in the results section. ...|$|R

40|$|Challenging {{the prior}} {{research}} viewing employees as passive beings who respond to work-family conflict, this dissertation studies employees as active agents who shape {{their experience of}} work-family conflict <b>and</b> <b>enrichment</b> through developing resources based on their attentional efforts. Specifically, drawing on Conservation of Resources Theory, this dissertation proposes and tests a resource-based process model that explain the indirect effect of key resources (conscientiousness, extraversion, and agreeableness) on work-family conflict <b>and</b> work-family <b>enrichment</b> through differential resource development processes (human capital development, social capital development, and altruistic development). The results show support that agreeableness is associated with work-family conflict <b>and</b> <b>enrichment</b> through its unique effect on altruistic capital development. The indirect effect of conscientiousness on work-family conflict <b>and</b> <b>enrichment</b> operates through human capital development and altruistic capital development. Extraversion is associated with work-family conflict <b>and</b> <b>enrichment</b> through all three types of resource development. Moreover, the supplementary analysis using a longitudinal mediation design reveals a pattern of reverse causality?the positive relationship between conscientiousness and human capital development is attributable to the indirect effect through work-family enrichment...|$|R
