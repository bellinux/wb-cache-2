Investing in an advanced £25,000 computer, he and Ross used the machine to undertake complex economic analysis, {{on the basis of}} which they began publishing the Socialist <b>Economic</b> <b>Bulletin</b> in 1990. Two other members of the group, Redmond O'Neill and Simon Fletcher, also became trusted advisers. When Socialist Action founded a campaign group, the Anti-Racist Alliance, Livingstone came to be closely associated with it. They campaigned on the racist murder of Stephen Lawrence {{and the rise of the}} far right British National Party, but were disadvantaged by an ongoing rivalry with the Anti-Nazi League.|$|E
