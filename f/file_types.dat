25|$|In 2010, Vegas Pro, the {{professional}} non-linear editor, was updated to support importing, editing, and delivering CEA-608 closed captions. Vegas Pro 10, released on October 11, 2010, added several enhancements to the closed captioning support. TV-like CEA-608 closed captioning {{can now be}} displayed as an overlay when played back in the Preview and Trimmer windows, {{making it easy to}} check placement, edits, and timing of CC information. CEA708 style Closed Captioning is automatically created when the CEA-608 data is created. Line 21 closed captioning is now supported, as well as HD-SDI closed captioning capture and print from AJA and Blackmagic Design cards. Line 21 support provides a workflow for existing legacy media. Other improvements include increased support for multiple closed captioning <b>file</b> <b>types,</b> as well as the ability to export closed caption data for DVD Architect, YouTube, RealPlayer, QuickTime, and Windows Media Player.|$|E
25|$|A common {{issue in}} {{previous}} Windows versions was that competing applications doing common tasks each tried to associate {{themselves as the}} default for a certain file type using their own custom user interface. The default application information for a particular file type was stored in the registry on a per-machine basis, resulting in applications changing another user's default program when one user's defaults were changed and each application querying several different registry values when launched. In Windows Vista onwards, file type associations and protocol handlers can be set on a per-user basis using the new Default Programs API, meaning default programs for <b>file</b> <b>types</b> and tasks can be different for each individual user. There is an API for calling a common user interface so applications {{no longer need to}} maintain their own file association UI. The Default Programs API gives applications a programmatic way to check for and discover other default applications, restore a single or all registered defaults, query for the owner of a specific default file association/protocol, launch the Default Programs UI for a specific application or clear all per user associations. Applications only need to registered at install time to be part of Default Programs.|$|E

Dell Publishing (a {{division}} of the larger publisher Random House) made arrangements with 17th Street to have it released under their name. On February 11, 2003, the novel was released in hardcover, and was later reprinted in paperback under Dell's Yearling book imprint on June 8, 2004. In January 2009, the novel received a Barnes & Noble Nook release in the United States, enabling it to be read on the Nook e-book readers. The listed file size of The Last Dog on Earth is 2224 KB for the brand. On January 21, 2009, the book was released for the Kindle, Amazon.com's online e-book reader. Its listed file size is 448 KB. On February 3, 2010, The Last Dog on Earth was released on Apple Inc.'s iTunes. It is listed as being compatible with the iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad. Later, on February 25, 2009, the novel was released digitally with EPUB and mobile-specific <b>file</b> <b>types</b> for the Borders Group e-book app.|$|E

Metadata support for other <b>file</b> <b>types</b> can however be added by writing Property handlers.
