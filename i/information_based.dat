On the night of 5 December, Admiral Graf Spee sank the steamer Tairoa. The next day, she met with Altmark and transferred 140 prisoners from Doric Star and Tairoa. Admiral Graf Spee encountered her last victim on the evening of 7 December: the freighter Streonshalh. The prize crew recovered secret documents containing shipping route <b>information.</b> <b>Based</b> on that information, Langsdorff decided to head for the seas off Montevideo. On 12 December, the ship's Arado 196 broke down and could not be repaired, depriving Graf Spee of her aerial reconnaissance.

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, we {{introduce}} {{principles for}} ontology-based querying of <b>information</b> <b>bases.</b> We consider a {{framework in which}} a basis ontology over atomic concepts in combination with a concept language defines a generative ontology. Concepts {{are assumed to be}} the basis for an index of the <b>information</b> <b>base,</b> in the sense that these concepts are attached to objects in the <b>information</b> <b>base.</b> Concepts are thus applied to obtain a means for descriptions that generalize classical word-based <b>information</b> <b>base</b> indexing. We discuss how the ontology influences the matching of values, especially how the different relations of the ontology may contribute to overall similarity between concepts. Further, we discuss a set of major properties to improve a given similarity measure’s accordance with the semantics of the ontology, and use these properties to guide the choice of function...|$|R

25|$|The {{individuality}} of a {{being is}} a certain intricate form, not an enduring substance. In order to understand an organism, it must {{be thought of as}} a pattern which maintains itself through homeostasis – life continues by maintaining an internal balance of various factors such as temperature and molecular structure. While the material substances that compose a living being may be constantly replaced by nearly identical ones, an organism continues functioning with the same identity as long as the pattern is kept sufficiently intact. Since patterns can be transmitted, modified, or duplicated, they are therefore a kind of <b>information.</b> <b>Based</b> on this, Wiener suggests it should be theoretically possible to transmit the entirety of a living person as a message (which is practically indistinguishable from the concept of physical teleportation) – although he admits that the obstacles to such a process would be great, because of the enormous amount of information embodied in a person, and the difficulty of reading or writing it.|$|E
25|$|Although current {{treatments}} can {{be administered}} {{in a controlled}} hospital setting, many hospitals are ill-suited for a situation involving mass casualties among civilians. Inexpensive positive-pressure devices {{that can be used}} easily in a mass casualty situation, and drugs to prevent inflammation and pulmonary edema are needed. Several drugs that have been approved by the FDA for other indications hold promise for treating chemically induced pulmonary edema. These include β2-agonists, dopamine, insulin, allopurinol, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen. Ibuprofen is particularly appealing because it has an established safety record and can be easily administered as an initial intervention. Inhaled and systemic forms of β2-agonists used in the treatment of asthma and other commonly used medications, such as insulin, dopamine, and allopurinol have also been effective in reducing pulmonary edema in animal models but require further study. A recent study documented in the AANA Journal discussed the use of volatile anesthetic agents, such as sevoflurane, {{to be used as a}} bronchodilator that lowered peak airway pressures and improved oxygenation. Other promising drugs in earlier stages of development act at various steps in the complex molecular pathways underlying pulmonary edema. Some of these potential drugs target the inflammatory response or the specific site(s) of injury. Others modulate the activity of ion channels that control fluid transport across lung membranes or target surfactant, a substance that lines the air sacs in the lungs and prevents them from collapsing. Mechanistic <b>information</b> <b>based</b> on toxicology, biochemistry, and physiology may be instrumental in determining new targets for therapy. Mechanistic studies may also aid in the development of new diagnostic approaches. Some chemicals generate metabolic byproducts that could be used for diagnosis, but detection of these byproducts may not be possible until many hours after initial exposure. Additional research must be directed at developing sensitive and specific tests to identify individuals quickly after they have been exposed to varying levels of chemicals toxic to the respiratory tract.|$|E
