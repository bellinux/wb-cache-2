5|$|After the First World War {{the canal}} {{remained}} {{in a state}} of limbo – with minimal maintenance by the railway company – and was the haunt of <b>fishermen</b> <b>and</b> walkers. The Conservators continued their annual inspections, and the infrastructure remained in remarkably good order, compared to many other closed canals. The section near Creech St Michael was even used for swimming lessons for the local school children in the 1930s.|$|E

5|$|Aristotle was {{the first}} person to study biology systematically. He spent two years observing and {{describing}} the zoology of Lesbos and the surrounding seas, including in particular the Pyrrha lagoon in the centre of Lesbos. His data are assembled from his own observations, statements given by people with specialised knowledge such as beekeepers and <b>fishermen,</b> <b>and</b> less accurate accounts provided by travellers from overseas.|$|E
5|$|Aristotle's {{methods of}} {{observation}} included dissection (Aristotle's lost companion work, The Dissections, contained illustrations of these), so he observed animal anatomy directly, though his {{interpretations of the}} functions of the structures he observed were subject to error. Like other classical authors such as Pliny the Elder, Aristotle also gathered evidence from travellers and people with specialised knowledge, such as <b>fishermen</b> <b>and</b> beekeepers, without much attempt to corroborate what they said.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the islanders}} were <b>fishermen</b> <b>and</b> crofters; some also worked as {{maritime}} pilots to guide vessels through the treacherous {{waters of the}} Pentland Firth. The tides and currents meant that shipwrecks were frequent—the most recent occurring in 1993—and salvage provided an additional though often illegal supplement to the islanders' incomes. A lighthouse was built on Stroma in 1890 and still operates under automation.|$|E

5|$|The Melanau are {{a native}} people of Sarawak {{that lived in}} areas {{primarily}} around the modern city of Mukah, where they worked as <b>fishermen</b> <b>and</b> craftsmen as well renowned boat-builders.

5|$|The {{history of}} Orkney {{prior to this}} time is largely {{the history of the}} ruling aristocracy. From now on the {{ordinary}} people emerge with greater clarity. An influx of Scottish entrepreneurs helped to create a diverse and independent community that included farmers, <b>fishermen</b> <b>and</b> merchants that called themselves comunitas Orcadie and who proved themselves increasingly able to defend their rights against their feudal overlords.|$|E
5|$|Typhoon Linda caused {{considerable}} {{deaths in}} Vietnam. Many <b>fishermen</b> <b>and</b> sailors were caught at sea {{in the path}} of the storm, unable to escape its path. Within three days, the death toll in Vietnam was set at over 150, with thousands missing, many of them fishermen. By the fourth day after the storm, the toll reached 390, and on November 14, eight days after the storm, the death toll reached 464. Ultimately, the death toll was set at 3,111. Eight days after Linda's passage, a United Nations Department of Humanitarian Affairs (DHA) report indicated 857people were injured by the storm. The government quickly established search and rescue teams, particularly for missing <b>fishermen,</b> <b>and</b> a total of 3,513 people were rescued after the storm. In the weeks after the storm, hundreds of dead bodies washed ashore in Vietnam and Thailand.|$|E

The lake is used regularly by local <b>fishermen,</b> <b>and</b> a fishing club with about 120 members was established in 2011.

5|$|Before it {{was founded}} in 1810 by Lewis Tregonwell, the area was a deserted {{heathland}} occasionally visited by <b>fishermen</b> <b>and</b> smugglers. Initially marketed as a health resort, the town received a boost when it appeared in Augustus Granville's 1841 book, The Spas of England. Bournemouth's growth truly accelerated {{with the arrival of the}} railway and it became a recognised town in 1870. Historically part of Hampshire, it joined Dorset with the reorganisation of local government in 1974. Since 1997, the town has been administered by a unitary authority, meaning it is independent of Dorset County Council, although it remains part of that ceremonial county. The local council is Bournemouth Borough Council.|$|E
5|$|Bélé are {{folk songs}} of West African origin, {{traditionally}} performed recreationally {{in the evening}} during the full moon, and more rarely, lavèyé (wakes). The bélé tradition has declined in the 20th and 21st century, but is still performed for holidays like Easter, Independence Day, Christmas, Creole Day (Jounen Kwéyòl) and patron saint festivals held annually in the Parishes of Dominica, especially in the Fèt St.-Pierre and the Fèt St.-Isidore for <b>fishermen</b> <b>and</b> workers respectively.|$|E

5|$|During the {{duration}} of Komen's existence, the IMD issued warnings on the storm that were relayed to {{the governments of the}} countries affected. In southeastern India, government officials issued various warnings for <b>fishermen</b> <b>and</b> for the potential of disruptive rainfall. The widespread flooding forced 1.2million people to evacuate their homes, with 1,537shelters opened to house 214,306 of the evacuees. West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee canceled an overseas trip to London to coordinate relief activities related to the storm.|$|E
5|$|Four days later, while {{searching for}} a U-boat {{in the area of}} Conigbeg Rock, the {{destroyer}} received word that the Conigbeg Lightship had rescued survivors from a fishing vessel. Wainwright rendezvoused with the craft to interview the four seamen of the smack Our Bairns. They revealed that the U-boat—which turned out to be —was of the latest type Germany had in action. The destroyer relieved the lighthouse vessel of the four <b>fishermen</b> <b>and</b> continued the search until dusk, when she headed back to Queenstown to land the rescued men.|$|E

In 1833, Martinus Rørbye became the first artist to paint the <b>fishermen</b> <b>and</b> landscapes of Skagen, {{almost half a century}} before the arrival of the Skagen Painters. Skagen Church was inaugurated in 1841, and the first guest house in the town opened in 1844. In 1858, the grey lighthouse was inaugurated. The same year, bye-laws were established specifying building requirements including the completion of tiled roofs within five years. Skagen was struck by the cholera epidemic of 1853.|$|E

5000|$|... "The <b>Fisherman</b> <b>and</b> His Wife" [...] is a German {{fairy tale}} {{collected}} by the Brothers Grimm, tale no. 19. It is Aarne-Thompson type 555, the <b>fisherman</b> <b>and</b> his wife. Its theme was used in The Tale of the <b>Fisherman</b> <b>and</b> the Fish, an 1833 poem by Aleksandr Pushkin. Virginia Woolf has her character Mrs. Ramsey in To the Lighthouse read {{a version of the}} story to her son, James. Günter Grass's 1977 novel, The Flounder, is loosely based on the fairy tale, as are Emanuele Luzzati's version, Punch and the Magic Fish, and Ursula LeGuin's novel The Lathe of Heaven.|$|R
5|$|The Skagen Painters were a {{group of}} Scandinavian artists who visited the area every summer from the late 1870s until {{the turn of the}} century. They were {{attracted}} by the scenery, the <b>fishermen</b> <b>and</b> the quality of light which encouraged them to paint en plein air following the example of the French Impressionists while sometimes adopting the Realist approach of the Barbizon School. They broke away from the rigid traditions of the Danish and Swedish art academies, preferring the modern trends they had experienced in Paris.|$|E
5|$|The {{population}} of Hong Kong Island was 7,450 when the Union Flag raised over Possession Point on 26 January 1841. It mostly consisted of Tanka <b>fishermen</b> <b>and</b> Hakka charcoal burners, whose settlements scattered along several coastal hamlets. In the 1850s, {{a large number}} of Chinese immigrants crossed the then-free border to escape from the Taiping Rebellion. Other natural disasters, such as flooding, typhoons and famine in mainland China would play a role in establishing Hong Kong as a place for safe shelter.|$|E
5|$|The provincial {{observatory}} of Fujian {{issued a}} typhoon warning for the province on July 11, {{well in advance}} of Bilis' final landfall. In response to the warning, officials evacuated over 800,000people from Hunan and 70,000 from Zhejiang. In addition, 256,000 <b>fishermen</b> <b>and</b> workers were evacuated from coastal areas in southeastern China, and 220,000 ships were ordered to return to port. In Shanghai, the evacuations caused significant rail and bus delays, and more than 210 flights {{in and out of the}} city were canceled prior to landfall.|$|E
