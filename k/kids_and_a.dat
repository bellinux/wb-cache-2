Clarke's World of Strange Powers, Elsie {{said that she}} and Frances were too embarrassed to admit the truth after fooling Doyle, the author of Sherlock Holmes: [...] "Two village <b>kids</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> brilliant man like Conan Doyle– well, we could only keep quiet." [...] In the same interview Frances said: [...] "I never even {{thought of it as}} being a fraud– it was just Elsie and I having a bit of fun and I can't understand to this day why they were taken in– they wanted to be taken in." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{boundaries}} {{between art and}} pop music became increasingly blurred throughout {{the second half of}} the 20th century. In the 1960s, pop musicians such as John Lennon, Syd Barrett, Pete Townshend, Brian Eno, and Bryan Ferry began to take inspiration from their previous art school studies. [...] Frith states that in Britain, art school represented [...] "a traditional escape route for the bright working class <b>kids,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> breeding ground for young bands like the Beatles and beyond". In North America, art pop was influenced by Bob Dylan and the Beat Generation, and became more literary through folk music's singer-songwriter movement. Before progressive/art rock became the most commercially successful British sound of the early 1970s, the 1960s psychedelic movement brought together art and commercialism, broaching the question of what it meant to be an [...] "artist" [...] in a mass medium. Progressive musicians thought that artistic status depended on personal autonomy, and so the strategy of [...] "progressive" [...] rock groups was to present themselves as performers and composers [...] "above" [...] normal pop practice.|$|E
2500|$|After casting Zack Morris, {{the next}} {{character}} sought after was Morris's nerdy friend, Samuel [...] "Screech" [...] Powers. Gosselaar {{was asked to}} read through the script {{with a number of}} <b>kids,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> second audition was scheduled for finalists. It was Gosselaar himself who insisted that Dustin Diamond was right for the part as he believed Diamond was Screech in real life. After reading through the script, Diamond was given the part, although Engel later found out that he had misread his head shot and Diamond was considerably younger {{than the rest of the}} cast—a fact that, had he been aware, might have prevented Engel from casting him.|$|E

2500|$|Her [...] "Prince Charming" [...] {{speech at}} the American Legions Girls State meeting in Austin in which she remarked: [...] "Prince Charming may be driving a Honda (motorcycle) and telling you you have no equal, but that's {{not going to do}} much good when you've got <b>kids</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> mortgage, and I could add he's got a beer gut and a {{wandering}} eye. Prince Charming, if he does ride up on a Honda, he's going to expect you to make the payments." [...] Her words were received as bitter and hostile against both sexes, and perceived as a negative view of marriage and family.|$|E
2500|$|Berry's love of North Staffordshire {{was deep}} and permanent; he indulged an incurable {{addiction}} to the place. He [...] "had an inexplicable attraction to the place and...was attached to the area by [...] "an invisible umbilical cord", which could never be cut." [...] He said of his childhood [...] "every house seemed to have an old woman, a drunken man, a gang of <b>kids</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> snarling dog." [...] Certainly then he was, [...] "a thinker {{of the working class}} who developed a love of middle class pursuits." [...] He said he had [...] "always worked out of one world, the working class world of which I am part", while declaring, [...] "I am a man of habit and pattern." [...] He [...] "became a cult figure following many television appearances in the Midlands." [...] His attachment to the place was a legend. For example, [...] "when he obtained work as a teacher in Chelsea College of Art he commuted every day and night from Biddulph Moor." [...] And indeed [...] "propping up the bar at his local public house...is where he felt most comfortable." [...] Yet it was during the 1950s that the, [...] "crushing black agoraphobia descended on him, virtually imprisoning him in North Staffordshire {{for the rest of his}} life." [...] But as a man, poet, playwright and artist he came into his own. Peter Cheeseman (Director, for thirty five years, of the Victoria Theatre, Stoke-on-Trent and, latterly, the New Victoria Theatre, Newcastle-under-Lyme), recalls the many animated conversations they had enjoyed, and [...] "the swift gestures of his good left arm, banging at the elbow of his useless right...and the rich talk that pours out of him." [...] He was [...] "eloquent in every way...a vigorous and expressive poet...a writer of stories, a dramatist...grotesquely hilarious... an inspiring teacher of art, loved and admired by his students." [...] He was [...] "a large, ungainly and glum man, tall and remote, cloth cap sitting permanently over his expressionless face." [...] He seemed to have something of a love-hate relationship with his art, for [...] "he once sent a groaning van-load off to Stoke tip: a great weight lifted off me." [...] He was really [...] "a painter and poet of the cluttered and dying landscape of pits and ironworks...he writes of that world with unexpected imagery and a great roaring sense of humour, sometimes wry, often grotesque." [...] As a painter, he strained [...] "to paint a world he loved passionately for its vigour and its energy and its richness before the bulldozer scraped it away." [...] He felt his paintings to be [...] "the most eloquent utterances, portraits of a world seen from the bottom of my rut." [...] This was indeed [...] "a world filled with images of people and landscape that have been twisted and worn into strange shapes by hard work and poverty. My Parthenon is an allotment hut knocked together out of bits of rubbish. It is the richness of poor things that I am drawn to." [...] As he told Peter Cheeseman, [...] "everything I have ever drawn, every house, every man, every face has its roots in those few streets [...] All the things I have written, or hope to write, I am sure will have the same roots." ...|$|E

60|$|But not {{to crowd}} this part with {{an account of}} the lesser part of their rogueries, such as {{treading}} down their corn, shooting three young <b>kids</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> she-goat, which the poor men had got to breed up tame for their store; and in a word, plaguing them night and day in this manner, it forced the two men to such a desperation, that they resolved to fight them all three the first time they had a fair opportunity. In order to this they resolved to go to the castle, as they called it, that was my old dwelling, where the three rogues and the Spaniards all lived together at that time, intending to have a fair battle, and the Spaniards should stand by to see fair play. So they got up in the morning before day, and came to the place, and called the Englishmen by their names, telling a Spaniard that answered, that they wanted to speak with them.|$|E
60|$|When {{you have}} to keep {{connection}} unbroken between a restless mother of <b>kids</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> baby who is at the point of death, you suffer in all your system. But the babies were fed. Each morning and evening Scott would solemnly lift them out one by one from their nest of gunny-bags under the cart-tilts. There were always many who could do no more than breathe, and the milk was dropped into their toothless mouths drop by drop, with due pauses when they choked. Each morning, too, the goats were fed; and since they would straggle without a leader, and since the natives were hirelings, Scott was forced to give up riding, and pace slowly at the head of his flocks, accommodating his step to their weaknesses. All this was sufficiently absurd, and he felt the absurdity keenly; but at least he was saving life, and when the women saw that their children did not die, they made shift to eat a little of the strange foods, and crawled after the carts, blessing the master of the goats.|$|E
