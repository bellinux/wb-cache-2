5|$|Enceladus {{is named}} after the giant Enceladus of Greek mythology. The name, like the names {{of each of the}} first seven {{satellites}} of Saturn to be discovered, was suggested by William Herschel's son John Herschel in his 1847 publication Results of Astronomical Observations made at the Cape of Good <b>Hope.</b> <b>He</b> chose these names because Saturn, known in Greek mythology as Cronus, was the leader of the Titans.|$|E
5|$|In 1935, David Clay, one of {{the boys}} assumed to have been killed, is found alive in Hesperia, California. He reveals that {{one of the}} boys with whom he was imprisoned was Walter.

David does not know whether Walter was recaptured, but he says Walter helped him escape, giving Christine <b>hope</b> <b>he</b> is alive.|$|E
60|$|Young John replied, with acknowledgments, that <b>he</b> only <b>hoped</b> <b>he</b> {{did what}} was right, and what showed how entirely he {{was devoted to}} Miss Dorrit. He wished to be unselfish; and <b>he</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>he</b> was. He wished to do {{anything}} as laid {{in his power to}} serve Miss Dorrit, altogether putting himself out of sight; and <b>he</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>he</b> did. It was but little that he could do, but <b>he</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>he</b> did it.|$|R
60|$|I said I {{was very}} well, and <b>hoped</b> <b>he</b> was. I was {{sufficiently}} ill at ease, Heaven knows; {{but it was}} not in my nature to complain much at that time of my life, so I said I was very well, and <b>hoped</b> <b>he</b> was.|$|R

5|$|Telescopium was {{introduced}} in 1751–52 by Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille with the French name le Telescope, depicting an aerial telescope, after he had observed and catalogued 10,000 southern stars during a two-year stay at the Cape of Good <b>Hope.</b> <b>He</b> devised 14 new constellations in uncharted regions of the Southern Celestial Hemisphere not visible from Europe. All but one honored instruments that symbolised the Age of Enlightenment. Covering 40 degrees of the night sky, the telescope stretched out northwards between Sagittarius and Scorpius. Lacaille had Latinised its name to Telescopium by 1763.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, the Negus {{family moved}} to Haslemere, Surrey. During the Second World War, Negus again served in a medical capacity, {{this time with the}} Emergency Medical Service (EMS) at Horton Hospital, Epsom, from 1939 to 1946. In 1940, on the {{retirement}} of his colleague Charles <b>Hope,</b> <b>he</b> had been appointed senior surgeon at King's College Hospital, and in 1946 he reached the peak of his profession as a consulting surgeon. During this post-war period one of Negus's patients was the former (and future) prime minister Winston Churchill, who in 1950 was diagnosed by Negus with high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss. Negus retired from clinical and teaching work in 1952 at the age of 65.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, the {{citizens}} of Ancona, a town in the Papal States, hoisted Matthias's flag in the <b>hope</b> <b>he</b> would protect them against Venice. Pope Innocent VIII soon protested, but Matthias refused to reject the overture, stating that the link {{between him and the}} town would never harm the interests of the Holy See. He also sent an auxiliary troop to his father-in-law, who was waging a war against the Holy See and Venice. The 1482 truce between Hungary and the Ottoman Empire was prolonged for two years in 1488. On this occasion, it was stipulated that the Ottomans were to refrain from invading Wallachia and Moldavia. The following year, Matthias granted two domains to Stephen the Great of Moldavia in Transylvania.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, at {{the same}} time during the kidney crisis, United States President Barack Obama has decided to visit Quahog, and Chris' entire English class is {{assigned}} to write an essay about <b>hope.</b> <b>He</b> consults his sister Meg for her opinion and she lists her personal opinion on the subject, which Chris plagiarizes. Meg is angered that he has decided to take her words and call them his own, but she is eventually given credit for co-writing the speech, and she and Chris introduce Obama to the school. President Obama then enters the school's auditorium, and begins singing and playing the guitar as students swoon over his performance.|$|E
5|$|Nafaryus and Arabelle {{arrive and}} beg Gabriel {{to use his}} gift to save Faythe ("Losing Faythe"), but Gabriel is unable to sing after {{screaming}} so loudly ("Whispers on the Wind"). The people, attracted by the scream, show up and start singing, giving Gabriel <b>hope.</b> <b>He</b> finds his ability to sing and brings Faythe back to life ("Hymn of a Thousand Voices"). Nafaryus, realising what he has done, decides to end the conflict with Gabriel and shuts down the NOMACS for good. Daryus is forgiven for his actions, and Gabriel and Faythe raise Xander as a family ("Our New World"). Nafaryus promises to govern the empire as a fair leader in a new world where music is appreciated again ("Astonishing").|$|E
5|$|Paulo {{was written}} to be unlikable, with the <b>hope</b> <b>he</b> would redeem himself when his backstory was {{revealed}} {{in his final}} episode. Paulo either resents or is indifferent toward the often heroic actions {{of some of the}} survivors, spending much of his time golfing. He complains to Nikki about not being included; however, he does little to help out around the camp and does not try to improve his status in the survivors' hierarchy. When he does get chances to participate in treks, for example, when Hurley finds a car, Paulo is uninterested and discourages Nikki from joining Hurley on his adventure. Nikki tries to participate, tending to a wounded Mr. Eko and volunteering to go with Locke to the Pearl station, much to the surprise of Paulo. Paulo accompanies her, and he exhibits a constant sarcastic behavior in the Pearl.|$|E

5|$|Wright's sermon left a great {{impression}} on Obama, who recounted Wright's sermon {{in detail in}} his memoir Dreams from My Father. Soon after Dreams From My Father was published he went into politics, entering the Illinois Senate. In 2004 he was chosen to deliver the keynote address at the 2004 Democratic National Convention. In Obama's 2006 memoir The Audacity of <b>Hope,</b> <b>he</b> recollects that on being chosen to deliver this speech, he pondered the topics on which he had previously campaigned, and on major issues then affecting the nation, before thinking about the variety of people he had met while campaigning, all endeavouring in different ways to improve {{their own lives and}} to serve their country.|$|E
5|$|Darren {{arrives in}} Hollyoaks with parents Celia (Carol Noakes) and Jack from America. Celia discovers that Jack has been {{having an affair}} with Dawn Cunningham (Lisa Williamson) and returns to America, taking Darren with her. Darren returns to live with his father two years later. Darren becomes friends with Luke; {{together}} they stand up to bully Mark. When Mark's bullying of Luke becomes more severe, Darren decides to befriend Mark in the <b>hope</b> <b>he</b> will go easy on Luke. His attempts do not succeed and Mark rapes Luke. After the attack, Luke's relationship with Mandy begins to fail, so Darren takes advantage of the situation and begins a relationship with Mandy. Darren suggests that Luke might be gay and that he was responsible for his own rape. Mandy breaks up with Darren. Darren trashes his sister Ruth's (Terri Dwyer) flat and is evicted; he leaves the village soon afterwards.|$|E
5|$|On 25 February 2012, in a {{match against}} Wigan Athletic, Bent landed awkwardly on his ankle after {{tangling}} with Antolín Alcaraz. He was stretchered off the pitch {{with what was}} thought to be a serious injury. This was later confirmed two days later, after Bent had a scan on his ankle that revealed he had ruptured ligaments. He was out for three months which effectively ended his season with Villa and most likely his chance to play at UEFA Euro 2012. Bent had recovered from his injury by mid-May and was in contention for Villa's final match of 2011–12 against Norwich City but was ultimately left out. This also gave him the possibility of making new England manager Roy Hodgson's Euro 2012 England squad. Bent vowed to prove his fitness to Hodgson, in the <b>hope</b> <b>he</b> would be selected to play in the tournament. Bent once again finished as Villa's top scorer with 10 goals in 25 appearances and vowed to stay on at the club.|$|E

5|$|The imprisoned {{architect}} Daedalus tells Kratos {{to unite}} the Labyrinth. Completing this task, Kratos fights {{his way through the}} aerial puzzle and rescues Pandora, who tells him to break the Chain of Balance so the Labyrinth can be raised, and she can reach her box. Neutralizing the three judges and breaking the chain, Kratos raises the Labyrinth, and Pandora tries to enter the Flame of Olympus. Zeus intervenes and fights Kratos; after a brief battle, Pandora sacrifices herself and quenches the flame, despite Kratos' protests. Finding Pandora's Box empty, Kratos attacks the mocking Zeus. Gaia returns and tries to kill them, but they escape through a gaping wound in her chest where they continue their battle. Gaia is killed when Kratos impales Zeus against her heart with the Blade of Olympus, which apparently also kills Zeus. When Kratos recovers the blade and tries to leave, he is attacked by Zeus' spirit and loses all of his weapons in the process. Before Zeus can land a fatal blow, Kratos is saved by Pandora during a journey into his psyche. With help from the spirits of his wife Lysandra and daughter Calliope, Kratos forgives himself for his past sins. After discovering the power of <b>hope,</b> <b>he</b> regains consciousness and beats Zeus to death with his bare hands, thus ending the reign of the Olympian Gods.|$|E

25|$|The modern {{names of}} all seven {{satellites}} of Saturn come from John Herschel (son of William Herschel, discoverer of Mimas and Enceladus).

25|$|The U.S. invited Aguinaldo {{to return}} to the Philippines in the <b>hope</b> <b>he</b> would rally Filipinos against the Spanish colonial government.

By the time U.S. land forces had arrived, the Filipinos had taken control of the entire island of Luzon, except for the walled city of Intramuros. On June 12, 1898, Aguinaldo declared the independence of the Philippines in Kawit, Cavite, establishing the First Philippine Republic under Asia's first democratic constitution.|$|E
