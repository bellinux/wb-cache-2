A reviewer from the publication The Backlot listed the song at number eleven on their [...] "Kylie Minogue's Best Songs, In Honor of Her Birthday" [...] and said [...] "This stylistic mishmash (featuring a deep Celtic sound that, maybe, Alison Krauss could fiddle along with) is a hard-driving, adrenalized, sexualized quest for freedom. <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> the fact that Kylie sings, [...] "I am frightened, I'm aroused, I'm enlightened to the now' and totally sells it?"

40|$|We live in {{a society}} that is {{constantly}} in change. As society moves forward, we experience social, political and economic shifts that somehow prove difficult for our buildings to survive in this rapid change. My Interest therefore looks to adaptive reuse as an approach to dealing with the change in our built environment. <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>deal,</b> in an urban setting, with a neglected urban fabric without compromising Its historical and architectural memory which becomes important to a community? <b>How</b> <b>do</b> we begin to engage with the built fabric? It begins with accepting that transformation needs to occur. Adaptive reuse ensures the evolving life of any old building by expanding its practical use in its contemporary context. Existing and abandoned buildings represent a substantial resource. Through adaptive reuse, many buildings can continue to be brought back into use and contribute to a more sustainable development pattern. Old buildings in my opinion possess a timeless character. The aim of this document is to Investigate the potential of adaptive reuse as a response in transforming an existing structure on the brink of neglect into potentially a space that could be reused and function {{in a way that it}} supports the community and promote social engagement. The design and research develops a theoretically informed and sustainable approach to recycling built fabric in its contemporary urban context by linking patterns of adaptation and reuse to the change experienced in the contemporary built environment...|$|R

[...] "That gave me the idea for the Public Domain record. It finally dawned on me that those folk songs are poor people's therapy... The reason they got into the public domain was they touched a nerve.You're thrown into this world where bad things happen—tragic death and economic injustice—so <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> it? Well, one way of dealing with it is in these songs. It's a way of explaining the world." ...|$|E
50|$|Facing a sex obsessed culture, a {{mountain}} of stereotypes and misconceptions, {{and a lack of}} social or scientific research, asexuals - people who experience no sexual attraction—struggle to claim their identity. (A)sexual follows the growth of a community that experiences no sexual attraction. In 2000, David Jay came out to his parents. He was asexual and was fine with it. And he was not alone. Studies show that 1% of the population is asexual. But in a society obsessed with sex, <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> life as an outsider? Combining intimate interviews, verite footage, and animation with fearless humor and pop culture imagery, David and our four other characters grapple with this universal question and the outcomes might surprise you.|$|E
50|$|So <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> these {{cultural}} differences? How does one recognize to which culture a particular person identifies {{so that he}} or she will infer correctly all of the nonverbal cues associated with that culture? From such a potentially complicated question comes a relatively simple answer. Study, listen and learn. Communicators and leaders become successful because they observe the unconscious actions of others. Sometimes an individual’s actions are the result of their culture or upbringing and sometimes they are the result of the emotion or feeling they are portraying. Keen communicators are able {{to tell the difference between}} the two and effectively communicate based on their observations. Oculesics is not a standalone science. Combining the information obtained from eye movements and behaviors with other nonverbal cues such as Haptics, Kinesics, or Olfactics will lend the observer to a much more well rounded and accurate portrait of an individual’s behavior.|$|E

The choices are numerous and chances are that knowledge will be obtained. However, <b>how</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> learn to <b>deal</b> with missing data where none was expected?

6000|$|... "I {{see your}} point, Mrs. Wilkins," [...] I said, [...] "and, of course, {{in a house}} where two or three {{servants}} were kept some such plan might easily be arranged. The girl who commenced work at six {{o'clock in the morning}} might consider herself free at six o'clock in the evening. What she <b>did</b> with herself, <b>how</b> she dressed herself in her own time, would be her affair. What church the clerk or the workman belongs to, what company he keeps, is no concern of the firm. In such matters, mistresses, I am inclined to think, saddle themselves with a responsibility {{for which there is no}} need. If the girl behaves herself while in the house, and does her work, there the contract ends. The mistress who thinks it her duty to combine the roles of employer and of maiden aunt is naturally resented. The next month the girl might change her hours from twelve to twelve, and her fellow-servant could enjoy the six a.m. to six p.m. shift. But <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> propose to <b>deal,</b> Mrs. Wilkins, with the smaller menage, that employs only one servant?" ...|$|R

50|$|If {{the key is}} to {{allocate}} appropriate time to each service based on historical OR use, <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> rooms consistently running late on the day of surgery? The answer: make the allocated time, into which cases are being scheduled, longer. For example, if a surgeon does 12 hours worth of cases every day he is in the OR, don’t plan 8 hours of staffing (7am-3pm) and have everyone frustrated by having to stay late (overtime). Rather, schedule his cases into 12 hours of allocated time (7am-7pm). That way, anesthesia and nursing staff know they will be there 12 hours when they arrive to work and overtime costs (financial and morale) will be reduced. The common response to this approach is, “No one wants to be there till 7 pm.” The answer to that is, “You are there now till 7 pm so why not make scheduled OR time 12 hr long and have a more predictable work day duration.” Thus, optimizing staffing costs is finding balance between overtime and finishing early.|$|E
5000|$|The Roundabout Theatre Company {{produced}} Significant Other Off-Broadway at the Laura Pels Theatre. The play premiered on May 16, 2015 in previews, officially on June 18, {{and closed}} on August 16, 2015. Directed by Trip Cullman, the cast featured Sas Goldberg, Gideon Glick, Carra Paterson, Lindsay Mendez, Luke Smith, John Behlmann and Barbara Barrie. The play involves {{the lives of}} four college friends and their search for relationships. It {{was included in the}} New York Times Top Ten Productions of 2015. Significant Other is forthcoming from Samuel French. The play was produced by the SpeakEasy Stage Company, Boston Massachusetts, in September to October 2016. Harmon explained the premise: “How do you make life work for yourself when you feel that you’re not living the life you’re supposed to be living or want to be living? And <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> that when the changes that you need to make are in some ways outside of your control?” Harmon further noted that he did not intend to write a comedy. “I honestly thought that I’d written the saddest play... I don’t write thinking about the comedy. I am genuinely always surprised when something winds up being funny.” ...|$|E
5000|$|The band {{brought in}} Sons of Champlin founder Bill Champlin as keyboardist and singer. The group also {{retained}} Chris Pinnick from the Chicago XIV sessions. Through the band's manager, Jeff Wald, and on suggestion of Danny Seraphine, producer David Foster would {{make contact with}} the band.Once they agreed to Foster producing the album (the band had considered him for 1980's Chicago XIV), the producer radically redefined Chicago's sound for the 1980s, with all of the latest technologies and techniques and introducing the significant use of outside songwriters and studio players. Three members of Toto lent their expertise to the sessions. In 2015 former Chicago drummer Danny Seraphine defended this choice to change their sound: [...] David Foster really tried to maintain the integrity of the band. He wasn’t looking to diminish the musicality and the integrity of the band at all. Some people might say that he did. But he was going with what the times dictated. I’m telling you, there was word through our manager from radio stations saying they didn’t want anything with horns on it. <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> that? ...|$|E

5000|$|Opponents of {{the bill}} believe that by raising the age the {{legislature}} is giving children two additional years to commit crimes knowing {{they would not be}} charged in an adult court, suggesting that the proposed law would not provide any deterrence. Eddie Caldwell provides a valid defense against the proposed legislation and proves to be the leading contestant against House Bill 632. In addition to monetary costs that are associated with the legislation, Caldwell argues various other reasons as to why the legislation is disorganized. Caldwell argues that advocates are not addressing a major concern in which he states, [...] "if its a kid that's done something wrong - as we all have - some worse than others, for the first time, then <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> the child as opposed to the one that you've dealt with 100 times before?" [...] He also states, [...] "Currently we allow that age group {{to decide whether or not}} they want to drop out of school, and that decision is no less important to the future of that child, and no less critical to their success than whether or not they commit a crime." [...] While taking a critical stance against the proposed policy, Caldwell [...] "says the Sheriff's Association is in favor of allotting the Department of Juvenile Justice with the proper resources for its current overall workload." ...|$|E
5000|$|Ritchie {{draws from}} {{numerous}} meta-narratives that explore religion, philosophy, and science {{in order to}} create his complicated, yet freshly simple works. “Influenced by everything from the mythic escapades of comic-book superheroes and pagan gods to the meta-narratives of philosophy, religion, and science, Ritchie has developed a mythical narrative or cosmology of his own, and his art is communicated via a variety of art spaces and installations, including galleries throughout the world and the World Wide Web.” [...] In an interview with Art:21, Ritchie states that he reads Nature Magazine, which is a weekly journal that publishes technical articles about contemporary scientific findings. Ritchie's pieces have a scientific nature to them, but do not solely represent scientific agenda. Instead, his work investigates the role of science within society, creating a narrative between order and chaos. In Ritchie's Art:21 interviews, he explains his interest in science as [...] "a way of having a conversation that's based on an idea of looking at things than I am in the rhetoric around science." [...] In other words, Ritchie is not trying to depict scientific data accurately. He uses his research in order to find topics that are important to him, to which he then illustrates in his work. Ritchie's work tends to include various references that expand into a comprehensive explanation historical experience or knowledge. His meta-narratives combine all of the philosophies that interest him, and place them into a structure of information that can be bombarding, but {{seem to be able to}} go on endlessly. His work deals with the theme of information. Ritchie explains this theme with a few rhetorical questions and statements: [...] "…for me the theme of my new structure was information, <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> it? As a person is it possible for you to grasp everything and see everything? You're presented with everything and all through your life you’re trying to filter out, you're really just trying to control that flow." [...] These questions posed by Ritchie rightfully describe his thought process while creating his art, allowing the viewer to better understand his pieces beyond their aesthetic characteristics.|$|E

40|$|<b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> {{students}} {{that are in}} danger of failing?” This was one of the more memorable questions during my job interview at the University of Limerick. As lecturers we might share, and in fact we do to a surprisingly large extent, a tacit understanding of what qualifies as ‘good work’ – and what doesn’t. At the same time it is difficult, to say the least, to impart to the students a sense of quality and the ability to judge. “You tell them plainly and explain clearly where and why they went wrong, what they can do about it, and offer your support in the process,” I replied, or something along those lines. The problem, of course, is to be clear about the ‘rights’ and ‘wrongs’ (and if they exist in the first place) and hence about the criteria we apply to student work, and how to make them explicit. – In the following, I will expand on concrete experiences in our emerging architecture programme at the University of Limerick and how we try to address this problem...|$|E
40|$|The article {{explores the}} stage {{movement}} of gods, heroes and mythical figures in Aristophanic stage space. All {{four of the}} Aristophanic comedies that contain these characters (Peace, Birds, Frogs and Wealth) are found {{to adhere to the}} same patterns of stage movement whereby the comic protagonist must be the first to initiate contact with a divine, heroic or mythical character and will do so by undertaking a journey away from the city to find that character. Gods, heroes and mythical figures do not just turn up anywhere anyhow in comedy, and the question is why. <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> gods in comic space? In tackling these questions, the discussion juxtaposes the contexts of dramatic performance alongside religious contexts of human-divine interaction. This offers a way of considering the perspective of a 5 th c. BCE audience who had experience both of the theatre and of various religious activities. Aristophanic stagecraft is observed for the ways in which it makes the divine and mythical plausible to audiencemembers, whose lives were shaped by their relationship with gods and heroes. This relationship is reflected even in comic drama. The discussion of comic drama enables a comparison to be drawn with the role and movement of the divine in tragedy...|$|E
