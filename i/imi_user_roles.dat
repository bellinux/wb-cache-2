Therefore, any hacker with the <b>User</b> <b>role</b> has zero access to confidential information, and zero control over the system. The <b>User</b> <b>role</b> is typically used to monitor sensor readings, after an SNMP alert has been received by SNMP Network Monitoring Software.|$|R
40|$|Many welfare {{states have}} embraced choice and market {{mechanisms}} since the 1990 s. With respect to welfare users, {{it has been}} argued that this led to a change from citizens to consumers. This paper challenges this observation and discusses changes of welfare <b>user</b> <b>roles</b> in the German welfare state. The main argument rests on the assumption that <b>user</b> <b>roles</b> are much more complex and include claimants and co-producers in addition to citizens and consumers. Based on this heuristic model of multiple <b>user</b> <b>roles,</b> empirical evidence for <b>user</b> <b>roles</b> in pension insurance, health care and schools is presented. Indeed, we observe a shift towards consumers in many fields of welfare provision, but German users are still largely addressed as claimants and citizens. Moreover, they are acting as active co-producers, entitled claimants, subversive consumers and needy patients...|$|R

Therefore, firms have to make their strategy considering <b>user's</b> <b>role.</b> For that reason, firms can use networks such as university, researcher, firm and user from the viewpoint of open innovation.

40|$|The {{principles}} of crowdsourcing are increasingly applied in social contexts like development projects. In {{this study we}} explore a crowdsourcing community, which aims to enhance conditions in low income communities. We investigate the network structures {{of the community and}} detect behavioral pattern and <b>user</b> <b>roles</b> based on participation behavior for this specific context. Overall, the observed community shows a high level of collaboration and reciprocal dialogue. On the individual level we located four different <b>user</b> <b>roles</b> distinct in their interaction and contribution behavior. So called “collaborators” are considered as unique <b>user</b> <b>role</b> in an online community within a social context. We contribute to the theory of crowdsourcing by illustrating that context and purpose of crowdsourcing initiatives may influence the behavioral pattern of users. Further we add insights to the junctures between crowdsourcing and social innovation in the context of open development...|$|R

30|$|Recent work by Dongwan Shin [12] added {{fine grained}} role based access {{controls}} to IaaS, by introducing a trusted domain {{that is used}} to manage <b>users,</b> <b>roles</b> and access permissions. But all the <b>users,</b> <b>roles</b> and permissions are managed centrally within this domain, thus it does not provide federated access or allow roles and attributes to be assigned by external attribute authorities, as in for example the UK Access Management Federation [13]. We believe that these are essential features for scalability, and they are provided as part of the current project.|$|R

We then combine the resulting message <b>roles</b> and the <b>user</b> <b>roles</b> to generate the overall influence network.

Modern business process management frameworks provide great support for flexible design, deployment {{and management of}} business processes. However, integrating complex data mining services into such frameworks is not trivial due to unclear definitions of <b>user</b> <b>roles</b> and missing flexible data mining services as well as missing standards and methods for the deployment of data mining solutions.
