Leary explained {{that he did not}} know much about Spider-Man in the comics and was [...] "more of a Batman guy. Not the '60s [...] but the really dark Batman. But my wife was a Spider-Man nut, which was why I went to Tobey Maguire ones." [...] He added that long before he was cast as George Stacy his friend Jeff Garlin, a Spider-Man fan, [...] "said to me, 'The <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> you, I thought you were George Stacy!' This was like 30 years ago. I was like, 'What?!'" [...] Director Webb said of his casting, [...] "e all trust Denis Leary. He's got this attitude, but you love him. In this movie, he puts pressure on Peter Parker. He's on Spider-Man's case, but you understand him. I've said this before, but good drama comes from competing ideas of what's good." ...|$|E
500|$|Steve Kloves was {{selected}} to write the screenplay. He described adapting the book as [...] "tough", as it did not [...] "lend itself to adaptation {{as well as the}} next two books." [...] Kloves often received synopses of books proposed as film adaptations from Warner Bros., which he [...] "almost never read", but Harry Potter jumped out at him. He went out and bought the book, and became an instant fan of the series. When speaking to Warner Bros., he stated that the film had to be British, and had to be true to the characters. Kloves was nervous when he first met Rowling as he did not want her to think he was going to [...] " [...] her baby." [...] Rowling admitted that she [...] "was really ready to hate this Steve Kloves," [...] but recalled her initial meeting with him: [...] "The <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> him, he said to me, 'You know who my favourite character is?' And I thought, You're gonna say Ron. I know you're gonna say Ron. But he said 'Hermione.' And I just kind of melted." [...] Rowling received a large amount of creative control, an arrangement that Columbus did not mind.|$|E
2500|$|I was on {{the verge}} of {{painting}} the Portrait of Jacques Nayral. He was to become my brother-in-law, and was one of the most sympathetic men I have ever met. A strange lad, a little surprising on first encounter - both disturbing because of his sharp use of irony and also attractive because of a generosity that left him as vulnerable as a child. The <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> him was at President Bonjean's house at Villepreux-les-Clayes, near Versailles, during a dinner which brought together the committee of that 'Villa Medicis Libre' which, as I said before, had been founded by Alexandre Mercereau. From that time onwards, we saw each other often and became friends.|$|E

2500|$|The {{stories of}} their {{encounters}} with other celebrities also became fodder for the press; for example, in May 1997, at The Prince's Trust 21st anniversary concert, Mel B and Geri Halliwell breached royal protocol when they planted kisses on Prince Charles's cheeks, leaving it covered with lipstick, and later, Halliwell told him [...] "you're very sexy" [...] and also pinched his bottom. In November, the British Royal Family were considered {{fans of the}} Spice Girls, including The Prince of Wales and his sons Prince William and Prince Harry. That month, South African President Nelson Mandela said: [...] "These are my heroes. This {{is one of the}} greatest moments in my life" [...] in an encounter organised by Prince Charles, who said, [...] "It is the second greatest moment in my life, the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> them was the greatest". Prince Charles would later send Halliwell a personal letter [...] "with lots of love" [...] when he heard that she had quit the Spice Girls. In 1998 the video game magazine Nintendo Power created The More Annoying Than the Spice Girls Award, adding: [...] "What could possibly have been more annoying in 1997 than the Spice Girls, you ask?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Ralph Parcaut {{was born}} in Iowa on December 3, 1896. His parents, Edward and Eva Parcaut, were farmers who, in 1894, had settled {{on a farm in}} Grant Township an area near Sutherland a small town in O'Brien County, Iowa. [...] They had a family of seven children. From an early age, Parcaut took a keen {{interest}} in wrestling with other boys and began to demonstrate considerable aptitude for the sport. In 1906, at the age of 15, a local wrestling fan, impressed with Parcaut's talent and potential, gave him $100.00, a considerable sum of money at the time, to seek training from famed wrestler and instructor Martin [...] "Farmer" [...] Burns. [...] At the time, Burns operated a school for wrestlers in Omaha, Nebraska where he taught [...] "catch as catch can" [...] or modern day freestyle wrestling and physical training. [...] Parcaut traveled to Omaha, his $100.00 buying him 10 lessons, as Farmer Burns charged $10.00 an hour for one-on-one wrestling instruction with students. [...] Burns instilled in young Parcaut what would become a lifelong regimen of training and most importantly, [...] "clean living." [...] As Parcaut recalled years later, [...] "I'll never forget the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> him in Omaha ... All {{the way back to the}} gymnasium he talked to me about the evils of drink and of smoking and even urged me not to partake of tea or coffee." ...|$|E

That's the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> ever <b>met</b> her, {{although}} <b>I</b> had often seen her and {{thought she was a}} stunner to look at.

60|$|But {{there was}} {{compensation}} for it all. For the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> the English lower classes face to face, and knew {{them for what}} they were.

60|$|About a {{month after}} the {{armistice}} had been signed I came down to my cottage again. Harburn was in the same train, and he gave me a lift from the station. He was more like his old good-humoured self, and asked me to dinner the next day. It was the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> had <b>met</b> him since the victory. We had a most excellent repast, and drank the health of the Future in some of his oldest port. Only when we had drawn up to the blazing wood fire in that softly lighted room, with our glasses beside us and two Airedales asleep at our feet, did he come round to his hobby.|$|R

60|$|There is a {{movement}} in favour of co-education, especially in elementary education, because, owing to the inadequate supply of schools, the girls tend {{to be left out}} altogether unless they can go to the same school as the boys. The <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> Professor and Mrs. Dewey was at a banquet in Chang-sha, given by the Tuchun. When the time came for after-dinner speeches, Mrs. Dewey told the Tuchun that his province must adopt co-education. He made a statesmanlike reply, saying that the matter should receive his best consideration, but he feared the time was not ripe in Hunan. However, {{it was clear that the}} matter was within the sphere of practical politics. At the time, being new to China and having imagined China a somewhat backward country, I was surprised. Later on I realized that reforms which we only talk about can be actually carried out in China.|$|E
60|$|Megaleep {{belongs to}} the tribe of Ishmael. Indeed, his Latin name, {{as well as his}} Indian one, signifies The Wanderer; and if you watch him a little while you will {{understand}} perfectly why he is called so. The <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> ever <b>met</b> him in summer, in strong contrast to the winter herd, made his name clear in a moment. It was twilight on a wilderness lake. I was sitting in my canoe by the inlet, wondering what kind of bait to use for a big trout which lived in an eddy behind a rock, and which disdained everything I offered him. The swallows were busy, skimming low, and taking the young mosquitoes as they rose from the water. One dipped to the surface near the eddy. As he came down I saw a swift gleam in the depths below. He touched the water; there was a swirl, a splash--and the swallow was gone. The trout had him.|$|R
60|$|I {{stood for}} a long time on the terrace, {{sometimes}} looking into the darkness in front of me, in case I might be blessed with another glimpse of her; sometimes with my eyes closed, so that I might recall and hold in my mind her passage down the steps.

But I felt I ought to face it out. You know by this time, no doubt, Miss Hazleden, that my mother was once a slave on your grandfather's estate. Now, it is a theory of mine--a little Quixotic, perhaps, but still a theory of mine--that the guilt and the shame of slavery lay with the slave-owners (forgive me if I must needs speak against your own class), and not with the slaves or their descendants. We have nothing on earth to be ashamed of.

There were those addressing occupational hearing conservation programs, military hearing conservation and conservation programs aimed at children through schools and museums. It was fascinating to me to learn that many attendees were not audiologists and knew relatively little about hearing and the auditory system. There were industrial hygienists, occupational health nurses, health and safety experts, health compliance officers and hearing conservation specialists. The common link between these individuals was their concern for protecting the hearing of the population they represent. As I am the immediate past president of the Academy of Rehabilitative Audiology (ARA), you might wonder why I am writing about hearing conservation rather than rehabilitation. After all, the purpose of the ARA is “to promote excellence in hearing care through the provision of comprehensive rehabilitative and habilitative services. ” The ARA is a small society, which, like the NHCA, consists of members who specialize in a variety of areas, including clinical, educational and rehabilitative audiology, psychology...|$|R

I had ridden up the Port Royal {{mountains}} that same morning from our decaying sugar estate in the Liguanca plain, and I was to stop in cantonments with the Major's wife, fat little Mrs. Venn, who had promised my mother that she would undertake to chaperon me to this my earliest military party. I won't deny that I looked forward to it immensely, for I was then a girl of only eighteen, fresh out from school in England, where I had been living away from our family ever since I was twelve years old. Dear mamma was a Jamaican lady of the old school, completely overpowered by the ingrained West Indian indolence; and if I had waited {{to go to a}} dance till I could get her to accompany me, I might have waited till Doomsday, or probably later. So I was glad enough to accept fat little Mrs. Venn's proffered protection, and to go up the hills on my sure-footed mountain pony; while Isaac, the black stable-boy, ran up behind me carrying on his thick head the small portmanteau that contained my plain white ball-dress.|$|R
