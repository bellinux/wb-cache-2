Although changes related to infectious disease and wound healing have provided the strongest evidence to date, the clinical importance of immunological dysregulation is highlighted by increased risks across diverse conditions and diseases. For example, stressors can produce profound health consequences. In one epidemiological study, all-cause mortality increased in the month following a severe stressor – the <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>spouse.</b> Theorists propose that stressful events trigger cognitive and affective responses which, in turn, induce sympathetic nervous system and endocrine changes, and these ultimately impair immune function.

50|$|Many {{types of}} {{relationships}} are not legitimized by society, therefore when {{one person in}} the relationship dies, the other may not have their grief legitimized so it can become disenfranchised. For example, following the <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> partner in a homosexual relationship societal supports can tend prioritize the immediate family, invalidating the significance of the romantic relationship and loss for the grieving partner (McNutt & Yakushko, 2013)..Another example may be a former partner, such as the <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ex-spouse (a person who the griever was previously married to, but eventually divorced). The <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ex-spouse does not typically receive the same recognition as the <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> current <b>spouse.</b> Another type of relationship is one in which the griever and the person who died did not necessarily have a close personal relationship. This relationship may include coworkers, doctor and patient relationships, or even people that the griever does not know personally at all, such as celebrities. Relationships formed online are often not recognized or validated by society, for example where friendships are made through online games and social media. However, when one person dies, the griever or person that did not die in the relationship will often experience disenfranchised grief (Doka, 1989).|$|R

[...] The grief experience is unique to each person. [...] Sharing and building a life with another human being, then learning to live singularly, can be an adjustment that is more complex than a person could ever expect.|$|E
2500|$|Furthermore, most {{couples have}} a {{division}} of 'tasks' or 'labor', e.g., the husband mows the yard, the wife pays the bills, etc. which, in addition to dealing with great grief and life changes, means added responsibilities for the bereaved. Immediately after the <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>spouse,</b> there are tasks that must be completed. [...] Planning and financing a funeral can be very difficult if pre-planning was not completed. [...] Changes in insurance, bank accounts, claiming of life insurance, securing childcare {{are just some of}} the issues that can be intimidating to someone who is grieving. [...] Social isolation may also become imminent, as many groups composed of couples find it difficult to adjust to the new identity of the bereaved, and the bereaved themselves have great challenges in reconnecting with others. Widows of many cultures, for instance, wear black for the rest of their lives to signify the loss of their spouse and their grief. Only in more recent decades has this tradition been reduced to a period of two years, while some religions such as Christian Orthodox many widows will still continue to wear black for the remainder of their lives.|$|E
40|$|Extract] Everyone {{experiences}} loss, grieving {{and death}} {{at some time}} during their life. People may suffer the loss of valued relationships through life changes, such as moving from one city to another, separation, divorce or the <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> parent, <b>spouse</b> or friend. People may grieve changing life roles as grown children leave home or they retire from their lifelong work. The loss of valued material objects through theft or natural disaster can evoke feelings of grief and loss. When people's lives are affected by civil or national strife, they may grieve the loss of valued ideals such as safety, freedom or democracy. In the clinical setting, the nurse encounters people who may be experiencing grief related to declining health, loss <b>of</b> <b>a</b> body part, terminal illness, or the impending <b>death</b> <b>of</b> self or <b>a</b> significant other. The nurse may also work with individuals in community settings who are grieving losses related to a personal crisis (e. g. divorce, separation) or a natural disaster, such as a bushfire or a cyclone.

40|$|Government {{policies}} {{attempt to}} mitigate the economic risks to households of major life transitions. This paper focuses on two such transitions that social security systems typically insure against—long term exits from the labor market (retirement, disability, unemployment insurance) and the <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> household head or spouse (survivor’s insurance). We examine labor force exits of men at various ages in four countries [...] Canada, Germany, Great Britain, and the United States—using data from the Cross-National Equivalent File, a matched longitudinal data set. We focus on how average net-of-tax household income changes {{in the years before}} and after the event. We find that when one measures the change in economic well-being following a labor market exit by the fraction of lost labor earnings replaced by social security income, the decline in the household’s economic well-being is substantially overstated. When we compare net-of-tax household income before and after a long term exit from the labor market, we find that such drops are much less than those implied by a social security replacement rate and that differences across countries in the average drop are much less than those based on a social security replacement rate. We find the same pattern when we focus on how net-of-tax household income changes in the years before and after the <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> head or <b>spouse.</b> Declines in net-of-tax household income following such a death are much lower than the decline implied by <b>a</b> replacement <b>of</b> the deceased person’s labor earnings and social security benefits by their household’s post-death social security income. But the size of the change in individualized net-of-tax income following the <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> head or <b>spouse</b> is greatly affected by assumptions used to adjust for changes in household size. ...|$|R

In 1866, Alexander II took a mistress, Princess Catherine Dolgorukya, with whom he would father three surviving children.

In 1880, however, following threats on Catherine's life, the tsar moved his mistress and their children into the Winter Palace, installing them in rooms directly above the apartments of his ailing wife. When Grand Duchess Marie Alexandrovna made a visit in May 1880, being warned that her mother was dying, she was horrified to learn of his father's mistress' living arrangements and confronted her father. Shocked by the loss of support from his daughter, he quietly retreated to Gatchina Palace for military reviews. The quarrel, however, evidently, jolted his conscience enough to lead him to return to St. Petersburg each morning to ask after his wife's health. The tsarina, however, had not much longer to live, dying on [...] On , Alexander II and Catherine were married in a secret ceremony at Tsarskoe Selo.

50|$|Elderly {{widows and}} widowers {{experience}} {{changes in their}} social lives prior to and following the <b>deaths</b> <b>of</b> their <b>spouses.</b> <b>A</b> study conducted by Rebecca L. Utz et al. (2002) revealed that elderly persons experiencing widowhood {{spent more time with}} family and friends than nonwidowed counterparts, based on the lifestyle changes that occur in elderly couples. Although widowed subjects were more likely to socialize with family and friends, they were no more likely to visit church or volunteer than the intact couples. This study also found that healthy spouses were reclusive while their significant other was on their deathbed, but due to <b>a</b> network <b>of</b> family and friends; the surviving spouse entered society being more social than had been prior to the <b>death</b> <b>of</b> their husband or wife. Elderly widows and widowers were more or less involved socially depending on the amount of support they had from family and friends. It has been noted that widows/widowers who have a close and supportive social network can counteract the effects of widowhood by remaining active in their social group. The loss <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>spouse</b> affects almost every domain of life, and as a consequence has a significant impact on wellbeing: psychological, social, physical, practical, and economic (Bennett, 2012). With all of these aspects <b>of</b> <b>a</b> widowed individuals being affected maintaining <b>a</b> sense <b>of</b> normality is important to help avoid depression like symptoms. Social support, as well as creating new lasting relationships through social interaction can help the process of bereavement go smoother for widow effected individuals.|$|R
40|$|Objective: Although {{the effects}} of adverse life events on mental health have been welldocumented in the literature, {{there has never been}} a {{population}} based study that investigatedsystematically the association between history of adverse life events and physical health(objective and subjective) in adults. Method: Cross-sectional, face-to-face householdpopulation based survey of adults (18 +) in Hong Kong (N= 1, 147). Participants were asked ifthey had <b>a</b> diagnosis <b>of</b> six health conditions including hypertension, heart disease, arthritis,diabetes, eyesight degeneration, and hearing loss. They were also asked if they hadexperienced five adverse life events including <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> partner or <b>spouse,</b> abuse, naturaldisaster, life threatening illness or injury, and family disruption. Interviews also included theShort-Form 12 Health Survey (SFHS- 12) and the short version of the Centre forEpidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). Results: Overall, results indicate thatspecific adverse life events may be associated with specific health conditions. However, alltested life events were associated with subjective physical and mental health. <b>Death</b> <b>of</b> partneror parent and life threatening illness or injury were found to have the strongest associationwith physical health problems. A dose-response relationship between adverse life events andphysical health in general was evident but more so for heart disease and eyesightdegeneration. Conclusion: Considering the high prevalence of traumatic events and howcommon the conditions associated with such events are in the general population, screeningfor adverse life events as part of comprehensive assessment will allow <b>a</b> deeperunderstanding <b>of</b> patients’ needs...|$|R
40|$|Medicaid {{is a joint}} federal-state {{partnership}} {{program that}} provides medical care to the elderly, blind, and disabled poor. Unlike Medicare, Medicaid will pay for long-term care, leading millions of persons in need of such care to “spend-down” income or assets to qualify as sufficiently needy or poor. However, the state can eventually seek recovery of expenditures made through estate recovery programs following the <b>death</b> <b>of</b> both <b>spouses.</b> <b>As</b> it currently stands, states {{have no choice but}} to become increasingly vigilant in pursuing private funds in order to pay for Medicaid expenditures. As a result, elderly citizens and their families will continue to face uncertainty over what will become of family assets demanded to pay for long-term care. This article examines what constitutes an “estate” for purposes of asset recovery to pay for long-term care expenditures.

Methods: Survey data was collected by two postal questionnaires. Baseline characteristics were obtained in 1998 and data on 19 specific stressful events (e. g. <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> child or <b>spouse</b> or divorce) within the six preceding months in 2003. Exposure to life events was indicated by a sum score weighted by mean severity of the events. Participants were linked to records of filled prescriptions for inhaled short-acting beta(2) -agonists from national registers from 2000 through 2006. The rates of purchases of short-acting beta(2) -agonists before (2000 2001), during (2002 2003) and after (2004 - 2006) the event exposure were estimated using repeated-measures Poisson regression analyses with the generalized estimating equation. Results: Of the 1102 participants, 162 (15 %) were exposed to highly stressful events, 205 (19 %) to less stressful events. During the 7 -year observation period, 5955 purchases of filled prescription for inhaled short-acting beta(2) -agonists were recorded. After exposure to highly stressful events, the rate of purchases of beta(2) -agonists was 1. 50 times higher (95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 05, 2. 13) than before the stressful event occurred. Among those with low or no exposure to life events, the corresponding rate ratios were not elevated (rate ratio 0. 81, 95 % CI: 0. 66, 0. 99 and 0. 95, 95 % CI: 0. 83, 1. 09 respectively). Conclusion: An increase in beta(2) -agonist usage after severe life events suggests that stressful experiences may worsen asthma symptoms...|$|R

The text is supported by a state-of-the art technology package to enhance the learning process. Chapter 43 : Everyone experiences loss, grieving and death at some time during his or her life. People may suffer the loss of valued relationships through life changes, such as moving from one city to another, separation, divorce or the <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> parent, <b>spouse</b> or friend. People may grieve changing life roles as they watch grown children leave home or they retire from their lifelong work.

In the clinical setting, the nurse encounters clients who may be experiencing grief related to declining health, loss <b>of</b> <b>a</b> body part, terminal illness, or the impending <b>death</b> <b>of</b> self or <b>a</b> significant other. The nurse may also work with clients in community settings who are grieving losses related to personal crisis (e. g. divorce, separation) or disaster (bushfires or cyclones). Therefore, it is important for the nurse to understand the significance of loss and develop the ability to assist clients as they work through the grieving process. Nurses may interact with dying clients and their families or caregivers in <b>a</b> variety <b>of</b> settings, from <b>a</b> foetal demise (<b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> unborn child), to the adolescent victim <b>of</b> <b>an</b> accident, to the elderly client who finally succumbs to a chronic illness.

(Clinical Psychology) North-West University, Mafikeng Campus, 2005 This {{study focused}} on the psychosocial effects and coping {{mechanisms}} of black widows in the Mafikeng area following the <b>death</b> <b>of</b> their <b>spouses.</b> <b>A</b> descriptive research design was used in collecting data. <b>A</b> sample <b>of</b> forty-eight black widows aged between twenty-five and seventy years was randomly selected for the purpose <b>of</b> this study. <b>A</b> questionnaire was administered to the sample. This questionnaire contained both open-ended and close-ended questions. Beck's Depression Inventory was also used {{in the collection of}} data to assess the level of depression if any. A descriptive statistical analysis of data was used to analyse the collected data. The findings indicated that most black widows experience psychological problems such as loneliness and depression due to withdrawal. There was also an indication that most black widows experienced social problems like being discriminated against and rejection by friends, relatives as well as neighbours due to the stigma associated with widowhood. However, there is an indication that some black widows do experience a positive perception from their employers and have a positive relationship with their in-laws. This study also confirmed that some black widows use inappropriate coping mechanisms such as withdrawal from the societal activities in fear of humiliation in dealing with their widowhood. Some resort to religion as another way of coping with their loss. The majority of older widows considered remarriage as a poor option while younger widows considered remarriage as viable. The grip on widows by traditional rituals is also diminishing especially among young, successful and educated widows. Having undertaken this study the implication is that black widows are mainly stigmatized in the society in which they live. They are even humiliated through restrictions that are put before them. For instance, performance of rituals and customs. Some of those who are employed experience a negative perception from both their employers and their colleagues because of the stigma. However. there still some black widows who still enjoy the moral support of their in-laws, employers and also that of their colleagues. Master...|$|R
