40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{the impact of}} the quality of nursing diagnoses, <b>interventions,</b> <b>and</b> outcomes in an acute care hospital following the implementation of an educational program. METHOD: In a pretest-posttest experimental design study, nurses from 12 wards of a Swiss hospital received an educational intervention [...] an introductory class and consecutive classes, using a case discussion method [...] to implement nursing diagnoses, <b>interventions,</b> <b>and</b> outcomes. Two sets of 36 randomly selected nursing records were evaluated before and after implementation. The quality of documented nursing diagnoses, <b>interventions,</b> <b>and</b> nursing-sensitive patient outcomes was assessed by 29 Likert-type items with a 0 - 4 scale instrument, called Quality of Nursing Diagnoses, <b>Interventions,</b> <b>and</b> Outcomes (Q-DIO) and tested using t-tests. FINDINGS: Significant enhancements in the quality of documented nursing diagnoses, <b>interventions,</b> <b>and</b> outcomes were found following the implementation of a planned educational program. CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of NANDA, NIC, and NOC (NNN) nursing diagnoses, <b>interventions,</b> <b>and</b> outcomes led to higher quality of nursing diagnosis documentation, etiology-specific nursing <b>interventions,</b> <b>and</b> nursing-sensitive patient outcomes. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: Educational measures support nurses to improve documentation of diagnoses, <b>interventions,</b> <b>and</b> outcomes. The Q-DIO is a useful audit tool...|$|R
40|$|IntroductionDespite much research, {{interventions}} to improve medication adherence report disappointing and inconsistent results. Tailored approaches that match <b>interventions</b> <b>and</b> patient determinants of non-adherence were seldom used in clinical trials. The {{presence of a}} multitude of theoretical frameworks and models to categorize <b>interventions</b> <b>and</b> patient determinants complicated the development of common categories shared by <b>interventions</b> <b>and</b> determinants. We retrieved potential <b>interventions</b> <b>and</b> patient determinants from published literature on medication adherence, matched them like locks and keys, and categorized them according to the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF). MethodsWe identified the most relevant literature reviews on <b>interventions</b> <b>and</b> determinants in a pragmatic literature search, extracted all <b>interventions</b> <b>and</b> determinants, grouped similar concepts to umbrella terms and assigned them to TDF categories. All steps were finalized in consensus discussion between the authors. ResultsSixteen articles (5 with determinants, 11 with interventions) were included for analysis. We extracted 103 <b>interventions</b> <b>and</b> 42 determinants that we divided in 26 modifiable and 16 unmodifiable determinants. All <b>interventions</b> <b>and</b> modifiable determinants were matched within 11 categories (Knowledge; Skills; Social/professional role and identity; Beliefs about capabilities; Beliefs about consequences; Intentions; Memory, Attention and decision processes; Environmental context and resources; Social influences; Emotion; and Behavioral regulation). ConclusionIn published trials on medication adherence, the congruence between <b>interventions</b> <b>and</b> determinants can be assessed with matching {{interventions to}} determinants. To be successful, interventions in medication adherence should target current modifiable determinants and be tailored to the unmodifiable determinants. Modifiable and unmodifiable determinants need to be assessed at inclusion of intervention studies to identify the patients {{most in need of}} an adherence intervention. Our matched categories may be useful to develop interventions in trials that investigate the effectiveness of adherence interventions...|$|R

5|$|A {{social control}} program was {{implemented}} whereby local unions took on responsibility for ensuring that this quota was not exceeded; in doing so, {{they hoped to}} remove the need for military and police <b>intervention,</b> <b>and</b> thus stem the violence of previous decades.

5|$|Cardiovascular {{disease is}} the leading cause of death (30%) amongst women in the United States, and the leading cause of chronic disease amongst them, {{affecting}} nearly 40% (Gronowski and Schindler, Tables I and IV). The onset occurs at a later age in women than in men. For instance the incidence of stroke in women under the age of 80 is less than that in men, but higher in those aged over 80. Overall the lifetime risk of stroke in women exceeds that in men. The risk of cardiovascular disease amongst those with diabetes and amongst smokers is also higher in women than in men. Many aspects of cardiovascular disease vary between women and men, including risk factors, prevalence, physiology, symptoms, response to <b>intervention</b> <b>and</b> outcome.|$|E
5|$|Favaloro became {{interested}} in developments in cardiovascular <b>intervention,</b> <b>and</b> developed an enthusiasm for thoracic surgery.

With few resources and rudimentary English, he decided to travel to Cleveland. He first worked as a resident and later as a member of the surgical team, working with Donald B. Effler, head of cardiovascular surgery, F. Mason Sones, Jr., who was in charge of the Angiography Laboratory and William L. Proudfit, head of the Department of Cardiology.|$|E

5|$|The {{principle}} of individual freedom in society was already {{one of the}} central points in the FPÖ (and VdU's) programme during the 1950s. The party did not regard its liberalism and its pan-German, nationalist positions as contradictory. From the late 1980s through the 1990s, the party developed economically, supporting tax reduction, less state <b>intervention</b> <b>and</b> more privatisation. Starting in the late 2000s, the party has taken a more populist tack, combining this position with support for the welfare state. It criticised unemployment and alleged welfare-state abuse by immigrants which, it said, threatened the welfare state and pensioners' benefits.|$|E

Verlooy and Vandermersh were arrested and imprisoned. Vonck and his remaining supporters forced into exile in Lille where they tried to raise opposition to the Statists but in vain. Faced with an increasingly reactionary government in the United Belgian States, many of the exiled Vonckists felt that they had more to gain from negotiating with Leopold II than with the revolutionaries. Amid rumours of Austrian military forces nearing Belgium, the Statists put their faith in a foreign military <b>intervention</b> <b>and</b> began lobbying the Prussians, who were believed to be sympathetic, for support.|$|E
5|$|According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Indian {{economy in}} 2017 was {{nominally}} worth US$2.454 trillion; {{it is the}} sixth-largest economy by market exchange rates, and is, at US$9.489 trillion, the third-largest by purchasing power parity, or PPP. With its average annual GDP growth rate of 5.8% {{over the past two}} decades, and reaching 6.1% during 2011–12, India is one of the world's fastest-growing economies. However, the country ranks 140th in the world in nominal GDP per capita and 129th in GDP per capita at PPP. Until 1991, all Indian governments followed protectionist policies that were influenced by socialist economics. Widespread state <b>intervention</b> <b>and</b> regulation largely walled the economy off from the outside world. An acute balance of payments crisis in 1991 forced the nation to liberalise its economy; since then it has slowly moved towards a free-market system by emphasising both foreign trade and direct investment inflows.

Another of Eisenhower's concerns was {{the possibility of a}} wider war with the Soviet Union after it threatened to intervene on the Egyptian side. Eisenhower applied financial leverage by threatening to sell US reserves of the British pound and thereby precipitate a collapse of the British currency. Though the invasion force was militarily successful in its objectives, UN <b>intervention</b> <b>and</b> US pressure forced Britain into a humiliating withdrawal of its forces, and Eden resigned.|$|E
