Depending on its similarity to other Grevillea species it is possibly that it can remain dormant for up to four years. Any recruitment that does occur via seed {{is believed to be}} <b>event</b> <b>driven,</b> relying on the combination of above average rainfall and the appropriate temperature.

25|$|Property {{taxes are}} usually charged on a {{recurrent}} basis (e.g., yearly). A {{common type of}} property tax is an annual charge on the ownership of real estate, where the tax base is the estimated value of the property. For a period of over 150 years from 1695 a window tax was levied in England, {{with the result that}} one can still see listed buildings with windows bricked up in order to save their owners money. A similar tax on hearths existed in France and elsewhere, with similar results. The two most common type of <b>event</b> <b>driven</b> property taxes are stamp duty, charged upon change of ownership, and inheritance tax, which is imposed in many countries on the estates of the deceased.|$|E

30|$|Our results {{indicate}} that most focal mechanisms are categorized into three groups, and the depths in each group are distinct: (1) N–S tensional <b>events</b> <b>driven</b> by normal faulting occur mainly in the shallower part of the area; (2) E–W compressional-type <b>events,</b> <b>driven</b> by reverse faulting, occur mainly {{in the middle of}} the depth range; and (3) N–S tensional and E–W compressional events (i.e. strike-slip-type) occur mainly at the greatest depths (Fig.  8).|$|R
2500|$|Another area of {{knowledge}} representation research {{was the problem}} of common sense reasoning. [...] One of the first realizations from trying to make software that can function with human natural language was that humans regularly draw on an extensive foundation {{of knowledge}} about the real world that we simply take for granted but that is not at all obvious to an artificial agent. [...] Basic principles of common sense physics, causality, intentions, etc. An example is the frame problem, that in an <b>event</b> <b>driven</b> logic there need to be axioms that state things maintain position from one moment to the next unless they are moved by some external force. In order to make a true artificial intelligence agent that can converse with humans using natural language and can process basic statements and questions about the world it is essential to represent this kind of knowledge. One of the most ambitious programs to tackle this problem was Doug Lenat's Cyc project. Cyc established its own Frame language and had large numbers of analysts document various areas of common sense reasoning in that language. The knowledge recorded in Cyc included common sense models of time, causality, physics, intentions, and many others.|$|E
2500|$|Jobs {{stated that}} because [...] "customization really is mostly {{software}} now ... {{most of the}} options in other computers are in Mac", unlike the Apple II the Macintosh 128K did not need slots, which he described as costly and requiring larger size and more power. It was not upgradable by the user and only Apple service centers were permitted to open the case. All accessories were external, such as the MacCharlie that added IBM PC compatibility. There was no provision for adding internal storage, more RAM or any upgrade cards, however some of the Macintosh engineers objected to Jobs's ideas and secretly developed workarounds for them. As an example, the Macintosh {{was supposed to have}} only 17 address lines on the motherboard, enough to support 128k of system RAM, but the design team added an additional two address lines without Jobs's knowledge, making it possible to expand the computer to 512k, although the actual act of upgrading system RAM was difficult and required piggybacking additional RAM chips overtop the onboard 4164 chips. In September 1984, after months of complaints over the Mac's inadequate RAM, Apple released an official 512k machine. Although this had always been planned from the beginning, Steve Jobs maintained if the user desired more RAM than the Mac 128 provided, he should simply pay extra money for a Mac 512 rather than upgrade the computer himself. When the Mac 512 was released, Apple rebranded the original model as [...] "Macintosh 128k" [...] and modified the motherboard to allow easier RAM upgrades. Improving on the hard-wired RAM thus required a motherboard replacement (which was priced similarly to a new computer), or a third-party chip replacement upgrade, which was not only expensive but would void Apple's warranty. The difficulty of fitting software into its limited free memory, coupled with the new interface and <b>event</b> <b>driven</b> programming model, discouraged software vendors from supporting it, leaving the 128K with a relatively small software library. Whereas the Macintosh Plus, {{and to a lesser extent}} the Macintosh 512K, are compatible with much later software, the 128K is limited to specially crafted programs. A stock Mac 128K with the original 64K ROM is neither compatible with Apple's external 800 KB drive with HFS nor with Apple's Hard Disk 20. A Mac 128K that has been upgraded with the newer 128K ROM (called a Macintosh 128Ke) can use internal and external 800 KB drives with HFS, as well as the HD20. Both can print on an AppleShare network, but neither can do file sharing because of their limited RAM.|$|E

40|$|In {{this article}} we present data and {{modelling}} for the quiet Sun that strongly suggest a ubiquitous small-scale atmospheric heating mechanism that is driven solely by converging supergranular flows. A possible energy source for such events is the power transfer to the plasma via the work done on the magnetic field by photospheric convective flows, which exert drag of the footpoints of magnetic structures. In this paper we present evidence of small scale energy release <b>events</b> <b>driven</b> directly by the hydrodynamic forces that act on the magnetic elements in the photosphere, {{as a result of}} supergranular scale flows. We show strong spatial and temporal correlation between quiet Sun soft X-ray emission (from Yohkoh and SOHO MDI-derived flux removal <b>events</b> <b>driven</b> by deduced photospheric flows. We also present a simple model of heating generated by flux submergence, based on particle acceleration by converging magnetic mirrors.

40|$|SummaryHundreds of molecular-level {{changes within}} central {{metabolism}} allow a cell {{to adapt to}} the changing environment. A primary challenge in cell physiology is to identify which of these molecular-level changes are active regulatory events. Here, we introduce pseudo-transition analysis, an approach that uses multiple steady-state observations of 13 C-resolved fluxes, metabolites, and transcripts to infer which regulatory <b>events</b> <b>drive</b> metabolic adaptations following environmental transitions. Pseudo-transition analysis recapitulates known biology and identifies an unexpectedly sparse, transition-dependent regulatory landscape: typically a handful of regulatory <b>events</b> <b>drive</b> adaptation between carbon sources, with transcription mainly regulating TCA cycle flux and reactants regulating EMP pathway flux. We verify these observations using time-resolved measurements of the diauxic shift, demonstrating that some dynamic transitions can be approximated as monotonic shifts between steady-state extremes. Overall, we show that pseudo-transition analysis can explore the vast regulatory landscape of dynamic transitions using relatively few steady-state data, thereby guiding time-consuming, hypothesis-driven molecular validations...|$|R
