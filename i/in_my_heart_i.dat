5|$|It {{happened}} {{on my last}} day in Hanoi. I was exhausted and an emotional wreck after the 2-week visit... The translator {{told me that the}} soldiers wanted to sing me a song. He translated as they sung. It was a song about the day 'Uncle Ho' declared their country's independence in Hanoi's Ba Dinh Square. I heard these words: 'All men are created equal; they are given certain rights; among these are life, Liberty and Happiness.' These are the words Ho pronounced at the historic ceremony. I began to cry and clap. 'These young men should not be our enemy. They celebrate the same words Americans do.' The soldiers asked me to sing for them in return... I memorized a song called 'Day Ma Di', written by anti-war South Vietnamese students. I knew I was slaughtering it, but everyone seemed delighted that I was making the attempt. I finished. Everyone was laughing and clapping, including me... Here is my best, honest recollection of what happened: someone (I don't remember who) led me towards the gun, and I sat down, still laughing, still applauding. It all {{had nothing to do with}} where I was sitting. I hardly even thought about where I was sitting. The cameras flashed... It is possible that it was a set up, that the Vietnamese had it all planned. I will never know. But if they did I can't blame them. The buck stops here. If I was used, I allowed it to happen... a two-minute lapse of sanity that will haunt me forever... But the photo exists, delivering its message regardless of what I was doing or feeling. I carry this heavy <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>heart.</b> <b>I</b> have apologized numerous times for any pain I may have caused servicemen and their families because of this photograph. It was never my intention to cause harm.|$|E
500|$|Feller {{estimated}} that military service cost {{him at least}} 100 career wins. Based on his exceptional 1941 and 1946 seasons, {{it is likely that}} Feller would have finished his career with more than 300 wins and perhaps 3,800 strikeouts. Feller said [...] "I know <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>heart</b> <b>I</b> would have ended up a lot closer to 400than 300if I hadn't spent four seasons in the Navy. But don't take that as a complaint. I'm happy I got home in one piece." ...|$|E
500|$|When Juventus played Fiorentina on 7 April 1991, Baggio {{refused to}} take a penalty, stating Fiorentina goalkeeper Gianmatteo Mareggini knew him too well. However, Luigi De Agostini, Baggio's replacement, missed the penalty and Juventus {{eventually}} lost the match. When Baggio was substituted, {{he picked up a}} Fiorentina scarf thrown onto the field, a gesture which, although appreciated by his former club's fans, caused outrage amongst the Juventus supporters, who were initially reluctant to accept Baggio. He claimed, [...] "Deep <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>heart</b> <b>I</b> am always purple," [...] the colour of Fiorentina.|$|E

The vocals were produced by Curtis [...] "Sauce" [...] Wilson, with Gregg Rominiecki engineering Big Sean's vocals. Serban Ghenea handled the mixing of the track, which was engineered by John Hanes, and finally the mix was mastered by Aya Merrill and Tom Coyne. It is a minimal hip-hop piano ballad lament that utilizes instrumentation from strings and a drum machine. It is about a couple trying to [...] "make up their minds {{about the future of}} their relationship, with deep affection buried underneath their problems."

500|$|In March 2016, the Los Angeles Times {{announced}} that the Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre would close in the fall, during its thirty-fifth year of seasonal performances. Prior to {{the news of the}} closure, City of Irvine officials discussed continuing the expansion of a local apartment development, which would be built atop the site. Representatives working with Stefani announced on September 9, 2016, that she would be the final act to perform in the theater in an event called Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre Final Shows, before deconstruction of the facilities began. She spoke of its closure: [...] "I have so many memories at Irvine Meadows [...] It has been such an important part of my life both as an artist and as a fan and it will always hold a special place <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>heart.</b> <b>I</b> am humbled to perform there once again as it comes to a close." [...] In an interview earlier in the week on a California radio show, she expressed her devastation at the closure. It was the venue for her first live performance with her band No Doubt opening for Ziggy Marley in 1990.|$|E
500|$|Supporters of Rangel {{argued that}} by {{comparison}} with previous cases, a reprimand {{would be a more}} fitting punishment for Rangel's trangressions than censure. [...] Rangel repeatedly insisted, as he had all along, that nothing he had done was with the aim of enriching himself. [...] It was to no avail. [...] On December 2, 2010, a motion was made in the full House to censure Rangel. [...] Ethics committee chair Zoe Lofgren emphasized that it was Rangel's [...] "accumulation of actions" [...] that warranted the stiffer penalty, and said that the treatment of Rangel should set a new precedent, not follow old ones. [...] A motion to amend the resolution in favor of reprimand was voted down 267–146; most of Speaker Pelosi's allies rejected it and over 105 Democrats voted the resolution down. [...] The House of Representatives then voted 333–79 to censure Rangel. Per custom, Rangel went to the well of the House to hear Speaker Pelosi solemnly read the formal measure of censure. It had been 27 years since the last such measure and Rangel was only the 23rd House member to be censured. Rangel asked to speak and said, [...] "I know <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>heart</b> <b>I</b> am not going to be judged by this Congress. I’ll be judged by my life in its entirety." ...|$|E

500|$|One dispute {{among the}} founders of Century 21 – Gerry and Sylvia Anderson, Reg Hill and John Read – emerged from the filming of other scenes, {{including}} {{one in which the}} character of Lise Hartman bathes in a shower. Read, the director of photography, had complied with Parrish's instructions to light the sequence in silhouette. Anderson, who had intended the scene to display full-frontal nudity from actress Loni von Friedl, demanded a re-shoot, insisting that Read honour his obligations not just to Parrish as director but also to his Century 21 partners. According to Sylvia Anderson, [...] "Gerry was very keen to show that {{he was part of the}} 'Swinging Sixties' and felt that seeing a detailed nude shot – as he visualised it – was more 'with it' than the more subdued version." [...] Anderson clashed with Read and Parrish for a second time when special effects shots of Phoenix were filmed with a hand-held camera: [...] "I knew enough about space travel to know that in a vacuum a spacecraft will travel as straight as a die... told me that people were not familiar with space travel and therefore they would expect to see this kind of movement." [...] Refusing to re-film the scenes on the basis that Parrish's instructions had precedence over Anderson's, Read resigned from both Century 21 and the production of Doppelgänger at the Andersons' and Hill's request. Anderson elaborated: [...] "Clearly John was in a difficult position. I do now understand how he must have felt, but <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>heart</b> <b>I</b> feel he couldn't play a double role." ...|$|E
500|$|Stevens {{and other}} {{radicals}} were frustrated at how slow Lincoln was to adopt their policies for emancipation; according to Brodie, [...] "Lincoln seldom succeeded in matching Stevens's pace, though both were marching towards the same bright horizon". In April 1862, Stevens {{wrote to a}} friend, [...] "As for future hopes, they are poor as Lincoln is nobody." [...] The radicals aggressively pushed the issue, provoking Lincoln to comment: [...] "Stevens, Sumner and [...] Wilson simply haunt me with their importunities for a Proclamation of Emancipation. Wherever I go and whatever way I turn, they are on my tail, and still <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>heart,</b> <b>I</b> have the deep conviction that the hour [...] has not yet come." [...] The President stated that {{if it came to}} a showdown between the radicals and their enemies, he would have to side with Stevens and his fellows, and deemed them [...] "the unhandiest devils in the world to deal with" [...] but [...] "with their faces... set Zionwards". Although Lincoln composed his proclamation in June and July 1862, the secret was held within his Cabinet, and the President turned aside radical pleadings to issue one until after the Union victory at the Battle of Antietam in September. [...] Stevens quickly adopted the Emancipation Proclamation for use in his successful reelection campaign. When Congress returned in December, Stevens maintained his criticism of Lincoln's policies, calling them [...] "flagrant usurpations, deserving the condemnation of the community". Stevens generally opposed Lincoln's plans to colonize freed slaves abroad, though sometimes he supported emigration proposals for political reasons. Stevens wrote a nephew in June 1863 saying, [...] "The slaves ought to be incited to insurrection and give the rebels a taste of real civil war." ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{moving back}} to California, Emery pursued {{a career as a}} film {{producer}} and editor in comedy-related films and TV shows. In 2005, he gained national attention as the editor of The Aristocrats, a documentary about the eponymous dirty joke as told by various comedians. In an interview, he said of the film [...] "he imagery and descriptions that appear in the film are far beyond offensive by conventional standards but not for the sake of shocking the viewer, but to entertain the entertainer. That is one very important point that The Aristocrats makes." [...] His friend Paul Provenza, who directed the movie, praised Emery's editing work, crediting it with shaping the style and shape of the film. Emery in turn said in an interview [...] "The Aristocrats was the film that put me on the map, so it holds a very special place <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>heart.</b> <b>I</b> feel I owe my entire career to the generosity of Paul Provenza and Penn Jillette." ...|$|E
2500|$|One of Wilson's {{earliest}} memories {{was hearing}} Glenn Miller's 1943 recording of George Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue (1924), later citing it as a pivotal influence in his {{development as a}} composer. He recalled: [...] "Around our house, when I was a child, I heard things from my parents' record collection like Les Paul and Mary Ford, Tennessee Ernie Ford, Rosemary Clooney, and the Four Freshmen. Those were my first inspirations. To try to describe exactly what each influence was is hard to explain because it's very subtle, {{but it can be}} felt when you listen to my music. I don't think people realize just how much Rosemary Clooney affected my singing. She taught me to sing with love <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>heart</b> ... <b>I</b> would sing along with it , studying her phrasing, and that's how I learned to sing with feeling." [...] John Sebastian of the Lovin' Spoonful noted, [...] "Brian had control of this vocal palette of which we had no idea. We had never paid attention to the Four Freshmen or doo-wop combos like the Crew Cuts. Look what gold he mined out of that." [...] Carl speculated that it was Mike Love who got Brian into doo-wop music.|$|E
