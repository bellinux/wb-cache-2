5|$|In October 1864, delegates for {{confederation}} met in Quebec City for the Quebec Conference, {{where the}} Seventy-Two Resolutions were agreed to—they would <b>form</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> Canada's government. The Great Coalition was endangered by Taché's 1865 death: Lord Monck asked Macdonald to become premier, but Brown {{felt that he}} had as good a claim on the position as his coalition partner. The disagreement was resolved by appointing another compromise candidate to serve as titular premier, Narcisse-Fortunat Belleau.|$|E
5|$|In September 1944, the Belgian, the Netherlands and Luxembourgish {{governments in}} exile began formulating an {{agreement}} over {{the creation of}} a Benelux Customs Union. The agreement was signed in the London Customs Convention on 5 September 1944, just days before the Belgian government returned to Brussels after the liberation. The Benelux Customs Union was a major extension of a pre-war union between Belgium and Luxembourg, and would later <b>form</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> the Benelux Economic Union after 1958.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the most}} {{distinctive}} features of Golden Sun is the collection and manipulation of creatures called Djinn.

Attaching different Djinn to different characters modifies that character's character class, subsequently modifying hit points, Psynergy points, and other statistics, as well as determining what Psynergy the character is able to perform.|$|E
5|$|Skeptics {{argue that}} the North American Union exists only as a {{proposal}} contained in one of a thousand academic and/or policy papers published each year that advocate all manner of idealistic but ultimately unrealistic approaches to social, economic and political problems. Most of these are passed around in their own circles and eventually filed away and forgotten by junior staffers in congressional offices.

The main surviving texts are the chapters on sea combat (peri naumachias) in the Tactica of Leo the Wise and Nikephoros Ouranos (both drawing extensively from the Naumachiai of Syrianos Magistros and other earlier works), complemented by relevant passages in the De Administrando Imperio of Constantine Porphyrogennetos and other works by Byzantine and Arab writers.|$|E

5|$|Before the {{evacuation}} of the St Kildian inhabitants, these sheep were farmed. However, when the St Kilda archipelago's human inhabitants were evacuated in 1930, the sheep of Hirta were also removed and in 1932 they were replaced by Soays, which still live there {{as well as on}} Soay itself. Meanwhile, the remaining sheep on Boreray were left to become feral; these became the only survivors of the crofters' sheep, {{and one of the few}} surviving descendants of the Dunface. This means that they are the original, unmodified sheep that used to be farmed on the island. In the 1970s half a dozen of them were exported to <b>form</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> a breeding population on the mainland, but the majority of Borerays still remain on the island.|$|E
5|$|Carl (Martin Sheen's character) {{represents}} {{the working class}} in the film: he is the union leader for the maintenance workers at Bluestar. He constantly attacks big business, money, mandatory drug screening, greedy manufacturers, and anything that he sees {{as a threat to}} his union. The conflict between Gekko's relentless pursuit of wealth and Carl Fox's leftward leanings <b>form</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> the film's subtext. This subtext could be described as the concept of the two fathers battling for control over the morals of the son, a concept Stone had also used in Platoon. In Wall Street the hard-working Carl Fox and the cutthroat businessman Gordon Gekko represent the fathers. The producers of the film use Carl as their voice in the film, a voice of reason amid the creative destruction brought about by Gekko's unrestrained personal philosophy.|$|E
5|$|In response, the Senate {{appointed}} a committee chaired by Robert Morris to draft the necessary specifications and {{legislation that would}} officially create a federal mint and coinage. The committee presented a bill before Congress on December 21, 1791, which stated in part that the new dollar coin (which was to <b>form</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> the United States monetary system) should contain 371 grains of silver and a total weight of 416 grains, as Hamilton had earlier recommended. The new silver coins were to be struck in an alloy containing 1,485parts out of 1,664 (about 89.24 percent) fine silver, with the remainder copper, intended to equal the silver in Spanish dollars. However, an assay of the Spanish dollars was in error—they were in fact 65/72 silver (about 90.28 percent) with the remainder copper.|$|E

5|$|John's French defeats {{weakened}} {{his position}} in England. The rebellion of his English vassals resulted in the Magna Carta, which limited royal power and established common law. This would <b>form</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> every constitutional battle of the 13th and 14th centuries. The barons and the crown failed {{to abide by the}} Magna Carta, leading to the First Barons' War when rebel barons provoked an invasion by Prince Louis. Many historians use John's death and William Marshall's appointment as protector of nine-year-old Henry III to mark the end of the Angevin period {{and the beginning of the}} Plantagenet dynasty. Marshall won the war with victories at Lincoln and Dover in 1217, leading to the Treaty of Lambeth in which Louis renounced his claims. In victory, the Marshal Protectorate reissued the Magna Carta as the basis of future government.|$|E
5|$|Mackintosh {{returned}} to England in June 1909. On {{reporting to the}} P & O, he was informed that due to his impaired sight he was discharged. Without immediate prospects of employment, he agreed, early in 1910, to accompany Douglas Mawson (who {{had served as a}} geologist on the Nimrod Expedition and was later to lead the Australasian Antarctic Expedition) on a trip to Hungary, to survey a potential goldfield which Shackleton was hoping would <b>form</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> a lucrative business venture. Despite a promising report from Mawson, nothing came of this. Mackintosh later launched his own treasure-hunting expedition to Cocos Island off the Panama Pacific coast, but again returned home empty-handed.|$|E
5|$|Ordinary {{quantum field}} theories, which <b>form</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> modern {{elementary}} particle physics, are defined in flat Minkowski space, {{which is an}} excellent approximation {{when it comes to}} describing the behavior of microscopic particles in weak gravitational fields like those found on Earth. In order to describe situations in which gravity is strong enough to influence (quantum) matter, yet not strong enough to require quantization itself, physicists have formulated quantum field theories in curved spacetime. These theories rely on general relativity to describe a curved background spacetime, and define a generalized quantum field theory to describe the behavior of quantum matter within that spacetime. Using this formalism, it can be shown that black holes emit a blackbody spectrum of particles known as Hawking radiation leading to the possibility that they evaporate over time. As briefly mentioned above, this radiation plays an important role for the thermodynamics of black holes.|$|E
