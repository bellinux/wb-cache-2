Under the act, the profits on the sale of a personal residence ($500,000 for married couples, $250,000 for singles) were exempted if lived in for at least 2 years over the last 5.

5|$|Largely as {{a result}} of {{lobbying}} by Children's Healthcare is a Legal Duty, the government eliminated the HEW regulation in 1983, but 39 states, Guam and the District of Columbia still had religious exemptions in their civil codes on child abuse and neglect as of February 2015. Forty-eight US states allowed religious exemptions for compulsory vaccination as of June 2015.

5|$|Indiana's volunteers {{responded to}} {{requests}} for military service {{in the early months}} of the war; however, as the war progressed and the number of casualties increased, the state government had to resort to conscription (the draft) to fill its quotas. Military conscription, which began in October 1862, was a divisive issue within the state. It was especially unpopular among Democrats, who viewed it as a threat to individual freedom and opposed legislation that allowed a man to purchase an <b>exemption</b> <b>for</b> $300 or pay another person to serve as his substitute. A total of 3,003 Hoosier men were drafted in October 1862; subsequent drafts in Indiana brought the total to 17,903.|$|E

5|$|Lollapalooza, {{an annual}} summer music festival in Grant Park, was exempt from taxation. Emanuel's brother Ari is the co-CEO of William Morris Endeavor, which co-owns the event. In 2011 Rahm Emanuel asked the City Council to appoint an {{independent}} third party negotiator, {{to avoid having}} the negotiation seen as biased. Although the deal was reached before Emanuel took office, tax breaks must be negotiated every year. It was later revealed that the festival received its tax <b>exemption</b> <b>for</b> 2011 {{in the final days}} of the Daley administration. In 2012, Lollapalooza paid taxes for the first time in seven years and extended its contract to host in Grant Park through 2021.|$|E
5|$|One major anomaly {{remained}} in the railway's operations: the 1889 Regulation of Railways Act had required, amongst other measures, that all British passenger trains be fitted with continuous brakes. McConnel had secured an <b>exemption</b> <b>for</b> the Talyllyn Railway, {{on the basis that}} the low speed of operation meant they were unnecessary and that the cost of compliance would bankrupt the enterprise, {{but by the end of}} the 1990s the Railway Inspectorate was insisting that the Talyllyn be brought into compliance with the act, a little over 100years after it had passed. By 2001, the railway had fitted its entire passenger fleet with the necessary equipment, operated by air brake pumps mounted on the locomotives.|$|E
5|$|When Selvo {{approached}} the city, Guiscard's ships had already {{anchored in the}} harbor at Durazzo. Though the battle was fierce, superior tactics by the skilled Venetian fleet overpowered the inexperienced Normans who were mostly used to land battles. The battered fleet led by Guiscard retreated into the harbor after losing many ships. Victorious at sea, Selvo left the fleet {{under the command of}} his son and returned to Venice a hero. Because of the help given to the Byzantine Empire, the Republic of Venice was awarded a Golden Bull: a decree by Emperor Alexios I Komnenos granting Venice many privileges, including a tax <b>exemption</b> <b>for</b> Venetian merchants, that would be crucial for the future economic and political expansion of Venice in the eastern Mediterranean.|$|E

5|$|While Speer had {{tremendous}} power, {{he was of}} course subordinate to Hitler. Nazi officials sometimes went around Speer by seeking direct orders from the dictator. When Speer ordered peacetime building work suspended, the Gauleiters (Nazi Party district leaders) obtained an <b>exemption</b> <b>for</b> their pet projects. When Speer sought the appointment of Hanke as a labor czar to optimize the use of German and slave labor, Hitler, {{under the influence of}} Martin Bormann, instead appointed Fritz Sauckel. Rather than increasing female labor and taking other steps to better organize German labor, as Speer favored, Sauckel advocated importing more slave labour from the occupied nations– and did so, obtaining workers for (among other things) Speer's armament factories, often using the most brutal methods.|$|E
5|$|Chesney served {{again as}} the leader of Stephen's army at Wallingford Castle in 1153 and in August he was {{defeated}} by Henry of Anjou. The subsequent peace settlement, the Treaty of Wallingford, gave Henry the English throne after Stephen's death. A part of the treaty awarded control of Oxford Castle to Roger de Bussy. Although Chesney had lost control of the castle, none of his lands were confiscated. Early in 1154, Chesney was with Henry, as he was a witness on two charters of Henry's. After Henry's ascension to the throne, Chesney came to terms with the new king, and received confirmation of his lands from the king by 1157. He spent time in Normandy with Henry from 1159 through to 1161. He continued to receive favours from the king, such as <b>exemption</b> <b>for</b> payment of danegeld on his manor of Deddington in 1156.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, Danny Gardella, who {{had left}} the New York Giants for the Mexican League in 1946, filed suit against Major League Baseball, {{claiming}} Chandler's ban on players {{who went to the}} Mexican League had denied him a means of pursuing his livelihood. Gardella demanded $100,000 in damages from the suspension, and claimed that the award should be tripled because baseball was subject to federal antitrust laws. Similar suits were filed by Max Lanier and Fred Martin, both of whom also played in Mexico. On June 2, 1949, a federal court refused to reinstate the three players pending their trials, but urged that the antitrust issues be adjudicated as soon as possible. Attempting to alleviate the legal pressure on Major League Baseball, Chandler lifted the bans on players who had gone to Mexico, reinstating them almost two years early. Lanier and Martin dropped their suits, but Gardella pursued his. After Gardella's lawyer publicly questioned Chandler in court about baseball's antitrust <b>exemption</b> <b>for</b> {{a day and a half}} in September 1949, baseball executives, including Chandler, agreed to settle Gardella's case for $60,000.|$|E
