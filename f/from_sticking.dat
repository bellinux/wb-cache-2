5|$|Meibomian glands, in the eyelids, secrete {{a form of}} sebum called meibum {{onto the}} eye, that slows the {{evaporation}} of tears. It also serves to create an airtight seal when the eyes are closed and its lipid quality also prevents the eyelids <b>from</b> <b>sticking</b> together. The meibomian glands are also known as tarsal glands, Zeis glands and palpebral glands. They attach directly to the follicles of the eyelashes, which are arranged vertically within the tarsal plates of the eyelids.|$|E
25|$|A {{lubricant}} is {{used when}} forging to reduce friction and wear. It {{is also used}} as a thermal barrier to restrict heat transfer from the workpiece to the die. Finally, the lubricant acts as a parting compound to prevent the part <b>from</b> <b>sticking</b> in the dies.|$|E
25|$|Used {{to process}} salt, salt pans were large, ovular, shallow clay pans that could hold from 10 to 26 liters. A heavy slip {{made them more}} waterproof. They were most likely formed from a mold, {{possibly}} a basket. They were lined with grass or textiles to keep <b>from</b> <b>sticking</b> to each other or the mold before firing.|$|E

25|$|Calcium {{carbonate}} {{is added}} {{to a wide range}} of trade and do it yourself adhesives, sealants, and decorating fillers. Ceramic tile adhesives typically contain 70 to 80% limestone. Decorating crack fillers contain similar levels of marble or dolomite. It is also mixed with putty in setting stained glass windows, and as a resist to prevent glass <b>from</b> <b>sticking</b> to kiln shelves when firing glazes and paints at high temperature.|$|E

25|$|Lint on {{clothing}} {{is generally considered}} unattractive and unprofessional. Furthermore, lint may be abrasive and may damage the clothing itself. For this reason, visible lint is often removed with a lint remover or clothes brush. The accumulation of lint during clothes cleaning can be reduced {{with the use of}} a fabric softener, which reduces the amount of static electricity on clothing surfaces and therefore prevents the lint <b>from</b> <b>sticking</b> to the clothes.|$|E
25|$|Magnesium {{chloride}} is used {{in three}} ways for pavement ice control: Anti-icing, when maintenance professionals spread it onto roads before a snow storm to prevent snow <b>from</b> <b>sticking</b> and ice from forming; pre-wetting, which means a liquid formulation of magnesium chloride is sprayed directly onto salt as it is being spread onto roadway pavement, wetting the salt so that it sticks to the road; and pre-treating, when magnesium chloride and salt are mixed together before they are loaded onto trucks and spread onto paved roads.|$|E
25|$|Short pasta pieces {{fall on the}} shaker {{conveyor}} and powerful hot air is blown to them immediately after the extrusion. This reduces the moisture content by 5% and prevents the pieces <b>from</b> <b>sticking</b> and flattening. Shaker then carries the product through tiers with dry hot air and buckets collect the pasta and spread them on the upper tier of the multi-tier drying unit. This unit has four areas which periods of intense moisture extraction alternately followed by periods of rest occur at eight drying/stabilizing cycle in total. Process ends in cold air chamber for stabilizing.|$|E

25|$|The {{storage of}} pasta {{depends on how}} far along it is processed. Uncooked pasta is kept dry and can sit in the {{cupboard}} for a year if airtight and stored in a cool, dry area. Cooked pasta is stored {{in the refrigerator for}} a maximum of five days in an airtight container. Adding a couple teaspoons of oil helps keep the food <b>from</b> <b>sticking</b> to itself and the container. If the cooked pasta is not used in the five days it may be frozen for up to two or three months. The pasta will start to dry after a period of time, but it varies with the type of pasta. Should the pasta be dried completely, it can be placed back in the cupboard.|$|E
25|$|Being inexpensively {{available}} and chemically benign, stearic acid finds many niche applications, for example, in making plaster castings from a plaster piece mold or waste mold and {{in making the}} mold from a shellacked clay original. In this use, powdered stearic acid is mixed in water and the suspension is brushed onto the surface to be parted after casting. This reacts with the calcium in the plaster to form {{a thin layer of}} calcium stearate, which functions as a release agent. When reacted with zinc it forms zinc stearate, which is used as a lubricant for playing cards (fanning powder) to ensure a smooth motion when fanning. In compressed confections, it is used as a lubricant to keep the tablet <b>from</b> <b>sticking</b> to the die.|$|E
25|$|PTFE film is also {{widely used}} in the {{production}} of carbon fiber composites as well as fiberglass composites, notably in the aerospace industry. PTFE film is used as a barrier between the carbon or fiberglass part being built, and breather and bagging materials used to incapsulate the bondment when debulking (vacuum removal of air from between layers of laid-up plies of material) and when curing the composite, usually in an autoclave. The PTFE, used here as a film, prevents the non-production materials <b>from</b> <b>sticking</b> to the part being built, which is sticky due to the carbon-graphite or fiberglass plies being pre-pregnated with bismaleimide resin. Non-production materials such as Teflon, Airweave Breather and the bag itself would be considered F.O.D. (foreign object debris/damage) if left in layup.|$|E

25|$|Even as America's westward {{expansion}} allowed over 400 {{million acres}} (1,600,000km²) of new land {{to be put}} under cultivation, between 1870 and 1910 the number of Americans involved in farming or farm labor dropped by a third. New farming techniques and agricultural mechanization facilitated both processes. Cyrus McCormick's reaper (invented in 1834) allowed farmers to quadruple their harvesting efficiency by replacing hand labor with a mechanical device. John Deere invented the steel plow in 1837, keeping the soil <b>from</b> <b>sticking</b> to the plow and {{making it easier to}} farm in the rich prairies of the Midwest. The harvester, self-binder, and combine allowed even greater efficiencies: wheat farmers in 1866 achieved an average yield of 9.9 bushels per acre but by 1898 yields had increased to 15.3 bushels per acre even as the total area had tripled.|$|E
500|$|Information {{about the}} Trinity test {{was made public}} shortly after the bombing of Hiroshima.

500|$|As DNA {{around the}} double-strand break is cut back, the {{single-stranded}} 3' overhangs being produced are coated with the RPA protein, which prevents the 3' overhangs <b>from</b> <b>sticking</b> to themselves. [...] A protein called Rad52 then binds {{each of the}} repeat sequences {{on either side of}} the break, and aligns them to enable the two complementary repeat sequences to anneal. [...] After annealing is complete, leftover non-homologous flaps of the 3' overhangs are cut away by a set of nucleases, known as Rad1/Rad10, which are brought to the flaps by the Saw1 and Slx4 proteins. [...] New DNA synthesis fills in any gaps, and ligation restores the DNA duplex as two continuous strands. [...] The DNA sequence between the repeats is always lost, as is one of the two repeats. [...] The SSA pathway is considered mutagenic since it results in such deletions of genetic material.|$|E
