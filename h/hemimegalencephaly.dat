40|$|Objective: The {{surgical}} {{techniques of}} functional hemispherectomy (fHSE) and peri-insular hemispherotomy (piHST), performed {{in patients with}} refractory severe hemispherical epilepsy, with hemiparesis and mental retardation, are compared. Represents the piHST a further positive development of the fHSE? Is it applicable to all pathological substrates {{and what are the}} clinical results? Material and method: In the Epilepsy-Centre Bethel 73 patients (66 children and 7 patients > 14 years of age) underwent fHSE or piHST in a period of 13 years (1990 - 2003). We analysed retrospectively all cases based on neurosurgical, neurological and anesthesiological registries. 44 patients presented with congenital developmental anomalies (25 <b>hemimegalencephalies,</b> 14 cortical dysplasias und 5 Sturge-Weber-Syndroms) and 29 with acquired diseases (14 encephaloclastic lesions, 12 Rasmussen-encephalitis). We divided the patients according to the surgical technique in group A (fHSE) and group B (piHST). The fHSE consisted of a big central region tissue resection, which was followed by temporal lobectomy, amygdalohippocampectomy, callosotomy and undercutting disconnection of frontal and occipital lobes. In the piHST we achieved the disconnection of the hemisphere from within the lateral ventricle through smaller craniotomies, shorter operating times and less blood loss. The epilepsy outcome is evaluated according to the Engel&# 65533;s classification. Results: 28 patients underwent fHSE and 45 patients piHST. We discovered that the piHST is a quicker, more precise and effective surgical technique. The rate of incomplete differentation is three times higher in group A than in group B. 7 % of cases needed a shunt implantation in both groups each. The mortality was 2, 7 % (2 / 28 of group A und 0 / 45 of group B). The results concerning the epilepsy-control show that 71, 8 % of patients were epilepsy-free or almost epilepsy-free (Engel I und II) and 18, 3 % of them with considerable improvement. Comparing the two surgical groups with respect to the epilepsy outcome the group B showed better results than the group A. Conclusions: The piHST is a further positive development of the fHSE. The piHST is applicable in all cases of the hemispherical epilepsies and leads to better surgical and clinical results. An early operation untill the age of three years should be the aim, {{to take advantage of the}} brain plasticity and to be of benefit for the development of the child...|$|R
25|$|Megalencephaly-capillary (MCAP) {{is one of}} the {{two major}} syndromes of megalencephaly. Typically, MCAP and MPPH can be {{distinguished}} by somatic features.

40|$|<b>Hemimegalencephaly</b> is a {{rare and}} severe {{congenital}} brain mal-formation involving enlargement of only one cerebral hemisphere. 1 Some patients show entire brain asymmetry, hemifacial hypertro-phy, or hemicorporal hypertrophy. <b>Hemimegalencephaly</b> {{is a type of}} hamartomatous lesion 2 or migration disorder, but its etiology remains unknown. Patients with the syndromic form of the disease have underlying disorders, most of which are neurocutaneous syndromes. Those with the isolated form of <b>hemimegalencephaly</b> have no such disorders. 1 The clinical triad of <b>hemimegalencephaly</b> comprises epilepsy, hemiparesis, and psychomotor retardation. Epilepsy is usually of early onset and intractable. Clinical symp-toms differ from patient to patient, probably owing to the degree of cerebral malformation. We surveyed Japanese patients with <b>hemimegalencephaly</b> and review the clinical aspects of this disorder to assess the degree of clinical severity. METHODS We surveyed patients with <b>hemimegalencephaly</b> in all hospitals in Japan with a pediatric ward by means of a questionnaire. 3 This survey was held on May 1999. <b>Hemimegalencephaly</b> was defined as having at least two lobes in the affected hemisphere larger than on the other side. Information on the patient’s sex, age, underlying disorders, epilepsy (age at onset, form of epilepsy, electroencephalographic [EEG] findings, seizure frequency, and treatment), intellectual level, motor function deficit, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings was reviewed. RESULTS The questionnaires were distributed to 1200 hospitals, and answers were obtained from 328 hospitals (27. 3 %). There were 38 patients with <b>hemimegalencephaly</b> from 32 hospitals.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In <b>hemimegalencephaly,</b> MR imaging often reveals midsagittal bandlike {{structures}} {{between the}} 2 lateral ventricles. To determine whether these structures are aberrant midsagittal fibers, we retrospectively reviewed them on conventional MR imaging and prospectively examined them by diffusion tensor MR and fiber tract (FT) reconstruction imaging. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed conventional MR images of 26 consecutive patients with <b>hemimegalencephaly</b> by 2 neuroradiologists, focusing on abnormal midsagittal struc-tures. The {{distance between the}} 2 anterior horns and widths of midsagittal bandlike structures were measured. Prospective analysis was performed in 7 consecutive patients with <b>hemimegalencephaly</b> examined for midsagittal aberrant fibers by diffusion tensor imaging, and cortical distribution areas of the fibers were observed. RESULTS: The distance between the 2 anterior horns was wide (4 mm) due to white matter– intensity structures in 20 of 26 patients (76. 9 %). Mid-sagittal bandlike structures were observed in 15 patients (57. 7 %). Asymmetry of the fornices was detected in 7 patients (26. 9 %), and both fornices were thickened in 7 (26. 9 %) patients.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Cerebrovascular {{changes are}} rarely {{discussed}} {{in patients with}} <b>hemimegalencephaly.</b> These alterations have previously been associated with epileptical activity. CASE: We report {{the case of a}} 36 -week gestation neonate presenting with total right <b>hemimegalencephaly,</b> as demonstrated by a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed in the first days of life. Perfusion-weighted imaging displayed a clear hypervascularization of the right hemisphere. Diffusion-tensor imaging showed an arrangement of white matter fibers concentrically around the ventricle on the right hemisphere. AngioMRI showed an obvious asymmetry {{in the size of the}} middle cerebral arteries, with the right middle cerebral artery being prominent. The baby was free of clinical seizures during his first week of life. An electroencephalogram at that time displayed an asymmetric background activity, but no electrical seizures.

However, very {{little is known about}} changes in structures outside the involved hemisphere in patients with this condition. We investigated morpho-logic abnormalities occurring outside the affected hemisphere by MR imaging in a large series of patients with <b>hemimegalencephaly.</b> MATERIALS AND METHODS: MR imaging findings for 30 patients with <b>hemimegalencephaly</b> were retrospectively reviewed and evaluated for structures outside the involved hemisphere on routine MR images, such as cranial nerves (I, II, V), brain vessels, subdural and subarachnoid spaces, brain stem, and cerebellum, on both the ipsilateral and contralateral sides. RESULTS: The ipsilateral olfactory and optic nerves were enlarged in 8 (26. 7 %) and 1 (3. 3 %) of the 30 patients, respectively, without enlargement on the contralateral side.

We found 57 previously reported cases with the hemimegalencephalic variant of epidermal nevus syndrome, in which the most frequent associated features are severe epilepsy, in about half of cases with neonatal onset, mental retardation/developmental delay, ocular/visual involvement, and facial abnormalities.
