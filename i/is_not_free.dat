25|$|Another {{issue that}} arises with non-finitely {{generated}} modules {{is that there}} are torsion-free modules which are not free. For instance, consider the ring Z of integers. Then Q is a torsion-free Z-module which <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>free.</b> Another classical example of such a module is the Baer–Specker group, the group of all sequences of integers under termwise addition. In general, the question of which infinitely generated torsion-free abelian groups are free depends on which large cardinals exist. A consequence is that any structure theorem for infinitely generated modules depends on a choice of set theory axioms and may be invalid under a different choice.|$|E
