5|$|Double {{burden is}} a term used to {{describe}} the workload of people who work to earn money, but who are also responsible for significant amounts of unpaid domestic labor. This phenomenon is also known as The Second Shift as in Arlie Hochschild's book of the same name. In heterosexual couples where both partners have paid jobs, women often spend significantly more time than men on <b>household</b> <b>chores</b> and caring work, such as childrearing or caring for sick family members. This outcome is determined in large part by traditional gender roles that have been accepted by society over time. Labor market constraints also play a role in determining who does the bulk of unpaid work.|$|E

5|$|Just as {{the image}} of the wife in {{advertising}} has reflected the general views of the appropriate roles of a wife, images of the husband also reflect the cultural values surrounding what role was believed a husband should be engaged in. For example, over time, it is common find images of the husband as performing work outside of the home and taking care of the family finances. It has been noted that this role has been especially prevalent during 1920, 1936, and 1970. On the other hand, one is not likely to find an advertisement depicting husbands engaged in <b>household</b> <b>chores,</b> except when they are depicted as particularly bad at performing the housework. In addition, it has been noted that over time, the portrayal of husbands and wives in an intimate, romantic relationship has been on the rise.|$|E

The family lived in the suburb of Cabra, and had very limited finances. Being one of the younger children he was indulged, and took advantage of his lack of <b>household</b> <b>chores</b> to spend the majority of his time playing football in the street. However he was arrested by a plain-clothed policeman and sentenced to probation in Children's Court for playing football in the street. He later credited his ball control skills to the many years he spent playing football with large numbers of other children in the tight streets of Cabra. His father and brothers were in the printing trade, and his brother Ollie, a talented footballer, rejected the opportunity to turn professional at Wolverhampton Wanderers in 1950 in order to remain employed in Dublin as a machine minder and play football part-time in the League of Ireland. Three more of his brothers also played in the League of Ireland, and both Ollie and Michael played in the Shelbourne team that won the FAI Cup in 1960.|$|E

50|$|He {{was born}} at Albany, New York, and after {{receiving}} a common school education, learned the trade of a carpenter. He removed to Danbury, Conn., in 1860, and worked at his trade for the two following years, but found time to write occasionally for the newspapers. During the Civil War {{he served in the}} Seventeenth Connecticut Volunteers. In 1870 he established the Danbury News, for which he wrote the humorous sketches, sometimes original, often simply descriptive of commonplace happenings, which won for him a national reputation and made his paper known throughout the country.

She spent over $500,000 on the construction and decoration of the school, and she supervised much of the construction processes. Although she was greatly hailed for her work, her donations were also controversial {{at the time and}} sometimes criticized for breaking social norms. Women at the time were expected and restricted to be good housekeepers, mothers and wives. Thus, the great amount of money invested to raise the standard of women's education seemed like a waste, since women would eventually stay at home and do <b>household</b> <b>chore.</b> For instance, [...] "The Kitchen Magazine asked, 'Why does not Miss Garrett or some other philanthropist invest {{a quarter of a million}} dollars in a model school of domestic economy, in which we prepare girls for housekeeping and homemaking,' adding that 'without thoroughly trained, competent housekeepers it is a folly to hope for well-trained, pleasant homes.'" ...|$|R

40|$|Background About 2 % of {{children}} aged 0 - 15 years {{have at least}} one parent diagnosed in a psychiatric facility with any mental illness. Three common mental illnesses are schizophrenia, depression and bipolar disorder. Schizophrenia is a common form of psychosis, depression affects human behavior, thoughts and emotional life and bipolar disorder involves symptoms such as depression and mania.   Aim The aim of this literature study is to describe children's experiences of living with parent with a mental illness. The study also described the included articles data collection methods.   Method This study is a descriptive literature study and the scientific articles were searched in the Cinahl and PsycInfo databases.   Main results The result of the articles showed that the children felt different fears by living with the parent who has a mental illness. The fear was that the parent could commit suicide, if the illness was hereditary and that the mood was unstable. The children also felt ashamed of the parent so they found different ways that made them feel more “normal”. An adult responsibility was something the children occupied at an early age by taking care of <b>households</b> <b>chores,</b> their siblings and their sick parent. One wish that the children had was that they wanted more support from the environment, for example, adults from the health care.   Conclusion Feelings such as fear, shame and heavy responsibility is common in children of parent with mental illness. Also lack of support and information about the parents illness is experienced by the children and it is therefore important in the nurses work to be able to support these children and accommodate their needs. ...|$|R
25|$|Traditionally, {{rural and}} tribal women {{do all the}} <b>household</b> related <b>chores.</b> Heavy works that require more {{strength}} {{is done by the}} husband. Now, the chore work is evenly distributed with the men doing just as much work as the women. The scope of their functions include cooking, cleaning, teaching the children, washing clothes, repairs, budgeting, and helping in the farm. The husband is the one who makes sure the farm would yield quality crops, so he does all the maintenance work. In some cases, where the husband needs help from other men, the wife would make sure that the men are fed, so she cooks food and bring it to the farm. The Filipino women, ensures that everyone is well fed, including any workers, relatives, or visitors.|$|R
50|$|There {{has always}} been some type of {{differences}} between siblings, especially different sex siblings. Often, different sex sibling may consider things to be unfair because his/her brother/sister is allowed {{to do certain things}} just because of his or her gender, while he or she gets to do something less amusing or just plain different. McHale and her colleague conducted a longitudinal study using middle age children and observed {{the way in which the}} parents contributed to stereotypical attitudes in their kids. In their study the experimenters analysed two different types of families, one with the same sex siblings, and the other with different sex siblings, as well as the children’s birth order. The experiment was conducted over phone interviews, in where the experimenters would ask the children about the activities they performed throughout their day outside of school. Surprisingly, the experimenters found that in the homes where there were mixed gender kids, and the father held traditional values, the kids also held traditional values and therefore also played gender based roles in the home. In contrast in homes where the father did not hold traditional values the house chores were divided more equally among his kids. However, if fathers had two male children, the younger male tended to help more with <b>household</b> <b>chore,</b> but as he reached his teenage years the younger child stopped being as helpful around the house. There are two important factors that need to be taken into account from this study. First, in cases where the father figure had more traditional values it was found that he also had less education than the other dads who participated in the study, and secondly the mother’s attitudes did not have a noticeable impact on her children’s gender role values. Altogether this experiment is a good example of the way in which environment and kinship help develop certain perspectives on gender role association in children.|$|R
