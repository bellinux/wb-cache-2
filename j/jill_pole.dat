25|$|The {{timeline}} includes {{information concerning}} the birth of several human characters, including Digory Kirke in 1888, Polly Plummer in 1889, Peter Pevensie in 1927, Susan, Edmund and Lucy (1928, 1930, 1932 respectively), Eustace Scrubb and <b>Jill</b> <b>Pole</b> (both born in 1933).|$|E
25|$|Eustace Clarence Scrubb is {{a cousin}} of the Pevensies, and a classmate of <b>Jill</b> <b>Pole</b> at their school Experiment House. He is portrayed at first as a brat and a bully, but comes to improve his nasty {{behaviour}} when his greed turns him into a dragon for a while. His distress at having to live as a dragon causes him to reflect upon how horrible he has been, and he soon becomes a better person so Aslan changes him back into a boy. In the later books, Eustace {{comes across as a}} much nicer person, although he is still rather grumpy and argumentative. Nonetheless, he becomes a hero along with <b>Jill</b> <b>Pole</b> when the pair succeed in freeing the lost Prince Rilian from the clutches of an evil witch. He appears in The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, The Silver Chair, and The Last Battle.|$|E
25|$|In The Last Battle, Jewel the Unicorn {{discusses}} Narnian {{history with}} <b>Jill</b> <b>Pole,</b> explaining {{that while she}} (and the readers) imagine it to have been excessively turbulent ("It's a pity there's always so much happening in Narnia"), that is only because humans {{have been sent to}} aid Narnia at its worst times. At other times there were long periods of peace and prosperity.|$|E
5000|$|In The Last Battle, Susan is {{conspicuous}} by her absence. Peter {{says that}} she is [...] "no longer a friend of Narnia", and (in <b>Jill</b> <b>Pole's</b> words) [...] "she's interested in nothing now-a-days except nylons and lipstick and invitations." [...] Similarly, Eustace Scrubb quotes her as saying, [...] "What wonderful memories you have! Fancy you still thinking about all those funny games {{we used to play}} when we were children," [...] and Polly Plummer adds, [...] "She wasted all her school time wanting to be the age she is now, and she'll waste all {{the rest of her life}} trying to stay that age. Her whole idea is to race on to the silliest time of one's life as quick as she can and then stop there as long as she can." [...] Thus, Susan does not enter the real Narnia with the others at the end of the series. It is left ambiguous whether Susan's absence is permanent, especially since Lewis stated elsewhere that: The books don't tell us what happened to Susan. She is left alive in this world at the end, having by then turned into a rather silly, conceited young woman. But there's plenty of time for her to mend and perhaps she will get to Aslan's country in the end... in her own way.|$|R
25|$|Eustace {{was drawn}} back to Narnia in the Narnian year 2356 {{along with a}} school friend, <b>Jill</b> <b>Pole,</b> {{to find that the}} passage of time had left Caspian an old man. Caspian's son Rilian had disappeared, and as Caspian {{embarked}} on a final voyage to seek Aslan's advice about the succession, the children and Puddleglum the Marsh-wiggle began their own search for Rilian.|$|E
25|$|In The Silver Chair, in Narnian year 2356, Aslan brought Eustace Scrubb and <b>Jill</b> <b>Pole</b> to Narnia, {{where they}} rescued Rilian, {{son of the}} now elderly Caspian, from his enchanted captivity. Caspian died, but was resurrected in Aslan's country. Aslan briefly allowed him to cross over into the children's world (England, AD 1942) to help them in return, which {{resulted}} in the removal of a corrupt school administrator.|$|E
25|$|Completed at the {{beginning}} of March 1951 and published 7 September 1953, The Silver Chair is the first Narnia book without any of the Pevensie children. Instead, Aslan calls Eustace back to Narnia together with his classmate <b>Jill</b> <b>Pole.</b> There they are given four signs to aid them in the search for Prince Rilian, Caspian's son, who disappeared after setting out ten years earlier to avenge his mother's death. Fifty years have passed in Narnia and Caspian, who was barely an adult in The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, is now an old man, while Eustace is still a child.|$|E
25|$|Others {{from our}} world include King Frank, {{formerly}} a cabman in London, {{and his wife}} Queen Helen, who were the first King and Queen of Narnia and whose descendants lived in Narnia for many generations. They, together with Andrew Ketterley, Digory Kirke, and Polly Plummer appear in The Magician's Nephew. Eustace Scrubb, a cousin of the Pevensies, appears in The Voyage of the Dawn Treader and The Silver Chair, and <b>Jill</b> <b>Pole,</b> a schoolmate of Scrubb's, also appears in The Silver Chair. All of these except Susan Pevensie and Andrew Ketterley appear in The Last Battle.|$|E
25|$|<b>Jill</b> <b>Pole</b> is {{not related}} to any of the other {{children}} who enter Narnia. She is a classmate and neighbour of Eustace Scrubb. She appears in The Silver Chair, where she is the viewpoint character for most of the action, and returns in The Last Battle. In The Silver Chair Eustace introduces her to the Narnian world, where Aslan gives her the task of memorising a series of signs that will help her and Eustace on their quest to find Caspian's lost son. In The Last Battle she and Eustace accompany King Tirian in his ill-fated defence of Narnia against the Calormenes.|$|E
2500|$|Underland [...] lying {{beneath the}} land of Narnia, Underland appears mainly in The Silver Chair, where Eustace Scrubb and <b>Jill</b> <b>Pole</b> travel under the ground to reach it {{in their search for}} Prince Rilian. They find him in Underland and release him from his enchantment by The Lady of the Green Kirtle.|$|E
2500|$|Lady of the Green Kirtle [...] {{queen of}} the Underland, a {{powerful}} sorceress who kidnapped and enslaved Prince Rilian of Narnia and a horde of gnomes by her witchcraft, and planned to use them in a plot to take over Narnia. She is foiled by three friends of Aslan: Eustace Scrubb, <b>Jill</b> <b>Pole,</b> and Puddleglum.|$|E
2500|$|The Silver Chair [...] set {{primarily}} {{in the world of}} Narnia, decades after The Voyage of the Dawn Treader there but {{less than a year later}} in England. King Caspian X is now an old man but his son and only heir Prince Rilian is missing. Aslan the lion sends two children from England to Narnia on a mission to resolve the mystery: Eustace Scrubb, and <b>Jill</b> <b>Pole.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Harfang: Harfang is {{the great}} city of the far {{northern}} giants (the civilized ones). Although, of course, they're not quite so civil to everyone. They have a large castle and a king and queen and enjoy going out to hunt. They hunt and eat Talking Animals, a usage considered extremely barbarous {{by the standards of}} Narnia, tantamount to murder and cannibalism. They also enjoy feasts, for the which one of their chief delicacies is human flesh, cooked in a variety of ways. Eustace Scrubb, <b>Jill</b> <b>Pole,</b> and Puddleglum arrive at the castle on the recommendation of the Lady of the Green Kirtle in time for the Autumn Feast, unaware that they are to be the feast. [...] In origin, the word Harfang means the male of the snowy owl. (SC) ...|$|E
2500|$|Lewis {{supporters}} also {{cite the}} positive roles {{of women in}} the series, including <b>Jill</b> <b>Pole</b> in The Silver Chair, Aravis Tarkheena in The Horse and His Boy, Polly Plummer in The Magician's Nephew, and particularly Lucy Pevensie in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. Alan Jacobs, an English professor at Wheaton College, asserts that Lucy is the most admirable of the human characters and that generally the girls come off better than the boys throughout the series (Jacobs, 2008: 259). In her contribution to The Chronicles of Narnia and Philosophy, Karin Fry, an Assistant Professor of Philosophy at the University of Wisconsin, Stevens Point, notes that [...] "the most sympathetic female characters in The Chronicles are consistently the ones who question the traditional roles of women and prove their worth to Aslan through actively engaging in the adventures just like the boys." [...] Fry goes on to say: ...|$|E
2500|$|Lewis's {{early life}} has {{parallels}} with The Chronicles of Narnia. At {{the age of}} seven, he moved {{with his family to}} a large house on the edge of Belfast. Its long hallways and empty rooms inspired Lewis and his brother to invent make-believe worlds whilst exploring their home, an activity reflected in Lucy's discovery of Narnia in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. [...] Like Caspian and Rilian, Lewis lost his mother at an early age, spending much of his youth in English boarding schools similar to those attended by the Pevensie children, Eustace Scrubb, and <b>Jill</b> <b>Pole.</b> During World War II many children were evacuated from London and other urban areas because of German air raids. Some of these children, including one named Lucy (Lewis's goddaughter) stayed with him at his home The Kilns near Oxford, just as the Pevensies stayed with The Professor in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.|$|E
2500|$|In The Silver Chair, 1,356 {{years after}} her death, Jadis is {{called one of the}} [...] "Northern Witches", along with the Lady of the Green Kirtle - a new enemy to the good animals and humans who now inhabit Narnia. Glimfeather the Owl speculates that the Green Lady may be [...] "of the same crew" [...] as the White Witch. This has led to {{speculation}} by some readers that Jadis and the Lady of the Green Kirtle may be the same person. Lewis's text does not support this (See Lady of the Green Kirtle for further discussion). Lewis never clarifies the Green Lady's origins, or what connection she has to the White Witch. The [...] "Green Lady" [...] had first entered Narnia in serpent form and killed the wife of King Caspian, and later re-emerged in human firm to lure away Caspian's son Rilian and place him under an enchantment in the underworld, only for Eustace Scrubb and <b>Jill</b> <b>Pole</b> to reach the underworld with their guide, Puddleglum the marshwiggle, and rescue Rilian - who kills the Green Lady before they make their return to Narnia.|$|E
2500|$|Experiment House: It is the unorthodox school {{attended}} by <b>Jill</b> <b>Pole</b> and Eustace Scrubb in The Silver Chair. Created {{by the author}} to express his disdain with modern educational methods, it is co-educational where children are allowed to do as they please and can feel free to bully other children. It {{is run by a}} female Head who devotes her attention more to bullies, whom she sees as interesting psychological cases who she does not punish, than well-behaved children. Students at Experiment House do not receive a religious education, and Lewis briefly and disdainfully notes the school's absence of corporal punishment during The Voyage of the Dawn Treader. In Narnia, Jill and Eustace do not know what Aslan means by Son of Adam or Daughter of Eve because they have never heard of Adam or Eve. [...] At the end of The Silver Chair, Eustace, Jill, Caspian and Aslan himself team up together to defeat the bullies and set things right. Thanks to their actions, the bullies' rule is overthrown {{as well as that of}} the incompetent Head and the school becomes a much better place (the former Head becomes, however, a Member of the British Parliament). (SC) Experiment House satirizes progressive educational institutions such as Summerhill School.|$|E
