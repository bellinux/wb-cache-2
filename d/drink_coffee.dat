None of the employees care to join him, much to the disappointment of Michael, who plays music through the ventilation system to try tempting them to come.|$|E
5|$|The {{cause of}} Parkinson's disease is {{generally}} unknown, but believed to involve both genetic and environmental factors. Those {{with a family}} member affected {{are more likely to}} get the disease themselves. There is also an increased risk in people exposed to certain pesticides and among those who have had prior head injuries, while there is a reduced risk in tobacco smokers and those who <b>drink</b> <b>coffee</b> or tea. The motor symptoms of the disease result from the death of cells in the substantia nigra, a region of the midbrain. This results in not enough dopamine in these areas. The reason for this cell death is poorly understood, but involves the build-up of proteins into Lewy bodies in the neurons. Diagnosis of typical cases is mainly based on symptoms, with tests such as neuroimaging being used to rule out other diseases.|$|E

25|$|From {{his early}} years, Shoghi Effendi was {{introduced}} to the suffering which accompanied the Bahá'ís in Akká, including the attacks by Mírzá Muhammad `Alí against `Abdu'l-Bahá. As a young boy, he was aware of the desire of Sultán `Abdu'l-Hamíd (reigned 1876-1909) to banish `Abdu'l-Bahá to the deserts of North Africa where he was expected to perish. At one point, Shoghi Effendi was warned not to <b>drink</b> <b>coffee</b> in the homes of any of the Bahá'ís in the fear that he would be poisoned.|$|E
25|$|Marketeers {{primarily}} classify manga {{by the age}} {{and gender}} of the target readership. In particular, books and magazines sold to boys (shōnen) and girls (shōjo) have distinctive cover-art, and most bookstores place them on different shelves. Due to cross-readership, consumer response is not limited by demographics. For example, male readers may subscribe to a series intended for female readers, and so on. Japan has manga cafés, or manga kissa (kissa is an abbreviation of kissaten). At a manga kissa, people <b>drink</b> <b>coffee,</b> read manga and sometimes stay overnight.|$|E

Roemer {{wrote that}} he would go to DeStefano's house to {{question}} him about mob business and on a few occasions, DeStefano would walk down the stairs in his pajamas, exposing himself. Often DeStefano's wife would serve the agents coffee and the agents would comment that the coffee had a unique taste to it. Sam would claim the coffee was made from special Italian coffee beans that his wife brewed. Months later Roemer found out that DeStefano had been urinating in the coffee before it was served to the agents. Roemer wrote he could never <b>drink</b> <b>coffee</b> again in his life.|$|E

500|$|Southdale Center was {{developed}} by the Dayton Company and designed by Victor Gruen, an Austrian immigrant and socialist. Gruen was a European-style socialist; he found individual stores in downtown venues to be inefficient, and the suburban lifestyle of 1950s America too [...] "car-centric" [...] and wanted to design a building that would be a communal gathering place, where people would shop, <b>drink</b> <b>coffee,</b> and socialize, as he remembered from his native Vienna. Southdale Center was loosely modeled on the arcades of several heavily populated European cities and purposely included [...] "eye-level display cases" [...] to [...] "lure customers into stores". Gruen imaged that Southdale would eventually include [...] "a medical center, schools and residences, not just a parade of glitzy stores." [...] The first plans unveiled for the shopping center were announced in 1952 by Gruen and Minnesota native, Donald Dayton.|$|E

500|$|The {{character}} Grossberg's {{design was}} changed for Trials and Tribulations, with his brown suit {{changed to a}} red one: this was because the Game Boy Advance system's screen made his previous design blend in too much with the brown courtroom. Iwamoto based the design of Godot on Rutger Hauer's role in Blade Runner. He was originally going to be depicted as drinking bourbon whiskey and smoking, {{as part of his}} [...] "hard-boiled" [...] image; when the development team realized that this could have a bad influence on children, they made him <b>drink</b> <b>coffee</b> instead. As Takumi and Hideki Kamiya had joined Capcom around the same time and had desks near each other, Kamiya had asked Takumi for a voice role ever since the development of Justice for All; eventually, Takumi gave him the role of Godot. Takumi explained the role as a hard-boiled guy, so Kamiya decided to adapt the dialogue and shout [...] "Objection, baby!". Takumi said {{that it was a good}} take, but that the in-game graphics just say [...] "Objection!", so it could not be used.|$|E
500|$|Cox was 30 {{years old}} at the time she was cast, making her the show's second oldest main cast member, and was 39 by the {{beginning}} of Friends final season. Additionally, this distinction makes Cox older than her on-screen brother, actor David Schwimmer, who portrays her older brother Ross, who is one year her senior. The actress would deliver Monica's lines emphatically. Although each character is depicted as an avid coffee drinker, spending much of their free time in a coffee house, Cox herself does not <b>drink</b> <b>coffee,</b> and was only pretending to drink it out of mugs on the show. Kauffman believes that Cox's own cleanliness closely resembles her character's; at times the actress would clean her co-stars' dressing rooms. Cox also shares the character's motherly nature. The actress enjoyed portraying Monica she was able to [...] "bring more of my own personality to her, and I've never really been able to do that before." [...] Starpulse.com observed that [...] "As Monica, Cox never quite enjoyed the sort of watercooler storylines that co-star ... Jennifer Aniston had with David Schwimmer as the on-again, off-again Rachel and Ross." [...] At one point, Cox had begun to regret her decision to accept the role of Monica over Rachel due to the character's lack of strong storylines; she eventually relented once Monica and Chandler became romantically involved, thus her character's storylines gradually began to improve.|$|E

2500|$|Additionally, {{owing to}} its colonial history, cuisine in Eritrea {{features}} more Italian influences than {{are present in}} Ethiopian cooking, including more pasta and greater use of curry powders and cumin.The Italian Eritrean cuisine started to be practiced during the colonial times of the Kingdom of Italy, when {{a large number of}} Italians moved to Eritrea. They brought the use of [...] "pasta" [...] to Italian Eritrea, and {{it is one of the}} main food eaten in present-day Asmara. An Italian Eritrean cuisine emerged, and dishes common dishes are 'Pasta al Sugo e Berbere', which means [...] "Pasta with tomato sauce and berbere" [...] (spice), but there are many more like [...] "lasagna" [...] and [...] "cotoletta alla milanese" [...] (milano cutlet).

In addition to Yamaguchi, the room depicts a [...] "warped world" [...] of the past, where various items are shown in short reversed animation loops, such as clocks, a coat and an inkwell spilling onto paper where Yamaguchi had written the song's lyrics. In the final scenes, Yamaguchi is joined by {{the other members of}} Sakanaction, who sit at the table and <b>drink</b> <b>coffee</b> in a repeating loop. The final part of the movie shows Yamaguchi exiting the room, once again in color.|$|E
2500|$|Many of the {{original}} Saints Row developers continued onto the sequel's team. Thus, the team worked from their lessons learned rather than starting anew. The two games were consequently similar in design. They overhauled the game engine to enhance the sequel's graphics, and added contrast and higher-quality textures to make the city setting of Stilwater more realistic. Visual enhancements were also applied to people, cars, explosions, lighting, shadows, and the weather system. A central design goal was to [...] "create a world that exists independent of the player" [...] that featured more realistic non-player characters (NPCs) that would smoke cigarettes, use cellphones, <b>drink</b> <b>coffee,</b> open umbrellas when it rained, and physically interact. The original game's engine could not support close proximity NPC interaction like sitting together or cuddling. As the city design finalized late in development, the team laboriously hand-placed 20,000 nodes throughout the game world that trigger NPC actions.|$|E

2500|$|He {{continued}} to publish at an impressive rate: in 1906, he again handed down for print four separate volumes. In parallel, Sadoveanu pursued {{his career as}} a civil servant. In 1905, he was employed as a clerk by the Ministry of Education, headed by the Conservative Party's Mihail Vlădescu. His direct supervisor was poet D. Nanu, and he had for his colleagues the geographer George Vâlsan and the short story writer Nicolae N. Beldiceanu. Nanu wrote of this period: [...] "It is a clerical packed full with men of letters, no work is being done, people smoke, <b>drink</b> <b>coffee,</b> create dreams, poems and prose [...]" [...] Having interrupted his administrative service, Sadoveanu was again drafted into the Land Forces in 1906, being granted an officer's rank. An already overweight man, he had to march from Probota in Central Moldavia to Bukovina, which caused him intense suffering.|$|E
2500|$|Boss Jefferson Davis [...] "J.D." [...] Hogg (Sorrell Booke) is {{the wealthiest}} man in Hazzard County and owns {{most of its}} {{property}} and businesses — whether directly or by holding the mortgages over the land. Usually dressed in an all-white suit, he is the fat, greedy, corrupt County Commissioner with visions of grandeur, a voracious appetite for food, who constantly orders Rosco to [...] "Get them Duke Boys!" [...] He is also Bo and Luke's Probation officer, when Bo and Luke need to leave Hazzard they always get permission from him. Boss Hogg is also married to (and dominated by) Rosco's [...] "fat sister" [...] (Lulu Hogg), a point that does not always sit well with either Boss Hogg or Rosco; Hogg sometimes claims that Rosco is indebted to him because of it, though his on-screen interactions with Lulu typically show him loving her deeply (and giving in to her stronger personality). In addition to his role as county commissioner {{he is also the}} police commissioner, land commissioner, and bank president. Boss is also the chief of the Hazzard Fire Department and the owner of or primary mortgage holder on most of the places in the county, including the Boar's Nest, Rhubottem's Store, Cooter's garage and the Duke Farm. It is implied in some episodes that he is the Justice of the Peace but in others Hazzard relies on a circuit judge. In the episode [...] "Coltrane vs. Duke", Hogg represents Rosco when he sues the Dukes, implying that he is a licensed attorney. His vehicle is a white 1970 Cadillac Coupe de Ville convertible, with bull horns mounted on the hood. In the first few seasons, he is almost always driven around by a chauffeur. His old moonshine-running car was called the [...] "Grey Ghost". Every morning, Boss Hogg would <b>drink</b> <b>coffee</b> and eat raw liver (Sorrell Booke, a method actor, actually ate the raw liver). Boss Hogg is described in one analysis as [...] "an ineffectual bad guy--hence amusing".|$|E
