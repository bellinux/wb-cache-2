2500|$|The wafer is {{manufactured}} {{from many}} thousands of individual <b>hollow</b> <b>glass</b> fibers, aligned at a [...] "bias" [...] angle to the axis of the tube. The micro-channel plate fits between the photocathode and screen. Electrons that strike {{the side of the}} [...] "micro-channel" [...] as they pass through it elicit secondary electrons, which in turn elicit additional electrons as they too strike the walls, amplifying the signal. By using the MCP with a proximity focused tube, amplifications of up to 30,000 times with a single MCP layer were possible. By increasing the number of layers of MCP, additional amplification to well over 1,000,000 times could be achieved.|$|E
2500|$|With inside vapor deposition, the preform {{starts as}} a <b>hollow</b> <b>glass</b> tube {{approximately}} [...] long, which is placed horizontally and rotated slowly on a lathe. Gases such as silicon tetrachloride (SiCl4) or germanium tetrachloride (GeCl4) are injected with {{oxygen in the}} end of the tube. The gases are then heated by means of an external hydrogen burner, bringing the temperature of the gas up to 1,900K (1,600°C, 3,000°F), where the tetrachlorides react with oxygen to produce silica or germania (germanium dioxide) particles. When the reaction conditions are chosen to allow this reaction to occur in the gas phase throughout the tube volume, in contrast to earlier techniques where the reaction occurred only on the glass surface, this technique is called modified chemical vapor deposition (MCVD).|$|E

40|$|The {{effective}} activation {{and utilization}} of metakaolin as an alkali activated geopolymer precursor {{and its use}} in concrete surface protection is of great interest. In this paper, the formula of alkali activated metakaolin-based geopolymers was studied using an orthogonal experimental design. It {{was found that the}} optimal geopolymer was prepared with metakaolin, sodium hydroxide, sodium silicate and water, with the molar ratio of SiO 2 :Al 2 O 3 :Na 2 O:NaOH:H 2 O being 3. 4 : 1. 1 : 0. 5 : 1. 0 : 11. 8. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) were adopted to investigate the influence of curing conditions on the mechanical properties and microstructures of the geopolymers. The best curing condition was 60 °C for 168 h, and this alkali activated metakaolin-based geopolymer showed the highest compression strength at 52. 26 MPa. In addition, <b>hollow</b> micro-sphere <b>glass</b> beads were mixed with metakaolin particles to improve the thermal insulation properties of the alkali activated metakaolin-based geopolymer. These results suggest that a suitable volume ratio of metakaolin to <b>hollow</b> micro-sphere <b>glass</b> beads in alkali activated metakaolin-based geopolymers was 6 : 1, which achieved a thermal conductivity of 0. 37 W/mK and compressive strength of 50 MPa.

The inside of the two sheets would be filled with wax or another liquid to preserve the metal work.

Polycapillary collimating optics collect x-rays over a wide solid angle (as large as lo- 15 degrees cone angle) and a large energy bandwidth and provide a quasi-parallel beam with a small divergence (a few milliradians). Parallel beam geometry and uniform local divergence give symmetric uniform peak shapes. This combined with the diffracted beam intensity gain allows accurate analysis of thin complex multilayer diffraction peaks. Experimental results are compared to Monte-Carlo geometrical optics simulations to study performance characterization of polycapillary collimating optics.
