5|$|A city {{councilor}} {{from each}} of the city's nine council districts is elected every two years, each serving a term of two years. Councilors are elected from their own respective districts based on a plurality voting system, and serve on the Tulsa City Council. As a whole, the council acts as the legislative body of city government, which aims to pass laws, approve the city budget, and manage efficiency <b>in</b> <b>city</b> government. In accordance with the mayor-council form of government, the Tulsa City Council and the office of the Mayor coordinate <b>in</b> <b>city</b> government operations. A third body of the government, the city auditor, is elected independently of the city council and mayor to ensure that the auditor can act in an objective manner. The auditor is elected for a term of two years. Phil Wood, a Democrat, held the position for 21 years before being defeated by Republican Preston Doerflinger in the 2009 election. The city serves as the seat of county government for Tulsa County, and lies mostly within Oklahoma's 1st congressional district, with its far northwestern areas in southern Osage County in Oklahoma's 3rd congressional district. Municipal and State laws are enforced in Tulsa by the Tulsa Police Department, an organization of 781 officers as of 2012.|$|E
5|$|After decades, the Oneida became {{frustrated}} {{by the failure of}} the case to settle.

Oneida Indian Nation of New York (2005), the Supreme Court held that laches barred the re-assertion of sovereignty over ancestral land re-acquired in fee simple; the Court did not consider whether the original aboriginal title over the disputed parcels was validly extinguished, and thus did not disturb its holding in Oneida II.|$|E

5|$|At {{some point}} {{following}} {{the fall of}} the Western Roman Empire, a retrenchment was built within the city, reducing it to its present size.
