Caps earned during the players whole career are included, not <b>just</b> <b>those</b> won while contracted to Plymouth Argyle.|$|E

Rather than doing the challenges to unlock avatars/content, all one must do is complete the gig by successfully completing all songs. Not all gigs have content to unlock, rather <b>just</b> <b>those</b> to which a particular unlockable applies (for example the Johnny Cash gig allows Johnny Cash to be unlocked as a playable avatar).|$|E
5|$|The Yankees {{were just}} 1½ games behind the Toronto Blue Jays when they {{acquired}} Lee Smith, and he pitched nearly perfectly {{for the last}} month of the season. In eight games, Smith did not allow a single run and picked up three saves and 11 strikeouts. The Yankees as a team, however, did poorly during {{the remainder of the}} season, and Toronto easily pulled away to win the division. Smith's New York career lasted <b>just</b> <b>those</b> eight games as he filed for free agency after the season. He signed with Baltimore for 1994 for $1.5 million plus incentives.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} year the college was officially integrated as A welcomed its first African American student. More change ensued, as, in 1965, the Board of Directors voted to make {{membership in the}} Corps of Cadets voluntary. The same year the Board voted to allow any woman, not <b>just</b> <b>those</b> connected to students and professors, to attend the university. The Board required that Rudder approve each female applicant; he accepted any woman who met the academic requirements. During Rudder's tenure, African-American students were also welcomed, and in 1967, James L. Courtney of Dallas became the first African American to receive an undergraduate degree from Texas A University. He remained at Texas A and, in 1970, became the first African American to receive a D.V.M. degree from the College of Veterinary Medicine.|$|E

25|$|Given any {{complete}} axiomatization of Boolean algebra, {{such as the}} axioms for a complemented distributive lattice, {{a sufficient}} condition for an algebraic structure of this kind to satisfy all the Boolean laws is that it satisfy <b>just</b> <b>those</b> axioms.

25|$|By September 1890, federal {{officials}} {{were preparing to}} seize the church’s four temples and the U.S. Congress had debated whether to extend the 1882 Edmunds Act so that all Mormons would be disenfranchised, not <b>just</b> <b>those</b> practicing plural marriage. The Supreme Court had already ruled in Davis v. Beason that a law in Idaho Territory which disenfranchised individuals who practiced or believed in plural marriage was constitutional.|$|E
25|$|After {{trade union}} mergers, Moyle became National Officer of the National Union of Public Employees, {{which made him}} {{responsible}} for local authority workers generally and not <b>just</b> <b>those</b> in construction. In the year 1937–38 Moyle was Chairman of the National Joint Council for Local Authorities Non-Trading Services. He was a spokesman of a delegation to the government to ask for pensions for manual workers {{as well as local}} government officers in 1937.|$|E

Automobile dependency is a name given by policy makers to places where those without access to a private vehicle {{do not have access to}} independent mobility.|$|E
25|$|In a {{class of}} algebras defined as all the models {{of a set of}} {{equations}}, it is usually the case that some algebras of the class satisfy more equations than <b>just</b> <b>those</b> needed to qualify them for the class. The class of Boolean algebras is unusual in that, with a single exception, every Boolean algebra satisfies exactly the Boolean identities and no more. The exception is the one-element Boolean algebra, which necessarily satisfies every equation, even x= y, and is therefore sometimes referred to as the inconsistent Boolean algebra.|$|E
25|$|LGBT sex {{education}} includes {{the teachings of}} safe sex practices for people of all gender and sexual orientation identities, not <b>just</b> <b>those</b> participating in heterosexual sexual activities. Studies have shown that many schools do not offer such educational tracks today, possibly due to a controversy {{in the field of}} {{sex education}} regarding whether or not LGBT education should be integrated into course curriculum. The lack of information distributed regarding mentally and physcially healthy LGBT relationships can also be attributed to the ongoing stigma surrounding queerness in the US, especially as related to adolescents.|$|E

25|$|The World Health Organization (WHO) {{recommends}} {{routine vaccination}} only if a country can keep more than 80% of people vaccinated. If only 20% to 80% {{of people are}} vaccinated {{it is possible that}} more people will get the disease at an older age and outcomes overall may worsen. Either one or two doses of the vaccine is recommended. In the United States two doses are recommended starting at twelve to fifteen months of age. As of 2012 most European countries either recommend it for all children or <b>just</b> <b>those</b> at high risk, but not all countries provide the vaccine due to its cost.|$|E
25|$|There is a {{great variety}} of such proofs of the Cayley–Hamilton theorem, of which several will be given here. They vary in the amount of {{abstract}} algebraic notions required to understand the proof. The simplest proofs use <b>just</b> <b>those</b> notions needed to formulate the theorem (matrices, polynomials with numeric entries, determinants), but involve technical computations that render somewhat mysterious the fact that they lead precisely to the correct conclusion. It is possible to avoid such details, but at the price of involving more subtle algebraic notions: polynomials with coefficients in a non-commutative ring, or matrices with unusual kinds of entries.|$|E
25|$|The Little 500 is {{much more}} than just the race. There are also several series events {{associated}} with the race. These events are held for a few reasons. The first and foremost is for fun. The second reason is so that teams can scout out the competition and get a feel for that year's race field. And the final reason is so that all the members of a team, not <b>just</b> <b>those</b> competing in the actual race itself, can still participate and compete. There are four other series events outside of the race: Qualifications, ITTs, Miss-N-Out, and Team Pursuit.|$|E
