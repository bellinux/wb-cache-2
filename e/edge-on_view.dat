Thus {{the presence of a}} bar is not a sine qua non condition for the appearance of this feature, as often assumed. We show that a `boxy' or a `peanut' structure in the central parts of a model is due to the presence of vertical resonances at which stable families of periodic orbits bifurcate from the planar x 1 family. The orbits of these families reach in their projections on the equatorial plane a maximum distance from the centre, beyond which they increase their mean radii by increasing only their deviations from the equatorial plane. The resulting orbital profiles are `stair-type' and constitute the backbone for the observed boxy structures in <b>edge-on</b> <b>views</b> of N-body models and, we believe, in <b>edge-on</b> <b>views</b> of disc galaxies.

The <b>edge-on</b> <b>view</b> of this particular galaxy, originally considered to be a barred spiral galaxy, makes it difficult to determine its true shape, but it is considered that the galaxy consists of four main components — a central bulge, a bar, a thick disc and an outer ring. The galaxy's disc is asymmetric and warped, which could be explained by NGC 4762 mergering with a smaller galaxy in the past.

The 0. 5 - 10 keV spectrum of NGC 5135 is characterized by the standard components for a Compton-thick source: a scattered continuum, a prominent Fe Kα emission line (EW 2. 1 keV) and a soft excess. At higher energies (E > 10 keV) the intrinsic AGN continuum shows up, implying an absorbing column density of the order of 2. 5 × 10 ^ 24 cm^- 2 and the intrinsic 2. 0 - 10 keV X-ray luminosity of 1. 8 × 10 ^ 43 erg s^- 1.

In the present study, the structure of factor Va interacting with lipid surfaces containing phosphatidylserine was studied by electron microscopy. Two-dimensional crystals of factor Va were obtained on planar lipid films under quasi-physiological conditions. The two-dimensional projected structure of factor Va was calculated at a resolution of 2 nm, revealing dimers of factor Va arranged on the surface lattice with the symmetry of the plane group p 2. Average unit cell dimensions are a = 14. 4 nm, b = 8. 8 nm, γ = 107 °.

The disk width increases with distance in the outer disk (> 100 AU), but it is almost constant in the inner disk (< 100 AU) (Kalas and Jewitt, 1995; Krivova et al., 2000; Golimowski et al., 2006; Tamura et al., 2006). The flared structure of the outer disk is akin to the structure of the outer Kuiper Belt where the planetesimal disk is flared up from the ecliptic plane. Lecavelier des Etangs (1998) pointed out that the vertical structure of the β Pic disk might have resulted from the outward migration of multiple giant planets. In terms of Planet N, planetary migration is consistent with a planet formation scenario that precludes insitu formation of a planet at 62 AU around β Pic (Nakano, 1988). To place a planet at 62 AU around β Pic, however, the planet formation scenario might require rapid planet migration that is at odds with nearly circular, coplanar planetesimal rings. Consequently, the presence of Planet N at 62 AU would give new insights into formation of a planetary system, in particular, planetary migration.|$|R

Also, the line luminosities of the extranuclear knots are typical for giant H II regions. There is neither evidence for tidal tails nor for high velocity differences between the knots.

The bar in the model with the centrally concentrated halo (model MH) is much stronger, longer and thinner than the bar in the model with the less centrally concentrated halo (model MD). Its shape, when viewed side-on, evolves from boxy to peanut and then to X-shaped, as opposed to that of model MD, which stays boxy. The projected density profiles obtained from cuts along the bar major axis, both for the face-on and the <b>edge-on</b> <b>views,</b> show a flat part, {{as opposed to those}} of model MD which are falling rapidly. A Fourier analysis of the face-on density distribution of model MH shows very large m = 2, 4, 6 and 8 components. Contrary to this for model MD the components m = 6 and 8 are negligible. The velocity field of model MH shows strong deviations from axial symmetry, and in particular has wavy isovelocities {{near the end of the}} bar when viewed along the bar minor axis.

The properties of the bar of the model with a bulge and a non-centrally concentrated halo (MDB) are intermediate between those of the bar of the other two models.
