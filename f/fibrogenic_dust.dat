Release of lactic dehydrogenase into the culture medium was similar in both the agate and emery exposed cells but significantly less when compared with quartz treated cells. The effects of mineral dusts on lungs have been stud-ied experimentally by exposing animals to dusts by inhalation, by the instillation of dust into the lungs intratracheally, and by investigating dust-cell inter-actions in vitro, using erythrocytes, macrophages, and tissue culture cells lines. '- 5 Using these test systems it is possible to screen many dusts for their possible effects on the lungs when inhaled and to understand the mechanism of the cytotoxic, fibrogenic, and possi-bly the carcinogenic actions of some particulate and fibrous environmental and industrial pollutants. 6 - 9 Agate is a cryptocrystalline variety of silica that is used as an abrasive in industry. It replaces ballmills, particularly in the manufacture of substances where the product has to be absolutely free of iron con-tamination. It is also used in manufacturing mortars and pestles and fulcra and bearings of scientific and precision balances. The present studies were aimed at investigating the biological effects of agate dust in vivo and in vitro and to comparing the results with those obtained with the highly <b>fibrogenic</b> <b>dust,</b> quartz, and an inert dust, emery (Corundum).

40|$|Murine {{pulmonary}} alveolar macrophages (PAM) form macrophage {{colonies in}} vitro with colony-stimulating factors, which stimulate the clonal growth of radioresistant alveolar colony-forming cells (AL-CFC). The toxic effects of fibrogenic mineral dust particles on AL-CFC were investigated after intratracheal instillation into mice. Exposure to either crocidolite asbestos or silica (Min-u-sil) induced a significant depletion of AL-CFC {{as well as}} a decrease in PAM recovery compared to either untreated or titanium dioxide-exposed animals. Such effects were also noted with different doses (50 - 200 micrograms/animal) of instilled particles. The plating efficiency of AL-CFC was depleted in PAM exposed to fibrogenic particles in vitro, but not when exposed to nonfibrogenic titanium dioxide particles. These results indicate the toxic effects of <b>fibrogenic</b> <b>dust</b> particles on the clonal growth of PAM, cells which {{play a role in the}} clearance of inhaled particles from the lung and in subsequent pathologic processes...|$|E

40|$|Activation of {{alveolar}} macrophages (AM) for tumour necrosis factor {{production is}} suppressed initially during the inflammatory response to <b>fibrogenic</b> <b>dusts.</b> We investigated the mechanisms involved in TNF suppression, notably {{the role of}} other AM-derived mediators including prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2), transforming growth factor-β 1 (TGF-β 1), and interleukin 6 (IL- 6). The action of PGE 2 and TGF-β 1, on AM was different. At physiologically relevant doses (25 – 300 pg/ml), PGE 2 did not cause significant inhibition of Hpopolysaccharide (Lps) -induced TNF release by AM in vitro but stimulated IL- 6 (up to six fold), an inhibitor of AM-derived TNT. In contrast, TGF-β 1 (0. 5 – 50 ng/ml) inhibited both LPS-induced TNT and IL- 6 release by 50 % but {{had no effect on}} PGE 2 production by AM. To determine the respective contribution of these different inhibitors in TNF suppression, AM from rats exposed to fibrogenic asbestos for weeks were treated with neutralizing antibody against TGF-β 1 or indomethacin, an inhibitor of PGE 2 synthesis. Treatment of rat AM with anti-TGF-β 1 but not indomethacin, abrogated the observed TNT suppression. These results suggest that an autocrine, TGF-β 1 -dependent mechanism is involved in the down-regulation of TNF production by rat AM from animals with lung fibrosis...|$|R
40|$|Silicon carbide is {{produced}} by a chemical reaction at high temperature between free crystalline silica and petroleum coke. The process generates airborne fibers and <b>fibrogenic</b> <b>dusts</b> such as a-quartz and cristobalite, which are also potentially carci-nogenic. The authors report {{that this is the}} first cohort study in this industry. The study was carried out among 585 Quebec silicon carbide production workers who had worked at any time from 1950 to 1980. Follow-up was to December 31, 1989, and 167 deaths were observed. The standardized mortality ratio (SMR) for all causes of death was 1. 05 (95 % confidence interval (Cl) 0. 90 - 1. 23); for nonmalignant respiratory dis-eases it was 2. 03 (95 % Cl 1. 21 - 3. 22); and for lung cancer it was 1. 69 (95 % Cl 1. 09 - 2. 52). Controlling for smoking status using a Cox regression analysis, the risk for nonmalignant respiratory diseases and for lung cancer increased with exposure to total dust; in the highest exposure category, rate ratios (RR) were 4. 08 (95 % Cl 1. 11 - 14. 96) for nonmalignant respiratory diseases and 1. 67 (95 % Cl 0. 57 - 4. 83) for lung cancer.

40|$|Initial {{studies on}} {{mononuclear}} cell-fibroblast interactions {{have shown that}} stimulated human lymphocytes produced a fibroblast growth inhibitory factor and that asbestos, a <b>fibrogenic</b> <b>dust,</b> interferes with this process in vitro. To investigate the role of these interactions in pathologies characterized by pulmonary fibrosis, we used a rat model of asbestos-induced fibrosis. Rats received a single intratracheal instillation of either saline or 10 mg of chrysotile asbestos fibres. Three months after treatment, peripheral blood mononuclear leucocytes (PBML) supernatant fractions were prepared and their effects on lung fibroblast growth measured. As for human PBML, rat PBML stimulated with Concanavalin A (Con A) produced 24 h after initiation of the cultures a soluble factor which inhibits lung fibroblast DNA synthesis and growth in a dose-dependent fashion. By contrast, Con A-stimulated PBML from rats exposed to asbestos failed to produce significant levels of fibroblast growth inhibitory activity. No significant change of total PBML number or {{in the proportion of}} circulating mononuclear cell populations was observed. Furthermore, upon stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), monocytes from asbestotic animals retained their capacity to produce interleukin (IL- 1), a mediator required for lymphokine production. Our study demonstrates that suppression of FGIF production by circulating PBML occurs in animals with lung fibrosis and suggests that mechanisms other than impairment of IL- 1 production may be responsible for the suppressive effect of asbestos on the production of such fibroblast regulatory lymphokine...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT A {{group of}} 135 ex-employees of the Quebec {{chrysotile}} production industry comprising {{men who were}} born between 1901 and 1920, who had left the industry between 1950 and 1961, and had been radiographed before leaving, attended in 1972 for a medical examination and further chest radiograph. This report concerns 86 men whose withdrawal film was within 12 months of leaving and {{who had not been}} exposed subsequently to asbestos or other <b>fibrogenic</b> <b>dust.</b> Seven separate assessments were made of the paired radiographs, side by side in known temporal order. The assessments were classified as showing 'increse' or 'no change'. In 66 film-pairs from men with two years' employment or longer, at least four assessments were of parenchymal increase in six, of pleural increase in 13, and of both parenchymal and pleural increase in two, total 21 (or 31 %). There was similar agreement of no change in 24 pairs (36 %), and evidence was equivocal in the remaining 21 pairs. Parenchymal increase was not agreed in any of the 20 film-pairs from men with shorter employment, but pleural increase was seen in four of these men, a proportion similar to that in those exposed longer. We conclude that the parenchymal changes observed after leaving the industry, most of which were 'attacks' rather than 'progression', were attributable to the earlier occupational exposure to chrysotile; there were no important differences in age or smoking habit between those with and without parenchymal change...|$|E
40|$|Methods {{controlling}} tissue fibrosis {{are classified}} into those specifically inhibiting various metabolic asnects of collagen selectively in the injured tissue (ascorbic acid deficiency, effect of agent chelating Fe 2 +, proline analogs, lathyrogens). The most promising method {{seems to be}} the blocking of crosslinks formation among collagen molecules by,l-aminopropionitrile, a competitive inhibitor of a crosslinking enzyme, lysyl oxidase. The second group of methods is called nonspecific, as they affect any stage of inflammatory process preceding the activation of fibroblasts. The importance of activated macrophages in the stimulation of fibroblast is discussed. Finally, a new concept is proposed, indicating the function of zinc ions in the control of the integrity of biomembrances, tissue reactivity to noxious agents. It is suggested that zinc may control NADPH dependent lipid peroxidation at the membrane level by inhibiting NADPH oxidase activity. The implication of these ideas to lung fibrosis induced by silica or asbestos is discussed. I would like to focus attention on two topics of great importance to all of us who are involved in problems of fibrogenesis and tissue injury. The first topic deals with the pharmacological control of the abnormal deposition of collagen in forms of various fibrotic, cirrhotic, or sclerotic lesions. To this category belongs lung fibrosis after <b>fibrogenic</b> <b>dusts.</b> The second topic will deal with the role of various metals in the development of tissue injury with several implications related to metallic ions adjacent to the asbestos fiber...|$|R
40|$|Asbestos and silica are {{well-known}} <b>fibrogenic</b> <b>dusts.</b> However, {{there is}} no comprehensive understanding of the molecular and cellular events that lead to fibrosis {{as a consequence of}} asbestos or silica inhalation. Previous studies have shown that asbestos stimulates superoxide anion production in alveolar macrophages through the phospholipase C/protein kinase C pathway. In contrast, silica does not appear to activate this pathway nor stimulate superoxide anion production, but silica does stimulate cytokine release by some undetermined pathway. Therefore, using human alveolar macrophages isolated from normal healthy volunteers, we evaluated the potential involvement of intracellular calcium and tyrosine kinases as potential signal transduction pathways. In the absence of serum, crystalline silica, {{and to a lesser extent}} amorphous silica, caused a rapid and dose-dependent elevation of intracellular calcium coming from the extracellular space. However, in the presence of serum, which is required for silica-stimulated cytokine release, neither form of silica caused noticeable elevation of intracellular calcium. Silica, however, did increase the extent of tyrosine phosphorylation, most notably of proteins at approximately 46 and 50 kDa, suggesting activation of a tyrosine kinase pathway. Preincubation of alveolar macrophages for 24 hr with silica-primed human alveolar macrophages for enhanced interleukin- 1 0 (IL- 1 3) release stimulated by endotoxin (LPS) that was dose dependent. The enhanced LPS-stimulated release of IL- 1 i correlated with enhanced mitogen-activated protein kinase activity. Taken together, these results indicate that a tyrosine kinase pathway is activated during silica stimulation of human alveolar macrophages. - Enviro...|$|R

40|$|Previous study {{strongly}} suggests that silicotic fibrosis is mediated by macrophages and their soluble mediators. The biochemical properties of the mediators involved in silicotic fibrosis, however, are as yet ill defined. The current study, therefore, determined whether human monocyte-macrophages treated with <b>fibrogenic</b> silica <b>dust</b> released factors capable of activating fibroblasts as measured {{by an increase in}} fibroblast proliferation. Silica, but not nonfibrogenic diamond dust, stimulated the release of fibroblast proliferation factors. Moreover, the level of fibroblast proliferation activity was comparable with the level of thymocyte proliferation (interleukin- 1) activity in the same culture supernatants. The factors responsible for these seemingly diverse activities were found to behave identically when analyzed by gel filtration chromatography, size exclusion chromatography, isoelectrofocusing, ion exchange chromatography, and hydrophobic chromatography. Moreover, the response of these factors to four different proteases and heat (56 degrees C) was also identical, which shows that their comigration on various separation media could not be explained by noncovalent interaction between otherwise unrelated species. The data demonstrate that a monocyte-derived thymocyte proliferation factor having the molecular properties of interleukin 1 is capable of regulating fibroblast proliferation. In silicosis and other fibrotic diseases, the local release of interleukin 1 may contribute to abnormal connective tissue deposition by stimulating fibroblast proliferation, and thereby, amplifying other signals stimulating the synthesis of connective tissue components...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} whether previous health experiences affect {{the prevalence of}} occupational lung disease in a semirural Botswanan community {{where there is a}} long history of labour recruitment to South African mines. METHOD: A cross sectional prevalence study of 304 former miners examined according to a protocol including a questionnaire, chest radiograph, spirometry, and medical examination. RESULTS: Overall mean age was 56. 7 (range 28 - 93) years, mean duration of service 15. 5 (range 2 - 42) years. 26. 6 % had a history of tuberculosis. 23. 3 % had experienced a disabling occupational injury. Overall prevalence of pnemoconiosis (> 1 / 0 profusion, by the International Labour Organisation classification) was 26. 6 %- 31. 0 %, and 6. 8 % had progressive massive fibrosis (PMF). Many were entitled to compensation under South African law. Both radiograph readers detected time response relations between pneumoconiosis and PMF among the 234 underground gold miners. PMF could result from < 5 years of exposure, but was not found < 15 years after first exposure. Both pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) and pneumoconiosis were found to be associated with airflow limitation. CONCLUSIONS: Former miners in Botswana have a high prevalence of previously unrecognised pneumoconiosis, indicative of high previous exposures to <b>fibrogenic</b> respirable <b>dust.</b> Their pneumoconiosis went unrecognised because they had no access to surveillance after employment. Inadequate radiographic surveillance or failure to act on results when employed or when leaving employment at the mines could have contributed to under recognition. Community based studies of former miners are essential to fully evaluate the effects of mining exposures. Our findings indicate a failure of established measures to prevent or identify pneumoconiosis while these miners were in employment and show that few of the social costs of occupational lung diseases are borne by mining companies through the compensation system...|$|R
40|$|Phagocytosis of quartz {{particles}} by rabbit alveolar macrophages and monocytes {{and human}} granulocytes and monocytes {{was accompanied by}} stimulation of substrate free reduction of nitroblue tetrazolium to formazan. This reflects activation of an oxygen dependent bactericidal system of phagocytes and total (exogenic and endogenic) generation of active oxygen species. Low fibrogenic and cytotoxic alumina dust tended to increase formazan production by comparison with quartz dust. During phagocytosis of quartz dust by alveolar macrophages and monocytes there was no exogenic generation of superoxide radicals and hydrogen peroxide by these cells. By contrast, incubation of human granulocytes with quartz dust caused {{a significant increase in}} exogenic generation of superoxide radicals and hydrogen peroxide. Under such conditions, low <b>fibrogenic</b> alumina <b>dust</b> had no effect on hydrogen peroxide generation and substantially decreased the level of superoxide radical generation by human granulocytes. During incubation of rabbit granulocytes with quartz dust, an increase in the level of superoxide radical generation was also detected. It is considered that the differences between alveolar macrophages and granulocytes in their response to quartz dust are important from a physiological point of view. Alveolar macrophages are permanently present in pulmonary alveolae in large quantities; therefore their uncontrolled generation of superoxide radicals and hydrogen peroxide might immediately cause damage to pulmonary parenchyma. At the same time, destruction products from alveolar macrophages that died during phagocytosis of quartz particles contain a factor attracting granulocytes. Presence of a significant number of granulocytes in bronchopulmonary lavage fluid in cases of silicosis indicates development of a pathological process. This agrees well with the data obtained on exogenic generation of superoxide radicals and hydrogen peroxide by granulocytes, and on stimulation of this process due to phagocytosis of the quartz dust...|$|R
40|$|Slovakia {{has a long}} {{tradition}} in mining of iron ores, non-ferrous metals and magnesite. In addition to mining and raw material processing technologies, the environmental issues, especially the work subsystem environment, have been actively researched. The mining activity is generally connected with a high work risk rate. In the environment of mine, as well as during raw material processing it comes to the formation of harmful substances of which the solid mineral dust represents a dominant risk. Such a dust dispersed in air is called an aerosol. Dust and other components dispersed in the mine air medium produced within the technological mining and raw material processing and natural rock massive emanations, create the mine aerosol. Quartz is considered as the most dangerous mineral. If inhaled {{for a long period of}} time, it causes the incurable disease - pneumo-coniosis - silicosis. If quartz and other silicate minerals dominate in the dust deposited in the pulmonary organ, they cause fibrosis. The study of properties of quartz and quartz-like minerals enabled to evaluate the rate of risk in the individual mines. The experiments were carried out with various kinds of quartz and other minerals often occurring in the Slovak mines. A significant fact about the quartz was observed - the rate of fibrogenity is connected with the genetic properties of quartz. From the point of view of fibrogenity, the grain size and certain size class, which is often reposited in the pulmonary organ, also represent an important issue. The classes, representing a maximum fibrogenic effect have been determined. It is the case of particles of respirable character (< 5 µm), mainly those in the class range of 1  3 µm. These particles can get into the interstitium of lungs, initiating a creation of fibrogenic tissues. The movement of mineral individuals and their abidance in the mine air medium and mine aerosol is influenced by basic properties, which have been determined under simulated conditions and confirmed by in-situ measurements. These properties are shape, size, specific weight, as well as the properties of dispersion environment like humidity, flow, temperature, and, in particular conditions, the shape and profile of mine. The risk of mine aerosols has been studied in Slovak mines, while the research has been focused on those, operating before 1990. The following values have been determined: risk of dustiness R, specific harmfulness a of a cumulative dose of dust KDc, factor of <b>fibrogenic</b> effect of <b>dust</b> Mf, respirable ration of dust D, percentual ratio of quartz Q and the determination of the highest admissible concentration of dust on the particular workplace NPKc. On the basis of this study it was possible to determine the degree of risk in individual localities and to search possibilities of the dust prevention. It has been recommended to apply the method influencing the <b>fibrogenic</b> effects of <b>dust</b> before it penetrates the pulmonary organ - the use of hydroxide-aluminium compound in the washing and spraying water. The presented evaluation of dustiness risk and its prevention is not currently a topic of great significance due to the recession of the mining industry. Certain revival is expected in the construction of tunnels in connection with the planned project of construction of roads, when the mining works are required...|$|R
