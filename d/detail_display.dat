Dendrites along which the synaptic information is conveyed are the largest component of a neuron in surface area. The Cable theory for dendritic neurons addresses to current-voltage relations in a continuous passive dendritic tree. It is briefly summarized that the cable theory related to passive cables and dendrites, which is a useful approximation and an important reference for excitable cases. The proposed software {{can be used to}} construct user-defined dendritic tree model.

40|$|A {{user study}} was {{performed}} {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of high detail insets used with head-mounted displays. Ten subjects were given a simple search task that required the location and identification of a single target object. All subjects used seven different displays (the independent variable), varying in inset size and peripheral detail, to perform this task. Frame rate, target location, subject input method, and order of display use were all controlled. Primary dependent measures were search time on trials with correct identification, and the percentage of all trials correctly identified. ANOVAs of the results showed that insetless, high detail displays did not lead to significantly different search times or accuracies than displays with insets. In fact, only the insetless, low <b>detail</b> <b>display</b> returned significantly different results. Further research is being performed to examine the effect of task complexity, and to reach a better understanding of the effect of var [...] ...|$|E
40|$|This report {{highlights}} {{the spread of}} opinion amongst a group of European experts in application areas of identity management {{on the issue of}} interoperability of such systems. It builds from an earlier report that presented a literature review and an account of research in interoperability. It uses the three-part conceptual framework of technical, formal and informal dimensions through which to frame the questions posed and interpret the answers given. The 23 interviewees from 5 different European countries, while differing in <b>detail,</b> <b>display</b> a remarkable consensus on much of the issues. Application areas from which the experts are drawn cover egovernment, ehealth and ecommerce, and while, given their specific nature, there may be many points on which such areas diverge, the likelihood of interoperability is deemed to turn on a small number of key questions, mostly non-technical. Importance is given to building trust in the citizen and end-user through good communication, usability, compliance with data protection and privacy principles...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Scientists are {{now able}} to alter the {{genetics}} of vertebrate embryos routinely to produce animal models of human developmental diseases. However, our understanding of structural changes in these animal models is limited by current methodologies. Histological techniques, although providing great anatomic <b>detail,</b> <b>display</b> only 'static' data (one time point only) in two dimensions. Ultrasound may be used to generate continuous time course data, but is limited by interobserver variation, limited acoustic windows, and relatively low resolution. OBJECTIVE: To apply the high resolution, non-destructive, and three-dimensional acquisition capabilities of magnetic resonance (MR) microscopy to compare the hearts of normal mice versus an established transgenic mouse model of dilated cardiomyopathy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Transgenic mice exhibiting dilated cardiomyopathy were developed via the introduction of a mutated, heart-specific gene (myosin light chain). Postmortem cardiac imaging was performed on the transgenic mice and normal controls. MR imaging was performed on a Bruker 3 T imaging magnet using a custom radiofrequency coil following contrast perfusion of the atrial and ventricular chambers. Image resolution was 156 microm isotropic voxels. MR images were compared to gross pathologic specimens. Imaging data were post-processed using custom software to calculate the volumes of the atria and ventricles and to display the three-dimensional morphology of the chambers and myocardium. RESULTS: Of the seven mice scanned, four exhibited normal right atrial (average = 14. 8 microl +/- 1. 4), left atrial (average = 8. 5 microl +/- 0. 3), right ventricular (average = 12. 9 microl +/- 2. 7), and left ventricular (average 3. 3 microl +/- 0. 5) volumes. Three mice exhibited dilatation of the right and left cardiac chambers (RA average = 23. 9 microl +/- 5. 6; LA average = 15. 9 microl +/- 4. 8; RV average = 32. 5 microl +/- 6. 8; LV average 24. 0 microl +/- 1. 4). The gross morphology was verified upon autopsy of the animals and correlated with the animal's genotype. The differences in volumes between the normal and dilated cardiomyopathy mice were statistically significant (P values ranged from 0. 001 to 0. 024 for the different chambers). CONCLUSION: MR microscopy is a potentially useful tool for developmental biology research. The imaging of mouse hearts is feasible, and these methods provide quantitative and qualitative morphologic data of a mouse model of dilated cardiomyopathy not available using traditional methods.
