5|$|Polistes exclamans have comparably smaller nests and colonies {{compared}} to certain other eusocial wasps species. Thus, {{it is common}} for the nest to be destroyed, for the queen to die prior {{to the end of the}} season, or for the nest to fail through other means, such as predation, parasitisation, or worker mortality, leading workers to help rear broods that are less related to them than are their sister wasps. Due to this, it would be advantageous for there to be wasps that remain casteless till adulthood, allowing female wasps’ reproductive capabilities to be plastic. It has thus been predicted that Polistes exclamans worker wasps would act as workers if a brood were present and would begin to develop gyne characteristics if a brood was not present, exhibiting the aforementioned adaptive plasticity. Experimentally, this has been found to be true. Solis and Strassmann conducted a study in which an experimental group had the eggs and larvae removed. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>experimental</b> <b>group,</b> the wasps began to behave like future queens and even developed the characteristic layer of fat common to queens. In the control group, the wasps continued to behave as workers. This is indicative that the presence of the brood affects caste differentiation and that Polistes exclamans female workers exhibits adaptive reproductive plasticity.|$|E
5|$|Several {{recent studies}} attempt {{to examine the}} effects of chronic low-dose {{manganese}} overexposure on child development. The earliest study was conducted in the Chinese province of Shanxi. Drinking water there had been contaminated through improper sewage irrigation and contained 240–350µg Mn/L. Although Mn concentrations at or below 300µg Mn/L were considered safe at the time of the study by the US EPA and 400µg Mn/L by the World Health Organization, the 92 children sampled (between 11 and 13 years of age) from this province displayed lower performance on tests of manual dexterity and rapidity, short-term memory, and visual identification, compared to children from an uncontaminated area. More recently, a study of 10-year-old children in Bangladesh showed a relationship between Mn concentration in well water and diminished IQ scores. A third study conducted in Quebec examined school children between the ages of 6 and 15 living in homes that received water from a well containing 610µg Mn/L; controls lived in homes that received water from a 160µg Mn/L well. Children <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>experimental</b> <b>group</b> showed increased hyperactive and oppositional behavior.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To examine neovascularization <b>in</b> <b>the</b> TMJ <b>in</b> {{response}} to mandibular forward positioning. Material and Methods: One hundred female Sprague-Dawley rats, 5 weeks of age, {{were divided into}} 5 <b>experimental</b> <b>groups</b> and 5 control groups. Functional appliances were fitted to the upper incisors of animals <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>experimental</b> <b>groups,</b> causing a continuous mandibular protrusion. <b>The</b> animals <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>experimental</b> <b>groups,</b> together with their matched controls, were sacrificed 3, 7, 14, 21, and 30 days after mandibular protrusion. 7 -痠 sections were cut through the TMJ and were processed for immunohistochemical analysis. Neovascularization was assessed by immunostaining for endothelial cells using the monoclonal antibody EN 7 / 44. Immunolocalization of neovascularization was quantified using Leica Qwin system. Results: <b>In</b> <b>the</b> fibrous tissue connecting the posterior aspects of both the condyle and the glenoid fossa, the amount of immunostaining for neovascularization <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>experimental</b> <b>groups</b> was on average 200 % higher than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> controls (P < 0. 001). <b>In</b> <b>the</b> condylar bondy tissue, as well as <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bony tissue of the fossa, the amount of immunostaining for neovascularization <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>experimental</b> <b>groups</b> was on average 103 % and 163 % higher than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> controls (P < 0. 001).

25|$|The {{learning}} curve for cued recall increases systematically {{with the number}} of trials completed. This result has caused a debate about whether or not learning is all-or-none. One theory is that learning is incremental and that the recall of each word pair is strengthened with repetition. Another theory suggests that learning is all-or-none, that is one learns the word pair in a single trial and memory performance is due to the average learned pairs, some of which are learned on earlier trials and some on later trials. To examine the validity of these theories researchers have performed memory experiments. In one experiment published in 1959, experimental psychologist Irvin Rock and colleague Walter Heimer of the University of Illinois had both a control group and an experimental group learn pairs of words. The control group studied word pairs that were repeated until the participants learned all the word pairs. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>experimental</b> <b>group,</b> the learned pairs remained in the list while unlearned pairs were substituted with recombinations of previous words. Rock believed that associations between two items would be strengthened if learning were incremental even when pairs are not correctly recalled. His hypothesis was that the control group would have a higher correct recall probability than the experimental group. He thought that repetition would increase the strength of the word pair until the strength reaches a threshold needed to produce an overt response. If learning were all or none, then the control group and the experimental group should learn the word pairs at the same rate. Rock found experimentally there was little difference in learning rates between the two groups. However, Rock's work did not settle the controversy because in his experiment he rearranged replaced word pairs that could be either easier or harder to learn than the original words in the word- digit pair. In further experiments that addressed the question, there were mixed results. The incremental learning hypothesis is supported by the notion that awhile after Ai-Bi pairs are learned, the recall time to recall Bi decreases with continued learning trails.|$|E
500|$|There is {{a common}} notion that sugar leads to hyperactivity, in {{particular}} in children, but studies and meta-studies question or address this issue. Some articles and studies do refer to the increasing evidence supporting the links between refined sugar and hyperactivity. The WHO FAO meta-study suggests that such inconclusive results {{are to be expected}} when some studies do not effectively segregate or control for free sugars as opposed to sugars still in their natural form (entirely unrefined) while others do. One study followed thirty-five 5-to-7-year-old boys who were reported by their mothers to be behaviorally [...] "sugar-sensitive." [...] They were randomly assigned to experimental and control groups. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>experimental</b> <b>group,</b> mothers were told that their children were fed sugar, and, in the control group, mothers were told that their children received a placebo. In fact, all children received the placebo, but mothers in the sugar expectancy condition rated their children as significantly more hyperactive. This result suggests that the real effect of sugar is that it increases worrying among parents with preconceived notions.|$|E

The experiment was performed at an experimental farm (EF) and a commercial farm (CF). Digesta was {{collected from the}} ileum, caecum and colon of four piglets from each group on days 29, 30, 33 and 39. The metabolite concentrations changed with age. Colonic and caecal metabolites were affected by prebiotic treatment. Changes in microbiota composition were assessed by cultivation and {{denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis}} (DGGE) of 16 S rRNA gene fragments.
