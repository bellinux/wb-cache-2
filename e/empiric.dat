5|$|There {{are several}} ways to {{classify}} climates into similar regimes. Originally, climes were defined in Ancient Greece to describe the weather depending upon a location's latitude. Modern climate classification methods can be broadly divided into genetic methods, which focus on the causes of climate, and <b>empiric</b> methods, which focus on the effects of climate. Examples of genetic classification include methods based on the relative frequency of different air mass types or locations within synoptic weather disturbances. Examples of <b>empiric</b> classifications include climate zones defined by plant hardiness, evapotranspiration, or more generally the Köppen climate classification which was originally designed to identify the climates associated with certain biomes. A common shortcoming of these classification schemes is that they produce distinct boundaries between the zones they define, rather than the gradual transition of climate properties more common in nature.|$|E

The diet reduces levels of insulin-like growth factor 1, which is important for childhood growth. Like many anticonvulsant drugs, the ketogenic diet has an adverse effect on bone health. Many factors may be involved such as acidosis and suppressed growth hormone. About 1 in 20 children on the ketogenic diet will develop kidney stones (compared with one in several thousand for the general population). A class of anticonvulsants known as carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (topiramate, zonisamide) are known to increase the risk of kidney stones, but the combination of these anticonvulsants and the ketogenic diet does not appear to elevate the risk above that of the diet alone. The stones are treatable and do not justify discontinuation of the diet. Johns Hopkins Hospital now gives oral potassium citrate supplements to all ketogenic diet patients, resulting in a sevenfold decrease in the incidence of kidney stones. However, this <b>empiric</b> usage has not been tested in a prospective controlled trial. Kidney stone formation (nephrolithiasis) is associated with the diet for four reasons: ...|$|E

Subject/course: Independent thesis {{in business administration}} 15 credits Author: Sara Karlsson & Åse Thorsen Mentor: Gunnar Wramsby Examiner: Urban Österlund Seminar:  2015 - 05 - 26 Keywords: Goodwill, impairment test, discount rate, IFRS, IAS 36 and IAS 38 Purpose: This thesis aims {{to explain how the}} selected companies reason about IAS 36 and how they reason about changes in the market. Method: This thesis is based on a deductive approach. The thesis is mainly qualitative in which five interviews were conducted and facts from annual reports have been obtained. The thesis also has a quantitative part where the discount rates for the various companies were surveyed. Theory: The theoretical framework is based on theories of goodwill, discount rate, accounting principles, goodwill impairment and goodwill impairment testing. The authors also look closely at internal problems in the acquisition, such as principal/agent theory. Empiric: Empirical data were collected through four mail interviews and one telephone interview. The purpose of the interviews was to gain an insight into how the interview respondents reason about IAS 36. Furthermore, empirical evidence gathered from the annual reports of the companies was surveyed. Empirical data was based on a period of ten years. The companies that have been researched are Meda, Trelleborg, ICA Gruppen, Indutrade and Boliden. Analysis: The analysis is based on comparisons between theory and <b>empirics</b> and between <b>empirics</b> and <b>empirics.</b> Conclusion: The conclusion is based on the analysis that was composed. It is also a comparison of <b>empirics</b> with <b>empirics.</b> The thesis conclusion shows that companies generally follow IAS 36 guidelines well but lack in some areas. Furthermore, the conclusion shows that the grounds for the discount rate did not differ significantly between the companies investigated, nor over time. ...|$|R

Besides the IT artefact, there are other important artefacts to build and study in DR. There are models and prototypes which are produced during information systems development. This paper has investigated the <b>empirics</b> of design research, especially activities and outcomes.

Two cases of public e-service design form the empirical bases for this conceptual development. The <b>empirics</b> of design research (i. e. a design practice) is distinguished from the theorizing part of DR. Empirical data of DR to be used for theorizing consist of produced artefacts, embedded data collection for design and theory-required data collection.

2500|$|The Fourier {{series is}} named {{in honour of}} Jean-Baptiste Joseph Fourier (1768–1830), who made {{important}} contributions {{to the study of}} trigonometric series, after preliminary investigations by Leonhard Euler, Jean le Rond d'Alembert, and Daniel Bernoulli. Fourier introduced the series for the purpose of solving the heat equation in a metal plate, publishing his initial results in his 1807 Mémoire sur la propagation de la chaleur dans les corps solides (Treatise on the propagation of heat in solid bodies), and publishing his Théorie analytique de la chaleur (Analytical theory of heat) in 1822. The Mémoire introduced Fourier analysis, specifically Fourier series. Through Fourier's research the fact was established that an arbitrary (continuous) function can be represented by a trigonometric series. The first announcement of this great discovery was made by Fourier in 1807, before the French Academy.

According to Wehler, Foucault's works are not only insufficient in their <b>empiric</b> historical aspects, but also often contradictory and lacking in clarity. For example, Foucault's concept of power is [...] "desperatingly undifferentiated", and Foucault's thesis of a [...] "disciplinary society" [...] is, according to Wehler, only possible because Foucault does not properly differentiate between authority, force, power, violence and legitimacy. In addition, his thesis is based on a one-sided choice of sources (prisons and psychiatric institutions) and neglects other types of organizations as e.g. factories. Also, Wehler criticizes Foucault's [...] "francocentrism" [...] because he did not take into consideration major German-speaking theorists of social sciences like Max Weber and Norbert Elias. In all, Wehler concludes that Foucault is [...] "because of the endless series of flaws in his so-called empirical studies ... an intellectually dishonest, empirically absolutely unreliable, crypto-normativist seducer of Postmodernism".|$|E
