500|$|René Angélil, Dion, and the Sony family began {{selecting}} prospective songs at {{the beginning}} of 2001, and on 28 August 2001 she started recording vocal tracks for nearly two dozen songs at Montreal's Piccolo Studios. Because of Dion's unwillingness to leave her seven-month-old baby, the album's collaborators traveled to Montreal. [...] "I didn't feel the pressure to try and outdo anything," [...] Dion said of her time in the studio. [...] "I proved myself before, so now I can enjoy. I was relaxed, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>let</b> go. It was such a pleasure." [...] The album was scheduled for release internationally on 25 March 2002 and in North America on 26 March 2002. However, it was first released in Australia, on 22 March 2002.|$|E
500|$|Wright's main {{influence}} was jazz, particularly Miles Davis and John Coltrane. He never considered himself a typical songwriter, preferring to create whole albums of {{music with a}} theme, later saying [...] "if {{the words came out}} like the music, and we didn't have anything else to do, then quite a few would be written". A number of compositions credited to Wright came out of improvisation and randomly trying ideas, some of which were picked up enthusiastically by his band mates. Wright later said [...] "I just play and don't really think about what I'm doing, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>let</b> it happen". Of all the Pink Floyd members, Wright was the most reserved, sitting down behind the keyboards and concentrating on the music.|$|E
500|$|When she {{was growing}} up, Aaliyah {{attended}} Detroit schools and believed she was well-liked, but got teased for her short stature. She recalled coming into her own prior to age 15 and grew to love her height. Her mother would tell her to be happy that she was small and compliment her. Other children disliked Aaliyah, {{but she did not}} stay focused on them. [...] "You always have to deal with people who are jealous, but there were so few it didn't even matter. The majority of kids supported me, which was wonderful. When it comes to dealing with negative people, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>let</b> it in one ear and out the other. Those people were invisible to me." [...] Even in her adult life, she considered herself small. She had [...] "learned to accept and love" [...] herself and added: [...] "...the {{most important thing is to}} think highly of yourself because if you don't, no one else will".|$|E

2500|$|Charles stuttered {{throughout}} his career despite trying almost every sort of stuttering therapy, ranging from rhythmic control, relaxation, slow speech, and breathing exercises, to psychoanalysis and hypnosis. He eventually managed to become very fluent even though he continued to stutter. Charles {{wrote in a letter}} to a newsletter that he had lived a [...] "very successful and happy life", a result of an idea that came to him while hitch-hiking his way home from Rhinelander, Wisconsin, where he had spent a month as the hired man on a farm, pretending to be a deaf mute because his stuttering was so severe that he could not get any other employment: he met an old stutterer who said that he was [...] "too old and tired to fight myself now so <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>let</b> the words leak out"; Charles realised that he should have been seeking a way of stuttering that would be tolerable both to others and himself, instead of avoiding and hiding his stutter.|$|E

60|$|That's all he said, and that's all I said. It warn't {{no use to}} say any more; {{because when}} he said he'd do a thing, he always done it. But I couldn't make out how {{he was willing to}} go into this thing; so <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>let</b> it go, and never bothered no more about it. If he was bound to have it so, I couldn't help it.|$|E

6000|$|Cornelia {{wanted to}} laugh; {{at the same}} time she {{wondered}} what new kind of crazy person she had got with; this was hardly one of the art-students that went wild from overwork. Miss Maybough kept on without waiting to be answered: [...] "I haven't got a bit of pride, myself. <b>I</b> could <b>just</b> <b>let</b> you walk over me. How does it feel to be proud?

60|$|I know a lot. If I {{told you}} all I know, you'd be surprised.

I watch the foolish noises made by the low-grades, and I can fool anybody. And I know a lot of foolish noises. Miss Kelsey called me a fool the other day.

6000|$|... "I don't {{believe such}} things," [...] {{at last she}} snapped out, [...] "and I don't disbelieve them. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>let</b> 'em alone. What do I know about 'em? Ruth tells me a story; and I believe her. I know what she saw beforehand, came true in a most {{remarkable}} way. Well, I'm sure I've no objection. One thing may be true, or another, for all me; but, just because I believe Ruth Sullivan, I'm not going to believe, right and left, all the stories in Cotton Mather, and all that anybody can hawk up to tell. Not I." ...|$|E
60|$|BENTLEY. Yes. Thats {{an idea of}} mine. I knew a chap named Joey Percival at Oxford (you know I was {{two months}} at Balliol before I was sent down for telling the old woman who was head of that silly college what I jolly well thought of him. He would have been glad to have me back, too, {{at the end of}} six months; but I wouldnt go: <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>let</b> him want; and serve him right!) Well, Joey was a most awfully clever fellow, and so nice! I asked him what made such a {{difference}} between him and all the other pups--they were pups, if you like. He told me it was very simple: they had only one father apiece; and he had three.|$|E

6000|$|Devine laughed. [...] "It's quite easy. You {{have just}} about sense enough to worry anybody, or you wouldn't have dumped that ore into the Dayspring, and worked {{off one of}} the richest mines in the {{province}} on to me. Well, when I saw you meant to strike me on the Canopus, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>let</b> you get to work because it suited me. I figured it would keep you busy while I took out timber-rights and bought up land round the Dayspring. Nobody believed in Allonby, and I got what I wanted at quite a reasonable figure. I'm holding the mine and everything worth while now. There's nothing left for you, and I guess it would be wiser to get hold of a man of your own weight next time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know what}} 'squadrons' means nor 'Midian,' either, {{but it sounds}} SO tragical. I can hardly wait until next Sunday to recite it. I'll {{practice}} it all the week. After Sunday school I asked Miss Rogerson--because Mrs. Lynde was too far away--to show me your pew. I sat just as still as I could and the text was Revelations, third chapter, second and third verses. It was a very long text. If I was a minister I'd pick the short, snappy ones. The sermon was awfully long, too. I suppose the minister had to match it to the text. I didn't {{think he was a}} bit interesting. The trouble with him seems to be that he hasn't enough imagination. I didn't listen to him very much. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>let</b> my thoughts run and I thought of the most surprising things." ...|$|E
60|$|Well, if Fate insists in {{bringing}} New York to England for my special discomfiture, I suppose I {{have got to}} put up with it. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>let</b> events take their course, and I have been drifting ever since. Two days ago I drifted here. Mr. Carmyle invited Fillmore--he seems to love Fillmore--and me to Monk's Crofton, and I hadn't even the shadow of an excuse for refusing. So I came, and I am now sitting writing to you in an enormous bedroom with an open fire and armchairs and every other sort of luxury. Fillmore is out golfing. He sails for New York on Saturday on the Mauretania. I am horrified to hear from him that, in addition to all his other big schemes, he is now promoting a fight for the light-weight championship in Jersey City, and guaranteeing enormous sums to both boxers. It's no good arguing with him. If you do, he simply quotes figures to show the fortunes other people have made out of these things. Besides, it's too late now, anyway. As far as I can make out, the fight is going to take place in another week or two. All the same, it makes my flesh creep.|$|E
