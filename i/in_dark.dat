50|$|Jack <b>in</b> the <b>Dark</b> is a {{small game}} made during Alone <b>in</b> the <b>Dark</b> 2 production.

5|$|Unlike its predecessor, Mysteries of the Sith has a single, morally {{positive}} course, as {{the player}} progresses through {{the game in}} a linear fashion. The game includes most of the enemies featured <b>in</b> <b>Dark</b> Forces II, plus some new monsters.

5|$|According to Stephen Shaw, most of Mysteries of the Siths {{content was}} {{inspired}} by Timothy Zahn's Thrawn trilogy of books; one of the game's protagonists, Mara Jade, was drawn directly from the novels. Though the expansion includes characters from the previous game, new dialogue was recorded for Mysteries of the Siths scenario, including recurring background characters who speak similar lines to their counterparts <b>in</b> <b>Dark</b> Forces II. Some dialogue was authentically translated into Huttese, a fictional language used in Return of the Jedi {{and elsewhere in the}} Star Wars universe. The Star Wars original soundtrack by John Williams is used in Mysteries of the Sith.|$|E
5|$|Appliqué art, {{which is}} a stitching-based craft unlike embroidery, was pioneered by Hatta Maharana of Pipili. It is widely used in Puri, both for {{decoration}} of the deities and for sale. Maharana's family members are employed as darjis or tailors or sebaks by the Maharaja of Puri. They prepare articles for decorating the deities in the temple for various festivals and religious ceremonies. The appliqué works are brightly coloured and patterned fabric {{in the form of}} canopies, umbrellas, drapery, carry bags, flags, coverings of dummy horses and cows, and other household textiles; these are marketed in Puri. The cloth used is made <b>in</b> <b>dark</b> colours of red, black, yellow, green, blue and turquoise blue.|$|E

5|$|Dark Forces {{gameplay}} expands on the FPS {{standards set}} by Doom in 1993, and features gameplay elements that are now common in the FPS genre. These include the ability to look up and down, duck, and jump. A variety of power-ups are {{made available to the}} player, including health, shields, weapons and ammunition. The game also features several non-combat items to aid the player. The head lamp illuminates the area in front of the player, but will reveal the player's position to enemies <b>in</b> <b>dark</b> rooms. Ice cleats provide traction in icy areas, and an air mask protects the player from areas with toxic atmosphere. Many inventory items are powered by batteries (separate from weapon ammunition types) which can be found around the levels.|$|E

5|$|Holmes {{described}} the Christmas setting as a juxtaposition between the joyful {{time of year}} and the grim world of Gotham City, including decorative Santas near Gothic gargoyles and Christmas lights <b>in</b> <b>dark</b> alleys. The city is dislodged from time and space, contrasting 1930s (and older) buildings with Batman's futuristic technology. The New Gotham area was designed for vertical movement, allowing the placement of enemies above and below Batman to create areas dense with activity. The game features high contrast between darks and lights, with exaggerated shadows and few balancing colors. The city was divided into residential, industrial and commercial neighborhoods, which were decorated accordingly: the industrial setting is bleak, the commercial area has corporate decorations and residential neighborhoods have lights in their windows.|$|E
