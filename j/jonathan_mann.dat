2500|$|The Global Health Council, Harvard School of Public Health, Harvard Medical School {{and several}} other {{prominent}} global health organisations issued a joint statement of support for Sen, requesting that Indian authorities allow the doctor to receive the <b>Jonathan</b> <b>Mann</b> Award for Health and Human Rights in person in Washington, D.C. on 29 May 2008, at the 35th Annual International Conference on Global Health. The declaration stated: [...] "We {{would also like to}} convey our concern and dismay that Dr. Sen remains imprisoned, after nearly one year without trial, on allegations that he passed notes from a rebel leader whom he treated in jail to a person outside the prison. Dr. Sen has denied all wrongdoing and nothing in his character or history, as a dedicated community leader who has urged a peaceful settlement to this conflict for years, would support the accusations made against him. These allegations have not been substantiated or proven and have prevented Dr. Sen from providing his much-needed health services to the poor in his area, as well as his community leadership activities as an officer of the People's Union for Civil Liberties." ...|$|E
