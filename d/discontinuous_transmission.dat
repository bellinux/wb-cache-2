Having {{considered}} the mapping of logical traffic and control channels onto physical channels, speech and error correction coding, interleaving {{as well as}} the TDMA hierarchy and synchronisation problems in Part I of this contribution, here mainly transmission issues are addressed [I - 61 and some performance figures are provided. Constant envelope partial response Gaussian Minimum Shift Keying (GMSK) with a channel spacing of 200 kHz is deployed to support 125 duplex channels in the 890 - 91 5 MHz uplink and 935 - 960 MHz downlink bands, respectively. At a transmission rate of 271 kbitls 1. 35 bitlslHz spectral efficiency is achieved. The controlled GMSK-induced and un-controlled channel-induced inter-symbol interferences are removed by the channel equaliser. The set of standardised wide-band GSM channels is introduced in order to provide bench-markers for performance comparisons. Efficient power budgeting and minimum co-channel interferences are ensured by the combination of adaptive power- and handover-control based on weighted averaging of up to eight uplink and downlink system parameters. <b>Discontinuous</b> <b>transmissions</b> (DTX) assisted by reliable spectral-domain voice activity detection (VAD) and comfort-noise insertion further reduce interferences and power consumption. Due to ciphering, no unprotected information is sent via the radio link.

40|$|Abstract. Detecting the {{presence}} of speech in a noisy signal is an unsolved problem affecting numerous speech processing applications. This paper shows an effective method employing support vector machines (SVM) for voice activity detection (VAD) in noisy environments. The use of kernels in SVM enables to map the data into some other dot product space (called feature space) via a nonlinear transformation. The feature vector includes the subband signal-to-noise ratios of the input speech and a radial basis function (RBF) kernel is used as SVM model. It is shown {{the ability of the}} proposed method to learn how the signal is masked by the acoustic noise and to define an effective non-linear decision rule.

40|$|Abstract Background Of {{the major}} {{families}} of {{long terminal repeat}} (LTR) retrotransposons, the Pao / BEL family is probably the least well studied. It is becoming apparent that numerous LTR retrotransposons and other mobile genetic elements have colonized the genome of the human blood fluke, Schistosoma mansoni. Results A proviral form of Sinbad, a new LTR retrotransposon, was identified in the genome of S. mansoni. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that Sinbad belongs to one of five discreet subfamilies of Pao/BEL like elements. BLAST searches of whole genomes and EST databases indicated that members of this clade occurred in species of the Insecta, Nematoda, Echinodermata and Chordata, as well as Platyhelminthes, but were absent from all plants, fungi and lower eukaryotes examined. Among the deuterostomes examined, only aquatic species harbored these types of elements. All four species of nematode examined were positive for Sinbad sequences, although among insect and vertebrate genomes, some were positive and some negative. The full length, consensus Sinbad retrotransposon was 6, 287 bp long and was flanked at its 5 '- and 3 '-ends by identical LTRs of 386 bp. Sinbad displayed a triple Cys-His RNA binding motif characteristic of Gag of Pao / BEL -like elements, followed by the enzymatic domains of protease, reverse transcriptase (RT), RNAseH, and integrase, in that order. A phylogenetic tree of deduced RT sequences from 26 elements revealed that Sinbad was most closely related to an unnamed element from the zebrafish Danio rerio and to Saci- 1, also from S. mansoni. It was also closely related to Pao from Bombyx mori and to Ninja of Drosophila simulans. Sinbad was only distantly related to the other schistosome LTR retrotransposons Boudicca, Gulliver, Saci- 2, Saci- 3, and Fugitive, which are gypsy -like. Southern hybridization and bioinformatics analyses indicated that there were about 50 copies of Sinbad in the S. mansoni genome. The presence of ESTs representing transcripts of Sinbad in numerous developmental stages of S. mansoni along with the identical 5 '- and 3 '-LTR sequences suggests that Sinbad is an active retrotransposon. Conclusion Sinbad is a Pao/BEL type retrotransposon from the genome of S. mansoni. The Pao/BEL group appears to be comprised of at least five discrete subfamilies, which tend to cluster with host species phylogeny. Pao/BEL type elements appear to have colonized only the genomes of the Animalia. The distribution of these elements in the Ecdysozoa, Deuterostomia, and Lophotrochozoa is <b>discontinuous,</b> suggesting horizontal <b>transmission</b> and/or efficient elimination of Pao -like mobile genetic elements from some genomes. </p...|$|R

50|$|For a {{wide range}} of {{applications}} such as digital mobile radio, Digital Simultaneous Voice and Data (DSVD) or speech storage, it is desirable to provide a <b>discontinuous</b> <b>transmission</b> of speech-coding parameters. Advantages can include lower average power consumption in mobile handsets, higher average bit rate for simultaneous services like data transmission, or a higher capacity on storage chips. However, the improvement depends mainly on the percentage of pauses during speech and the reliability of the VAD used to detect these intervals. On the one hand, it is advantageous to have a low percentage of speech activity. On the other hand clipping, that is the loss of milliseconds of active speech, should be minimized to preserve quality. This is the crucial problem for a VAD algorithm under heavy noise conditions.|$|E
