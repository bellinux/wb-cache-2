25|$|A {{spate of}} {{accidents}} involving MU-2s occurred in Australia between 1983 and 1994, {{some of which}} were caused by <b>icing</b> <b>on</b> the airframe. This caused the airspeed to decrease {{to the point where the}} aircraft stalled and entered a spin.|$|E
25|$|Subfreezing {{conditions}} have significant implications for naval operations. The 1988 US Navy Cold Weather Handbook for Surface Ships outlines effects on: <b>icing</b> <b>on</b> the topsides of ships, ship systems, underway replenishment, flight operations, and personnel. It also discusses preparations for cold-weather fleet operations.|$|E
25|$|On 26 January 1974, Turkish Airlines Flight 301, a Fokker F28-1000 {{registered}} as TC-JAO crashed shortly after takeoff from Izmir Cumaovası Airport due to atmospheric <b>icing</b> <b>on</b> the wings. The aircraft disintegrated and caught fire, killing 4 of the 5 crew and 62 of the 68 passengers on board.|$|E

25|$|On November 22, 2013, Boeing {{issued an}} {{advisory}} to airlines using General Electric GEnx engines on 787 and 747-8 aircraft to avoid flying near high-level thunderstorms {{due to an}} increased risk of <b>icing</b> <b>on</b> the engines. The problem was caused by a buildup of ice crystals just behind the main fan, causing a brief loss of thrust on six occasions.|$|E
25|$|Adding to the plane's {{troubles}} was the pilots' {{decision to}} maneuver closely behind a DC-9 that was taxiing {{just ahead of}} them prior to takeoff, due to their mistaken belief that the warmth from the DC-9's engines would melt the snow and ice that had accumulated on Flight 90's wings. This action—which went specifically against flight manual recommendations for an icing situation—actually contributed to additional <b>icing</b> <b>on</b> the 737. The exhaust gases from the other aircraft melted the snow on the wings, but during takeoff, instead of falling off the plane, this slush mixture froze on the wings' leading edges and the engine inlet nose cone.|$|E
25|$|Freezing: In cold {{conditions}} the cooling effect of gas expanding through a valve orifice may cool either {{first or second}} stage sufficiently to cause ice to form. External icing may lock up the spring and exposed moving parts of first or second stage, and freezing of moisture in the air may cause <b>icing</b> <b>on</b> internal surfaces. Either may cause the moving parts of the affected stage to jam open or closed. If the valve freezes closed, it will usually defrost quite rapidly and start working again, and may freeze open soon after. Freezing open {{is more of a}} problem, as the valve will then free-flow and cool further in a positive feedback loop, which can normally only be stopped by closing the cylinder valve and waiting for the ice to thaw. If not stopped, the cylinder will rapidly be emptied.|$|E

40|$|Friction {{processes}} of rubber <b>on</b> <b>ice,</b> steel <b>on</b> <b>ice</b> and <b>ice</b> <b>on</b> <b>ice</b> {{have been investigated}} by measuring contact forces in controlled laboratory experiments. A carefully prepared ice plate was rotated at a constant speed and brought into contact with a ring on which torque and normal load was measured. Replicas of {{the different types of}} standardized ice surfaces were studied in microscope. Friction of rubber <b>on</b> <b>ice</b> reached a maximum value at a sliding speed of abt. 100 mm/min. At a temperature of- 10 °C this maximum friction coefficient decreased with increasing ice surface roughness. Friction of steel <b>on</b> <b>ice</b> increased with decreasing speed and no maximum value was obtained. <b>Ice</b> sliding <b>on</b> <b>ice</b> at low speed resulted in high friction forces when sintering took place...|$|R
25|$|Holders Paris Saint-Germain were {{through to}} the last-16 of the League Cup after Fabrice Pancrate's goal proved enough for the reigning champions to beat AS Monaco. Paris Saint-Germain's defence of the League Cup {{continued}} against Nancy after the draw for the last-16, quarter-finals and semi-finals was made. Péguy Luyindula scored both goals in Paris Saint-Germain's victory over Nancy to send the holders {{through to the}} quarter-finals of the League Cup. In a dramatic twist of fate, Paris Saint-Germain hosted Lens in the pick of the quarter-final draw. In a remake of last season's Final, Paris Saint-Germain defeated Lens at the Parc des Princes {{to qualify for the}} semi-finals of the League Cup, where they met Bordeaux, winners over Châteauroux. Late goals from Souleymane Diawara and Wendel added to David Bellion's first-half strike put the <b>icing</b> <b>on</b> the cake as Bordeaux cruised past Paris Saint-Germain in the League Cup semi-final at the Parc des Princes.|$|E
25|$|In {{the return}} {{leg of the}} quarter final tie, the Mariners {{demolished}} Salgaocar 4–0 riding on a brace from Haitian playmaker Sony Norde and goals from Katsumi Yusa and Jeje Lalpekhlua. It was Katsumi Yusa who started the scoring in the 25th minute reaching {{at the end of}} a Sony Norde cross and tapping it easily into an open net. Minutes away from the half time whistle Sony Norde scored his first of the match and the tournament as he beautifully cut in from the left and put the ball in the net past the goalkeeper to ensure that Bagan went into the lemon break with a 3-goal advantage on aggregate. The Green and Maroon brigade started off the second half, where they ended the first. It was a piece of individual brilliance by Haitian playmaker Sony Norde as he went past three Salgaocar defenders and put the ball in the net with relative ease to score his second of the night. In the final minute of the match, a beautiful through ball from Cornell Glen saw Jeje Lalpekhlua tap it in with utter ease to put the <b>icing</b> <b>on</b> the cake of the Green and Maroon victory.|$|E
