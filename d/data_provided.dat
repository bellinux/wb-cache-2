5|$|Ava {{was also}} {{underneath}} the NOAA-2 and Nimbus 5 weather satellites. NOAA-2 provided photographs {{that were used}} to estimate Ava's maximum windspeeds. Satellite images were useful throughout the cyclone's existence, as did the wind reports of three ships when Ava was a young tropical storm. Nimbus 5 carried an Electrically Scanning Microwave Radiometer and Temperature-Humidity Infrared Radiometer. Both were used to study Ava. The main <b>data</b> <b>provided</b> by the THIR was data indicating cloud temperatures. The ESMR's main data was on rainfall rates, densities, and distributions. The observations also provided confirmation that clouds that are not vertically developed very much can produce tropical rainfall.|$|E

40|$|Web {{services}} {{are often used}} for search computing where data is retrieved from servers providing information of different kinds. Such <b>data</b> <b>providing</b> web services return a set of objects for a given set of parameters without any side effects. There is need to enable general and scalable search capabilities of <b>data</b> from <b>data</b> <b>providing</b> web services, which is the topic of this Thesis. The Web Service MEDiator (WSMED) system automatically provides relational views of any <b>data</b> <b>providing</b> web service operations by reading the WSDL documents describing them. These views can be queried with SQL. Without any knowledge {{of the costs of}} executing specific web service operations the WSMED query processor automatically and adaptively finds an optimized parallel execution plan calling queried <b>data</b> <b>providing</b> web services. For scalable execution of queries to <b>data</b> <b>providing</b> web services, an algebra operator PAP adaptively parallelizes calls in execution plans to web service operations until no significant performance improvement is measured, based on monitoring the flow from web service operations without any cost knowledge or extensive memory usage. To comply with the Everything as a Service (XaaS) paradigm WSMED itself is implemented as a web service that provides web service operations to query and combine data from dat...|$|R

5|$|As {{part of the}} {{scientific}} exchange, the Maud Committee's findings were conveyed to the United States. One of its members, the Australian physicist Mark Oliphant, flew to the United States in late August 1941 and discovered that <b>data</b> <b>provided</b> by the Maud Committee had not reached key American physicists. Oliphant then {{set out to find}} out why the committee's findings were apparently being ignored. He met with the Uranium Committee and visited Berkeley, California, where he spoke persuasively to Ernest O. Lawrence. Lawrence was sufficiently impressed to commence his own research into uranium. He in turn spoke to James B. Conant, Arthur H. Compton and George B. Pegram. Oliphant's mission was therefore a success; key American physicists were now aware of the potential power of an atomic bomb.|$|E
5|$|By 2017, sauropod fossils {{had been}} {{recovered}} from a total of 32 localities within the Nemegt Formation, and possibly belong to either Opisthocoelicaudia or Nemegtosaurus. At least two finds from the Nemegt locality — a fragmentary tail (MPD 100/406) {{and a pair of}} claws – show features diagnostic for Opisthocoelicaudia and can be referred to the latter. Field crews led by Philip Currie attempted to relocate the Opisthocoelicaudia holotype quarry in 2006 and 2008, but became successful only in 2009 thanks to additional <b>data</b> <b>provided</b> by Gradziński. Although a prospection for additional bone material was not possible as the quarry had been filled by windblown sand, the quarry could be determined to fall within the lower portion of the Nemegt Formation.|$|E

5|$|Senior project {{engineer}} Ralph Hooper at Hawker promptly set about establishing an initial layout for a theoretical aircraft {{to take advantage}} of the Pegasus engine, using <b>data</b> <b>provided</b> by Bristol. This proposed aircraft soon received the internal designation P.1127. In July 1957, a modification made to the design was the incorporation of a bifurcated tailpipe, similar to the Hawker Sea Hawk, which was equipped with rotatable nozzles for the hot exhaust, similar those already used for the cold exhaust. The switch from a single tailpipe meant that the initial tailwheel undercarriage could also be discarded in favour a conventional nose wheel-led undercarriage. The design process extended throughout 1958, being financed entirely by Hawker, while approaches were made to NATO headquarters to better establish the tactical requirements sought, particularly between the conflicting demands for a lightly armed supersonic fighter and a simpler multipurpose subsonic one.|$|E
5|$|Tropical cyclone {{forecasting}} also {{relies on}} <b>data</b> <b>provided</b> by numerical weather models. Three main classes of tropical cyclone guidance models exist: Statistical models {{are based on}} an analysis of storm behavior using climatology, and correlate a storm's position and date to produce a forecast that {{is not based on}} the physics of the atmosphere at the time. Dynamical models are numerical models that solve the governing equations of fluid flow in the atmosphere; they are based on the same principles as other limited-area numerical weather prediction models but may include special computational techniques such as refined spatial domains that move along with the cyclone. Models that use elements of both approaches are called statistical-dynamical models.|$|E
