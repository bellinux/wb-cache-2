5|$|Three weeks later, some {{children}} {{playing in the}} street wandered <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> of the now-vacant house. One of them fell into the cellar and discovered the tunnel. While the prison's Board of Inspectors was unable to identify the inmate involved in the escape attempt, the warden punished Berkman by sending him to solitary confinement for nearly a year. Days after {{he was released from}} solitary, Berkman tried to hang himself with a strip of his blanket.|$|E
5|$|Not {{much had}} {{changed by the}} 1960s. The day began with a waking bell at 6:45am. After a {{prisoner}} count, they moved <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> until 7:30, when they collected breakfast {{and headed back to}} their cells. The 8:00 bell signaled a parade, and then the start of work, which lasted until 11:15. They ate a meal, locked in their cells until 12:20pm, followed by some time in the yards. At 1:00 there was another parade, and another session of work which lasted to 4:15. Another meal was collected, and prisoners were locked away in their cells overnight. The lights stayed on until 9:30pm. On the weekends the routine featured no work, and included a film played for the prisoners.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the planned extension, the two tracks {{continue}} east of this station for about 700 feet along 205th Street to Webster Avenue, ending at a concrete wall, and this station does not have any crew quarters. Crews are changed at Bedford Park Boulevard, the next station south. Additionally, there is no diamond crossover between the tracks west of this station; here, a center track forms leading west to the Concourse Yard. Because of this, terminating trains arrive on the southern (railroad northbound) track and discharge their passengers before continuing east {{to the end of the}} track. They then use the diamond crossover there to return to this station on the northern (railroad southbound) track and begin service to Manhattan and Brooklyn. Due to the track configuration, trains may reverse <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> from the southern track, and trains from the yard may start service on the northern track.|$|E
50|$|The {{town was}} {{named in the}} early 1860s. The name derives from an old dun-coloured working bullock, called Banana, used by local stockmen to help them when herding some of <b>the</b> wilder cattle <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>yards.</b>|$|R

5000|$|In January 2014, a large {{force of}} Israeli {{soldiers}} entered {{the village in}} the middle of the night, seeking [...] "two wanted men", who turned out to be two boys, aged 11 and 13. As they were leaving, they threw stun grenades <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>yards</b> of <b>the</b> homes they passed.|$|R
5|$|Inmates were {{permitted}} out <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> on Saturdays and Sundays and on holidays for {{a maximum of}} 5 hours. Inmates who worked {{seven days a week}} in the kitchen were rewarded with short yard breaks during the weekdays. Badly behaved prisoners were liable to having their yard access rights taken away from them on weekends. The prisoners of Alcatraz {{were permitted}} to play games such as baseball, softball and other sports at these times and intellectual games such as chess. Because of the small size of the yard and the diamond at the end of it, a section of the wall behind the first base had to be padded to cushion the impact of inmates overrunning it. Inmates were provided gloves, bats, and balls, but no sport uniforms. In 1938, there were four amateur teams, the Bees, Oaks, Oilers, and Seals, named after Minor League clubs, and four league teams named after Major League clubs, the Cardinals, Cubs, Giants, and Tigers. Many of the inmates used weekends in the yards to converse with each other and discuss crime, the only real opportunities they had during the week for a durable conversation.|$|E
5|$|Outside their tree house, Finn and Jake snooze, while BMO (Niki Yang) and N.E.P.T.R. (Andy Milonakis) {{play out}} a spoof of Robin Hood and the Sheriff of Nottingham. The two break open Finn and Jake's {{treasure}} room, pouring their massive stash of gold out <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard,</b> {{as well as}} the Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant (Steve Agee). BMO talks Finn into spending the money at an expensive resort at Wildberry Kingdom. When they arrive in the town square, Jake unloads their treasure into the city's fountain. A guard scolds them for this, but they bribe him with a few shillings and a crown, freeing them from the law. Chaos follows shortly after Jake uses wealth to control the residents. When they disrespect her authority, Wildberry Princess (Maria Bamford) orders Finn and Jake to be arrested and for their money to be seized and melted down. Her punishment is for them to be covered in the molten gold, but BMO and N.E.P.T.R. arrive just in time and save the two.|$|E
25|$|Chard {{realised}} {{that the}} north wall, under near constant Zulu attack, could not be held. At 6:00 pm, he pulled his men back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard,</b> abandoning the front two rooms of the hospital in the process. The hospital was becoming untenable; as the loopholes had become a liability: rifles poking out were grabbed at by the Zulus, yet if the holes were left empty, the Zulu warriors stuck their own weapons through in order to fire into the rooms. Among the soldiers assigned to the hospital were Corporal William Wilson Allen and Privates Cole, Dunbar, Hitch, Horrigan, John Williams, Joseph Williams, Alfred Henry Hook, Robert Jones, and William Jones.|$|E

25|$|On 29 April 1952, Straffen {{went with}} an {{attendant}} and another patient to clean some outbuildings that {{were close to}} the 10-foot-tall external wall. In a small yard immediately adjacent to the wall was a low shed with a sloping roof that was 8½ feet high at its highest point. In the yard were empty disinfectant tins. Straffen asked his supervisor if he could shake his duster and, on receiving permission, went <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard.</b> Once the other patient had gone back in, Straffen climbed onto the roof and jumped over the wall. He had already made sure he had his civilian clothes under his work clothes.|$|E
25|$|During {{the worst}} years of Cabrini–Green's problems, {{vandalism}} increased substantially. Gang members and miscreants covered interior walls with graffiti and damaged doors, windows, and elevators. Rat and cockroach infestations were commonplace, rotting garbage stacked up in clogged trash chutes (it once piled {{up to the}} 15th floor), and basic utilities (water, electricity, etc.) often malfunctioned and were left unrepaired. On the exterior, boarded-up windows, burned-out areas of the façade, and pavement instead of green space—all {{in the name of}} economizing on maintenance—created an atmosphere of decay and government neglect. The balconies were fenced in to prevent residents from emptying garbage cans <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard,</b> and from falling or being thrown to their deaths. This created the appearance of a large prison tier, or of animal cages, which further enraged community leaders of the residents.|$|E
25|$|Having said that, {{he moves}} the log a little forward and throws a coin into the fire. The {{woman of the}} house puts a woolen blanket on the polazniks back, and seats him on a low stool by the fireplace. In {{the moment when he}} sits down, they try to pull away the stool beneath him, as if to make him fall on the floor. The polaznik goes out <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard,</b> and throws grain inside a circle made with the rope with which Christmas straw has been tied, calling chickens. When they gather in the circle he catches a rooster, whose head is then cut off by him or the head of {{household}} on the house's threshold. The rooster will be roasted on a wooden spit as part of Christmas dinner. The polaznik usually stays for dinner with the family. He receives a gift {{in the form of a}} round cake with an embedded coin, and a towel, shirt, socks, or some other useful thing.|$|E

It says that bicycles and motorcycles should be pushed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> with engines turned off. [...] A policy of locking the halls {{when they are not}} in use has also been enacted to prevent homeless people from camping there. Some stray dogs have adopted Tịnh Xá Trung Tâm as their home and traipse about during rituals; they are fed vegetarian food. Although begging is not allowed inside the monastery grounds, it is allowed on the footpath outside the camp, and several handicapped people have made themselves a regular presence there.|$|E
500|$|In Greece, a {{large log}} was lit on the hearth on Christmas Eve and kept burning or {{smoldering}} through the Twelve Days of Christmas. This was {{done as a}} protection against the demons called Kallikantzaroi, believed to be emerging from their dens at night during that period to attack people and damage their property. The fire and smoke from the log was thought to prevent the Kallikantzaroi from entering the house down the chimney. The ritual burning of logs on the Eve was also carried out in Albania. When the buzm, as the log was called there, {{was about to be}} brought into the house, {{a member of the family}} would go out <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard,</b> shout the name of the household's head, and proclaim that the buzm was coming and bringing all kinds of delicious things. The head of the household would respond by saying [...] "You are welcome!" [...] and the buzm would be ceremonially brought in, greeted by the family and treated with great respect. The log would be placed on the hearth, and often a significant part of all food and drink in the house would be put on the log and burned together with it.|$|E
