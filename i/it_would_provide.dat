5|$|On 29 April 1970, South Vietnamese and U.S. units {{unleashed}} a limited, multi-pronged Cambodian Campaign that Washington hoped would solve three problems: First, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>provide</b> a shield for the American withdrawal from Vietnam (by destroying the PAVN logistical system and killing enemy troops) in Cambodia; second, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>provide</b> {{a test for}} the policy of Vietnamization; third, it {{would serve as a}} signal to Hanoi that Nixon meant business. Despite Nixon's appreciation of Lon Nol's position, the Cambodian leader was not even informed in advance of the decision to send troops into his country. He learned about it only after it had begun from the head of the U.S. mission, who had himself learned about it from a radio broadcast.|$|E
5|$|The 1930s road follows Telford's road {{as far as}} Bridge of Orchy, then runs to {{the east}} of Loch Tulla, while the old road runs to the other side. The project was criticised over spoiling the natural beauty of Glen Coe, but was defended by the Ministry of Transport who thought <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>provide</b> better {{transport}} links to Argyllshire and Inverness-shire.|$|E
5|$|The {{field at}} Waterloo was 5.5km wide, with two {{parallel}} ridges running west to east, creating a shallow valley 1.4km across. On the allied right lay the chateau of Hougoumont, {{a collection of}} walled farm buildings lying closer to the French line than the Allies' line. Recognising its defensive importance, Wellington ordered Hanoverian and Nassau troops to occupy the farm. In allied hands, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>provide</b> cover for flanking fire against any French assault of the main allied line; in French hands, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>provide</b> a bastion from which they could launch attacks. Since it defended the Nivelles road {{as well as the}} Allies' right flank, Wellington ordered that it was to be held at all costs.|$|E

50|$|In 2011, after 125 years, The Co-operative Insurance {{announced}} that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> cease <b>providing</b> life assurance products.|$|R
5|$|Thirdly, Hays faced {{opposition}} to {{his choice of}} Prince Rupert, on Kaien Island, B.C., for the western terminal, because {{there was not much}} traffic there. Hays preferred the location as he believed <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>provide</b> a shorter route for transshipment to destinations in Asia.|$|E
5|$|Two {{weeks after}} the storm, the World Food Programme {{announced}} <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>provide</b> food for 60,000people in the impacted areas of Mozambique. On March 27, the government of Portugal donated $700,000(USD) to the Mozambique National Disasters Management Institute; {{over half of the}} total was aid for flood victims affected by Jokwe and flooding earlier in the year.|$|E
5|$|At Briton Ferry, {{the canal}} ends under the M4 {{motorway}} at a scrapyard, {{but there are}} plans to refurbish Brunel's Briton Ferry dock, just to the south, and a short extension to <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>provide</b> a good terminus. In Neath itself, a masterplan for the Canal Green area, developing both the river frontage and canal sides, {{has the potential to}} provide a canal basin and moorings for Neath.|$|E

5|$|Brown {{called his}} new {{franchise}} the Bengals because Cincinnati had {{a team of}} that name in the 1930s and he thought <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>provide</b> {{a link to the}} past. Brown's son Mike joined the front office and became his father's top assistant and right-hand man. Brown brought in other assistants including Bill Johnson, Rick Forzano and Bill Walsh. In their first two seasons in 1968 and 1969, the Bengals fared poorly, but the team appeared to be on the upswing as Brown built up a core group of players through the draft, including quarterback Greg Cook.|$|E
5|$|Orban {{said that}} he {{intended}} to spearhead the Commission's work on a portfolio that has become more important with every enlargement and assured the Members of the European Parliament that his portfolio was a substantial one, covering a range of important political and managerial responsibilities. He also described how his portforlio would contribute to economic competitiveness, the social dimension of the EU and the intercultural dialogue and stated that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>provide</b> a forum for European political dialogue.|$|E
5|$|Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire {{take place}} in the Hoenn region, located some {{distance}} from the Kanto and Johto regions featured in previous games. The design of Hoenn was based on the Japanese island and region of Kyushu; however Hoenn is rotated 90° relative to Kyushu, as Junichi Masuda felt that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>provide</b> a better gameplay balance. Like Kyushu, Hoenn possesses many smaller islands, and part of the region is dominated by sea routes, several of which contain areas where the player can dive underwater.|$|E

5000|$|... === British support === In March 2016, {{during the}} UK-France Summit in Paris, the British {{government}} announced that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> consider <b>providing</b> support to Operation Barkhane. British Defence Secretary Michael Fallon then {{announced that the}} UK <b>would</b> <b>provide</b> monthly strategic airlift support to French forces in Africa.|$|R

5|$|The GCV {{was to be}} {{operable}} {{with the}} current battle command control and communications suite but would gradually use a more state-of-the-art networked integration system known as the BCT Network. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>provide</b> exportable electrical power, and a battery charging capability for external hardware including vehicles and electronics from the BCT Soldier subsystems. The system {{would be capable of}} integration with unmanned systems and dismounted soldiers.|$|E
5|$|With this decision, {{development}} proceeded swiftly. The team quickly {{decided the}} setting would be islands in an ocean, determining <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>provide</b> interesting visuals and mechanics in the cel-shaded style. This in turn inspired the central sailing feature. Some features drew skepticism; for instance producers Miyamoto and Tezuka requested {{an explanation for}} the characters' exaggeratedly large eyes. The team jokingly suggested having Link shoot beams from his eyes before deciding to have him focus his gaze on significant objects nearby, giving hints to observant players about what to do next.|$|E
5|$|Although the Auburn Dam is now mostly {{considered}} history, {{there are}} still proponents and groups devoted to restarting the long-inactive project. Advocates argue that the construction of Auburn {{would be the only}} solution for providing much-needed flood protection to the Sacramento area; that millions of dollars have already been spent making preparations; that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>provide</b> an abundant supply of reliable water and hydroelectricity; and also that the recreational areas lost under the reservoir could be rebuilt around it. A major supporter of the revival of the dam is the Sacramento County Taxpayer's League; a recent survey revealed that up to two-thirds of Sacramento citizens support construction of the Auburn. They also argue that the dam would only cost $2.6 billion instead of $6–10 billion, and that it is the cheapest alternative to provide flood control for the American River.|$|E
50|$|The Ministry of Foreign Affairs {{retained}} its own department charged with security work, but <b>it</b> <b>would</b> only <b>provide</b> for {{security and the}} flow of information to Croatia's diplomatic offices abroad.|$|R

5|$|During {{the same}} year, the State of Texas {{announced}} <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>provide</b> $500,000 worth of grant funds to Gulfton-area agencies for crime prevention programs. The state targeted Gulfton because the zip code had 419 juvenile probation referrals, the highest for any zip code in Harris County. After the grant was established, GANO, the Shenandoah Civic Association, and GARC {{worked together to}} reduce juvenile crime. In 1995, Nelson Reyes, a counselor for immigrants from Mexico and El Salvador at the Gulfton Area Neighborhood Organization, said that local parents had positive attitudes about living in Gulfton as they made more money {{than they did in}} their home countries, but Gulfton-area children felt impacted by the area crime.|$|E
5|$|Multiple eyewalls {{had been}} {{detected}} in very strong hurricanes before, including Typhoon Sarah and Hurricane Donna, although the double eyes were usually seen in very intense systems. Double eyewalls were also seen post-seeding {{in some of}} the seeded storms. At the time however, the only known times that rapid changes in eyewall diameter, other than during presumably successful seedings, was during rapid changes in intensity. It remained controversial whether the seedings caused the secondary eyewalls or whether it was just a natural cycle. Basically, if eyewall changes similar to those observed in seeded hurricanes were rare in unseeded tropical cyclones, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>provide</b> powerful evidence that Project Stormfury was successful. Conversely, if such changes were common in unseeded systems, it would throw doubt on the very hypothesis and assumptions driving Project Stormfury.|$|E
5|$|The CCE's {{two bills}} were {{submitted}} to Parliament {{at the same}} time as a large number of other bills for underground railways in the capital. As it had done in 1892, Parliament established a joint committee under Lord Windsor to review the bills. By the time the committee had produced its report, the parliamentary session was almost over and the promoters of the bills were asked to resubmit them for the following 1902 session. Bills No. 1 and No. 2 were resubmitted in November 1901 together with a new bill – bill No. 3. The new bill modified the route of the proposed extension to Golders Green and added a short extension running beneath Charing Cross main line station to the Victoria Embankment where <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>provide</b> an interchange with the existing MDR station (then called Charing Cross).|$|E

5|$|The {{invasion}} planners specified a set {{of conditions}} regarding {{the timing of the}} invasion, deeming only a few days in each month suitable. A full moon was desirable, as <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>provide</b> illumination for aircraft pilots and have the highest tides. The Allies wanted to schedule the landings for shortly before dawn, midway between low and high tide, with the tide coming in. This would improve the visibility of obstacles the enemy had placed on the beach while minimising the amount of time the men had to spend exposed in the open. Specific criteria were also set for wind speed, visibility, and cloud cover. Eisenhower had tentatively selected 5 June as the date for the assault. However, on 4 June, conditions were clearly unsuitable for a landing; high winds and heavy seas made it impossible to launch landing craft, and low clouds would prevent aircraft from finding their targets.|$|E
5|$|Widerøe {{came with}} an {{alternative}} proposal and suggested that a network of smaller airports be built instead, which could be served using short take-off and landing (STOL) aircraft. Smaller airports could be built and operated at lower costs than larger airports, but both airports and airlines would need subsidies to operate. Håkon Kyllingmark was appointed Minister of Transport and Communications in 1965 and was a proponent of the STOLport proposal. The political rationale was that, despite that the total operating costs would rise, that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>provide</b> better services to rural areas and thus keep up their population. The regional airports were built in groups, and the first four were built in Namsos and Helgeland.|$|E
5|$|A committee, led by Erik Himle {{and later}} Preben Munthe, was {{appointed}} in 1962 to consider additional airports in Norway. The Sud Aviation Caravelle {{was about to}} the phased into use on the main domestic routes and the committee recommended in 1964 that nine new airports be built which could serve jetliners, including one airport in Florø. Widerøe came with an alternative proposal and suggested that a network of smaller airports be built instead, which could be served using short take-off and landing aircraft, which were being developed at the time. Smaller airports could be built and operated at lower cost than larger airports, but both airports and airlines would need subsidies to operate.
