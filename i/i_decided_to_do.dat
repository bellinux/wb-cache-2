[...] The success and recognition of Exiles score landed Wall the job of writing Revelations music with a budget of $100,000—twice the amount he had worked with for Exile.|$|E
500|$|... "Bedtime Story" [...] {{was written}} by Icelandic singer-songwriter Björk, Marius De Vries and Hooper, and co-produced by Madonna and Hooper. According to author Mark Pytlik in his book Björk: Wow and Flutter, Madonna was {{inspired}} at that time by Björk's second studio album, Debut (1993). Through her connections with De Vries and Hooper, Madonna {{got in touch with}} Björk and offered her a chance to write a track for Bedtime Stories. Björk did not consider herself a fan of Madonna's music, but she was intrigued by the offer and she accepted it. She wrote a song initially named [...] "Let's Get Unconscious", with the opening lyrics [...] "Today is the last day, That I'm using words"—the lines being born out of Björk's own criticism of Madonna's aesthetic. The singer clarified, [...] "When I was offered to write a song for , I couldn't really picture me doing a song that would suit her... But on second thought, <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this to write the things I have always wanted to hear her say that she's never said." ...|$|E

[...] "Dr. Marigold" [...] has just now {{accomplished}} his two hundred thousand. My only other news about myself is that I am doubtful whether to read or not in London this season. If <b>I</b> <b>decide</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it at all, I shall probably do it on a large scale.|$|R
500|$|In December 2003, Welling {{made his}} feature film debut as Charlie Baker, the oldest son and second oldest in the Baker family which had 12 children, {{in the family}} comedy Cheaper by the Dozen with Steve Martin and Bonnie Hunt, which is a remake of the 1950 movie {{starring}} Clifton Webb and Myrna Loy, based on [...] Frank and Lillian Gilbreth's 1948 book. Welling talked about why {{he was interested in}} the project in an interview with Paul Fischer: [...] "The top three reasons <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this film were, one, Steve Martin, two, Steve Martin and three, Steve Martin. That was the number one draw for me. Then, after reading the script, I really liked this character, Charlie. I liked what he went through, what he had to go through, and I felt I understood where he was coming from. And I just {{wanted to be a part}} of it." [...] Welling had always been a fan of Martin's and stated that he [...] "absolutely loved" [...] working with him.|$|E
500|$|The last parody {{recorded}} for {{the album was}} [...] "Lasagna", a parody of the traditional folk song [...] "La Bamba". The song is mainly about Italian culture with a heavy emphasis on cuisine. When Yankovic began writing the song, he originally {{wanted it to be}} sung in Italian. He later said, [...] "I was actually going through Italian phrase books and dictionaries until I realized that the humor would be lost on 99% of the audience, so <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the whole thing in English but with kind of a bad Italian accent." [...] When the song was released as a single, it did not have a music video. However, ten years later in 1997 a short video was made for The Weird Al Show. Under U.S. law, Yankovic can parody any song he wants as long as he pays royalties to use the original music. However, as a personal rule, he asks for permission anyway in order to maintain good relations with the industry. This particular song is an exception to that rule. Although the song is a parody of the Los Lobos cover version, [...] "Lasagna" [...] marked Yankovic's first parody that did not require either permission from an artist or a payment of royalties, since the song [...] "La Bamba" [...] is a traditional folk song that is not attributed to any specific writer. Thus, Yankovic is the only writer given credit in the liner notes.|$|E
2500|$|Canadian comedian Rick Miller first {{conceived}} {{of the idea}} of blending The Simpsons and Shakespeare in 1994. At the time, Miller was performing in a production of Macbeth, playing the minor role of Murderer No. 2. He said, [...] "That's a small role, so I {{had a lot of time}} to sit backstage and concoct ideas, one of which was to make fun of our production. By then, The Simpsons had become a big part of pop culture, so <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the voices of those cartoon characters in my mangled version of the play." [...] He performed a skit at that night's closing party, which was well received.|$|E

It's a dreadful misfortune, but I was born that way, and there is no use in blaming me for it, as some people do. So I couldn't make up my mind to go and speak to you, much as I wanted to." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "As {{for whether}} there will be another Ayreon album, I'm never sure. Ten years could go by before <b>I</b> <b>decide</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> another one. <b>I</b> have to say {{that a lot of the}} reviews for 01 said it had some cool moments but it had that typical Ayreon sound, that there was nothing new being offered, and I think I can agree with that. <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> I'm going <b>to</b> stop with this Ayreon story, with this sound, and {{concentrate}} on other projects first. Then, if <b>I</b> <b>decide</b> <b>to</b> go back <b>to</b> Ayreon I'll <b>do</b> something different with it. I have no idea how (laughs), but if there's going to be another one it should be different." ...|$|R
2500|$|In 1984, Zappa {{prepared}} a remix of Cruising with Ruben & the Jets for its compact disc reissue and the vinyl box set The Old Masters I. The remix featured new rhythm tracks recorded by bassist Arthur Barrow and drummer Chad Wackerman, {{much as the}} 1984 remix of We're Only in It for the Money had featured. Zappa stated [...] "The master tapes for Ruben and the Jets were in better shape, but since I liked the results on We're Only in it For the Money, <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it on Ruben too. But those {{are the only two}} albums on which the original performances were replaced. I thought the important thing was the material itself." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} for the New York Times magazine, Danger Mouse was compared to a film auteur, basing his music production philosophy on the cinematic philosophy of directors like Woody Allen. [...] "Woody Allen was an auteur: he did his thing, and that particular thing was completely his own," [...] he said. [...] "That's what <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with music. I {{want to create a}} director's role within music, which is what I tried to do on this album (St. Elsewhere)... I can create different kinds of musical worlds, but the artist needs the desire to go into that world... Musically, there is no one who has the career I want. That's why I have to use film directors as a model." ...|$|E
2500|$|Different {{artists have}} written songs in Caylee's memory, often titled [...] "Caylee's Song". Jon Whynock {{performed}} {{his own version}} at her memorial service in February 2009, and Sheffield songwriter Earl [...] "Peanutt" [...] Montgomery, an Alabama Music Hall of Fame member known for writing hits for country artist George Jones, penned a [...] "Caylee's Song" [...] soon after hearing the verdict. [...] "Me and my wife talked about it, and <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it", said Montgomery. He sent an MP3 of [...] "Caylee" [...] to CNN and the cable news show Nancy Grace, {{as well as to}} various radio stations and Internet radio stations. Rascal Flatts' Gary LeVox collaborated with country comedian and radio host Cledus T. Judd and songwriter Jimmy Yeary to write a song titled [...] "She's Going Places" [...] in Caylee's memory, which would be performed by singer Shane Hines. On July8, 2011, Grace played it for her audience.|$|E

2500|$|According to Rodríguez, {{the origins}} of the film go back to Desperado. He says, [...] "When I met Danny, I said, 'This guy should be like the Mexican Jean-Claude Van Damme or Charles Bronson, putting out a movie every year and his name should be Machete.' So <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> that way back when, never got around to it until finally now. So now, of course, I want to keep going and do a feature." [...] In an {{interview}} with Rolling Stone magazine, Rodriguez said that he wrote the screenplay back in 1993 when he cast Trejo in Desperado. [...] "So I wrote him this idea of a federale from Mexico who gets hired to do hatchet jobs in the U.S. I had heard sometimes FBI or DEA have a really tough job that they don't want to get their own agents killed on, they'll hire an agent from Mexico to come do the job for $25,000. I thought, [...] "That's Machete. He would come and do a really dangerous job for {{a lot of money to}} him but for everyone else over here it's peanuts." [...] But I never got around to making it." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1992, future First Lady Hillary Clinton {{said during}} a 60 Minutes {{interview}} either [...] "I'm not sitting here as some little woman standing by my man like Tammy Wynette". or [...] "I'm not sitting here like some little woman standing by my man like Tammy Wynette". (The end of this quotation has also appeared as [...] "some little woman, standing by my man and baking cookies, like Tammy Wynette." [...] However, the reference to cookie baking more likely comes from an unrelated remark by Hillary Clinton: [...] "I suppose I could have stayed home and baked cookies and had teas, but what <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> was to fulfill my profession which I entered before my husband was in public life.") The remark set off a firestorm of controversy. Wynette wrote to Clinton, saying, [...] "With all that is in me, I resent your caustic remark. I believe you have offended every true country-music fan and every person who has made {{it on their own}} with no one to take them to the White House." [...] Clinton then called to apologize after she saw the large negative reaction she received, and asked Wynette to perform at a fundraiser. Wynette agreed to do so.|$|E

60|$|That {{evening was}} {{in a very real}} sense a parting of the ways for me. To refuse this call was to go selfishly and comfortably along the lines of {{literary}} activity I had chosen. To accept was to enter the arena where problems of economic justice were being sternly fought out. I understood already something of the disadvantage which attached to being called a reformer, but my sense of duty and the influence of Herbert Spencer and Walt Whitman rose above my doubts. <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> my part.|$|E

I had no idea of acting except in the most open manner, and I called at Deringham Hall yesterday afternoon, and sent in my card in a perfectly orthodox way, as you may have heard. Your mother took quite an unexpected view of the whole affair, owing partly to your father's unfortunate state of health and partly to some extraordinary attempts which, I am given to understand, have been made to rob him of his work. She was very anxious to help me, but insisted that it must be secretly. Last night's business was, I admit, a ghastly mistake--only it was not my mistake! I yielded to Lady Deringham's proposals under strong protest. As a man, I think I may say of some intelligence, I am ashamed of the whole affair; at the same time I am guilty only of an indiscretion which was sanctioned and instigated by your mother. I really do not see how I can take any blame to myself in the matter." ...|$|E
