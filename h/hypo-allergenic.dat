Since Cornish Rex cats groom as much as or even more than ordinary cats, a Cornish Rex cat can still produce a reaction in people who are allergic to cats. However, it is widely reported to cause lesser to little allergic reaction. It is recommended a potential owner visit a cattery to check their own tolerance.|$|E

50|$|While regular vacuum {{cleaners}} {{are designed to}} simply contain visible dirt and debris, hypoallergenic vacuums are designed to trap {{almost all of the}} smaller particles which in a regular vacuum are simply re-circulated into the ambient air. While this is not an issue for most people who do not suffer allergies, many with particular sensitivities to allergens (including asthma) can find that this not only does not help their condition, but stirring the dust into the air can make the condition worse.Most modern hypoallergenic {{vacuum cleaners}} use a system consisting of four primary components: the final output filter (generally a HEPA or similar filter), the motor and fan or impeller assembly, secondary particle filter to protect the motor assembly, and a primary filter - a bag, cup or wet filter bucket (each of which provide the initial filtration and retention of most dust and contaminants). Modern high quality hypoallergenic vacuum cleaners generally use HEPA (High Efficiency Particle Arrestor) filters to trap the vast majority (at least 99.97%) of very small particles that other vacuum cleaners would simply re-emit into the ambient air - ideally specifying a recognised and independently tested HEPA filter grade (see HEPA article) rather than just using the term. Recently many cheaper 'HEPA type' filters have appeared on the market attempting to capitalise on the term, these are generally inferior and do not meet the stringent requirements set by the US Dept of Energy (or in Europe EN 1822) to call themselves HEPA, and have not been independently tested to assess their ability to stop dust egress. While many dry bagless systems include HEPA grade filtration, the user is generally exposed to the very dust and allergens they are trying to avoid during emptying/cleaning the system. Anti-allergy bagged systems avoid most of this risk with a bag that will contain dirt and contaminants, and wet filter bagless systems also allow emptying without exposure to airborne particles as it is contained in a 'mud'. While Wet filter systems do avoid the cost and environmental waste of needing new bag for every filling, like wet/dry and shampooing machines they do generally require a very small amount of anti foaming agent, though this is generally environmentally benign. Some Hypoallergenic vacuum bags differ a great deal from non-hypoallergenic bags. Hypoallergenic bags often come in two pieces, an inner and outer bag. The inner bag (which captures the dirt) will be disposable and completely contained. Outer bags will sometimes take the place of a filter all together filtering out dust and allergens out of the air. Some modern hypoallergenic vacuum cleaners will use the two bag system with the outer bag made up of high-performance filtration material treated with antimicrobials to impede the growth of mold, bacteria and other parasites. A two bag system will still require a final HEPA filter to be able to comply with the standards of HEPA filtration. All good <b>Hypo-allergenic</b> systems are designed, not just to contain 99+% of containments (99.97% in the case of HEPA systems), but to clean the air while cleaning the floors, some, including water filter models, achieving retention of particles over 0.3 micrometer diameter of 99.99% (1 particle in 10,000 released).|$|E

Levels of Mal d 1 gene silencing were measured repeatedly by quantitative real-time PCR. Compared to leaf samples from wild-type ‘Elstar’, two GM lines showed modest levels of gene silencing (up to 250 -fold), whereas the other eight GM lines were significantly silenced (up to 10, 000 -fold) in Mal d 1 gene expression.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Allergen-specific {{immunotherapy}} {{for food}} allergy has been hindered by severe side-effects in the past. Well-characterized <b>hypo-allergenic</b> recombinant food allergens potentially offer a safe solution. OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate hypo-allergenicity of a mutated major food allergen from apple, Mal d 1, in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: A mutant {{of the major}} apple allergen, Mal d 1, was obtained by site-directed mutagenesis exchanging five amino acid residues. Fourteen patients with combined birch pollen-related apple allergy {{were included in the}} study. Hypo-allergenicity of the mutant rMal d 1 (rMal d 1 mut) compared with rMal d 1 was assessed by in vitro methods, i. e. RAST (inhibition), immunoblotting and basophil histamine release (BHR) and in vivo by skin prick test and double-blind placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC). RESULTS: RAST analysis (n = 14) revealed that IgE reactivity to rMal d 1 mut was twofold lower than that of the wild-type molecule (95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 7 - 2. 4). RAST inhibition (n = 6) showed a 7. 8 -fold decrease in IgE-binding potency (95 % CI: 3. 0 - 12. 6). In contrast to this moderate decrease in IgE-binding potency, the biological activity of rMal d 1 mut assessed by SPT and BHR decreased 10 - 200 -fold. Hypo-allergenicity was confirmed by DBPCFC (n = 2) with both recombinant molecules. CONCLUSION: A moderate decrease in IgE-binding potency translates into a potent inhibition of biological activity. This is the first study that confirms by DBPCFC that a mutated recombinant major food allergen is clinically <b>hypo-allergenic.</b> This paves the way towards safer immunotherapy for the treatment of food-allergic patient...|$|E

40|$|Polyurethane foam is the world’s {{most popular}} {{cushioning}} product {{for a wide}} variety of applications. Although it has many properties that are desirable, there are also serious problems associated with foam’s ubiquity. Polyurethane foam is highly flammable, and therefore flame retardants must be added to the material to lessen its potential danger. While these additives do slightly reduce the fire hazard that foam presents, they pose a number of health and environmental problems. Also, polyurethane foam is greatly limited in its potential recyclability. To address the drawbacks of polyurethane foam while still offering the bulk of foam’s desirable properties, Indratech LLC has introduced a polyester-based material known as “Performance Fiber. ” Performance Fiber meets many of the cushioning standards that could formerly only be met by foam, while also being fire resistant, <b>hypo-allergenic,</b> and highly recyclable. In bringing Performance Fiber to market, Indratech faces challenges outside the normal scope of entrepreneurial competition. Since polyurethane foam is subject to a great deal of regulation, the very same regulations that are intended to limit foam’s negative consequences actually work to block Performance Fiber’s entrance into the market in some situations, and in effect these regulations can exacerbate those negative consequences. 1...|$|E
40|$|Children with cows' {{milk protein}} allergy (CMPA) {{are at risk}} of {{insufficient}} length and weight gain, and the nutritional efficacy of <b>hypo-allergenic</b> formulas should be carefully assessed. In 2008, a trial assessed the impact of probiotic supplementation of an extensively hydrolysed casein-based formula (eHCF) on acquisition of tolerance in 119 infants with CMPA.

40|$|More than 25 % of the {{population}} suffer from Type I allergy, an IgE-mediated hypersensitivity disease. Allergens with homology to the major birch (Betula verrucosa) pollen allergen, Bet v 1, belong to the most potent elicitors of IgE-mediated allergies. T 1, a cytokinin-inducible cytoplasmic periwinkle (Catharanthus roseus) protein, with significant sequence similarity {{to members of the}} Bet v 1 plant allergen family, was expressed in Escherichia coli. Recombinant T 1 (rT 1) did not react with IgE antibodies from allergic patients, and failed to induce basophil histamine release and immediate-type skin reactions in Bet v 1 -allergic patients. Antibodies raised against purified rT 1 could be used for in situ localization of natural T 1 by immunogold electron microscopy, but did not cross-react with most of the Bet v 1 -related allergens. CD analysis showed significant differences regarding secondary structure and thermal denaturation behaviour between rT 1 and recombinant Bet v 1, suggesting that these structural differences are responsible for the different allergenicity of the proteins. T 1 represents a non-allergenic member of the Bet v 1 family that may be used to study structural requirements of allergenicity and to engineer <b>hypo-allergenic</b> plants by replacing Bet v 1 -related allergens for primary prevention of allergy...|$|E
40|$|Background: Fruits are a {{major cause}} of food allergy in adults. Lipid {{transfer}} proteins (LTP) are implicated in severe allergic reactions to fruits, but little is known about LTP content in different cultivars. Objective: Determination of the levels of LTP {{in a wide range of}} apple cultivars. Methods: LTP was measured in apples from 53 cultivars grown in Italy and 35 grown in The Netherlands, using three different immunoassays: a competitive ELISA (cELISA), a sandwich ELISA (sELISA) and a RAST inhibition (RI). Selected cultivars were evaluated using the basophil histamine release test (BHR), skin prick test (SPT) and double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC). Results: LTP levels measured with the three immunoassays were significantly correlated, as judged by Pearson's correlation (0. 61 <Rp < 0. 65; p < 0. 0001), but differed with respect to the actual quantities: 3. 4 - 253. 2 (sELISA), 2. 7 - 120. 2 (cELISA) and 0. 4 - 47. 3 µg/g tissue (RI). Between cultivars, LTP titers varied over about a two-log range. Pilot in vitro and in vivo biological testing (BHR, SPT and DBPCFC) with selected cultivars supported the observed differences in LTP levels. Conclusions: Around 100 -fold differences in LTP levels exist between apple cultivars. Whether the lowest observed levels of LTP warrant designation as <b>hypo-allergenic</b> requires more extensive confirmation by oral challenges. Determination of cultivar variation in LTP levels provides important information for growers and consumers. Comparison to earlier reported Mal d 1 levels in the same cultivars reveals that a designation as low allergenic does not always coincide for both allergens...|$|E
40|$|Birch pollinosis {{is often}} {{accompanied}} by adverse reactions to food due to pollen-allergen specific IgE cross-reacting with homologous food allergens. The tertiary structure of Pru av 1, the major cherry (Prunus avium) allergen, for example, is nearly identical with Bet v 1, the major birch (Betula verrucosa) pollen allergen. In order to define cross-reactive IgE epitopes, we generated and analysed mutants of Pru av 1 and Api g 1. 0101, the major celery (Apium graveolens) allergen, by immunoblotting, EAST (enzyme allergosorbent test), CD and NMR spectroscopy. The mutation of Glu 45 to Trp 45 in the P-loop region, a known IgE epitope of Bet v 1, significantly reduced IgE binding to Pru av 1 in a subgroup of cherry-allergic patients. The backbone conformation of Pru av 1 wild-type is conserved in the three-dimensional structure of Pru av 1 Trp 45, demonstrating that the side chain of Glu 45 {{is involved in a}} cross-reactive IgE epitope. Accordingly, for a subgroup of celery-allergic patients, IgE binding to the homologous celery allergen Api g 1. 0101 was enhanced by the mutation of Lys 44 to Glu. The almost complete loss of IgE reactivity to the Pru av 1 Pro 112 mutant is due to disruption of its tertiary structure. Neither the mutation Ala 112 nor deletion of the C-terminal residues 155 - 159 influenced IgE binding to Pru av 1. In conclusion, the structure of the P-loop partially explains the cross-reactivity pattern, and modulation of IgE-binding by site-directed mutagenesis is a promising approach to develop <b>hypo-allergenic</b> variants for patient-tailored specific immunotherapy...|$|E

In this study, the allelic diversity of the seven intron-containing Mal d 1 genes was assessed among a set of apple cultivars by sequencing or indirectly through pedigree genotyping. Protein variant constitutions were subsequently compared with S kin P rick T est (SPT) responses to study the association of deduced protein variants with allergenicity in a set of 14 cultivars. Results From the seven intron-containing Mal d 1 genes investigated, Mal d 1. 01 and Mal d 1. 02 were highly conserved, as nine out of ten cultivars coded for the same protein variant, while only one cultivar coded for a second variant.

40|$|Objective : Biological {{dressings}} like collagen are impermeable to bacteria, {{and create}} the most physiological interface between the wound surface and the environment. Collagen dressings have other advantages over conventional dressings in terms of ease of application and being natural, non-immunogenic, non-pyrogenic, <b>hypo-allergenic,</b> and pain-free. This study aims to compare the efficacy of collagen dressing in treating burn and chronic wounds with that of conventional dressing materials. Materials and Methods : The records of 120 patients with chronic wounds of varied aetiologies and with mean age 43. 7 years were collected and analyzed. The patients had been treated either with collagen or other conventional dressing materials including silver sulfadiazine, nadifloxacin, povidone iodine, or honey (traditional dressing material). Patients with co-morbidities that could grossly affect the wound healing like uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, chronic liver or renal disease, or major nutritional deprivation were not included. For the purpose of comparison the patients {{were divided into two}} groups; &#x 2032;Collagen group&#x 2032; and &#x 2032;Conventional group&#x 2032;, each having 60 patients.

40|$|Cow's milk (CM) {{and related}} {{products}} {{are an important}} source of protein in the diet. Unfortunately, cow's milk proteins (CMPs) can also be allergenic. IgE-mediated cow's milk allergy (CMA) occurs in 1. 5 % of infants, as well as in 0. 3 % of older children and adults. Insight into the immune response towards CMP in CMA, as well as in tolerant individuals, may provide targets for therapeutic strategies. CMP-specific T cells recognize small fragments of CMPs, known as T cell epitopes. T cells from children with CMA and tolerant children were observed to recognize essentially the same T cell epitopes in alfa-s 1 -casein, the most abundant CMP. This indicates that CMA is not caused by differential recognition of selective epitopes. The human leucocyte antigen (HLA) genes determine which CMP fragments are presented to T cells. No major differences were found in allele frequencies of HLA genes between subjects with CMA and tolerant individuals, suggesting that these genes do not contribute significantly to the genetic predisposition underlying CMA. CMP-induced production of interleukin- 10 (IL- 10) by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), as well as plasma levels of CMP-specific IgG 4, were higher in adults sensitized to CM but without CMA, than in non-atopic adults. The upregulation of the immunoregulatory cytokine IL- 10 may be needed to balance the CMP-specific immune response in an atopic environment, and {{may play a role in}} tolerance to CM in sensitized adults without CMA by counter-regulating specific IgE and IgG 4. In line with this hypothesis, it was observed that CMP-specific IgG 4 was also higher in atopic children and adults without CMA or sensitization to CM, as compared to non-atopic individuals. Specific IgG for the causative allergen is higher in CMA than in peanut allergy (PA) and birch bollen allergy (BPA), whereas specific IgE levels are comparable. Allergen-specific IgG in CMA appears to reduce the binding of allergen-Ig complexes to B cells, and may hereby inhibit IgE-facilitated allergen presentation (IgE-FAP) to specific T cells. Feedback enhancement of the specific Th 2 response by IgE-FAP may therefore be less prominent in CMA than in allergies characterized by low specific IgG, such as BPA. Lastly, a possible prophylactic treatment for atopic disease was investigated. A <b>hypo-allergenic</b> whey formula was supplemented with a prebiotic oligosaccharide mixture (GOS/FOS) and fed to infants at risk for development of atopic disease. GOS/FOS supplementation appeared to specifically modulate the immune response towards food antigens, while leaving the response to pathogens intact. The decreased CMP-specific IgG 1 response in treated infants suggests a suppression of the immune response to CMP, which may decrease the risk for development of CMA. The balance between specific IgE and IgG appears to be decisive for the development of CMA or tolerance. Peptides spanning immunodominant sequences in alfa-s 1 -casein and other major CM allergens could be a good candidate for application in tolerance-inducing therapy in CMA. This may induce an immune response comparable to that observed in atopic subjects without CMA, which is characterized by high IL- 10 production by CMP-specific T cells, associated with low specific IgE and high IgG 4...|$|E
