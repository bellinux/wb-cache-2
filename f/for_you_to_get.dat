500|$|Lyrically, {{the female}} protagonists {{challenge}} their male [...] "suitors" [...] {{to keep up}} instead of being full of empty promises; the women further feel that [...] "He's not fulfilling you like he says".

You said you could do this, but you can't, whether that's on the dance floor or wherever else. He said what he could do for you, but..." [...] The lyrics are constructed in the chorus-verse pattern. The song opens with the lines [...] "Hit me" [...] and the first verses sung by Beyoncé follow: [...] "I put it right there made it easy <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> to / Now you want to act like you don't know what to do". The chorus follows during which the group repeatedly sings the lines [...] "Can you keep up?". Rowland's second verses follow where she sings the lines [...] "Put it on me deep in the right direction". The chorus is repeated twice before the bridge by Williams. After the bridge, the group sings the lines [...] "Here's your papers, baby you are dismissed" [...] letting their man know that he is not good enough for them. Rowland sings a short ad lib, and then the trio ends with a repeated chorus. Nick Reynolds from BBC compared the song Missy Elliott's [...] "Pass That Dutch" [...] and to songs by The Supremes. He further found a name check of Public Enemy's [...] "Bring the Noise". Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine also compared [...] "Lose My Breath with [...] "Pass That Dutch".|$|E

The division's commander, Lieutenant General Max Pfeffer, anticipating a long upcoming struggle, joked to a Captain under his command over the latter's reluctance to accept a transfer offer to France, saying [...] "just be happy that you're getting a break. The war will last long enough and be terrible enough <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a good taste of it." [...] On June 10, the division began crossing the Seversky Donets River by assault boat, constructing a bridge for other units, including the 14th Panzer Division.

It was conceived during a studio session week in Miami in early 2003, and was produced as a sequel to [...] "So Gone," [...] another Elliott track. In an interview with MTV News at the 2003 BET Awards, Monica stated that [...] "'Knock Knock' is [...] like a follow-up to 'So Gone,' just saying that, 'All right, we went through all that stuff, now it's time <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> lost.

2500|$|Other secular writers {{questioned}} Yoakum's faith healing practices. [...] As {{early as}} 1903, Yoakum claimed his movement had performed some 800 healings, and the Los Angeles Times described Yoakum as the [...] "leading apostle of the 'faith-healing' movement in this city." [...] However, the Times noted discrepancies in the dates and {{circumstances of the}} [...] "healings" [...] under the headline [...] "Pouring Oil on the Sick ... Stories Don't Jibe." [...] In 1909, the Los Angeles Times published a lengthy article criticizing Yoakum's tactics. [...] The article, titled [...] "No Miracles Without Cash: Services Halt While Money Is Collected," [...] described events {{at one of the}} healing services held at Pisgah Home. [...] The Times opened by quoting the Pisgah Home motto: [...] "God loves a cheerful giver." [...] It then described a [...] "Healing and Testimony of the Healed" [...] service:"Collection boxes were placed on the grounds about the home and in the tabernacle, and an extra large one was on the platform, where Dr. Yoakum and his assistants perform their miracles. [...] A large audience was present, but the sight alone of the collection boxes did not draw the dollars quite fast enough for the doctor, so the testimony service was stopped long enough for him to tell how necessary it is for one to give away all his money before entering the kingdom of heaven. [...] Dr. Yoakum said that he performs such miracles as mentioned in the Bible, but that the one-tenth of a person's income {{for the purposes of the}} Lord was entirely too small, and that every one should give all their money to God's servants, or rather servant. [...] After his talk the large box was placed on the front of the platform with the simple statement that there were several more at hand should one not prove large enough to hold all. [...] This admonition opened the persons of many and soon the space around the platform was crowded with cheerful givers, many of whom looked as though they needed the money at home. ... Dr. Yoakum said: 'If you have a debt to pay, do not hoard your money in trying to pay it and be a tight-wad, but give it for God's work and he will find a way <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> along.'" ...|$|E

5000|$|After {{experiencing}} what {{he described}} as the voice of God calling him from work in his fields, Nayler gave up his possessions and began seeking a spiritual direction, which he found in Quakerism after meeting George Fox in 1652. Nayler became the most prominent of the travelling Quaker evangelists known as the [...] "Valiant Sixty"; he attracted many converts and was considered a skilled theological debater. On several occasions, Fox expressed concern that the ministry of Nayler and his associate Martha Simmonds was becoming over-enthusiastic and erratic. Though the substance of the disagreements is unclear, by 1656 Fox and Nayler were hardly on speaking terms. On 23 September 1656, Fox visited Nayler in his prison at Exeter; when the prisoner refused to kiss his hand, Fox pushed his foot toward him, [...] "It is my foot." [...] It was clearly not a gesture that looked toward reconciliation, Fox never apologised, and the differences remained. Prominent Quaker author, Rufus M. Jones, however, gives a reverse description of the encounter:Nayler tried to make a show of love and would have kissed Fox, but the latter would receive no sham kisses from one whose spirit was plainly wrong. [...] "James," [...] he said, [...] "it will be harder <b>for</b> <b>thee</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> down thy rude company followers than it was <b>for</b> <b>thee</b> <b>to</b> set them up." ...|$|R
