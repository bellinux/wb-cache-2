The arrest set off a chain {{reaction}} of national media attention that changed the general public's view of Reubens and Pee-wee. The arrest postponed Reubens' involvement in major projects until 1999 when he appeared in several big-budget projects including Mystery Men and Blow and started giving interviews as himself rather than as Pee-wee.|$|E

5000|$|Though Tardieu’s {{textbook}} on {{the legal}} medicine of poisoning was the work that did most to establish him as an authority in his time, for the posterity he is most famous for his forensic study of sexual crimes: Etude Médico-Légale sur les Attentats aux Mœurs [...] The study consists of three parts: the first deals with <b>indecent</b> <b>exposures,</b> the second with rape and the third with [...] "pederasty" [...] (sexual relations between an older and a younger man). This third part is considered a classic study {{in the history of}} homosexuality. Written before the term homosexuality was coined, Tardieu sought to identify external signs of committed ”pederasty” which may help the forensic expert present convincing evidence that a crime had been committed to the court of law. In so doing, Tardieu discussed the causes of homosexuality, without making them the main purpose of his study. He presumed some of the ”pederasts” had an inborn inclination, but nevertheless considered the sexual practice in question to be a condemnable vice. According to Tardieu same-sex sexuality was often linked to crime, such as blackmailing and assassinations. The book was an important precursor to Krafft-Ebing’s Psychopathia sexualis, the most famous pre-freudian study on same-sex sexual practices. For the modern reader this work is an important historical document, particularly valuable for the cultural history of sexuality by the glimpses it gives into some of the secret sexual cultures of his time.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} thesis was to explain as widely and openly as {{possible}} what is political spin. To understand different approaches {{to the concept of}} the political spin I have used several authors who have all dealt with the issue. In modern democracies, specially the likes of USA, UK or Australia the phrase spin doctor has become something closely connected with lies, scandals, indecency, moral corruption or the lack of good old decent values. Spin doctors are seen as someone sinister, trying to put together some sort of conspiracy plan to topple the government or create a political scandal. There is no doubt, that most of the spin doctors however are morally and ethically well balanced and do not see scandals or <b>indecent</b> <b>exposures</b> as their primary targets. Their role is to manage and maintain good media relations between their clients (politicians) and the representatives of media. The need for these media communication directors applies on the highest level during the election campaigns. Usually during the campaigns {{there are so many different}} parties, pressure or lobby groups, activists or different candidates all fighting out for their share in the news media or any other political debate. Not only political debate, but prior to elections it is rather common to see politicians acting out in a rather strange manner just to get some publicity in order to swing some of the electorate to gain some more votes. Spin doctor is a phrase that came out from America at 1980 ’s during the Presidential Election campaign. Originally it reflected the media communication director’s efforts to convince representatives of the media, that their clients have got the best ideas and are the best people for the political vacancy or ministerial post. These days the spin-doctors work in large public relations companies where they produce some of the most highly sophisticated and detailed strategies for media management. Some legendary self made spin doctors have made their name as working for the acting President or Prime Minister in power- George Stephanopoulos or Allistar Cample to name few. The aim of this theses was to analyze of how much was political spin and the work of spin doctors to play part in the recent huge success of a political party called Res Publica. The right wing party, which was conducted in December 2000. In 2002 they won pretty much the local elections and in 2003 they triumphed at the General elections in which they gained 28 seats at the Parliament. The largest political party in Estonia, Keskerakond who was predicted to win the elections, gained also 28 seats but Res Publica was announced as a winner because they had loads more possible coalitions partners to form the government. And so they did. For two years in which after the Prime Minister, who was the leader of Res Publica, resigned. When Res Publica formed into a political party, they came on to the scene as someone young, vibrant, exiting, dynamic. They used all the right words and expressions in the book to win the hearts and the minds of the electorate and even some of the media and columnist. This thesis concentrates on how they managed to win the public support with such a short time and how they managed to loose it just as fast. Res Publica used methods, that turned out to be very successful for the short period of time. When they came on to the scene, they stood behind the slogan New Politics. They criticised the government heavily for the lack of moral authority. When the Res Publica was looking for a new leader, a man with a very high moral profile joined the party. Jaanus Parts had long been in charge of the Government Audit’s Office and was known for his criticism towards the ministers for their misuses of public money. When he joined the Res Publica, he very quick became the leader of the party. He had clean resume, had not been in politics, had the trust of the public and the nation. Res Publica conducted their campaigns on some clearly chosen slogans. They avoided detailed discussions of policies. Instead they kept advertising themselves as a new party, which has got the answers. The tactics paid off. However, twice lucky but not the third time. In 2004, prior to the Elections for the European Parliament number of famous people had joined Res Publica because it was seen as a success. One of the newcomer, who had joined was the internationally famed and successful supermodel Carmen Kass. She ran for a seat in European Parliament. Her campaign was heavily conducted by all kinds of different media communication directors and imago gurus, spin doctors to say the least. Her campaign took off and was something that the Estonians where just not ready yet. The campaign was more like a road-show rather than a political campaign in which we saw the young supermodel parachute the skies, visiting the local (RSPCA) home for homeless pets or the shelter for homeless people. The media coverage of her campaign was huge but the public remained sceptical. Res Publica lost its dominance during the European elections 2004. The public was disappointed that there was no real actions behind all the nice slogans and messages com- municated to the public, prior to two previous election campaigns. It remains to be seen whether Res Publica will ever strike back with the same force...|$|R

25|$|Child {{sexual abuse}} {{is a form}} of child abuse in which an adult or older {{adolescent}} abuses a child for sexual stimulation.

25|$|Neither the DSM nor the ICD-10 {{diagnostic}} criteria require actual sexual activity with a prepubescent youth. The diagnosis {{can therefore be}} made based {{on the presence of}} fantasies or sexual urges even if they have never been acted upon. On the other hand, a person who acts upon these urges yet experiences no distress about their fantasies or urges can also qualify for the diagnosis. Acting on sexual urges is not limited to overt sex acts for purposes of this diagnosis, and can sometimes include <b>indecent</b> <b>exposure,</b> voyeuristic or frotteuristic behaviors, or masturbating to child pornography. Often, these behaviors need to be considered in-context with an element of clinical judgment before a diagnosis is made. Likewise, when the patient is in late adolescence, the age difference is not specified in hard numbers and instead requires careful consideration of the situation.|$|E
25|$|In July 1991, {{while visiting}} relatives, Reubens {{was arrested in}} Sarasota, Florida, for masturbating {{publicly}} in an adult theater. Detectives would periodically visit pornographic theaters and observe the audience, arresting those engaged in what these detectives considered <b>indecent</b> <b>exposure.</b> Reubens {{had not been in}} character {{for a year and a}} half, but because CBS was still running reruns of Pee-wee's Playhouse, Reubens' infamous mug shot, which did not depict the clean-cut look Reubens had shown for the last decade, shocked the public, and many thought that the show had been canceled due to the arrest. The arrest was widely covered, and both the character Pee-wee and Reubens became the subject of ridicule. CBS stopped airing Playhouse and Disney-MGM Studios suspended from its studio tour a video that showed Pee-wee explaining how voice-over tracks were made and Toys-R-Us removed Pee-wee toys from its stores. However, his voice work in Disney's Star Tours was not replaced.|$|E

500|$|The Doors had {{achieved}} commercial and critical success by 1969, but {{for much of}} that year, they were blacklisted from radio playlists and their concert bookings dwindled, after singer Jim Morrison {{had been charged with}} profanity and <b>indecent</b> <b>exposure</b> stemming from a concert in Miami, Florida, on March 1. Promoters feared another episode like this. Morrison, who craved recognition as a serious poet and had also begun dabbling in film, had mentioned leaving the group at the end of 1968, only to be convinced by keyboardist Ray Manzarek to stay on another six months. On September 20, 1970, Morrison was convicted for the Miami incident.

Once again bored and single in New York, he thought of moving to Miami to marry a lesbian friend to [...] "have a front and each {{would not be in}} the way of the other". However, he decided to remain in New York, where he secretly pursued gay relationships. In 1962 Milk became involved with Craig Rodwell, who was 10 years younger. Though Milk courted Rodwell ardently, waking him every morning with a call and sending him notes, Milk was uncomfortable with Rodwell's involvement with the New York Mattachine Society, a gay-rights organization. When Rodwell was arrested for walking in Riis Park, and charged with inciting a riot and with <b>indecent</b> <b>exposure</b> (the law required men's swimsuits to extend from above the navel to below the thigh), he spent three days in jail.

In 2003, jurors convicted another man of the 1996 murder of his ex-girlfriend on a Forest Park trail. Less serious crimes have included assault (rarely), car break-ins and petty theft (frequently at trail heads), rare arsons, rare <b>indecent</b> <b>exposure,</b> and marijuana cultivation. Multnomah County Sheriff's deputies in 2007 seized 114mature marijuana plants found growing in the park on a hillside near Portland's Linnton neighborhood.

500|$|By {{the end of}} the leg, {{the band}} members were having trouble {{adjusting}} to their newfound fame as virtually every concert on the tour was sold out and Mother's Milk approached 500,000 units sold. Spin reported that following a show in Atlanta, Flea invited a woman to his hotel room for sexual intercourse, but locked himself in the bathroom upon arriving because all he could think of were his wife and daughter. Kiedis ended a two-year long relationship with actress Ione Skye, and Frusciante, looking back on the tour years later, admitted, [...] "I was totally abusing the situation [...] partying and screwing a bunch of girls. At 19, I might have looked like a stud but I was a weakling inside. I wasn't proud of who I was then." [...] Shortly before {{the end of the}} North American leg, the band filmed a performance at the Long Beach Arena, which was released as Psychedelic Sexfunk Live from Heaven in 1990. A concert at the San Francisco Civic Auditorium on New Year's Eve 1989 attracted over 10,000 attendees and was considered by band photographer Tony Woolliscroft to be [...] "the biggest [...] I had seen them play at that point. It gave me a handle on how hard the band had worked in the USA in the years prior to this." [...] The tour continued in the United Kingdom, where the band was receiving less attention; Kiedis complained after several shows there, [...] "We're huge in the States and it's sort of frustrating and confusing that no one knows who we are here." [...] It was not until after their return from the UK that [...] "Taste the Pain" [...] was released as a single and subsequently charted at number twenty-nine there. In March 1990, the band was asked to perform on MTV's coverage of Spring break in Florida. At the event, Flea and Smith attempted to engage the audience by jumping from the stage; the situation got out of hand, and the two were alleged to have sexually assaulted and verbally abused a female audience member. They were arrested several days later on charges of battery, disorderly conduct and solicitation to commit a lascivious act, but released on $2,000 bail. Smith and Flea's arrest worsened Kiedis' impending charge in Virginia from the [...] "Positive Mental Octopus" [...] tour, for which the vocalist was ultimately convicted of sexual battery and <b>indecent</b> <b>exposure</b> and sentenced to pay a fine of $1,000 per charge.|$|E
