He also made an appearance in the credits, expressing {{a desire to be}} left alone when he <b>is</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> public. Later in 2006, Hanks produced the British film Starter for Ten, a comedy based on working-class students attempting to win on University Challenge.|$|E
25|$|Hanafi: The Hanafi {{school does}} not {{consider}} a woman's face to be awrah; however it is still obligatory (wajib) {{for a woman to}} cover her face. While the Hanafi school has not completely forbidden a male's gaze towards a female's face when there exists absolutely no fear of attraction, the woman has no way of knowing whether the gazes directed towards her are free of desire or not, especially when she <b>is</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> public. The Hanafi school has thus obliged women to cover their faces in front of strangers.|$|E
25|$|There {{are four}} walls to a squash court. The front wall, on which three {{parallel}} lines are marked, {{has the largest}} playing surface, whilst the back wall, which typically contains {{the entrance to the}} court, has the smallest. The out line runs {{along the top of the}} front wall, descending along the side walls to the back wall. There are no other markings on the side or back walls. Shots struck above or touching the out line, on any wall, are out. The bottom line of the front wall marks the top of the 'tin', a half metre-high metal area which if struck means that the ball <b>is</b> <b>out.</b> <b>In</b> this way the tin can be seen as analogous to the net in other racket sports such as tennis. The middle line of the front wall is the service line and is only relevant during serves.|$|E

"Blue Harvest" [...] is the hour-long {{premiere of}} the sixth season of the American {{animated}} television series [...] Family Guy and {{the first part of}} the series' trilogy [...] It originally aired on Fox in the United States on September 23, 2007. The episode is a retelling and parody of the 1977 blockbuster film, Star Wars, recasting the show's characters into Star Wars roles. The plot follows Peter as he retells the story of Star Wars while the electricity <b>is</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> their house.|$|E
500|$|Directed by both Usher {{and music}} video {{director}} Chris Robinson, [...] "My Boo" [...] clip was filmed in New York City. The storyline {{of the video}} {{is a reflection of}} the song's lyrics. The footage starts with Usher in a living room watching a video for [...] "Bad Girl", a song from Confessions. The [...] "Bad Girl" [...] intro features Usher singing the song in a club setting while admiring a scantily-dressed woman. He turns the set off and slumps down on the sofa before laying on it with his foot propped up. After a moment of silent, nostalgic reflection, he begins to sing the intro of [...] "My Boo". The video then shows him and Alicia Keys in their separate quarters, preparing to head out, while singing their part of the song. Usher eventually steps out on streets of New York; likewise, Keys <b>is</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> her car. She leaves the car and walks down the street, and the couple meet up in the middle of Times Square, cuddling each other and on the brink of kissing. The music video debuted on MTV's Total Request Live at number nine on September 16, 2004. It remained on the countdown for twenty-seven days, becoming the only Confession video to chart.|$|E
500|$|Most {{subtropical}} cyclones {{form when}} a deep cold-core extratropical cyclone drops {{down into the}} subtropics. [...] The system becomes blocked by a high latitude ridge, and eventually sheds its frontal boundaries as its source of cool and dry air from the high latitudes diverts away from the system. [...] Temperature differences between the 500hPa pressure level, or [...] above ground level, and the sea surface temperatures initially exceed the dry adiabatic lapse rate, which causes an initial round of thunderstorms to form at a distance east of the center. [...] Due to the initial cold temperatures aloft, sea surface temperatures usually need to reach at least [...] for this initial round of thunderstorms. [...] The initial thunderstorm activity moistens up the environment around the low, which destabilizes the atmosphere by reducing the lapse rate needed for convection. [...] When the next shortwave or upper level jet streak (wind maximum within the jet stream) moves nearby, convection reignites closer to {{the center and the}} system develops into a true subtropical cyclone. [...] The average sea surface temperature that helps lead to subtropical cyclogenesis is [...] If the thunderstorm activity becomes deep and persistent, allowing its initial low level warm core to deepen, tropical cyclogenesis is possible. The locus of formation for North Atlantic subtropical cyclones <b>is</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> the open ocean; the island of Bermuda is regularly impacted by these systems.|$|E

2500|$|By convention, {{dismissal}} {{decisions are}} handled {{primarily by the}} players – thus if the dismissal is obvious the batsman will voluntarily leave the field without the umpire needing to dismiss him. If the batsman and fielding side disagree about a dismissal then the fielding side must appeal to the umpire who will then decide whether the batsman <b>is</b> <b>out.</b> <b>In</b> competitive cricket, many difficult catching and LBW decisions will {{be left to the}} umpire; if a batsman acknowledges that he <b>is</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> such cases and departs without waiting for the umpire's decision it is known as [...] "walking", and regarded as an honourable but controversial act.|$|E

2500|$|Regarding {{most people}} not knowing {{she is the}} actual artist of the artwork, Ward stated: And who am I going to tell that I am behind the artwork? I don’t think most people {{think about all the}} work that happens behind the scenes. And it should be that way. The viewers should be caught up in the show. Anyway, it doesn’t come up much. I do have a niece who thinks it’s pretty cool. And I {{impressed}} a bunch of third-graders at career day at my daughter’s school. But they were much more excited by the work I did for the [...] Go figure...And drawing for [...] was exceptional. It wasn’t just a one-time gig for a movie that <b>is</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> theaters for a couple weeks. It was ongoing and evolving. Although I {{had nothing to do with}} the concepts behind Peyton’s art, and her drawings are a tiny part of the show, I have to admit I have loved hearing that people out there have connected with the artwork. I have received e-mails from [...] fans who say they love to draw and the artwork on the show is really important to them. How cool is that?! ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2013 a {{class action}} lawsuit was filed against Facebook alleging the company scanned user {{messages}} for web links, translating them to “likes” on the user’s Facebook profile. Data lifted from the private messages was then used for targeted advertising, the plaintiffs claimed. [...] "Facebook's practice of scanning the content of these messages violates the federal Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA {{also referred to as}} the Wiretap Act), as well as California's Invasion of Privacy Act (CIPA), and section 17200 of California's Business and Professions Code," [...] the plaintiffs said. This shows that once information is online it is no longer completely private. [...] It is an increasing risk because younger people are having easier internet access than ever before, therefore they put themselves in a position where it is all too easy for them to upload information, but they may not have the caution to consider how difficult it can be to take that information down once it <b>is</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> the open. [...] This is becoming a bigger issue now that so much of society interacts online which was not the case fifteen years ago. [...] In addition, because of the quickly evolving digital media arena, people's interpretation of privacy is evolving as well, and {{it is important to consider}} that when interacting online. [...] New forms of social networking and digital media such as Instagram and Snapchat may call for new guidelines regarding privacy. [...] What makes this difficult is the wide range of opinions surrounding the topic, so it is left mainly up to our judgement to respect other people's online privacy in some circumstances. [...] Sometimes it may be necessary to take extra precautions in situations where somebody else may have a tighter view on privacy ethics. [...] No matter the situation it is beneficial to know about the potential consequences and issues that can come from careless activity on social networks.|$|E
