[...] Chuck responds with, [...] "I'd watch that boy talk, redneck." [...] This is a reference to Blazing Saddles in which the main character says [...] "I'd watch that boy shit, redneck." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Pathetic" [...] {{is a tale}} of [...] "abject self-pity in {{the face}} of {{collapsed}} relationship." [...] The distinctive riff of [...] "Dammit" [...] was created when Hoppus was forced to skip over the missing two strings on an acoustic guitar. The song's themes include maturity and the refrain, [...] "Well I <b>guess</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> growing up." [...] "Dick Lips" [...] was named after an insult bandied around at Big Fish during recording. It was written about DeLonge's experience when he was kicked out of Poway High School for showing up to a basketball game while intoxicated. [...] "Waggy" [...] was a word Hoppus created while belching, prompting him to name the song with it. [...] "Untitled" [...] is inspired by the emerging ska punk scene, and [...] "Emo" [...] by its namesake, which is partly a tribute to DeLonge's favorite band, Jimmy Eat World.|$|E
500|$|Greatest Hits {{opens with}} [...] "Carousel", {{which was the}} very first song Hoppus and DeLonge wrote {{together}} upon their meeting in August 1992. It {{has been described by}} journalist Joe Shooman as [...] "a satisfyingly fast-assed punk song in the vein of NOFX with some very adept dynamic breakdowns." [...] The band's first promotional single, [...] "M+M's", follows, which is based around power chords and Hoppus' lead vocal of a vacation elsewhere. [...] "Dammit", which was the band's first major-label single and also their first radio hit, is themed around maturity and the refrain, [...] "Well I <b>guess</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> growing up." [...] The distinctive riff of [...] "Dammit" [...] was created when Hoppus was forced to skip over the missing two strings on an acoustic guitar. It reached number 11 on Billboard Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart in 1998, and received heavy radio airplay. [...] "Josie" [...] is about [...] "being stoked on a girl." [...] It contains references to the bands Unwritten Law and Dance Hall Crashers ("My girlfriend likes UL and DHC"), two groups the band toured with in the mid-1990s.|$|E

5000|$|... "Undertow" [...] (While {{the band}} decided {{to pass up}} adding this song to their [...] "A Hangover You Don't Deserve" [...] album, it was {{featured}} on the Summerland soundtrack.

500|$|On the October 31, 2007 {{episode of}} the reality show Phenomenon, Paranormalist Jim Callahan {{performed}} a summoning, purportedly of author Raymond Hill, to help discover {{the contents of a}} locked box. [...] Although fellow judge Uri Geller praised the performance, Angel called it [...] "comical" [...] and subsequently challenged both Callahan and Geller to guess the contents of two envelopes he pulled out of his pocket, offering a million dollars of his own money to whoever could do so. This led to an argument between Callahan and Angel, during which Callahan walked toward Angel and called him an [...] "ideological bigot", with the two pulled apart as the show promptly went to a commercial break. Angel has since revealed the contents of one envelope and at the unveiling he challenged Geller one more time. Geller responded, [...] "Although we were born one day apart - I was born on the 20th of December and you on the 19th - a lot of years between us - 40 years, you were one year old when I came out with my spoon bending..." [...] Criss Angel cut him off at this point, saying, [...] "I <b>guess</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> a 'no,'" [...] and proceeded to open the envelope. The envelope contained an index card with the numbers [...] "911" [...] printed on it for September 11, 2001. Angel's explanation was this: [...] "If on 9-10 somebody could have predicted that 9-11 was going to happen, they could have saved thousands of lives". The other envelope's contents were scheduled to be revealed on the first episode of Season 4 of Criss Angel: Mindfreak.|$|E
2500|$|Sherlock {{recorded}} {{an album}} between July 11â€“15, 1994. He played, produced, and mixed everything himself. A person under the pseudonym [...] "Unblack Mark" [...] handled {{the studio and}} recording techniques. As a graphic artist himself, Sherlock created the album's packaging and cover picture. Sherlock marked himself under the pseudonym [...] "Anonymous" [...] in the album's booklet since neither he nor the record company were supposed to reveal his identity. The album was named Hellig Usvart, which is Norwegian for [...] "holy unblack". Sherlock {{said in an interview}} about the name: [...] "I read on the back of an early Dark Throne album, 'Dark Throne play Unholy Black Metal'. Horde was always going to be lyrically the opposite of this, hence: 'Holy Unblack Metal'. I <b>guess</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> how the 'unblack' name or title came about. The music sounded like BM, but because of the lyrics and the spirit behind it, it is not BM." ...|$|E

Jack encounters a Mysterious Man who mocks him {{for trying to}} sell his cow {{for more than a}} [...] "sack of beans" [...] and then vanishes. Little Red Ridinghood meets a hungry Wolf who convinces her to take a detour on her way to Granny's ("Hello, Little Girl"). The Baker sees Little Red Ridinghood in the woods, and when the Witch appears, screaming at him to get the red cape, he is so frightened that he forgets the ingredients he needs. Luckily his wife, who followed him into the forest, reminds him. They are squabbling over her presence when they come across Jack with Milky White. Not having the money necessary to buy the cow, they convince Jack that the beans the Baker has found in his father's old hunting jacket are magic beans and buy the cow for five of them. Jack bids a tearful goodbye to his cow ("I <b>Guess</b> <b>This</b> <b>Is</b> Goodbye"), and the Baker orders his wife to return to the village with the cow. He has qualms about being so dishonest, but his wife reasons that the chance to have a child justifies their trickery ("Maybe They're Magic").|$|E

40|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that using variable and procedure names consisting of whole natural-language words helps program comprehensibility.
