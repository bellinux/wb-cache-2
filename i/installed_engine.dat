The Life StepVan had a novel approach that, while not initially a commercial success, {{appears to be an}} influence in vehicles with the front passengers sitting behind the engine, a large cargo area with a flat roof and a liftgate installed in back, and utilizing a transversely <b>installed</b> <b>engine</b> with a front-wheel-drive powertrain.|$|E
25|$|June 20, 1992: The {{pilot of}} a Piper J3C-65 Cub, {{registration}} number N3128M, reported trouble {{and attempted to}} return to Addison Airport soon after taking off to test a newly <b>installed</b> <b>engine.</b> While turning to line up with the runway, the airplane suddenly lost altitude, rolled upside down, and crashed {{in the middle of}} nearby Beltway Drive, killing the pilot and his passenger. The crash was attributed to breakage of the left-hand elevator control tube due to corrosion.|$|E
25|$|Airbus Chief Strategy Officer Marwan Lahoud {{confirmed}} on 29 May that incorrectly <b>installed</b> <b>engine</b> control software {{caused the}} fatal crash. “The black boxes attest to {{that there are}} no structural defects , but we have a serious quality problem in the final assembly.” Two days earlier, Airbus CEO Tom Enders criticized Spanish agencies for withholding the flight recorder data. “We {{would like to see the}} data and compare it with our hypothesis and proceed quickly to understand the causes of accident, so our aircraft can get back into the air,” he told shareholders at the company’s annual general meeting in Amsterdam on May 27.|$|E

2500|$|On 18 September 2015, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) said {{beginning}} in 2008 the automaker improperly <b>installed</b> <b>engine</b> control unit (ECU) software {{determined to be}} a [...] "defeat device", {{in violation of the}} Clean Air Act to circumvent environmental regulations of NOx emissions by diesel engine 2009-2015 model year Volkswagen and Audi cars. The software detects when the cars were being subject to emissions testing, and then fully enabled ECU emission controls to successfully pass. However, during normal driving conditions, emission control software was shut off in order to attain greater fuel economy and additional power, resulting in as much as 40 times more pollution than allowed by law. Consumer Reports tested a 2011 Jetta SportWagen TDI and found in emissions mode its 0-60mph time increased by 0.6 seconds and its highway fuel economy dropped from 50 mpg to 46 mpg. Volkswagen admitted to using the defeat device, and has been ordered to recall approximately 482,000 cars with four-cylinder 2.0-liter TDI engines. United States federal penalties may include fines ranging up to US$18billion, and possibly criminal charges. On June 28, 2016, Volkswagen agreed to pay a settlement of $15.3 billion, the largest auto-related consumer class-action lawsuit in the United States history.|$|E
