5|$|In April 1849, the Ipswich Express and Lloyd's Weekly Newspaper {{reported}} on a case in a village near to Rayleigh in which a <b>girl</b> <b>had</b> been afflicted with fits. Her family believed that a witch was to blame, with Murrell being called in to free her of the perceived bewitchment. He commissioned the local blacksmith to create an iron witch bottle, into which he placed toe-nail clippings and locks of hair belonging to the putative victim. The bottle was then placed into the hearth and heated until it exploded, with this supposedly defeating the witch's machinations.|$|E

5|$|In 1996, the {{military}} rulers in Burma undertook renovation {{work on the}} Mahamuni Pagoda. During this period, the Mahamuni Buddha image was damaged in 1997 when a hole appeared {{in the belly of}} the Great Image. It was believed that thieves had drilled the hole in an attempt to steal jewels believed to be secreted within the image. It was reported that a military officer had requested to open the temple in the night, resulting in a meeting of all the senior monks from major monasteries in the area to discuss the matter. Whilst the meeting was in progress, attention was diverted to a purported rape incident committed by a Muslim man on a Buddhist girl. A major riot broke out but it turned out afterward that the Buddhist <b>girl</b> <b>had</b> not been raped at all. It was a coverup to divert attention away from the Buddha so it could be repaired. However, the mystery remains as to whether any jewellery did exist and was actually removed from the Great Image at all.|$|E

5|$|With {{incumbent}} U.S. Representative Bill Delahunt {{choosing to}} retire, Keating declared his candidacy in the 2010 congressional election. In order {{to run for}} Delahunt's 10th district seat, Keating moved from his longtime home in Sharon (located in the neighboring 4th district) to a rental property in Quincy. On September 14, he won the Democratic primary against state senator Robert O'Leary. Keating faced Republican state Representative Jeff Perry in the general election. In {{the wake of the}} Tea Party movement and the election of Republican U.S. Senator Scott Brown, the campaign was unusually close for a modern Massachusetts race, which would normally skew heavily Democratic. The Keating campaign largely focused on a 1991 incident during Perry's tenure as a police sergeant, in which a teenage <b>girl</b> <b>had</b> been illegally strip-searched by another officer while Perry was on the scene. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee ran a widely aired advertisement highlighting the incident and challenging Perry's character. With 47 percent of the vote, Keating defeated Perry (42 percent) and two independents in the November 2 election.|$|E

The <b>girl</b> <b>has</b> character, and that's saying {{a good deal about}} a woman, especially a <b>girl.</b> She <b>has</b> departed widely from the conventional type without losing essential womanliness." ...|$|R

25|$|To obtain {{entry into}} the order, a <b>girl</b> <b>had</b> {{to be free of}} {{physical}} and mental defects, have two living parents and be a daughter of a free-born resident of Rome. From at least the mid-Republican era, the pontifex maximus chose Vestals between their sixth and tenth year, by lot from a group of twenty high-born candidates at a gathering of their families and other Roman citizens. Originally, the <b>girl</b> <b>had</b> to be of patrician birth, but membership was opened to plebeians as it became difficult to find patricians willing to commit their daughters to 30 years as a Vestal, and then ultimately even from the daughters of freedmen for the same reason.|$|E

They {{have been}} known to seek the society of girls in general, of any girl, because some <b>girl</b> <b>has</b> made them happy; and when some <b>girl</b> <b>has</b> made them unhappy, they are still more susceptible. Burnamy may be merely amusing himself, or he may be consoling himself; but in either case I think the pivotal <b>girl</b> <b>has</b> as much right to him as Miss Triscoe.

25|$|Numerous {{pieces of}} {{evidence}} linked Chikatilo to Zakotnova's murder: spots of blood {{had been found in}} the snow near the house Chikatilo had purchased; neighbours had noted that Chikatilo had been present in the house on the evening of 22 December; Zakotnova's school rucksack had been found upon the opposite bank of the river {{at the end of the}} street (indicating the <b>girl</b> <b>had</b> been thrown into the river at this location); and a witness had given police a detailed description of a man closely resembling Chikatilo, whom she had seen talking with Zakotnova at the bus stop where the <b>girl</b> <b>had</b> last been seen alive. Despite these facts, a 25-year-old labourer named Aleksandr Kravchenko who, as a teenager, had served a prison sentence for the rape and murder of a teenage girl, was arrested for the crime. A search of Kravchenko's home revealed spots of blood on his wife's jumper: the blood type was determined to match both Zakotnova and Kravchenko's wife.|$|E
