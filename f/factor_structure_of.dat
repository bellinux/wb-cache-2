40|$|The {{variability}} of health complaints within individuals across time {{has rarely been}} studied, and the question whether between- and within-person <b>factor</b> <b>structures</b> <b>of</b> health-related variables are equivalent has not been tested so far. We examined self-reported health complaints in 101 younger (20 - 31 years) and 103 older adults (65 - 80 years) {{over a period of}} 100 daily assessments. Data were analyzed with confirmatory two-level <b>factor</b> analysis. One-factor <b>structures</b> <b>of</b> health complaints provided an acceptable fit at the between- and average within-person levels in both age groups, supporting the assumption of equivalent average within- and between-person <b>factor</b> <b>structures</b> for health complaints. Age differences in loading patterns indicated that subjective health may be experienced differently by younger and older adults. Small age differences in mean levels of health symptoms were observed. Intraindividual variability in health complaints was reliable. Older adults fluctuated less from day to day than younger adults, presumably reflecting less fluctuation in objective health, differences in response styles, situational influences, or habituation processes. We conclude that future research should consider intraindividual variability as being descriptive of a person's health status, and take possible differences between within-and between-person <b>factor</b> <b>structures</b> <b>of</b> subjective health into account...|$|R

40|$|Teleworking {{was defined}} in terms of comprehension: root definition, {{conceptual}} definition and abstraction definition. The definitions were subsequently modelled in terms of four theories: socio-factors of teleworking (model 1 of 4), maturity model of teleworking (model 2 of 4), technical factors of teleworking (model 3 of 4) and taxonomy of teleworking (model 4 of 4). The modelling of the definitions of teleworking as stated adds further comprehension to the concept of teleworking. Teleworking is a socio and technical working practice and so, the research study turned to the socio aspect: {{there were a number of}} socio-factors (minor and major) identified as per existing literature. Subsequently, major socio-factors were mapped to a teleworking maturity model in terms of layers, resource, policy and connectivity. The technical aspect of the research study was able to identify and divide factors into dimensions, attributes and organisational roles. The three models (socio, technical and maturity) were brought together in terms of taxonomy of teleworking: an amalgamation of the socio and technical factors of teleworking in addition to three layers of a maturity model. The research methodology followed a positivist viewpoint with socio-factors measured using 7 -point Likert scales. There were a large number of measures for socio-teleworking and so two research methods were adopted to reduce the number to a manageable amount namely: initial questionnaire design and Q-sort study. Following exclusions, a web-based survey was created with the remaining socio-measures of teleworking. The web-based survey was conducted in terms of a pilot study (at councils in the north of England) before surveying 264 employees at Council-Z (the primary study). Data collected from Council-Z was analysed in terms of confirmatory factor analysis. Theoretical models (<b>factor</b> <b>structures)</b> were created in terms of resource, policy and connectivity. The <b>factor</b> <b>structures</b> <b>of</b> each stated layer were tested for consistency to data. Four <b>factor</b> <b>structures</b> <b>of</b> resource were identified, A, B, C and D. <b>Factor</b> <b>structure</b> D showed the highest level of convergence of theory to observed data that is, the best-fitting model. Six <b>factor</b> <b>structures</b> <b>of</b> policy were identified, with <b>factor</b> <b>structure</b> C 2 the most favourable in terms of exclusion of ambiguities and model-fit statistics. Three <b>factor</b> <b>structures</b> <b>of</b> connectivity were identified and for each of the absolute and incremental fit statistics <b>factor</b> <b>structure</b> B was consistently within the cut-off values for good model-fit, <b>factor</b> <b>structure</b> B was also the best fitting model. In terms of the utility of the study, definitions of teleworking and the modelling of the definitions have improved understanding of the research area. The extensive number of factors of teleworking identified through the theoretical modelling process and the measurements of these have demonstrated improved measurement techniques. The best-fitting models as per the confirmatory factor analyses have broad applicability to other similar organisations, and finally the data from the three best-fitting models can be utilised by Council-Z to introduce informed teleworking initiatives. In terms of limitations and future work, technical factors were out of scope in this research study. Hence, types of teleworking practices linked to technical factors of teleworking would be future work as would studies of the linkage between the socio-and technical factors. In terms of the taxonomical model empirical validation would be sought of each of the seven major socio-factors in terms <b>of</b> <b>factor</b> <b>structures.</b> This study empirically tested for each of the three layers of the maturity model, as opposed to each of the major socio-factors within the three layers. Furthermore, additional factors may be identifiable through future work, adding to the taxonomy and in turn, the comprehension of teleworking would be enhanced alongside further standardisation of teleworking definitions and measurements...|$|R
30|$|Given {{that there}} is an {{increase}} in the use of computers in speaking assessments, it is necessary to better understand how the mode of computer delivery affects speaking assessments.

Indeed, professional testing standards (AERA et al. 1999) have underscored that score equivalence is significant and should be established prior to the interpretation of computerized test scores. Furthermore, exploring how the underlying <b>factor</b> <b>structures</b> vary between the two modes will provide valuable insight into the interpretation of test scores on computer-delivered speaking tests.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The Nijmegen Professionalism Scale, an {{instrument}} for assessing professional behaviour of general practitioner (GP) trainees, consists of four domains: professional behaviour towards patients, other professionals, society and oneself. The purpose of the instrument is to provide formative feedback. AIM: The {{aim of this study}} was to examine the psychometric properties of the Nijmegen Professionalism Scale. METHODS: Both GP trainers and their GP trainees participated. Factor analysis was conducted for each domain. <b>Factor</b> <b>structures</b> <b>of</b> trainee and trainer groups were compared. Measure of congruence used was Tucker's phi. Cronbach's alpha was used to establish reliability. RESULTS: <b>Factor</b> <b>structures</b> <b>of</b> the instrument used by GP trainers and trainees were similar. Two factors for each domain were found: domain 1, Respecting patient's interests and Professional distance; domain 2, Collaboration skills and Management skills; domain 3, Responsibility and Quality management; and domain 4, Reflection and learning and Dealing with emotions. Congruence measures were substantial (> 0. 90). Reliability ranged from 0. 78 to 0. 95. CONCLUSION: This study to validate the instrument represents one further step. To construct a sound validity argument, a much broader range of evidence is required. Nevertheless, this study shows that the Nijmegen Professionalism Scale is a reliable tool for assessing professional behaviour...|$|R
