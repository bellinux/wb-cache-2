40|$|Background: Vascular anomalies, {{classified}} as hemangiomas and arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), were analyzed {{for the presence}} of mast cells. Hemangiomas in the proliferative phase contained large numbers of mast cells (53. 12 ± 27. 83 cells/mm 2) in comparison with hemangiomas in the <b>involuting</b> phase (11. 43 ± 7. 9 cells/mm 2), and AVM (25. 31 ± 27. 3 cells/mm 2). Considering the fact that hemangiomas are characterized by endothelial proliferation and increased numbers of mast cells, these data raise the possibility that mast cells may have {{an important role in the}} formation and/or maintenance of these lesions. Aim: This study aimed at evaluation of presence of mast cells in hemangiomas proliferating, <b>involuting</b> ones and AVMs. Methods: A total of 120 cases of benign vascular lesions were retrieved from 12 years period. A total of 94 cases, where complete clinical details and representative paraffin sections were available, were included in this study. Hematoxylin and eosin (H and E) stain and Mast cell density in all lesions was calculated from toluidine blue stained sections. Results: Mean mast cell density was significantly higher in proliferating hemangiomas (53. 12 ± 27. 83 cells/mm 2) compared to <b>involuting</b> hemangiomas (11. 43 ± 7. 9 cells/mm 2) and AVM (25. 31 ± 27. 3 cells/mm 2) Conclusions: The significantly higher mast cell density seen in proliferating hemangiomas compared with <b>involuting</b> ones, seem to suggest that mast cells play an important role in the natural history of these lesions. *Corresponding author...|$|R

25|$|This system {{depended}} {{primarily on}} the visibility of the central disc, whether it was open centred or whether only ray florets were apparent centrally (double bloom). The double bloom cultivars were then subdivided according {{to the way in}} which they were folded along their longitudinal axis, flat, <b>involute</b> (curled inwards) or revolute (curling backwards). If the end of the ray floret was split, they were considered fimbriated. Based on these characteristics, nine groups were defined plua a tenth miscellaneous group for any cultivars not fitting the above characteristics. Fimbriated dahlias were added in 2004, and two further groups (Single and Double orchid) in 2007. The last group to be added, Peony, first appeared in 2012.|$|E

40|$|In basal conditions, thyroid {{epithelial}} cells produce moderate amounts of {{reactive oxygen species}} (ROS) that are physiologically required for thyroid hormone synthesis. They are not necessarily toxic because they are continuously detoxified either {{in the process of}} hormone synthesis or by endogenous antioxidant systems. Using a rat model of goiter formation and iodine-induced involution, we found that compared with control thyroids, the oxidative stress, assessed by the detection of 4 -hydroxynonenal, was strongly enhanced both in hyperplastic and <b>involuting</b> glands. The level of antioxidant defenses (glutathione peroxidases and peroxiredoxins) was also up-regulated in both groups, although somewhat less in the latter. Of note, increased oxidative stress came along with an inflammatory reaction, but only in <b>involuting</b> glands, suggesting that although antioxidant systems can adequately buffer a heavy load of ROS in goiter, it is not necessarily the case in <b>involuting</b> glands. The effects of 15 -deoxy-Delta(12, 14) -prostaglandin J 2 (15 dPGJ 2), an endogenous ligand of peroxisome proliferated-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) with antiinflammatory properties, were then investigated in <b>involuting</b> glands. This drug strongly reduced both 4 -hydroxynonenal staining and the inflammatory reaction, indicating that it can block iodine-induced cytotoxicity. When experiments were carried out with the PPARgamma antagonist, bisphenol A diglycidyl ether, 15 dPGJ 2 -induced effects remained unchanged, suggesting that these effects were not mediated by PPARgamma. In conclusion, thyroid {{epithelial cells}} are well adapted to endogenously produced ROS in basal and goitrous conditions. In iodine-induced goiter involution, the increased oxidative stress is accompanied by inflammation that can be blocked by 15 dPGJ 2 through PPARgamma-independent protective effects...|$|R

500|$|In prepubertal girls, the {{functional}} squamocolumnar junction is present just within the cervical canal. Upon entering puberty, due to hormonal influence, and during pregnancy, the columnar epithelium extends outwards over the ectocervix as the cervix everts. Hence, this also causes the squamocolumnar junction to move outwards onto the vaginal {{portion of the}} cervix, where it is exposed to the acidic vaginal environment. [...] The exposed columnar epithelium can undergo physiological metaplasia and change to tougher metaplastic squamous epithelium in days or weeks, which {{is very similar to}} the original squamous epithelium when mature. The new squamocolumnar junction is therefore internal to the original squamocolumnar junction, and the zone of unstable epithelium between the two junctions is called the transformation zone of the cervix. After menopause, the uterine structures <b>involute</b> and {{the functional}} squamocolumnar junction moves into the cervical canal.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Infantile {{hemangioma}} (IH) is {{a benign}} vascular tumor that gradually shrinks over several years. <b>Involuting</b> or involuted IHs usually retain their shape, however, {{and result in}} redundant skin or conspicuous scarring due to ulceration in the proliferating phase. We present a case series of 12 patients who underwent in-tralesional excision and primary closure for treatment of <b>involuting</b> or involuted IH. Methods: Twelve patients (5 boys, 7 girls) underwent our treatment method for in-voluting or involuted IH. A blinded assessor evaluated clinical result of each patient.
