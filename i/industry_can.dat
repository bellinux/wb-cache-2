5|$|During the 19th century salt {{evaporation}} ponds were dug in tidal marshes {{around the}} bay, producing salt for condiments {{and to be}} used as a preservative for meats. Today, due to the bay's location, east of Goose Island State Park and west of the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge, very little <b>industry</b> <b>can</b> be found. No industrial plants are located on the bay's shore, but a few gas and oil wells are present. The Continental Oil Company is allowed to obtain oil and gas from the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge as part of the purchase of St. Charles Ranch. Goose Island offers a few piers and campgrounds facing the bay, which encourage tourism. The privately owned St. Charles Bay Hunting Club is also found in this area, and allows hunting, boating and fishing on the bay, while striving to protect the ecosystem. The lack of coastal winds also attracts tourists interested in kayaking and wadefishing, however, boating is hindered by the general shallowness of the bay and the abundance of oyster reefs. Shellfish production is approved throughout the bay, but shrimping is prohibited due to the classification of St. Charles Bay as a nursery bay.|$|E

25|$|Beet sugar {{comes from}} regions with cooler climates: {{northwest}} and eastern Europe, northern Japan, plus some {{areas in the}} United States (including California). In the northern hemisphere, the beet-growing season ends with the start of harvesting around September. Harvesting and processing continues until March in some cases. The availability of processing plant capacity and the weather both influence the duration of harvesting and processing– the <b>industry</b> <b>can</b> store harvested beets until processed, but a frost-damaged beet becomes effectively unprocessable.|$|E
25|$|Namibia is {{the only}} country in the Southern Hemisphere culling seals. Although the {{protection}} and the sustainable use of natural resources is part of Namibia's constitution, it claims to conduct the second largest seal harvest in the world, mainly because of the huge amount of fish seals are estimated to consume. While a government-initiated study found seal colonies consume more fish than the entire fishing <b>industry</b> <b>can</b> catch, animal protection society Seal Alert South Africa estimated less than 0.3% losses to commercial fisheries.|$|E
25|$|Critics {{dispute the}} net {{economic}} and environmental benefits of recycling over its costs, and suggest that proponents of recycling often make matters worse and suffer from confirmation bias. Specifically, critics argue that the costs and energy used in collection and transportation detract from (and outweigh) the costs and energy saved in the production process; also that the jobs produced by the recycling <b>industry</b> <b>can</b> be a poor trade for the jobs lost in logging, mining, and other industries associated with production; and that materials such as paper pulp can only be recycled a few times before material degradation prevents further recycling.|$|E

30|$|By {{investigating}} into {{input-output tables}} {{of the four}} periods from 1997 to 2010, the relationship between logistics industry and related <b>industries</b> <b>can</b> be analyzed. The trend of the development degree of logistics industry and its correlation degree with relative <b>industries</b> <b>can</b> be seen. Thus the theoretical basis for scientific judgment on logistics industry’s status and its influence on national economy is provided. By calculating the direct consumption coefficient of each industry’s sector against logistics and the direct consumption coefficients of the logistics industry against various sectors, and middle demand rate as well as middle input rate, {{the author of this}} thesis gains the following conclusions.|$|R

25|$|Some early {{examples}} of computer markup languages available outside the publishing <b>industry</b> <b>can</b> {{be found in}} typesetting tools on Unix systems such as troff and nroff. In these systems, formatting commands were inserted into the document text so that typesetting software could format the text according to the editor's specifications. It was a trial and error iterative process to get a document printed correctly. Availability of WYSIWYG ("what {{you see is what}} you get") publishing software supplanted much use of these languages among casual users, though serious publishing work still uses markup to specify the non-visual structure of texts, and WYSIWYG editors now usually save documents in a markup-language-based format.|$|E
25|$|In {{the human}} {{environment}}, biofilms can grow in showers very easily since {{they provide a}} moist and warm environment for the biofilm to thrive. Biofilms can form inside water and sewage pipes and cause clogging and corrosion. Biofilms on floors and counters can make sanitation difficult in food preparation areas. Biofilm in soil can cause bioclogging. Biofilms in cooling- or heating-water systems are known to reduce heat transfer. Biofilms in marine engineering systems, such as pipelines of the offshore oil and gas <b>industry,</b> <b>can</b> lead to substantial corrosion problems. Corrosion is mainly due to abiotic factors; however, at least 20% of corrosion is caused by microorganisms that {{are attached to the}} metal subsurface (i.e., microbially influenced corrosion).|$|E
25|$|The cathedral {{is filled}} with {{beautiful}} stained glass. Much of the original glass was broken during the Civil War and most now dates from the 18th century onwards. St Margaret's Chapel contains the only known fragment of medieval stained glass in the cathedral, a beautiful roundel of the Madonna feeding the Christ Child. More-modern stained glass works such as in St. George’s Chapel were erected in honour of two of Tyneside’s late 19th-/early 20th-century industrial pioneers, who both died in 1931 within weeks of each other. Other references to <b>industry</b> <b>can</b> {{be found in the}} cathedral's stained glass, including in the Charles Parsons' window, which features Turbinia, the first turbine-driven steam yacht, with which Parsons astonished the Queen’s Navy at the Spithead naval review in 1897.|$|E
