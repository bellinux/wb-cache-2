2500|$|Many {{substances}} dissolve congruently; i.e., {{the composition}} of the solid and the dissolved solute stoichiometrically match. However, some substances may dissolve incongruently, whereby {{the composition of}} the solute in solution does not match that of the solid. This solubilization is accompanied by alteration of the [...] "primary solid" [...] and possibly formation of a secondary solid phase. However, in general, some primary solid also remains and a complex solubility equilibrium establishes. For example, dissolution of albite may result in formation of <b>gibbsite.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The basaltic laterites of Northern Ireland {{were formed}} by {{extensive}} chemical weathering of basalts {{during a period}} of volcanic activity. They reach a maximum thickness of [...] and once provided a major source of iron and aluminium ore. Percolating waters caused degradation of the parent basalt and preferential precipitation by acidic water through the lattice left the iron and aluminium ores. Primary olivine, plagioclase feldspar and augite were successively broken down and replaced by a mineral assemblage consisting of hematite, <b>gibbsite,</b> goethite, anatase, halloysite and kaolinite.|$|E
2500|$|Bauxite ore is {{the main}} source for aluminium. Bauxite is a variety of {{laterite}} (residual sedimentary rock), so it has no precise chemical formula. It is composed mainly of hydrated alumina minerals such as <b>gibbsite</b> [...] in newer tropical deposits; in older subtropical, temperate deposits the major minerals are boehmite [...] and some diaspore [...] The average chemical composition of bauxite, by weight, is 45 to 60% Al2O3 and 20 to 30% Fe2O3. The remaining weight consists of silicas (quartz, chalcedony and kaolinite), carbonates (calcite, magnesite and dolomite), titanium dioxide and water. Bauxites of economical interest must be low in kaolinite. Formation of lateritic bauxites occurs worldwide in the 145- to 2-million-year-old Cretaceous and Tertiary coastal plains. The bauxites form elongate belts, sometimes hundreds of kilometers long, parallel to Lower Tertiary shorelines in India and South America; their distribution {{is not related to}} a particular mineralogical composition of the parent rock. Many high-level bauxites are formed in coastal plains which were subsequently uplifted to their present altitude.|$|E
2500|$|Oxide {{minerals}} {{are divided}} into three categories: simple oxides, hydroxides, and multiple oxides. Simple oxides are characterized by O2− as the main anion and primarily ionic bonding. They can be further subdivided by the ratio of oxygen to the cations. The periclase group consists of minerals with a 1:1 ratio. Oxides with a 2:1 ratio include cuprite (Cu2O) and water ice. Corundum group minerals have a 2:3 ratio, and includes minerals such as corundum (Al2O3), and hematite (Fe2O3). Rutile group minerals have a ratio of 1:2; the eponymous species, rutile (TiO2) is the chief ore of titanium; other examples include cassiterite (SnO2; ore of tin), and pyrolusite (MnO2; ore of manganese). [...] In hydroxides, the dominant anion is the hydroxyl ion, OH−. Bauxites are the chief aluminium ore, and are a heterogeneous mixture of the hydroxide minerals diaspore, <b>gibbsite,</b> and bohmite; they form in areas with a very high rate of chemical weathering (mainly tropical conditions). [...] Finally, multiple oxides are compounds of two metals with oxygen. A major group within this class are the spinels, with a general formula of X2+Y3+2O4. Examples of species include spinel (MgAl2O4), chromite (FeCr2O4), and magnetite (Fe3O4). The latter is readily distinguishable by its strong magnetism, which occurs as it has iron in two oxidation states (Fe2+Fe3+2O4), {{which makes it a}} multiple oxide instead of a single oxide.|$|E
50|$|<b>Gibbsite</b> is {{interesting}} {{for another reason}} because it is often found {{as a part of}} the structure of other minerals. The neutral aluminium hydroxide sheets are found sandwiched between silicate sheets in important clay groups: the illite, kaolinite, and montmorillonite/smectite groups. The individual aluminium hydroxide layers are identical to the individual layers of <b>gibbsite</b> and are referred to as the <b>gibbsite</b> layers.|$|E
50|$|<b>Gibbsite</b> is not {{stable in}} {{presence}} of quartz {{and it will}} be changed into kaolinite minerals, so <b>gibbsite</b> has formed after the deposition and we can call it neo-formation <b>gibbsite.</b> Now, the main question is about <b>gibbsite</b> formation in the middle of kaolin series. Due to the pH of leaching, a dissolution of Al2O3 or SiO2 can occur (podzol or laterite profile) The first theory tries to describe this with podzol profiles: it assumes the leaching of silica from minerals and accordingly the <b>gibbsite</b> formation from leached kaolin. We thus should find the hyper-aluminous materials, containing <b>gibbsite</b> in the lower series of kaolin. On the other hand, a second theory proposes the procedure of aluminium leaching in a very acid medium, in deposited organic materials (lignite) with clay. The organic materials can accelerate the solubilization and transportation of aluminium ions with intervention of organic complex. proposed the following scenarios for this dissolved aluminium.|$|E
50|$|<b>Gibbsite</b> {{has three}} named {{structural}} polymorphs or polytypes: bayerite (designated often as α-Al(OH)3, but sometimes as β-Al(OH)3), doyleite, and nordstrandite. <b>Gibbsite</b> and bayerite are monoclinic, whereas doyleite and nordstrandite are triclinic forms.|$|E

50|$|<b>Gibbsite</b> is {{also known}} as hydrargillite, named after the Greek words for water (hydra) and clay (argylles). The first {{compound}} named hydrargillite was thought to be aluminium hydroxide, but was later found to be aluminium phosphate; despite this, both <b>gibbsite</b> and hydrargillite are used to refer to the same polymorphism of aluminium hydroxide, with <b>gibbsite</b> used most commonly in the United States and hydrargillite used more often in Europe. In 1930, it was referred to as α-alumina trihydrate to contrast it with bayerite, which was called β-alumina trihydrate (the alpha and beta designations were used to differentiate the more- and less-common forms respectively). In 1957, a symposium on alumina nomenclature attempted to develop a universal standard, resulting in <b>gibbsite</b> being designated γ-Al(OH)3, bayerite becoming α-Al(OH)3, and nordstrandite being designated Al(OH)3. Based on their crystallographic properties, a suggested nomenclature and designation is for <b>gibbsite</b> to be α-Al(OH)3, bayerite to be designated β-Al(OH)3, and both nordstrandite and doyleite are designated Al(OH)3. Under this designation, the α and β prefixes refer to hexagonal, close-packed structures and altered or dehydrated polymorphisms respectively, with no differentiation between nordstrandite and doyleite.|$|E

The basic {{structure}} of corundum is identical to <b>gibbsite</b> except the hydroxides are replaced by oxygen. Since oxygen has a charge of -2 the layers are not neutral and require that they must be bonded to other aluminiums above and below the initial layer producing the framework structure that is the structure of corundum.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Gibbsite</b> is an {{important}} ore of aluminium {{in that it is}} one of three main phases that make up the rock bauxite.|$|E
50|$|George Gibbs (January 7, 1777 - August 6, 1834) was an American {{mineralogist}} {{and mineral}} collector. The mineral <b>gibbsite</b> {{is named after}} him.|$|E
50|$|The second {{aspect of}} the {{low-temperature}} synthesis of kaolinite is that the aluminium cations must be hexacoordinated with respect to oxygen (Caillère and Hénin, 1947; Caillère et al., 1953; Hénin and Robichet, 1955). Gastuche et al. (1962), as well as Caillère and Hénin (1962) have concluded, that only in those instances when the aluminium hydroxide {{is in the form}} of <b>gibbsite,</b> kaolinite can ever be formed. If not, the precipitate formed will be a “mixed alumino-silicic gel” (as Millot, 1970, p. 343 put it). If this would be the only requirement, large amounts of kaolinite could be harvested simply by adding <b>gibbsite</b> powder to a silica solution. Undoubtedly a marked degree of sorption of the silica in solution by the <b>gibbsite</b> surfaces will take place, but, as stated before, mere adsorption does not create the layer lattice typical of kaolinite crystals.|$|E
50|$|It {{occurs as}} a {{weathering}} product under acidic conditions associated with pyrite or marcasite decomposition. Associated minerals include hydrobasaluminite, hydroargillite, meta-aluminite, allophane, <b>gibbsite,</b> gypsum and aragonite.|$|E
50|$|This theory alone cannot {{explain what}} is {{observed}} in-situ in the some {{samples of the}} “BD” deposit, where <b>gibbsite</b> was found in sandy layers containing quartz.|$|E
50|$|Lignite {{formations}} {{are relatively}} frequent in Charentes clay deposits. Their thickness changes between some decimeters in lenses, to metric scale in continuous forms. These organic materials had some influences on kaolin deposited layers. Some {{of the observed}} influences are as follow: In gathered samples close to these organic materials, clays generally do not contain mica minerals, {{and especially in the}} neighborhood of Cuisian lignite, kaolinite is very well-ordered and the clay does not contain swelling clays with hydrazine. Occurrence of <b>gibbsite</b> is always associated with these well-ordered kaolinites. Normally occurrence of hyper-aluminous clays due to the existence of <b>gibbsite</b> is one of the interesting subjects in the history of these kaolins. This causes many discussions about the origin of this mineral. The existence of <b>gibbsite</b> has been mentioned in the studies of Languine and Halm (1951), Caillere and Jourdain (1956), Kulbickie (1956), Dubreuilh et al. (1984) and Delineau (1994).|$|E
50|$|The {{lateritic}} bauxites {{are found}} {{mostly in the}} countries of the tropics. They were formed by lateritization of various silicate rocks such as granite, gneiss, basalt, syenite, and shale. In comparison with the iron-rich laterites, the formation of bauxites depends even more on intense weathering conditions in a location with very good drainage. This enables the dissolution of the kaolinite and the precipitation of the <b>gibbsite.</b> Zones with highest aluminium content are frequently located below a ferruginous surface layer. The aluminium hydroxide in the lateritic bauxite deposits is almost exclusively <b>gibbsite.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Gibbsite,</b> Al(OH)3, {{is one of}} {{the mineral}} forms of {{aluminium}} hydroxide. It is often designated as γ-Al(OH)3 (but sometimes as α-Al(OH)3.). It is also sometimes called hydrargillite (or hydrargyllite).|$|E
50|$|<b>Gibbsite</b> has {{a typical}} metal {{hydroxide}} structure with hydrogen bonds. It is built up of double layers of hydroxyl groups with aluminium ions occupying {{two-thirds of the}} octahedral holes between the two layers.|$|E
50|$|The {{process of}} forming nickel {{laterite}} deposits is essentially {{similar to the}} formation of gold laterite deposits, except that ultramafic or mafic rocks are required.
