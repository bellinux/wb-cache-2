5|$|According to Sharaf, 1934–1937 was {{the happiest}} period of Reich's {{personal}} life, despite the professional problems. His relationship with Elsa Lindenberg {{was good and}} he considered marrying her. When she became pregnant in 1935, they were initially overjoyed, buying clothes and <b>furniture</b> <b>for</b> the child, but doubts developed for Reich, who saw the future as too unsettled. To Lindenberg's great distress, Sharaf writes, Reich insisted on an abortion, at that time illegal. They went to Berlin, where the psychoanalyst Edith Jacobson helped to arrange it.|$|E
5|$|Güell's {{first task}} for Gaudí, that same year, was {{the design of}} the <b>furniture</b> <b>for</b> the pantheon chapel of the Palacio de Sobrellano in Comillas, which was then being {{constructed}} by Joan Martorell, Gaudí's teacher, {{at the request of the}} Marquis of Comillas, Güell's father in law. Gaudí designed a chair, a bench and a prayer stool: the chair was upholstered with velvet, finished with two eagles and the Marquis's coat of arms; the bench stands out with the motif of a dragon, designed by Llorenç Matamala; the prayer stool is decorated with plants.|$|E

5|$|Balabushka's {{first job}} {{was as a}} wooden toy {{designer}} and maker, working for the Educational Equipment Company, then located at 71 West 23rd St., in Manhattan, which made building blocks for nurseries and schools. Thereafter he built children's <b>furniture</b> <b>for</b> the Playtime Woodworking Company located on Greenwich Village's Jane Street. While on the job, Balabushka lost his middle finger to a band saw. Using a wooden mold, he made himself a replacement plastic finger of such craftsmanship that even his friends did not realize his loss until long after the incident. As Balabushka's carpentry skills deepened he began building accordions and other detailed carpentry pieces on his own time. In 1949, Balabushka applied for patent on a folding leg bracket mechanism he invented, which was granted in 1951.|$|E
5|$|Douglas {{designed}} some 500 buildings. He {{built at}} least 40new churches or chapels, restored, altered or made additions {{to many other}} churches, and designed fittings and <b>furniture</b> <b>for</b> the interiors of churches. He designed new houses, altered or made additions to others, and built various structures associated with those houses. Douglas's works also included farms, shops, offices, hotels, a hospital, drinking fountains, clocks, schools, public baths, a library, a bridge, an obelisk, cheese factories, and public conveniences. As his office was in Chester, most of his works were in Cheshire and North Wales, although some were further afield, in Lancashire, Staffordshire, Warwickshire and Scotland.|$|E
5|$|Two years later, in 1991, Withers {{bought a}} {{derelict}} rowhouse {{from the city}} of Philadelphia for $1 and parted ways with McKenna. This would become his hermitage. He fixed the building, which lacked doors, windows, or a working roof and then went on to build <b>furniture</b> <b>for</b> it by himself. After the 1983 revision of Canon 603, the option of being a consecrated hermit while independent of the system of religious orders had been permitted. In 1995, Withers attempted to be consecrated by the Archdiocese of Philadelphia but was rejected. In 2001, Withers was finally approved and consecrated as a hermit by Cardinal Anthony Bevilacqua and took his public vows. Withers was the first hermit to be consecrated by the Archdiocese.|$|E

5|$|Morris became {{increasingly}} {{fascinated with the}} idyllic Medievalist depictions of rural life {{which appeared in the}} paintings of the Pre-Raphaelites, and spent large sums of money purchasing such artworks. Burne-Jones shared this interest, but took it further by becoming an apprentice to one of the foremost Pre-Raphaelite painters, Dante Gabriel Rossetti; the three soon became close friends. Through Rossetti, Morris came to associate with poet Robert Browning, and the artists Arthur Hughes, Thomas Woolner, and Ford Madox Brown. Tired of architecture, Morris abandoned his apprenticeship, with Rossetti persuading him to take up painting instead, which he chose to do in the Pre-Raphaelite style. Morris aided Rossetti and Burne-Jones in painting the Arthurian murals at Oxford Union, although his contributions were widely deemed inferior and unskilled compared to those of the others. At Rossetti's recommendation, Morris and Burne-Jones moved in together to the flat at Bloomsbury's No. 17 Red Lion Square by November 1856. Morris designed and commissioned <b>furniture</b> <b>for</b> the flat in a Medieval style, much of which he painted with Arthurian scenes in a direct rejection of mainstream artistic tastes.|$|E
5|$|Smith {{meanwhile}} continued working {{towards the}} A∴A∴ grade of Zelator, while the British Columbia Lodge No. 1 became increasingly moribund {{following the death}} of White, a key member, who had succumbed to Spanish Flu aged 33 in November 1918. Jones had rejoined the O.T.O. and relocated to Detroit in the United States. When Smith was fired from his job following a bout of flu in February 1920, he decided to join Jones in Detroit, where there was a small O.T.O. community; there he gained work as a clerk with the Detroit City Gas Company. In his absence, Nem was appointed Right Worshipful Master of the Vancouver lodge. In March 1921, Jones and Smith proceeded to Chicago, but in June Smith returned to North Vancouver to see his family. That year, Jones convinced Smith to join an esoteric organisation known as the Universal Brotherhood (UB). Smith however was unnerved that rather than expressing a Thelemic viewpoint, the UB adhered to Roman Catholicism, and he also considered its literature purposeless, vague, and grandiose; he soon dropped out. Back in Vancouver, Smith aided one of his initiates, Frank Page, in founding the British Columbia Lodge No. 3 in Kamloops, creating all the <b>furniture</b> <b>for</b> their temple. Nevertheless, the lodge closed after a year, with Smith's own British Columbia Lodge No. 1 also becoming defunct in February 1922.|$|E
