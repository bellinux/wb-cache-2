30|$|In {{the current}} paper, the {{behavior}} of eccentrically loaded column bent in both single and <b>double</b> <b>curvature</b> modes is studied experimentally. In addition, based on the experimental test results, an expression was derived in order to predict the capacity lost due to column end eccentricities. And then, the equivalent column concept is employed in order to switch eccentrically loaded columns bent in either single or <b>double</b> <b>curvature</b> mode to axially loaded pin-ended equivalent columns. The end eccentricity ratio is correlated to the equivalent column length. Finally, a simplified design procedure for eccentrically loaded braced columns is proposed and compared against the design procedure stipulate in the ACI 318 - 14 Code.|$|R

30|$|It can {{be noted}} that the {{equivalent}} column for the case of <b>double</b> <b>curvature</b> mode is lower than that of the single curvature mode. Hence, the slenderness effect of the single curvature mode is higher (H*/b =  30.28), which resulted in a significant decrease in the ultimate capacity as confirmed by the experimental result of such column (S- 3 - 5) where its ultimate capacity was about 33  % of the axial capacity of C- 0 - 0. On the other hand, column bent in <b>double</b> <b>curvature</b> mode has slenderness ratio of 17.02, which resulted in moderate effect on the ultimate capacity. This contact was confirmed by the experimental result where column D- 3 - 5 showed about 56  % of the ultimate capacity of axially loaded column C- 0 - 0.|$|R
50|$|By the {{beginning}} of the Dynastic Period, bows were made of wood. They had a single curvature and were strung with animal sinews or strings made of plant fiber. In the pre-dynastic period, bows often had a <b>double</b> <b>curvature,</b> but during the Old Kingdom a single-arched bow, known as a self (or simple) bow, was adopted. These were used to fire reed arrows fletched with three feathers and tipped with flint or hardwood, and later, bronze. The bow itself was usually between one and two meters in length and made up of a wooden rod, narrowing at either end. Some of the longer self bows were strengthened at certain points by binding the wooden rod with cord. Drawing a single-arched bow was harder and one lost the advantage of draw-length <b>double</b> <b>curvature</b> provided.|$|R

The present study analyzed fluid flow in a helical vessel without {{and with a}} stenosis in comparison with an analogous rectilinear vessel. The analysis is performed by threedimensional numerical simulation of the Navier–Stokes equations under steady conditions considering stenosis as an axially symmetric reduction of vessel lumen. Results show that the <b>double</b> <b>curvature</b> gives rise to persistent secondary motion which combines with the vorticity separated behind the constriction to develop a complex three-dimensional vorticity structure. The curved streamlines and the three-dimensional vortex wake result in a increase of energetic losses in helical vessels. However, the same symmetry break due to the <b>double</b> <b>curvature</b> improves the capacity of self-cleaning and allows a more rapid wash-out of the flowing blood...|$|R
