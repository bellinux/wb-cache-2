60|$|Indeed I {{had little}} {{time to talk with}} Bes about such light matters, since things moved apace in Memphis. Within six days all the great lords left in Upper Egypt were sworn to the revolt under the {{leadership}} of Peroa, and hour by hour their vassals or hired mercenaries flowed into the city. These it was my duty to weld into an army, and at this task I toiled without cease, separating them into regiments and drilling them, also arranging for the arming and victualling of the boats of war. Then news came that Idernes was advancing from Sais with a great force of Easterns, all the garrison of Lower Egypt indeed, as his messengers said, to answer the summons conveyed to him <b>under</b> the <b>private</b> <b>Seal</b> of seals.|$|R

5000|$|In December 1922, {{under the}} Irish Free State (Consequential Provisions) Act 1922 a {{separate}} Great Seal of Northern Ireland was created.

Although the Constitution of the Irish Free State did not mention any seal, the letters patent appointing its first Governor-General mandated its use, with similar interim provision for a <b>private</b> <b>seal.</b> The Great Seal of the Irish Free State was delivered in 1925 to a design agreed by the Executive Council. As in other Dominions of the then British Commonwealth, the Great Seal of the Realm was used for some diplomatic functions. In 1931, a separate [...] "External Great Seal" [...] was struck to replace the Great Seal of the Realm in these functions.

25|$|Provision {{of water}} and {{sanitation}} services in Portugal is a shared responsibility between the 308 municipalities and the national, public holding company Águas de Portugal (AdP) and its subsidiaries. About 73% {{of the population in}} 243 municipalities receives water directly from municipalities (3.5 million people) or single-municipality companies established under public law (2.5 million people). 27% of the population receives water directly from companies established <b>under</b> <b>private</b> law, including 1.7 million from multi-municipal companies majority-owned by Águas de Portugal and 0.9 million from other municipal companies established <b>under</b> <b>private</b> law. Many municipalities do not control their sources of bulk water supply. Companies established <b>under</b> <b>private</b> law, in particular multi-municipal companies co-owned by Águas de Portugal, thus sell water to municipalities, providing water indirectly in bulk to 53% of the population. In addition, as mentioned above, companies established <b>under</b> <b>private</b> law provide water directly to 27% of the population. Thus, a total of about 80% of the population receives water directly or indirectly multi-municipal companies established <b>under</b> <b>private</b> law.|$|R
