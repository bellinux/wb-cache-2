40|$|Abstract Objective The aim of {{this study}} was to compare a {{theoretical}} neural net model with MEG data from epileptic patients and normal individuals. Methods Our experimental study population included 10 epilepsy sufferers and 10 healthy subjects. The recordings were obtained with a one-channel biomagnetometer SQUID in a magnetically shielded room. Results Using the method of x 2 -fitting it was found that the MEG amplitudes in epileptic patients and normal subjects had Poisson and <b>Gauss</b> <b>distributions</b> respectively. The Poisson connectivity derived from the theoretical neural model represents the state of epilepsy, whereas the Gauss connectivity represents normal behavior. The MEG data obtained from epileptic areas had higher amplitudes than the MEG from normal regions and were comparable with the theoretical magnetic fields from Poisson and <b>Gauss</b> <b>distributions.</b> Furthermore, the magnetic field derived from the theoretical model had amplitudes in the same order as the recorded MEG from the 20 participants. Conclusion The approximation of the theoretical neural net model with real MEG data provides information about the structure of the brain function in epileptic and normal states encouraging further studies to be conducted. </p...|$|R

40|$|Statistical {{criteria}} used {{today in the}} analysis of radio signals suspected on reasonable extraterrestrial origin, are {{based on the assumption that}} all the radio signals of natural origin are described by a Gaussian distribution, which is traditionally understood as the <b>Gauss</b> <b>distribution.</b> Usually the normal (<b>Gauss)</b> <b>distribution</b> is opposed to all the others. However, this is difficult to recognize the reasonable, because in nature there are many different distributions. The article offers a more realistic dichotomy: the Gaussian distributions, obeying the central limiting theorem, dominate in nature, while non-Gaussian ones, obeying the Gnedenko-Doeblin limiting theorem, are generated by intelligent beings. When identifying objects belonging to an extraterrestrial civilization described by a non-Gaussian distribution is preferable to use the rank form distributions. Using this criterion is associated with certain difficulties: (1) in nature there are also non-Gaussian distributions; (2) in their activities animals generate non-Gaussian distributions like humans; (3) the identification of non-Gaussian distributions in the rank form is hampered sometimes by the rank distortion effect of mathematical nature...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A non-destroy {{technology}} (NDT), simple pendulum’s model, {{to estimate}} the magneti-zation of the ferrofluid is introduced in this study. For this new testing method, the magnetic fluid, isolated in a closed volume to prevent the test sample from being exposed to ambient en-vironment or interacted with any active medium, is suspended to the massless string to behave a simple harmonic oscillation. Thus the pollution of sample can be completely avoided during the measuring process. By regulating the input DC power voltage, various <b>Gauss</b> <b>distributions</b> of magnetic field are then axially generated along the finite solenoid immediately and then a mag-netic pressure inside the ferro-particles will be induced to counteract its gravity effect. Conse-quently, the oscillating frequency of the simple pendulum will be slightly changed due {{to the loss of}} the apparent acceleration. From the corresponding period detected, the susceptibility of the test sample, 1. 05 ~ 1. 10, will be estimated within the working region of 5 V~ 30 V applied by DC power supply. That is also consistent with the original data, 1. 13 ~ 1. 27, provided by Matsumoto Co. and their relative errors are found to be less than 15 %...|$|R

40|$|The glass-rubber {{transition}} temperature of elastomer bonded composite rocket propellants and high explosives {{is an important}} property determining their in-service application. It {{is defined as the}} main maximum of the loss factor tand, which is determined as function of temperature by DMA (dynamical mechanical analysis) measurements at some forced sinusoidal deformation at lower frequencies in the range of 0. 01 to 100 Hz. With the term transition the center part of the molecular rearrangement process is meant, in which the transition from the energy elastic (‘glassy elastic’) to the entropy elastic (‘rubbery elastic’) behaviour, or vice versa, occurs. The loss factor of an elastomer binder is influenced by several factors: (1) filler type and content, (2) plasticizer type and content, (3) sterical hindrance, (4) interaction forces between all ingredients, (5) polymer chain conformation of the elastomer, (6) curing type and agent. Because the loss factor region of most elastomers filled with rigid particles consists of several sub-transitions, which can change differently during ageing and deformation rate loading, a special modelling of the loss factor curve is presented using so-named exponentially modified <b>Gauss</b> <b>distributions.</b> Therewith a separation and a quantification of the molecular rearrangement regions or binder mobility fractions is achieved, after the application of a suitable baseline correction function to the loss factor curve...|$|R
