5000|$|The primary hazard {{involving}} {{the use of}} overwing exits is passengers not waiting {{to be given the}} command to evacuate, but rather initiating it themselves. While many passengers (especially <b>frequent</b> <b>fliers)</b> would believe that they are adult enough and educated enough to decide that they {{need to get out of}} an aircraft, they are not trained in the specific dangers or the sequence of events required to decide when a full-scale evacuation is needed. Also, passengers will frequently open an exit as soon as evacuation begins which may result in them evacuating into danger. This occurred in the Ryanair engine fire in Stansted Airport in 2002, where passengers evacuated themselves onto a burning wing, despite airport fire services personnel shouting at them to return inside the aircraft and evacuate via a usable exit. Typically, these problems do not occur at floor level, full sized, exit doors because these are operated by flight attendants in an emergency who have extensive emergency training.|$|R
5000|$|Most exit row seats {{provide a}} few more inches of seat pitch {{compared}} to non-exit row seats so that passengers have more space to access the exit. Seats {{in front of an}} exit row {{may not be able to}} recline, which can limit their comfort on longer flights. Nonetheless, airlines have taken advantage of this extra space by reserving exit row seats for <b>frequent</b> <b>fliers</b> or charging fees for booking them. A few airlines have gone to branding exit row seats as a premium economy product - on Virgin America's A320, the exit rows (as well as bulkhead seats) are considered [...] "Main Cabin Select" [...] where meals, alcohol, pay-per-view movies and a higher baggage allowance are all included. Main Cabin Select is sold as a separate class of service between coach and first class, and a restrictive MCS fare tends to be equivalent to a full-fare economy ticket. Similarly, JetBlue uses the exit rows as part of their [...] "Even More Space" [...] section.|$|R

TAT's subsequent launch of three daily return flights between Paris Orly and London Heathrow complemented British Airways' own thrice daily Heathrow-Orly service. This enabled British Airways to circumvent the slot restrictions the slot co-ordinator for the airports in the Paris region had imposed on Orly's non-resident airline users, which limited each of these airlines to holding a maximum of four daily pairs of slots, and to offer up to six daily round-trips on that route.

40|$|A small {{proportion}} of air travelers make disproportionately more journeys {{than the rest of}} travelers. They also tend to interact predominantly with other frequent travelers in hotels and airport lounges. This group has the potential to accelerate global spread of infectious respiratory diseases. Using an epidemiologic model, we simulated exportation of cases from severe acute respiratory syndrome–like and infl uenza-like epidemics in a population for which a {{small proportion}} travel more frequently than the rest. Our simulations show that frequent travelers accelerate international spread of epidemics only if they are infected early in an outbreak and the outbreak does not expand rapidly. If the epidemic growth rate is high, as is likely for pandemic infl uenza, heterogeneities in travel are frequently overwhelmed by the large number of infected persons in the majority population and the resulting high probability that some of these persons will take an international fl ight. In today’s world of increasing air travel for both business and pleasure, a {{small proportion of}} persons make disproportionately more journeys {{than the rest of the}} population (1, 2). These <b>frequent</b> <b>fliers</b> tend to travel for business purposes and mix predominantly with other business travelers, stay in particular hotels, and use specific airport lounges.
