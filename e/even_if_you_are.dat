5|$|The {{only reason}} the Nazis put on {{prisoner}} broadcasts {{is to get}} people justifiably anxious about relatives reported missing at the front {{to listen to their}} propaganda. Although many of the messages undoubtedly are true, they represent but a small fraction of our prisoners and we have no assurance that many of them are not faked from papers picked up on the battlefield. What concerns some of us is the consequences of listening to Nazi broadcasts unless you are a well-trained listener (and often, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>are).</b> Nazi arguments often sound plausible. A person may listen to them with all the skepticism in the world, knowing that every word is a lie. But if the content is sufficiently sensational (and it often is) the source may be forgotten in time, and out pops the Nazi lie, all unsuspecting.|$|E
25|$|The Transfer System on {{the other}} hand, was never popular with the racers. While very {{efficient}} and less error prone than the cumulative method (and allowing the ABA to run much quicker events with fewer finish line scores), the good racers generally did not like it since they would only get to race once, win their transfer moto and wait for hours if the races are big enough to race the mains ({{on the other}} hand you get to relax a little without the anxiety of doing poorly {{in the next two}} qualifying motos). This means the racers race less often in the ABA and the fun of BMX is in the racing, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> losing. Even racers who do not do well did not like the transfer system because the fewer actual races you are in, the less chance you will have to improve your skills in actual race conditions You also race two times less for your money paid for in entrance fees in the ABA in the Transfer system if you win your first moto.|$|E
500|$|Blake {{comments}} that Disraeli [...] "produced an epic poem, unbelievably bad, and a five-act blank verse tragedy, if possible worse. Further {{he wrote a}} discourse on political theory and a political biography, the Life of Lord George Bentinck, which is excellent... remarkably fair and accurate." [...] But it is on his novels that Disraeli's literary achievements are generally judged. They have from the outset divided critical opinion. The writer R. W. Stewart observed that {{there have always been}} two criteria for judging Disraeli's novels—one political and the other artistic. The critic Robert O'Kell, concurring, writes, [...] "It is after all, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> a Tory of the staunchest blue, impossible to make Disraeli into a first-rate novelist. And it is equally impossible, {{no matter how much you}} deplore the extravagances and improprieties of his works, to make him into an insignificant one." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2006, Hoffman {{was named}} to his fifth All-Star game, but was the losing pitcher in the game after having two strikes with two outs to Michael Young, who was later named the All-Star Game Most Valuable Player. His All-Star {{performance}} bothered him, and he suffered two of his five blown saves that year in the week that followed. August 20 marked Hoffman's 776th outing for the Padres, breaking the Pirates Elroy Face's major league record for most relief appearances with one club. On September 24 in the Padres last home game of the year, Hoffman retired eventual 2006 NL batting champion Freddy Sanchez for the final out of a 2–1 win over the Pittsburgh Pirates, keeping the Padres [...] game lead atop the NL West with seven games left to play. With the save, Hoffman became the all-time Major League saves leader, surpassing Lee Smith's record of 478. As the Padres celebrated on the mound with Hoffman, the Pirates remained in the dugout watching in respectful salute. [...] "I've never seen a crowd get into one inning for one guy like that before", said Pirates reliever John Grabow. [...] "You get goose bumps <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> on the other team." [...] The Padres presented Hoffman with a golden bell trophy, a reference to [...] "Hells Bells".|$|E
500|$|More modern {{reception}} for Vampyr {{has been more}} positive. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports that 100% of critics have given the film positive reviews, based upon a sample of 30, with an average rating of 8.8/10. The site's critical consensus reads, [...] "Full of disorienting visual effects, Carl Theodor Dreyer's Vampyr is as theoretically unsettling as it is conceptually disturbing." [...] Todd Kristel of the online film database AllMovie gave the film {{four and a half}} stars out of five, stating that [...] "Vampyr isn't the easiest classic film to enjoy, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> a fan of 1930s horror movies...If you're patient with the slow pacing and ambiguous story line of Vampyr, you'll find that this film offers many striking images" [...] and that although the film is [...] "not exciting in terms of pacing, it's a good choice {{if you want to see}} a film that establishes a compelling mood". Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader wrote, [...] "The greatness of Carl Dreyer's [...] derives partly from its handling of the vampire theme in terms of sexuality and eroticism and partly from its highly distinctive, dreamy look, but it also has something to do with Dreyer's radical recasting of narrative form". J. Hoberman of the Village Voice wrote that [...] "Vampyr is Dreyer's most radical film—maybe one of my dozen favorite movies by any director". Anton Bitel of Channel 4 awarded the film four and a half stars out of five, comparing it to the silent vampire film Nosferatu, stating that it is [...] "lesser known (but in many ways superior)" [...] and that the film is [...] "a triumph of the irrational, Dreyer's eerie memento mori never allows either protagonist or viewer fully to wake up from its surreal nightmare".|$|E
