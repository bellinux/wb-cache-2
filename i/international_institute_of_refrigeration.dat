40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the measurement of}} the thermal conductivity and the dynamic viscosity of H 2 O/KCOOH (potassium formate) desiccant with a salt concentration from 60 to 80 % in the temperature range 1 - 80 degrees C. The thermal conductivity measurement gives evidence of a great sensitivity to salt concentration and lower sensitivity to temperature: H 2 O/KCOOH desiccant shows a thermal conductivity from 23 to 33 % lower than water at the same temperature. H 2 O/KCOOH desiccant exhibits a Newtonian behaviour in all the investigated ranges of temperature and concentration. The relative viscosity shows a great sensitivity to salt concentration and weak or no sensitivity to temperature up to a solution concentration of salt around 70 %. For higher solution concentration of salt (75 and 80 %) the relative viscosity shows a great sensitivity also to temperature. H 2 O/KCOOH desiccant presents a dynamic viscosity from 4 to 30 times higher than water at the same temperature.

40|$|The {{experimental}} {{analysis of}} a gas-driven NH 3 -H 2 O heat pump whose cycle approaches the GAX concept is carried out. Full load operation is investigated by varying hot water temperatures and partial load operation is investigated by decreasing gas input down to 50 % of the full load value. Numerical simulations bolster measurements accuracy and provide insight on the variation of cycle COP and Gas Utilization Efficiency (GUE), based on gross calorific value. A nearly constant GUE of about 1. 5 is found for hot water temperatures lower than 50 °C. The GUE steadily decreases above 50 °C, reaching about 1. 33 at 60 °C. The COP varies more smoothly, from 1. 73 at 45 °C to 1. 60 at 60 °C. The GUE and COP reduction at 50 % of the nominal gas input is 6. 8 % and 6. 4 %, respectively. Simulations suggest that performances at partial loads can improve if active control of solution mass flow rate is implemented. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd. and <b>International</b> <b>Institute</b> <b>of</b> <b>Refrigeration.</b> All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|State-of-the-art heat {{switches}} {{are only}} rarely employed in thermal system architectures, {{since they are}} rather bulky and have a limited thermal performance (expressed as the heat transfer ratio between the "On" and "Off" state). Using selective laser melting additive manufacturing technology, also known as 3 D printing, we developed a compact flat-panel gas-gap heat switch that offers superior thermal performance, is simpler and more economic to produce and assemble, contains no moving parts, and is more reliable because it lacks welded joints. A prototype measuring 5 × 5 × 1 cm 3 outer dimensions is developed with an integrated coolant heat sink to assess the feasibility of the technology. Later a second prototype measuring 3. 2 mm thick, 10 cm by 10 cm frontal area panel is developed. An on-off heat conductance ratio of about 45 is measured at 100 K, and the on-conductance is 4. 5 W/K. In addition to being compact, this type of heat switch has a large on-conductance compared to other types of cryogenic heat switches. This opens doors to utilize the heat switch for cryogenic temperature control applications. © 2016, <b>International</b> <b>Institute</b> <b>of</b> <b>Refrigeration.</b> All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Among the {{technology}} options for improving energy efficiency, heat pumps are commanding considerable attention. By using thermal energy {{resources such as}} natural or waste heat at low-temperatures, heat pumps can meet heating and cooling needs in buildings and industry with minimal consumption of primary energy. To make an objective judgement on the heat pump option, it is prudent to look at worldwide experience. An extensive survey {{carried out by the}} IEA Heat Pump Centre and the <b>International</b> <b>Institute</b> <b>of</b> <b>Refrigeration</b> has examined the situation in a cross-section of countries. This report presents and discusses the results of this survey, to provide an insight into the current significance and potential of the heat pump option. From basic factors such as energy prices and climate, to trends in heat pump performance, the parameters which influence heat pump markets, are examined. With a compilation of the number of heat pumps installed in recent years, and a review of international, national and utility policy measures, this report sets the scene for the future use of heat pumps. Volume 1 analyzes the main data from sixteen countries. Volume 2 A contains detailed reports on these countries, while Volume 2 B comprises similar reports on some additional countries...|$|E

40|$|Double-lift {{absorption}} cycles {{represent a}} suitable solution for air-cooled thermally driven cooling applications. Among the several existing double-lift configurations, semi-GAX cycles {{are known as}} the most promising in terms of efficiency. These cycles incorporate the GAX effect in a pressure staged cycle, {{by means of a}} split on the solution leaving the low pressure absorber. Two configurations of the semi-GAX cycle have been proposed in the past, the semi-GAX 1 and the semi-GAX 2. The former achieves the GAX effect between the intermediate and the high pressure levels, the latter between the low and the intermediate. Within this paper, the semi-GAX cycles are numerically investigated at operating conditions suitable for a low temperature driven (e. g., by flat plate solar collectors) air conditioning application. The peculiarities of the two cycles are described and the factors affecting their performances are underlined. The COP resulted to be strongly influenced by the split ratio, which determines the intermediate pressure and the possibility to achieve the GAX effect. If the split ratio is optimized to achieve the maximum COP, the COP is higher for semi-GAX 2 for air temperatures below 27 °C and for semi-GAX 1 above. In both cases, the maximum air temperature which allows a circulation ratio below 15 is 40 °C, with chilled water at 7 / 12 °C and driving temperature of 90 °C. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd and <b>International</b> <b>Institute</b> <b>of</b> <b>Refrigeration.</b> All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Sources {{of natural}} gas are {{scattered}} relatively evenly around the globe, with the results that a trade has developed in transferring the gas to areas of large demand. Thus there are major pipelines around the world. However much gas is liquefied for both transport and storage {{to take advantage of}} the large decrease in specific volume, which is achieved without the necessity for pressurization.). The estimation of heat transfer in cryogenics tanks under both laminar and turbulent regimes is an important subject, as it enables to predict the evaporation of the stored cryogenic fluids, which involves simultaneously heat and mass transfer operations. Few studies have looked in detail at this problem using, for example, the approximate method. In this paper, experimental results obtained for liquid nitrogen cryostats, concerning heat transfer through conductive, convective and radiation modes under natural and turbulent regimes between the vapor and the necks, as well as velocity, stream and thermal profiles along the cryostat necks are presented. These results, which may be important in this field, are compared firstly with a numerical simulation, which has been developed and solved through the Fluent industrial code, and secondly with a theoretical model which uses basic principles of heat transfer. The study enables to determine the main parameters affecting the heat losses in this tank and validate the industrial package code, Fluent, for the estimation of these parameters, and therefore can be considered as an important contribution to the improvement of the design of cryogenic tanks.

40|$|The {{comparative}} {{assessment of the}} experimental and computational methods for detecting the quantity of frozen-out water proposed by V.  Zhadan, V.  Latyshev, J.  Nagаоka, L.  Riedel, D.  Ryutov and G.  Chizhov as applied to beef in the temperature range of – 1 °С to – 30 °С was carried out. It was shown that the values of frozen-out water proportion detected by the formula of J.  Nagаоka were 6 – 7 % higher than the experimental data of L. Riedel in a temperature range of – 7 °С to – 30 °С. With decrease of the meat temperature from – 7 °С to – 30 °С, {{the difference in the}} experimental data obtained by L. Riedel and V.  Latyshev reaches 5 %. The values corresponding to the most reliable experimental data of L.  Riedel for beef (tcr = – 0, 95 °С), which were adopted in the recommendations of the <b>International</b> <b>Institute</b> <b>of</b> <b>Refrigeration</b> (IIR), are most accurately described by the theoretical dependence proposed by D.  Rutov. Using this dependence, the quantity of frozenout water in a temperature range of – 1 °С to – 4 °С was detected as applied to NOR and DFD meat. It was established that at a difference of the cryoscopic temperature of 0, 3 °С between two groups of meat, the ice content at a temperature of – 2 °С is 13, 0 % higher in DFD meat compared to NOR meat, and in order to ensure the same content of frozen-out water (30 %), the storage temperature for NOR meat should be 0, 5 °С lower than that for DFD meat. </p...|$|E
