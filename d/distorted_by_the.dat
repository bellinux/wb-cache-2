5|$|Located on {{the border}} with Circinus is the unusual {{planetary}} nebula NGC 5189, estimated to be around 1750light-years away from Earth. Its complex structure is due to multiple ejections of material from the ageing central star, which are <b>distorted</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> presence of a likely binary companion. Located 2.4° east of Eta Muscae is the magnitude-12.9 Engraved Hourglass Nebula (MyCn18), which lies about 8000 light-years distant from Earth. To Eta's west lies IC 4191, a compact bluish planetary nebula of magnitude 10.6, thought to lie around 10,750 light-years away from Earth. West of Epsilon Muscae is NGC 4071, a large, diffuse planetary nebula of magnitude 12.7 with a magnitude 12 central star, thought to lie around 4000 light-years away from Earth. The Coalsack Nebula is a dark nebula located mainly in neighbouring Crux that intrudes into Musca. NGC 4463 is an open cluster located on its southwestern border. Around five light-years across, it is located around 3400 light-years away.|$|E
5|$|Peter Frankopan {{has argued}} that the First Crusade has been {{fundamentally}} <b>distorted</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> attention paid by historians to western (Latin) sources, rather than Greek, Syriac, Armenian, Arabic and Hebrew material from the late 11th and 12th centuries. The expedition to Jerusalem, he argues, was conceived of not by the Pope but by the Emperor Alexios I Komnenos, in response to a dramatic deterioration of Byzantium's position in Asia Minor and also {{as a result of a}} state of near anarchy at the imperial court where plans to depose Alexios or even murder him were an open secret by 1094. The appeal to Pope Urban II was a desperate move to shore up Emperor and Empire. Frankopan goes further, showing that the Crusade's primary military targets in Asia Minor - Nicaea and Antioch - required large numbers of men with experience of siege warfare; precisely the sort recruited by Urban during his preaching in France in 1095-6.|$|E

5|$|The K'iche' rebuilt over earlier Classic period {{structures}} in a distinctively K'iche' style. The basic K'iche layout {{consists of a}} westward-facing temple with a steep talud-tablero facade, flanked by two unequally sized wings. This was {{likely to have been}} the temple of Awilix, patron goddess of the Nija'ib' K'iche'. A longer palace structure lies to the north, facing southwards and the ballcourt to the southwest. This K'iche' layout was somewhat <b>distorted</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> reuse of the earlier architecture, because the typical Mam settlement layout was built along an axis running from southeast to northwest. As the K'iche' did not completely redesign the entire site along a K'iche' pattern, the juxtaposition of Mam- and K'iche'-style complexes demonstrates the fusing of the local and intrusive elite lineages.|$|E

It takes {{the mean of the}} three or four pixels and represents them as one pixel. With this approach any noise present can be minimized to certain extent. This method is tested with the binary images of the hand, and the results are presented. ...|$|R

25|$|Attribute {{substitution}} {{explains the}} persistence of some illusions. For example, when subjects judge the size of two figures in a perspective picture, their apparent sizes can be <b>distorted</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> 3D context, making a convincing optical illusion. The theory states that the three-dimensional size of the figure (which is accessible because it is automatically computed by the visual system) is substituted for its two-dimensional size on the page. Experienced painters and photographers are less susceptible to this illusion, because the two-dimensional size is more accessible to their perception.|$|E

25|$|After {{examining}} the case 48 {{years after the}} event, Joe Nickell of the paranormal investigation group Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSI), then known as CSICOP, concluded in 2000 that the bright light in the sky reported by the witnesses on September12 was most likely a meteor, that the pulsating red light was likely an aircraft navigation/hazard beacon, and that the creature described by witnesses closely resembled an owl. Nickell claimed that the latter two of which were <b>distorted</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> heightened state of anxiety felt by the witnesses after having observed the former. Nickell's conclusions are shared {{by a number of}} other investigators, including those of the Air Force. Skeptics have also proposed misidentified owl sightings as explanations for the Mothman and the Kelly-Hopkinsville encounter.|$|E
25|$|From the beginning, {{plans of}} the Confederate War Department (Secretary of War Judah P. Benjamin at first, later George W. Randolph) in Richmond for defense of New Orleans were <b>distorted</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> belief that the primary threat to the city came from the north. Reflecting that belief, much of the {{material}} intended to protect the city was sent to strongpoints on the Mississippi, such as Island Number 10, Fort Pillow, and Memphis. The immediate vicinity {{of the city was}} actually weakened as guns were withdrawn for use in distant campaigns, as for example that leading to the Battle of Shiloh. The region was also stripped of men of military age. Confederate Major General Mansfield Lovell, commander of Department No. 1, put much more credence in the buildup in the Gulf than did his distant superiors. Flag Officer George N. Hollins, CSN, in charge of the Confederate naval forces on the Mississippi at the time, personally agreed with Lovell, but his orders did not permit him to act on his beliefs.|$|E

Describing the situation as a [...] "murderous disaster", he makes suggestions for action by patients' groups, physicians, academics and the industry itself.|$|E

500|$|The pitot {{pressure}} is {{obtained from the}} pitot tube.

[...] By situating the pitot tube in such a location, the ram air pressure is more accurately measured since it will be less <b>distorted</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> aircraft's structure.

40|$|This {{research}} {{investigated the}} identification of fingerprints which had been <b>distorted</b> <b>by</b> heating <b>the</b> recipient surface. Fingerprints were deposited on uPVC which was then exposed to sufficient heat to cause distortion of the surface.

Photographic images were taken of the fingerprints before and after distortion and both sets of images where loaded into the Sagem Metamorpho™ AFIS. Successful identifications were obtained in a number of cases. The results indicated that the quality of the fingerprint before heating influenced {{the identification of}} the distorted fingerprint. The results also showed that the vertically distorted fingerprints were more readily identified than horizontally distorted fingerprints. This research has shown that successful identifications can be achieved from fingerprints <b>distorted</b> <b>by</b> heat providing <b>the</b> pre heated fingerprint is of good quality...|$|R
