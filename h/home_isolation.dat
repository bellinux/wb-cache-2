40|$|Concerns {{about an}} {{imminent}} influenza pandemic have been intensified after {{the emergence of}} the new influenza A(H 1 N 1) v strain.

When initiating the intervention of 100 % school closure in a community of 2, 000 people at a threshold of 1 % cumulative attack rate, the total number of symptomatic cases is predicted to decrease by 89. 3 %, as compared to the non-intervention scenario. When this measure is coupled with treatment and <b>home</b> <b>isolation</b> of symptomatic cases as well as a 50 % reduction of social contacts, a 94. 8 % decline in the cumulative attack rate is predicted along with a much shorter duration of influenza A(H 1 N 1) v transmission.

40|$|In Australia {{there is}} a gap between those with the best and poorest health, which has {{implications}} for the health outcomes {{of some of the}} most disadvantaged groups in the community. In this thesis, I present four applied research projects that were undertaken across a broad range of public health policy and practice areas for populations with diverse needs. The importance of addressing inequity experienced by these populations and the impact of the projects on public health knowledge, policy and practice in New South Wales (NSW) is explored. The first project presents the outcomes of an emergency response exercise I conducted to test proposed <b>home</b> <b>isolation</b> and quarantine arrangements. Populations with diverse needs pose a unique challenge for <b>home</b> <b>isolation</b> and quarantine. The outcomes of the exercise have contributed to the development of public health policy, which will be used in future pandemic responses in NSW. One component of the ‘The health of Aboriginal people of NSW: Report of the Chief Health Officer 2012 ’ is presented as the second project. The report provides baseline measurements on the health status of Aboriginal people and health system performance that can be used to monitor progress towards achieving national closing the gap targets. Lung cancer is the fourth most common cancer in males and females, and the leading cause of cancer deaths in both sexes in NSW. The third project describes the outcomes of research on lung cancer awareness conducted with three culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) communities in Sydney and how I used this research to tailor a social marketing campaign on lung cancer awareness. The fourth project presents research I conducted with the Pacific Island community on barriers to immunisation, the outcomes of which were used to guide the implementation of catch-up immunisation clinics using a novel setting, a church environment. This thesis represents an important contribution to new public health knowledge in the areas of pandemic preparedness, Aboriginal health, facilitating earlier diagnosis of lung cancer and improving immunisation coverage in the Pacific Island community in NSW.

30|$|Acculturative stress, {{which is}} rooted in the {{acculturation}} process according to Berry (1997, 2005, 2006), is the difficulty one faces while transitioning into a new culture (Smart and Smart 1995). Particular examples include not being able to communicate with locals, being uprooted from <b>home,</b> feelings of <b>isolation,</b> being powerless, and depression (Szabo et al. in press). Acculturative stress can depend on the type of migration (e.g. educational sojourner vs. economic migrant; see Boski, 2013) and be classified as intercultural, interpersonal, intrapersonal, academic, and environmental (Hashim and Zhiliang 2003). Acculturative stress has been linked to outcomes in acculturation such as one’s emotional well-being (psychological adaptation), health conditions (health-related adaptation), or behavioral competence in the new culture (social-cultural adaptation) (Nguyen and Benet-Martínez 2012).|$|R
40|$|The role {{of social}} {{distancing}} measures in mitigating pandemic influenza is not precisely understood. To this end, {{we have conducted}} a systematised review, {{particularly in light of}} the 2009 pandemic influenza, to better inform the role of social distancing measures against pandemic influenza. Articles were identified from relevant databases and the data were synthesised to provide evidence on the role of school or work place-based interventions, case-based distancing (self-isolation, quarantine), and restriction of mobility and mass gatherings. School closure, whether proactive or reactive, appears to be moderately effective and acceptable in reducing the transmission of influenza and in delaying the peak of an epidemic but is associated with very high secondary costs. Voluntary <b>home</b> <b>isolation</b> and quarantine are also effective and acceptable measures but there is an increased risk of intra-household transmission from index cases to contacts. Work place-related interventions like work closure and home working are also modestly effective and are acceptable, but likely to be economically disruptive.

40|$|Study the {{influence}} of household contact structure on the spread of an influenza-like illness. Examine whether changes to in-home care giving arrangements can significantly affect the household transmission counts. We simulate two different behaviors for the symptomatic person; either s/he remains at home in contact with {{everyone else in the}} household or s/he remains at home in contact with only the primary caregiver in the household. The two different cases are referred to as full mixing and single caregiver, respectively. The results show that the household's cumulative transmission count is lower in case of a single caregiver configuration than in the full mixing case. The household transmissions vary almost linearly with the household size in both single caregiver and full mixing cases. However the difference in household transmissions due to the difference in household structure grows with the household size especially in case of moderate flu.

We {{aimed to}} examine {{community}} knowledge about {{and attitudes toward}} the threat of pandemic influenza and assess the community acceptability of strategies to reduce its effect. Methods. We conducted computer-aided telephone interviews in 2007 with a cross-sectional sample of rural and metropolitan residents of South Australia. Results. Of 1975 households interviewed, half (50. 2 %) {{had never heard of}} pandemic influenza or were unaware of its meaning. Only 10 % of respondents were extremely concerned about the threat of pandemic influenza. Respondents identified children as the highest priority for vaccination, if supplies were limited; they ranked politicians and teachers as the lowest priority. Although only 61. 7 % of respondents agreed with a policy of <b>home</b> <b>isolation,</b> 98. 2 % agreed if {{it was part of a}} national strategy. Respondents considered television to be the best means of educating the community. Conclusions. Community knowledge about pandemic influenza is poor despite widespread concern. Public education about pandemic influenza is essential if strategies to reduce the impact of the disease are to be effective.

40|$|Background and objective: Mental health {{problems}} are {{a public health}} issue affecting as many as 20 % of children in modern communities. Risk factors for externalising and internalising problems can occur in infancy. Infants at high risk live in stressed families with parent mental {{health problems}}, substance misuse, relationship conflict, social isolation, financial problems or infant temperamental difficulty. Although current prevention programmes target services to high-risk groups, targeting can stigmatise families and miss many children in need. The addition of universal prevention programmes for all families could address these concerns. This survey assessed the prevalence of infants at risk attending a primary care service as a delivery point for universal prevention. Design: Survey of mothers of 6 -month-old infants attending well-child clinics across six government areas of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, between August and September 2004. A brief survey measured sociodemographic characteristics and the following family risks: maternal depression, anxiety, stress, substance misuse, violence at <b>home,</b> social <b>isolation</b> and infant temperamental difficulty. Results: The survey was completed by 733 mothers, representing 69 % of infant births presented to the primary care service. Of these, 39 % of infants were classified as at risk for developing mental health problems. The percentage of infants classified as at risk was not markedly dissimilar across socioeconomi...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2013 In North America, the {{contemporary}} cultural response to death is to enclose it within cemeteries, banish {{it to the}} periphery of the urban experience or conceal it within funeral <b>homes.</b> This <b>isolation</b> deprives urban centers and their inhabitants of a vital civic space dedicated to the acts and rituals associated with death. Distanced and forgotten from daily life, these places of remembrance are not seen as cultural resources for the communities in which they reside. This distancing of death from daily life has affected the human ability to resolve death and dying. With the current preference of cremation over ground-burials and an increase in secularization of the population in the US, an opportunity arises to reconsider the location and design of memorial spaces. This thesis explores the potential for architecture to contribute to the spaces where life and death intersect, enabling them to enrich the human experience by charging our everyday lives with the emotional power that comes from awareness of our own mortality. This project proposes a reinsertion of memorial spaces into the Seattle city core, to re-establish the connection between the dead and living, replacing the rarely visited cemetery landscape with spaces woven into the urban fabric, everyday places for social gathering...|$|R
40|$|There {{have been}} few recent studies demonstrating a {{definitive}} association between the transmission of airborne infections and the ventilation of buildings. The {{severe acute respiratory syndrome}} (SARS) epidemic in 2003 and current concerns about the risk of an avian influenza (H 5 N 1) pandemic, have made a review of this area timely. We searched the major literature databases between 1960 and 2005, and then screened titles and abstracts, and finally selected 40 original studies based on a set of criteria. We established a review panel comprising medical and engineering experts in the fields of microbiology, medicine, epidemiology, indoor air quality, building ventilation, etc. Most panel members had experience with research into the 2003 SARS epidemic. The panel systematically assessed 40 original studies through both individual assessment and a 2 -day face-to-face consensus meeting. Ten of 40 studies reviewed were considered to be conclusive with regard to the association between building ventilation and the transmission of airborne infection. There is strong and sufficient evidence to demonstrate the association between ventilation, air movements in buildings and the transmission/spread of infectious diseases such as measles, tuberculosis, chickenpox, influenza, smallpox and SARS.

40|$|Investigations of {{respiratory}} illnesses and infections in Tecumseh, Michigan, USA, {{were carried out}} in two phases, together covering 11 years. During the second phase, there were 5363 person-years of observation. Respiratory illness rates in {{both males and females}} peaked in the 1 - 2 year age group and fell thereafter. Adult females had more frequent illnesses than adult males; illnesses were less common in working women than in women not working outside the <b>home.</b> <b>Isolation</b> of viruses fell with increasing age; rhinoviruses were the most common isolate. Influenza infection rates, determined serologically, suggested relative sparing of young children from infection with type A (H 1 N 1) and type B. Infection rates were highest in adult age groups for type A (H 3 N 2). The isolation and serological infection rates were used to estimate the extent to which laboratory procedures underestimated the proportion {{of respiratory}} illnesses caused by each infectious agent; data from other studies were also used in this estimation.

40|$|We expect social {{networks}} {{to change as}} a result of illness, but social contact data are generally collected from healthy persons. Here we quantified the impact of influenza-like illness on social mixing patterns. We analyzed the contact patterns of persons from England measured when they were symptomatic with influenza-like illness during the 2009 A/H 1 N 1 pdm influenza epidemic (2009 – 2010) and again 2 weeks later when they had recovered. Illness was associated with a {{reduction in the number of}} social contacts, particularly in settings outside the home, reduc-ing the reproduction number to about one-quarter of the value it would otherwise have taken. We also observed a change in the age distribution of contacts. By comparing the expected age distribution of cases resulting from trans-mission by (a) symptomatic persons with incidence data, we estimated the contribution of both groups to trans-mission. Using this, we calculated the fraction of transmission resulting from (a) symptomatic persons, assuming equal duration of infectiousness. We estimated that 66 % of transmission was attributable to persons with sympto-matic disease (95 % confidence interval: 0. 23, 1. 00). This has important implications for control: Treating sympto-matic persons with antiviral agents or encouraging <b>home</b> <b>isolation</b> would be expected to have a major impact on transmission, particularly since the reproduction number for this strain was low. behavioral change; contact networks; disease transmission; influenza; R 0 ratio; social interactio...|$|E

S., bringing {{the total number of}} cases to 40 so far. At this time, cases of swine influenza have been confirmed in California, Kansas, New York City, Ohio, and Texas. Based on the rapid spread of the virus thus far, public health officials believe that more cases will be identified over the next several weeks. Case counts are updated daily and available at [URL] April 26, 2009, the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, Janet Napolitano, announced that the Department of Health and Human Services declared a public health emergency in the United States. This will allow funds to be released to support the public health response. CDC's goals during this public health emergency are to reduce transmission and illness severity, and to provide information to assist health care providers, public health officials, and the public in addressing the challenges posed by this newly-identified influenza virus. Laboratory testing has found that the swine influenza A (H 1 N 1) virus susceptible to the prescription antiviral drugs oseltamivir and zanamivir. CDC is releasing one-quarter of its antiviral drugs, personal protective equipment, and respiratory protection devices to help states respond to the outbreak. Community mitigation actions are also recommended to prevent illness. Steps including <b>home</b> <b>isolation</b> of cases, school dismissals, and other social distancing interventions may be implemented by communities and families as part of a comprehensive program of infection control. Community mitigation strategies may be different for each state or community depending on the numbers of cases and spread of disease. As a result, CDC is issuing mitigation guidance that includes a range of interventions so that public health authorities can identify the most appropriate means to protect their counties, communities, and citizens. CDC is recommending <b>home</b> <b>isolation</b> of ill persons. Persons who develop influenza-like-illness (ILI) (fever with either cough or sore throat) should be strongly encouraged to self-isolate in their home for 7 days after the onset of illness or at least 24 hours after symptoms have resolved, whichever is longer. Persons who experience ILI and wish to seek medical care should contact their health care providers to report illness (by telephone or other remote means) before seeking care at a clinic, physician's office, or hospital. Persons who have difficulty breathing or shortness of breath, or are believed to be severely ill, should seek immediate medical attention. Household contacts of persons with symptoms consistent with swine influenza should remain home at the earliest sign of illness; minimize contact in the community to the extent possible; designate a single household family member as the ill person's caregiver to minimize interactions with asymptomatic persons. CDC recommends that other social distancing interventions be considered. Large gatherings linked to settings or institutions with laboratory-confirmed cases should be cancelled, for example a school event linked to a school with cases; other large gatherings in the community may not need to be cancelled at this time. Additional social distancing measures are currently not recommended. Persons with underlying medical conditions who are at high risk for complications of influenza may wish to consider avoiding large gatherings.

The {{struggle}} for liberation in South Africa goes back {{a number of}} centuries from the earliest contact between black and white; and the centuries of struggle mainly against land dispossession. The struggle moved from armed resistance {{to the use of}} non-violent means. In the early 1960 s, because of white herrenvolkist intransigence, the struggle reverted to armed resistance. The struggle was largely against racism and colonialism - and can therefore be regarded as a {{struggle for}} human rights. The icons of the struggle, that is, those individuals and physical and spiritual beacons which marked the route to freedom, identified by the people themselves, compose the Chris Hani District Municipality Liberation Heritage Route (LHR). The identification process involved community participation through the organisation of meetings, under the leadership of Local Municipality Steering Committees and Community Facilitators appointed by the LM specifically to facilitate the LHR project.

40|$|When a novel {{influenza}} A virus with pandemic potential emerges, nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) {{often are}} the most readily available interventions to help slow transmission of the virus in communities, which is especially important before a pandemic vaccine becomes widely available. NPIs, also known as community mitigation measures, are actions that persons and communities can take to help slow the spread of respiratory virus infections, including seasonal and pandemic influenza viruses. These guidelines replace the 2007 Interim Pre-pandemic Planning Guidance: Community Strategy for Pandemic Influenza Mitigation in the United States 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 d Early, Targeted, Layered Use of Nonpharmaceutical Interventions ([URL] Several elements remain unchanged from the 2007 guidance, which described recommended NPIs and the supporting rationale and key concepts {{for the use of}} these interventions during influenza pandemics. NPIs can be phased in, or layered, on the basis of pandemic severity and local transmission patterns over time. Categories of NPIs include personal protective measures for everyday use (e. g., voluntary <b>home</b> <b>isolation</b> of ill persons, respiratory etiquette, and hand hygiene); personal protective measures reserved for influenza pandemics (e. g., voluntary home quarantine of exposed household members and use of face masks in community settings when ill); community measures aimed at increasing social distancing (e. g., school closures and dismissals, social distancing in workplaces, and postponing or cancelling mass gatherings); and environmental measures (e. g., routine cleaning of frequently touched surfaces). Several new elements have been incorporated into the 2017 guidelines. First, to support updated recommendations on the use of NPIs, the latest scientific evidence available since the influenza A (H 1 N 1) pdm 09 pandemic has been added. Second, a summary of lessons learned from the 2009 H 1 N 1 pandemic response is presented to underscore the importance of broad and flexible prepandemic planning. Third, a new section on community engagement has been included to highlight that the timely and effective use of NPIs depends on community acceptance and active participation. Fourth, to provide new or updated pandemic assessment and planning tools, the novel influenza virus pandemic intervals tool, the Influenza Risk Assessment Tool, the Pandemic Severity Assessment Framework, and a set of prepandemic planning scenarios are described. Finally, to facilitate implementation of the updated guidelines and to assist states and localities with prepandemic planning and decision-making, this report links to six supplemental prepandemic NPI planning guides for different community settings that are available online ([URL] citation for this article: Qualls N, Levitt A, Kanade N, et al.

50|$|Bernstein, like Blitzstein before him, is skewering American {{capitalist}} society. Life as U.S. capitalism prescribes it - in suburbia, in one's own house, full of one's possessions - produces {{misery and}} <b>isolation.</b> <b>Home</b> and work are separated. Competition, not love, rules the day. Community - the neighbors - {{you see on}} Sunday only (and presumably only the men are interacting, as the Sunday activity is playing golf). The man runs for his train, going {{to the city to}} work; the woman stays home. Who you know is important (Bill, who gets the loan, also belongs to Sam's handball club); money gives power gives happiness (Sam's thrill at turning down Mr. Partridge). Culture you get on TV or from the Book-of-the-Month club. Sex is something a man does with his secretary, or wants to, not something a husband and wife engage in (though they must have done it once). Escapist, false entertainment ("Island Magic") helps make life endurable.|$|R
40|$|Feminist {{writers have}} drawn {{attention}} {{to the way in}} which the home can be a source of oppression for women, by the experience of domestic violence and the unending burdens of domestic labour. In this literature little attention has been paid to the experiences of lone mothers specifically. This paper presents findings from empirical work with self-defined lone mothers living in social housing and in receipt of income support in south-west England. The tensions between the home being experienced in positive terms as a place of refuge or as symbolic of a new stage of life are contrasted with the experiences of home as a place of isolation and generating a sense of captivity. The way lone mothers experience the home can be understood with reference to a number of factors. These include whether the lone mother has insider or outside status in the area, the perception and experience of crime, racism, social networks and the experience of mothering.

40|$|As the {{pandemic}} (H 1 N 1) 2009 progressed, the Ministry of Health of China advised {{cases with}} mild symptoms to remain <b>home</b> for <b>isolation</b> and observation, {{which may have}} increased the risk for infection among other household members. Describing the transmission characteristics of this novel virus is indispensable to effectively controlling the spread of disease; thus, {{the aim of this}} study was to assess risk factors associated with household transmission of pandemic H 1 N 1 from self-quarantined patients in Beijing, the capital city of China. A 1 : 2 case-control study with 54 case households and 108 control households was conducted between August 1 and September 30, 2009 in Beijing. Cases were households with a self-quarantined index patient and a secondary case, while controls were households with a self-quarantined index patient and a close contact. Controls were also matched to cases for sex and age of index case-patient. A structured interview guide was used to collect the data. Conditional logistical models were employed to estimate Odds Ratios (OR) with 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CI). Results indicated that higher education level (OR 0. 42; 95 % CI 0. 22 - 0. 83), sharing room with an index case-patient (OR 3. 29; 95 %CI 1. 23 - 8. 78), daily room ventilation (OR 0. 28; 95 %CI 0. 08 - 0. 93), and hand washing ≥ 3 /d (OR 0. 71; 95 %CI 0. 48 - 0. 94) were related to the household transmission of pandemic H 1 N 1 from self-quarantined patients. These results highlight that health education, as well as the quarantine of the index case-patient immediately after infection, frequent hand hygiene, an...|$|R
