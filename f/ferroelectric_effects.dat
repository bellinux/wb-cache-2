5000|$|In {{collaboration}} with researchers of NIOPIK, Moscow, a new, fast responding ferroelectric field-effect, denominated Deformed Helix Ferroelectric (DHF)-effect, is presented. Unlike other <b>ferroelectric</b> <b>effects,</b> the DHF-effect enables gray scale and rms-driving. Both properties are crucial for spatial light modulators and for very fast responding, high information con-tent displays and electronic color shutters (c.f. also ref. 111, 123).|$|E
5000|$|Another major {{challenge}} for perovskite solar cells is {{the observation that}} current-voltage scans yield ambiguous efficiency values.The power-conversion efficiency of a solar cell is usually determined by characterizing its current-voltage (IV) behavior under simulated solar illumination. In contrast to other solar cells, however, {{it has been observed}} that the IV-curves of perovskite solar cells show a hysteretic behavior: depending on scanning conditions - such as scan direction, scan speed, light soaking, biasing - there is a discrepancy between the scan from forward-bias to short-circuit (FB-SC) and the scan from short-circuit to forward bias (SC-FB). Various causes have been proposed such as ion movement, polarization, <b>ferroelectric</b> <b>effects,</b> filling of trap states, [...] however, the exact origin for the hysteretic behavior is yet to be determined. But it appears that determining the solar cell efficiency from IV-curves risks producing inflated values if the scanning parameters exceed the time-scale which the perovskite system requires in order to reach an electronic steady-state. Two possible solutions have been proposed: Unger et al. show that extremely slow voltage-scans allow the system to settle into steady-state conditions at every measurement point which thus eliminates any discrepancy between the FB-SC and the SC-FB scan. Henry Snaith et al. have proposed 'stabilized power output' as a metric for the efficiency of a solar cell. This value is determined by holding the tested device at a constant voltage around the maximum power-point (where the product of voltage and photocurrent reaches its maximum value) and track the power-output until it reaches a constant value.Both methods have been demonstrated to yield lower efficiency values when compared to efficiencies determined by fast IV-scans. However, initial studies have been published that show that surface passivation of the perovskite absorber is an avenue with which efficiency values can be stabilized very close to fast-scan efficiencies.Initial reports suggest that in the 'inverted architecture', which has a transparent cathode, little to no hysteresis is observed. This suggests that the interfaces might play a crucial role with regards to the hysteretic IV behavior since the major difference of the inverted architecture to the regular architectures is that an organic n-type contact is used instead of a metal oxide.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a structural {{study of the}} ferroelectric materials PbNb_ 2 O_ 6 and PbTa_ 2 O_ 6. This has allowed links between crystalline structure and physical properties to be deduced. Single-crystal samples have been grown via spontaneous nucleation from the melt or by using a flux method. Polycrystalline powders have also been prepared using solid state sintering techniques. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction experiments using synchrotron radiation and an area detector, combined with high resolutions powder neutron diffraction have allowed a detailed structural study to be completed. At room temperature these materials possess an orthorhombic superstructure which {{can be described as}} a distortion of the tetragonal tungsten bronze structure. Occupational and displacement disorder of the Pb atoms {{has been found to be}} present in both compounds. Planes of diffuse scattering in reciprocal space have been observed during the single crystal diffraction experiments and short-range ordering models are presented to explain this observation are discussed. Both compounds are shown to possess sizeable second harmonic generating efficiencies. The origins of the second-harmonic generation and <b>ferroelectric</b> <b>effects</b> in both materials are also examined. In order to study the high-temperature crystal structure and phase-transitions of these materials, a gas-flow furnace has been designed and built. PbNb_ 2 O_ 6 undergoes a transition from orthorhombic to tetragonal symmetry. The apparatus has allowed the structure of the paraelectric phases of these materials to be determined. All of the X-ray derived structural refinements are complemented with thermal neutron diffraction studies using polycrystalline samples. The gas furnace has also been successfully used by a number of groups running experiments at the Daresbury synchrotron, notably The Royal Institution of Great Britain, London, researching zeolites.

Nanocrystals of K 3 Li 2 Nb 5 O 15 were successfully grown inside tellurite glass matrix via conventional heat-treatment route. Eventhough, tellurite glasses preferentially crystallize {{only on the}} surface, bulk uniform crystallization was achieved in the (100 -x) TeO 2 - x(1. 5 K 2 O-Li 2 O- 2. 5 Nb 2 O 5) system. Heat capacity studies revealed them to be thermodynamically less fragile than any other tellurite glasses ever reported in the literature. Pyroelectric and <b>ferroelectric</b> <b>effects</b> as well as second harmonic generation were demonstrated for the heat treated (glass nanocrystal composites) samples in this system. The conventional method of melt-quenching of constituent oxides could not yield Ba 5 Li 2 Ti 2 Nb 8 O 30 crystallites. So, Ba 5 Li 2 Ti 2 Nb 8 O 30 microcrystals were successfully formed in tellurite glass matrix by mixing pre-reacted Ba 5 Li 2 Ti 2 Nb 8 O 30 ceramic powders with TeO 2. The glass transition temperature {{was found to be}} the highest ever reported and this system was kinetically strong based on the fragility parameter. Dielectric studies revealed a frequency and temperature independent nature of the dielectric constant and very low dielectric loss. The SHG measurement which was carried out as a function of temperature demonstrated the incidence of blue second harmonic generation in the microcrystals present in the glass matrix. Ba 5 Li 2 Ti 2 Nb 8 O 30 nanocrystals were successfully crystallized in the transparent glass system (100 -x) Li 2 B 4 O 7 – x(Ba 5 Li 2 Ti 2 Nb 8 O 30). Dielectric constant increased while the dielectric loss decreased with the increase in Ba 5 Li 2 Ti 2 Nb 8 O 30 content. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic studies were carried out to have an insight into the structure of this system. Transmission studies and refractive index measurements were performed and various optical parameters were calculated. Dielectric and transport properties were studied for the glasses and glass nano/microcrystal composites of all the systems reported in this thesis. Li+ ion was found to be responsible for conduction in all these systems. Evolution of self-organized nanopatterns of K 3 Li 2 Nb 5 O 15 crystals has been demonstrated in the glass system (100 -x) TeO 2 - x(1. 5 K 2 O-Li 2 O- 2. 5 Nb 2 O 5) by excimer laser irradiation.
