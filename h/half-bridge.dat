Instead, the transistor(s) or vacuum tube(s) provide the switching or amplifying function necessary to generate RF power for the primary circuit. Solid-state Tesla coils use the lowest primary operating voltage, typically between 155 and 800 volts, and drive the primary winding using either a single, <b>half-bridge,</b> or full-bridge arrangement of bipolar transistors, MOSFETs or IGBTs to switch the primary current. Vacuum tube coils typically operate with plate voltages between 1500 and 6000 volts, while most spark gap coils operate with primary voltages of 6,000 to 25,000 volts. The primary winding of a traditional transistor Tesla coil is wound around only the bottom portion of the secondary coil. This configuration illustrates operation of the secondary as a pumped resonator.

Fuel cell–powered electric vehicles (FCPEV) require an energy storage device to start up the fuel cells and to store the energy captured during regenerative braking. Low-voltage (12 V) batteries are preferred as the storage device to maintain compatibility {{with the majority of}} today’s automobile loads. A dc/dc converter is therefore needed to interface the low-voltage batteries with the fuel cell–powered higher-voltage dc bus system (255 V ~ 425 V), transferring energy in either direction as required. This paper presents a soft-switched, isolated bi-directional dc/dc converter developed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory for FCPEV applications. The converter employs dual <b>half-bridges</b> interconnected with an isolation transformer to minimize the number of switching devices and their associated gate drive requirements. Snubber capacitors including the parasitic capacitance of the switching devices and the transformer leakage inductance are utilized to achieve zero-voltage switching (ZVS).

40|$|Ordinary Pulse-Width-modulated signals have spectrums that hasn’t {{got good}} EMC characteristics. The {{trapezoidal}} pulses have got short rise- and fall-times and this causes both conducted as radiated interference. In the literature, there exist several methods {{for dealing with}} this problem. For instance, there exist random modulation techniques, and spread-spectrum techniques. Here, the harmonics of the PWM-waveform are smeared across a wider frequency domain and this causes the magnitude to decrease. Hence, an easier filtering of the harmonics is possible. A {{first part of this}} thesis consists of evaluating how these random and spread-spectrum techniques have advantages with respect to ordinary PWM. Both a theoretical study and an experimental can be performed. Induction motors, connected to a Voltage Source Inverter (VSI) are widely applied in industry. The motors are driven by square wave PWM voltages. The dv/dt’s of these voltages are very high (order 10 ^ 9 V/s). In three-phase inverters with three <b>half-bridges,</b> there is a common-mode (CM) voltage because the PWM-signals are inherently asymmetrical. These CM-voltage generates a leakage current, that flows through the parasitic capacitance between ground and motor, and through the motor cable.

40|$|Monolithic {{integration}} of electronic systems {{is one of}} the major techniques to reduce cost, size and power consumption in consumer applications. The integration paradigm states that the trend is to look for opportunities to integrate more functionality on a single siliconnbsp;or in the same integrated circuit. The paradigm has been true in RF circuits where an immense step towards integration has been done in the last two decades. Mobile communication was the major driver in this evolution. This trend has been made possible thanks to the invention of the integrated circuit, and the ever continuing scaling of CMOS technology. This scaling has been closely following Moore’s law. However, the increasing power density starts to pose challenging limitations to this continuing scaling. The trend that has been present in RF CMOS is now also continuing in the field of Power CMOS. One can determine a trend towards the {{integration of}} power supply blocks thanks to the advances in CMOS technology. A major driver here is cost reduction by reducing the bill of materials. The use of on-chip converters provides an elegant and compact solution with a minimum of external components. Moreover, the efficiency is boosted compared to linear regulators. In this research, the author wants to take the next step in this Power CMOS evolution. After the integrated DC-DC conversion and attempts for integrated AC-DC conversion, the next leap has to be taken. This work will set out to explore the different possibilities to realize fully-integrated DC-AC conversion. Three major challenges will be encountered in this thesis. A first challenge is to keep the control logic as simple and straightforward as possible. Therefore, it is paramount to have a linear relationship between the control signals and the modulated output waveform. The buck-buck topology will be the most designated topology as it has a strictly linear voltage characteristic. This will simplify the control system and straightforward modulation will be possible. Next to this topology, resonant converter topologies will be discussed and investigated as well. A first on-chip implementation will be presented to demonstrate these concepts. A second important challenge in the integration is the limit imposed by the low supply voltages in standard CMOS technologies. These constrain the on-chip voltages to be within the defined supply voltage. At higher voltages outside of the nominal range, breakdown mechanisms and hot carrier degradation effects will be present. In this work, one presented approach to tackle this problem will be the series-stacking of several dies as to achieve higher output voltage while still respecting the on-chip voltage limits. Another approach will be the use of full-bridge topologies to achieve bipolar output voltages. A combination of the series-stacking approach in a full-bridge topology will be demonstrated in a second on-chip implementation. A third design challenge is thenbsp;for integration of filtering inductors and capacitors. These will demand a certain chip area. Since they are used for filtering, they tend to be relatively large compared to the circuitry. Therefore there is an associated big area-cost. In this work, the author will present an approach to alleviate the integration of these blocks. By combining two <b>half-bridges,</b> therenbsp;be no DC-offset present in the output voltage. This enables the elimination of the output LC low-pass filter that is needed otherwise. Removing these external components for the LC filter decreases the cost and the volume so that the complete DC-AC converter can be made smaller and cheaper. To conclude, a self-contained fully-integrated photovoltaic DC-AC converter design will be presented. This design will be demonstrated with an on-chip implementation. It serves as a proof of concept to take the next leap in the Power CMOS evolution. A photodiode will be integrated on-chip to power the complete DC-AC converter design. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this project}} is the {{analysis}} and design of a DC/DC converter for aircraft applications. This converter {{is part of the}} output of an isolated rectifier unit for the distribution of electric power inside the airplane. This work is part of the research effort done by the Center of Industrial Electronics in Universidad Politécnica de Madrid (CEI-UPM), in the More Electric Aircraft (MEA) topic. The system works as a rectifier of the current obtained at the turbines, the generator of the plane. A three-phased current flows to a device for eliminating the electronic interference (EMI). Then, a buck rectifier reduces the current, and finally a DC/DC converter adjusts its input voltage to the voltage at the load. The objective of this project is designing an efficient and lightweight DC/DC converter in order to reduce fuel consumption on the plane. Its input voltage come from the rectifier. Output voltage is 28 V as it is nowadays integrated in most planes. It is formed by active elements (switches and control) and by passive elements (transformer and bridge). The topology chosen is full-bridge as isolation is needed and transformer is simpler than in <b>half-bridges.</b> Inside full-bridge, there are different possibilities: phase shifted, dual active bridge, resonant dual active bridge and triangular full bridge. The Triangular Full-Bridge is the chosen topology because the soft switches on both bridges at the primary and the secondary, and it only needs one magnetizing component, which gives the leakage needed for obtaining the triangular wave form. Due to the high ripple on this current, high capacitance is needed at the output. This capacitance can cover a big volume, being a disadvantage for this topology. It is mandatory to avoid Continuous Current Mode (CCM) and always operate with Discontinuous Current Mode (DCM), as behavior control of the converter changes and less hard-switchings are required. ZCS is achieved on most switches and less losses and noise on output are produced. Anyway, there are some disadvantages that must be considered: • High number of transistors: The main disadvantage of a full-bridge topology is that it needs minimum eight transistors. Because of this the total voltage drop in transistors duplicates of that in case of center-tap rectifiers, if both sides of the transformer are connected as rectifiers. Losses are increased and conversion efficiency is somewhat reduced. • High RMS currents: The RMS current is the equivalent steady DC value which gives the same effect and therefore the same losses on transformer and transistors, as they have internal resistances. Another disadvantage of high RMS current is high ripple, that leads to high capacitance on the output. With interleaving ripples can be compensated and capacitance can be smaller. There are three different states per cycle on current waveform. The Dead state allows to have ZCS. Different types of power semiconductor switches are designed for functioning in diverse conditions. Voltage, current and switching frequency of the application are the parameters that need to be considered for electing the right switch. Increasing frequency allows the transformer to be smaller. As converter’s layout depends {{on the size of the}} transformer and specifications establish that it is needed a high power density. Therefore, a high frequency is obligatory. MOSFET is the technology that best fits these exigencies. Some IGBTs are also good solutions. There are different kinds of MOSFETs depending on their material: Silicon MOSFETs are the traditionally used; Silicon Carbide MOSFETs are good for preforming with high voltages and high power, Gallium Nitride MOSFETs are excellent for high frequencies. Interleaving consists in producing a multiphase current thanks to various converters connected in parallel. There are as many phases as converters. The main advantage is that every converter handles less power so current peaks are lower. In this application, interleaving helps to take advantage of the leakage inductance of the transformer. With a single converter, for most turn ratios it is mandatory to add another external inductance to the circuit. This is a big disadvantage as it would force to operate with specifications that would not produce the less losses possible, or to place an external inductance that would drop power density. In order to evaluate the efficiency of this converter, a proper calculation of losses in the devices as well as in the transformer is required. As it was explained before, the design and optimization of the transformer is out of the aim of this work so it will not be calculated. However, the optimized design is going to take into account some of the restrictions on the transformer design and the integration of the magnetizing components needed to achieve a good power density. The parameters regarded for the design space are: • Frequency • Inductance • Turns ratio of the transformer. • Number of devices in parallel (Primary and secondary) • Diodes or MOSFET in secondary • Number of Parallel converters • Stability • Maximum current on devices Primary bridge MOSFETs operate with 400 V, therefore the best materials are Silicon and Silicon Carbide. It is possible to discriminate two types of MOSFET side: - High side has switching, conduction and reverse recovery losses. Consequently, the number of MOSFET in parallel per side and the MOSFET employed are determined by the configuration that reaches the lower losses. - Low side only has conduction losses. For that reason, the MOSFET chosen is the one with less RDS at temperature of operation. Also a high number of MOSFET per side is desired. Secondary bridge performs with 28 V, for that reason GaN MOSFETs and diodes can be taken into account as alternatives to Silicon and Silicon Carbide MOSFETs. Secondary side mainly has conduction losses. Therefore, the same configuration selection as in low MOSFETs in primary is applicable. An important fact to take into account is that devices have to be able to endure the current that flows through them without breaking. With low frequencies, the time demanded for reaching the current peak that delivers on output the correct power is bigger than in high frequencies. Consequently, slope is smaller and inductance bigger in low frequencies than in high frequencies. But with more converters, different turn ratios produce different waveforms at the output, and consequently ripple changes as well. Ripple drops and capacitance thus is not forced to be that big. Its size changes with turn ratio as well. However, there are some turn ratios where adding more converters ripple increases. Losses in transformer are reduced by ZVS. But, in order to achieve zero voltage, some magnetizing current is required. As a consequence, on dead state there is no zero current and ZCS on MOSFETs is not achieved. Therefore, switching losses increase in configurations where high magnetizing current is needed. It is not possible to determine which is the best solution. Future research lines on the transformer will allow to choose the configuration with lower volume, weight and losses...|$|R

[...] The full-bridge variant of MMC allows the submodule capacitor to be inserted into the circuit in either polarity. This confers additional flexibility in controlling the converter and allows the converter to block the fault current which arises from a short-circuit between the positive and negative DC terminals (something which is impossible with any of the preceding types of VSC). Furthermore it allows the DC voltage to be of either polarity (like a LCC HVDC scheme), giving rise to the possibility of hybrid LCC and VSC HVDC systems.

Linear amplifiers will dissipate this energy away, class-D amplifiers {{return it to the}} power supply which should somehow be able to store it. In addition, <b>half-bridge</b> class D amps transfer energy from one supply rail (e.g. the positive rail) to the other (e.g. the negative) depending on the sign of the output current. This happens regardless of whether the load is resistive or not. The supply should either have enough capacitive storage on both rails, or be able to transfer this energy back.|$|E
50|$|MDSHA {{replaced}} Motter Avenue's {{bridge over}} US 15 because the concrete {{deck of the}} old bridge was deteriorating and the four-lane width of the bridge was insufficient for the traffic it carried. The new bridge has four through traffic lanes, bike lanes, and continuous left turn lanes. The replacement bridge is long enough to accommodate future widening of US 15. Construction began in spring 2012 and was completed in the Spring of 2015. The new bridge was built in two sections: {{one half of the}} bridge was constructed immediately {{to the north of the}} old bridge, then traffic was moved to the <b>half-bridge</b> and the old bridge removed, and the other half of the new bridge was constructed in place of the removed bridge.|$|E
50|$|After filming key {{parts of}} the film in Rajasthan, suburbs of Hyderabad, and at Badami in Karnataka, filming {{continued}} in Ramoji Film City in a specially erected set named Bhairavakona in late October 2008. Two more schedules, one from 3-10 December and one in January, were also shot at the Bhairavakona set. The sequence of Charan killing 100 warriors, also at Bhairavakona, included a bridge. As the set did not permit for shooting with low angles, a separate <b>half-bridge</b> was erected at Bhoot Bangla in Road No. 22 of Banjara Hills. The bridge, which had a height of 60 ft and a length of 100 ft, was constructed {{on top of a}} rocky hill using steel beams as the skeleton and wooden material as support. It was built in around 20 days by over 60 men amid heavy rains. 20 trucks of black soil were transported from Ramoji Film City for the bridge set, as that type of soil was only available in the former location.|$|E
50|$|Like the {{two-level}} converter and the six-pulse line-commutated converter, a MMC {{consists of}} six valves, each connecting one AC terminal to one DC terminal. However, where each valve of the two-level converter is effectively a high-voltage controlled switch {{consisting of a}} large number of IGBTs connected in series, each valve of a MMC is a separate controllable voltage source in its own right. Each MMC valve consists of a number of independent converter submodules, each containing its own storage capacitor. In the most common form of the circuit, the <b>half-bridge</b> variant, each submodule contains two IGBTs connected in series across the capacitor, with the midpoint connection and one of the two capacitor terminals brought out as external connections. Depending on which of the two IGBTs in each submodule is turned on, the capacitor is either bypassed or connected into the circuit. Each submodule therefore acts as an independent two-level converter generating a voltage of either 0 or Usm (where Usm is the submodule capacitor voltage). With a suitable number of submodules connected in series, the valve can synthesize a stepped voltage waveform that approximates very closely to a sine-wave and contains very low levels of harmonic distortion.|$|E
