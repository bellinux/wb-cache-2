The character's name is an homage to the 1978 action film <b>Good</b> <b>Guys</b> Wear Black, where Norris plays John T. Booker. During the film, Booker claims to have been bitten by a cobra and states that the cobra later died as a result; this is a reference to Chuck Norris facts, satirical factoids about the actor.|$|E

25|$|It {{is easy to}} {{tell who}} the bad guys are – they are almost {{invariably}} white, male, and middle-class or better, while the <b>good</b> <b>guys</b> are almost invariably non-white, non-male, or non-middle class....

There are few <b>good</b> <b>guys</b> in Thompson's literature: most of his characters are abusive, opportunistic, or simply biding time until an appropriate opportunity for such behavior presents itself, though many also have decent impulses.|$|E

25|$|La Grande Illusion, a 1937 film by Jean Renoir, {{depicts the}} story of two French {{officers}} of the First World War sent to a prisoners’ camp in Germany. They decide to escape by digging a tunnel in perilous conditions. After several aborted escape attempts and repeated transfers, they are placed in a mountain fortress. The story does not portray negative characters: soldiers or guards, the Germans are <b>good</b> <b>guys,</b> while the Allied prisoners perform their duties conscientiously but without excessive heroism. As shown, the prisoners’ camps of 1914-18 do not give the impression of a frightening inferno (at least the officers’ camps).|$|E
25|$|In February, X-Pac {{formed a}} new stable called X-Factor with Justin Credible and Albert. During this time, he usually teamed with Credible, but also {{appeared}} in singles matches. He won the WWF Light Heavyweight Championship from Jeff Hardy on June 25, then won the WCW Cruiserweight Championship {{for the second time}} in his career when he defeated Billy Kidman on July 30. Despite this occurring during the WCW Invasion, where the WWF side was mostly portrayed as the <b>good</b> <b>guys,</b> the fans were vocal in their disapproval of Waltman during his reign. This was acknowledged on-screen by both Alliance member Billy Kidman and, later by WWF member Edge.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the success}} of Upstairs, Downstairs, Langton {{appeared}} in the 1972 BBC Television adaption of Dorothy L.

25|$|With {{their success}} in Memphis, the AWA started to book them as well, having the Midnight Rockers split their time between Memphis and the AWA {{territory}} – in Memphis the Midnight Rockers were heels but in the AWA they were faces (<b>good</b> <b>guys),</b> something which was possible {{before the advent of}} national television deals and easy internet access. On December 27, 1987 The Midnight Rockers defeated The Original Midnight Express (Dennis Condrey and Randy Rose) for the AWA World Tag Team title. Since they had won the AWA World Tag Team titles, Jannetty and Michaels were forced to vacate the AWA Southern Tag Team titles in January 1988. While in the CWA, they had a brief feud with The Rock 'n' Roll Express over the AWA World Tag Team titles. After a short while in the AWA Jannetty and Michaels began asking for more money and a guaranteed contract from owner Verne Gagne. When this request was denied the Midnight Rockers quit the AWA without having found another promotion for which to work. Before they left the promotion, they lost the AWA Tag Team Championship on March 19 to Badd Company (Pat Tanaka and Paul Diamond).|$|E
25|$|Since the {{formation}} of Los Ingobernables ("The Unruly") Rush, La Sombra, La Máscara and Marco Corleone had claimed to be tecnicos diferentes, or {{a different kind of}} <b>good</b> <b>guys,</b> which meant that they did not get along with other tecnico wrestlers but generally fought against rudos. For the Sin Salida show {{that was not the case}} Rush, La Sombra and Marco Corleone faced the tecnico team of Atlantis, Diamante Azul and Volador Jr. and Los Ingobernables clearly played the rudo part of the match, cheating whenever they had a chance including pulling Diamante Azul's mask off at one point and tearing Atlantis' mask apart. With Volador Jr. and La Sombra being bitter rivals for years it was no surprise that the two did not fight a clean match but both Rush and Corleone used underhanded tactics to win the match including a low kick to Volador Jr. to win the third and deciding fall. After the match Volador Jr. challenged La Sombra to put his mask on the line against Volador Jr.'s hair, a challenge turned down by La Sombra as he had already unmasked Volador Jr. Moments later Diamante Azul upped the challenge, Diamante Azul and Volador Jr. against La Sombra and Rush and Azul would put his mask on the line as well. The challenge was not accepted, nor declined by Los Ingorbernables at the time.|$|E
25|$|La Sociedad then waged {{a war on}} AAA, but {{prior to}} their {{scheduled}} four–on–four elimination steel cage match against the promotion, Dorian Roldán and Konnan announced that one of AAA's most popular técnicos (<b>good</b> <b>guys),</b> Cibernético, had decided to abandon the promotion and join La Sociedad instead. This was followed by La Parka finding Octagón bloodied and someone resembling Cibernético driving away on a motorcycle. The two teams were scheduled to face each other on October 1 at Héroes Inmortales IV with La Sociedad being represented by Electroshock, El Zorro, Hernandez and L.A. Park, while Legado AAA was scheduled to consist of Cibernético, Heavy Metal, La Parka and Octagón. Electroshock, the leader of Los Maniacos, had made no official announcement on whether he was joining La Sociedad or not, but agreed {{to take part in}} the match in order to get his hands on Heavy Metal, with whom he had been feuding the past weeks. Prior to the match AAA, buying Konnan and Dorian's claim of Cibernético's turn, replaced him and the injured Octagón in the match with Dark Ozz and Dark Cuervo. In the end Cibernético interfered in the match and helped Legado AAA pick up the win, but refused to celebrate with the victors, due to being upset with them believing he had turned on the company. Cibernético then went on to re–form his old stable Los Bizarros with Amadeus, Escoria, Nygma and Taboo, vowing to show AAA how to really battle La Sociedad.|$|E
