By 1971–1972 a new sensor with a commandable microphone (COMMMIKE III) and another with a vehicle <b>ignition</b> detector (EDET III, which could detect the unshielded <b>ignition</b> systems of gasoline engines) were introduced. In 1972 U.S. dollars the ADSID cost $619.00, the ACOUSID $1,452.00, and the engine detector $2,997.00. During the life of the operation approximately 20,000 sensors were deployed in Laos.|$|E

40|$|Wildfires {{can have}} devastating effects on life, {{property}} and the environment. Official inquiries following major damaging fires often recommend management actions {{to reduce the risk}} of future losses from wildfires. Understanding where wildfires are most likely to occur in the landscape is essential to determining where wildfires pose the greatest risk to people and property. We investigated the spatial patterns of wildfire <b>ignitions</b> at a bioregional scale in New South Wales and Victoria using generalised linear models. We used a combination of social and biophysical variables and examined whether different categories of <b>ignitions</b> respond to different explanatory variables. Human-caused <b>ignitions</b> are the dominant source of <b>ignitions</b> for wildfires in south-eastern Australia and our results showed that for such <b>ignitions,</b> population density was the most important variable for the spatial pattern of <b>ignitions.</b> In future years, more <b>ignitions</b> are predicted in the coastal and hinterland areas due to population increases and climate change effects...|$|R
40|$|Wildfires {{are one of}} {{the major}} {{problems}} in Mediterranean countries, and much effort is done by the governments to dissuade people from starting fires. Public campaigns often promote the idea that the more <b>ignitions</b> the larger the surface burnt will be. This reasoning is, however, not so straightforward. This paper addresses the question of how fire frequency relates to the total area burnt by using a model of fire regime that includes variables such as the number of <b>ignitions,</b> fire fighting capacity, fuel accumulation rates, existence of prescribed burning and meteorological variability. This question was addressed by performing three experimental simulations: effect of the number of potential <b>ignitions,</b> the combined effect of the number of <b>ignitions</b> and extinction capacity, and the non random spatial pattern of fire <b>ignitions.</b> Results showed that a larger number <b>ignitions</b> did not have a great effect on the total area burnt but had an effect in the occurrence of large fires, independently of the extinction capacity and of the spatial distribution of <b>ignitions.</b> An explanation for these findings is provided and management implications of these results are briefly discussed...|$|R
40|$|Burnt area in Portugal {{increased}} in the last decades, contrarily to other southern European countries. On the other hand, the number of wildfire <b>ignitions</b> is increasing in Portugal, Spain and Greece, but in Portugal its occurrence density is much higher. Since 2000 Portugal registered {{an average of about}} 28, 500 fire <b>ignitions</b> every year, and this situation causes an important dispersion of detection and fire fighting resources, contributing to reduce their effectiveness. In order to evaluate the distribution of wildfire <b>ignitions,</b> we analyzed 127, 492 fires detected in Portugal during the period 2001 - 2005 in relation to variables such as population density, proximity to urban areas and road network, land cover types, altitude, causes and final burnt area. Results showed that most part of fire <b>ignitions</b> are concentrated in the north and centre littoral areas, in the most populated municipalities, and were intentionally caused. Although municipalities with more than 100 persons per km 2 only represents 21 % of the territory, they concentrated more than 70 % of fire <b>ignitions</b> occurring in Portugal, but only about 14 % of total burnt area. We verified that 85 % of fire <b>ignitions</b> occurred at less than 500 m from urban areas and 98 % were within a distance of 2 km. Fire <b>ignitions</b> were also located very close to the main roads (70 % at less than 500 m, and 98 % at less than 2 km). Most <b>ignitions</b> were located in agricultural and social/urban areas (60 % and 25 %, respectively), and only 15 % in forested or uncultivated areas (8. 5 % and 6. 5 %, respectively). We verified that about 80 % of <b>ignitions</b> occurred at elevations below 500 meters, and that 85 % of fire <b>ignitions</b> originated a burnt area lower than 1 ha, and only 0. 3 % of them originated large wildfires with 500 hectares or more. These results emphasise the crucial role of human distribution and activity in the spatial distribution of wildfire <b>ignitions,</b> and can be very useful in fire risk management and in prevention strategies implementation...|$|R

A person who has 3 or more DUI convictions and a gap of less than 10 years since the last conviction incurs a fine of $1,000, 6 months imprisonment, a 10-year license suspension, an automobile insurance surcharge of $1,500 a year for 3 years, and installation of an <b>ignition</b> interlock device for 1 to 3 years after license restoration.

30|$|<b>Ignitions</b> by {{indigenous}} peoples were likely a large {{component of the}} presettlement fire record in some PFRs, such as redwood (Greenlee and Langenheim 1990) and oak woodland, and are difficult or impossible to definitively differentiate from lightning <b>ignitions,</b> although fire cause may be inferred from seasonality in some cases (Anderson and Moratto 1996). Some vegetation types in certain areas were probably maintained mostly by presettlement anthropogenic fire regimes, which may have resulted in vegetation type conversions {{in some parts of}} the landscape prior to Euro-American arrival. Widespread indigenous <b>ignitions</b> were probably uncommon in other PFRs, however, such as subalpine forest and desert mixed shrub (Anderson 2005). Regardless, no attempt is made in this assessment to differentiate between lightning and indigenous <b>ignitions.</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We analyse the spatio-temporal {{structure}} of wildfire <b>ignitions</b> in the St Johns River Water Management District in north-eastern Florida. We show, using tools to analyse point patterns (e. g. the L-function), that wildfire events occur in clusters. Clustering {{of these events}} correlates with irregular distribution of fire <b>ignitions,</b> including lightning and human sources, and fuels on the landscape. In addition, we define a relative clustering index that summarizes the amount of clustering over various spatial scales. We carry our analysis in three steps: purely temporal, purely spatial, and spatio-temporal. Our results show that arson and lightning are the leading causes of wildfires in this region and that <b>ignitions</b> by railroad, lightning, and arson are spatially more clustered than <b>ignitions</b> by other accidental causes...|$|R

The first tenant, Data Realty, moved into the location in the fall of 2012. The second building in the new park will be used as a research and testing facility for massive turbo machinery as part of a partnership between the city, General Electric, Great Lakes Capital, Indiana Michigan Power, University of Notre Dame, and the state of Indiana.

40|$|This study {{proposes a}} {{procedure}} for a risk analysis for leakages of flammable refrigerants into a poorly ventilated three-dimensional space. It also presents several test cases of risk analyses on flammability and <b>ignitions</b> to a leaked refrigerant. Concentration of a leaked flammable refrigerant at a leakage window, Cin, {{is determined by}} mass balance, providing information on the capacity of an air-refrigerant mixture, and the leakage rate. Five flammable refrigerants, 2, 3, 3, 3 -tetrafluoropropene (R- 1234 yf), difluoromethane (R- 32), 1, 1 -difluoroethane (R- 152 a), propane (R- 290), and ammonia (R- 717) {{have been used to}} analyze risk of <b>ignitions</b> and flammability. A computational fluid mechanics (CFD) technique has been applied to the present risk analyses, and temporal development of velocity, concentration, and temperature profiles of an air-refrigerant mixture in a three-dimensional space are computed. The obtained concentration profiles are compared with the lower flammability limits to analyze detailed risk of <b>ignitions</b> and flammability. The results of this study demonstrate that risk of <b>ignitions</b> can be investigated successfully based on the current CFD technique. This study furthermore shows that risk of <b>ignitions</b> and flammability is different depending on the flammability characteristics of each refrigerant. This study proposes an indicator, the Safety Index, to evaluate risk of <b>ignitions</b> in individual cases easily as screening of flammability without performing threedimensional calculations based on a CFD technique...|$|R
30|$|The {{logistic}} regression models used by Narayanaraj and Wimberly (2012) examined {{the correlation between}} lightning- and human-caused wildfire <b>ignitions,</b> {{as well as other}} anthropogenic and biophysical factors, causing impacts on forest road corridors in the eastern Cascade Mountains of Washington State. Their study showed that human-caused <b>ignitions</b> were concentrated close to roads, in high road-density areas, and near the WUI. In contrast, lightning-caused <b>ignitions</b> were concentrated in low road-density areas, away from WUI, and in low population density areas. They concluded that roads and their edge effect areas should be acknowledged as a unique type of landscape effect in fire research and management.|$|R
30|$|In {{addition}} to natural factors that promote fire hazard, increased human-caused <b>ignitions,</b> which are highly correlated to population growth, have complicated the situation (Keeley and Fotheringham 2001). Historically, <b>ignitions</b> {{are thought to}} have been the limiting factor in the southern California fire environment. The confluence of events—seasonal or annual drought, high winds, sufficient fuels, and ignitions—required to create a widespread fire (i. e., > 5000 ha) was relatively uncommon. However, with a population of more than 23 million people, <b>ignitions</b> are no longer a limiting factor. Coupled with persistent or recurring droughts in recent years, multiple large fires have become a common occurrence within the region (Keeley and Fotheringham 2001).|$|R

30|$|In fire-prone ecosystems, {{managers}} need {{to understand}} historical fire regimes and the changes therein, as this gives insight into how the vegetation was shaped by fire, fuel accumulation rates (Bond et al. 2005, Kraaij et al. 2013 a), and biodiversity responses to fire (Driscoll et al. 2010). Understanding fire regimes may furthermore assist mitigation of negative effects often associated with anthropogenic fire (Chuvieco et al. 2008), and aid with strategic planning for future fire management (Morgan et al. 2001). Human interference with fire (in the form of <b>ignitions</b> and suppression; Archibald et al. 2009, Fernandes et al. 2012) is often especially evident close to human habitation (Syphard et al. 2007, Archibald et al. 2009, Archibald et al. 2010 b). The effects of anthropogenic <b>ignitions</b> on fire regimes are poorly understood (Bond and Parr 2010) but often occur at higher frequencies than natural <b>ignitions</b> (Brooks and Zouhar 2008) and pre-empt natural <b>ignitions</b> (Bond and Parr 2010). Anthropogenic <b>ignitions</b> may thus result in more frequent fires and additionally modify the seasonality, intensity, and size of fires (Chuvieco et al. 2008). On the contrary, human-induced suppression of fire and fragmentation of habitat {{may result in a}} lack of fires (Archibald et al. 2010 b).|$|R

5|$|Another way of {{estimating}} {{the age of}} the cluster is by looking at the lowest-mass objects. In normal main-sequence stars, lithium is rapidly destroyed in nuclear fusion reactions. Brown dwarfs can retain their lithium, however. Due to lithium's very low <b>ignition</b> temperature of 2.5 × 106 K, the highest-mass brown dwarfs will burn it eventually, and so determining the highest mass of brown dwarfs still containing lithium in the cluster can give an idea of its age. Applying this technique to the Pleiades gives an age of about 115 million years.|$|E

40|$|A goal of fire {{management}} in wilderness {{is to allow}} fire to play its natural ecological role without intervention. Unfortunately, most unplanned <b>ignitions</b> in wilderness are suppressed, {{in part because of}} the risk they might pose to values outside of the wilderness. We capitalize on recent advances in fire risk analysis to demonstrate a risk-based approach for revealing where unplanned <b>ignitions</b> in wilderness pose little risk to nonwilderness values and therefore where fire can be managed for its longer term ecological benefits. Using a large wilderness area as a case study, we conduct an exposure analysis and quantify the potential for unplanned <b>ignitions</b> inside the wilderness area to spread outside the wilderness boundary onto adjacent lands. Results show that, in general, <b>ignitions</b> that occur inside a large core area of the wilderness have very low likelihoods of escaping the wilderness boundary, especially early and late in the fire season. These “windows” may thus represent opportunities for allowing natural fire to occur. We discuss our approach in the broader context of spatial fire risk management and planning across public lands...|$|R
40|$|Fire, {{being both}} {{a natural and}} {{cultural}} phenomenon, presents problems in disentangling the historical effect of humans from that of climate change. Here, we investigate {{the potential impact of}} humans on boreal fire regimes from a perspective of fuels, <b>ignitions</b> and culture. Two ways for a low technology culture to impact the fire regime are as follows: (i) by altering the number of <b>ignitions</b> and their spatial distribution and timing and (ii) by hindering fire spread. Different cultures should be expected to have quite different impacts on the fire regimes. In northern Fennoscandia, there is evidence for fire regime changes associated with the following: a reindeer herding culture associated with few <b>ignitions</b> above the natural; an era of cattle husbandry with dramatically increased <b>ignitions</b> and somewhat higher fire frequency; and a timber exploitation era with decreasing fire sizes and diminishing fire frequency. In other regions of the boreal zone, such schemes can look quite different, but we suggest that {{a close look at the}} resource extraction and land use of different cultures should be part of any analysis of past fire regimes...|$|R
