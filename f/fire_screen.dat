Outside the French windows, the lawn with its array of dahlias and sunflowers glowed in the warm sunlight, and Mrs Jehoram's sunshade stood thereon like a triangle of fire. He thought the Vicar's portrait over the mantel very curious indeed, could not understand what it was there for. [...] "You have yourself round," [...] he said, apropos of the portrait, [...] "Why want yourself flat?" [...] and he was vastly amused at the glass <b>fire</b> <b>screen.</b> He found the oak chairs odd--"You're not square, are you?" [...] he said, when the Vicar explained their use. [...] "We never double ourselves up. We lie about on the asphodel when we want to rest." ...|$|E

50|$|In {{order to}} keep the feet and the calves exposed to the heat from the fire, the <b>fire</b> <b>screen</b> desk usually had the form of a {{miniature}} writing table or a tiny bureau à gradin, with just a few drawers beneath the desktop. As its name indicates, it had a retractable <b>fire</b> <b>screen</b> in the back to protect the user's relatively exposed face from too much heat from the fireplace. The screen was usually made of a pleated or straight piece of heavy fabric, supported by crossed and sliding metallic supports. Many <b>fire</b> <b>screen</b> desks still exist, but the original screens have rarely survived. The metal supports or rods which extended the screens generally have been maintained with the desk. When the bare rods are in their extended position, they form an 'X shape' above the back of the desk.|$|E
