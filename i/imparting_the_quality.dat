Continuous use of the above mentioned equipments in the {{education system}} need the routine auditing activity to keep the facilities in good condition. The routine auditing activity helps in optimal usage of the equipments, diagnosis of the electrical leakage and maintenance of the equipments. This routine auditing activity helps in minimum usage of the power, avoiding the unnecessary waste. The result of the routine auditing and optimal utilization improves the performance of the devices. The life span of the devices will be improved due to this regular auditing activity which results in reduction of the maintenance cost for the institution. This paper contains the techniques suggested for auditing activity in an education system taking Srinivas Institute of Management Studies as an example. The paper contains the study on the electricity distribution system in the education institutions, the various electrical and electronic devices used in the institutions with the individual power consumption, and need for auditing. The paper contains the charts showing the consumption of electricity with respect to time at Srinivas Institute of Management Studies. This paper also contains some suggestions to be implemented where green technology can also be used where ever possible and the methods to minimize the wastage in the system...|$|E

Data mining is used to extract meaningful information and to develop relationships among variables stored in large data set. In this paper, Apriori algorithm is used which extracts the set of rules, specific to each class and analyzes the given data to classify the student based on their performance in academics. Students are classified based on their involvement in doing assignment, internal assessment tests, attendance etc., which helps to predict the performance of the student based on the pattern extracted from the educational database. This would help to identify the average and below average students and to improve their performance to provide good results. This analysis further helps matching organization„s requirement with students profile to provide placement for the students. Also, the interestingness of a rule is measured using lift in itself and as a part in formulae. The range of values that lift may take is used to normalize lift so that it is more effective as a measure of interestingness. This standardization is extended to account for minimum support and confidence thresholds...|$|R

40|$|Assessment of the {{carcinogenic}} potential of chemical agents continues to rely primarily upon the chronic rodent bioassay, a resource-intensive exercise. Recent advances in transgenic technology offer a potential resource conserving approach to carcinogen detection. Incorporation of oncogenes with known {{roles in the}} development of neoplasms into the genomes of laboratory rodents may provide new models with the potential of quickly and accurately separating carcinogenic from noncarcinogenic chemicals. The insertion of the v-Ha-ras oncogene into the genome of FVBN mice <b>imparts</b> <b>the</b> <b>qualities</b> of genetically initiated skin in the transgenic mouse line designated as Tg. AC. The skin of either hemizygous (animals carrying the transgene on 1 allele) or homozygous (transgene copies on both alleles) Tg. AC mice promptly responds to the application of nongenotoxic carcinogens, such as the classical tumor promoting phorbol esters, with the development of squamous papillomas. Tumor production generally begins after 8 - 10 applications of 2. 5 pg/ mouse (3 times/wk) of 12 - 0 -tetradecanoylphorbol 13 -acetate (TPA). Maximal tumor response is usually in evidence within 20 wk. If this transgenic mouse line is to be useful in the identification of carcinogenic chemicals, experimental protocols must be systematically optimized. Experiments were conducted to compare the relative responsiveness of male and female hemizygous and homozygous Tg. AC mice to the dermal application of TPA and the known human leukemogen, benzene. Results revealed shipment-related varia-bilities in the relative responsiveness of hemizygous male and female mice to the application of the proliferative agent. Homozygous mice of both sexes were more reliable and uniform in responsiveness to both TPA and benzene. Therefore, our standard protocol fo...|$|R
30|$|The {{mechanism}} {{behind the}} enhanced UV light fastness of modified TiO 2 by the proposed method is explained as follows. A layer of aluminum-phosphorous compounds, {{and in a}} mixture with hydrous aluminum oxide is deposited {{on the surface of}} the TiO 2 particles. The reagent formed by the co-precipitation of phosphate and alumina forms a coherent coating of aluminum phosphate on the TiO 2 pigment particles when precipitated. Short –O–P–O–Al–O–P– chains are formed in solution during reaction between aluminum compounds and the phosphoric acid. When the pH is raised these short chains condense into longer chains and networks which have high affinity for the pigment surface and cover it completely. Possible deduction is that the modification reduces the generation of oxidizing species, according to the photocatalytic mechanism, at the particle surface either by modifying the intrinsic photocatalytic activity properties of titanium dioxide, thus improving the light fastness. Meanwhile the outer Al 2 O 3 coating will <b>impart</b> <b>the</b> pigmentary <b>qualities</b> such as dispersion, gloss, etc. which are characteristic of micron-sized TiO 2 pigment.|$|R

50|$|Although {{the mounds}} are {{beautiful}} artistic achievements themselves, Adena artists created smaller, more personal pieces of art. Art motifs that became important to many later Native Americans {{began with the}} Adena. Motifs such as the weeping eye and cross and circle design became mainstays in many succeeding cultures. Many pieces of art seemed to revolve around shamanic practices, and the transformation of humans into animals—particularly birds, wolves, bears and deer—and back to human form. This may indicate a belief that <b>the</b> practice <b>imparted</b> <b>the</b> animals' <b>qualities</b> to <b>the</b> wearer or holder of the objects. Deer antlers, both real and constructed of copper, wolf, deer and mountain lion jawbones, and many other objects were fashioned into costumes, necklaces {{and other forms of}} regalia by the Adena. Distinctive tubular smoking pipes, with either flattened or blocked-end mouthpieces, suggest the offering of smoke to the spirits. The objective of pipe smoking may have been altered states of consciousness, achieved through the use of the hallucinogenic plant Nicotiana rustica. All told, Adena was a manifestation of a broad regional increase in the number and kind of artifacts devoted to spiritual needs.|$|R

40|$|Submerged arc strip {{cladding}} {{is often}} used when thickness of clad material is required. The productivity of this process has been improved {{by the use of}} higher welding currents and wider strips. The associated problems were arc blow, increased penetration and poor bead characteristics. Dilution is the parameter that controls almost all qualities of cladding. Magnetic steering reduces penetration, and hence, dilution and arc blow control. Stainless steel cladding on mild steel {{is often used}} to impart corrosion resistance. In such situations, <b>the</b> clad <b>quality</b> is specified by corrosion resistance, ferrite content and good fusion between clad metal and base metal. This paper discusses results of an investigation on the effect of an oscillating magnetic field used to steer the arc in submerged arc strip cladding using 60 X 0. 5 -mm 309 L stainless steel strips, with varying magnetizing flux intensity and dwell time. The resulting test pieces were evaluated for parameters that <b>imparted</b> <b>the</b> best clad <b>quality</b> and <b>the</b> results indicate the following: 1) Magnetic steering of the arc reduces dilution and corrosion rate. 2) Magnetic steering of the arc permits use of higher currents for a given dilution level, thus increasing productivity. 3) Clad metal microstructures of a desirable type are obtained when the arc is magnetically steered. 4) Use of 309 L strips for single layer cladding appears to be satisfactory since ferrite content lies between 5 to 10 % for a variety of welding conditions. 5) The corrosion rate (microns per 24 hours) is linearly related to the dilution percentage of the clad metal...|$|R
