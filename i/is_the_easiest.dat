5|$|Cockatoos {{are popular}} birds in aviculture, but their needs are {{difficult}} to meet. The cockatiel <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>easiest</b> cockatoo species to maintain and {{is by far the}} most frequently kept in captivity. White cockatoos are more commonly found in captivity than black cockatoos. Illegal trade in wild-caught birds contributes to the decline of some cockatoo species in the wild.|$|E

5|$|The {{city also}} has water {{transportation}} that ply the Terengganu River. The lifeline {{between the north}} and south parts of the city are the water taxis more popularly known as bot penambang. Bot penambang are engined, roofed wooden boats made to carry passengers from Seberang Takir Jetty and Pulau Duyong Kecil Jetty to Kuala Terengganu Jetty. It <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>easiest</b> and shortest way to get to the city. There are also ferry services to the resort island of Redang and other small islands, although these services are mainly carried out by modern express ferries. The ferries dock at Syahbandar Jetty, {{just in front of the}} General Post Office.|$|E

5|$|About twenty {{isotopes}} and six {{nuclear isomers}} (excited states of an isotope) of berkelium have been characterized with the mass numbers ranging from 235 to 254. All {{of them are}} radioactive. The longest half-lives are observed for 247Bk (1,380years), 248Bk (over300years) and 249Bk (330days); the half-lives of the other isotopes range from microseconds to several days. The isotope which <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>easiest</b> to synthesize is berkelium-249. This emits mostly soft β-particles which are inconvenient for detection. Its alpha radiation is rather weak – 1.45% {{with respect to the}} β-radiation – but is sometimes used to detect this isotope. The second important berkelium isotope, berkelium-247, is an alpha-emitter, as are most actinide isotopes.|$|E
5|$|The game offers three {{different}} skill levels. Level 1 <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>easiest,</b> as {{it uses a}} simplified room layout missing one of the castles {{and one of the}} mazes, and doesn't include the bat and one of the dragons. Level 2 is the full version of the game, with the various objects appearing in set positions {{at the start of the}} game. Level 3 is similar to Level 2, but the location of the objects is randomized to provide a more challenging game. In addition, the player can use the difficulty switches on the Atari 2600 to further control the game's difficulty by affecting the behavior of the dragons: one switch controls the dragons' bite speed, and one causes them to flee when the player is wielding the sword.|$|E
5|$|Polymorphous light {{eruption}} (PMLE) <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>easiest</b> {{disease to}} mistake for solar urticaria because {{the locations of}} the lesions are similar (the V of the neck and the arms). However, patients with SU are more likely to develop lesions on the face. Also, a reaction with PMLE will take a greater amount of time to appear than with solar urticaria. Lupus erythematosus has been mistaken for SU; however, lesions from lupus erythematosus will take a longer amount of time to go away. Furthermore, when being tested for the two diseases, patients with SU have a reaction immediately while patients with lupus erythematosus will have a delayed reaction. Patients who have experienced solar urticarial symptoms from a young age could mistakenly be thought to have erythropoietic protoporphyria. However, the main symptom for this disease is pain and patients with have been found to have abnormal levels of protoporphyrin in their blood while these levels are normal in SU patients. Finally, cholinergic urticaria, or urticaria induced by heat, can occasionally appear to be solar urticaria because the heat from the sun will cause a person with the disease to have a reaction.|$|E

25|$|The {{radial artery}} <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>easiest</b> {{to use to}} check the heart rate.

This is important mainly in patients with atrial fibrillation, in whom heart beats are irregular and stroke volume is largely different from one beat to another. In those beats following a shorter diastolic interval left ventricle doesn't fill properly, stroke volume is lower and pulse wave is {{not strong enough to}} be detected by palpation on a distal artery like the radial artery. It can be detected, however, by doppler.|$|E
25|$|This {{introductory}} section {{has focused}} on the spacetime of special relativity, since it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>easiest</b> to describe. Minkowski spacetime is flat, takes no account of gravity, is uniform throughout, and serves as nothing more than a static background for the events that take place in it. The presence of gravity greatly complicates the description of spacetime. In general relativity, spacetime is no longer a static background, but actively interacts with the physical systems that it contains. Spacetime curves in the presence of matter, can propagate waves, bends light, and exhibits a host of other phenomena. A few of these phenomena are described in the later sections of this article.|$|E

25|$|Splicing timber piles {{is still}} quite common and <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>easiest</b> {{of all the}} piling {{materials}} to splice. The normal method for splicing is by driving the leader pile first, driving a steel tube (normally 60–100cm long, with an internal diameter no smaller than the minimum toe diameter) half its length onto {{the end of the}} leader pile. The follower pile is then simply slotted into {{the other end of the}} tube and driving continues. The steel tube is simply there to ensure that the two pieces follow each other during driving. If uplift capacity is required, the splice can incorporate bolts, coach screws, spikes or the like to give it the necessary capacity.|$|E
25|$|Terengganu laksa (Malay: Laksa Terengganu) <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>easiest</b> laksa {{recipe that}} is famous among peoples {{from the town}} of Kuala Terengganu of the Terengganu state, located at the east coast of Peninsular Malaysia. The main {{ingredient}} of Terengganu Laksa's sauce is ikan kembong or round scad mackerel that are boiled and minced. The minced fish are fried with onions, garlic, ginger, datil pepper, belacan, kantan flower, Vietnamese coriander or daun kesum, lemon grass and dried tamarind slice. Coconut milk will then be added as the final ingredient and stirred until it is all mixed up and becomes thick. Terengganu Laksa is served just like the Italian spaghetti by adding ulam (raw vegetables) and blended chili on the side. Another variable of Terengganu Laksa is Laksam. The sauce's recipe are exactly the same but the noodles are a bit bigger and flat.|$|E
25|$|There {{are five}} main {{geographical}} {{regions in the}} game; Little Italy (controlled by the Corleone family), Brooklyn (controlled by the Tattaglia family), New Jersey (controlled by the Stracci family), Hell's Kitchen (controlled by the Cuneo family) and Midtown (controlled by the Barzini family). At {{the start of the}} game, the entire map is available for the player to explore, but the game encourages the player to remain in Little Italy, as it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>easiest</b> area of which to gain control. To completely control an area, the player must extort all business and rackets owned by the other families, and take over their warehouses and hubs. Many businesses serve as fronts to rackets, which can be taken over in a similar manner to the front, although {{in the case of a}} racket, the player has the option of simply buying the racket boss out. Rackets yield more money than businesses.|$|E
