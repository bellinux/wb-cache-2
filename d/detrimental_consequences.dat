25|$|Maladaptive {{plasticity}} {{is defined}} as neuroplasticity with negative effects or <b>detrimental</b> <b>consequences</b> in behavior. Movement abnormalities may occur among individuals with and without brain injuries due to abnormal remodeling in central nervous system. Learned non-use is an example commonly seen among patients with brain damage, such as stroke. Patients with stroke learned to suppress paretic limb movement after unsuccessful experience in paretic hand use; this may cause decreased neuronal activation at adjacent areas of the infarcted motor cortex.|$|E
25|$|The use of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) {{has been}} shown to be quite {{effective}} for treating bulimia nervosa (BN) in adults, but little research has been done on effective treatments of BN for adolescents. Although CBT is seen as more cost efficient and helps individuals with BN in self-guided care, Family Based Treatment (FBT) might be more helpful to younger adolescents who need more support and guidance from their families. Adolescents are at the stage where their brains are still quite malleable and developing gradually. Therefore, young adolescents with BN are less likely to realize the <b>detrimental</b> <b>consequences</b> of becoming bulimic and have less motivation to change, which is why FBT would be useful to have families intervene and support the teens. Working with BN patients and their families in FBT can empower the families by having them involved in their adolescent's food choices and behaviors, taking more control of the situation in the beginning and gradually letting the adolescent become more autonomous when they have learned healthier eating habits.|$|E

The unemployment had reached an all-time high of 20% by the end of 2003, just before the European Union membership came to the rescue. As a result of high unemployment, it took at least a decade for the average real pay to reach the level from before 1989 and joining the Union triggered the greatest peacetime wave of permanent economic migration out of the country. The reforms undertaken by the Polish elites were of an overwhelmingly economic character.

500|$|Mazowiecki's government, {{forced to}} deal quickly with {{galloping}} hyperinflation, soon adopted radical economic policies, proposed by Leszek Balcerowicz, which transformed Poland into a functioning market economy under an accelerated schedule. Many Polish state owned enterprises, undergoing privatization, {{turned out to}} be woefully unprepared for capitalist competition and the pace of their accommodation (or attrition) was rapid. The economic reform, a shock therapy accompanied by comprehensive neoliberal restructuring, was in reality an extension of the previous incremental [...] "communist" [...] policies of the 1970s and 1980s, which were now followed by a leap to greatly expanded integration with the global economy with little protection. Among the reform's negative immediate effects were the economic recession and near-paralysis of foreign trade. On longer-term bases, the country experienced quickly rising unemployment and social inequities, as enterprises were liquidated and income was redistributed away from workers and farmers, in favor of the establishment and the entrepreneurial class. A collapse of Polish industry was among the <b>detrimental</b> <b>consequences</b> of fundamental and lasting importance. Labor unions underwent further marginalization; Solidarity activity as a labor union, prioritized in the past, was now suppressed. On the positive side, the market price-income reform balanced the economy and brought inflation under control, the currency stabilized, shortages were eliminated and significant foreign investment began. The shock therapy solutions were often dictated by Western consultants, of whom Jeffrey Sachs was best known but also most criticized.|$|E

500|$|In {{the late}} 1820s, fur trappers of the Hudson's Bay Company {{traveling}} south from Fort Vancouver reached the Klamath River basin. The first party {{to see the}} Klamath River was led by Alexander McLeod {{in the winter of}} 1826–27. In 1828, the Jedediah Smith fur trapping expedition was helped across the Trinity River by the Yurok and camped {{on the east side of}} the Trinity River. His clerk, Harrison G. Rogers, wrote, [...] "Mr. Smith purchases all the beaver furs he can from them," [...] suggesting that beaver were then plentiful on the Trinity. Joseph Grinnell, in Fur-bearing Mammals of California, noted that beaver had been present on other Klamath River tributaries such as the Scott River and Shasta River, and further cited a Fish and Game report of beaver from 1915–1917 on High Prairie Creek at the mouth of the Klamath River near Requa, California. Within a matter of years, the plentiful beavers in the Klamath Basin had been mostly wiped out. Beaver dams had previously been an important factor in stream habitat in the Klamath River watershed, helping to moderate the power of floods and creating extensive wetlands. The loss of the beaver dams resulted in <b>detrimental</b> <b>consequences</b> for watercourses in the basin, exacerbating the power of winter floods, and causing severe erosion. Trapping parties eventually moved southwest into the Sacramento Valley and blazed an extension of the Siskiyou Trail, an early path between the Oregon Territory and San Francisco Bay. Despite the environmental implications, extensive and fertile meadows left behind by the draining of beaver ponds attracted many settlers to the region later on.|$|E

Here, we demonstrate in rat and macaque models that disrupting the interaction between D 1 R and PSD- 95 in the striatum reduces LID development and severity. Single quantum dot imaging revealed that this benefit was achieved primarily by destabilizing D 1 R localization, via increased lateral diffusion followed by increased internalization and diminished surface expression. These findings indicate that altering D 1 R trafficking via synapse-associated scaffolding proteins may be useful in the treatment of dyskinesia in Parkinson's patients...|$|R

Critically, pharmacological blockade of NLRP 3 or IL- 1 β significantly ameliorated the CD 8 + T cell-driven immunopathology in leishmania-infected mice.

Beyond the canonical biosynthetic routes to produce biomass, it is of key importance to focus on metabolic routes that sustain the proliferative capacity through the regulation of other biological means in order to improve in-silico gene essentiality analyses. Polyamines are polycations with central roles in cancer cell proliferation, through the regulation of transcription and translation among other things, but are typically neglected in in silico cancer metabolic models. In this study, we analysed essential genes for the biosynthesis of polyamines. Our analysis corroborates the importance of previously known regulators of the pathway, such as Adenosylmethionine Decarboxylase 1 (AMD 1) and uncovers novel enzymes predicted to be relevant for polyamine homeostasis.

40|$|The {{accumulation}} of damaged or misfolded proteins, if unresolved, {{can lead to}} a <b>detrimental</b> <b>consequence</b> within cells termed proteotoxicity. Since cancerous cells often display elevated protein synthesis and by-product disposal, inhibition of the protein degradation pathways is an emerging approach for cancer therapy. However, the molecular mechanism underlying proteotoxicity remains largely unclear. We show here that inhibition of proteasomal degradation results in an increased oligomerization and activation of caspase- 8 on the cytosolic side of intracellular membranes. This enhanced caspase- 8 oligomerization and activation are promoted through its interaction with the ubiquitin-binding protein SQSTM 1 /p 62 and the microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC 3), which are enriched at intracellular membranes in response to proteo-toxic stress. Silencing LC 3 by shRNA, or the LC 3 mutants defective in membrane localization or p 62 inter-action fail to induce caspase- 8 activation and apoptosis. Our results unveiled a previously unknown mechanism through which disruption of protein homeostasis induces caspase- 8 oligomerization, activation, and apoptosis. Cellular proteins are degraded by two mechanistically con-nected processes: the ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway and the autophagolysosomal pathway (11, 16, 32, 35).
