A hanger {{is a type of}} hunting sword, the only {{remaining}} Scottish example of which was made in Kilmaurs; it is in the keeping of the Kelvingrove Museum in Glasgow. The hanger sword is marked 'Kilmares' and is marked 'DB' for the maker or cutler, David Biggart, who also made knives and forks. This sword is highly ornate with the grip made of tortoiseshell with floral patterns in extremely fine twisted silver wire. <b>Fork</b> <b>over</b> fork, is part of the kilmaurs coat of arms, relating to the history of the village cutlery heritage and for forking out prisoners and those hiding in hay to avoid capture.|$|E
500|$|The Second Fork is {{the largest}} {{tributary}} and rises in Cogan House Township {{near the village of}} White Pine. It runs south through the village of Brookside, then along the east side of Henson Ridge and Puterbaugh Mountain through Cummings and Mifflin Townships. It leaves the dissected Allegheny Plateau at Clapp Point and ends in Salladasburg, where it joins Larrys Creek 5.8miles (9.3km) from the mouth. In 1851 a plank road was built from the mouth along Larrys Creek to Salladasburg, then followed the Second Fork as far as the village of English Centre in Pine Township. There was also a spur along the First Fork into Anthony Township and perhaps further. An 1889 flood destroyed much of the plank road, and it ceased operation as a toll road in 1900. Today Pennsylvania Route 287 follows its course along {{the entire length of the}} Second <b>Fork.</b> <b>Over</b> [...] along it belongs to the private [...] "Larrys Creek Fish and Game Club".|$|E

60|$|Section 37. But as {{certainly}} {{as we have}} no such metameric segmentation, as this older view implies, in the brain-case of the frog, so quite as certainly is metameric segmentation evident in its branchial arches. We have the four gill slits of the tadpole and their bars repeating one another; the hyoid bar in front of these is evidently of a similar nature; and that the ear drum is derived from an imperforate gill slit is enforced {{by the presence of}} an open slit (the spiracle) in the rays and dog-fish in an entirely equivalent position. Does the mouth answer to a further pair of gill slits, and is the jaw arch (palato-pterygoid + Meckel's cartilage) equivalent to the arches that come behind it? This question has been asked, and answered in the affirmative, by many morphologists, but not by any means by all. The cranial nerves have a curious similarity of arrangement with regard to the gill slits and the mouth; the fifth nerve <b>forks</b> <b>over</b> the mouth, the seventh <b>forks</b> <b>over</b> the ear drum, the ninth, in the tadpole and fish, <b>forks</b> <b>over</b> the first branchial slit, and the tenth is, as it were, a leash of nerves, each <b>forking</b> <b>over</b> one of the remaining gill slits. But this matter will be more intelligible when the student has worked over a fish type, and need not detain us any further now.|$|R

60|$|The fifth nerve, has, in the dog-fish, {{as in the}} rabbit, three chief branches. V.2 and V.3 <b>fork</b> <b>over</b> {{the mouth}} {{just as they do}} in the mammal; V.1 passes out of the cranium by a {{separate}} and more dorsal opening, and runs along a groove along the dorsal internal wall of the orbit, immediately beneath a similar branch of VII., which is not distinct in the rabbit. The grooves are shown in the figure of the cranium, Sheet 18; the joint nerve thus compounded of V. and VII. is called the ophthalmic (oph.). It is distributed to the skin above the nose and orbit. When the student commences to dissect the head of a dog-fish he notices over the dorsal surface of the snout an exudation of a yellowish jelly-like substance, and on removing the tough skin over this region and over the centre of the skull he finds, lying beneath it, a quantity of coiling simple tubuli full of such yellowish matter. These tubuli open on the surface by small pores, and the nerves terminate in hair-like extremities in their lining. These sense tubes are peculiar to aquatic forms; allied structures are found over the head and along a lateral line (see below) in the tadpole, but when the frog emerges from the water they are lost. They, doubtless, indicate some unknown sense entirely beyond our experience, and either only possible or only necessary when the animal is submerged.|$|E
60|$|As to {{the train}} crew, we never had any more trouble with them than {{if they had been}} so many sheep. I don't mean that they are cowards; I mean that they have got sense. They know they're not up against a bluff. It's the same way with the officers. I've seen secret service men, marshals, and {{railroad}} detectives <b>fork</b> <b>over</b> their change as meek as Moses. I saw one of the bravest marshals I ever knew hide his gun under his seat and dig up along with the rest while I was taking toll. He wasn't afraid; he simply knew that we had the drop on the whole outfit. Besides, many of those officers have families and they feel that they oughtn't to take chances; whereas death has no terrors for the man who holds up a train. He expects to get killed some day, and he generally does. My advice to you, if you should ever be in a hold-up, is to line up with the cowards and save your bravery for an occasion when it may be of some benefit to you. Another reason why officers are backward about mixing things with a train robber is a financial one. Every time there is a scrimmage and somebody gets killed, the officers lose money. If the train robber gets away they swear out a warrant against John Doe et al. and travel hundreds of miles and sign vouchers for thousands on the trail of the fugitives, and the Government foots the bills. So, with them, {{it is a question of}} mileage rather than courage.|$|E

I've got bills to pay to-morrow for lumber and bricks, and my third will pay 'em. If I don't I'll go to pieces. You don't want to see me break up business, do you?'--'Now, Jerry,' says I, 'that won't do. You haven't got enough to divide into three parts.
