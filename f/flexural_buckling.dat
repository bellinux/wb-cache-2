40|$|Modern {{architecture}} requires {{transparent and}} slender structural elements for columns. Structural steel is a material {{that allows for}} slender columns. However, <b>flexural</b> <b>buckling</b> is usually the dominant failure mode of such columns. If <b>flexural</b> <b>buckling</b> can be suppressed, the full yield stress of the steel may be utilized. It would then make sense to use high-strength steel. In this work, a slender transparent glass-supported high-strength steel column was designed, tested and numerically analysed. It consisted of a 32 mm diameter Dywidag steel bar restrained against <b>flexural</b> <b>buckling</b> by four heat-strengthened float glass panes, thus providing sufficient redundancy, allowing for a glass pane to break without column failure.

Even although this influence is not effectively accounted for in the present available models for web-post buckling, these still turn out to be sufficiently conservative to be applied in column design.

The nonlinear behaviour of stainless steel grades is not usually considered when extending design expressions codified for carbon steel to these alloyed materials, leading to overconservative design approaches and the applicability of the different design expressions initially developed for carbon steel needs to be adjusted for every stainless steel grade. The study of stainless steel elements subjected to combined <b>flexural</b> <b>buckling</b> and bending moment loading conditions only covers the most usual austenitic, duplex and lean duplex grades, but experimental results on ferritic grades are still necessary to complete the analysis.

40|$|Plated {{structures}} {{are widely used}} in many engineering structures. Most designs are poor in resisting compressive forces. Usually, the buckling phenomena observed in compressed conditions take place rather suddenly and may lead to catastrophic structural failure. Therefore {{it is important to}} know the buckling capacities of the plates and stiffeners in order to avoid premature failure. However not every model and/or analysis is suitable for an accurate buckling assessment by a FEM analysis. Buckling is a complicated phenomenon. Many properties and parameters influence the buckling strength. Most of the time, details such as imperfections, material properties or residual stresses are not included within the model. Hence, the lack of a satisfying analysis is tried to resolve with a combination of linear FEM results and standards. In the standards, just as in most literature, the behaviour of a panel is simplified by subdividing it into individual sections; plate fields and beam-columns. This study mainly aims to define the conversion of linear FEM stress results into input design stresses needed to check buckling of plated structures with the standards. The report first contains an in-depth research into what problems arise with different buckling modes and the parameters that define these problems. Furthermore several proposals for implementation of the standards are explained; plate buckling, local stiffener <b>buckling,</b> <b>flexural</b> stiffener <b>buckling</b> and torsional stiffener buckling. A more extensive part is about the validation of the plate buckling implementation. Linearization of in-plane stress distributions on plate fields is researched.

As {{it is well known}} stocky bars with the above type of cross-sections always fail by flexural-torsional buckling in the case of asymmetric cross-sections (whose centroid does not coincide with the shear centre), while in the case of monosymmetric cross-sections the failure may occur either through <b>flexural</b> (Euler) <b>buckling</b> or flexural-torsional buckling depending on the geometric characteristics of the bars. In all the above three cases the critical state is associated with postbuckling strength. In this paper attention focuses on the first yielding occurring at the initial part of the post-critical path of flexural-torsional buckling. This is, in case of bars made from ideal elastic-ideal plastic material, associated with the maximum combined normal stress, due to axial compression, bending and warping, which, along with the nonlinear equilibrium equation, yield the maximum (ultimate) elastic load-carrying capacity.

The stiffness properties of electrode arrays, which were determined by three-point <b>flexural</b> bending and <b>buckling</b> tests, are reported in this paper. To date there has been limited publication on mechanical properties of these electrode arrays. Previous studies mainly focused on characterizing the stiffness of {{the tip of the}} Nucleus straight array with little emphasis on characterizing the stiffness of its whole length. In this study, stiffnesses of the Nucleus straight and contour electrode arrays have been determined along their length. Young’s modulus of elasticity of the Nucleus straight array has been found to increase from the tip (182 MPa) to the rear end (491 MPa), whereas the stiffness of the contour array is greatest near the tip (480 MPa) and is fairly uniform in the middle and rear sections of the electrode array (380 - 400 MPa).

Design standards provide guidelines for columns subject to flexural-torsional buckling modes at ambient temperature. However, there are no specific design guidelines for elevated temperature conditions. Hence extensive research efforts have gone into the many investigations addressing the flexural-torsional buckling behaviour of cold-formed steel columns at elevated temperatures. This research has reviewed the accuracy of the current design rules in AS/NZS 4600 and the North American Specification in determining the member capacities of cold-formed steel columns using the results from detailed finite element analyses and an experimental study of lipped channel columns. It was found that the current ambient temperature Australian and American design rules accurately predicted the member capacities of pin ended lipped channel columns undergoing <b>flexural</b> torsional <b>buckling</b> at elevated temperatures by simply using the appropriate elevated temperature mechanical properties. However, for fixed ended columns with warping fixity undergoing flexural-torsional buckling, {{it was found that the}} current design rules significantly underestimated the column capacities as they disregard the beneficial effect of warping fixity. This research has therefore proposed improved design rules and verified their accuracy using finite element analysis and test results of cold-formed lipped channel columns made of three cross-sections and five different steel grades and thicknesses. This paper presents the details of this research study and the results...|$|R
