50|$|There are two {{different}} glow plug types: the <b>in-cylinder</b> variety and the in-manifold ("Thermostart") variety. In the case of <b>in-cylinder,</b> there is a plug in every cylinder direct injected (or {{in the case of}} indirect injected, the glow plug is in the prechamber providing a hot spot to encourage ignition. In the case of the in-manifold one, there is only one for all the cylinders.|$|E
5000|$|... 1878: Dugald Clerk {{designed}} the first two-stroke engine with <b>in-cylinder</b> compression. He patented it in England in 1881.|$|E
5000|$|HCCI engines have a {{small power}} range, {{constrained}} at low loads by lean flammability limits and high loads by <b>in-cylinder</b> pressure restrictions.|$|E
5000|$|Autoignition is {{difficult}} to control, unlike the ignition event in SI and diesel engines, which are controlled by spark plugs and <b>in-cylinder</b> fuel injectors, respectively.|$|E
5000|$|... 1838: A patent {{was granted}} to William Barnett, UK patent no. 7615 April 1838. According to Dugald Clerk, {{this was the}} first {{recorded}} use of <b>in-cylinder</b> compression.|$|E
50|$|<b>In-cylinder</b> linear {{displacement}} transducers (LDTs) {{have been}} used with limited success in mobile equipment to achieve these goals. A limitation to most <b>in-cylinder</b> LDTs is that the hydraulic cylinder’s piston rod must be bored through its center to accommodate certain elements of the LDT — usually the waveguide tube of a magnetostrictive transducer. The machining and additional production steps associated with “gun drilling” the piston rod add substantial cost to the finished cylinder. And although magnetostrictive LDTs provide extremely high accuracy, this accuracy usually {{is much greater than}} is needed for most mobile equipment applications.|$|E
5000|$|Controlling the {{effective}} compression ratio: VVA on intake {{can control the}} point at which the intake valve closes. Retarding past bottom dead center (BDC), changes the compression ratio, altering the <b>in-cylinder</b> pressure-time envelope.|$|E
5000|$|Net {{indicated}} mean {{effective pressure}} (IMEPn) - Mean effective pressure calculated from <b>in-cylinder</b> pressure over the complete engine cycle (720° in a four-stroke, 360° in a two-stroke). Direct measurement requires cylinder pressure sensing equipment.|$|E
5000|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} (CO) and hydrocarbon (HC) pre-catalyst {{emissions are}} higher than a typical spark ignition engine, caused by incomplete oxidation (due to the rapid combustion event and low <b>in-cylinder</b> temperatures) and trapped crevice gases, respectively.|$|E
5000|$|Gross {{indicated}} mean {{effective pressure}} (IMEPg) - Mean effective pressure calculated from <b>in-cylinder</b> pressure over compression and expansion portion of engine cycle (360° in a four-stroke, 180° in a two-stroke). Direct measurement requires cylinder pressure sensing equipment.|$|E
50|$|Once ignited, {{combustion}} occurs very quickly. When auto-ignition occurs {{too early}} or {{with too much}} chemical energy, combustion is too fast and high <b>in-cylinder</b> pressures can destroy an engine. For this reason, HCCI is typically operated at lean overall fuel mixtures.|$|E
50|$|The engine {{features}} chain-driven DOHC valvetrain with hydraulic tensioners, twin balance shafts {{in the oil}} pump and electronically controlled variable-geometry turbocharger; the common rail system operates at pressures of up to 1,800 bar, maximum <b>in-cylinder</b> pressure is 180 bar, improving on power and torque. Compression ratio is 16.5:1.|$|E
50|$|Computational {{models for}} {{simulating}} combustion and heat release rates of HCCI engines require detailed chemistry models. This is largely because ignition is {{more sensitive to}} chemical kinetics than to turbulence/spray or spark processes as are typical in SI and diesel engines. Computational models have demonstrated the importance of accounting {{for the fact that}} the <b>in-cylinder</b> mixture is actually in-homogeneous, particularly in terms of temperature. This in-homogeneity is driven by turbulent mixing and heat transfer from the combustion chamber walls. The amount of temperature stratification dictates the rate of heat release and thus tendency to knock. This limits the usefulness of considering the <b>in-cylinder</b> mixture as a single zone, resulting in the integration of 3D computational fluid dynamics codes such as Los Alamos National Laboratory's KIVA CFD code and faster solving probability density function modelling codes.|$|E
5000|$|Since {{the onset}} of knock is {{sensitive}} to the <b>in-cylinder</b> pressure, temperature and autoignition chemistry associated with the local mixture compositions within the combustion chamber, simulations which account {{for all of these}} aspects [...] have thus proven most effective in determining knock operating limits and enabling engineers to determine the most appropriate operating strategy.|$|E
5000|$|Controlling {{the amount}} of hot exhaust gas {{retained}} in the combustion chamber: VVA can control {{the amount of}} hot EGR within the combustion chamber, either by valve re-opening or changes in valve overlap. Balancing the percentage of cooled external EGR with the hot internal EGR generated by a VVA system, {{makes it possible to}} control the <b>in-cylinder</b> temperature.|$|E
5000|$|Pumping mean {{effective}} pressure (PMEP) - Mean {{effective pressure}} from work moving air {{in and out of}} the cylinder, across the intake and exhaust valves. Calculated from <b>in-cylinder</b> pressure over intake and exhaust portions of engine cycle (360° in a four-stroke, 0° in a two-stroke). Direct measurement requires cylinder pressure sensing equipment. PMEP = IMEPg - IMEPn.|$|E
50|$|Fuel {{economy is}} heavily {{dependent}} upon engine efficiency, {{which in turn}} depends {{to a large degree}} on how fuel is burned within the cylinders of the engine. Higher <b>in-cylinder</b> pressures and temperatures lead to increased fuel economy, but they also create more difficulty in controlling the combustion process. Poorly controlled and incomplete combustion can cause higher levels of emissions and lower engine efficiencies.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} {{optimize}} combustion processes, engine designers have traditionally undertaken manual engine modifications, conducted testing, and analyzed the results. This iterative process is painstakingly slow, costly, {{and does not}} lend itself to identifying the optimal engine design specifications. In response to these problems, Los Alamos National Laboratory scientists developed KIVA, an advanced computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling code that accurately simulates the <b>in-cylinder</b> processes of engines.|$|E
50|$|After {{retirement}} from the Army, living in Switzerland, he invented a primitive {{internal combustion engine}} which he constructed in 1807. It was powered by a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen manually ignited by electric spark, but the engine neither involved the <b>in-cylinder</b> compression, the crank, nor the connecting rod. A year later, Isaac built an early automobile for his new engine to power. His engine was never commercially successful.|$|E
50|$|The first {{commercial}} two-stroke engine involving <b>in-cylinder</b> compression {{is attributed to}} Scottish engineer Dugald Clerk, who patented his design in 1881. However, unlike most later two-stroke engines, his had a separate charging cylinder. The crankcase-scavenged engine, employing the area below the piston as a charging pump, is generally credited to Englishman Joseph Day. The first truly practical two-stroke engine is attributed to Yorkshireman Alfred Angas Scott, who started producing twin-cylinder water-cooled motorcycles in 1908.|$|E
50|$|In {{internal}} combustion engines, {{exhaust gas recirculation}} (EGR) is a nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions reduction technique used in petrol/gasoline and diesel engines. EGR works by recirculating a portion of an engine's exhaust gas back to the engine cylinders. This dilutes the O2 in the incoming air stream and provides gases inert to combustion to act as absorbents of combustion heat to reduce peak <b>in-cylinder</b> temperatures. NOx is produced in a narrow band of high cylinder temperatures and pressures.|$|E
50|$|Otto {{turned his}} {{attention}} to the 4-stroke cycle largely due to the efforts of Franz Rings and Herman Schumm, brought into the company by Gottlieb Daimler. It is this engine (the Otto Silent Engine), and not the Otto & Langen engine, to which the Otto cycle refers. This was the first commercially successful engine to use <b>in-cylinder</b> compression (as patented by William Barnett in 1838). The Rings-Schumm engine appeared in autumn 1876 and was immediately successful.|$|E
5000|$|Advancing {{the start}} of {{injection}} (injecting before the piston reaches to its SOI-TDC) results in higher <b>in-cylinder</b> pressure and temperature, and higher efficiency, but also results in increased engine noise due to faster cylinder pressure rise and increased oxides of nitrogen (NOx) formation due to higher combustion temperatures. Delaying start of injection causes incomplete combustion, reduced fuel efficiency {{and an increase in}} exhaust smoke, containing a considerable amount of particulate matter and unburned hydrocarbons. {citation needed} ...|$|E
5000|$|A {{small number}} of designs used a [...] "cuff" [...] sleeve in the {{cylinder}} head instead of the cylinder proper, providing a more [...] "classic" [...] layout compared to traditional poppet valve engines. This design also {{had the advantage of}} not having the piston within the sleeve, although in practice this appears to have had little practical value. On the downside, this arrangement limited the size of the ports to that of the cylinder head, whereas <b>in-cylinder</b> sleeves could have much larger ports.|$|E
50|$|The {{operational}} characteristics of free-piston engines {{differ from those}} of conventional, crankshaft engines. The main difference is due to the piston motion not being restricted by a crankshaft in the free-piston engine, leading to the potentially valuable feature of variable compression ratio. This does, however, also present a control challenge, since the position of the dead centres must be accurately controlled in order to ensure fuel ignition and efficient combustion, and to avoid excessive <b>in-cylinder</b> pressures or, worse, the piston hitting the cylinder head.|$|E
5000|$|Otto {{turned his}} {{attention}} to the 4-stroke cycle which he had failed at in 1862. Largely due to the efforts of Franz Rings and Herman Schumm, who were brought into the company by Gottlieb Daimler Otto succeeds in making the Four Stroke, Compressed Charge engine. It is this engine (the Otto Silent Engine), and not the Otto & Langen engine, to which the [...] "Otto cycle" [...] refers. This was the first commercially successful engine to use <b>in-cylinder</b> compression. The Rings-Schumm engine appeared in autumn 1876 and was immediately successful.|$|E
5000|$|With <b>in-cylinder</b> glow plugs, when a pre-set {{time has}} elapsed, the {{glowplug}} relay switches off the [...] "wait-to-start" [...] light. A pre-heating cycle usually lasts for 2 to 5 seconds. The operator then proceeds {{to turn the}} key to the [...] "start" [...] position. The relay switches off the glowplugs after the engine is running (or, in older cars, {{at the same time the}} [...] "wait to start" [...] light goes out). In some cars, in order to maintain compliance with emissions regulations, the glow plugs may be operated immediately after engine start, or during periods of extended idle where engine temperature has decreased, as combustion efficiency is greatly reduced when the engine is below operating temperature.|$|E
5000|$|Wheal Vor (mine) {{had one of}} the {{earliest}} Newcomen engines (<b>in-cylinder</b> condensing engines, utilising sub-atmospheric pressure) before 1714, but Cornwall has no coalfield and coal imported from south Wales was expensive. The cost of fuel for pumping was thus a significant part of mining costs. Later, many of the more efficient early Watt engines (using an external condenser) were erected by Boulton and Watt in Cornwall. They charged the mine owners a royalty based on a share of the fuel saving. The fuel efficiency of an engine was measured by its [...] "duty", expressed in the work (in foot-pounds) generated by a bushel (94 lb) of coal. Early Watt engines had a duty of 20 million, and later ones over 30 million.|$|E
5000|$|Lemuel Wright is also {{responsible}} {{for one of the}} very early patents for internal combustion engines, British patent number 6525 of 1833. One of the earliest sources to describe his engine and patent is the scientist and engineer Dugald Clerk (later Sir Dugald Clerk FRS) in his book [...] "Gas and Oil Engines" [...] first published in 1886. Dugald Clerk is the creator of the first commercial engine operating on the 2-stroke cycle with <b>in-cylinder</b> compression, and is often considered to be the originator of the modern 2-stroke engine. In summarising the importance of patents prior to 1860 (when the internal combustion became a commercial reality), Clerk states : [...] "The greatest credit is due to Wright and Barnett. Wright very closely proposed the modern non-compression system, Barnett the modern compression system.".|$|E
50|$|The {{purpose of}} the divided {{combustion}} chamber is {{to speed up the}} combustion process, in order to increase the power output by increasing engine speed. The addition of a prechamber, however, increases heat loss to the cooling system and thereby lowers engine efficiency. The engine requires glow plugs for starting. In an indirect injection system the air moves fast, mixing the fuel and air. This simplifies injector design and allows the use of smaller engines and less tightly toleranced designs which are simpler to manufacture and more reliable. Direct injection, by contrast, uses slow-moving air and fast-moving fuel; both the design and manufacture of the injectors is more difficult. The optimisation of the <b>in-cylinder</b> air flow is much more difficult than designing a prechamber. There is much more integration between the design of the injector and the engine. It {{is for this reason that}} car diesel engines were almost all indirect injection until the ready availability of powerful CFD simulation systems made the adoption of direct injection practical.|$|E
5000|$|In older {{generation}} diesel-engine vehicles, unlike in a gasoline-engine vehicle, for a 'cold start' the operator did not simply turn {{the key to}} the [...] "start" [...] position and have the engine immediately start. Instead, the operator activated the glow plug(s) for a time first. Early diesels used the 'Thermostart' type glowplug in the inlet manifold. These take 20 seconds to achieve working temperature and the vehicle operator had to manually time (or guess) when the 20 seconds had elapsed. With <b>in-cylinder</b> glow plugs, technological improvements included a warning light on the dash to indicate how long the preheating should last. The preheating phase was also made to be automatically activated when the operator turned {{the key to the}} [...] "on" [...] position for a long duration; the glowplug relay switches the glowplugs on, and a light (see picture at right) on the instrument cluster illuminates. This process is called [...] "pre-heating" [...] or [...] "glowing". Many modern diesels automatically activate their glow plugs when the operator unlocks the vehicle or opens the door to the car, thus simplifying the process and shortening the time the operator has to wait before the engine will start. According to Bosch: [...] "Older engines with Thermostart manifold plugs used a glow period of up to 20 seconds whereas more modern engines use around a 6 to 8 second heat period and provide after glow at a reduced voltage." ...|$|E
