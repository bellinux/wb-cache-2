30|$|This {{critical}} review {{is based on}} a qualitative analysis of a range of policy documents (1971 - present) formulated by the different governments in the education sector at the state level in Bangladesh. The policy documents included a number of national education policies as well as <b>commission</b> <b>reports,</b> including the Bangladesh Education <b>Commission</b> <b>Report</b> - 1974, the English Teaching Taskforce Commission - 1976, the Bangladesh National Education <b>Commission</b> <b>Report</b> - 1988, the National Curriculum Committee - 1991, the National Education Policy - 2000, the Bari <b>Commission</b> <b>Report</b> - 2002, the Miah <b>Commission</b> <b>Report</b> - 2004, and the National Education Policy - 2010. Policy documents can be treated as primary resources (Prior [2011]) to explore the historical development of English education and how English has played out in the education system in Bangladesh. Instead of attempting to understand positivist ‘what’ questions, we have asked constructivist ‘why’ questions (Darlaston-Jones [2007]) to unearth underlying ideologies and power relations embedded in the policies and reports. This approach allowed us to go beyond the physical entity of the documents to gain insights into the surrounding sociocultural and political contexts surrounding the production of these policy documents.|$|R
