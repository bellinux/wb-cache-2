5|$|Participation in the Premier League by some Scottish or Irish clubs <b>has</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>been</b> discussed, {{but without}} result.|$|E
5|$|An {{isolated}} {{population in}} Crimea <b>has</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>been</b> separated as T. v. tauricus, {{but this is}} not considered to be a valid form. Mistle thrush fossils have been found in Pleistocene deposits from Poland and Sicily.|$|E
5|$|Because LARP {{involves}} a controlled artificial environment within which people interact, it <b>has</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>been</b> {{used as a}} research tool to test theories in social fields such as economics or law. For example, LARP {{has been used to}} study the application of game theory to the development of criminal law.|$|E

5|$|Brideshead Revisited (1981), {{based on}} Waugh's novel; a miniseries {{enormously}} popular in Britain and America, the film <b>has</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>been</b> seen as drawing unwanted attention to Oxford's stereotypical {{reputation as a}} playground for the upper class. It stars Jeremy Irons and most college shots are of Christ Church and Hertford.|$|E
5|$|Hard rock <b>has</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>been</b> {{labelled}} cock {{rock for}} {{its emphasis on}} overt masculinity and sexuality and because it has historically been predominantly performed and consumed by men: {{in the case of}} its audience, particularly white, working-class adolescents.|$|E
5|$|The exact {{parentage}} of Domentziolus is unclear: Phocas had two known brothers, Comentiolus {{and another}} also named Domentziolus, who <b>has</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>been</b> suggested as the younger Domentziolus's father. Shortly after the accession of Phocas, in 603, the younger Domentziolus {{was raised to}} the titles of vir gloriosissimus, patricius and curopalates.|$|E

5|$|The term fluffernutter <b>has</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>been</b> used disparagingly to {{describe}} something that lacks substance and has minimal to no cultural value. On the other hand, some writers look on Fluffernutters and marshmallow fluff {{as a source}} of childhood nostalgia and regional pride.|$|E
5|$|Although {{this bird}} eats rice on the {{wintering}} grounds, {{where it can}} make up nearly 40% of its diet, it takes mainly waste and residues from cropping and threshing, not harvestable grain. It <b>has</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>been</b> viewed as a pest, but the deeper water and presence of invertebrate prey in the economically important early winter period means that the wader has little effect on crop yield.|$|E
5|$|Bromine <b>has</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>been</b> {{considered}} to be possibly essential in humans, but this is supported by only limited circumstantial evidence, and no clear biological role. As a pharmaceutical, the simple bromide ion (Br−) has inhibitory effects on the central nervous system, and bromide salts were once a major medical sedative, before replacement by shorter-acting drugs. They retain niche uses as antiepileptics.|$|E

5|$|The Irish {{national}} broadcaster, Radio Telefís Éireann (RTÉ), broadcasts {{the event}} {{each year and}} organizes the selection process for the entry. Many methods of selection have been used, with the most common method used by RTÉ being a national final featuring a multi-artist, multi-song selection in which regional juries, and later the public, chooses the winner. In recent years the artist <b>has</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>been</b> selected internally by RTÉ, with the song being chosen by the public.|$|E
5|$|The astronomical {{symbol for}} Venus {{is the same}} as that used in biology for the female sex: a circle with a small cross beneath. The Venus symbol also {{represents}} femininity, and in Western alchemy stood for the metal copper. Polished copper has been used for mirrors from antiquity, and the symbol for Venus <b>has</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>been</b> understood to stand for the mirror of the goddess.|$|E
5|$|The {{brown creeper}} <b>has</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>been</b> {{considered}} to be a subspecies of Eurasian treecreeper, but has closer affinities to short-toed treecreeper, and is normally now treated as a full species. Hodgson's treecreeper is a more recent proposed split following studies of its cytochrome b mtDNA sequence and song structure that indicate that it may well be a distinct species from C. familiaris.|$|E

5|$|By {{the nineteenth}} century, Jannon's {{matrices}} {{had come to}} be known as the Caractères de l'Université (Characters of the University). It <b>has</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>been</b> claimed that this term was an official name designated for the Jannon type by Cardinal Richelieu, while Warde in 1926 more plausibly suggested it might be a garbled recollection of Jannon's work with the Sedan Academy, which operated much like a university despite not using the name. Carter in the 1970s followed this conclusion. Mosley, however, concludes that no report of the term (or much use of Jannon's matrices at all) exists before the nineteenth century, and it may originate from a generic term of the eighteenth century simply meaning older or more conservative typeface designs, perhaps those preferred in academic publishing.|$|E
5|$|Charles XI <b>has</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>been</b> {{described}} in Sweden {{as the greatest}} of all the Swedish kings, except for Gustavus II Adolphus, unduly eclipsed by his father and his son. In {{the first half of the}} 20th century, the view of him changed and he was regarded as dependent, uncertain, and easily influenced by others. In the most recent book, Rystads biography from 2003, the king is again characterized as a strong-willed shaper of Sweden through economic reforms and achievement of financial and military stability and strength.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{his large}} number of works on Christian themes, Britten <b>has</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>been</b> thought of as agnostic. Pears said that when they met in 1937 {{he was not sure}} whether or not Britten would have {{described}} himself as a Christian. In the 1960s Britten called himself a dedicated Christian, though sympathetic to the radical views propounded by the Bishop of Woolwich in Honest to God. Politically, Britten was on the left. He told Pears that he always voted either Liberal or Labour and could not imagine ever voting Conservative, but he was never a member of any party, except the Peace Pledge Union.|$|E
25|$|The ternary and {{balanced}} ternary systems <b>have</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>been</b> used. They are both base3 systems.|$|R

5|$|Greed <b>has</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>been</b> {{said to be}} over 100 reels long. Stroheim {{said that}} his initial edit was 42 reels, {{although}} several {{of the people who}} saw this cut remembered it as being anywhere from 42 to 47 reels. Grant Whytock remembered the edited version that Stroheim initially sent to him as between 26 and 28 reels. MGM's official studio files list the original cut of the film at 22 reels. As recently as 1992, former MGM Story Editor Samuel Marx erroneously claimed that the original version of Greed was 70 reels.|$|E
5|$|Historically, the Bedford Estate {{defined the}} {{boundary}} of Covent Garden, with Drury Lane to the east, the Strand to the south, St Martin's Lane to the west, and Long Acre to the north. However, over time the area regarded as part of Covent Garden has expanded northwards past Long Acre to High Holborn. Since 1971, {{with the creation of}} the Covent Garden Conservation Area which incorporated part of the area between St Martin's Lane and Charing Cross Road, Charing Cross Road <b>has</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>been</b> taken as its western boundary. Long Acre is the main thoroughfare, running north-east from St Martin's Lane to Drury Lane. Shelton Street, running parallel to the north of Long Acre, marks the London borough boundary between Camden and Westminster.|$|E
5|$|In modern times, {{the vampire}} is {{generally}} {{held to be}} a fictitious entity, although belief in similar vampiric creatures such as the chupacabra still persists in some cultures. Early folk belief in vampires <b>has</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>been</b> ascribed to the ignorance of the body's process of decomposition after death and how people in pre-industrial societies tried to rationalise this, creating {{the figure of the}} vampire to explain the mysteries of death. Porphyria was also linked with legends of vampirism in 1985 and received much media exposure, but has since been largely discredited.|$|E
50|$|Although not closely related, they <b>have</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>been</b> {{compared}} to piscivorous Bathybates cichlids of Lake Tanganyika.|$|R
