2500|$|The role of glide wax is {{to adapt}} and improve the {{friction}} properties of a ski base to the expected snow properties to be encountered on a spectrum from cold crystalline snow to saturated <b>granular</b> <b>snow.</b> [...] Modern ski bases often are made from ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPE). Kuzmin asserts that UHMWPE is non-porous and can hold neither wax nor water, {{so there is no}} possibility for filling pores; furthermore, he asserts that UHMWPE is very hydrophobic, which means that wet snow does not appreciably retard the ski and that glide wax offers little additional ability to repel water. He notes that clear bases are more durable and hydrophobic than those with carbon content. The same author asserts that texture is more important than surface chemistry for creating the optimum balance between a running surface that's too dry (not slippery enough) and too wet (ski subject to suction forces). In warm, moist snow, texture can help break the retarding capillary attraction between the ski base and the snow. Giesbrecht agrees that low wetting angle of the ski base is key and also emphasizes the importance of the degree of surface roughness at the micrometre scale as a function of snow temperature—cold snow favoring a smoother surface and wetter, warmer snow favoring a textured surface.|$|E

50|$|Louis Lliboutry {{noted that}} the key climatic {{condition}} for the differential ablation {{that leads to the}} formation of penitentes is that the dew point is always below freezing. Thus, snow will sublimate. Once the process of differential ablation starts, the surface geometry of the evolving penitente produces a positive feedback mechanism, and radiation is trapped by multiple reflections between the walls. The hollows become almost a black body for radiation, while decreased wind leads to air saturation, increasing dew point temperature and the onset of melting. In this way peaks, where mass loss is due only to sublimation, will remain, as well as the steep walls, which intercept only a minimum of solar radiation. In the troughs, the ablation is enhanced, leading to a downward growth of penitentes. A mathematical model of the process has been developed by Betterton, although the physical processes at the initial stage of penitente growth, from <b>granular</b> <b>snow</b> to micropenitentes, still remain unclear. The effect of penitentes on the energy balance of the snow surface, and therefore their effect on snow melt and water resources has also been studied.|$|E

The lake drains a catchment area of the Ramam watershed (Ramam mountain gives its name to the valley) and has a drainage area of 12 km2 (including area of bog of 70100 m2. The periphery of lake has the shape of a foot. The surface water spread area of the lake is 3.79 ha. The depth of water in the lake varies from 3.2 - 11.2 m with an average depth of 7.2 m. It is also inferred from a visual observation of the lake that it has undergone changes in its size due to encroachment due to peripheral vegetation and eutrophication, and its original size could have been three times of its present size. The lake's water spread, which was 7.4 ha in 1963 reduced to 3.8 ha in 1997 and consequently the peatland (bog) increased from 3.4 - 7 ha.

To help protect people, infrastructure, and lifelines against such disasters, it is critical to: a.) control the path and/or redirect flow when potential interaction with the built environment exists, and b.) have engineered structures {{that are capable of}} resisting the loads imparted by a landslide. Capturing the mechanical behavior and structural interaction is challenging [...] -as these flow events are highly dynamic, unpredictable, and inherently complex in nature. This dissertation presents the Material Point Method (MPM) as a continuum-based tool for modeling landslides and other flow-like events, with an emphasis on capturing the force interaction between the flow and rigid structures. Key challenges arising in this context are the ability to: a.) ~model the transition between solid and fluid-like behavior within a single numerical environment, b.) ~develop constitutive frameworks that can accommodate extremely large deformations while remaining computationally efficient and numerically stable, and c.) account for the different phases and constituents that comprise these events This research addresses these challenges and includes an anti-locking enhancement designed to improve kinematics {{and the quality of the}} stress field, a volume constraint for multiphase simulations, and an evaluation of different elasto-plastic material models suitable for large deformation analyses of granular materials.

40|$|The "Self-organized criticality" (SOC), {{introduced}} in 1987 by Bak, Tang and Wiesenfeld, {{was an attempt}} to explain the 1 /f noise, but it rapidly evolved towards a more ambitious scope: explaining scale invariant avalanches. In two decades, phenomena as diverse as earthquakes, <b>granular</b> piles, <b>snow</b> avalanches, solar flares, superconducting vortices, sub-critical fracture, evolution, and even stock market crashes have been reported to evolve through scale invariant avalanches. The theory, based on the key axiom that a critical state is an attractor of the dynamics, presented an exponent close to - 1 (in two dimensions) for the power-law distribution of avalanche sizes. However, the majority of real phenomena classified as SOC present smaller exponents, i. e., larger absolute values of negative exponents, a situation that has provoked a lot of confusion in the field of scale invariant avalanches. The main goal of this chapter is to shed light on this issue. The essential role of the exponent value of the power-law distribution of avalanche sizes is discussed. The exponent value controls the ratio of small and large events, the energy balance [...] required for stationary systems [...] and the critical properties of the dynamics. A condition of criticality is introduced. As the exponent value decreases, there is a decrease of the critical properties, and consequently the system becomes, in principle, predictable. Prediction of scale invariant avalanches in both experiments and simulations are presented. Other sources of confusion as the use of logarithmic scales, and the avalanche dynamics in well established critical systems, are also revised; as well as the influence of dissipation and disorder in the "self-organization" of scale invariant dynamics.

The inland survey is for the purpose of studying continental ice, crustal structure, and geomagnetism following the geomagnetic meridian. During the period of February 11, 1968 to February 20, 1969 Syowa was manned by the 9 th wintering party. The party consisted of the writer, who succeeded Dr. T.

We are limited in the scale of the station facility because of the transport capacity of the relief ship FUJI, but we were able to commence the study of cloud physics and medical science.

KD 60, specially constructed snowmobile, was made available for the Pole trip Its special features include ability to withstand temperatures as low as minus 60 degrees Centigrade in the traverse over the ice plateau of the altitude of higher than 4, 000 meters for a distance of 6, 000 kilometers. The vehicle is equipped with a seismograph, an ice radar, a natural radio waves receiver, a gyrosyncompass for navigation, and radio transmitters and the like. It contains four berths plus kitchen and is capable of continuous operation fora five-month period. During the traverse the party conducted scientific observations and measurements of the following subjects : location, altitude, weather, topography, geology, ice thickness, geomagnetism, natural radio waves (VLF emission) and medical science.

We proceeded southward along 43 degrees East Longitude. Forty days later we passed 76 degrees South Latitude. There-after we were plagued with softer-than-expected snow and an uneven snow cover caused by strong winds One of the KD 602 ̆ 7 s had a trouble in the turbo-charger and we were forced to proceed onward without it. The equipments and stores of the abandoned vehicle were transferred onto the other vehicles and sleighs On the 46 th day our train arrived at the U. S.

Luminosity analysis of this image also reveals the presence of numerous dark melt layers as well as a systematic decrease in background luminosity, interpreted in terms of a progressive increase in light transmission during firnification. We identify four material facies within the rift: <b>snow,</b> <b>granular</b> ice, marine ice and unconsolidated platelets. We interpret the granular ice facies as snow that has been saturated by percolating sea water, and the underlying marine ice as compacted buoyant platelets that have adhered to the rift base.

The snow samples were analyzed for a homologous series of low molecular weight normal (C 1 -C 10) and branched (iC 4 -iC 6) monocarboxylic acids as well as aromatic (benzoic) and hydroxy (glycolic and lactic) acids, together with major inorganic ions and dissolved organic carbon (DOC). The molecular distributions of organic acids were characterized by a predominance of acetic (range 7. 8 - 76. 4 ng/g-snow, av. 34. 8 ng/g) or formic acid (2. 6 - 48. 1 ng/g, 27. 7 ng/g), followed by propionic acid (0. 6 - 5. 2 ng/g, 2. 8 ng/g). Concentrations of normal organic acids generally decreased {{with an increase in}} carbon chain length, although nonanoic acid (C 9) showed a maximum in the range of C 5 -C 10. Higher concentrations were found in the snowpack samples containing dust layer. Benzoic acid (0. 18 - 4. 1 ng/g, 1. 4 ng/g) showed positive correlation with nitrate (r = 0. 70), sulfate (0. 67), Na+ (0. 78), Ca 2 + (0. 86) and Mg+ (0. 75), suggesting that this aromatic acid is involved with anthropogenic sources and Asian dusts. Higher concentrations of Ca 2 + and SO 4 ^[2 -] were found in the dusty snow samples. We found a weak positive correlation (r = 0. 43) between formic acid and Ca 2 +, suggesting that gaseous formic acid may react with Asian dusts in the atmosphere during long-range transport. However, acetic acid did not show any positive correlations with major inorganic ions. Hydroxyacids (0. 03 - 5. 7 ng/g, 1. 5 ng/g) were more abundant in the <b>granular</b> and dusty <b>snow.</b> Total monocarboxylic acids (16 - 130 ng/g, 74 ng/g) were found to account for 1 - 6 % of DOC (270 - 1500 ng/g, 630 ng/g) in the snow samples...|$|R
