5|$|Cockatoos are {{versatile}} feeders {{and consume}} {{a range of}} mainly vegetable food items. Seeds form {{a large part of}} the diet of all species; these are opened with their large and powerful bills. The galahs, corellas and some of the black cockatoos feed primarily on the ground; others feed mostly in trees. The ground-feeding species tend to forage in flocks, which form tight, squabbling groups where seeds are concentrated and dispersed lines where food is more sparsely distributed; they also prefer open areas where visibility is good. The western and long-billed corellas have elongated bills to excavate tubers and roots and the Major Mitchell's cockatoo walks <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>circle</b> <b>around</b> the doublegree (Emex australis) to twist out and remove the underground parts.|$|E
25|$|Drumless Eisa: {{typical of}} the Motobu Peninsula (Nago, Motobu and Nakijin) in {{northern}} Okinawa. Men and women line up <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>circle</b> <b>around</b> a wooden scaffold where sanshin is played. Dancers use no drum. A dozen to twenty songs are performed in a fast tempo.|$|E
25|$|Theoretically, a girl {{received}} suitors at a faikava, or kava-drinking gathering. She {{presided over}} the bowl, made the kava, and handed out the cups. The suitors sat <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>circle</b> <b>around</b> the bowl, chatting, bragging, arguing, and showing off for the demure young lady. All was done under {{the eye of the}} elders, thus protecting the maiden from any unseemly advances.|$|E

5000|$|The video {{features}} an exclusive strings-only {{mix of the}} song. Björk explained, [...] "I had recorded the strings with a clip-on mike on each instrument. We have made a different mix where we have fanned this <b>in</b> <b>an</b> intimate <b>circle</b> <b>around</b> the listener. So as you watch the virtual reality headset it will be {{as if you are}} on that beach and with the 30 players sitting <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>circle</b> tightly <b>around</b> you."

25|$|Members of {{the church}} also mounted anti-gay protests at the trials of McKinney and Henderson. In response, Romaine Patterson, a friend of Shepard's, {{organized}} a group which assembled <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>circle</b> <b>around</b> the Westboro Baptist Church protesters, wearing white robes and gigantic wings (resembling angels) that blocked the protesters, despite Shepard's parents being able to hear the protesters shouting anti-gay remarks and comments at them. Police had to create a human barrier between the two groups. Angel Action was founded by Patterson in April 1999.|$|E
25|$|Within various Native American communities, gender {{plays an}} {{important}} role in music. Men and women play sex-specific roles in many musical activities. Instruments, songs and dances are often peculiar to one or the other sex, and many musical settings are strictly controlled by sex. In modern powwows, women play a vital role as backup singers and dancers. The Cherokee people, for example, hold dances before stickball games. At these pre-game events, men and women perform separate dances and follow separate regulations. Men will dance <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>circle</b> <b>around</b> a fire, while women dance in place. Men sing their own songs, while women have their songs sung for them by an elder. Whereas the men's songs invoke power, the women's songs draw power away from the opposing stickball team. In some societies, there are customs where certain ceremonial drums are to be played by men only. For the Southern Plains Indians, it is believed that the first drum was given to a woman by the Great Spirit, who instructed her to share it with all women of native nations. However, there also exist prohibitions against women sitting at the Beg Drum.|$|E
25|$|The remake {{version of}} the video is about a person who loses touch with himself. Originally full of life, the protagonist becomes a robot working a {{monotonous}} office job. One morning, he wakes up from a dream of a beautiful girl dressed in white on the beach. He leaves for work, and his buried alter egos, dressed in white shirts, black slacks, assorted ties and each holding either red or white roses, emerge mysteriously. At work, his boss gives him a stack of paperwork, which he does mechanically. Meanwhile, at home, the alter egos are <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>circle</b> <b>around</b> his coffee table, throw the roses in the center, and leave. Back at work, he prepares to go home, but is then given another stack of documents. His frustrations boil over, and he throws his tie at his boss. He runs home not knowing what he is running for, {{and at the moment}} that he walks in the door, the last of the alter egos exits. He finds a white box that replaced his coffee table and is intrigued. He unwraps the red and white ribbons and opens the box to find himself on the beach with the same girl in his dream and the roses on the water.|$|E

25|$|The Round Table first {{appears in}} Wace's Roman de Brut, a Norman {{language}} adaptation of Geoffrey of Monmouth's Historia Regum Britanniae finished in 1155. Wace says Arthur created the Round Table to prevent quarrels among his barons, {{none of whom}} would accept a lower place than the others. Layamon added to the story when he adapted Wace's work into the Middle English Brut in the early 13th century, saying that the quarrel between Arthur's vassals led to violence at a Yuletide feast. In response a Cornish carpenter built an enormous but easily transportable Round Table to prevent further dispute. Wace claims {{he was not the}} source of the Round Table; both he and Layamon credited it instead to the Bretons. Some scholars have doubted this claim, while others believe it may be true. There is some similarity between the chroniclers' description of the Round Table and a custom recorded in Celtic stories, in which warriors sit <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>circle</b> <b>around</b> the king or lead warrior, in some cases feuding over the order of precedence as in Layamon. There is a possibility that Wace, contrary to his own claims, derived Arthur's round table not from any Breton source, but rather from medieval biographies of Charlemagne—notably Einhard's Vita Caroli and Notker the Stammerer's De Carolo Magno—in which the king is said to have possessed a round table decorated with a map of Rome.|$|E
500|$|It {{is unknown}} what the {{earliest}} {{version of the}} rhyme was or when it began.

500|$|In the Sticky & Sweet Tour, [...] "Miles Away" [...] was {{performed}} during the gypsy {{segment of the}} show. Madonna wore a gypsy inspired Givenchy long cape, over a black dress, with pink colored ribbons around her neck. She also wore black stockings on her leg. Before starting the song she said, [...] "This is for all who know the struggle of long-distance relationships. I know you're out there." [...] While dancers gathered and sat down <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>circle</b> <b>around</b> her, Madonna went up on a platform, started playing the acoustic guitar and encouraged the crowd to clap and sing along. The screens give another message to the song, showing a stream of world maps and passport stamps and the history as well as journey of gypsies travelling around the world, adding to the atmosphere of that particular section of the show.|$|E

Scully stated that the scene was included because it [...] "was {{a chance to get}} the world's smartest man and the world's stupidest man in the same place". In the scene, Hawking tells Homer [...] "Your theory of a donut-shaped universe is intriguing... I may have to steal it." [...] In his book What's science ever done for us?: what The Simpsons can teach us about physics, robots, life and the universe, Paul Halpern wrote that in mathematics, a [...] "donut-shape", the three-dimensional generalization of a ring, is referred to as a torus.

He believed that H3 was a stable molecule and wrote and lectured about it. He stated that the easiest way to make it was to target potassium hydroxide with cathode rays. In 1913 Johannes Stark proposed that three hydrogen nuclei and electrons could form a stable ring shape. In 1919 Niels Bohr proposed a structure with three nuclei in a straight line, with three electrons orbiting <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>circle</b> <b>around</b> the central nucleus.
