25|$|Another {{common use}} of a ballast {{resistor}} in the automotive industry is adjusting the ventilation <b>fan</b> <b>speed.</b> The ballast is a fixed resistor with usually two center taps, and the <b>fan</b> <b>speed</b> selector switch is used to bypass portions of the ballast: all of them for full speed, and none for the low speed setting. A very common failure occurs when the fan is being constantly run at the next-to-full speed setting (usually 3 out of 4). This will cause a very short piece of resistor coil to be operated with a relatively high current (up to 10A), eventually burning it out. This will render the fan unable to run at the reduced speed settings.|$|E

40|$|Fan {{noise is}} one of the {{principal}} noise sources generated by a turbofan aero-engine. At supersonic <b>fan</b> <b>speeds,</b> <b>fan</b> tones are generated by the “rotor-alone” pressure field. In general, these tones can be well absorbed by an inlet duct acoustic liner, apart from at high supersonic <b>fan</b> <b>speeds.</b> However, in practice inlet duct liners contain acoustically hard longitudinal splices which cause scattering. This leads to acoustic energy being scattered into a range of different azimuthal mode orders, similar to the modal content resulting from rotor–stator interactions. The effectiveness of an inlet duct lining is reduced because acoustic energy is scattered into modes that are poorly absorbed by the liner. In this article, the effect of this acoustic scattering is examined by three-dimensional finite-element simulations of sound transmission in a turbofan inlet duct. Results include predictions of the sound power transmission loss with different splice widths, and at different supersonic <b>fan</b> <b>speeds.</b> These results demonstrate how acoustic scattering by liner splices can adversely affect fan tone noise levels at low supersonic <b>fan</b> <b>speeds,</b> but have little adverse affect on noise levels at high supersonic <b>fan</b> <b>speeds.</b> The potential noise benefit that could be achieved by manufacturing thinner splices is also examined...|$|R

25|$|Cubic {{feet per}} minute (CFM) is an often {{confusing}} term {{because it has}} no single definition that applies to all instances. Gases are compressible, which means that a figure in cubic feet per minute cannot necessarily be compared with another figure when it comes {{the mass of the}} gas. To further confuse the issue, a centrifugal fan is a constant CFM device or a constant volume device. This means that, provided the <b>fan</b> <b>speed</b> remains constant, a centrifugal fan will pump a constant volume of air. This {{is not the same as}} pumping a constant mass of air. Again, the fan will pump the same volume, though not mass, at any other air density. This means that the air velocity in a system is the same even though mass flow rate through the fan is not.|$|E
2500|$|Early {{television}} {{remote controls}} (1956-1977) used ultrasonic tones. [...] Present-day remote controls are commonly consumer infrared devices which send digitally-coded pulses of infrared radiation to control {{functions such as}} power, volume, channels, playback, track change, heat, <b>fan</b> <b>speed,</b> or other features varying from device to device. [...] Remote controls for these devices are usually small wireless handheld objects {{with an array of}} buttons for adjusting various settings such as television channel, track number, and volume. For many devices, the remote control contains all the function controls while the controlled device itself has only a handful of essential primary controls. The remote control code, and thus the required remote control device, is usually specific to a product line, but there are universal remotes, which emulate the remote control made for most major brand devices.|$|E

The primary improvement in the Macintosh II was Color QuickDraw in ROM, a color version of the graphics language which was the heart of the machine. Among the many innovations in Color QuickDraw were the ability to handle any display size, any color depth, and multiple monitors. The Macintosh II marked {{the start of a new}} direction for the Macintosh, as now for the first time it had an open architecture with several NuBus expansion slots, support for color graphics and external monitors, and a modular design similar to that of the IBM PC. It had an internal hard drive and a power supply with a fan, which was initially fairly loud. One third-party developer sold a device to regulate <b>fan</b> <b>speed</b> based on a heat sensor, but it voided the warranty. Later Macintosh computers had quieter power supplies and hard drives.|$|E
40|$|Fan {{noise is}} one of the {{principal}} noise sources in turbofan aero-engines. At supersonic <b>fan</b> <b>speeds,</b> <b>fan</b> tones are generated by the “rotor-alone” pressure field. In general, these tones can be well absorbed by an inlet duct acoustic liner, except at high supersonic <b>fan</b> <b>speeds</b> when the rotor-alone pressure field is well cut-on. In this article an axially segmented liner is proposed, which is predicted to improve the attenuation of tones at high supersonic <b>fan</b> <b>speeds.</b> The analysis is based on locally reacting cavity liners. The axially segmented liner is axisymmetric and consists of two circular sections of different linings joined together. The optimum design consists of two linings with the same face-sheet resistance, but with different cavity depths. The depth of the liner adjacent to the fan is very thin. This means that where the two liners are joined there is a wall impedance discontinuity that can cause acoustic scattering. Fan tones can be modelled in terms of spinning modes in a uniform circular-section duct. The liner is axisymmetric, so modal scattering will be only between different radial modes. The optimum design minimizes the acoustic energy scattered into the first radial mode. This improves the attenuation of fan tones at high supersonic <b>fan</b> <b>speeds,</b> because acoustic energy is scattered into high radial mode orders, which are better absorbed by the lining...|$|R

2500|$|The XJ12 {{version was}} {{announced}} in July 1972, featuring simplified grille treatment, and powered by a 5.3L V12 engine (coupled to a Borg Warner Model 12). The car as presented {{at that time was}} the world's only mass-produced 12-cylinder four-door car, and, with a top speed [...] "around 140 mph" [...] (225km/h) as the [...] "fastest full four-seater available in the world today". Although it had been the manufacturer's intention from launch that the XJ would take the twelve-cylinder engine, its installation was nonetheless a tight fit, and providing adequate cooling had evidently been a challenge for the engineers designing the installation. [...] Bonnet/hood louvres such as those fitted on the recently introduced twelve-cylinder E Type were rejected, but the XJ12 featured a complex [...] "cross-flow" [...] radiator divided into two separated horizontal sections and supported with coolant feeder tanks at each end: [...] the engine fan was geared to rotate at 1¼ times the speed of the engine rpm, subject to a limiter which cut in at a (<b>fan)</b> <b>speed</b> of 1,700rpm. [...] The fuel system incorporated a relief valve that returned fuel to the tank when pressure in the leads to the carburetters exceeded 1.5 psi {{to reduce the risk of}} vapour locks occurring at the engine's high operating temperature, while the car's battery, unusually, benefited from its own thermostatically controlled cooling fan.|$|E

50|$|The Opti-Fan system {{compensates}} automatically {{for continuous}} uphill or downhill gradients in combines. When driving downhill, material moves against gravity {{and therefore more}} slowly over the grainpan and top sieve, causing it to remain longer in the cleaning shoe and the layer thickness to increase. More ‘material other than grain' (MOG) remains in the cleaning shoe as the set cleaning <b>fan</b> <b>speed</b> is insufficient to clear the crop. Driving uphill causes the material layer to decrease as it moves more quickly out of the shoe under gravity. The air flow from the fan is too high for the thin layer of material which results in the material travelling too quickly over the top causing increased grain losses. The <b>fan</b> <b>speed</b> control system senses the combine’s angle of ascent or descent and automatically adjusts the cleaning <b>fan</b> <b>speed</b> to compensate. The operator sets the level-field <b>fan</b> <b>speed</b> and the system reduces the speed when travelling uphill and increases it downhill to optimise the material layer thickness on the cleaning shoe.Opti-fan system was awarded with a Silver Medal at Agritechnica in 2009.|$|E
