25|$|Curtiss quickly {{recognized}} Genie's nonverbal communication abilities, recalling several nonverbal interactions Genie {{had with}} strangers during that time. By this time Genie could name {{most of the}} things around her and had an estimated vocabulary of at least a few hundred words, consisting of a few verbs and adjectives and a large number of nouns. She was also extremely eager to expand her vocabulary, frequently grabbing Curtiss' hand and pointing it towards objects for which she wanted to know the word, and if Curtiss could not <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>exactly</b> what Genie was looking for Genie refused to let go until she learned at least one new word. Curtiss noted Genie's focus on objective properties, and especially her knowledge of color words, was very unusual because these require a level of cognitive sophistication not present in young children, suggesting she developed mental mechanisms for categorization during childhood. She had also clearly learned some basic principles of grammar, and understood more than she was producing.|$|E

2500|$|In 2007, {{members of}} the Annapolis Group {{discussed}} a letter to college presidents asking them {{not to participate in}} the US News [...] "reputation survey". A majority of the approximately 80 presidents at the meeting agreed not to participate, although the statements were not binding. Members pledged to develop alternative web-based information formats in conjunction with several collegiate associations. US News responded that their peer assessment survey helps them measure a college's [...] "intangibles" [...] such as the ability of a college's reputation to help a graduate win a first job or entrance into graduate school. An article by Nicholas Thompson in Washington Monthly criticized the U.S. News rankings as [...] "confirming the prejudices of the meritocracy" [...] by tuning their statistical algorithms to entrench the reputations of a handful of schools, while failing to measure how much students learn.

50|$|Throughout the 1940s {{scientists}} {{had been trying}} to come up with ways to validate experiments prior to publishing them. The result of this was a myriad of different validities (intrinsic validity, face validity, logical validity, empirical validity, etc.). This made it difficult to tell which ones were actually the same and which ones were not useful at all. Until the middle of the 1950s there were very few universally accepted methods to validate psychological experiments. The main reason for this was because no one had <b>figured</b> <b>out</b> <b>exactly</b> which qualities of the experiments should be looked at before publishing. Between 1950 and 1954 the APA Committee on Psychological Tests met and discussed the issues surrounding the validation of psychological experiments.|$|R
50|$|Much {{research}} on Sociotropy focuses on links between personality {{and the risk}} for depression. People who are very dependent are classified as sociotropic individuals, and {{are more prone to}} depression as they seek to sustain their low self-esteem by establishing secure interpersonal relationships. Sociotropic individuals are heavily invested into their relationships with other people and have higher desires for acceptance, support, understanding, and guidance—which is problematic when relationships fail. People who are sociotropic and going through failed relationships are likely to become depressed due to intensified feelings of abandonment and loss. Researchers have a hard time <b>figuring</b> <b>out</b> <b>exactly</b> how much personality affects risk for depression, as it is hard to isolate traits for research, though they conclude that a person can either be sociotropic or independent, but not both.|$|R

[...] Scott Kerr of AllMusic praised the record's sound quality: [...] "The striking production -- namely the driving bass and tight drum sound -- that Arcade Fire mixer Craig Silvey has conjured up here has created a spacious sounding record that is packed with strings and synths and is {{for the most part}} -- rather impressively -- recorded live." ...|$|R

30|$|At first, no {{significant}} difference between respective AFM images of the freshly casted film (top) and the rinsed film (bottom), after drying respectively, could be observed. This finding supports the stability of ZOL/PEC films after contact to the release medium. Secondly, small PEC particles, whose diameters were sizing around 100  nm could be found. This value can not be directly compared to diameters found by DLS measurements (Table  1), since on the one side casted PEC particles are flattened and are assumed to have a hemispheric profile [26] leading to larger values. On the other side, dried casted PEC particles lost water to a considerable amount leading to smaller values compared to diameters obtained from DLS. Which effect, flattening or shrinking, is dominating or whether both approximately compensate, cannot be <b>figured</b> <b>out</b> <b>exactly.</b> Nevertheless we speculate that drying of casted PEC films is associated with a process of shrinking, flattening and partly merging of individual PEC particles. This results in the remarkable stability of PEC particle films against detachment (see above).|$|R
