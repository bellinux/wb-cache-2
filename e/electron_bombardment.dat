5|$|Certain diamond {{enhancement}} {{techniques are}} commonly used to artificially produce an array of colors, including blue, green, yellow, red, and black. Color enhancement techniques usually involve irradiation, including proton bombardment via cyclotrons; neutron bombardment in the piles of nuclear reactors; and <b>electron</b> <b>bombardment</b> by Van de Graaff generators. These high-energy particles physically alter the diamond's crystal lattice, knocking carbon atoms out of place and producing color centers. The depth of color penetration depends on the technique and its duration, {{and in some cases}} the diamond may be left radioactive to some degree.|$|E
5|$|The {{photostability}} of pigments can {{be enhanced}} {{by the addition of}} cerium. It provides pigments with light fastness and prevents clear polymers from darkening in sunlight. Television glass plates are subject to <b>electron</b> <b>bombardment,</b> which tends to darken them by creation of F-center color centers. This effect is suppressed by addition of cerium oxide. Cerium is also an essential component of phosphors used in TV screens and fluorescent lamps. Cerium sulfide forms a red pigment that stays stable up to 350°C. The pigment is a nontoxic alternative to cadmium sulfide pigments.|$|E

25|$|The {{two most}} common {{irradiation}} methods are neutron and <b>electron</b> <b>bombardment.</b> The former treatment produces a green to black color that penetrates the whole stone, {{while the latter}} treatment produces a blue, blue-green, or green color that only penetrates about 1 millimeter deep. Annealing of these stones (from 500–900°C for neutron-bombarded stones and from 500–1200°C for electron-bombarded stones) produces orange, yellow, brown, or pink. Blue to blue-green stones that are not annealed are separated from natural stones {{in the same manner}} as gamma ray-treated stones.|$|E
25|$|Presently {{diamonds}} are safely irradiated in four ways: proton and deuteron bombardment via cyclotrons; {{gamma ray}} bombardment via exposure to cobalt-60; neutron bombardment via {{the piles of}} nuclear reactors; and <b>electron</b> <b>bombardment</b> via Van de Graaff generators. These high-energy particles physically alter the diamond's crystal lattice, knocking carbon atoms out of place and producing color centers. Irradiated diamonds are all some shade of green, black, or blue after treatment, but most are annealed to further modify their color into bright shades of yellow, orange, brown, or pink. The annealing process increases the mobility of individual carbon atoms, allowing some of the lattice defects created during irradiation to be corrected. The final color {{is dependent on the}} diamond's composition and the temperature and length of annealing.|$|E
500|$|Helium has a valence of {{zero and}} is {{chemically}} unreactive under all normal conditions. It is an electrical insulator unless ionized. As {{with the other}} noble gases, helium has metastable energy levels that allow it to remain ionized in an electrical discharge with a voltage below its ionization potential. Helium can form unstable compounds, known as excimers, with tungsten, iodine, fluorine, sulfur, and phosphorus when it is subjected to a glow discharge, to <b>electron</b> <b>bombardment,</b> or reduced to plasma by other means. The molecular compounds HeNe, HgHe10, and WHe2, and the molecular ions , , , and [...] have been created this way. HeH+ is also stable in its ground state, but is extremely reactive—it is the strongest Brønsted acid known, and therefore can exist only in isolation, as it will protonate any molecule or counteranion it contacts.

40|$|We have {{examined}} the effects of 20 keV electron irradiation on [-Cu(1) -O(1) -]n chain oxygen arrangements in oxygen deficient but otherwise twin-free YBa 2 Cu 3 O 6 +x single crystals. Comparison of polarized Raman spectra of non-irradiated and irradiated areas provides evidence that <b>electron</b> <b>bombardments</b> instigate the collective hopping of oxygen atoms either from an interstitial at O(5) site to a vacant O(1) chain site or by reshuffling the chain segments to extend the average length of chains without changing the overall oxygen content. This oxygen ordering effect, while counter-intuitive, is analogous to that found in the photoexcitation induced ordering in which temporal charge imbalance from electron-hole pair creation by inelastic scattering of incident electrons causes a local lattice distortion which brings on the atomic rearrangements...|$|R
40|$|XPS {{analysis}} {{has been used}} for characterizing the effects of Ar ion and <b>electron</b> beam <b>bombardment</b> on the surface properties of superionic conducting glass of (AgI) (0. 4) (Ag 2 O) (0. 3) (MoO 3) (0. 3). Cations in this particular glass were significantly reduced by Ar ion bombardment. This is attributed to the imbalance between cations and anions induced by preferential sputtering of anions. The O Is peak is shifted to higher binding energy by Ar ion bombardment. This is mainly attributed to the sputtering of silver in preference to molybdenum. The <b>electron</b> beam <b>bombardment</b> increases the surface concentration of silver and induces a change in the chemical state of silver from Ag+ to Ag- 0.

[...] The molecules enter into the MS (the source is a quadrupole or the ion trap itself in an ion trap MS) where they are bombarded with free electrons emitted from a filament, not unlike the filament one would find in a standard light bulb. [...] The electrons bombard the molecules, causing the molecule to fragment in a characteristic and reproducible way.

[...] The molecular fragmentation pattern is dependent upon the electron energy applied to the system, typically 70 eV (electron Volts). [...] The use of 70 eV facilitates comparison of generated spectra with library spectra using manufacturer-supplied software or software developed by the National Institute of Standards (NIST-USA).

40|$|Title: Sputtering of dust {{grains and}} its {{consequences}} for space processes Author: Marek Vyšinka Department: Department of Surface and Plasma Science Supervisor: prof. RNDr. Jana Šafránková, DrSc., Department of Surface and Plasma Science Abstract: A great part of matter in a space has a form of dust grains, tiny pieces of rocks with the dimensions of hundreds nanometers to hundreds micrometers. In this environment dust grains undergo collisions with energetic particles (electron, ions, UV photons) that leads to their charging and modification. The presented thesis studies ion-dust interactions and is focussed on dust grain modification through ion implantation and its destruction via sputtering process. Two compu- ter models are presented - first for computing the ion implantation profile in the grain and second, for {{the shape of the}} sputtered grain lying on the surface of a bigger object. The resulting shape of the grain is compared with that obtained experimentally. Important results of the thesis are measured sputtering yields for spherical SiO 2 grains at several surface potentials obtained by simultaneous ion and <b>electron</b> <b>bombardments.</b> Keywords: ions, dust grains, sputtering, sputtering yield, implantation profile...|$|R
