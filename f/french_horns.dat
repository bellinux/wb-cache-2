5|$|Moman {{moved away}} from the usual Presley pop {{recordings}} aimed at an established audience. A developer of the Stax Records sound, he incorporated a Memphis sound integrating soul, country, gospel and rural and electric blues. Many arrangements lean heavily on the rhythm section, with lesser contributions from strings, brass and woodwinds. Arrangers Green Spreen and Mike Leech changed Presley's image on the tracks with the addition of violas, cellos and <b>French</b> <b>horns.</b> The arrangers intended to blend the tracks for a distinctive sound; the strings are used in counterpoint, rising when the track fades and vice versa. The violas play the same lines as the <b>French</b> <b>horns,</b> with cello used for darker tones. Syncopation was incorporated by bowing.|$|E
5|$|Over 100 {{minutes of}} score {{are present in}} Speed2, more than Mancina wrote for Speed and Twister combined. After the score was written, he created a demo of the entire score on a {{synthesizer}} to play for De Bont. While the score for Speed only used strings, <b>French</b> <b>horns,</b> and percussion, Speed2 used {{a wider variety of}} instruments including trombones, large woodwinds, bass clarinets, and contrabassoons. The score was recorded by a 96-person orchestra, including Mancina, who performed on a classical guitar on several cues. The reggae music featured a band with steel drums, in addition to Cuban drums and Latin percussion. De Bont wanted 16 steel drum players, but {{due to a lack of}} available players, Mancina used eight drums which were double-tracked.|$|E

25|$|The modern symphony {{orchestra}} typically calls for two bassoons, {{often with a}} third playing the contrabassoon. Some works call for four or more players. The first player is frequently called upon to perform solo passages. The bassoon's distinctive tone suits it for both plaintive, lyrical solos such as Maurice Ravel's Boléro and more comical ones, such as the grandfather's theme in Peter and the Wolf. Its agility suits it for passages such as the famous running line (doubled in the violas and cellos) in the overture to The Marriage of Figaro. In addition to its solo role, the bassoon is an effective bass to a woodwind choir, a bass line along with the cellos and double basses, and harmonic support along with the <b>French</b> <b>horns.</b>|$|E

500|$|Czech {{musicology}} at {{the beginning}} of the 20th century was strongly influenced by Romanticism, in particular by the styles of Wagner and Smetana. Performance practises were conservative, and actively resistant to stylistic innovation. During his lifetime, Janáček reluctantly conceded to Karel Kovařovic's instrumental rearrangement of Jenůfa, most noticeably in the finale, in which Kovařovic added a more 'festive' sound of trumpets and <b>French</b> <b>horns,</b> and doubled some instruments to support Janáček's [...] "poor" [...] instrumentation. The score of Jenůfa was later restored by Charles Mackerras, and is now performed according to Janáček's original intentions.|$|E
500|$|Baroque pop (sometimes called baroque rock) is {{a fusion}} genre that {{combines}} rock music with particular elements of classical music. It {{emerged in the}} mid 1960s as artists pursued a majestic, orchestral sound and is identifiable for its appropriation of Baroque compositional styles (contrapuntal melodies and functional harmony patterns) and dramatic or melancholic gestures. Harpsichords figure prominently, while oboes, <b>French</b> <b>horns,</b> and string quartets are also common.)

500|$|Terence Blanchard {{composed}} the film score, marking his twelfth collaboration with Lee. For the score, {{he attempted to}} make a distinction between American and German soldiers. [...] "That was first done through the use of percussion, using a higher-pitched, tighter sound for Germans, and a fuller-field drum sound for Americans," [...] he explained. [...] "I also drew a distinction by using <b>French</b> <b>horns</b> for American forces, and a Wagner tuben for German forces." [...] Scoring the film required the use of a 90-piece orchestra, which was larger than in any of Lee's previous films. [...] Blanchard also relied on the use of instruments from the 1940s era, including a mandolin, accordion, slide guitar and rope drum.|$|E

500|$|Sandman's theme uses [...] "two {{contrabass}} saxophones, two contrabass clarinets, two contrabass bassoons {{and eight}} very low French horns" [...] to sound [...] "low, aggressive and heavy". Young described Venom's theme as [...] "Vicious, my instructions {{on that one}} were that he's the devil personified. His theme is much more demonic sounding." [...] Venom's theme uses eight <b>French</b> <b>horns.</b> Raimi approved the new themes during their first performance, but rejected the initial music {{to the birth of}} Sandman, finding it too monstrous and not tragic enough. Young had to recompose much of his score at a later stage, as the producers felt there were not enough themes from the previous films. Ultimately, new themes for the love story, Aunt May, and Mary Jane were dropped.|$|E

500|$|Poledouris said {{he started}} working on the score by {{developing}} the melodic linea pattern of musical ideas supported by rhythms. [...] The first draft was a poem sung to the strumming of a guitar, composed as if Poledouris was a bard for the barbarian. This draft became the [...] "Riddle of Steel", a composition played with [...] "massive brass, strings, and percussion", which also serves as Conan's personal theme. [...] The music is first played when Conan's father explains the riddle to him. Laurence E. MacDonald, Professor of Music at Mott Community College, said the theme stirs up the appropriate emotions when it is repeated during Conan's vow to avenge his parents. The film's main musical theme, the [...] "Anvil of Crom", which opens the film with [...] "the brassy sound of 24 <b>French</b> <b>horns</b> in a dramatic intonation of the melody, while pounding drums add an incessantly driven rhythmic propulsion" [...] is played again in several later scenes.|$|E

500|$|In Don Procopio, Bizet {{followed}} the stock devices of Italian opera as typified by Donizetti in Don Pasquale, a work which it closely resembles. However, the familiar idiom is interspersed with original touches in which Bizet's fingerprints emerge unmistakably. In his first significant opera, Les pêcheurs de perles, Bizet was hampered by a dull libretto and a laborious plot; nevertheless, {{the music in}} Dean's view rises at times [...] "far above the level of contemporary French opera". Its many original flourishes include {{the introduction to the}} cavatina Comme autrefois dans la nuit sombre played by two <b>French</b> <b>horns</b> over a cello background, an effect which in the words of analyst Hervé Lacombe, [...] "resonates in the memory like a fanfare lost in a distant forest". While the music of Les pêcheurs is atmospheric and deeply evocative of the opera's Eastern setting, in La jolie fille de Perth, Bizet made no attempt to introduce Scottish colour or mood, though the scoring includes highly imaginative touches such as a separate band of woodwind and strings during the opera's Act III seduction scene.|$|E
500|$|The opera is scored for an {{orchestra}} without bassoons, <b>French</b> <b>horns,</b> and tuba, but augmented by saxophones, pianos, and electronic synthesizer. The percussion section incorporates numerous special effects, including a wood block, sandpaper blocks, slapsticks and sleigh bells. The work opens with {{an orchestra}}l prelude of repetitive ascending phrases, after which {{a chorus of}} the Chinese military sings solemn couplets against a subdued instrumental background. This, writes Tommasini, creates [...] "a hypnotic, quietly intense backdrop, pierced by fractured, brassy chords like some cosmic chorale", in a manner reminiscent of Philip Glass. [...] Tommasini contrasts this {{with the arrival of}} Nixon and his entourage, when the orchestra erupts with [...] "big band bursts, rockish riffs and shards of fanfares: a heavy din of momentous pomp". [...] Gramophones critic compares the sharply written exchanges between Nixon, Mao and Chou En-lai with the seemingly aimless wandering of the melodic lines in the more reflective sections of the work, concluding that the music best serves the libretto in passages of rapid dialogue. Tommasini observes that Nixon's own vocal lines reflect the real-life president's personal awkwardness and social unease.|$|E

Its three movements represent Houston's development, from a rural economy to its role as a leader in space technology. Baroque in style, the album uses a mixture of <b>French</b> <b>horns,</b> trombones, and violins; and it features heavy use of the Elka Synthex, notably so on [...] "Third Rendez-Vous", a track Jarre often performs using a laser harp. Jarre worked with several Houston-based astronauts, including Bruce McCandless II and Ronald McNair, an accomplished musician who was to have played the saxophone on [...] "Rendez-Vous VI", recorded in the weightless environment of space. The live performance was curtailed by McNair's death in the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster on 28 January 1986. Consideration was given to the cancellation of the concert; but McCandless contacted Jarre and urged him to proceed, in memory of the shuttle's crew. McNair's saxophone piece was recorded by French saxophonist Pierre Gossez and retitled [...] "Ron's Piece". At Jarre's giant concerts in Houston and Lyon, the part was performed by McNair's friend, American saxophonist Kirk Whalum ...|$|E

500|$|Composer Bear McCreary {{called his}} {{expanded}} {{use of the}} orchestra in the episode [...] "the real star of this score", and noted that when executive producer and writer Jeffrey Bell heard {{an early version of}} it, he compared it to the work of Bernard Hermann. McCreary highlighted the opening and climactic action cues as striking the [...] "perfect" [...] balance between [...] "contemporary instrumentation and traditional scoring". The episode saw several variations of the series' main theme played, including triumphantly when [...] "Ward blasts {{his way out of the}} building", with trumpets and <b>French</b> <b>horns</b> offering [...] "soaring statements" [...] of it; and in a [...] "bouncy little statement", for which trumpet player Malcolm McNab used a broken harmon mute that [...] "rattles and buzzes like nothing I’ve ever heard". The Agents theme, first introduced in [...] "0-8-4", was also used [...] "at the end of the episode, [...] Coulson and Skye find a moment of [...] and unwind ... this theme always represents the emotional bond between our protagonists", and so was more appropriate for the scene than McCreary's themes for Coulson and Skye. McCreary [...] "stripped out all the guitars and percussion from the first version we heard and arranged it solely for con sord strings and a few woodwinds." ...|$|E
500|$|In act 2 a short orchestral {{introduction}} {{is followed}} by an off-stage chorus, notable for its sparse accompaniment—a tambourine and two piccolos. After Nourabad reminds Leila of her oath and leaves her alone she sings her cavatina [...] "". Two <b>French</b> <b>horns</b> introduce the theme, supported by the cellos. When her voice enters, says Lacombe, [...] "it replaces the first horn whose characteristic sound it seems to continue". Dean likens this song to Micaela's aria [...] "" [...] from Carmen. Nadir's [...] "De mon amie" [...] which follows the cavatina has, says Dean, [...] "a haunting beauty"; its introductory phrase recalls the oboe theme in Bizet's youthful Symphony in C. Dean cites the second act finale, with its repeated climaxes as the crowds demand the errant couple's deaths, {{as an example of}} Bizet's developing skills in writing theatrical music. The third act, divided into two brief scenes, begins with Zurga's entrance to quiet chromatic scales played over a tonic pedal, an effect that Bizet would later use in his incidental music to [...] The duet [...] "Je frémis", says Dean, has clear hints of Verdi's , and the fiery chorus [...] "Dès que le soleil" [...] is reminiscent of a Mendelssohn scherzo, but otherwise the final act's music is weak and lacking in dramatic force. In the closing scene, in which Zurga bids a last farewell to his dreams of love, the friendship theme from the act 1 duet sounds for the final time.|$|E
500|$|At the {{suggestion}} of manager Lenny Poncher and Hassinger, The Electric Prunes agreed to record a concept album that integrated Gregorian music into psychedelic pop, with the belief it would launch them into commercial success. Poncher recruited David Axelrod, a formally neo-classically trained musician, to compose all of the material for the project. The result, Mass in F Minor, was a complex arrangement of religious-based rock, which was sung entirely in Latin. Although the band did record the songs [...] "Kyrie Eleison", [...] "Gloria", and [...] "Credo", the intricate orchestration proved to be too difficult and time-consuming for the group. As a consequence, Hassinger enlisted the Canadian group, The Collectors, among other session musicians, in completing the album, although Lowe, Tulin, and Weakley did contribute to every track. Mass in F Minor was released in January 1968 and reached number 135 on the Billboard 200. An eerie version of the opening track, [...] "Kyrie Eleison", became somewhat of an underground favorite when it appeared in the soundtrack for the counterculture film, Easy Rider. The Electric Prunes performed with the new songs in concert just once, at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium, which Tulin described: [...] "From the outset the performance was a disaster. We missed the intro on the first song and it never got any better. Amp speakers blew, charts fell off music stands and everyone was, in general, in a complete state of confusion. Ended up each song turned into one long jam. I think we were, at times, {{all in the same}} key. I made my way over to the four celli and four <b>French</b> <b>horns</b> and told them to 'jam in E.' Somehow we would hit a break and James would manage a vocal". As a result of financial and musical issues, Weakley and Lowe left the group in early 1968. Tulin and Williams finished a tour with a line-up that also included Kenny Loggins and Jeremy Stuart, but by mid-1968 they too departed the group.|$|E
