25|$|Humans {{have always}} been tribal creatures. In ancient times, {{primitive}} man lived in a tribe that provided him with physical and nutritional security, {{and a sense of}} belonging. He could not have survived otherwise. Nowadays, the state provides all these things. It provides <b>external</b> <b>protection</b> by means of the military, and internal protection by means of the police. It also provides a security umbrella in terms of food and clothing and shelter in times of need. Most important, it satisfies that deep human need to belong to a group. The modern state has replaced the ancient tribe.|$|E

40|$|Will Kymlicka has {{attempted}} to harmonize the positions of liberals and communitarians with respect to minority rights. His distinction between group rights as <b>external</b> <b>protections</b> and internal restrictions sought to account for minority vindications without violating the liberal principle of autonomy. The objective {{of this article is}} twofold: first, to adopt a critical perspective by arguing that said distinction avoids the core of the discussion, that is, the issue of ownership of rights, and, second, to proposed a new classification of rights applicable to minorities that can {{serve as a model for}} future institutional designs...|$|R

In buildings of this type are practically excluded local place condensation on the inner surface of the outer enclosures.

50|$|A {{distinction}} that Dr. Kymlicka draws, which {{is crucial to}} his liberal defence of group-specific rights for minorities, is between <b>external</b> <b>protection</b> and internal restrictions. Kymlicka argues that external protections between groups may be justified {{in order to promote}} equality (but they must not allow for oppression or exploitation, as in apartheid in South Africa). Internal restrictions, however, cannot be justified from a liberal perspective, insofar as they restrict a person's autonomy, though they may be granted in certain cases to national minorities.|$|E
50|$|Douglas {{became a}} Labour Member of Parliament at the 1969 general election. He showed his {{interest}} in economic policy in his maiden speech, in which he argued against foreign investment in the domestic economy. His case for <b>external</b> <b>protection</b> of the domestic economy and government involvement in investment was characteristic of the Labour Party of the time. From 1972 to 1975, Douglas was a junior minister in the Third Labour Government, where he won a reputation for his capacity for innovation. This government followed a broadly Keynesian approach to economic management.|$|E

40|$|Federal {{policies}} on human research subjects have undergone a progressive transformation. In {{the early decades}} of the twentieth century, federal policies largely relied on the discretion of investigators to decide when and how to conduct research. This approach gradually gave way to policies that augmented investigator discretion with externally imposed protections. We may now be entering an era of even more stringent <b>external</b> <b>protections.</b> Whether the new policies effectively absolve investigators of personal responsibility for conducting ethical research, and whether it is wise to do so, remains to be seen...|$|R

40|$|The authors provide {{solutions}} to the relevant issue of development and construction of foundations resting on a sliding layer {{as a method of}} <b>external</b> seismic <b>protection</b> of buildings and structures. The authors have developed a system of automated operating control over the <b>external</b> seismic <b>protection</b> of buildings (structures) that represents an automatic switch of the emergencylevel seismic load. The authors have filed an application for the registration of their invention. The proposed solution has everything in place to be widely applied to improve the seismic protection of buildings and structures, especially those resting on problematic soils. The authors provide their description of a paradox of foundations: foundations are analyzed in terms of "upside-down" loads, whereas seismic loads have an opposite direction. The authors provide their {{solutions to}} this problem. The authors argue that methods of seismic protection incorporated into effective regulations are limited, and they do not constitute any <b>external</b> seismic <b>protection</b> methods, whereas the application of seismic isolation inside buildings is unreasonable, as it is limited by the requirement to install it "above the foundation". Presently, the above methods are being reworked into foundation platforms resting on a sliding layer. Their efficiency has been proven by a computerized model and a theoretical analysis. The authors also provide their argumentation in favour of the conclusion that relevant seismic protection development trends are to incorporate advanced structural solutions, including methods of <b>external</b> seismic <b>protection.</b> Впервые разработана и предложена система оперативного автоматического управления внешней сейсмозащитой здания (сооружения) в виде автоматического выключателя аварийного уровня сейсмического воздействия.

50|$|In the US, onshore and {{offshore}} pipelines used to transport {{oil and gas}} are regulated by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA). Certain offshore pipelines used to produce oil and gas are regulated by the Minerals Management Service (MMS). In Canada, pipelines are regulated by either the provincial regulators or, if they cross provincial boundaries or the Canada-US border, by the National Energy Board (NEB). Government regulations in Canada and the United States require that buried fuel pipelines must be protected from corrosion. Often, the most economical method of corrosion control is by use of pipeline coating in conjunction with cathodic protection and technology to monitor the pipeline. Above ground, cathodic protection is not an option. The coating is the only <b>external</b> <b>protection.</b>|$|E
