50|$|In 2010 debt {{mediation}} {{has become}} a primary way for small businesses to refinance in light of reduced lines of credit and direct borrowing. Debt mediation can be cost-effective for small businesses, help end or avoid litigation, and is preferable to filing for bankruptcy. While there are numerous companies providing restructuring for large corporations, there are few legitimate firms working for small businesses. Legitimate debt restructuring firms only work for the <b>debtor</b> <b>client</b> (not as a debt collection agency) and should charge fees based on success.|$|R
50|$|Re-hypothecation {{occurs when}} the {{creditor}} (a bank or broker-dealer) re-uses the collateral posted by the <b>debtor</b> (a <b>client</b> such as a hedge fund) to back the broker's own trades and borrowing. This mechanism also enables leverage in the securities market.|$|R
5000|$|A {{consumer}} makes {{monthly payments}} to the debt settlement company, or to the bank (or bank agent) who holds the [...] "trust" [...] account. A portion of each payment is taken as fees for the debt settlement company, {{and the rest is}} put into the trust account. The consumer is told not to pay anything to the creditors. The debt settlement company's fees are usually specified in the enrollment contract, and may range from 10% to 75% of the total amount of debt to be settled. [...] FTC regulations effective October 27, 2010 restrict debt settlement companies from collecting any fees from a <b>debtor</b> <b>client</b> for services until settlement with the creditor has been reached and at least one payment made.|$|R

50|$|Until about 1600 Hele {{had a high}} reputation, {{but then}} {{personal}} attacks on him started. Through his making of loans, and actions in recovering them, he exposed himself to attacks from the circle of Sir Thomas Egerton, one of his <b>debtors,</b> whose <b>clients</b> ran a successful personal vendetta against him. Hele had hoped to succeed Egerton as Master of the Rolls, but the outcome of his intrigues was quite different.|$|R
40|$|Bulow and Rogoff {{showed in}} 1988 that auction based {{purchases}} of debt {{could not be}} {{an effective way to}} capture the secondary market discount, since the purchase pushes up the secondary market afterward. The author of this report points out another problem with cash debt buy backs - one that arises because terms of trade contingent instruments do not exist in international capital markets, and because of the differences in risk aversion that one may plausibly assume to exist between commercial creditors and the developing countries that are their <b>debtor</b> <b>clients.</b> Under such circumstances, secondary market prices fail to reflect the insurance value reserves have to debtors but not to creditors - since, after all, the secondary market reflects mostly intrabank transactions. As a result, the country buying back debt with reserves clearly ends up worse off, even if it succeeds in capturing the full secondary market discount prevailing before the buyback - because the buyback reduces the insurance possibilities open to the country.

40|$|The {{stated purpose}} of the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 (2 ̆ 2 BAPCPA 2 ̆ 2) is to 2 ̆ 2 improve {{bankruptcy}} law and practice by restoring personal responsibility and integrity in the bankruptcy system and ensure {{that the system is}} fair for both debtors and creditors. 2 ̆ 2 Its legislative history stretches over almost a decade, but each iteration of it continued the same core features, the most predominant of which is a complex 2 ̆ 2 means test 2 ̆ 2 to determine whether a debtor may file a Chapter 7 case. This Article seeks to identify the constitutional issues most likely raised by BAPCPA. It cannot identify all that might possibly arise, as experience with the law will generate many questions that I cannot presently anticipate. Nor does it attempt to provide definitive answers to the constitutional questions it raises. Instead, the objective is to identify for judges and practitioners the constitutional questions they are likely to see, summarize the applicable constitutional law, and anticipate the arguments that will be made. Specifically, this Article focuses on the following constitutional questions that might arise under BAPCPA: Do BAPCPA 2 ̆ 7 s requirements for the ontent of attorney advertising violate the First Amendment? Does its regulation of the advice attorneys may give their <b>debtor</b> <b>clients</b> violate the First Amendment? Does its regulation of attorney conduct violate the Tenth Amendment or separation of powers? Would an involuntary Chapter 11 case that required payments over a five-year period constitute impermissible peonage? Does the means test violate the uniformity requirement or equal protection? Do the debtor disclosure requirements violate the right to privacy? Do the limits imposed on certain judicial actions violate separation of powers...|$|R
40|$|The {{financial}} audit has two components: the statutory audit (mandatory for certain companies) made by {{financial audit}}ors and the optional audit {{which can be}} done by other professionals (chartered accountants, evaluators, and tax matters members). The statutory audit represents the examination done by an authorized and independent professional of the financial statement of a company, in order to express a motivated opinion regarding the position, situation and financial performance. The statutory audit is established by law for those companies which have a significant public impact. The financial statement represents the management’s statement through which the firm communicates with the stakeholders: shareholders, creditors, investors, <b>clients,</b> <b>debtors,</b> contractors, employees, state institutions and thepopulation. The objective of the performance audit is the efficiency and effectiveness with which the audited company uses its resources in order to accomplish its responsibilities. The audit committees have a greater responsibility especially after the scandals in the US (Enron, WorldCom, Adelphia), through the Sarbanes-Oxley act from 2002. The audit committee has the following attributions: it monitors the financial reports made by the executive management, helps internal investigations, monitors and evaluates the activity of the internal audit department, gives recommendations to the administration council regarding the problems encountered when communicating with the shareholders, replacing or extending the mandate of the external auditor and authorizes the approval of this person’s fees...|$|R
40|$|International audienceNumerous {{organizations}} and companies rely upon business failure prediction {{to assess and}} {{minimize the risk of}} initiating business relationships with partners, <b>clients,</b> <b>debtors</b> or suppliers. Advances in research on business failure prediction have been largely dominated by algorithmic development and comparisons led by a focus on improvements in model accuracy. In this context, ensemble learning has recently emerged as a class of particularly well-performing methods, albeit often at the expense of increased model complexity. However, in practice, model choice is rarely based on predictive performance alone. Models should be comprehensible and justifiable to assess their compliance with common sense and business logic, and guarantee their acceptance throughout the organization. A promising ensemble classification algorithm that has been shown to reconcile performance and comprehensibility are rule ensembles. In this study, an extension entitled spline-rule ensembles is introduced and validated in the domain of business failure prediction. Spline-rule ensemble complement rules and linear terms found in conventional rule ensembles with smooth functions with the aim of better accommodating nonlinear simple effects of individual features on business failure. Experiments on a large selection of 21 datasets of European companies in various sectors and countries (i) demonstrate superior predictive performance of spline-rule ensembles over a set of well-established yet powerful benchmark methods, (ii) show the superiority of spline-rule ensembles over conventional rule ensembles and thus demonstrate the value of the incorporation of smoothing splines, (iii) investigate the impact of alternative term regularization procedures and (iv) illustrate the comprehensibility of the resulting models through a case study. In particular, the ability of the technique to reveal the extent {{and the way in which}} predictors impact business failure, and if and how variables interact, are exemplified...|$|R
40|$|MBA Thesis (WBS) There is {{currently}} no significant research that explores {{the influence that}} key risk indicators (KRIs) have on managers‟ goal setting behaviours in the financial industry in South Africa. A tremendous amount of {{research has been conducted}} on both KRIs as a formal operational risk monitoring tool and on managers‟ goal setting behaviours; however, there is limited literature that explores this relationship. As a result, senior management and Operational Risk Managers are unaware of the constructs that affect this dynamic which limits their ability to cultivate or maintain an acceptable risk profile, one which would propel an organisation forward in its pursuit to remain sustainable and profitable while also adhering to regulatory obligations. This research report aims to provide clarity to senior management and Operational Risk Managers on the influence that KRIs have on managers‟ goal setting behaviours. A manifest and content analysis was conducted on the responses obtained from an in-depth semi-structured interview process. It involved 15 respondents who were all managers responsible for the management of KRIs within their respective business units at Investec Bank Limited. The constructs identified during the literature review were explored to provide an understanding of their influence the KRIs and on managers‟ subsequent goal setting behaviours. The research findings indicated that some constructs considered had an influence on managers‟ KRI process and goal setting behaviours. All constructs are discussed in depth in Chapter four of this research report. The key message of this report is that financial institutions should continuously consider all the constructs that were investigated and align their internal KRI process. This is to ensure they reap the full benefits of the ORM process in their quest to manage their risk profiles more effectively. The findings of this research report will assist managers in leveraging their risk management tool to better manage organisational risk profiles. By realising the full benefits of a sophisticated risk management framework, all depositors, <b>debtors,</b> shareholders and <b>clients</b> are protected and the stability and effectiveness of the financial system considerably enhance...|$|R
