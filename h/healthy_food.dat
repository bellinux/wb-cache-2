A survey was administered to residents in the food desert areas. From this survey, data was collected pertaining to which factors most affected why these consumers do not buy <b>healthy</b> <b>foods.</b> The most noted factors were translated into different flyers that were later distributed in order to note which factor created the greatest sales response. Simultaneously, ethnography data was collected in order to grasp the effect of relationship marketing. The findings from this research revealed that the greatest factors affecting consumers’ decisions to buy <b>healthy</b> <b>foods</b> include price, lack of knowledge when buying and cooking <b>healthy</b> <b>foods</b> and buying indifference. Thus, the identical flyers distributed to different food desert areas differed in one variable each.

Also, the ethnography research illustrated that consumers respond positively to continued and reliable relationships. Based on the results from this research, more research should be conducted pertaining to the most effective ways to teach consumers how to affordably and easily cook <b>healthy</b> <b>foods.</b> Also, further research pertaining to the effect of relationship marketing and sales is necessary. ...|$|R

Experiments on rats suggest that P. mume extract administered during endurance exercise training may enhance the oxidative capacity of exercising skeletal muscle, and may induce the muscle to prefer fatty acids for its fuel use rather than amino acids or carbohydrates, thus assisting endurance.|$|E

For another use, the taro leaves and stems are used raw as an ingredient for pickles. Crushed leaves and stems are mixed with de-husked urad dal – black lentils and then dried as small balls called badi. The stems may also be sun-dried and stored for later use.

Today, a growing number of individuals and minority groups are embracing the Food Justice due to the perceived increase in hunger within nations such as the United States as well as the amplified effect of food insecurity on many minority communities, particularly the Black and Latino communities. A number of organizations have either championed the Food Justice Cause or greatly impacted the Food Justice space. An example of a prominent organization within the food justice movement has been the Coalition of Immokalee Workers, which is a worker-based human rights organization that has been recognized globally for its accomplishments in the areas of human trafficking, social responsibility and gender-based violence at work. The Coalition of Immoaklee Workers most prominent accomplishment related to the food justice space has been its part in implementing the Fair Food Program which increased the pay and bettered working conditions of farm workers in the tomato industry who had been exploited for generations. This accomplishment provided over 30,000 workers more income and the ability to access better and more healthy foods for themselves and their families. Another organization in the food justice space is the Fair Food Network, an organization that has embraced the mission of helping familIes who need <b>healthy</b> <b>food</b> to gain access to it while also increasing the livelihoold for farmers in America and growing local economies.
