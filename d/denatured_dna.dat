The antisera were assayed by complement fixation using <b>denatured</b> <b>DNA's</b> of various sources as antigens.

40|$|<b>Denatured</b> {{adenovirus}} <b>DNA</b> was {{retained by}} hydroxyapatite columns under conditions generally used for selective retention of double-stranded DNA, {{probably due to}} several partially complementary sequences within single-stranded DNA. It was found that addition of formamide reduced the fraction of sonically treated, <b>denatured</b> adenovirus <b>DNA</b> bound to hydroxyapatite from about 30 % to less than 1 %. This led to {{a study of the}} effect of formamide on the melting temperature (Tm) of double-stranded DNA in solution or bound to hydroxyapatite. The Tm of DNA decreases 0. 56 C/ 1 % formamide, a value determined in buffered solutions with purified formamide...|$|R
40|$|The {{quantity}} of penicillinase plasmid deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in various strains of Staphylococcus aureus {{has been determined}} by DNA-DNA reassociation kinetics. Specifically, 32 P- or 125 I-labeled denatured probes of purified plasmid DNA were reassociated {{in the presence of}} <b>denatured</b> <b>DNAs</b> isolated from the bacterial strains in question. The number of plasmid copies per cell was calculated from the effect of the latter nucleic acid samples on the reassociation rate of the radiolabeled probe. Among the S. aureus strains examined were monoplasmid, diplasmid and replication-defective representatives, and the effect of temperature on wild-type plasmid content was also investigated...|$|R
5000|$|Briefly, when sheared genomic DNA in {{solution}} is heated to near boiling temperature, the molecular forces holding complementary base pairs together are disrupted, {{and the two}} strands of each double-helix dissociate or ‘denature.’ If the <b>denatured</b> <b>DNA</b> is then slowly returned to a cooler temperature, sequences will begin to ‘reassociate’ (renature) with complementary strands.|$|E
50|$|To amplify DNA, it {{must first}} be {{denatured}} by exposing it to a 95 °C temperature for one minute, followed by thirty cycles of thirty-second 95 °C exposures. Then <b>denatured</b> <b>DNA</b> is mixed with a specific primer. A chromatograph is conducted on 2% agarose gel, stained, and viewed with UV fluorescence. The DNA is identified by looking for genome specific repetitive elements and by comparing it with known examples.|$|E
5000|$|Circular {{molecules}} of DNA, such as plasmids and typical mitochondrial genomes, consist of two strands of DNA called the heavy strand (or H-strand) {{and the light}} strand (or L-strand). The two strands have different masses due to different proportions of heavier nucleotides. While this difference is not known to have any functional significance, {{it can be used}} in the laboratory to segregate the strands of <b>denatured</b> <b>DNA,</b> and hence to analyze the strands separately.|$|E
40|$|Partial {{purification}} of DNA methylase from Novikoff rat hepatoma {{cells is}} described. Contamination with other proteins persists although the enzyme preparation {{has a high}} specific activity and is purified 980 -fold over homogenate activity. Evidence suggests, but does not prove, {{that there may be}} more than one species of DNA methylase in these cells. The enzyme has two broad pH optima at pH 7. 0 and 7. 5 and most readily methylates heterologous <b>denatured</b> <b>DNAs</b> although complex reaction kinetics indicate that native DNAs may eventually be methylated to an equal or greater level. The preparation of undermethylated DNA from Novikoff cells is also described. Undermethylated homologous DNA is an 85 -fold greater acceptor of methyl groups than fully methylated Novikoff cell DNA. In contrast to other DNA substrates, the enzyme preparation methylates native undermethylated homologous DNA at a 3. 5 -fold greater than <b>denatured</b> undermethylated homologous <b>DNA...</b>|$|R
40|$|Competent cell-deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) {{interactions}} were examined using tritium-labeled homologous or heterologous native or <b>denatured</b> <b>DNAs</b> and competent Streptococcus sanguis Wicky cells (strain WE 4). The DNAs used were extracted from WE 4 cells, Escherichia coli B cells, and E. coli bacteriophages T 2, T 4, T 6, and T 7. The reactions examined were: (i) total DNA binding, (ii) deoxyribonuclease-resistant DNA binding, and (iii) {{the production of}} acid-soluble products from the DNA. Optimal temperatures for the reactions were as follows: reaction (i), between 30 and 40 degrees C; reaction (ii), 30 degrees C; and reaction (iii), greater than 40 degrees C. The rates for the reactions (expressed as molecules of DNA that reacted per minute per colony-forming unit) did not vary greatly from one DNA source to another. With a constant competent cell concentration and differing DNA concentrations below a saturation level (from a given source), a different but constant fraction of the added DNA was cell bound, deoxyribonuclease resistant, and degraded to acid-soluble products. In experiments where the number of competent cells was varied and the DNA concentration was held constant, again essentially the same result was obtained. The extent of reactions (i), (ii), and (iii) depended upon the numbers {{as well as the}} source of DNA molecules applied to competent cells. Calcium ion essential for native DNA-cell reactions was also found essential for denatured DNA-cell reactions. Data obtained from competition experiments lead to the conclusion that competent WE 4 cells contain specific sites for native as well as <b>denatured</b> <b>DNAs...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{majority}} of donor deoxyribonucleate (DNA) at early stages after uptake {{was found in}} a complex with a cell component which changes its buoyant behavior on equilibrium density gradients. Analysis of the recipient cell lysates, after treatment to dissociate the complex, showed about two-thirds of the donor molecules in denatured form and the rest associated with recipient DNA. Incubation of cells after DNA uptake leads to the disappearance of <b>denatured</b> donor <b>DNA</b> and to the increase of donor label associated with recipient DNA. Some characteristics of a component from intact cells or spheroplasts with affinity for <b>denatured</b> Bacillus subtilis <b>DNA</b> are described...|$|R
50|$|The {{temperature}} gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE) or {{temperature gradient}} capillary electrophoresis (TGCE) method {{is based on}} the principle that partially <b>denatured</b> <b>DNA</b> is more restricted and travels slower in a porous material such as a gel. This property allows for the separation of DNA by melting temperature. To adapt these methods for SNP detection, two fragments are used; the target DNA which contain the SNP polymorphic site being interrogated and an allele-specific DNA sequence, referred to as the normal DNA fragment. The normal fragment is identical to the target DNA except potentially at the SNP polymorphic site, which is unknown in the target DNA. The fragments are denatured and then reannealed. If the target DNA has the same allele as the normal fragment, homoduplexes will form that will have the same melting temperature. When run on the gel with a temperature gradient, only one band will appear. If the target DNA has a distinct allele, four products will form following the reannealing step; homoduplexes consisting of target DNA, homoduplexes consisting of normal DNA and two heterduplexes of each strand of target DNA hybridized with the normal DNA strand. These four products will have distinct melting temperatures and will appear as four bands in the denaturing gel.|$|E
40|$|Anti-DNA {{antibodies}} in twenty-one systemic {{lupus erythematosus}} (SLE) sera were analysed by precipitation in gel, complement fixation, and the Farr globulin precipitation technique. Fifteen sera precipitated in agarose with both native and <b>denatured</b> <b>DNA</b> (Group 1) and six precipitated solely with <b>denatured</b> <b>DNA</b> (Group 2). Prior incubation of the sera with RNA or DNA digest abolished the precipitin reactions of all Group 2 sera, but had no appreciable effect on the precipitin patterns of the Group 1 sera. Molecular class of anti-DNA antibodies did not correlate with precipitation pattern. The ability of sucrose density gradient fractions of serum to fix complement with <b>denatured</b> <b>DNA</b> at 4 °C did not correspond {{with the presence of}} precipitating antibodies against <b>denatured</b> <b>DNA...</b>|$|E
40|$|Three {{methods of}} fractionating DNA are described, in which DNA {{fragments}} are separated {{on the basis}} (1) of their base composition, (2) of the ability of <b>denatured</b> <b>DNA</b> to renature after incubation, and (3) {{of the presence of}} intrastrand secondary structure in <b>denatured</b> <b>DNA.</b> The ability of some of these fractions to form specific duplexes with whole <b>denatured</b> <b>DNA</b> isolated from the same and from a different mammal has been investigated.

40|$|The {{molecular}} weight of native vaccinia deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is 1 to 1. 17 {{times that of}} native T 4 <b>DNA.</b> Sedimentation of <b>denatured</b> vaccinia <b>DNA</b> through alkaline sucrose gradients yields an apparent {{molecular weight}} greater than twice that of <b>denatured</b> T 4 <b>DNA,</b> implying that the complementary strands of vaccinia DNA do not separate upon denaturation. When alkali-denatured vaccinia DNA is neutralized, it has the physical chemical properties of native DNA when tested by sedimentation through neutral sucrose gradients, banding in CsCl, and by hydroxylapatite chromatography. We conclude that almost all mature vaccinia DNA molecules contain {{a small number of}} naturally occurring cross-links...|$|R
40|$|Double-stranded φX DNA which accumulates after {{infection}} with bacteriophage φX 174 {{in the presence}} of chloramphenicol consists mainly of twisted circular double-stranded DNA with no single-strand breaks (component I) and of circular double-stranded DNA, in which single-strand breaks are present (component II). Component II in m-NaCl is denatured with alkali within a sharp pH range, but component I is denatured over a wide pH range (pH 11. 2 to 12. 4). The midpoints of the transition in m-NaCl are pH 11. 3 and 11. 9, respectively. Component I in 0. 1 -phosphate is irreversibly denatured at pH 12. 7 to 12. 8 or higher, giving rise to a structure which sediments in neutral m-NaCl with an S 20,w = 40 s. The configuration of <b>denatured</b> double-stranded φX <b>DNA</b> has been studied by means of velocity sedimentation, isopycnic centrifugation in CsCl and spectrophotometry, and also the reactivity for formaldehyde has been determined. From the results it is concluded that <b>denatured</b> double-stranded φX <b>DNA</b> occurs as a highly twisted structure in which all or almost all hydrogen bonds have been disrupted. <b>Denatured</b> double-stranded φX <b>DNA</b> does not renature at high temperatures in low or high salt concentrations, but is converted spontaneously to native double-stranded DNA after introduction of a single-strand break by pancreatic DNase. The implications of these findings for the structure of <b>denatured</b> double-stranded <b>DNA</b> are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Blood samples {{containing}} {{antibodies to}} DNA {{were obtained from}} patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rabbits immunized with <b>denatured</b> <b>DNA</b> complexed to methylated bovine serum albumin. The immunoglobulin fractions from these sources did not decrease the over-all template activity of singlestranded DNA with DNA polymerase or DNA-dependent RNA polymerase. In competition studies, both DNA polymerase and DNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibited the binding of DNA antibodies to single-stranded DNA, as evidenced by inhibition of micro-complement fixation. These findings suggest that antibodies to DNA fail to decrease <b>denatured</b> <b>DNA</b> template activity because the enzymes which use a single-stranded DNA template can displace or block the antibodies from the <b>denatured</b> <b>DNA</b> {{as a result of}} greater binding affinity to the <b>denatured</b> <b>DNA.</b> The anti-DNA antibodies associated with SLE, therefore, may not be involved in the pathogenesis of the intracellular abnormalities associated with the disease...|$|E
40|$|Experiments were {{designed}} to determine {{the basis for the}} strong competitive reaction of <b>denatured</b> <b>DNA</b> with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) antinative DNA antibodies. Secondary structure in <b>denatured</b> <b>DNA</b> was reflected in hyperchromicity upon heating and in multiphase kinetics of its digestion by S 1 nuclease. Partial digestion by S 1 nuclease completely eliminated the ability of <b>denatured</b> <b>DNA</b> to react with antidenatured DNA antibodies, but not its ability to react with SLE sera. S 1 nuclease-resistant cores were isolated from extensively digested <b>denatured</b> <b>DNA.</b> These cores had secondary structure, including some stable fold-back helical regions. The cores, from 20 to several hundred base pairs in size, competed with native DNA for binding by SLE sera. Other experiments measured reactions of <b>denatured</b> <b>DNA</b> under conditions that affected its secondary structure content. Its competitive activity decreased as temperature was increased from 0 ° to 37 °C, whereas the activity of native DNA was not altered in this temperature range. With DNA pieces of 90 - 110 base pairs, native fragments were much more effective than the denatured fragments, in which stable helical structure is less likely to occur than in high molecular weight <b>denatured</b> <b>DNA.</b> Competitive assays with mononucleotides, oligonucleotides, homopolymers, and RNA-DNA hybrids also indicated that two strands of polydeoxyribonucleotide were required for optimal reactions with these SLE serum antibodies. The antibodies can measure stable helical regions in denatured DNA; they may also stabilize short helical regions that occur in an equilibrium of conformational forms...|$|E
40|$|Naturally {{occurring}} {{antibodies to}} left-handed Z-DNA {{have been shown}} to be present in the sera of human patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). These antibodies are of two types. One type reacts with both <b>denatured</b> <b>DNA</b> and Z-DNA. The other type is specific for Z-DNA and remained in the serum after removal of the cross-reactive antibody by extensive absorption on a <b>denatured</b> <b>DNA</b> affinity column. The antibodies appear to be specific for SLE and do not appear frequently in other rheumatic diseases. The presence of the antibody in SLE is correlated with the clinical manifestations of the disease, in parallel with antibodies to native and <b>denatured</b> <b>DNA...</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{simian virus}} 40 (SV 40) DNA {{segments}} {{present in a}} series of adenovirus-SV 40 hybrids have been mapped with respect to the sites of cleavage of SV 40 DNA by restriction endonucleases. Two approaches have been used. First, nucleic acid hybridizations were performed between equimolar quantities of the <b>denatured</b> <b>DNAs</b> of SV 40 and each hybrid virus and the radiolabeled transcripts of 11 DNA fragments obtained by cleavage of SV 40 DNA by restriction endonuclease from Hemophilus influenzae. Secondly, selected fragments of SV 40 DNA produced by the H. influenzae or H. parainfluenzae restriction endonucleases were used to form heteroduplex DNA molecules with adenovirus and adenovirus-SV 40 hybrid DNA, which were then analyzed by electron microscopy. The two sets of data were consistent and have permitted alignment of the map of the SV 40 segments of the hybrid viruses with the H. influenzae and H. parainfluenzae cleavage maps of SV 40. Since cells infected with some of the hybrid viruses contain one or more SV 40 -specific antigens, the genetic determinants of these antigens could be localized on the cleavage map...|$|R
40|$|A {{method of}} {{isolating}} circular plasmid DNA from cleared lysates of E. coli is described. Purification {{is achieved by}} virtue of the rapid re-annealing kinetics or supercoiled DNA. After a brief denaturation step, double stranded plasmid DNA is separated from <b>denatured</b> chromosomal <b>DNA</b> and RNA in a two-phase partition system using dextran and polyethylene glycol. The method is much more rapid than the conventional dye-centrifugation technique and plasmid DNA of comparable purity and yield is obtained...|$|R
40|$|Electrochemical {{oxidation}} of thermally <b>denatured</b> <b>DNA</b> at an electrochemically pretreated glassy {{carbon electrode}} was studied {{by means of}} adsorptive stripping voltammetry. The sensitivity for thermally <b>denatured</b> <b>DNA</b> detection at GCE was improved greatly by modifying the electrode with a simple and effective electrochemical oxidation at 1. 75 V (vs. SCE) for 300 s in pH 5. 0 phosphate buffer. Thermally <b>denatured</b> <b>DNA</b> was preconcentrated at pretreated GCE by its adsorption in open circuit for 5 min or at the potential of 0. 3 V for 90 s, and produced two well-defined oxidation peaks of guanine and adenine residues at 0. 80 V and 1. 11 V in pH 5. 0 phosphate buffer, respectively, while the native DNA almost did not appear at the same condition. This adsorptive stripping method {{can be used to}} study the properties of DNA using simple CV technique. A convenient quantitation of the low level of thermally <b>denatured</b> <b>DNA</b> was proposed. The detection limit of thermally <b>denatured</b> <b>DNA</b> was ca. 2. 0 mg mLÿ 1 when the accumulation time is 150 s at the potential of 0. 3 V. As comparison, the acid-denatured DNA (treated in HClO 4 solution) was tested at the same condition and a detection limit of 0. 10 mg mL ÿ 1 was obtained...|$|E
40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{interaction}} of poly(rA) and poly(rU) with natural DNAs containing (dA. dT) n sequences. The results indicate that hybridization of poly(rA) to <b>denatured</b> <b>DNA</b> {{can be used to}} estimate the size and frequency of large (dA. dT) n tracts, whereas hybridization with poly(rU) does not give reliable information on these points. In 6. 6 M CsCl, poly(rU) can form stable complexes with <b>denatured</b> <b>DNA</b> containing short (dA) n tracts (n {{less than or equal to}} 6), whereas binding of poly(rA) to <b>denatured</b> <b>DNA</b> under these conditions requires much larger (dT) n tracts (estimated n greater than 13). Moreover, binding of poly(rA) requires pre-hybridization in low salt, because free poly(rA) precipitates in 6. 6 M CsCl...|$|E
40|$|The {{response}} of populations of Bacillus subtilis to both native deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and <b>denatured</b> <b>DNA</b> was investigated at maximal competence and {{at various times}} during the development of compentency. The results indicate that competence for transformation with native and <b>denatured</b> <b>DNA</b> increases and decreases simultaneously. Competition occurs between native and single-stranded DNA during transformation, and the same cells in a population can be doubly transformed by DNA molecules of both configurations...|$|E
40|$|Rifampicin and streptolydigin, if used in {{conjunction}} with nystatin, depress the growth of Kluyveromyces lactis. The incorporation of labeled leucine into protein is inhibited by nystatin whereas the incorporation of labeled uracil into RNA is inhibited by rifampicin in nystatin-treated cells. In order to study the mechanism of inhibition of RNA synthesis we purified by DEAE-Sephadex column chromatography four forms of RNA polymerase from K. lactis cells. The general properties of these enyzmes {{are similar to those of}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae and of other eukaryotic RNA polymerases. In particular, enzymes IA, IB and III are more active with poly[d(A-T) ] template and Mn- 2 + than with native or <b>denatured</b> calf thymus <b>DNA.</b> Enzyme II shows optimal activity with <b>denatured</b> calf thymus <b>DNA</b> and Mn 2 +. When challenged with native calf thymus DNA all enzymes prefer Mg- 2 + as a divalent cation whereas with <b>denatured</b> calf thymus <b>DNA</b> all enzymes are more active with Mn- 2 +. Enzyme II is inhibited by lambda-amanitin but no enzyme is sensitive to rifampicin and streptolydigin. The inhibition of growth and uracil uptake observed when rifampicin is added to nystatin treated cells is probably not caused by a specific inhibition of transcription...|$|R
