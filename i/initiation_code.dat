40|$|Post-translational {{modifications}} of core histones {{play an important}} role in the epigenetic regulation of chromatin dynamics and gene expression. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae methylation marks at K 4, K 36, and K 79 of histone H 3 are associated with gene transcription. Although Set 2 -mediated H 3 K 36 methylation is enriched throughout the coding region of active genes and prevents aberrant transcriptional <b>initiation</b> within <b>coding</b> sequences, it is not known if transcription of one locus impacts the methylation pattern of neighbouring areas and for how long H 3 K 36 methylation is maintained after transcription termination. Our results demonstrate that H 3 K 36 methylation is restricted to the transcribed sequence only and the modification does not spread to adjacent loci downstream from transcription termination site. We also show that H 3 K 36 trimethylation mark persists in the locus for at least 60 minutes after transcription inhibition, suggesting a short epigenetic memory for recently occurred transcriptional activity. Our results indicate that both replication-dependent exchange of nucleosomes and the activity of histone demethylases Rph 1, Jhd 1 and Gis 1 contribute to the turnover of H 3 K 36 methylation upon shut-down of transcription...|$|R
40|$|The dialogues {{of regular}} {{classroom}} teachers with 12 learning-disabled (LD) students and 12 classmates were recorded, and <b>initiations</b> were <b>coded</b> into three categories: content of instruction, behavior management, and social overture. Teachers initiated conversation more frequently with LD students than comparison students. The majority (63 %) of teacher initiations to LD students involved behavior management, {{and these were}} over five times more likely compared to those received by classmates. Further analysis showed that teacher initiations for behavior management were primarily in response to LD student inattentiveness and rule infraction. LD children {{did not differ from}} classmates in the overall frequency of initiations to teacher; however, the initiations of LD children were more often situationally inappropriate. Finally, teacher initiations to LD children pertaining to the monitoring of instruction, inattention, and rule infraction occurred more often in whole-class seatwork as opposed to small-group settings. Results were interpreted in light of other evidence linking the frequency of teacher-child interaction to poor achievement, as well as to teacher perceptions of LD students.

40|$|The Set 2 -Rpd 3 S pathway is {{important}} for the control of transcription memory.

Specifically, deletion of the Set 2 histone methyltransferase or Rco 1, a component of the Rpd 3 S histone deacetylase complex leads to hyperacetylation of certain open reading frames (ORFs). We used this mutant as a system to study the role of histone modifications and co-activator recruitment in preinitiation complex (PIC) formation. Specifically, we looked at the dependence of promoters on the bromodomain-containing RSC complex and the Bdf 1 protein. We found that the dependence of cryptic promoters for these proteins varied. Overall, our data indicate that cryptic promoters are independently regulated, and their activation is dependent on factors that govern gene activation at canonical promoters...|$|R
40|$|A core {{promoter}} is {{a minimal}} region sufficient {{to direct the}} accurate initiation of transcription. Various core promoter elements have been discovered that recruit and position transcriptional machinery, which then initiates transcription at individual transcription start sites (TSS); however, no universal promoter code has been established. The methods and results presented in this thesis focus on innovative analysis of precise transcription initiation data to reveal sequence and chromatin features underlying core promoters and their dynamic usage in development and differentiation. Cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) provides a single base-pair resolution map of TSSs and their relative usage, {{and it is a}} powerful tool for studying promoter structure and function. It has led to the discovery of major promoter classes that differ in transcription initiation patterns: “sharp” promoters in which the majority of transcription starts at one clearly dominant TSS, and “broad” promoters with multiple equally used TSS positions distributed along a wider region. By applying CAGE to a developmental time-course of zebrafish (Danio rerio) we created a first comprehensive map of transcription initiation during vertebrate embryogenesis and revealed widespread dynamics in promoter usage at all levels, from alternative promoters to individual TSSs. We found that thousands of promoters are utilized differently by the oocyte and the embryo, uncovering two independent codes that drive dynamic changes in TSS usage and promoter shape. Maternal TSS selection is guided by an A/T-rich W-box motif positioned at a fixed spacing from the TSS producing a sharp promoter architecture, whereas zygotic selection is restricted by the position of the first downstream nucleosome and produces broad promoter architecture with the dominant TSS aligned to inter- and intranucleosomal sequence positioning signals. The two grammars co-exist in close proximity or in physical overlap at promoters genome-wide. We further showed that a tight association between dominant TSS in broad promoters and nucleosome positioning exists in human and mouse transcription. Alignment of the intranucleosomal dinucleotide frequency patterns downstream of the TSS revealed that a well-positioned + 1 nucleosome is a key determinant of TSS preference in broad promoters. Its presence in both zebrafish and mammals suggests the evolutionary conservation of the underlying nucleosome-associated TSS selection mechanism. Precise TSS localisation is crucial for promoter-centred analyses of any genomewide data. To facilitate the reuse of high-resolution and context-specific TSSs derived from a growing resource of CAGE data, we developed CAGEr, an R/Bioconductor software package for promoterome mining. CAGEr provides easy access to the majority of published CAGE datasets and presents a comprehensive workflow for processing, visualisation and analysis of precise promoter data, and allows its integration with other genome data types. Taken together, the work presented in this thesis reveals unexpected dynamics in core promoter usage at TSS level and demonstrates that promoter type is not an inherent property of the genomic locus, but is rather dependent on the regulatory context. The existence of overlapping transcription <b>initiation</b> <b>codes</b> has important implications for future analyses of promoter content and function. </p...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} was the detection of circoviruses in neglected host species, including honey bees, exotic reptiles and free-living amoebae by widely used broad-spectrum polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays specific for the replication <b>initiation</b> protein <b>coding</b> gene of these viruses. The majority of sequences obtained from honey bees were highly similar to canine and porcine circoviruses, or, were distantly related to dragonfly cycloviruses. Other rep sequences detected in some honey bees, reptiles and amoebae showed similarities to various rep sequences deposited in the GenBank. Back-to-back PCR primers designed for the amplification of whole viral genomes failed to work that suggested the existence of integrated rep-like elements in many samples. Rolling circle amplification and exonuclease treatment confirmed the absence of small circular DNA genomes in the specimens analysed. In case of honey bees Varroa mite DNA contamination might be a source of the identified endogenous rep-like elements. The reptile and amoebae rep-like sequences were nearly identical {{with each other and with}} sequences detected in chimpanzee feces raising the possibility that detection of novel or unusual rep-like elements in some host species might originate from the microbial community of the host.

In Escherichia coli, UUG is estimated to serve as initiator for about 3% of the bacterium's proteins (Blattner et al. 1997). CUG is known to function as an initiator for one plasmid-encoded protein (RepA) in E. coli (Spiers and Bergquist, 1992).

Previous studies have only used unimanual aiming tasks and, as such, only examined the effects of competition that occurs within a limb. The results of studies using unimanual aiming movements often reveal an "ipsilateral effect" [...] distractors {{on the same side of}} space as the effector cause greater interference than distractors on the opposite side of space.

Participants made ipsilateral reaches (left hand to left targets, right hand to right targets). In contrast to studies using unimanual aiming movements, a "contralateral effect" was observed; distractors affording responses for the other hand (in contralateral space) caused more interference than distractors affording responses for the same hand.

Besides in the brain, the melanocortin 4 receptor is expressed in numerous peripheral tissues in the chicken. To examine whether or not the peripheral melanocortin 4 receptor signaling could be regulated by AGRP, we cloned and localized the expression of the AGRP gene in the chicken. The chicken AGRP gene was found to encode a 154 or 165 amino acid protein, depending on the usage of two alternative translation <b>initiation</b> sites. The <b>coding</b> sequence consisted of three exons, like that of mammalian species. The C-terminal cysteine-rich region of the predicted AGRP displayed high levels of identity to mammalian counterparts (78 – 84 %) and all 10 cysteine residues conferring functional conformation of AGRP were conserved; however, other regions showed apparently no homology, suggesting that biological activities of AGRP are located in its C-terminal region. RT-PCR analysis detected the AGRP mRNA in all tissues examined: the brain, adrenal gland, heart, liver, spleen, gonads, kidney, uropygial gland, skeletal muscle and adipose tissues. Interestingly, the skin also expressed the AGRP mRNA, where Agouti, another melanocortin receptor antagonist regulating hair pigmentation, is expressed in rodents. Most of those AGRP-expressing tissues have been demonstrated to express melanocortin 4 receptors and/or other subtypes of melanocortin receptor whose mammalian counterparts can bind AGRP. These results imply the possibility that some peripheral melanocortin systems could be regulated by the functional interaction between melanocortins and AGRP at melanocortin receptors in the chicken...|$|R

V., Preston, G. M., Guggino, W. B. & Agre, P. (1994) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 91, 13052 - 13056]. Similar to other aquaporins, the AQP 4 gene is composed of four exons encoding 127, 55, 27, and 92 amino acids separated by introns of 0. 8, 0. 3, and 5. 2 kb. Unlike other aquaporins, an alternative <b>coding</b> <b>initiation</b> sequence (designated exon 0) was located 2. 7 kb upstream of exon 1. When spliced together, M 1 and the subsequent 10 amino acids are encoded by exon 0; the next 11 amino acids and M 23 are encoded by exon 1. Transcription initiation sites have been mapped in the proximal promoters of exons 0 and 1.
