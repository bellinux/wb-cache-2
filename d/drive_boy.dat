50|$|Many women {{identify}} that machismo is perpetuated {{through the}} pressure to raise children a certain way and instill social constructions of gender throughout a child’s development.

It creates a sense of inferiority that <b>drives</b> <b>boys</b> to reach an unattainable level of masculinity, a pursuit often validated by the aggressive and apathetic behavior they observe in the men around them and ultimately leading them to continue the cycle.|$|R

5000|$|The Spring Symphony {{is made up}} of four parts, which {{correspond}} to the movements of a conventional symphony: Allegro with slow introduction, slow movement, scherzo, and finale. Part I begins with the dark and mysterious Shine Out, a poem to the sun. Several more songs follow, including The <b>Driving</b> <b>Boy,</b> which is a piece that features the boys' choir, at times whistling, and tambourine. The second part has several solos and quiet choruses and references to the month of May. The third part looks forward to May and then to summer. The Finale, London, to Thee I do Present, comes to a climax when the entire chorus joins in a wordless, full-throated waltz representing the May revellers fortified by wine and ale (borne out by some rather unexpected modulations). The climax of the movement is the moment when the children’s voices, accompanied by unison French horns, re-enter the scene and sing the 13th century round Sumer is icumen in. The simple tune, sung in 2/4 time over the unyielding 3/4 waltz {{of the rest of the}} ensemble, finally achieves dominance. Eventually the celebrations subside, and the Maylord then offers a final blessing with the proclamation: [...] "And so, my friends, I cease." ...|$|R
