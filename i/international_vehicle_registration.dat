40|$|The {{following}} palindromes {{are additional}} to those listed in Palindromicon II. Although I have removed some candidates, those below {{are accompanied by}} sufficient information that the reader can accept or reject each as desired. My own criteria for acceptance {{differ from those of}} the Palindromicon, so this list is not precisely an addition to that work. However, I, like it, have omitted almost all initialism (CFC), also musical terms (fff), Roman numerals (MCM), chess notation (PxP), and <b>international</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>registrations</b> (GBG), except for one or two. Abbreviations like Mdm, and morpheme-medial clusters like rtr are also omitted. The list is dominated by place names, because I gave my dictionary words to the Palindromicon editors...|$|R
50|$|Motor <b>vehicle</b> <b>{{registration}}</b> is {{the registration}} of {{a motor vehicle}} with a government authority, either compulsory or otherwise.

While almost all motor vehicles are uniquely identified by a vehicle identification number, only registered vehicles display a <b>vehicle</b> <b>registration</b> plate and carry a <b>vehicle</b> <b>registration</b> certificate. Motor <b>vehicle</b> <b>registration</b> is different from motor vehicle licensing and roadworthiness certification.|$|R
