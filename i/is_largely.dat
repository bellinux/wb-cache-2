50|$|It {{has been}} thought that {{through most of}} Earth's history, oceans <b>were</b> <b>largely</b> oxygen-deficient. During the Archean, euxinia <b>was</b> <b>largely</b> absent because of low {{availability}} of sulfate in the oceans, but during the Proterozoic, it would become more common.|$|R
50|$|Until 1947, {{the second}} track <b>was</b> <b>largely</b> {{dismantled}} for reparations to the Soviet Union, but it <b>was</b> <b>largely</b> restored from Halle to Sangerhausen by 1954. In 1965, the line near Berga-Kelbra was relocated {{for the new}} Kelbra Dam on the Helme.|$|R
50|$|The {{museum has}} a wide and varied events {{programme}} that changes every year. Events <b>are</b> <b>largely</b> family-focussed, with some events aimed at an older adult audience.

50|$|The album Ave Fénix {{released}} in 2001 {{was produced by}} Loris Ceroni and <b>was</b> <b>largely</b> inspired by Cher's comeback effort Believe, adopting her smooth vocals with dance beats.

5|$|A bulk carrier's design <b>is</b> <b>largely</b> {{defined by}} the cargo it will carry. The cargo's density, also known as its stowage factor, is the key factor. Densities for common bulk cargoes vary from 0.6tons per cubic meter for light grains to 3tons per cubic meter for iron ore.|$|E
5|$|A solitary male {{purple-throated cotinga}} attracts a female by {{perching}} above the canopy {{and letting the}} sun highlight its iridescent plumage. The breeding behavior of this species <b>is</b> <b>largely</b> unknown, but the range in molting times implies that this species may breed year-round.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} forms of climbing, bouldering {{technique}} <b>is</b> <b>largely</b> centered on proper footwork. Leg muscles are significantly stronger than arm muscles; thus, proficient boulderers use their arms primarily to maintain balance and body positioning, relying on their legs to push them up the boulder. Boulderers also keep their arms straight whenever possible, allowing their bones to support their body weight rather than their muscles.|$|E

5|$|Beryllium's {{chemical}} behavior <b>is</b> <b>largely</b> {{a result}} of its small atomic and ionic radii. It thus has very high ionization potentials and strong polarization while bonded to other atoms, which is why all of its compounds are covalent. It is more chemically similar to aluminium than its close neighbors in the periodic table due to having a similar charge-to-radius ratio.|$|E
5|$|Beyond the endemic {{internal}} power struggles, the TFG has faced {{far more serious}} problems in establishing its authority and rebuilding the structures of governance. Its writ has never extended much beyond Baidoa. Its control of Mogadishu is ever more contested, and it <b>is</b> <b>largely</b> under siege {{in the rest of}} the country. There are no properly functioning government institutions.|$|E
5|$|Castelli <b>is</b> <b>largely</b> {{ignored in}} the historiography of Argentina. Most historians focus instead on the {{disputes}} between Mariano Moreno and Cornelio Saavedra in the Junta, with Castelli described in passing as a supporter of Moreno. Despite of {{his role in the}} May Revolution, he was not the clear leader of it, as José Gervasio Artigas was for the Cry of Asencio or Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla for the Cry of Dolores. The May Revolution was instead the result of the convergence of diverse factions that shared the desire to remove the viceroy, and different historians highlight different specific factions. Castelli <b>is</b> <b>largely</b> ignored in Bolivia as well. His support of indigenous rights—still an ongoing issue in the country—and his religious ideas strongly affect the way he is perceived there.|$|E
50|$|Sheffield Manor {{was built}} in 1510 as an {{alternative}} residence for the Earl of Shrewsbury. The manor was to later become famous when Mary, Queen of Scots, was imprisoned there.
