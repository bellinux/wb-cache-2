50|$|Issues 20-23 (arc 8) {{deal with}} a very young mutant killer seeking asylum at Xavier's Institute. Emma Frost {{promptly}} kicks out members Sage and Bishop when they visit because she believes that mutants should police themselves. The team breaks into the mansion to bring the boy to the proper authorities. However, a possessed Emma intercepts them. She is possessed by Elias Bogan, an old acquaintance from the Hellfire Club that she and Sage have met before. After an argument with Professor X elsewhere, Ororo arrives to help her team mates. However, old emotions rise to the surface as Ororo fights Emma <b>Frost.</b> Emma <b>shakes</b> the possession outside the manison during the fight, but they continue to battle until Storm shows that she's willing to kill Emma and {{has the ability to}} do so. Elias Bogan proves to be the threat behind the murders. Storm and Emma pull it together long enough to facilitate the rest of the team's escape, who then stop Bogan, though certainly not for good. The philosophical rift between the two groups of X-Men reaches its peak here when the X-Treme X-Men promise not to return to the mansion again until the dream of peaceful coexistence is, once again, the goal the X-Men, instead of what the X-Treme X-Men believe to be isolationism and possible mutant supremacy.|$|R
40|$|This is an Accepted Manuscript of {{an article}} {{published}} by Taylor & Francis in Ergonomics in 2004, available online: [URL] accumulation in sleeping bags during extended periods of use is detrimental to thermal comfort of the sleeper, and in extreme cases may lead to sleep loss and hypothermia. As sub-zero temperatures were expected to affect vapour resistance of microporous membranes, the effect of using semipermeable and impermeable rain covers for sleeping bags on the accumulation of moisture in the bags during 6 days of use at − 7 °C and 5 days at − 20 °C were investigated. In addition, the routine of shaking off hoarfrost {{from the inside of}} the cover after the sleep period as a preventive measure for moisture accumulation was studied. Moisture accumulation (ranging from 92 to 800 grams) was found {{to be related to the}} vapour resistance of the materials used. The best semipermeable material gave the same moisture build-up as no cover at − 7 °C, though build-up increased substantially at − 20 °C. Shaking off the hoarfrost from the inside of the cover after each use was beneficial in preventing a high moisture build-up. It was concluded that semi-permeable cover materials reduce moisture accumulation in sleeping bags at moderate sub-zero temperatures, but in more extreme cold (− 20 °C) the benefits are reduced in comparison to routinely <b>shaking</b> <b>frost</b> from impermeable covers. Compared to fixed impermeable covers, the benefits of all semi-permeable covers are large. For long-term use without drying facilities, the differences observed do favour the semi-permeable covers above impermeable ones, even when regularly removing the hoar frost from the inside in the latter...|$|R
