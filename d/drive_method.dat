The heat causes the cylinder, known as a hohlraum (German for [...] "hollow room", or cavity), to re-emit the energy as intense X-rays, which are more evenly distributed and symmetrical than the original laser beams.

40|$|Several {{authors have}} {{proposed}} sensor scheduling <b>methods</b> that are <b>driven</b> by information theoretic measures. In the information driven approach, the relative merit of different sensing actions {{is measured by}} the corresponding expected gain in information. Information driven approaches stand in stark contrast to task <b>driven</b> <b>methods,</b> i. e., methods that select some physical performance criteria and explicitly manage the sensor based on that criteria. This paper investigates the difference between a particular information driven approach, one that maximizes an alpha-Rényi measure of information gain, and task <b>driven</b> <b>methods</b> with a combination of theory and simulation. First, we give a mathematical relation that shows that when the decision error depends only weakly on the target state a certain type of marginalized information gain is a close approximation to the Bayes risk associated with performing a specific task. Second, we perform an empirical comparison between information driven and task driven approaches that maximize information gain or minimize risk, respectively. In particular, we give a task <b>driven</b> <b>method</b> that uses the sensor {{in a manner that is}} expected to maximize the probability the target is correctly located after the next measurement. We find as expected that the task <b>driven</b> <b>method</b> outperforms the information <b>driven</b> <b>method</b> when the performance is measured by risk, i. e., probability of localization error. However, the performance difference between the two methods is very small, suggesting that the information gain is a good surrogate for risk for this application...|$|R

5000|$|Like NIF, LMJ {{intends to}} use the [...] "indirect drive" [...] approach, where the laser light is used to heat a high-Z {{cylinder}} made of some heavy metal (often gold) known as a [...] "hohlraum". The hohlraum then gives off x-rays, which are used to heat a small fuel pellet containing a deuterium-tritium (DT) fusion fuel. Although considerable laser energy is lost to heating the hohlraum, x-rays are much more efficient at heating the fuel pellet, making the indirect <b>drive</b> <b>method</b> applicable to nuclear weapons research. The x-rays rapidly heat the outer layer of the pellet so quickly that it explodes outward, causing {{the remainder of the}} pellet to be forced inward and causes a shock wave to travel in through the pellet to the middle. When the shock wave converges from all directions and meets in the middle, the density and temperature briefly reach the Lawson criterion and start fusion reactions. If the rate of reactions is high enough the heat generated by these reactions will be enough to cause surrounding fuel to fuse as well, this process continuing until the majority of the fuel in the pellet is consumed. This process is known as [...] "ignition", and has long been a goal of fusion researchers.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a data and digital-contracts <b>driven</b> (DDCD) <b>method</b> for pricing various complex options. The DDCD method is a {{combination}} of nonparametric and parametric methods. In general, nonparametric data <b>driven</b> <b>methods</b> use observed data as training data of a learning network directly. Different from these, in the proposed DDCD method, some European-style digital contracts (DCs) of the underlying assets are added as auxiliary information to guide the learning process of the pricing formula. The DCs can be obtained by using the observed data according to parametric methods. Thus, the DCs are actually used as the hints of the pricing formula, and then the DDCD method has superior pricing accuracy to the common data <b>driven</b> <b>method</b> in practical applications. Some Monte Carlo simulation experiments are performed and the results demonstrate that the proposed method not only has the advantages of generalization and superior accuracy, as the non-parametric method has, but also has the property of robustness to financial data with noise, as the parametric method has. ...|$|R

40|$|A novel <b>drive</b> <b>method</b> is {{proposed}} {{to increase the}} vibration amplitude of drive mode of silicon vibratory gyroscopes based on the nonlinear dynamics research made in this paper. A nonlinear dynamic equation, considering the nonlinear mechanical-elastic and electrostatic force, was firstly deduced according to the simplified structure schematic of drive mode. Then, experiments were made to characterize the nonlinear amplitude-frequency response characteristic {{as well as its}} dependence on drive voltage. Besides, by solving the nondimensional nonlinear dynamics using Matlab and Simulink, the influence of initial status of drive mode, that is, the displacement and the velocity, on the stable vibration amplitude was presented. The amplitude-frequency characteristic was also analyzed by simulation. The result of simulation shows good agreement with that of experiments. When nonlinearity is present in the amplitude-frequency characteristic, there is a wide flat region with larger amplitude than the peak amplitude obtained in the linear characteristic. Finally, a novel <b>drive</b> <b>method</b> was presented to excite the nonlinear vibration of large amplitude in the downwards-sweeping characteristic curve.
