5|$|Hand's civil {{instincts}} were at {{odds with}} the duty of a judge to stay aloof from politics. As a judge he respected even bad laws; as a member of society he felt free to question the decisions behind legislation. In his opinion, members of a democratic society should be involved in legislative decision-making. He therefore regarded toleration as a prerequisite of civil liberty. In practice, this even meant that those who wish to promote ideas repugnant to the majority should be <b>free</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so, within broad limits.|$|E
5|$|Mountbatten {{stressed}} {{that he would}} act as the trustee of the princes' commitment, as he would be serving as India's head of state well into 1948. He engaged in a personal dialogue with reluctant princes, such as the Nawab of Bhopal, who he asked through a confidential letter to sign the Instrument of Accession making Bhopal part of India, which Mountbatten would keep locked up in his safe. It would be handed to the States Department on 15 August only if the Nawab did not change his mind before then, which he was <b>free</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> The Nawab agreed, and did not renege over the deal.|$|E
5|$|The {{restructuring}} {{also called}} for the reduction of four services on the Meråker Line and two services to Oppdal, terminating all commuter train services on the lines. For the service to Oppdal, NSB had an operating deficit of NOK1.7 million and 21,000 passengers in 1998. The Meråker Line had about {{twice the number of}} passengers. The National Rail Administration stated that if any private companies wanted to operate the routes without subsidies, they were <b>free</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. As compensation, travelers between Trondheim and Rennebu and Oppdal with month passes were allowed to not pay for seat reservations on the intercity services. Sør-Trøndelag County Municipality applied to the ministry to take over responsibility and purchase the commuter train services, so they could continue the service to Oppdal, but this was rejected by the ministry.|$|E

5|$|At the time, the Hall Institute was in {{the early}} stages of rapid expansion. The new {{director}} of the Institute, Charles Kellaway, wanted to increase the activities of the organisation to not only support hospital operations but have separate research groups in physiology, microbiology and biochemistry that would also do independent studies. He also hoped to raise the standards to make the Institute comparable to the world-class operations in Europe and America. Kellaway took a liking to Burnet and saw him as the best young talent in the Institute with the ability to help raise it to world leading standards. However, he thought that Burnet would need experience working in a laboratory in England before he could lead his own research group on bacteriology in Australia. Burnet left Australia for England in 1925 and served as ship's surgeon during his journey in exchange for a free fare. On arrival, he took a paid position assisting the curator of the National Collection of Type Cultures at the Lister Institute in London. Burnet prepared or maintained bacteria cultures for other researchers in the morning and was <b>free</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> his own experiments in the afternoon. During the latter half of 1926, he experimented to see if Salmonella typhimurium was affected by bacteriophage.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A {{model of}} a multiprocessing, {{multiprogramming}} computer system with serially reusable programs was developed to study the effect of serial programs on system performance. Two strategies for implementing serially reusable programs were investigated, a wait strategy in which the processor waits until the serial program is available, and a switch strategy, in which the processor is <b>freed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> other work. Relative performances and asymptotic conditions as functions {{of the number of}} processors, processes, serially reus-able programs, and the fraction of time each process executes serially reusable programs were obtained. Quantitative results are pre-sented showing that the switch strategy is superior. The wait strategy causes quick saturation when the number of processes is increased...|$|R
