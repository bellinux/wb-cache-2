2500|$|Andradite is a calcium-iron garnet, Ca3Fe2(SiO4)3, is of {{variable}} composition {{and may be}} red, yellow, brown, green or black. The recognized varieties are topazolite (yellow or green), <b>demantoid</b> (green) and melanite (black). Andradite is found both in deep-seated igneous rocks like syenite as well as serpentines, schists, and crystalline limestone. <b>Demantoid</b> {{has been called the}} [...] "emerald of the Urals" [...] from its occurrence there, {{and is one of the}} most prized of garnet varieties. Topazolite is a golden-yellow variety and melanite is a black variety.|$|E
2500|$|Another fragile {{candidate}} mineral is sphalerite (zinc blende). Gem-quality {{material is}} usually a strong yellow to honey brown, orange, red, or green; its very high RI (2.37) and dispersion (0.156) make for an extremely lustrous and fiery gem, {{and it is also}} isotropic. But here again, its low hardness (2.5–4) and perfect dodecahedral cleavage preclude sphalerite's wide use in jewelry. Two calcium-rich members of the garnet group fare much better: these are grossularite (usually brownish orange, rarely colorless, yellow, green, or pink) and andradite. The latter is the rarest and most costly of the garnets, with three of its varieties—topazolite (yellow), melanite (black), and <b>demantoid</b> (green)—sometimes seen in jewelry. <b>Demantoid</b> (literally [...] "diamond-like") especially has been prized as a gemstone since its discovery in the Ural Mountains in 1868; it is a noted feature of antique Russian and Art Nouveau jewelry. Titanite or sphene is also seen in antique jewelry; it is typically some shade of chartreuse and has a luster, RI (1.885–2.050), and dispersion (0.051) high enough to be mistaken for diamond, yet it is anisotropic (a high birefringence of 0.105–0.135) and soft (hardness 5.5).|$|E
2500|$|Discovered the 1960s, {{the rich}} green tsavorite variety of {{grossular}} {{is also very}} popular. Both grossular and andradite are isotropic and have relatively high RIs (around 1.74 and 1.89 respectively) and high dispersions (0.027 and 0.057), with demantoid's exceeding diamond. However, both have a low hardness (6.5–7.5) and invariably possess inclusions atypical for diamond—the byssolite [...] "horsetails" [...] seen in <b>demantoid</b> are one striking example. Furthermore, most are very small, typically under 0.5 carats (100mg) in weight. Their lusters range from vitreous to subadamantine, to almost metallic in the usually opaque melanite, which {{has been used to}} simulate black diamond. Some natural spinel is also deep black and could serve this same purpose.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the commercially-important deposits in Russia and Namibia, <b>demantoids</b> are also found in other some places, including Italy (Val Malenco, Lombardy), Iran (Kerman), and Afghanistan.|$|R
50|$|<b>Demantoids</b> are {{generally}} small, with finished stones generally under 1 carat mg and stones over 2 carat mg are rare. Stones over 3 carat mg are very rare.|$|R
50|$|Iran {{produces}} orpiment and realgar arsenic concentrates, silver, asbestos, borax, hydraulic cement, clays (bentonite, industrial, and kaolin), diatomite, feldspar, fluorspar, turquoise, industrial {{or glass}} sand (quartzite and silica), lime, magnesite, nitrogen (of ammonia and urea), perlite, natural ocher and iron oxide mineral pigments, pumice and related volcanic materials, caustic soda, stones and decorative stones (including granite, marble, travertine, dolomite, and limestone), celestite, natural sulfates (aluminum potassium sulfate and sodium sulfate), amber, tungsten, agate, lapislazuli and talc. Iran also produces ferromanganese, ferromolybdenum, nepheline syenite, <b>demantoids,</b> phosphate rock, selenium, shell, andalusite, rockwool, garnet, gabbro, diorite, vermiculite, attapulgite, calcium, barium, rare earth elements, scandium, yttrium and zeolite, {{and had the}} capacity to mine onyx. Iran also has large deposits of herbertsmithite around the city of Anarak.|$|R
50|$|<b>Demantoid</b> is {{the green}} {{gemstone}} {{variety of the}} mineral andradite, {{a member of the}} garnet group of minerals. Andradite is a calcium- and iron-rich garnet. The chemical formula is Ca3Fe2(SiO4)3 with chromium substitution as the cause of the <b>demantoid</b> green color. Ferric iron is the cause of the yellow in the stone.|$|E
50|$|Around 2009, {{there was}} a {{significant}} discovery of <b>demantoid</b> and andradite garnet in Madagascar.|$|E
5000|$|Topazolite: Yellow-green {{in color}} and {{sometimes}} of high enough quality to be cut into a faceted gemstone, it is rarer than <b>demantoid.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A {{significant}} new find of <b>demantoid</b> and andradite {{took place in}} Namibia in 1996 at what is now dubbed the [...] "Green Dragon" [...] mine.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Demantoid</b> is {{the green}} variety of {{andradite}} garnet, so demantoids are always primarily green (by definition), but the exact shade ranges {{from a very}} strong yellowish green to nearly {{the color of a}} fine emerald. Some stones have a brownish cast, which is due to iron. Its dispersion (0.057) is unusually high, and this is often visible as [...] "fire" [...] (rainbow-coloured flashes of light), although in some cases the stone's green body colour can render this effect less noticeable. Their luster is adamantine. <b>Demantoid</b> also has a high refractive index of 1.80 to 1.89.|$|E
5000|$|In 1849, Nordenskjold {{examined}} {{what was}} known as [...] "Ural's chrysolite" [...] and discovered {{that it was a}} rich green variety of andradite garnet. In 1854, he proposed for it the name <b>demantoid</b> ("like a diamond").|$|E
50|$|A second {{find was}} made 75 km. {{to the south}} of Ekaterinburg, on the Chusovaya and Chrisolitka Rivers {{southwest}} of the village of Poldnevaya. Deposits are also found underground up to 3 meters deep in the <b>demantoid</b> placier. In all, there are five deposits of <b>demantoid</b> in this area. Possessing an unusual green color and a dispersion greater than that of diamond, it quickly became a treasured and expensive gemstone. From the time of the demantoids find until about 1919, they were popular in Russia as the famous Peter Carl Fabergé made jewelry with them. In austere Communist Russia, these gems went out of style.|$|E
5000|$|Russian <b>demantoid</b> often contain {{inclusions}} of chrysotile, [...] {{which is}} a type of asbestos. These fibers radiate out from a very small crystal of chromite. These inclusions are feathery golden threads that tend to curve and resemble the tail of a horse, and are therefore referred to as horsetail inclusions. In gemology, the presence of such inclusions is regarded as 'diagnostic' for natural <b>demantoid</b> (i.e. these inclusions are not found in any other green gemstone). Some gemstones are more valuable for their inclusions, and 'horsetails' can be regarded as desirable features in <b>demantoid,</b> as they are taken as an indication of prestigious Russian origin, although some demantoids from certain other locations (such as Italy and Iran) may also contain 'horsetails', which are regarded as being characteristic of a serpentinite geographic origin, and, on the other hand, not all Russian demantoids actually contain 'horsetails'.The microstructure of some demantoids is believed to be affected by the presence of 'horsetails' (the 'horsetail' typically originates towards the centre of the nodule, with the fibres branching out and radiating towards the surface), whereas horsetail-free demantoids from other sources frequently display flat crystal faces.|$|E
50|$|In {{approximately}} 2003, reports {{began to}} circulate {{in the trade}} that some Russian <b>demantoid</b> garnets were being routinely subjected to heat treatment {{in order to enhance}} their color. Such treatment is believed to be performed at relatively low temperatures and is thought not to be detectable by gemological testing.|$|E
50|$|Edward H. Schafer, an eminent {{scholar of}} Tang dynasty {{literature}} and history, discussed langgan in several books and articles. His proposed identifications gradually changed from Mediterranean red coral (1961), to coral or a glass-like gem (1963), to chrysoprase or <b>demantoid</b> (1965), to coral or red spinel (1967), {{and ultimately to}} malachite (1978).|$|E
50|$|The {{exterior}} of the egg resembles frost and ice crystals formed on clear glass. It is studded with 1,660 diamonds, and is made from quartz, platinum, and orthoclase. The miniature surprise basket is studded with 1,378 diamonds and is made from platinum and gold, while the flowers are made of white quartz and the leaves are made of <b>demantoid.</b> The flowers lie in gold moss. The egg is 102 millimeters high.|$|E

5000|$|Although garnets {{have been}} known since ancient times, the <b>demantoid</b> variety was not {{discovered}} until 1868 in Russia's western central Ural Mountains. The find was an alluvial deposit about 110 kilometers from Ekaterinburg, north by northwest along the Bobrovka River, {{near the village of}} Elizavetinskoye. Miners were immediately stunned by the highly refractive nature of the gem material, which is atypical for garnet. They began comparing it to diamond and referred to it as [...] "demantoid", from the French demant, meaning diamond. The reason is obvious, with its high brilliance and dispersion.|$|E

5000|$|After graduating, Yavorskyy {{spent several}} years {{traveling}} and trading gemstones in Germany, Italy, and France, making a living as an independent dealer. He traveled to the United States where he opened his first office in New York in 1995. He moved to Bangkok in 1999 where he opened a gem-cutting business. Yavorskyy continued dealing primarily in spinel in his early career, concentrating on the lesser known gem as opposed to commercial stones such as rubies, sapphires, and emeralds. Throughout the years, Yavorskyy has become a specialist {{in a number of}} gems, including unheated sapphires, rubies, <b>demantoid</b> garnets, tsavorite garnets, and more. He has become known best for his unique cut, color, clarity and overall high standard of the stones he sells.|$|E
50|$|Comparing blue-green {{stones that}} were known in early East Asia, Schafer disqualified several {{conceivable}} identities; <b>demantoid</b> garnet and green tourmaline are rarely of gem quality, while neither apple-green chrysoprase nor light greenish-blue turquoise typically have dark hues. This leaves malachite,This handsome green carbonate of copper has important credentials. It is {{often found in}} copper mines, and is therefore regularly {{at the disposal of}} copper- and bronze-producing peoples. It has, in certain varieties, a lovely silky luster, caused by its fibrous structure. It is soft and easily cut. It takes a good polish. It was commonly made into beads both in the western and eastern worlds. Above all, even uncut malachite often has a nodular or botryoidal structure, like little clumps of bright green beads, one of the classical forms attributed to lang-kan. Sometimes, too, it is stalactitic, like little stone trees. (1978: 33) Furthermore, archeology confirms that malachite was an important gemstone of pre-Han China. Inlays of malachite and turquoise decorated many early Chinese bronze weapons and ritual vessels (MOMA 1980: 38, 188).|$|E
