5|$|However, the United Kingdom courts {{gradually}} {{adopted a}} single sufficient <b>interest</b> <b>test</b> for all prerogative orders. In R. v. Commissioners of Customs and Excise, ex parte Cook (1969), for example, the High Court used a sufficient <b>interest</b> <b>test</b> {{to determine whether}} an applicant had standing {{to apply for a}} mandatory order. Singapore followed the UK's move towards a uniform test for all prerogative orders. In Re Lim Chor Pee, ex parte Law Society of Singapore (1986), the Court of Appeal endorsed the sufficient <b>interest</b> <b>test</b> for mandatory orders. In that case, the Law Society of Singapore had applied for a mandamus (now known as a mandatory order) to ensure that the Disciplinary Committee heard and investigated all six charges levied against an advocate and solicitor. The Court, applying the decision of the House of Lords in R. v. Inland Revenue Commissioners, ex parte National Federation of Self-Employed and Small Businesses Ltd. (1981), held that the test for standing was whether the applicant had a sufficient interest in the subject matter, and not whether he or she had a specific legal right.|$|E
5|$|The Chief Justice of Singapore, Chan Sek Keong, {{suggested}} extrajudicially {{during a}} 2010 lecture that Singapore courts may not apply the sufficient <b>interest</b> <b>test</b> {{with the same}} rigour as the UK courts. A more stringent application of the sufficient <b>interest</b> <b>test</b> would be {{in line with the}} green-light approach that the courts adopt in administrative law. Under this approach, the Government commits itself to good administrative practices while the courts play a supporting role by articulating clear rules for the executive to adhere to. Accordingly, the courts may adopt a more discriminating standing test to discourage litigation that will unnecessarily curtail the executive's ability to carry out good governance.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} the {{lawfulness}} of a proposal to provide elective ventilation to incompetent patients who are potential organ donors. Under the current legal framework, this depends on whether the best <b>interests</b> <b>test</b> could be satisfied. It might be argued that, because the Mental Capacity Act 2005 (UK) (and the common law) {{makes it clear that}} the best <b>interests</b> <b>test</b> is not confined to the patient's clinical interests, but extends to include the individual's own values, wishes and beliefs, the proposal will be in the patient's best interests. We reject this claim. We argue that, as things currently stand, the proposal could not lawfully be justified as a blanket proposition by reference to the best <b>interests</b> <b>test.</b> Accordingly, a modification of the law would be necessary to render the proposal lawful. We conclude with a suggestion about how that could be achieved...|$|R

2500|$|However, First Amendment {{rights are}} not absolute. The law tolerates burdens {{on the free}} {{exercise}} of religion that serve a compelling governmental interest and are narrowly tailored to meet that interest. [...] "The compelling <b>interest</b> <b>test</b> effectuates the First Amendment's command that religious liberty is an independent liberty, that it occupies a preferred position, and that the Court will not permit encroachment upon this liberty, whether direct or indirect, unless required by clear and compelling governmental interests of the highest order." ...|$|E

40|$|The revised Code for Crown Prosecutors became {{effective}} in June 1994.

It was found that prosecutors generally adopt a common approach, but this is attributable not so much to the clarifications contained in the Code as to the detailed guidance contained in the Explanatory Memorandum for CPS staff and in policy directives geared to specific offences. Prosecutors believe that the revised version of the Code is more easily understood by the police and public, but it would seem that the Code has been less successful in meeting its other avowed objectives of clarifying the evidential and the public <b>interest</b> <b>tests</b> so that these are interpreted consistently.

2500|$|The [...] "compelling interest" [...] {{doctrine}} {{became much}} narrower in 1990, when the Supreme Court held in Employment Division v. Smith that, {{as long as}} a law does not target a particular religious practice, it does not violate the Free Exercise Clause. In 1993, the Supreme Court revisited the Free Exercise Clause in Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye v. City of Hialeah. Hialeah had passed an ordinance banning ritual slaughter, a practice central to the Santería religion, while providing exceptions for some practices such as the kosher slaughter of Judaism. Since the ordinance was not [...] "generally applicable," [...] the Court ruled that it was subject to the compelling <b>interest</b> <b>test,</b> which it failed to meet, and was therefore declared unconstitutional.|$|E
2500|$|The Court also {{rejected}} {{the claim that}} the statute was [...] "necessitated by governmental interests of the highest order". Massachusetts had argued that the statute was necessary for two reasons: first, that the State had a compelling interest in maintaining the role of the individual in the electoral process and that corporate speech would diminish this; and secondly, to protect shareholders of the corporations whose views might differ from those of the corporate management. The majority asserted that neither of these justifications was apparent in the statute. Furthermore, the decision found that there was insufficient evidence that the law was necessary to satisfy the compelling state <b>interest</b> <b>test.</b> As to the latter claim, the Court held that the statute was both underinclusive and overinclusive in regards to shareholders interests.|$|E
2500|$|Justice Sandra Day O'Connor {{disagreed}} with the analytical framework the majority had constructed, preferring to apply the traditional compelling <b>interest</b> <b>test</b> to Oregon's ban on peyote. She agreed with the Court's initial premise that the Free Exercise Clause applied to religiously motivated conduct as well as religious beliefs. She pointed out, however, that even a so-called neutral law of general applicability imposes a burden on a person's exercise of religion if that law prevents a person from engaging in religiously motivated conduct or requires a person to engage in conduct forbidden {{by his or her}} religion. The First Amendment has to reach both laws that expressly target religion as well as generally applicable laws; otherwise, the law would relegate the constitutional protection of the free exercise of religion to [...] "the barest level of minimum scrutiny that the Equal Protection Clause already provides." ...|$|E
40|$|This is a {{response}} to Professor Fennell's paper on the recent influence and impact of the best <b>interests</b> <b>test</b> on the treatment of patients detained under the Mental Health Act 1983 (MHA) for mental disorder. I discuss two points of general ethical significance raised by Professor Fennell. Firstly, I consider his argument on the breadth of the best <b>interests</b> <b>test,</b> incorporating as it does factors considerably wider than those of medical justifications and the risk of harm. Secondly, I discuss his contention that the apparent permeability of the line between the interests of the patient and the interests of society is something to be concerned about in itself. Since the overarching theme of the paper is the proper place of social and cultural values, my reponse considers the implications of Fennell's arguments in the light of Charlotte Brontë's novel ‘Jane Eyre’, which, through the character of Bertha Mason (the infamous ‘mad woman in the attic’) provides a provocative study of the relationship between mental disorder and society...|$|R

2500|$|Justice Harry Blackmun {{agreed with}} Justice O'Connor that the {{compelling}} <b>interest</b> <b>test</b> should apply to Oregon's ban on peyote, but disagreed {{with her that}} the ban {{was supported by a}} compelling interest that was narrowly tailored. Blackmun began by [...] "articulat in precise terms the state interest involved" [...] in the ban. Blackmun focused narrowly on the state's interest in not exempting religious use from its otherwise generally applicable ban on peyote rather than the state's broader interest in [...] "fighting the critical 'war on drugs.'" [...] Blackmun framed the issue as he did because [...] "failure to reduce the competing interests to the same plane of generality tends to distort the weighing process in the state's favor." [...] Blackmun questioned whether Oregon actually enforced its criminal prohibition on peyote against religious users, noting that it had not actually prosecuted Smith or Black. Because Oregon had not prosecuted any religious users of peyote, its [...] "asserted interest thus amounts only to the symbolic preservation of an unfettered prohibition. But a government interest in symbolism, even symbolism for so worthy a cause as the abolition of unlawful drugs, cannot suffice to abrogate the constitutional rights of individuals." ...|$|E
2500|$|The court {{concluded}} {{by addressing}} [...] "the possibility that discrimination in hiring, for example {{on the basis}} of race, might be cloaked as religious practice to escape legal sanction". The court said that their decision [...] "provides no such shield", and that [...] "prohibitions on racial discrimination are precisely tailored to achieve that critical goal." [...] The court also said that the requirement to pay taxes despite any religious objection is different from the contraceptive mandate because [...] "there simply is no less restrictive alternative to the categorical requirement to pay taxes." [...] The court acknowledged the dissent's [...] "worries about forcing the federal courts to apply RFRA to a host of claims made by litigants seeking a religious exemption from generally applicable laws...", noting that this point was [...] "made forcefully by the Court in Smith". The court responded by saying, [...] "Congress, in enacting RFRA, took the position that 'the compelling <b>interest</b> <b>test</b> as set forth in prior Federal court rulings is a workable test for striking sensible balances between religious liberty and competing prior governmental interests'... The wisdom of Congress's judgment on this matter is not our concern. Our responsibility is to enforce RFRA as written, and under the standard that RFRA prescribes, the HHS contraceptive mandate is unlawful." ...|$|E
