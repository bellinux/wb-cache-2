5|$|Today <b>herbs</b> <b>are</b> {{typically}} {{thought of}} as culinary plants, but in the traditional cottage garden they {{were considered to be}} any plant with household uses. Herbs were used for medicine, toiletries, and cleaning products. Scented herbs would be spread on the floor along with rushes to cover odors. Some herbs were used for dyeing fabrics.

5|$|The {{earliest}} {{historical records}} of <b>herbs</b> <b>are</b> found from the Sumerian civilisation, {{where hundreds of}} medicinal plants including opium are listed on clay tablets. The Ebers Papyrus from ancient Egypt describes over 850 plant medicines, while Dioscorides documented over 1000 recipes for medicines using over 600 medicinal plants in De materia medica, forming the basis of pharmacopoeias for some 1500 years. Drug research makes use of ethnobotany to search for pharmacologically active substances in nature, and has in this way discovered hundreds of useful compounds. These include the common drugs aspirin, digoxin, quinine, and opium. The compounds found in plants are of many kinds, but most are in four major biochemical classes, the alkaloids, glycosides, polyphenols, and terpenes.|$|E

Salvinorin A is effectively deac-tivated by the gastrointestinal system, so alternative routes of absorption must be used to maintain its activity. Tradi-tionally the <b>herb</b> <b>is</b> consumed either by chewing the fresh leaves or by drinking the juices of freshly crushed leaves. The effects of the herb when consumed this way depend on absorption of salvinorin A through the oral mucosa before the <b>herb</b> <b>is</b> swallowed...|$|R

25|$|The {{two main}} groups of parsley used as <b>herbs</b> <b>are</b> curly leaf (i.e.) (P. crispum crispum group; syn. P. crispum var. crispum) and Italian, or flat leaf (P. crispum neapolitanum group; syn. P. crispum var. neapolitanum); of these, the neapolitanum group more closely resembles the natural wild species. Flat-leaved parsley is {{preferred}} by some gardeners {{as it is}} easier to cultivate, being more tolerant of both rain and sunshine, and is said to have a stronger flavor, (although this is disputed,) while curly leaf parsley is preferred by others because of its more decorative appearance in garnishing. A third type, sometimes grown in southern Italy, has thick leaf stems resembling celery.|$|E
25|$|The {{ingredients}} to make dried pasta usually include water and semolina flour; egg for colour and richness (in {{some types of}} pasta), and possibly vegetable juice (such as spinach, beet, tomato, carrot), herbs or spices for colour and flavour. After mixing semolina flour with warm water the dough is kneaded mechanically until it becomes firm and dry. If pasta is to be flavoured, eggs, vegetable juices, and <b>herbs</b> <b>are</b> added at this stage. The dough is then passed into the laminator to be flattened into sheets, then compressed by a vacuum mixer-machine to clear out air bubbles and excess water from the dough until the moisture content is reduced to 12%. Next, the dough is processed in a steamer to kill any bacteria it may contain.|$|E

500|$|Cooking {{techniques}} for the leeks vary, as some recipes call {{for them to}} be mixed in raw, while others suggest browning them first in a frying pan. If left raw, they can lend a crunchier texture to the sausage. Both the Hairy Bikers and Canteen opt for cooking the leeks first. A variety of <b>herbs</b> <b>are</b> used, with Canteen using sage as seen in the Perkins recipe, in addition to nutmeg. The Welsh Gas Board recipe simply called for [...] "mixed herbs", while Felicity Cloake in The Guardian suggested the addition of thyme. For the frying, the gas board and chef Sophie Grigson suggested the use of lard, while the Bikers used vegetable oil.
