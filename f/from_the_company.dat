5|$|CMLL {{has been}} forced to declare the {{championship}} vacant four times. Each time, the reigning champion left CMLL without losing a match and the championship to whichever successor CMLL picked. Under normal circumstances, wrestlers give notice, or their contract is not renewed, and the championship transitions to a different wrestler. In the case of Cien Caras, Steel, and Héctor Garza, their departures <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> were so sudden and unexpected that no plans were in place and CMLL had to organize a tournament to determine the next champion. In Máximo Sexy's case he was fired <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> while still the champion, causing the championship to be vacated as a result.|$|E
