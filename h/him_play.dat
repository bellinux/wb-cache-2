After hearing <b>him</b> <b>play</b> {{a couple of}} songs on the guitar, Bay-Schuck wanted to sign him immediately, but it took roughly three years for Atlantic records to finally sign Mars to the label, because they felt {{it was too early}} and that he still needed to develop as an artist.|$|E

5|$|As to Captain Benbow, I {{know of no}} {{difference}} between him and me, nor have we had any. He has no small obligation to me, but being called {{in some of the}} foolish printed papers ‘the famous Captain Benbow’, I suppose has put him a little out of himself, and has made <b>him</b> <b>play</b> the fool, as I guess, in some of his letters. I will not farther now particularize this business, but time will show I have not been in the wrong, unless being too kind to an ungrateful man.|$|E

5|$|De Lucía {{was noted}} for his fast and fluent picados (fingerstyle runs). A master of contrast, he often {{juxtaposed}} picados and rasgueados (flamenco strumming) with more sensitive playing and {{was known for}} adding abstract chords and scale tones to his compositions with jazz influences. These innovations saw <b>him</b> <b>play</b> {{a key role in}} the development of traditional flamenco and the evolution of new flamenco and Latin jazz fusion from the 1970s. He received acclaim for his recordings with flamenco singer Camarón de la Isla in the 1970s, recording ten albums which are considered some of the most important and influential in flamenco history.|$|E
5|$|During McCartney's {{early years}} with the Beatles, he {{primarily}} used a Höfner 500/1 bass, though in 1965, he began sporadically using a Rickenbacker 4001S for recording. While typically using Vox amplifiers, by 1967 he had also begun using a Fender Bassman for amplification. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, he used a Wal 5-String, which he said made <b>him</b> <b>play</b> more thick-sounding basslines, {{in contrast to the}} much lighter Höfner, which inspired him to play more sensitively, something he considers fundamental to his playing style. He changed back to the Höfner around 1990 for that reason. He uses Mesa Boogie bass amplifiers while performing live.|$|E
5|$|Kesler's {{success as}} a player has been {{attributed}} to his competitiveness and desire to outwork opposing players. Kesler has recognized, however, that his competitive drive has often caused him to lose his composure. In the 2010 off-season, Canucks management encouraged him to play with more focus, maintaining his emotions and decreasing physical and verbal confrontation with opposing players. During the subsequent 2010–11 campaign, he gained media attention for changing his play accordingly while enjoying the best season of his career. Kesler has also credited the change with his role as a father, wanting to set a mature example for his children when they watch <b>him</b> <b>play.</b>|$|E

5|$|Like many veterans, Graf {{initially}} had a {{hard time}} finding work, but his connections in the football community helped him. Herberger introduced Graf to Roland Endler, an electronics manufacturer ("Elektro-Schweiss-Industrie GmbH") from Neuss. Endler also became president of the FC Bayern Munich football club between 1958 and 1962. Endler employed Graf as a salesman in his company, and Graf eventually advanced to branch leader in Baden-Württemberg and Sales Manager. The link to Bayern Munich allowed him to enjoy his long love of football, although his injuries never let <b>him</b> <b>play</b> competitively again. He did however, return to flying, joining the Zürich branch of the Swiss Aero Club in 1951. Shunned by many veterans, he did remain friends with of a number of his former comrades from the JG52, in particular Alfred Grislawski.|$|E

5|$|Seeking {{to double}} his $7,000 salary from the {{previous}} season, Henderson became embroiled in a contract dispute with the Red Wings prior to the 1966–67 NHL season, before the team acceded to his demands. He then spent the year attempting to overcome injuries; a case of tracheitis forced him to miss several early season games and led the team to consider having <b>him</b> <b>play</b> wearing a surgical mask {{to protect against the}} cold air of the arena. Henderson eventually spent time in the dry air of Arizona to cure the ailment, but he also suffered from torn chest muscles and ultimately missed a third of the season. On the ice, Henderson scored 21 goals and 40 points in 49 games.|$|E

5|$|The series {{begins by}} mostly {{introducing}} the office's workers via a tour given by branch manager Michael Scott {{for both the}} camera crew and a first-day temp (Ryan Howard). The audience learns salesman Jim Halpert has a crush on receptionist Pam Beesly (who helps <b>him</b> <b>play</b> pranks on co-worker Dwight Schrute), {{even though she is}} engaged to Roy (who works in the building's lower-level warehouse). News spreads throughout the office that Dunder Mifflin's corporate headquarters is planning to downsize an entire branch, leading to general anxiety, but Michael chooses to deny or downplay the realities of the situation in order to maintain employee morale.|$|E
5|$|With {{the option}} of joining the major junior ranks in Canada or staying in the United States to play college hockey, Schneider {{prioritized}} getting an education and committed to the Boston College Eagles.

However, when forward Adam Pineault left Boston College {{to play in the}} Quebec Major Junior Hockey League, a scholarship was made available and York decided to keep Schneider on the roster.|$|E
5|$|Burgmeier {{made his}} debut on 23 August, in a 2–1 defeat to Gillingham at The Darlington Arena. He scored his first goal for Darlington in a 2–1 win against Port Vale on 13 September. Manager Dave Penney praised Burgmeier {{for the start}} he made to the club, both as a goal scorer and creator, which also helped him to play {{his way into the}} {{affections}} of the club's supporters. When Burgmeier won his 49thcap for Liechtenstein against Wales, it was his fourth in the two months since he joined Darlington. It took him past the club record three caps of Canadian Jason de Vos and New Zealander Adrian Webster, with a coach-load of Darlington fans there to see <b>him</b> <b>play</b> at the Millennium Stadium. His next cap clashed with Darlington's FA Cup first round replay with Conference North-side Droylsden, in which they were defeated.|$|E
