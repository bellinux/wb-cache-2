500|$|In 2012, Gilmour and Mason {{decided to}} revisit {{recordings}} made with Wright, mainly during the Division Bell sessions, {{to create a}} new Pink Floyd album. They recruited session musicians to help record new parts and [...] "generally harness studio technology". Waters was not involved. Mason described the album as a tribute to Wright: [...] "I think this record is a good way of recognising a lot of what he does and how his playing {{was at the heart of}} the Pink Floyd sound. Listening back to the sessions, it really brought <b>home</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> what a special player he was." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1953-54, when I {{undertook}} a year's teaching assignment at Columbia University, {{the need for}} a book in English, dealing with all aspects of Indo-Muslim history, was forcefully brought <b>home</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> I felt this need particularly with regard to American students who, in the absence of anything better, had to fall back upon Vincent Smith's [...] or similar compilations.|$|E
2500|$|In On a Wing and a Prayer Campese writes that, [...] "I can {{honestly}} say that even six months after that match, some Australian journalists who {{used to call me}} {{at all hours of the}} day and night when it suited them had still not spoken to me. Not that I was heartbroken at that state of affairs, but it brought <b>home</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> the way some of those guys react." ...|$|E

A special election was held to replace him.|$|E

But the support within the Australian Paralympic team was the real game changer for me. The current Australian Paralympic legends opened up their <b>homes</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> gave me much-needed {{equipment}} and helped me understand the significance {{of what it is}} that we do. We look after each other. We are responsible for leaving the sport stronger than when we started. We are not strong despite our disability, we are strong because of it. We are proud men and women with disability, who choose to test our levels of functionality to the extreme." ...|$|R
2500|$|King and {{his family}} moved to {{southern}} Maine because of his mother's failing health. At this time, he began writing a book titled Second Coming, later titled Jerusalem's Lot, before finally changing the title to Salem's Lot (published 1975). In a 1987 issue of The Highway Patrolman magazine, he stated, [...] "The story seems sort of down <b>home</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> I have a special cold spot in my heart for it!" [...] Soon after Carries release in 1974, King's mother died of uterine cancer. His Aunt Emrine had read the novel to her before she died. King has written of his severe drinking problem at this time, stating that he was drunk delivering the eulogy at his mother's funeral.|$|E
2500|$|Readers also {{credited}} Wallace's novel {{with making}} Jesus's story more believable by providing vivid {{descriptions of the}} Holy Land and inserting his own character of Judah into scenes from the gospels. One former alcoholic, George Parrish from Kewanee, Illinois, wrote the author a letter crediting Ben-Hur with causing him to reject alcohol and find religion. Parrish remarked: [...] "It seemed to bring Christ <b>home</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> as nothing else could". Others who were inspired by the novel dedicated themselves to Christian service and became missionaries, some of them helping to translate Ben-Hur into other languages. This kind of religious support helped Ben-Hur {{become one of the}} best-selling novels of its time. It not only reduced lingering American resistance to the novel as a literary form, but later adaptations were instrumental in introducing some Christian audiences to theater and film.|$|E
