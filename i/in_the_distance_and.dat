5|$|The first chorus has Koda {{walking through}} the land, and scenes of her singing. She grabs a compass, {{but it does not}} {{function}} properly. She grabs a drinking bottle, but only filled with little droplets; she tries to drink it, but falls all on her face instead. As she sings the song; {{by the end of the}} second chorus, black projectile smoke is scene falling from the sky <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>distance</b> <b>and</b> hits parts of the abandoned city. As more smoke falls and black leaves con-stellate, Koda collapses and sings the bridge on the ground. When the bridge section ends, rocks start levitating and the smoke rises, forming a black Dust devil in the distance. As more dust devil's form, they become large and closely devour Koda.|$|E
5|$|As {{darkness}} fell, Furieuse disappeared ahead, Mounsey pursuing in {{the hope}} of rediscovering his opponent during the night. At 03:00 on 6 July, the British lookouts spotted the French ship <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>distance</b> <b>and</b> the chase began again, Bonne Citoyenne proving much faster than the French ship as the wind strengthened. At 09:10 it became clear to Kerdaniel that he could not escape his opponent and instead turned to meet her, opening fire five minutes later as Bonne Citoyenne came within range. Mounsey replied immediately, the two ships exchanging fire at close range for nearly seven hours, the smaller and more manoeuvrable Bonne Citoyenne successfully turning several times to vary her broadsides and prevent her guns overheating. In the exchange, the British ship fired 129 broadsides, while Furieuse only managed 70: Bonne Citoyenne lost three cannon to fractures caused by the intense heat generated by repeated firing. With his ammunition spent, Mounsey swung towards Furieuse at 18:16 to board and capture her, at which point Kerdaniel, whose ship was battered and unmanoeuvrable, surrendered.|$|E
5|$|Earlier in {{the morning}} Dupont had {{proceeded}} with his column south and east along the river, from Marbach, according to instructions. Even {{before the arrival of}} Mortier's courier, he heard the sound of artillery <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>distance</b> <b>and</b> sent riders ahead to discover the cause. They came back to report that a Russian column (Dokhturov's) was descending from the mountains to take the road to Dürenstein. Realizing this would separate him from the forward division, Dupont hustled his troops toward the sound of battle and deployed them to take the Russians in the flank. The French assault, heralded by cannon fire, caused Dokhturov's troops to turn their attention from Gazan's beleaguered force to face these new assailants. Although superior in numbers, Dokhturov's column had no supporting artillery, and the narrow space prevented them from taking advantage of their size. It was Dokhturov's turn to face attackers at his front and rear, until the arrival of Schmitt's column, which wended its way through the mountains in the west.|$|E

5|$|In {{an effort}} to move city and county {{government}} functions {{out of the state}} capitol, the city purchased a plot of land to build on in 1832. They chose a spot on the edge of De Witt's public square, along Eagle Street at the eastern terminus of Lion Street (later renamed Washington Avenue); the land was bought from St. Peter's Church for $10,295.95 ($ in modern dollars). The design of the new city hall was done by Albany architect Philip Hooker. The cornerstone was laid by Mayor John Townsend amid a Masonic ceremony, however the date of this event is in dispute. The building was completed in 1832 {{at a cost of about}} $92,000 ($ in modern dollars). The new city hall was a Greek Revival structure, built of white marble with an entrance porch supported by four Doric columns. On the roof was a gilded dome. The interior was simple, with little ornamentation, though a full-length statue of Alexander Hamilton stood in the center of the upper hall, between the Court room and the Common Council Chamber. Upon one side of this hall was a bas-relief of DeWitt Clinton, with a view of a primitive canal-boat <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>distance,</b> <b>and</b> on the opposite wall was a similar figure of Sir Walter Scott. The building was destroyed by fire on February 10, 1880. Plans for a replacement city hall quickly developed.|$|E
5|$|On 13 March 1806, Warren's {{squadron}} was cruising in the Eastern Atlantic. Most of {{the squadron}} were grouped to the northwest, but HMS London under Captain Sir Harry Burrard-Neale and the flagship HMS Foudroyant under Captain John Chambers White were sailing together {{some distance from}} the rest of the British force, in company with the frigate HMS Amazon under Captain William Parker. At 03:00, sails were spotted to the north-east by lookouts on London. Hastening in pursuit with the wind from the south-west, Captain Neale signalled the location of the strange ships to Warren with blue lights, the admiral following with Amazon and the rest of the squadron trailing behind. To the north-east, Linois had also sighted sails <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>distance</b> <b>and</b> turned Marengo south-west in pursuit, anticipating a third encounter with a valuable merchant convoy. Captain Alain-Adélaïde-Marie Bruilhac of Belle Poule insisted that the sails were from British warships, but Linois over-ruled him, arguing that any warships would be part of the convoy's escort and could be avoided in the night. It was not until 05:30, when London appeared from the gloom just ahead of Marengo that Linois realised his mistake. He attempted to escape, but his ships had been at sea for an extended period and were sluggish compared to the 98-gun London, which rapidly came alongside the French ship of the line and opened a heavy fire.|$|E

5|$|The {{far left}} {{flank of the}} German attack fell on the 104th Brigade {{near the village of}} Treux, {{although}} {{due to the fact that}} the line was south of the Ancre in this area, the defenders were less subject to surprise and had good fields of fire. A post of the 18th Battalion of the Lancashire Fusiliers was located in a deep sunken road in the northeast corner of Marrett Wood, which was southwest of Treux itself. On the evening of 27 March, Monash had ordered the 10th Brigade to establish if the 35th Division really held the wood, and patrols of the 37th Battalion had located the British post in the sunken road and provided some support, consisting of a few snipers and a Lewis gun crew which was low on ammunition. About 08:00, Germans were seen approaching <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>distance,</b> <b>and</b> the commander of the Lancashire Fusiliers post asked the 37th Battalion for greater support. Before this could arrive, however, several hundred Germans of II/13 IR attacked, but they were beaten off by the combined British/Australian force at Marrett Wood with the help of the British artillery. The rest of 13 IR attacked further east around the village of Ville, but were easily stopped by the main line of the 106th Brigade. In response to the Lancashire Fusiliers' request for reinforcements, a company of the 38th Battalion occupied Marrett Wood about 11:35, just as another unsuccessful German assault was mounted. A further unsuccessful attempt was made at 16:30. The Germans blamed lack of adequate artillery support for their failure to capture Treux and Marrett Wood.|$|E

[...] Ketèlbey establishes the eastern setting in the opening section, employing the distinctive melodic intervals, A–B–E. The orchestral players are instructed to sing at two points in the score, a descending motif representing beggars crying for baksheesh. Although one contemporary critic belittled the music as [...] "pseudo-orientalism", McCanna comments that [...] "The princess portrayed by the big romantic theme is a cousin of the princesses in Stravinsky's Firebird".|$|E

[...] Those compact squares made good artillery targets and the Russian Guard stood in place from 4pm to 6pm unmoving under its fire resulting in huge casualties. All he could see were masses of troops <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>distance</b> <b>and</b> thus nothing more was attempted.
