When the van breaks down early on, the family learns that they must push the van until <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>moving</b> at about 20mph before it is put into gear, at which point they have to run up to the side door and jump in. Later on, the van's horn starts honking unceasingly by itself.|$|E
5|$|The {{bills of}} bee-eaters are curved, long and {{end in a}} sharp point. The bill can bite strongly, {{particularly}} at the tip, and it {{is used as a}} pair of forceps with which to snatch insects from the air and crush smaller prey. The short legs have weak feet, and when <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>moving</b> on the ground a bee-eater's gait is barely more than a shuffle. The feet have sharp claws used for perching on vertical surfaces and also for nest excavation.|$|E
5|$|The Hipparcos {{satellite}} also {{measured the}} proper motion of Beta Pictoris: it is traveling eastwards {{at a rate}} of 4.65 milliarcseconds per year, and northwards {{at a rate of}} 83.10 milliarcseconds per year. Measurements of the Doppler shift of the star's spectrum reveals <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>moving</b> away from Earth at a rate of 20km/s. Several other stars share the same motion through space as Beta Pictoris and likely formed from the same gas cloud at roughly the same time: these comprise the Beta Pictoris moving group.|$|E

5|$|Delta and Epsilon {{mark the}} fly's left wing and right wing, respectively. With an {{apparent}} magnitude of 3.62, Delta is an orange giant of spectral type K2III located around 91light-years away. Epsilon Muscae {{is a red}} giant of spectral type M5III and semiregular variable that ranges between magnitudes 3.99 and 4.31 over approximately 40days. It has expanded to 130 times the Sun's diameter and 1800 to 2300 its luminosity. It was a star originally 1.5 to 2times as massive as our Sun. Although of a similar distance—around 302 light-years—to {{the stars of the}} Lower Centaurus Crux subgroup, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>moving</b> much faster at around 100km/s and does not share a common origin. To the northwest lies Mu Muscae, an orange giant of spectral type K4III that varies between apparent magnitude is 4.71 and 4.76 and has been classified as a slow irregular variable. Near Mu is Lambda Muscae, the third-brightest star in the constellation and a white main sequence star of spectral type A7V around 128light-years distant from Earth.|$|E
5|$|Unable {{to focus}} on {{research}} problems, Feynman began tackling physics problems, not for utility, but for self-satisfaction. One of these involved analyzing the physics of a twirling, nutating disk as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>moving</b> through the air, inspired by an incident in the cafeteria at Cornell when someone tossed a dinner plate in the air. He read the work of Sir William Rowan Hamilton on quaternions, and attempted unsuccessfully {{to use them to}} formulate a relativistic theory of electrons. His work during this period, which used equations of rotation to express various spinning speeds, ultimately proved important to his Nobel Prize–winning work, yet because he felt burned out and had turned his attention to less immediately practical problems, he was surprised by the offers of professorships from other renowned universities, including the Institute for Advanced Study, the University of California, Los Angeles, and the University of California, Berkeley.|$|E

25|$|Banded tunnelweb spiders {{are often}} found on and under rocks and logs, but are {{predominantly}} found in small holes in tree trunks and rocks {{in which they}} build a silk tunnel.

They are rarely seen outside these holes, and it is rare to see a female roaming about unless <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>moving</b> from one hole to another. Males can be seen roaming around when they are searching for a mate.|$|E
25|$|This {{relationship}} {{means that}} certain key features {{can be observed}} in both drum membrane modes and atomic orbitals. For example, in all of the modes analogous to sorbitals (the top row in the animated illustration below), {{it can be seen that}} the very center of the drum membrane vibrates most strongly, corresponding to the antinode in all sorbitals in an atom. This antinode means the electron is most likely to be at the physical position of the nucleus (which it passes straight through without scattering or striking it), since <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>moving</b> (on average) most rapidly at that point, giving it maximal momentum.|$|E

25|$|More bands {{provide more}} {{discrete}} information, or greater resolution. The characteristic emission and absorption spectra serve to fingerprint or define {{the makeup of}} the feature that was observed. A radiometric plot represents the radiant intensity versus time; there can be plots at multiple bands or wavelengths. For each point along a time-intensity radiometric plot, a spectral plot can be generated {{based on the number of}} spectral bands in the collector, such as the radiant intensity plot of a missile exhaust plume as the missile is in flight. The intensity or brightness of the object is a function of several conditions including its temperature, surface properties or material, and how fast <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>moving.</b> Remember that additional, non-electro-optical sensors, such as ionizing radiation detectors, can correlate with these bands.|$|E
25|$|Understanding {{the motion}} of the canter is {{important}} if a person wants to ride the horse with a balanced, secure, yet flexible seat. To the rider, the horse's back feels as if <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>moving</b> both up and down as well as somewhat back and forth, not unlike {{the motion of}} a swing. When the hind legs engage (which occurs just before beat one), the horse raises its head and neck as its hind leg steps under. As the legs push off the ground (beats 1 and 2) the head and neck of the horse drops. When the leading leg (beat 3) touches the ground, the head and neck are as low as they will be for the stride, and then they begin to come back up as the horse places its weight on its leading leg. During the suspension phase, the head and neck continue back to the highest point as the hind legs come back under the body.|$|E
25|$|A {{suspended}} Slinky's {{centre of}} mass is accelerating downward at 16 feet per second (i.e. g); when released - the lower portion moves up toward the top portion with an equivalent, constant upward acceleration as the tension is relieved. As the spring contracts, every point along its length will accelerate downward with gravity and tension, and experience a decrease in overall downward acceleration related to height along the spring due to the spring force changing with extension- {{at the bottom of}} the spring the upward initial acceleration reduces in accordance with Hooke's law as the spring contracts, but the centre toward which <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>moving</b> gets closer- meaning the base will have been displaced sufficiently toward the centre of inertial mass for it to appear to have hung still. Should this phenomenology extend to very light strings with heavy suspended masses (which have approximately linear tension distributions), different mathematics would be needed to explain the phenomenon.|$|E
