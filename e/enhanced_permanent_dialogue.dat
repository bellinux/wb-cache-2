40|$|Both as to oil and gas, Europe {{will ever}} more {{have to rely}} on {{external}} supplies. By the year 2020, 79 % of its gas consumption and 90 % of its oil consumption will be imported. In addition, this dependence will be characterised by a concentration of supplies among a limited number of producers, a process which, certainly for the EU, requires a <b>permanent</b> <b>dialogue</b> and a close co-operation with its suppliers. On the level of the European Union the debate on main energy issues to be faced in the future, including a secure supply, has been launched by the Commission in its Green paper. - Towards a European Strategy for the Security of Energy Supply. Within this context, the proposal of His Royal Highness Crown Prince Abdullah Bin Abdulaziz to set up a permanent secretariat for the International Energy Forum seems most opportune. Indeed, this initiative aims at strengthening the co-operation and the dialogue between producers and consumers of commodities which are essential for the world economic development. Besides the ministers and official representatives from energy-producing and energy-consuming countries, the Secretariat also wants to involve the major energy companies in those meetings, thus benefiting from their technical expertise, more than is the case now, thanks to the introduction of the said <b>permanent</b> <b>dialogue.</b> SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{central concern}} {{of this article}} is the {{accountability}} of researchers in their desire to combine the publication of oral traditions with respect for the performers of these traditions. It is argued that the concept of copyrights implicitly imposes a written-text perspective and prioritizes national laws by which a group is a collection of individuals. Basing discussion on a representative case study of an epic text recorded in 2007 in Mali, this essay explores an alternative concept of “copy debts”: a cultural framework based on <b>permanent</b> <b>dialogue,</b> in which the performing group determines dynamically the terms and values of ownership/property...|$|R

However, from the author´s point of view, this literature dives into a <b>permanent</b> <b>dialogue</b> with other non-official narratives, being answered, subverted and resignified {{by the same people}} it represents. Throughout the article, several narratives collected during ethnographic fieldwork carried out by the autor together with members of the Pastos community, show that oral history is one of the crucially important non -official narratives for the history and memory of their people...|$|R

Through a concrete example, the very academic career, it is proposed to discussion in the sense that it is not only possible training that pervades the various knowledge areas that address the antiquity, but also that this multidisciplinary approach is beneficial and necessary for a depth understanding of the subject matter. In this way, then it is proposed that Ancient History, Archaeology, Arts, Literature, Philosophy and other scientific areas of humanities are in <b>permanent</b> <b>dialogue</b> and interdependence, and it is important to consider this relationship not only within the research but also in the formation of the researcher...|$|R
40|$|In the {{dissipative}} quantum {{model of}} brain memory recording is modeled as coherent condensation of certain quanta {{in the brain}} ground state. The formation of finite size correlated domains allows the organization of stored information into hierarchical structures according to the different life-times of memories and {{to the size of}} the corresponding domains. The openness of the brain to the external world (dissipation) implies the doubling of the brain system degrees of freedom. The system obtained by doubling, the Double, plays the role of the bath or environment in which the brain is permanently embedded. It is suggested that conscious as well as unconscious activity may find its root in the <b>permanent</b> <b>dialogue</b> of the brain with its Double.

50|$|The {{situation}} changed substantially {{when the}} MPLA abandoned Marxism-Leninism in 1991 and adopted a constitution that provided for multiparty democracy (albeit {{in a highly}} presidentialist version). Restrictions on the liberty of religion were all but abolished, as was the obligation {{to abide by the}} directives issued by the MPLA. However, the government − still dominated by the MPLA, especially after the parliamentary elections of 2008 − maintains a certain monitoring of the religious communities, through the Instituto Nacional das Religiões. This institute, at present headed by a former Catholic priest, holds a register of all religious communities − well over 1000 in 2011 − pronounces selectively an official recognitions which imply a certain measure of recognition and support, and maintains a <b>permanent</b> <b>dialogue</b> with the more important communities.|$|R

40|$|The leading {{countries}} of the world consider food security the important condition of internal political and social-economic stability of the state and its external independence. The topic of the article is crucial {{due to the fact that}} the problem of food security is rather complicated and multilevel and should be considered at different interrelated hierarchical levels. In this context the efficient model of food security is the result of the <b>permanent</b> <b>dialogue</b> between the representatives of the state government, business entities, social organizations and scientific institutions. The article justifies the fact that the model of innovation development, known as ‘the triple helix model’ should be applied at the modern stage of economic development as an efficient tool for the food security provision, which can be implemented in the activity of regional economic entities and the whole economic system of the Russian Federation. ...|$|R

Furthermore, the motor characteristics, deriving from the FEM analysis, are incorporated to an advanced dynamic model, suitable for control purposes. The methodology adopted has been validated by comparing the simulation results to measurements obtained on an appropriate test bench. © 2010 IEEE...|$|R
50|$|Finally, {{there was}} a Consultative Committee (what is now the Economic and Social Committee) which had between 30 and 50 members, equally divided between producers, workers, {{consumers}} and dealers in the coal and steel sector. This grouping provided a chamber of professional associations for civil society and was in <b>permanent</b> <b>dialogue</b> with the High Authority on policy and proposals for legislation. Its Opinions were necessary before such action could take place. The threefold division of its members prevented any one group, whether business, labour or consumers, from dominating proceedings, as majority voting was required. Its existence curtailed the activity of lobbyists acting to influence governments on such policy. The Consultative Committee had an important action in controlling the budget and expenditures, drawn from the first European tax on coal and steel producers. The Community money was spent on re-employment and social housing activities within the sectors concerned.|$|R

This research has led Juliana Gonzalez into some of the philosophical and scientific lines of thinking that have placed our conceptions of reality, life and human nature in crisis. Gonzalez has adopted the view that any historical advancement requires a return to the origins of Philosophy. From her perspective, we need a <b>permanent</b> <b>dialogue</b> with the Greek philosophers, unavoidable sources to use in order to renovate humanism and Ethics. This is especially true of Heraclitus, Socrates and Plato, authors Juliana Gonzalez has worked with in several of her books, mainly Ethics and Freedom (1989) and The Ethos, Destiny of Man (1996) and The Power of Eros: Foundations and Values in Ethics and Bioethics [...] (2000).|$|R
50|$|Diachronic consensus: The {{long term}} vision of {{metropolitan}} planning requires {{not only an}} immediate consensus with the responsible authorities and stakeholders, but also a long-term consensus with future authorities (as far as 20-40 years away). This is called ‘Diachronic consensus.’ As {{it is impossible to}} know in a democratic system who those authorities will be, the way to achieve this consensus is both by having a <b>permanent</b> <b>dialogue</b> with the existing representatives of the political parties which are most likely to form those future governments and to have a system of planning that will allow for adaptation as those successive governments come to place. Flexibility and adaptability, represented in the Variable Geometry and Sliding Horizon mechanisms (below) are a way of proving to future governments that there is no intention of imposing a metropolitan plan upon them and that the plan is prepared for the dialogue of receiving their adaptations and revisions.|$|R

His main investigations deal with culture systems, agrarian landscapes and agrarian land organization in Castile and the Atlantic Spain, particularly Galicia and Asturias. He explained {{the distribution of}} county exploitations, territory efficiency based in ecological potential, agrarian property and landowning. He showed the agriculture-cattle complementarity and the submission to communal shepherding practices. That is to say, he advocated the necessity to survey throughout the history to understand the landscape organization and its transformation possibilities, considering it as a historical totalizer. He was able to unite history and ecology, proposing the histority of natural conditions and resources management: The lack of permanent geographical environment.

40|$|Social {{networks}} have deeply transformed {{the way people}} collect information, communicate and interact. Specifically, social networks enable all internet users to generate, share and comment content online. This phenomenon also influenced the evolution of corporate communication on the web. Indeed, social {{networks have}} high potential for stakeholder engagement, because companies can use such online applications to develop a <b>permanent</b> <b>dialogue</b> with their stakeholders. The selection of content to post on social networks is obviously crucial for the effectiveness of stakeholder engagement.

40|$|Art {{history and}} cannibals, Laurence Bertrand Dorléac. A {{borderline}} discipline by nature, surrounded by better established scientific fields, art history carved {{for itself in}} the past a pure identity, without grasping the strength it could derive from its crossroads position. At {{a time in which}} nobody doubts any longer the importance of the study of works of art for an understanding of the world, its members are more and more divided on the behavior to adopt : a fearful withdrawal of the institution (an already long-tested tactic) or a <b>permanent</b> <b>dialogue</b> with the audiences, mediators and neighboring disciplines which make up many of its actors. Between internalists, advocates of an intransigent isolation and holders of an antiquarian tradition, and externalists, favorable to scientific opening up and debate, there is now a war, intensified by the renewal of the status of culture in France.

40|$|This {{contribution}} aims at advancing {{existing research}} {{about the role}} that the Transatlantic Partnership may play within the specific field of human rights and democracy promotion in the current changing global order. It examines recent changes to the foreign policies of the European Union and the United States on this area and assesses the impact of these changes on the transatlantic partnership over the last five years. The paper argues that these modifications entail a greater convergence between the policies of the two regions, though some ideological divergences, lack of coordination and differences in implementation are still observable. However, the increasing mutual realignment could foster a truly transatlantic partnership in the field if both partners attain to define a joint strategy and establish common institutions to ensure <b>permanent</b> <b>dialogue</b> and policy coherence. At the same time, this enhanced co-operation could enable them to remain the principal supporters of human rights and democracy in the current multi-polar order...|$|R
