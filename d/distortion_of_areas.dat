40|$|In {{order to}} produce a world map on which the continents closely {{resemble}} their appearance on the globe one must make sure that both the shape and the relative size of the individual land masses are well represented. In this paper a method is proposed to quantify the shape distortion and the relative <b>distortion</b> <b>of</b> <b>area</b> on a map projection. A new approach is suggested for producing so-called balanced map projections, which have an equal amount <b>of</b> <b>area</b> and shape <b>distortion.</b> Balanced map projections occupy a different position in distortion space than map projections that are commonly used for world maps. While, according to the calibration method that is applied, balanced map projections have an equal <b>distortion</b> <b>of</b> <b>area</b> and shape, popular map projections like the Winkel-Tripel and the Robinson projection have a shape distortion that {{is much higher than}} the <b>distortion</b> <b>of</b> <b>area...</b>|$|R

A theorem of Sullivan's states that if M is a 3 -manifold and F is a codimension 1 foliation on M which is transversely oriented and possessing the property that through every leaf there passes a transverse closed curve, then each leaf of F is quasi-area minimizing [Ha].

We scanned a phantom {{filled with water}} or with 100, 50, or 5  % v/v concentrations of CM and then virtually produced CM-delayed projection data by partially replacing the projection images. Artifacts {{as a function of}} concentration, percentage of filling time, and size and position <b>of</b> the filling <b>area</b> were assessed. In addition, we used an automatic power injector with different injection delays to inject CM during the scans. A decrease in filling times caused by a lag in CM arrival during the scan resulted in a decrease in pixel values, <b>distortion</b> <b>of</b> the filling <b>area,</b> and appearance <b>of</b> streak artifacts. Even a delay of approximately 20  % in CM arrival in the total scan time resulted in obvious <b>distortion</b> <b>of</b> the filling <b>area.</b> The distortion and streak artifacts tended to worsen at higher CM concentrations. Use of a minimum CM concentration based on the purpose of the examination and constant filling at the target region are effective for avoiding these artifacts. © 2013 Japanese Society of Radiological Technology and Japan Society of Medical Physics...|$|R

40|$|In-vivo flow {{simulation}} in {{coronary arteries}} based on computed tomography datasets: feasibility and initial results Abstract The {{purpose of this}} paper was to non-invasively assess hemo-dynamic parameters such as mass flow, wall shear stress (WSS), and wall pressure with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) in coronary arteries using patient-specific data from com-puted tomography (CT) angiography. Five patients (two without atheroscle-rosis, three with atherosclerosis) underwent retrospectively electrocar-diogram (ECG) gated 16 -detector row CT using ECG-pulsing and geometric models of coronary arteries were reconstructed for CFD analysis. Blood flow was considered laminar, incom-pressible, Newtonian, and pulsatile. The mass flow, WSS, and wall pres-sure were quantified and flow patterns were visualized. The wall pressure continuously decreased towards distal segments and showed pressure drops in stenotic segments. In coronary segments without atherosclerotic wall changes, WSS remained low, even during phases of high flow velocity, whereas in atherosclerotic vessels, the WSS was elevated already at low flow velocities. Stenoses and post-stenotic dilatations led to flow acceleration and rapid deceleration, respectively, in-cluding a <b>distortion</b> <b>of</b> flow. <b>Areas</b> <b>of</b> high WSS and high flow velocities were found adjacent to plaques, with values correlating with the degree of stenosis.

In order to greatly reduce false alarms due to motion estimation errors the proposed detection technique is first to detect blotch candidates based on their spatial features and then to detect blotches from the blotch candidates by their temporal intensity discontinuities.
