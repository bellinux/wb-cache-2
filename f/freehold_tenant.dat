50|$|Freehold land may be enfranchised by a {{conveyance}} of the seignory to the <b>freehold</b> <b>tenant,</b> but it {{does not}} extinguish the tenant's right of common (Baring v. Abingdon, 1892, 2 Ch. 374). By s. 3 (ii.) of the Settled Land Act 1882, the tenant for life of a manor is empowered to sell the seignory of any freehold land within the manor, and by s. 21 (v.) the purchase of the seignory of any part of settled land being freehold land, is an authorized application of capital money arising under the act.|$|E
50|$|The villages were {{replaced}} by the community from 1778 to 1814, and gradually moved to <b>freehold</b> <b>tenants,</b> a process which was only completed in about 1860.|$|R
50|$|Court leets {{generally}} had a jury {{formed from}} the <b>freehold</b> <b>tenants,</b> as bondsmen {{could not give}} an oath (jury means persons having taken an oath). The jury's role {{was similar to that}} of the doomsmen of the Anglo-Saxons and included electing the officers (other than the Steward who was appointed by the lord), bringing matters to the attention of the court and deciding on them.|$|R
50|$|Bere Alston was a burgage borough, {{the right}} to vote resting with the <b>freehold</b> <b>tenants</b> of a number of {{specified}} properties within the town of which there appears to have been only 30. For much of the eighteenth century most, if not all, of these burgage properties were owned by the Drake and Hobart families (the latter becoming the Earls of Buckinghamshire in 1746). Only one contested election therefore occurred in the eighteenth century, when the two families failed to compromise. In the 1770s the borough was acquired by the 1st Duke of Northumberland, and was retained by his descendants until the borough was disenfranchised.|$|R
5000|$|A manor was akin to {{the modern}} firm or {{business}} or other going concern. It was a productive unit, which required physical capital, {{in the form of}} land, buildings, equipment and draught animals such as ploughing oxen and labour in the form of direction, day-to-day management and a workforce. It was further similar in that its ownership could be transferred, with the necessary [...] "licence to alienate" [...] having been obtained from the overlord, as can the ownership of a modern company. The administration was self-contained and the new lord needed only to collect its net revenues to form his return on investment. The direction was ultimately provided by the manorial court, presided over by the lord's personal steward, whose members included the <b>freehold</b> <b>tenants</b> of the manor. The court itself appointed most of the lower manorial officers, which included the following: ...|$|R
5000|$|One {{interesting}} fact, the Lord of the Manor of Burbage did {{until at}} least the Second World War, require the holder (tenant or freeholder) of the Manor Farm (the three acre fields) to have the Parish Church Floor strewn with fresh cut grass on the first Sunday after St Peter's day (29 June) this custom survived from the 12th century up to the out break of the Second World War.The Lord of the Manor can still call a Court Leet, these generally had a jury formed from the <b>freehold</b> <b>tenants</b> or freemen of the Manor. The jury's role {{was similar to that}} of the doomsmen of the Anglo-Saxon period and included electing the officers (other than the Steward who was appointed by the lord), to bring matters to the attention of the court and deciding on them. The Officers of Courts Leet could include some or all of the following: ...|$|R
50|$|The Lordship of Waxham has a rich {{documented}} {{history that}} covers many centuries. Most feudal titles were created after the Norman invasion of England in 1066, but lordships pre-date this. It {{was held by}} St Benet's Abbey and Alan the Earl of Richmond a Breton noble who fought for Stephen of England. The present day holder of the Lordship of Waxham is Stephen David Young, a businessman originally from Buckinghamshire. This is a Feudal Lordship, or honour or dignity, rather than a peerage. The Lord of the Manor can still call a Court Leet, these generally had a jury formed from the <b>freehold</b> <b>tenants</b> or freeman of the Manor. The jury's role {{was similar to that}} of the doomsmen of the Anglo-Saxon period and included electing the officers (other than the steward who was appointed by the Lord), to bring matters to the attention of the court and deciding on them. The officers of the Court Leet could include some or all of the following; Steward, the chief official of the Lord of the Manor, and judge, Manor Bailiff, summoned the jury and, if necessary performed arrests, as well as generally supervising Court matters.|$|R
50|$|William Devereux died in 1314. In Easter of 1315 Lucy, {{widow of}} William Devereux, brought a writ of dower against a {{guardian}} who vouched, {{but this was}} not allowed because he was not <b>tenant</b> of a <b>freehold.</b> The <b>tenant</b> argued that she was not entitled to dower on the grounds that Lucy had been living in adultery. It was determined, though, that Lucy was living in one of William Devereux’s manor houses, and therefore she cannot be said to have left him. The court stated that it was a husband’s business {{to keep an eye on}} his guests, and therefore her dower was upheld. Lucy would continue to be identified on later documents as the widow of William Devereux, former ‘Lord of Lyonshall,’ until her own death.|$|R
