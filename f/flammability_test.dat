40|$|The {{question}} is posed whether forced air flow should {{be incorporated into}} <b>flammability</b> <b>tests</b> as a relevant variable. A test apparatus is described which permits tests to be conducted on small test specimens in a forced flow which is (continuously) variable over flow velocities from zero to 300 feet per minute (1. 52 m/s). The effects of air-flow rate and oxygen concentration on flame propagation rate, maximum smoke density, and pyrolytic product toxicity were measured for a single material and were statistically evaluated.

50|$|Nylon 66, {{especially}} {{glass fibre}} grades can be effectively fire retarded with halogen free products. Phosphorus-based flame retardant systems {{are used in}} these fire-safe polymers and are based on aluminium diethyl phosphinate and synergists. They are designed to meet UL 94 flammability tests as well as Glow Wire Ignition Tests (GWIT), Glow Wire <b>Flammability</b> <b>Test</b> (GWFI) and Comparative Tracking Index (CTI). Main applications are in the electrical and electronics (E&E) industry.|$|E
50|$|A {{compromise}} {{led to the}} US Fire Safe Cigarette Act of 1990, {{which required}} additional NIST research on the interaction of burning cigarettes with soft furnishings, such as upholstered furniture and beds. The resulting study, while contentious, {{laid the groundwork for}} a <b>flammability</b> <b>test</b> method for cigarettes. Federal efforts to implement a standard stalled, as the Reagan and Bush administrations preferred free markets to regulation. The grassroots campaign focused on state efforts. McGuire continued to publish progress reports.|$|E
5000|$|In {{glass fibre}} {{reinforced}} (GF) polyamide 6 (Nylon 6) and 66 (Nylon 66) formulations {{as well as}} in polyesters like polybutylene terephthalate (PBT) and PET, aluminium diethyl phosphinate shows excellent performance in the UL 94 flammability tests [...] (UL 94 V0 specification is met down to 0.4 mm), {{as well as in}} the glow wire tests required for appliances. Here, formulations with aluminium diethyl phosphinate meet the glow wire ignition test (GWIT) [...] at 775 °C and the glow wire <b>flammability</b> <b>test</b> (GWFI) at 960 °C. Another important criterion in E&E applications is the Comparative Tracking Index (CTI), which determines the risk of electrical tracking of insulating material that is exposed to contaminating environments and surface conditions. With formulations containing aluminium diethyl phosphinate, the highest requirement of 600 V (numeric value of the highest voltage at which an electrical insulating material withstands 50 drops of electrolytic test solution) is achieved. Further benefits of polyamides and polyesters containing aluminium diethyl phosphinate are low smoke density which makes them suitable for rolling stock applications to EN 45545, as well as good light stability which is needed for outdoor applications.|$|E
40|$|The {{design of}} the Skylab missions, 1973 to 1974, was {{intended}} to exclude any direct handling of hazardous, toxic, or reactive materials. The materials processing facility and multipurpose furnace provided a contained environment for conducting metals melting, brazing, sphere forming, and crystal growth experiments. At {{the end of the}} third mission, following the completion of all other experiments, the materials processing facility was used for a series of flammability experiments. The <b>flammability</b> <b>tests</b> were done last because of the contamination expected from the burning of the materials within the facility. The <b>flammability</b> <b>tests</b> demonstrated a number of peculiar effects that have implications for future design (fire detection, location, and suppression/control). Although the results of the <b>flammability</b> <b>tests</b> contain lessons appropriate to planning, a number of events during the flight illustrate situations or conditions that pose considerations beyond the commonly accepted range of concern for safety-related matters. This presentation includes a discussion of: Skylab flammability studies and the implications for fire suppression/control; false fire alarms and the Skylab fire detection system; space environmental effects on materials that are normally benign; spills/release of contaminants; the detrimental effect that the release of non-hazardous materials have on detection systems; and the problem of locating sources/originating point of hazards...|$|R

5000|$|Amongst other useful {{effects of}} using {{high levels of}} Natural Oil Polyols to make foams are the {{improvements}} seen in the long-term performance of the foam under humid conditions and also on the flammability of the foams; compared to equivalent foams made without {{the presence of the}} NOP.People perspire; and so foams used for the construction of matrasses or furniture will, over time, tend to feel softer and give less support. The perspiration gradually softens the foam. Foams made with high levels of NOPs are much less prone to this problem, so that the useful lifetime of the upholstered product can be extended.The use of high levels of NOP also make it possible to manufacture foams with flame retardants which are permanent, and therefore are not later emitted into the household or work place environment. These relatively recently developed materials can be added at very low levels to NOP foams to pass such well known tests as California Technical Bulletin 117, which is a well-known <b>flammability</b> <b>test</b> for furniture. These permanent flame-retardants are halogen free and key into the foam matrix and are therefore fixed there. An additional effect of using these new, highly efficient, permanent flame retardants, is that the smoke seen during these standard fire tests, may be considerably reduced compared to that produced when testing foams made using non-permanent flame retardant materials, which do not key themselves into the foam structure. More recent work during 2014 with this [...] "Green Chemistry" [...] has shown that foams containing about 50 percent by weight of natural oils can be made which produce far less smoke when involved in fire situations. The ability of these low emission foams to reduce smoke emissions by up to 80% is an interesting property which will aid escape from fire situations and also lessen the risks for first responders i.e. emergency services in general and fire department personnel in particular.|$|E

40|$|To better {{evaluate}} the buoyant {{contributions to the}} convective cooling (or heating) inherent in normal gravity material <b>flammability</b> <b>test</b> methods, we derive a convective heat transfer correlation {{that can be used}} to account for the forced convective stretch effects on the net radiant heat flux for both ignition delay time and burning rate. The equivalent low stretch apparatus (ELSA) uses an inverted cone heater to minimize buoyant effects while at the same time providing a forced stagnation flow on the sample, which ignites and burns as a ceiling fire. Ignition delay and burning rate data is correlated with incident heat flux and convective heat transfer and compared to results from other test methods and fuel geometries using similarity to determine the equivalent stretch rates and thus convective cooling (or heating) rates for those geometries. With this correlation methodology, buoyant effects inherent in normal gravity material <b>flammability</b> <b>test</b> methods can be estimated, to better apply the test results to low stretch environments relevant to spacecraft material selection...|$|E

40|$|Materials {{selection}} for spacecraft {{is based on}} conventional flammability or ignition sensitivity acceptance tests. Current procedures for determining the inter-laboratory repeatability and reproducibility of aerospace materials flammability tests are not considering the dependence of data variability on test conditions and consequently attempts to characterize the precision of these methods were not successful. The inter-laboratory data variability is determined with tests conducted under arbitrary conditions, which consequently may not provide sufficient information to enable adequate determination of a method's precision. For evaluating the precision of NASA's <b>flammability</b> <b>test</b> methods, the protocol recommended includes selecting critical parameters and determining the 50 % failure point by considering the specific failure criteria of each method using the critical parameter as a variable. Upon performing inter-laboratory round robin testing using this approach, the laboratories' performance could be evaluated by comparing the repeatability of the 50 % failure point and/or the repeatability of critical conditions where the probabilities of passing and failing are unity, i. e., the transition zone repeatability. When a sufficient amount of data has been acquired with this method, an adequate estimation of precision of aerospace materials <b>flammability</b> <b>test</b> methods will be possible...|$|E

30|$|Study (Fritz & Hunsberger [1997]) on the <b>flammability</b> <b>testing</b> of {{mattress}} composites {{have shown}} that the quilting also affects burning behavior, such that quilted specimens exhibit slightly higher THR values as compared to non-quilted specimens when tested under the cone calorimeter. One of the probable reasons for this kind of fire performance may be attributed to the fact that flame spread in quilted specimens is much slower. Quilting prevents rapid flame propagation and hence the material burns slowly but completely to give higher THR values.|$|R
30|$|The future {{bench scale}} testing methods {{should be based}} on simple but scientifically sound {{principles}} that may be employed for screening of materials.

Another potential approach is to use data from bench scale tests in mathematical models to predict large scale fire behavior. However, at the present time predictive testing has too many unquantifiable variables, and so it will likely remain a research tool in the near-term future.|$|R
