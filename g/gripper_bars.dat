50|$|The 1385 was {{followed}} by the first automatic xerographic printer, the Copyflo, in 1955. The Copyflo was a large microfilm printer which could produce positive prints on roll paper from any type of microfilm negative. Following the Copyflo, the process was scaled down to produce the 1824 microfilm printer. At about half the size and weight, this still sizable machine printed onto hand-fed, cut-sheet paper which was pulled through the process by one of two <b>gripper</b> <b>bars.</b> A scaled-down version of this gripper feed system was to become the basis for the 813 desktop copier.|$|E
40|$|With {{this study}} {{the design of}} a steel section tube as CFRP {{component}} was realized. The new production process for the section tube has shown that a weight reduction by ca. 40 % can be achieved with almost unchanged bending stiffness. Owing to the design element of purposefully using fibers with high tensile strength in the direction of main loading, fiber composite components are significantly easier to realize. This aspect of reduced mass or higher specific stiffness produces a positive effect in the project realized by us. The mass reduction leads to a higher natural frequency of the longitudinal vibration of the <b>gripper</b> <b>bar.</b> (orig.)

5000|$|From their {{beginnings}} as odd {{performances at}} fairs and circuses, grip feats have recently gained acceptance as a sport {{in their own}} right, with competitions being held with increasing regularity. Events include one-arm deadlift, nail bending, the closing of torsion spring hand <b>grippers,</b> v-bar (vertical <b>bar)</b> lifting, and standardized pinch apparatuses. Other common events may include Rolling Thunder lifts, thickbar deadlifts, and [...] "Blob" [...] lifting.|$|R
