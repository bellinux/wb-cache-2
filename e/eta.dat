5|$|In mid-2006, the {{organisation}} declared a ceasefire, and conversations between Batasuna, <b>ETA</b> and the Basque and Spanish governments started. Peace talks ended in December, when <b>ETA</b> broke the truce {{with a massive}} car bomb at the Madrid-Barajas Airport. <b>ETA</b> officially ended the ceasefire in 2007 and resumed its attacks around Spain. At the same time, dozens of members were arrested by Spanish and French police. Despite that, {{the organisation}} did not lose the capacity of carrying out attacks.|$|E
5|$|On August 19, Alberto Matxain Beraza {{was arrested}} in the French town of Le Corbier in Savoy, next to the French Alps. He was held along with fellow <b>ETA</b> members Aitzol Etxaburu and Andoni Sarasola. They were {{responsible}} for ETA’s logistics operation, and had the job of supplying weapons and explosives to the <b>ETA</b> cells operating in Spanish soil. The arrest led {{to the discovery of}} almost a tone of explosives, hidden by <b>ETA</b> in 12 small caches around France. On October 11, Joanes Larretxea {{was arrested in}} Rivières, Gard along with top <b>ETA</b> member Iurgi Mendinueta Mintegi.|$|E
5|$|The French Basque Country {{had been}} a {{favourite}} haven of <b>ETA.</b> Since mid-1968 most of ETA's leadership had lived there and {{used it as a}} base for training, infrastructure and planning attacks. <b>ETA</b> commandos also operated from there, crossing the border into Spain to carry out attacks before fleeing back to France. This led to complaints in Spain that French authorities were not doing enough to tackle <b>ETA</b> activity, preferring to leave the Basque conflict to the Spanish to deal with.|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} class of timed automata called {{eventual}} timed automata (<b>ETA's)</b> obtained using guards based on the operator lozenge. In this paper we show that <b>ETA's</b> form a decidable class of timed automata via a flattening to non-recursive <b>ETA's</b> followed by a reduction to 1 -clock alternating timed automata. We also study the expressiveness of {{the class of}} <b>ETA's</b> and show that they compare favourably with other classes in the literature. Finally we show that class obtained using the dual operator lozenge is also decidable, though the two operators together lead to an undecidable class of languages...|$|R

Although the order of divergence of root E[(epsilon- 2) (0) ds v(epsilon) (h) (<b>eta(s))</b> ](2) is known to be epsilon(- 3 / 2) if epsilon down arrow 0 the corresponding limit theorem was so far not explored. We now show that epsilon(3 / 2) integral(t epsilon) (0) (- 2) ds V-epsilon(H) (<b>eta(s))</b> converges in law to a non-Gaussian singular functional of an infinite-dimensional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. Despite the singularity of the limiting functional we find enough structure to conclude that it is continuous but not a martingale in t. We remark that in symmetric exclusion in dimensions d >= 3 the corresponding functional central limit theorem is known to produce Gaussian martingales in t. The case d = 2 remains open.

5|$|The {{attack was}} the first time <b>ETA</b> had killed in Majorca, one of the Spanish regions less {{targeted}} by <b>ETA.</b> On August 18, 1977, a bomb was deactivated next to a seafront walk. On July 31, 1991, two people were injured after two bombs went off in Palma. Two months later, a car bomb was defused in Palma's main beach. In the summer of 1995, Spanish authorities dismantled a cell of <b>ETA</b> ready to shoot king Juan Carlos I. In 2005, the organisation attempted the magnicide once more in Majorca.|$|E
5|$|Agustin Irazustabarrena (Legra) {{belonged to}} the Sega cell of <b>ETA</b> military, {{according}} to Spanish police. He fled to France in 1982 and in 1984 he had been arrested by French police charged with possession of illegal weapons. His trial had still been pending {{at the time of}} his death. He was believed to be in charge of cross-border operations for <b>ETA.</b>|$|E
5|$|As one of {{the larger}} towns in the French Basque Country, Bayonne had been {{one of the}} main bases of <b>ETA</b> {{organisation}} there. From 1975 onwards this had prompted a reaction from anti-ETA groups. In April 1975, Mugalde, a Basque bookshop in the town, was bombed, though no one was injured. On 25 June 1979, Enrique Gómez Álvarez, an alleged <b>ETA</b> member, was killed by the Batallón Vasco Español (BVE), a right-wing paramilitary group active since 1975.|$|E

5|$|On August 9, {{the same}} day <b>ETA</b> claimed {{responsibility}} for the July 30 attack, four bombs exploded in three restaurants and one shopping centre around Palma. The bombs, which contained small amounts of explosives and caused little damage and no injuries, went off after three warning calls from <b>ETA.</b> At 11:16 am local time, a man speaking on behalf of <b>ETA</b> called the firefighters of Calvià, warning that three bombs would go off in Palma. Half an hour later, another person also speaking on behalf of <b>ETA</b> called a taxi company in Gipuzkoa, giving details of the location and time the bombs would explode. Finally, another warning call was mistakenly made to the personal mobile phone of an inhabitant of Córdoba. Authorities reported that the bombers had given contradicting details in each call, leading to confusion on the location of the bombs.|$|E

5|$|Several unusual supernovae and impostors {{have been}} {{compared}} to <b>Eta</b> Carinae as examples of its possible fate. One of the most compelling is SN 2009ip, a blue supergiant which underwent a supernova impostor event in 2009 with similarities to <b>Eta</b> Carinae's Great Eruption, then an even brighter outburst in 2012 {{which is likely to}} have been a true supernova. SN 2006jc, some 77 million light years away in UGC 4904, in the constellation Lynx, also underwent a supernova impostor brightening in 2004, followed by a magnitude 13.8 type Ib supernova, first seen on 9 October 2006. <b>Eta</b> Carinae has also {{been compared to}} other possible supernova impostors such as SN 1961V, and to superluminous supernovae such as SN 2006gy.|$|E
5|$|The BVE {{vanished}} after 1981 but, from 1983 onwards, the GAL began {{carrying out}} similar attacks and abductions. The first in Bayonne occurred on 17 October 1983, when alleged <b>ETA</b> members Joxe Lasa Arostegi and José Ignacio Zabala disappeared. Their mutilated {{bodies were found}} in Alicante in 1985. An unsuccessful kidnapping attempt occurred the following day and, in December, Ramón Oñaederra, an alleged <b>ETA</b> member and Mikel Goikoetxea, an alleged <b>ETA</b> leader, were assassinated by the GAL in separate incidents. Prior to the Monbar attack, two people had been killed and six injured in three separate attacks in the town in 1985.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Eta</b> Carinae {{star system}} is {{currently}} {{one of the}} most massive that can be studied in great detail. Until recently <b>Eta</b> Carinae was thought to be the most massive single star, but the system's binary nature was proposed by the Brazilian astronomer Augusto Damineli in 1996 and confirmed in 2005. Both component stars are largely obscured by circumstellar material ejected from <b>Eta</b> Carinae A and basic properties such as their temperatures and luminosities can only be inferred. Rapid changes to the stellar wind in the 21st century suggest that the star itself may be revealed as dust from the great eruption finally clears.|$|E
5|$|The {{targets of}} the attack were four members of <b>ETA.</b> According to the Spanish authorities, they {{had a long history}} within the organisation.|$|E
5|$|A Great Eruption event {{similar to}} <b>Eta</b> Carinae A's {{has only been}} {{observed}} in one other star in the Milky Way—P Cygni—and {{in a handful of}} other possible LBVs in external galaxies. None of them seem to be quite as violent as <b>Eta</b> Carinae's. It is unclear if this is something that only a very few of the most massive LBVs undergo, something that is caused by a close companion star, or a very brief but common phase for massive stars. Some similar events in external galaxies have been mistaken for supernovae and have been called supernova impostors, although this grouping may also include other types of non-terminal transients that approach the brightness of a supernova.|$|E

5|$|A typical core {{collapse}} supernova at {{the distance}} of <b>Eta</b> Carinae would peak at an apparent magnitude around −4, similar to Venus. A SLSN could be five magnitudes brighter, potentially the brightest supernova in recorded history (currently SN 1006). At 7,500 light-years from the star {{it is unlikely to}} directly affect terrestrial lifeforms, as they will be protected from gamma rays by the atmosphere and from some other cosmic rays by the magnetosphere. The main damage would be restricted to the upper atmosphere, the ozone layer, spacecraft, including satellites, and any astronauts in space. At least one paper has projected that complete loss of the Earth's ozone layer is a plausible consequence of a supernova, which would result in a significant increase in UV radiation reaching Earth's surface from the Sun. This would require a typical supernova to be closer than 50 light-years from Earth, and even a potential hypernova would need to be closer than <b>Eta</b> Carinae. Another analysis of the possible impact discusses more subtle effects from the unusual illumination, such as possible melatonin suppression with resulting insomnia and increased risk of cancer and depression. It concludes that a supernova of this magnitude would have to be much closer than <b>Eta</b> Carinae to have any type of major impact on Earth.|$|E
5|$|A unique {{feature of}} the Homunculus {{is the ability to}} measure the {{spectrum}} of the central object at different latitudes by the reflected spectrum from different portions of the lobes. These clearly show a polar wind where the stellar wind is faster and stronger at high latitudes thought to be due to rapid rotation causing gravity brightening towards the poles. In contrast the spectrum shows a higher excitation temperature closer to the equatorial plane. By implication the outer envelope of <b>Eta</b> Carinae A is not strongly convective as that would prevent the gravity darkening. The current axis of rotation of the star does not appear to exactly match the alignment of the Homunculus. This may be due to interaction with <b>Eta</b> Carinae B which also modifies the observed stellar winds.|$|E
5|$|Authorities rapidly {{ruled out}} the {{possibility}} that <b>ETA</b> had a cell in the island, with police believing the attack had been carried out by a unit that had travelled to the island specifically to carry it out. Initial reports stated that the bombers had set the bomb off with a remote control. Once the second bomb was spotted, police announced that it had a timer device, which could have allowed the members of <b>ETA</b> to plant the bomb several days before the attack and leave the island. Earlier, Government delegate for Majorca, Ramon Socías, had said that security forces believed that the bombers had not left Majorca, and were hiding on the island, waiting for the situation to cool down before attempting to leave.|$|E

30|$|Here, we {{developed}} three novel artificial transcriptional activators as enhanced transcriptional activators (ETAs)—XYR 1 VP, ACE 2 VP, and ACE 1 VP—in T. reesei RUT C 30 via a universal and simple pattern strategy. These <b>ETAs</b> were constructed by fusing the strong transcriptional activation domain of VP 16 to the C terminus of natural TFs (XYR 1, ACE 2, and ACE 1) and transfected into hypercellulolytic strain T. reesei RUT C 30 {{to replace the}} natural TFs (XYR 1, ACE 2, and ACE 1, respectively) by homologous double exchange. Next, {{the effects of these}} <b>ETAs</b> on cellulase production were investigated. These <b>ETAs</b> were shown to improve cellulase production in T. reesei. Our study offers a novel strategy for obtaining high-yield cellulase T. reesei strains as well as provides insight into the regulatory mechanisms of action of TFs for cellulase production.|$|R
