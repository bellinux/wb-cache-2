40|$|The {{presented}} study {{investigates the}} <b>floating</b> <b>aquatic</b> weeds spread on Nile River through Cairo governerate. Cairo city suffers from severe infestation of <b>floating</b> <b>aquatic</b> weeds water hyacinth on Nile River. The existence of <b>floating</b> <b>aquatic</b> weeds leads to bad influence on Nile scenery, which affect on image of civilization through Nile river. To {{overcome this problem}} investigation and designing process were carried out for constructing specific cylindrical barriers supplied with trash rack in El-Marazik territory south Cairo Governerate and El-Malatia territory south Bane-Sweif governerate respectively. The proposed cylindrical barriers and trash racks will control the <b>floating</b> <b>aquatic</b> weeds and prevent water hyacinth from reaching Cairo governerate. To fulfill {{the objectives of the}} study, several field measurements were carried out allover the two studied reaches. The intensity, the percentage of infestation, and the moving trend of the <b>floating</b> <b>aquatic</b> weeds were identified in the two studied areas. The detailed designing criterion of the created weed control barriers was developed to establish such aquatic weeds control utilities. Using the collected data which based on the analysis of field studies, certain applicable solutions were suggested to prevent <b>floating</b> <b>aquatic</b> weeds from reaching Cairo governerate which consequently led to control water hyacinth and improve Nile scenery in Cairo City...|$|R

40|$|The study {{consists}} of a taxonomic treatment of the Araceae of Ceará, a state lying within Brazil's semi-arid region. The aroid flora shows greater similarity to those of central Brazil and Amazonia than to the Atlantic forest. Most species occur in humid forest fragments - the "florestas serranas". Geophytes are also found in caatinga and dry forest (Taccarum ulei) and lithophytes on rock outcrops in dry forest (Philodendron acutatum). <b>Floating</b> <b>aquatics</b> occur in ponds and lakes throughout the state (Pistia stratiotes, Lemna aequinoctialis, Lemna minuta, Spirodela intermedia, Wolffia columbiana, Wolffiella welwitschii), and freshwater helophytes (Montrichardia linifera) along river margins. 28 taxa (species and varieties) in 19 genera are described and most are illustrated:Anthurium (three spp.), Caladium (one sp.), Dieffenbachia (one sp.), Dracontium (one sp.), Lemna (two spp.), Monstera (two spp., one with two varieties), Montrichardia (one sp.), Philodendron (four spp.), Pistia (one sp.), Scaphispatha (one sp.), Spathicarpa (one sp.), Spathiphyllum (one sp.), Spirodela (one sp.), Syngonium (one sp.), Taccarum (one sp.), Wolffia (one sp.), Wolffiella (one sp.), Xanthosoma (two spp.), Zomicarpa (one sp.).

40|$|Reintroduced river otters (Lontra canadensis) are an {{important}} component of Ohio’s biological diversity, and are a key indicator of wetland and watershed health and quality. However, few data are available on their home range sizes and habitat use. We monitored river otters using radio-telemetry in the Killbuck Watershed, in northeastern Ohio, during 2002 and 2003 to determine home range and habitat use. Overall, mean home range size was 802. 4 ha (range = 84. 5 – 3, 376. 3, SE = 448. 2) for female river otters and 1, 101. 7 ha (range = 713. 8 – 1, 502. 6, SE = 102. 2) for male river otters. Home range size of female and male river otters did not differ in 2002 (P = 0. 763), but males had larger home range size than females during 2003 (P = 0. 001). Based on compositional analysis, habitat use differed in proportion to availability of the 5 habitat types available in the study area (marsh, wet meadow, riparian/floodplain, open water, and flooded upland) (P < 0. 0001). Overall, river otters used marsh habitat with a diverse association of <b>floating</b> <b>aquatics</b> and emergent vegetation in greater proportion than was available. Knowledge and understanding of river otter habitat use and home range size in Ohio will help managers identify habitats suitable for river otters in the Midwestern United States...|$|E

40|$|Some common <b>floating</b> <b>aquatic</b> macrophytes could remove nutrients, such as nitrogen, from {{eutrophic}} water.

The results show that AOB were the predominant ammonia-oxidizer on the three rhizoplanes. The principal AOB were Nitrosomonas europaea and Nitrosomonas ureae clades. The principal group of AOA was most similar to the clone from activated sludge. The ratio of AOB amoA gene copies to AOA varied from 1. 36 (on E. crassipes) to 41. 90 (on P. stratiotes). Diversity of AOA was much lower than that of AOB in most samples, with the exception of P stratiotes. (C) 2010 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.
