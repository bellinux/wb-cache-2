5|$|At the 1928 Olympics in Amsterdam, Nurmi {{competed in}} three events. He won the 10,000 m by staying right behind Ritola until sprinting past {{him on the}} <b>home</b> <b>straight.</b> Before the 5000 m final, Nurmi injured himself in his {{qualifying}} heat for the 3000 m steeplechase. He fell on his back at the water jump, spraining his hip and foot. Lucien Duquesne stopped to help him up, and Nurmi thanked the Frenchman by pacing him past the field and offered him the heat win, which Duquesne gracefully refused. In the 5000 m, Nurmi tried to repeat his move on Ritola but had to watch his teammate pull away instead. Nurmi, looking more exhausted than ever before, only barely managed to keep Wide behind and take silver. Nurmi had little time to rest or nurse his injuries as the 3000 m steeplechase started the next day. Struggling with the hurdles, Nurmi let Finland's steeplechase specialist Toivo Loukola escape into the distance. On the final lap, he sprinted clear of the others and finished nine seconds behind the world-record setting Loukola; Nurmi's time also bettered the previous record. Although Ritola did not finish, Ove Andersen completed a Finnish sweep of the medals.|$|E
5|$|Nurmi's {{trip to the}} 1924 Summer Olympics was {{endangered}} by a knee injury {{in the spring of}} 1924, but he recovered and resumed training twice a day. On 19 June, Nurmi tried out the 1924 Olympic schedule at the Eläintarha Stadium in Helsinki by running the 1500 m and the 5000 m inside an hour, setting new world records for both distances. In the 1500 m final at the Olympics in Paris, Nurmi ran the first 800 m almost three seconds faster. His only challenger, Ray Watson of the United States, gave up before the last lap and Nurmi was able to slow down and coast to victory ahead of Willy Schärer, H. B. Stallard and Douglas Lowe, still breaking the Olympic record by three seconds. The 5000 m final started in less than two hours, and Nurmi faced a tough challenge from countryman Ville Ritola, who had already won the 3000 m steeplechase and the 10,000 m. Ritola and Edvin Wide figured that Nurmi must be tired and tried to burn him off by running at world-record pace. Realizing that he was now racing the two men and not the clock, Nurmi tossed his stopwatch onto the grass. The Finns later passed the Swede as his pace faded and continued their duel. On the <b>home</b> <b>straight,</b> Ritola sprinted from the outside but Nurmi increased his pace to keep his rival a metre behind.|$|E
25|$|After a brief let-up, Sunline {{came back}} in {{distance}} and easily defeated other mares in the Auckland Breeders' Stakes (1,400 metres), in New Zealand, {{in preparation for the}} International Cup (2,000 metres) in Hong Kong. Sunline led, and her jockey, Greg Childs, explained that she travelled well to the home turn, but, in an echo of the autumn's Queen Elizabeth Stakes, tired badly in the <b>home</b> <b>straight</b> and finished seventh. She then returned home to New Zealand for a spell.|$|E

50|$|In the 1976 Olympics, he {{probably}} {{made a mistake}} by taking the lead at 500 metres and by not accelerating enough before the winner, John Walker, passed him at 1,200 metres. Thus he lost valuable energy which he would have needed in the <b>home</b> <b>straight's</b> struggle against Walker, Belgium's Ivo van Damme and West Germany's Paul-Heinz Wellman. In the 1980 Olympics 5,000 metres {{he probably}} made a mistake by sprinting to the lead {{at the start of}} the last back straight.|$|R

25|$|Only 20 {{days before}} the Olympic final, 2000 Olympic bronze {{medalist}} Bernard Lagat ran the fastest 1500 m in 2004 (3:27.40), narrowly defeating El Guerrouj (3:27.64) at the Weltklasse Zürich meet on August 6. On August 24, in the final straight of the Olympic 1500m final, El Guerrouj narrowly beat Lagat by 0.12 seconds, winning the gold medal. In a thrilling finale, entering the <b>home</b> <b>straight</b> El Guerrouj led, only to be overtaken by Lagat- and then El Guerrouj re-took the lead only a few strides from the line.|$|E
25|$|Poole Stadium (also {{known as}} Wimborne Road Stadium), {{has been the}} Pirates home track since the club was created in 1948. It is {{situated}} near to the town centre and is owned by Poole Borough Council. The stadium's capacity was limited to 5,500 people in 2008 for safety reasons. Prior to 1948, the stadium had {{been used as a}} cycle track and had been home to Poole Town Football Club since 1933. There is an all seater grandstand on the <b>home</b> <b>straight,</b> and a glass fronted grandstand on the back straight. The viewing areas on the track bends are un-sheltered and standing only.|$|E
25|$|In Dubai, Sunline {{showed her}} {{customary}} pace {{to lead the}} field in the Duty Free (1,800 metres), but her breakaway tactics were not aided by a <b>home</b> <b>straight</b> of 600 metres. Jim And Tonic (a French globetrotter) and Fairy King Prawn loomed up to Sunline with 200 metres to run, and, after a tough run, she did well to hold on for third. Sunline returned to Australia to contest the All Aged Stakes against a sub-standard field, on a wet track at Randwick. Starting a hot favourite, Sunline was inexplicably - although narrowly - beaten by El Mirada and Final Fantasy, and immediately spelled.|$|E

25|$|In the 2013/2014 National Hunt season Faugheen was campaigned in novice hurdle races. He {{made his}} jumping debut on 17 November, ridden by Ruby Walsh, {{he started the}} 1/5 short {{favourite}} for a race over two miles and six furlongs at Punchestown. After keeping tabs on the leaders throughout the race Faugheen {{was still on the}} bridle as he coasted clear in the <b>home</b> <b>straight.</b> The only danger appeared to be at the last obstacle at which he took an untidy jump but was still well on top off the out of depth adversaries without Walsh asking for any serious effort out of his mount.|$|E
25|$|Just {{two days}} later, 20 September, Board {{lined up for}} Great Britain in the 4 × 400 m relay. Running the last leg, she came from ten metres down {{entering}} the <b>home</b> <b>straight</b> to beat her old rival Besson, who was anchoring the French squad, in a dramatic photo finish, not only winning gold for Britain but also helping to set a new world record of 3:30.8. Having claimed two gold medals, {{it was no surprise}} that she was named as 'Best Woman Athlete in the Games'. The relay team, featuring Board, Rosemary Stirling, Pat Lowe and Janet Simpson, was the first British team to win that title at the competition.|$|E
25|$|Faugheen's final {{appearance}} of the season was on 29 April and started the 1/2 favourite when dropped down in distance for the Grade 1 Herald Champion Novice Hurdle over two miles at the Punchestown Festival. Unlike Cheltenham, this time around {{he had to make}} his own fractions and set a decent gallop upfront. Just before the home turn Ruby Walsh asked him to extend the lead and the response was instant, pulling clear of the pack in the <b>home</b> <b>straight.</b> Walsh was back on the bridle after jumping the last and started to pat him in the last 100 yards still finishing twelve lengths in front of his stablemate Valseur Lido.|$|E

25|$|After that {{excellent}} build-up, {{she went}} into the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City as favourite to win the 400 m gold medal. After finishing a comfortable second in her 400 m heat (53.00), she won her semi-final in a personal best 52.56. In the final itself on 16 October, she only took the lead about 100 m from the finish and maintained her advantage well down the <b>home</b> <b>straight.</b> She looked certain to win but was caught just before the line by Colette Besson of France and beaten into second place by a mere 0.09 seconds. Setting a new UK record of 52.12 had not quite been enough to win gold. Nevertheless, it was an excellent effort by a 19-year-old competing in her first Olympics.|$|E
25|$|The pipe {{band of the}} 51st Highland Brigade played {{outside the}} stadium for the hour before he ran. The 400 metres had been {{considered}} a middle-distance event in which runners raced round the first bend and coasted through the back leg. Inspired by the Biblical message, and deprived of {{a view of the}} other runners because he drew the outside lane, Liddell raced the whole of the first 200 metres to be well clear of the favoured Americans. With little option but to then treat the race as a complete sprint, he continued to race round the final bend. He was challenged {{all the way down the}} <b>home</b> <b>straight</b> but held on to take the win. He broke the Olympic and world records with a time of 47.6 seconds. It was controversially ratified as a world record, despite it being 0.2 seconds slower than the record for the greater distance of 440 yards.|$|E
25|$|Räikkönen {{was born}} in Espoo. He had {{a long line of}} success in karting from the age of 10. His first race outside Finland was in Monaco when he was 15 years old. During the race, the {{steering}} wheel broke, but he continued, informing his mechanic by frantically waving the steering wheel in the air on the <b>home</b> <b>straight.</b> Räikkönen's next Monaco race was also memorable; he was thrown {{on the wrong side of}} the safety fence in a first lap collision but continued driving until running out of road. Undeterred, he lifted his kart back onto the track and continued to race. His mechanic thought Räikkönen had retired, but he eventually caught up with the other competitors and finished third. In 1998 he was 1st in the Nordic Championship at Varna in Norway. In 1999, Räikkönen placed second in the European Formula Super A championship for the Dutch PDB Racing Team– run by 1980 world champion Peter de Bruijn– utilising a Gillard chassis. He also competed in the Formula Ford Euro Cup. By the age of twenty, he had won the British Formula Renault winter series of 1999, winning the first four races of the year. In 2000, he won seven out of ten events in the Formula Renault UK Championship. Combined, over these two series of Formula Renault, he won 13 out of 23 events– a 56% win rate.|$|E

500|$|F-Zero is {{a futuristic}} racing game where players {{compete in a}} {{high-speed}} racing tournament called [...] "F-Zero". There are four F-Zero characters that have their own selectable hovercar along with its unique performance abilities. The objective {{of the game is}} to beat opponents to the finish line while avoiding hazards such as slip zones and magnets that pull the vehicle off-center {{in an effort to make}} the player damage their vehicle or fall completely off the track. Each machine has a power meter, which serves as a measurement of the machine's durability; it decreases when the machine collides with land mines, the side of the track or another vehicle. Energy can be replenished by driving over pit areas placed along the <b>home</b> <b>straight</b> or nearby.|$|E
500|$|All of Gay's 200m runs {{during the}} season were wind aided, which meant not only would he need to place in the National Championships, {{he would need to}} achieve the [...] "A Standard" [...] of 20.52 seconds. In his semi-final, he did surpass the {{standard}} with a run of 20.07, although it was another wind aided run. During the replay of the race, it was revealed that Gay had stepped on the line of his inside lane, which would normally result in a disqualification, but it was overlooked and Gay safely advanced to the final. During the final, Gay lead all of the way. He powered down the <b>home</b> <b>straight</b> to win in a World Leading time of 19.74 seconds, with a legal tail wind of 1.6 meters per second.|$|E
500|$|In China, Webber's engine failed on the <b>home</b> <b>straight</b> {{during the}} final {{practice}} session leaving him with a ten-place grid penalty. During qualifying on Saturday afternoon, he ended in 6th after Heidfeld was demoted for impeding Webber's teammate Coulthard, and so Webber had to start from 16th after his penalty. Webber was on the grid in 16th and managed to end the first lap up four places in 12th before taking the 11th position off Glock on the second lap. By the first pit stop, Webber had overtaken Rubens Barrichello and Piquet Jr. for 9th place, but inevitably dropped back once he had entered the pits. The two-stop strategy that the team had adopted was not successful and Webber finished in 14th place. The [...] was teammate Coulthard's last race before his retirement from F1. Practice was close with the leading seven cars, including Webber in 7th, being {{less than a second}} apart. In Saturday afternoon qualifying, Webber managed 10th on the grid, and finished the race in 9th position.|$|E

500|$|On 4 June 1913 Davison {{obtained}} two flags {{bearing the}} suffragette colours of violet, white and green from the WSPU offices; she then travelled by train to Epsom, Surrey, {{to attend the}} Derby. She positioned herself at Tattenham Corner, the final bend before the <b>home</b> <b>straight.</b> At {{this point in the}} race, with some of the horses having passed her, she ducked under the guard rail and ran onto the course; she may have held in her hands one of the suffragette flags. She reached up to the reins of Anmer—King George V's horse, ridden by Herbert Jones—and was hit by the animal, which would have been travelling at around [...] per hour, four seconds after stepping onto the course. Anmer fell in the collision and partly rolled over his jockey, who had his foot momentarily caught in the stirrup. [...] Davison was knocked to the ground; some reports say she was kicked in the head by Anmer, but the surgeon who operated on Davison stated that [...] "I could find no trace of her having been kicked by a horse".
