5000|$|In Oregon, <b>field</b> <b>burning</b> {{has been}} widely used by grass seed farmers as a method for {{clearing}} fields for {{the next round of}} planting, as well as revitalizing serotinous grasses that require fire in order to grow seed again. The Oregon Department of Environmental Quality began requiring a permit for farmers to burn their fields in 1981, but the requirements became stricter in 1988 following a multi-car collision in which smoke from <b>field</b> <b>burning</b> near Albany, Oregon, obscured the vision of drivers on Interstate 5, leading to a 23-car collision in which 5 people died and 37 were injured.

Thirty two percent of the respondents indentified burning of thatch grass and trees in general as the major impact of wildland fires. Wildland fires were also blamed for livestock mortality as they may fail to escape the infernos and this was very common especially with young animals (Table  1). The other negative impacts of wildland fires that were highlighted included the destruction of crops in <b>fields,</b> <b>burning</b> of fire wood, injury to forest and destruction of wild fruits and traditional herbs and medicine, and burning of pastures for livestock.|$|R

Pashtun nomads, locally known as Kuchi, enter the area every year in late spring, and allow their animals to graze on crop fields. Local Hazaras claim that Kuchi militias being armed with heavy weapons are supported by the Taliban and elements of the Afghan government. According to some latest reports, several villages have been burned and thousands of local villagers have had to flee the area in May-June 2012. The clashes reportedly resulted in the death of six local villagers on June 8, 2012. Pashtun nomads have also burned copies of Qur'an, the Muslim holy book.

5000|$|Soot as an {{airborne}} contaminant {{in the environment}} has many different sources, {{all of which are}} results of some form of pyrolysis.

These exterior sources also contribute to the indoor environment sources such as smoking of plant matter, cooking, oil lamps, candles, quartz/halogen bulbs with settled dust, fireplaces, exhaust emissions from vehicles, and defective furnaces. Soot in very low concentrations is capable of darkening surfaces or making particle agglomerates, such as those from ventilation systems, appear black.

HC&S cultivates approximately 35,000 acres of sugarcane on Maui, with roughly 400 acres per week being burned from March to November each year to remove dried leaves from the cane before it is harvested and processed. A spokesman for HC&S claimed that [...] "burning, in the field, is the only economical means HC&S has found to-date of removing the dried leafy material from its crop." [...] Maui environmentalists and physicians have countered by asserting that the burning process has caused increased rates of asthma and respiratory disease, especially among children, released carcinogens from burning PVC pipes used in the irrigation system, and resulted in highway closures and car crashes. Community organizers have called on A&B to replace burning with green harvesting methods, and in 2012, presented the Hawaii Department of Health with a petition signed by 8,700 Maui residents, asking it to deny the company a burning permit for the coming year.|$|E

5000|$|Pua District {{is heavily}} agricultural. It is a {{significant}} maize-growing area. Farmer's zeal to clear more land for maize cultivation has led to deforestation of vast tracts of hillsides, resulting in [...] "bald mountains" [...] (เขา้หัวล้าน; [...] ). A by-product of the land clearing is smoke from <b>field</b> <b>burning,</b> contributing to the northern region's significant air pollution. Charoen Pokphand (CP) Group, Thailand's largest agro-industrial and food conglomerate, and the leading purchaser of Pua District maize, in March 2016 announced an [...] "agricultural social enterprise" [...] to steer district villagers away from maize farming. CP Group has incurred criticism for the way it purchases maize harvests for animal feed from farmers in Nan and other provinces. Suphachai Chearavanont, vice-chairman of CP Group, said that corn planters will be encouraged to grow cash crops such as coffee, which requires less farmland and makes a higher profit than maize. Not only will this address the bald-mountain problem, he said, {{but it will also}} help reduce the spring haze in the north which is caused by slash-and-burn practices to prepare land for the next maize season. Mr Suphachai said crops like coffee take about three-and-a-half years to show a yield, but stated that CP Group would stand by farmers and provide assistance in the meantime.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} work focuses on studying the combustion characteristics, specifically the burning rates of nanoenergetic materials composed of nano aluminum and nickel oxide. A fluoroelastomer, FC- 2175 (chemically {{the same as}} Viton™), {{was used as the}} binder. Nano aluminum and nickel oxide were chosen as this system is close to a gasless system, does not require pre-heating and has the potential for studying the effects of doping and magnetic field. Various parameters influence the combustion of these composites. Variation of burning rate with particle-size of the oxidizer, binder content, packing density and pressure were studied. The effect of doping the oxidizer and the presence of magnetic <b>field</b> on the <b>burning</b> rate were also studied. The burning rate was found to increase with decrease in particle-size but for smaller particles, specific surface area seemed to be the dominating factor affecting the burning rate. At larger particle-sizes, the results show that the particle-size is the dominating factor affecting the burning rate. The burning rate was also found to decrease with increase in binder content. Similarly, decreasing the pressure increased the burning rate. With increase in packing density, the results show that for this composite, the burning rate first increases and then decreases. This is likely due to the effect of convective and non-planar burning. To study the effect of doping, the oxidizer was doped with lithium (p-doping) and chromium (n-doping). Experiments depicted that doping may affect the burning rate. However, the variation in burning rate was also influenced by other factors like surface area and particle-size of the oxidizer, which varied in this experiment. The doped and undoped oxidizers had different particle-sizes and surface area and due to this, it is unclear if the trend in burning rate for these composites was due to the effect of doping or particle-size and surface area. As nickel is ferromagnetic, the effect of magnetic <b>field</b> on <b>burning</b> rate was explored. It was found that {{in the presence of a}} magnetic <b>field,</b> the <b>burning</b> rate decreased but a stronger magnetic field would be required to achieve a clear picture and arrive at a definite conclusion. ...|$|R

25|$|The Ashanti {{prepared}} the <b>fields</b> by <b>burning</b> before {{the onset of}} the rainy season and cultivated with an iron hoe.

Manioc and corn are New World transplants introduced during the Atlantic European trade. Many of these vegetable crops could be harvested twice a year and the cassava (manioc), after a two-year growth, provides a starchy root. The Ashanti transformed palm wine, maize and millet into beer, a favorite drink; and made use of the oil from palm for many culinary and domestic uses.|$|R
