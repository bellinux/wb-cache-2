5|$|At the October 13, 1992 Wrestling Challenge taping, Money Inc. faced The Natural <b>Disasters</b> <b>in</b> {{a rematch}} for the WWF Tag Team Championship. The match {{originally}} pitted the Disasters against the Nasty Boys, {{who were also}} managed by Hart, {{but at the last}} minute, Hart replaced them with Money Inc. Because of this, the Nasty Boys split with Hart and attacked Money Inc. before the match. Later on, the Headshrinkers interfered on behalf of Money Inc. and helped DiBiase make Earthquake submit to the Million Dollar Dream, thereby winning Money Inc. the Championship. After the match, the Nasty Boys again attacked Jimmy Hart. At the 1992 Survivor Series on November 25, Money Inc. and the Beverly Brothers faced the Nasty Boys and the Natural <b>Disasters</b> <b>in</b> an 8-man elimination tag team match. During the match, Money Inc. eliminated the Natural Disasters, but Jerry Sags of the Nasty Boys then pinned I.R.S. to win the match.

5|$|Danzig had {{remained}} practically autonomous and adamant about protecting its status and foreign trade monopoly. The Karnkowski Statutes of 1570 gave Polish kings the control over maritime commerce, {{but not even}} Stephen Báthory, who resorted to an armed intervention against the city, was able to enforce them. Other Polish cities held steady and prosperous through {{the first half of}} the 17th century. War <b>disasters</b> <b>in</b> the middle of that century devastated the urban classes.|$|E

5|$|Hailstorms have {{a history}} of {{significant}} damage in Australia.

Hailstorms caused more than 30% of all insured damages inflicted as a result of natural <b>disasters</b> <b>in</b> Australia during this period, and around three quarters of all hailstorm damage has occurred in New South Wales.|$|E
5|$|On Victoria Day, 24 May 1881, the {{stern-wheeler}} ferry SS Victoria capsized in the Thames River {{close to}} Cove Bridge in West London.

At the time, London's population was relativity low, therefore it was hard to find a person in the city who did not have a family member affected by the tragedy.|$|E
5|$|The Mississippi and Alabama coastlines {{suffered}} catastrophic {{damage from}} the storm's 30-foot (9m) storm surge. New Orleans escaped the worst {{damage from the}} storm, but levees along the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway and 17th Street and London Avenue Canals were ultimately breached by storm surge, flooding about 80% of the city. 1,836people were confirmed dead across seven US states. Katrina is the costliest {{and one of the}} deadliest natural <b>disasters</b> <b>in</b> U.S. history, with damage totals around US$81.2billion ($ USD). It is the deadliest storm of the 2005 season.

5|$|The devastation in Dobrudzha at {{the hands}} of the Magyars {{indicated}} how vulnerable Bulgaria was to attacks from the north under the influence of the Byzantine diplomacy. That experience paid off well in 917, when Simeon managed to counter the Byzantine efforts to ally with the Serbs or the Pechenegs, and forced them to fight alone in the battle of Achelous, where the Byzantines were soundly defeated in one of the biggest <b>disasters</b> <b>in</b> Byzantine history.|$|E
5|$|The {{disruption}} on Guam {{was significant}} {{enough that the}} JTWC's backup location at Yokota Air Base in Japan assumed forecasting and warning responsibilities for five days starting on May 20. The cleanup and recovery took months, assisted by military personnel. During the aftermath, food shortages resulted in long lines for aid at Andersen Air Force Base. Due to Pamela {{as well as the}} occurrence of other <b>disasters</b> <b>in</b> 1976, the American Red Cross went into debt, after providing about $10million in assistance to 16,000families.
