When I appear they give the excuse that they saw two Chinese soldiers climb over the wall. When I show them my party badge, they return the same way. In {{one of the houses}} in the narrow street behind my garden wall, a woman was raped, and then wounded in the neck with a bayonet. <b>I</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> an ambulance so we can take her to Kulou Hospital. (...) Last night up to 1,000 women and girls are said to have been raped, about 100 girls at Ginling College Girls alone. You hear nothing but rape. If husbands or brothers intervene, they're shot. What you hear and see on all sides is the brutality and bestiality of the Japanese soldiers." ...|$|E

I increased the throttle to little effect and then started {{to look for a}} safe landing place, but the area was full of high trees and houses. I increased the throttle and was able to hold height {{for a few minutes and}} then noticed the engine water temperature was over 100 degrees Celsius and I could see steam from the left hand engine cowling. The engine lost power again and I saw a chance to land in some allotments, I pushed the control down to 45 degrees and hit the ground at the same angle. I was trapped by my foot and released myself after about two minutes, as I freed myself the engine caught fire. <b>I</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> to the door of the cabin and only one of the passengers was conscious." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cousins won the Brownlow Medal, the AFL's highest {{individual}} player award, on 19 September 2005 with 20 votes, {{ahead of}} teammate Daniel Kerr on 19 votes and Nick Dal Santo on 18 votes. Cousins was the favourite to win with bookmakers, after five previous top-10 finishes. He {{did not attend}} the award ceremony in Melbourne, remaining in Perth to prepare for West Coast's Grand Final match against Sydney Swans the following weekend. His celebration was [...] "very quiet, I went over to the bar, bought the folks a bottle of champagne, had one lemonade and went up to the (hotel) room. <b>I</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> to sleep before midnight, which was a bonus." [...] West Coast's last training session in Perth before travelling to their first Grand Final game since 1994 was attended by 3,000 fans. Trevor Nesbitt, West Coast's chief executive, said he expected that the combination of the team's Grand Final appearance, Cousins' Brownlow win, and Chris Judd's Brownlow win in the previous year, would lead to a turnover of around $2million in club merchandise. Nesbitt added: ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1874: [...] "Another, if possible, {{still more}} {{beautiful}} day, after a slight frost. — After writing started at 11 with Beatrice to try & {{walk up to}} the falls of the Glassalt, which I had not done since 20 years! There was not a breath of wind & a very powerful sun. <b>I</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> up & was wonderfully little out of breath. Brown helped me up the steepest parts, which are rather trying. The falls were not particularly full, but always very fine. I walked up to the very top, just above, them, & rested a little on the heather. The descent was far easier, but the path was very rough in parts & I had recourse to Brown's strong arm to steady me. It is 4 miles to the top & back, & I felt quite proud, that I could accomplish it so well. — In the afternoon drove with Beatrice & Janie E. nearly as far as Birkhall & back, taking our tea at the Linn of Muich. A splendid frosty evening." [...] Likewise in 1877: [...] "Walked with Beatrice {{up to the top of}} the Glassalt falls, where the icicles where hanging ...|$|E
