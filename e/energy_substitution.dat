40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} applied theory of energy cross price partial elasticities of substitution, and {{presents}} it in a transparent fashion. It uses log linear and translog production and cost functions {{due to their}} economic properties and convenient estimating forms, but the theory applies other functional forms. The objective is to encourage increased empirical research that would deepen {{understanding and appreciation of}} <b>energy</b> <b>substitution.</b> The economic outcome of decisions regarding energy policy often hinge on substitution between energy and other factors of production, but there is little consensus regarding the degree and even direction of <b>energy</b> <b>substitution.</b> As classic examples, Berndt and Wood (1975) find aggregate energy a substitute for labor but a complement with capital, while Griffin and Gregory (1976) find energy a substitute for both. Only continued theoretical and empirical investigation will be able to shed light on this issue, and the opaque dispersed literature on the theory of substitution must discourage new research.

30|$|To further {{investigate}} the doping mechanism, we studied the favorability of indium atom to substitute Pb by conducting the pseudo-potential first principle calculations using a single cubic 2 [*]×[*] 2 [*]×[*] 2 supercell with 32 units of PbTe. We first started with 64 -atom Pb 32 Te 32 cell {{to calculate the}} lattice constant of PbTe crystal. The calculated value of the lattice constant {{is found to be}} 6.33 Å which is in close agreement with the reported value for cubic PbTe, 6.454 Å (JCPDS: 78 - 1905). This is followed by calculation of the formation <b>energy</b> for <b>substitution</b> with one indium in the 2 [*]×[*] 2 [*]×[*] 2 supercell (1.5 at% of In) which is slightly higher in indium level compared to our highest doped experimental sample In 0.02 Pb 0.98 Te (1.0 at%). The formation <b>energy</b> of the <b>substitution</b> is defined as Esub[*]=[*]E(Pb 32 Te 32)[*]+[*]E(In)[*]-[*]E(InPb 31 Te 32)[*]-[*]E(Pb). The calculated value of the formation <b>energy</b> of the <b>substitution</b> is 3.21 eV which is larger than the calculated cohesive energy of indium crystal (Ein), 2.52 eV. Since Esub[*]>[*]Ein, we can conclude that indium is highly favorable to substitute Pb into the PbTe for 1.5 at% doping level. This conclusion is consistent with the result we got from the XRD analysis of our In-doped PbTe samples. No indium phase is detected by XRD in our sample. We further calculated the formation <b>energy</b> of <b>substitution</b> for InPb 15 Te 16 (3.12 at% of In) and InPb 7 Te 8 (6.24 at% of In) in order to {{investigate the}} solubility of the indium into PbTe. It is found that formation <b>energy</b> for <b>substitutions</b> reduced to - 0.6 and - 1.17 eV, respectively, for 3.12 and 6.24 at% of indium doping. The reduced value of <b>substitution</b> <b>energy</b> indicates that <b>substitution</b> of Pb with indium becomes less favorable with the increased In doping concentration. The very large negative <b>substitution</b> <b>energy,</b> - 1.17 eV for 6.24 at% of In doping, suggests that it is almost impossible for In to substitute Pb at such high doping level. This corresponds well with the solubility limit of In in PbTe. We have also tested In doping into interstitial sites of the PbTe lattice. At the most likely (0.25, 0.25, 0.25) interstitial site, the insertion energy comes to be 0.068 eV. From these energy calculations, as well as from our X-ray measurement, we can conclude that In doping, at our level of 1.5 at%, allows substitution on the Pb site.|$|R

The size of fossil fuel reserves and the dilemma that "when non-renewable energy will be diminished" is a fundamental and doubtful question {{that needs to be}} answered. This paper presents a new formula for calculating when fossil fuel reserves are likely to be depleted and develops an econometrics model to demonstrate the relationship between fossil fuel reserves and some main variables. The new formula is modified from the Klass model and thus assumes a continuous compound rate and computes fossil fuel reserve depletion times for oil, coal and gas of approximately 35, 107 and 37 years, respectively. This means that coal reserves are available up to 2112, and will be the only fossil fuel remaining after 2042. In the Econometrics model, the main exogenous variables affecting oil, coal and gas reserve trends are their consumption and respective prices between 1980 and 2006. The models for oil and gas reserves unexpectedly show a positive and significant relationship with consumption, while presenting a negative and significant relationship with price. The econometrics model for coal reserves, however, expectedly illustrates a negative and significant relationship with consumption and a positive and significant relationship with price. Consequently, huge reserves of coal and low-level coal prices in comparison to oil and gas make coal one of the main <b>energy</b> <b>substitutions</b> for oil and gas in the future, under the assumption of coal as a clean energy source.

In the operation of fusion reactor, the accumulation and aggregation of helium and hydrogen produced from transmutation reactions would induce bubble formation and void swelling and further result in embrittlement and irradiation-induced hardening of the materials. High solubility and permeability of tritium and solubility of interstitial impurities like O, C, and N {{can also lead to}} embrittlement. In order to further investigate the characters of Nb 2 Ge in irradiation environment, ab initio calculations are performed on the energetics of O, H and He impurities in Nb 2 Ge. The study of all the impurities is carried out in two ways, substitutionally and interstitially. Formation <b>energies</b> due to <b>substitution</b> and interstitial are calculated, lattice parameters and unit cell volume of Nb 2 GeC with substitutional or interstitial impurities are obtained, and its electronic property is analysed by Mulliken population and electron charge density. The formation <b>energies</b> of H <b>substitution</b> are lower than those of O substitution and He substitution, hence H atoms are trapped more easily by some irradiation-induced vacancies. The formation energies of O subtitution indicate the sequence Ef(Osub-Nb) > Ef(Osub-Ge) approximate to Ef(Osub-C), which is related to the strength of bonds. Analysis on electron charge density and Mulliken population shows that C-O bond is stronger than Nb-O and Ge-O bond, and the bond lengths of C-O, Nb-O and Ge-O are 3. 256, 2. 118 and 1. 985 angstrom respectively. Due to the interaction of O atom with Nb, Ge and C atoms in Nb 2 Ge, the O atom would deviate from the vacancy, and goes to the deformed sites in the crystal structure. As for H <b>substitution,</b> the formation <b>energies</b> of <b>substitution</b> show the sequence Ef(Hsub-Nb) > Ef(Hsub-Ge) > Ef(Hsub-C).

The formation <b>energies</b> of He <b>substitution</b> present the sequence: Ef(Hesub-C) > Ef(Hesub-Nb) > Ef(Hesub-Ge), and suggest that the He atom is the easiest to be trapped by C vacancy. All O, H and He interstitials make lattice parameter a increase, c decrease and unit cell V shrink. Besides, the results of substitution and interstitial formation energies show that O, H and He impurities prefer to stay on octahedral sites.
