40|$|The {{design of}} {{turbomachinery}} blades requires {{the prevention of}} flutter for all operating conditions. However, flow field predictions used for aeroelastic analysis are not well understood for all flow regimes. The present research focuses on numerical solutions of the Euler and Navier-Stokes equations using an ADI procedure to model two-dimensional, transonic flow through oscillating cascades. The model prescribes harmonic pitching motions for the blade sections for both zero and non-zero <b>inter-blade</b> phase angles. The code introduces {{the use of a}} deforming grid technique for convenient specification of the periodic boundary conditions. Approximate nonreflecting boundary conditions have been coded for the inlet and exit boundary conditions. Sample unsteady solutions have been performed for an oscillating cascade and compared to experimental data. Also, test cases were fun for a flat plate cascade to compare with an unsteady, small-perturbation, subsonic analysis. The predictions for oscillating cascades with non-zero <b>inter-blade</b> phase angles are in good agreement with experimental data and small-perturbation theory. The zero degree <b>inter-blade</b> phase angle cases, which were near a resonant condition, differ from the experiment and theory. Studies on reflecting versus non-reflecting inlet and exit boundary conditions show that the treatment of the boundary can {{have a significant effect on}} the first harmonic, unsteady pressure distributions for certain flow conditions. This code is expected to be used as a tool for reviewing simpler models that do not include the full nonlinear aerodynamics or as a final check for designs against flutter in turbomachinery...|$|E

The unsteady flow simulations were performed by a 3 D linearized Navier-Stokes flow solver using the Spalart and Allmaras turbulence model. Significant flow blockage due to corner separation at the hub on the suction surface was predicted by the steady-state 3 D viscous simulation at a design condition. Corner separation was not predicted by 3 D inviscid or two-dimensional (2 D) viscous simulations. The corner separation {{was found to have}} a destabilizing effect and changed the nature of the unsteady flow. In fact, the 3 D viscous simulations predicted negative aerodynamic damping for almost half of the <b>inter-blade</b> phase angles, while the 2 D and 3 D inviscid simulations predicted stable positive aerodynamic damping for all <b>inter-blade</b> phase angles.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the computational analysis of aerodynamic damping for prediction of flutter {{characteristics of a}} transonic fan stage that consists of a highly loaded rotor along with a tandem stator. Three dimensional, linearized Navier-Stokes flow solver TRACE is used to numerically analyse the flutter stability of the fan. The linear flow solver enables the modeling of a single blade passage to simulate the desired <b>inter-blade</b> phase angle. The unsteady aerodynamic load on a vibrating blade is obtained by solving the unsteady Navier-Stokes equations on a dynamically deforming grid and the energy exchange method {{is used to calculate}} the aerodynamic damping. The calculation of aerodynamic damping for the prediction of flutter characteristics of the fan rotor is carried out with and without considering the influence of the disk. The blade mode shapes from finite element modal analysis are obtained accordingly and the flutter calculations are carried out for three blade vibration modes at the design speed and at part speeds for all possible <b>inter-blade</b> phase angles. Two operating points, one on the working line and the other near stall are investigated at every rotational speed. Different aspects that affect the aerodynamic damping behaviour like part speed operation, variation in unsteady blade surface pressure fluctuation between operating points on the working line and at near stall and the corresponding variation in aerodynamic work, <b>inter-blade</b> phase angle etc., are described. This analysis primarily focuses on the variations in aerodynamic damping of the fan with and without the influence of the disk.

40|$|The paper {{addresses}} {{two aspects}} of the tonal noise generated by a subsonic, centrifugal compressor. The first aspect is an experimental investigation, based on a modal detec-tion in the inlet duct, proving that the wake-interaction noise from the impingement of the impeller blade wakes on the diffuser vanes is the dominant mechanism. The second aspect is the analytical modelling of the sound transmission from the impeller outer radius through the <b>inter-blade</b> channels and its recombination as helical modes in the inlet duct. The propagation inside the <b>inter-blade</b> channels is described by a slowly-varying bent duct approach, for which a simplified description of the channel geometry is considered. The modal pressure patterns predicted analytically are compared with a numerical simulation using a commercial software, and the discrepancies suggest that significant modal coupling occurs, ignored in the analytical solution.

40|$|Due to the {{requirements}} for high blade loading, modern turbo‐machine blades operate {{very close to the}} stall regime. This can lead to flow separation with periodic shedding of vortices, which could lead to self induced oscillations or stall flutter of the blades. Previous studies on stall flutter have focused on flows at high Reynolds number (Re ~ 106). The Reynolds numbers for fans/propellers of Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs), high altitude turbofans and small wind turbines are substantially lower (Re < 105). Aerodynamic characteristics of flows at such low Re is significantly different from those at high Re, {{due in part to the}} early separation of the flow and possible formation of laminar separation bubbles (LSB). The present study is targeted towards study of stall flutter in a cascade of blades at low Re. We experimentally study stall flutter of a cascade of symmetric NACA 0012 blades at low Reynolds number (Re ~ 30, 000) through forced sinusoidal pitching of the blades about mean angles of incidences close to stall. The experimental arrangement permits variations of the <b>inter‐blade</b> phase (σ) in addition to the oscillation frequency (f) and amplitude; the <b>inter‐blade</b> phase angle (σ) being the phase difference between the motions of adjacent blades in the cascade. The unsteady moments on the central blade in the cascade are directly measured, and used to calculate the energy transfer from the flow to the blade. This energy transfer is used to predict the propensity of the blades to undergo self‐induced oscillations or stall flutter. Experiments are also conducted on an isolated blade in addition to the cascade. A variety of parameters can influence stall flutter in a cascade, namely the oscillation frequency (f), the mean angle of incidence, and the <b>inter‐blade</b> phase angle (σ). The measurements show that there exists a range of reduced frequencies, k (=πfc/U, c being the chord length of the blade and U being the free stream velocity), where the energy transfer from the flow to the blade is positive, which indicates that the flow can excite the blade. Above and below this range, the energy transfer is negative indicating that blade excitations, if any, will get damped. This range of excitation is found to depend upon the mean angle of incidence, with shifts towards higher values of k as the mean angle of incidence increases. An important parameter for cascades, which is absent in the isolated blade case is the <b>inter‐blade</b> phase angle (σ). An excitation regime is observed only for σ values between ‐ 450 and 900, with the value of excitation being maximum for σ of 900. Time traces of the measured moment were found to be non‐sinusoidal in the excitation regime, whereas they appear to be sinusoidal in the damping regime. Stall flutter in a cascade has differences when compared with an isolated blade. For the cascade, the maximum value of excitation (positive energy transfer) is found to be an order of magnitude lower compared to the isolated blade case. Further, for similar values of mean incidence angle, the range of excitation is at lower reduced frequencies for a cascade when compared with an isolated blade. A comparison with un‐stalled or classical flutter in a cascade at high Re, shows that the <b>inter‐blade</b> phase angle is a major factor governing flutter in both cases. Some differences are observed as well, which appear to be due to stalled flow and low Re...|$|E

The partial limbs of adult white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) were used {{as a proxy for}} human remains, and were cut using five commercially available reciprocating saw blades and a hand-powered hacksaw. The reciprocating blades tested ranged from five teeth-per-inch to 14 / 18 teeth-per-inch and included raker, alternating, and wavy tooth sets. The hacksaw blade had 32 teeth-per-inch, with wavy set teeth. All the blades examined were intended to cut wood, metal, or both materials. The resulting false start kerfs and complete kerfs on the remains were then examined macroscopically and microscopically. The present study utilized both qualitative and quantitative analysis to examine kerf features that characterize reciprocating saws. The presentation of specific features within the kerf varied based upon blade properties, how the implement was powered, and how it was wielded in reference to the material. The {{results of the present study}} demonstrated that significant differences do exist between reciprocating saw blades. Kerf characteristics in which significant differences were noted include: kerf false start (cross section) shape, frequency of cut surface drift, presence of harmonics, striation regularity, and exit chipping size. <b>Inter-blade</b> differences generally reflect class characteristics previously established for hand-powered blades, though reciprocating blades do not strictly follow these categorizations (Symes 1992; Symes et al. 1998, 2010).

The results of this investigation indicate that properly selected variable geometry rotor configurations can offer substantial improvements in hover performance without adversely affecting forward flight performance. Axial spacing of alternate blades was found to provide the greatest performance benefit, and further improvements were achieved by combining azimuth spacing with axial spacing. The performance benefit appears {{to be related to the}} relief of local adverse aerodynamic phenomena produced by vortex interference. The ogee tip design was found to substantially reduce the concentrated core intensity of the tip vortex, and could thus prove beneficial for the relief of blade-vortex interaction problems. However, the ogee tip was found to reduce hover performance at model scale.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results of}} Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) results for flows around propellers and compares their aerodynamic performance {{as well as}} their acoustics. After some validation of the employed CFD method, using wind tunnel experiments, a modern propeller design was assessed. Using the same baseline blade, different propellers were put together by adding stagger at the blade hub and small variations of the <b>inter-blade</b> angle. The employed method produced results showing differences in the propeller acoustics regarding the frequency spectrum produced by each design and the level of the acoustic tones. The effect of chancing the hub was to generate frequencies in-between the tones of the baseline design while keeping the overall propeller performance the same. The effect of the employed hub changes was to generate tones in-between the harmonics of the fundamental blade passing frequency that dominated the baseline design. Installed and un-installed blades were compared and the results show that the wing, nacelle and fuselage around the blades, influence the obtained level of noise but not the frequency content. Computations for a climbing case also show the strong effect of the flight conditions on the acoustic results...|$|E
40|$|This paper extends an {{existing}} analytical {{model of the}} aeroacoustic response of a rectilinear cascade of flat-plate blades to three-dimensional incident vortical gusts, by providing closed-form expressions for the acoustic field inside the <b>inter-blade</b> channels, {{as well as for}} the pressure jump over the blades in subsonic flows. The extended formulation is dedicated to future implementation in a fan-broadbandnoise-prediction tool. The intended applications include the modern turbofan engines, for which analytical modelling is believed to be a good alternative to more expensive numerical techniques. The initial model taken as a reference is based on the Wiener– Hopf technique. An analytical solution valid over the whole space is first derived by making an extensive use of the residue theorem. The accuracy of the model is shown by comparing with numerical predictions of benchmark configurations available in the literature. This full exact solution could be used as a reference for future assessment of numerical solvers, of linearized Euler equations for instance, in rectilinear or narrow-annulus configurations. In addition, the pressure jump is a key piece of information because it can be used as a source term in an acoustic analogy when th...|$|E
40|$|Cavitation is a {{limiting}} {{phenomenon in}} many domains of fluid mechanics. Instabilities of a partial cavity developed on an hydrofoil, a converging-diverging step {{or in an}} <b>inter-blade</b> channel in turbomachinery, have already been investigated and described in many previous works. The {{aim of this study}} is to evaluate a passive control method of the sheet cavity. According to operating conditions, cavitation can be described by two different regimes: an unstable regime with a cloud cavitation shedding and a stable regime with only a pulsating sheet cavity. Avoiding cloud cavitation can limit structure damages since a pulsating sheet cavity is less agressive. The surface condition of a converging-diverging step, like a Venturi-type obstacle, is here studied as a solution for a passive control of the cavitation. This study discusses the effect of an organized roughness, in the shape of longitudinal grooves, on the developed sheet cavity. Analyzes conducted with Laser Doppler Velocimetry, visualisations and pressure measurements show that the grooves geometry, and especially the groove depth, acts on the sheet cavity dynamics. Results show that modifying the surface condition, by varying the grooves geometry, can reduce cavity sheet length and even suppress the cloud cavitation shedding.

40|$|This paper {{investigated}} {{the application of}} FBG sensors in the measurement of scissor blade–tissue interaction forces. Sensor placement at the blade–tissue interaction site provides the basis for increased force measurement accuracy, without compromising the functionality of the instrument. This increased accuracy provided the foundation for in-depth analysis of the force components generated during typical scissor cutting cycles. Theoretical analysis and experimental investigation explored the decoupling of the major forces present during cutting. The isolation of tissue-fracture forces from <b>inter-blade</b> friction forces was carried out. This is useful as knowledge of the fracture properties of biological tissues can be diff cult to obtain. Moreover, the force information obtained can be ref ected to the user in a telerobotic application ensuring {{a greater sense of}} user immersion. Scissor cutting force data is of particular relevance to those involved in the development of soft tissue models for medical simulation systems. The motivation behind this work is to develop a smart surgical instrument capable of unobtrusively, and with minimal impact on instrument functionality, detecting tissue– instrument interaction forces. Future work will involve the miniaturization of the current technique enabling the development of a laparoscopic prototype instrument capable of acquiring in vivo force and material fracture propertie...|$|E
