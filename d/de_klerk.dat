5|$|In 1989, Botha {{suffered}} a stroke; although he would retain the state presidency, {{he stepped down}} {{as leader of the}} National Party, to be replaced by F. W. <b>de</b> <b>Klerk.</b> In a surprise move, Botha invited Mandela to a meeting over tea in July 1989, an invitation Mandela considered genial. Botha was replaced as state president by <b>de</b> <b>Klerk</b> six weeks later; the new president believed that apartheid was unsustainable and released a number of ANC prisoners. Following the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989, <b>de</b> <b>Klerk</b> called his cabinet together to debate legalising the ANC and freeing Mandela. Although some were deeply opposed to his plans, <b>de</b> <b>Klerk</b> met with Mandela in December to discuss the situation, a meeting both men considered friendly, before legalising all formerly banned political parties in February 1990 and announcing Mandela's unconditional release. Shortly thereafter, {{for the first time in}} 20 years, photographs of Mandela were allowed to be published in South Africa.|$|E
5|$|Following growing {{pressure}} from the anti-apartheid movement both domestically and internationally, in 1990 State President Frederik Willem <b>de</b> <b>Klerk</b> reversed the ban on the African National Congress and other anti-apartheid organisations, and announced that Mandela would shortly be released from prison. Mandela was released in February 1990. He persuaded Makeba to return to South Africa, which she did, using her French passport, on 10 June 1990.|$|E
5|$|The {{democratic}} process was {{threatened by the}} Concerned South Africans Group (COSAG), an alliance of black ethnic-secessionist groups like Inkatha and far-right Afrikaner parties; in June 1993, one of the latter—the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging (AWB)—attacked the Kempton Park World Trade Centre. Following the murder of ANC activist Chris Hani, Mandela made a publicised speech to calm rioting, soon after appearing at a mass funeral in Soweto for Tambo, who {{had died of a}} stroke. In July 1993, both Mandela and <b>de</b> <b>Klerk</b> visited the US, independently meeting President Bill Clinton and each receiving the Liberty Medal. Soon after, Mandela and <b>de</b> <b>Klerk</b> were jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in Norway. Influenced by Thabo Mbeki, Mandela began meeting with big business figures, and played down his support for nationalisation, fearing that he would scare away much-needed foreign investment. Although criticised by socialist ANC members, he had been encouraged to embrace private enterprise by members of the Chinese and Vietnamese Communist parties at the January 1992 World Economic Forum in Switzerland.|$|E

25|$|Botha {{remained}} largely {{out of sight}} of the media and it was widely believed that he remained opposed to many of F. W. <b>de</b> <b>Klerk's</b> reforms.|$|R
5|$|Mandela served 27 {{years in}} prison, {{initially}} on Robben Island, {{and later in}} Pollsmoor Prison and Victor Verster Prison. Amid growing domestic and international pressure, and with fears of a racial civil war, President F. W. <b>de</b> <b>Klerk</b> released him in 1990. Mandela and <b>de</b> <b>Klerk</b> negotiated an end to apartheid and organised the 1994 multiracial general election in which Mandela led the ANC to victory and became President. Leading a broad coalition government which promulgated a new constitution, Mandela emphasised reconciliation between the country's racial groups and created the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to investigate past human rights abuses. Economically, Mandela's administration retained its predecessor's liberal framework despite his own socialist beliefs, also introducing measures to encourage land reform, combat poverty, and expand healthcare services. Internationally, he acted as mediator in the Pan Am Flight 103 bombing trial and served as Secretary-General of the Non-Aligned Movement from 1998 to 1999. He declined a second presidential term and in 1999 was succeeded by his deputy, Thabo Mbeki. Mandela became an elder statesman and focused on combating poverty and HIV/AIDS through the charitable Nelson Mandela Foundation.|$|E
5|$|Following the Bisho massacre, {{in which}} 28 ANC {{supporters}} and one soldier were shot dead by the Ciskei Defence Force during a protest march, Mandela realised that mass action was leading to further violence and resumed negotiations in September. He {{agreed to do}} so on the conditions that all political prisoners be released, that Zulu traditional weapons be banned, and that Zulu hostels would be fenced off, the latter two measures intended to prevent further Inkatha attacks; <b>de</b> <b>Klerk</b> reluctantly agreed. The negotiations agreed that a multiracial general election would be held, resulting in a five-year coalition {{government of national unity}} and a constitutional assembly that gave the National Party continuing influence. The ANC also conceded to safeguarding the jobs of white civil servants; such concessions brought fierce internal criticism. The duo agreed on an interim constitution based on a liberal democratic model, guaranteeing separation of powers, creating a constitutional court, and including a US-style bill of rights; it also divided the country into nine provinces, each with its own premier and civil service, a concession between de Klerk's desire for federalism and Mandela's for unitary government.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, President F.W. <b>de</b> <b>Klerk</b> started {{negotiations}} to end apartheid in South Africa with Nelson Mandela's African National Congress (ANC). During negotiation, the white South African Rugby Board and the non-racial South African Rugby Union merged {{to create the}} South African Rugby Football Union. Rugby {{at the time was}} seen by black South Africans as a symbol of white supremacy. The ANC demanded that the new SARFU improve development of black players. This was because the Springboks team consisted solely of white players at the time, though black players were eligible for selection for the Springboks following the merger of the two governing bodies. Following the yes vote in the South African apartheid referendum in March 1992, the IRB lifted restrictions on tours of South Africa. It was announced that the return test would be against New Zealand. This was criticised in South Africa as the Springboks had not played full international rugby for 11 years and it was felt it would not be competitive however New Zealand were invited because it was felt appropriate after the events around the 1981 South Africa rugby union tour.|$|E

25|$|In 1998, <b>de</b> <b>Klerk</b> and {{his wife}} of 38 years, Marike <b>de</b> <b>Klerk,</b> were {{divorced}} following the discovery of his affair with Elita Georgiades, then the wife of Tony Georgiades, a Greek shipping tycoon who had allegedly given <b>de</b> <b>Klerk</b> and the NP financial support. Soon after his divorce, <b>de</b> <b>Klerk</b> and Georgiades were married. His divorce and remarriage scandalised conservative South African opinion, especially among the Calvinist Afrikaners. In 1999, his autobiography, The Last Trek – A New Beginning, was published. In 2001, following {{the murder of his}} former wife, the manuscript of her own autobiography, A Place Where the Sun Shines Again, was submitted to <b>de</b> <b>Klerk,</b> who urged the publishers to suppress a chapter dealing with his infidelity.|$|E

In early 1998, when Botha refused to testify at the Mandela government's Truth and Reconciliation Commission, he was supported by the right-wing Conservative Party, which had earlier contested his rule as the official opposition. For his refusal, he was fined and given a suspended jail sentence for crimes against human rights. [...] The sentence was overturned on appeal. Shortly before his death in late 2006, he renewed his opposition towards egalitarian democracy in favour of a confederate system based upon the principles of [...] "separate development".|$|R
50|$|Louis Pienaar (26 June 1926 - 5 November 2012) was a South African {{lawyer and}} diplomat.

25|$|On 4 December 2001, Marike <b>de</b> <b>Klerk</b> {{was found}} stabbed and strangled {{to death in}} her Cape Town flat. <b>De</b> <b>Klerk,</b> who was on a brief visit to Stockholm, Sweden, to {{celebrate}} the 100-year anniversary of the Nobel Prize foundation, announced he would immediately return to mourn his dead ex-wife. The atrocity was reportedly condemned strongly by South African president Thabo Mbeki and Winnie Mandela, among others, who openly spoke in favour of Marike <b>de</b> <b>Klerk.</b> On 6 December 21-year-old security guard Luyanda Mboniswa was arrested for the murder. On 15 May 2003, he received two life sentences for murder, as well as three years for breaking into Marike de Klerk's apartment.|$|E
25|$|In 1993, <b>De</b> <b>Klerk</b> and Mandela were jointly {{awarded the}} Nobel Peace Prize {{for their work}} in ending apartheid. The {{awarding}} of the prize to <b>de</b> <b>Klerk</b> was controversial, especially {{in the light of}} de Klerk's reported admission that he ordered a massacre of supposed Azanian Peoples' Liberation Army fighters, including teenagers, shortly before going to Oslo in 1993. It appears that this massacre may form part of the basis for criminal charges that the Anti-Racism Action Forum laid against <b>de</b> <b>Klerk</b> in early 2016. Further, de Klerk's role in the destabilization of the country during the negotiation process through the operation of a 'third force' {{came to the attention of}} the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, and was never ultimately clarified.|$|E
25|$|In 1999, <b>de</b> <b>Klerk</b> {{established}} the pro-peace FW <b>de</b> <b>Klerk</b> Foundation {{of which he}} is the chairman. <b>De</b> <b>Klerk</b> is also chairman of the Global Leadership Foundation, headquartered in London, which he set up in 2004, an organisation which works to support democratic leadership, prevent and resolve conflict through mediation and promote good governance in the form of democratic institutions, open markets, human rights and the rule of law. It does so by making available, discreetly and in confidence, the experience of former leaders to today's national leaders. It is a not-for-profit organisation composed of former heads of government and senior governmental and international organisation officials who work closely with heads of government on governance-related issues of concern to them.|$|E
50|$|In 1990, on {{his return}} to South Africa, Louis Pienaar was {{nominated}} to be Minister of Education in President F W <b>de</b> <b>Klerk's</b> government where {{he was responsible for}} the dismantling of the structures of apartheid.

25|$|On 18 January 1989, Botha (then aged 73) {{suffered}} a mild stroke which {{prevented him from}} attending a meeting with Namibian political leaders on 20 January 1989. Botha's place was taken by acting president, J. Christiaan Heunis. On 2 February 1989, Botha resigned {{as leader of the}} National Party (NP) anticipating his nominee – finance minister Barend du Plessis – would succeed him. Instead, the NP's parliamentary caucus selected as leader education minister F. W. <b>de</b> <b>Klerk,</b> who moved quickly to consolidate his position within the party. In March 1989, the NP elected <b>De</b> <b>Klerk</b> as state president but Botha refused to resign, saying in a television address that the constitution entitled him to remain in office until March 1990 and that he was even considering running for another five-year term. Following a series of acrimonious meetings in Cape Town, and five days after UNSCR 435 was implemented in Namibia on 1 April 1989, Botha and <b>De</b> <b>Klerk</b> reached a compromise: Botha would retire after the parliamentary elections in September, allowing <b>de</b> <b>Klerk</b> to take over as president.|$|E

25|$|<b>De</b> <b>Klerk</b> {{was sworn}} in as acting state {{president}} on 14 August 1989 and the following month was nominated by the electoral college to succeed Botha in a five-year term as state president. Within months of the collapse of the Berlin Wall, <b>De</b> <b>Klerk</b> had announced the legalisation of anti-apartheid groups – including the African National Congress – and the release of Nelson Mandela. De Klerk's rule saw the dismantling of the apartheid system and negotiations that eventually led to South Africa's first racially inclusive democratic elections on 27 April 1994.|$|E
5000|$|Smuts {{served as}} a {{constitutional}} negotiator for the DP during the transition from Apartheid to democracy.

5000|$|Thatcher {{therefore}} welcomed <b>de</b> <b>Klerk's</b> {{decision in}} February 1990 to release Mandela {{and lift the}} ban on the ANC, and said the change vindicated her positive policy: [...] "We believe in carrots as well as sticks". However Thatcher had also set the freeing of Mandela {{as a condition of}} friendship with the white government.|$|R
50|$|During the negotiations, <b>De</b> <b>Klerk's</b> {{government}} {{pushed for}} a two-phase transition with an appointed transitional government with a rotating presidency. The ANC pushed instead for a transition in a single stage to majority rule. Other sticking points included minority rights, decisions on a unitary or federal state, property rights, and indemnity from prosecution for politically motivated crimes.|$|R
25|$|In 1990, <b>de</b> <b>Klerk</b> gave {{orders to}} end South Africa's nuclear weapons programme; {{the process of}} nuclear {{disarmament}} was essentially completed in 1991. The existence of the programme was not officially acknowledged before 1993.|$|E
25|$|Veeckens {{wanted to}} sold the house off again. In 1819, {{the estate of}} <b>de</b> <b>Klerk</b> was bought by Leendert Miero. Miero, born in 1755 in Grodka near Lemberg (now Lviv), arrived in Batavia in 1775 {{to work for the}} Dutch East India Company. He is {{actually}} a Polish Jew whose real name is Jehoede Leip Jegiel Igel. He hid his true identity because the Dutch East India Company prohibited the Jews from travelling to its holdings, especially its new headquarters in Batavia. In 1777, Igel was received by <b>de</b> <b>Klerk</b> in the mansion and served as a low-ranked security guard for the mansion. A story goes that on a hot day Jehoeve fell asleep while guarding the entrance. When <b>de</b> <b>Klerk</b> unexpectedly returned, he was given 50 strokes for his laziness. On that same day, he swore that he would own the estate one day. After finishing his military service, Jehoeve changed his name to Leendert Miero and worked as a goldsmith. Despite being illiterate, he was able to make a fortune and bought the estate of Pondok Gede. Miero was able to reveal his identity when the VOC agreed to include Jews in its ranks in 1782. In the end, he bought the house of <b>de</b> <b>Klerk.</b> For the next 15 years, Miero invited big crowds to celebrate the anniversary of his lashing day, celebrated with a biblical humor. Miero married to two legal wives but he had no children. Instead, he adopted four natural children born to him by four different slaves.|$|E
25|$|After {{the first}} {{universal}} elections in 1994, <b>de</b> <b>Klerk</b> became deputy {{president in the}} government of national unity under Nelson Mandela, a post he kept until 1996. In 1997 he resigned the leadership of the National Party and retired from politics.|$|E
50|$|Mbowisa violently gripped <b>de</b> <b>Klerk's</b> neck, {{breaking}} several {{bones in}} her throat and causing a blood vessel to burst in her eye. A steak knife was found embedded in her back and she also suffered several wounds to the head. Mbowisa was acquitted of a rape charge but a pathologist {{was not able to}} rule out penetration.|$|R
50|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} {{at a time}} when South Africa was undergoing great political upheaval and regular demonstrations. The film itself was initially banned by South African censors, who said it could harm President F.W. <b>de</b> <b>Klerk's</b> attempts at apartheid reform. The ban was later lifted in September 1989 and the movie was screened at the Weekly Mail Film Festival in Johannesburg.|$|R
50|$|The {{success of}} the march {{and the fact that}} the police refused to enforce the ban against such gatherings under the then State of Emergency led to further marches in many parts of the country, often instigated by {{religious}} leaders. Liberal commentator Allister Sparks regards the march as the beginning of the normalisation of South African politics and September 1989 as the culmination of <b>De</b> <b>Klerk's</b> conversion to negotiations.|$|R
