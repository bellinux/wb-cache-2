However, the existence of fragmented and outsourced manufacturing, accompanied by aggressive buying practices, militates against `aspirational' code provisions in this area. Limited progress is possible only through substantial brand collaboration, an acceptance of collective bargaining through trade unions in supplier factories and, longer term, moves by brands and retailers to own and control their own manufacturing capacity...|$|E

30|$|For a {{realistic}} {{representation of the}} Canadian economy, a foreign sector is {{also included in the}} model to represent external trade. This feature allows us to better capture the impact of foreign savings on capital accumulation, hence long-term effects of policy shocks. We assume that foreign and domestic goods are imperfect substitutes. This geographical differentiation is introduced by the standard Armingtonian assumption with a CES function between imports and domestic goods. On the supply side, producers make an optimal distribution of their production between exports and domestic sales according to a CET function. We also assume a finite elasticity export demand function. In order to increase their exports, local producers must decrease their <b>free</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> (FOB) <b>prices.</b>|$|R
40|$|Cote d'Ivoire has {{historically}} taxed cocoa producers. Market reforms {{over the past}} 10 years have somewhat succeeded in making domestic and foreign marketing more transparent and competitive. But they have not done much to raise producer prices in real terms or {{as a share of}} the FOB (<b>free</b> <b>on</b> <b>board)</b> <b>price.</b> Maintaining fixed producer prices and marketing costs and margins has encouraged rent-seeking and led to efficiency losses. New reform will fully liberalize the country's export marketing system by eliminating public management of exports. This means the end of mandatory export authorization, of public forward sales, and of fixed minimum producer prices and marketing margins. The new reform is expected to improve producers'incomes. The authors find that the benefits from the new reform (in terms of lower implicit taxes, lower marketing costs and margins, and higher producer prices) will outweigh the costs from eliminating public forward sales and fixed producer prices. Results from a general equilibrium model indicate that reducing export taxes would have a small negative effect on aggregate income but would improve income distribution for poorer rural areas. The fact that Cote d'Ivoire has market power in the world cocoa market justifies a higher optimal export tax than the current one. But raising export taxes may eventually reduce its market share and worsen income distribution, {{at the expense of the}} poorer rural sector.

40|$|Graduation date: 1990 The main {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to compare the demand and the price of hard red winter (HRW) wheat and white wheat (WW) to determine the similarities and the differences between these two wheat classes.

The significant variable is the lagged ratio between the WW farm price and the U. S. loan rate. These two systems of equations for HRW and WW were compared using the Wald test. The Wald test was applied to the combined system of equations, to each independent set of equations, and to selected common coefficients. The results show a difference between the coefficients of HRW and WW system of equations, due to the foreign demand equations and especially from the coefficients of GNP of the country importing HRW and WW and the coefficients of the lagged foreign demand...|$|R
40|$|There is an {{opportunity}} for Mozambique to export to the flourishing South African bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L) market, which imports significant quantities of beans from as far as Argentina, China, and Canada. Mozambique, informally, exports substantial quantities of its beans to Malawi, and possibly Tanzania and Zambia, receiving about $ 400 /ton less than what the South African market is paying for its beans. All indication is that the quality of Mozambican beans is as good as, if not better, than most South African imports. It is plausible that under the Southern African Development Community (SADC) cooperation policies, Mozambique can redirect some of its bean exports towards South African markets; however, {{little is known about the}} Mozambican ability to respond to South African demand. ^ This study aims at examining the bean supply response potential of Mozambique. A mathematical programming analysis of representative farms in bean growing areas was used to explore the bean production potential. Bean growers in all major bean producing areas in Mozambique were interviewed to provide production data for the study. ^ Results indicated that in general bean production responds to price increases in the price range up 15 Mt/Kg. Up to that price a, 1 percent price increase leads to an approximately 0. 38 % quantity increase. Beyond 15 Mt/Kg, supply is inelastic. The key constraint is scarcity of labor and capital in the rural areas. The fact that land is easily available for farmers creates a situation in which everyone wants to farm their own land, leading to labor scarcity. Also the technology is rudimentary, based on the use of hoes, axes and manual labor, which prevents farmers from cultivating larger farms. Farmers cultivate land areas varying from 0. 25 to 5 hectares, with the majority farming about 2 ha. ^ Results also indicated that when the labor constraint is relaxed, that is when the labor requirement is cut in half across activities, supply increases by 21 %. When labor and capital are relaxed together, supply increases by 100 %. These results indicate that bean supply will benefit from technology developments in Mozambique, especially the technologies aiming at improving labor productivity, such as animal traction, or yield increasing technologies, such as improved varieties. ^ In terms of the Mozambican potential for exporting beans to South Africa, it was determined that in general Mozambican beans could be delivered for less than $ 700 /Ton (17500 Mt/Ton), which is the <b>free</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> bean <b>price</b> at the Durban port for imported beans as of late 2004 (the most recent published data). ...|$|R
40|$|Prices {{determine}} {{allocation of}} resources in a market economy, yet their role in international trade theory is often underappreciated. In these three essays I provide novel empirical implementations of several theories relating to the prices of traded goods and show the implications for measuring the impact of quality, boosting welfare through increased variety, and explaining exchange rate fluctuations. Chapter 1 uses {{a variation on the}} well-known gravity model of trade to show that the observed correlation of export prices with distance is largely due to aggregating across shipping modes. Distance has no affect <b>on</b> <b>free</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> export <b>prices</b> once mode of transportation is controlled for; where goods are shipped by multiple modes, the observed distance premium conflates a selection effect with a direct effect. I also demonstrate that the standard Alchian-Allen analysis does not apply if goods are shipped by multiple modes of transportation, undermining an additional theoretical basis for predicting that average quality is increasing with distance in these industries. Thus, prior interpretations of the distance premium as indicating the existence of firm quality differentiation are shown to be largely unfounded. As a whole, the chapter highlights the important and little-studied role of transportation mode, and shows that it has a significant and overlooked impact on traded goods prices. Chapter 2, joint work with David Weinstein of Columbia University and Christian Broda of Duquesne Capital Management, evaluates the importance of countries worldwide gaining access to new varieties of traded goods in an semi-endogenous growth model framework. As producers gain access to new imported varieties, productivity rises and the cost of innovation falls, resulting in the creation of new varieties. These in turn can be exported, thus multiplying the impact on the world economy as a whole. We construct an exact price index that incorporates the effect of variety, using detailed trade data on thousands of markets in a large multicountry dataset, and we confirm that increased import variety translated into a large increase in productivity growth. In turn, this boosted world permanent income by almost a fifth over the decade we analyzed. In Chapter 3, I revisit the debate on exchange rate determination, in particular why the link between changes in prices and movements in the exchange rate seems so weak. I test two hypotheses to ascertain whether previous research failed to confirm purchasing power parity due to misspecification. I find support for substituting import price indices for the consumer price indices typically used, although an additional proposed correction due to the non-continuous nature of the underlying data does not affect the results. This outcome may be attributable to choosing a base country with relatively low variation in its consumer price index. Nonetheless, the paper highlights the importance of focusing on traded goods prices and in doing so shows that the extent of unexplained exchange rate variation is greatly reduced...|$|R
