5|$|After {{his release}} from prison in 2010, Chen was placed under house arrest against Chinese law, and was closely {{monitored}} by security forces. Legally, he was proclaimed {{by the government to}} be a free man, but in reality the local government offered no explanation for the hundreds of unidentified agents monitoring <b>his</b> <b>house</b> <b>and</b> preventing visitors or escape. The national propaganda organ, the Global Times, expressed confusion over the issue, and suggested that the local government may not know how to handle it, but no disciplinary action was taken at the national level.|$|E

Though Post offered him financial interest in La Vita Inn and his prospective famous breakfast drink, Postum, provided Beilhart he would stay and work at the Inn. Outraged at his friend's betrayal, Beilhart ordered Post out of <b>his</b> <b>house</b> <b>and</b> left Battle Creek for Ohio. Louema left Jacob and took the children back to her family in Kansas in 1897. This experience undoubtedly had a profound effect upon Beilhart's view of marriage.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1410s several Fellows of Oriel {{took part in}} the {{disturbances}} accompanying Archbishop Arundel's attempt to stamp out Lollardy in the University; the Lollard belief that religious power and authority came through piety and not through the hierarchy of the Church particularly inflamed passions in Oxford, where its proponent, John Wycliffe, had been head of Balliol. Disregarding the Provost's authority, Oriel's Fellows fought bloody battles with other scholars, killed one of the Chancellor's servants when they attacked <b>his</b> <b>house,</b> <b>and</b> were prominent among the group that obstructed the Archbishop and ridiculed his censures.|$|E

5|$|One {{high-profile}} {{case that}} illustrated Bradley's opposition to racial violence {{was that of}} ex-slave George Dinning. After being emancipated, Dinning saved enough money to purchase a farm in Simpson County. On January 27, 1897, a mob of 25armed white men came to Dinning's farm, accused him of stealing hogs and chickens, and demanded he leave the county within 10days. Dinning denied being a thief and insisted several people in the county would vouch for his good character. The mob, enraged by Dinning's resistance, began firing on <b>his</b> <b>house</b> <b>and</b> wounded him twice. Dinning retrieved a gun from <b>his</b> <b>house</b> <b>and</b> fired into the mob, killing one man. The mob fled, and the next day, Dinning turned himself in to local officials. While he was in their custody, the mob returned to his farm, drove his family from their house, looted it, and razed it to the ground.|$|E

5|$|After Einarr {{had settled}} in Orkney two of Harald Finehair's unruly sons, Halvdan Hålegg (English: Hálfdan Longlegs) and Gudrød Ljome (English: Gudrod the Gleaming), killed Einarr's father Rognvald by {{trapping}} him in <b>his</b> <b>house</b> <b>and</b> setting it alight. Gudrød took possession of Rognvald's lands while Hálfdan sailed westwards to Orkney and then displaced Einarr. The sagas say that King Harald, apparently appalled by his sons' actions, overthrew Gudrød and restored Rognvald's lands to his son, Thorir. From a base in Caithness on the Scottish mainland Einarr resisted Hálfdan's occupation of the islands. After winning a battle at sea, and a ruthless campaign on land, Einarr spied Hálfdan hiding on North Ronaldsay. The sagas claim that Hálfdan was captured, and sacrificed to Odin as a blood eagle.|$|E
5|$|As {{his wealth}} grew, Moore {{began to worry}} about his legacy. With {{the help of his}} {{daughter}} Mary, he set up the Henry Moore Trust in 1972, with a view to protecting his estate from death duties. By 1977, he was paying close to a million pounds a year in income tax; to mitigate his tax burden, he established the Henry Moore Foundation as a registered charity with Irina and Mary as trustees. The Foundation was established to encourage the public appreciation of the visual arts and especially the works of Moore. It now runs <b>his</b> <b>house</b> <b>and</b> estate at Perry Green, with a gallery, sculpture park and studios.|$|E

He says he owes his father everything and he is not willing to hurt him. Dan attempts to woo Shirley again, forcing her to confess her relationship with Ash.

5|$|During Michigan's in-home visit, Howard's {{grandmother}} treated Michigan {{head coach}} Fisher, his assistants Mike Boyd and Brian Dutcher, Vocational coach Cook, Vocational assistant coach Donnie Kirskey, Lois Howard (Howard's aunt) and Howard to a soul food dinner. Dutcher had {{the responsibility to}} contact Howard several times a week. Howard grew close to assistant coach Kirskey, often staying at <b>his</b> <b>house</b> <b>and</b> using his car once he got a driver's license. During the summer 1990 30-day visitation period, Dutcher watched Howard practice 28 consecutive days. Dutcher developed {{an understanding of the}} dynamics of Howard's relationship with his grandmother. While other coaches, such as Lute Olsen, almost ignored her during the recruiting, Dutcher understood that she was the key influence on his life, and understood that Kirskey also had sway with Howard. He encouraged Fisher to hire Kirskey for a summer basketball camp that, which became the young athlete's introduction to Ann Arbor, Michigan.|$|E
