60|$|They {{watched the}} little steamer fuss across {{the patch of}} sunlit river, suffer {{momentary}} occultation from the acacia, and <b>glide</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> behind the dark window-frame.|$|E
60|$|The constable <b>glided</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight,</b> {{and five}} minutes of silent {{suspense}} followed.|$|R
60|$|The bordermen watched Legget and {{his band}} {{disappear}} into the thicket adjoining the grove. When the last dark, lithe form <b>glided</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> among the yellowing copse, Jonathan leaped from the low cliff, and had hardly reached the ground before Wetzel dashed down to the grassy turf.|$|R
60|$|Slowly {{the snake}} had lifted {{itself from the}} box, to glare at several of the boys. Then its cold, beady {{eyes were fixed on}} Dick and it uttered a vicious hiss. This was more than the eldest Rover could stand and he let box and snake drop in a hurry. The snake <b>glided</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> under a bed.|$|R
6000|$|She {{was still}} {{standing}} motionless in the same place: her eyes wandered back from me to the snake; gradually its swaying head was lowered again, and the coil unwound from her ankle; then it began to move away, slowly at first, and with the head a little raised, then faster, {{and in the end}} it <b>glided</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight.</b> Gone!--but it had left its venom in my blood--O cursed reptile! ...|$|R
60|$|While we loiter {{here this}} autumn evening, {{looking for a}} spot retired enough, where we shall quietly rest to-night, they thus, in that chilly March evening, one hundred and forty-two years before us, with wind and current favoring, have already <b>glided</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight,</b> not to camp, as we shall, at night, but while two sleep one will manage the canoe, and the swift stream bear them onward to the settlements, it may be, even to old John Lovewell's house on Salmon Brook to-night.|$|R
6000|$|The wren <b>glided</b> away <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> amongst its thorns. I knew by {{his sudden}} stillness {{that this had}} been unwelcome news. [...] "That will be very {{pleasant}} for me, won't it?" [...] I said.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mac, tell thim yez saw me!" [...] called Casey. Then {{he waved}} his hand in good-by to the crowd. Their {{response}} was a short, ringing yell. They watched the car <b>glide</b> slowly <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight.</b>|$|R
60|$|As {{they looked}} about {{them on the}} {{decaying}} furniture, it was strange to find how vividly it presented those to whom it had belonged, and with whom it was once familiar. Grip seemed to perch again upon his high-backed chair; Barnaby to crouch in his old favourite corner by the fire; the mother to resume her usual seat, and watch him as of old. Even when they could separate these objects from the phantoms of the mind which they invoked, the latter only <b>glided</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight,</b> but lingered near them still; for then they seemed to lurk in closets and behind the doors, ready to start out and suddenly accost them in well-remembered tones.|$|R
6000|$|I {{led them}} slowly {{back to their}} hiding place, gave them a last lick at my hands, and pushed them gently under the hemlock curtain. When they tried to come out I pushed them back again. [...] "Stay there, and mind your mother; stay there, and follow your mother," [...] I kept whispering. And to this day I have a half belief that they understood, not the word but the feeling behind it; for they grew quiet after a time and looked out with wide-open, {{wondering}} eyes. Then I dodged <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight,</b> jumped the fallen log to throw them off the scent should they come out, crossed the brook, and <b>glided</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> into the underbrush. Once safely <b>out</b> <b>of</b> hearing I {{headed straight for the}} open, a few yards away, where the blasted stems of the burned hillside showed faintly through the green of the big woods, and climbed, and looked, and changed my position, till at last I could see the fallen tree under whose roots my little innocents were hiding.|$|R
5000|$|The god Neptune {{wanted to}} marry Salacia, but she was in great awe of her {{distinguished}} suitor, and to preserve her virginity, with grace and celerity she managed to <b>glide</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> his <b>sight,</b> and hid from him in the Atlantic Ocean. The grieving Neptune sent a dolphin to look for her and persuade the fair nymph {{to come back and}} share his throne. Salacia agreed to marry Neptune and the King of the Deep was so overjoyed at these good tidings that the dolphin was awarded a place in the heavens, where he now forms a well known constellation Delphinus.|$|R
60|$|When {{the last}} of the line had <b>glided</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> among the bushes of the point below, I ran swiftly through the woods, making no noise in the soft snow, and {{crouched}} motionless under the spruces on the lower side of the point, hoping to see the cunning hunters again. There was but a moment to wait. From under a bending evergreen tip Moktaques leaped out and went flying across the open for the next wooded point. Close behind him sounded a snarl, and with a terrific rush as she sighted the game the old lynx burst out, calling savagely to her line of hunters to close in. Like the blast of a squall they came, stretching out in enormous bounds and closing in from either end so as to cut off the circling run of the flying game. In a flash the two ends of the line had met and whirled in sharply; in another flash Moktaques was crouching close in the snow {{in the center of a}} fierce circle that rolled in upon him like a whirlwind. As the smallest lynx leaped for his game an electric shock seemed to touch the motionless hare. He shot forward as if galvanized, leaping high over the crouching terror before him, striving to break <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the terrible circle. Then the lynx over whose head he passed leaped straight up, caught the flying creature fairly in his great paws, fell over backwards, and was covered in an instant by the other lynxes that hurled themselves upon him like furies, snapping and clawing ferociously at the mouthful which he had pulled down at the very moment of its escape.|$|R
60|$|But at this {{important}} juncture the colonel came lounging in, and Kitty <b>glided</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the room.|$|R
60|$|She {{dropped the}} veil over her face--and, {{followed}} by her train <b>of</b> cats, <b>glided</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the room.|$|R
60|$|And with a {{deep and}} {{elaborate}} bow and {{another look at the}} clock, Chauvelin <b>glided</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the room.|$|R
60|$|Madame Fosco {{bowed her}} head twice--once sternly to me, once submissively to her husband, and <b>glided</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the room.|$|R
60|$|And as the Seer spoke, {{the awful}} Presence <b>glided</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Nothingness, and sat, sphinx-like, {{at the feet}} of the Alchemist.|$|R
60|$|A gray form <b>glided</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> {{the green}} and began to run down the trail toward him--a lithe, swift girl in buckskin.|$|R
6000|$|Hugh wheeled {{round and}} drew his sword, but almost {{before it had}} left the {{scabbard}} a long figure <b>glided</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the snow, and said: ...|$|R
5000|$|Some {{members of}} Ommastrephidae (volplaning species) {{are known to}} have the ability to <b>glide</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> water, earning them the common name of [...] "flying squid".|$|R
60|$|She jumped up, {{arranged}} {{the music on}} the harpsichord, and then, seeing the Baronet and his lady seated at picquet, quietly <b>glided</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the room.|$|R
60|$|She gave {{a slight}} start and {{without looking at}} me again <b>glided</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the room, the many folds of her brown skirt {{remaining}} undisturbed as she moved.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{feel as if}} I {{had really}} been to China, and I'm sure I look so," [...] said Rose, as they <b>glided</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> {{the shadow of the}} [...] "Rajah." ...|$|R
60|$|At <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> me {{she stopped}} short, {{in the most}} {{beautiful}} confusion, stammered out {{a word or two}} about looking for her father, <b>glided</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the door, and I heard her bounding up the staircase, like a frightened fawn, with the little dog barking after her.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Sh! What was that? Stealthy footsteps! Low voices! We gasp, {{we close}} up together, and wait. A vague shape <b>glides</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the dusk and confronts us. A voice speaks--demands money! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, yes; I will," [...] said Northwick. The girl {{gave his}} head a hug, and then <b>glided</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the room. She stopped to throw him a kiss from the door.|$|R
60|$|In {{a moment}} the rope was cast off, and Rosco was free. Then Ebony, bidding him keep up his heart, <b>glided</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the cavern and left him in {{profound}} darkness.|$|R
60|$|Noiselessly, {{as she had}} come, Juliette <b>glided</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> {{the room}} again, leaving behind her an {{atmosphere}} of wild flowers, of the bouquet she had gathered, then scattered in the woods.|$|R
60|$|Into {{the shadow}} of a starlit night he saw the figure he had been waiting for <b>glide</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the glitter of the hotel lights. He {{followed}} it down the road.|$|R
6000|$|Wade hesitated; then stooping low, he softly swept {{aside the}} {{intervening}} boughs <b>of</b> spruce, <b>glided</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the thicket into the open. Two noiseless bounds! Another, {{and he was}} inside the door! ...|$|R
60|$|At last Mr Clinton came, and {{his wife}} <b>glided</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the room, leaving the curate to convert him. There was a little pause while Mr Evans took stock of the clerk.|$|R
60|$|He <b>glided</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> {{the cabin}} {{with the letter}} in his hand. In about ten minutes he returned. Mr. Coulson was still sleeping. He {{replaced}} the letter, pressing down the envelope carefully.|$|R
60|$|She had {{not moved}} {{since he left}} her. She rose from her dark corner {{when he made his}} announcement, and, without {{speaking}} or raising her veil, <b>glided</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the room like a ghost.|$|R
60|$|The uneasiness of {{the young}} man was of short continuance; for, ere he had been many minutes at his post, a door opened, and two light and timid forms <b>glided</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the house.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I <b>glided</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> {{the house}} in a cold sweat. The only {{pressure}} in heaven or earth which could have forced me to renounce Cytherea was now put upon me--the dread of a death upon the gallows.|$|R
50|$|Glidemaster is a Standardbred trotter who {{was named}} the 2006 United States Harness Horse of the Year by the U.S. Trotting Association. He is a 2003 brown {{stallion}} by Yankee <b>Glide</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Cressida Hanover by Mr Lavec.|$|R
