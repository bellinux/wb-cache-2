5000|$|The {{history of}} Nergård AS goes {{way back to}} the end of the 1940s. It all began in 1947 with a fishing boat that was called Ovedia that was owned by Arvid and Olga Nergård. The boat was used to travel along the coast of Finnmark and Lofoten to buy fish that were <b>gutted</b> <b>and</b> <b>salted</b> on board before it was sold to people. They had the boat for many years and were very successful. This {{developed}} to their purchase of a factory in the start of 1972. The factory was sited at Lysnes in Senja that is in Nord of Norway. Here the company [...] "Arvid Nergård AS" [...] was started. After a while their son Ole-Arvid took over. He developed the company from being a factory in Lysnes to be a big group with many subsidiaries all around North-Norway.|$|E

50|$|Northern Bay Sands is {{a popular}} beach and campgrounds in Northern Bay, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. In 1775, a ship {{supposedly}} crashed {{off the coast of}} the beach due to the Great Hurricane of 1775. Throughout the 19th and early 20th century the beach was used as a site for <b>gutting,</b> cleaning <b>and</b> <b>salting</b> fish in the small-boat cod fishery. After Confederation, the beach became a provincial park.|$|R
50|$|Around camp {{there are}} also a couple old outhouses, a {{handmade}} windlass, boat skids, the remains of a pier, handmade fish boxes, a net reel, a net fork, tarring tank, <b>gutting</b> board, <b>and</b> <b>salt</b> barrels. These remnants of the fishing industry remain where they were used and left. That they were not cleaned up and redeveloped like the valuable land around most docks is what makes Manitou Camp unique in the area.|$|R
50|$|A {{traditional}} {{method of}} processing and preserving anchovies is to <b>gut</b> <b>and</b> <b>salt</b> them in brine, {{allow them to}} mature, and then pack them in oil or salt. This results in a characteristic strong flavor and the flesh turns deep grey. Pickled in vinegar, as with Spanish boquerones, anchovies are milder and the flesh retains a white color. In Roman times, anchovies were the base for the fermented fish sauce garum. Garum had a sufficiently long shelf life for long-distance commerce, and was produced in industrial quantities. Anchovies were also eaten raw as an aphrodisiac. Today, they are used in small quantities to flavor many dishes. Because of the strong flavor, they are also an ingredient in several sauces and condiments, including Worcestershire sauce, Caesar salad dressing, remoulade, Gentleman's Relish, many fish sauces, and in some versions of Café de Paris butter. For domestic use, anchovy fillets are packed in oil or salt in small tins or jars, sometimes rolled around capers. Anchovy paste is also available. Fishermen also use anchovies as bait for larger fish, such as tuna and sea bass.|$|R

With knives at the ready, they <b>gutted,</b> <b>salted,</b> <b>and</b> barreled the 'silver darlings', the bountiful herring that were destined for markets across the world. Echoing the journey of the herring lassies, the production took the story of three such women - Jean, Janet, and young Molly - back to the communities from which they sprang and gave members of those communities the opportunity to create and participate in a piece of theatre alongside a professional production team...|$|R
40|$|Harvesting and {{processing}} of holothurians (sea cucumbers) in Fiji {{dates back to}} thousands of years. This study on harvesting {{and processing}} of holothurians was conducted in Fiji Islands. Data was collected through formal and informal interviews with fishers, marine product agents and through catch analysis by the fishers. The main targeted species in Fiji for harvest are Holothuria fuscogilva (White teatfish) and H. nobilis (Black teatfish). The rate at which harvesting sea cucumbers in Fiji is 5. 97 pieces per hour for individual collectors. From the interviews, {{it was determined that}} men were the major harvesters of sea cucumbers other than women and children. All accessible commercial sea cucumber species (18 species) were collected. Collection methods were by gleaning; free diving, scuba diving and the use of fishing gear such as “dri-bomb” to retrieve holothurians from the deep sea. Sea cucumbers were processed by <b>salting</b> <b>and</b> unsalting methods and involve first boiling, slitting <b>and</b> <b>gutting,</b> <b>salting</b> (agents only), second cook (agents only), smoke drying, third cook (agents only) and sun drying. This research raised issues of immediate awareness programs for fishers on proper harvesting, storage and better management of sea cucumbers in Fiji Islands...|$|R

25|$|Long term {{preservation}} of fish is accomplished {{in a variety}} of ways. The oldest and still most widely used techniques are drying <b>and</b> <b>salting.</b> Desiccation (complete drying) is commonly used to preserve fish such as cod. Partial drying <b>and</b> <b>salting</b> is popular for the {{preservation of}} fish like herring and mackerel. Fish such as salmon, tuna, and herring are cooked and canned. Most fish are filleted prior to canning, but some small fish (e.g. sardines) are only decapitated <b>and</b> <b>gutted</b> prior to canning.|$|R

40|$|In {{recent years}} our {{understanding}} of the control of ion and urea metabolism in elasmobranch fish has increased with many more species being investigated. This has demonstrated that some species regarded previously as stenohaline marine are, at least partially, euryhaline and may survive in environments less concentrated than full seawater. In elasmobranch fish the success of the osmotic strategy depends on retaining large concentrations of plasma urea in addition to relatively high, in comparison to most other vertebrates, plasma concentrations of sodium and chloride. The strategy therefore depends on the integrated control of hepatic urea production and branchial and renal urea excretion and also on a balance of salt input at the gills <b>and</b> <b>gut</b> with <b>salt</b> output at the gills, kidney and via the unique elasmobranch rectal gland. This integrated response is, at least in part, controlled by a series of osmoregulatory hormones and their possible role in the control of osmoregulatory organs will be discussed. In this presentation recent findings will be reviewed and the osmoregulatory strategies of a partially euryhaline species, Scyliorhinus canicula, with a fully euryhaline migratory species, Carcharhinus leucas, will be compared. This will allow new models for the control of ion and urea metabolism in elasmobranchs to be proposed for future research...|$|R
