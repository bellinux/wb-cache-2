This scheme is a policy instrument to advance <b>green</b> <b>projects.</b> The scheme relies on tax compensation for private investors who save or invest in green institutions below market returns. The green institutions select and monitor certified <b>green</b> <b>projects</b> and pass through part of the lower funding costs to investors. Certification of the <b>green</b> <b>projects</b> is based on environmental value-added and innovation. We provide a description of the characteristics of this incentive scheme and investigate the scheme's performance...|$|R

2500|$|By {{the summer}} of 1992, the team could {{demonstrate}} portions of the new platform, including the Green OS, the Oak language, the libraries, and the hardware. Their first demonstration, on September 3, 1992, focused on building a personal digital assistant (PDA) device named Star7 that had a graphical interface and a smart agent called [...] "Duke" [...] to assist the user. In November of that year, the <b>Green</b> <b>Project</b> was spun off to become Firstperson, a wholly owned subsidiary of Sun Microsystems, and the team relocated to Palo Alto, California. The Firstperson team {{had an interest in}} building highly interactive devices, and when Time Warner issued a request for proposal (RFP) for a set-top box, Firstperson changed their target and responded with a proposal for a set-top box platform. However, the cable industry felt that their platform gave too much control to the user, so Firstperson lost their bid to SGI. An additional deal with The 3DO Company for a set-top box also failed to materialize. Unable to generate interest within the television industry, the company was rolled back into Sun.|$|E

40|$|While urban alleyways {{have long}} been {{associated}} with blight and crime, recent urban greening efforts have reconceptualized alleys as sites for alternative transportation networks, stormwater treatment, habitat restoration, and neighborhood social life. However, {{little is known about}} how alley-adjacent residents perceive <b>greening</b> <b>projects</b> in these rather ambiguous spaces, though <b>greening</b> <b>projects</b> have the potential to both benefit and inconvenience residents in significant ways. Using a series of focus groups, this paper investigates the perceptions of alley-adjacent residents in low-income Los Angeles neighborhoods regarding residential alleys and possible greening measures. Results highlight the utilitarian relationship residents have with local alleys, and the apprehensions they have about these spaces. Findings inform a discussion on undertaking <b>greening</b> <b>projects</b> in quasi-public spaces that are important to residents 2 ̆ 7 daily lives...|$|R

40|$|There {{are many}} studies of {{contractor}} selection based on clients and {{the selection of}} suppliers by contractors. However, supplier selection specifically related to <b>green</b> construction <b>projects</b> has been much less studied. Green construction differs from conventional construction because of differences in its underlying principles and use of environmentally-friendly materials and technologies. This paper studies how procurers in contractor companies in Sweden adopt <b>green</b> <b>projects</b> and how contractor perception of supplier mastery of green knowledge affects supplier selection. The investigation {{is based on a}} set of semi-structured interviews conducted among three large contractors in Sweden. A main finding is that the perceived differences between <b>green</b> and conventional <b>projects</b> do not change supplier selection dramatically. An implication is that “greener projects” is a more appropriate denotation than “green project”. Evidence shows that suppliers’ green knowledge {{is an important factor in}} supplier selection, as respondents rated suppliers’ knowledge of <b>green</b> <b>projects</b> as very important, and to fix his, there was a consensus among respondents about the need for close collaboration between contractors and suppliers. To ensure knowledge acquisition from suppliers and to increase their competitive advantage over rivals, contractors collaborate with their suppliers in a partnering setting. It is anticipated that the results of this study will be used to fill the gap in the literature on supplier selection in <b>green</b> <b>projects</b> and can also be used for construction firms contemplating getting involved in <b>green</b> <b>projects...</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{construction}} {{industry has been}} increasingly adopting green building because of its advantages over conventional building. However, implementing successful <b>green</b> building <b>projects</b> entails difficulties in terms of cost performance. The objective {{of this study is}} to identify the critical factors that affect the cost performance of <b>green</b> building <b>projects</b> during their pre-project planning phase. This study validates the relationship between certain critical factors and the cost performance of <b>green</b> building <b>projects.</b> Support vector machine-recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE), a data mining-based feature selection method, is applied to a data set comprising 53 <b>green</b> building <b>projects.</b> The results of the study show that 10 out of 64 project definition rating index (PDRI) factors exert most of the influence on the cost performance of the <b>green</b> building <b>projects.</b> These results will help the <b>project</b> stakeholders deliver <b>green</b> building <b>projects</b> more successfully in terms of cost performance...|$|R
