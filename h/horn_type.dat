40|$|Abstract Gene {{frequencies}} of coat colour and <b>horn</b> <b>types</b> were assessed in 22 Nordic cattle breeds {{in a project}} aimed at establishing genetic profiles of the breeds under study. The coat colour loci yielding information on genetic variation were: extension, agouti, spotting, brindle, dun dilution and colour sided. The polled locus was assessed for two alleles. A profound variation between breeds was observed in the {{frequencies of}} both colour and horn alleles, with the older breeds generally showing greater variation in observed colour, <b>horn</b> <b>types</b> and segregating alleles than the modern breeds. The correspondence between the present genetic distance matrix and previous molecular marker distance matrices was low (r = 0. 08 – 0. 12). The branching pattern of a neighbour-joining tree disagreed to some extent with the molecular data structure. The current data indicates that 70 % of the total genetic variation {{could be explained by}} differences between the breeds, suggesting a much greater breed differentiation than typically found at protein and microsatellite loci. The marked differentiation of the cattle breeds and observed disagreements with the results from the previous molecular data in the topology of the phylogenetic trees are most likely a result of selection on phenotypic characters analysed in this study. </p...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{two different}} concepts {{for a computer}} aided design optimization of circular corrugated horms. Both methods combine a well proven analysis routine by Kuehn und Hombach (Ref. 1) based on mode matching techniques and a sequential quadratic programming (SQP) routine by Schittkowski (Ref. 2) for the minimization of non linear problems. Starting with an initial horn geometry each of the resulting computer algorithms synthesizes the geometry of the optimized horn design. Both methods are briefly discussed, and a classification of different <b>horn</b> <b>types</b> (i. e. axially or radially corrugated horms), for which the {{one or the other}} method should be selected, is given. Both methods have been successfully applied for the optimization of various corrugated <b>horn</b> <b>types</b> e. g. the feed horns of the two INTELSAT VIII Ku-Band Spot Beam Antennas, the INTELAST VIII C-Band Global Coverage Antennas, feed horns for DASA's compensated compact antenna test range, and feed horns for different Earth stations, taking into account mechanical and manufacturing aspects as additional optimization restrictions. A considerable reduction of time and man power for the horn optimization was achieved, and the resulting horn designs fulfilled the electrical and mechanical requirements with sufficient margin.

50|$|Antenna {{theory is}} based on {{classical}} electromagnetic theory as described by Maxwell's equations. Physically, an antenna is an arrangement {{of one or more}} conductors, usually called elements. An alternating current is created in the elements by applying a voltage at the antenna terminals, causing the elements to radiate an electromagnetic field. In reception, the reverse occurs: an electromagnetic field from another source induces an alternating current in the elements and a corresponding voltage at the antenna's terminals. Some receiving antennas (such as parabolic and <b>horn</b> <b>types)</b> incorporate shaped reflective surfaces to collect EM waves from free space and direct or focus them onto the actual conductive elements.|$|R

One such antenna that can be used with the TRC-97 is the MRT-2 parabolic tropospheric antenna, measuring 15 feet across, which is designed to cover distances of up to 160 km, or 96 miles. Another antenna was a simple feed <b>horn</b> <b>type</b> mounted on a 30 ft pole. The third is a set of 8 foot parabolic dishes on 15' masts (pictured in the photo). These antennas are transported on trailers and have to be manually erected every time they are used, so knowledge of mechanics as well as electronics was needed to erect and maintain that equipment. The system was powered by a 3-cylinder diesel or later by a turbine generator (TG). a typical crew would consist of 2 or three wideband (airforce) technicians and 1 power production (airforce) technician to service the generator set. two units could be used back to back to provide a relay capability for extra long haul traffic. this was usually done at the baseband level without need of any other equipment other than cables. it also could be remotely monitored from up to 2 miles away using the BZ109 test and monitor set. this was accomplished by connecting a single pair of field wires (common military phone line [...] ). th BZ109 would provide remote order wire, some basic measurements and alarm monitoring.|$|E

5000|$|Although {{forms of}} {{pre-packed}} paper cartridges {{go back to}} the Middle Ages, these were for several centuries made up by the shooter or a servant, rather than being mass-produced, requiring a container for the gunpowder, which came loose. Unlike modern cartridges, these were not inserted into the gun themselves, but were rather a pre-measured amount of powder stored in a paper wrapper, sometimes with the ball included as well. Loading the gun involved tearing open the package, emptying the powder into the muzzle and pan, inserting the ball with the paper doubling as wadding, and then ramming home the charge. This was somewhat faster and more convenient than measuring out a powder charge each time, especially in a combat situation. However, there was no large-scale manufacturing of these cartridges until the 19th century, and even then the benefits mostly lay with military use; the added cost made them less popular with civilian shooters until the advent of the self-contained metallic cartridge and the breech-loader. While loading a muzzleloader, an important safety concern was that when reloading a muzzle-loading gun soon after a shot there might be small pieces of wadding burning in the muzzle, which would cause the new load of powder to ignite as a flash. So long as no part of the loader faced the end of the barrel this was not likely to lead to serious injury, but if a spark reached the main supply in the powder flask a dangerous, even fatal, explosion was likely. General Sir James Pulteney, 7th Baronet, was one such victim; he died in 1811 from complications after losing an eye when a powder flask accidentally exploded in his face in Norfolk. Charles Kickham, prominent in the Irish Republican Brotherhood, grew up largely deaf and almost blind as the result of an explosion when he was 13, in about 1840. [...] Various precautions were taken in the design and use of powder flasks to prevent this from happening, and expensive examples from as early as the 16th century usually have springs to automatically close the dispensing spout (this is much less common with the cheaper <b>horn</b> <b>type).</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Both {{ornaments}} {{and weapons}} of sexual selection frequently exhibit prolific interspecific diversity of form. Yet, most studies of this diversity {{have focused on}} ornaments involved with female mate choice, {{rather than on the}} weapons of male competition. With few exceptions, the mechanisms of divergence in weapon morphology remain largely unexplored. Here, we characterize the evolutionary radiation of one type of weapon: beetle horns. We use partial sequences from four nuclear and three mitochondrial genes to develop a phylogenetic hypothesis for a worldwide sample of 48 species from the dung beetle genus Onthophagus (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae). We then use these data to test for multiple evolutionary origins of horns and to characterize the evolutionary radiation of horns. Although our limited sampling of one of the world’s most species-rich genera almost certainly underestimates the number of evolutionary events, our phylogeny reveals prolific evolutionary lability of these exaggerated sexually selected weapons (more than 25 separate gains and losses of five different <b>horn</b> <b>types).</b> We discuss these results {{in the context of the}} natural history of these beetles and explore ways that sexual selection and ecology may have interacted to generate this extraordinary diversity of weapon morphology.

50|$|The Scythian elite {{also used}} horn-shaped rhyta made entirely from {{precious}} metal. A notable {{example is the}} 5th century BC gold-and-silver rhython {{in the shape of}} a Pegasus which was found in 1982 in Ulyap, Adygea, now at the Museum of Oriental Art in Moscow.M.I. Maksimova (1956) in an archaeological survey of Scythian drinking horns distinguished two basic types (excluding vessels of clearly foreign origin), a strongly curved type, and a slender type with only slight curvature; the latter type was identified as based on aurochs horns by Maksimova (1956:221). This typology became standard in Soviet-era archaeology.There are a few artistic representation of Scythans actually drinking from horns from the rim (rather than from the horn's point as with rhyta). The oldest remains of drinking horns or rhyta known from Scythan burials are dated to the 7th century BC, reflecting Scythian contact with oriental culture during their raids of the Assyrian Empire at that time. After these early specimens, there is a gap with only sparse evidence of Scythian drinking horns during the 6th century. Drinking horns re-appear in the context of Pontic burials in the 5th century BC: these are the specimens classified as Scythian drinking horns by Maksimova (1956).The 5th-century BC practice of depositing drinking horns with precious metal fittings as grave goods for deceased warriors appears to originate in the Kuban region. In the 4th century BC, the practice spreads throughout the Pontic Steppe. Rhyta, mostly of Achaemenid or Thracian import, continue to be found in Scythian burials, but they are now clearly outnumbered by Scythian drinking horns proper. Around the midpoint of the 4th century BC, a new type of solid silver drinking horn with strong curvature appears. While the slightly curving <b>horn</b> <b>type</b> is found throughout the Pontic Steppe, specimens of the new type have not been found in the Kuban area.The custom of depositing drinking horns as grave goods begins to subside towards the end of the 4th century BC.The depiction of drinking horns on kurgan stelae appears to follow a slightly different chronology, with the earliest examples dated to the 6th century BC, and a steep increase in frequency during the 5th, but becoming rare by the 4th century (when actual deposits of drinking horns become most frequent). In the Crimean peninsula, such depictions appear somewhat later, from the 5th century BC, but then more frequently than elsewhere.|$|E

40|$|The {{evolution}} of male weaponry in animals {{is driven by}} sexual selection, which is predicted to reduce the genetic variability underlying such traits. Soay sheep have an inherited polymorphism for <b>horn</b> <b>type</b> in both sexes, with males presenting with either large, normal horns or small, deformed horns (scurs). In addition, there is additive genetic variation in horn length among males with normal horns. Given that scurred males cannot win conflicts with normal-horned males, it is unusual that genes conferring scurs should persist in the population. Identifying the genetic basis of these traits should help us in understanding their evolution. We developed microsatellite markers in a targeted region of the Soay sheep genome and refined {{the location of the}} Horns locus (Ho) to a similar to 7. 4 cM interval on chromosome 10 (LOD- 8. 78). We then located quantitative trait loci spanning a 34 cM interval with a peak centred close to Ho, which explained the majority of the genetic variation for horn length and base circumference in normal-horned males (LOD= 2. 51 and LOD= 1. 04, respectively). Therefore, the genetic variation in both <b>horn</b> <b>type</b> and horn length is attributable to the same chromosomal region. Understanding the maintenance of <b>horn</b> <b>type</b> and length variation will require an investigation of selection on genotypes that (co) determine both traits.
