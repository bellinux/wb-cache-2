40|$|AbstractWind {{turbines}} are {{a proven}} source of clean energy with wind power energy harvesting technologies supplying about 3 % of global electricity consumption. However {{there is an}} increasing demand on maintenance and operational improvements since turbines have been plagued with downtime problems of major components e. g. gearboxes and generators, especially with offshore turbines which are difficult to access. Reliability Centric Maintenance (RCM) {{is a way of}} capturing the potential causes of downtime and poor performance by preventing failures and having a proactive approach to operations and maintenance (O&M). However, for a large fleet of turbines, adopting the RCM approach becomes difficult due to the complexities that arise {{as a result of the}} interactions between individual elements that make up the system in the product lifecycle. This paper discusses how a systems thinking approach can be used to identify the relevant aspects and possible interactions between the RCM approach and wind turbine gearboxes and also how the gaps that exist within the system can be closed so as to add value to business.

40|$|Gears are {{important}} components in most power transmission mechanisms. Failures of gears can cause heavy losses in industry. Condition monitoring and fault diagnosis of gears is therefore important to improve safety {{and reliability of}} <b>gearbox</b> <b>operations</b> and reduce losses caused by gear failures. This research proposes a new diagnostic approach based on the statistical analysis of data. It investigates the use of Principal Components Analysis (PCA) to detect growing local faults in a two-stage industrial helical gearbox. In this research, the vibration signal is used to monitor fault conditions and a broken tooth is simulated as a local fault. Since the early detection of faults is a challenge, small fault conditions were tested first as well as severe fault conditions. In order to examine {{the ability of the}} PCA to detect fault conditions, first the PCA-based model was created for normal operating conditions. Any unexpected event such as a fault condition causes a significant deviation from the PCA model, which is obtained from the normal condition data of the gearbox. The Square Prediction Error (SPE) was calculated to detect the fault conditions. When the vibration signal from the gearbox is representative of normal operation, the value of the SPE shows very little fluctuation and remains under a certain threshold value. However, {{in the presence of the}} fault the SPE fluctuates considerably beyond the threshold value. It is shown that the PCA-based statistical approach cannot only be used to detect severe fault conditions, but that it also reveals small growing fault conditions at very early stage. The technique also provides information about the state of the fault such as the location of the fault as well as its severity...|$|R

40|$|The thermal {{regime of}} a gearbox is of {{considerable}} importance to its performance. Several significant gearbox parameters, {{such as the}} efficiency and fatigue life of its components, are temperature dependent. It is thus important {{to be able to}} determine the temperatures of the <b>gearbox</b> components during <b>operation,</b> but they are difficult to measure experimentally. A simulation model capable of predicting these temperatures would therefore be a valuable tool. The objective of this master’s thesis was to create a model capable of simulating the thermal regime of a truck <b>gearbox</b> during <b>operation.</b> To do this, mechanical losses in the gearbox, heat exchange with the surroundings, as well as heat transfer between components had to be accounted for. The model was created using the 1 D simulation software LMS Imagine. Lab Amesim 14. 0, and is based on a combination of mechanical and thermal networks. Details of the mechanical and thermal interactions between components are calculated using empirical and analytical formulas for mechanical losses and heat transfer. The result of the thesis is a model which can be used to simulate either real or idealised load cases, from which temperatures of gear wheels, shafts, bearings, housing and gearbox oil may be studied, as well as gearbox losses and heat transfer. Comparisons between simulated and measured gearbox efficiencies show good correlation. It is also shown that the model can predict oil temperatures which agree with in-vehicle measurements. Due to a lack of measurement data, most simulated component temperatures cannot be compared to measured values. However, temperature measurements performed for one of the gear wheels indicate that the model can be used to predict their temperature. In order to demonstrate the capabilities of the model, example results from both real and idealised load cases are presented. ...|$|R

40|$|The topic {{addressed}} in this PhD thesis {{is the development of}} a rotational Lumped Parameter model to analyze the dynamic behavior of planetary gearbox. This model allows the study of the gearbox torsional vibrations. In particular, the study carried out in this thesis has focused on simple planetary trains, with three planets and an the outer fix ring. Therefore the following five rotational degree of freedom have been taken into account: the sun rotation, the rotation of the three planets and the carrier rotation. In {{the first part of the}} work, the attention has been focused on a correct description of the gearbox geometry (especially on the toothed wheels geometry) and on the operating characteristics, such as pressure angles and center to center distance. The definition of the geometry was then used for the development of a complex finite element model that, combined with an analytical formulation, allows to obtain the meshing stiffness, depending on the operating conditions of the gearbox. This meshing stiffness was used in the lumped parameter model to define the meshing forces, formed from an elastic component and from a viscous damping component. In addition to the meshing forces, the lumped parameter model considers the inertial actions and the external actions given by the driving torque and the resistant torque. From the simulation results it is possible to analyze the instantaneous angular velocity, the instantaneous angular acceleration of all wheels in different operating conditions, the variation of the meshing stiffness and the forces variations during the <b>gearbox</b> <b>operations.</b> The model is ready for an extension to the translational degrees of freedom, for which the formulation has already been developed. After having developed the entire model, some experimental tests were carried out in order to acquire the torsional vibratory signals of the gearbox unit studied. The tests were performed at different rotational speeds and with different torques applied. The experimental signals obtained have been used to validate the theoretical model. Overall, the research activity is scientifically relevant because it allows, through the development of a lumped parameter model, the study of torsional vibrations of planetary gear units. The model includes the most relevant dynamic phenomena involved in the gearbox, thus allowing the evaluation of the forces that mainly determine the vibrational signature of the studied gearbox. For this reason, the model can be considered a useful tool to support the design and prototyping, as it allows to identify the causes of undesirable dynamic effects and allows to evaluate the effect of any design changes on the dynamic behavior of the gearbox...|$|R

Indeed, several algorithms are currently managed by the control units in passenger cars to deliver higher comfort level to vehicle users. One route to smoother longitudinal dynamics {{is provided by the}} engine torque limiters which set the maximum available torque for given operating points of the vehicle. The drawback of such filters is that they bring in time delays which may give to the driver the impression that the vehicle engine does not respond in a prompt way to her/his demand (Rakopoulos & Giakoumis, 2009). On the other hand, recent highly-supercharged engines suffer for inadequate engine torque rise when setting the vehicle in motion from stationary with fast accelerator request: this behaviour is related to fueling response, fuel-air ratio control, soot emissions regulation, etc. In this paper a high order dynamic model of the powertrain system which includes the electro-hydraulic actuator behaviour has been analysed to design a feedback controller based on multiple Model Predictive Controller (mMPC) to manage the clutch opening/closing and <b>gearbox</b> shifting <b>operations</b> in an automated manual transmission based on dry clutch architecture.

High speed variations of the shaft, i. e., tacho signal, have been extracted from the vibration signal of an accelerometer mounted on the casing of the gearbox. The epicyclic mesh frequency has been used to construct the speed reference by an enhanced order tracking technique comprising auto-adjustable phase demodulation (APD).

40|$|Condition {{monitoring}} is {{very important}} for critical assets such as gearboxes used in the power and mining industries. Fluctuating operating conditions are inevitable for wind turbines and mining machines such as bucket wheel excavators and draglines due to the continuous uctuating wind speeds and variations in ground properties, respectively. Many of the classical condition monitoring techniques have proven to be ine ective under uctuating operating conditions and therefore more sophisticated techniques have to be developed. However, many of the signal processing tools that are appropriate for uctuating operating conditions can be di cult to interpret, with the presence of incipient damage easily being overlooked. In this study, a cost-e ective diagnostic methodology is developed, using machine learning techniques, to diagnose the condition of the machine in the presence of uctuating operating conditions when only an acceleration signal, generated from a <b>gearbox</b> during normal <b>operation,</b> is available. The measured vibration signal is order tracked to preserve the angle-cyclostationary properties of the data. A robust tacholess order tracking methodology is proposed in this study using probabilistic approaches. The measured vibration signal is order tracked with the tacholess order tracking method (as opposed to computed order tracking), since this reduces the implementation and the running cost of the diagnostic methodology. Machine condition features, which are sensitive to changes in machine condition, are extracted from the order tracked vibration signal and processed. The machine condition features can be sensitive to operating condition changes as well. This makes it difficult to ascertain whether the changes in the machine condition features are due to changes in machine condition (i. e. a developing fault) or changes in operating conditions. This necessitates incorporating operating condition information into the diagnostic methodology to ensure that the inferred condition of the machine is not adversely a ected by the uctuating operating conditions. The operating conditions are not measured and therefore representative features are extracted and modelled with a hidden Markov model. The operating condition machine learning model aims to infer the operating condition state that was present during data acquisition from the operating condition features at each angle increment. The operating condition state information is used to optimise robust machine condition machine learning models, in the form of hidden Markov models. The information from the operating condition and machine condition models are combined using a probabilistic approach to generate a discrepancy signal. This discrepancy signal represents the deviation of the current features from the expected behaviour of the features of a gearbox in a healthy condition. A second synchronous averaging process, an automatic alarm threshold for fault detection, a gear-pinion discrepancy distribution and a healthy-damaged decomposition of the discrepancy signal are proposed to provide an intuitive and robust representation of the condition of the gearbox under uctuating operating conditions. This allows fault detection, localisation as well as trending to be performed on a <b>gearbox</b> during uctuating <b>operation</b> conditions. The proposed tacholess order tracking method is validated on seven datasets and the fault diagnostic methodology is validated on experimental as well as numerical data. Very promising results are obtained by the proposed tacholess order tracking method and by the diagnostic methodology. Dissertation (MEng) [...] University of Pretoria, 2017.

In any industry where robust machinery is required to handle large torques, hydraulic drive systems are applied. It is therefore almost the obvious solution for wind turbines. The main components of a fluid power drive train are (1) a positive displacement pump, which transforms the mechanical power of the aerodynamic rotor into a high pressure fluid flow, and (2) a hydraulic motor, which converts the hydraulic power back into mechanical power. The research presented in this thesis is centered around the questions of whether and how the application of fluid power technology is feasible {{as an alternative to}} currently applied drive train technologies for offshore wind turbines. The approach is to define several possible configurations of the fluid power transmission system. From these, a concept using seawater hydraulics for centralized electricity production within an offshore wind farm is subjected to further analysis. Through research, modelling and experiments, the feasibility of this concept, known as the Delft Offshore Turbine is analyzed. To make offshore wind a competitive source of electricity requires more than incrementally improving and scaling-up onshore turbines. The concept for power transmission as presented in this thesis is shown to be technically feasible and will significantly reduce the complexity of offshore wind energy technology. A way to further prove the functionality and demonstrate the possible use of such a drive train is by building and testing it, preferably in a real turbine, offshore.

40|$|LTDS and VIBRATEC {{founded the}} Labcom LADAGE (gears {{dynamics}} joint laboratory). One of its {{goals is to}} develop numerical methods and simulation tools for predicting gears dynamics, {{in order to take}} account of multiphysics couplings between internal and external excitations and to follow the evolution of industrial demand towards more and more complex systems. The operation of a combustion engine is such that it generates a cyclic disturbance of the circular motion of the gearbox primary shaft. Coupled with internal excitations, this disturbance can generate losses of contact at the loaded gear pair. Corresponding vibroimpacts regimes are responsible of the gearbox hammering noise. The irregular rotation of the motor is also sufficient for generating loss of contact of unloaded gears, such as idler gears of an automotive gearbox. Corresponding vibroimpacts regimes are responsible of the gearbox rattle noise. Two different approaches can be retained to describe the nonlinear dynamic behaviour of mechanisms with contact and backlash nonlinearities, depending on the intensity of the vibroimpact pulses and contact duration. Hammering noise For high level pulses, the contact duration of successive vibroimpacts is long. A nonlinear dynamic model is introduced, taking into account both the gear backlash and the contact stiffness nonlinearities. Solving the equations of motion requires the implementation of specific methods dedicated to nonlinear problems. For example, the finite difference method is used in order to obtain the periodic solutions. They are followed up according to a parameter control, thanks to a pseudoarc length continuation method. Indeed, this approach has proven very efficient for studying multifrequency excitations. A direct integration time method is also used in order to compare obtained results. Eigenvalues of the monodromy matrix inform us about their loss of local stability and {{about the nature of the}} bifurcations that occur. This first approach is well suited to characterize the hammering noise of a truck timing multistage gear. A large variety of dynamic behaviours have been identified. In addition to periodic responses, pseudoperiodic and chaotic ones are highlighted. Multiple impacts per period of excitation are observed. These nonlinear responses occur at resonances and instability regions. Then, the adding effect of the engine torque fluctuation is considered. The dynamic behaviour of the two-stage gear train becomes more complex. Vibroimpact regimes are observed over a wide range of operating conditions. Rattle noise A second approach is retained for low level pulses. The contact duration of successive vibroimpacts is very short. They are described in a more simple way, using a coefficient of restitution. The dynamic response of the system is built piecewisely by solving the equations of motion for the free flight periods. New initial conditions are introduced after each impact, derived from the dynamic response just before impact. This second approach is particularly well suited to characterize the rattle noise due to nonlinear dynamic behaviour of idle gears of an automotive gearbox. In addition to the gearbox design parameters and the engine operating conditions, the dynamic response of idle gears depends on the drag torque applied to the idle gear and the coefficient of restitution. They are identified experimentally through implementation of optical encoders in an actual automotive <b>gearbox</b> and the <b>operation</b> of a specific test bench which replicates the automotive power train. Models of the different drag torque sources are validated from analysis of the free damped response of the drivelines. The coefficient of restitution and its probability density function are measured from further experiments under stationary operating conditions. A nonlinear model of the dynamic response of idle gears is built. The key parameters are the dimensionless backlash, the coefficient of restitution and a dimensionless parameter proposed to describe the rattle excitation level. Periodic, pseudoperiodic and chaotic responses including impacts between active flanks and reverse flanks are observed. Experiments under controlled excitation are performed to validate the assumptions, to confirm the ability of the proposed parameter to describe the rattle noise threshold, and to characterize the dynamic behaviour of the idle gear. Predictions are fitted with the drag torque and coefficient of restitution previously identified. Comparisons with measurements demonstrate the ability of the model to predict gear rattle for any idle gear, any gearbox and any operating condition...|$|R
