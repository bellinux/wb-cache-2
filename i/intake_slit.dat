5000|$|... ===Facelift=== The C3 {{was given}} a minor {{redesign}} in October 2005, with the front end featuring a more imposing bumper, wider lower air intake, single air <b>intake</b> <b>slit</b> below the restyled radiator grille, and a re positioned number plate. The rear of the car was also given redesigned light clusters, with crystal coloured midsections.|$|E
50|$|The {{rebodied}} R20/R30 {{was introduced}} in January 1992 and produced until September 1996. For this series, the mechanicals were largely carried over (hence the retention of the R20/R30 chassis codes), but the styling fully refreshed. At this time, the LiteAce van became a derivative of the TownAce line, sharing the latter's body work. Thus, from this time, the entire LiteAce and TownAce range (van and truck) were unified. The rebodied R20/R30 had a much more streamlined design. The LiteAce and TownAce commercial vans were very similar, differing by the TownAce receiving extra headlamps adjacent inside to the main units and a small air <b>intake</b> <b>slit.</b> The LiteAce did not have this intake, but instead had additional grilles where the extra lamps in the TownAce were. Passenger wagons of both models had different styling again. Here, the LiteAce front end featured two separate headlamp units that tapered inwards towards the Toyota logo. TownAce wagons had headlamps that sat flush with a translucent garnish that gave {{the appearance of a}} large, single headlamp. Rear styling also differed between the commercial vans and passenger wagons, although both models used the same rear-end regardless if badged LiteAce or TownAce.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to decrease wave-making-resistance of ships. For this purpose, we sucked in water from <b>intake</b> <b>slits</b> which are installed at the prow near the water level and made to decrease prow-wave and we gushed out water sucked in from the prow, through discharge slits at the stern and made to decrease stern-wave. In this paper, we report experiment of stern-wave and it's experimental results...|$|R
40|$|We are {{decreasing}} wave making {{resistance of}} hydrojet boats． For this purpose，we suck in water from <b>intake</b> <b>slits</b> which are {{installed at the}} prow near the water level．By this improvement，we reduced the wave-standing at the prow. And also，we are reducing stern waves by means of water let through discharge slits at the stern from same ideas as at the prow． Experimental results shows that those improvements make much reductions of the ship resistance at the high speed...|$|R
