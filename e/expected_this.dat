5|$|A Warrior Who Fought Custer was {{published}} in April 1931 to mostly good reviews. However, W. J. Ghent, writing in the New York Times, criticized the claim made by Wooden Leg that many of Custer's men had committed suicide rather than face death {{at the hands of}} the Indians. Although sales of the Wooden Leg book did well, better than Marquis had <b>expected,</b> <b>this</b> controversy was to prove a hindrance to his chances of future book publications. Marquis believed he had multiple Indian sources verifying this account, and there were no surviving whites to contradict it. He planned to develop the idea more fully in a future book, eventually to become Keep the Last Bullet for Yourself.|$|E
5|$|A {{major part}} of modern weather {{forecasting}} is the severe weather alerts and advisories that the national weather services issue in the case that severe or hazardous weather is <b>expected.</b> <b>This</b> is done to protect life and property. Some {{of the most commonly}} known of severe weather advisories are the severe thunderstorm and tornado warning, as well as the severe thunderstorm and tornado watch. Other forms of these advisories include winter weather, high wind, flood, tropical cyclone, and fog. Severe weather advisories and alerts are broadcast through the media, including radio, using emergency systems as the Emergency Alert System, which break into regular programming.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the period, women had a very limited legal status. A married woman had few property rights and could not make a will without her husband's permission, although jurists <b>expected</b> <b>this</b> to be given. Men had considerable latitude in disciplining the women under their authority and although a handful of cases turn up in higher courts, and the kirk session did intervene to protect women from domestic abuse, it was usually only when the abuse began to disturb public order. The criminal courts refused to recognise women as witnesses, or as independent criminals, and responsibly for their actions was assumed to lie with their husbands, fathers and kin. As a result, a married woman could not sell property, sue in court or make contracts without her husband's permission.|$|E

5|$|Douglas-Home {{accepted}} the foreign affairs portfolio in Heath's shadow cabinet. Many <b>expected</b> <b>this</b> to be a short-lived appointment, {{a prelude to}} Douglas-Home's retirement from politics. It came at a difficult time in British foreign relations: events in the self-governing colony of Rhodesia (formerly Southern Rhodesia), which had been drifting towards crisis for some years, finally erupted into open rebellion against British sovereignty. The predominantly white minority government there opposed an immediate transfer to black majority rule before the colony had achieved sovereign statehood, and in November 1965 it unilaterally declared independence. Douglas-Home won the approval of left-wing Labour MPs such as Wedgwood Benn for his unwavering opposition to the rebel government, and for ignoring those on {{the right wing of}} the Conservative party who sympathised with the rebels on racial grounds.|$|E

They {{had decided to}} release the game as an ethically non-coercive free-to-play game, with a free base game and in-app purchases for the extended content. Not as many players paid for the content as <b>expected.</b> <b>This</b> was due, in part, to the players' difficulty in finding the purchase function. The game had been downloaded 200,000 times in its August 2012 launch week and was briefly ranked {{near the top of}} an iTunes top downloads ranking, though it did not break the top 200 grossing chart.|$|E

5|$|In January 1934, Germany {{signed a}} non-aggression pact with Poland, which {{disrupted}} the French network of anti-German alliances in Eastern Europe. In March 1939, Hitler demanded {{the return of}} the Free City of Danzig and the Polish Corridor, a strip of land that separated East Prussia from the rest of Germany. The British announced they would {{come to the aid of}} Poland if it was attacked. Hitler, believing the British would not actually take action, ordered an invasion plan should be readied for a target date of September 1939. On 23 May, Hitler described to his generals his overall plan of not only seizing the Polish Corridor but greatly expanding German territory eastward at the expense of Poland and he <b>expected</b> <b>this</b> time they would be met by force.|$|E
5|$|It {{continued}} to move along the Mexican coast bringing heavy rains. With continued strong convection, Henriette maintained its strengthening and was predicted to reach hurricane strength. However, despite the low wind shear and apparent warm waters. Henriette did not strengthen as <b>expected.</b> <b>This</b> {{is believed to}} be due to its proximity to land and colds waters being brought up due to Henriette's slow movement. The convection and strengthening continued and maintained itself as it moved away from Jalisco. Henriette turned westward and away from the Pacific coast of Mexico late on September 1 as the subtropical ridge built westward over northern Mexico.|$|E
5|$|Roosevelt {{had been}} {{surprised}} by {{the outcome of the}} Republican convention, having expected to oppose a conservative isolationist. The polls showed Willkie behind by only six points, and the president <b>expected</b> <b>this</b> to be a more difficult race than he had faced in his defeats of Hoover and Landon. Roosevelt felt that Willkie's nomination would remove the war issue from the campaign. Roosevelt was nominated by the Democratic convention in Chicago in July, though he stated that because of the world crisis, he would not actively campaign, leaving that to surrogates. The fact that both major-party presidential candidates favored intervention frustrated isolationists, who considered wooing Charles Lindbergh as a third party candidate.|$|E

5|$|The {{scientific}} {{results of}} the mission were mixed. The astronaut returned healthy after nine hours of confinement in a low-gravity environment. Observation of the Earth's surface proved unproductive, however, because of heavy cloud cover and bad photographic exposures. The public and political reaction was muted {{compared with that of}} earlier missions, as the Cuban Missile Crisis soon eclipsed the Space Race in the news. The mission was a technical success: all the engineering objectives were completed without significant malfunctions, and the spacecraft used even less fuel than <b>expected.</b> <b>This</b> confirmed the capabilities of the Mercury spacecraft and allowed NASA to plan with confidence for a day-long flight, MA-9, which had been an early goal of the Mercury program.|$|E
5|$|The wing {{hosted the}} Cape Cod Air Show & Open House, its last air show with the F-15C Eagle {{at the end}} of Air Force Week in August 2007. The wing shared a {{commonality}} with the 101st Air Refueling Wing, the 103d Fighter Wing, and the 104th Fighter Wing, which due to commission decisions, also changed the type of planes that they flew. Beginning in 2007, the F-15s began moving to Barnes Municipal Airport. With the grounding of the F-15 Eagles, the 158th Fighter Wing, which is based in Vermont took over the role of patrolling the Northeast's skies earlier than <b>expected.</b> <b>This</b> interruption of the F-15's flight, coinciding with the transitioning of the fighter jets to the 104th Fighter Wing, created some issues.|$|E
5|$|Through {{observation}} of the light curves of many Type Ia supernovae, {{it was discovered that}} they appear to have a common peak luminosity. By measuring the luminosity of these events, the distance to their host galaxy can be estimated with good accuracy. Thus this category of supernovae has become highly useful as a standard candle for measuring cosmic distances. In 1998, the High-Z Supernova Search and the Supernova Cosmology Project discovered that the most distant Type Ia supernovae appeared dimmer than <b>expected.</b> <b>This</b> has provided evidence that {{the expansion of the universe}} may be accelerating.|$|E

5|$|Dannatt left Northern Ireland {{ahead of}} the rest of the {{battalion}} and was posted to the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in Surrey, then under the command of Major (later General Sir) Rupert Smith, and <b>expected</b> <b>this</b> to be his last posting in the light of his stroke. He applied for a variety of jobs outside the Army but, after Smith's encouragement, sat the entrance exams for Staff College, Camberley, also in Surrey. He passed the entrance exams and turned down two civilian job offers to accept his place. Before Camberley, in late 1980, Dannatt was posted to Catterick Garrison, North Yorkshire, as a company commander. In early 1981, his company took over the running of HM Prison Frankland during a month-long strike by prison officers. Shortly after the end of the strike, he was posted to Cyprus with the United Nations peacekeeping force before returning to Surrey for the start of the one-year Command and Staff Course at Camberley. After completing the course, he was promoted to major on 30 September 1982, and appointed chief of staff to 20th Armoured Brigade, based in West Germany.|$|E
5|$|To predict if the {{production}} of mendelevium would be possible, the team made use of a rough calculation. The number of atoms that would be produced would be approximately equal to {{the product of the}} number of atoms of target material, the target's cross section, the ion beam intensity, and the time of bombardment; this last factor was related to the half-life of the product when bombarding for a time on the order of its half-life. This gave one atom per experiment. Thus under optimum conditions, the preparation of only one atom of element 101 per experiment could be <b>expected.</b> <b>This</b> calculation demonstrated that it was feasible {{to go ahead with the}} experiment. The target material, einsteinium-253, could be produced readily from irradiating plutonium: one year of irradiation would give a billion atoms, and its three-week half-life meant that the element 101 experiments could be conducted in one week after the produced einsteinium was separated and purified to make the target. However, it was necessary to upgrade the cyclotron to obtain the needed intensity of 1014 alpha particles per second; Seaborg applied for the necessary funds.|$|E
