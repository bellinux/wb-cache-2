25|$|Expiry (or Expiration in the U.S.) is {{the time}} and the day that a {{particular}} delivery month of a <b>futures</b> <b>contract</b> stops trading, as well as the final settlement price for that contract. For many equity index and Interest rate future contracts (as well as for most equity options), this happens on the third Friday of certain trading months. On this day the t+1 <b>futures</b> <b>contract</b> becomes the t <b>futures</b> <b>contract.</b> For example, for most CME and CBOT contracts, at the expiration of the December contract, the March futures become the nearest contract. This is an exciting time for arbitrage desks, which try to make quick profits during the short period (perhaps 30 minutes) during which the underlying cash price and the futures price sometimes struggle to converge. At this moment the futures and the underlying assets are extremely liquid and any disparity between an index and an underlying asset is quickly traded by arbitrageurs. At this moment also, the increase in volume is caused by traders rolling over positions to the next contract or, in the case of equity index futures, purchasing underlying components of those indexes to hedge against current index positions. On the expiry date, a European equity arbitrage trading desk in London or Frankfurt will see positions expire in as many as eight major markets almost every half an hour.|$|E
25|$|When the {{deliverable}} asset {{exists in}} plentiful supply, {{or may be}} freely created, then {{the price of a}} <b>futures</b> <b>contract</b> is determined via arbitrage arguments. This is typical for stock index futures, treasury bond futures, and futures on physical commodities when they are in supply (e.g. agricultural crops after the harvest). However, when the deliverable commodity is not in plentiful supply or when it does not yet exist - for example on crops before the harvest or on Eurodollar Futures or Federal funds rate futures (in which the supposed underlying instrument is to be created upon the delivery date) - the futures price cannot be fixed by arbitrage. In this scenario there is only one force setting the price, which is simple supply and demand for the asset in the future, as expressed by supply and demand for the <b>futures</b> <b>contract.</b>|$|E

40|$|Financial {{markets are}} like the mirror of mankind. It is not {{the fault of the}} mirror if it {{reflects}} our blemishes as clearly as our beauty. ” With the United States still attempting to recover from a financial crisis brought on, in part, by financial ingenuity and the relatively unforeseen risks emanating from “new” financial products, developing the idea of seafood <b>futures</b> <b>contracts</b> into another product that theoretically could cause market turmoil, may be met with a less than enthusiastic embrace. Although bowing to the urge to disregard the potential benefits for fear of the potential side effects might at first seem the prudent reaction, there are some considerable benefits to creating seafood <b>futures</b> <b>contracts.</b> Such contracts have the potential to influence an increase in seafood consumption and fishermen profitability, while enhancing market efficiency, decreasing waste, and limiting volatile price swings. With so much potential the question must be raised: “Why don’t seafood <b>futures</b> <b>contracts</b> already exist?” The answer is that they do exist, did exist, and, if the economic incentives are realized, could again exist in the United States in the near future.

40|$|In {{addition}} to interest in establishing local exchanges, there are growing interests in countries without futures markets to use established contracts on existing world exchanges.
