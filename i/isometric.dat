5|$|Isometrically {{scrolling}} shooters: A {{small number}} of scrolling shooters, such as Sega's Zaxxon, feature an <b>isometric</b> point of view.|$|E
5|$|Spindizzy is an <b>isometric</b> {{computer}} game released for several 8-bit home computer formats in 1986 by Electric Dreams Software. It features action and puzzle game elements. Players must navigate {{a series of}} screens to explore a landscape suspended in a dimensional space. Development was headed by Paul Shirley, who drew inspiration from Ultimate Play the Game games that feature an <b>isometric</b> projection.|$|E
5|$|The N-Gage {{version of}} X-Men Legends {{contains}} {{most of the}} features found on the console versions. However, {{the game is played}} from an <b>isometric</b> point of view. Characters are two-dimensional sprites based on their three-dimensional console counterparts, and levels are redesigned to meet the limitations of the <b>isometric</b> point of view. Cutscenes were reused from the console versions, but are rendered at a much lower frame rate. Players can link with other N-Gage systems for four-player cooperative gameplay using GSM cellular technology.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} idea was based around {{the premise of}} creating a town like those found in a role-playing game. The team chose the design elements of a fractured, floating world due to their wish to portray a sky in the game, which is usually not possible with an <b>isometric</b> camera, as it always points down. They also wanted to forgo a map system, and felt that having the ground {{come up to the}} Kid allowed the player to easily see without a map where they had already been in a level. The story of the Calamity was created as a way to explain this game mechanic. Jen Zee developed the art style of the game to express beauty in a post-apocalyptic landscape. The hand-painted style was intended to soften the sharpness she saw as typical in <b>isometric</b> games and the colorless, harsh depictions of most devastated landscapes. Zee was inspired by the pixel art landscapes of earlier Japanese <b>isometric</b> games.|$|E
5|$|A {{game called}} Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis was {{released}} {{around the same}} time for 8-bit home computers including the ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, and Commodore 64 home computers. Due to machine limitations, this was an <b>isometric</b> perspective game in which the player fought Nazi guards.|$|E
5|$|Blackwyche is an action-adventure {{video game}} {{developed}} {{and published by}} Ultimate Play the Game for the Commodore 64 in 1985. The game is the third instalment of the Pendragon series and is a sequel to Entombed. In the game, aristocrat adventurer Sir Arthur Pendragon is trapped on board a haunted galleon and must free the soul of its captain. The game is presented in a 3D <b>isometric</b> format.|$|E
5|$|Desert Strike is a shoot 'em up game {{in which}} the player pilots an AH-64 Apache helicopter. The game is less frantic than typical shoot 'em ups, with the {{addition}} of greater strategic elements. The action takes place on open, multi-directional scrolling levels viewed from an <b>isometric</b> perspective. The player views the action from outside the helicopter, rather than from within the cockpit.|$|E
5|$|In Tactics Advance, turn-based {{tactical}} battles {{take place}} on a three-dimensional <b>isometric</b> field. The player takes the role of Marche, a clan leader; he must organize the clan's members and advance their status through missions that are offered in pubs. The player competes against the computer's team in turn-based play, although unlike Final Fantasy Tactics characters execute their actions instantly.|$|E
5|$|Marble Madness is an <b>isometric</b> {{platform}} game {{in which}} the player manipulates an onscreen marble from a third-person perspective. The player controls the marble's movements with a trackball, though most home versions use game controllers with directional pads. The aim {{of the game is}} for the player to complete six maze-like, <b>isometric</b> race courses before a set amount of time expires. With the exception of the first race, any time left on the clock {{at the end of a}} race is carried over to the next one, and the player is granted a set amount of additional time as well. The game allows two players to compete against each other, awarding bonus points and extra time to the winner of each race; both players have separate clocks.|$|E
5|$|The game {{features}} flip-screen and <b>isometric</b> gameplay, {{in similar}} vein to its predecessors, Knight Lore and Alien 8. In addition, Nightshade features an enhanced {{version of the}} Ultimate Play the Game's Filmation game engine, branded Filmation II. The game received positive reviews upon release; critics praised its gameplay traits, graphics and colours, however one critic was divided over its perceived similarities to its predecessors.|$|E
5|$|While {{the console}} {{versions}} of the game are fully three-dimensional, the Game Boy Advance version is rendered in an <b>isometric</b> style that incorporates both 2D sprites and 3D models. This version is a more traditional Tony Hawk's game, with little attention given to story or customization. The mobile phone version is similarly restricted.|$|E
5|$|Alien 8 is an action-adventure {{video game}} {{developed}} {{and published by}} Ultimate Play the Game. It was released for the ZX Spectrum, BBC Micro, Amstrad CPC and MSX in 1985. The game is a spiritual successor to the best-selling Knight Lore, which was lauded by critics for its <b>isometric</b> graphics. In the game, the player takes control of a robot, Alien 8, {{whose job is to}} ensure that all of the cryogenically frozen passengers on board a starship remain viable during the ship's voyage.|$|E
5|$|Alienation is {{a shooter}} and {{role-playing}} video game developed by Housemarque {{and published by}} Sony Interactive Entertainment. It was released in April 2016 for PlayStation 4. The game is an <b>isometric</b> twin-stick shooter in which one to four players defend themselves against an alien invasion on Earth through increasingly-difficult levels. Players can choose one of three character classes, {{each with its own}} abilities. Players can upgrade their weapons with collectables, known as upgrade cores.|$|E
5|$|As {{with its}} spiritual predecessor, the {{environment}} of the game {{takes the form of a}} series of <b>isometric</b> flip-screen rooms (which trace the outline of a large starship). There are a total of 129 rooms and most are filled with various objects, such as moveable platforms, static hazards such as spikes and hostile aliens. As well as executing well-timed manoeuvres and jumps, the player is able to use starship props to block or defend themselves. Another feature is the use of remote controlled drones, which can be directed by Alien 8 into inaccessible or dangerous areas.|$|E
5|$|Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn is a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} developed by BioWare {{and published by}} Black Isle Studios. It is the sequel to Baldur's Gate (1998) and was released for Microsoft Windows in September 2000. Like Baldur's Gate, the game {{is set in the}} Forgotten Realms campaign setting and is based on the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd edition rule set. The game, which is powered by BioWare's Infinity Engine, uses an <b>isometric</b> perspective and pausable real-time gameplay. The player controls a party of up to six characters, one of whom is the player-created protagonist; and the others, certain characters from the game world.|$|E
5|$|Empires: Dawn of the Modern World is a {{real-time}} strategy (RTS) game {{in which}} the player guides a civilization through five historical periods, from the Middle Ages to World War II. As in many RTS titles, the player collects natural resources, erects buildings, and trains and maintains a military. Players use a mouse cursor interface (or hotkeys) to direct their units, which range from crossbowmen to King Tiger tanks. A three-dimensional (3D) camera system allows the player to view the action from any perspective, including <b>isometric</b> and first-person angles. A mini-map is included as well.|$|E
5|$|Entombed is an action-adventure {{video game}} {{developed}} {{and published by}} Ultimate Play the Game for the Commodore 64 in 1985. It is the second instalment of the Pendragon series and is a sequel to The Staff of Karnath. The game features series protagonist and aristocrat adventurer, Sir Arthur Pendragon, as he attempts to escape an ancient Egyptian tomb before all oxygen runs out. As with its predecessor, Entombed is presented in an <b>isometric</b> format.|$|E
5|$|Fallout 3 is {{an action}} {{role-playing}} open world video game developed by Bethesda Game Studios {{and published by}} Bethesda Softworks. The third major installment in the Fallout series, {{it is the first}} game to be created by Bethesda since it bought the franchise from Interplay Entertainment. The game marks a major shift in the series by using 3D graphics and real-time combat, replacing the 2D <b>isometric</b> graphics and turn-based combat of previous installments. It was released worldwide in October 2008 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the game}} was still marred by {{technical}} difficulties, so Bob Fitch completely redesigned the Warcraft II engine within two months to ensure {{that many of the}} features desired by the designers, such as the abilities for units to burrow and cloak, could be implemented. Later improvements to the game included pre-rendered sprites and backgrounds, constructed using 3D Studio Max. An <b>isometric</b> in-game view was also adopted, in contrast to Warcraft IIs 3/4s birdseye perspective. In addition, the game utilized high quality music, composed by Blizzard's resident composers, and professional voice actors were hired.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, Bethesda Softworks {{purchased}} the license {{to develop and}} publish Fallout 3, {{as well as an}} option to create two sequels, from Interplay Entertainment. Three years later they bought the Fallout intellectual property. Bethesda abandoned the original gameplay style of previous Fallout titles; instead of an <b>isometric</b> game with action point/turn-based combat, Bethesda's Fallout 3 was a fully 3D game with real-time combat as well as the action point-based V.A.T.S. system.|$|E
5|$|Knight Lore is a 1984 action-adventure game {{known for}} popularising <b>isometric</b> {{graphics}} in video games. The game {{was developed and}} published by Ultimate Play the Game and written by company founders Chris and Tim Stamper. In Knight Lore, the player character Sabreman has forty days to collect objects throughout a castle and brew a cure to his werewolf curse. Each castle room is depicted in monochrome on its own screen and consists of blocks to climb, obstacles to avoid, and puzzles to solve.|$|E
5|$|Obi-Wan's Adventures is an <b>isometric</b> action-adventure {{video game}} with side-scrolling sections. Set in the fictional Star Wars galaxy, the game {{takes place in}} a time when the fictional Galactic Republic is in {{imbalance}} {{as a result of the}} antagonistic Trade Federation and the evil Sith Lord's plans to take over. In the game, the player controls the Star Wars character Obi-Wan Kenobi, a young Jedi apprentice, during the events of the film Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace.|$|E
5|$|Oblivion can {{be played}} in either a first-or third-person view, except in the mobile phone version, in which the game can only be played in <b>isometric</b> projection. The player may change the level of {{difficulty}} at any time, thereby weakening opponents and increasing the chance of success for particular actions. The screen constantly presents a heads-up display, which provides information about the character's health, magicka, and fatigue, all of which can be increased by leveling up.|$|E
5|$|Soviet Strike is set {{after the}} {{disintegration}} of the Soviet Union, and takes place in a fictionalised Russia, Eastern Europe and around the Caspian Sea. The player pilots an Apache helicopter and battles with the forces of Shadowman, a renegade ex-Communist figure. Like its predecessors, the game features shooting action mixed with strategic management of fuel and ammunition, but has more authentic 3D graphics, as well as a modified overhead - as opposed to <b>isometric</b> - perspective. The game also features a more realistic enemy artificial intelligence and environment. Critics received the game positively, praising the graphics and full motion video, while commentary on the gameplay and difficulty was more mixed.|$|E
5|$|Specific {{treatment}} for some symptoms may be required. One {{of the most}} important treatments is the control of agitation due to the extreme possibility of injury to the person themselves or caregivers, benzodiazepines should be administered at first sign of this. Physical restraints are not recommended for agitation or delirium as they may contribute to mortality by enforcing <b>isometric</b> muscle contractions that are associated with severe lactic acidosis and hyperthermia. If physical restraints are necessary for severe agitation they must be rapidly replaced with pharmacological sedation. The agitation can cause a large amount of muscle breakdown. This breakdown can cause severe damage to the kidneys through a condition called rhabdomyolysis.|$|E
5|$|The game is {{presented}} in a <b>isometric</b> format and is set inside an ancient Egyptian tomb. Sir Arthur Pendragon's main objective is to escape the tomb, the Great Sphinx, before all oxygen runs out. To achieve this end, the player must navigate a series of chambers linked by corridors, solve logic puzzles and deal with hostile enemies by either avoiding or fighting them. The tomb has seven floors. Pendragon's only form of defence is his whip, which he can utilise to defend himself from enemies. The player also has access to a torch, which {{will allow them to}} see in certain pitch-black areas of the tomb.|$|E
5|$|The game is {{presented}} in a <b>isometric</b> format and is set on board a haunted galleon named the Blackwyche. Sir Arthur Pendragon's main objective is to free the soul of its former captain, Richard Cavendish. Pendragon can utilise various weapons such as knives, daggers and a magic sword to defend himself from enemy skeletons. The player begins the game with full energy and it will slightly deplete every time the player is hit by an enemy. If Pendragon completely runs out of energy, a large skeletal hand will drag the player off-screen, thus killing him.|$|E
5|$|The game is {{presented}} in an <b>isometric</b> format and set in the fictional town of Black Rock. The player takes {{on the role of}} Sheriff Quickdraw, and the main objective of the game is to track down and kill a gang of outlaws who are hiding in the town. The game begins with a first-person perspective targeting minigame in which vertically scrolling bags of money can be shot at using crosshairs. Shooting the bags give the player initial sums of money which can be used to purchase ammunition.|$|E
5|$|The game is {{presented}} in an <b>isometric</b> format and set on board a starship. Taking {{on the role of}} the robot, Alien 8, the player must explore the large starship in order to ensure that the cryogenic life support systems preserving the biological crew are re-activated. The core of this system is a series of geometrically-shaped circuits. However, the circuits have been removed by the invading aliens and distributed around the starship. The main objective of the game is to collect the correct circuits and return them to their respective locations before the starship reaches its destination. The circuits are variously shaped as cubes, pyramids, domes or cylinders.|$|E
5|$|The game is {{presented}} in an <b>isometric</b> format. The player assumes {{the role of a}} knight who enters the plague-infested village of Nightshade to vanquish four demons who reside within. Additionally, all residents from the village have been transformed into vampires and other supernatural creatures. Contact with these monsters infects the knight, with repeated contact turning the character from white to yellow and then to green, which will lead to the character's death. The knight may be hit up to three times by an enemy, however the fourth hit will result in a life being deducted.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{developed}} with the <b>isometric</b> projection game engine known as Filmation II, {{which was used}} previously in Ultimate's 1985 ZX Spectrum game Nightshade. The Filmation engine {{was created by the}} Stamper brothers to portray 3D imagery. Filmation II used an image masking technique that drew and filled holes in the background, allowing the game to create composite structures out of pixelated drawings without visual overlay, despite the limitations platforms such as the ZX Spectrum offered.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} written by Chris Stamper, and {{graphics}} were designed by Tim Stamper. Alien 8 uses the same image masking technique as Knight Lore, which allows the developers to create composite structures out of stacked images without visual overlay. The technique was copyrighted by Ultimate as the Filmation game engine. As with its spiritual predecessor, the game is rendered <b>isometric</b> projection. The game was critically acclaimed upon release. Reviewers praised the game's graphics and innovation, however minor criticism was directed at its similarities to Knight Lore.|$|E
5|$|While it {{contains}} some small role-playing elements, Heroes of Mana diverges from the prior action role-playing game titles {{of the series}} to instead be a real-time strategy game. Composed {{of a series of}} strategic battles, the player gathers resources, constructs buildings and units, and fights enemy forces to achieve objectives on fixed <b>isometric</b> grid maps. The Nintendo DS's second screen displays a map of the ongoing battle, and buildings and units are constructed inside of the player's airship and dropped onto the map by the flying base. Players can fight several dozen required and optional battles in the single-player game, as well as local multiplayer matches.|$|E
5|$|A {{rehabilitation}} program often involves {{protection of the}} compromised articular surface and underlying subchondral bone combined with maintenance of strength and range of motion. Post-operative analgesics, namely a mix of opioids and NSAIDs, are usually required to control pain, inflammation and swelling. Straight leg raising and other <b>isometric</b> exercises are encouraged during the post-operative or immobilization period. A six to eight-week home or formal physical therapy program is usually instituted once the immobilization period has ended, incorporating range of motion, stretching, progressive strengthening, and functional or sport-specific training. During this time, patients are advised to avoid running and jumping, but are permitted to perform low impact activities, such as walking or swimming. If patients return to activity before the cartilage has become firm, they will typically complain of pain during maneuvers such as squatting or jumping.|$|E
5|$|Cobra Triangle is a 1989 racing, {{vehicular}} combat {{video game}} developed by Rare and released by Nintendo for the Nintendo Entertainment System. The player controls a weapon-equipped speedboat through 25 levels. Objectives include winning races, saving swimmers, and defusing bombs. The game also includes power-ups and is displayed from a 3D <b>isometric</b> perspective with automatic scrolling {{that follows the}} player's movement. The Stamper brothers designed the game and David Wise wrote its soundtrack. Computer and Video Games highly recommended the game and praised its graphics and gameplay. Later reviewers lauded its level diversity and noted its graphical similarities to previous Rare game R.C. Pro-Am. IGN and GamesRadar ranked Cobra Triangle among their top NES games. The latter considered Cobra Triangle emblematic of the NES era's aesthetic. It was also included in Rare's 2015 Xbox One retrospective compilation, Rare Replay.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, Ryan Schott {{and colleagues}} made a more {{comprehensive}} analysis of cranial dome ontogeny in S. validum. The {{study found that the}} parietosquamosal shelf conserved the arrangement of ornamentation throughout growth, and that vascularity of the frontoparietal domes decreased with size. It also found that dome shape and size was strongly correlated with growth, and that growth was allometric (in contrast to <b>isometric)</b> from flat to domed, supporting Ornatotholus as a juvenile Stegoceras. They also hypothesized that this model of dome growth, with dramatic changes from juvenile to adult, was the common developmental trajectory of pachycephalosaurs. These researchers noted that though Williamson and Carr's observation that the supratemporal fenestrae closed with age was generally correct, there was still a high degree of individual variation in the size of these fenestrae, regardless {{of the size of the}} frontoparietal, and this feature may therefore have been independent of ontogeny.|$|E
