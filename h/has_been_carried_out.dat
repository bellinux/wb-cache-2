Ocepeia fossils have been recovered from the Grand Daoui, Meraa El Arech, and Sidi Chennane quarries, with the latter bearing the most complete specimens.

In particular the warping of the receiver rails on the early-models was a defect that occurred in heavily used first-generation M249s. This defect however has been completely eliminated on later models {{and is no longer}} present on the current-issue M249, which has reinforced rails and full-length welding rather than spot welding. Also being worked on is replacement of the M249's buttstock with a redesigned adjustable stock.|$|E
5|$|First {{described}} in 1829, the species {{has long been}} prized as a table fish and is commonly sought by both recreational and commercial fishermen in New South Wales and Queensland. The sand whiting fishery is most prolific in southern Queensland and northern New South Wales where the species is most abundant, often caught along other species of whiting in estuaries and from beaches. Due to its importance as a commercial fish, substantial research <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> on the species, especially feasibility studies involving the use of sand whiting in aquaculture.|$|E
5|$|The {{extraction}} of peat from the Moors {{is known to}} have taken place during Roman times, and <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> since the Levels were first drained. The introduction of plastic packaging in the 1950s allowed the peat to be packed without rotting, which led to the industrialisation of peat extraction during the 1960s as a major market in horticultural peat was developed. The reduction in water levels that resulted put local ecosystems at risk; peat wastage in pasture fields was occurring at rates of 1–3feet (0.3–0.8m) over 100years. Peat extraction continues today, although much reduced.|$|E

5|$|Microgale macpheei {{is known}} {{only from the}} cave of Andrahomana. Its past {{presence}} there, {{like that of the}} extinct rodent Hypogeomys australis, suggests formerly more mesic (wet) conditions around the cave, which is currently in a dry area. In addition to M.macpheei, three other tenrecs have been described from subfossil material, but none are currently recognized as valid species; thus, M.macpheei is at present the only known Recently extinct tenrec species. However, there is a remnant patch of mesic forest near Andrahomana, where a population of M.macpheei may survive. Although no radiocarbon dating <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> on M.macpheei remains, bones of the rodent Macrotarsomys petteri from layers in the same cave deposit bracketing those where M.macpheei was found yield dates of around 2480 and 1760 Before Present.|$|E
5|$|Sociological {{reasoning}} pre-dates {{the foundation}} of the discipline. Social analysis has origins in the common stock of Western knowledge and philosophy, and <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> from {{as far back as the}} time of ancient Greek philosopher Plato, if not before. The origin of the survey, i.e., the collection of information from a sample of individuals, can be traced back to at least the Domesday Book in 1086, while ancient philosophers such as Confucius wrote on the importance of social roles. There is evidence of early sociology in medieval Arab writings. Some sources consider Ibn Khaldun, a 14th-century Arab Islamic scholar from North Africa (Tunisia), to have been the first sociologist and father of sociology (see Branches of the early Islamic philosophy); his Muqaddimah was perhaps the first work to advance social-scientific reasoning on social cohesion and social conflict.|$|E
