50|$|Polythionic acid is an oxoacid {{which has}} a {{straight}} chain of sulfur atoms and has the chemical formula H2SnO6 (n > 2). Trithionic acid (<b>H2S3O6),</b> tetrathionic acid (H2S4O6) are simple examples. The compounds of n < 80 are expected to exist, and those of n < 20 have already been synthesized. Dithionic acid (H2S2O6) {{does not belong to}} the polythionic acids due to strongly different properties.|$|E
