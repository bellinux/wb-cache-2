To answer this question, this project draws on four months of research in Turkey where interviews were conducted with prominent lawyers and activists as well as with gay men who personally experienced the inhumane exemption process of the Turkish military. This project first analyzes the historical reasons for the military’s pervasive influence in Turkish society. Next, it explores the many issues inherent in a policy of universal conscription without the right to conscientious objection. The project then focuses on the methods utilized from 1986 to the present to “prove” the sexuality of men in Turkey. These methods are based in Victorian pseudoscience, including invasive anal examinations, video or photographic evidence of sexual acts, video or photographic evidence of cross-dressing, the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, the House-Tree-Person Test, and mandatory family interviews. Each method is based on outdated gender roles, violates basic human rights, and wholly lacks validity in the capacity to determine sexual orientation.

40|$|Summary {{objective}} To {{identify the}} main drivers of costs of facility delivery {{and the financial}} consequences for households among rural women in Tanzania, {{a country with a}} policy of delivery fee <b>exemptions.</b> <b>methods</b> We selected a representative sample of households in a rural district in western Tanzania. Women who given birth within 5 years were asked about payments for doctor’s ⁄nurse’s fees, drugs, non-medical supplies, medical tests, maternity waiting home, transport and other expenses. Wealth was assessed using a household asset index. We estimated the proportion of women who cut down on spending or borrowed money ⁄ sold household items to pay for delivery in each wealth group. results In all, 73. 3 % of women with facility delivery reported having made out-of-pocket payments for delivery-related costs. The average cost was 6272 Tanzanian shillings (TZS), [95 % Confidence Interval (CI) : 4916, 7628] or 5. 0 United States dollars. Transport costs (53. 6 %) and provider fees (26. 6 %) were the largest cost components in government facilities. Deliveries in mission facilities were twice as expensive as those in government facilities. Nearly half (48. 3 %) of women reported cutting down on spending or borrowing money ⁄ selling household assets to pay for delivery, with the poor reporting this most frequently. conclusion Out-of-pocket payments for facility delivery were substantial and were driven by high transport costs, unofficial provider payments, and preference for mission facilities, which levy user charges. Novel approaches to financing maternal health services, such as subsidies for transport and care from private providers, are required to reduce the cost barriers to attended delivery...|$|R

In firms with many employees and various different projects, this assignment decision involves a complex optimization procedure.

Moreover, taxation can alter the assignment decision, especially if employees are sent abroad as expatriates so that international tax law {{has to be taken}} into account. To address these issues simultaneously, we combine a human resource assignment problem with a principal-agent problem of the LEN type. Both wage taxation at the agents' level and corporate taxation at the principal's level are integrated. We show that national tax rules as well as the methods for avoiding double taxation and the agents' tax characteristics are important determinants for international assignment decisions. The effects of tax rate variations can be ambiguous and depend on whether the <b>exemption</b> <b>method</b> or the credit method are applied, in particular if agents make differing choices of residence.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to analyze the content and {{organization}} of freshman composition curricula in Illinois public junior colleges during the school year, 1973 - 74. This study was a part of a larger investigation of English instruction in Illinois education [...] at elementary, junior high, high school, and college levels [...] sponsored by an articulation committee appointed by the Illinois Association of Teachers of English and the Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction. All five tracks of junior college composition (transfer, remedial, honors, vocational-technical, and adult) were investigated, and data were collected about English requirements for graduation, tracks of composition offered, placement and <b>exemption</b> <b>methods,</b> course syllabi, textbooks, course content, teaching methods, bases used for assigning final grades, and innovative content and methods. English department chairmen and composition instructors from 38 of the 47 public junior colleges participated by completing questionnaires. Additional information was collected from catalogs and freshman English course syllabi from those 38 junior colleges. The findings of the study revealed that tae most common organizational pattern was a three track system [...] transfer, remedial, and vocational [...] technical. Only a few junior colleges offered honorscomposition or adult composition. Some composition credit was required for various degree programs at most junior colleges; little or no composition was required for certificate programs. While most junior colleges had course syllabi for all tracks of composition and the instructors reportedly included the content items specified in the syllabi, the content of the various composition courses was much more diverse than the syllabi indicated. For each track of composition the instructors' questionnaires asked instructors to rate the relative importance of 46 separate content items divided into six general areas (composition study, language study, literature study, reading skills, oral skills, and study skills). Nearly all of the 46 separate items listed in the instructors' questionnaires were reportedly included in the various composition tracks at most junior colleges. While the ratings of the instructors revealed that the content of almost all composition courses was very diverse, the following items were of most importance: 1. In the first term transfer course [...] the writing of exposition, paragraphs, and thesis statements; the Study of usage; and the reading of essays. 2. In the second term transfer course [...] the writing of exposition, thesis statements, argumentation, outlines, and a research paper; and the reading and analysis of short stories, poems, and drama. 3. In the remedial courses [...] the study of usage and syntax; the writing of exposition, paragraphs, and thesis statements; and the study of vocabulary and reading comprehension. 4. In the first term honors course [...] the writing of exposition; the study of usage; the reading and discussion of essays; and the study of context analysis. 5. In the second term honors course [...] the writing of a research paper; the study of context analysis; and the reading and analysis of short stories, poems, and drama. 6. In the vocational-technical courses [...] the writing of business correspondence, technical reports and paragraphs; the study of usage; and the study of various oral skills. 7. In the adult course [...] the writing of exposition, narration, argumentation, and a research paper; and the study of usage. The bases used for assigning final grades in the various courses supported the instructors' emphasis on writing and, in a few cases, usage, but classroom attendance and participation were also important in the assignment of grades.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the history of}} marital rape and related topics in the United States within the broader context of women’s legal and political rights. The project demonstrates the interplay between women’s activists, legislators, the criminal justice system, and an involved public necessary to change both societal and legal views on spousal rape, and eventually its criminalization in all fifty states. ^ Chief Justice Matthew Hale first announced the legal impossibility of rape in marriage in a seventeenth-century treatise in which he established the irrevocable consent theory, which argued that men had an absolute right to sexual relations within the bonds of marriage, and provided {{the foundation for a}} marital rape exemption. While modern case law and legal commentary questioned the veracity of Hale’s presumption, it remained the basis for successful arguments against spousal rape laws for centuries in both Great Britain and the United States. ^ Concentrating on approaches to criminalizing marital rape in three of the fifty states, this dissertation provides a reasonable representation of the existence of the marital rape exemption in America, arguments used to maintain the <b>exemption,</b> and various <b>methods</b> used to end this form of gendered violence and gender discrimination accepted in this country until the 1970 s. It explores key issues relevant to the social and legal history of spousal rape in the United States: the rise of domestic violence and sexual assault movements that began in the late 1970 s and the promulgation of rape shield laws, which provided evidentiary protections for rape victims during trial. ^ Ultimately, this project demonstrates several of the important victories that women made in areas of personal autonomy over their bodies, which led to the criminalization of rape in marriage. Over the course of nearly one hundred and fifty years, social and legal attitudes toward spousal rape – actually, sexual assault in general – resulted in greater legal protection for the rights of married women. The elimination of the marital rape exemption, better trained law enforcement, increased services provided by advocates, and a more informed public all contributed to increased visibility about the existence of marital rape and active responses to that crime. ...|$|R
40|$|Countries seeking {{membership}} in the European Union (EU) cannot look to the EU for a blueprint for reforming their system for taxing capital income. Indeed, {{it is hard to}} generalize about tax systems in the EU. Most member states apply fairly low tax rates to interest payments and discriminate against profit distributions. But tax rates, <b>exemption</b> levels, and <b>methods</b> of tax integration differ greatly within and across countries, and there is almost no harmonization of methods for taxing capital income. Approaches to taxing capital gains vary greatly, and distortions arise from the treatment of various sources of capital income. In 1993, when the EU began efforts to integrate capital markets, member countries proposed various ways to harmonize capital income taxes, including a proposal to introduce a withholding tax on interest income of residents of member states, with a minimum rate of 15 percent (revised to 10 percent). Under this scheme all interest on bank deposits and government and private bonds would be taxed and there might also be a final withholding tax on residents interest income. But the proposal was not accepted and the EU Commission decided to maintain the status quo, not to pressure member countries to harmonize company taxes. But Hungary could look for models in the Nordic countries (especially Norway and Sweden), Austria, and Finland, which have undertaken far-reaching reforms of capital income taxation. In most EU countries capital gains are either not (directly) taxed or are not taxed systematically. In Finland and Norway identical tax rates are applied to all types of capital income, including capital gains. The centerpiece of the"Scandinavian model"is a dual income tax, combining a progressive tax on personal income with a flat-rate tax on all types of capital income. The"Scandinavian model"contrasts sharply with the"comprehensive income taxation"model, under which a single (progressive) tax schedule is applied to income from all sources. In Austria the treatment of different types of capital income is relatively uniform but the composite tax burden on capital income resembles the highest personal income tax rate rather than a reduced rate. Austria's rate of tax evasion was high, but a 10 percent withholdingtax applied to all interest-bearing assets has reduced discrimination against honest taxpayers.

40|$|The {{allocation}} {{of the profits}} of multi-national groups between their member companies for tax purposes has important impacts on both the corporate tax revenues {{of the countries in}} which these groups operate and the taxes paid by the groups.

30|$|The {{influence}} of wage tax regimes on pay-performance sensitivities {{is closely related}} to the wage tax effect on managerial effort. In the standard LEN model, the optimal pay-performance sensitivity is not affected by wage taxation when wage tax is modeled with a proportional tax rate. Ewert and Niemann (2012) show that this result carries over to an extended scenario with two periods and two action choices. However, if the wage tax burden is modeled as a function of gross pay with a progressive marginal tax rate, the optimal pay-performance sensitivity varies with the marginal wage tax rate. In this case, an increase in the marginal tax rate implies an increase in the pay-performance sensitivity (Brunello et al. 2011). Based on the tax-related results regarding pay-performance sensitivities in the LEN model, Martini and Niemann (2015) analyze the effects of taxation on a human resource assignment decision. In their model, the principal is faced with the decision to assign two agents to two jobs that are associated with a foreign subsidiary of a multinational enterprise. The authors show that the assignment decision depends on whether the credit or the <b>exemption</b> <b>method</b> is applied to eliminate double taxation. In the binary model of Halperin et al. (2001), both components of the manager’s compensation, variable and fixed salary, increase with the level of wage taxation. An increase in wage taxation forces the principal to provide higher total compensation to ensure that the manager accepts the contract. Niemann (2011) finds that this effect does not depend on whether profits and losses are taxed in the same way and shows that the wage tax penalizes performance-based contracts more heavily than fixed-salary schemes.|$|E
40|$|The European Union (EU) {{is built}} on the {{principle}} of freedom of establishment, meaning that companies have the possibility to establish themselves as a company or by setting up a secondary establishment in other Member States. This right has been confirmed by the European Court of Justice through case law. A basic feature in domestic tax legislation is that losses are allowed to be set off against profits when calculating the tax liability of a company. At the moment cross-border loss compensation within the EU is restricted, unfeasible or just accepted on a temporary basis. This lack of recognition of loss-offset gives the fact that double taxation may occur and claims form two or more national tax systems leads to uncertainty in the way a company will be taxed. Depending on whether the secondary establishment is a subsidiary or a branch, the rules relating to loss compensation differs. Taxation of secondary establishments is based {{on the principle of}} {{whether or not they are}} considered as a resident or a non-resident of the state. In regards to taxation of secondary establishments, the PE is considered to be a non-resident and a subsidiary considered to be a resident. However, the European Court of Justice approach of non discriminatory treatment and equal treatment that has been developed and seen in the history of case law leads to the question if the Marks & Spencer ruling that concerned secondary establishments in form of subsidiaries can be applied to permanent establishments. The most vital difference between a subsidiary and a permanent establishment is connected to the taxation of the two. The subsidiary is considered to become a resident of the establishing state while the permanent establishment is seen as a non-resident. This legal difference between the two leads to different treatment under tax law. Taxation under a tax treaty leads to the situation where one of the contracting states will either credit or exempt the income deriving from the permanent establishment. Permanent establishments are often taxed under the method of exemption. In the Marks & Spencer case it was held that losses and profits were two sides of the same coin. Applying this statement to permanent establishments gives the notion that if a contracting state exempts an income, there will be a set off of the symmetry of having losses and profits within the same tax system. This lead to the fact that if applying the Marks & Spencer ruling on permanent establishments that are taxed under the <b>exemption</b> <b>method,</b> allowing terminal losses to be taken into account at the head office will set off the symmetry. Therefore it can be considered as the Marks & Spencer ruling shall not apply to permanent establishments...|$|E
