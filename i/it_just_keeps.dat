There may be times when it becomes too self-indulgent for its own good, but Nevill concocts a unique, paranoid vision of dystopian drama that’s nigh impossible not to get sucked into." [...] Dirge Magazine also reviewed the novel, writing [...] "I highly recommend Lost Girl.

It wasn't intentional -- though I'm a big Moorcock fan -- but the way it worked out as I was thinking these things through is that heaven winds up being sort of like Ultimate Law in Moorcock's version of things, {{which is something that}} doesn't change. It's very static. It's all about the same frequency of reward and existence, and <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>keeps</b> going {{on and on and on}} and on. Hell is much more dynamic...the main character's presumption is that hell has to be varied, otherwise punishment is no longer effective, because it becomes familiar. So hell has to be something where your punishment surprises you, and part of your punishment is that there is no getting used to things because you never know what will happen next. That's a very simplified version, but that's one of the main differences. So hell is quite dynamic and changing. It's very feudal. It's very much about 'whoever has the power makes the rules.' In heaven that's true also, but you don't know who made the rules. The rules have all been made and they're not changing." ...|$|E
