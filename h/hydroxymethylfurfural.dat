40|$|Liège syrup is a Belgian {{traditional}} cooked fruit foodstuff, produced {{mainly from}} apples and pears.

At the end of the process, <b>hydroxymethylfurfural</b> had totally disappeared and the deep brown color of the product suggested that this compound was transformed into melanoidins. A parallel increase in antioxidant capacity was also observed. To determine optimal conditions to reach high melanoidin content and high antioxidant capacity, different in vitro model systems were compared. It was shown that different combinations of an amino acid with glucose or fructose led to different levels of hydroxymethyfurfural, of melanoidins and antioxidant capacity. After heating of apple or pear puree, an increase of the antioxidant capacity and the <b>hydroxymethylfurfural</b> and melanoidin contents was observed when the heating time was doubled.
