50|$|Built with juniper logs {{upright in}} the ground, the corrals of the trading post held lambs and sheep {{purchased}} from Navajo stockmen by Mr. Hubbell. The flocks {{stayed in the}} corral complex until they could be herded to the railroad. From time to time Mr. Hubbell kept beef cattle as well. Mr. Hubbell homesteaded 160 acre before {{they were part of}} the reservation and territory. When the reservation expanded, it surrounded the Hubbell property. Through an act of Congress Mr. Hubbell got permission to keep his home. Freight wagons brought supplies fifty-six miles to the store from the little railroad town of Gallup, New Mexico, two to four days' travel in good weather. Going back to Gallup, <b>freight</b> <b>wagons</b> <b>hauled</b> huge sacks of wool.|$|E
2500|$|At Pokegama the {{components}} were loaded onto <b>freight</b> <b>wagons,</b> and <b>hauled</b> overland to Keno, Oregon. [...] Keno {{was on the}} Klamath River, downstream from Lake Ewauna. [...] Once at Keno, the steamer’s components were taken by water transport upriver to Lake Ewauna, on which the city of Klamath Falls was located, and where the boat would be assembled.|$|R
50|$|String rail {{transport}} uses special light-weight railcars and multiple units with traction motors for both passenger and freight transportation. Freight transport also uses <b>freight</b> <b>wagons</b> without motors <b>hauled</b> with locomotives or traction rope. All rolling stock have individual suspension for each wheel with side anti-derailment small wheels like a monorail rolling stock.|$|R
50|$|Geilenkirchen {{station has}} three {{platform}} tracks for passengers. All tracks {{are used by}} scheduled trains. Two Euregiobahn services terminate and reverse at platform track 3 on weekday mornings. Furthermore, there is a siding for WestEnergie und Verkehr GmbH (the municipal electrical and transport company of the Heinsberg district). <b>Freight</b> <b>wagons,</b> mostly <b>hauled</b> to the siding by locomotives of class 294, are regularly unloaded there. During construction on the line the siding is also used by work trains, such as during the works {{in relation to the}} connections to the electronic interlocking in Grevenbroich in October 2007.|$|R
2500|$|After the 1870s, stagecoaches {{provided}} the primary form of local passenger and mail transportation between inland towns {{that were not}} connected to a railroad, with sailing ships and paddle wheel steamships connecting port cities. <b>Freight</b> <b>wagons</b> still <b>hauled</b> nearly all cargo. Even when railroads arrived, stages were essential to link more remote areas to the railheads. Top of the line in quality, with crowded discomfort, was the nine-passenger Concord stagecoach, but the cheaper, rougher [...] "mud wagons" [...] were also in general use. The Wells Fargo company contracted with independent lines to deliver its express packages and transport gold bullion and coins. Stagecoach travel was usually uncomfortable as passengers were often crowded together in limited space, dust pouring through open windows from rough unpaved roads, rough rides, un-bathed fellow passengers and poorly sprung steel tired stagecoaches. Some drivers were famous for their skill in driving six horses down winding roads at top speed, fortunately only rarely overturning. Rate competition from competing stage lines reduced fares to as little a two cents per mile on some routes—a $1.00/day was then a common wage. Bandits found robbing coaches a profitable if risky venture {{as they may be}} shot or hanged if caught. U.S. government mail subsidies provided essential base income for many stage lines, but running a stage line was often a financially unstable business enterprise.|$|R
5000|$|Even larger <b>freight</b> <b>wagons</b> existed. For instance, the [...] "twenty-mule team" [...] <b>wagons,</b> {{used for}} <b>hauling</b> borax from Death Valley, could haul 36 ST per pair. The wagons’ bodies were 16 ft long and 6 ft deep; {{the rear wheels}} were 7 ft in diameter.|$|R
50|$|During the 2000s CBRail {{continued}} {{to expand its}} fleet, including <b>freight</b> <b>wagons</b> in its portfolio; by June 2008, the company had 118 locomotives, 785 <b>freight</b> <b>wagons</b> and 103 passenger vehicles either on lease or under construction.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a virtual <b>freight</b> <b>wagon</b> vehicle using virtual prototyping computer tools. The <b>freight</b> <b>wagon</b> considered as open type wagon “BOXN 25 ” of the Indian Railways. The <b>freight</b> <b>wagon</b> vehicle comprises of car body structure and two bogies. Solidworks is used for modeling the <b>freight</b> <b>wagon</b> and the geometry is exported to finite element tool, ANSYS. A multi degree of freedom system has been reviewed and compared with system having infinite degree of freedom (continuous structure). The current problem falls in the category of large models (Block Lanczos Algorithm is used) and has high degrees of freedom (PCG Solver is used). The structural dynamic response for the virtual <b>freight</b> <b>wagon</b> is determined. It is seen that the car body deformation is influenced by its elastic underframe and sidewalls. The influence of vibration modes, which describe local deflection, on the comfort level and stability of laden goods is discussed. Mode shapes up to a frequency of 30 Hz are considered...|$|R

There are described conditions for rail vehicles approval and mainly load cases which every bogie must meet for commissioning. The next part deals with computer modelling and analyses of a frame of this modified <b>freight</b> <b>wagon</b> bogie. It was analysed using the FE method and calculations were focused on the assessment of stresses of the frame structure under exceptional load.

50|$|Before the {{construction}} of the Cariboo <b>Wagon</b> Road, people <b>hauled</b> their own supplies to Barkerville, either on their backs or in a pack train. Because supplies were scarce, the prices of even the most everyday items were extremely high. High prices for goods in Barkerville did not ease up until the Cariboo Road had been finished, when goods could be transported by huge <b>freight</b> <b>wagons.</b> Soon, movers of freight boasted that they could pack and carry a set of champagne glasses without any breakage - for a price, of course. More women came to Barkerville after {{the construction}} of the Cariboo Road.|$|R
