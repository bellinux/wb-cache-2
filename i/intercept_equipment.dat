5|$|Admiral Scheer sailed in October 1940 on {{her first}} combat sortie. On the night of 31 October she slipped through the Denmark Strait and broke into the open Atlantic. Her B-Dienst radio <b>intercept</b> <b>equipment</b> {{identified}} the convoy HX-84, sailing from Halifax, Nova Scotia. Admiral Scheers Arado seaplanes located the convoy on 5 November 1940, The armed merchant cruiser , the sole escort for the convoy, issued {{a report of the}} German raider and attempted to prevent her from attacking the convoy. The convoy was ordered to scatter under cover of a smoke screen. Admiral Scheers first salvo scored hits on Jervis Bay, disabling her wireless equipment and steering gear. Shells from her second salvo struck the bridge and killed her commander, Edward Fegen VC. Admiral Scheer quickly sank Jervis Bay, but the delay allowed the majority of the convoy to escape. The Admiral Scheer sank only five of the convoy's 37 ships, though a sixth was sunk by the Luftwaffe following the convoy's dispersal.|$|E

"The {{presentation}} of ambassadorial credentials to the Shah {{was a rather}} formal undertaking," [...] reads a photograph caption in Helms' memoirs, which shows him in formal attire, standing before the Shah who is dressed in military uniform. Yet already Helms enjoyed an elite student experience which he shared with the Shah: circa 1930, both had attended Le Rosey, a French-language prep school in Switzerland. Decades later the CIA station chief in Iran first introduced Helms to the Shah. Helms was there about an installation to spy on the Soviets.

2500|$|On {{the basis}} of the few {{publicly}} available photographs of the RQ-170, aviation expert Bill Sweetman has assessed that the UAV is equipped with an electro-optical/infrared sensor and possibly an active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar mounted in its belly fairing. He has also speculated that the two undercarriage fairings over the UAV's wings may house datalinks and that the belly fairing could be designed for modular payloads, allowing the UAV to be used for strike missions and/or electronic warfare. The New York Times has reported that the RQ-170 is [...] "almost certainly" [...] equipped with communications <b>intercept</b> <b>equipment</b> as well as highly sensitive sensors capable of detecting very small amounts of radioactive isotopes and chemicals which may indicate the existence of nuclear weapons facilities.|$|E

50|$|In September 2012, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates confiscated various {{equipment}} {{headed to}} Iran {{which may have}} been sought for the Iranian nuclear program, including carbon fibre, which experts said would be vital if Iran wanted to develop more advanced nuclear enrichment centrifuge technology. In addition, diplomats said that the UAE reported to the 1737 Committee that the UAE had <b>intercepted</b> suspicious <b>equipment</b> headed to Iran about 15 times in three years.|$|R
50|$|Referat III: This section had two tasks. The {{first was}} engaged in {{supplying}} the KONA signal intelligence regiments with the necessary <b>intercept</b> <b>equipment</b> and in maintaining a workshop to service {{the needs of the}} GdNA HQ itself.|$|E
50|$|According to the Wall Street Journal, the FBI and NSA {{arranged}} with Qwest Communications to use <b>intercept</b> <b>equipment</b> {{for a period}} of less than six months {{around the time of the}} 2002 Winter Olympics. The agencies monitored the content of all email and text communications in the Salt Lake City area.|$|E
5000|$|There was 100 to 150 sets at the Templin and Luebben {{station and}} from 20 to 30 at Cologne, Konstanz, Eutin, and Gols. Traffic was {{forwarded}} by cipher teleprinter, i.e. the T52c, T52d or T52e.

50|$|As {{a result}} of the Korean War, in December 1951 Fifth Air Force {{determined}} a need for additional nighttime all-weather air interceptors in the Seoul area. In response, Air Defense Command provided the 319th FIS, which was reassigned from Moses Lake AFB, Washington, to Suwon Air Base, South Korea in February and early March 1952. Until November 1952, Fifth Air Force restricted the use of the Starfires to local air defense in order to prevent the possible compromise of its airborne <b>intercept</b> radar <b>equipment</b> in a loss over enemy-held territory. From November until the Armistice Agreement of 1953, the 319th used F-94s to maintain fighter screens between the Yalu and Chongchon Rivers in North Korea, helping to protect Boeing B-29 Superfortress bombers from enemy interceptors.|$|R
50|$|In 1957, the Alert Wireless Station was {{conceived}} as an intercept facility to be jointly staffed by personnel from the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) and the RCAF. Five additional buildings were constructed: a mess, three barracks/accommodations buildings, and a power house and vehicle maintenance building, {{in addition to}} the existing operations building, built in 1956. The operations building housed the radio <b>intercept</b> and cryptographic <b>equipment.</b> Up to 24 men would be posted to Alert at any one time. Alert was considered (and remains to this day) a hardship assignment, with no spouses being permitted. Until 1980 only men were permitted to deploy to Alert.|$|R
50|$|All {{of these}} {{services}} also had capabilities to provide national-level intelligence more appropriate for NSA's mission than for support to military operation. The Army had both fixed and mobile <b>intercept</b> <b>equipment</b> appropriate for long-term listening to ground stations, while the Air Force and Navy could probe new foreign electronic systems as part of national-level intelligence goals.|$|E
50|$|In 1979 Pye were {{implicated in}} {{an episode of}} Granada's World In Action in {{relation}} to the sale of UHF and VHF radios as well as telephone <b>intercept</b> <b>equipment</b> which was used by the Ugandan Public Safety Unit, the secret police of Idi Amin's rule responsible for killing perhaps several hundred thousand Ugandans. Pye had been supplying Uganda through Wilken Telecommunications, its East Africa distributor.|$|E
50|$|In October 2011, a {{squadron}} of USAF F-15E was deployed to the base and have flown numerous combat missions into Yemen in support of both Yemeni government forces and unilateral strikes directed by JSOC and the CIA targeting cells. Along with the UAV's and F-15E's, surveillance flights are conducted by Air Force Special Operations Command U-28As, that are outfitted with sophisticated signals <b>intercept</b> <b>equipment</b> and optical sensors, which can provide real-time intelligence for ground operators.|$|E
5000|$|As the {{deadline}} draws near, Arnold gets a mysterious {{phone call from}} [...] "Deep Voice" [...] (a [...] "Deep Throat"-esq character), who informs Arnold that Scheck is lying and the document is in his office safe. Arnold and Gerald manage to steal {{the key to the}} safe from Scheck's assistant, Nick Vermicelli. Nick later notices the missing key, and informs Scheck. Meanwhile, Phil and the boarders try to devise a backup in case Arnold fails. The plan is to wire the storm drain tunnels beneath their street with dynamite to <b>intercept</b> FTI's construction <b>equipment.</b> Big Bob later teams up with them after discovering Nick's contract states Scheck will control 51% of his company and swindle him as a result.|$|R
25|$|Chan {{decided that}} his {{best chance to}} {{recapture}} the Panguna mine was with the Sandline mercenaries, and a contract was signed in January 1997. However, news of his intention to hire mercenaries was leaked to the Australian press, and international condemnation followed. Although initially supportive, {{the commander of the}} PNGDF, Jerry Singirok, then opposed the plan, and ordered all the mercenaries to be detained on arrival. In the resulting saga Papua New Guinea came close to a military coup, with the parliament surrounded by demonstrators and many military personnel. The Australian government placed pressure on PNG to terminate the contract with Sandline, and <b>intercepted</b> the heavy <b>equipment</b> that was being flown-in for the mercenaries. Chan resigned and the mercenaries were removed from Papua New Guinean territory.|$|R

50|$|Educated at Abbotsholme, Gandy {{took two}} years of the Mathematical Tripos, at King's College, Cambridge, before enlisting for {{military}} service in 1940. During World War II he worked on radio <b>intercept</b> <b>equipment</b> at Hanslope Park, where Alan Turing was working on a speech encipherment project, and he became one of Turing's lifelong friends and associates. In 1946, he completed Part III of the Mathematical Tripos, then began studying for a PhD under Turing's supervision. He completed his thesis, On axiomatic systems in mathematics and theories in Physics, in 1952. He {{was a member of the}} Apostles.|$|E

5000|$|The actual {{interception}} {{of messages}} {{is probably not}} done by the CIA, but by NSA or possibly Service Cryptologic Elements (SCE): tactical SIGINT detachments attached to military tactical units. Important communications intercepts have been achieved, with the results clearly available to the CIA. There are cases, however, where a joint CIA-NSA organization places clandestine <b>intercept</b> <b>equipment.</b> The National Security Archive commented, [...] "In 1987, Deputy Director for Science and Technology Evan Hineman established... a new Office for Special Projects. Concerned not with satellites, but with emplaced sensors - sensors that could {{be placed in a}} fixed location to collect signals intelligence or measurement and signature intelligence (MASINT) about a specific target. Such sensors had been used to monitor Chinese missile tests, Soviet laser activity, military movements, and foreign nuclear programs. The office was established to bring together scientists from the DS&T’s Office of SIGINT Operations, who designed such systems, with operators from the Directorate of Operations, who were responsible for transporting the devices to their clandestine locations and installing them." ...|$|E
