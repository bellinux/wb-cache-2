5|$|The {{episode was}} pitched and written by John Swartzwelder. The writing staff {{had to find}} a new angle for Homer's weight problems, as the idea had been used several times before.

Mahone is offered his old job back with the FBI if he agrees to give them {{credible}} information that leads to proof of Michael's plans. Mahone gives up the blind spot in the cameras that Michael had found, which the FBI fixes and then demands more information from Mahone.

Mahone informs the FBI that Michael is going to parachute into the prison, and when a dummy is parachuted into the prison Michael has enough of a distraction to break Sara out. Once Sara has escaped safely, Mahone gives her and Lincoln a tape from Michael that explained why he sacrificed himself for Sara.|$|E

5|$|On October 8, 2012, {{the series}} was {{announced}} as ending with issue 300, following which a new title, Constantine started at the main imprint of DC comics. By 2013, Constantine was contacted by the Three Fates, who {{tell him that he}} will finally meet his end in five days. Having lived a good and adventurous life, he happily accepts his fate rather than trying to fight it like he always does. When the last day came, Constantine was ambushed and shot in his own home right in front of a horrified Epiphany. After he died, Epiphany and Finn had an affair as a way to comfort each other. John's ghost saw them having sex in a graveyard and seemed to give his blessing, making the fates decide that John wasn't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> to come back to life. Then, of course, he did. He contacted Epiphany and asked her to help resurrect him by making him cigarettes from his ashes, which, after he smoked them, made him corporeal again. Thinking to disappear and live happily ever after with Epiphany, they moved to a tiny house in Ireland, courtesy of Finn, that was totally off the grid and far removed from any apparent trouble, the last place anyone would think to look for John. That didn't last long, though, as John realized he can never run from his past.|$|E
5|$|Operation Abercrombie was {{a raid on}} the French {{coastal town}} of Hardelot. Only B and C Troops {{supported}} by detachments from the Royal Engineers and the Carleton and York Regiment of Canada participated. The raid was under the overall command of Lord Lovat, {{with the objective of}} capturing prisoners and causing as much damage as possible. For this raid they were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> a different system to cross the channel. Instead of using Infantry Landing Ships to cross the Channel they would be taken across on Motor Gun Boats towing Assault Landing Craft (LCA). The combined force left Dover on 19 April 1942. En route, one LCA sank with the loss of two commandos who were manning a Bren gun in the bow. The raid was called off and they returned to Dover. A replacement LCA was obtained and they returned to France on 21 April. This time the crossing was uneventful and the commandos made a successful landing. However, the two commando troops were discovered cutting the barbed wire beach obstacles and German machine guns opened fire. The raiders did carry out a reconnaissance of the area but were unable to capture any prisoners. The commandos returned without loss, but one man was wounded in the leg. The smaller Canadian detachment was unable to locate the target beach and returned to Britain. After the raid there was another change in command. Lieutenant Colonel Lister left to form No. 10 (Inter-Allied) Commando and Major Vaughan became the temporary commanding officer. Vaughan left shortly afterwards to take over command of the Commando Depot at Achnacarry and was succeeded by Lord Lovat with Major Derek Mills-Roberts becoming the 2IC.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{marked the}} return of Special Agent Monica Reyes, who was first {{introduced}} in the earlier season eight episode [...] "This is Not Happening". Although Reyes would later become Doggett's partner, the series attempted to differentiate the Doggett/Reyes relationship from the Mulder/Scully relationship. Robert Patrick later noted, [...] "We're not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> to duplicate , we're not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> to regenerate the magic chemistry."

500|$|Boyle {{acknowledged}} that the extravagance of the 2008 opening ceremony was an impossible act to follow — [...] "you can't get bigger than Beijing" [...] — and that this realisation had in fact liberated his team creatively. He said [...] "..obviously I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> and build on Beijing, because how could you? We can't, and you wouldn't want to, so we're {{going back to the}} beginning. We're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> and give the impression that we're rethinking and restarting, because they've (opening ceremonies) escalated since Los Angeles in 1984. They've tried to top themselves each time and you can't do that after Beijing." [...] Beijing's budget had been £65m, whereas London's final budget was £27m, which was twice the original provision. The London stadium had the same number of seats as Beijing's, but was half the size; this intimacy of scale meant that Boyle felt he could achieve something personal and connecting.|$|E
40|$|If {{somebody}} want {{to investigate}} stress and coping with stressful situations {{it is very}} important to take in account the time dimension or chronological order of stressful event an coping. According to traditional oppinion, stress must be appeared before or, at least, at the moment of coping appearance if we want to speak about coping process. In this paper, we argued about new conceptualization of stress and coping - preventive and proactive coping. Coping process could start even before stressful event occurred.
