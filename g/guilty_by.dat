5|$|Barcelona's Luis Suárez had {{previously}} been involved in two controversies with players in the Juventus squad: in 2012, he was found <b>guilty</b> <b>by</b> an FA commission of using racially insulting language towards Patrice Evra in a game between their respective former clubs Liverpool and Manchester United, and at the 2014 FIFA World Cup he escaped punishment for biting Chiellini but was punished retrospectively. Evra stated that he would shake Suárez's hand before the game, having refused to in a previous game.|$|E
5|$|In 1945, {{after the}} Soviets drove the Germans out of Poland, Dangić was {{captured}} by the Red Army and extradited to Yugoslavia's new Communist authorities. Accused of committing war crimes, he was immediately arrested and charged. Dangić was then tried, found <b>guilty</b> <b>by</b> a court in Sarajevo and sentenced to death. He was executed by firing squad on 22 August 1947. According to the indictment against Mihailović and others, Dangić was awarded the Order of the Star of Karađorđe by the Yugoslav government-in-exile {{on the recommendation of}} Mihailović.|$|E

5|$|Justice Stark then {{reviewed}} {{the evidence and}} advised the jury that in his opinion the weight of psychiatric evidence favoured the defence; however, he reminded them, {{it was up to}} them to decide. The jury retired at 16:30 on 20 January 1967 to make their decision, and returned to the courtroom shortly before 19:00 to give their verdict. They found Lamb to be not <b>guilty</b> <b>by</b> reason of insanity. Lamb showed no reaction when the verdict was read.|$|E
5|$|Kemper {{was indicted}} on eight counts of {{first degree murder}} on May 7, 1973. He was {{assigned}} the Chief Public Defender of Santa Cruz County, attorney Jim Jackson—who had defended John Linley Frazier and also been assigned to the Herbert Mullin case—but due to Kemper's explicit and detailed confession, his counsel's only option was to plead not <b>guilty</b> <b>by</b> reason of insanity to the charges. Kemper twice {{tried to commit suicide}} in custody, surviving both times. His trial went ahead on October 23, 1973.|$|E
5|$|Arafat was {{detained}} in Syria's Mezzeh Prison when a Palestinian Syrian Army officer, Yusef Urabi, was killed. Urabi had been chairing {{a meeting to}} ease tensions between Arafat and Palestinian Liberation Front leader Ahmed Jibril, but neither Arafat nor Jibril attended, delegating representatives to attend on their behalf. Urabi was killed during or after the meeting amid disputed circumstances. On the orders of Defense Minister Hafez al-Assad, {{a close friend of}} Urabi, Arafat was subsequently arrested, found <b>guilty</b> <b>by</b> a three-man jury and sentenced to death. However, he and his colleagues were pardoned by President Salah Jadid shortly after the verdict. The incident brought Assad and Arafat to unpleasant terms, which would surface later when Assad became President of Syria.|$|E

5|$|During {{the presidential}} {{referendum}} in Egypt, Nasser was re-elected {{to a second}} term as UAR president and took his oath on 25 March 1965. He was the only candidate for the position, with virtually all of his political opponents forbidden by law from running for office, and his fellow party members reduced to mere followers. That same year, Nasser had the Muslim Brotherhood chief ideologue Sayyed Qutb imprisoned. Qutb was charged and found <b>guilty</b> <b>by</b> the court of plotting to assassinate Nasser, and was executed in 1966. Beginning in 1966, as Egypt's economy slowed and government debt became increasingly burdensome, Nasser began to ease state control over the private sector, encouraging state-owned bank loans to private business and introducing incentives to increase exports. During the 60's, the Egyptian economy went from sluggishness to the verge of collapse, the society became less free, and Nasser's appeal waned considerably.|$|E
5|$|Gee (Yaphet Kotto) {{informs the}} detectives that Officer Thormann (Lee Tergesen) {{has been shot}} in the head, and he orders an {{immediate}} investigation. Lewis (Clark Johnson) and Crosetti (Jon Polito) arrive at the hospital to find the doctors working frantically on Thormann; Crosetti, a close friend of Thormann, becomes very emotional. Crosetti comforts Thormann's wife Eva (Edie Falco), but is privately told by Dr. Eli Devilbiss (Sean Whitesell) that Thormann may be blind or mentally disabled, even if he survives. Crosetti begs Gee to give him the case and, even though Gee believes he is too emotionally involved, he gives in when Crosetti tries to make him feel <b>guilty</b> <b>by</b> showing him his previous gunshot wounds. When an investigation at the crime scene turns up nothing, Lewis catches Crosetti praying with a rosary in the locker room. Crosetti convinces a skeptical Lewis to pray with him for help in the investigation.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, the University punished itself when {{it became}} {{apparent}} that its players were <b>guilty</b> <b>by</b> declaring itself ineligible for post season play immediately, returning post season play monetary rewards, vacating five seasons of games, removing commemorative banners, and placing itself on a two-year probation. The following year, the NCAA accepted these punishments, doubled both the probation period and the post-season ineligibility, penalized the school one scholarship for four seasons, and ordered disassociation from the four guilty players until 2012. The disasociation formally ended on May 8, 2013. The additional year of post-season ineligibility was overturned on appeal.|$|E
5|$|Between 1790 and 1797, only 143 or 147 {{criminal}} cases {{were brought in}} the circuit courts, and 56 of those cases were brought in the Pennsylvania circuit court concerning the Whiskey Rebellion. And, between 1790 and 1801, only 426 {{criminal cases}} were brought in all federal courts (the district courts and the circuit courts combined). Between 1801 and 1828, a total of 2,718 criminal indictments were returned in the circuit courts: 596 resulted in <b>guilty</b> verdicts <b>by</b> juries; 479, not <b>guilty</b> verdicts <b>by</b> juries; 902, nolle prosequi; and 741, other (either no disposition recorded, abated, quashed, discharged, discontinued, or prison break).|$|R

5|$|Most of the {{information}} available on the allegations was released (officially or unofficially) by the prosecution and unchallenged by Jackson. Jackson was largely portrayed as <b>guilty</b> <b>by</b> the media. The media bias {{was evident in the}} use of sensational headlines to draw in readers and viewers when the content itself did not support the headline, the purchasing of stories of his alleged criminal activity, the purchasing of confidential leaked material from the police investigation, deliberately using pictures of his appearance at its worst, using headlines that strongly implied his guilt, and a general lack of objectivity.|$|E
5|$|Munch (Richard Belzer) is {{reluctant}} {{to follow up on}} the case of murdered drug addict Jenny Goode, who was run over by a car. The case has been cold for three months, but he is made to feel <b>guilty</b> <b>by</b> his partner Bolander (Ned Beatty) into reexamining it. Munch makes no progress after speaking with the family and reexamining notes. Based on witness accounts of a man with long blond hair and a black car, Munch spends all night looking through suspect photos until he finds a man with a black car with front end damage and long black hair, but blond eyebrows. Munch and Bolander question him, believing the suspect (Joe Hansard) to have dyed his hair to change his appearance after killing the woman. He quickly confesses to having hit her accidentally while driving drunk.|$|E
5|$|No {{conclusive}} proof of wrongdoing {{has come to}} light, though other aspects of Norris's financial dealings unrelated to the promotion controversy have fuelled speculation on the matter; Norris resigned as chairman and left the club in 1929, having been found <b>guilty</b> <b>by</b> the Football Association of financial irregularities; he {{was found to have}} misused his expenses account, and to have pocketed the proceeds of the sale of the Arsenal team bus. Regardless of the circumstances of their promotion in 1919, Arsenal have remained in the top division since then, and as a result hold the English record for the longest unbroken stretch of top-flight football.|$|E

5|$|Oliver North and John Poindexter {{were indicted}} on {{multiple}} charges on March 16, 1988. North, indicted on 16 counts, was found <b>guilty</b> <b>by</b> {{a jury of}} three felony counts. The convictions were vacated on appeal {{on the grounds that}} North's Fifth Amendment rights may have been violated by the indirect use of his testimony to Congress, which had been given under a grant of immunity. In 1990, Poindexter was convicted on several felony counts of conspiracy, lying to Congress, obstruction of justice, and altering and destroying documents pertinent to the investigation. His convictions were also overturned on appeal on similar grounds. Arthur L. Liman served as chief counsel for the Senate during the Iran–Contra Scandal.|$|E

Subsequently, al-Jamri received two international awards; the CPJ International Press Freedom Award in 2011 and the Next Century Foundation's Peace Through Media Award in 2012. In September 2011, Al-Wasat won the UNICEF regional award for electronic media and in May 2012, it was ranked top in the Media Credibility Index ahead of Al Jazeera, BBC, Agence France-Presse {{and more than a dozen}} other media outlets.|$|E
5|$|The British {{sent the}} Mahdi's family to al-Shakaba on the Blue Nile in September 1898. The group {{included}} the Khalifa Muhammad Sharif, the Mahdi's cousin {{and one of}} his chosen successors. In 1899 the government heard rumors that the family group was advocating a Mahdist revival and dispatched a military force to al-Shakaba. One account says the force attacked the family and followers, firing on them at random. Abd al-Rahman was badly wounded and his two elder brothers were killed. Another account says Muhammad Sharif and the two elder sons of the Mahdi were arrested. There was a skirmish when an attempt was made to rescue them. Muhammad Sharif and the Mahdi's two sons were found <b>guilty</b> <b>by</b> a court martial trial and were shot.|$|E
