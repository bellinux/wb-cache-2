5|$|It {{happened}} {{on my last}} day in Hanoi. I was exhausted and an emotional wreck after the 2-week visit... The translator {{told me that the}} soldiers wanted to sing me a song. He translated as they sung. It was a song about the day 'Uncle Ho' declared their country's independence in Hanoi's Ba Dinh Square. I heard these words: 'All men are created equal; they are given certain rights; among these are life, Liberty and Happiness.' These are the words Ho pronounced at the historic ceremony. I began to cry and clap. 'These young men should not be our enemy. They celebrate the same words Americans do.' The soldiers asked me to sing for them in return... I memorized a song called 'Day Ma Di', written by anti-war South Vietnamese students. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> slaughtering it, but everyone seemed delighted that I was making the attempt. I finished. Everyone was laughing and clapping, including me... Here is my best, honest recollection of what happened: someone (I don't remember who) led me towards the gun, and I sat down, still laughing, still applauding. It all {{had nothing to do with}} where I was sitting. I hardly even thought about where I was sitting. The cameras flashed... It is possible that it was a set up, that the Vietnamese had it all planned. I will never know. But if they did I can't blame them. The buck stops here. If I was used, I allowed it to happen... a two-minute lapse of sanity that will haunt me forever... But the photo exists, delivering its message regardless of what I was doing or feeling. I carry this heavy in my heart. I have apologized numerous times for any pain I may have caused servicemen and their families because of this photograph. It was never my intention to cause harm.|$|E

[...] Regarding the rejected appeal, he claimed that the umpire [...] "had laid down to both coxes before the race {{that there was a}} way he wanted to conduct the race. [...] And then he did something completely different in the race." [...] Kennelly, the bowman, claimed he was [...] "100 per cent confident that if what happened didn't happen we would have won" [...] while Cambridge cox Kenelm Richardson stated [...] "The umpire was very good and told me to hold my line, so <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> exactly where I needed to be".|$|E
500|$|Barrymore's {{first film}} under the {{contract}} was The Sea Beast (1926), loosely based on the 1851 novel Moby-Dick, in which he played Captain Ahab Ceeley. This {{was one of the}} biggest money-makers of the year for Warner Bros. Although Barrymore wanted Astor to play the female lead, she was unavailable, and Dolores Costello was cast in her place. He later said that [...] "I fell in love with her instantly. This time <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> right", and the couple began an affair. Costello's father was angered by the relationship, but his complaints were ignored by both Costello and her mother: Costello's parents separated and were divorced as a result. The film was well received by critics, and Mordaunt Hall, the film critic of The New York Times, praised the [...] "energy, earnestness and virility" [...] Barrymore displayed in the role of Ceeley.|$|E

500|$|In {{contrast}} to his output the previous year, Cooper appeared in only one picture in 1937, Henry Hathaway's adventure film Souls at Sea. A critical and box-office failure, Cooper {{referred to it as}} his [...] "almost picture", saying, [...] "It was almost exciting, and almost interesting. And I was almost good." [...] In 1938, he appeared in Archie Mayo's biographical film The Adventures of Marco Polo. Plagued by production problems and a weak screenplay, the film became Goldwyn's biggest failure to that date, losing $700,000. During this period, Cooper turned down several important roles, including the role of Rhett Butler in Gone with the Wind. Cooper was producer David O. Selznick's first choice for the part. He made several overtures to the actor, but Cooper had doubts about the project, and did not feel suited to the role. Cooper later admitted, [...] "It {{was one of the best}} roles ever offered in Hollywood ... But I said no. I didn't see myself as quite that dashing, and later, when I saw Clark Gable play the role to perfection, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> right." ...|$|E
500|$|Cisneros {{was awarded}} a {{bachelor}} of arts degree from Loyola University Chicago in 1976, and received a master of fine arts degree from the Iowa Writers' Workshop at the University of Iowa in 1978. [...] It was while attending the Workshop that Cisneros discovered how the particular social position she occupied gave her writing a unique potential. She recalls being suddenly struck by the differences {{between her and her}} classmates: [...] "It wasn't as if I didn't know who I was. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a Mexican woman. But I didn't think it {{had anything to do with}} why I felt so much imbalance in my life, whereas it had everything to do with it! My race, my gender, and my class! And it didn't make sense until that moment, sitting in that seminar. That's when I decided I would write about something my classmates couldn't write about." [...] She cast aside her attempt to conform to American literary canons and adopted a writing style that was purposely opposite that of her classmates, realizing that instead of being something to be ashamed of, her own cultural environment was a source of inspiration. From then on, she would write of her [...] "neighbors, the people [...] saw, the poverty that the women had gone through." ...|$|E
500|$|On May 20, Cotto {{started working}} with Golden Boy Promotions to {{finalize}} a deal against Yoshihiro Kamegai (27-3-2, 24 KOs). Miguel Cotto Promotions Executive Hector Soto said a deal should be finalized in the coming week. On May 24, it was announced a deal was made for a fight between Cotto and Kamegai to take place on August 26, 2017 at the StubHub Center in Carson, California live on HBO. This would be Cotto's 23rd appearance on the network. It was confirmed that vacant WBO light middleweight championship would be at stake, the title was vacated by Canelo Álvarez, who moved up to middleweight. A day after signing a deal with Golden Boy, Cotto revealed that he would fight again on December 2, 2017. Cotto weighed 153.6 pounds for the fight with Kamegai coming in slightly heavier at 153.8 pounds. Cotto reiterated that he would retire on December 31, 2017. In front of 7,689 st the StubHub, Cotto defeated Kamegai via unanimous decision after 12 rounds to claim the vacant WBO light middleweight title and became a 6-time world champion. The three judges scored the fight 120-108, 119-109 and 118-110 all in favour of Cotto. Kamegai gave a good effort but fell short every time he would connect with a punch, Cotto would counter {{with a combination of}} his own. Cotto spent the early rounds backed against the ropes on the back foot and still managed to do some damage landing hooks to the head of Kamegai. After round 10, Cotto started boxing on the outside and decided to settle for a decision win, he explained in the post-fight, [...] "I think I did my best and I'm happy with my performance. (Kamegai) is a tough fighter. By the fifth or sixth round, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{not going to be able}} to stop him." [...] Cotto confirmed he would fight again in December, preferably the winner of Canelo-GGG.|$|E
