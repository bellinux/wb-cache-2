Five directors, five actors, five times five: she gets phone calls. A hundred movies in four months. She's not a fresh face any more. Her price slips and she stops getting phone calls. Then it's, 'Okay, will you do anal? Will you do gangbangs?' Then they're used up. They can't even <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>phone</b> <b>call.</b> The market forces of this industry use them up." ...|$|E
