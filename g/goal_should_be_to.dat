40|$|Fibrosis is {{a general}} {{complication}} in many diseases. It is the main complication during peritoneal dialysis (PD) treatment, a therapy for renal failure disease. Local inflammation and mesothelial to mesenchymal transition (MMT) are well known key phenomena in peritoneal damage during PD. New data suggest that, in the peritoneal cavity, inflammatory changes may be regulated {{at least in part}} by a delicate balance between T helper 17 and regulatory T cells. This paper briefly reviews the implication of the Th 17 /Treg-axis in fibrotic diseases. Moreover, it compares current evidences described in PD animal experimental models, indicating a loss of Th 17 /Treg balance (Th 17 predominance) leading to peritoneal damage during PD. In addition, considering the new clinical and animal experimental data, new therapeutic strategies to reduce the Th 17 response and increase the regulatory T response are proposed. Thus, future <b>goals</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> develop new clinical biomarkers to reverse this immune misbalance and reduce peritoneal fibrosis in PD...|$|R
