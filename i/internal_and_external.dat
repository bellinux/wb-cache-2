5|$|A {{distinct}} feature {{noted in}} the entire temple complex is the stucco style embellishments built with brick masonry and finished with plaster. The motifs crafted are of floral (lotuses) and geometric designs, on the walls, in the niches and on arches.

The profusion of paintings and images on the <b>internal</b> <b>and</b> <b>external</b> faces of the temple was considered an auspicious feature, instead of leaving the wall surfaces blank. However, the images and murals on the outer walls of the temple have since been demolished.|$|E

In order to participate, {{students}} must attend an IB school. IBDP students complete assessments in six subjects, one from each subject group, and three core requirements. Students are evaluated using both <b>internal</b> <b>and</b> <b>external</b> assessments, and courses finish with an externally assessed series of examinations, usually consisting of two or three timed written tests. Internal assessment varies by subject: there may be oral presentations, practical work, or written work. In most cases, these are initially graded by the classroom teacher, whose grades are then verified or modified, as necessary, by an appointed external moderator.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>Internals</b> <b>and</b> <b>externals</b> {{with differing}} {{self-esteem}} dispositions were administered {{a series of}} personality tests and subsequently provided with bogus reports by a clinical psychologist containing either positive or negative information about their personalities. Consistent with self-esteem theory, more low than high self-esteem internals showed willingness to undertake remedial behavior to solve their problems, while {{there were no differences}} in the behavior of high <b>and</b> low self-esteem <b>externals</b> under the same circumstances. A study by Phares, Ritchie, and Davis (1968) was conducted to assess the reactions of <b>internals</b> <b>and</b> <b>externals</b> to positive <b>and</b> negative informa-tion about their personalities. Internals are people who believe that! reinforcing events are contingent upon their own actions, while externals, are individuals who believe that their reinforcers are determined by out-side forces such as chance, fate, or powerful others.

5|$|Both <b>internal</b> <b>and</b> <b>external</b> signals {{can lead}} to the {{induction}} of apoptosis, or programmed cell death. The resulting deconstruction of cellular components is primarily carried out by specialized proteases known as caspases, but the proteasome also plays important and diverse roles in the apoptotic process. The involvement of the proteasome in this process is indicated by both the increase in protein ubiquitination, and of E1, E2, and E3 enzymes that is observed well in advance of apoptosis. During apoptosis, proteasomes localized to the nucleus have also been observed to translocate to outer membrane blebs characteristic of apoptosis.|$|E

Trematodes of the family Spirorchiidae inhabit tissues throughout {{the body of the}} loggerhead, including vital organs, such as the heart and the brain. Trematode infection can be highly debilitating. For example, inflammatory trematode lesions can cause endocarditis and neurological disease. A nematode, Angiostoma carettae, also infects loggerheads, causing histologic lesions in the respiratory tract.|$|E

They found F. obliqua to be most closely related to three species of the arid Northern Territory (F. platypoda, F. subpuberula and F. lilliputiana) and classified it in a new series Obliquae in the subsection Platypodeae. The species had remained a transitional rainforest species while its relatives radiated into dryer regions.|$|E

They classified these species in a new series Rubiginosae in the subsection Platypodeae. Relationships are unclear and it is uncertain into which direction the group radiated (into rainforest or into arid Australia).|$|E

5|$|Lipids are {{the most}} diverse group of biochemicals.

Lipids are usually defined as hydrophobic or amphipathic biological molecules but will dissolve in organic solvents such as benzene or chloroform. The fats are a large group of compounds that contain fatty acids and glycerol; a glycerol molecule attached to three fatty acid esters is called a triacylglyceride. Several variations on this basic structure exist, including alternate backbones such as sphingosine in the sphingolipids, and hydrophilic groups such as phosphate as in phospholipids. Steroids such as cholesterol are another major class of lipids.|$|E
