5|$|By September 2011, around 50 of {{the first}} 100 homes had been sold, with an {{additional}} 30 houses under construction. The largest building under construction, Cottesmore House, was completed in October 2011. The final <b>homes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Ickenham Park development were completed during 2013.

5|$|George Wimpey became Taylor Wimpey {{through a}} {{corporate}} merger and submitted an application in 2010 {{to build a}} further 15 <b>homes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> site. A report by the London Borough of Hillingdon's planning department rejected the proposal in December that year {{on the grounds that}} the site was already overdeveloped. Local residents had raised this concern in November that year, which the leader of the council explained was out of the council's control due to planning laws.|$|E

5|$|In 2004, Presentation College {{went into}} administration. It {{was taken over}} by the Society of Licensed Victuallers and renamed The Elvian School. The school closed in 2010. Following its closure, Taylor Wimpey applied to build 193 new <b>homes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> site, {{competing}} with a proposal by a community group (the West Reading Education Network) to reopen the site as a free school known as the WREN. The housing plan was rejected, but Taylor Wimpey then appealed to Reading Borough Council and submitted a revised plan for 120 homes, which left room for the school. The appeal was taken to the High Court, which ruled that the site should be used solely for education; the school opened for Year Seven pupils on 7 September 2015.|$|E
5|$|The Attack on Pearl Harbor and {{the entry}} of the United States into World War II stopped all work on the {{causeway}} {{and the development of}} Virginia Key. After the war, Crandon pushed on with the development project. He got financier Ed Ball to buy six million (U.S.) dollars worth of bonds financing construction of the causeway. The causeway was named for Eddie Rickenbacker, World War I flying ace, and {{founder and president of the}} Miami-based Eastern Air Lines. Starting in 1951, the Mackle Construction Company offered new <b>homes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> island for US$9,540, with just US$500 down. A U.S. Post Office contract branch was opened, the Community Church started holding services, and the Key Biscayne Elementary School opened in 1952.|$|E
5|$|The {{strong winds}} from Paka left around 1,500buildings {{destroyed}} on the island, of which 1,160 were single-family homes. A further 10,000buildings sustained damage to some degree, with 60% of the <b>homes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> island reporting major damage. In all, about 5,000people were left homeless {{due to the}} typhoon. Additionally, an estimated 30–40% of the public buildings received major damage. Buildings on the island made of reinforced concrete fared well, as opposed to light metal-frame structures, which {{more often than not}} were destroyed. Large tourist hotels near Hagåtña, on which Guam is dependent, received generally minor damage, such as broken windows and damaged power generators.|$|E

5|$|Across Oman, Phet's {{damage was}} {{estimated}} at over 300million rials (US$780million). Strong winds knocked down billboards, trees, and power lines, causing power outages. Water pipes and desalination plants were also damaged. Storm flooding washed away hundreds of cars, while also damaging roads and bridges. Nationwide, the cyclone wrecked thousands of <b>homes.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> offshore Masirah Island, Phet's storm surge damaged or wrecked some boats, while strong winds damaged tin roofs and satellite dishes. The roof and compound wall of a resort hotel were damaged. Across eastern and northern Oman, heavy rainfall from Phet flooded low-lying areas and produced landslides. The Royal Oman Police helped direct or traffic after many roads were inundated or blocked. The floodwaters entered homes in Al-Ghubra and Al Athaiba, {{as well as the}} Qurum market in Muscat. According to Oman's National Committee for Civil Defence, Phet killed 16people in the country, although the IMD reported the death toll at 24.|$|E
5|$|Early on {{the morning}} of October27 the Colombian Government issued a {{tropical}} storm warning for the islands of San Andrés and Providencia. Hours later, a hurricane watch was issued. By late morning, both advisories were replaced by a hurricane warning. The island did not have much time to prepare for Hurricane Beta, being struck only three days after its formation. Of its 5,000residents all stayed to weather the storm but, about 300 of them evacuated wooden <b>homes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> beach for sturdier brick shelters inland on the island's mountains. The neighbouring island of San Andrés initiated a moratorium on all outdoor activities as the storm's outer bands reached the island on October 29. Officials evacuated about 700 people, 500 tourists and 200 residents on San Andrés to temporary shelters. The Colombian Government provided 8tons (7.2tonnes) of food and emergency supplies, including 1,100 sheets, 300 hammocks, and 350 cooking kits to the island.|$|E
5|$|Five of the state's {{counties}} are wholly {{within the boundaries}} of sovereign Indian reservations. Because of the limitations of climate and land, and isolation from urban areas with more employment opportunities, living standards on many South Dakota reservations are often far below the national average; Ziebach County ranked as the poorest county in the nation in 2009. The unemployment rate in Fort Thompson, on the Crow Creek Reservation, is 70%, and 21% of households lack plumbing or basic kitchen appliances. A 1995 study by the U.S. Census Bureau found 58% of <b>homes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Pine Ridge Indian Reservation did not have a telephone. The reservations' isolation also inhibits their ability to generate revenue from gaming casinos, an avenue that has proved profitable for many tribes closer to urban centers.|$|E
50|$|<b>Home</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Range was {{scheduled}} for a 2003 release, while Brother Bear was originally slated for a spring 2004 release. However, Disney announced that Brother Bear would be released in fall 2003, while <b>Home</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Range was pushed back for a spring 2004 release. Contrary to speculation, news writer Jim Hill stated the release date switch was not because <b>Home</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Range was suffering from story rewrites, but to promote Brother Bear <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Platinum Edition VHS and DVD release of The Lion King.|$|R

5|$|During {{the worst}} of the storm, 5,800people were {{evacuated}} from shoreline areas of Kauai to temporary shelters. Strong waves sank or grounded several small vessels on the southwestern coast of Kauai, with 44 of the 45 boats at Port Allen being sunk. The worst of the damage from the hurricane occurred in Poipu, where the rough surf destroyed or severely damaged several exposed luxury hotels and condominiums. Elsewhere on the island, damage was greatest in areas where there was no protective barrier reef offshore. Several small aircraft were damaged at Lihue airport from the winds, including many overturned small planes. The winds destroyed several buildings across the island, including one of Kauai's oldest churches and a warehouse. Additionally, the winds destroyed the roof of a bank. Strong winds initially left the entire island of Kauai without power. Highway 56 {{on the east side of}} the island was obstructed by fallen telephone poles, forcing residents to drive on the unpaved, red dirt cane roads usually reserved for hauling sugar cane from the fields. Rising waters washed out multiple roads near the coastline. The strong winds destroyed nearly all papaya and banyan trees on the island. The hurricane destroyed or greatly damaged 1,907 <b>homes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> island and caused minor damage to 2,983 others, leaving one-eighth of the island's homes unlivable.|$|E
5|$|In July 1999, York's real {{property}} assets, including Bootham Crescent, {{were transferred to}} a holding company called Bootham Crescent Holdings (BCH) for £165,000. Chairman Douglas Craig put {{the ground and the}} club up for sale for £4.5million in December 2001. It was announced that the ground would close by 30 June 2002, and talks were held over a move to Huntington Stadium. In March 2002, the club was bought by John Batchelor; he said York could continue at Bootham Crescent until a new stadium was built, when in fact the previous 25-year lease was replaced with one that would expire in June 2003. Batchelor spoke of building a new stadium at Clifton Moor, and Persimmon, who held 10% of the shares in BCH, submitted planning applications for 93 <b>homes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> site of Bootham Crescent. In March 2003, York extended their lease of the ground to May 2004, and under the ownership of the Supporters' Trust proceeded with plans to move to Huntington Stadium. Planning problems arose with bringing the ground up to Football League standards, and the club preferred to stay at Bootham Crescent. York bought Bootham Crescent in February 2004, after a £2million loan from the Football Stadia Improvement Fund (FSIF) was secured.|$|E
