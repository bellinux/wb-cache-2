In view of the contribution of mechanized trawlers to the total marine fish production of India, {{an attempt was made}} to assess the input-output relationship in trawler operations at three major landing centres along the Kerala coast using the model Cobb-Douglas production function. The functional relationship indicated that there was ample scope to enhance the net profit of trawlers by increasing <b>fishing</b> <b>days</b> and area of operation at Neendakara and Munambam, whereas at Cochin Fisheries Harbour, the present operation is almost at the optimum level. At Neendakara landing centre, the <b>fishing</b> <b>days</b> in a year could be increased from the average level of 193 to 204 and in Munambam from 203 to 229 days to get the maximum profit. There is also a provision for increasing oil consumption in all three landing centers to achieve optimum level of utilisation. Even though the number of <b>days</b> <b>fished</b> in a year is not up to the optimum in all the major centers selected for the study, the existing socio-economic conflicts and inter-sectoral disputes should be addressed while increasing the number of <b>fishing</b> <b>days</b> of mechanized trawlers...|$|R

5000|$|Ross Tiger was {{the first}} of twelve new {{trawlers}} for one of Grimsby's most prolific trawler owners. She entered service fresh from the yards of Cochrane and Sons, Selby, Yorkshire {{to become part of the}} 'middle water' fleet for Ross Trawlers Ltd. The trawlers of the town took their crews away in what is recognised as 'the most dangerous job in the United Kingdom' and scoured the ocean floors for deep sea fish, with a particular focus on cod and haddock. Haddock, regarded as a cleaner fish by Grimbarians, was preferred locally although the rail links from the town allowed for Grimsby fish to supply the nation, particularly with links to the south and the great Billingsgate Fish Market of London. The Cod Wars spelt the end of the life of many Grimsby trawlers, though some were saved from the breakers' yard to become standby vessels used for offshore oil rigs. The Ross Tiger was among those fortunate few, changing hands in 1985. However, the aging vessels were soon to be redundant and Ross Tiger was looking at the breakers' yard or yet another change of hands. Once again, Ross Tiger proved lucky. She was purchased by a museum trust to become the star attraction of her home town's Fishing Heritage Centre, and restored to her <b>fishing</b> <b>day</b> glory. An article in the Grimsby Telegraph on 14 July 1992 quoted the local council as they made it clear that Ross Tiger [...] "will remain as a fitting monument to the people who sailed out of what was once known as the world's premier fishing port". Guided tours of the vessel show visitors the unique spaces aboard and demonstrate how various pieces of equipment aboard this traditional design of trawler were used.|$|E

40|$|Abstract – Even {{with the}} rapid changes {{in the level of}} {{complexity}} and the uncertainty of the environment in which Belgian sea fisheries operate, fisheries management in Belgium is still mainly based on restrictive policy instruments founded in the biological approach of fisheries management science. Since they will continue to play an important role, this paper evaluated changes in three restrictive policy instruments and their effect on future fleet performance and dynamics, i. e. maximum <b>fishing</b> <b>days,</b> total quota-restrictions and licences. These effects are tested through scenarios in a microeconomic simulation model, including sensitivity analysis. This study opts for a dynamic simulation model based on a microeconomic approach of fleet dynamics using system dynamics as a modelling technique (operational base: Vensimr©DSS). The results indicated that changes in maximum <b>fishing</b> <b>days</b> and total quota resulted in higher fluctuations in fleet performance and dynamics compared to changes in licences. Furthermore, changes in maximum <b>fishing</b> <b>days</b> and total quota had a direct impact on fleet performance, though not always as expected, whereas licences only affected fleet performance indirectly since they only limit the entry of new vessels to the fleet and they can block the growth of successful sub fleets. The outcomes of this study are translated into practical recommendations for improving fisheries management. Firstly, policy makers need to be more aware of misperceptions of feedback...|$|R
