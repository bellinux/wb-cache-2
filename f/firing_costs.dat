40|$|This paper {{studies the}} role of labor market {{institutions}} on unemployment and on the cyclical properties of job flows. We construct an intertemporal general equilib- rium model with search unemployment and endogenous job turnover, and examine the consequences of introducing an unemployment benefit, a <b>firing</b> <b>cost</b> and a downward wage rigidity. The model is able to reproduce the main cyclical properties of a typical European economy. It also suggests that downward wage rigidities, rather than unem- ployment benefit or <b>firing</b> <b>cost,</b> may well play a dominant role in explaining both the high unemployment rate and the cyclical properties of such an economy...|$|R

50|$|Whether EPL has {{any effect}} on {{unemployment}} {{is an issue of}} contention between economists. On the one hand, assuming that the cyclical wage pattern is not affected by mandated <b>firing</b> <b>costs,</b> EPL reduces the propensity to hire by employers, since they fear that such decisions will be difficult to reverse in the future, in case of a recession. On the other hand, EPL also leads firms during downswings to keep more workers employed, than they would have otherwise done. Therefore, EPL reduces both job creation and job destruction, so that the net effects on average employment and unemployment are not identifiable a priori. What is instead agreed among economists, is that more stringent EPL lowers the fluctuations in the quantity of labour demanded over the business cycle, leading to smoother dynamic patterns of those aggregates.|$|E
40|$|The model {{developed}} {{in this paper}} examines the relationship between <b>firing</b> <b>costs</b> and unemployment in a simple two-period model with uncertainty. Where there are long-term employment relationships, and where risk-averse workers and risk-neutral firms bargain over wages and <b>firing</b> <b>costs,</b> average unemployment {{is unlikely to be}} affected by statutory <b>firing</b> <b>costs,</b> although firms' profits will decline if the statutory level exceeds the bargained level. In a unionised sector with no bargaining over <b>firing</b> <b>costs,</b> the presence of statutory <b>firing</b> <b>costs</b> reduces employment distortions associated with trade unions. However, where there are no gains to employers to long-term labour relationships, the introduction of mandated <b>firing</b> <b>costs</b> will be associated with a higher incidence of temporary employment contracts and short-term jobs.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{specific}} effect that <b>firing</b> <b>costs</b> {{can have on}} firms facing liquidity constraints. When <b>firing</b> <b>costs</b> are zero and a time gap exists between production and its associated revenues, firing allows firms {{to hold on to}} their liquid assets by saving on wages, and thus, allows firms to cope better with liquidity shocks when external financing is too costly or unavailable. I refer to this feature as labor's liquidity service. Higher <b>firing</b> <b>costs</b> reduces the value of labor's liquidity service, and thus, increases firms' incentive for hoarding liquidity and reduces firms' demand for production inputs. In addition to this negative effect at the creation margin of production, <b>firing</b> <b>costs</b> have a relatively higher positive effect on the destruction margin of production of financially restricted firms. This paper presents a model that develops these ideas and shows that the presence of <b>firing</b> <b>costs</b> has a stronger negative effect on the output of firms facing liquidity constraints. Regression analysis, based on country-industry panel data sets, provides empirical evidence consistent with the liquidity service effect of <b>firing</b> <b>costs.</b> I find a relatively stronger negative effect of <b>firing</b> <b>costs</b> on the output of industries with higher liquidity requirements and a relatively stronger negative effect of <b>firing</b> <b>costs</b> on the output of small, and more likely financially constrained, firms. <b>Firing</b> <b>costs</b> Labor regulation Financial restrictions Liquidity constraints Small firms Labor policy...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we conduct an {{analysis}} of the effects of <b>firing</b> <b>costs</b> in models that consider simultaneously worker heterogeneity, imperfect information on their productivity and union power. We consider an OLG model where heterogeneous workers participate in the labour market both when young and old. Each generation of workers is represented by its own union. Unions set wages unilaterally taking into account firm behavior. Firms are atomistic and choose employment treating wages parametrically. There is imperfect information about worker productivity. We find that at given wages <b>firing</b> <b>costs</b> increase youth unemployment and decrease old age unemployment. However, once we take the wage response into account, we find that <b>firing</b> <b>costs</b> increase both youth and old age unemployment. This happens because unions react strategically, and respond to higher <b>firing</b> <b>costs.</b> Indeed, when <b>firing</b> <b>costs</b> increase, firms refrain from hiring youths since, if a young worker turns out to be inadequate, it will be more costly to fire him. The union, knowing this, reduces the wage of young workers in order to attempt to increase their employment prospects. However, despite this cut youth unemployment still increases with <b>firing</b> <b>costs.</b> In the second period, on the contrary, higher <b>firing</b> <b>costs</b> give the union more power. In fact, knowing that firms will be less likely to cut their labour force when <b>firing</b> <b>costs</b> are high, the union increases the wage of old workers, and, therefore, old age unemployment increases...|$|E

40|$|Job-to-job {{turnover}} {{provides a}} way for employers to escape statutory <b>firing</b> <b>costs,</b> as unprofitable workers may willfully quit their job on receiving an outside offer, thus sparing their incumbent employer the <b>firing</b> <b>costs.</b> Furthermore, employers can induce their unprofitable workers to accept outside job offers that they would otherwise reject by offering voluntary severance packages, which are less costly than the full statutory firing cost. We formalize those mechanisms within {{an extension of the}} Diamond-Mortensen-Pissarides (DMP) matching model that allows for employed job search and negotiation over severance packages. We find that, while essentially preserving most standard qualitative predictions of the DMP model without employed job search, our model explains why higher <b>firing</b> <b>costs</b> intensify job-to-job turnover at the expense of transitions out of unemployment. We further find that allowing for on-the-job search markedly changes the quantitative predictions of the DMP model regarding the impact of <b>firing</b> <b>costs</b> on unemployment and employment flows: ignoring on-the-job search leads one to strongly underestimate the negative impact of <b>firing</b> <b>costs</b> on unemployment. <b>firing</b> <b>costs,</b> on-the-job search, mutual consent, minimum wage...|$|E

This implies that disciplinary dismissals will not be costless. <b>Firing</b> <b>costs</b> in turn will {{have a negative effect on}} aggregate employment because they modify the rent that has to be paid to workers to prevent shirking.
