5|$|After John's loss of Normandy, Maulay went to England and {{was given}} the manor of Upavon in Wiltshire. His grant of the manor was at the king's pleasure, because the manor, which had been held by a noble who {{forfeited}} his land in England by staying in Normandy after its loss, {{would need to be}} restored to its rightful holder if John recovered Normandy. He served as an envoy to Rome in 1213 and in 1214 was in command of royal forces at La Rochelle in France. In 1214 he married Isabella, the daughter and heiress of Robert of Thornham. Robert had died in 1211, so through his wife, Maulay acquired the Barony of Mulgrave in Yorkshire. Maulay paid the king 7000 marks as a fine <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> marry Isabella, one of the highest fines paid <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> marry under John. According to the medieval chronicler Ralph of Coggeshall, Maulay was the murderer of John's nephew Arthur of Brittany.|$|E

5|$|In the Fourth Circuit case of Saunders v Wilkins (1945), Saunders {{claimed that}} Virginia should have its Congressional {{representation}} reduced {{because of its}} use of a poll tax and other voting restrictions.

The lawsuit was dismissed as a political question.|$|E

5|$|Madison {{was deeply}} {{read in the}} history of {{government}} and used a range of sources in composing the amendments. The English Magna Carta of 1215 inspired the right to petition and to trial by jury, for example, while the English Bill of Rights of 1689 provided an early precedent <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> keep and bear arms (although this applied only to Protestants) and prohibited cruel and unusual punishment.|$|E
5|$|Neville's {{household}} {{records for}} 1207 survive, detailing his itinerary for the year; in one eight-week period his household visited eleven different towns. In 1204 his wife offered the king 200 chickens <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> sleep one night with her husband, an obligation {{recorded in the}} royal records. The historian Daniel Crook suggests that this shows that Joan Neville {{was one of the}} barons' wives who attracted King John's sexual attentions.|$|E

5|$|After the Roman Empire {{collapsed}} and the aqueduct fell into disuse, the Pont du Gard remained largely intact, {{due to the}} importance of its secondary function, as a toll bridge. For centuries the local lords and bishops were responsible for its upkeep, in exchange <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> levy tolls on travellers using it to cross the river, although some of its stones were looted and serious damage was inflicted on it in the 17th century. It attracted increasing attention starting in the 18th century, and became an important tourist destination.|$|E
5|$|Around 1800, Europeans began {{settling}} the land {{east of the}} Mississippi River that was inhabited by the Chickasaw Indians for centuries prior {{to the arrival of}} Europeans. Chickasaw land in West Tennessee and southwestern Kentucky was ceded in the Jackson Purchase after negotiations in which the United States was represented by General Andrew Jackson and Governor Isaac Shelby, while the Chickasaw were represented by their chiefs and warriors. In 1818, both sides agreed to the transfer by signing the Treaty of Tuscaloosa. In the treaty, the United States agreed to pay the Chickasaw $300,000 in return <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> the land east of the Mississippi River and north of the Mississippi state line.|$|E
5|$|Both {{independent}} and major record labels bid <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> release Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, including Artemis Records and Nonesuch Records. Tweedy denied the bids of record labels {{that did not}} have a roster of signed artists that matched his liking. He also decided to ignore small independent companies because he {{wanted to be able to}} put the album out for a large audience and felt that they would be unable to produce more than 100,000 records. Wilco decided to sign with AOL Time Warner subsidiary Nonesuch Records in November 2001, basing the decision on the label's small size and artist-friendly atmosphere. In the end, Wilco recorded and produced Yankee Hotel Foxtrot with Reprise, received the rights to the album for free, and then sold it back to a different AOL Time Warner affiliate.|$|E

Held in Seattle, the two teams were tied in the best-of-five series when it was {{cancelled}} due to the Spanish flu epidemic, {{the first time the}} Stanley Cup was not awarded. In the 10 playoff games prior to the cancellation, Vézina had won six games, lost three and tied one, with one shutout.

5|$|On 19 December 1582, a {{proclamation}} in {{his name}} established parity for Catholics and Calvinists in the Electorate of Cologne, causing a scandal in the Catholic Church and the Holy Roman Empire, and after his marriage in February 1583, he sought to convert the Electorate into a dynastic dignity. For the next six years, his supporters fought those of the Catholic cathedral chapter <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> hold the electorship and the archdiocese in the so-called Cologne War or Seneschal War. After brutal fighting, and the plundering of villages, cities, and abbeys throughout the Electorate, Gebhard surrendered his claim on the electorate and retired to Strasbourg.

5|$|Prior to {{the start}} of the 1994-1995 college {{football}} season, the Gator Bowl was snubbed by the newly formed Bowl Alliance, a group of football conferences, bowl games, and television networks created to match up the No. 1 and No. 2 college football teams at the conclusion of each season. Though the Gator Bowl offered to pay $115 million <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> become a Bowl Alliance game, the Orange Bowl was selected in place of the Gator Bowl. This event had repercussions at the end of the season, when the bowl was passed over by high-ranked teams that elected to accept bids to bowls in the new Bowl Alliance.|$|E

5|$|Seeing {{that the}} Americans {{were likely to}} build a Nicaragua Canal, {{the owners of the}} defunct French company, {{including}} Philippe Bunau-Varilla, who still had exclusive rights to the Panama route, lowered their price. Beginning in early 1902, President Roosevelt became a backer of the latter route, and Congress passed legislation for it, if it could be secured within a reasonable time. In June, Roosevelt told Hay to take personal charge of the negotiations with Colombia. Later that year, Hay began talks with Colombia's acting minister in Washington, Tomás Herrán. The Hay-Herrán Treaty, granting $10 million to Colombia <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> build a canal, plus $250,000 annually, was signed on January 22, 1903, and ratified by the United States Senate two months later.

5|$|The 1956 Winter Olympics, officially {{known as}} the VII Olympic Winter Games (French: Les VIIes Jeux olympiques d'hiver) (Italian: VII Giochi olimpici invernali), was a winter multi-sport event celebrated in Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy. This celebration of the Games was held from 26 January to 5 February 1956. Cortina, which had {{originally}} been awarded the 1944 Winter Olympics, beat out Montreal, Colorado Springs and Lake Placid <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> host the 1956 Games. The Cortina Games were unique in {{that many of the}} venues were within walking distance of each other. The organising committee received financial support from the Italian government for infrastructure improvements, {{but the rest of the}} costs for the Games had to be privately financed. Consequently, the organising committee was the first to rely heavily on corporate sponsorship for funding.|$|E
5|$|The 2006 Chick-fil-A Bowl was a postseason college {{football}} match between the Georgia Bulldogs and the Virginia Tech Hokies at the Georgia Dome in Atlanta, Georgia. The University of Georgia represented the Southeastern Conference (SEC) and Virginia Tech represented the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) in the competition. The game {{was the final}} competition of the 2006 football season for each team and resulted in a 31–24 Georgia victory, even though spread bettors favored Virginia Tech to win by three points. In exchange <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> pick the first ACC team after the Bowl Championship Series selections, bowl representatives paid US$3.25million to the ACC, while the SEC, whose fifth team was selected, received $2.4million. The combined $5.65million payout was the seventh-largest among all {{college football}} bowl games, and the fourth-largest non-BCS bowl game payout.|$|E
5|$|The Macdonald Liberals easily won {{re-election}} in 1949 and 1953, but the Conservatives made steady gains under Robert Stanfield, their new leader. The Conservatives for example, {{drew attention to}} kickback schemes under which brewing companies, wineries and distilleries contributed to the Liberal party in exchange <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> sell their products in government liquor stores. The Liberals seemed secure against such allegations however, {{as long as they}} were led by the popular Angus L. Macdonald. However, Macdonald suffered a slight heart attack on April 11, 1954, and was admitted to hospital where he died in his sleep two nights later, just four months before his 64th birthday.|$|E
