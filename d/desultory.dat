5|$|The years {{following}} the Theban coup had seen <b>desultory</b> fighting between Sparta and Thebes, with Athens also drawn into the conflict. A feeble attempt at a common peace {{had been made in}} 375 BC, but <b>desultory</b> fighting between Athens and Sparta had resumed by 373BC (at the latest). By 371 BC, Athens and Sparta were again war-weary, and in 371 BC a conference was held at Sparta to discuss another attempt at a common peace.|$|E
5|$|After {{the fall}} of Sevastopol, {{hostilities}} continued in a <b>desultory</b> fashion. The business of Seacole and Day prospered in the interim period, with the officers taking the opportunity to enjoy themselves in the quieter days. There were theatrical performances and horse-racing events for which Seacole provided catering.|$|E
5|$|In writing these <b>desultory</b> letters, I found I {{could not}} avoid being {{continually}} {{the first person}} – 'the little hero of each tale.' I tried to correct this fault, if it be one, for they were designed for publication; but in proportion as I arranged my thoughts, my letter, I found, became stiff and affected: I, therefore, determined to let my remarks and reflections flow unrestrained, as I perceived that I could not give a just description of what I saw, but by relating the effect different objects had produced on my mind and feelings, whilst the impression was still fresh.|$|E
5|$|When {{the initial}} request was refused, Ugartechea sent 100dragoons to {{retrieve}} the cannon. The soldiers neared Gonzales on September 29, but the colonists {{used a variety of}} excuses to keep them from the town, while secretly sending messengers to request assistance from nearby communities. Within two days, up to 140 Texians gathered in Gonzales, all determined not to give up the cannon. On October 1, settlers voted to initiate a fight. Mexican soldiers opened fire as Texians approached their camp {{in the early hours of}} October 2. After several hours of <b>desultory</b> firing, the Mexican soldiers withdrew.|$|E
5|$|The growing {{threat that}} Clan Donald posed to the Scottish crown {{led to the}} forcible {{dissolution}} of the Lordship of the Isles by James IV in 1493, but although the king {{had the power to}} subdue the organised military might of the Hebrides, he and his immediate successors lacked the will or ability to provide an alternative form of governance. The House of Stuart's attempts to control the Outer Hebrides were then at first <b>desultory</b> and little more than punitive expeditions. In 1506 the Earl of Huntly besieged and captured Stornoway Castle using cannon. In 1540 James V himself conducted a royal tour, forcing the clan chiefs to accompany him. There followed a period of peace, but all too soon the clans were at loggerheads again.|$|E
5|$|VOC forces {{landed on}} 4–5 May on Trunajaya's right flank. Trunajaya {{did not expect}} an attack on this flank, and {{consequently}} it was only lightly defended. VOC took Ampel after little resistance. In the following days, the VOC established its battery in Ampel, simultaneously conducting <b>desultory</b> negotiations with Trunajaya. Trunajaya accused Speelman of being unknightly by attacking his right flank instead of his main position. Both Trunajaya and VOC moved their works forward until their artillery batteries faced each other at pistol-shot distance. Trunajaya dammed the river, the VOC's source of fresh water; afterwards, the VOC troops were limited to brackish water, and diseases soon spread.|$|E
5|$|When the Italo-Turkish War {{began on}} 29 September 1911, she was {{flagship}} of the 4th Division of the 2nd Squadron of the Mediterranean Fleet, commanded by Rear Admiral Paolo Thaon di Revel, {{and was one}} of the ships that bombarded Tripoli on 3–4 October. Giuseppe Garibaldi was the first ship to enter the harbor after the conclusion of the bombardment when a small landing party entered Fort Hamidiye and disabled the breech mechanisms of the fort's guns. The <b>desultory</b> bombardment killed 12 Ottoman soldiers and severely wounded 23 more in addition to 7 dead civilians. On 13 October, the three sisters sailed to Augusta, Sicily to recoal. The ship andVarese were in Tobruk in January 1912 while the bulk of the fleet was refitting in Italy.|$|E
5|$|At 09:24 on {{the morning}} of 1 June, Howe sent his ships into action using the {{original}} tactic of turning each ship in his line northwest simultaneously, so that they would bear down individually on Villaret's fleet and each break the enemy line separately. His intention was to cut the French line in 25 places, raking the enemy vessels at both bow and stern and dividing their fire so they could be defeated piecemeal. Ultimately though this ambitious plan failed, due to ill-discipline among Howe's subordinates and the damage his fleet had sustained over the previous week. While six of Howe's ships did break the French line as ordered, and several others came close, many of his captains failed to follow orders and instead engaged the enemy from a distance in <b>desultory</b> gun duels which had little effect.|$|E
5|$|Charlie is {{accepted}} by Sam and Patrick's {{group of friends}} and begins experimenting with tobacco, alcohol and other drugs. At a party Charlie trips on LSD. He cannot control his flashbacks of Aunt Helen, {{who died in a}} car crash on her way to buy him a birthday gift. He ends up in the hospital after falling asleep in the snow. At a regular Rocky Horror Picture Show performance, Charlie is asked to fill in as Rocky for Sam's boyfriend Craig, who is unavailable. Their friend Mary Elizabeth is impressed and asks Charlie to the Sadie Hawkins dance and they enter into a <b>desultory</b> relationship. The relationship ends, however, during a game of truth or dare when Charlie is dared to kiss the prettiest girl in the room. He kisses Sam, and Mary Elizabeth storms out of the room in response. Following this, Patrick suggests that Charlie stay away from Sam for a while, {{and the rest of the}} friend group shuns him. His flashbacks of Aunt Helen return.|$|E
5|$|In the House, <b>desultory</b> {{debate on}} Fraser's censure motion ended with it being amended by the ALP {{majority}} into a condemnation of Fraser and passed on a party line vote. By 2.34pm, when Fraser rose {{and announced that}} he had been commissioned as Prime Minister, word of the dismissal had spread through the House. Fraser announced his intent to advise a double dissolution, and moved that the House adjourn. His motion was defeated. Fraser's new government suffered repeated defeats in the House, which passed a motion of no confidence in him, and asked the Speaker, Gordon Scholes, to urge the Governor-General to recommission Whitlam. Scholes, attempting to communicate this to the Governor General, was initially told that an appointment might not be possible that day, but after stating that he would reconvene the House and tell them of the refusal, was given an appointment with Kerr for 4.45pm.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Peloponnesian War, the militaristic city-state of Sparta had been able to impose a hegemony over the heartland of Classical Greece (the Peloponessus and mainland Greece south of Thessaly), the states of this area having been severely weakened by the war. This state of affairs was resented by many of the Greek city-states, which had traditionally been ferociously independent, and led directly to the Corinthian War of 395–387 BC. Sparta emerged from this conflict with its hegemony intact, though only as a result of Persian intervention, which led to the so-called King's Peace. The fragility of Spartan dominance had been demonstrated however, and in the next decade, the Thebans would revolt against Sparta. The Spartans were unable to successfully quell the revolt, leading to de facto Theban independence. Then, after several years of <b>desultory</b> conflict, the Thebans finally met the Spartans in open battle at Leuctra (371 BC), and under the leadership of Epaminondas inflicted an unprecedented defeat on the Spartan army, killing the Spartan king Cleombrotus I in the process.|$|E
5|$|Justin and Diodorus {{both say}} that Philip also invaded Thessaly in 358 BC. In the years up to 370 BC, Thessaly had enjoyed a brief {{ascendancy}} in the Greek world, after being unified under Jason of Pherae, {{who was appointed}} Tagus (chief magistrate) of Thessaly. However, Jason was assassinated in 370 BC, and his son Alexander became Tagus. Alexander ruled harshly, and other states of the Thessalian League therefore withdrew their support for him, resulting in a <b>desultory</b> conflict in which both Macedon (under Alexander II) and eventually Thebes became embroiled. This conflict eventually ended in 364 BC when the Thebans were victorious over Alexander, and imposed a peace settlement on Thessaly. However, with the weakening of Thebes {{in the aftermath of}} Mantinea, on-off conflict within Thessaly continued. Alexander was himself assassinated in 358 BC, by his wife's brothers Lycophron and Tisiphonus, who became tyrants in his place. According to Diodorus, the Aleuadae, the noble family which dominated politics in the northern Thessalian city of Larissa, were opposed to these new tyrants, and requested aid from Philip.|$|E
5|$|More {{disturbing}} to Lord Howe were {{the actions of}} HMS Russell and HMS Caesar. Russell's captain John Willett Payne was criticised at the time for failing to get {{to grips with the}} enemy more closely and allowing her opponent Téméraire to badly damage her rigging in the early stages, although later commentators blamed damage received on 29 May for her poor start to the action. There were no such excuses, however, for Captain Anthony Molloy of Caesar, who totally failed in his duty to engage the enemy. Molloy completely ignored Howe's signal and continued ahead as if the British battleline was following him rather than engaging the French fleet directly. Caesar did participate in a <b>desultory</b> exchange of fire with the leading French ship Trajan but her fire had little effect, while Trajan inflicted much damage to Caesar's rigging and was subsequently able to attack Bellerophon as well, roaming unchecked through the melee developing {{at the head of the}} line.|$|E
5|$|After dark, the 48th Battalion {{took over}} the line from the {{remainder}} of the 9th Division. The 47th Battalion was still on its right, and on the left was the British V Corps. The 48th Battalion occupied a small salient between Albert and Dernancourt. During the night, <b>desultory</b> artillery and machine gun fire was directed at the battalion's positions. In the early morning light of 28 March, the forward two companies could make out German infantry advancing through the fog. They approached without the coverage of a barrage, and in quite close formation, some had their rifles slung. The men of the 48th Battalion quickly brought their weapons to bear and the Germans stopped advancing. A minor break through on the right-flanking 47th Battalion was quickly dealt with and thirty prisoners taken. During the day, the Germans advanced another eight times, each time more cautiously and with a little more fire support. But each time the Australians beat them back. By evening the Germans appeared to have withdrawn, and the 48th Battalion had suffered the loss of 62 men. That night and the next two days passed relatively quietly, with Leane rotating his companies through the front line posts, with characteristic care not to create congestion in the forward areas. The battalion was relieved on the night of 30 March.|$|E
5|$|While Nelson {{was engaged}} in the Central and Eastern Mediterranean, the main Mediterranean Fleet under Earl St Vincent had ensured that the Spanish Navy was unable to intervene. On 24 May St Vincent was joined at the Tagus by a {{reinforcement}} of eight ships under Rear-Admiral Sir Roger Curtis, and the admiral ordered his ships to establish blockades off the southern Spanish ports, especially Cadiz, where the main Spanish fleet lay at anchor. There regular correspondence passed between St Vincent and Admiral Don Joseph Massaredo, the Spanish commander. The Spanish fleet made no major deployments during the year, except for a single convoy of the ship of the line Monarca, two frigates and several merchant vessels that sailed in April. Although privateers and minor warships fought several small engagements along the Spanish Mediterranean coast, the only significant Spanish deployment of {{the remainder of the}} year was by a frigate squadron based at Cartagena, which was intercepted by the British ship of the line Lion. At the ensuing Action of 15 July 1798, the Spanish ships formed a line to meet the attack of Captain Dixon's ship but the damaged frigate Santa Dorotea fell behind the leading three frigates. As the leading ships returned to Catagena after a <b>desultory</b> long-range exchange of gunfire, Santa Dorotea was defeated and captured.|$|E

25|$|Although {{resistance}} {{had been}} expected, as seen at Salerno during 1943, the initial landings were essentially unopposed, {{with the exception}} of <b>desultory</b> Luftwaffe strafing runs.|$|E
25|$|However, Phagpa mostly {{resided in}} Lintao in Gansu and {{apparently}} had <b>desultory</b> {{contacts with the}} emperor. He vacated the post by 1274 and returned to Sakya, leaving the title to his brother, Rinchen Gyaltsen.|$|E
25|$|Plausible {{scenarios}} {{are easy to}} construct. Morton, measuring by seed, picks up a threateningly large black skull, fills it lightly and gives it a few <b>desultory</b> shakes. Next, he takes a distressingly small Caucasian skull, shakes hard, and pushes mightily at the foramen magnum with his thumb. It is easily done, without conscious motivation; expectation is a powerful guide to action.|$|E
25|$|England now {{entered the}} war and {{occupied}} Jamaica. The long, <b>desultory</b> and weary struggle effectively ended at the Battle of the Dunes (1658) where the French army under Vicomte de Turenne (along with some English help) defeated the Spanish army of the Netherlands. Spain agreed to the Peace of the Pyrenees in 1659 that ceded to France Artois, Roussillon, and portions of Lorraine.|$|E
25|$|I {{found there}} were {{absolutely}} no persons holding the stations {{of what are}} called, in England, Leaders, {{on either side of}} the House.... It is true, that certain members do take charge of administration questions, and certain others of opposition questions; but all this so obviously without concert among themselves, actual or tacit, that nothing can be conceived less systematic or more completely <b>desultory,</b> disjointed.|$|E
25|$|The {{defense of}} Roanoke Island started in an {{accidental}} manner. When the Federal fleet appeared off Hatteras Inlet on August 27, 1861, the 3rd Georgia Infantry Regiment was hastily sent from Norfolk to help hold the forts there, but the forts fell before they arrived, {{so they were}} diverted to Roanoke Island. They remained there {{for the next three}} months, making somewhat <b>desultory</b> efforts to expel the Union forces from Hatteras Island.|$|E
25|$|Next {{morning it}} became clear that the unknown vessels were {{probably}} French so Calcutta signalled the convoy to make sail without her and moved to intercept the French vessels. She sailed towards the nearest vessel, which turned out to be the 40-gun frigate Armide. The engagement was <b>desultory</b> but Calcutta succeeded in luring the French southward and away from the convoy. As a result, the French detached the brig Sylph which captured only the slow-sailing Brothers.|$|E
25|$|The {{next year}} Autodelta shifted its focus to circuit racing the Alfettas, {{which won the}} under 2.5-liter Group 2 {{division}} of the European Touring Car Championship, scoring a remarkable second place overall at the 24 Hours Spa, {{as well as an}} overall win in the ETC race at Vallelunga. Despite such results, Autodelta's efforts with the Group 2 Alfetta were <b>desultory</b> and ended prematurely, due to Alfa's budgetary constraints and heavy commitments to Formula One and the World Championship for Sports Cars.|$|E
25|$|Military honours in Italy {{undoubtedly}} {{belonged to}} the French commander Marshal Catinat, but Eugene, the one Allied general determined on action and decisive results, did well {{to emerge from the}} Nine Years' War with an enhanced reputation. With the signing of the Treaty of Ryswick in September/October 1697, the <b>desultory</b> war in the west was finally brought to an inconclusive end, and Leopold I could once again devote all his martial energies into defeating the Ottoman Turks in the east.|$|E
25|$|On 1 October {{the siege}} began when Frobisher's ships arrived and {{blockaded}} the fort (which {{was still not}} finished) and fired off a <b>desultory</b> bombardment before the land force arrived. The besieging army arrived soon after and began to open trenches on 11 October, supported by canon fire from the sea by English ships. The besiegers however suffered from the Spanish artillery fire during the installation of wicker filled gabions, trenches and artillery emplacements. They also {{had to cope with}} sorties from the Spanish bastions, day and night, so that the siege positions were not permanently positioned.|$|E
25|$|The Ottoman Empire often {{interfered}} in {{the affairs}} of Transylvania, always an unruly district, and this interference brought on a war with the Holy Roman Empire, which after some <b>desultory</b> operations really began in 1663. By a personal appeal to the diet at Regensburg Leopold induced the princes to send assistance for the campaign; troops were also sent by France, and in August 1664, the great Imperial general Raimondo Montecuccoli gained a notable victory at Saint Gotthard. By the Peace of Vasvár the Emperor made a twenty years' truce with the Sultan, granting more generous terms than his recent victory seemed to render necessary.|$|E
25|$|A Japanese {{infantry}} {{company from}} the 1st Battalion of the 143rd Infantry Regiment landed from one troopship at the coastal village of Ban Don {{in the early}} hours of 8 December. They marched into Surat Thani, where they were opposed by Royal Thai Police and civilian volunteers. The <b>desultory</b> fighting took place amid a rainstorm, and only ended in the afternoon when the hard-pressed Thais received orders to lay down their arms. The Thais lost 17 or 18 dead, but the number of injured was not known. The Japanese then moved into Bangkok, occupying Chinatown (Sampeng) and turning the Chamber of Commerce Building into a command post.|$|E
25|$|After the dreadfully <b>desultory</b> affair at the Sydney Football Stadium a {{fortnight}} before, the ten-try bonanza {{turned on by}} the two sides at Ballymore was a timely reminder that running rugby, {{with the emphasis on}} the players and not the whistle, was what the public wanted. Welsh referee Clive Norling had given only thirteen penalties, ensuring the continuity needed by sides with the attacking flair of France and Australia. A close study of the video replay shows that Norling made at least six major mistakes, five of which led to points being scored. Nevertheless he was hailed as a hero for his willingness to let the players be the stars.|$|E
25|$|McDonald, {{along with}} USWA general counsel Arthur J. Goldberg, {{played a key}} role in the merger of the AFL and CIO in 1955. Murray had long disdained merger but had engaged in <b>desultory</b> merge talks on and off for much of his presidency. With the death of Murray on November 9 and AFL {{president}} William Green just two weeks later, the personality differences keeping the two labor federations apart seemed to disappear. Gone too were the paralyzing arguments over industrial unionism, organizing and civil rights. Both labor federations were organizing significant numbers of workers (including blacks), and many of the workers went into industrial unions.|$|E
25|$|Coal {{was first}} {{discovered}} in Cebu about 1837. There were 15 localities {{over the whole}} island, on both coast; some <b>desultory</b> mining had been carried out Naga near Mount Uling, but most serious operations were at Licos and Camansi west of Compostela and Danao. Active work ceased about 1895 with insurrections, and no production worked {{for more than ten}} years. A topographic and geologic survey of Compostela, Danao and Carmen took place in 1906. The Compostela-Danao coalfield contained about six million workable tons. The tramroads, one from Danao to Camansi, one from Compostela to Mount Licos, were undertaken in 1895, together with a wagon road built in 1877, from Cotcot to Dapdap.|$|E
25|$|In {{the thick}} of the battle an English man of war took a hit in her powder {{magazine}} and blew up and sank with most of her crew, and a 30-gun French man of war and a smaller flyboat were destroyed by fireships. The French and the Dutch seeing that they could not get through realized the battle had been lost. The battle then ended with a <b>desultory</b> long-range exchange between both ﬂeets, with the English fleet still holding its line, de La Barre with increasing casualties and his ship severely damaged then decided to withdraw off towards Saint Kitts by 2 p.m. compelling the Dutch under an angry Crijnssen to follow.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, to the north-west at Mafeking, on {{the border}} with Transvaal, Colonel Robert Baden-Powell had raised two regiments of local forces amounting to about 1,200 men in order to attack and create diversions if things further south went amiss. Mafeking, being a railway junction, {{provided}} good supply facilities and was the obvious place for Baden-Powell to fortify in readiness for such attacks. However, instead of being the aggressor Baden-Powell and Mafeking were forced to defend when 6,000 Boer, commanded by Piet Cronje, attempted a determined assault on the town. But this quickly subsided into a <b>desultory</b> affair with the Boers prepared to starve the stronghold into submission, and so, on 13 October, began the 217-day Siege of Mafeking.|$|E
25|$|For hours {{there was}} a {{stand-off}} between the 3,000 rebels and the 9,000 loyal troops stationed outside the Senate building, with some <b>desultory</b> shooting from the rebel side. A vast crowd of civilian on-lookers began fraternizing with the rebels, but did not join the action. Eventually Nicholas, the new Tsar, appeared in person, at the square, and sent Count Mikhail Miloradovich, a military hero who was greatly respected by ordinary soldiers, to parley with the rebels. Miloradovich was fatally shot by Pyotr Kakhovsky while delivering a public address to defuse the situation. At the same time, a rebelling squad of grenadiers, led by Lieutenant Nikolay Panov, entered the Winter Palace but failed to seize it, and retreated.|$|E
25|$|Seatallan's {{south-western}} ridge falls gently {{at first}} across the broad green expanse of Nether Wasdale Common, finally narrowing {{to a point}} at Cat Bields (500m or 1,640ft), {{a mile from the}} summit. From here the slope continues in the same direction to the Greendale- Gosforth road, its progress only briefly interrupted by the few <b>desultory</b> rocks of Gray Crag. A smaller spur runs out south from Cat Bields, only resolving into a definite ridge some way down the slope at Glade How (435m or 1,425ft). This cairned top is recognised as a summit by some guidbooks. A little to the south of Glade How the spur ends in a wall of crag, dropping 900ft to the road below. This is Buckbarrow.|$|E
