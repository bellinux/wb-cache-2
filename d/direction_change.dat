5|$|In Dearborn, US12 intersects US24 (Telegraph Road) at an {{interchange}} on {{the western}} side of the city, and M-39 (Southfield Freeway) on the eastern side near the River Rouge crossing and Greenfield Village. On the Dearborn–Detroit city border, US12 pass through a complex interchange with I-94 (Edsel Ford Freeway) and M-153 (Ford Road/Wyoming Avenue). Michigan Avenue continues northeasterly parallel to I-94 for a short distance before it turns due east. Once it makes the <b>direction</b> <b>change,</b> it forms the 0 Mile of Detroit's Mile Road System. US12 continues through residential areas on Detroit's West Side, passing through the interchange that connects I-75 with I-96's eastern terminus near the Ambassador Bridge. The highway runs through Corktown, Detroit and beside the site of the former Tiger Stadium at the corner of Michigan and Trumbull. East of the former stadium, US12 crosses M-10 (Lodge Freeway) near the MGM Grand Detroit casino. East of M-10, Michigan Avenue enters Downtown Detroit. At the corner of Michigan and Cass, US12 ends while Michigan Avenue continues several blocks further to terminate at Campus Martius Park at Woodward Avenue.|$|E
25|$|As drought {{conditions}} continue, groundwater levels {{drop and}} this provides excellent conditions for fires to develop. With hot, dry weather and no moisture underground, trees lose moisture and become very flammable in dry conditions. This leads to wildfires which usually {{is the main}} impact of drought in the United Kingdom, with moorland vegetation such as heather badly affected as the peat bogs dry out. Also, these fires can continue, even when seemingly put out, as the smoldering peat re-ignites the dry vegetation. However, during severe droughts, many trees can burn, and people's lives can be at risk, as in the 1976 drought when a fire encroached on a hospital, and only a wind <b>direction</b> <b>change</b> saved the patients' lives. As embers can be transported easily, and if drought is severe enough, fires can start miles away from their original position as they are transported by wind and even dust devils. With these situations, roads are often closed to prevent loss of life and further damage. These fires also can destroy wildlife habitats, and this can also threaten wildlife.|$|E

Officials closed schools in Dhofar Governorate. The storm ultimately passed the country to the southwest, sparing the feared impacts from the cyclone. But first it was expected to hit Salalah,Oman.

500|$|According to Olivia Banner of Signs, medical {{journals}} generally had positive {{reviews of the}} novel for its depiction of the inner lives of intersex people. Writing in Archives of Disease in Childhood, Simon Fountain-Polley praised the novel, writing: [...] "All clinicians, and families who have faced gender crises or difficult life-changing decision on identity should read this book; delve into an emotional trip of discovery—where the slightest <b>direction</b> <b>change</b> could lead to myriad different lives." [...] Abraham Bergman wrote in the Archives of Pediatrics & Adolescent Medicine: [...] "Yes, it is fiction, but I cannot imagine a more authentic and sensitive voice. Because our interactions usually take place in limited and structured setting such as offices and hospitals, pediatricians have scant opportunity to learn how our young patients think. One way to sharpen our awareness is to listen to children's voices as they are expressed in books. In Middlesex, the voice is loud and clear." [...] Banner noted {{that most of the}} reviews in intersex and queer publications praised Middlesex. She posited that the problematic issues of a [...] "heteromasculine-identified narrator" [...] and the [...] "fact that it was authored by a heterosexual man" [...] may have been outweighed by the necessity for an appropriate reading that [...] "destigmatizes ambiguous sex".|$|E

2500|$|The band {{decided to}} change its name to Revocation in 2006; Davidson commented: [...] "I think, looking a little deeper into it, we {{made a lot of}} {{mistakes}} with Cryptic Warning. We were younger and didn't really know what we were doing, so Revocation was us starting fresh with a clean slate and revoking our past mistakes." [...] With a <b>direction</b> <b>change,</b> Revocation promptly recorded a three-song demo titled Summon the Spawn, and in 2008 they went back into the studio to record their first full-length album, Empire of the Obscene. The full length was self-released, and the band financed its own tour, attracting the interest of several record labels. Revocation subsequently signed to Relapse Records.|$|E
2500|$|A true <b>direction</b> <b>change</b> {{involving}} the feet {{moving in a}} new direction requires either a prep step or a pivot, both of which are sometimes referred to as a flank. To perform a prep step, on the last count of movement in the first direction a marcher plants the foot with the heel turned outward at half the angle of the turn desired, with the upper body still facing forward. On the next count, the other foot snaps into position completing the turn. The upper body may or may not turn with the lower body. Some bands plant the heel on the prep step rather than the toe, but preserving the angle of the foot. [...] To perform a pivot, the marcher pivots between directions over the ball of the foot on the last count instead of using a prep step.|$|E
6000|$|... 923. From this {{it seems}} {{apparent}} that the peculiar character and condition of an electrolyte is essential {{in one part of}} the voltaic circuit; and its nature being considered, good reasons appear why it and it alone should be effectual. An electrolyte is always a compound body: it can conduct, but only whilst decomposing. Its conduction depends upon its decomposition and the transmission of its particles in directions parallel to the current; and so intimate is this connexion, that if their transition be stopped, the current is stopped also; if their course be changed, its course and <b>direction</b> <b>change</b> with them; if they proceed in one direction, it has no power to proceed in any other than a direction invariably dependent on them. The particles of an electrolytic body are all so mutually connected, are in such relation with each other through their whole extent in the direction of the current, that if the last is not disposed of, the first is not at liberty to take up its place in the new combination which the powerful affinity of the most active metal tends to produce; and then the current itself is stopped; for the dependencies of the current and the decomposition are so mutual, that whichsoever be originally determined, i.e. the motion of the particles or the motion of the current, the other is invariable in its concomitant production and its relation to it.|$|E
