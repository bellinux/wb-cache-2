5|$|After its {{deployment}} in the Korean War, {{the division}} {{was active in}} Europe and the United States during the Cold War, but saw relatively little combat until the Persian Gulf War, when it faced the Iraqi military.

Following a coin flip, Toronto was given first choice and selected Chicago Bulls point guard and three-point specialist B. J. Armstrong. Armstrong refused to report <b>for</b> <b>training,</b> <b>and</b> Thomas promptly traded him to the Golden State Warriors for power forwards Carlos Rogers and Victor Alexander.

5|$|During the 1960s, {{following}} {{the introduction of}} the supersonic English Electric Lightning in the interceptor role, the Hunter transitioned to being operated as a fighter-bomber and for aerial reconnaissance missions, using dedicated variants for these purposes. Two-seat variants remained in use <b>for</b> <b>training</b> <b>and</b> secondary roles with the RAF and the Royal Navy until the early 1990s. Sixty years after its original introduction it was still in active service, being operated by the Lebanese Air Force until 2014.|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to compare the productivity <b>and</b> profitability of <b>trained</b> <b>and</b> non-trained small-scale broiler farmers in the Joypurhat district of Bangladesh. A total number of sixty farmers were trained on the “modern techniques for profitable and sustainable broiler farming”. The study showed that the mortality of broiler was 2. 90 ± 0. 89 percent and 11. 30 ± 2. 29 percent <b>for</b> <b>trained</b> <b>and</b> non-trained farmers, respectively (P< 0. 001). Feed conversion ratio (FCR) was 1. 65 ± 0. 08 and 1. 75 ± 0. 10 <b>for</b> <b>trained</b> <b>and</b> non-trained farmers, respectively (P< 0. 01). The net profit was 18. 60 ± 2. 77 and 8. 74 ± 2. 05 taka per broiler <b>for</b> <b>trained</b> <b>and</b> non-trained farmers, respectively (P< 0. 001). It can be concluded from the present study that the family training would be a very essential tool for gaining more productivity and profitability of small scale broiler farming in Bangladesh...|$|R

5|$|First of the class, Osvetnik was {{involved}} in a series of visits to Mediterranean ports during the interwar period.

5|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War, Stewart was posted to Army Headquarters in Wellington, with responsibility <b>for</b> <b>training</b> <b>and</b> staff duties. Now a lieutenant colonel, he was seconded to the Second Expeditionary Force (2NZEF) in late 1939 and embarked for the Middle East in early 1940 as General Staff Officer for the 2nd New Zealand Division. He worked closely with Major General Bernard Freyberg, the divisional commander during the Battle of Greece. After the end of the campaign in Greece, most of the division, including Stewart and Freyberg, was evacuated to Crete. Here, Stewart was promoted to brigadier and served with Creforce as Freyberg's Brigadier General Staff. His services on Crete were recognised with the Distinguished Service Order.|$|E
