He had the option of joining the medical corps because of his training and age but he volunteered instead to join a fighting unit as a gunner and medical officer. It was his second tour of duty in the Canadian military. He had previously fought with a volunteer force in the Second Boer War. He considered himself a soldier first; his father was a military leader in Guelph and McCrae grew up believing in the duty of <b>fighting</b> <b>for</b> <b>his</b> country and empire.|$|E

But Mr. Diefenbaker provided the liveliest show of the election... and many listeners undoubtedly failed to notice that he was saying even less than the Prime Minister, though saying it more shrilly and with evangelistic fervour... Mr. Diefenbaker has chosen instead to cast himself as the humble man in a mood of protest, the common Canadian outraged by Liberal prosperity, the little guy <b>fighting</b> <b>for</b> <b>his</b> rights.|$|E

Stephen responded by placing Wallingford Castle, a key fortress loyal to Henry along the Thames Valley, under siege, possibly {{in an attempt to}} force a successful end to the English conflict while Henry was still <b>fighting</b> <b>for</b> <b>his</b> territories in France. Henry moved quickly in response, avoiding open battle with Louis in Aquitaine and stabilising the Norman border, pillaging the Vexin and then striking south into Anjou against Geoffrey, capturing one of his main castles. Louis fell ill and withdrew from the campaign, and Geoffrey was forced {{to come to terms with}} Henry.|$|E

La Follette's investments consisted of partial interest in a radio station, which earned him a profit of $47,000 over two years.|$|E

25|$|Jandamarra The Play (2008) {{was sold}} out before its opening season premiere at the Perth International Arts Festival.

Jandamarra, a Bunuba warrior born in 1873, was famous for leading his people in an armed uprising against the British colonisation of their lands. He outsmarted the police and settlers in the Kimberley for years, before being killed in 1897 at the age of 24. Geoffrey Bolton, a distinguished Australian historian, compared Jandamarra to guerilla leaders like the Mexican revolutionary Emiliano Zapata and Sicilian rebel Salvatore Giuliano. Oscar said Jandamarra was <b>fighting</b> <b>for</b> <b>his</b> people’s freedom. “He was not an outlaw, he was <b>fighting</b> <b>for</b> <b>his</b> land, I think he was a freedom fighter”.|$|E

25|$|During his minority, France {{was ruled}} by Charles' uncles, as regents.

Louis of Anjou was <b>fighting</b> <b>for</b> <b>his</b> {{claim to the}} Kingdom of Naples after 1382, dying in 1384, John of Berry was interested mainly in the Languedoc, and not particularly interested in politics; whilst Louis of Bourbon was a largely unimportant figure, due to his personality (he showed signs of mental instability) and his status (since {{he was not the}} son of a king).|$|E

Due to his steadfastness and that of Sitting Bull, government agents obtained the necessary signatures for approval through subterfuge, such as using the signatures of children. He negotiated strongly with Indian Agents such as Dr. Valentine McGillycuddy.|$|E
