This paper predates the first presentation by Joseph Fourier on the subject in 1807.|$|E
25|$|A {{different}} {{problem which}} {{is closely related}} to interpolation is the approximation of a complicated function by a simple function. Suppose the formula for some given function is known, but too complex to evaluate efficiently. A few known data points from the original function can be used to create an interpolation based on a simpler function. Of course, when a simple function is used to estimate data points from the original, interpolation errors are usually present; however, depending on the problem domain and the <b>interpolation</b> <b>method</b> used, the gain in simplicity may be of greater value than the resultant loss in precision.|$|E

Furthermore, a {{good number}} of important operators, such as the Hardy-Littlewood maximal operator, are only sublinear. This is not a hindrance to applying real <b>interpolation</b> <b>methods,</b> but complex <b>interpolation</b> <b>methods</b> are ill-equipped to handle non-linear operators. On the other hand, real <b>interpolation</b> <b>methods,</b> compared to complex <b>interpolation</b> <b>methods,</b> tend to produce worse estimates on the intermediate operator norms and do not behave as well off the diagonal in the Riesz diagram. The off-diagonal versions of the Marcinkiewicz interpolation theorem require the formalism of Lorentz spaces and do not necessarily produce norm estimates on the -spaces.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. High-density objects, like catheters, {{pacemakers}} or even contrast agent-filled vessels, cause characteristic streak {{artifacts in}} computed tomography (CT). Similar to metal artifacts, these streaks {{can be reduced}} by removing the dense object using segmentation and interpolation. First, we compare state-of-the-art <b>interpolation</b> <b>methods</b> like linear, spline and higher-order methods to the Healing Brush technique. Second, a new method is presented, that extracts a low-frequency model of the dense object and restores the decomposed X-ray intensity of the remaining tissue. This method is henceforth called Subtract-and-Shift. Compared to standard <b>interpolation</b> <b>methods,</b> it retains the measured structure that is superimposed and dominated by the dense object. The extracted structure is then used to replace the segmented pixel intensities of the object. The introduced method is compared to state-of-the-art <b>interpolation</b> <b>methods</b> using in-vivo data. First preliminary results show that Subtract-and-Shift can be superior to these <b>interpolation</b> <b>methods.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Measuring {{the spatial}} {{distribution}} of heavy metal contaminants {{is the basis of}} pollution evaluation and risk control. Considering the cost of soil sampling and analysis, spatial <b>interpolation</b> <b>methods</b> have been widely applied to estimate the heavy metal concentrations at unsampled locations. However, traditional spatial <b>interpolation</b> <b>methods</b> assume the sample sites can be located stochastically on a plane and the spatial association between sample locations is analyzed using Euclidean distances, which may lead to biased conclusions in some circumstances. This study aims to analyze the spatial distribution characteristics of copper and lead contamination in river sediments of Daye using network spatial analysis methods. The results demonstrate that network inverse distance weighted <b>interpolation</b> <b>methods</b> are more accurate than planar <b>interpolation</b> <b>methods.</b> Furthermore, the method named local indicators of network-constrained clusters based on local Moran’ I statistic (ILINCS) is applied to explore the local spatial patterns of copper and lead pollution in river sediments, which is helpful for identifying the contaminated areas and assessing heavy metal pollution of Daye...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept and}} the {{computation}} of terrain representation error (ETR) are investigated and total DEM error {{is presented as}} an accuracy index for DEM evaluation at a global level. A promising method of surface modelling based on the theorem of surfaces (SMTS) has been developed. A numerical test and a real-world example are employed to comparatively analyze the simulation accuracy of SMTS and the classical <b>interpolation</b> <b>methods,</b> including IDW, SPLINE and KRIGING performed in ARCGIS 9. 1 in terms of sampling and interpolation errors and of total DEM error. The numerical test shows that SMTS is much more accurate than the classical <b>interpolation</b> <b>methods</b> and ETR has a worse influence on the accuracy of SMTS {{than those of the}} classical <b>interpolation</b> <b>methods.</b> In a real-world example, DEMs are constructed with SMTS as well as the three classical <b>interpolation</b> <b>methods.</b> The results indicate that, although SMTS is more accurate than the classical <b>interpolation</b> <b>methods,</b> a real-world test indicates that there is a large accuracy loss. Total DEM error composed of, not only sampling and interpolation errors, but also ETRs can be considered as a good accuracy measure for DEM evaluation at a global level. SMTS is an alternative method for DEM construction. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
