50|$|Overall {{similar to}} schistacea, but back noticeably brown and wings and tail with {{pronounced}} rusty wash. Altogether, intermediate between schistacea {{and the eastern}} <b>fox</b> <b>sparrow</b> (P.

Considerable variation in this population suggests some hybridization with the sooty <b>fox</b> <b>sparrow</b> subspecies fuliginosa and the Yukon <b>fox</b> <b>sparrow,</b> as well as intergradation with schistacea (around Banff) and the doubtfully distinct olivacea (Weckstein et al. 2002).|$|E

50|$|Geographic {{variation}} in the iliaca complex is minor compared to individual variation, both in morphology and molecular data samples. The western Yukon <b>fox</b> <b>sparrow</b> (Passerella iliaca zaboria) differs from the nominate subspecies, the eastern <b>fox</b> <b>sparrow</b> (Passerella iliaca iliaca) only in having a grayer head and browner malar stripe on average. The morphological distinction between the subspecies is not pronounced and the birds are not resident all year; therefore positive identification within the red <b>fox</b> <b>sparrow</b> complex is often not possible in the field, {{at least in some}} regions.|$|E

5000|$|Red <b>fox</b> <b>sparrows</b> may nest on the ground, or in {{shrubs and}} trees. They {{typically}} nest less than 2 metres off the ground. Clutch consists of 3-5 pale blue to pale green eggs that are thickly spotted with brown. Incubation lasts between 12 and 14 days.

50|$|Some of {{the animals}} {{that live in the}} Northeastern coastal {{deciduous}} forests are white-tailed deer, eastern gray squirrels, chipmunks, red <b>foxes,</b> <b>sparrows,</b> chickadees, Copperheads, rattlesnakes, northern water snakes, Box turtles, Snapping Turtles, garter snakes, snails, coyotes, black bears, beavers, woodchucks and raccoons. Chickadees, white-tailed deer, and eastern gray squirrels can be seen quite often. Gray wolves used to be quite common, but are extirpated, causing endemic growth in deer populations near suburban areas, with eastern coyotes generally taking their place by the mid-20th century.|$|R
50|$|It {{has been}} found that many boreal forest birds speciated due to {{glaciation}} and subsequent retreat, such as with North American sapsuckers (Yellow-bellied, Red-naped, and Red-breasted); the warbler's in the genus Setophaga (S. townsendii, S. occidentalis, and S. virens), Oreothlypis (O. virginiae, O. ridgwayi, and O. ruficapilla), and Oporornis (O. tolmiei and O. philadelphia now classified in the genus Geothlypis); <b>Fox</b> <b>sparrow's</b> (sub species P.

50|$|The sooty <b>fox</b> <b>sparrow</b> complex varies clinally in {{intensity}} of color. The upperparts and head are a variable shade of brown with streaks on the underparts {{of the same}} color. The northernmost birds are a sandy brown while southernmost birds are a dark coffee-like color. Sooties prefer to breed in willows and alders {{at the edge of}} wet habitats. Beadle & Rising (2003) describe their call note as a sharp zitt or thik, while Sibley (2000) says it is a loud smack like that of red <b>fox</b> <b>sparrow.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The sooty <b>fox</b> <b>sparrow</b> (Passerella (iliaca) unalaschcensis) {{contains}} the darkest-colored taxa in the genus Passerella. It is currently {{classified as a}} [...] "subspecies group" [...] within the <b>fox</b> <b>sparrow</b> pending wider-spread acceptance of species status. It has long been suspected to be a separate evolutionary lineage due to morphological distinctness (Swarth 1920), and this is confirmed by analysis of mtDNA sequence and haplotype data (Zink 1994, Zink & Kessen 1999, Zink & Weckstein 2003). This group appears to be most {{closely related to the}} thick-billed and/or slate-colored fox sparrows (Zink 1996, Zink & Weckstein 2003).|$|E
5000|$|However, {{the handful}} or so {{subspecies}} in this complex are poorly differentiated even morphologically {{for the most}} part; a two-subspecies arrangement recognizing the rather distinctive altivagans (the northern form) as distinct from the southern populations (schistacea) might be more reasonable (Rising & Beadle 1996). As with red and sooty <b>fox</b> <b>sparrows,</b> slate-coloreds also prefer to build their nests {{on the edges of}} wet habitat but are much less picky about in which plant they build. Their call note is sharp klink according to Rising & Beadle (1996), or [...] "a sharp smack, like Sooty and Red populations" [...] according to Sibley (2000).|$|R
40|$|Breeding {{within a}} seabird colony can have {{positive}} and negative effects for smaller passerine species. For example, they may profit from the anti-predator behavior of the seabirds {{as well as from}} the influx of food and nutrients brought into the community. However, these possible benefits might be offset by seabird predation. For instance, gulls are not only fierce defenders of their colony, but also opportunistic feeders. Here, we report predation of Glaucous-winged Gulls (Larus glaucescens) on Sooty <b>Fox</b> <b>Sparrows</b> (Passerella iliaca fuliginosa), Song Sparrows (Melospiza melodia), and a European Starling (Sturnus vulgaris), observed on Mandarte Island, British Columbia, Canada. These observations provide new evidence for dietary supplements of Glaucous-winged Gulls and for a disadvantage of passerine life in a Glaucous-winged Gull colony...|$|R
40|$|Trends {{in spring}} and fall arrival dates of birds {{migrating}} to their breeding (spring) and wintering (fall) grounds in Northern California vary among species. Over a 36 -year period at the Point Reyes Bird Observatory’s (PRBO) Palomarin Field Station on Point Reyes Peninsula, Wilson’s Warblers (Wilsonia pusilla) have been arriving significantly earlier in recent years, a pattern shown by several other songbird species (MacMynowski et al. 2007). In contrast, spring arrival dates of Swainson’s Thrushes (Catharus ustulatus) have been remarkably stable. Fall arrivals of Ruby-crowned Kinglets (Regulus calendula) from more northerly breeding grounds show a significant fit to a quadratic regression, arriving earlier from 1971 until the mid 1980 s, then reversing to arrive later in the fall. <b>Fox</b> <b>Sparrows</b> (Passerella iliaca) show a significant long-term trend toward earlier fall arrival dates. Arrival dates for all species vary from year to year, so trends are only apparent with long-term data. Why is this indicator important?

40|$|This was a long, cold winter, but {{effects on}} birds were not {{particularly}} noticeable. Perhaps the relative blandness of the reports reflected the 2 ̆ 2 normal 2 ̆ 2 behavior of most birds when confronted with a cold winter and the seriousness of survival: birds were in places they should have been. Carolina Wrens may have been hit (more on that in the Spring Report), but a few species were present in higher numbers than might have been expected. Rusty and Red-winged Blackbirds and Brown-headed Cowbird were notable for higher winter numbers, as were Snow Buntings. Even more so, {{there were lots of}} <b>Fox</b> <b>Sparrows,</b> including several wintering birds, and Yellow-bellied Sapsuckers were widespread in eastern Nebraska.

500|$|Todd Gilchrist feels Sparrow is {{the only}} element of the films that will remain timeless. According to Sharon Eberson, the character's {{popularity}} {{can be attributed to}} his being a [...] "scoundrel whose occasional bouts of conscience allow viewers to go with the flaws because, as played to the larger-than-life hilt by Depp, he owns every scene he is in". Film history professor Jonathan Kuntz attributed Sparrow's popularity to the increased questioning of masculinity in the 21st century, and Sparrow's personality contrasts with action-adventure heroes in cinema. Leonard Maltin concurs that Sparrow has a carefree attitude and does not take himself seriously. Mark <b>Fox</b> noted <b>Sparrow</b> is an escapist fantasy figure for women, free from much of the responsibility of most heroes. Sparrow is listed by IGN as one of their ten favorite film outlaws, as he [...] "lives for himself and the freedom to do whatever it is that he damn well pleases. Precious few film characters have epitomized what makes the outlaw such a romantic figure for audiences as Captain Jack Sparrow has." [...] Entertainment Weekly put it on its end-of-the-decade, [...] "best-of" [...] list, saying, [...] "Part Keith Richards rift, part sozzled lounge lizard, Johnny Depp's swizzleshtick pirate was definitely one of the most dazzling characters of the decade." [...] In June 2010, Sparrow was named one of Entertainment Weekly 100 Greatest Characters of the Last 20 Years.|$|R

[...] In 1777 however, though the vestry paid [...] "Didums 1 badger's head, 1 polecat's head; Hary Bell for 2 marten cats, and spares innumerable, and the clarck warges, 1 pounds 5s., there was 1 pounds 3s. in hand." [...] The polecats and marten cats were soon exterminated, but <b>foxes,</b> hedgehogs, and <b>sparrows</b> continue to appear, though in improved spelling, till April 24th, 1832, when this entry appears:--"At a meeting called to elect new Churchwardens, present the Rev.

Mr. Shuckburgh protests most strongly against the disgraceful custom of appropriating money collected for Church rates towards destroying vermin on the farms." [...] And this put an end to the custom. However, there were more rightful expenses. Before Easter there is paid [...] "for washan the surples" [...] 4s. It would seem that the Holy Communion was celebrated four times a year, and that the Elements were paid for every time at 3s. 7d. In 1784, when there was a great improvement in spelling, there were some repairs done--"Paid for Communion cloth, 10 pence, and for washing and marking it, 6p." [...] In 1786 there was a new church bell, costing 5 pounds 5s. 10d. Aaron Chalk, whom some of the elder inhabitants may remember, a very feeble old man walking with two sticks, was in that year one of the foremost traders in sparrow heads. It gives a curious sense of the lapse of time to think of those tottering limbs active in bird catching.|$|R
