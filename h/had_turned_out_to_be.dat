The film was shot in Europe, which <b>had</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the more profitable market for Dr. No. Most of the crew from the first film returned, with major exceptions being production designer Ken Adam—who {{went to work on}} Dr. Strangelove and was replaced by Dr. Nos art director Syd Cain—and title designer Maurice Binder, who was replaced by Robert Brownjohn.|$|E
5|$|Frank Spedding, {{celebrated for}} his {{development}} of the ion-exchange technology that revolutionized the rare-earth industry in the mid-1950s, once related {{the story of how}} he was lecturing on the rare earths in the 1930s, when an elderly gentleman approached him with an offer of a gift of several pounds of europium oxide. This was an unheard-of quantity at the time, and Spedding did not take the man seriously. However, a package duly arrived in the mail, containing several pounds of genuine europium oxide. The elderly gentleman <b>had</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Herbert Newby McCoy, who had developed a famous method of europium purification involving redox chemistry.|$|E

This meeting was fortuitous for all, as the band had already booked a venue for a dance night in two weeks time and unfortunately their then singer <b>had</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> somewhat average and had departed the scene. Band practice with Richards started the very next night, he did not disappoint.|$|E

Although there were still issues with the oil-fired boilers by late February, it was agreed to take the {{delivery}} of the new icebreaker on 2 March 1926 and solve the problems later as the winter of 1926 <b>had</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> very severe. Despite {{the best efforts of}} existing Finnish state-owned icebreakers, the ice conditions in the Gulf of Finland and the Sea of Åland were extremely difficult and vast pack ice fields closed off the shipping lanes outside the island of Utö {{at the edge of the}} Archipelago Sea.|$|E
500|$|Amongst the {{architectural}} community, the Exposition in Chicago inspired many in America to champion designing cities {{that had a}} unified design, in which each building had unique features but elegantly complemented its neighbours, typically by being built to a common height: [...] "horizontal visual unity". In {{the aftermath of the}} Exposition, many of these advocates joined with the Beaux-Arts movement to form the City Beautiful movement, proposing low-rise cities with wide boulevards, built in a classical style. These critics condemned New York's skyscrapers, Montgomery Schuyler describing how they had produced a [...] "horribly jagged sierra" [...] of a city skyline and complaining that no modern skyscraper <b>had</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an architectural success. Charles Lamb argued that the skyscraper impinged {{on the rights of the}} rest of the city by destroying the collective appearance of an urban area. Some architects, such as Charles McKim and Stanford White refused to work on such projects altogether.|$|E
500|$|On November 9 the {{expedition}} {{finally reached the}} Saint Lawrence at Pointe-Levi, {{across the river from}} Quebec. [...] Arnold had about 600of his original 1,100men, and the journey <b>had</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> 350miles (560km), not the180 that Arnold and Washington had thought it would be. [...] From John Halstead, a New Jersey-born businessman who operated a mill near Pointe-Levi, Arnold learned of the arrest of his courier and the interception of some of his letters. [...] Halstead's mill became the organizing point for the crossing of the Saint Lawrence. [...] Some of Arnold's men purchased canoes from the habitants and the local Saint Francis Indians, and then transported them from the Chaudière to the mill site. [...] The forces crossed the Saint Lawrence on the night of November 13–14 after three days of bad weather, likely crossing the mile-wide river between the positions of HMS Hunter and HMS Lizard, two Royal Navy ships that were guarding the river against such a crossing.|$|E

2500|$|The {{first big}} {{scientific}} debate about Marx's economic theory, {{starting in the}} 1890s, was the so-called [...] "breakdown controversy", in which the tendency toward falling profitability played an important role. The debate began, when the veteran German socialist leader Eduard Bernstein claimed {{that it was wrong}} to think that [...] "the end was nigh" [...] or that capitalism would collapse through a catastrophic breakdown. He aimed to show with facts and figures that Marx's analysis of the tendencies of capitalism <b>had</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> partly wrong. Bernstein believed that Marx's theory therefore had to be revised (this was known as the [...] "revisionist" [...] position). In response, numerous [...] "orthodox" [...] Marxist critics tried to prove that capitalism was necessarily doomed, at least in the long term. This controversy about the fate of the capitalist system still continues.|$|E
2500|$|These {{surprise}} attacks {{left the}} Georgians in confusion {{as to the}} identity of their attackers: the record of one contemporary chronicler indicates that he is unaware {{of the nature of}} the attackers and does not mention them by name. In 1223, when the Mongols had seemingly deferred their plans regarding Georgia, King George IV's sister and successor Queen Rusudan wrote in a letter to Pope Honorius III, that the Georgians had presumed the Mongols were Christians because they fought Muslims, but they <b>had</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> pagans. The Mongol invasion also inadvertently altered the fate of the 5th Crusade. Georgia had planned to send its splendid army to open up a second front in the north at the same time as the European crusaders invaded from the west. Because the Mongols annihilated the Georgian army, it could not help, and the European Crusaders spent critical time waiting inactively for their allies who would never come.|$|E

The balloon part of his story was unchanged, except for the detail added by Ozma, that the people probably saw his initials on his balloon and took them as a message {{that he was to}} be their king. She relates that the country was already named Oz (a word which in their language means [...] "great and good"), and that it was typical for the rulers to have names that are variations of Oz (King Pastoria being a notable exception to this rule).|$|E
