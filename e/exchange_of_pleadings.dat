50|$|Foreclosure by {{judicial}} sale, {{more commonly}} known as judicial foreclosure, which is available in every state (and required in many), involves {{the sale of the}} mortgaged property under the supervision of a court, with the proceeds going first to satisfy the mortgage; then other lien holders; and, finally, the mortgagor/borrower if any proceeds are left. Under this system, the lender initiates foreclosure by filing a lawsuit against the borrower. As with all other legal actions, all parties must be notified of the foreclosure, but notification requirements vary significantly from state to state. A judicial decision is announced after the <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> <b>pleadings</b> at a (usually short) hearing in a state or local court. In some rather rare instances, foreclosures are filed in federal courts.|$|E

40|$|Activism to {{help people}} facing the horrors of forced {{psychiatric}} drugging and electroshock. As {{set forth in the}} law review article, Involuntary Commitment and Forced Psychiatric Drugging in the Trial Courts: Rights Violations as a Matter of Course, by Jim Gottstein of PsychRights, 25 Alaska L. Rev. 51 (2008), "lawyers representing psychiatric respondents interpose little, if any, defense and are not discovering and presenting to judges the evidence of the harm to their clients. " In addition to lawyer indifference, most appointed lawyers do not have funding to obtain expert testimony even when they might want {{to do a good job}} for their clients. In trying to address this problem, PsychRights has agreed to make available certified copies of written testimony (affidavits) of Robert Whitaker 1 and Grace E. Jackson, MD., PsychRights filed in a couple of forced drugging cases, and has developed a generic set <b>of</b> <b>pleadings</b> wrapped around this testimony. 2 In order to use this, certified copies of the Whitaker and Jackson testimony must be obtained from MindFreedom.

As he knelt his great jack-boots clicked {{together}} with apprehension, and he poured forth in a piping voice, like that of a Lincoln's Inn mumper, a string <b>of</b> <b>pleadings,</b> excuses, and entreaties, as though I were Feversham in person, and was about to order him to instant execution.|$|R
50|$|Civil {{procedure}} {{is the body}} of law that sets out the rules and standards that courts follow when adjudicating civil lawsuits (as opposed to procedures in criminal law matters). These rules govern how a lawsuit or case may be commenced; what kind of service of process (if any) is required; the types <b>of</b> <b>pleadings</b> or statements <b>of</b> case, motions or applications, and orders allowed in civil cases; the timing and manner of depositions and discovery or disclosure; the conduct of trials; the process for judgment; various available remedies; and how the courts and clerks must function.|$|R
50|$|Different {{procedures}} {{apply in}} different courts. There {{is only a}} slight distinction between the procedures of the High Court {{and those in the}} Magistrate's Court; save where otherwise indicated, it is safe to assume that the form and content of the proceedings is the same. It is important to note, however, that both courts have their own empowering statutes and court rules. The Act, in each case, sets out what kinds of disputes may be heard by each court, and the rules prescribe how the disputes will be brought before court: that is to say, the form <b>of</b> <b>pleadings</b> and time limits.|$|R
50|$|Often {{enormously}} complicated matters, ICJ cases (of {{which there}} have been less than 150 since the court was created from the Permanent Court of International Justice in 1945) can stretch on for years and generally involve thousands <b>of</b> pages <b>of</b> <b>pleadings,</b> evidence, and the world's leading specialist public international lawyers. As of June 2009, there are 15 cases pending at the ICJ. Decisions made through other means of arbitration may be binding or non-binding depending {{on the nature of}} the arbitration agreement, whereas decisions resulting from contentious cases argued before the ICJ are always binding on the involved states.|$|R
50|$|Mani had {{appeared}} before the International Court of Justice as agent and counsel on several occasions. He was Legal Advisor to the Government of the Republic of Nauru in 1981-83 and again in 1985-90. He was directly involved in organising Nauru’s case against Australia before the International Court of Justice (1986-93). He {{was a member of}} the Indian legal team to the ICJ led by India’s Attorney-General, Soli Sorabjee, in Pakistan’s case against India (the Atlantique case) in 1999-2000. He was involved in the drafting <b>of</b> <b>pleadings</b> in at least four cases before the World Court (including the Nuclear Weapons case of 1996).|$|R
50|$|The {{court found}} {{additionally}} that, when disputes which had arisen such as would {{give rise to}} a variety of wide-ranging and substantial factual enquiries, the procedure under Rule 6(5)(g) of the Uniform Rules of Court was not appropriate. It was more appropriate to order the parties to trial. The affidavits in this case were not lengthy; they contained all the necessary averments and defined the issues with sufficient clarity. It would have been pointless, therefore, to order a filing <b>of</b> <b>pleadings.</b> The court, to save time and further expense, ordered the affidavits to stand as pleadings which were closed.|$|R
40|$|Curtailing the Pleadings. The common-law {{system of}} {{pleading}} contemplated successive pleadings in alternation by each party until an issue was reached upon which one party assumed the affirmative {{and the other}} party the negative. This process was to be followed no matter what time was thereby consumed. Under the code system of pleading, however, the purpose {{is not so much}} to obtain a narrow issue, as to have each party 2 ̆ 7 s view of the facts on record as concisely and as quickly as possible. This difference in purpose led to a striking difference in attitude towards the reply to the answer under the two systems. At common law the replication was a necessary part of the hierarchy <b>of</b> <b>pleadings</b> whenever the plea contained matter in confession and avoidance, i. e., new matter. It was, however, but one of a series <b>of</b> <b>pleadings</b> and might be followed in turn by the rejoinder, the surrejoinder, the rebutter, the surrebutter and further pleadings, if necessary. The plan of the code, on the other hand, was to cut off the 1 leadings quite sharply at the reply or before. Under the original code, the plaintiff might reply to new matter; but under many modern codes the reply either is not available or is available only in a limited class of cases. The result is that the issue is more quickly arrived at under the codes, but it is presumably a broader and more general one...|$|R
50|$|A demurrer is a {{pleading}} (usually {{filed by}} a defendant) which {{objects to the}} legal sufficiency of the opponent's pleading (usually a complaint) and demands that the court rule immediately about whether the pleading is legally adequate before the party must plead on the merits in response. Since demurrer procedure required an immediate ruling like a motion, many common law jurisdictions therefore went to a narrower understanding <b>of</b> <b>pleadings</b> as framing the issues in a case but not being motions in and of themselves, and replaced the demurrer with the motion to dismiss for failure to state a cause of action or the application to strike out particulars of claim.|$|R
