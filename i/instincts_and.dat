5|$|Feral {{horses are}} born {{and live in}} the wild, but are descended from domesticated animals. Many populations of feral horses exist {{throughout}} the world.

5|$|The wolves {{are kept}} in a human {{facility}} {{for a couple of}} months to be examined, and a wound on Oldtooth's paw is treated. In early winter, the wolves are sedated again and awaken to find themselves in a strange high place with radio collars around their necks. Still groggy from the tranquilizer, the strangeness of the events and the smell of grizzly bear in the area triggers Marta's flight <b>instincts</b> <b>and</b> she runs blindly downward, leaving Oldtooth and the cubs behind. When Oldtooth awakens, he quietly abandons Annie and Sula, following Marta's trail, but at a much slower pace.|$|E

5|$|In 1919 Davies married Margaret ("Madge") Eley from Cardiff; {{three daughters}} were {{subsequently}} born. The {{years following the}} First World War saw economic decline and hardship in the South Wales coalfields, conditions which deepened Davies's radical <b>instincts,</b> <b>and</b> he began to acquire a reputation for militancy. Contrary to mainstream Labour Party policy, Davies advocated workers' control rather than the nationalisation of the mining industry. In 1921 he unsuccessfully advocated affiliation of the Miners' Federation of Great Britain (MFGB, precursor of the National Union of Mineworkers or NUM) with the Red International of Labour Unions (RILU). The following year he was a delegate from the SWMF to the Second World Congress of the RILU in Moscow, and acquired a warm sympathy towards the Soviet system. He did not, however, join the recently formed Communist Party of Great Britain, and remained within the Labour Party.|$|E
5|$|Shining Armor, Princess Celestia and {{the others}} {{apologize}} to Twilight for not believing her, and Princess Celestia commends Twilight Sparkle, for it was her <b>instincts</b> <b>and</b> conviction to them that ultimately saved the day; she is heralded as the one, true hero. The wedding ceremony is quickly rescheduled, with Twilight eagerly overseeing preparations for a much happier and profoundly appreciative Cadance. Shining Armor and Princess Cadance are married, and a celebration ensues, with Twilight as the wedding singer ("Love is in Bloom"). During the ceremony and the reception, Twilight's ingering anxiety of losing touch with her brother is finally put to rest when Shining confesses that he persuaded Cadance to accept his proposal when he mentioned she would gain Twilight as a sister-in-law. Furthermore, just before the couple departs for their honeymoon, Shining thanks his sister for all she has done and the siblings reaffirm their love.|$|E

25|$|Overall, Rivers {{attributed}} the neuroses to both (i) the escape of painful <b>instincts</b> <b>and</b> their associated emotions from the unconscious and (ii) the mind's unsuccessful efforts to force such <b>instincts</b> <b>and</b> their emotions {{back into the}} conscious. While Rivers' theory contains some Freudian elements, {{it is not simply}} a restatement of psychoanalytic theory; Rivers' theory of the neuroses draws heavily on the neurological observations and conclusions Rivers and Henry Head drew from their work on nerve regeneration.|$|E

25|$|As a {{consequence}} of the debate over the viability of neo-Lamarckism, in 1896 James Mark Baldwin, Henry Fairfield Osborne and C. Lloyd Morgan all independently proposed a mechanism where new learned behaviors could cause the evolution of new <b>instincts</b> <b>and</b> physical traits through natural selection without resort to the inheritance of acquired characteristics. They proposed that if individuals in a species benefited from learning a particular new behavior, the ability to learn that behavior could be favored by natural selection, and the end result would be the evolution of new <b>instincts</b> <b>and</b> eventually new physical adaptations. This became known as the Baldwin effect and it has remained a topic of debate and research in evolutionary biology ever since.|$|E

25|$|In {{attempting}} to construct such an umbrella theory, Rivers accepted that the unconscious exists {{and that the}} contents of the unconscious are entirely inaccessible to a person except through the processes of hypnosis, dreaming, or psychoanalysis.
