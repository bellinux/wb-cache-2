Other differences are that online debit purchasers may opt to withdraw cash {{in addition to the}} amount of the debit purchase (if the merchant supports that functionality); also, from the merchant's standpoint, the merchant pays lower fees on online <b>debit</b> <b>transaction</b> as compared to [...] "credit" [...] (offline).|$|E

50|$|Because of this, in {{the case}} of a benign or {{malicious}} error by the merchant or bank, a <b>debit</b> <b>transaction</b> may cause more serious problems (for example, money not accessible; overdrawn account) than {{in the case}} of a credit card transaction (for example, credit not accessible; over credit limit). This is especially true in the United States, where check fraud is a crime in every state, but exceeding your credit limit is not.|$|E

50|$|A common {{misconception}} is that Girocard can be {{used for}} card-not-present payments.

50|$|The {{ability to}} use an ATM card for in-store EFTPOS {{purchases}} or refunds is no longer allowed, however, if the ATM card is also a debit card, it {{may be used for}} a pin-based <b>debit</b> <b>transaction,</b> or a non-pin-based credit-card transaction if the merchant is affiliated with the credit or debit card network of the card's issuer. Banks have long argued with merchants over the fees that can be charged by the bank for such transactions. Despite the fact that ATM cards require a PIN for use, banks have decided to permit the use of a non-PIN based card (debit or credit) for all merchant transactions.|$|E
50|$|The planned <b>debit</b> <b>transaction</b> fee {{increase}} is reportedly {{caused by the}} Durbin Amendment that went into effect on October 1, which is an addition to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, a U.S. federal statute The Durbin Amendment limits the fees that banks can charge merchants when a consumer swipes their debit card from 44 cents to 24 cents. According to experts, a customer making 25 debit card transactions a month would lead the bank to lose $5 {{it would have made}} before the Durbin Amendment. As a result, it has been suggested(by whom?) that the larger banks, including Wells Fargo and SunTrust, are making up for lost revenue by charging for debit card use, the cost ranging anywhere from $3 to $5 per month, although no specific cause/effect relationship has been established.|$|E
5000|$|To the consumer, a <b>debit</b> <b>transaction</b> is {{perceived}} as occurring in real-time; i.e. the money is withdrawn from their account immediately following the authorization request from the merchant, which in many countries, is the case when making an online debit purchase. However, when a purchase is made using the [...] "credit" [...] (offline debit) option, the transaction merely places an authorization hold on the customer's account; funds are not actually withdrawn until the transaction is reconciled and hard-posted to the customer's account, usually a few days later. However, the previous sentence applies {{to all kinds of}} transaction types, at least when using a card issued by a European bank. This is in contrast to a typical credit card transaction; though it can also have a lag time of {{a few days before the}} transaction is posted to the account, it can be many days to a month or more before the consumer makes repayment with actual money.|$|E

50|$|In some countries, like India and Sweden, the {{consumer}} protection {{is the same}} regardless of the network used. Some banks set minimum and maximum purchase sizes, mostly for online-only cards. However, {{this has nothing to}} do with the card networks, but rather with the bank's judgement of the person's age and credit records. Any fees that the customers have to pay to the bank are the same regardless of whether the transaction is conducted as a credit or as a <b>debit</b> <b>transaction,</b> so there is no advantage for the customers to choose one transaction mode over another. Shops may add surcharges to the price of the goods or services in accordance with laws allowing them to do so. Banks consider the purchases as having been made at the moment when the card was swiped, regardless of when the purchase settlement was made. Regardless of which transaction type was used, the purchase may result in an overdraft because the money is considered to have left the account at the moment of the card swiping.|$|E

40|$|This paper uses {{payments}} {{system data}} {{to study the}} impact on personal consumption expenditure, and therefore on economic activity, of occasional extreme events. The usual quarterly data supplied by central statistical agencies are of little use to policy makers for monitoring effects of transitory events, as the impacts of events lasting {{a few days or}} weeks may be obscured in time-aggregated data. However, technological advances of the past several years have resulted in new high-frequency data sources that could potentially provide more accurate and timely information on economic activity. Here we use daily Canadian <b>debit</b> <b>transaction</b> volume data, and business-day (five times per week) debit and check transaction volume and value data, to investigate the impact on consumer expenditure of several extreme events: the September 11 2001 terrorist attacks, the SARS epidemic in the spring of 2003, and the August 2003 electrical blackout. Contrary to initial perceptions of these events, we find only small and transitory effects. debit card transactions, macroeconomic monitoring, real-time data,...|$|E
