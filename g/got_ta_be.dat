40|$|Topographic {{attributes}} (TAs) play {{an important}} role in quantitatively describing the characteristics of landform and its structure. At present, <b>TAs</b> <b>are</b> classified from different views by many scientists being from various fields. However, there are still some urgent problems that need to <b>be</b> clarified about <b>TAs.</b> The relationships and differences of various <b>TAs</b> <b>are</b> not revealed and a mature, widely accepted and systematic classification has not been established. Based on previous research, <b>TAs</b> <b>are</b> systematically classified in this paper, taking consideration of systematic, hierarchical and practical principles. Firstly, <b>TAs</b> can <b>be</b> divided into global TAs and local TAs in the light of their descriptive spatial extent. Secondly, according to their algorithms, <b>TAs</b> <b>are</b> classified into basic TAs, compound TAs, features TAs and statistical <b>TAs.</b> Thirdly, <b>TAs</b> <b>are</b> distinguished into morphologic TAs and structural TAs according to their descriptive themes. Fourthly, on the basis of the relationship of TAs values and coordinate axes direction, <b>TAs</b> <b>are</b> grouped into geometrical TAs, isotropic TAs, axial TAs, and anisotropic TAs. Moreover, <b>TAs</b> can <b>be</b> labelled as first-order TAs, second-order TAs and multiple-order TAs by partial derivatives degree of elevation data. Being parameters of landform characteristics, <b>TAs</b> <b>are</b> the basis of quantitative geomorphologic research and essential indices that differentiate landform areas. So the classification is helpful in understanding the exact semantic meaning of TAs and their interrelationships for users. And it’s helpful in selecting effectively and reasonably TAs in practice. Besides, it’s helpful in solving some correlative problems in the research of digital terrai...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Triamcinolone acetonide (<b>TA)</b> <b>is</b> a steroidal {{drug that}} has been widely {{administered}} intravitreally for retinal and choroidal conditions. Safety of steroidal products for intraocular use is essential because of their risk of ocular adverse events. This review comprehensively discusses the safety of intravitreal administration of TA. Areas covered: This paper analyzes the mechanisms of action and key pharmacokinetic attributes and provides {{a discussion of the}} main clinical trials investigating clinical applications of intravitreal TA. The safety of intravitreal <b>TA</b> <b>is</b> evaluated through a search of the Medline database from 1980 to 2011. The most relevant literature on the safety of intravitreal <b>TA</b> <b>is</b> also discussed. Expert opinion: The complications of intravitreal TA therapy include secondary ocular hypertension in about 20 40 % of eyes, steroid-induced cataract in about 15 20 % of cases and postinjection infectious endophthalmitis and pseudoendophthalmitis in less than 1 %. <b>TA</b> <b>is</b> an effective drug for various retinal and choroidal diseases when delivered intravitreally. It may imply an off-label use and it may be associated with ocular adverse events. Intravitreal <b>TA</b> <b>is</b> not associated with significant systemic safety risks. © 2012 Informa UK, Ltd...|$|R
