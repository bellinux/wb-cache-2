5|$|After {{his return}} in August 1299, Lamberton was Guardian of Scotland and Nicholas became his close associate. Nicholas {{can be seen}} to <b>have</b> <b>benefited</b> as a result. He became Chancellor of Scotland by 30 January 1301. Balmyle's pension for being Chancellor was to be paid by Arbroath Abbey, for which the abbey later fell into arrears.|$|E
5|$|Like most concerts, tour venues <b>have</b> <b>benefited</b> from hosting concerts. North Carolina State University's {{agreement}} with Live Nation resulted in $166,000 in parking proceeds and $175,858 {{food and beverage}} concessions. Additionally Live Nation agreed to pay for replacing the sod {{on the football field}} where the stage and floor seating was located up to a cost of $250,000.|$|E
5|$|While {{many species}} of pigeons and doves <b>have</b> <b>benefited</b> from human {{activities}} and have increased their ranges, many other species have declined in numbers and some have become threatened or even succumbed to extinction. Among the ten species to have become extinct since 1600 (the conventional date for estimating modern extinctions) {{are two of the}} most famous extinct species, the dodo and the passenger pigeon.|$|E

5|$|Wilfrid's {{association}} with Cædwalla may <b>have</b> <b>benefited</b> him in other ways: the Life of Wilfrid {{asserts that the}} Archbishop of Canterbury, Theodore, expressed a wish that Wilfrid succeed him in that role, {{and if this is}} true it may be a reflection of Wilfrid's {{association with}} Cædwalla's southern overlordship.|$|E
5|$|A third {{theme of}} the work is the stress on the {{importance}} and number of distinguished burials that took place at Ely. They would have increased the desire of others to be buried there, which would <b>have</b> <b>benefited</b> the community by the donations that would have flowed from those wishing to secure their burial. The Liber stresses the burials of Æthelstan, a Bishop of Elmham, that of Ælfwine, another Bishop of Elmham, and Wulfstan II, an Archbishop of York.|$|E
5|$|Established in 1998, the Arts and Crafts Village is a children's {{cultural}} center with {{the objectives of}} promoting comprehensive, regular and periodic documentation of creative art {{in all of its}} forms. It interacted on a large scale with a class of artists from different nationalities and organized around 100 exhibitions for creative art, ceramics, graphics, carvings and others. Nearly 10,000 children from throughout the Gaza Strip <b>have</b> <b>benefited</b> from the Arts and Crafts Village.|$|E

The Perth Zoo has been monitoring a successful captive-breeding program since 1989. It has successfully bred more than 60 western quolls, most of which it transferred to Julimar Conservation Park, with proposals to translocate to Wheatbelt reserves and Shark Bay.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, Bahrain {{was named}} the world's fastest growing {{financial}} center by the City of London's Global Financial Centres Index. Bahrain's banking and financial services sector, particularly Islamic banking, <b>have</b> <b>benefited</b> from the regional boom driven by demand for oil. Petroleum production and processing is Bahrain's most exported product, accounting for 60% of export receipts, 70% of government revenues, and 11% of GDP. Aluminium production {{is the second most}} exported product, followed by finance and construction materials.|$|E
5|$|In the Amazon basin, when caimans became scarce as {{a result}} of {{overhunting}} in the mid-20th century, the number of local fish, such as the important arapaima (Arapaima gigas), also decreased. These are nutrient-poor waters, and the urine and faeces of the caimans may have increased primary production by contributing plant nutrients. Thus the presence of the reptiles could <b>have</b> <b>benefited</b> the fish stock; the number of crocodilians in a stretch of water appears to be correlated with the fish population.|$|E

5|$|In the meantime, on the Roman left wing, Severus {{must have}} {{suspected}} the prepared ambush, and held back from advancing into the woods, according to Ammianus. Libanius contradicts this, {{claiming that the}} Romans charged the enemy and flushed {{them out of their}} hiding places. But Ammianus' version is more likely, as the Romans would hardly <b>have</b> <b>benefited</b> from advancing straight into a prepared trap. Ammianus does not report further action in this sector. But {{it is likely that the}} hidden Germans eventually lost patience, advanced out of the woods and charged at Severus' division, only to be routed by Severus' crack troops.|$|E
5|$|Since 2004, Shepton Mallet's {{town centre}} {{buildings}} <b>have</b> <b>benefited</b> from two conservation schemes, the Heritage Economic Regeneration Scheme and the Townscape Heritage Initiative Scheme, which provided grants for the repair of buildings, reinstatement of architectural features and enhancement of public spaces, {{as well as}} community involvement, education and training. As the body which made the bid for the funding, Mendip District Council has administrated both schemes, but all decisions are made by a steering group comprising the main stakeholders in the town.|$|E
5|$|Some seabird species <b>have</b> <b>benefited</b> from fisheries, {{particularly}} from discarded fish and offal. These discards compose 30% {{of the food}} of seabirds in the North Sea, for example, and compose up to 70% of the total food of some seabird populations. This can have other impacts; for example, {{the spread of the}} northern fulmar through the United Kingdom is attributed in part to the availability of discards. Discards generally benefit surface feeders, such as gannets and petrels, to the detriment of pursuit divers like penguins.|$|E

5|$|The center serves 400 {{children}} and 250 adults each month, focusing its efforts on {{children and}} teens (ages 3–18) and young adults (ages 19–30).

Support groups are offered in Canby, Hillsboro, and Portland. In 2004, 140 volunteer facilitators donated more than 10,500 hours {{of service to the}} center. The organization employs a staff of around fifteen individuals, and is supported by an advisory board and board of directors.|$|E
5|$|The {{economic}} {{consequences for the}} county were more difficult to quantify. The financial impact on the county was estimated by the California Economic Forecast Director at $74 million if Line 901 remains dormant for three years because of the dependence of the region’s {{oil and gas industry}} to move product through this line. Workers income, property taxes, and federal royalties are reduced while the line is out of service. The impact on tourism was not as bad as predicted and thousands of workers involved in the cleanup appear to <b>have</b> <b>benefited</b> some hotels.|$|E
5|$|The {{population}} {{was able to}} quickly replace lost birds – {{there is a high}} proportion of non-breeding, non-territorial birds able to fill vacant territories. The habitat conserved with gamebirds in mind also suited this species and its prey; gamekeepers' more successful efforts to wipe out the northern goshawk and pine marten – predators of the Eurasian sparrowhawk – may <b>have</b> <b>benefited</b> it. The population increased markedly when this pressure was relaxed, for example during the First and Second World Wars.|$|E
