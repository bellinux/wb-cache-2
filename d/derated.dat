As a precaution, Cheyenne #9 (s/n 66-8834) was fitted with an ejection seat for the pilot after the March accident.

Prototype #9 also received an upgraded transmission and drivetrain, and a hinged rear canopy in place of the original sliding canopy around 1970. The new transmission allowed the T64-GE-16 turboshaft engine output to be increased from a <b>derated</b> 3,435horsepower (2,561kW) to 3,925horsepower (2,927kW). The new canopy eliminated the canopy vibrations.|$|E
5|$|Falling {{electricity}} production may be boosted through drilling additional supply boreholes, as at Poihipi and Ohaaki. The Wairakei power station {{has been running}} much longer, with its first unit commissioned in November 1958, and it attained its peak generation of 173MW in 1965, but already the supply of high-pressure steam was faltering, in 1982 being <b>derated</b> to intermediate pressure and the station managing 157MW. Around {{the start of the}} 21st century it was managing about 150MW, then in 2005 two 8MW isopentane systems were added, boosting the station's output by about 14MW. Detailed data are unavailable, being lost due to re-organisations. One such re-organisation in 1996 causes the absence of early data for Poihipi (started 1996), and the gap in 1996/7 for Wairakei and Ohaaki; half-hourly data for Ohaaki's first few months of operation are also missing, as well as for most of Wairakei's history.|$|E

50|$|In {{practice}} {{it is not}} possible to obtain the quoted theoretical maximum throughput rate for machines in a placement system. It is necessary to <b>derate</b> the theoretical numbers to obtain realistic values, due to unexpected downtime, board load and unload time and machine configuration. Other factors include PWB size, component mix, and the requirement for more complex vision recognition for fine-pitch components. There are many techniques of <b>derating.</b> Global <b>derating</b> considers system-wide stops, slow-downs and set ups as well as machine factors. To calculate the amount of global or system <b>derating,</b> one should take the average of the number of total components placed per hour in a long period (i.e. an entire product shift). Regularly scheduled stops should be included when determining the level of global <b>derating</b> the system requires.Rigorous <b>derating,</b> which considers each piece of equipment in service for a particular product individually, must be conducted by specific machine model for the line balancing. Rigorous <b>derating</b> values are necessary for full optimization of the process.|$|R

40|$|In this work, we {{characterize}} {{a significant}} source of software <b>derating</b> that we call instruction-level <b>derating.</b> Instruction-level <b>derating</b> encompasses the mechanisms by which computation on incorrect values can result in correct computation. We characterize the instruction-level <b>derating</b> that occurs in the SPEC CPU 2000 INT benchmarks, classifying it (by source) into six categories: value comparison, sub-word operations, logical operations, overflow/precision, lucky loads, and dynamically-dead values. We also characterize the temporal nature of this <b>derating,</b> demonstrating that the effects of a fault persist in architectural state long after the last time they are referenced. Finally, we demonstrate how this characterization can be used to avoid unnecessary error recoveries (when a fault will be masked by software anyway) {{in the context of a}} dual modular redundant (DMR) architecture...|$|R

40|$|Ensuring {{reliable}} operation {{over an extended}} period of time is one of the biggest challenges facing present day electronic systems. The increased vulnerability of the components to atmospheric particle strikes poses a big threat in attaining the reliability required for various mission critical applications. Various soft error mitigation methodologies exist to address this reliability challenge. A general solution to this problem is to arrive at a soft error mitigation methodology with an acceptable implementation overhead and error tolerance level. This implementation overhead can then be reduced by taking advantage of various <b>derating</b> effects like logical <b>derating,</b> electrical <b>derating</b> and timing window <b>derating,</b> and/or making use of application redundancy, e. g. redundancy in firmware/software executing on the so designed robust hardware. In this paper, we analyze the impact of various <b>derating</b> factors and show how they can be profitably employed to reduce the hardware overhead to implement a given level of soft error robustness. This analysis is performed on a set of benchmark circuits using the delayed capture methodology. Experimental results show upto 23 % reduction in the hardware overhead when considering individual and combined <b>derating</b> factors...|$|R

40|$|Soft {{errors are}} {{a growing concern}} for {{processor}} reliability. Recent studies have motivated architecture level studies of soft errors. It has been shown that the architecture level has a large <b>derating</b> effect on the raw processor error rate. In this paper, we quantify the impact of technology scaling on the processor soft error rate, taking the architecture level <b>derating</b> effects and workload characteristics into consideration. For our evaluation, we use SoftArch to quantify the <b>derating</b> factor and soft error rate (SER) for different structures in a modern superscalar processor running SPEC 2000 benchmarks. We compare the SERs across four different technologies ranging from 180 nm to 65 nm with the same microarchitecture. We find that with scaling, the <b>derating</b> factors for logic structures often decrease, the <b>derating</b> factors for storage elements remain roughly unchanged, and the FIT rate for the full processor roughly follows the trend for the raw SER of storage structures (i. e., the FIT rate. increases from 180 nm to 90 nm and decreases from 90 nm to 65 nm. ...|$|R

25|$|Two {{years prior}} to the Hawker Henley's arrival (Summer 1941) a Supermarine Spitfire Mk II, P7674 had been {{delivered}} to Hucknall and was fitted with a Crecy mock-up to enable cowling drawings and system details to be designed. It had been agreed that the first production Spitfire Mk III would be delivered to Hucknall in early 1942 minus its Merlin engine for fitment of an airworthy Crecy, but this delivery did not occur. A Royal Aircraft Establishment report (No. E.3932) of March 1942 estimated the performance of the Spitfire fitted with a Crecy engine and compared this to a Griffon 61-powered variant. The report stated that the Crecy's maximum power output would be too much for the Spitfire airframe but that a <b>derated</b> version would have considerable performance gains over the Griffon-powered fighter.|$|E
25|$|The 206L LongRanger is a {{stretched}} variant with {{seating for}} seven. The fuselage, stretched {{a total of}} , adds two rear-facing seats between {{the front and rear}} seats. Since 1975, Bell has produced more than 1,700 LongRangers across all variant types. In 1981, a military version was released, the 206L TexasRanger. The original 206L used an Allison 250-C20B engine, and a series of model upgrades replaced this engine with more powerful versions; the 206L-1 used a 250-C28, and the 206L-3 and 206L-4 used the 250-C30P. In both applications, the 250-C30P is <b>derated</b> from 650hp for takeoff and 501hp continuous. The 206L-3 is transmission–limited to 435hp for take-off, and the 206L-4 is transmission-limited to 495hp. The derating of the C30P produces an advantage in hot-day and high-altitude operations as it can produce the rated horsepower at higher altitudes and temperatures where applications that use the maximum rating of the engine at sea level suffer accelerated performance deterioration with increases in temperature and altitude. The 206L-3 and L-4 have not been offered in a twin configuration under those model designations.|$|E
25|$|Long {{aluminium}} beadings on {{the sides}} were painted cream, a visual device to make the locomotive's high sides appear more slender {{and add to the}} impression of speed. Three curved chevrons on each nose, in the same cream, added to that effect. To British eyes, the locomotive's styling was reminiscent of American locomotives, such as the EMD E-unit or ALCO PA designs (partly because English Electric initially planned to offer the type for export), with high noses and small, somewhat swept-back cab windows set behind them. To add to the American look of the locomotive, a large headlight was to have been fitted to each nose (the lights were never installed but would have been of the rotating 'Mars Light' type as fitted to North American locomotives of the era). Two 18-cylinder Deltic engines were fitted, <b>derated</b> from the 1,750 horsepower (1.3 MW) of the marine engines in minesweepers to 1,650 horsepower (1.2 MW) each, generating 3,300 horsepower (2.5 MW) total.
