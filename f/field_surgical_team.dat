The unit departed Canada in November 1942 for England where it received its full complement of vehicles and other equipment. In January 1943 the unit was designated 13 Canadian Field Dressing Station providing the nucleus, with attached <b>field</b> <b>surgical</b> <b>teams</b> and <b>field</b> transfusion teams, for an advanced surgical centre.|$|R
5000|$|The {{military}} commanders {{on the ground}} (rather than the UK Ministry of Defence) suggested {{the implementation of a}} [...] "hearts and minds" [...] campaign, which would be put into operation primarily by a troop (25 men) from the SAS. The British government (then under Conservative leader Edward Heath) supported this unconventional approach to the counterinsurgency campaign. It approved the deployment of 20 personnel of the British Royal Engineers, who would aid in the construction of schools and health centres, and drilled wells for the population of Dhofar. Royal Army Medical Corps <b>Field</b> <b>Surgical</b> <b>Teams</b> and some Royal Air Force medical teams would also operate out of Salalah hospital, in order to open a humanitarian front in the conflict. The operation was almost a carbon copy of a system that had proved successful in the Malayan Emergency some twenty years previously. The British government additionally provided monetary support for the creation of the Dhofar Development Programme, whose aim was to wrest support from the PFLOAG through the modernisation of Dhofar.|$|R

40|$|Background: High-performing and high-reliability {{teams are}} an {{important}} component of service delivery. With a focused emphasis on safety in acute care hospitals, understanding the nature of <b>surgical</b> <b>teams</b> and team performance is an essential component to achieving high-quality surgical care. More information is needed about the challenges to effective team functioning in the operating room, the influence of working conditions, and the environmental context on <b>surgical</b> <b>team</b> performance. Purpose: The {{purpose of this study is}} to describe the nature of <b>surgical</b> <b>teams</b> and how they perform in the operating room to contribute to a broader knowledge about high-performing and high-reliability teams in health care settings. Methodology/Approach: We conducted a qualitative study involving direct observation and semistructured interviews. Field observations of 10 high-complexity surgeries and face-to-face interviews with 26 members of <b>surgical</b> <b>teams</b> were completed at one university medical center. A conceptual framework derived from the literature was developed to guide the selection of surgeries and <b>surgical</b> <b>teams</b> to be observed.

40|$|Objectives: Since {{the advent}} of endonasal skull base surgery, {{internal}} carotid artery (ICA) injury has been considered the most dramatic and challenging intraoperative complication. A large vascular injury creates an immediately challenging surgical scenario with rapid blood loss that may result in exsanguination of the patient. Recently we have developed an animal model of the endoscopic, endonasal vascular injury. We describe important surgical steps required in managing the <b>surgical</b> <b>field</b> during a catastrophic vascular event. Methods: A total of 42 endoscopic carotid artery injuries and 25 endoscopic venous injuries were performed. Throughout the injuries, the "two-surgeon" technique was used to achieve <b>surgical</b> <b>field</b> control. Videoendoscopy was performed throughout the implementation of these surgical techniques. Results: Techniques found useful in controlling the <b>surgical</b> <b>field</b> included the two-surgeon technique, careful selection of the most appropriate nostril for endoscope positioning, large bore suction placement, suction guidance of the vascular stream through the contralateral nostril, and avoidance of suction obstruction. Only once the <b>surgical</b> <b>field</b> could be controlled can the injury site be addressed. Conclusions: Controlling the endoscopic endonasal <b>surgical</b> <b>field</b> during vascular injuries relies on {{the cooperation of the}} <b>surgical</b> <b>team</b> and a step-based approach including careful endoscopic maneuvering within the nasal corridor, and appropriate suction selection and positioning with respect to the endoscope.

30|$|Although {{there was}} minimal output from the {{drainage}} tube, our <b>surgical</b> <b>team</b> suspected cauda equina incarceration {{or the other}} unknown cause of seizure in the <b>surgical</b> <b>field,</b> because they knew that any neurologic manifestation could appear by intracranial hypotension after spinal surgeries [5, 6]. Six hours after the initial surgery, the patient was taken back to the surgical suite to confirm and repair a suspected spinal dural laceration. The re-opened <b>surgical</b> <b>field</b> was wet with diluted blood. We suspected that the blood was diluted with the leaked CSF, because the fluid over there might not have the others of the CSF. However, an evident point of dural laceration was not found. There was no cauda equina incarceration. The dura was covered with fibrin glue.|$|R

40|$|Background: Experiences from {{practice}} in surgical units {{led us to}} question what makes teamwork effective and elegant, and also reflect upon the causes of situations where the teamwork is less than optimal and team members become frustrated. Purpose and research question: We based our research design {{on some of the}} relational factors defined in Reeves et al. (2010) conceptual framework for interprofessional teamwork. This was done to explore how surgical nurses experience these factors in relation to cooperation in <b>surgical</b> <b>teams.</b> We chose the following research question: How do surgical nurses experience the relational factors of cooperation in <b>surgical</b> <b>teams?</b> Method: We used qualitative methods in this study. Data collection was conducted using semi-structured interviews. Our data material consists of interviews with nine theatre nurses. We analysed the material using qualitative content analysis as outlined by Graneheim and Lundman (2004). Results: Our results show that theatre nurses find cooperation in <b>surgical</b> <b>teams</b> to be characterized by members from different occupational groups who closely cooperate for several hours in the same room. Relational factors with attitudes, emotions and reactions in the <b>surgical</b> <b>team</b> are therefore enhanced, and have a large influence on team members and team cooperation in both positive and negative ways.

40|$|Exposure {{to certain}} {{bloodborne}} pathogens can prematurely end a person’s life. Healthcare workers (HCWs), {{especially those who}} are members of <b>surgical</b> <b>teams,</b> are at increased risk of exposure to these pathogens. The proper use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during operative/invasive procedures reduces that risk. Despite this, some HCWs fail to consistently use PPE as required by federal regulation, accrediting agencies, hospital policy, and professional association standards. The purpose of this mixed methods survey study was to (a) examine factors <b>surgical</b> <b>team</b> members perceive influence choices of wearing or not wearing PPE during operative/invasive procedures and (b) determine what would influence consistent use of PPE by <b>surgical</b> <b>team</b> members. ^ Using an ex post facto, non-experimental design, the memberships of five professional associations whose members comprise <b>surgical</b> <b>teams</b> were invited to complete a mixed methods survey study. The primary research question for the study was: What differences (perceptual and demographic) exist between <b>surgical</b> <b>team</b> members that influence their choices of wearing or not wearing PPE during operative/invasive procedures?^ Four principal differences were found between <b>surgical</b> <b>team</b> members. Functional (i. e., profession or role based) differences exist between the groups. Age and experience (i. e., time in profession) differences exist among members of the groups. Finally, being a nurse anesthetist influences the use of risk assessment to determine the level of PPE to use. ^ Four common themes emerged across all groups informing the two study purposes. Those themes were: availability, education, leadership, and performance. ^ Subsidiary research questions examined the influence of previous accidental exposure to blood or body fluids, federal regulations, hospital policy and procedure, leaders’ attitudes, and patients’ needs on the use of PPE. Each of these was found to strongly influence <b>surgical</b> <b>team</b> members and their use of PPE during operative/invasive procedures. ^ Implications based on the findings affect organizational policy, purchasing and distribution decisions, curriculum design and instruction, leader behavior, and finally partnership with PPE manufacturers. <b>Surgical</b> <b>team</b> members must balance their innate need to care for patients with their need to protect themselves. Results of this study will help team members, leaders, and educators achieve this balance. ...|$|R
