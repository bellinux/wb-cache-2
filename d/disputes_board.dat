50|$|While {{the origins}} of <b>Dispute</b> Review <b>Boards</b> {{are found in the}} {{construction}} industry, their ambit is far wider than construction and <b>Dispute</b> Review <b>Boards</b> are now found in the financial services industry, the Maritime Industry, long-term concession projects, operational and maintenance contracts. The scope for <b>Dispute</b> Review <b>Boards</b> is substantial. The emergence of the International Chamber of Commerce as an active supporter of <b>Dispute</b> <b>Boards,</b> as well as the <b>Dispute</b> <b>Board</b> Federation and the <b>Dispute</b> Resolution <b>Board</b> Foundation, makes it highly probable that <b>dispute</b> <b>boards</b> will be established in a range of industries that, until now, have not used adjudication to any great extent.|$|R
50|$|The terms <b>Dispute</b> <b>Board</b> or <b>Dispute</b> Review <b>Board</b> are generic {{terms and}} include (a) the <b>Dispute</b> Review <b>Board</b> (DRB) {{which is a}} device that {{originated}} in the USA and provides non-binding recommendations); (b) the <b>Dispute</b> Adjudication <b>Board</b> (DAB) which is a device emerging from the earlier USA model, but which provides a decision that has interim-binding force); and (c) the Combined <b>Dispute</b> <b>Board</b> (CDB), which is a hybrid of <b>Dispute</b> Review <b>Boards</b> and <b>Dispute</b> Adjudication <b>Boards</b> which {{was created by the}} International Chamber of Commerce in 2004. Various other terms have been used such as Dispute Settlement Panel, <b>Dispute</b> Mediation <b>Board,</b> <b>Dispute</b> Avoidance Panel and Dispute Conciliation Panel. Fundamentally these different varieties of Dispute Review devices are the same, each providing early adjudication based on the contractual bargain between the parties.|$|R
50|$|A <b>dispute</b> <b>board</b> or <b>dispute</b> review <b>board</b> (DRB) or <b>dispute</b> {{adjudication}} <b>board</b> (DAB) is a 'job-site' dispute adjudication process, typically comprising three {{independent and}} impartial persons {{selected by the}} contracting parties. The significant difference between <b>Dispute</b> Review <b>Boards</b> and most other Alternate Dispute Review techniques (and possibly the reason why or <b>Dispute</b> Review <b>Boards</b> have had such success in recent years) is that the <b>Dispute</b> Review <b>Board</b> is appointed at the commencement of a project before any disputes arise and, by undertaking regular visits to the site, is actively involved throughout the project (and possibly any agreed period thereafter).|$|R
50|$|<b>Dispute</b> <b>boards</b> are {{independent}} bodies {{designed to help}} resolve disagreements arising {{during the course of}} a contract.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>Dispute</b> Review <b>Board</b> is a {{creature}} of contract; the parties establish and empower a <b>Dispute</b> Review <b>Board</b> with jurisdiction to hear and advise on the resolution of disputes. Within the United Kingdom {{it is entirely possible}} for the contracting parties to establish a <b>Dispute</b> Review <b>Board</b> to adjudicate construction contract disputes within the statutory requirement for adjudication [...] As yet, there are no statutory requirements for <b>Dispute</b> Review <b>Boards</b> to be established to adjudicate disputes under construction contracts.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>Dispute</b> <b>Board</b> {{becomes a}} part of the project {{administration}} and thereby can influence, during the contract period, the performance of the contracting parties. It has 'real-time' value. The idea behind a standing <b>Dispute</b> Resolution <b>Board</b> is that it may be called upon early in the evolution of any dispute which cannot be resolved by the parties and be asked to publish decisions or recommendations on how the matters in issue should be settled. It is usual (but not compulsory) that an opportunity remains for the matter to be referred to arbitration or to the courts if the <b>Dispute</b> Review <b>Board's</b> decision does not find acceptance by the parties. Thus a <b>Dispute</b> Resolution <b>Board</b> may be likened to the United Kingdom's adjudication process, either under statutory-compliant contracts or under the regime established by statute itself [...] What a <b>Dispute</b> Review <b>Board</b> does that United Kingdom statutory adjudication does not do is to provide a regular and continuing forum for discussion of difficult or contentious matters, to identify ways forward by acting in an informal capacity and to create valuable opportunities for the parties to avoid disputes by keeping proactive communication alive. Another aspect, which is less often discussed, is that by establishing a <b>Dispute</b> <b>Board</b> from the inception of the project the <b>Dispute</b> <b>Board</b> members become part of the project team and are thought of in a different fashion and because of their [...] "hands on" [...] approach can be trusted to be fair and impartial and their advise respected and taken more readily than would a third party or stranger to the project.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{performed}} mainly to introduce <b>Dispute</b> <b>Board</b> (DB) {{as the one}} of the many Alternative Dispute Resolutions (ADRs) to be applied into the Malaysian construction industry to reduce and minimize the amount of disputes. This research is carried out by interviewing nine respondents which consist of registered Quantity Surveyors. Litigation and arbitration has been widely applied in Malaysia for dispute settlement. Both methods, however, do become more tedious and arduous processes to go through to resolve disputes. Mediation, on the other hand, has been a new alternative for dispute settlement in the Malaysian construction industry. Nevertheless, arbitration and mediation have not yet made a big impact in the numbers of disputes arising in the Malaysian construction industry. Therefore, this paper unveils the viability of implementing <b>Dispute</b> <b>Board</b> as a better and more efficient method of ADR that is determined in the outset of the project. <b>Dispute</b> <b>Board</b> is able {{to reduce the amount of}} disputes arising in the Malaysian construction industry...|$|R

40|$|In {{looking after}} the company’s best interests, the board’s role {{includes}} ensuring that its company has dispute resolution systems and processes. At times, {{and particularly in}} cases involving corporate governance issues, the board should also be engaged in preventing and effectively resolving disputes that could harm the company’s reputation, operations, results, and share value, or that could disrupt the board’s own operations. Good governance and sound risk management call for boards to think ahead and develop proper policies and effective ways to address internal or external corporate governance <b>disputes.</b> <b>Boards</b> may face the potential danger that normal disagreements within the boardroom could remain unresolved, fester, and then ripen into disputes. While boardroom debate should be encouraged, it must proceed in an orderly and constructive manner, recognizing that a means of resolving disputes and arriving collaboratively at a unified conclusion is essential to conduct business.

50|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that the cost of a <b>Dispute</b> <b>Board</b> will result in even the most strenuous dispute being {{resolved}} and with an almost 99% success rate of dispute resolution without the need for either costly litigation or arbitration the savings are enormous. The reason this is significant is because the construction industry has a reputation for disputes and conflict. Anecdotal evidence from Australia, as just one example, indicates that 50% of all legal cost associated with construction is expended in connection with disputes. In almost 10% of projects, between 8% and 10% of the total project cost was legal cost. Not surprisingly, these projects have a high incidence of disputes. This expenditure, which globally represents an enormous sum each year, does not begin to take into account the hidden costs of disputes; the damage to reputations and commercial relationships, the cost of time spent by executive personnel, and the cost of lost opportunities. The situation is aggravated by the increased use of joint ventures both in consulting and in contracting. Such organisations are less autonomous and perhaps less able to negotiate settlements of their contractual problems.|$|R
5000|$|War industry’s {{major problem}} was the {{scarcity}} of skilled workers, therefore 125,000 men were released from {{the armed forces and}} trained workers were no longer conscripted. OHL wanted to enroll most German men and women into national service, but the Reichstag legislated that only males 17-60 were subject to “patriotic service” and refused to bind war workers to their jobs. Groener realized that they needed the support of the workers, so he insisted that union representatives be included on industrial <b>dispute</b> <b>boards.</b> He also advocated an excess profits tax. The industrialists were incensed. On 16 August 1917 Ludendorff telegraphed an order reassigning Groener to command the 33rd Infantry Division. Overall, “Unable to control labour and unwilling to control industry, the army failed miserably...” (actually the government did control industry with its edicts and orders - and the result was disaster). To the public it seemed that that Ludendorff was running the nation as well as the war. According to Ludendorff, “… the authorities … represented me as a dictator …” [...] He would not become Chancellor because the demands for running the war were too great. The historian Frank B. Tipton argues that while not technically a dictator, Ludendorff was [...] "unquestionably {{the most powerful man in}} Germany" [...] in 1917-18.|$|R

50|$|The Board uses {{a variety}} of {{techniques}} intended to shorten and simplify, when appropriate, the formal proceedings normally used to resolve contract <b>disputes.</b> The <b>Board</b> fully supports the use of alternative dispute resolution (ADR) in all appropriate cases; it encourages the prompt, expert, and inexpensive resolution of contract disputes as promoted by the Administrative Dispute Resolution Act. In addition, the Board provides to other Executive agencies, when jointly requested by an agency and its contractor, alternative dispute resolution services on contract-related matters, whether arising before or after a contract has been awarded.|$|R

40|$|FIDIC {{has over}} the years {{produced}} standard forms of contracts for the international procurement of projects. A source of continuing criticism of its Red Book concerns the duality in the traditional role of the engineer as the employer's agent and as an independent third party holding the balance fairly between the employer and the contractor. In response to this and other criticisms FIDIC produced a replacement for it in 1999. The role of the engineer under the new Red Book is critically examined {{in the light of}} relevant case law, expert commentaries and feedback from two multidisciplinary workshops with international participation. The examination identified three major changes: (1) a duty to act impartially {{has been replaced by a}} duty to make fair determination of certain matters; (2) it is open to parties to allow greater control of the engineer by the employer by stating in the appropriate part of the contract powers the engineer must not exercise without the employer's approval; (3) there is provision for a <b>Dispute</b> Adjudication <b>Board</b> (DAB) to which disputes may be referred. Although the duality has not been eliminated completely, the contract is structured flexibly enough to support those who wish to contract on the basis of the engineer acting solely as the agent of the employer.
