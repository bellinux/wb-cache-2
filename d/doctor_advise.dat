40|$|Objectives: The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore the beliefs and {{perceptions}} of older people about falls injury prevention services, and to identify incentives and barriers to attending falls prevention services, including programs targeting physical activity. Methods: Seventy-five people over age 60 years who were members of community groups completed a 23 -item survey that was returned by mail. Survey items included self-reported falls and confidence when walking, awareness of falls prevention strategies, desirable programs for a falls prevention service, and incentives and barriers to participation in physical activity programs. Results: Twenty-eight per cent of respondents had fallen within the previous 6 months, yet just over half (54 %) were aware there were strategies to prevent falling, despite the majority of the sample being physically active (81 %) and at least reasonably confident about walking (84 %). The features that were considered most desirable for a falls prevention service were group exercise programs (61 %), educational talks about health issues (57 %), and vision/eye glasses assessment (52 %). The most commonly reported incentives for attending a physical activity group included having a <b>doctor</b> <b>advise</b> them to attend (61 %) or having a friend who attended the group (55 %), and the most common barrier to attending a physical activity group was transportation (43 %). Conclusions: Despite consistent numbers of older people experiencing falls, there is little awareness among older people that strategies exist to prevent falling. It appears that motivating older people to participate in physical activity with the aim of falls prevention will largely depend on the encouragement of their doctor or their peers...|$|E

40|$|During {{the first}} six months of the new millennium, there have been two {{widespread}} out breaks of viral fever, self-limiting and free of complications, but unfortunately causing panic in households as well as in doctors. An attempt is now being made in this personal view, to allay fears in doctors and hopefully through them, in households regarding acute onset fevers. Apart from paracetamol what else can a <b>doctor</b> <b>advise</b> without resorting to inappropriate treatment with antibiotics? This article concerns a child who hitherto was well and who develops a fever with perhaps mild general symptoms like lassitude, occasional unformed stools, runny nose, sore throat, mild cough, chills, food refusal and diminished childhood activity, but with no abnormal physical signs in every system. This article is not about ill-looking children, with significant diarrhoea, vomiting, reduced urine output, altered sensorium, stiff neck, grunting or altered respiration, severe abdominal pain, tenderness and guarding, hepatomegaly, abnormal chest signs, lymphadenopathy or evidence of any obvious bacterial infection. It is about a well child with fever and little else. Fever causes panic even in the best regulated families. Regulation of body temperature is achieved by balancing heat production and heat loss. The hypothalamus is the control centre. The body temperature is maintained in health at a set point. In fever, this set point is elevated and antipyretics promote its return to normal. In fever there is increased formation of cytokines and this induces synthesis of prostaglandins. During fever there is a biosynthesis of pro- inflammatory, proalgesic prostaglandins PGE 2 and PGI 2. Prostaglandins are released when cells are damaged and cause increased blood flow and erythema. Antipyretics inhibit the biosynthesis through enzymes, namely cyclooxygenase 1. Non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) inhibit different types of cyclooxygenase, and therefore the biosynthesi...|$|E
