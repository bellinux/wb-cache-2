5000|$|Picking up on Freire's {{definition}} of critical consciousness, Joe L. Kincheloe has expanded the {{definition of}} the concept in his work on postformalism. In Kincheloe's formulation postformalism connects cognition to critical theoretical questions of power and social justice. In this context Kincheloe constructs a critical theory of cognition that explores questions of meaning, emancipation vis-a-vis ideological inscription, and a particular focus on the socio-political construction of the self. With these concerns in mind Kincheloe's postformal critical consciousness engages questions of purpose, issues of human dignity, freedom, authority, reconceptualized notions of reason, intellectual quality, and social responsibility. Postformal critical consciousness stimulates a conversation between critical pedagogy and a wide range of social, cultural, political economic, psychological, and philosophical concerns. Kincheloe employs this [...] "multilogical conversation" [...] to shape new modes of self-awareness, more effective forms of social, political, and pedagogical action, and an <b>elastic</b> <b>model</b> of an evolving critical consciousness (Kincheloe and Steinberg, 1993; Kincheloe, 1999; Thomas and Kincheloe, 2006).|$|E

The differences of stress are studied with two kinds of different constitutive models, i. e. <b>elastic</b> <b>model</b> and nonlinear <b>elastic</b> <b>model,</b> and meanwhile, the influences of the height of dam and {{diaphragm wall}} for this two constitutive models are also compared. The results show that, the variation laws of the stress of diaphragm wall are similar for both of the models. But, the stress computed by nonlinear <b>elastic</b> <b>model</b> is much smaller than <b>elastic</b> <b>model</b> does. Under the condition of low stress, the results are similar for the two models, but have big differences for high stress. In addition, for this two models, with the increasing of height of dam and diaphragm wall, the maximal values of the stress are increasing constantly, and relative error of the maximal value of the stress as well, which have the linear relation with the height of dam and diaphragm wall.

30|$|Although asphalt behaves {{more like}} a {{viscoelastic}} material, for simplicity, it was considered appropriate to use a linear <b>elastic</b> <b>model</b> for the analysis. As observed by Sousa et al. [5], two major factors are of particular interest in the mechanical analysis of hot-mix asphalt: the material characterisation method and its accuracy in reflecting the material resistance to loading and the accuracy of mechanistic models to predict the pavement performance. Nesnas and Nun [6] {{in their study of}} top-down reflection cracking found that the linear <b>elastic</b> <b>model</b> was able to give explanation for the field observation that the reflection crack can initiate at the surface and propagate downwards. Portillo [7] used the linear elastic software EVERSTRESS and the finite element software Abaqus to predict the pavement responses using linear elastic and visco-elastic models. He found that the results from the linear elastic analyses (EVERSTRESS) were similar to the measured pavement response values, except for vertical pressures, whilst the results from the visco-elastic finite element model (FEM) were much smaller than the measured values. His results for the linear <b>elastic</b> <b>model</b> in Abaqus were similar to the ones from EVERSTRESS. He stated that the problem with the visco-elastic modelling might be the prony series parameters used for the analysis. Bekheet et al. [8] modelled the in situ shear strength testing of asphalt concrete pavements using linear <b>elastic</b> <b>model</b> in Abaqus and found that the correlation between the field results and each of the FEMs and the mathematical models was very high (with correlation factor of 86  %).

Therefore, the linear <b>elastic</b> <b>model</b> was considered appropriate for this study.|$|E
