In Player Piano, the computer EPICAC is given control of the nuclear arsenal, and is charged with deciding whether to use high-explosive or nuclear arms.

25|$|Shellcode {{cannot be}} {{executed}} directly. In order to analyze what a shellcode attempts {{to do it}} must be loaded into another process. One common analysis technique <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> a small C program which holds the shellcode as a byte buffer, and then use a function pointer or use inline assembler to transfer execution to it. Another technique is to use an online tool, such as shellcode_2_exe, to embed the shellcode into a pre-made executable husk which can then be analyzed in a standard debugger. Specialized shellcode analysis tools also exist, such as the iDefense sclog project which was originally released in 2005 {{as part of the}} Malcode Analyst Pack. Sclog is designed to load external shellcode files and execute them within an API logging framework. Emulation based shellcode analysis tools also exist such as the sctest application {{which is part of the}} cross platform libemu package. Another emulation based shellcode analysis tool, built around the libemu library, is scdbg which includes a basic debug shell and integrated reporting features.|$|E

500|$|In {{the second}} instance, {{breaking}} the scheme {{is even more}} straightforward. Since {{there are only a}} limited number of possible shifts (26 in English), they can each be tested in turn in a brute force attack. One way to do this <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> out a snippet of the ciphertext in a table of all possible shifts – a technique sometimes known as [...] "completing the plain component". The example given is for the ciphertext [...] "EXXEGOEXSRGI"; the plaintext is instantly recognisable by eye at a shift of four. Another way of viewing this method is that, under each letter of the ciphertext, the entire alphabet is written out in reverse starting at that letter. This attack can be accelerated using a set of strips prepared with the alphabet written down in reverse order. The strips are then aligned to form the ciphertext along one row, and the plaintext should appear in one of the other rows.|$|E

[...] "Use reality as the springboard to whatever you're writing about", Paul said. Paul also says that being a successful songwriter is like being a journalist who writes about what he sees and knows, the times people are living in and the things people are facing today. [...] "The journalist {{looks out the window}} and writes about what is really happening." [...] "I make sure it's real. [...] I don't want to fictionalize about things I haven't witnessed." [...] Paul states that over the years he's learned the value of simplicity in writing. He's learned that he can say more when he writes more simply and direct. [...] "It's almost as if you can be complex and intricate by adopting a shorter, less complicated structure." [...] "I'm not doing rocket science -- I'm a storyteller", he said. [...] "I hope to inspire people to think and feel and to walk out with more than they came in with." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{several of}} García Márquez's works, {{including}} No One Writes to the Colonel, In Evil Hour, and Leaf Storm, he referenced La Violencia (the violence), [...] "a brutal {{civil war between}} conservatives and liberals that lasted into the 1960s, causing the deaths of several hundred thousand Colombians". Throughout all of his novels there are subtle references to la violencia. For example, characters live under various unjust situations like curfew, press censorship, and underground newspapers. In Evil Hour, while not one of García Márquez's most famous novels, is notable for its portrayal of la violencia with its [...] "fragmented portrayal of social disintegration provoked by la violencia". Although García Márquez did portray the corrupt nature and the injustices of times like la violencia, he refused to use {{his work as a}} platform for political propaganda. [...] "For him, the duty of the revolutionary writer <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> well, and the ideal novel is one that moves its reader by its political and social content, and, at the same time, by its power to penetrate reality and expose its other side.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode is}} part of the Treehouse of Horror series, which since the second season, has been a {{tradition}} for The Simpsons to air a new Halloween special each year. Treehouse of Horror episodes typically consist of four parts: an opening and Halloween-themed version of the credits, followed by three segments. These segments usually have a horror, science fiction or fantasy theme and quite often are parodies of films, novels, plays, television shows, Twilight Zone episodes, or old issues of EC Comics. The episode featured guest appearances from Jackie Mason and Aron Ralston, who was the subject of the film 127 Hours. Mason has a recurring role on The Simpsons as Rabbi Hyman Krustofski, who is the father of Krusty the Clown. As it is tradition with most Treehouse of Horror episodes, this episode featured the use of [...] "scary" [...] names in the credits, which <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> alternate names for cast and crew in a [...] "scary" [...] fashion. Ralston came up with his own scary name for the credits, which was Aron [...] "I gave my right arm to be on 'The Simpsons'" [...] Ralstump.|$|E

There are also infinitives corresponding to other aspects: (<b>to)</b> have <b>written,</b> (<b>to)</b> <b>be</b> <b>writing,</b> (<b>to)</b> have <b>been</b> <b>writing.</b> The second-person imperative <b>is</b> identical <b>to</b> the (basic) infinitive; other imperative forms may be made with let (let us go, or lets go; let them eat cake).|$|R

500|$|When Cisneros {{describes}} the aspirations and struggles of Chicanas, {{the theme of}} place often emerges. Place refers not only to her novels' geographic locations, {{but also to the}} positions her characters hold within their social context. Chicanas frequently occupy Anglo-dominated and male-dominated places where they are subject to a variety of oppressive and prejudicial behaviors; one of these places that is of particular interest to Cisneros is the home. As literary critics Deborah L. Madsen and Ramón Saldívar have described, the home can be an oppressive place for Chicanas where they are subjugated to the will of male heads-of-household, {{or in the case of}} their own home, it can be an empowering place where they can act autonomously and express themselves creatively. In The House on Mango Street the young protagonist, Esperanza, longs to have her own house: [...] "Not a flat. Not an apartment in back. Not a man's house. Not a daddy's. A house all my own. With my porch and my pillow, my pretty purple petunias. My books and my stories. My two shoes waiting beside the bed. Nobody to shake a stick at. Nobody's garbage to pick up after." [...] An aspiring writer, Esperanza yearns for [...] "a space for myself to go, clean as paper before the poem." [...] She feels discontented and trapped in her family home, and witnesses other women in the same position. According to Saldívar, Cisneros communicates through this character that a woman needs her own place in order to realize her full potential—a home which is not a site of patriarchal violence, but instead [...] "a site of poetic self-creation." [...] One source of conflict and grief for Cisneros's Chicana characters is that the male-dominated society in which they live denies them this place. Critics such as Jacqueline Doyle and Felicia J. Cruz have compared this theme in Cisneros's work to one of the key concepts in Virginia Woolf's famous essay [...] "A Room of One's Own", that [...] "a woman must have money and a room of her own if she <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> fiction," [...] or put another way, [...] "economic security" [...] and personal liberty are necessary for [...] "artistic production." ...|$|E
