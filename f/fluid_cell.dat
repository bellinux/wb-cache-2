40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} cell proliferation in platelet-enriched collagen plugs with and without addition of amniotic fluid-derived heterologous foetal cells to seal an iatrogenic membrane defect in the foetal rabbit model. METHODS: Amniotic <b>fluid</b> <b>cells</b> were harvested from three donor does at 23 days of gestation (term = 32 days) and labelled with carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFDA-SE). In 42 other does, foetal membrane defects were induced by foetoscopic needle puncture at 23 days of gestation, and closed with either a platelet-enriched collagen plug with (n = 44) or without (n = 32) amniotic <b>fluid</b> <b>cells.</b> At 30 days of gestation, the defects were harvested and assessed microscopically. RESULTS: The plugs enriched with heterologous amniotic <b>fluid</b> <b>cells</b> more commonly had proliferating cells in the centre of the plug than those without cell addition. CFDA-SE labelling confirmed the presence of heterologous amniotic <b>fluid</b> <b>cells</b> over the entire membrane plug. Cell typing showed a mixture of fibroblasts and epithelial cells at the wound edges, whereas in the centre, there was an abundance of fibroblasts. CONCLUSION: When sealing iatrogenic membrane defects in the foetal rabbit model, enrichment of collagen plugs with platelets and amniotic fluid-derived heterologous foetal cells increases local cell proliferation. status: publishe...|$|R

Design: Randomized animal study. Settings: University research laboratory.

Intervention: Six hours after induction of renal ischemia-reperfusion injury, amniotic <b>fluid</b> stem <b>cells,</b> vascular endothelial growth factor-amniotic <b>fluid</b> stem <b>cells</b> in two different doses, or vehicle were injected intraarterially. Measurements and Main Results: Analyses were performed at 24 hours, 48 hours, and 2 months after treatment. Outcome measures included serum creatinine, urine microprotenuira, and immunohistomorphometric analyses. Vascular endothelial growth factor-amniotic <b>fluid</b> stem <b>cells</b> induced a significantly higher nephroprotection than amniotic <b>fluid</b> stem <b>cells.</b> This effect was mediated mainly by immunomodulation, which led to lower macrophage infiltration and higher presence of regulatory T cell after ischemia-reperfusion injury.

Periderm cells, keratinocytes, cells of unknown epithelial origin, fibroblasts, fibrin clots, and urinary cast-like materials were seen in the amniotic fluid from normal fetuses. A large number of small macrophages phagocytizing collagen fibers {{was found in the}} amniotic fluid from all recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, some junctional epidermolysis bullosa fetuses, and a single epidermolysis bullosa Dowling-Meara fetus. Immuno-gold electron microscopy with anti-lysozyme and anti-CD 68 antibodies confirmed that the cells morphologically identified as macrophages were active macrophages containing many lysosomes. The percentage of macrophages/total amniotic <b>fluid</b> <b>cells</b> in amniotic <b>fluid</b> samples from the fetuses affected with recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa was significantly increased (12. 30 ± 0. 20 %) compared with that in the amniotic fluid from normal fetuses (1. 30 ± 0. 65 %) (p < 0. 001). In amniotic fluid samples from fetuses affected with harlequin ichthyosis and lamellar ichthyosis, clumps of keratinized cells that contained disease-specific abnormal granules and lipid droplets were observed.

50|$|The {{colloidal}} probes {{are normally}} fabricated by gluing a colloidal particle to a tip-less cantilever with a micromanipulator in air. The subsequent rewetting of the probe {{may lead to}} the formation of nanosized bubbles on the probe surface. This problem can be avoided by attaching the colloidal particles under wet conditions in AFM <b>fluid</b> <b>cell</b> to appropriately functionalized cantilevers. While the colloidal probe technique is mostly utilized in the sphere-plane geometry, it can be also used in the sphere-sphere geometry. The latter geometry further requires a lateral centering of the two particles, which can be either achieved with an optical microscope or an AFM scan. The results obtained in these two different geometries can be related with the Derjaguin approximation.|$|E
5000|$|A piezophile, also {{sometimes}} called a barophile, is an organism which thrives at high pressures, such as deep sea bacteria or archaea. Piezophile is the latin name for pressure-lover. They are generally found on ocean floors, where pressure often exceeds 380 atm (38 MPa). Some {{have been found}} {{at the bottom of}} the Pacific Ocean where the maximum pressure is roughly 117 MPa. The high pressures experienced by these organisms can cause the normal <b>fluid</b> <b>cell</b> membrane to become waxy and relatively impermeable to nutrients. The high pressure decreases the ability of the sub-units of multi-subunit proteins to interact. Thus, large protein complexes must interact to decrease pressure-related effects and regulate processes such as protein and DNA synthesis, which are sensitive to high pressure. Piezophilic bacteria have a high proportion of fatty acids in their cytoplasmic membrane, which allows membranes to remain functional and keep from gelling at high pressures.|$|E
5000|$|Studies on {{the cell}} {{membranes}} of mammals and reptiles discovered that mammalian cell membranes are composed of {{a higher proportion of}} polyunsaturated fatty acids (DHA, omega-3 fatty acid) than reptiles [...] Studies on bird fatty acid composition have noted similar proportions to mammals but with 1/3rd less omega-3 fatty acids as compared to omega-6 for a given body size. This fatty acid composition results in a more <b>fluid</b> <b>cell</b> membrane but also one that is permeable to various ions (H+ & Na+), resulting in cell membranes that are more costly to maintain. This maintenance cost has been argued {{to be one of the}} key causes for the high metabolic rates and concomitant warm-bloodedness of mammals and birds. However polyunsaturation of cell membranes may also occur in response to chronic cold temperatures as well. In fish increasingly cold environments lead to increasingly high cell membrane content of both monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids, to maintain greater membrane fluidity (and functionality) at the lower temperatures.|$|E

In this study, {{it was hypothesized}} that apoptosis might {{play an important role in}} the pathogenesis of SM-induced lung injury via Fas-FasL signaling pathway. In a case-control study, Fas and FasL levels, caspase- 3 activity and percent of apoptotic cells were measured in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid of patients 20 years after exposure to sulfur mustard and compared with the control group. Results show that Fas and FasL levels were significantly higher in BAL <b>fluid</b> <b>cells</b> in patients group compared with the control (P =. 001). No significant differences were observed between mild and moderate-severe groups. BAL <b>fluid</b> <b>cells</b> caspase- 3 activity was not significantly different among the mild, moderate-severe, and control groups.

40|$|Lymphocytes {{from the}} {{synovial}} fluid of {{eight out of}} eight rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients had elevated very late activation antigen- 1 (VLA- 1) expression (10 - 36 % positive cells), whereas peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) from RA patients and healthy controls had low VLA- 1 expression (0 - 6 % positive cells). During 1 - 2 wk of in vitro culture, VLA- 1 increased on synovial <b>fluid</b> <b>cells</b> but remained low on PBL. In comparison, the interleukin 2 receptor (IL- 2 R) was less prominent than VLA- 1 on fresh synovial <b>fluid</b> <b>cells,</b> did not increase on cultured synovial <b>fluid</b> T <b>cells,</b> but did increase greatly on cultured PBL. The mitogen PHA reversed or prevented the appearance of VLA- 1 +, IL- 2 R- synovial <b>fluid</b> <b>cells</b> during in vitro culture, thus giving IL- 2 R+, VLA- 1 - cells. These results emphasize that VLA- 1 + SF cells are different from resting cells or IL- 2 R+ activated PBL T cells, and VLA- 1 on synovial <b>fluid</b> T <b>cells</b> may be incompatible with mitogen stimulation. In addition, the VLA- 2 heterodimer (165, 000 / 130, 000 relative molecular mass [Mr]) was regulated opposite to the VLA- 1 heterodimer (130, 000 / 210, 000 Mr) on synovial lymphocytes, and thus the VLA- 1 /VLA- 2 ratio is another indicator of the stage of T cell activation...|$|R
40|$|Clinical and {{immunologic}} {{evidence suggests}} that tuberculous pleuritis provides a model to understand protective immune mechanisms against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. We therefore evaluated the pattern of cytokine mRNA expression and cytokine production in pleural fluid and blood of patients with tuberculous pleuritis. RNA was extracted from mononuclear cells, reverse transcribed to cDNA, and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). After normalization for T-cell cDNA, cDNA from pleural <b>fluid</b> <b>cells</b> and {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMC) was amplified with cytokine-specific primers. PCR product was quantified by Southern blot. For the Th 1 cytokines gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) and interleukin- 2 (IL- 2), PCR product was greater in pleural fluid than in blood, whereas PCR product for the Th 2 cytokine IL- 4 was decreased in pleural fluid compared with blood. Concentrations of IFN-gamma were elevated in pleural fluid compared with serum, but IL- 2, IL- 4, and IL- 5 were not detectable. Mean concentrations of IFN-gamma and IL- 2 in supernatants of M. tuberculosis-stimulated pleural <b>fluid</b> <b>cells</b> were significantly greater than corresponding concentrations in supernatants of stimulated PBMC. In situ hybridization showed that increased IFN-gamma production by pleural <b>fluid</b> <b>cells</b> was associated with a 20 - to 60 -fold increase in the frequency of antigen-reactive IFN-gamma-mRNA-expressing cells. Because IL- 10 can be produced by T cells and macrophages, pleural <b>fluid</b> <b>cells</b> and PBMC were normalized for beta-actin cDNA content and then amplified by PCR with IL- 10 -specific primers. IL- 10 mRNA was greater in pleural <b>fluid</b> <b>cells</b> than in PBMC and was expressed predominantly by macrophages. IL- 10 concentrations were elevated in pleural fluid versus serum. These data provide strong evidence for compartmentalization of Th 1 cytokines and IL- 10 at the site of disease in humans with a resistant immune response to mycobacterial infection...|$|R
