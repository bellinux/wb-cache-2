5|$|In the 20th century, many {{individuals}} with Down syndrome were institutionalized, {{few of the}} associated medical problems were treated, and most died in infancy or early adult life. With {{the rise of the}} eugenics movement, 33 of the then 48 U.S. states and several countries began programs of forced sterilization of individuals with Down syndrome and comparable degrees of disability. Action T4 <b>in</b> <b>Nazi</b> <b>Germany</b> made public policy of a program of systematic involuntary euthanization.|$|E
5|$|Initially a {{force of}} a dozen men {{under the auspices of}} the SA, the Schutzstaffel (SS) grew to become one of the largest and most {{powerful}} groups <b>in</b> <b>Nazi</b> <b>Germany.</b> Led by Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler from 1929, the SS had over a quarter million members by 1938 and continued to grow. Himmler envisioned the SS as being an elite group of guards, Hitler's last line of defence. The Waffen-SS, the military branch of the SS, became a de facto fourth branch of the Wehrmacht.|$|E

5|$|Fort Lauderdale's {{first major}} {{development}} {{began in the}} 1920s, during the Florida land boom of the 1920s. The 1926 Miami Hurricane and the Great Depression of the 1930s caused {{a great deal of}} economic dislocation. In July 1935, an African-American man named Rubin Stacy was accused of robbing a white woman at knife point. He was arrested and being transported to a Miami jail when police were run off the road by a mob. A group of 100 white men proceeded to hang Stacy from a tree near the scene of his alleged robbery. His body was riddled with some twenty bullets. The murder was subsequently used by the press <b>in</b> <b>Nazi</b> <b>Germany</b> to discredit US critiques of its own persecution of Jews, Communists, and Catholics.|$|E
5|$|In {{central and}} eastern Europe, the state played {{a greater role in}} organising these pilgrimages. The National Orthodox Romanian Women's Society, {{supported}} by the church and the state, played an important part in enabling regular pilgrimages to important Romanian sites up until 1939. In Germany and Italy, the Fascist governments took a keen interest in organising such journeys. In Italy, these involved large, state-influenced organisations, and the government steadily discouraged private visits or unofficial groups from taking part in alternative ceremonies at these sites. <b>In</b> <b>Nazi</b> <b>Germany,</b> pilgrimages were organised to the new war memorials sponsored by the government in the 1930s.|$|E

5|$|MacLachlan flew {{missions}} against rail targets <b>in</b> <b>Nazi</b> <b>Germany</b> on 23 May, attacking Bingen am Rhein. On 25 May he flew against targets near Sedan and his Battle {{was damaged}} by flak. The unit relocated to Moissy and he flew missions {{in support of}} French Army forces around Abbeville. On 10 June near Fleury, his cockpit hood was shot away by accurate ground fire but MacLachlan was unhurt. On 13 June he flew a daylight mission against German spearheads and while returning to base flew under a formation of Junkers Ju 87 dive bombers. The escorting Bf 109s gave chase and shot one Battle down. MacLachlan claimed to have managed to fire on two Bf 109s and damaged them—these claims cannot be confirmed.|$|E
5|$|This was {{the start}} of a massive {{armament}} programme that would consume more than a billion francs over the next ten years, but after Hitler's rise to power <b>in</b> <b>Nazi</b> <b>Germany,</b> the Social Democrats added their support to the efforts. They also supported Gottlieb Duttweiler's 1938popular initiative calling for the purchase of a thousand aircraft and the training of three thousand pilots. After 92,000citizens signed in support, nearly twice the number necessary for a national popular vote, the federal government offered a referendum proposal in 1939that was nearly as extensive, which was accepted by a 69percent majority.|$|E
5|$|Because he and {{his father}} held strong anti-communist beliefs, Koubek decided to flee Czechoslovakia after the Communist coup d'état of February 1948. He tried to cross the border into the American Zone of Occupation of Allied-occupied Germany, and failed. A second attempt in July succeeded. Koubek emigrated to the United Kingdom in October 1948, where he worked in a brickyard, as a {{draftsman}} for the city of Gloucester and county of Gloucestershire, a draftsman for the Ministry of Works, and announcer for the Czech language news service of the BBC. He encountered his future wife, Eva, in a bookstore in London. Eva was born in Prague, the daughter of a Czech Army officer.

5|$|In 1935, Italy invaded Ethiopia (Abyssinia), incensing Kenyatta {{and other}} Africans in London; {{he became the}} honorary {{secretary}} of the International African Friends of Abyssinia, a group established by Padmore and C. L. R. James. When Ethiopia's monarch Haile Selassie fled to London in exile, Kenyatta personally welcomed him. This group developed into a wider pan-Africanist organisation, the International African Service Bureau (IASB), which Kenyatta joined. Kenyatta began giving anti-colonial lectures across Britain for groups like the IASB and the Workers' Educational Association. In October 1938, he gave a talk to the Manchester Fabian Society in which he described British colonial policy as fascism and compared the treatment of indigenous people in East Africa {{to the treatment of}} Jews <b>in</b> <b>Nazi</b> <b>Germany.</b> In response to these activities, the British Colonial Office reopened their file on him, although could not find any evidence that he was engaged in anything sufficiently seditious to warrant prosecution.|$|E
5|$|Meryl Streep is an American {{actress who}} has had an {{extensive}} career in film, television, and stage. She made her stage debut in 1975 with The Public Theater production of Trelawny of the Wells. She went on to perform several roles on stage in the 1970s, garnering a Tony Award nomination {{for her role in}} 27 Wagons Full of Cotton (1976). In 1977, Streep starred in the television movie The Deadliest Season, and made her film debut with a brief role alongside Jane Fonda in Julia. A supporting role in the war drama The Deer Hunter (1978) proved to be a breakthrough for Streep and she received her first Academy Award nomination for it. She won the award the following year for playing a troubled wife in the top-grossing drama Kramer vs. Kramer (1979). Also in 1978, Streep played a German married to a Jew <b>in</b> <b>Nazi</b> <b>Germany</b> in the television miniseries Holocaust, which earned her the Emmy Award for Best Actress.|$|E
5|$|Szabó’s {{next three}} films {{constituted}} {{a new phase}} in his career—moving away from Hungarian productions, in Hungarian, written by Szabó alone, and featuring Bálint, and moving toward international co-productions, in German, written by Szabó in collaboration with others, and featuring Austrian actor Klaus Maria Brandauer. The informal trilogy—Mephisto (1981), Colonel Redl (1985) and Hanussen (1988)—features Brandauer {{in a series of}} roles based on historical figures who, as represented in the films, compromised their morals in order to climb the ladder of success within a context of authoritarian political power. In Mephisto, based on a novel by Klaus Mann, Brandauer plays an actor and theater director <b>in</b> <b>Nazi</b> <b>Germany,</b> a role based on Mann’s former brother-in-law Gustaf Gründgens. The film won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, and the award for Best Screenplay at the Cannes Film Festival, and greatly increased Szabó’s international prestige.|$|E

5|$|With {{the help}} of Perón, Rudel secured lucrative {{contracts}} with the Brazilian military. He was also active as a military adviser and arms dealer for the Bolivian regime, Augusto Pinochet in Chile and Stroessner in Paraguay. He was in contact with Werner Naumann, formerly a State Secretary in Goebbels' Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda <b>in</b> <b>Nazi</b> <b>Germany.</b> Following the Revolución Libertadora in 1955, a military and civilian uprising that ended the second presidential term of Perón, Rudel {{was forced to leave}} Argentina and move to Paraguay. During the following years in South America, Rudel frequently acted as a foreign representative for several German companies, including Salzgitter AG, Dornier Flugzeugwerke, Focke-Wulf, Messerschmitt, Siemens and Lahmeyer International, a German consulting engineering firm. Rudel's input was used during the development of the A-10 Thunderbolt II, a United States Air Force aircraft designed solely for close air support, including attacking ground targets as tanks and armored vehicles.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in April 1933, {{scores of}} {{measures}} defining {{the status of}} Jews and their rights were instituted at the regional and national level. Initiatives and legal mandates against the Jews reached their culmination {{with the establishment of}} the Nuremberg Laws of 1935, stripping them of their basic rights. The Nazis would take from the Jews their wealth, their right to intermarry with non-Jews and their right to occupy many fields of labour (such as practising law, medicine or working as educators). They eventually declared them undesirable to remain among German citizens and society, which over time dehumanised the Jews. Arguably, these actions desensitised Germans {{to the extent that it}} resulted in the Holocaust. Ethnic Germans who refused to ostracise Jews or who showed any signs of resistance to Nazi propaganda were placed under surveillance by the Gestapo, had their rights removed or were sent to concentration camps. Everyone and everything was monitored <b>in</b> <b>Nazi</b> <b>Germany.</b> Inaugurating and legitimising power for the Nazis was thus accomplished by their initial revolutionary activities, then through the improvisation and manipulation of the legal mechanisms available, through the use of police powers by the Nazi Party (which allowed them to include and exclude from society whomever they chose) and finally by the expansion of authority for all state and federal institutions.|$|E
5|$|In {{the opinion}} of the Moscow Helsinki Group {{chairwoman}} Lyudmila Alexeyeva, the attribution of a mental illness to a prominent figure who came out with a political declaration or action is the most significant factor in the assessment of psychiatry during the 1960–1980s. The practice of forced confinement of political dissidents in psychiatric facilities in the former USSR and Eastern Europe destroyed the credibility of psychiatric practice in these countries. When psychiatric profession is discredited {{in one part of the}} world, psychiatry is discredited throughout the world. Psychiatry lost its professional basis entirely with its abuse to stifle dissidence in the former USSR and in the so-called euthanasia program <b>in</b> <b>Nazi</b> <b>Germany.</b> There is little doubt that the capacity for using psychiatry to enforce social norms and even political interests is immense. Now psychiatry is vulnerable because many of its notions have been questioned, and the sustainable pattern of mental life, of boundaries of mental norm and abnormality has been lost, director of the Moscow Research Institute for Psychiatry Valery Krasnov says, adding that psychiatrists have to seek new reference points to make clinical assessments and new reference points to justify old therapeutical interventions.|$|E
