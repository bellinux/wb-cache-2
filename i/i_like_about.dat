She knows the effect that that has on Stannis, and that can make men do unadvisable things. So the fact that she did that and she uses that power in that way to have this influence on people. That puts her into context as somebody who really does know what she's doing." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2000, Hooper {{directed}} his {{first of two}} costume dramas for the BBC; Love in a Cold Climate was based on Nancy Mitford's novels The Pursuit of Love and Love in a Cold Climate. Hooper, the writer Deborah Moggach, and the producer Kate Harwood researched the period details of the production by interviewing Nancy's sister Deborah. In 2002, Hooper directed Daniel Deronda, adapted from George Eliot's novel. Filming ran for 11 weeks from May to August on locations in England, Scotland and Malta. Hooper said of the production, [...] "The thing <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>about</b> this tale is that it's not at all your conventional costume drama; it's far more complex and looks at aspects of love, loss and religion." [...] The Guardians Mark Lawson said of Hooper's two costume dramas, [...] "he brought verve and intelligence to television's most conservative form".|$|E
500|$|The {{reviewer}} for {{the feminist}} magazine Herizons wrote, [...] "Fences and Windows was written {{to be read}} and shared and talked about and carried around in your bag. It is a book that begs you to write in the margins, and highlight relevant quotes because it's filled with stories, insights, shocking statistics, inspiring anecdotes and refreshing critiques. It's small, it's smart and it's jammed with information and ideas that inspire hope and motivate action." [...] Similarly, reviewing for The Guardian, Stuart Christie wrote, [...] "This is a book to be savoured and referred to every so often, even if just to recharge one's moral batteries." [...] In The Globe and Mail, Stan Persky wrote, [...] "What <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>about</b> Klein's reflections on the nascent movement that she both participates in and analyzes is that she indulges in minimal rhetorical rah-rah. Nor does she fudge the shortcomings and screwups of the fledgling activists." ...|$|E

5000|$|Michael Adams from 411mania {{rated the}} episode with 8/10 {{saying that it}} was great. [...] "It Arrested gave every character, even Lily, a chance to have their moment, {{which is one of the}} many things I love about this show. ...

500|$|... "Dog Days Are Over" [...] was the {{favorite}} song of several reviewers, including Hankinson, who said [...] "it was the exact brand of high-energy jubilation that I love the most." [...] Harper was also enthusiastic: [...] "This performance for me represents what <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>about</b> New Directions—and why Kurt {{needs to come}} back asap. Everyone got {{to do their own}} individual thing, yet they still work really well as a group. I give it best song of the night." [...] In Semigran's view, [...] "From the cute choreographed claps to the unconventional (but oddly fitting) choice to have Tina and Mercedes sing the tune, I wish they'd save this one for regionals. It was a winner", while VanDerWerff wrote, [...] " [...] 'Dog Days Are Over' is right in this show's wheelhouse, so, naturally, it hits the song out of the park." [...] Benigno gave the song a [...] "B+", and Berk awarded three stars out of five, while Stack gave it an [...] "A", and said series creator Ryan Murphy [...] "chose the perfect gals to pull off this cover." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Harvest Festival" [...] {{was written}} by Daniel J. Goor and {{directed}} by Dean Holland. The episode marked {{the culmination of a}} seven-episode story arc that began with the third season premiere, [...] "Go Big or Go Home", in which Leslie and the parks department prepare to relaunch the harvest festival, which had previously been a Pawnee tradition before it ended. The storyline stemmed from serious budget problems facing Pawnee which forced a government shutdown and threatened major cuts to the parks department, prompting Leslie to bring the harvest festival back and stake the future of the entire department on its success or failure. Amy Poehler said she believed the storyline was appropriate for a series about small government and was well handled by the writers: [...] "What <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>about</b> the show is it doesn't spend 25 episodes talking about this thing, it talks about it in the right amount of time. It happens and then there's consequences of it. The show keeps moving forward, which is always really fun." ...|$|E

At the concert, Igor joined Soulfly and performed two Sepultura songs, [...] "Roots Bloody Roots" [...] and [...] "Attitude," [...] for which Dana had written the lyrics. In an interview with Chad Bowar for About.com, Max stated that performance was [...] "the birth of Cavalera Conspiracy". After the show, Max suggested they begin a new project after Soulfly finished touring. Max confessed to Bowar that he had lied to Igor when he said all the songs were ready when he had only finished one. He added, [...] "It was one of those good lies. Everything rolled from there. What <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>about</b> the Conspiracy is that nothing is really planned. One thing leads to another. There's no pressure and it feels like a different project than anything I've done." ...|$|E
