25|$|The {{cultural}} invasion {{is like a}} leafy tree {{which prevents}} us from seeing our own sun, sky and stars. Therefore {{in order to be}} able to see the sky above our heads, our task is to cut this tree off at the roots. US imperialism understands very well the magic of communication through music and persists in filling our young people with all sorts of commercial tripe. With professional expertise they have taken certain measures: first, the commercialization of the so-called 'protest music'; second, the creation of 'idols' of protest music who obey the same rules and suffer from the same constraints as the other idols of the consumer music industry – they last a little while and then disappear. Meanwhile they are useful in neutralizing the innate spirit of rebellion of young people. The term 'protest song' is no longer valid because it is ambiguous and has been misused. <b>I</b> <b>prefer</b> <b>the</b> term 'revolutionary song'.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{have given}} [...] "Bye Bye Nerdie" [...] {{generally}} positive reviews. DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson commented that [...] "While this isn’t saying much, 'Nerdie' provides one of Season 12’s better shows. Both plots work well, though <b>I</b> <b>prefer</b> <b>the</b> childproofing side of things; it peters {{out at the}} end, but it has some good bits. The episode keeps us interested and entertained." [...] Mac McEntire of DVD Verdict cited the scene in which the children imagine {{what kind of person}} the new student is as the greatest moment in the episode.|$|E

Of his five siblings, , his older brother Gabriel Zakuani plays for English club Northampton Town {{and is a member}} of the Congolese national team. He might have been able to play for the United States if granted citizenship. He expressed interest in representing the Congolese national team early in his professional career, but considered his chances of playing for England [...] "a long shot". Later in his career, he expressed interest in playing for the United States, saying, [...] "of the three, <b>I</b> <b>prefer</b> <b>the</b> States as this is where I made my name as a player".|$|E
2500|$|James Joyce {{noted that}} [...] Tolstoy admired {{him but he}} {{thought that he had}} little artistic {{accomplishment}} or mind. Yet, as he said, 'he admired his heart', a criticism which contains a great deal of truth, for though his characters do act extravagantly, madly, almost, still their basis is firm enough underneath... The Brothers Karamazov... made a deep impression on me... he created some unforgettable scenes ... Madness you may call it, but therein may be the secret of his genius... <b>I</b> <b>prefer</b> <b>the</b> word exaltation, exaltation which can merge into madness, perhaps. In fact all great men have had that vein in them; it was the source of their greatness; the reasonable man achieves nothing.|$|E

More success was to follow, including the multi-platinum selling album The Gambler and another international Number 1 single, [...] "Coward of the County," [...] taken from the equally successful album, Kenny.

2500|$|In her {{introduction}} to The Womanist Reader, Layli Phillips contends that despite womanism's characterization, its {{main concern is}} not the black woman per se but rather the black woman {{is the point of}} origination for womanism. The basic tenets of womanism includes a strong self-authored spirit of activism that is especially evident in literature. Womanism has been such a polarizing movement for women that it has managed to step outside of the black community and extend itself into other non-white communities. [...] "Purple is to Lavender" [...] illustrates this through experiences that Dimpal Jain and Caroline Turner discuss. Some scholars view womanism as a subcategory of feminism while others argue that it is actually the other way around. Purple is to Lavender explores the concept that womanism is to feminism as purple is to lavender, that feminism falls under the umbrella of womanism. In [...] "Purple is to Lavender", Dimpal Jain and Caroline Turner discuss their experiences as non-white women in faculty. They experienced a great deal of discrimination because they were minorities. Jain is south Asian, while Caroline identifies as Filipino (Jain & Turner, pp.67–70). They go on to describe the concept of [...] "The Politics of Naming" [...] which shapes the reason for why they prefer womanism as opposed to feminism (Jain & Turner, pp.73–75). Jain states: [...] "I knew that the term feminism was contested and that I did not like how it fit in my mouth. It was uncomfortable and scratchy, almost like a foreign substance that I was being forced to consume as the White women continued to smile with comforting looks of familiarity and pride" [...] (Jain & Turner, p.68). Here Turner makes it well known that she feels as though feminism is something that is forced upon her. She feels like she cannot completely identify with feminism. It is also important to note Jain's statement that, [...] "The crux of the politics of naming is that names serve as identifiers and are not neutral when attached to social movements, ideas, and groups of people. Naming and labeling become politicized acts when they serve to determine any type of membership at a group level" [...] (Jain & Turner, p.73). This statement illustrates that if an individual identifies with feminism they may do so for particular reasons. However, those reasons may not be evident to the general public because of the connotation that the word feminism brings with it in terms of social movements, ideas, and groups of people. Individuals want something to identify with that expresses and supports their beliefs holistically. They want something that they can embrace to the fullest without any hint of regret. Similarly, Alice Walker even states: [...] "I don't choose womanism because it is [...] "better" [...] than feminism...I choose it because <b>I</b> <b>prefer</b> <b>the</b> sound, the feel, the fit of it… because I share the old ethnic-American habit of offering society a new word when the old word it is using fails to describe behavior and change that only a new word can help it more fully see" [...] (quoted in Jain & Turner, pp.77–78).|$|E
