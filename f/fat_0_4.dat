The amino acid profile indicated that Cyanothece sp. was a balanced protein source. Fatty acids of the 18 : 3 n- 3 type were also present. Mineral analyses indicated that the cellular biomass may be a good source of Fe, Zn and Na. Caloric content was 4. 5 to 5. 1 kcal g dry weight- 1 and the carbon content was approximately 40 % on a dry weight basis. Nitrogen content was 8 to 9 % on a dry weight basis and total nucleic acids were 1. 3 % on a dry weight basis. Short-term feeding studies in rats followed by histopathology found no toxicity or dietary incompatibility problems. The level of uric acid and allantoin in urine and tissues was low, suggesting no excess of nucleic acids, as sometimes reported in the past for a cyanobacteria-containing diet. The current work discusses the potential implications of these results for human nutrition applications...|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} were {{to evaluate the}} effects of a liquid nutritional supplement formulated for dogs on water intakes and urine output. A liquid nutritional supplement was tested by way of a cross-over design in 8 experimental healthy Beagle dogs (4 males and 4 females, aged 9. 3 years). The supplement (87 percent water, 2. 7 percent protein, 2. 6 percent <b>fat,</b> <b>0.</b> <b>4</b> percent crude fiber) was added to water and tested at 2 incorporation rates (50 or 70 ml/day/dog—D 50 or D 70) versus the control placebo (CO-water only). The dogs were kept in a controlled environment; water intakes and urine output were measured. Individual water intakes were characterised by large variations. Mean water intake increased significantly by 28 percent in dogs receiving the liquid nutritional supplement, in both genders, irrespectively of the dosage. Urine output was also increased, by 55 percent. Faeces scores remained unchanged. It was concluded that the liquid supplement increased water intake and urine output in a safe way, without increasing dramatically the daily dietary sodium chloride intake. The recommended dosage of the manufacturer— 50 ml/day for dogs weighing 10 - 20 kg BW is efficient. Increasing the dosage had no advantage, nor adverse effects. Increased water intake and urine output is of interest for dogs suffering from urolithiasis. Peer reviewe...|$|E

The objective {{of this study was}} to develop and characterize, through physicochemical, microbiologica, and sensory traits, a fresh sausage of tambaqui fish (Colossoma macropomum). Three formulations, with different percentages of <b>fat</b> (<b>0,</b> <b>4.</b> 5, and 9 %) were developed. To determine shelf life, samples of the products were refrigerated at 4 ºC for 12 days and microbiological analyses were performed on days 0, 3, 7, and 12. Analyses of centesimal composition, shear force, cooking weight loss, and water-holding capacity were carried out. The shelf life of the fresh sausages was estimated at 7 days of storage. The sensory attributes evaluated were aroma, color, flavor, succulence, texture, and overall appearance. All treatments showed high acceptance rates, above 80 %. The treatment with 9 % fat showed the highest mean values in the evaluated attributes, with 86. 6 %, 83. 4 %, 92 %, 88. 2 %, 87. 2 %, and 85. 8 % for aroma, color, flavor, succulence, texture and overall appearance, respectively.

40|$|Carcass {{records on}} 4749 bulls (from 153 sires) {{slaughtered}} {{at an average}} age of 20 months were collected from slaughter houses in the Netherlands. Bulls had a variable proportion of genes from Dutch Black and White (DBW), Dutch Red and White (DRW) and Pimontese (PIM). Additive genetic and crossbreeding parameters were estimated for fleshiness score (FLESH), fat covering score (FAT) and carcass weight (CWT) using three fixed models (additive breed, Dickerson and Kinghorn model) and the corresponding three mixed models with random sire effects. These models involved additive breed, heterosis (or dominance), and recombination loss (or epistatic loss) effects (i. e., crossbreeding parameters) as regression covariates. In addition, an additive sire group model was used as a mixed model. FLESH and FAT were defined numerical values ranging from 1 (poorly muscled; very much fat) to 15 (very muscled; very little fat). When comparing models, estimates of crossbreeding parameters over breeds and breed combinations showed similar patterns, although absolute values between the same parameters differed up to a standard error between fixed and mixed models and between Dickerson and Kinghorn models. Mixed models showed larger standard errors relative to fixed models. Relative to DBW, PIM showed significantly positive favorable breed effects for FLESH (ranging from 5. 8 to 6. 3 for different models) and CWT (62. 6 to 111. 8 kg), and unfavorable for FAT (− 1. 7 to − 2. 6). DRW showed favorable, but smaller than PIM, additive genetic effects for all three traits (2. 2 to 2. 3 for FLESH, 0. 1 to 0. 3 for FAT and 18. 1 to 24. 2 kg for CWT). Significant heterosis was only found for <b>FAT</b> (<b>0.</b> <b>4</b> to 0. 7) and for CWT (12 to 14 kg) in the cross DBW x DRW.

40|$|Twenty-six waste {{samples from}} eight {{factories}} in the Goulburn Valley and south-west Victoria were characterised to determine their suitability {{for a range of}} potential uses. The waste streams were found to be diverse in nature and composition. They included sludges and product rejects, such as cheeses, powders and ice-cream solids. The nutrient quality of many dairy processing wastes make them ideal for direct land application, but little information is available about their public health, agronomic and environmental impacts when they are applied to land. The moisture content of the sludges ranged from 21 - 97 % (w/w wet basis). On a dry basis, the total nitrogen, total phosphorus and total potassium of these wastes ranged from 0. 7 - 8. 9 % (w/w), 913 - 21, 349 mg/kg and 205 - 19, 673 mg/kg, respectively. Waste streams from cheese and/or ice-cream production were commonly recycled as stock feed. The digestibility for the stock feeds ranged from (w/w d. m.) 76. 6 - 94. 1 %, and there was wide variation in carbohydrate (1. 4 - 92 %), protein (4. 5 - 82. 1 %) and <b>fat</b> (<b>0.</b> <b>4</b> - 78. 9 %) contents between samples. Waste streams that were recycled as tallow had fat contents ranging from (w/w d. m.) 75. 3 % to more than 95 %, but only two of these were close to meeting the specifications for technical tallow production. Three high-fat (> 44 % w/w d. m.) waste streams were also composted, including two grease trap wastes. High-fat waste streams could possibly be used as boiler fuel, or for bio-diesel production, but at current waste volumes, these applications are probably not yet economically viable. Variability in the composition of dairy processing waste streams is probably not a major concern for the continuing low-level utilisation of these waste streams, such as for land application, composting and stock feed. However, a better understanding of this variability is needed if higher value uses are to be considered for dairy-processing waste streams...|$|E

A combination of supplemental fat and Virginiamycin increased protein and decreased fat content of the dressed carcass. Virginiamycin supplementation overcame the growth depression of a low lysine diet by increasing feed intake. In the low lysine diet, Virginiamycin supplementation reduced abdominal fat deposition in females and increased carcass yield in males.

40|$|Irish {{consumers}} (n = 1045) {{were surveyed}} {{with respect to}} their attitudes towards healthier food consumption, particularly in relation to salt and fat reduction. It appears educational campaigns have generally been adopted by respondents, as only a minority were not concerned about their diet; irrespective of age, gender or educational status. Overall, an increase in purchasing salt-reduced food was observed, although fat-reduced food products were already better adopted. This thesis then focused on development of consumer-accepted low salt and low fat Irish traditional processed meats (white pudding, black pudding, corned beef). Salt and fat reductions were carried out by simply reducing salt and fat content without using additives. For that purpose, 25 white and black pudding formulations with varying fat (2. 5 % - 20 % w/w) and sodium (0. 2 % - 1. 0 % w/w) contents, and 5 corned beef samples with varied sodium levels (0. 2 % - 1. 0 % w/w) were produced in a pilot plant processing facility. White pudding samples containing 15 % <b>fat</b> and <b>0.</b> 6 % sodium, and black pudding samples containing 0. 6 % sodium and 10 % fat were highly accepted, thereby satisfying the sodium target (0. 6 %) set by the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI, 2011).

Patients and Methods: We included 21 women and 18 men (mean age, 71 years; range, 48 - 85 years) with primary OA in all three knee compartments, 17 women and 56 men (mean age, 55 years; range, 34 - 74 years) with primary medial knee OA and 122 women and 121 men without OA as controls. We measured total body BMD (g/cm 2), fat and lean mass (%) by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry and also registered height and weight to calculate BMI (kg/m 2). Z-scores were calculated for each individual. Data are presented as means with 95 % confidence intervals within brackets. Results: Individuals with primary OA in all three knee compartments had the following Z-scores: total body BMD <b>0.</b> <b>4</b> (<b>0.</b> 0, 0. 9); BMI 1. 2 (0. 7, 1. 6); proportion of lean mass- 0. 6 (- 1. 1,- 0. 1); proportion of <b>fat</b> mass <b>0.</b> <b>4</b> (<b>0.</b> 0, 1. 8).

The economics of whether fat should be added to the growing finishing pig diet will depend on the cost of corn, soybean meal and fat. The results of this experiment demonstrate that, with current prices, the lowest cost per pound of gain was obtained when no fat was added to the diet for pigs from 158 to 232 lb.

Optimising dietary intake and body composition can positively affect the performance of rugby athletes. Objectives. To determine the body composition, habitual and game-specific nutritional practices of FNB Maties Varsity Cup (MVC) rugby players. Methods. A descriptive, cross-sectional study with an analytical component was conducted. Of all the MVC rugby players (N= 35), 18 completed the sections on body {{composition and}} match-day dietary intake, while 11 completed the habitual dietary intake section. Body composition data were collected by an International Society for the Advancement of Kinanthropometry-accredited biokineticist. Habitual dietary intake data (via a self-administered 7 -day food record) and match-day dietary strategies (via telephonic 24 -hour recall interview) were collected and compared with nutritional requirements reported by the International Olympic Committee, the American Dietetic Association, the American College of Sports Medicine and the International Society of Sport Nutrition. Results.

Compared with current recommendations, group habitual dietary intake (mean (stand­ard deviation)) was inadequate for total energy (45. <b>4</b> (9. <b>0)</b> kcal/kg body weight (BW)), carbohydrate (<b>4.</b> 3 (<b>0.</b> <b>4)</b> g/kg BW), polyunsaturated fatty acids (6. 2 (1. 7) % of total energy (TE)), calcium:protein ratio (6. 5 : 1 (3. 5 : 1)) and copper (2. 3 (<b>0.</b> <b>4)</b> mg), while displaying higher-than-recommended intakes for total protein (2. <b>4</b> (<b>0.</b> 7) g/kg BW), fibre (37. 7 (7. 3) g/day), total fat (33. 8 (4. 3) % TE), saturated fatty acids (11. 2 (13. 1) % TE), cholesterol (766. 3 (371. 8) mg) and niacin (45. 2 (6. 9) µg). Habitual supplement use was high at 91 % (n= 10 / 11). Nutritional match-day strategies were excessive for protein (1. 2 (0. 6) g/kg BW) and <b>fat</b> (<b>0.</b> 9 (<b>0.</b> <b>4)</b> g/kg BW) in the pre-event meal, inadequate for energy and carbohydrate during the game and excessive for alcohol (54. 4 (59. 9) g) after the game.

Different methods have been suggested for the estimation of body fat volume and its distribution. However, they may be either expensive or hazardous for some groups of patients. Sonography is a very accessible technique, which may be used for the evaluation of visceral and subcutaneous fat volume. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the sonographic prediction of body fat and its distribution in subcutaneous and visceral compart-ments. Methods: During a three-month period, we conducted sonographic evaluations for visceral and subcutaneous fat in 106 patients who were admitted to our hospital. The subcutaneous fat was measured at the para-umbilical region and visceral fat was measured in the right para-renal space. The results were compared with the data obtained from the body mass index (BMI) and bioelectric impedance analysis. Results: The mean age of the patients was 58. 8 years, and the mean BMI was 26. 48 ± 0. 33.

Higher levels of fat in milk produced a cheese containing higher fat content and lower protein content. Similarly, higher levels of protein in milk produced higher protein content and lower fat content of cheese. Higher protein to fat ratio (or casein to fat ratio) in milk was associated with better efficiency of fat retention in the cheese. Casein retention in the cheese was not affected by the levels of fat and protein, or protein to fat ratio in milk.

Similarly, effects of YG on increased (P c. 05) stearic acid concentration and a higher concentration (P c. 051 of linoleic acid measured in longissimus muscle of steers fed SFSG vs SFC were small in magnitude. These data indicate that under the conditions of this experiment, NE contents of SFSG and SFC were similar. Beef produced from sorghum grain is similar in quality and sensory properties to that produced from corn. There was no correlation (r = -. 001) between degree of marbling and tissue cholesterol content, suggesting that for closely trimmed beef cuts, selection for higher quality by consumers will not elevate cholesterol intake...|$|R

The subject population consisted of twenty-one volunteer students, 7 males and 14 females, averaging 25. 6 years of age. Physical fitness changes were measured by determining the VO 2 max of the subjects. Results over this 18 month period revealed {{a significant increase in}} VO 2 max for females between initial and 15 month evaluations as demonstrated by the one-way ANOV A with repeated measures (p= 0. 003).

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{evaluate}} hepatic fat fraction on dual- and triple-echo gradient-recalled echo MRI sequences {{in healthy}} children. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed {{the records of}} children in a medical check-up clinic from May 2012 to November 2013. We excluded children with abnormal laboratory findings or those who were overweight. Hepatic fat fraction was measured on dual- and triple-echo sequences using 3 T MRI. We compared fat fractions using the Wilcoxon signed rank test and the Bland-Altman 95 % limits of agreement. The correlation between fat fractions and clinical and laboratory findings was evaluated using Spearman's correlation test, and the cut-off values of fat fractions for diagnosing fatty liver were obtained from reference intervals. RESULTS: In 54 children (M:F = 26 : 28; 5 - 15 years; mean 9 years), the dual <b>fat</b> fraction (<b>0.</b> 1 - 8. 0 %; median 1. 6 %) was not different from the triple <b>fat</b> fraction (<b>0.</b> <b>4</b> - 6. 5 %; median 2. 7 %) (p = 0. 010). The dual- and triple-echo fat fractions showed good agreement using a Bland-Altman plot (- 0. 6 ± 2. 8 %). Eight children (14. 8 %) on dual-echo sequences and six (11. 1 %) on triple-echo sequences had greater than 5 % fat fraction. From these children, six out of eight children on dual-echo sequences and four out of six children on triple-echo sequences had a 5 - 6 % hepatic fat fraction. When using a cut-off value of a 6 % fat fraction derived from a reference interval, only 3. 7 % of children were diagnosed with fatty liver. There was no significant correlation between clinical and laboratory findings with dual and triple-echo fat fractions. CONCLUSIONS: Dual fat fraction was not different from triple fat fraction. We suggest a cut-off value of a 6 % fat fraction is more appropriate for diagnosing fatty liver on both dual- and triple-echo sequences in children...|$|R
40|$|RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} a modified abdominal multislice computed tomography (CT) protocol for obese patients on image quality and radiation dose. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An adult female anthropomorphic phantom was used to simulate obese patients by adding one or two 4 -cm circumferential layers of fat-equivalent material to the abdominal portion. The phantom was scanned with a subcutaneous <b>fat</b> thickness of <b>0,</b> <b>4,</b> and 8 cm using the following parameters (detector configuration/beam pitch/table feed per rotation/gantry rotation time/kV/mA) : standard protocol A: 16 x 0. 625 mm/ 1. 75 / 17. 5 mm/ 0. 5 seconds/ 140 / 380, and modified protocol B: 16 x 1. 25 mm/ 1. 375 / 27. 5 mm/ 1. 0 seconds/ 140 / 380. Radiation doses to six abdominal organs and the skin, image noise values, and contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs) were analyzed. Statistical analysis included analysis of variance, Wilcoxon rank sum, and Student's t-test (P. 05). CONCLUSIONS: Using a modified abdominal multislice CT protocol for obese patients with 8 cm or more of subcutaneous fat, image quality can be substantially improved without a significant increase in radiation dose to the abdominal organs...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} {{to examine the effects of}} combined exercise on health-related fitness, endotoxin concentrations, and immune functions of postmenopausal women with abdominal obesity. 20 voluntary participants were recruited and they were randomly allocated to the combined exercise group (n= 10) or the control group (n= 10). Visceral obesity was defined as a visceral-to-subcutaneous <b>fat</b> ratio ≥ <b>0.</b> <b>4</b> based on computed tomography (CT) results. Body composition, exercise stress testing, fitness measurement, CT scan, and blood variables were analyzed to elucidate the effects of combined exercise. The SPSS Statistics 18. 0 program was used to calculate means and standard deviations for all variables. Significant differences between the exercise group and control group were determined with 2 -way ANOVA and paired t-tests. The exercise group’s abdominal obesity was mitigated due to visceral fat reduction; grip strength, push-ups, and oxygen uptake per weight improved; and HDL-C and IgA level also increased, while TNF-α, CD 14, and endotoxin levels decreased. Lowered TNF-α after exercise might have an important role in the obesity reduction. Therefore, we can conclude that combined exercise is effective in mitigating abdominal obesity, preventing metabolic diseases, and enhancing immune function...|$|R

We describe development of a low-magnesium (Mg) cholesterol-containing diet to accelerate atherosclerosis in this model. Male New Zealand White rabbits were fed either chow or one of four atherogenic diets: 1 % cholesterol 10 % <b>fat</b> <b>0.</b> 11 % Mg, 1 % cholesterol 10 % <b>fat</b> <b>0.</b> 40 % Mg, 2 % cholesterol 20 % <b>fat</b> <b>0.</b> 11 % Mg, or 2 % cholesterol 20 % <b>fat</b> <b>0.</b> 40 % Mg. While feed intake decreased in cholesterol-fed rabbits, {{they were able to}} maintain their body weights. Rabbits consuming cholesterol experienced profound hypercholesterolemia and tissue lipid accumulation, with plasma cholesterol levels above 1500 mg/dl for all groups at the completion of the study. Liver and spleen lipid content and liver cholesterol content also increased. Aortic arch atheroma thickness was greatest in 1 % cholesterol 10 % <b>fat</b> <b>0.</b> 11 % Mg animals. Tissue Mg levels decreased in cholesterol-fed animals compared to chow-fed controls, despite equal or greater serum Mg levels. Our results indicate that the 1 % cholesterol 10 % <b>fat</b> <b>0.</b> 11 % Mg diet was optimal at promoting hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis while minimizing health complications for the animals. The low Mg cholesterol diet will be useful to other biomedical researchers interested in utilizing the rabbit for cardiovascular disease research. </p...|$|R

People {{are fond of}} the fresh uncooked dish of okyuto {{as well as that}} of soybean curd, due to their plain taste, as the traditional, typical and prevailing dish, especially in summer season. For convenience of common daily life, the sensory test and the chemical analysis of soybean curd and okyuto, which had been manufactured and sold in Fukuoka Prefecture were carried out concerning respective 5 brands of them. By the common chemical analysis, the compositions of soybean curd and okyuto were indicated as follows. Soybean curd: moisture 89. 3 ～ 91. <b>0</b> %; protein <b>4.</b> 6 ～ 5. 8 %; <b>fat</b> <b>0.</b> 5 ～ 2. 5 %; carbohydrate 1. 6 ～ 2. 8 %; ash <b>0.</b> <b>4</b> ～ <b>0.</b> 7 %; calorie 35 ～ 47 Cal.

In 2 brands of soybean curd, AF- 2 was detected, even with lower value than the allowance. On the other hand, on account of the plain taste, distinct evaluation was hardly obtained in the sensory test, since the standard for judgment is not coincident among the panel. In addition, relationship between the evaluation and price in both soybean curd and okyuto was not estimated. 福岡県内産の豆腐およびオキュウト,各 5 銘柄を任意に生産者から購入し,官能テストおよび理化学テストを行なった. 豆腐の平均成分は,水分 90 %,蛋白質 5. 2 %,脂質 1. 6 %,炭水化物 2. 3 %,灰分 0. 6 %, 41 カロリーであって,水分が比較的に多く,また炭水化物含量も若干高いが,蛋白質,脂質およびカロリーが多少低い傾向が見られた. また 2 銘柄に殺菌料AF- 2 が検出された. 一方オキュウトは大部分が水分であって 96. 5 %に達し,蛋白質 <b>0.</b> <b>4</b> %,炭水化物 3 %,灰分 0. 2 %に過ぎず,栄養的には見るべきものはなかった. これら淡白な食品については官能テストは難かしく,特に味覚の中心をなす食感などにおいては正確な判定はできなかった. すなわちそれぞれの消費者によって評価基準が異なり,また価格との相関関係も認められなかった...|$|R
