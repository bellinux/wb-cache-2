40|$|This thesis {{report is}} {{submitted}} in partial {{fulfillment of the}} requirements for the degree of Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Engineering, 2008. Cataloged from PDF version of thesis report. Includes bibliographical references (page 31). Voting is an important national issue for every country and the whole voting process should be flawless and secured. To ensure free and fair election, Bangladesh needs a voting system where people can vote without any influence and faultlessness. Existing manual voting system has limitation and gives room for the politicians to influence voters and the people to vote in their favor and thereby it makes the voting system unfair. Such a situation can be overcome through some automated system like electronic Voter ID card making. In this thesis we have chosen two technologies that best suit for making a secured Voter ID card which ultimately contributes to a proper voting system. The first technology is RFID and the second one is BIOMETRICS. This thesis provides a brief idea of how these technologies work, what are the core features of them and how they <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> applied for <b>making</b> Voter ID card. We have done simulations for both RFID and Biometrics. It seems simulation results are influential in applying these sophisticated technologies in practical field. Afzal AftabMd. Tareq AbdullahB.

This difference in perception influences the decisions they make about their land. Despite this, little is known about decisions female landowners are making and barriers they face to formulating informed decisions that are in line with their goals. In order to understand more about female landowners’ estate planning objectives, I conducted a mixed-methods study. Through a mail survey and subsequent qualitative interviews, I found that women were more likely than men to have lower confidence confidence in moving forward with plans for the land, lower certainty that their financial resources were adequate to move forward, and less certainty when it came to future decisions about their land. However, women who were certain about their estate planning objectives were more likely than men to have a conservation-based decision.

40|$|Actually, I 2 ̆ 7 m just a setup act for Chris Buckley. He is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>making</b> the {{principal}} presentation on this panel. I 2 ̆ 7 m {{going to start}} by talking about some very simple economic features—I would not even call them principles—but features of class action litigation which you 2 ̆ 7 re all aware of. I have two basic points to make. Let me lead {{up to the first}} one. The economics of class actions are pretty simple. As you all know and everyone knows, class actions serve the purpose of aggregating common claims. This creates something of an economy of scale, hopefully, whereby a large number of claims can be resolved with, supposedly, greater efficiency and greater dispatch than resolving each of the claims individually. This would be especially true and it has been true with class actions which involve claims that are small on their face and that might not justify individual litigation but which, when joined as a class, become worthwhile to litigate. Although this point is often made, the economy of scale argument does not apply only to small claims. There is no reason not to realize economies of scale of large claims just as of small claims, but oftentimes for reasons we will talk about later, there are grounds that may caution against aggregating large claims in a class. There are broader issues with regard to aggregation itself...|$|E
40|$|For several years—since 1980 —the {{world of}} Indonesian movies “has been slept” and finally “waken up” by the {{existence}} of Ada Apa Dengan Cinta movie that is produced by Miles Production. This movie which is told about Senior High School students’ love story is so simple. It could achieve many enthusiasts of the movie goers and break in the Indonesian movie industry to the better place. By now, the development of movies industry in Indonesia shows a significant value, it is better than many years before. Furthermore, many of those movies, either they are of a cheap sort or sensational movies, are presented on the almost all of theatres in Indonesia. It also offers many differences of movies’ color; such as soft, hard, or even vague color or theme. From those varieties of colors, {{it can be seen}} or predicted that every single movie must give its own touchiness or its own way to convey the message of movie. There are many ways or methods of human to communicate or express what they want to give to the others. It likes by speaking (in verbal way), picture, symbol, hand-writing (in written way), signal language, etc. Nevertheless, people have their own way <b>to</b> communicate, which <b>is</b> then we can consider it as uniquely way, based their own culture. Just like in “In The Name of Love” movie, which is produced by Valiant Production, it applies green color as its visualization. Moreover, in “Radit & Jani” movie which is produced by IFI Production, the brown is applied as its visualization. Seeing those differences of color that is applied in that both movies, we <b>are</b> able <b>to</b> know the differentiation which shows in a contrast way, whether from what they present through both of movies have a certain meaning or purpose or not. The color that people used most <b>is</b> often utilized <b>to</b> identify what he feels exactly. So is in the movie, the color <b>is</b> used <b>to</b> show what the contain or theme of the movie is. Based on the title of those movies, we could see that both of movies have the same genre, which is melodrama. It is called so since those movies has told about love supported by such action, strained, and sadness. Although they have similarity in genres, they have different in their color visualization. Thus, the researcher <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> analysis and identify whether the meaning of color visualization of those two movies has influenced their story or not. It is simulated by the questions: what is the meaning of color visualization of those two movies? Whether is the color suitable with the movies’ story? And whether the color of movies can <b>be</b> appeared <b>to</b> strengthen the actor? In this research, the researcher <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> analysis by using semiotic analysis. According to Saussure, sign of language that is used cannot be released by several elements, they are: the signifier and the signified. Clearly, the signifier is a materiel aspect of a sign of language, while the signified is mentality aspects of sign of language. The researcher uses the semiotic analysis since this kind of analysis allows the researcher to decide whether the signs have a meaning behind—which sign <b>is.</b> According <b>to</b> Rachmat Kriyantono, this analysis has a sign system that is contextual and based on the people who used those signs. Furthermore, the method that <b>is</b> used <b>to</b> analysis the data in this research is semiotic, since a movie is also field of study that <b>is</b> really related <b>to</b> semiotic analysis and it is shaped by many kinds of sign. Moreover, this method is also used due to have strength which can <b>be</b> applied <b>to</b> many kinds of sign. The semiotic analysis in these movies will be done in three levels, they are the level of reality (that is about everything inside), the level of representation (that is the method of how we can review what is learned before), and the level of ideology. In addition <b>to</b> the data <b>is</b> gathered by observing and interpreting the signs and the symbols in the DVD of “Radit & Jani” and “In The Name of Love” movie, constructing reset questions which could make these movies interesting, choosing of which one of the properly reasons to decide the meaning, determining the method that <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> used, <b>making</b> the data classification (it can use certain codes), and analyzing the data gathered. As a result, the researcher <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> dig in and identify, subjectively, what the function of color visualization of those two movies is. If this research can be conducted properly, then, we <b>are</b> able <b>to</b> know whether the function of color visualization on these movies, its paradigm and sintagma inside. Hence, we have added our knowledge concerning to the world of movies...|$|R
