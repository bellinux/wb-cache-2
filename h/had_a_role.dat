5|$|The Crusades {{consolidated}} {{the papal}} {{leadership of the}} Latin Church, reinforcing the link between Western Christendom, feudalism, and militarism and increased the tolerance of the clergy to violence.

5|$|Although {{ultimate}} power officially rested {{with the}} country's {{government in the}} form of Sovnarkom and the Executive Committee (VTSIK) elected by the All-Russian Congress of Soviets (ARCS), the Communist Party was de facto in control in Russia, as acknowledged by its members at the time. By 1918, Sovnarkom began acting unilaterally, claiming a need for expediency, with the ARCS and VTSIK becoming increasingly marginalised, so the soviets no longer <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> in governing Russia.

40|$|Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) {{have been}} {{demonstrated}} to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> in immune regulation. In general, they are anti-inflammatory and promote Th 2 type responses, and they {{are associated with the}} alternative activation of macrophages. Interestingly, helminth infections, such as the schistosome blood flukes that cause schistosomiasis, are characterised by a Th 2 response and the accumulation of alternative activated macrophages. This would suggest that at some level, PPARs could <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> in the modulation of the immune response in schistosomiasis. This paper discusses possible areas where PPARs could <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> in this disease...|$|R

5|$|Many {{meanings}} {{have been}} suggested for the advent and nature of prehistoric art. It may have helped develop human solidarity in its early stages. Open air rock art may have acted as signposts for the route of animal migrations. Cave art {{may have had a}} ritual role in rites of initiation, vision quests or totemic ceremonies. Portable objects may have acted as notation systems and anthropomorphic figures may have <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> in religious rituals. However, most artifacts can only be understood in their context, which is often lost or poorly understood.|$|E
5|$|Rickey was a {{conservative}} teetotaler, while O'Malley freely enjoyed vices such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco. As O'Malley became {{more involved in}} affairs, he became critical of Rickey, the highest-paid individual in baseball, counting salary, attendance bonuses, and player contract sales commissions. O'Malley and Rickey had very different backgrounds and philosophies. It was O'Malley who put pressure on Rickey to fire manager Leo Durocher, who O'Malley felt was a drain on attendance. In board of directors meetings, O'Malley also opposed Rickey's extravagances. When he was with his political friends, he made fun of Rickey at every chance. Daily News columnist Jimmy Powers would deride Rickey for selling off players and for general miserliness. When Rickey asked O'Malley, the team lawyer, if he should sue, O'Malley said no. Powers' campaign became so public that after the 1946 season Rickey gave each player a new Studebaker, which gave O'Malley, a Dodgers shareholder, reason to speak ill of Rickey in the press. It {{got to the point}} where everything Rickey did was something O'Malley derided: O'Malley thought Rickey's construction of the state of the art Vero Beach spring training facility, known as Dodgertown, was extravagant; he thought Rickey's investment in the Brooklyn Dodgers of the All-America Football Conference was questionable; he fought Rickey on the team's beer sponsor; and he demanded that players return their 1947 World Series rings before receiving the new ones Rickey ordered. As team lawyer, O'Malley <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> in breaking the racial barrier as well. In particular, he had a significant role in Rickey's top-secret search for suitable ballplayers to break the color barrier and then later he <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> in assessing the ongoing legal risks to the franchise.Other accounts, however, suggest that he played a lesser role in Robinson's signing.|$|E
