5|$|About 260 {{models of}} lorry were produced, which were fitted with 35 types of engine, 20 {{different}} gearboxes, and 15 to 20 types of cabin. Many {{of the models}} were produced in small numbers, with 116 types only being represented by one or two units. Most of the differences came from special wheelbases that always needed approval from the authorities. In many cases, it is impossible even for <b>experts</b> <b>to</b> identify different models and years of production. There were 66 types of bus chassis produced, {{and the number of}} different body types built on them by various coach builders and operators is unknown.|$|E

5|$|After {{a stormy}} debate {{in which the}} {{survival}} of the government was called into question, a compromise was reached whereby Aberhart's government relinquished considerable power to a committee of backbenchers. This committee, dominated by insurgents, recruited two British social credit <b>experts</b> <b>to</b> come to Alberta and advise on the implementation of social credit. Among the experts' first moves was to require a loyalty pledge from Social Credit MLAs. Almost all signed, thus ending the crisis, though most of the legislation the experts proposed was ultimately disallowed or struck down as unconstitutional.|$|E

5|$|Although Bomis began {{a search}} for <b>experts</b> <b>to</b> vet Nupedia articles, this proved tedious. In August 2000 Nupedia had more than 60 {{academics}} contributing to the peer-review process on the site, most with doctor of philosophy or doctor of medicine degrees. Scholars wishing to contribute to Nupedia were required to submit their credentials via fax for verification.

5|$|Brown {{appointed}} {{a group of}} insurance <b>experts</b> <b>to</b> study the state's policies and put them out for bid, ultimately saving $2 million. He also required competitive bids from banks where state funds were deposited; the extra interest generated by this process generated an additional $50 million in revenue to the general fund.

Among his other accomplishments as governor were the implementation of competitive bidding for government contracts and passage of a weight-distance tax on trucks.|$|E

Wealthy industrialist Charles Bishop Weyland (Lance Henriksen) discovers through thermal imaging that there is a pyramid buried 2000 feet beneath the ice. He attempts to claim it for his multinational communications company, Weyland Industries, a subsidiary of the Weyland Corporation, and assembles a team of <b>experts</b> <b>to</b> investigate.

Non-essential state employees were advised to remain at home, and emergency workers were mobilized to quickly assist {{in the aftermath of}} the storm. In advance of the storm, many tourists canceled reservations.|$|E

5|$|The {{influence}} of Nasser's Arab nationalism over the RCC was immediately apparent.

Gaddafi propounded Pan-Arab ideas, proclaiming {{the need for a}} single Arab state stretching across North Africa and the Middle East. In December 1969, Libya signed the Tripoli Charter alongside Egypt and Sudan. This established the Arab Revolutionary Front, a pan-national union designed as a first step towards the eventual political unification of the three nations. In 1970 Syria declared its intention to join.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{similarities}} between the perpetrators, the murders were compared by Czech media and <b>experts</b> <b>to</b> a mass murder that took place two years before in Frenštát pod Radhoštěm, another Moravian town lying 90km northwards. In the attack, a 57-year-old man, Antonín Blažek, attempted {{to blow up a}} block of flats after having been ordered to vacate his flat that had been foreclosed by creditors. He first blocked both exits from the building, and then removed and opened the main gas supply into the building's corridor. Interrupted, Blažek set the gas on fire before the gas could spread throughout the whole building. The explosion and subsequent fire, however, were large enough to demolish part of the building, killing Blažek and five other people immediately and wounding eleven others, one of whom died on 17 February 2015.|$|E
5|$|Eisenhower {{would leave}} office with an {{agreement}} out of reach, as Eisenhower's technical advisors, upon whom he relied heavily, became {{mired in the}} complex technical questions of a test ban, driven {{in part by a}} strong interest among American <b>experts</b> <b>to</b> lower the error rate of seismic test detection technology. Some, including Kistiakowsky, would eventually raise concerns about the ability of inspections and monitors to successfully detect tests. The primary product of negotiations under Eisenhower was the testing moratorium without any enforcement mechanism. Ultimately, the goal of a comprehensive test ban would be abandoned in favor of a partial ban due to questions over seismic detection of underground tests.|$|E

5|$|From {{the reign}} of King James I, the {{beginnings}} of a legal profession began to develop and the administration of criminal and civil justice was centralised. The growing activity of the parliament and the centralisation of administration in Scotland called for the better dissemination of Acts of the parliament to the courts and other enforcers of the law. Throughout the late fifteenth century, unsuccessful attempts were made to form commissions of <b>experts</b> <b>to</b> codify, update or define Scots law. The legal uncertainty that this situation created prompted increased reliance on the common law found in Canon law, {{and there are a number}} of examples of statutes from this period that clearly drew from Roman law. The general practice during this period, as evidenced from records of cases, seems to have been to defer to specific Scottish laws on a matter when available and to fill in any gaps with provisions from the common law embodied in Civil and Canon law, which had the advantage of being written.|$|E
5|$|Gandhi used fasting as a {{political}} device, often threatening suicide unless demands were met. Congress publicised the fasts as {{a political}} action that generated widespread sympathy. In response the government tried to manipulate news coverage to minimise his challenge to the Raj. He fasted in 1932 to protest the voting scheme for separate political representation for Dalits; Gandhi did not want them segregated. The British government stopped the London press from showing photographs of his emaciated body, because it would elicit sympathy. Gandhi's 1943 hunger strike took place during a two-year prison term for the anticolonial Quit India movement. The government called on nutritional <b>experts</b> <b>to</b> demystify his action, and again no photos were allowed. However, his final fast in 1948, {{after the end of}} British rule in India, his hunger strike was lauded by the British press and this time did include full-length photos.|$|E
5|$|His tasks {{included}} finding <b>experts</b> <b>to</b> {{examine and}} report on his collections from the voyage. Darwin proposed to edit these reports, writing his own forewords and notes, {{and used his}} contacts to lobby for government sponsorship of publication of these findings as a large book. When a Treasury grant of £1,000 was allocated {{at the end of}} August 1837, Darwin stretched the project to include the geology book that he had conceived in April 1832 at the first landfall in the voyage. He selected Smith, Elder & Co. as the publisher, and gave them unrealistic commitments on the timing of providing the text and illustrations. He assured the Treasury that the work would be good value, as the publisher would only require a small commission profit, and he himself would have no profit. From October he planned what became the multi-volume Zoology of the Voyage of H.M.S. Beagle on his collections, and began writing about the geology of volcanic islands.|$|E
