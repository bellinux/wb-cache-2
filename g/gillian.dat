5|$|A {{strengthening}} {{ridge to}} the south turned the storm {{to the south}}west, bringing <b>Gillian</b> back over water; however, the circulation became poorly-defined and the convection decreased due to land interaction. Early on 11March the JTWC discontinued advisories. When <b>Gillian</b> was downgraded to a tropical low, the proximity to land and continued wind shear prevented initial redevelopment. The system tracked westward through the Gulf of Carpentaria due to the ridge to the south, passing just north of Mornington Island on 12March. The next day, the convection reorganised as the circulation became better defined. On14 March, the JTWC again assessed a high potential for <b>Gillian</b> redeveloping into a tropical cyclone, noting {{the appearance of a}} central dense overcast. At 06:00UTC on the same day, the BoM again upgraded <b>Gillian</b> to tropical cyclone status in the central Gulf of Carpentaria. Due to a weak trough in the region, the storm turned to the northeast. Increasing wind shear again caused the storm to lose organisation early on 15 March, prompting the BoM to downgrade <b>Gillian</b> to a tropical low.|$|E

5|$|Severe Tropical Cyclone <b>Gillian</b> was {{the second}} most {{powerful}} of the 2013–14 Australian region cyclone season and the strongest in the basin in four years. It developed on 8March, 2014, in the Gulf of Carpentaria offshore northern Australia. It drifted southeastward, moving over northwestern Queensland on 10March as a weak tropical cyclone, and subsequently turned to the southwest and later to the west. Unfavourable wind shear, land interaction, and dry air prevented much restrengthening, and for several days, <b>Gillian</b> was a weak tropical low. The storm moved northward and curved westward around the Top End of northwestern Australia, and subsequently moved across several islands in Indonesia, first Timor on 18March. On 21March, <b>Gillian</b> again became a tropical cyclone as it moved away from Indonesia. On the next day, it passed just southeast of Christmas Island as an intensifying storm, and subsequently <b>Gillian</b> underwent rapid deepening. On 23March, the Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) estimated peak 10-minute sustained winds of 205km/h (125mph). On the same day, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) estimated peak 1-minute sustained winds of 260km/h (160mph), making it a Category5 on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. Increased wind shear caused the cyclone to rapidly weaken, and both BoM and JTWC discontinued advisories on <b>Gillian</b> on 26March.|$|E

Soon, he and Dana Scully (<b>Gillian</b> Anderson) uncover a malevolent artificial intelligence which has started killing to protect itself.|$|E
5|$|Cyclone <b>Gillian,</b> which rapidly {{intensified}} from {{a tropical}} low to a Category 5 cyclone {{in less than}} 48 hours in the Australian region just one week before Hellen.|$|E
5|$|Dry air {{prevented}} the convection from initially reorganising after <b>Gillian</b> was downgraded. With a ridge to the south, the low turned westward around the Top End of northwestern Australia. On 17March, the system moved north of 10°S, {{into the area}} of warning responsibility of the Indonesian Agency for Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics. By that time, the low-level circulation was disconnected from its mid-level circulation, and land interaction with Indonesia was expected to prevent redevelopment. Late on 18March, the storm moved over the island of Timor, and over the subsequent two days passed over several other Indonesian islands. On 21March, the convection reorganised due to a drop in wind shear, and at 12:00UTC that day, the BoM again upgraded <b>Gillian</b> to tropical cyclone status while the storm was about 380km (235mi) south-southeast of Jakarta. On the same day, the JTWC also re-initiated advisories on the storm, noting that the circulation had improved as it moved away from Indonesia. With low wind shear and favourable outflow, <b>Gillian</b> gradually intensified while moving southwestward around the ridge. On 22March, the storm passed just north of Christmas Island while <b>Gillian</b> was developing an eye; by that time, the 10minute sustained winds had increased to 95km/h (60mph) within an environment favourable for continued strengthening.|$|E

5|$|The {{origins of}} <b>Gillian</b> {{were from a}} weak {{tropical}} low that persisted in the eastern Arafura Sea on 6March. The next day, the system moved into the Gulf of Carpentaria, where it developed convection, or thunderstorms, which organised into curved rainbands. The thunderstorms were located west of a circulation, was exposed due to moderate wind shear. At 06:00UTC on 8March, the Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) office in Darwin began issuing warnings on the developing tropical low. Around that time, the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC), indicated the high potential for tropical cyclogenesis due to the increasingly organised circulation and convection. At 09:00UTC on 8March, the BoM upgraded the low to Tropical Cyclone <b>Gillian,</b> and six hours later, the JTWC initiated advisories on the storm as Tropical Cyclone 17P. After its formation, <b>Gillian</b> moved slowly southward toward Queensland within an area of weak steering currents. Despite ongoing wind shear, forecasters anticipated strengthening due to warm water temperatures and favourable outflow. The storm turned more toward the southeast due {{to the influence of}} a ridge to the northeast. Early on 10March, <b>Gillian</b> made landfall along the western Cape York Peninsula of Queensland, after weakening below tropical cyclone status.|$|E
