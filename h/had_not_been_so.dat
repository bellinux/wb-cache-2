5|$|Three years later, in 1876, Colorado {{became a}} state. At the time {{settlement}} had pushed as far west from its capital, Denver, as Leadville. There was {{a variety of}} metals and minerals in the surrounding mountains, and some miners had become rich from their claims there. Those who <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> successful heard about reports from prospectors of abundant silver deposits further west, over the Divide.|$|E
5|$|As in 1905, the cyclists {{were divided}} in two categories, the coureurs de vitesse and the coureurs sur {{machines}} poinçonnées, where the riders {{in the first}} category were allowed to change bicycles, which could be an advantage in the mountains, where they could use a bicycle with lower gears. In 1905, sponsors <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> enthusiastic about entering their cyclists in this category, but in 1906 they had learned {{that it had a}} commercial advantage to have cyclists starting in the poinçonnées category, because the average French citizen could identify more with them. In 1906, {{more than half of the}} cyclists started in the poinçonnées category, including Lucien Petit-Breton, one of the pre-favourites.|$|E
25|$|The 5th Cavalry Division <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> badly {{affected}} by sickness {{and was able}} to continue the pursuit as it had garrisoned Afulah and Nazareth well away from the mosquito infested areas along the Jordan River. Nor were they involved in the fighting at Jisr Benat Yakub, when they were in reserve to the Australian Mounted Division. Allenby now ordered the 5th Cavalry Division to advance to Homs while the 4th Cavalry Division, which barely had enough men to carry out normal camp duties, remained to garrison the Zahle-Rayak-Baalbek area.|$|E

25|$|Then on 21 April, off Cape St. Nicholas in San Domingo, Reindeer {{captured}} the French privateer schooner Creole. She was pierced for 14 guns but only mounted six, not including swivel guns. She had {{a crew of}} 59 and had put another 16 men on prizes. Creole {{had a reputation for}} being the fastest vessel in those waters; Fyffe believed that he would not have caught her if Creole's captain <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> confident that he could outrun Reindeer that he tried to cut in front of her bow to gain the wind. Reindeer also destroyed another small privateer of two guns. The crew, however, escaped.|$|E
25|$|Judge Debra Ann Livingston {{wrote for}} a panel that {{took two years}} to decide the case. It found that while that act was constitutionally protected, the {{balancing}} test established by Pickering v. Board of Education actually improved the MTA's case under Mt. Healthy, since although it was speech on {{a matter of public}} concern it was disruptive to the MTA's operations since it breached the confidentiality the plaintiff was required to maintain about security matters and internal investigations as part of his job duties. Even if it <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> disruptive, the court held, his record of insubordination and deception of several of the defendants was enough reason for him to have been disciplined and fired—indeed he had even admitted he believed his job to be in jeopardy before he had contacted the Times.|$|E
25|$|When {{thirteen}} {{of these}} colonies rebelled, entering {{a war of}} secession, the strong bonds of blood, commerce, and history meant that most Bermudians sympathised with the rebels. It is entirely probable that, if Bermuda <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> remote from the continental coastline, and had the Royal Navy not enjoyed near supremacy on the ocean, Bermuda {{would have been the}} fourteenth colony to join the rebellion. As this was not possible, Bermudians initially assisted the colonists by selling them Bermuda sloops via neutral ports to use as privateers. The number is unclear, but seems to have been very many, with British authorities reporting up to a thousand, although this number is clearly impossible given other sources state the number of ships built in Bermuda during the entire century numbered a thousand. Some historians state that the Bermudian-built privateers played a decisive role in the Americans achieving independence. With trade between the rebelling colonies {{and the rest of the}} Empire banned by both sides, Bermudians were faced with the threat of starvation, as well as the destruction of their trade. The Americans were dependent on Bermuda for salt, which the islanders offered the rebels in exchange for food. The Americans insisted on receiving gunpowder. Benjamin Franklin and Henry Tucker Sr. (a colonel of the Bermuda Militia, and a former President of the Privy Council, whose son, Henry Tucker, was then President of the Privy Council and son-in-law to Governor Breure, and whose other two sons were a colonel in the Virginia Militia and a politician in the rebel administration), orchestrated the theft of a hundred barrels of gunpowder from a magazine in St. George's, which was supplied to the Americans. Following this, the Continental Congress authorised trade with Bermuda (although this trade remained illegal in Bermuda).|$|E

500|$|Following a {{brief period}} of {{training}} at Liverpool and Ingleburn, the battalion took part in a farewell march through Sydney. The Sydney Morning Herald of 4 January 1940 gave an account of their farewell march: [...] "The long khaki columns thrilled the hearts of Sydney as it <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> moved for {{a quarter of a century}} since that still, spring day in 1914 when the first A.I.F. marched through the same streets on its way to Anzac and imperishable glory; the marching was magnificent." [...] Afterwards, the battalion sailed in the first troop convoy to leave Australia on 10 January 1940, embarking upon the transport Orcades. They disembarked at El Kantara on the Suez Canal on 14 February 1940, and from there they were trucked to their camp at Julis in Palestine, where they undertook further training.|$|E
500|$|Rachel and Kurt's duet of [...] "Ding-Dong! The Witch Is Dead" [...] made Billboard Rae Votta {{long for}} them to share more material. It {{encapsulated}} everything Futterman wanted in a duet between the two; she observed [...] "it's effortless, charming, full of power musical theater vocals and Rachel gets to channel Barbra Streisand". Lee, however, felt the number was an odd choice to demonstrate their talent, and although Slezak graded it a [...] "B", he contrasted it negatively with their previous duets. West opined that the song was too insubstantial {{and gave it a}} [...] "B–". Its highest grade, an [...] "A–", came from Benigno. He noted its lack of significance to the plot and wished that the vocal split <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> strongly in Michele's favor, but called it [...] "a fun, infectious number." ...|$|E

2500|$|As {{described}} above, Adolf Berle, the 1933 Roosevelt Brain Trust's leading {{authority on}} banking law, was [...] "disappointed" [...] by the 1933 Banking Act. [...] He wished it <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> heavily compromised to satisfy Representative Steagall (a [...] "half portion" [...] {{of what the}} Glass bill originally sought). [...] Berle argued the United States needed a [...] "unified banking system" [...] (most likely through the Federal Reserve System) that would perform more like the nationwide branch bank systems in Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom (which otherwise all shared the U.S. [...] "commercial banking" [...] tradition). Berle supported separating commercial banking from other activities, but disagreed with the Winthrop Aldrich position, contained in Glass–Steagall's Section 21, that this should also apply to [...] "private bankers." [...] Berle suggested that required a [...] "separate study." ...|$|E

Flecha had tried to follow them but came through more than 2 minutes behind at the top. Camano and Voeckler, whose plan <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> smart after all, had used up most of their strengths and had been overtaken by the peloton before the top, who were 3 minutes behind at the top with yet again Rasmussen taking the points.

On the Portillon something happened in the peloton also, because now suddenly it were the riders from [...] who took over from the guys from AG2R Prévoyance and pumped up the pace.

2500|$|The Traveller was {{the poem}} which made Goldsmith's reputation. [...] Dr. Johnson, so Boswell reports, said that [...] "there <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> fine a poem since Pope's time", {{and he went}} on to write a brief but laudatory article on it in the Critical Review. [...] Two months after {{publication}} the St. James's Chronicle praised [...] "the beauties of this poem" [...] as [...] "great and various", and this opinion was seconded by the Gentleman's Magazine and in large measure by the Monthly Review, though the Monthly’s reviewer also took Goldsmith to task for his Tory suspicion of commerce. [...] Readers of all ages soon began to discover The Traveller’s merits. [...] The 17-year-old Charles James Fox admired the poem; a few years later the even younger William Wordsworth read The Traveller, and was influenced by it when he wrote his earliest surviving poem, [...] "Lines Written as a School Exercise". [...] The poem's critical reception continued high, though it often suffered by comparison with his The Deserted Village. [...] The bibliographer Egerton Brydges preferred The Traveller: ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{their return}} to New York City from a brief visit to Mar del Plata in 1930, {{the family moved to}} Little Italy in lower Manhattan. In 1932 Piazzolla {{composed}} his first tango, [...] "La Catinga". The following year he took music lessons with the Hungarian classical pianist Bela Wilda, a student of Rachmaninoff who taught him to play Bach on his bandoneon. In 1934 he met Carlos Gardel, {{one of the most important}} figures in the history of tango, and played a cameo role as a paper boy in his movie El día que me quieras. Gardel invited the young bandoneon player to join him on his [...] tour. Much to Piazzolla's dismay, his father decided that he was not old enough to go along. The disappointment of being forbidden to join the tour proved to be fortunate, as it was on this tour in 1935 that Gardel and his entire orchestra perished in a plane crash. In later years, Piazzolla made light of this near miss, joking that if his father <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> careful, Piazzolla would be playing the harp rather than the bandoneon.|$|E
2500|$|Justice Story also {{addressed}} {{an issue of}} court procedure raised by the defendants. [...] At trial, the defendants had argued that Rohrer's will had not been properly registered in Tennessee and thus did not govern the land title in Tennessee, and that the will <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> registered until after the plaintiffs' suit had already begun. The trial court had overruled these objections. [...] The plaintiffs had taken no exception to the trial court's ruling, and had not stated their right to reserve an exception. Did this create grounds for an appeal? [...] Story concluded it did not. [...] In a major statement about civil procedure, he wrote, [...] "In the ordinary course of things at the trial, if an objection is made and overruled as to the admission of evidence and the party does not take any exception at the trial, he is understood to waive it." [...] But even if the plaintiffs had managed to retain their right to object to the trial court's ruling, Story concluded, {{it did not matter}} when the will was registered in Tennessee. [...] In a major statement on probate, Story concluded that if registration is correctly made, the time of the registration is immaterial.|$|E

2500|$|On the surface, the {{two main}} {{characters}} have little in common. As O'Brian wrote in The Ionian Mission, [...] "Although (they) were almost as unlike as men could be, unlike in nationality, religion, education, size, shape, profession, habit of mind, they were united in a deep love for music, and many and many an evening had they played together, violin answering cello or both singing together far into the night." [...] This musical connection began in the first paragraph of the first book in the series, when the two characters meet at a concert. They also share a delight in puns and dry witticisms, and particularly memorable wordplay is sometimes repeated in subsequent novels in the series, years later in book-time. One character in the novel, Sir Joseph Blaine, saw the two friends as romantics, in his remarks on Maturin in HMS Surprise Chapter 4: [...] "As I was saying, strong; but not without his weaknesses. He was blaming his particular friend for romantic notions the other day - the friend who is to marry the daughter of that woman we saw just now - and if I <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> shocked by his condition, I should have been tempted to laugh. He is himself a perfect Quixote: an enthusiastic supporter of the Revolution until ‘93; a United Irishman until the rising, Lord Edward’s adviser.... And now Catalan independence. Or perhaps I should say, Catalan independence from the beginning, simultaneously with the others. But always heart and soul, blood and purse in some cause from which he can derive no conceivable personal benefit." ...|$|E
