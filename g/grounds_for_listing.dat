50|$|Larbi-Odam v MEC for Education (North-West Province) is a 1997 {{judgment}} of the Constitutional Court of South Africa which held that a government policy forbidding the employment of non-citizens (including permanent residents) in permanent teaching positions, was unconstitutional. Although citizenship {{is not one of}} the prohibited <b>grounds</b> <b>for</b> discrimination <b>listed</b> in the equality clause of South Africa's Constitution, the court found unanimously that in this case discrimination against non-citizens was unfair. It came to this decision because non-citizens are necessarily a minority with little political power, and because citizenship is a personal attribute which is difficult to change.|$|R
50|$|The ground first {{appears on}} maps in 1924.

Despite 101 run from Matthew Maynard, Glamorgan fell 29 runs short of their target, with Ewan McCray taking the best figures of the innings with 4/49.

50|$|Following its {{cessation}} as a {{venue for}} AFL football, the stadium fell {{into a state of}} disrepair, and anticipating complete demolition, the City of Greater Dandenong, on behalf of football patrons in southeast Victoria, moved quickly to nominate the whole of the facility and its <b>grounds</b> <b>for</b> heritage <b>listing.</b> The basis <b>for</b> the nomination is that the stadium was the first major stadium purpose built for Australian rules football, that its construction and ownership by the VFL provided the basis on which the league built its power base and eventual evolution to become the AFL, that it hosted the 1991 AFL Grand Final, that night time cricket games were first held at the ground, and that the members' (or K.G. Luke) stand features a mural of football legends by noted artist Harold Freedman. The state level heritage listing of Waverley Park has been cited by the Executive Director of Heritage Victoria as the seminal case for an understanding of the cultural heritage significance of 20th century places.|$|R
50|$|At {{some point}} the {{verandah}} was enclosed and in 1966, the house was converted into a duplex. When the house was sold in 1998, the owner intended to demolish it (there being no heritage listing at that time) to construct two residences for their family. However, when the Brisbane City Council Heritage Unit initiated research on the house, they discovered it {{was the work of}} one of Brisbane's few female architects in the period between the First World War and the Second World War and proposed that the property be heritage-listed, resulting in a court case to determine if the property could be demolished. The relatively short architectural career of Nellie McCredie was put forward as an argument that she was neither a serious nor significant architect and therefore the property's association with her was not <b>grounds</b> <b>for</b> a heritage <b>listing.</b> The resultant court case acknowledged that the property had been bought in good faith with the intention of demolition based on professional advice that there was no barrier to doing so, but ultimately decided that the property should be heritage-listed for its association with Nellie McCredie and not demolished.|$|R

A subject S judges that some object a is F, because S has <b>grounds</b> <b>for</b> believing that some object is F and wrongly believes that a is one such object — i. e., an object x such that S has <b>grounds</b> <b>for</b> believing that x is F.
