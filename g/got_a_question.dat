It's in my rights to take ye aside and ask it---but that ain't my style; I'm no detective. I needn't ask it at all, but act as ef I knowed the answer, or I might leave it to be asked by others. Ye needn't answer it ef ye don't like; ye've got a friend over ther--Judge Thompson--who is a friend to ye, right or wrong, jest as any other man here is--as though ye'd packed your own jury. Well, the simple question I've got to ask ye is THIS: Did you signal to anybody from the coach when we passed Galloper's an hour ago?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hold on, baron," [...] Del Bishop spoke up. [...] "Now that you're on the stand, I've <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> {{or so to}} slap into you." [...] He {{turned to}} the court-room. [...] "Gentlemen, you've all heard {{somewhat}} of the prisoner's experiences in Siberia. You've caught on to the remarkable sameness between them and those published by Father Yakontsk nearly a hundred years ago. And you have concluded that there's been some wholesale cribbing somewhere. I propose {{to show you that}} it's more than cribbing. The prisoner gave me the shake on the Reindeer River in '88. Fall of '88 he was at St. Michael's on his way to Siberia. '89 and '90 he was, by his talk, cutting up antics in Siberia. '91 he come back to the world, working the conquering-hero graft in 'Frisco. Now let's see if the Frenchman can make us wise.|$|E

5000|$|Then [...] "Beat the Crusher" [...] began. The two couples, {{now ready}} for the game, would have to answer {{multiple}} choice general knowledge questions. If a couple <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> wrong, their car would move up a level on a moving platform {{and closer to the}} crusher. If they got the question right, the opposing couple's car would move up a level. If they <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> wrong when they were above the crusher, known as the 'Danger Zone', or the opposing team <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> right, the loser's car was dropped into the crusher and destroyed. The owners received bus fare home as a consolation prize. The winning couple would then have a choice of two new cars, either a luxury estate car or a stylish four-door saloon.|$|E

Lynch and Michael only <b>got</b> <b>a</b> single <b>question</b> right and won $40 in the first round. However, they did not win any money {{in the second round}} or Head-to-Head Battles and didn't get to go to the Smart Money Round. Nonetheless, Lynch and Michael raised $1,000 for their charities.|$|R
5000|$|Contestants {{competed for}} points, not dollars. A {{contestant}} won a Disney collector's pin for each point level he passed (minus any {{down to the}} previous milestone {{if he or she}} <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> wrong). A prize table can be found below.|$|E
5000|$|First-time callers {{were also}} forbidden. Any caller {{disclosing}} their first-time status before asking their question was immediately [...] "blown up". However, second-time callers, if they revealed they <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> through without revealing {{they were a}} first-timer, would receive a [...] "polite round of applause".|$|E
5000|$|In {{the event}} that a {{contestant}} buzzed in and <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> wrong, the question would be offered to other contestants, signaled by a buzzer sounding.

60|$|It was {{not until}} some time later that Henry <b>got</b> <b>a</b> chance to <b>question</b> the {{captured}} Indians.

6000|$|... "You see, I went on {{with this}} {{research}} {{just the way it}} led me. That is the only way I ever heard of true research going. I asked <b>a</b> <b>question,</b> devised some method of obtaining <b>an</b> answer, and <b>got</b> <b>a</b> fresh <b>question.</b> Was this possible or that possible? You cannot imagine what this means to an investigator, what an intellectual passion grows upon him! You cannot imagine the strange, colourless delight of these intellectual desires! The thing before you is no longer an animal, a fellow-creature, but a problem! Sympathetic pain,--all I know of it I remember as a thing I used to suffer from years ago. I wanted--it was the one thing I wanted--to find out the extreme limit of plasticity in a living shape." ...|$|R
5000|$|The fight's bill {{comes from}} a remark made by Tarver to Jones at center ring after the referees' {{instructions}} before the second fight. The referee asked both fighters, as is customary, {{if they had any}} questions, and Tarver stated: [...] "Yeah, I <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>question.</b> You got any excuses tonight, Roy?" ...|$|E
5000|$|One of the devs explained: [...] "I {{was working}} from home, going insane. I {{found out that}} this space was {{starting}} up...It’s been incredible. If I’ve <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> from a tech perspective...I can just go and {{talk to some of}} Australia’s foremost experts...That kind of expertise is just invaluable as a developer".|$|E
50|$|Round Two: Match UpThe {{second round}} {{featured}} two columns of eight. Each {{word in the}} left-hand column could match up to a related word on the right-hand column (e.g. US states and their capitals). Each contestant had to answer two questions each. If a team member <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> wrong the opposing team {{had a chance to}} steal and the question was passed over.|$|E
60|$|So {{all three}} plays might be {{considered}} successes, and that merry Christmas night a memorable one in the March family; for Demi <b>got</b> <b>an</b> unspoken <b>question</b> answered, Josie's fondest wish was granted, and, thanks to Professor Owlsdark's jest, Mrs Jo made Professor Bhaer's busy life quite a bed of roses by the keeping of her resolution. A few days later she had her reward for this burst of virtue in Dan's letter, which set her fears at rest and made her very happy, though {{she was unable to}} tell him so, because he sent her no address.|$|R
5000|$|At the {{beginning}} of the game, twelve categories were presented, each about a famous sports figure. Contestants alternated choosing categories to answer. Most categories had questions that were deemed of average difficulty, but some contained hidden [...] "diabolical" [...] Schwab questions that were much more difficult, having been devised by the Schwab himself. If a contestant happened to choose a category that had <b>a</b> Schwab <b>question,</b> they chose to [...] "dodge" [...] it and passed it to the opponent before hearing the question, rather than answering it themselves. Regular questions were worth one point, while Schwab questions were worth 2 points. However, if <b>a</b> contestant <b>got</b> <b>a</b> Schwab <b>question</b> wrong, they lost a point.|$|R
5000|$|The game {{featured}} eight players, {{but in this}} version, {{they were}} divided into two sets of four. Before the question is asked, the order of the contestants is determined with <b>an</b> educated guess <b>question</b> (such as [...] "How many teeth does a lion have?") The one closest to the answer (in this case, 30) gets the first choice of answers from four picks (three in the second round), and the others in ascending order. If <b>a</b> player <b>got</b> <b>an</b> educated guess <b>question</b> exactly right, that contestant won a US $101 bonus.|$|R
5000|$|The Lies We Tell Ourselves, is an {{extended}} play album by American rock band thelastplaceyoulook. It {{was released on}} May 30, 2006 and produced by John Glover and Marke Townsend. The first single is [...] "I've <b>Got</b> <b>a</b> <b>Question</b> for You ... Why Are You Still Here?". Space City Rock categorized the album as having a much different sound from the band's full-length follow up See The Light Inside You.|$|E
5000|$|The word [...] "Loser" [...] {{was used}} {{excessively}} in this show. At {{the end of}} the game, before the [...] "consolation prizes" [...] and winners' prizes were announced, host Hardwick would usually say something to the effect of [...] "on Trashed, there are no winners or losers!" [...] A sound bite saying [...] "Loser!" [...] was sometimes used when a contestant <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> wrong; the word was also displayed on a screen during the bonus round if one contestant gave an invalid clue. The connotation was furthered with the Beck song Loser, which was popular at the time.|$|E
50|$|In 1982, {{in a bid}} {{to boost}} {{flagging}} ratings, Crackerjack introduced gunge into its games and launched a new game called 'Take a Chance' in which the celebrity guests - one female, one male - could score extra points for the contestant they teamed up with. Failure to answer questions correctly would lead to Stu Francis and/or the celebrity guest being covered in gunge. Additionally, the male celebrity and Francis, even if they <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> correct, would usually get gunged regardless as punishment for laughing at their opponent, although female contestants who answered correctly were generally allowed to laugh at Francis and get away with it.|$|E

He'd know how to {{straighten}} this thing out, and he wouldn't weaken over Jeff much--well, not much. But he a'n't here, and you've got to act for yourself. The way I look at it is this: you took Jeff when you knowed what a comical devil he was, and I presume you ha'n't got quite the same right to be disappointed in what he done as if you hadn't knowed. Now mind, I a'n't excusin' him. But if you knowed he was the feller to play the devil if he <b>got</b> <b>a</b> chance, the <b>question</b> is whether--whether--" ...|$|R
40|$|This is {{the panel}} {{of people who have}} been {{associated}} with B Lab for various lengths of time, but who really can put practical vision and facts before us in a way that the papers we’ve heard so far, while all really interesting, can’t quite do. All of these papers converge on this subject: what actually happens and what’s happened so far. So what I’m going to do is try to lead us through what could be an oral history, if it’s appropriately recorded, of B Lab.

40|$|I {{agree with}} Priest: the sorites {{is a very}} hard paradox, {{possibly}} harder than the liar. 1 For the liar can be isolated, whereas the sorites is everywhere and can take us anywhere. And I agree that the paradox is so hard because it systematically imposes upon us the existence of unbelievable or otherwise unacceptable cut-off points. No solution can avoid explaining why this happens. But I have two points of disagreement with Priest’s account of the matter. The first concerns the emphasis that he places on the working of natural language. And the second, more important problem concerns the line of explanation that Priest offers {{of the reason why}} we are stuck with cut-off points—hence his tentative solution to the paradox. 1. Sorites Progressions and Linguistic Vagueness Let’s focus on the forced march sorites, in the form given by Priest. We have <b>got</b> <b>a</b> series of <b>questions</b> q 0 … q n, each of the form ‘Is it the case that β i?’, and the facts are such that the answer to the first <b>question,</b> <b>a</b> 0, is different from the answer to the last <b>question,</b> <b>a</b> n. Given these facts, there is no way out: the series o...|$|R
5000|$|Each {{audience}} member could {{answer a question}} {{on his or her}} keypad {{at the same time as}} the hot seat contestant did. Contestants won points by pressing the correct button quickly; at the 1,000 and 32,000-point levels the game was paused briefly to show the top ten scores. If the hot seat contestant <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> wrong or decided to walk away, instead of additional fastest finger questions, the top scorer in the audience took his place, as long as there was time remaining. (Usually, only two full games were played.) The player with the highest score on the last game only won congratulations from the host, if that.|$|E
5000|$|... 18s are not uncommon, {{and each}} meet sees many {{individuals}} who get 18s. Coming into the 2004-05 school year, a score above 200 had been achieved only five times: twice by Diamond Middle School, twice by Clarke Middle School, and the long-standing record of 205 set by Marblehead in 1983. (This was when individual rounds were weighted 1-2-3 instead of 2-2-2.) The first meet of 2004-05 saw two teams score 200: Clarke scored 200, and Diamond shattered the record by scoring 212. Diamond scored perfect 36s {{in each of}} the rounds except for round 3 (number theory), in which 2 students each <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> wrong.|$|E
50|$|For each contestant's turn, {{they would}} be given 2:00 to answer sports trivia {{questions}} and would {{have a choice of}} 4 categories; each represented {{by a member of the}} panel, each pertaining to that panelist's area of expertise, and each containing 5 questions. If a contestant <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> right in any category, they could continue to play it or pick another category, but an incorrect answer or a pass forced them to pick another category (although they could go back to it at any time, provided there were still questions left in it). Each correct answer was worth one point, and one bonus point was awarded if the contestant swept a category (got all 5 right), for a maximum of 24 first round points.|$|E
5000|$|The dossier {{became a}} point of {{amusement}} in British politics.
