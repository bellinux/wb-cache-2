5|$|During the 1997 Asian crisis several Asian economies ran {{critically}} low {{on foreign}} reserves, leaving them {{forced to accept}} harsh terms from the IMF, and often to accept low prices for the <b>forced</b> <b>sale</b> of their assets. This shattered faith in free market thinking among emerging economies, and from about 2000 they generally began intervening to keep {{the value of their}} currencies low. This enhanced their ability to pursue export led growth strategies {{while at the same time}} building up foreign reserves so they would be better protected against further crises. No currency war resulted because on the whole advanced economies accepted this strategy—in the short term it had some benefits for their citizens, who could buy cheap imports and thus enjoy a higher material standard of living. The current account deficit of the US grew substantially, but until about 2007, the consensus view among free market economists and policy makers like Alan Greenspan, then Chairman of the Federal Reserve, and Paul O'Neill, US Treasury secretary, was that the deficit was not a major reason for worry.|$|E

We find that <b>forced</b> <b>sales</b> result in fire sale discounts.

What funds Japanese Canadians were able to receive went to supporting themselves and their families in the camps, often helping those who could not work or were not able to live off of the inadequate government subsidies.

500|$|One {{member of}} the company, Giovanni Gallini, had made his début at the theatre in 1753 and had risen to the {{position}} of dancing master, gaining an international reputation. Gallini had tried to buy Harris' share but had been rebuffed. He now purchased the mortgage. Sheridan quickly became bankrupt after placing the financial affairs of the theatre in the hands of William Taylor, a lawyer. The next few years saw a struggle for control of the theatre and Taylor bought Sheridan's interest in 1781. In 1782 the theatre was remodelled by Michael Novosielski, formerly a scene painter at the theatre. In May 1783, Taylor was arrested by his creditors, and a <b>forced</b> <b>sale</b> ensued, with Harris purchasing the lease and much of the effects. Further legal action transferred the interests in the theatre to a board of trustees, including Novosielski. The trustees acted with a flagrant disregard for the needs of the theatre or other creditors, seeking only to enrich themselves, and in August 1785 the Lord Chamberlain took over the running of the enterprise, {{in the interests of the}} creditors. Gallini, meanwhile, had become manager. In 1788, the Lord Chancellor observed [...] "that there appeared in all the proceedings respecting this business, a wish of distressing the property, and that it would probably be consumed in that very court to which ... seemed to apply for relief". Performances suffered, with the box receipts taken by Novosielski, rather than given to Gallini to run the house. Money continued to be squandered on endless litigation or was misappropriated. Gallini tried to keep the theatre going, but he was forced to employ amateur performers. The World described a performance as follows: [...] "... the dance, if such it can be called was like the movements of heavy cavalry. It was hissed very abundantly." [...] At other times, Gallini had to defend himself against a dissatisfied audience who charged the stage and destroyed the fittings, as the company ran for their lives.|$|E

This implies that <b>sales</b> <b>force</b> formation {{is not as}} easy as it may be thought of, like bringing any person and making him sell whatever products or services the company provides. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to see how the Lebanese companies establish, direct, control, and evaluate their <b>sales</b> <b>forces.</b> And in order to collect the required data for this research, two sources are used: first, interviews conducted with a sample of Lebanese managers; second, many business books and journals. The three main parts in sales management which are thoroughly explained in this research are developing, directing, and controlling and evaluating the <b>sales</b> <b>force.</b> Each part in turn deals with minor issues. Developing the <b>sales</b> <b>force</b> includes recruiting, selecting, and training the <b>sales</b> <b>force.</b> Directing the <b>sales</b> <b>force</b> consists of establishing sales territories, setting sales quotas, developing compensation plans, and motivating the <b>sales</b> <b>force.</b> The third part deals with controlling the <b>sales</b> <b>force</b> and evaluating their performance. The results of this research indicate that most of the studied Lebanese firms either do not have or only follow some steps of the <b>sales</b> <b>force</b> formation process, while the remaining few firms follow a professional managerial process in developing, directing, controlling, and evaluating their <b>sales</b> <b>forces,</b> either because they are subsidiaries of foreign companies or are supported by international firms. Finally, in order for the Lebanese companies to survive and gain foot hold in the market, they should devote much time and effort to form effective <b>sales</b> <b>forces</b> who are the only ones that generate revenues to their companies. 1 bound copy: 147, [2] leaves; ill., tables available at RNL...|$|R
