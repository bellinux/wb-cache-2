Introduction: In the whole field of {{machinery}} operation no subject is receiving {{so much attention}} today as that of driving by electric motors. It shall be our aim to treat, briefly, several classes of motors; but {{to show that the}} Stowe motor is the best type of <b>Shunt</b> <b>Motors.</b> We will start by giving the principle, operation, and use of <b>Shunt</b> <b>Motors</b> in general. <b>Shunt</b> <b>Motors</b> are composed of Field Poles, Armatures, the necessary frame work, commutator, and brushes. The field being wound with a large number of turns of small wire, while the Armature is wound with either Drum or Gramme Ring. The effect of current in the field and Armature causes a skewing of the lines of flux, causing what is known as "cross turns" and "back turns" in the Armature. The cross turns on the Armature tend to change distribution of lines of force on the role faces, skewing them over from trailing tip to entering tip {{in the case of a}} motor. To avoid piling up of these lines of force it is necessary to increase the magnetic resistance of the air gap or equivalent at the sides of the pole pieces, or by increasing the air space under the corners...|$|R
40|$|A B-spline neural networks-based {{adaptive}} control technique for angular speed reference trajectory tracking tasks with highly efficient performance for direct current <b>shunt</b> <b>motors</b> is proposed. A methodology for {{adaptive control}} and its proper training procedure are introduced. This algorithm sets the control signal without using a detailed mathematical model nor exact {{values of the}} parameters of the nonlinear dynamic system. The proposed robust adaptive tracking control scheme only requires measurements of the velocity output signal. Thus, real-time measurements or estimations of acceleration, current and disturbance signals are avoided. Experimental results confirm the efficient and robust performance of the proposed control approach for highly demanding motor operation conditions exposed to variable-speed reference trajectories and completely unknown load torque. Hence, laboratory experimental tests on a direct current <b>shunt</b> <b>motor</b> prove the viability of the proposed adaptive output feedback trajectory tracking control approach...|$|R

30|$|This paper {{proposes to}} study the concept of {{similarity}} and its use {{in the design of}} fuzzy system. The concept of similarity relation is effectively used in fuzzification of crisp values. Similarity index is used in measuring approximate (graded) equality of fuzzy sets over a given universe of discourse. It is proposed to use such an index in modifying a fuzzy relation. Different similarity measures in the literature are elucidated, and a comparative study between different pairs of fuzzy sets is presented. One of these similarity measures has been used successfully in rule selection and modification of a fuzzy relation. In the process, a number of modification schemes based on different logic have been extensively studied for different reasoning mechanisms based on the same data and results are tabulated. A specificity-based approach to defuzzification is also presented, which is found to be suitable for similarity-based fuzzy systems.

5000|$|A {{compensation}} winding in a DC <b>shunt</b> <b>motor</b> is a winding {{in the field}} pole face plate that carries armature current to reduce stator field distortion. Its purpose is to reduce brush arcing and erosion in DC motors that are operated with weak fields, variable heavy loads or reversing operation such as steel-mill motors. When flux from the armature current is about equal to the flux from the field current, the flux at the field pole plate is shifted. Under a fixed load, there is an optimal commutation point for the brushes that minimizes arcing and erosion of the brushes. When the ratio of armature flux to field flux varies greatly or reverses, the optimum commutation point shifts as result of the varying flux at the pole face plate. The result is arcing of the brushes. By adding a compensating winding in the pole face plate that carries armature current {{in the opposite direction}} of current in the adjacent armature windings, the position of the flux at the pole face plate can be restored to the position it would have with zero armature current. The main drawback of a {{compensation winding}} is the expense.|$|R
