25|$|Emma {{wakes up}} from a nightmare. In the dream, Hook, Snow White and herself are in the Underworld Graveyard {{attempting}} to use Emma's light magic to erase their names from the tombstones Hades had created. Hook sense something is wrong and a tornado appears. The three seek shelter behind a large crypt and Hook senses {{there is a large}} creature nearby. Snow attempts to face the creature and is taken away and presumably killed which wakes Emma. Emma tells Hook about the dream wondering if they are visions of the future. In the library, Regina has spent all night preparing a spell to break Hades' protection spell on the elevator by drawing runes all over the elevator door. Emma and Regina use their magic to open the door as they break the code and the door opens revealing a brick wall, their efforts proving futile. Emma outlines some of the details of the dream believing that she can erase their names from the tombstones to all everyone to leave the underworld. Hades is standing there to see Zelena when he notices a daisy growing in the broken road. Regina decides to talk to Zelena, who knows more about Hades rather than the others. When Regina visits Zelena, she realizes that her and Hades are in love. Zelena tells her that she (Zelena) is Hades' only weakness. At the underworld cemetery, Emma attempts to cast the spell from her dream, but suddenly starts believing the nightmare is coming true when the same storm appears. She, Hook and Snow ahead to Regina's vault, where Hook, Snow, and even Regina tell Emma not to give up. Emma failed everyone but she saved Hook's life. Snow White tells Emma that love <b>is</b> <b>worth</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
500|$|In {{his review}} of the 2006 remastered album, for Mojo magazine, Mat Snow said that [...] "this long overdue reissue <b>is</b> <b>worth</b> <b>it</b> alone for four {{wonderful}} songs", of which [...] "Don't Let Me Wait Too Long" [...] "reveals the lusty lad within the orange robes" [...] associated with Hare Krishna devotees. More recently, Snow has described Material World as [...] "a treat for the ears" [...] and Harrison as [...] "an old-school pop tunesmith to his marrow, [...] worked hard to ensure the choruses of 'Don't Let Me Wait Too Long,' 'The Day the World Gets 'Round,' and 'Who Can See It' caught the ear with their deep and delicious emotion".|$|E
500|$|Justin Joffe, {{writing for}} the New York Observer, praised the album as [...] "a {{stunning}} display of naked vulnerability and a notable achievement ... Radiohead remain dedicated craftsmen of strange new sonic universes." [...] Like Joffe, Nina Corcoran of Consequence of Sound praised the inclusion of older songs such as [...] "True Love Waits", writing: [...] "Waiting five years to hear previously released tracks <b>is</b> <b>worth</b> <b>it</b> precisely because Radiohead finally feels connected enough to perform them with meaning ... waiting to release a studio recording of a song over two decades old allowed Radiohead to peel its words when riper than ever." [...] Mike Diver of the Quietus, however, felt the inclusion of older songs gave the album the unwelcome feeling of a compilation album, writing: [...] "Certain tracks feel less than fully fleshed out, really given the treatment that their age warrants ... There's simply so little spark here, barely glowing embers and blackened dust where once Radiohead blazed a fascinating, furious trail for others to attempt to follow." ...|$|E

500|$|The book {{is divided}} into five {{sections}} and sixteen chapters. Each chapter is written {{from the perspective of}} one of the two authors; nine are by Eric, while Leslie writes seven, as well as the introduction. The first section, [...] "Desiring a Love Story", addresses sexual desire and lovesickness, suggesting that temporary relationships cannot fulfill those longings. Section Two, [...] "Preparing for a Love Story", advances ways in which one might, before initiating a romantic relationship, develop the characteristics of a good spouse. The next section, [...] "Waiting for a Love Story", discusses the practice of fidelity to one's future spouse before meeting them by way of sexual abstinence and argues that waiting indefinitely <b>is</b> <b>worth</b> <b>it</b> even if one's soulmate never arrives. In the fourth section, [...] "Sweetening a Love Story", the Ludys provide advice on how to proceed once the possibility of a romantic relationship has presented itself. The final section, [...] "Discovering a God-written Love Story", argues that it is never too late to give God control of one's love life, and that this sacrifice should be made not in expectation of personal benefit but rather to benefit one's future spouse and to honor God.|$|E

The album was certified double Platinum by the RIAA and sold 2.6 {{million copies in}} the United States. [...] "More than a Woman" [...] reached {{number one on the}} UK singles chart making Aaliyah the first female deceased artist to reach number one on the UK singles chart. [...] "More than a Woman" [...] was replaced by George Harrison's [...] "My Sweet Lord" [...] which is the only time in the UK singles chart's history where a dead artist has replaced another dead artist at number one. In July 2001, she allowed MTV's show Diary behind-the-scenes access to her life and stated [...] "I am truly blessed to wake up every morning to do something that I love; there is nothing better than that." [...] She continued, [...] "Everything <b>is</b> <b>worth</b> <b>it</b> – the hard work, the times when you're tired, the times when you are a bit sad. In the end, it's all worth it because it really makes me happy. I wouldn't trade it for anything else in the world. I've got good friends, a beautiful family and I've got a career. I thank God for his blessings every single chance I get." ...|$|E

Music commented {{that for the first time}} the movie includes a performance he wanted to watch, and concluded, [...] "this is definitely one of the best 'Single Ladies' parodies. It <b>is</b> <b>worth</b> <b>it</b> just to see the squirrels singing." [...] The film Sex and the City 2 features a performance of the song by American singer and actress Liza Minnelli. On October 18, 2011, Young Men Society sang [...] "Single Ladies" [...] on the third series of The X Factor Australia, and on June 30, 2014, Holly Tapp sang the song on the third series of The Voice Australia.|$|E

2500|$|In 1978, King {{returned}} to his alma mater, the University of Maine at Orono, to teach for {{a year as a}} gesture of gratitude for the education he had received there. During this time his family rented a house on a busy road in Orrington. The road claimed the lives of a number of pets, and the neighborhood children had created a pet cemetery in a field near the Kings' home. King's daughter Naomi buried her cat [...] "Smucky" [...] there after it was hit, and shortly thereafter their son Owen had a close call running toward the road. King wrote the novel based on their experiences, but feeling he had gone too far with {{the subject matter of the}} book, he discarded the idea of having it published, particularly since both his wife Tabitha and friend Peter Straub agreed Pet Sematary was too dark and unenjoyable. However, needing a final book for his contract King reluctantly submitted it to Doubleday on the advice of his wife Tabitha. The subsequent success of the book made King note how both Americans and British readers liked it despite him considering Pet Sematary too bleak in how [...] "it just spirals down into darkness.

2500|$|AllMusic {{retrospectively}} {{reviewed the}} album and said: [...] "Nobody's Fools has some really great songs on it, but {{all things considered}} it was the band's worst album at that point. Basically misguided from the get-go, Nobody's Fools is constantly trying to free itself from the oppressive production and arrangements. For the fan, this album <b>is</b> <b>worth</b> <b>it</b> for several of the tunes. For the uninitiated, skip this one - all in all, it's not one of their best." [...] In 2010, Classic Rock considered the album [...] "worth exploring" [...] and wrote: [...] "A surprisingly slick-sounding album, the singles [...] "In for a Penny" [...] and [...] "Let's Call It Quits" [...] are among its most immediate moments." [...] Colin Harper of Record Collector said: [...] "Having maintained their UK singles successes with the standalone [...] "Thanks for the Memory" [...] and top-drawer trailers for the album [...] "In for a Penny" [...] and [...] "Let's Call It Quits" [...] (all three imaginatively moving on from their big-chorus boot- stompers of 1972/73), Nobody's Fools, was to end their 17-song run of hits. Funk-rock album track [...] "Do the Dirty" [...] {{might have been a}} better choice, while [...] "Get on Up" [...] (similarly American-influenced, albeit exploding to better effect on 1978's Slade Alive II) proved they could rock stadiums with the best. A whiff of US prog can be detected but, largely, the old boozy Black Country humour is alive and well. It's engagingly eclectic, if not quite truly classic." ...|$|E
