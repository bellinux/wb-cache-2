40|$|Standard {{accretion}} disc model relies upon several assumptions, {{the most}} important of which is geometrical thinness. Whenever this condition is violated, new physical effects become important such as radial energy advection and mass loss from the disc. These effects are important, for instance, for large mass accretion rates when the disc approaches its local Eddington limit. In this work, we study the upper limits for standard accretion disc approximation and find the corrections to the standard model that should be considered in any model aiming on reproducing the transition to super-Eddington accretion regime. First, we find that for thin accretion disc, taking into account relativistic corrections allows to increase the local Eddington limit by about a factor of two due to stronger gravity in General Relativity (GR). However, violation of the local Eddington limit also means large <b>disc</b> <b>thickness.</b> To consider consequently the <b>disc</b> <b>thickness</b> effects, one should make assumptions upon the two-dimensional rotation law of the disc. For rotation frequency constant on cylinders rsinθ=const, vertical gravity becomes stronger with height on spheres of constant radius. On the other hand, effects of radial flux advection increase the flux density in the inner parts of the disc and lower the Eddington limit. In general, the effects connected to <b>disc</b> <b>thickness</b> tend to increase the local Eddington limit even more. The efficiency of accretion is however decreased by advection effects by about a factor of several. Comment: 14 pages, 13 figures; accepted for publication to MNRA...|$|R
40|$|We {{find that}} cold gas can be magnetically {{launched}} {{from the surface}} of a disc {{with the help of the}} radiation pressure, if the angular velocity of the radiation-pressure-dominated accretion disc is greater than a critical value, which decreases when increasing the <b>disc</b> <b>thickness</b> Hd/R (radiation pressure). This indicates that the force exerted by the radiation from the disc does help to launch the outflow. The rotational velocity of the gas in the disc depends on the strength of the magnetic field threading the disc and the inclination ? 0 (? 0 = Bz/Br) of the field line at the disc's surface. The launching condition for cold gas at the disc's surface sets an upper limit on the magnetic field strength, which is a function of the field-line inclination ? 0 and the <b>disc</b> <b>thickness</b> Hd/R. This implies that a more strict constraint on the maximal jet power can be extracted from a radiation-pressure-dominated accretion disc than that derived conventionally on the equipartition assumption...|$|R
40|$|Most of ultraluminous X-ray {{sources are}} thought to be objects accreting above their Eddington limits. In the {{recently}} identified class of ultraluminous X-ray pulsars, accretor is a neutron star and thus has a fairly small mass with a small Eddington limit. The accretion disc structure around such an object affects important observables such as equilibrium period, period derivative {{and the size of the}} magnetosphere. We propose a model of a nearly-standard accretion disc interacting with the magnetosphere only in a thin layer near the inner disc rim. Our calculations show that the size of the magnetosphere may be represented as the classical Alfvén radius times a dimensionless factor ξ which depends on the <b>disc</b> <b>thickness</b> only. In the case of radiation-pressure-dominated disc, the size of the magnetosphere does not depend on the mass accretion rate. In general, increasing the <b>disc</b> <b>thickness</b> leads to a larger magnetosphere size in units of the Alfvén radius. For large enough mass accretion rates and magnetic moments, it is important to take into account not only the pressure of the magnetic field and the radiation pressure inside the disc, but also the pressure of the radiation produced close to the surface of the neutron star in accretion column. The magnetospheric size may increase by up to factor of two as a result of the effects related to the <b>disc</b> <b>thickness</b> and the irradiation from the central source. Accounting for these effects reduces the estimate of the neutron star magnetic moment by a factor of several. Comment: 16 pages, 14 figures, 1 table. Submitted to MNRA...|$|R

40|$|We propose {{and discuss}} a new {{mechanism}} for the saturation of magnetic field growth for mean-field dynamos in galactic and accretion discs. A peculiar property of these dynamo systems is that the <b>disc</b> <b>thickness</b> grows with the magnetic field. The efficiency of magnetic field regeneration can be shown to have a maximum at a moderate value of the disc half-thickness h (for the Solar vicinity of the Milky Way, at about 600 pc). Therefore, at small h the dynamo action gets stronger with h and the magnetic field may grow super-exponentially. The <b>disc</b> <b>thickness</b> eventually becomes so large that the dynamo action is suppressed and a steady state is established. By comparing this nonlinearity with α-quenching we show that the latter is more efficient in establishing the steady-state strength of the mean magnetic field in real spiral galaxies. The disc inflation caused by the growing magnetic field may be important {{for the history of}} magnetic field evolution in galaxies; this effect can strongly accelerate the generation of the regular magnetic field in young galaxies. 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: An {{analytical}} {{formulation of}} the brake judder problem caused by <b>disc</b> <b>thickness</b> variation is described by using a simplified source–path–receiver model. Eigenvalue analysis is first conducted to determine the transfer mechanism from the brake source to the steering-wheel receiver. Calculations show that the peak vibration levels of the steering wheel are seen when the rotational frequency of the tyre coincides with the resonant frequency of the transfer path; in this case, only the first-order <b>disc</b> <b>thickness</b> variation is considered. The effects of two key parameters, associated with the source and the path respectively, are analytically and computationally studied. Analysis suggests that the lower pad stiffness and/or the higher bushing stiffness should effectively reduce the vibration levels. Finally, a new vibration control concept is proposed that modulates the actuation pressure; {{it is based on}} an approximate solution for the angular displacement of the disc in the model developed here. Preliminary work indicates that this concept could be very effective in reducing the receiver vibration level without sacrificing the brake performance...|$|R
40|$|We {{develop an}} {{analytic}} model {{to calculate the}} rate at which galaxy discs are heated by dark matter substructures orbiting in their haloes. The model takes into account the internal structure, mass function and accretion rate of satellites expected in the ΛCDM cosmology, as well as the growth of the disc by accretion and mergers, but it ignores resonant heating of the disc and the dynamical effects of spiral arms and bars. We calibrate this model against N-body simulations and demonstrate that it is able to reproduce the N-body heating rates to within a factor of 3 in the majority of cases. Our model gives the distribution of disc scaleheights for galaxies of different luminosities. For L* spiral galaxies, it predicts a median <b>disc</b> <b>thickness</b> of only 5 per cent of the radial scalelength if substructure is the only source of heating. The median <b>disc</b> <b>thickness</b> increases to nearly 20 per cent of the radial scalelength when heating due to gravitational scattering of stars by molecular clouds is also included. The latter value is close to the thickness estimated observationally for the disc of the Milky Way galaxy. The distribution of <b>disc</b> <b>thickness</b> predicted by the model is also consistent with a recent observational determination for sub-L* galaxies by Bizyaev & Mitronova. Thus, the observed thickness of the stellar discs of spiral galaxies seems to be entirely compatible with the abundance of substructure in dark matter haloes predicted by the standard Λ-dominated cold dark matter model of structure formation. In an Ω 0 = 1 universe, our best model of galaxy formation produces similar scaleheights, a consequence of the fact that similar amounts of substructure are accreted by haloes during the lifetime of the disc in Ω 0 = 1 and 0. 3, Λ 0 = 0. 7 cold dark matter cosmologies...|$|R

Also, in the limit λ_y≫ H the optimal growth G∝ (Ω/κ) ^ 4, where Ω and κ stand for local rotational and epicyclic frequencies, respectively, what suggests that transient growth of large scale vortices can be much stronger in areas with non-Keplerian rotation, e. g. in the inner parts of relativistic discs around the black holes. We estimate that if disc is already in a turbulent state with effective viscosity given by the Shakura parameter αλ_y>H have the most favourable conditions to be transiently amplified before they are damped.

40|$|Abstract – This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the finite element analysis and modal testing of an industrial radial flow impeller. The goal is to determine and verify the vibration characteristics of the impeller using both experimental and analytical techniques. The finite element model of the impeller with tapered blades was built using a 3 D solid element. The convergence properties of the FE model was then verified by mesh refinement and mass distribution methods. Next, a pre-test plan was performed before conducting a modal test in order to select the proper suspension points, driving point(s) and response points on the impeller. Impact testing using hammer excitation and laser Doppler vibrometer (LDV) response measuring techniques were used to measure the vibration properties of the impeller. Using a scanning laser Doppler vibrometer enabled the backplate modes to be described in terms of their nodal diameter components. The nodal diameters versus natural frequencies graph was then compared with the same results obtained from FE and hammer testing and showed good agreement. Finally, a parametric study was conducted on <b>disc</b> <b>thickness,</b> blade thickness, blade trailing, leading edge profiles and blade mistuning.

Using appropriate osmotic conditions we have examined freeze-etch replicas of freshly isolated outer segments to identify the membrane which regulates {{the flow of water}} and ions. Under isosmotic conditions we find that the disc to disc repeat distance is almost exactly twice the <b>thickness</b> of a <b>disc.</b> This ratio appears to be the same in a variety of vertebrate rod outer segments and can be reliably measured in freeze-etch images.

The experimental results are compared with EAS Monte-Carlo (CORSIKA - CRES) simulations including the detector response...|$|R
40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{dependence}} of the stellar disc flatness on the galaxy morphological type using 2 D decomposition of galaxies from the reliable subsample of the Edge-on Galaxies in SDSS (EGIS) catalogue. Combining these data with the retrieved models of the edge-on galaxies from the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2 MASS) and the Spitzer Survey of Stellar Structure in Galaxies (S$^ 4 $G) catalogue, we make the following conclusions: (1) The <b>disc</b> relative <b>thickness</b> $z_ 0 /h$ in the near- and mid-infrared passbands correlates weakly with morphological type and does not correlate with the bulge-to-total luminosity ratio $B/T$ in all studied bands. (2) Applying an 1 D photometric profile analysis overestimates the <b>disc</b> <b>thickness</b> in galaxies with large bulges making an illusion {{of the relationship between}} the disc flattening and the ratio $B/T$. (3) In our sample the early-type disc galaxies (S 0 /a) have both flat and "puffed" discs. The early spirals and intermediate-type galaxies have a large scatter of the disc flatness, which can be caused by the presence of a bar: barred galaxies have thicker stellar discs, on average. On the other hand, the late-type spirals are mostly thin galaxies, whereas irregular galaxies have puffed stellar discs. Comment: 17 pages, 17 figures, accepted for publication in MNRA...|$|R
40|$|Observations of the Galactic Centre show {{evidence}} {{of one or}} two disc-like structures of very young stars orbiting the central super-massive black hole within a distance of a few 0. 1 pc. A number of analyses have been carried out to investigate the dynamical behaviour and consequences of these <b>discs,</b> including <b>disc</b> <b>thickness</b> and eccentricity growth as well as mutual interaction and warping. However, most of these studies have neglected the influence of the stellar cusp surrounding the black hole, which is believed to be 1 - 2 orders of magnitude more massive than the disc(s). By means of N-body integrations using our bhint code, we study the impact of stellar cusps of different compositions. We find that although the presence of a cusp does have an important effect on the evolution of an otherwise isolated flat disc, its influence on the evolution of <b>disc</b> <b>thickness</b> and warping is rather mild in a two-disc configuration. However, we show that the creation of highly eccentric orbits strongly depends on the graininess of the cusp (i. e. the mean and maximum stellar masses) : While Chang (2009) recently found that full cycles of Kozai resonance are prevented by the presence of an analytic cusp, we show that relaxation processes {{play an important role in}} such highly dense regions and support short-term resonances. We thus find that young disc stars on initially circular orbits can achieve high eccentricities by resonant effects also in the presence of a cusp of stellar remnants, yielding a mechanism to create S-stars and hyper-velocity stars. Furthermore, we discuss the underlying initial mass function (IMF) of the young stellar discs and find no definite evidence for a non-canonical IMF.
