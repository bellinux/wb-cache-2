5|$|I King Æthelstan, {{declare that}} <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> the public peace {{has not been}} kept to the extent, either of my wishes, or of the {{provisions}} laid down at Grately, and my councillors say that I have suffered this too long.|$|E
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> {{many of the}} Greeks believe Pythagoras {{said all}} things are {{generated}} from number. The very assertion poses a difficulty: How can things which do not exist even be conceived to generate? But {{he did not say}} that all things come to be from number; rather, in accordance with number – on the grounds that order in the primary sense is in number and it is by participation in order that a first and a second and the rest sequentially are assigned to things which are counted.|$|E
500|$|Hooper {{made his}} debut as {{a feature film}} {{director}} with the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission drama Red Dust (2004), which stars Hilary Swank, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Jamie Bartlett. The film was not widely seen, which Hooper attributed to media coverage of torture during the Iraq War: [...] "When I started making it you could watch the movie with a wonderful sense of 'we'd never do it in our own country…they're the horrible people but it's not us.' By the time the film came out (there were) these revelations that the Americans were torturing, the British were torturing. The film became a lot more uncomfortable for the very audiences {{it was designed to}} target. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> sadly the theatrical audience does not run to see films that are openly issue led." [...] The premiere of the film in the United Kingdom came on BBC Two in 2005, making it eligible for the BAFTA Television Awards; it was nominated in the Best Single Drama category at the 2006 ceremony.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I said no word till <b>I</b> <b>had</b> cooked the ptarmigan. Then I {{spoke to}} her, {{in her own}} tongue, which she had not heard in many years. She {{straightened}} herself, so, {{and her eyes were}} wonder-wide, and she asked who I was, and where <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> speech.|$|R
60|$|Jones seemed unusually thoughtful. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> this preoccupation in him {{meant the}} {{stirring}} of old associations, and I waited silently. By and by Lawson snored mildly in a corner; Jim and Frank crawled into their blankets, and all was still. Wallace smoked his Indian pipe and hunted in firelit dreams.|$|R
60|$|The day I {{contrived}} to {{see them}} I was dressed up in a Quaker's habit, and looked so like a Quaker, {{that it was impossible}} for them, who had never seen me before, to suppose <b>I</b> <b>had</b> ever been anything else; also my way of talking was suitable enough to it, for <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> long before.|$|R

2500|$|Gompers was {{a leading}} Freemason, {{reaching}} the 32º in the Scottish Rite Valley of Washington in 1906. [...] In 1920 he wrote, [...] "In my Masonic life I have visited lodges in many lands, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> Freemasonry in many countries, particularly in Latin countries, is the principal means whereby freedom of conscience, of thought, and expression is preserved." ...|$|E
2500|$|Financially {{secure from}} his writing, Voelker {{resigned}} from the Michigan Supreme Court, telling Governor Williams, [...] "other people can write my opinions, but none can write my books. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> I can't do both so regretfully I must quit the court." [...] He continued writing, publishing several books on fishing or legal themes. The first wasTrout Madness in 1960, followed by the political drama Hornstein’s Boy in 1961. He returned to fishing with Anatomy of a Fisherman in 1964, a picture book that included the soliloquy [...] "Testament of a Fisherman", which to {{a vast number of}} trout anglers, Voelker’s piece best exemplifies the love of this sport. Voelker continued to write about fishing or the courtroom through 1960s and 1970s. He authored a column called “The Traver Treatment” in the Detroit News Sunday Magazine in 1967-68. His last book was People Versus Kirk in 1981, and the last short story of his that was published was titled “Dangling Angling Genes” and appeared in the May–June 1990 issue of Rod & Reel magazine. Several of his fishing books were anthologies of short stories he had written, some of which had already been printed in magazines like Field & Stream.|$|E
60|$|Of my {{voyage to}} Cadiz, to which port <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> de Garcia's ship was bound, {{there is little}} to be told. We met with {{contrary}} winds in the Bay of Biscay and were driven into the harbour of Lisbon, where we refitted. But at last we came safely to Cadiz, having been forty days at sea.|$|R
6000|$|... "So <b>I</b> <b>have.</b> Do none confess but the guilty? What is {{all that}} we have read about the Inquisition and the old tortures? <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> to <b>learn</b> <b>that</b> torturing <b>has</b> not gone out of the world;--that is all." ...|$|R
60|$|I was Monsieur de Montrésor's prisoner. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> {{in common}} with all others, save those at Canaples, he deemed me dead, and that, {{informed}} of it by a message from St. Auban, he had returned to Paris on the day following that of my journey to Reaux. Nevertheless, since <b>I</b> lived, he <b>had</b> my parole, {{and it was my}} duty as soon as <b>I</b> <b>had</b> regained sufficient strength, to journey to Paris and deliver myself into his hands.|$|R
6000|$|DUMBY. No, time {{to forget}} all <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>learned.</b> <b>That</b> {{is much more}} important, dear Tuppy. [LORD AUGUSTUS moves uneasily in his chair.] ...|$|E

5000|$|.....that the {{rejection}} of evolution does not necessarily involve {{the rejection}} of all of science. In fact, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> come to <b>learn</b> <b>that</b> science owes its very existence and rationale to the claims of Scripture. On the other hand, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> also <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> evolution {{is not the only}} claim of modern science which must be rejected if Scripture is assumed to be true.|$|R
60|$|I {{felt that}} I {{was a fool}} ever to have {{attempted}} to escape alone, especially {{in view of the}} fact that our plans were already well formulated to make a break for freedom together. Of course I realized that the chances of the success of our proposed venture were slim indeed, but I knew that I never could enjoy freedom without Perry so long as the old man lived, and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> the probability that I might find him was less than slight.|$|R
6000|$|... "My brethren, God is good. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> just <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> {{my wife is}} with my dear {{mother at}} the manse. I leave them in your care and in His." ...|$|R
60|$|Paul Ruttledge. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> {{one needs}} a {{religion}} so wholly supernatural, {{that is so}} opposed {{to the order of}} nature that the world can never capture it.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, not exactly; {{but through}} {{an old man}} of the tribe, who is well {{affected}} towards us, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> there is a party among them who seem bent on mischief." ...|$|E
60|$|Could <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> he {{was dead}} my heart might have been {{somewhat}} lighter, for I knew full well how terrible would be the torture inflicted upon him once the savages understood who he was.|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{life has}} been one incessant {{persecution}} from a husband whom I abhor. The law is upon his side, and every day I am faced by {{the possibility that he}} may force me to live with him. At the time that I wrote this letter to Sir Charles <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> there was a prospect of my regaining my freedom if certain expenses could be met. It meant everything to me--peace of mind, happiness, self-respect--everything. I knew Sir Charles's generosity, and I thought that if he heard the story from my own lips he would help me." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{was very}} true. Women can't go {{forth on the}} high roads and by-ways {{to pick up a}} living even when dignity, independence, or {{existence}} itself are at stake. But what made me interrupt Mrs Fyne's tirade was my profound surprise at the fact of that respectable citizen being so willing to keep in his home the poor girl for whom it seemed there was no place in the world. And not only willing but anxious. I couldn't credit him with generous impulses. For it seemed obvious to me from what <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that,</b> to put it mildly, he was not an impulsive person.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>learned,</b> latterly, <b>that</b> Mr. Marchinton {{had a great}} search {{made for}} me. It was his {{impression}} I was drowned, and several places were dragged for my body. This opinion lasted until news of my being in New York reached the family.|$|R
6000|$|... "And <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> {{you have}} been {{watching}} with me by night, and working by day, when you never should have worked at all. To think {{that you should be}} reduced to that, and I not know it!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I shall endeavor, and now I am as {{grateful}} for the pain as for the joy, because together they will {{show me how to}} live, and when <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> I shall be ready to come to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I would {{scarcely}} recognize you, John Carter, {{but there}} is no other mortal upon Barsoom who would have done what you have for me. I think <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> {{there is such a thing}} as friendship, my friend." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed, I {{shall not}} hold my tongue," [...] said the step-daughter. Poor Greene! He had {{lost more than}} his box within the last twelve months; for, as <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> in <b>that</b> whispered {{conversation}} over the tea- table with Sophonisba; this was in reality her papa's marriage trip.|$|R
60|$|Long {{after two}} miles had been covered, and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> begun to {{associate}} Jim's biscuits {{with a certain}} soft seat near a ruddy fire, I was apparently still the same distance from my landmark crag. Suddenly a slight noise brought me to a halt. I listened intently. Only an indistinct rattling of small rocks disturbed the impressive stillness. It {{might have been the}} weathering that goes on constantly, and it might have been an animal. I inclined to the former idea till I saw Satan's ears go up. Jones had told me to watch the ears of my horse, and short as had been my acquaintance with Satan, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> he always discovered things more quickly than I. So I waited patiently.|$|R
6000|$|... "My duty, certainly," [...] {{interrupted}} the young captain, hotly, [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>have</b> yet to <b>learn</b> <b>that</b> your orders constitute my duty." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They were subscribed for {{because it}} was an Allinson venture; but we'll leave that point for a while. I feel {{justified}} in asking your attention as Rain Bluff shareholders--though <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> Leonard has lately reduced his holding." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{will find}} coffee much more {{agreeable}} {{as well as}} better for you. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> from experience," [...] said the middy, pouring out a tiny cupful from an earthen coffee-pot that always stood simmering beside the charcoal fire.|$|E
6000|$|... "Because <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> they {{attacked}} you {{in their own}} country, Vernoon," [...] she answered, [...] "and would have killed you {{had it not been}} for Little Bonsa. It is therefore right that they should die as an offering to you." ...|$|E
60|$|A {{few moments}} later the cone was jammed {{together}} and thrown upon the floor--a movement, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> to know, <b>that</b> announced that the sitting was ended.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's your {{trouble that}} you're a confiding man. But <b>I</b> guess you <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> it doesn't pay {{to take any}} chances when you deal with Mappin." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, sir, those rockets {{did all the}} mischief; for <b>I</b> <b>have</b> since <b>learned</b> <b>that,</b> as soon as {{the first}} one was thrown, Master Yvard tripped his kedge and went out of the bay as quietly as one goes out of a dining-room when he don't wish to disturb the company." ...|$|R
