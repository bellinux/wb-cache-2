50|$|No. 4767, {{built at}} Crewe and {{delivered}} in December 1947, had outside Stephenson valve gear: instead of eccentrics, double return cranks {{were used to}} drive the <b>eccentric</b> <b>rods,</b> and a launch-type expansion link was used. This one cost £13,278, which was about £600 more than those built {{at the same time}} with Walschaerts' valve gear. The aim of the experiment was to find out if a valve gear having variable lead (as opposed to the constant lead of the Walschaerts' motion) would affect performance.

5000|$|The tug {{is powered}} by a {{compound}} double-acting, vertical-inverted steam reciprocating engine, a common type for tugboats. A 12 in high-pressure cylinder operates at [...] (now [...] ), while a 25 in low-pressure cylinder takes the high-pressure cylinder's exhaust at 17psi. Both cylinders have a stroke of 22 in, offset by 90 degrees to keep the engine from being stuck on center. A manual jacking gear acts as a further measure to prevent sticking on center. Stephenson valve gear permits reversing, aided by a steam reversing engine or ram to adjust <b>eccentric</b> <b>rods.</b> The propeller has a diameter of 6.75 ft with a pitch of 8.66 ft.|$|R
50|$|A better {{solution}} was to use a single double-sided gab. These were initially X-shaped and sat between the two connecting pins. X-gabs were also usually reversed, so that the gab {{was placed on the}} valve spindle and the pins were instead connected to the <b>eccentric</b> <b>rods.</b> The gab now stayed still vertically and the pins were moved up and down to engage them. This was done by joining both pins with a short vertical bar. The driver's reversing lever moved the centre of this bar, thus the pins, up and down to engage one at a time with opposite faces of the X-gab. This valve gear was used on Stephenson's locomotives of the early 1830s, such as Rocket.|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} the <b>eccentric</b> <b>rod,</b> {{close to}} the radius hanger, the rod {{connected}} to the transmission yoke. The upper end of this rod connected to a bellcrank, which translated the up and down motion of the transmission yoke into back and forth motion of the valves.|$|E
5000|$|A {{main link}} which pivoted {{in the middle}} from {{the lower end of}} the swing links and whose lower end was {{connected}} to the <b>eccentric</b> <b>rod</b> (which in turn connects to the return crank on the driver, as in the Walschaert gear). This link had a characteristic [...] "J"-shape.|$|E
50|$|Unlike the Walschaerts and Baker systems, the Southern {{valve gear}} {{dispensed}} with the combination lever which transmitted {{some of the}} crosshead motion to the valves. As with those systems it used a return crank on a driver (instead of the eccentrics used by the Stephenson valve gear). The return crank attached to the <b>eccentric</b> <b>rod,</b> which hung from a pivot close {{to the far end}} of the <b>eccentric</b> <b>rod.</b> This pivot attached to the end of the radius hanger, the other end of which attached to a link block which slid back and forth in a track curved in the same manner as the expansion link of a Walschaerts gear. In this system, however, the track was fixed in place; sliding the link block back and forth controlled reversing and cutoff.|$|E
50|$|The {{auxiliary}} crankshaft drove {{both the}} <b>eccentric</b> <b>rods</b> {{and the combination}} levers of the valve gear. The piston valves were of the outside admission type. The valve heads were connected by a double girder arrangement, each actuated by a vertical rocking shaft located between the two girders and midway between the two heads, with a further connecting link pivoted just behind the valve head nearest the front. A sealed oscillating shaft drove the offset upper rocker arm and link, and the whole assembly worked inside the exhaust space of the steam chest. The advantage of having admission steam working on the outside faces of the valves meant that the volume under maximum pressure was completely sealed at the ends with no glands susceptible to leakage.|$|R
50|$|In the United Kingdom, {{locomotives}} having Stephenson {{valve gear}} normally had this mounted {{in between the}} locomotive frames. In 1947, the London, Midland and Scottish Railway built a series of their Stanier Class 5 4-6-0 locomotives, most of which had the Walschaerts' valve gear that was normal for this class, but one of them, no. 4767, had Stephenson valve gear mounted outside the wheels and frames. Instead of eccentrics, double return cranks were used to drive the <b>eccentric</b> <b>rods,</b> and a launch-type expansion link was used. This one cost £13,278, which was about £600 more than those built {{at the same time}} with Walschaerts' valve gear.

5000|$|During the 1830s {{the most}} popular valve drive for {{locomotives}} was known as gab motion in the U.K. and V-hook motion in the U.S.A. The gab motion incorporated two sets of <b>eccentrics</b> and <b>rods</b> for each cylinder; one eccentric was set to give forward and the other backwards motion to the engine and {{one or the other}} could accordingly engage with a pin driving the distribution valve by means of the gabs: - vee-shaped ends to the <b>eccentric</b> <b>rods</b> supposed to catch the rocker driving the valve rod whatever its position. It was a clumsy mechanism, difficult to operate, and only gave fixed valve events. In 1841 two employees in Stephenson’s locomotive works, draughtsman William Howe and pattern-maker William Williams, suggested the simple expedient of replacing the gabs with a vertical slotted link, pivoted at both ends to the tips of the <b>eccentric</b> <b>rods.</b> To change direction, the link and rod ends were bodily raised or lowered by means of a counterbalanced bell crank worked by a reach rod that connected it to the reversing lever. This not only simplified reversing but it was realised that the gear could be raised or lowered in small increments, and thus the combined motion from the “forward” and “back” eccentrics in differing proportions would impart shorter travel to the valve, cutting off admission steam earlier in the stroke and using a smaller amount steam expansively in the cylinder, using its own energy rather than continuing to draw from the boiler. It became the practice to start the engine or climb gradients at long cutoff, usually about 70-80% maximum of the power stroke and to shorten the cutoff as momentum was gained to benefit from the economy of expansive working and the effect of increased lead and higher compression {{at the end of each}} stroke. This process was popularly known as [...] "linking up" [...] or “notching up”, the latter because the reversing lever could be held in precise positions by means of a catch on the lever engaging notches in a quadrant; the term stuck even after the introduction of the screw reverser. A further intrinsic advantage of the Stephenson gear not found in most other types was variable lead. Depending on how the gear was laid out, it was possible to considerably reduce compression and back pressure at the end of each piston stroke when working at low speed in full gear; once again as momentum was gained and cutoff shortened, so lead was automatically advanced and compression increased, cushioning the piston at the end of each stroke and heating the remaining trapped steam in order to avoid temperature drop in the fresh charge of incoming admission steam.|$|R

The expansion link holds the radius bar (8), captive by a die block which is integral with the radius bar but is free to move vertically in a constrained curved path along the expansion link.|$|E
50|$|Details of {{the gear}} differ principally in the {{arrangement}} of the expansion link. In early locomotive practice, the <b>eccentric</b> <b>rod</b> ends were pivoted at the ends of the link while, in marine engines, the <b>eccentric</b> <b>rod</b> pivots were set behind the link slot (or below on a vertical engine). These became known respectively as the 'locomotive link' and the 'launch link'. The launch link superseded the locomotive type as it allows more direct linear drive to the piston rod in full gear and permits a longer valve travel within a given space by reducing the size of eccentric required for a given travel. Launch-type links were pretty well universal for American locomotives right from the 1850s but, in Europe, although occurring as early as 1846, they did not become widespread until around 1900. Larger marine engines generally used the bulkier and more expensive marine double-bar link, which has greater wearing surfaces and which improved valve events by minimising geometric compromises inherent in the launch link.|$|E

5000|$|Abner Doble {{considered}} Stephenson valve gear: [...] "(...) {{the most}} universally suitable valve gear of all, {{for it can}} be worked out for a long engine structure or a short one. It {{can be a very}} simple valve gear and still be very accurate, but its great advantage is that its accuracy is self-contained, for the exact relationship between its points of support (eccentrics on shaft, valve crosshead, and link hanger arm) have but little effect on the motion of the valve. Its use on engines in which all the cylinders lie in one plane, represents, in the belief of the writer, the best choice." [...] Another benefit of the Stephenson gear, intrinsic to the system, is variable lead: usually zero in full gear and increasing as cutoff is shortened. One consequent disadvantage of the Stephenson gear is that it has a tendency to over-compression {{at the end of the}} stroke when very short cut-offs are used, and therefore the minimum cut-off cannot be as low as on a locomotive with Walschaerts gear. Longer <b>eccentric</b> <b>rods</b> and a shorter link reduce this effect.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Because {{of complex}} flow characteristics, polymer {{flooding}} produced liquid can bring many {{problems such as}} serious <b>eccentric</b> wear of <b>rod</b> and tube, breaking and divorcing of rod, and shortened cycle of pump-check. Flow resistance experiment was carried out aimed at these problems. Experimental results show that on-way resistance that sucker rod acts on polymer flooding produced liquid mainly depends on the viscosity of liquid and its elasticity can be ignored; Local resistance caused by couplers and centralizers is mainly related to the velocity of produced liquid, while the effect brought by mass concentration can be neglected; Resistance that pump valve endued and rate of flow agree to the exponential law; Total resistance of pump valves is generated mainly by down-valve and the law of resistance that water and polymer solution act on valves are similar. The problems that <b>eccentric</b> wear of <b>rods</b> and tubes is serious and the cycle of pump-check is shortened are not completely caused by up stress increasing after polymer flooding...|$|R

There is a rush from every quarter of the shops, a cloud of flying natives, and a procession of more sedately pacing Englishmen, and in three short minutes you are left absolutely alone among arrested wheels and belts, pulleys, cranks, and cranes--in a silence only broken by the soft sigh of a far-away steam-valve or the cooing of pigeons. You are, by favour freely granted, at liberty to wander anywhere you please through the deserted works. Walk into a huge, brick-built, tin-roofed stable, capable of holding twenty-four locomotives under treatment, and see what must be done to the Iron Horse once in every three years if he is to do his work well. On reflection, Iron Horse is wrong. An engine is a she--as distinctly feminine as a ship or a mine. Here stands the Echo, her wheels off, resting on blocks, her underside machinery taken out, and her side scrawled with mysterious hieroglyphics in chalk. An enormous green-painted iron harness-rack bears her piston and <b>eccentric</b> <b>rods,</b> and a neatly painted board shows that such and such Englishmen are the fitter, assistant, and apprentice engaged in editing that Echo.

50|$|The {{mechanism}} {{is a little}} less obvious {{than that of the}} other types, but control is fundamentally like that of the Baker system. In this case the controlling factor is the angle between the radius hanger and the transmission yoke; when they are parallel, there is little up-down motion of the transmission yoke and the engine is centered. As link block moves back and forth, the angle of the radius hanger changes, and the up and down motion of the transmission yoke in response to the back and forth motion of the <b>eccentric</b> <b>rod</b> is increased or decreased.|$|E

5000|$|As a {{harmonic}} valve gear, the Stephenson arrangement may {{be considered}} as optimum. Nevertheless, the fact the link needed to be bodily displaced in order to reverse meant that it required considerable vertical clearance.

Because valve gears in Britain were generally placed between the frames beneath the boiler, the extremely cramped conditions made the valve gear inaccessible for servicing.

50|$|It is {{most often}} {{employed}} in steam engines and used to convert rotary into linear reciprocating motion in order to drive a sliding valve or a pump ram. In order to do so an eccentric usually has a groove at its circumference around which is closely fitted a circular collar (eccentric strap) attached to which an <b>eccentric</b> <b>rod</b> is suspended {{in such a way}} that its other end can impart the required reciprocating motion. A return crank fulfils the same function except that it can only work at the end of an axle or on the outside of a wheel whereas an eccentric can also be fitted to the body of the axle between the wheels. Unlike a cam, which also converts rotary into linear motion at almost any rate of acceleration and deceleration, an eccentric or return crank can only impart simple harmonic motion.|$|E
50|$|All {{the driving}} wheels have an {{out-of-balance}} {{which is caused}} by their off-center crank pins and attached components. The main driving wheels have the greatest unbalance since they have the biggest crankpin {{as well as the}} revolving portion of the main rod. They also have the valve gear eccentric crank and the back end of the <b>eccentric</b> <b>rod.</b> In common with the linked driving wheels they also have their own portion of the side rod weight. The part of the main rod assigned a revolving motion was originally measured by weighing it supported at each end. A more accurate method became necessary which split the revolving and reciprocating parts based on the position of the center of percussion. This position was measured by swinging the rod as a pendulum. The unbalance in the remaining driving wheels is caused by a crankpin and side rod weight. The side rod weights assigned to each crankpin are measured by suspending the rod on as many scales as there are crankpins or by calculation.|$|E
25|$|Wankel engines {{generally}} {{are able to}} reach much higher engine revolutions than reciprocating engines of similar power output. This {{is due to the}} smoothness inherent in circular motion, and the absence of highly stressed parts such as crankshafts, camshafts or connecting <b>rods.</b> <b>Eccentric</b> shafts do not have the stress related contours of crankshafts. The maximum revolutions of a rotary engine is limited by tooth load on the synchronizing gears. Hardened steel gears are used for extended operation above 7000 or 8000rpm. Mazda Wankel engines in auto racing are operated above 10,000rpm. In aircraft they are used conservatively, up to 6500 or 7500rpm. However, as gas pressure participates in seal efficiency, racing a Wankel engine at high rpm under no load conditions can destroy the engine.|$|R

Oil tubing failure which commonly happens {{during the course of}} oilfield development and production can bring severe economic loss because of the failure accidents caused by the <b>eccentric</b> friction of <b>rods</b> and tubing account for a great percentage. It has a great of significance to study on the fatigue fracture situation and the critical eccentric friction depth of tubing with defects. Oil tubings of J 55 material with the specification of Ф 73 * 5. 51 commonly used in oilfields were chosen to be the source of semi-ellipse surface crack tensile specimens. Residual life of oil tubing with different eccentric friction percentages was studied through tensile tests. The critical eccentric friction percentage under which the residual life of oil tubing can meet pump detection period was determined, which provides reference for making a reasonable failure standard of tubing. From the tensile test results of the oil tubings of J 55 material simulating the condition that the eccentric friction depth accounts for 30 % ~ 50 % of the wall thickness, the critical friction depth of oil tubing of J 55 material is 43. 0 % of the wall thickness. 1...|$|R
40|$|This {{project will}} {{investigate}} {{the economic and}} technical potential of decoupled drive structures for servo presses. The original working hypotheses about economic potentials that decoupling leads to -higher dynamics, -Energy savings and -lower cost, were undetectable. These effects occur only to a small extent {{even in the best}} case. Nevertheless, one can see in the decoupling of the drive trains economic potential. This refers mainly to the development of universal drive modules. Through such modules, possibly designed by modular principle, the design and manufacturing costs for servo presses can be reduced. Another aspect is the possibility of the flexible arrangement of these modules without geometric restrictions that result from the coupling elements. For analysis of the technical potential of decoupled drive structures initially a property analysis of the coupled machine was performed and their tilting behavior was determined. It was found that the resulting tilt of the plunger is determined by three effects 1. translational stiffness of the drive trains (<b>eccentric</b> gear, connecting <b>rod,</b> stroke adjustment, overload protection); 2. translational stiffness of the press frame; 3. rotatory stiffness of the coupling shaft. The synchronization of the drive train is of significant importance for the decoupled drive structure. There have been developed and implemented various concepts for the synchronization control. The classic synchronization concept shows almost the same tilting behavior as the coupled drive structure. This behavior was expected, since in this case only the coupling shaft has been replaced by an "electric shaft". An extension of this concept by a superimposed tilt controller, which is to compensate the influence of the translational stiffness, proved to be problematic. The reason is the strong tendency to instability of this controller, caused by clearance and non-linearities in the drive train. The expected improvement of the tilting behavior could not be detected...|$|R
