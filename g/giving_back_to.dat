25|$|La música en Cuba (The Music of Cuba) is an ethno-musicological {{study of}} the Music of Cuba {{starting}} from the sixteenth century {{with the arrival of}} European explorers, until the present day of publication, the mid-twentieth century. The blending of different culturesblack, white, mulattoes, criollos and nativesmirrors the blending of Cuba’s two main musical styles, the Christian European music and the elemental percussion and rhythm-based music of the transported Africans and aboriginal peoples of the island. The book includes a general history of music in colonized Latin America but mainly focuses on Cuban styles of music and dance, influential Cuban musicians and Cuban musical identity. Carpentier devotes a great deal of his study to exploring the influence African descendants had on Cuban music. He has an entire chapter titled, “Los Negros” ("The Blacks") that explores the many substantial ways African music influenced all of Latin American music. According to Carpentier, the African influence on Cuban music in particular was deliberately concealed by the colonist prejudice of 18th and 19th century Cuba. At the time of the book's publication many white Cubans were reluctant to even acknowledge the blending of the cultures much less investigate it. Carpentier, though, was eager to do so and by making bold statements about Cuba’s past and integral relationships {{with a wide range of}} cultures he succeeded in <b>giving</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Cuba an in-depth academic perspective of its own cultural identity through its music.|$|E
