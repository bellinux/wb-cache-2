5|$|It's {{really a}} dance-off between a more {{sophisticated}} 'in-fashion' Destiny's Child versus a more 'street' Destiny's Child. And in the end a third Destiny's Child even more fierce takes over. It's {{a lot of hard}} work <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>because</b> we have to learn three routines for the same song. People will be shocked because it's different for us. They've never seen us really dance.|$|E
25|$|I think Neal {{did a lot}} of {{marvelous}} things <b>for</b> <b>us,</b> <b>because</b> {{even though}} what he did was a different thing and not quite the style but sort of a different sound, I think it was quite musical.|$|E
25|$|Matt McCoy, {{a senior}} walk-on, {{is a young}} man that has been working for {{the last three or four}} years. We would {{certainly}} not take a redshirt off Sherrod Harris at this point; it would be unfair for him because he has sat this year with the idea that he'll start the spring as a redshirt freshman. And then Mack (Brown) and I will sit down and discuss the possibility of an emergency situation as we've done in the past; one year Tony Jeffrey worked as quarterback <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>because</b> he had played quarterback in high school. So we'll sit down and look at some different options as to which way we would go. It would certainly be somebody that we think can run the offense and have a limited package for those guys. I don't think we'll need an emergency quarterback, but we'll certainly have a third guy ready.|$|E

500|$|When {{the band}} was first started, their lead vocalist {{introduced}} them to bands such as Red Hot Chili Peppers and Faith No More, and the group has since cited them as major influences to their musical style. The group is considered to have launched the careers of {{three members of the}} nu metal band Korn. Drummer David Silveria said that [...] "L.A.P.D. really was good <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>because</b> we learned about the industry and how things work." [...] Korn has influenced bands such as Slipknot, Saliva, Breaking Benjamin, Cold, and Flyleaf.|$|E
500|$|A {{power cut}} at Old Trafford delayed {{proceedings}} against West Ham on 10January, a match that ended 4–1 to Manchester United. The partnership of Yorke and Cole {{was starting to}} click, evident in the 6–2 win at Leicester City. Five goals were scored {{in the second half}} including a hat-trick for the former, cutting Chelsea's lead at the top to two points. On 31 January, Manchester United moved a point clear at the Premiership summit {{for the first time in}} the season. Yorke's late header in the 89th minute made the 1–0 victory at Charlton Athletic their third consecutive league win (fifth in the month). Ferguson praised the team's resolve, adding, [...] "It's a good result <b>for</b> <b>us,</b> <b>because</b> there are games where you have to dig in and find a result." ...|$|E
500|$|Rubin {{encouraged}} a [...] "back to basics" [...] approach and wanted {{the group to}} bring finished songs to the studio. This approach conflicted with U2's freeform recording style, by which they improvised material in the studio. The Edge said, [...] "we sort of hadn't really finished the songs. It's typical <b>for</b> <b>us,</b> <b>because</b> it's {{in the process of}} recording that we really do our writing." [...] Bassist Adam Clayton said, [...] "once we have a song, we're interested in the atmospherics and the tones and the overdubs and the different stuff you can do with it... things that Rick was not in the slightest bit interested in. He was interested in getting it from embryonic stage to a song that could be mixed and put on a record." [...] They ultimately decided to shelve the material recorded with Rubin, but expressed interest in revisiting it in the future.|$|E

500|$|In December 2010, Jason Lipshutz of Billboard {{magazine}} {{reported that}} Los Tigres del Norte {{was set to}} record a MTV Unplugged album for MTV Tr3s. The album was to be taped {{in the first quarter}} of 2011, and would feature special guests including Juanes, Calle 13, Andrés Calamaro and Zack de la Rocha. By February 2011, it was announced that Paulina Rubio and Diego Torres would join the band for the album recording session. For the band this presented a unique opportunity to re-invent their music and share the stage with talented performers. [...] "When MTV invited us to record the show, we were a little tense, this was something different <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>because</b> Unplugged albums on MTV are usually recorded by artists from different genres from us," [...] the band said about the recording. Jesús Lara of MTV Tr3s called the production [...] "historic", since the band has been culturally a part of the life of the Hispanic community in Mexico and the US.|$|E
500|$|Following relegation {{from the}} Premier League {{at the end}} of the 2010–11 season, Barry Ferguson and Lee Bowyer left the club, giving Fahey the chance to {{establish}} himself in his preferred central position. After recovering from hernia surgery early in the 2011–12 season, he partnered Jonathan Spector in a solid midfield supporting two attacking wide players. Later in the season, he played a defensive support role alongside the more attacking Jordon Mutch, and manager Chris Hughton suggested he was [...] "enjoying playing in that central role and he's enjoying the development he's had there all season". When he suffered a groin problem that caused him to miss the last few weeks of the season, Hughton called it [...] "a real blow <b>for</b> <b>us...</b> <b>because</b> he's a player that has been in really good form". He scored four goals during the season, including [...] "a venomous left-foot drive from 20 yards" [...] at Barnsley and a goal he [...] "couldn't have hit... any sweeter first time, or with any more power" [...] at home to Crystal Palace that earned him the club's Goal of the Season award.|$|E
500|$|Recording {{sessions}} {{of the basic}} instrumental tracks for Wrapped in Red took place in Kurstin's Echo Studio in Los Angeles while orchestral sessions were recorded at EastWest Studios in Hollywood and featured vocals recorded in The Barn studio in Nashville. In recording tracks for the album, Clarkson and Kurstin wanted to showcase as many different styles as they could by experimenting in various sounds and styles to create fresh, contemporary sound to classic-sounding music. Kurstin recalled: [...] "It {{was a lot of}} fun <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>because</b> we got to go back to our roots. When Kelly started singing, it was clear she had the chops and had been trained to do anything." [...] He further added: [...] "We really experimented. It was so much fun and liberating. And it pays off." [...] Kurstin, who studied with jazz musician Jaki Byard at The New School for Jazz and Contemporary Music, recruited various jazz and soul musicians such as James Gadson, Kevin Dukes, Roy McCurdy, and Bill Withers to perform on the record to resonate a Memphis soul sound. He also collaborated with Joseph Trapanese to arrange and conduct a chamber orchestra.|$|E

500|$|The {{video was}} shot as a [...] "first-person {{narrative}} about the horrors {{leading up to}} the final moments of a soldier at war", and was described as [...] "a single, long and tight close-up of the soldier's eye with images clearly reflected within his pupil and iris and perfectly choreographed with the rhythm of the music. Reflected are disconcerting images of para trooping into enemy territory, gunfire, helicopters and tanks, explosions, poignant flashbacks of his wife and child and home, and the images of his death." [...] Two endings were shot; one in which the soldier is killed as the result of sustained combat wounds, and another in which the soldier commits suicide by hanging - the latter one was used. Jeff Hanneman confirmed that the band [...] "loved" [...] the eye concept, and [...] personally felt that the video was [...] "pretty amazing" [...] when he first viewed it. King admitted that the film is [...] "pretty cool — I thought it was neat idea — very different, especially <b>for</b> <b>us,</b> <b>because</b> we usually do performance based videos." [...] The video was exclusively posted on mp3.com late in October 2006. In April 2007, it was announced that the video had earned a Metal Hammer Golden Gods Awards nomination for Best Video with the winner to be revealed on June 11, 2007, at the Koko Club in London, England.|$|E
