5|$|Lit torches (burning sticks) {{were likely}} the {{earliest}} form of <b>incendiary</b> device. They {{were followed by}} <b>incendiary</b> arrows, which were used throughout the ancient and medieval periods. The simplest flaming arrows had oil- or resin-soaked tows tied just below the arrowhead and were effective against wooden structures. Both the Assyrians and the Judeans used fire arrows at the siege of Lachish in 701 BC. More sophisticated devices were developed by the Romans which had iron boxes and tubes which were filled with <b>incendiary</b> substances and attached to arrows or spears. These arrows needed to be shot from loose bows, since swift flight extinguished the flame; spears could be launched by hand or throwing machine.|$|E
5|$|The use of <b>incendiary</b> devices had {{decreased}} by the 14th century, {{perhaps due to}} the economic realities of war where it became increasingly important that captured castles and towns were undamaged. Moreover, fewer wooden engines and structures were employed in the battlefield after the late 13th century, {{perhaps because of the}} prior success of the <b>incendiary</b> weapons at destroying them.|$|E
5|$|The years 904–906 saw {{the use of}} <b>incendiary</b> {{projectiles}} called 'flying fires' (fei-huo). Needham (1986) {{argues that}} gunpowder was first used in warfare in China in 919 as a fuse for the ignition of another <b>incendiary,</b> Greek fire. Initially, gunpowder mixtures were utilised through traditional engines and throwing mechanisms; containers and grenades were thrown by mangonels and trebuchets, and explosive rockets and arrows were developed, along with gunpowder flamethrowers.|$|E

Walker noticed some <b>incendiaries</b> which had fallen out of the bomb bay of a reserve Lancaster located near the main bomb dump. The <b>incendiaries</b> had ignited. Walker drove out to the plane and tried to move the <b>incendiaries</b> with a rake. He lost his arm in the subsequent explosion of the 4000 lb [...] "cookie" [...] bomb still in the aircraft's bomb bay. He was replaced by Group Captain Bussell.|$|R
5|$|In September 1992 {{the museum}} {{was the target of}} a Provisional Irish Republican Army attack against London tourist attractions.

2500|$|The main bomber force, called Plate Rack, {{took off}} {{shortly after the}} Pathfinders. This group of 254 Lancasters carried 500 tons of high {{explosives}} and 375 tons of <b>incendiaries</b> ("fire bombs"). There were 200,000 <b>incendiaries</b> in all, with the high-explosive bombs ranging in weight from 500 pounds to 4,000 pounds—the so-called two-ton cookies, also known as [...] "blockbusters," [...] because they could destroy an entire large building or street. The high explosives were intended to rupture water mains and blow off roofs, doors, and windows to create an air flow to feed the fires caused by the <b>incendiaries</b> that followed.|$|R

5|$|The next American {{raids on}} Japan were not successful. XXIBomber Command {{attacked}} Tokyo three times between 27November and 3December; {{two of these}} raids were made against the Musashino aircraft plant while the other targeted an industrial area using M-69 <b>incendiary</b> cluster bombs, specifically developed to damage Japanese urban areas. The aircraft plant attacked on 27November and 3December was only lightly damaged as high winds and clouds prevented accurate bombing. The <b>incendiary</b> raid conducted {{on the night of}} 29/30November by 29 Superfortresses burnt out one tenth of a square mile, and was also judged to be unsuccessful by the Twentieth Air Force's headquarters.|$|E
5|$|Under {{pressure}} from USAAF headquarters in Washington, LeMay changed tactics {{and decided that}} low-level <b>incendiary</b> raids against Japanese cities were {{the only way to}} destroy their production capabilities, shifting from precision bombing to area bombardment with incendiaries.|$|E
5|$|While the {{incidence}} of use dropped, towards the latter end of the Middle Ages the <b>incendiary</b> devices became more sophisticated, and the principle of wielding fire with sword remained present throughout the Early Modern and Modern periods; improving technology merely allowed the process to become more efficient.|$|E

5|$|As {{the tunnels}} were constructed, they were {{generally}} supported by wooden beams and posts. Once the mine had been finished, the internal space {{was filled with}} combustibles, such as brushwood, firewood, resin, and other <b>incendiary</b> substances; once ignited, these would burn the supporting props, causing the mine to collapse, bringing down with it the structures lying above. From the 15th century, gunpowder was also used, although the aim remained to burn the props.|$|E
5|$|In 1941, {{during the}} Second World War, the {{building}} was destroyed by an <b>incendiary</b> bomb in the London Blitz.

5|$|In 1945 the United States changed tactics from {{strategic}} {{bombing of}} military sites to indiscriminate bombing of cities, {{including the use}} of <b>incendiary</b> cluster bombs.

On 25 September the Luftwaffe flew 1,150 sorties and dropped 560 tonnes of high explosive and 72 tonnes of <b>incendiaries.</b> (Overall, <b>incendiaries</b> made up only three percent of the total tonnage dropped.) ...|$|R
50|$|On the {{afternoon}} of 12 December British monitoring stations detected X Verfahren (sometimes called X-Gerät) radio beams being laid across northern England and calculated that the likely target of the coming raid would be Sheffield.The yellow alert was received at 6.15pm followed by the purple alert at 6.45pm. The red alert was sounded at 7pm. The attack was made by three main groups of aircraft flying from airfields in northern France, including Cambrai. 13 Heinkel 111s from Kampfgruppe 100, the German Pathfinder unit arrived over the city at 7.41 p.m. and dropped 16 SC50 high-explosive bombs, 1,009 B1 E1 ZA <b>incendiaries</b> and 10,080 B1 E1 <b>incendiaries.</b> The first <b>incendiaries</b> were dropped over the suburbs of Norton Lees and Gleadless.|$|R

5|$|It was {{discovered}} later that Kehoe had cut all his wire fences {{as part of}} his preparations to destroy his farm, girdling young shade trees to kill them and cutting off his grapevine plants before putting them back on their stumps to hide the damage.

5|$|Keable's {{most famous}} {{publication}} {{was his first}} novel, Simon Called Peter, but he produced a prodigious literary output, spanning theological tracts through poetry to travel guides. Simon Called Peters sequel, Recompense, {{was made into a}} film, and his later novels all attracted substantial attention. His writings generally met with much greater popular than critical approbation, and Simon Called Peter was sufficiently <b>incendiary</b> to be banned. The book nonetheless became a contemporary best-seller.|$|E

5|$|Most of the German bombers {{had passed}} over {{and had an}} {{altitude}} advantage over French fighters trying to gain height to intercept. Skirmishes were few and far between, but some French units suffered heavy losses. For the attack, the Germans had used the new C-250 Flammbombe (Flame Bomb) which had only been cleared for use 24 hours earlier. The <b>incendiary</b> bomb did some damage to hangars and parked aircraft.|$|E
