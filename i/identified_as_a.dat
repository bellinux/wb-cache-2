5|$|Due to its unusual loop, initial reports {{suggested}} {{it was two}} separate storms that developed and hit land in rapid succession. Its track was subject to much debate at the time; eventually, it was <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> single storm.

5|$|Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback has {{not been}} <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> threat to this species, but testing has {{found it to be}} highly susceptible; in one study it {{exhibited}} the highest susceptibility of 49 Banksia species studied, with 80% of plants dead within 96days of inoculation with the disease, and 100% dead within a year.|$|E

5|$|When {{originally}} described, Patagosaurus was <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{relative of}} Cetiosaurus {{in the family}} Cetiosauridae. It can be distinguished from Cetiosaurus, a similar genus, by features of the ischium and vertebrae. Another genus also <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> cetiosaurid by Bonaparte, Volkheimeria, was named in the same paper as Patagosaurus. Features uniting the genera were identified in the pelvic structure and vertebrae, specifically the caudal neural spines and the ilium and ischium. These characteristics show that the genera are more derived than Amygdalodon, yet more primitive than Haplocanthosaurus.|$|E
5|$|A single tooth, MACN Pv-RN 248, is {{currently}} <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Ferugliotherium upper molariform. In 1992, Krause and colleagues labeled it {{as a right}} MF1, but Gurovich identifies it as a left MF1 or possibly even a right mf1. LACM 149371, an enigmatic tooth from the Paleogene of Santa Rosa, Peru, may represent an upper molar of an animal related to Ferugliotherium. Like the latter, it has cusps that are compressed {{from front to back}} and that are connected {{to the center of the}} crown by low crests.|$|E
