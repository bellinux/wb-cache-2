40|$|AbstractIn {{the last}} decade the main goals of organic {{dairying}} have been to attain acceptable levels of milk production, increase opportunities for animals to perform species own behaviour, resulting in improved animal welfare and animal health, and minimize the use of therapeutic interventions, including {{the reduction of the}} (preventive) use of antibiotics. Maintaining animal health without the use of therapeutic interventions is a major challenge for organic dairy farmers. In particular, udder health remains a major problem in both conventional and organic farming. In the QualityLowInputFood (QLIF) project udder health status and management were assessed in different production systems and European regions. These studies suggest that good udder health can be maintained in organic or low-input farming management systems. Novel strategies to control mastitis were evaluated and the potential of using internal teat sealers for the control of environment-associated pathogens was shown. Also oral application of a herd profile based single homeopathic remedy combined with homeopathic silica had a significant effect on cows with a relative low somatic cell count before drying-off. Suckling systems in calf rearing, as an integrated management approach, did not result in better udder health. None of the studies presented identified new variables affecting udder health. QLIF studies also demonstrated the importance of comparing udder health parameters in contrasting organic, low input and conventional production systems, since clear differences in antibiotic use against mastitis could be identified not only between organic and conventional systems, but also among dairy systems used in different EU-countries. Although alternative treatments used in organic systems could not be shown to be fully effective, results suggest that the use of individual or combined alternative strategies to improve udder health on organic or low-input <b>farms</b> <b>warrants</b> further investigation. Based on the results obtained it is recommended that future research should focus on identifying the reasons for variability in udder health between organic farms that use different management protocols to identify ‘best current practice’ when carrying out this research...|$|R
40|$|Aleutian mink disease (AMD) is a {{prominent}} infectious disease in mink farms. The AMD virus (AMDV) {{has been well}} characterized in Europe where American mink (Neovison vison) are an introduced species; however, in North America, where American mink are native and the disease {{is thought to have}} originated, the virus’ molecular epidemiology is unknown. As such, we characterized viral isolates from Ontario free-ranging mink of domestic, hybrid, and wild origin at two proteins: NS 1, a nonstructural protein, and VP 2, a capsid protein. AMDV DNA was detected in 25 % of free-ranging mink (45 of 183), indicating prevalent active infection. Median-joining networks showed that Ontario AMDV isolates formed two subgroups in the NS 1 region and three in the VP 2 region, which were somewhat separate from, but closely related to, AMDVs circulating in domestic mink worldwide. Molecular analyses showed evidence of AMDV crossing from domestic to wild mink. Our results suggest that AMDV isolate grouping is linked to both wild endogenous reservoirs and the long-term global trade in domestic mink, and that AMD spills back and forth between domestic and wild mink. As such, biosecurity on mink <b>farms</b> is <b>warranted</b> to prevent transmission of the disease between mink farms and the wild...|$|R
40|$|Organic farming, {{as opposed}} to {{conventional}} or traditional farming that employs the use of chemicals, is a method that was begun {{in the middle of}} the twentieth century, shortly after the end of World War II. In many ways it is a return to farming practices that were conducted for centuries until about the late 1800 ’s when pesticides and fertilizers were introduced. The rise of organic farming has been occurring all over the world to varying degrees over the past few decades. The French have always had a strong connection to agriculture, food, and the preservation of tradition, so organic farming has a notable presence throughout the country because of its association with these ideals. It is, however, still a small sector in the <b>farming</b> industry, <b>warranting</b> study of its extent. In this thesis I examine its origins, development, regulation, connection with other countries, motivations for its promotion, deterrents to its progress, and projections for its future based on other academics’ and my own analysis. I conclude that organic farming in France is certainly rising and shows definite signs of growth in the upcoming years because of consumer interest and governmental support. While it is highly doubtful at this time that organic farming could wholly replace conventional farming, it is likely to create more transparency in the farming industry and lead to the breakdown of large agricultural businesses...|$|R
40|$|The whole farm {{financial}} {{effects of}} laser land forming were analysed using a two stage modelling procedure. In the first stage, linear programming models of representative Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area (MIA) rice farms {{were used to}} predict the profit-maximising activity mixes with and without successive increments of land forming. In the second stage, the profit-maximising activity mixes with and without an increment became inputs into a spreadsheet model designed to undertake discounted cash flow analysis of investment in the increment. The transition over time of yields to the achievable levels for land formed layouts was accounted for in the spreadsheet model, as were the effects of taxation (including taxation concessions for land forming) and access to concessional credit from the Special Conservation Scheme of the New South Wales Rural Assistance Authority. The analysis suggests that land forming the full area of a typical MIA rice <b>farm</b> is <b>warranted,</b> but that priority in allocating a limited capital budget {{should be given to}} areas requiring relatively low volumes of earth to be moved. A financial analysis of 'topsoiling' (replacing topsoil on areas from which it has been 'heavy cut' during land forming) showed it to generate considerably lower rates of return than land forming. Thus it appears land forming should be given priority overtopsoiling in allocating a limited capital budget. Farm Management,...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a model of}} the farm management process. The model suggests that certain socioeconomic characteristics of farm managers will influence their decision-making process. Several characteristics are hypothesized an tested using multivariate techniques (multivariate analysis of variance, range tests, and multiple comparisons).

On the basis of the analysis it was concluded that such {{a model of the}} farm management process can contribute to an understanding of farm management decisions. In addition, it was concluded that farm managers, farm machinery dealers, and extension agents had significantly different perceptions of the importance of these factors to farm managers.

However, a new low-salinity shrimp farming system has developed {{that seems to have}} fewer disease and environmental problems than previous systems but competes with rice production for land and water resources. The present study found that shrimp farming exhibits increasing returns to scale and is much more profitable than rice farming, which offers opportunities for rice farmers to improve their incomes through diversification.

Despite an EWS being in place for a number of years, animal welfare incidents continue to occur. Questionnaires regarding welfare incidents were sent to Superintending Veterinary Inspectors (SVIs), resulting in 18 herds being chosen as case study herds, 12 of which had a clearly defined welfare incident date. For each study herd, data on six potential KPIs were extracted from DAFF databases. The KPIs for those herds with a clearly defined welfare incident date were studied for a consecutive four year window, with the fourth year being the 'incident year', when the welfare incident was disclosed. For study herds without a clearly defined welfare incident date, the KPIs were determined on a yearly basis between 2001 and 2009. Results We found that the late registration of calves, the use of on-farm burial as a method of carcase disposal, an increasing number of moves to knackeries over time and records of animals moved to 'herd unknown' were notable on the case farms.

40|$|Information is scanty on {{seasonal}} {{changes in}} the yield and quality of forage legumes adapted to the West African savannas. Two experiments were conducted from 1992 - 1994 in the derived savanna zone of West Africa to determine the dry matter (DM) yield and 48 -h in sacco DM digestibility of 17 accessions of Chamaecrista rotundifolia (Experiment 1), and 22 accessions of 8 Centrosema species (Experiment 2) in the main-wet (April-August), minor-wet (September-November), and dry (December-March) seasons. Accessions varied significantly in DM yield and in Sacco DM digestibility in both experiments. Based on the digestible DM yield, accessions were identified with the potential ot provide greater quantities of high quality forage. These included: Ch. rotundifolia ILCA 14165; Ce. acutifolium ILCA 12182 and 12184; Ce. macrocarpum ILCA 15594; Ce. pascuorum ILCA 9; Ce. schottii ILCA 122 and 12401; and Ce. plumieri ILCA 200; for the wet season. Promising accessions for the dry season included: Ch. rotundifolia ILCA 14172 and 14174; Ce. acutifolium ILCA 15591; Ce. arenarium ILCA 12451; Ce. brasilianum ILCA 155; Ce. macrocarpum ILCA 15594; Ce. plumieri ILCA 194; and Ce. schottii ILCA 122. Of the Ce. virginianum accessions evaluated, ILCA 509 was the best in all seasons. The potential of the promising accessions to reduce seasonal deficiencies of high quality feed, especially during the dry season, and their multiple use of soil fertility maintenance, weed control, and pest management in mixed <b>farming</b> systems <b>warrant</b> further research...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Social {{scientists}} {{have a long}} history of concern with the effects of industrialized farming on communities. Recently, the topic has taken on new importance as corporate farming laws in a number of states are challenged by agribusiness interests. Defense of these laws often requires evidence from social science research that industrialized farming poses risks to communities. A problem is that no recent journal articles or books systematically assess the extent to which research to date provides evidence of these risks. This article addresses the gap in the literature. We evaluate studies investigating the effects of industrialized farming on community well-being from the 1930 s to the present. Using a pool of 51 studies, we document the research designs employed, evaluate results as to whether adverse consequences were found, and delineate the aspects of community life that may be affected by industrialized farming. Of these studies, 57 % found largely detrimental impacts, 25 % were mixed, finding some detrimental impacts, and 18 % found no detrimental impacts. Adverse impacts were found across an array of indicators measuring socioeconomic conditions, community social fabric, and environmental conditions. Few positive effects of industri-alized farming were found across studies. The results demonstrate that public concern about industrialized <b>farms</b> is <b>warranted.</b> Scholars often debate whether research should be oriented around disciplines accumulated body of knowledge or, conversely, provide critical knowledge in the public interest. Social scientists long-term engagement in building the body of research on industrialized farming allows for accomplishment of bot...|$|R

40|$|Aims: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} if three classes of farm disinfectants were able to select for ciprofloxacin or cyclohexane tolerant [indicative of a multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) phenotype] Escherichia coli and if cyclohexane-tolerant E. coli could be isolated from farms. Methods and Results: Chicken slurry containing ca 1 : 99 ratio ciprofloxacin resistant : susceptible E. coli (10 different resistant strains examined) was treated for 24 h with each of the disinfectants and examined for survival of resistant : susceptible strains. Ciprofloxacin-sensitive (n = 5) and - resistant (n = 5) E. coli were grown with sublethal concentrations of the disinfectants and then plated to agar containing ciprofloxacin or overlaid with cyclohexane. Escherichia coli (n = 389) isolated from farms were tested for cyclohexane tolerance. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were determined against representative isolates and mutants. The disinfectants did not select for the ciprofloxacin-resistant E. coli in poultry slurry but following growth with each of the three disinfectants, higher numbers (Pless than or equal to 0 (.) 023) of cyclohexane-tolerant E. coli were isolated and these had a MAR phenotype. Of the 389 farm E. coli tested, only one was cyclohexane tolerant. Conclusions: It is possible that in a farm environment, E. coli could be exposed to similar concentrations of the disinfectants that are selected for MAR type organisms under these laboratory conditions. Significance and Impact of the Study: Data from this study suggest that cyclohexane-resistant E. coli are not common on farms, but in view of the ease of isolating them in the laboratory with farm disinfectants, further investigations on <b>farms</b> are <b>warranted...</b>|$|R
40|$|The multi-resistance gene cfr {{is widely}} {{distributed}} among various gram-positive and gram-negative species in livestock in China. To {{better understand the}} epidemiology of cfr among Staphylococcus spp. and E. coli isolates, 254 Staphylococcus spp. and 398 E. coli strains collected from six swine farms in China were subjected to prevalence and genetic analysis. Forty (15. 7 %) Staphylococcus spp. isolates, including 38 Staphylococcus sciuri strains, one Staphylococcus chromogenes strain, and one Staphylococcus lentus strain, and two (0. 5 %) E. coli isolates were found to contain the cfr gene. Most of the 38 S. sciuri strains were clonally unrelated; however, clonal dissemination of cfr-positive S. sciuri was detected at the same farm. In eight randomly selected cfr-positive staphylococci, a cfr-harboring module (IS 21 - 558 -cfr-ΔtnpB) was detected in six S. sciuri isolates; cfr was bracketed by two copies of ISEnfa 4 or IS 256 in the remaining two S. sciuri isolates. In the two E. coli isolates, EP 25 and EP 28, cfr was flanked by two IS 26 elements in the same or opposite orientation, respectively. Complete sequence analysis of the novel F 43 :A-:B- plasmid pHNEP 28 revealed that it contains two multi-resistance regions: cfr together with floR, qnrS 1 interspersed with IS 26, ΔISCR 2 and ISKpn 19, and blaTEM- 1 together with tet(M) interspersed with IS 26, ISApl 1, ΔTn 2, and ΔIS 1 B.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Infectious {{diseases}} {{can often}} be of conservation importance for wildlife. Spillover, when infectious disease is transmitted from a reservoir population to sympatric wildlife, is a particular threat. American mink (Neovison vison) populations across Canada appear to be declining, but factors thus far explored have not fully explained this population trend. Recent research has shown, however, that domestic mink are escaping from mink farms and hybridizing with wild mink. Domestic mink may also be spreading Aleutian disease (AD), a highly pathogenic parvovirus prevalent in mink farms, to wild mink populations. AD could reduce fitness in wild mink by reducing both the productivity of adult females and survivorship of juveniles and adults. METHODS: To assess the seroprevalence and geographic distribution of AD infection in free-ranging mink {{in relation to the}} presence of mink farms, we conducted both a large-scale serological survey, across the province of Ontario, and a smaller-scale survey, at the interface between a mink farm and wild mink. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Antibodies to AD were detected in 29 % of mink (60 of 208 mink sampled); however, seroprevalence was significantly higher in areas closer to mink farms than in areas farther from farms, at both large and small spatial scales. Our results indicate that mink farms act as sources of AD transmission to the wild. As such, it is likely that wild mink across North America may be experiencing increased exposure to AD, via disease transmission from mink farms, which may be affecting wild mink demographics across their range. In light of declining mink populations, high AD seroprevalence within some mink farms, and the large number of mink farms situated across North America, improved biosecurity measures on <b>farms</b> are <b>warranted</b> to prevent continued disease transmission at the interface between mink farms and wild mink populations...|$|R
40|$|AbstractCombinations of {{anthelmintics}} with {{a similar}} spectrum of activity and different mechanisms of action and resistance are widely available in several {{regions of the world}} for the control of sheep nematodes. There are two main justifications for the use of such combinations: (1) to enable the effective control of nematodes in the presence of single or multiple drug resistance, and (2) to slow the development of resistance to the component anthelmintic classes. Computer model simulations of sheep nematode populations indicate that the ability of combinations to slow the development of resistance is maximised if certain prerequisite criteria are met, the most important of which appear to concern the opportunity for survival of susceptible nematodes in refugia and the pre-existing levels of resistance to each of the anthelmintics in the combination. Combinations slow the development of a resistant parasite population by reducing the number of resistant genotypes which survive treatment, because multiple alleles conferring resistance to all the component anthelmintic classes must be present in the same parasite for survival. Individuals carrying multiple resistance alleles are rarer than those carrying single resistance alleles. This enhanced efficacy leads to greater dilution of resistant genotypes by the unselected parasites in refugia, thus reducing the proportion of resistant parasites available to reproduce with other resistant adults that have survived treatment. Concerns over the use of anthelmintic combinations include the potential to select for resistance to multiple anthelmintic classes concurrently if there are insufficient parasites in refugia; the potential for shared mechanisms of resistance between chemical classes; and the pre-existing frequency of resistance alleles may be too high on some <b>farms</b> to <b>warrant</b> the introduction of certain combinations. In conclusion, anthelmintic combinations can {{play an important role in}} resistance management. However, they are not a panacea and should always be used in accordance with contemporary principles for sustainable anthelmintic use...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to empirically {{investigate}} the effects of farm income variability, farm size, and other socio-demographic characteristics on the precautionary saving behavior of farm households and to estimate the influences of the identified factors on the amount of savings by self-employed farm households. Design/methodology/approach – Using 2003 Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) data and a Double-Hurdle procedure, the likelihood and the amount of savings by farm households are estimated. Findings – An important empirical finding of this study is that variability in income plays an important role in explaining precautionary savings of US farm households. Findings suggest that farm households facing higher income risk save more and accumulate more wealth. It is indicated that several farm, operator, household, and demographic attributes contribute to the precautionary savings of farm households. In particular, results show that educational attainment by operator and spouses have positive impact on the decision to save. In addition, results from this study show that farms that specialize in cash grain are likely to have precautionary savings. Practical implications – Farm households today are virtually indistinguishable from non-farm households in their levels of income and diversity of employment. As a result, government policies that influence general economic conditions have much more profound impacts on farm families. Federal support of <b>farm</b> income <b>warrants</b> continued scrutiny. This paper shows that greater income uncertainty increases savings and wealth of farm households. Therefore, farm policies that reduce income variability or uncertainty will have an impact on precautionary savings and wealth of farm households. Originality/value – Several studies have investigated savings of households; however, these studies are limited to entire US population, older Americans, or non-self-employed individuals in the USA. Little is known about the savings behavior of self-employed US farm households owing to a lack of household survey data and because of the complex relationship between the farm household and farm business in terms of resource allocation (both capital and labor).

40|$|A major {{challenge}} {{in the field of}} transplantation is to prevent graft rejection and prolong graft survival. Tolerance induction is a promising way to achieve long-term graft survival without the need for potent immunosuppression and its associated side effects. The recent success of co-stimulatory blockade by the chimeric protein CTLA 4 Ig in the modulation of the recipient's immune system and the prolongation of graft survival in animal models suggests a possible application of CTLA 4 Ig in clinical transplantation. To produce sufficient amounts of CTLA 4 Ig for future clinical application, we sought to use the mammary gland as a bioreactor and produce CTLA 4 Ig in the milk of transgenic farm animals. Prior to the generation of transgenic farm animals, we tested our strategy in mice. Using the promoter of the sheep β-lactoglobulin gene, we expressed our CTLA 4 Ig chimeric gene in the mammary gland of transgenic mice. The yield of CTLA 4 Ig was fivefold higher in transgenic milk than that from transfected cells. Purified milk-derived CTLA 4 Ig is biologically active and suppresses T cell activation. We showed that the production of CTLA 4 Ig in the milk has no adverse immunosuppression effect on the transgenic animals and the offsprings that were fed with the transgenic milk. The findings suggest that the approach to produce CTLA 4 Ig in milk by transgenesis is feasible; further studies involving <b>farm</b> animals are <b>warranted.</b> © 2003 Elsevier Science B. V.
