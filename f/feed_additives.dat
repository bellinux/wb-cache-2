5|$|Even a {{slightly}} dehydrated horse is {{at higher risk}} of developing impaction colic. Additionally, dehydration can lead to weight loss because the horse cannot produce adequate amounts of saliva, thus decreasing the amount of feed and dry forage consumed. Thus, {{it is especially important}} for horse owners to encourage their horses to drink when there is a risk of dehydration; when horses are losing a great deal of water in hot weather due to strenuous work, or in cold weather due to horses' natural tendency to drink less when in a cold environment. To encourage drinking, owners may add electrolytes to the <b>feed,</b> <b>additives</b> to make the water especially palatable (such as apple juice), or, when it is cold, to warm the water so that it is not at a near-freezing temperature.|$|E

40|$|Campylobacter jejuni is an {{important}} zoonotic foodborne pathogen causing acute gastroenteritis in humans. Chickens are often colonized at very high numbers by C. jejuni, up to 10 (9) CFU per gram of caecal content, with no detrimental effects on their health. Farm control strategies are being developed to lower the C. jejuni contamination of chicken food products {{in an effort to}} reduce human campylobacteriosis incidence. It is believed that intestinal microbiome composition may affect gut colonization by such undesirable bacteria but, although the chicken microbiome is being increasingly characterized, information is lacking on the factors affecting its modulation, especially by foodborne pathogens. This study monitored the effects of C. jejuni chicken caecal colonization on the chicken microbiome in healthy chickens. It also evaluated the capacity of a <b>feed</b> <b>additive</b> to affect caecal bacterial populations and to lower C. jejuni colonization. From day- 0, chickens received or not a microencapsulated <b>feed</b> <b>additive</b> and were inoculated or not with C. jejuni at 14 days of age. Fresh caecal content was harvested at 35 days of age. The caecal microbiome was characterized by real time quantitative PCR and Ion Torrent sequencing.

A total of 400 male broiler chicks (Ross- 308) were randomly allocated to treatments varying in supplemental DSOP. The dietary groups consisted of five diets fed for 42 days: control diet without <b>feed</b> <b>additive,</b> diet containing 1. 5 % <b>feed</b> <b>additive</b> only in starter phase, diet containing 1. 5 % <b>feed</b> <b>additive</b> during whole period (starter + grower), diet containing 3 % <b>feed</b> <b>additive</b> only in starter phase, diet containing 3 % <b>feed</b> <b>additive</b> during whole period.
