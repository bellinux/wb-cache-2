5|$|Chaplin {{never spoke}} more than cursorily about his filmmaking methods, {{claiming}} {{such a thing}} would be tantamount to a magician spoiling his own illusion. Little was known about <b>his</b> <b>working</b> process throughout his lifetime, but research from film historians – particularly the findings of Kevin Brownlow and David Gill that were presented in the three-part documentary Unknown Chaplin (1983) – has since revealed his unique working method.|$|E

One of his last visits was to the Wolverhampton and Walsall Railway, only a few miles from his first railway contract at Penkridge. In the late summer of 1870 he took to his bed at his home in St Leonards-on-Sea.

5|$|Kaspersky's prior {{work for}} the Russian {{military}} and his education at a KGB-sponsored technical college has led to controversy about whether he uses his position to advance Russian government interests and intelligence efforts.

He spends much of <b>his</b> <b>working</b> life trying to get governments and organizations to trust him and his software in spite of the allegations.|$|E
5|$|Rather than {{providing}} a straightforward biography, the film weaves fantasy sequences with scenes containing somewhat fictionalized accounts {{of events in}} Darin's life, and throughout it, the adult singer interacts with his younger self. It chronicles his determination to rise from <b>his</b> <b>working</b> class roots as Walden Robert Cassotto, a frail Bronx boy plagued by multiple bouts of rheumatic fever, and become a singer more famous than Frank Sinatra. To achieve that goal, he forms a band and struggles to find gigs at any nightclub that will hire him.|$|E
5|$|The Review Board still {{considered}} Parsons a liability {{because of his}} historical Marxist affiliations and investigations by the FBI, and in January 1952 they permanently reinstated their ban on <b>his</b> <b>working</b> for classified projects, effectively prohibiting him from working in rocketry. To make a living he founded the Parsons Chemical Manufacturing Company, which was based in North Hollywood and created pyrotechnics and explosives such as fog effects and imitation gunshot wounds for the film industry, and he also returned to chemical manufacturing at the Bermite Powder Company in Saugus.|$|E

5|$|After {{returning}} from South Africa, Harvey embarrassed the Board of Control when he frankly discussed his financial situation during a television interview. He {{revealed that the}} players earned only £85 per Test {{and that he was}} almost broke, despite being an automatic selection for Australia. Ten years of making time for cricket had disrupted <b>his</b> <b>working</b> life, so he was contemplating a move to South Africa, the homeland of his wife, Iris. Consequently, Harvey received a job offer to work as a sales supervisor for a glass manufacturer in Sydney, so he moved to New South Wales and gave up the Victorian captaincy. As a new player to NSW, he was behind vice-captain Richie Benaud in the state's pecking order, despite being the Test vice-captain, ahead of Benaud. Fatefully, Craig was unfit {{for the start of the}} 1958–59 season, due to the after-effects of hepatitis.|$|E
5|$|Blamey began <b>his</b> <b>working</b> life in 1899 as a trainee {{school teacher}} at Lake Albert School. He {{transferred}} to South Wagga Public School in 1901, and in 1903 moved to Western Australia, where he taught {{for three years}} at Fremantle Boys School. He coached the rifle shooting team of its cadet unit there to a win in the Western Australian Cup. He {{was raised in the}} Methodist faith and remained involved with his church. By early 1906 he was a lay preacher, and church leaders in Western Australia offered him an appointment as an associate minister in Carnarvon, Western Australia.|$|E
5|$|Born on 24 March 1895 at Leongatha, Victoria, Mackinolty {{was the son}} of {{labourer}} James Mickleburg Mackinolty and {{his wife}} Mary. He went to public schools, obtaining his merit certificate before undertaking formal engineering and business courses in Melbourne. Commencing <b>his</b> <b>working</b> life as a coach and motor-body builder, he enlisted in the Australian Military Forces on 17August 1914, soon after the outbreak of World WarI. His experience in the motor industry led to assignment as an air mechanic with the Aviation Instructional Staff at Central Flying School (CFS), Point Cook. He was soon promoted from private to corporal and later, having gained a reputation for his skill with timber, raised to sergeant and given command of the school's woodworking team.|$|E

5|$|In his writing, Su Song credited, as the {{predecessor}} of <b>his</b> <b>working</b> clock, the hydraulic-powered armillary sphere of Zhang Heng (78–139 AD), an earlier Chinese scientist. Su Song was also {{strongly influenced by}} the earlier armillary sphere created by Zhang Sixun (976 AD), who also employed the escapement mechanism and used liquid mercury instead {{of water in the}} waterwheel of his astronomical clock tower (since liquid mercury would not freeze during winter and would not corrode and rust metal components over time). However, Su Song stated in his writing that after Zhang's death, no one was able to replicate his device, much like his own.|$|E
5|$|Morrell left Arsenal {{during the}} First World War and James McEwen served as {{caretaker}} manager, presiding over two matches. Both managers' work over 1914–15 resulted in Arsenal finishing in fifth place and aided the club's re-election to the First Division. When professional football resumed in 1919, Norris appointed Leslie Knighton as the club's manager. Arsenal remained under financial strain {{during this period}} and stagnated in the league; Kingston in his autobiography claimed he was under strict instruction to spend little on transfers. <b>His</b> <b>working</b> relationship with Norris moreover deteriorated and in 1925 he was dismissed. The decision to sack Knighton {{was said to have}} been made following Arsenal's defeat to West Ham United in the FA Cup, a competition which presented the club's only realistic chance of silverware.|$|E
5|$|Ponsford began <b>his</b> <b>working</b> {{life at the}} State Savings Bank. On {{his return}} from England in 1926, the bank advised him {{that they might not}} {{tolerate}} so much leave for cricket in the future. Ponsford received a lucrative offer to play for Blackpool Cricket Club, which he was inclined to accept. This news was received with dismay by Australian fans, who had earlier seen players such as Ted McDonald leave Australia and accept contracts in the professional English leagues. To keep Ponsford in Melbourne, The Herald—a local newspaper—employed him on the basis that he would remain available for all representative cricket. The new role included writing articles for the paper.|$|E
