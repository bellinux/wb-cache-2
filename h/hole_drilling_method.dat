To solve these problems, Wire and Arc Additive Manufacturing (WAAM) process is used, which has a much higher deposition rate than most other metal additive manufacture processes. Integrated deposition and machining is a novel AM technique which combines deposition and milling in one process; the milling step on the top surface does not only ensure the fixed height increment of each layer, but also increases the surface quality of the deposited multi-layered structure. In addition, the internal and external surface profile can be machined to remove any remaining surface roughness to attain the desired high quality surface of a near-net shape metal part. In this project, the research aims at integrating WAAM technology with subtractive technology using basic wall shaped part structures in the analysis for finding the relationship between milling amount, surface waviness and part fatigue life.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The <b>hole</b> <b>drilling</b> <b>method</b> {{has been}} used for {{measurement}} of the residual stresses in various materials. The released strains measured by the <b>hole</b> <b>drilling</b> <b>method</b> are converted to residual stresses using calibration factors. There is a standard for the <b>hole</b> <b>drilling</b> <b>method</b> for isotropic materials. Also for orthotropic materials, there are various methods for converting the released strains to residual stresses. In these methods the numbers of calibration factors vary from two to nine (a three by three matrix). In this article, calibration factors of the orthotropic plates are determined based on an exact solution method. For this purpose, assuming a plane stress condition, stresses and strains around the area under a rosette strain gage mounted to an orthotropic plate are calculated. A hole {{in the center of the}} rosette strain gage changes the distribution of the stresses and strains. Using the closed form solution proposed in this research the released strains and the calibration factors are calculated, and the residual stresses are found. Also, calibration factors for any orthotropic material with any level of orthotropy are calculated. These factors are independent of the loading and depend on the material properties of orthotropic materials and the ratio of the rosette diameter to the hole diameter. The material properties and the ratio of the rosette diameter to the hole diameter are considered in the equations, therefore there is no need for presenting the results in tabular form or any interpolations. The results for an orthotropic unidirectional ply made of carbon/epoxy are presented. Also, the calibration factors for three different unidirectional composites are calculated. The results obtained from the proposed closed form solution are compared with the simulated <b>hole</b> <b>drilling</b> <b>method.</b> A good agreement between the results shows the reliability of the closed form solution presented in this study...|$|E

In {{order to}} develop {{surfaces}} that have the proper curvature for aerospace structures, it is sometimes necessary to use shot peen forming, also known as contour forming, to create the desired shape {{in a piece of}} metal. Since the preferred metal in aerospace continues to be aluminum and its alloys, this study will concentrate on the effects of shot peening on aluminum. Typically, shot intensity is measured using standard Almen strips made from cold rolled SAE 1070 spring steel. Since the effects of the shot on aluminum is the chief concern of this study, aluminum strips of the same size and thickness will be used to determine the intensity of the shot on aluminum parts. These strips will be exposed for different amounts of time to different intensities, measured using the steel Almen strips, and then the intensity (or arc height) will be measured on the aluminum strips. The residual stresses in these strips will then be measured using the <b>hole</b> <b>drill</b> <b>method</b> (ASTM E 837). The stresses from the residual stress test will then be used to develop a finite element model that simulates the aluminum strips and the deformation in them. The model will then be calibrated with the empirical data.

This will enable more efficient contour forming processes with less rework. Furthermore, the trial and error of a manual process can be avoided with the use of robotics.

SaIne automobile manufachlrers have recently introduced specifications concerning the depth of residual stress in gears. Most of the research done on this topic has made use of the X-ray diffraction method to de-termine residual stress.

For this reason, the authors have used the Barkhausen noise lnethod to measure residual stress and have then compared results before and after peening.
