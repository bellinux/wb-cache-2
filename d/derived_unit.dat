5|$|The derived {{units in}} the SI are formed by powers, {{products}} or quotients of the base units and are unlimited in number. Derived units are associated with derived quantities, for example velocity is a quantity that {{is derived from the}} base quantities of time and length, so in SI the <b>derived</b> <b>unit</b> is metres per second (symbol m/s). The dimensions of derived units can be expressed in terms of the dimensions of the base units.|$|E

50|$|The SI {{includes}} {{two classes of}} units which are defined and agreed internationally. The first of these classes includes the seven SI base units for length, mass, time, temperature, electric current, luminous intensity and amount of substance. The second class consists of the SI <b>derived</b> <b>units.</b> These <b>derived</b> <b>units</b> are {{defined in terms of}} the seven base units. All other quantities (e.g. work, force, power) are expressed in terms of SI <b>derived</b> <b>units.</b>|$|R
50|$|The International System of Units {{consists}} {{of a set of}} base units, a set of <b>derived</b> <b>units</b> with special names, and a set of decimal-based multipliers that are used as prefixes. The term SI Units covers all three categories, but the term coherent SI units includes only base <b>units</b> and coherent <b>derived</b> <b>units.</b>|$|R
25|$|The SI <b>derived</b> <b>unit</b> of energy, the joule, {{is named}} after James Joule. He worked with Lord Kelvin to develop the {{absolute}} scale of temperature, which {{came to be called}} the Kelvin scale. Joule also made observations of magnetostriction, and he found the relationship between the current through a resistor and the heat dissipated, which is also called Joule's first law.|$|E
500|$|During the 19th century, the {{standard}} system of metric units was the centimetre–gram–second system of units, treating the gram as the fundamental {{unit of mass}} and the kilogram simply as a <b>derived</b> <b>unit.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The SI <b>derived</b> <b>unit</b> of {{electric}} potential is the volt (in honor of Alessandro Volta), {{which is why}} a difference in electric potential between two points is known as voltage.

50|$|There are {{two types}} of SI units, base <b>units</b> and <b>derived</b> <b>units.</b> Base units are the simple {{measurements}} for time, length, mass, temperature, amount of substance, electric current and light intensity. <b>Derived</b> <b>units</b> are constructed from the base units, for example, the watt, i.e. the unit for power, is defined from the base units as m2·kg·s−3. Other physical properties may be measured in compound units, such as material density, measured in kg/m3.|$|R

2500|$|Derived units {{which are}} formed by {{operating}} on base units or combinations of base units and other derived units. For example, a C# tuning fork vibrates 261.6 times per second and therefore has a frequency of 261.6 {{cycles per second}} or 261.6 hertz. In this instance [...] "hertz" [...] is a <b>derived</b> <b>unit</b> as it is automatically defined from {{the definition of the}} second. Other derived units might be built up from one or more base units.|$|E
2500|$|Electric {{charge is}} the {{physical}} property of matter that causes it {{to experience a}} force when placed in an electromagnetic field. There {{are two types of}} electric charges: positive and negative (commonly carried by protons and electrons respectively). Like charges repel and unlike attract. An absence of net charge is referred to as [...] An object is negatively charged if it has an excess of electrons, and is otherwise positively charged or uncharged. The SI <b>derived</b> <b>unit</b> of electric charge is the coulomb (C). In electrical engineering, it is also common to use the ampere-hour (Ah), and, in chemistry, it is common to use the elementary charge (e) as a unit. The symbol Q often denotes charge. Early knowledge of how charged substances interact is now called classical electrodynamics, and is still accurate for problems that don't require consideration of quantum effects.|$|E

2500|$|Radian (n= 2= 6.283...): The radian is {{the angle}} {{subtended}} by an arc {{of a circle}} that has the same length as the circle's radius. The case of radian for the formula given earlier, a radian of n = 2 units is obtained by setting k = [...] = 1. One turn is 2 radians, and one radian is [...] degrees, or about 57.2958 degrees. The radian is abbreviated rad, though this symbol is often omitted in mathematical texts, where radians are assumed unless specified otherwise. When radians are used angles are considered as dimensionless. The radian is used in virtually all mathematical work beyond simple practical geometry, due, for example, to the pleasing and [...] "natural" [...] properties that the trigonometric functions display when their arguments are in radians. The radian is the (<b>derived)</b> <b>unit</b> of angular measurement in the SI system.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{systems for}} the {{measurement}} of dynamic quantities that used imperial and US customary units are the British Gravitational System (BG) proposed by Arthur Mason Worthington and the English Engineering System (EE). Both systems depend on the gravitational acceleration, and use the pound-force as the unit of force but use different approaches when applying Newton's laws of motion. In the BG system, force, rather than mass is a base unit while the slug is a <b>derived</b> <b>unit</b> of inertia (rather than mass). On the other hand, the EE system uses a non-coherent approach and introduce the acceleration due to gravity (g) into its equations. [...] Both these approaches led to slight variations in {{the meaning of the}} pound-force (and also of the kilogram force) {{in different parts of the}} world. [...] Various countries published standard values that should be used for g and in 1901 the CGPM published a standard value for g that should be used in the [...] "International Service of Weights and Measures", namely 9.80665m/s2 (32.174ft/s2) which is equal to the value of g at 45° latitude.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the metric}} system {{has changed and}} {{developed}} since its inception, its basic concepts have hardly changed. Designed for transnational use, it consisted of a basic set of units of measurement, now known as base <b>units.</b> <b>Derived</b> <b>units</b> were built up from the base units using logical rather than empirical relationships while multiples and submultiples of both base and <b>derived</b> <b>units</b> were decimal-based and identified by a standard set of prefixes.|$|R
