40|$|Pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola, a gram-negative {{bacterial}} plant pathogen, is {{the causal}} agent <b>of</b> <b>halo</b> <b>blight</b> <b>of</b> <b>bean.</b> In this study, {{we report on}} the genome sequence of P. syringae pv. phaseolicola isolate 1448 A, which encodes 5, 353 open reading frames (ORFs) on one circular chromosome (5, 928, 787 bp) and two plasmids (131, 950 bp and 51, 711 bp). Comparative analyses with a phylogenetically divergent pathovar, P. syringae pv. tomato DC 3000, revealed a strong degree of conservation at the gene and genome levels. In total, 4, 133 ORFs were identified as putative orthologs in these two pathovars using a reciprocal best-hit method, with 3, 941 ORFs present in conserved, syntenic blocks. Although these two pathovars are highly similar at the physiological level, they have distinct host ranges; 1448 A causes disease in beans, and DC 3000 is pathogenic on tomato and Arabidopsis. Examination of the complement of ORFs encoding virulence, fitness, and survival factors revealed a substantial, but not complete, overlap between these two pathovars. Another distinguishing feature between the two pathovars is their distinctive sets of transposable elements. With access to a fifth complete pseudomonad genome sequence, we were able to identify 3, 567 ORFs that likely comprise the core Pseudomonas genome and 365 ORFs that are P. syringae specific...|$|R

In P. syringae pv. syringae B 728 a, {{a causal}} agent of {{bacterial}} brown spot disese <b>of</b> <b>bean,</b> the lemA gene {{is required for}} lesion formation on leaves and pods. Using lemA-containing DNA as a probe, we determined that 80 P. syringae pv. syringae strains isolated from bean leaves could be grouped into seven classes based on {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}}. Marker exchange mutagenesis showed that the lemA gene was required for lesion formation by representative strains from each restriction fragment length polymorphism class. Hybridization to the lemA locus was detected within six different P. syringae pathovars and within Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Interestingly, a lemA homolog was present and functional within the nonpathogenic strain P. syringae Cit 7. We cloned a lemA homolog from a genomic library of P. syringae pv. phaseolicola NPS 3121, a causal agent <b>of</b> <b>halo</b> <b>blight</b> <b>of</b> <b>bean,</b> that restored lesion formation to a P. syringae pv. syringae lemA mutant.

Eight stable clones were isolated from a genomic cosmid library by en masse mating to 10 ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) -induced Tox- mutants. In cross-matings, each suppressed all 10 mutants as well as an additional 70 EMS-induced Tox- mutants (and one UV-induced Tox- mutant). On the basis of restriction endonuclease analysis and hybridization studies, the clones were grouped into three classes. Clones in a particular class shared common fragments, whereas clones in different classes did not. Clones from class I (but not classes H and III) also suppressed TnS-induced Tox- mutants. Interposon mutagenesis and marker exchange of a representative clone from class III into the wild-type genome did not alter its Tox+ phenotype, indicating that this clone does not harbor structural or regulatory genes involved in phaseolotoxin production. We suggest that the genome of P. syringae pv. phaseolicola contains a "hot spot " in one of the functions involved in toxin production which is affected by EMS and UV and that heterologous clones are able to suppress the Tox- phenotype because their inserts encode products that are able to substitute for the product of the mutated gene. Alternatively, the inserts may contain sequences which titrate a repressor protein. In either case, the data suggest that suppression of EMS- and UV-induced mutants occurs when heterologous clones ar...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability of}} Pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola to cause <b>halo</b> <b>blight</b> <b>of</b> <b>bean</b> is {{dependent}} {{on its ability to}} translocate effector proteins into host cells via the hypersensitive response and pathogenicity (Hrp) type III secretion system (T 3 SS). To identify genes encoding type III effectors and other potential virulence factors that are regulated by the HrpL alternative sigma factor, we used a hidden Markov model, weight matrix model, and type III targeting-associated patterns to search the genome of P. syringae pv. phaseolicola 1448 A, which recently was sequenced to completion. We identified 44 high-probability putative Hrp promoters upstream of genes encoding the core T 3 SS machinery, 27 candidate effectors and related T 3 SS substrates, and 10 factors unrelated to the Hrp system. The expression of 13 of these candidate HrpL regulon genes was analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction, and all were found to be upregulated by HrpL. Six of the candidate type III effectors were assayed for T 3 SSdependent translocation into plant cells using the Bordetella pertussis calmodulin-dependent adenylate cyclase (Cya) translocation reporter, and all were translocated. PSPPH 1855 (ApbE-family protein) and PSPPH 3759 (alcohol dehydrogenase) have no apparent T 3 SS-related function; however, they do have homologs in the model strain P. syringae pv. tomato DC 3000 (PSPTO 2105 and PSPTO 0834, respectively) that are similarly upregulated by HrpL. Mutations were constructed in the DC 3000 homologs and found to reduce bacterial growth in host Arabidopsis leaves. These results establish the utility of the bioinformatic or candidate gene approach to identifying effectors and other genes relevant to pathogenesis in P. syringae genomes...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 19961 S 801 is a {{transposable element}} {{isolated}} from Pseudomonas syringae pathovar (pv.) phaseolicola, the causal agent <b>of</b> <b>halo</b> <b>blight</b> <b>of</b> <b>bean.</b> Fragments <b>of</b> the element {{are present in}} multiple copies on an indigenous plasmid, pMMC 7105, of strain LR 781, and have been implicated as sites of homologous recombination leading to imprecise excision of the chromosomally integrated form of the plasmid. The element, which has been completely sequenced, is 1512 base pairs in length and is unusual among transposable elements in {{that it does not}} have direct or inverted repeats in its termini. The terminal regions of the element were uncoupled from the two major open reading frames, and trans-acting activity of the putative transposase was demonstrated in Escherichia coli (recA). An alignment of the sequences of thirteen insertions defined the precise borders of the element, and demonstrated that it does not duplicate its targets upon insertion. The target specificity of IS 801 is similar to, but more degenerate than, the target specificity of two transposable elements to which it is closely related, IS 91 and IS 1294. The consensus derived from the aligned target sequences is G/C-A/G-A-C/G, and the target tetramer is found immediately adjacent to the right terminus of the element upon transposition. IS 91 was demonstrated to mobilize 1 S 801, but not with the specificity characteristic of 1 S 801. The structure of 1 S 801 and the characteristics of IS 91 -activated transposition of 1 S 801 are discussed in light of a proposed model for IS 91 transposition, and it is suggested that 1 S 801 could have been derived from IS 91 by a modification of its left end. Remnants of IS 801 are present near avirulence genes of various P. syringae pathovars, suggesting that the element has been involved in genetic rearrangements in the vicinity of these loci...|$|R

The mutant strains were obtained by Tn 5 mutagenesis of Pseudomonas svringae pv. phaseolicola strain PP 7010 and P. svringae pv. svringae strain PS 9020, organisms which respectively cause <b>halo</b> <b>blight</b> <b>of</b> <b>bean</b> and bacterial brown spot <b>of</b> <b>bean.</b> Through cloning <b>of</b> Tn 5 -containing genomic DNA, bacterial conjugation, auxanography, and genetic marker exchange experiments, these studies demonstrated that the Tn 5 mutation in strain PP 7014 of P. svringae pv [...] phaseolicola had created an auxotrophic requirement for uracil and had caused an inability to produce typical necrotic and chlorotic disease symptoms in bean leaves. A simple and reproducible bioassay was developed to monitor bacterial growth in leaf tissue. Using this bioassay, mutant PP 7014 was shown to be incapable of growth in planta, presumably due to its inability to obtain uracil for growth in the leaf. However, a similar Tn 5 arginine auxotroph, PP 7510, was capable <b>of</b> multiplication in <b>bean</b> leaves, demonstrating that prototrophy of P. svringae pv. phaseolicola is not a prerequisite for pathogenicity. Growth studies with pathogenic wild type P. syringae pv. syringae strains J 900 and PS 9020 revealed a correlation between growth in planta and the severity of symptom expression. Altered growth patterns and symptom expression were shown for two nonpathogenic strains derived by Tn 5. mutagenesis of PS 9020. Mutant strain PS 9021 was incapable of in planta growth and disease symptom expression. Mutant strain PS 9024, although initially capable of rapid multiplication in bean leaves, was unable to maintain the high population levels and produce the characteristic symptoms of the parental wild type strain. Further growth studies were conducted to investigate the complementation of the Tn 5 mutation in PS 9021 by cosmids containing wild type PS 9020 DNA homologous to the mutated region. Although stable throughout multiple rounds of bacterial replication, the cosmids could partially, but not completely, restore the wild type in planta growth and symptom expression pattern to PS 9021...|$|R

Two genes had been previously identified in our laboratory within this cluster: argK, which {{is involved in the}} immunity of the bacterium to its own toxin, and amtA, which is involved in the synthesis of homoarginine. We sequenced the region around argK and amtA in P. syringae pv. phaseolicola NPS 3121 to determine the limits of the putative phaseolotoxin gene cluster and to determine the transcriptional pattern of the genes comprising it. We report that the phaseolotoxin cluster (Pht cluster) is composed of 23 genes and is flanked by insertion sequences and transposases. The mutation of 14 of the genes within the cluster lead to a Tox− phenotype for 11 of them, while three mutants exhibited low levels of toxin production. The analysis of fusions of selected DNA fragments to uidA, Northern probing, and reverse transcription-PCR indicate the presence of five transcriptional units, two monocistronic and three polycistronic; one is internal to a larger operon. The site for transcription initiation has been determined for each promoter, and the putative promoter regions were identified.

In this review, we discuss several of the areas of study that chart the rise of P. syringae pv. phaseolicola from a common pathogen <b>of</b> <b>bean</b> plants to a molecular plant-pathogen supermodel bacterium. Taxonomy: Bacteria; Proteobacteria, gamma subdivision; order Pseudomonadales; family Pseudomonadaceae; genus Pseudomonas; species Pseudomonas syringae; Genomospecies 2; pathogenic variety phaseolicola. Microbiological properties: Gram-negative, aerobic, motile, rod-shaped, 1. 5  µm long, 0. 7 - 1. 2  µm in diameter, at least one polar flagellum, optimal temperatures for growth of 25 - 30 °C, oxidase negative, arginine dihydrolase negative, levan positive and elicits the hypersensitive response on tobacco. Host range: Major bacterial disease <b>of</b> common <b>bean</b> (Phaseolus vulgaris) in temperate regions and above medium altitudes in the tropics. Natural infections have been recorded on several other legume species, including all members of the tribe Phaseoleae with the exception of Desmodium spp. and Pisum sativum. Disease symptoms: Water-soaked lesions on leaves, pods, stems or petioles, that quickly develop greenish-yellow haloes on leaves at temperatures of less than 23 °C. Infected seeds may be symptomless, or have wrinkled or buttery-yellow patches on the seed coat. Seedling infection is recognized by general chlorosis, stunting and distortion of growth. Epidemiology: Seed borne and disseminated from exudation by water-splash and wind occurring during rainfall. Bacteria invade through wounds and natural openings (notably stomata). Weedy and cultivated alternative hosts may also harbour the bacterium. Disease control: Some measure of control is achieved with copper formulations and streptomycin. Pathogen-free seed and resistant cultivars are recommended.

Under favourable conditions, these lesions gradually expanded and heavily infected leaves became blighted. The primary symptoms on infected pods were the development of water soaked spots which later turned to dark or reddish blotches. In attempts to investigate the causal agent, two types of a Gram negative bacteria with raised, yellow and translucent colonies were isolated from leaves and pods <b>of</b> <b>blighted</b> <b>beans.</b> All strains produced Xanthomonadin pigment and their inoculation on young bean plants induced disease symptoms similar to those observed under field conditions. Based on morphological, physiological and biochemical properties, the predominant pathogenic type was identified as Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. phaseoli. However, the other strain with the same properties, but capable of producing melanin pigment in nutrient media, was assigned to X. axonopodis pv. phaseoli var. fuscans...|$|R
40|$|The {{tepary bean}} (Phaseolus acutifolius A. Gray) is of {{interest}} for its intrinsic value as an under-exploited crop adapted to hot arid climates, and as a potential donor of desirable traits to the common bean P. vulgaris L.) through interspecific hybridiza-tion. Teparies possess several traits that could be valuable if transferred to common beans. Teparies are more heat and drought resistant than common beans. They tolerate higher salt (Marcarian, 1981) and boron concentrations in the soil (C. J. Lovatt, personal communication; J. G. Waines, unpubl.). They are tolerant of damage by lesser cornstalk borer, Elasmo-palpus lignosellus Zeller (Thomas, 1983). They show field res-istance to charcoal rot, caused by Macrophomina phaseolina (Tassi) Goid (Thomas, 1983). All of these factors combine to produce a plant that performs well in hot, semiarid climates. In addition, they show high levels of resistance to Xanthomonas phaseoli (E. E Sm.) Dows, the bacterium that causes common <b>blight</b> <b>of</b> <b>beans</b> (Coyne and Schuster, 1973). Teparies are routinely grown during the summer {{in parts of the}} American Southwest and adjacent Mexico, where they set pods when temperatures are too high for pod formation in common beans. They are able to mature seed under conditions so dry that common beans die or yield poorly because of drought (Freeman, 1912; Nabhan and Felger, 1978). Our ow...|$|R
40|$|Understanding the survival, multiplication, and {{transmission}} to seeds of plant pathogenic bacteria {{is central to}} study their pathogenesis. We hypothesized that the type III secretion system (T 3 SS), encoded by hrp genes, could {{have a role in}} host colonization by plant pathogenic bacteria. The seed-borne pathogen Xanthomonas fuscans subsp. fuscans causes common bacterial <b>blight</b> <b>of</b> <b>bean</b> (Phaseolus vulgaris). Directed mutagenesis in strain CFBP 4834 -R of X. fuscans subsp. fuscans and bacterial population density monitoring on bean leaves showed that strains with mutations in the hrp regulatory genes, hrpG and hrpX, were impaired in their phyllospheric growth, as in the null interaction with Escherichia coli C 600 and bean. In the compatible interaction, CFBP 4834 -R reached high phyllospheric population densities and was transmitted to seeds at high frequencies with high densities. Strains with mutations in structural hrp genes maintained the same constant epiphytic population densities (1 × 105 CFU g− 1 of fresh weight) as in the incompatible interaction with Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris ATCC 33913 and the <b>bean.</b> Low frequencies <b>of</b> transmission to seeds and low bacterial concentrations were recorded for CFBP 4834 -R hrp mutants and for ATCC 33913, whereas E. coli C 600 was not transmitted. Moreover, unlike the wild-type strain, strains with mutations in hrp genes were not transmitted to seeds by vascular pathway. Transmission to seeds by floral structures remained possible for both. This study revealed the involvement of the X. fuscans subsp. fuscans T 3 SS in phyllospheric multiplication and systemic colonization <b>of</b> <b>bean,</b> leading to transmission to seeds. Our findings suggest a major contribution of hrp regulatory genes in host colonization processes...|$|R

40|$|The common {{bacterial}} <b>blight</b> <b>of</b> common <b>beans</b> (CBCF), {{a disease}} caused by Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. phaseoli (Xap) and Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. phaseoli var. fuscans (Xapf), significantly reduces grain yield and seed quality. Because this bacterium is mainly disseminated through infected seeds, efficient detection of Xap and Xapf {{is important to}} assure the productivity {{and quality of the}} crop. In this study, various techniques that included different extraction techniques (two different incubation times, with and without centrifugation) and five culture media (Kado 523, GYCA, MXP, NSA, and PTSA) were tested for the detection of the seed-borne inoculum, using three different seed samples. Overnight incubation of the seeds, followed by centrifugation and incubation in Kado 523 resulted in higher extraction of Xap and Xapf. The best extraction technique was overnight incubation followed by centrifugation, and the best medium was PTSA. Among the tested culture media, PTSA provided better identification and counting of the bacterial colonies, thus allowing the quantification of the seed infection levels...|$|R
40|$|Background: Common {{bacterial}} blight is {{a devastating}} bacterial disease <b>of</b> common <b>bean</b> (Phaseolus vulgaris) caused by Xanthomonas citri pv. fuscans and Xanthomonas phaseoli pv. phaseoli. These phylogenetically distant strains {{are able to}} cause similar symptoms on common bean, suggesting that they have acquired common genetic determinants of adaptation to common bean. Transcription Activator-Like (TAL) effectors are bacterial type III effectors {{that are able to}} induce the expression of host genes to promote infection or resistance. Their capacity to bind to a specific host DNA sequence suggests that they are potential candidates for host adaption. Results: To study the diversity of tal genes from Xanthomonas strains responsible for common bacterial <b>blight</b> <b>of</b> <b>bean,</b> whole genome sequences of 17 strains representing the diversity of X. citri pv. fuscans and X. phaseoli pv. phaseoli were obtained by single molecule real time sequencing. Analysis of these genomes revealed the existence of four tal genes named tal 23 A, tal 20 F, tal 18 G and tal 18 H, respectively. While tal 20 F and tal 18 G were chromosomic, tal 23 A and tal 18 H were carried on plasmids and shared between phylogenetically distant strains, therefore suggesting recent horizontal transfers of these genes between X. citri pv. fuscans and X. phaseoli pv. phaseoli strains. Strikingly, tal 23 A was present in all strains studied, suggesting that it {{played an important role in}} adaptation to common bean. In silico predictions of TAL effectors targets in the common bean genome suggested that TAL effectors shared by X. citri pv. fuscans and X. phaseoli pv. phaseoli strains target the promoters of genes of similar functions. This could be a trace of convergent evolution among TAL effectors from different phylogenetic groups, and comforts the hypothesis that TAL effectors have been implied in the adaptation to common bean. Conclusions: Altogether, our results favour a model where plasmidic TAL effectors are able to contribute to host adaptation by being horizontally transferred between distant lineages...|$|R
