Half an hour later the General came out, and without delay started with the staff, Captain Fitton remaining behind {{to see that the}} rest of the stores were sent off, and a small tent for the use of the General.

6000|$|The {{boys were}} quite bewildered as they stepped ashore by the bustle and confusion. Brawny porters {{carrying}} <b>heavy</b> <b>packages</b> {{on their backs}} pushed along unceremoniously, saying {{from time to time}} in a mechanical sort of way, [...] "By your leave, sir!" [...] but pushing on and shouldering passersby into the gutter without the smallest compunction. The narrowness and dinginess of the streets greatly surprised and disappointed the boys, who found that in these respects even Harwich compared favourably with the region they were traversing. Presently, however, after passing through several lanes and alleys, they emerged into a much broader street, alive with shops. The people who were walking here were for the most part well dressed and of quiet demeanour, and there was none of the rough bustle that had prevailed in the riverside lanes.|$|E
60|$|After {{the quiet}} of Little Primpton, the hurry and the noise of Victoria were a {{singular}} relief to James. Waiting for his luggage, he watched the various movements of the scene--the trollies pushed along with warning cries, the porters lifting <b>heavy</b> <b>packages</b> on to the bellied roof of hansoms, the people running to and fro, the crowd of cabs; and driving out, he was exhilarated by the confusion in the station yard, and the intense life, half gay, half sordid, of the Wilton Road. He took a room in Jermyn Street, according to Major Forsyth's recommendation, and walked to his club. James {{had been out of}} London so long that he came back with the emotions of a stranger; common scenes, the glitter of shops, the turmoil of the Circus, affected him with pleased surprise, and with a child's amusement he paused to stare at the advertisements on a hoarding. He looked forward to seeing old friends, and on his way down Piccadilly even expected to meet one or two of them sauntering along.|$|E

60|$|The yard {{presented}} {{none of that}} bustle {{and activity}} which are the usual characteristics of a large coach inn. Three or four lumbering wagons, each {{with a pile of}} goods beneath its ample canopy, about the height of the second-floor window of an ordinary house, were stowed away beneath a lofty roof which extended over one end of the yard; and another, which was probably to commence its journey that morning, was drawn out into the open space. A double tier of bedroom galleries, with old Clumsy balustrades, ran round two sides of the straggling area, and a double row of bells to correspond, sheltered from the weather by a little sloping roof, hung over the door leading to the bar and coffee-room. Two or three gigs and chaise-carts were wheeled up under different little sheds and pent-houses; and the occasional heavy tread of a cart-horse, or rattling of a chain at the farther end of the yard, announced to anybody who cared about the matter, that the stable lay in that direction. When we add that a few boys in smock-frocks were lying asleep on <b>heavy</b> <b>packages,</b> wool-packs, and other articles that were scattered about on heaps of straw, we have described as fully as need be the general appearance of the yard of the White Hart Inn, High Street, Borough, on the particular morning in question.|$|E
60|$|Then {{came the}} last night before their departure; the evening before the day on which they were to go from Pollington to London, and from London to Plymouth. All the <b>heavy</b> <b>packages,</b> and all the clothes had, of course, been put on board the Goldfinder in the London docks. The {{pleasant}} task of preparation was at an end, and they were now to go forth upon their hard labours. Caldigate had become so intimate with the family, that {{it seemed as though}} a new life had sprung up for him, and that as he had parted from all that he then had of a family at Folking, he was now to break away from new ties under the doctor's roof. They had dined early, and at ten o'clock there was what Mrs. Shand called a little bit of supper. They were all of them high in heart, and very happy,--testifying their affection to the departing ones by helping them to the nicest bits, and by filling their tumblers the fullest. How it happened, no one could have said, but it did happen that, before the evening was over, Maria and Caldigate were together in a little room behind the front parlour. What still remained of their luggage was collected there, and this last visit had probably been made in order that the packages might be once more counted.|$|E
60|$|The state-room {{had grown}} pretty fast; but {{by this time}} it had {{expanded}} into something quite bulky, and almost boasted a bay- window to view the sea from. So we went upon deck again in high spirits; and there, everything {{was in such a}} state of bustle and active preparation, that the blood quickened its pace, and whirled through one's veins on that clear frosty morning with involuntary mirthfulness. For every gallant ship was riding slowly up and down, and every little boat was splashing noisily in the water; and knots of people stood upon the wharf, gazing with a kind of 'dread delight' on the far-famed fast American steamer; and one party of men were 'taking in the milk,' or, in other words, getting the cow on board; and another were filling the icehouses to the very throat with fresh provisions; with butchers'-meat and garden-stuff, pale sucking-pigs, calves' heads in scores, beef, veal, and pork, and poultry out of all proportion; and others were coiling ropes and busy with oakum yarns; and others were lowering <b>heavy</b> <b>packages</b> into the hold; and the purser's head was barely visible as it loomed in a state, of exquisite perplexity from the midst of a vast pile of passengers' luggage; and there seemed to be nothing going on anywhere, or uppermost in the mind of anybody, but preparations for this mighty voyage. This, with the bright cold sun, the bracing air, the crisply-curling water, the thin white crust of morning ice upon the decks which crackled with a sharp and cheerful sound beneath the lightest tread, was irresistible. And when, again upon the shore, we turned and saw from the vessel's mast her name signalled in flags of joyous colours, and fluttering by their side the beautiful American banner with its stars and stripes, - the long three thousand miles and more, and, longer still, the six whole months of absence, so dwindled and faded, that the ship had gone out and come home again, and it was broad spring already in the Coburg Dock at Liverpool.|$|E

50|$|Nonetheless, {{as soon as}} the {{airplane}} touched ground, a caravan of cars and police patrols entered the runway and surrounded the plane. From the cargo hold they removed 11 big and <b>heavy</b> <b>packages</b> that were loaded onto the cars and sped away.

Eduardo Paredes, director of the civil police, who had arrived from Cuba in the same plane (and who claimed the packages as his personal cargo) refused the officials' request for access and ordered them to withdraw. When the customs officers in turn refused to allow them to proceed, they received a personal call from the Interior Minister, HernÃ¡n del Canto, who ordered them to let the packages be interned without further ado.The bypassing of customs was organized by Canto and Congress later succeeded to impeach him.|$|E
50|$|Defenses {{would rather}} {{not have to go}} to the eight in the box {{strategy}} because it takes away from the pass coverage. However, teams that run the ball effectively force defenses to go to this strategy. Once a defense does this, the offense can run play-action passes to keep the defenders near the line of scrimmage as the receivers (usually 1 or 2 since, often, <b>heavy</b> <b>packages</b> are in the game including tight ends in place of receivers) run by them and have an entire field to run away from a cornerback, putting the defensive backs at a disadvantage. This scheme can also work against the team that is covering the run. In a base defensive set, there are 3 levels of defenders; line, linebackers, and safeties. The safeties are there to keep runners from going all the way for the score. However, when one safety creeps down toward the line of scrimmage, that leaves only one high safety to make the tackle once the runner has broken the first line of defense.|$|E

This handle permits comfortable carrying, with otherwise bare hands, of a <b>heavy</b> <b>package,</b> suspended on a tight string that passes around the top and bottom of it: the string is strong enough to support it, but the pressure the string would exert on fingers that grasped it directly would often be unacceptable.|$|R

40|$|We have {{extended}} classical pattern avoidance {{to a new}} structure: multiple task-precedence posets whose Hasse diagrams have three levels, which we will call diamonds.

We used Sage to form enumerative conjectures for the associated permutations avoiding collections of patterns of length three, which we then proved. We have discovered a bijection between diamonds avoiding 132 and certain generalized Dyck paths. We have also found the generating function for descents, and therefore the number of avoiders, in these permutations {{for the majority of}} collections of patterns of length three. An interesting application of this work (and the motivating example) can be found when task-precedence posets represent warehouse package fulfillment by robots, in which case avoidance of both 231 and 321 ensures we never stack two <b>heavier</b> <b>packages</b> on top of a lighter package.

40|$|Results {{of tests}} of drum-type RAM {{packages}} employing conventional clamp-ring closures have caused {{concern over the}} DOT 6 M Specification Package. To clarify these issues, {{a series of tests}} were performed to determine the response of the clamp-ring closure to the regulatory Hypothetical Accident Condition (9 m) drop tests, for packages at maximum allowable weight. Three enhanced closure designs were also tested: the Clamshell, plywood disk reinforcement, and J-Clip. The results of the tests showed that the standard closure was unable to retain the top for both Center-of-Gravity-Over-Corner and Shallow Angle cases, for the standard package, at its maximum allowed weight. Similar results were found for packages dropped from a reduced height. The Clamshell design provided the best performance of the enhanced closures. It was concluded that the closure ring design employed on the 6 M is inadequate to retain the top during the regulatory test sequence, for packages at the maximum allowed weight. For large <b>heavy</b> <b>packages,</b> the Center-of-Gravity- Over-Corner case is more challenging than the Shallow Angle case.

The total packaging surface of flexible films possessing a high barrier against the permeation of gases, moisture and flavor covers about 16 % of all used packagings. The demanded for high barrier properties by lower material consumption {{can be achieved by}} using additional barrier layers, as vacuum evaporated Al, AlOx and SiOx layers. The production chain of high barrier laminates is film production, vacuum web coating and lamination.

As final process step, the lamination process is the key issue for the barrier of the total laminate against oxygen, moisture and flavor, because on the one hand it can destroy the functionality of the vacuum evaporated barrier layer {{and on the other hand}} it can improve the barrier by an order of magnitude due to the synergetic effect between the barrier layer and the adhesive...|$|R
40|$|The safe {{transportation}} {{of new and}} spent nuclear fuel {{is an essential part}} of the nuclear fuel cycle. The aim of this thesis was to obtain a more thorough understanding of the mechanical loading acting on <b>heavy</b> nuclear <b>packages</b> during rail transportation. There were two motivating factors for this study. Firstly, the design of equipment used to tie down a package to its conveyance has become more challenging with the recent trend of increasing package mass; often exceeding 100 tonnes. This difficulty is due to the advisory acceleration factors recommended for design. Despite widespread acceptance that the factors ensure safety, it is also recognised that for <b>heavier</b> <b>packages</b> they can be prohibitive and result in over engineered tie down systems. Secondly, transportation imparts complex dynamic mechanical loading on packages and the fuel assemblies within them. There have been no reported instances in the UK of problems caused by fuel vibrations. However international studies have prompted this investigation. A rail wagon and tie down system for a 100 tonne package were instrumented with accelerometers and strain gauges. The measurements were taken during a routine rail journey from Barrow-in-Furness to Sellafield. Continuous data was digitally recorded with a sampling rate sufficient to capture shock and vibrations up to 100 Hz. Accelerometers were selected to measure very low frequencies to capture quasi-static loading. Investigation of the frequency content of the accelerations indicated that digital filtering of the data is necessary to determine the magnitudes of the structural loading on tie downs. A method for designing a suitable filter has been developed. A sensitivity analysis of different filters indicated there is a possibility for over estimating loads based on measured data due to poor filter design. Industrial design of tie downs using FEA requires pragmatic run times. This motivated a comparison of the measured strain time histories with the results of a linear static FEA model. The correlation between measured and predicted strains, was strong at frequencies < 3. 5 Hz. A residuals analysis indicated that the model predicted the underlying strain process accurately. The methods described are generic and adaptable. They will aid any future experimental work, to characterise shock, vibration and quasi-static loads acting on nuclear packages and their ancillary equipment...|$|R

40|$|Freight rail {{is often}} the {{preferred}} method for transportation of dangerous goods. One particular application {{is the use of}} rail to convey radioactive material in purpose built packages. During transit, packages are secured to a rail wagon bed with a tie down system. The design of tie down systems vary considerably depending on package type and rail vehicle, for example shackles, turnbuckles, tie-rods, gravity wells or transport frames are all commonly used. There are also a large number of different packages in existence that all vary in size and mass; typically 1 - 7 m in length and 100 kg - 100 tonnes in mass. Despite the uniqueness of many transport configurations the design of tie down systems is always carried out using a limited set of design load cases as defined in the appropriate Codes of Practice and Standards. Many authors have suggested that the load cases within the standards need revision or question which load cases should apply to which scenario. In a previous experiment accelerations and strains have been measured on a freight wagon and transport frame of a <b>heavy</b> <b>package</b> during a routine rail journey. From these data new insight into the magnitude and nature of loading has been gained. In the present study the measured accelerations have been used as input to a Finite Element Model (FEM) of the transport frame and a method based on correlation between predicted and measured strains has been developed to determine an appropriate low pass filter cutoff frequency, fc, which separates quasi-static loading from raw dynamic data. The residual dynamic measurements have been assessed using signals processing techniques to understand their significance. The FEM has also been used to assess the presence of contact and boundary nonlinearities and how they affect the agreement between measured and predicted strains...|$|R

40|$|The use of {{the heavy}} metals cadmium, mercury, {{chromium}} and lead in packaging is forbidden internationally for some years because these substances are harmful to the environment.
