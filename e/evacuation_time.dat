40|$|In this contribution, a {{combination}} of a macroscopic and a microscopic model of pedestrian dynamics using a bidirectional coupling technique is presented which allows to obtain better predictions for <b>evacuation</b> <b>times.</b> While the macroscopic model is derived from dynamic network flow theory, the microscopic model is based on a cellular automaton.

Proper planning will use multiple exits, contra-flow lanes, and special technologies to ensure full, fast and complete evacuation. Consideration for personal situations which may affect an individual's ability to evacuate is taken into account, including alarm signals that use both aural and visual alerts, and also evacuation equipment such as sleds, pads, and chairs for non-ambulatory people.

40|$|Emergency {{evacuations}} during fires {{have historically}} {{been identified as a}} safety concern for super tall buildings. Stage evacuations and evacuations to a refuge floor were implemented as solutions, but after the World Trade Center tragedy, surveys showed occupants were unwilling to stay on refuge floors. This study proposes an alternative - horizontal evacuation using skybridges between towers taller than 200 m (656 ft.). Skybridges can reduce the chances of normal vertical downward evacuation routes being blocked and increase a building's evacuation efficiency without increasing the number of stairs. Linking up refuge floors in building clusters using skybridges would further reduce <b>evacuation</b> <b>times.</b> In this paper, we evaluate the skybridge design in terms of <b>evacuation</b> <b>times</b> in a typical 200 m (656 ft.) -tall building.

40|$|UK {{statistics}} {{have shown}} that {{a significant percentage of}} fatalities in fires have suffered from some kind of disability. In this context 'disability' relates to a person's physical or mental condition that impinges on their ability to react and move promptly in an emergency. Various evacuation modelling techniques are being adopted to study the movement of occupants during emergencies since the exposure of people to fires for experimental purposes is unethical. However, many evacuation models have ignored the effects of disability on escape potential and therefore tend to predict optimal <b>evacuation</b> <b>times.</b> Moreover, whilst providing some valuable insights into certain factors affecting occupant movement, current models are generally presented in isolation and fail to define a general framework for designing solutions to fire safety engineering problems. The purpose of this research programme was to develop a more general methodology for predicting <b>evacuation</b> <b>times</b> of mixed-ability populations. This was made possible through the development and use of a novel concept of evacuation peiformance index (EPI), which is the relative ease of evacuating a disabled person compared to an able-bodied person, founded on a consideration of the effects of disabilities and mobility aids on <b>evacuation</b> <b>times.</b> The author shows how this concept relates three aspects of fire safety, namely, individual characteristics of disabled occupants, the amount of assistance they require, and building design and environmental factors. She contends that the evacuation peifornzance index of a class of individuals is primarily dependent on these three categories. Experimental data to verify the above claim was collected from careflully monitored evacuation drills involving a group of disabled people. Their EPIs were determined along a pre-defined route from which their <b>evacuation</b> <b>times</b> were calculated. Comparisons between predicted times using the EPI concept and measured times from alternative empirical data were seen to be in reasonable agreement. An iterative design procedure is also suggested; one that is capable of predicting worst possible <b>evacuation</b> <b>times</b> by incorporating measures of EPI and escape route dimensions and details. The EPI concept provides fire safety engineering with a logical design philosophy, which is flexible and easily comprehensible. It endeavours to increase understanding of evacuation of disabled people, and provide a simplified mechanism for fire safety design and planning of evacuation procedures...|$|R

The main components of the lift model are described including the lift: kinematics, attributes and dispatch control. The agent–lift interaction model is also described, including the lift bank selection, the lift waiting area behaviour (wait location selection and wait duration) and the lift car selection and entry. The lift model is used to investigate a series of full building evacuation scenarios based on a hypothetical 50 floor building with four staircases and a population of 7840 agents. The analysis explores the relative merits of using up to 32 lifts (arranged in four banks) and various egress lift dispatch strategies to evacuate the entire building population. Findings from the investigation suggest that the most efficient evacuation strategy utilizes a combination of lifts and stairs to empty the building and clear the upper half of the building in minimum time.
