5|$|Although the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition was {{traditionally}} {{the most prestigious}} venue for English artists to display their new material, Watts chose to exhibit Hope at the smaller Grosvenor Gallery. In 1882 the Grosvenor Gallery had staged a retrospective exhibition of Watts's work and <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>an</b> attachment to the venue. Also, at this time the Grosvenor Gallery was generally more receptive than the Royal Academy to experimentation. Hope was given the prime spot in the exhibition, in {{the centre of the}} gallery's longest wall.|$|E
5|$|On February 4, 1860, {{two members}} of the company's board of {{directors}} wrote a letter requesting Helm's resignation; they claimed they had voted for his re-election as president of the company with the understanding that he would resign when the main line between Louisville and Nashville was finished. Helm maintained that <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>an</b> obligation to the citizens of Logan County – many of whom he had personally sold stock to – to remain president until the Memphis branch through their county was built. The rift between Helm and the directors continued to widen, however. Helm resigned on February 21, 1860, and was replaced by James Guthrie. The Memphis branch was completed on September 24, 1860.|$|E
5|$|Fall Gelb ("Case Yellow"), {{the initial}} {{plan for the}} {{invasion}} of France, was prepared by Commander-in-Chief of the Army Colonel General (Generaloberst) Walther von Brauchitsch, Halder, {{and other members of}} the OKH in early October 1939. Like the Schlieffen Plan of World War I, it called for an encirclement attack through the Netherlands and Belgium. Hitler was not satisfied, so revisions of the plan continued throughout October. Manstein was not satisfied with the plan either, as it focused heavily on the northern wing; <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>an</b> attack from this direction would lack the element of surprise and would expose the German forces to counterattacks from the south. The terrain in Belgium was not well-suited as a base of operations for further attacks on France, so Manstein felt the operation would fail to wipe out the enemy—as it did in the First World War—leading to only partial success and trench warfare. By the end of October Manstein had prepared the outline of a different plan and submitted it to the OKH via his superior, Rundstedt, for whom he was now serving as chief of staff of Army Group A.|$|E

25|$|In 1887, Nietzsche {{wrote the}} polemic On the Genealogy of Morality. During the same year, he {{encountered}} {{the work of}} Fyodor Dostoyevsky, to whom <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>an</b> immediate kinship. He also exchanged letters with Hippolyte Taine and Georg Brandes. Brandes, who had started to teach the philosophy of Søren Kierkegaard in the 1870s, wrote to Nietzsche asking him to read Kierkegaard, to which Nietzsche replied that {{he would come to}} Copenhagen and read Kierkegaard with him. However, before fulfilling this promise, he slipped too far into illness. In the beginning of 1888, Brandes delivered in Copenhagen one of the first lectures on Nietzsche's philosophy.|$|E
25|$|Pettitte was one {{of several}} Yankees named in the Mitchell Report, {{released}} on December 13, 2007. Mitchell and his staff received the information on Pettitte from McNamee, who told them he injected Pettitte with HGH on 2–4 occasions in 2002 so that he would heal from an elbow injury quicker. Pettitte verified McNamee's claim, admitting to using the HGH on two occasions in 2002, as it was meant to help heal an injury, and not to enhance his performance. Pettitte said <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>an</b> obligation to return to the team as quickly as possible. He denied any further usage of HGH during his career; he also denied use of steroids or any other performance-enhancing drug.|$|E
25|$|In 1947, when India {{attained}} independence, Periyar {{called for}} members of the Dravidar Kazhagam to boycott the celebrations. According to him, the Indian National Congress was dominated by Brahmins. He predicted that an independent India would bring South Indians, especially Tamils, under the dominance of Brahmins and North Indians. In other words, according to Periyar, independence would lead to the replacement of British dominance with Brahmin and North Indian dominance. <b>He</b> <b>felt</b> <b>an</b> independent nation called Dravida Nadu for the South Indians would be the best solution. Periyar declared 15 August 1947, the day of Indian independence, as a day of mourning. This move was opposed by other leaders within the party, including C. N. Annadurai. Annadurai viewed independence as an achievement for all of India rather than solely of the Aryan North.|$|E

25|$|Will {{returns to}} The Great Hall, and learns the form each sign will take. Will reveals {{the first sign}} within Gwen’s pendant. As the sign-seeker, Will travels through time to find the next four signs. The Rider enlists a mysterious figure {{to help him get}} the signs from Will. When Will's brother invites Maggie to their home, she reveals some of her powers to Will. Will reveals his {{affections}} for her, saying <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>an</b> instant connection with her. He tells her he has been thinking of her constantly. The Rider also tricks Will's older brother Max, using his magic to partially control him. The spell over Max is finally broken when Will uses his great strength to give Max a concussion. By the fifth day, The Dark that The Rider commands has now gained tremendous power and begins to attack the village with a terrible blizzard. Will locates the fifth sign but without the sixth sign, the Dark continues to rise. Maggie is revealed to be the mysterious witch helping the Rider in exchange for immortal youth. She is betrayed by him (for failing to get ANY of the signs) when she fails to get the fifth sign and ages rapidly, disintegrating into a flood of water while trying to steal them from Will. The Old Ones and Will seek sanctuary in the Great Hall, where the Rider cannot enter unless invited. However, The Rider's final trick (impersonating the voices of Will's mother and father, as well as Gwen) gains him access to The Great Hall. The Rider reveals that he has trapped Tom, whom The Rider mistook for The Seeker and kidnapped, within a glass sphere (and apparently took care of all these years). He sends Will into an evil dark cloud. As he enters, Will solves the riddle of the sixth sign: he himself is the sixth sign. With all six signs identified The Rider cannot touch nor harm Will. Using his power over the dark, Will banishes both The Rider – imprisoning the evil figure within one of his own glass spheres – and The Dark. The sphere disappears into murky water. Will and Tom are reunited and return to their family, who are shocked to see Tom.|$|E

Malik, whom Warne and Waugh had accused of attempting to bribe them, said that he was delighted at the revelation. The Pakistani player said that the revelations discredited his accusers and vindicated his protestations of innocence. On the preceding tour of Pakistan a few months earlier, Waugh had appeared before a Pakistan Cricket Board judicial inquiry in Lahore to present his claims against Malik; the inquiry questioned the credibility of both Australian players and asked them to return to Pakistan to re-present their accounts of the events.|$|E
500|$|Reflecting on the series' progression, Eurogamer Chris Schilling {{said that}} Saints Row IV {{successfully}} reinvented the series yet again, with superpowers replacing {{the usefulness of}} in-game vehicles. He compared the game's exploration mechanics to that of Crackdown, and its superpowers to the Infamous and Prototype series, and added that the game's silliness fulfilled a specific niche in gaming. Schilling wrote that the need to restock at ammo shops was a [...] "jarring holdover" [...] from the previous games, but appreciated the recurrence of elements such as the GPS navigation system, side mission gameplay, and city district liberation. He regarded the game overall as artful but [...] "gloriously dumb", like [...] "the Sistine Chapel ceiling of stupidity". Schilling also commented on how <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>an</b> urge to simply forgo the story to search for collectibles, though despite these options, the game became [...] "wearying" [...] over long play sessions.|$|E
500|$|N. T. Rama Rao {{was chosen}} to play Nagaraju, a {{sculptor}} {{during the period of}} Krishnadevaraya's rule. Narasimha Reddy wanted to cast a fresh face for the role of Malliswari and screen-tested Kannada actress Revathi. He later finalised Bhanumathi Ramakrishna, who played a negative role in his previous film Swarga Seema (1945), as the film's female lead, as <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>an</b> experienced actress with a good voice would do better justice to the role. Revathi made a cameo appearance in the song [...] "Poyi Ravamma". Differences arose between Narasimha Reddy and Bhanumathi due to the latter's lack of punctuality. Due to the delay in production of Malliswari, Bhanumathi had begun working in Prema (1952), which was produced by her husband P. S. Ramakrishna Rao. As she sported a curly hairdo, a body double was used for a few sequences as it was in contrast to the simple and soft tresses she sported in this film. Regarding the same, Bhanumathi criticised Narasimha Reddy, stating that he wanted his actresses to concentrate on his films and avoid getting married.|$|E

500|$|After multi-platinum success, arena tours, and cameo {{appearances}} (American Pie), {{the band}} recorded Take Off Your Pants and Jacket (2001), which debuted at {{number one in}} the United States, Canada, and Germany. Hit singles [...] "The Rock Show","Stay Together for the Kids" [...] and [...] "First Date" [...] continued the band's mainstream success worldwide, with MTV cementing its image as video stars. Finn returned to produce the record and was a key architect of the [...] "polished" [...] pop punk sound, and he served as an invaluable member of the band: part adviser, part impartial observer, he helped smooth out tensions and hone their sound. Recording sessions were sometimes contentious, as DeLonge strove for heavier and dirtier guitar-driven rock. With time off from touring, <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>an</b> [...] "itch to do something where he didn't feel locked in to what Blink was," [...] and channeled his chronic back pain and resulting frustration into Box Car Racer (2002), a post-hardcore disc that further explores his Fugazi and Refused inspiration. Refraining from paying for a studio drummer, he invited Barker to record drums on the project and Hoppus felt betrayed. The event caused great division within the trio for some time and was an unresolved tension {{at the forefront of the}} band's later hiatus. Barker also explored hip-hop influences and teamed up with Rancid's Tim Armstrong to form the rap rock band Transplants.|$|E
500|$|During 1982, Livingstone {{made new}} {{appointments}} to the GLC governance, with John McDonnell appointed key chair {{of finance and}} Valerie Wise chair of the new Women's Committee, while Sir Ashley Bramall became GLC chairman and Tony McBrearty was appointed chair of housing. Others stayed in their former positions, including Dave Wetzel as transport chair and Mike Ward as chair of industry; thus was created what biographer John Carvel described as [...] "the second Livingstone administration", leading to a [...] "more calm and supportive environment". Turning his attention once more to Parliament, Livingstone attempted to get selected as the Labour candidate for the constituency of Brent East, a place which <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>an</b> [...] "affinity" [...] for and where several friends lived. At the time, the Brent East Labour Party was in strife as competing factions battled for control, with Livingstone attempting to gain the support of both the hard and soft left. Securing a significant level of support from local party members, he nonetheless failed to apply for candidacy in time, and so the incumbent centrist Reg Freeson was once more selected as Labour candidate for Brent East. A subsequent vote at the council meeting revealed that 52 local Labour members would have voted for Livingstone, with only 2 for Freeson and 3 abstentions. Nevertheless, in the United Kingdom general election, 1983, Freeson {{went on to win}} the Brent East constituency for Labour. In 1983, Livingstone began co-presenting a late night television chat show with Janet Street-Porter for London Weekend Television.|$|E
