5|$|In this respect, Traherne's work {{is often}} {{compared}} to the abounding joy and mysticism found {{in the works of}} William Blake, Walt Whitman, and Gerard Manley Hopkins. According to Traherne scholar Denise Inge, Traherne's introduction of a child's viewpoint to narrate his theological and moral premises was unknown or certainly unappreciated in the literature of this time. His poems frequently explore the glory of creation and what he perceived as his intimate relationship with God. He drew deeply on the writings of Aristotle and on the early Church Fathers for his concept of Man and human nature. Little mention is made of sin and suffering in the works that have dominated 20th-century criticism, and some critics <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>his</b> verse as bordering upon pantheism (or perhaps panentheism).|$|E
5|$|Patricia Jones {{never made}} it to her house that evening, {{according}} to her husband. Walter Jones filed a missing persons report with police the next day and began calling people he thought might <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>his</b> wife. He got a lead when he spoke to friends of Patricia's who carpooled to work with her. The friends told Jones that Patricia had reported receiving a phone call that day from an unnamed woman who wanted to meet with her. She had asked the carpool driver to drop her off at a street corner in Independence, which he had done. The occupants of the carpool had seen a woman waiting for Jones in another car at the shop but did not recognize her. They nevertheless provided a description of the unknown woman to Jones.|$|E
5|$|Many {{politicians}} {{with strong}} personalities {{and a powerful}} attachment to the institution of Congress are reputed still to roam the halls of Congress long after their deaths. The shades of Representative Joseph Cannon (R-Ill. and Speaker from 1903 to 1911) and Rep. Champ Clark (D-Mo. and Speaker from 1911 to 1919) are claimed to occasionally return to the dark chamber of the House of Representatives after midnight and, after a loud rap from a gavel, resume the strong, angry debates they once had in life. Members of the United States Capitol Police have claimed to have seen Senator (and from 1852 to 1854, Representative) Thomas Hart Benton sitting at a desk in National Statuary Hall, although {{it has not been}} used as a legislative chamber since 1857. Steve Livengood, chief tour guide for the United States Capitol Historical Society, says he has seen the ghost of former Representative Wilbur Mills (D-Ark.) near Mills' former office late at night. Pierre Charles L'Enfant, although not a politician, was a brevet Major during the American Revolutionary War who served with George Washington at Valley Forge. In 1791, L'Enfant was appointed architect and planner of the new city of Washington in the District of Columbia. Although L'Enfant submitted grandiose plans for the new capital city, his plans were never fully adopted and President Washington dismissed him. L'Enfant spent {{much of the rest of}} his life attempting to wrest a monetary payment from Congress, and he died in poverty in 1825. Eyewitnesses, however, claim to <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>his</b> spirit walking through the Capitol, head down, murmuring to himself, with the plans for the capital city tucked under his arm.|$|E

25|$|Unable to help themselves, {{the king}} of Tanjore and Vangaru Tirumala called for the {{assistance}} of the Marathas of Satara. These people had their own grievance against the Nawabs of Arcot, with whom Chanda Sahib still was identified, because of long-delayed payment of the chouth, or one-fourth of their revenues, which they had promised in return for the withdrawal of the Marathas from their country and the discontinuation of their incursions. They also were encouraged to attempt reprisals by the Nizam of Hyderabad, who – jealous of the increasing power of the Nawab and careless of the loyalty due to co-religionists – gladly would <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>his</b> dangerous subordinate brought to the ground.|$|E
25|$|In July 1863 {{the family}} moved to Sullivan, Indiana, where Dresser's father became foreman of the newly opened Sullivan Woolen Mills. Although his father worked in other woolen mills in Ohio and Indiana, he was not a {{successful}} businessman or manager of a mill. During Dresser's youth the family struggled with periods of poverty and misfortune. In 1865 Dresser's father temporarily lost his job after a fire destroyed the Sullivan mill; a year later he suffered a work-related head injury. In 1867 his father and two partners purchased and operated a new mill, but the business lost its roof in a storm and the men sold it for a loss. As a young boy living in Sullivan, Dresser may <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>his</b> first minstrel groups and medicine-wagon shows. The town was frequented by bands that played many of the era's popular and patriotic songs at numerous carnivals, festivals, circuses, and fairs. By 1871 Dresser's family had returned to Terre Haute, where his father secured a job in another woolen mill.|$|E

His intemperate public utterances — {{he called the}} Sejm a [...] "prostitute" [...] – and his sending ninety armed officers into the Sejm building {{in response to an}} impending vote of no-confidence, caused concern in contemporary and modern-day observers who <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>his</b> actions as setting precedents for authoritarian responses to political challenges.|$|E
500|$|Beyond Smart's {{circle of}} friends, few {{were willing to}} dismiss claims that Smart was {{affected}} by madness. Most contemporary literary critics knew of Smart's time in asylum and, upon publication of his A Song to David, called attention to aspects of the poem which they could use to claim that Smart was still [...] "mad". The view was widely held, and the poet William Mason wrote to Thomas Gray, [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>his</b> Song to David & from thence conclude him as mad as ever." ...|$|E

"We {{will not}} give the {{portrait}} of Valentin Alkan from the rear, as in some photographs we <b>have</b> <b>seen.</b> <b>His</b> intelligent and original physiognomy deserves {{to be taken in}} profile or head-on. The head is strong; the deep forehead is that of a thinker; the mouth large and smiling, the nose regular; the years have whitened the beard and hair... the gaze fine, a little mocking. His stooped walk, his puritan comportment, give him the look of an Anglican minister or a rabbi– for which he has the abilities." ...|$|E

6000|$|The {{story of}} Macbeth {{impressed}} them very much. They knew {{the name of}} [...] Shakespeare, <b>having</b> <b>seen</b> <b>his</b> name over a public-house.|$|R
500|$|Some {{have seen}} this {{as a sign of}} Macbeth's power; others <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>his</b> presence, {{together}} with Iehmarc, who may be Echmarcach mac Ragnaill, as proof that Malcolm II was overlord of Moray and of the Kingdom of the Isles. Whatever the true state of affairs in the early 1030s, it seems more probable that Macbeth was subject to the king of Alba, Malcolm II, who died at Glamis, on 25 November 1034. The Prophecy of Berchan, apparently alone in near contemporary sources, says Malcolm died a violent death, calling it a [...] "kinslaying" [...] without actually naming his killers.

500|$|Like {{the vision}} of Banquo's lineage, the banquet scene has also {{been the subject of}} criticism. Critics have {{questioned}} whether not one, but perhaps two ghosts appear in this scene: Banquo and Duncan. Scholars arguing that Duncan attends the banquet state that Macbeth's lines to the Ghost could apply equally well to the slain king. [...] "Thou canst not say I did it", for example, can mean that Macbeth is not the man who actually killed Banquo, or it can mean that Duncan, who was asleep when Macbeth killed him, cannot claim to <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>his</b> killer. To add to the confusion, some lines Macbeth directs to the ghost, such as [...] "Thy bones are marrowless", cannot rightly be said of Banquo, who has only recently died.|$|E
500|$|The {{writer and}} actor Mark Gatiss, paying tribute to Kneale on the BBC News Online website {{shortly after his}} death, {{indicated}} that {{he was among the}} first rank of British television writers, but that this had been overlooked. [...] "He is amongst the greats—he is absolutely as important as Dennis Potter, as David Mercer, as Alan Bleasdale, as Alan Bennett, but I think because of a strange snobbery about fantasy or sci-fi it's never quite been that way." [...] Similarly, his obituary in The Guardian commented that: Kneale was {{by no means the only}} author to have been largely wasted by television, and to <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>his</b> status overtaken by soap opera hacks. But his place is secure, alongside Wells, Arthur C. Clarke, John Wyndham and Brian Aldiss, as one of the best, most exciting and most compassionate English science fiction writers of his century.|$|E

2500|$|Edgar Cayce {{was born}} on March 18, 1877, near Beverly, south of Hopkinsville, Kentucky. He was one of six {{children}} of farmers Carrie and Leslie B. Cayce.

[...] Particularly, he has been seen as alienating public lands and districtus (defence command) to private holders, especially bishops, though this is disputed. Some historians <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>his</b> [...] "private defense initiatives" [...] in a more positive light and have found a coherent policy of gift-giving.

2500|$|In 1921, Bartelme led an {{investigation}} {{to determine whether}} Vernon Parks, the captain of Michigan's baseball team and leading pitcher in the Big Ten Conference, had played baseball for Portland in the Pacific Coast League under the assumed name, Harold Brooks. Barthelme noted, [...] "This Brooks won 90 percent of his games I am told. I <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>his</b> picture and I am certain he is really Vernon Parks, our star pitcher. If the charges are true, {{there is no doubt}} that the University of Michigan will take drastic action." [...] Parks admitted to Bartelme that he had played for Portland and at the same time resigned from the Michigan team.|$|E
2500|$|Palmerston has {{traditionally}} been viewed as [...] "a Conservative at home and a Liberal abroad". He believed that the British constitution as secured by the Glorious Revolution of 1688 was the best which human hands had made, with a constitutional monarchy subject {{to the laws of}} the land but retaining some political power. He supported {{the rule of law and}} opposed further democratisation after the Reform Act 1832. He wished to see this liberal system of a mixed constitution in-between the two extremes of absolute monarchy and republican democracy replace the absolute monarchies on the Continent. More recently some historians <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>his</b> domestic policies as Prime Minister as not merely liberal but genuinely progressive by the standards of his era.|$|E
