5|$|Due to {{the project}} being split into two phases, it was decided for {{efficiency}} to design each phase as mirror image halves of one complete station with only the handful of items the whole site would share (like the flue stack and coal handling area) and so needed to be build in First Half, being the difference. This extended to seeking the same contractors and suppliers as worked on First Half for Completion. Unfortunately due to the decade timespan between comparable works on the 2 phases several manufacturers that had supplied First Half had merged or ceased trading, combined with changes in legislation, this meant numerous components and equipment ranges used for First Half were either no longer available for Completion or had significantly changed. Separately, operating experience over that timespan had led to <b>design</b> <b>improvement</b> in equipment and plant specified by the Board, leading to a few significant areas of the design of Completion being altered.|$|E

25|$|The Gemini {{crew capsule}} (referred {{to as the}} Reentry Module) was {{essentially}} an enlarged version of the Mercury capsule. Unlike Mercury, the retrorockets, electrical power, propulsion systems, oxygen, and water were located in a detachable Adapter Module behind the Reentry Module. A major <b>design</b> <b>improvement</b> in Gemini was to locate all internal spacecraft systems in modular components, which could be independently tested and replaced when necessary, without removing or disturbing other already tested components.|$|E

40|$|The I-Suit {{has been}} tested in varying environments at Johnson Space Center (JSC). This {{includes}} laboratory mobility testing, KC- 135 partial gravity flights, and remote field testing in the Mojave Desert. The experience gained from this testing has provided insight for <b>design</b> <b>improvements.</b> These improvements have been an evolutionary process since 1998 to the present. The <b>design</b> <b>improvements</b> affect existing suit components and introduce new components for systems processing and human/robotic interface. Examples of these <b>design</b> <b>improvements</b> include improved mobility joints, a new helmet with integrated communications and displays capability, and integration of textile switches for control of suit functions and tele-robotic operations. This paper addresses an overview of I-Suit <b>design</b> <b>improvements</b> and results of manned and unmanned performance tests. The performance tests include mobility joint testing, helmet visibility testing, and system level manned testing of the improved suit components...|$|R
25|$|By the 1920s, most banks avoided using safes {{and instead}} turned to gigantic, heavy vaults with walls and doors several feet thick. These {{were meant to}} {{withstand}} not only robbers but also angry mobs and natural disasters. Despite the new security measures, these vaults were still vulnerable to yet another new invention, the cutting torch. Burning oxygen and acetylene gas at about , the torch could easily cut through steel. It was in use as early as 1907, but became widespread with World War I. Robbers used cutting torches in over 200 bank robberies in 1924 alone. Manufacturers learned to sandwich a copper alloy into vault doors. If heated, the high thermal conductivity of copper dissipates the heat to prevent melting or burning. After this <b>design</b> <b>improvement,</b> bank burglaries fell off and were far less common {{at the end of}} the 1920s than at the beginning of the decade.|$|E
2500|$|A <b>design</b> <b>improvement</b> {{that came}} about {{was with the}} propellers. Akron, as {{originally}} built, was fitted with [...] two-bladed, fixed-pitch wooden propellers to each of her engines but, in June 1932, was modified to be fitted with new, three-bladed, variable pitch metal propellers. These new propellers were fitted to Macon as standard while she was under construction, increasing the ship's fuel efficiency. This, combined with design improvements that removed a number of hull protrusions (improving her aerodynamics) and a reduction of her overall dead weight {{by as much as}} , led to her achieving a speed of [...] during speed trials in August 1933, more than 3 knots faster than the maximum speed requirement specified by the Navy, and 6 knots faster than Akrons best recorded speed of 69 knots.|$|E
2500|$|In 1928 Mauretania was modernized {{with a new}} {{interior}} design {{and in the next}} year her speed record was broken by a German liner, , with a speed of [...] On 27 August, Cunard permitted the former ocean greyhound to have one final attempt to recapture the record from the newer German liner. She was taken out of service and her engines were adjusted to produce more power to give a higher service speed; however, this was still not enough. Bremen simply represented a new generation of ocean liners that were far more powerful and technologically advanced than the ageing Cunard liner. Even though Mauretania did not beat her German rival, the ship lost by just a fraction after decades of <b>design</b> <b>improvement</b> and beat all her own previous speed records both east and westbound. In 1929 Mauretania collided with a train ferry near Robbins Reef Light. No one was killed or injured and her damage was quickly repaired.|$|E
40|$|For the {{procurement}} of complex goods the early {{exchange of information}} is important to avoid costly renegotiation. If the buyer can specify the main characteristics of possible <b>design</b> <b>improvements</b> in a complete contingent contract, a scoring auction implements the efficient allocation. If this is not feasible, the buyer must choose between a price-only auction (discouraging early information exchange) and bilateral negotiations with a preselected seller (reducing competition). Bilateral negotiations are superior if potential <b>design</b> <b>improvements</b> are important, if renegotiation is particularly costly, and if the buyer's bargaining position is strong. Moreover, negotiations provide stronger incentives for sellers to investigate <b>design</b> <b>improvements...</b>|$|R
