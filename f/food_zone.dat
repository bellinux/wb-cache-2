40|$|The natural {{conditions}} within the <b>food</b> <b>zone</b> of Łódź urban administrative province are rather unfavourable for intensive agricultural production. The restricting elements include, first of all, the Iow precipitation sum {{especially at the}} time of intensive growth of plants, and too high share of soils with low bonitation classes poorly equipped with nutritive components and subject to overdrying. This accounts for a relatively big intensification of rye-and-potato crops giving on the average lower yields than the national average. This is best noticeable in southem regions of the zone. The northern part of the <b>food</b> <b>zone</b> has the most favourable index of agricultural effectiveness. That is due to, a suitable character of the land sculpture (mainly plains or small elevations) and soils of wheat complexes appearing here. Despite relatively low indexes, the {{natural conditions}} in the examined area do not reistrict develapment of crops production. At present they are utilized to an average degree. It is possible to expand largely the intensive crops cultivation area through better development of land reclamation and fertilization.

40|$|A big urban centre, as an {{absorptive}} {{consumer market}} of foodstuffs, exerts {{an influence on}} {{the profile of the}} agricultural production in neighbouring areas through market mechanisms. The theoretically delimitated area of the <b>food</b> <b>zone</b> in the urban administrative province of Łódź occupies 2, 381. 3 thousand hectare, and encompasses eight administrative units (provinces). This area is characterized with a distinct predominance of the agricultural function, which is reflected, among others, in a high percentage share of arabie land in the overall area considerably exceeding the national average figures. The biggest part of areas under crop is utilized for grains (55 p. c.), includlng mainly rye, which is cultivated almost twice as much intensively than the national average. Production of grains predominates in the central part of Sieradz province and {{in the eastern part of}} Piotrków province. Among the remaining crops, potatoes, sugar beets, and field cultures are of the biggest consumer importance. Production of food of vegetable origin in this zone accounts for ca. 10 per cent of the overall national production. In particular kinds of crops this share amounts to: grain — 9. 7 per cent, potatoes — 11. 6 per cent, vegetables — 10. 2 per cent, fruit — 8. 2 per cent. The northern areas of the <b>food</b> <b>zone</b> boast the highest agricultural productivity and those belonging to Piotrków province — the lowest. On the basis of the available planning reports and prevailing trends of changes in the land-cultivation structure, the author performed a rough estimation of production size (Table 7), which revealed favourable prospects of full satisfaction of food demand in Łódź agglomeration in the field of products of vegetable origin.

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} antianxiety {{property of}} Lactuca sativa, {{an important and}} commonly used leafy vegetable known for its medicinal properties belongs to Asteraceae family. Methods: Elevated plus maze (EPM), open field test (OFT), rat exposure test, hyponeophagia and marble burying test were performed in mice models to assess the exploratory behaviour and to assess anxiolytic property of hydro-alcohol extract of Lactuca sativa. Diazepam (1 mg/kg body wt.) served as the standard anxiolytic agent for all the tests. The dried extract of the plant leaf in doses of 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg body weight was administered orally to mice for duration of 15 or 30 days and evaluated exploratory behaviour, locomotor and anxiolytic activities. Results: Time spent and number of entries into the open arm was measured in EPM followed by total locomotor activity in OFT and latency to enter the <b>food</b> <b>zone</b> in hyponeophagia.

40|$|Farmers are {{experiencing}} {{the need to}} adapt to climate change, and are developing different strategies. This article contributes {{to the understanding of}} farmers' adaptation choices, their determinants and their implications, in relation to the household income. In 2014, Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) and 220 household surveys were carried out with farmers in coffee and <b>food</b> crop <b>zones</b> in Central Kenya. The Heckman model was used to evaluate the determinants of adaptation choices and their marginal effect. Farmers from the coffee zone or from the <b>food</b> crop <b>zone</b> perceive and adapt differently to climate change. Farmers who are aware of changes in climate are more willing to explore adaptation strategies. A positive relationship is found between adaptation to climate change and household income. The highest payoff/return is achieved if multiple adaptation choices are used rather than a single strategy. The choices of strategies are also determined by household characteristics, resource endowment, institutional variables, and climate information. The strong correlation between socio-institutional variables and adaptation capacity suggests the need for the establishment and strengthening of local institutions, such as micro-finance and extension.

40|$|The {{food economy}} on the {{national}} scale constitutes one of fundamental objectives in the state's economic policy. Till recently it was centrally controlled. And there are many factors pointing at the necess ity of its future inclusion in the national plan in conditions prevailing in the socialist economy. Implementation of the plan guidelines takes place within regional systems {{in accordance with the}} territorial differentiation of conditions and factors both in the produotion and consumption spheres. The real regionail compoments of the food economy do not always coincide with the spatial division of the country into administrative provinces but they are a consequence of spatial distribution of big food consumer markets represented by big towns and their agglomerations. In order to optimize provision of these markets with food with simultaneous minimization of transports costs there is postulated creation of „food regions" in Poland. Their focal points should be big consumer markets while their territorial coverage should determine demand for food. Such delimitation should be performed so as to leave at the disposal of each town and its agglomeration its own food-supply area. This area should be supplying amply, first of all, these products whose transport over longer distances is difficult or very expensive. Correct functioning of the postulated regions requires that relations between consumer and producer markets should not be restricted to flow of goods since they should also include co-operation ih the sphere of services and production. The concept of <b>food</b> <b>zones</b> for towns has been known in the scientific literature for a long time. It should, however, be constantly up-dated since technical, organizational, and economic progress leads continuously to changes in relations between the town and its food-supplying area. The thesis has been illustrated by a classical example of a highly urbanized and industrialized area spreading where the Rhein and the Main meet with such towns as Darmstadt, Frankfurt, Ludwigshafen, Mannheim, Heildelberg, Mainz and Wiesbaden. Taking the example of Łódź Agglomeration, the author is trying to present for discussion a working model of practical adaptation of a theoretical concept delimitating <b>food</b> <b>zones</b> for agglomerated settlement systems in conditions of Poland's economy characterized with unsatisfactory economic performance.
