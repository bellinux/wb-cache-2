This paper {{provides}} an overview of laboratory and field methods commonly used in research, clinical, and health/fitness settings to obtain valid measures of body composition and recommends specific methods and prediction equations for this purpose. These recommendations reflect the current state of knowledge about body composition assessment but are subject to modification as new information and technology become available. An extensive review of the literature suggests that d nsitometry (hydrodensitometry and air displacement pl thysmography), <b>hydrometry,</b> and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry are commonly used to obtain reference measures of body composition in research settings. Typically, estimates of body composition from densitometry or <b>hydrometry</b> are obtained using two-component body composition models (Body mass = fat-free mass + fat mass). The limitations of two-component models are addressed. Also, the merits, shortcomings, and technical errors associated with each of these laboratory methods are compared. Given that each of these reference methods yields indirect measures of body composition, none can be singled out as the “gold standard ” method for in viv body composition assessment. It is recommended, instead, that variables obtained from all three methods be used with a multi-component, molecular model to derive referenc...|$|E
40|$|Stage – {{discharge}} {{relationship is}} mainly developed from measured data in any <b>hydrometry</b> station. Measured data usually obtain in low to medium flow discharge, because {{in most cases}} {{it is very difficult}} to measure the flow discharge during flood. Therefore, the stage–discharge is extrapolated beyond the measured data to compute the flood which may estimate low or higher value. This is because during the high flow, the bed form is developed which causes the flow resistance to change. In order to establish a better stage – discharge relation, it is important to apply methods which consider the bed form resistance. In this study an attempt has been made to determine the best method for developing such relationship. To reach the goal, the required data such as river cross section, discharge and related stage and bed material gradation from Ghorbaghestan <b>hydrometry</b> station were measured for two years. Then a computer program was developed. Using this program and applying the measured data, the stage – discharge relationships were computed by five different methods. From the statistical comparison of the results of these methods with measured data, it was found that Shen, Brownlie, Engelund and White’s method overestimate the flow discharge. The best method was found to be the Einstein – Barbarossa’s method that provided the minimum absolute mean errors 0. 31 and 1. 468 m 3 /s and minimum root mean square error 0. 112 and 0. 466 m 3 /s for the two study years, respectivel...|$|E

DESIGN: All RMR and body composition measurements were conducted {{on the same day}} for each subject following compliance with premeasurement protocols. SUBJECTS: Data were generated from measurements on 104 males (age 32. 1 +/- 12. 1 y (mean+/-s. d.); body mass 81. 15 +/- 12. 85 kg; height 179. 5 +/- 6. 5 cm; body fat 20. 6 +/- 7. 6 %). INTERVENTIONS: Body density (BD), total body water (TBW) and bone mineral mass (BMM) were measured by hydrodensitometry, deuterium dilution and dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), respectively. These measures were used to determine two (hydrodensitometry: BD; hydrometry: TBW) -, three (BD and TBW) - and four- compartment (BD, TBW and BMM) FFM values. DXA also provided three compartment derived FFM values. RMR was measured using open circuit indirect calorimetry. RESULTS: Three (body fat group: lean, moderate, high) x five (body composition determination: hydrodensitometry, <b>hydrometry,</b> three-compartment, DXA, four-compartment) ANOVAs were conducted on FFM and RMR kJ. kg FFM(- 1). d(- 1). Within-group comparisons revealed that hydrodensitometry and DXA were associated with significant (P or = 0. 68) different from criterion values intraindividual differences were large (FFM: - 1. 5 to 2. 9 kg; RMR: - 6. 0 to 3. 2 kJ. kg FFM(- 1). d(- 1)). CONCLUSION: The relationship between RMR kJ. kg FFM(- 1). d(- 1) and exercise status would best be investigated using three (BD, TBW) - or four (BD, TBW, BMM) -compartment body composition models to determine FFM. Other models either significantly underestimate indexed RMR (hydrodensitometry, DXA) or display large intraindividual differences (<b>hydrometry)</b> compared with four-compartment derived criterion values.

The most essential objective of <b>hydrometry</b> still lies, according to the widely recognized opinion, in a precise determination of velocity of the water flow in a particular river basin. In order to measure the water speed, a hydrometric propeller and Pitot’s tube are frequently used. In the real situation we have measured the velocity of the points and the coordinates of these points in I places of the river basin. The aim of the measurement is to find the estimators of the streamline, the estimator of the maximal velocity on the streamline, the parameter κ 1, κ 2 and κ 3, describing the decrease of the velocity according to the distance from the streamline in x, y and z direction. The model described above could be studied by the theory of linear models. 1...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{ability of}} a new total-body {{electrical}} conductivity instrument (TOBEC) to monitor changes in body composition during weight reduction was examined. Twelve mod-erately overweight women were confined to a metabolic unit {{for a period of}} 8 wk, 2 -wk baseline and 6 -wk reduction periods, during which changes in body composition were assessed by den-sitometry and <b>hydrometry.</b> Additionally, TOBEC measures were taken to predict lean body mass (LBM) changes. A total of 6. 6 kg body weight was lost during the 6 -wk reduction period. A decline in LBM was observed during the first 3 wk of reduction, from 47. 4 to 45. 7 kg, with no further LBM decline observed. Changes observed in the TOBEC phase value corresponded to the observed changes in LBM and total body water (TBW) during baseline and reduction periods. TOBEC was sensitive to small changes in LJ 3 M and TBW and may be useful for monitoring composition changes during nutritional intervention programs. Am J Clin Nutr 1987; 46 : 5 - 8.
