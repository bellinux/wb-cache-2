50|$|The {{explosion}} {{was caused}} by a detached removable sleeve spacer inside the right engine. The detachment {{was caused by}} metal fatigue. Examination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> turbine <b>fragments</b> and their distribution during the explosion led to the conclusion that <b>the</b> ejection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fragments</b> didn't contribute to the crash, as <b>the</b> velocity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fragments</b> was substantially absorbed and decreased by the engine cowling. The NTSB noted that several parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> engine could not be found; they concluded that, based on their calculation and distribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fragments</b> on <b>the</b> ground, the unidentified parts were reduced to tiny, harmless bits.|$|R

40|$|AbstractWe {{investigate}} <b>the</b> {{angular distribution}} <b>of</b> scission particles taking account <b>of</b> <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> fission <b>fragments.</b> <b>The</b> time evolution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wave function <b>of</b> <b>the</b> scission particle is obtained by integrating the time-dependent Schrödinger equation. <b>The</b> effects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fission <b>fragments</b> {{are taken into}} account by means <b>of</b> <b>the</b> optical potentials. The angular distribution is strongly modified by <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fragments.</b> <b>The</b> attractive nuclear potential enhances the yield along <b>the</b> <b>fragment</b> axis for both neutrons and protons. For scission protons, the focusing effect due to the repulsive Coulomb field <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fragments</b> is demonstrated. In <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> asymmetric fission, it is found that <b>the</b> heavy <b>fragment</b> has stronger effects...|$|R
