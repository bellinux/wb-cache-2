An {{important goal}} of Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) {{research is to}} contribute to {{the quality of life of}} the elderly and handicapped people and help them to maintain an independent lifestyle with the use of sensors, signal processing and the available telecommunications infrastructure. From this perspective, detection of unusual human activities such as <b>falling</b> person <b>detection</b> has practical applications. In this thesis, a low-cost AAL system using vibration and passive infrared (PIR) sensors is proposed for <b>falling</b> person <b>detection,</b> human footstep detection, human motion detection, unusual inactivity detection, and indoor flooding detection applications. For the vibration sensor signal processing, various frequency analysis methods which consist of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT), mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC), discrete wavelet transform (DWT) with different filter-banks, dual-tree complex wavelet transform (DT-CWT), and single-tree complex wavelet transform (ST-CWT) are compared to each other to obtain the best possible classification result in our dataset. Adaptive-threshold based Markov model (MM) classifier is preferred for the human footstep detection. Vibration sensor based <b>falling</b> person <b>detection</b> system employs Euclidean distance and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers and these classifiers are compared to each other. PIR sensors are also used for <b>falling</b> person <b>detection</b> and this system employs two PIR sensors. To achieve the most reliable system, a multi-sensor based <b>falling</b> person <b>detection</b> system which employs one vibration and two PIR sensors is developed. PIR sensor based system has also the capability of detecting uncontrolled flames and this system is integrated to the overall system. The proposed AAL system works in real-time on a standard personal computer or chipKIT Uno 32 microprocessors without computers. A network is setup for the communication of the Uno 32 boards which are connected to different sensors. The main processor gives final decisions and emergency alarms are transmitted to outside of the smart home using the auto-dial alarm system via telephone lines.

Reducing hazards in the living environment and performing exercises for training balance and muscles are the common strategies for fall prevention. However, falls cannot be avoided completely; <b>fall</b> <b>detection</b> provides an alarm that can decrease injuries or death caused by the lack of rescue. The automatic <b>fall</b> <b>detection</b> system has opportunities to provide real-time emergency alarms for improving the safety and quality of home healthcare services. Two common technical challenges are also tackled in order to provide a reliable <b>fall</b> <b>detection</b> algorithm, including variability and ambiguity. We propose a novel hierarchical <b>fall</b> <b>detection</b> algorithm involving threshold-based and knowledge-based approaches to detect a fall event. The threshold-based approach efficiently supports the detection and identification of fall events from continuous sensor data. A multiphase fall model is utilized, including free fall, impact, and rest phases for the knowledge-based approach, which identifies fall events and has the potential to deal with the aforementioned technical challenges of a <b>fall</b> <b>detection</b> system.

Smart {{monitoring systems}} automate patient monitoring tasks and thereby improve the patient workflow management. Moreover, expert systems have the potential to improve clinicians’ performance by accurately executing repetitive tasks, to which humans are ill-suited. Clinicians working in hospital wards are responsible for conducting a multitude of tasks which require constant vigilance and thus the need for a smart decision support system has arisen. In particular, wireless patient monitoring systems are emerging as a low cost, reliable and accurate means of healthcare delivery. This study focuses on three important areas of healthcare: wireless, remote and real-time vital signs monitoring, interpreting multiple physical signs and <b>falls</b> <b>detection</b> and prediction for hospitalised older adults. Vital signs monitoring systems are rapidly becoming the core of today’s healthcare deliveries. The paradigm has shifted from traditional and manual recording to computer based electronic records and further to handheld devices as versatile and innovative healthcare monitoring systems. The system proposed in this thesis aims to aid in the diagnosis of patients’ health conditions from the collected vital signs and assist clinicians with the interpretation of multiple physical signs. Data from a total of 30 patients have been collected in New Zealand Hospitals under local and national ethics approvals. The system records blood pressure, heart rate (pulse), oxygen saturation (SpO 2), ear temperature and blood glucose levels from hospitalised patients and transfers this information to a web-based software application for remote monitoring and further interpretation. Ultimately, this system achieved a high level of agreement with clinicians’ interpretation when assessing specific physical signs such as bradycardia, tachycardia, hypertension, hypotension, hypoaxemia, fever and hypothermia, and was able to generate early warnings. The performance of the vital signs interpretation system was validated through off-line as well as real-time tests with a high level of agreement between the system and the physician. Another aim of this study was to develop a robust <b>falls</b> <b>detection</b> as well as falls risk prediction system. The proposed system employs real-time vital signs, motion data, falls history and other clinical information, which is a valuable tool for hospital falls prevention. The falls risk prediction model has been tested and evaluated with 30 patients using the hospital’s falls scoring scale...|$|R
