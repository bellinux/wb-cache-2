In {{an early}} November 2013 {{interview}} with Latina magazine, {{she said that}} she finds spirituality to be an important part of maintaining balance in life. She said: [...] "I'm the closest I've ever been with God. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> relationship with God and that's all that matters".|$|E
500|$|For {{much of his}} childhood, Smith's {{family was}} a part of the Community of Christ but began {{attending}} services at a local Methodist Church. Smith felt that going to church did little for him, except make him [...] "really scared of Hell". In 2001, he said: [...] "I don't necessarily buy into any officially structured version of spirituality. But <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> version of it." ...|$|E
500|$|Dinklage later {{appeared}} in the direct-to-DVD film Tiptoes (2003) with Gary Oldman and Matthew McConaughey. The film met with negative reviews, particularly Oldman's role as a person with dwarfism. According to Dinklage, the original cut of the film was [...] "gorgeous", but the director was fired shortly after turning it in, and the film was re-cut into a [...] "rom-com with dwarves". Speaking on the Oldman controversy, Dinklage said, [...] "There was some flak: Why would you put Gary Oldman on his knees? That's almost like blackface. And <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> opinions about political correctness, but I was just like, It's Gary Oldman. He can do whatever he wants, and I'm {{so happy to be}} here." ...|$|E

60|$|We dined {{together}} by the fireside. Peggotty was in attendance to wait upon us, but my mother wouldn't let her do it, and made her dine with us. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> old plate, with a brown view of a man-of-war in full sail upon it, which Peggotty had hoarded somewhere all the time <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been away, {{and would not have}} had broken, she said, for a hundred pounds. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> old mug with David on it, and <b>my</b> <b>own</b> old little knife and fork that wouldn't cut.|$|R
500|$|However, {{executive}} producer Bill Panzer {{was intrigued by}} the idea that a mortal would want to spend their life with an Immortal, this choice having several drawbacks. MacLeod does not age, while Tessa is mortal and will age. Despite their mutual wish, they know growing old together is impossible and this uneasy thought [...] "...haunts them both, sometimes more than others." [...] As an Immortal, MacLeod is also sterile and Tessa resigns herself to having no children. [...] "" [...] deals with Tessa's choice and its impact upon her life. In this episode, Tessa becomes very fond of a four-year-old girl and muses; [...] "For a while there, just for a few hours... I felt like she was mine. I liked how it felt. But, she's not... <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> life and it's more than enough." [...] Panzer commented that [...] "The Sea Witch" [...] "...brings forth in a very powerful way what exactly 's giving up to be with MacLeod." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{returning}} from his vacation, Saadiq started writing and recording The Way I See It, which took four months. In {{an interview for}} Sound on Sound, he discussed his comfort level when returning to Blakeslee Recording Company: [...] "The music for this album flowed organically, naturally, and since <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> studio I was able to perfect it and take my time to make it right. I was able {{to live with it}} day after day, and I think that {{had a lot to do}} with how the album turned out." [...] He wrote the songs extemporaneously, often by playing guitar and improvising riffs. He subsequently sung them while playing each instrument one at a time, including guitar, bass, and basic piano parts that he planned to include on the recordings. He attributed this secluded approach to [...] "the state of the industry" [...] and idealized [...] "bounc ideas off other people, do some writing with them, take the material to my band and say, 'OK, let's cut it,' with the orchestra already there. That's my dream. I'd crank records out weekly if I had staff writers like they did at Stax and Motown".|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{like good}} goth music {{a lot and}} I do see a certain {{connection}} in our music to goth but I've never had any inspiration to be like somebody else or {{to go in a}} certain style. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> ideas and if they ever too closely resemble something that I've heard before, I usually discard them." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> {{opinion on}} that point, {{but did not}} find it fit to say so. Then I put in what I thought was a master stroke.|$|R
60|$|I made no reply. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> inferences to draw, {{from what}} I knew through the {{housekeeper}} {{and from what}} I saw before me, and I did not choose to share them with Count Fosco.|$|R
60|$|Strong language! and {{suggestive of}} {{something}} below the surface, {{in the shape}} of a romance. But <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> object in view, and I declined (as we lawyers say) to pursue the question into its side issues.|$|R
2500|$|... "I've {{never stopped}} doing music. I've created a label called Planet 9 and I {{released}} an album in Japan. I invested {{in my own}} studio and it cut the recording cost down 95 percent. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> in-house producers {{and they are not}} as expensive as an established producer. The return is greater and now I own my masters. I see six dollars per album sold versus 10 cents. You may not sell as many units because you don't put as much money in promotions, but the returns are better." ...|$|E
2500|$|In February 2012, Adelson told Forbes {{magazine}} {{that he is}} [...] "against very wealthy people attempting to or influencing elections. But as long as it's doable I'm going to do it. Because I know that guys like Soros {{have been doing it}} for years, if not decades. And they stay below the radar by creating a network of corporations to funnel their money. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> philosophy and I'm not ashamed of it. I gave the money because there is no other legal way to do it. I don't want to go through ten different corporations to hide my name. I'm proud of what I do and I'm not looking to escape recognition." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked whether}} the members {{consider}} Believer a [...] "Christian band" [...] Daub replies {{in an interview with}} Metal Covenant in 2009: [...] "Well, yes, and no... this is a difficult subject to approach for us. Ever since we formed Believer, Kurt Bachman and myself despised being limited to a certain belief or style of music. We did not like to be labeled or numbered. Whether it was our personal spiritual journey, or the type of music we played. We were called thrash, death metal, technical death metal etc. The key focus for us then and now is to just encourage people to think for themselves." [...] Daub comments about the lyrics that [...] "We always wrote about what was near and dear to our heart. On Extraction, we used Bible based themes and stories to express our intentions, but {{we did not want to}} preach." [...] "Well we never wanted to be known as a Christian band for one [...] It was one of these things where it got out of control. With promoting records it was one of those things where the record company was like “Hey, here’s a slant. Something different. [...] Something new and unique. Let’s go for that”. I’ve always tried to stay away from labeling the band. For me it’s a band, it’s entertainment. We even get called death metal some times even though I don’t think we resemble anything death metal-ish out there, but then again <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> opinions on what death metal is. We just don’t want it to be one of those things where someone’s like “oh I hate thrash music, so I won’t like Believer”. You get labeled and we’re going to have to go through labels but we’re not really comfortable with any." [...] says Bachman in an interview on MetalSucks.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{never have}} had," [...] Jack said; [...] "it {{has been the}} best thing that ever {{happened}} to me. If <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> way <b>I</b> should still be working before the mast instead of being a captain in the army." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I'm {{not much}} use to her, don't you know--at least not HERE. But I might, if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> land {{and if we}} were neighbors. I told you SHE runs the place, no matter who's here, or whose money is invested." ...|$|R
