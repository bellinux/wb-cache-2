5|$|Biogeography (an {{amalgamation}} {{of biology}} and geography) is the {{comparative study of}} the geographic distribution of organisms and the corresponding evolution of their traits <b>in</b> <b>space</b> <b>and</b> time. The Journal of Biogeography was established in 1974. Biogeography and ecology share many of their disciplinary roots. For example, the theory of island biogeography, published by the Robert MacArthur and Edward O. Wilson in 1967 {{is considered one of}} the fundamentals of ecological theory.|$|E

5|$|Mir was {{constructed}} between 1986 and 1996 {{and was the}} world's first modular space station. It was the first consistently inhabited long-term research station <b>in</b> <b>space,</b> <b>and</b> previously held the record for longest continuous human presence in space, at eight days short of ten years. Mir's purpose {{was to provide a}} large and habitable scientific laboratory <b>in</b> <b>space,</b> <b>and,</b> through a number of collaborations, including Intercosmos and Shuttle-Mir, was made internationally accessible to cosmonauts and astronauts of many different countries. The station existed until March 23, 2001, at which point it was deliberately deorbited, and broke apart during atmospheric re-entry.|$|E
5|$|The North Carolinas {{also did}} not have {{sufficient}} space to act as fleet flagships, so the lead ship of the new class was designed with an extra deck on the conning tower specifically for this purpose, although the increase <b>in</b> <b>space</b> <b>and</b> weight from this necessitated removal of two twin 5-in DP mounts.|$|E

5|$|The {{application}} {{of quantum mechanics}} to physical objects such as the electromagnetic field, which are extended <b>in</b> <b>space</b> <b>and</b> time, is known as quantum field theory.

5|$|To be most {{effective}} at controlling a pest, a biological control agent requires a colonizing ability which allows it {{to keep pace with}} changes to the habitat <b>in</b> <b>space</b> <b>and</b> time.

5|$|Weber listed several {{preconditions}} for {{the emergence}} of the bureaucracy: The growth <b>in</b> <b>space</b> <b>and</b> population being administered, the growth in complexity of the administrative tasks being carried out and the existence of a monetary economy– these resulted in a need for a more efficient administrative system. Development of communication and transportation technologies made more efficient administration possible (and popularly requested) and democratisation and rationalisation of culture resulted in demands that the new system treat everybody equally.|$|E

5|$|A {{conservative}} {{force that}} acts on a closed system has an associated mechanical work that allows energy to convert only between kinetic or potential forms. This means {{that for a}} closed system, the net mechanical energy is conserved whenever a conservative force acts on the system. The force, therefore, is related directly to the difference in potential energy between two different locations <b>in</b> <b>space,</b> <b>and</b> can {{be considered to be}} an artifact of the potential field {{in the same way that}} the direction and amount of a flow of water can be considered to be an artifact of the contour map of the elevation of an area.|$|E
5|$|Although the BBC has {{invested}} in the reconstruction of episodes using animation, it has never attempted to do anything {{in the way of}} complete re-staging of missing episodes; the closest that it has come to this was the recreation of parts of various serials, including the completely missing Marco Polo, in the docudrama An Adventure <b>in</b> <b>Space</b> <b>and</b> Time produced for the 50th anniversary in 2013.

5|$|An {{electric}} field generally varies <b>in</b> <b>space,</b> <b>and</b> its strength {{at any one}} point {{is defined as the}} force (per unit charge) that would be felt by a stationary, negligible charge if placed at that point. The conceptual charge, termed a 'test charge', must be vanishingly small to prevent its own {{electric field}} disturbing the main field and must also be stationary to prevent the effect of magnetic fields. As the electric field is defined in terms of force, and force is a vector, so it follows that an electric field is also a vector, having both magnitude and direction. Specifically, it is a vector field.|$|E
50|$|Linear algebra {{explains}} how a vector space {{can be given}} a basis, and then any vector <b>in</b> the vector <b>space</b> can be expressed in this basis.

5|$|Beginning in 1958, {{outer space}} {{has been the}} subject of {{multiple}} resolutions by the United Nations General Assembly. Of these, more than 50 have been concerning the international co-operation in the peaceful uses of outer space and preventing an arms race in space. Four additional space law treaties have been negotiated and drafted by the UN's Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space. Still, there remains no legal prohibition against deploying conventional weapons <b>in</b> <b>space,</b> <b>and</b> anti-satellite weapons have been successfully tested by the US, USSR and China. The 1979 Moon Treaty turned the jurisdiction of all heavenly bodies (including the orbits around such bodies) over to the international community.

5|$|For illustration, if a {{physical}} system behaves the same, {{regardless of how}} it is oriented in space, the physical laws that govern it are rotationally symmetric; from this symmetry, Noether's theorem shows the angular momentum of the system must be conserved. The physical system itself need not be symmetric; a jagged asteroid tumbling in space conserves angular momentum despite its asymmetry. Rather, the symmetry of the physical laws governing the system {{is responsible for the}} conservation law. As another example, if {{a physical}} experiment has the same outcome at any place and at any time, then its laws are symmetric under continuous translations <b>in</b> <b>space</b> <b>and</b> time; by Noether's theorem, these symmetries account for the conservation laws of linear momentum and energy within this system, respectively.|$|E
