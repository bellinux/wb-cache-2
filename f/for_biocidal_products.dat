30|$|Earlier in 2012 the European Parliament and the EU Council of Ministers {{adopted the}} new {{regulation}} (EU) No 528 / 2012 on the authorization of biocidal products (BPR)[1]. It will apply from 1 September 2013 and will replace and repeal the BPD and will implement a new EU-wide, harmonized {{system for the}} authorization <b>for</b> <b>biocidal</b> <b>products.</b> This system will be applied for low-risk biocidal products and products that have similar use conditions throughout the EU. All other biocidal products are expected to still be subject to authorization by the individual member states. The BPR provisions will also apply to existing active substances being evaluated under the BPD review program.|$|E
30|$|The EU Council and Parliament {{recently}} {{agreed on}} a new regulation that will implement a new EU-wide, harmonized system for the authorization <b>for</b> <b>biocidal</b> <b>products.</b> Such products are in most cases multi-component mixtures {{of one or more}} active substances plus a range of co-formulants that serve different purposes, e.g. as stabilizers or preservatives. They are only allowed on the European market if their intended use does not lead to unacceptable risks for the environment. Consequently, the assessment of possible combination effects is a critically important step during the regulatory environmental risk assessment of biocidal products. However, no specific guidance is at hand on how combination effects should be accounted for during the regulatory environmental risk assessment of biocidal products.|$|E
30|$|The {{advantages}} of a centralised and decentralised authorisation procedure are discussed <b>for</b> <b>biocidal</b> <b>products</b> in special product types. Furthermore we stipulate that biocidal active substances which are nano particles are treated as separate active substances with own identities. Due to animal welfare reasons it should be obligatory to share data from vertebrate animal studies as it is already mandatory under the REACH regulation. The import of articles treated with biocidal active substances into the European market should only be allowed, if the active substance is approved for their biocidal use within the EU. Finally we suggest to implement an obligation to report the market shares or consumption rates of biocidal active substances and products.|$|E
40|$|In this report, the EU {{legislation}} regulating antifouling {{measures for}} leisure {{boats in the}} Baltic Sea will be presented with particular focus on authorisation of antifouling biocides and on determining {{the extent of the}} Member States’ autonomy in other antifouling related matters. The report outlines the important provisions of applicable legislation in both the regulations concerning harmonization of the authorisation of chemicals and the directives targeting the environmental concerns of the water bodies in the Union. The <b>Biocidal</b> <b>Products</b> Regulation provides the basis <b>for</b> all <b>biocidal</b> <b>products</b> authorisation, including procedural provisions and requirements for approval of active substances and authorisation of <b>biocidal</b> <b>products,</b> while the Water Framework Directive and the Marine Strategy Framework Directive regulate the marine environment and provide specific environmental quality standards and measures that must be considered in the authorisation process. Provisions in both the <b>Biocidal</b> <b>Products</b> Regulation and the regulation in combination with the water policy directives provide the possibility to impose conditions or restrictions on antifouling biocides based on local environmental conditions, but the environmental concerns must be weighed against the objective of harmonization of the internal market. The particular sensitivity and unique environmental quality of the Baltic Sea constitutes aspects that can and must be taken into consideration in the authorisation process. The water quality directives put further antifouling related obligations on the Member States, which they may achieve through various regulations and actions determined at a national level...|$|R
30|$|The applied test {{procedure}} {{is based on}} the NT build 509 [13] procedure that was released for testing of preservative-treated timber by the Nordic Innovation Centre. The procedure became the basis for harmonization within CEN, resulting in the Technical Report CEN/TR 16663 : 2014 [14] that also refers to preservative-treated wood. The basic principle of this procedure was tested for treated articles that contain other <b>biocidal</b> <b>products</b> than wood preservatives (PT 8, as defined in the BPR) during the research project and proved to be suitable for coatings that include film preservatives (PT 7) and a textile including a PT 9 product (fibre, leather, rubber and polymerized materials preservative). Therefore, a guidance document [15] was prepared and adopted by European competent authorities together with guidance on a laboratory method [16] <b>for</b> testing of <b>biocidal</b> <b>products</b> that belong to PT 7, PT 9 and PT 10 (construction material preservatives).|$|R

Currently, these tasks are dealt with by the biocides group within the IHCP. From 2013, coinciding with the coming-into-force of a new <b>Biocidal</b> <b>Products</b> Regulation (BPR), the European Chemicals Agency ECHA will take over the biocides' program.|$|R

30|$|Biocidal {{products}} are mixtures {{of one or}} more active substances (a.s.) and various intentionally added substances serving a broad range of functions in the formulated product. The authorization of biocidal products in the European Union (EU) is regulated by the Biocidal Product Regulation (BPR) [12], and further specified in guidance documents prepared by the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) in consultation with the EU member states. For the environmental risk assessment (ERA) of biocidal products, the BPR requests considering cumulative and synergistic effects. The methodology to fulfil this requirement is described in the transitional guidance document on mixture toxicity assessment <b>for</b> <b>biocidal</b> <b>products</b> for the environment [13], which is currently available from the ECHA website. In the near future, it will be incorporated into the BPR guidance structure, namely Volume IV Part B and C Guidance, which will then replace this transitional guidance document.|$|E
30|$|Criteria for the {{assessment}} of chemical properties and toxicological and environmental behavior of industrial chemicals in general, and particularly <b>for</b> <b>biocidal</b> <b>products,</b> plant protection products, and veterinary medicines are summarized in specific European legislations, [1 – 3] and guidelines [4 – 6], respectively. For {{the assessment}} of PBT properties under REACH, there are guidance documents available [7 – 9], which provide principles on the assessment of NERs. However, currently, there is no detailed description of the extraction techniques to differentiate NER types available. As there is no unified guidance available for the differentiation of different NER types in the general regulatory context, here, an approach is suggested based on a thorough review of the current scientific state of the art. Our paper is based on an extensive discussion paper on the interpretation of non-extractable residues in degradation assessment, which we would like to present to a wider audience [10].|$|E
30|$|CA and IA both {{link the}} {{toxicity}} of individual components (active ingredients, substances of concern, co-formulants) {{to the overall}} toxicity of the <b>biocidal</b> <b>product.</b> The major advantage of such methods is their easy adaptability to different exposure situations, e.g. when the chemical composition of a <b>biocidal</b> <b>product</b> changes. They substantially decrease the biotest demands of new <b>biocidal</b> <b>products</b> if they use known active ingredients and/or co-formulants. Similar to the direct testing of a <b>biocidal</b> <b>product</b> <b>for</b> its long-term effects, also the modeling of long-term effects in the environment depends on a sound and complete definition of the underlying exposure scenario.|$|R
30|$|<b>Biocidal</b> <b>products</b> can be {{sources of}} active {{substances}} in surface waters caused by weathering of treated articles. Marketing {{and use of}} <b>biocidal</b> <b>products</b> can be limited according to the European <b>Biocidal</b> <b>Products</b> Regulation if unacceptable risks to the environment are expected. Leaching of active substances from treated articles was observed in field experiments to obtain information on leaching processes and investigate the suitability of a proposed test method.|$|R
50|$|Humans may {{be exposed}} to <b>biocidal</b> <b>products</b> in {{different}} ways in both occupational and domestic settings. Many <b>biocidal</b> <b>products</b> are intended <b>for</b> industrial sectors or professional uses only, whereas other <b>biocidal</b> <b>products</b> are commonly available for private use by non-professional users. In addition, potential exposure of non-users of <b>biocidal</b> <b>products</b> (i.e. the general public) may occur indirectly via the environment, for example through drinking water, the food chain, {{as well as through}} atmospheric and residential exposure. Particular attention should be paid to the exposure of vulnerable sub-populations, such as the elderly, pregnant women, and children. Also pets and other domestic animals can be exposed indirectly following the application of <b>biocidal</b> <b>products.</b> Furthermore, exposure to biocides may vary in terms of route (inhalation, dermal contact, and ingestion) and pathway (food, drinking water, residential, occupational) of exposure, level, frequency and duration.|$|R

However, no specific guidance is at hand on how combination effects should be accounted for during the regulatory environmental risk assessment of biocidal products. Results and Conclusions A tiered approach was developed that accommodates different data situations, optimizes resource usage, limits biotesting as far as possible and ensures adequate protection of the environment. It mainly builds on using Concentration Addition as a component‐based approach for mixture toxicity prediction, complemented by whole product tests where appropriate. Concentration Addition is either approximated by summing up PEC/PNEC ratios or as sums of toxic units. The competing concept of Independent Action was assessed as not being suitable for incorporation into a tiered approach without explicit confirmatory studies, as it might otherwise lead to an underestimation of the actual environmental risk.

30|$|The {{substitution}} {{principle is}} a new element of the legislation on plant protection products (PPPs) in the European Union (EU). It was introduced with the new Regulation (EC) No 1107 / 2009 [[1]], in the following shortly denoted as the PPP Regulation. This replaced the old Directive 91 / 414 /EEC on PPPs [[2]] in June 2011. In parallel, the substitution principle was {{also included in the}} new Regulation (EU) No 528 / 2012 on biocidal products [[3]], which came into force in September 2013. PPPs and biocidal products are collectively denoted as ‘pesticides’ under EU law, as has been defined in Article 3 of Directive 2009 / 128 /EC on the sustainable use of pesticides in the European Community (EC) [[4]]. As a common rule, pesticides shall not be placed on the market or used unless they have been authorised in accordance with the applicable regulations. In general, ‘substitution’ of pesticides means that an authorisation is refused or withdrawn in favour of an alternative product or a non-chemical control or prevention method which presents a ‘significantly lower risk’, according to Annex IV of the PPP Regulation (EC) No 1107 / 2009 and Article 23 of the biocidal products Regulation (EU) No 528 / 2012, respectively. In detail, the conditions, rules, and criteria for applying the substitution principle differ for PPPs and <b>for</b> <b>biocidal</b> <b>products.</b> In this paper, we focus on substitution under the Regulation for PPPs.|$|E
30|$|Marketing {{and use of}} <b>biocidal</b> <b>products</b> can {{be limited}} {{according}} to the European <b>Biocidal</b> <b>Products</b> Regulation (BPR) [7] if unacceptable risks to the environment are expected.

50|$|When {{discussing}} biocides {{a distinction}} {{should be made}} between the biocidal active substance and the <b>biocidal</b> <b>product.</b> The <b>biocidal</b> active substances are mostly chemical compounds, but can also be microorganisms (e.g. bacteria). <b>Biocidal</b> <b>products</b> contain one or more biocidal active substances and may contain other non-active co-formulants that ensure the effectiveness {{as well as the}} desired pH, viscosity, colour, odour, etc. of the final <b>product.</b> <b>Biocidal</b> <b>products</b> are available on the market for use by professional and/or non-professional consumers.|$|R
3000|$|The fully {{operational}} 7900 HT Fast Real-Time PCR system has already yielded with results although its overall scientific output {{is only to}} be expected through activities of LECOTOX in ongoing and future research projects. Knowledge, new methods and know-how gained via trainings in partner institutions were transferred to LECOTOX and incorporated into individual research activities of young researchers {{in the form of}} MSc and PhD theses (completed and those in progress) and peer reviewed publications in scientific journals. Equally important, modern EDA and sediment TRIAD approach, new equipment, techniques, expertise and newly introduced in vivo and in vitro toxicity tests have already been applied directly into MSc and PhD level education at the Department of Biology and Ecology. Intensive networking with partnering institutions and individual researchers facilitated, in the first place, highly professional organisation of two workshops of outstanding scientific performance, while the workshops themselves were used not only for getting acquainted with state-of-the-art techniques in ecotoxicogenomics and risk assessment, but for further networking and scientific exchange. Besides its scientific and educational goals, the upgraded and strengthened LECOTOX will have an important task in the future, as well as the capability and capacity to offer its expertise and advice to policy and decision makers as well as to various stakeholders. One of such examples certainly is a project [...] "Chemicals Risk Management in Serbia", funded by the Republic of Serbia, Ministry of Environment and Spatial Planning and Swedish Chemical Agency.

50|$|<b>Biocidal</b> <b>products</b> {{and active}} {{substances}} fall into four categories and twenty-three product-types {{that are all}} regulated by the EU under the <b>Biocidal</b> <b>Products</b> Directive. The substances have to be authorized before being used or sold on the EU market. Also, all treated products shall only contain authorized active substances. To be authorized, manufacturers or importers need to submit technical documentation on the products. The European Commission created and regularly updates the <b>Biocidal</b> <b>Products</b> Directive to ensure {{a high level of}} protection of human and animal health, as well as environmental protection.|$|R
3000|$|<b>Biocidal</b> <b>products</b> {{are usually}} multi-component {{mixtures}} {{of one or}} more active substances plus a range of co-formulants that serve different purposes, as stabilizers, coloring agents, emulsifiers, solvents, diluents, etc. Additionally, metabolites and degradation products might be formed during and after use of a <b>biocidal</b> <b>product.</b> The overall ecotoxicity of a <b>biocidal</b> <b>product</b> might hence be significantly different from that of each individual ingredient(s) and therefore needs to be assessed during the product authorization phase. In fact, article 19 (2) of the BPR states that “the evaluation […] shall take into account the following factors: […] cumulative effects, synergistic effects.” [...] "Cumulative effects" [...] {{in the context of the}} BPR relate to effects from the same compound, emitted from different products, while [...] "synergistic effects" [...] relate to the joint action of different chemicals from one product. This is further elaborated in Annex VI (common principles for the evaluation of <b>biocidal</b> <b>products)</b> which states that the risks associated with the relevant individual components of the <b>biocidal</b> <b>product</b> shall be assessed, taking into account cumulative and synergistic effects.|$|R

In case of multiple data for the same end point or a toxicity estimate given as a concentration range, the lowest value was used. With regard to aquatic toxicity, median effect concentrations (EC 50) for invertebrates (Daphnia magna, 48  h EC 50 immobility), fish (various species, 96  h LC 50 mortality), and green algae (various species, 72  h EC 50 growth rate) were compiled. If data for the preferred end point were not available, other end points were taken as surrogate such as inhibition of yield in algae, effects in other algal species, immobilization of other crustacean species, EC 50 for longer or shorter exposure times, and no observed effect concentrations (NOEC). In addition, information on ready biodegradability as defined in guidelines OECD 301 and OECD 310 was compiled for the additives. No quality assessment of the compiled data and no literature search to extend these data available within regulatory processes were performed. Data were compiled for the additives in the base formulations, i.e. pigments were not considered.|$|R
