5|$|This {{remains the}} only nine-inning major league game where the teams {{combined}} for just one hit. The game's only run, scored by the Dodgers, was unearned. The Dodger run was scored without a recorded at bat—Lou Johnson walked, reached second on a sacrifice bunt, stole third, and scored when the throw to <b>get</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> at third went wild.|$|E
5|$|The prison {{became known}} {{around the world}} in the 19th century through the writing of the English novelist Charles Dickens, whose father was sent there in 1824, when Dickens was 12, for a debt to a baker. Forced as a result to leave school to work in a factory, Dickens based several of his {{characters}} on his experience, most notably Amy Dorrit, whose father is in the Marshalsea for debts so complex no one can fathom how to <b>get</b> <b>him</b> <b>out.</b>|$|E

5|$|Bilbo Baggins, the titular protagonist, is a respectable, {{reserved}} hobbit. During his adventure, Bilbo often {{refers to}} {{the contents of his}} larder at home and wishes he had more food. Until he finds a magic ring, he is more baggage than help. Gandalf, an itinerant wizard, introduces Bilbo to a company of thirteen dwarves. During the journey the wizard disappears on side errands dimly hinted at, only to appear again at key moments in the story. Thorin Oakenshield, the proud, pompous head of the company of dwarves and heir to the destroyed dwarvish kingdom under the Lonely Mountain, makes many mistakes in his leadership, relying on Gandalf and Bilbo to <b>get</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> of trouble, but he proves himself a mighty warrior. Smaug is a dragon who long ago pillaged the dwarvish kingdom of Thorin's grandfather and sleeps upon the vast treasure.|$|E
5|$|In September 1929, Wessel met Erna Jänicke, a 23-year-old ex-prostitute, in {{a tavern}} {{not far from}} Alexanderplatz. Some sources claim Wessel earned money as Jänicke's procurer. On 1 November she moved into his room {{on the third floor}} of 62 Große Frankfurter Straße (today Karl-Marx-Allee), which he sub-let from 29-year old Elisabeth Salm, whose late husband had been an active Communist Red Freedom Fighter, {{although}} she described herself as apolitical. After a few months, there was a dispute between Salm and Wessel over unpaid rent; Salm wanted Jänicke to leave, but she refused to, and Salm appealed to Communist friends of her late husband for help on the evening of 14 January 1930. At first the Communists were not interested in helping her, as she was not well-liked by them because of her refusal to allow the KPD to give her husband the standard burial rite used for members of the Red Freedom Fighters League, but when they realised that Horst Wessel was involved, they agreed to give Wessel a beating and <b>get</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> of Salm's flat by force.|$|E
5|$|Headley's {{success for}} Dudley was watched keenly in Jamaica and {{commentators}} began {{to discuss his}} availability for the 1954 series against England. A public subscription to finance his travel to Jamaica, opened by the Daily Gleaner, raised over £1,000, and despite his reservations, Headley returned to Jamaica. Playing in a fund-raising match, he sustained a hand injury and playing for the Combined Parishes in a minor match against the MCC, a short ball from Fred Trueman struck Headley's arm. The latter injury {{kept him out of}} the first-class match between Jamaica and the MCC, but he played in the second where, although hampered by his injury, he scored 53 not out. The Test selectors had seen enough to include Headley in the team for the first Test. Reaction among critics was mixed, and Headley, nearing his 45th birthday, remains the oldest man as of 2015 to play a Test match for West Indies. Headley batted at number six, and it appeared that England, under the captaincy of Len Hutton, let Headley score an easy run to begin his innings, which Hutton later confirmed to be the case. However, Headley later argued that the run was given to ensure that he was batting {{at the beginning of the}} next over, so that England could try to <b>get</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> before he settled down.|$|E

5|$|While {{this style}} {{facilitated}} his solid defensive play, it inhibited {{him as a}} stroke player and made him susceptible to hand and arm injuries. Such injuries would be common throughout his career. One such injury almost required {{the tip of a}} broken finger to be amputated. He was occasionally vulnerable to left-arm bowlers, either due to his inability to adjust his line of stroke or because during his career there were few fast left-hand bowlers for him to practise against in the nets. Boycott himself disputes this. In spite of that, he was never vulnerable to any one particular bowler. Pace bowler Dennis Lillee was the most successful against him in Test matches, with seven dismissals. Gary Sobers also dismissed him seven times, but Lillee did so in fewer matches. Peter Lever, a Test colleague, discussed with Boycott his vulnerability when playing the hook stroke, which was to <b>get</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> on more than one occasion. Overall in Test cricket, 54% of Boycott's dismissals were by being caught, with lbw and bowled taking 14% and 16% respectively. Boycott was an occasional medium-pace inswing bowler. He was never a genuine all-rounder, but took seven wickets at Test level at an average of 54.57, often bowling wearing his cap turned back-to-front to assist his vision.|$|E
5|$|Victor and Nikki finally remarry in March 2013 {{just before}} she is {{diagnosed}} with multiple sclerosis. At their wedding, an assassin attempts to shoot Victor, but Adam takes the bullet and nearly dies for his father. As a result, he offers Victor the position of co-CEO at Newman, and they begin working together. However, their partnership ends several months later when Victor discovers that Adam's silent partner used to take Newman private again was Jack. Victor fears that Adam and Jack have been scheming {{to take back the}} company for themselves without Victor. In retaliating, Victor, who now owns Chancellor Industries according to Katherine Chancellor's will, has all major Newman clients sign to Chancellor, as Victor leaves Newman worthless so he could build up Chancellor. Adam signs over his shares in Newman over to Victor, who plans to merge Chancellor Industries with Newman. Nikki then reveals she gave birth to another son decades earlier before she was with Victor, revealed to be Dylan McAvoy (Steve Burton). A subsidiary of the newly merged conglomerate, named Bonaventure Industries, later produced an illegal speed drug that Summer Newman (Hunter King) ended up overdosing on. Jack reported Victor to the FDA and he and his company were put under investigation. Dylan's supposed father and Nikki's former lover Ian Ward (Ray Wise) then arrives in town and causes pandemonium, to which Victor tries to <b>get</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> of town. It was later revealed that Victor had hired a lookalike to his granddaughter Cassie, named Mariah Copeland (Camryn Grimes), to haunt Sharon and learn a supposed secret she has. When his scheme is revealed, Nick and Sharon shun him and Nikki decides to move out for a while, but she and Victor later reunite. Victor and Nikki later learn that Ian is incapable of fathering children, leading to confusion. It is later revealed that Paul Williams (Doug Davidson), Nikki's ex-lover and longtime friend, is in fact Dylan's father, causing tension in Victor and Nikki's marriage, which continues when Victor goes to extensive lengths to awaken Phyllis (Gina Tognoni) from a coma in order to find out more information on Sharon's supposed secret. Nikki falls off the wagon and begins drinking again; she leaves Victor and refuses to take him back. Victor also sells Chancellor Industries back to Jill (Jess Walton), leaving the rest of the Newman family confused as to why he gave Chancellor up so easily.|$|E

25|$|The {{variations}} {{in different types}} of delivery, as well as variations caused by directing the ball with differing line and length, are key weapons in a bowler's arsenal.
