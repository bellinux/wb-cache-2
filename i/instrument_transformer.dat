40|$|Abstract. Electronic <b>instrument</b> <b>transformers</b> {{are used}} in power line for {{electrical}} measurement and protection purposes. Calibration instruments are necessary for the transformation error test of electronic <b>instrument</b> <b>transformers.</b> The operation principles of the direct and difference measurement method based calibration instrument for the medium-voltage electronic <b>instrument</b> <b>transformers</b> are systematically analyzed in this paper. The analysis {{results show that the}} direct measurement method based instrument can be used for the calibration of electronic <b>instrument</b> <b>transformers</b> with air-core coils or resistor-capacitor voltage divider without a built-in integrator, and the difference measurement method based instrument is suitable for the calibration of the electronic <b>instrument</b> <b>transformers</b> with no rated phase offset...|$|R
30|$|First, {{the data}} {{accuracy}} issue primarily derives from measurement equipment and devices, such as <b>instrument</b> <b>transformers</b> and PMUs. Conventional <b>instrument</b> <b>transformers</b> have inherent limitations on high-voltage measurement and isolation; while classic PMUs using discrete-Fourier-transform algorithms {{have a low}} computational burden but their accuracy degrades {{in the presence of}} frequency offsets and dynamic conditions. Accordingly, advanced <b>instrument</b> <b>transformers</b> like electronic <b>instrument</b> <b>transformers</b> [10, 11] and alternative PMUs using sophisticated measurement algorithms [12, 13, 14] have been developed. Those approaches greatly improve the synchrophasor measurement accuracy under both steady-state and dynamic conditions.|$|R

50|$|Current {{transformers}} (CT) are {{a series}} connected type of <b>instrument</b> <b>transformer.</b> They {{are designed to}} present negligible load to the supply being measured and have an accurate current ratio and phase relationship to enable accurate secondary connected metering.|$|E
50|$|Voltage {{transformers}} (VT), {{also called}} potential transformers (PT), are a parallel connected type of <b>instrument</b> <b>transformer.</b> They {{are designed to}} present negligible load to the supply being measured and have an accurate voltage ratio and phase relationship to enable accurate secondary connected metering.|$|E
50|$|Despite {{the modest}} growth, Arteche {{completed}} several milestones during this period, {{such as the}} production of its own Auxiliary Relays (1976), <b>Instrument</b> <b>Transformers</b> up to 765 kV (1981) and Electronic <b>Instrument</b> <b>Transformers</b> (1990). During these years, Arteche also had its first implantation in South America (1976) and North America (1993).|$|R
50|$|Arteche divides its {{operations}} into three Business Units: <b>Instrument</b> <b>Transformers,</b> Power Grid and Turnkey Solutions.|$|R
50|$|Accuracy: Power system {{voltages}} and currents are accurately reproduced by <b>instrument</b> <b>transformers</b> {{over large}} operating ranges.|$|R
50|$|A current {{transformer}} (CT) {{is a type}} of transformer that is used to measure AC Current. It produces an alternating current (AC) in its secondary which is proportional to the AC current in its primary. Current transformers, together with voltage transformers (VTs) or potential transformers (PTs), which are designed for measurement, are known as an <b>Instrument</b> <b>transformer.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{combined}} <b>instrument</b> <b>transformer</b> encloses {{a current}} transformer and a voltage transformer {{in the same}} transformer. There are two main combined current and voltage transformer designs: oil-paper insulated and SF6 insulated. One advantage of applying this solution is reduced substation footprint, due to reduced number of transformers in a bay, supporting structures and connections as well as lower costs for civil works, transportation and installation.|$|E
50|$|The {{instrument}} transformers with protective relays {{are used to}} sense the power-system voltage and current. They are physically connected to power-system apparatus and convert the actual power-system signals. The transducers convert the analog output of an <b>instrument</b> <b>transformer</b> from one magnitude to another or from one value type to another, such as from an ac current to dc voltage. Also the input data is taken from the auxiliary contacts of switch gears and power-system control equipment.|$|E

50|$|<b>Instrument</b> <b>transformers</b> {{are high}} {{accuracy}} class electrical devices used to isolate or transform voltage or current levels. The most common usage of <b>instrument</b> <b>transformers</b> is to operate instruments or metering from high voltage or high current circuits, safely isolating secondary control circuitry {{from the high}} voltages or currents. The primary winding of the transformer {{is connected to the}} high voltage or high current circuit, and the meter or relay is connected to the secondary circuit.|$|R
40|$|A {{power system}} {{protection}} system consists, at least, of an instrument trans- former, a protective device (relay), and a circuit breaker. Conventional <b>instrument</b> <b>transformers</b> bring currents and voltages from power network levels to much lower scaled-down replicas {{that serve as}} input signals to protective relays. The relay's function is to measure input signals (or a relationship among them in some cases) and compare them to defined operating characteristic thresholds (relay settings) to quickly decide whether to operate associated circuit breaker(s). Existing protection systems within a substation {{are based on a}} hardwired interface between <b>instrument</b> <b>transformers</b> and protective relays. Recent development of electronic <b>instrument</b> <b>transformers</b> and the spread of digital relays allow the development of an all-digital protection system, in which the traditional analog interface has been replaced with a digital signal connected to digital relays through a digital communication link (process bus). Due to their design, conventional <b>instrument</b> <b>transformers</b> introduce distortions to the current and voltage signal replicas. These distortions may cause protective relays to misoperate. On the other hand, non-conventional <b>instrument</b> <b>transformers</b> promise distortion-free replicas, which, in turn, should translate into better relay performance. Replacing hardwired signals with a communication bus also reduces the significant cost associated with copper wiring. An all-digital system should provide compatibility and interoperability so that different electronic <b>instrument</b> <b>transformers</b> can be connected to different digital relays (under a multi-vendor connection) Since the novel all-digital system has never been implemented and/or tested in practice so far, its superior performance needs to be evaluated. This thesis proposes a methodology for performance and compatibility evaluation of an all-digital protection system through application testing. The approach defines the performance indices and compatibility indices as well as the evaluation methodology...|$|R
50|$|Voltage {{transformers}} (VT), {{also called}} potential transformers (PT), are a parallel connected type of <b>instrument</b> <b>transformer,</b> used for metering and protection in high-voltage circuits or phasor phase shift isolation. They {{are designed to}} present negligible load to the supply being measured and to have an accurate voltage ratio to enable accurate metering. A potential transformer may have several secondary windings on the same core as a primary winding, for use in different metering or protection circuits. The primary may be connected phase to ground or phase to phase. The secondary is usually grounded on one terminal.|$|E

The FEM- 3 D results are basis for further optimal CCVIT design from metrological aspect by using the stochastic method-genetic algorithm introduced in the original program as an <b>instrument</b> <b>transformer</b> design tool. The objective function during the optimization process is a combination of the CCVIT metrological parameters. Higher accuracy class will be achieved with the CCVIT optimal solution.

40|$|Accurate {{measurement}} of power and energy {{is important in the}} electrical power system. The {{measurement of}} voltages above 1 kV and currents above 100 A is made through <b>instrument</b> <b>transformers.</b> Lately new types of <b>instrument</b> <b>transformers</b> with digital outputs have reached the market.
