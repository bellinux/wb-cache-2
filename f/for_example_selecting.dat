25|$|Some tabs, called Contextual Tabs, appear {{only when}} certain objects are selected. Contextual Tabs expose {{functionality}} specific {{only to the}} object with focus. <b>For</b> <b>example,</b> <b>selecting</b> a picture brings up the Pictures tab, which presents options {{for dealing with the}} picture. Similarly, focusing on a table exposes table-related options in a specific tab. Contextual Tabs remain hidden except when an applicable object is selected.|$|E
25|$|Because {{they are}} {{relatively}} easy to measure, the wing-tip trajectories have been reported more frequently. <b>For</b> <b>example,</b> <b>selecting</b> only flight sequences that produced enough lift to support a weight, will show that the wing tip follows an elliptical shape. Noncrossing shapes were also reported for other insects. Regardless of their exact shapes, the plugging-down motion indicates that insects may use aerodynamic drag in addition to lift to support its weight.|$|E
25|$|LucasArts' {{previous}} graphic adventure, Sam & Max Hit the Road (1993), {{introduced a}} new inventory and interaction system to replace those of their prior games, which had taken up the lower third of the player's screen. Full Throttle continued to refine on the changes introduced in Sam & Max Hit the Road: Objects or characters with which Ben can interact are indicated by a red square appearing around the cursor's crosshairs when the cursor is placed over the object. When this occurs, holding down the left mouse button causes a contextual pie menu {{to appear in the}} shape of the emblem of Ben's biker gang: a flaming circle topped by a skull and flanked by a boot and a gloved hand. The player hovers the cursor over elements of the emblem and then releases the mouse button to attempt various interactions with the object; <b>for</b> <b>example,</b> <b>selecting</b> the skull's mouth to speak to a character, its eyes to examine an object, or the hand to pick up, use, or pull the object. Right-clicking anywhere on the screen brings up the player's inventory of collected objects, which can be examined or dragged and dropped in order to use them with other items in the inventory or with objects or characters in the scene. These gameplay features would be further developed for The Curse of Monkey Island (1997).|$|E

2500|$|The {{original}} partition scheme {{described by}} C.A.R. Hoare uses two indices that {{start at the}} ends of the array being partitioned, then move toward each other, until they detect an inversion: a pair of elements, one {{greater than or equal to}} the pivot, one lesser or equal, that are in the wrong order relative to each other. The inverted elements are then swapped. When the indices meet, the algorithm stops and returns the final index. There are many variants of this algorithm, <b>for</b> <b>example,</b> <b>selecting</b> pivot from A instead of A. Hoare's scheme is more efficient than Lomuto's partition scheme because it does three times fewer swaps on average, and it creates efficient partitions even when all values are equal. Like Lomuto's partition scheme, Hoare partitioning also causes Quicksort to degrade to [...] when the input array is already sorted; it also doesn't produce a stable sort. Note that in this scheme, the pivot's final location is not necessarily at the index that was returned, and the next two segments that the main algorithm recurs on are [...] and [...] as opposed to [...] and [...] as in Lomuto's scheme. However, the partitioning algorithm guarantees [...] which implies both resulting partitions are non-empty, hence there's no risk of infinite recursion. In pseudocode, ...|$|E

5000|$|When {{the data}} are symmetrically {{distributed}} around the mean while the frequency of occurrence of data {{farther away from the}} mean diminishes, one may <b>for</b> <b>example</b> <b>select</b> the normal distribution, the logistic distribution, or the Student's t-distribution. The first two are very similar, while the last, with one degree of freedom, has [...] "heavier tails" [...] meaning that the values farther away from the mean occur relatively more often (i.e. the kurtosis is higher). The Cauchy distribution is also symmetric.|$|R
50|$|When {{the larger}} values {{tend to be}} {{farther away from the}} mean than the smaller values, one has a skew {{distribution}} to the right (i.e. there is positive skewness), one may <b>for</b> <b>example</b> <b>select</b> the log-normal distribution (i.e. the log values of the data are normally distributed), the log-logistic distribution (i.e. the log values of the data follow a logistic distribution), the Gumbel distribution, the exponential distribution, the Pareto distribution, the Weibull distribution, or the Fréchet distribution. The last three distributions are bounded to the left.|$|R

50|$|There {{is no one}} {{rate that}} is {{superior}} to others in any general sense. The rate to be selected depends on the question being asked - and often also on what data are available. What is important is to specify exactly what rate is measured and how {{it relates to the}} problem being addressed. Some agencies concentrate on crashes per total vehicle distance traveled. Others combine rates. The U.S. state of Iowa, <b>for</b> <b>example,</b> <b>selects</b> high collision locations based on a combination of crashes per million miles traveled, crashes per mile per year, and value loss (crash severity).|$|R

50|$|Battles in Suikoden III {{take place}} on a {{continuous}} field of battle, unlike the static front and back rows of earlier Suikodens. Characters are still aligned in rows {{at the onset of}} battle, but the front and back character in each row are controlled as a pair. <b>For</b> <b>example,</b> <b>selecting</b> to cast a rune spell with the character in the back row of the pair will cause the character in the front row to defend them while they are casting. On the other hand, choosing to attack will cause a character in the front row to move towards the enemy and strike.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to aggregating multiple storage locations, Libraries enable Arrangement Views and Search Filter Suggestions.

50|$|Biopanning {{involves}} 4 major {{steps for}} peptide selection. The {{first step is}} to have phage display libraries prepared. This involves inserting foreign desired gene segments into a region of the bacteriophage genome, so that the peptide product will be displayed {{on the surface of the}} bacteriophage virion. The most often used are genes pIII or pVIII of bacteriophage M13. The next step is the capturing step. It involves conjugating the phage library to the desired target. This procedure is termed panning. It utilizes the binding interactions so that only specific peptides presented by bacteriophage are bound to the target. <b>For</b> <b>example,</b> <b>selecting</b> antibody presented by bacteriophage with coated antigen in microtiter plates.|$|E
5000|$|A {{system can}} be {{described}} in terms of its expected, desired or intended behavior (usually, for artificial systems, its purpose). Events or inputs to the system are expected to generate specific results or outputs. (<b>For</b> <b>example,</b> <b>selecting</b> the [...] "print" [...] option from various computer applications is intended to result in a hardcopy emerging from some specific device). Any unexpected or undesirable behavior is a symptom. Troubleshooting is the process of isolating the specific cause or causes of the symptom. Frequently the symptom is a failure of the product or process to produce any results. (Nothing was printed, for example). Corrective action can then be taken to prevent further failures of a similar kind.|$|E
5000|$|In {{contemporary}} German, {{the term}} “Kapellmeister” {{has become less}} common {{in favor of the}} term [...] (“conductor”). When used today, however, it designates the director or chief conductor of an orchestra or choir. It suggests involvement in orchestra or choir policy (<b>for</b> <b>example,</b> <b>selecting</b> repertoire, concert schedules, choosing guest conductors and so on) as well as conducting. In military settings it refers to a bandmaster. The music director of the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra traditionally holds the old-fashioned title [...] In other German opera houses, the term generally refers to a deputy conductor reporting to the [...] ("General Music Director", usually also the chief conductor).

50|$|Log-based: Some DAM systems {{analyze and}} extract the {{information}} from the transaction logs (e.g., the redo logs).

These systems are a hybrid between a true DAM system (that is fully independent from the DBMS) and a SIEM which relies on data generated by the database. These architectures usually imply more overhead on the database server.|$|R
