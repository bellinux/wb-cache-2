50|$|Manually powered carts {{are also}} {{available}} specifically designed for use by wheelchair users. A still to be implemented aid {{for people with disabilities}} is the addition of a <b>guide</b> <b>wheel</b> at the center of rotation of a cart with four caster wheels. In order to allow the nesting of carts to be unhindered this <b>guide</b> <b>wheel</b> is attached {{to the front of the}} cart with a piece of spring steel which bends under the cart's weight.|$|E
30|$|<b>Guide</b> <b>wheels</b> {{and steady}} wheels are {{connected}} to the end support arms of the framework through spindles around the horizontal direction. Rubber springs are set between the spindles of the <b>guide</b> <b>wheels,</b> steady wheels and support arms. By adjusting the pre-compression amount of the springs, the pre-pressure between the <b>guide</b> <b>wheels</b> or steady wheels and the track beam can then be adjusted.|$|R
50|$|The {{base of the}} {{spinning}} tunnel holds the <b>guide</b> <b>wheels</b> that the tunnel rings rest and roll on. The drive motor for the tunnel that has the drive motor driving the <b>guide</b> <b>wheels</b> will also be installed on this framework. The tunnels that have a drive motor above the tunnel will have a vertical framework that {{is attached to the}} base. The <b>guide</b> <b>wheels</b> can be bicycle rims or pulleys which also hold the tunnel in place as it spins. Tunnels that use the hard rubber wheels will have an extra set of horizontal wheels at both ends, attached to the bridge, to keep the tunnel from wandering off the <b>guide</b> <b>wheels.</b> The bridge is also mounted to the base.|$|R
5000|$|On kerb-guided buses (KGB) small <b>guide</b> <b>wheels</b> {{attached}} to the bus engage vertical kerbs {{on either side of}} the guideway. These <b>guide</b> <b>wheels</b> push the steering mechanism of the bus, keeping it centralised on the track. Away from the guideway, the bus is steered in the normal way. The start of the guideway is funnelled from a wide track to guideway width. This system permits high-speed operation on a narrow guideway and precise positioning at boarding platforms, facilitating access for the elderly and disabled. As <b>guide</b> <b>wheels</b> can be inexpensively {{attached to}}, and removed from, almost any standard model of bus, kerb guided busway systems are not tied to particular specialised vehicles or equipment suppliers. Characteristically, operators contracted to run services on kerb-guided busways will purchase or lease the vehicles themselves; as second-hand vehicles (with <b>guide</b> <b>wheels</b> removed) have a ready resale market.|$|R

50|$|Where {{snowfall}} is an issue, {{this system}} {{may not be}} practical: since the guide rail forms the return leg of the electrical circuit, accumulation of ice and snow on the rail could cause intermittent power interruptions to the vehicle. Also, as the vehicle does not place {{a significant portion of}} its weight on the <b>guide</b> <b>wheel</b> (most of it being supported by the rubber tyres), snow packed into the flangeways or atop the rail by road traffic could lift the <b>guide</b> <b>wheel</b> off the rail, leading the vehicle to go off course.|$|E
5000|$|First-generation pulleys with dual guides had {{problems}} with snow becoming compacted and trapped in the pulley (up to complete inoperability in some cases). Second generation (one <b>guide,</b> <b>wheel</b> side) and third generation (center guide) improve upon the design.|$|E
30|$|The {{calculation}} formula of the flexibility coefficient {{of this new}} monorail vehicle was deduced, with related flexibility coefficients obtained. When all the <b>guide</b> <b>wheels</b> are in contact with steady wheels at the same time, the flexibility coefficient is 0.284. When steady wheels {{on one side and}} <b>guide</b> <b>wheels</b> on the opposite side leave the track surface, the flexibility coefficient is 0.651.|$|R

50|$|In {{order to}} {{activate}} the retarder in the mechanical gears 2 to 4, the reverse gear brake, is closed. As a result, the turbine wheel is accelerated by a correspondingly high ratio and driven in 1st gear against the rotary direction. The turbine wheel now acts as an axial pump which delivers oil against the <b>guide</b> <b>wheel</b> and the braked or stationary impeller.During this process, kinetic energy is converted into heat which is dissipated by the heat exchanger.The vehicle is braked.|$|E
50|$|The {{driving gear}} is a {{rotating}} rod spring-loaded 7-roll drive. It consists of five wheels, a <b>guide</b> <b>wheel</b> {{at the rear}} and the front drive wheel. Support rollers are not necessary because of the taut and relatively light chain. In off-road driving, the driver must be careful to keep the chain tension constant. Even with a failed torsion bar the M548 is still roadworthy. The power of the motor drives the transfer gearcase, generator and the cooling of the differential/steering gear. The transfer gearcase {{can be used as}} a separating clutch when towing the vehicle and serves to reduce the motor's speed. The power transmission between the drive follows the torque converter with an automatic lock-up clutch.|$|E
5000|$|The Schuco Varianto wire-track {{system was}} {{introduced}} in 1951. The company's advertisements stated, [...] "The automatic traffic game featuring {{a new kind of}} wire track never seen before." [...] The clockwork or battery-operated cars had a <b>guide</b> <b>wheel</b> on the underside that set within coiled wire tracks. The tracks could be arranged in various configurations of the owner's own design. Different plastic pieces could be linked with the wire track to create intersections and overpasses. The Varianto system was sold for fifteen years and was immensely popular as a much cheaper alternative to electric train sets, having similar features and limited in layout only by the owner's imagination (Keus No Date; Schuco Varianto 2011).|$|E

5000|$|A mid-1960s variant was the 155mm XM123 & M123A1 auxiliary-propelled howitzers. The XM123 was {{produced}} by American Machine and Foundry and outfitted with two 20 horsepower air-cooled engines produced by Consolidated Diesel Corporation, driverâ€™s seat, steering wheel, and <b>guide</b> <b>wheel</b> on the left trail, allowing it to be more rapidly emplaced when detached from the prime mover, while the XM123A1 provided a single 20 horsepower motor with electric steering. The extra weight on the left trail displaced the howitzer after each round was fired requiring it to be realigned and the project was abandoned. The concept was copied from the Soviet 85mm SD-44 auxiliary-propelled antitank gun developed in 1954 and used by airborne forces.(See also similar XM124E2 Light Auxiliary Propelled 105mm Howitzer with similar configuration) ...|$|E
50|$|A major {{incident}} on the Six Flags Great America version of Demon occurred on Saturday, April 18, 1998. Twenty-three riders were left stranded upside-down after the black train {{came to an}} unexpected halt {{in the middle of}} one of the vertical loops. Firefighters used a cherry picker to bring the passengers to safety. Some riders were stuck for nearly three hours. Three passengers were taken to local hospitals out of precaution but released that afternoon. Investigators concluded that the incident was caused by mechanical failure. A <b>guide</b> <b>wheel</b> that runs along the inside of the track separated from the axle of the last car. A mechanical safety system built into the wheel assembly engaged, preventing the train from derailing. The roller coaster reopened shortly after the conclusion of the investigation.|$|E
50|$|During Starting, the proven DIWA {{power split}} {{principle}} comes into action. As {{soon as the}} vehicle begins to move, power is divided steplessly between the hydrodynamic and the mechanical transmission of torque. In 1st gear, the DIWA range, input clutch and turbine brake are closed. The engine torque is directly transmitted to the outer rim of the differential. The impeller and the pump shaft is driven in opposite rotary directions via the planetary gears of the differential. During this process, the output and hence the planetary carrier remain stationary.In the converter, oil delivered by the impeller flows through the <b>guide</b> <b>wheel</b> to the turbine wheel in a closed circuit. The torque that is delivered and converted, that is increased, is transmitted to the planetary carrier via the sun gear of the turbine gear. The planetary gear shaft transmits both the torque of the input differential, that is the purely mechanical share, and the torque of the turbine gear, that is the hydrodynamic share, directly to the transmission output.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{force of}} tower crane is {{extremely}} complex when climbing, and climbing frame {{is the key}} to structure loaded by forces of climbing working condition, which supports all loads of {{the upper part of the}} tower crane when climbing. The guide wheels are arranged on climbing frame, and play the guiding role between climbing frame and tower body. The <b>guide</b> <b>wheel</b> pressure can reflect the upper horizontal loads and unbalanced moment, and climbing press reflects the upper vertical loads. This article is based on the climbing press and <b>guide</b> <b>wheel</b> pressure to analyze loads state of the upper part of the tower crane when climbing, ensure the upper load values in a safe range when the tower crane climbing...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} {{establish}} a reference guide for decision makers seeking to determine an appropriate precision docking technology to be used along a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) line utilizing low-floor buses. It uses statistics and observations collected from industry experts, reports prepared on current systems and emerging technologies, and {{an investigation into the}} current literature. Five technologies were researched and separated into two categories, mechanical or electronic. The two electronic technologies are (1) magnetic guidance and (2) optical guidance. The three mechanical technologies are (1) the <b>guide</b> <b>wheel,</b> (2) the Kassel Kerb, and (3) the guide strip. A general overview and expected cost, performance, and general advantages and disadvantages of each technology is then given. After reviewing each technology, several supplemental technologies, primarily for use in conjunction with the mechanical technologies, are assessed for their use to help assist operators during precision docking. Finally, Appendix 2 addresses issues surrounding lug nut and fender flare protrusions and Appendix 3 presents system interoperability concerns, as both can cause of potential issues regardless of the technology utilized.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Guide</b> <b>wheel</b> {{crankshaft}} used in caterpillar tractor is analyzed under working condition. The crankshaft {{is made of}} 45 Cr steel. Since {{the work}} conditions of the crankshaft are complicated, three dimensional finite element model of the crankshaft is built for strength checking of the crankshaft. Appropriate boundary condition is applied. The {{results show that the}} maximal stress of the crankshaft is 728 MPa, which is less than the yield limit of 45 Cr steel (835 MPa). Therefore, the crankshaft can not be broken during the work of caterpillar tractor...|$|E
50|$|The Lartigue Monorail {{locomotives}} {{used on the}} Listowel and Ballybunion Railway were of 0-3-0 wheel arrangement, {{although they}} also required non-load-bearing <b>guide</b> <b>wheels.</b> These locomotives were built by the Hunslet Engine Company, Leeds in 1888.|$|R
3000|$|According to {{parameters}} {{listed in}} TableÂ  1, the flexibility coefficient {{of this new}} straddle-type monorail vehicle can be calculated based on Eq.Â  3. When all the <b>guide</b> <b>wheels</b> are {{in contact with the}} steady wheels at the same time, the flexibility coefficient is 0.284. When steady wheels on one side and <b>guide</b> <b>wheels</b> on the opposite side leave the track surface, the flexibility coefficient is 0.651. According to the definition of the flexibility coefficient, the greater the flexibility coefficient, the easier it is for the vehicle to capsize on the curves. Hence, to ensure a favorable anti-overturning capacity of the straddling monorail vehicles, a certain degree of preload pressure should be applied on the <b>guiding</b> or stabilizing <b>wheels</b> to guarantee a consistent contact between the wheels and track beam.

40|$|Several common {{elevator}} malfunctions {{were diagnosed}} with a least square support vector machine (LS-SVM). After acquiring vibration signals of various elevator functions, their energy characteristics and time domain indicators were extracted by theoretically analyzing the optimal wavelet packet, in order to construct a feature vector of malfunctions for identifying causes of the malfunctions as input of LS-SVM. Meanwhile, parameters about LS-SVM were optimized by K-fold cross validation (K-CV). After diagnosing deviated elevator guide rail, deviated shape of guide shoe, abnormal running of tractor, erroneous rope groove of traction sheave, deviated <b>guide</b> <b>wheel,</b> and tension of wire rope, the results suggested that the LS-SVM based on K-CV optimization was one of effective methods for diagnosing elevator malfunctions...|$|E
