5|$|Exercise is an {{activity}} that can facilitate or inhibit sleep quality; people who exercise experience better quality of sleep {{than those who do}} not, but exercising too late in the <b>day</b> <b>can</b> be activating and delay falling asleep. Increasing exposure to bright and natural light during the daytime and avoiding bright light in the hours before bedtime may help promote a sleep-wake schedule aligned with nature's daily light-dark cycle.|$|E
5|$|Predators such {{as other}} ants and the thorny devil lizard (Moloch horridus) {{predominantly}} feed on Ochetellus workers; {{the number of}} ants that a thorny devil can consume per minute is around 24 to 45. The total number of ants consumed in a <b>day</b> <b>can</b> {{be as many as}} 2,500 individuals, based on an examination of the lizard's stomach contents.|$|E
5|$|Although {{selenium}} is {{an essential}} trace element, it is toxic if taken in excess. Exceeding the Tolerable Upper Intake Level of 400 micrograms per <b>day</b> <b>can</b> lead to selenosis. This 400µg Tolerable Upper Intake Level is based primarily on a 1986 study of five Chinese patients who exhibited overt signs of selenosis and a follow up study on the same five people in 1992. The 1992 study actually found the maximum safe dietary Se intake to be approximately 800 micrograms per day (15 micrograms per kilogram body weight), but suggested 400 micrograms per day to avoid creating an imbalance of nutrients in the diet and to accord with data from other countries. In China, people who ingested corn grown in extremely selenium-rich stony coal (carbonaceous shale) have suffered from selenium toxicity. This coal was shown to have selenium content as high as 9.1%, the highest concentration in coal ever recorded.|$|E

5|$|Waste is {{delivered}} to the station by road, using up to 100 waste collection vehicles. Up to 2,800 tonnes of waste a week or as much as 1,000 tonnes of waste a <b>day,</b> <b>can</b> be delivered at the plant. A rail head was also built on the railway sidings adjacent to the site in 2009. This allows for waste to be {{delivered to the}} plant by rail, rather than just by road. This is more sustainable as it reduces the amount of traffic on local roads. In December 2011, {{it was announced that}} the rail head would be used to receive up 500,000 tonnes of residual waste per year from Merseyside via a rail waste transfer facility at Knowley Industrial Park, Kirby, in a contract worth £400million.|$|E
25|$|Not every {{possible}} combination of Tzolk'in and Haab' can occur. For Tzolk'in days Imix, Kimi, Chwen and Kib', the Haab' <b>day</b> <b>can</b> only be 4, 9, 14 or 19; for Ik', Manik', Eb' and Kab'an, the Haab' <b>day</b> <b>can</b> only be 0, 5, 10 or 15; for Akb'al', Lamat, B'en and Etz'nab', the Haab' <b>day</b> <b>can</b> only be 1, 6, 11 or 16; for K'an, Muluk, Ix and Kawak, the Haab' <b>day</b> <b>can</b> only be 2, 7, 12 or 17; and for Chikchan, Ok, Men and Ajaw, the Haab' <b>day</b> <b>can</b> only be 3, 8, 13 or 18.|$|E

25|$|Estimates {{claim that}} smokers cost the U.S. economy $97.6 {{billion a year}} in lost {{productivity}} and that an additional $96.7 billion is spent on public and private health care combined. This is over 1% of the gross domestic product. A male smoker in the United States that smokes more than one pack a <b>day</b> <b>can</b> expect an average increase of $19,000 just in medical expenses {{over the course of his}} lifetime. A U.S. female smoker that also smokes more than a pack a <b>day</b> <b>can</b> expect an average of $25,800 additional healthcare costs over her lifetime.|$|E
25|$|To help manage {{adherence}} in asthma patients, {{the most}} important factors in improving compliance included patient education, motivational interviewing, and setting goals of therapy.

25|$|In 2016 DNV GL, ExxonMobil {{and others}} {{approved}} calculations of saving $3/barrel of oil using a 6MW Hywind instead of traditional engines, driving two 2MW pumps injecting water into an offshore oil well.

25|$|Another {{trademark}} of Passions is its unusual {{handling of the}} passage of time. A single story <b>day</b> <b>can</b> take weeks of episodes to play out, with simple conversations sometimes taking days to complete on-screen.

25|$|If {{refrigerated}} {{or frozen}} without containment, chocolate can absorb enough moisture {{to cause a}} whitish discoloration, the result of fat or sugar crystals rising to the surface. Moving chocolate from one temperature extreme to another, such as from a refrigerator on a hot <b>day,</b> <b>can</b> result in an oily texture. Although visually unappealing, chocolate suffering from bloom is perfectly safe for consumption.|$|E
25|$|The American Dietetic Association said in 2009 that {{a variety}} of plant foods {{consumed}} {{over the course of a}} <b>day</b> <b>can</b> provide all the essential amino acids for healthy adults, which means that protein combining in the same meal may not be necessary. Mangels et al. write that there is little reason to advise vegans to increase their protein intake, but erring on the side of caution, they recommend a 25 percent increase over the RDA for adults, to 1.0gram of protein per kilogram of body weight.|$|E

30|$|For {{another level}} of abstraction, models of single <b>days</b> <b>can</b> be easily put {{together}} with their initial and final states to create {{a model for a}} longer period, for example, a week. For such purpose the transition probabilities from the initial state to particular <b>days</b> <b>can</b> be modified with respect to their position within the week. Hence, the first five models can omit the weekend part (and renormalize the rest), while the latter two could be modeled with only state 14 between initial and final connection state.|$|R

25|$|Modafinil (Provigil) is a {{stimulant}} {{approved in}} the US {{for treatment of}} shift-work sleep disorder, which shares some characteristics with DSPD. A number of clinicians prescribe it for DSPD patients, as it may improve a sleep-deprived patient's ability to function adequately during socially desirable hours. It is generally not recommended to take modafinil after noon; modafinil is a relatively long-acting drug with a half-life of 15 hours, and taking it during the later part of the <b>day</b> <b>can</b> {{make it harder to}} fall asleep at bedtime.|$|E
25|$|Calls are {{typically}} heard more frequently during the breeding season. However, {{the time of}} <b>day</b> <b>can</b> differ amongst species, as some are more vocal in the morning, others in the evening, and some are more vocal during the heat of midday. Some will call at night from their roosts. Frequency can vary between species and between individuals. One male brushland tinamou called every few minutes from dawn until dusk (over 500 calls daily). Some, in particular Crypturellus species, use regular call sites. Only a few possess an alarm call.|$|E
25|$|In Eastern Poland, as in {{many other}} Catholic countries, people {{celebrate}} name days (imieniny) on the day of their patron saint. On the other hand, in Western Poland, birthdays are more popular. Today, in Eastern Poland, birthdays remain relatively intimate celebrations, as often only relatives and close friends know a person's date of birth. Name days, on the other hand, are often celebrated together with co-workers and other less-intimate friends. Information about whose name is associated with a given <b>day</b> <b>can</b> be found in most Polish calendars and on the internet.|$|E
