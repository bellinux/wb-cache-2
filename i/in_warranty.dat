Also in 1995, Compaq sued Packard Bell for not disclosing that Packard Bell computers incorporated used parts. This practice was, in fact, widespread in the computer industry, including Compaq itself. However, unlike its rival companies, Packard Bell was judged not to have advertised the practice sufficiently <b>in</b> its <b>warranties</b> (Compaq, for instance, disclosed it <b>in</b> the <b>warranty</b> statement).|$|R

50|$|A {{hardware}} {{fault that}} has been reported frequently is that the earpiece speaker on the slider-screen will quit working due to a fragile connector.

50|$|On 3 November, Mr Pham Van Thoai, a Vietnamese tourist, paid S$950 for an iPhone 6 from Mobile Air. However, Mobile {{air staff}} {{refused to let}} Pham leave with the phone unless he paid an {{additional}} $1,500 <b>in</b> <b>warranty</b> fees. Pham had signed for an agreement, but failed to scrutinise it due to his lack of fluency in English. After {{the intervention of the}} police and CASE, Pham was refunded $400, but did not receive the iPhone, incurring a loss of $550. Pham said that his monthly earnings as a factory worker amounted to about $200. This case sparked nationwide sympathy and outrage in Singapore after the publishing of a photo of a tearful Pham and the online circulation of a video of him begging on his knees for a refund. The backlash resulted in the personal particulars and photos of Mobile Air owner Jover Chew being circulated online.|$|E
50|$|There {{appear to}} be design flaws with the OLED display or {{possibly}} with the firmware on the Pulse, Echo and Sky (WiFi) models. The OLED fades after one to three years, making the pen significantly more difficult to use because {{it is no longer}} possible to see if the pen is on or not and customers need to rely on the audio feedback alone. This fading issue is a known disadvantage of OLEDs and results in a limited lifespan. Users have complained to Livescribe, and the company's official response is to point users to tips on pen maintenance and then suggest that users buy a new pen at a deep discount as a replacement. Some users who received a replacement saw it plagued by the same problem. However, the company has taken advantage of ongoing improvements in OLED technology and, as of January 1, 2015, now offers a 3-year warranty on new smartpens (including the discounted replacements).The OLED issue has alienated some Livescribe users, especially with the high price tags of the accessories and of the smartpen itself.Once the OLED display fails:Many cellphone cameras can see the IR light emitted when the pen is on so using the camera to look {{at the front of the}} pen and depressing the ink cartridge is one way of determining the operating status. Additionally, using the Volume Up/Down icons will cause a beep when the pen is on. Unfortunately, there is no way to determine if the pen is actually recording audio without the OLED indications thus rendering useless one of its primary functions. Livescribe offers free, fully warrantied replacements to customers who experience an issue with their OLED displays when their pen is <b>in</b> <b>warranty.</b> For US customers whose smartpens are out-of-warranty, the company offers replacement options that allow customers to purchase a fully warrantied replacement pen for a discounted price.|$|E
