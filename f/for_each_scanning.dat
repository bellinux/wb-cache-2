40|$|Positron {{emission}} tomography {{is so far}} the only method for in-vivo dose delivery verification in hadron therapy that is in clinical use. A PET scanner placed in the treatment position (in-situ) {{will be able to}} obtain the highest number of counts, as it minimizes the decay of the positron emitting nuclei before the scan is started as well as reduces the effect of biological washout. We investigated the influence of the scan protocol, i. e. the moment when a scan in done in relation to the treatment delivery, on the ability to measure unacceptable deviations from the treatment plan. We developed a Geant 4 -based Monte-Carlo framework for proton therapy simulations. Four patient cases are studied: two head-and-neck, one sarcoma near the spine, and one breast cancer case. For each irradiation field, the production of the following PET isotopes is calculated: 15 O, 11 C, 10 C, 14 O, 30 P, 38 K, and 13 N. The time sequence of the pencil beam scanning irradiation, the decay of the PET isotopes during the irradiation, and biological washout are included in the simulation. The production of these nuclei is then used to calculate a PET image for two scan protocols: a scan of 120 seconds after the first field, or a scan of 120 seconds after the last field. To mimic a typical scanner spatial resolution, the images are blurred using a Gaussian blurring function with 4 mm FWHM. Deviations from the treatment plan are simulated by shifting the patient 4 mm perpendicular to the field angle, or by increasing the patient density by 3 %. The PET image is then simulated again <b>for</b> <b>each</b> <b>scanning</b> protocol. The ability of each protocol to detect these deviations from the treatment plan is investigated by comparing the planned and the modified PET image. Several analysis methods are used: line profiles coupled to the field-directions, structural similarity index analysis [1], and gamma index analysis. [2] Preliminary data shows that a difference in density is best detected by starting the scan directly after the first field. However, shifts perpendicular to the field directions are better detected when the scan is done after the last field, due to the increased activity and counting-rate...|$|E
40|$|Background: Investigations using {{a hybrid}} single photon {{emission}} computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT-CT) scanning technique {{have been carried}} out in limited studies and have shown mixed results. However, the assessment of this technique for the detection of parathyroid adenoma in patients with a nodular goiter was performed in only one study with a small sample size. The aim of this prospective study was to assess the role of Tc-sestamibi parathyroid SPECT-CT scans for localization of parathyroid adenomas with a concomitant nodular goiter using Tc-methoxyisobutyl isonitrile (MIBI) scintigraphy and to compare it with SPECT and planar imaging. Methods: This study was conducted on 48 patients with primary hyperparathyroidism and nodular goiter, who were candidates for parathyroid surgery and had been referred for parathyroid scintigraphy. The patients underwent an early set of planar Tc-MIBI scanning procedures first, followed by SPECT and CT scannings, and finally a delayed set of planar Tc-MIBI scannings. Sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive values, and accuracy were determined on a per-parathyroid-gland basis <b>for</b> <b>each</b> <b>scanning</b> method, as defined by histology and follow-up. Results: The surgery was successful in 48 out of 50 patients with primary hyperparathyroidism concomitant with thyroid nodularity, and data were completed for 80 sites in 48 patients. The accuracy of SPECT-CT in correctly identifying a parathyroid adenoma was 85. 00, versus 75. 00 % for SPECT (P= 0. 01, significant). The sensitivity and specificity for SPECT-CT were 77. 55 and 96. 77 %, respectively, versus 67. 34 and 87. 09 %, respectively, for SPECT (P= 0. 12 and 0. 12, not significant). There were nine sites that showed better localization on SPECT-CT scans relative to SPECT images, of which five sites were located in the ectopic regions. Conclusion: The results of our study indicate that SPECT-CT is more accurate than sestamibi planar imaging and SPECT for the preoperative identification of parathyroid lesions in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism concomitant with thyroid nodularity. Also, we would recommend the use of SPECT-CT for a workup of all patients with ectopic glands who are scheduled for minimally invasive parathyroid surgery.

METHODS: A comparative examination was carried out with respect to the CT value of the intestinal tract wall in each scanning phase, the CT value of the content in the intestinal tract, and the CT value of ascites fluid in the portal vein phase for a group in which ischemia was observed (Group I) and a group in which ischemia was not observed (Group N) based on the pathological findings or intra-surgical findings. Moreover, a comparative examination was carried out in Group I subjects <b>for</b> <b>each</b> <b>scanning</b> phase with respect to average differences in the CT values of the intestinal tract wall where ischemia was suspected and in the intestinal tract wall in non-ischemic areas. RESULTS: There were 15 subjects in Group I and 30 subjects in Group N. The CT value of the intestinal tract wall was 41. 8 1; 11. 2 Hounsfield Unit (HU) in Group I and 69. 6 1; 18. 4 HU in Group N in the arterial phase, with the CT value of the ischemic bowel wall being significantly lower in Group I. In the portal vein phase, the CT value of the ischemic bowel wall was 60. 6 1; 14. 6 HU in Group I and 80. 7 1; 17. 7 HU in Group N, with the CT value of the ischemic bowel wall being significantly lower in Group I; however, no significant differences were observed in the equilibrium phase. The CT value of the solution in the intestine was 18. 6 1; 9. 5 HU in Group I and 10. 4 1; 5. 1 HU in Group N, being significantly higher in Group I. No significant differences were observed in the CT value of the accumulation of ascites fluid. The average difference in the CT values between the ischemic bowel wall and the non-ischemic bowel wall for each subject in Group I was 33. 7 1; 20. 1 HU in the arterial phase, being significantly larger compared to the other two phases.

In this research work, various subjects relevant to the process of digital mapping using digital photogrammetric work station were discussed. Theses subjects include: • Digital camera: The present alternative of the conventional camera and by which direct digital photogrammetric data can be acquired. • Scanners: Special precise photogrammetric scanners are used to transform hard copy images into a digital form. • Digital image processing: Image reduction and enlargement, image enhancement, edge sharpening, and so on, are now at the dispose of user’s fingertips using special softwares, rather than spending a long time in traditional manual manipulation. Two experiments were carried out in this research work, one in a mountainous area, and the other in a flat one. In the first test an aerial wide-angle hard copy stereopair at scale 1 : 40, 000 of mountainous terrain in Switzerland was transformed to a soft copy using a different scanning resolutions by a special photogrammetric scanner. A digital photogrammetric workstation was used to measure a number of control points of known ground coordinates. The root mean square error of the measured ground coordinates of these points and their actual coordinates were computed <b>for</b> <b>each</b> <b>scanning</b> resolution. ERDAS software package was used to digitally rectify the scanned images using the same pixel resolution used above. The coordinates of points were measured and the root mean square errors were computed again. The result of digital rectification is required to be supported by another test in a flat terrain. In this test an aerial wide-angle hard copy stereopair at 1 : 20, 000 scale of a flat terrain, in the center of Khartoum, was transformed to a soft copy and rectified. The results of these investigations proved that the accuracy of the measurements in digital photogrammetry is nonlinearly proportional to the scanning pixel resolution in both horizontal and vertical measurements. Mathematical models were developed to estimate the accuracy against scanning resolution and suitable plotting scales in both horizontal and vertical mapping. Production of maps using digital image rectification using software packages such as ERDAS is suitable only in a flat terrain. On the other hand, a digital photogrammetric workstation is a productive way for mapping in both flat and mountainous terrain...|$|E
