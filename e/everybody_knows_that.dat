She became so popular in Spain that she was voted for 13 times Best International Singer by the readers of the music magazine Heavy Rock in their annual polls. She often declared to live and tour for the fans and said that she [...] "would never cancel a tour and <b>everybody</b> <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> about me". Lemmy, in a 2003 interview, testified how nice and professional Doro is.|$|E
500|$|The family goes to Nifty Fifties Diner, a 1950s-themed restaurant, {{and they}} see waiters dressed up as celebrities from the 1950s, {{including}} James Dean, Marilyn Monroe and Elvis Presley. Peter obtains a record of his favorite song, The Trashmen's [...] "Surfin' Bird" [...] from the restaurant (which {{was about to be}} thrown away because it was released in 1963). Peter repeats the song over and over on the way home in bed and even when waking up Lois, annoying his family. However, the final straw of the family's hatred of Surfin' Bird is when Peter spends over $6,000 of the family fortune to buy himself a two-minute clip on TV saying that [...] "I dream of an America where <b>everybody</b> <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> the bird is the word" [...] and singing the song again.|$|E

500|$|Christensen {{believed}} that Odinism was the ideal {{tool for the}} advancement of Aryan racial consciousness, expressing her opinion that the Jewish-controlled establishment would not permit her to do it a more explicit way, stating that [...] "You cannot repeat the mistake that Hitler made ... <b>Everybody</b> <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> the Jews rule the whole damned world, so you cannot fight their combined power. You need to watch your step." [...] A number of The Odinists readers wrote letters to the magazine expressing disapproval of what they perceived as the editors' support of Nazism, to which Christensen publicly responded that such accusations were [...] "the cheapest of all shots that can be aimed against anyone who finds something positive to say about... National Socialism... or who merely desires some degree of objectivity in dealing with this grossly maligned movement." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Take Me Home" [...] was {{released}} by Polydor Records in the United Kingdom on August 13, 2001 and in the United States as an import. It {{was released}} as a legal digital download and an enhanced maxi CD single; both featured the Ellis-Bextor cover, B-side [...] "Sparkle" [...] and a Jewels & Stone remix, while the latter contained the song's music video for the song. The single was also pressed as an edition dubbed the [...] "Mixes & Remixes" [...] EP, released only in France. A 12-inch single was also pressed in the United Kingdom, with remixes. Two AllMusic writers reviewed the song. Upon its release as a single, Dean Carlson gave it a negative rating of {{one and a half}} star out of five, commenting: [...] " [...] Ellis Bextor is well aware of what's required for beating the likes of Victoria Beckham and Emma Bunton at their own gameâ€”simply take Cher's [...] "Take Me Home" [...] and add one disco beat circa ABBA's 'Fernando', being mindful to avoid its cocaine harmonies and the air of free love , techno-fy it with random fiddly bits, sing with the breathless detachment of someone getting a massage from a lumberjack, and chuck in some remixes just so <b>everybody</b> <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> you're not utterly out of step." [...] After its parent album's release, Kelvin Hayes denoted it as one of the album's strongest tracks, as did Toby Manning from Q. For Yahoo! Music, Gary Crossing wrote that the album [...] "start well with the song", while describing it as Spiller-esque. Betty Clarke of The Guardian regarded [...] "Take Me Home" [...] as a [...] "pleasant enough song", though she called the production and Ellis-Bextor's vocals [...] "more tired than sexy".|$|E
500|$|... "Everybody's Fool" [...] {{was written}} by Amy Lee, Ben Moody and David Hodges and {{produced}} by Dave Fortman. The Millennium Choir performed background vocals for the song. According to Lee, the song talks about celebrities who have completely false images. It has been misinterpreted as a message against Christian faith, due to the band's denial of being a Christian band. During an interview, Lee explained: [...] "My little sister was really getting into these, I don't want to offend anyone, but like really fake, cheesy, slutty female cracker-box idols, and it really pissed me off. She started dressing like them and she was like 8 years old. So I gave her the talk and I wrote a song." [...] She later revealed that the song was written for American pop singers Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera adding, [...] "At this point, <b>everybody</b> <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> Britney is fake. The song is not about Britney Spears; it's {{about a lot of}} people in this industry. It's so fake, the whole Hollywood thing. 'Look at how perfect I am!' Nobody looks like that. It's all fake and it's really hurting a lot of girls' and women's self images. Where are all the normal people?". According to the sheet music published by Alfred Music Publishing at the website Musicnotes.com, [...] "Everybody's Fool" [...] is written in the key of F major. It is set in a time signature of common time and performed in a tempo of 92 beats per minute. Lee's vocals in the song range from the note of A3 to the note of D5. After the third single from Fallen, [...] "My Immortal" [...] continued to grow successfully, Lee revealed that [...] "Imaginary" [...] would become the band's next and final single from the album stating, [...] "I think it's very epic. It's one of those big Aerosmith or Black Sabbath kind of songs. It's like an opus, with the choir and the rock and the programming. I love that song." [...] However, the release of [...] "Imaginary" [...] was scrapped and [...] "Everybody's Fool" [...] was released as the fourth single from Fallen on June 4, 2004, while a maxi single was released on April 28, 2004.|$|E
60|$|Then {{the crash}} came. Nobody {{outside the family}} knew exactly what did happen, but <b>{{everybody}}</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> the Holcomb-Farquhar match was off, and everybody had a different story to account for it.|$|R

[...] Max soon however has misgivings about his friend's new enthusiasms, having heard from eyewitnesses who had gotten out of Berlin that Jews were being beaten and their businesses boycotted.

Patricia Schroeder said, [...] "You can't amend the Constitution with a statute. <b>Everybody</b> <b>knows</b> <b>that.</b> This is just stirring the political waters and seeing what hate you can unleash."

6000|$|The next {{afternoon}} {{as the train}} approached Plainton, Mrs. Cliff found herself a great deal agitated as {{she thought of the}} platform at the station.

60|$|The new {{government}} was received with considerable coolness. It {{was not only}} a foreign intruder, but a poor one. It was not even worth plucking --except by the smallest of small fry office-seekers and such. <b>Everybody</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> Congress had appropriated only twenty thousand dollars a year in greenbacks for its support--about money enough to run a quartz mill a month. And <b>everybody</b> <b>knew,</b> also, <b>that</b> the first year's money was still in Washington, and that the getting hold of it would be a tedious and difficult process. Carson City was too wary and too wise to open up a credit account with the imported bantling with anything like indecent haste.|$|R

2500|$|In {{the phone}} call, SaccÃ  expresses words of impassioned {{political}} support to Berlusconi and criticises the behaviour of Berlusconi's allies. Berlusconi urges SaccÃ  to broadcast a telefilm series which was strongly advocated by his ally Umberto Bossi. SaccÃ  laments {{that many people}} have spread rumours on this agreement causing problems to him. Then Berlusconi asks SaccÃ  {{to find a job}} in RAI for a young woman explicitly telling him that this woman would serve as an asset in a secret exchange with a senator of the majority who would help him to cause Prodi, with his administration, to fall. After the publication of these wiretaps, Berlusconi has been accused by other politicians and by some journalists of political corruption through the exploitation of prostitution. Berlusconi said, in his own defence: [...] "In the entertainment world <b>everybody</b> <b>knows</b> <b>that,</b> in certain situations in RAI TV you work only if you prostitute yourself or if you are leftist. I have intervened on behalf of some personalities who are not leftists and have been completely set apart by RAI TV."
