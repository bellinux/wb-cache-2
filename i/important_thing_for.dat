Louis Vauxcelles in Gil Blas attacked them with a violence that was quite extraordinary. Younger critics who wrote columns in Comoedia, Excelsior, Action, and L'Oeuvre were more reserved, some of them even welcomed the Cubists with sympathy; in Paris-Journal, the free spirited poet André Salmon wrote an account of Room 41 that was full of intelligence and sympathy. The most <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> Gleizes was that the younger generation of critics had been won over by Cubism.|$|E
25|$|Protagoras {{states that}} he has two good pieces of {{evidence}} that people agree with him. First, people do not rebuke the ugly, dwarfish, and weak, but pity them, because they cannot help being as they are, yet they punish the unjust and generally feel as though someone is responsible for not knowing {{something that can be}} taught (323d). Second, they do instruct people who are unjust and irreligious, hoping to impart goodness in them. He says that parents begin with their children from earliest childhood, and teachers carry on the task. Protagoras notes that none of this is surprising, but what would be surprising is if this were not the case (326e). He closes by addressing Socrates' question why, if virtue is teachable, the sons of virtuous men often lack virtue. Protagoras lays out a thought experiment where a hypothetical city state is resting its survival as such to the skill of flute playing. Being the most <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> that society, parents would be eager to teach the skill to their sons. Not everyone would be successful though, as we can imagine, as some would have a greater natural inclination than others and often the son of a good flute player would turn out bad and vice versa. Any of them however, even the bad ones, would be better than an average citizen in the real world which might have never been taught how to play. Same goes for virtue, it is considered so important that everyone is taught to a certain degree, {{to the point that it}} seems like a part of human nature while it is not (327b–d).|$|E

25|$|Šarūnas {{started going}} to school in Jonas Jablonskis Middle School in 1982 and {{attended}} it till 1987. He {{had to take the}} bus to go to school even though the thermometer outside read minus twenty and he knew that the most <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> his parents was that he spent as little time as possible with the toughest people of Partizanai Street. From 1987 to 1993, he was studying at Kaunas 4th Middle School. His first trip destination was Moscow, which he visited before the tournament. Jasikevičius's greatest youth memory in the city was the opening of the first McDonald's in Russia. He remembers that his classmates were listening with their mouths gaping when he was narrating about the French fries, bread rolls with minced beef and fizzy drinks. One of his childhood passions was history, especially about the Native Americans, as well as books about basketball as he was capable of reading a book of more than four hundred pages on basketball in two days. He was also curious about politics, especially when Perestroika began, because of which he was able to travel to Berlin with his father and brother, and was amazed by the visit to the Checkpoint Charlie Museum. His childhood favorite Lithuanian player was Arvydas Sabonis, which he admired more than other Lithuanian superstars, such as Rimas Kurtinaitis and Valdemaras Chomičius, due to his passing. However, his idol was Dražen Petrović, and he wished {{to be as good as}} him, watching matches of him over and over again, dozens of times, for hours and hours, and later started imitating him in workouts. After one of his trips, his dad came back with a videocassette recorder, using which he was able to record an NBA All-Star Game with Michael Jordan, Clyde Drexler, Larry Bird, Magic Johnson, David Robinson, and later to watch it for couple of years, more than hundred times. Jasikevičius also started to record games of Žalgiris and Petrović every time he was able to. Thanks to the video recorder, he discovered the existence of a no-look pass of Magic Johnson. For him, he was the NBA, not Michael Jordan. His unselfishness, imagination and the way he dribbled, passed between his opponent's legs bewitched Jasikevičius. Consequently, his favorite element of basketball quickly became assisting his teammates, and he was trying to do it like Petrović or Johnson.|$|E

On 16 February 1993, Bergkamp agreed a £7.1million move to the latter club in a deal which included his Ajax teammate Wim Jonk. Upon signing, Bergkamp said Inter [...] "met all my demands.

40|$|Of {{the many}} {{challenges}} faced by people living with HIV, {{one of the most}} difficult is keep-ing up with important information about the medical management of the virus. New informa-tion about the science and treatment of HIV infection becomes available almost daily. Staying current with it can feel overwhelming. At The Center for AIDS, a non-profit organization that tries to prevent HIV infection from becoming HIV disease, it’s our job to keep on top of new developments. In fact, that’s most of what we do. We don’t provide social services, counseling, or financial assistance. Instead, we pour over medical journals, Internet sites, and other sources looking for information that can keep people with HIV alive and healthy. In early 2000, we produced the first edition of this pamphlet after asking our-selves a simple question: “If we knew only 25 things about the treatment of HIV infection, what would be the most <b>important</b> <b>things</b> <b>for</b> us to know? ” In 2011, when we decided to update the pamphlet, we put a twist on the question: “In the opinion of leading experts in the field, what would be the 25 most <b>important</b> <b>things</b> <b>for</b> us to know? ” Consequently, not only is all the informatio...|$|R

Paterson knew that the film had to be about friendship and imagination. While Paterson focused on [...] "bringing out the emotions of the story," [...] he admitted to having difficulty writing about Terabithia [...] "because it was too close". He credited fellow screenwriter Jeff Stockwell for recreating Terabithia for the film. [...] "What Jeff was able to do as an outsider who wasn't so attached to the story was to really let his imagination go free and make up this world in a wonderful way", David said. Csupó noted that the two main characters are a little bit older in the film than they are in the book.

2500|$|One {{advantage}} Rachmaninoff had in {{this building}} process over most of his contemporaries was in approaching the pieces he played {{from the perspective of}} a composer rather than that of an interpreter.

You can make contact with their imaginations, knowing something of their problems and their ideals. You can give their works color. That is the most <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> me in my interpretations, color. So you make music live. Without color it is dead." [...] Nevertheless, Rachmaninoff also possessed a far better sense of structure than many of his contemporaries, such as Hofmann, or the majority of pianists from the previous generation, judging from their respective recordings.|$|E
