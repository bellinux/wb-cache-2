6000|$|... "Hitherto I {{have gone}} on vague lines. We have to {{consider}} all that invisibility means, all {{that it does not}} mean. It means little advantage for eavesdropping and so forth--one makes sounds. It's of little help--a little help perhaps--in housebreaking and so forth. Once you've caught me you could easily imprison me. But on the other hand I am hard to catch. This invisibility, in fact, is only good in two cases: <b>It's</b> <b>useful</b> in getting away, <b>it's</b> <b>useful</b> in approaching. <b>It's</b> particularly <b>useful,</b> therefore, in killing. I can walk round a man, whatever weapon he has, choose my point, strike as I like. Dodge as I like. Escape as I like." ...|$|R
5|$|As a metal, {{titanium}} {{is recognized}} for its high strength-to-weight ratio. It {{is a strong}} metal with low density that is quite ductile (especially in an oxygen-free environment), lustrous, and metallic-white in color. The relatively high melting point (more than 1,650°C or 3,000°F) makes <b>it</b> <b>useful</b> as a refractory metal. It is paramagnetic and has fairly low electrical and thermal conductivity.|$|E
5|$|Mercury {{was used}} inside wobbler lures. Its heavy, liquid form made <b>it</b> <b>useful</b> since the lures made an {{attractive}} irregular movement when the mercury moved inside the plug. Such use was stopped due to environmental concerns, but illegal preparation of modern fishing plugs has occurred.|$|E
5|$|The high {{non-linearity}} of {{lithium niobate}} also makes <b>it</b> <b>useful</b> in non-linear optics applications. It is used extensively in telecommunication {{products such as}} mobile phones and optical modulators, for such components as resonant crystals. Lithium applications are used in more than 60% of mobile phones.|$|E

5|$|The low {{weight and}} high {{rigidity}} of beryllium make <b>it</b> <b>useful</b> as a material for high-frequency speaker drivers. Because beryllium is expensive (many {{times more than}} titanium), hard to shape due to its brittleness, and toxic if mishandled, beryllium tweeters are limited to high-end home, pro audio, and public address applications. Some high-fidelity products have been fraudulently claimed {{to be made of}} the material.|$|E
5|$|A {{widely used}} alloy which {{contains}} zinc is brass, in which copper is alloyed with anywhere from 3% to 45% zinc, {{depending upon the}} type of brass. Brass is generally more ductile and stronger than copper and has superior corrosion resistance. These properties make <b>it</b> <b>useful</b> in communication equipment, hardware, musical instruments, and water valves. Other widely used alloys that contain zinc include nickel silver, typewriter metal, soft and aluminium solder, and commercial bronze. Alloys of primarily zinc with small amounts of copper, aluminium, and magnesium are useful in die casting as well as spin casting, especially in the automotive, electrical, and hardware industries. These alloys are marketed under the name Zamak. Roughly one quarter of all zinc output, in the United States (2009), is consumed {{in the form of}} zinc compounds, a variety of which are used industrially.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the high}} blood {{solubility}} of methoxyflurane is often undesirable, this property makes <b>it</b> <b>useful</b> in certain situations—it persists in the lipid compartment {{of the body}} for a long time, providing sedation and analgesia well into the postoperative period. There is substantial data to indicate that methoxyflurane is an effective analgesic and sedative agent at subanesthetic doses. Supervised self-administration of methoxyflurane in children and adults can briefly lead to deep sedation, {{and it has been}} used as a patient controlled analgesic for painful procedures in children in hospital emergency departments. During childbirth, administration of methoxyflurane produces significantly better analgesia, less psychomotor agitation, and only slightly more somnolence than trichloroethylene.|$|E

5|$|At least 32 {{metastable}} isomers {{have been}} characterized, ranging in mass number from 164 to 197. The most stable {{of these is}} 192m2Ir, which decays by isomeric transition with a half-life of 241years, making it more stable than any of iridium's synthetic isotopes in their ground states. The least stable isomer is 190m3Ir with a half-life of only 2µs. The isotope 191Ir {{was the first one}} of any element to be shown to present a Mössbauer effect. This renders <b>it</b> <b>useful</b> for Mössbauer spectroscopy for research in physics, chemistry, biochemistry, metallurgy, and mineralogy.|$|E
5|$|Cowpea is {{susceptible}} to nematode, fungal, bacterial and virus diseases, which can result in substantial loss in yield. Common diseases include blights, root rot, wilt, powdery mildew, root knot, rust and leaf spot. The plant is {{susceptible to}} mosaic viruses, which cause a green mosaic pattern {{to appear in the}} leaves. The cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV), discovered in 1959, has become a useful research tool. CPMV is stable and easy to propagate to a high yield, making <b>it</b> <b>useful</b> in vector development and protein expression systems. One of the plant's defenses against some insect attacks is the cow pea trypsin inhibitor (CpTI). CpTI is the only gene obtained outside of B. thuringiensis that has been inserted into a commercially available genetically modified crop.|$|E
5|$|Emotion-oriented {{interventions}} include reminiscence therapy, validation therapy, supportive psychotherapy, sensory integration, {{also called}} snoezelen, and simulated presence therapy. A Cochrane review has {{found no evidence}} that this is effective. Supportive psychotherapy has received little or no formal scientific study, but some clinicians find <b>it</b> <b>useful</b> in helping mildly impaired people adjust to their illness. Reminiscence therapy (RT) involves the discussion of past experiences individually or in group, many times with the aid of photographs, household items, music and sound recordings, or other familiar items from the past. Although there are few quality studies on the effectiveness of RT, it may be beneficial for cognition and mood. Simulated presence therapy (SPT) is based on attachment theories and involves playing a recording with voices of the closest relatives of the person with Alzheimer's disease. There is partial evidence indicating that SPT may reduce challenging behaviours.|$|E

5|$|Lead {{is easily}} {{extracted}} from its ores; prehistoric people in Western Asia knew of it. Galena, a principal ore of lead, often bears silver, interest in which helped initiate widespread extraction {{and use of}} lead in ancient Rome. Lead production declined {{after the fall of}} Rome and did not reach comparable levels until the Industrial Revolution. In 2014, annual global production of lead was about ten million tonnes, over half of which was from recycling. Lead's high density, low melting point, ductility and relative inertness to oxidation make <b>it</b> <b>useful.</b> These properties, combined with its relative abundance and low cost, resulted in its extensive use in construction, plumbing, batteries, bullets and shot, weights, solders, pewters, fusible alloys, white paints, leaded gasoline, and radiation shielding.|$|E
5|$|On 9 January 2011, Bristol East MP Kerry McCarthy {{gave her}} {{support to the}} idea of a public DNA {{screening}} process if the police found <b>it</b> <b>useful.</b> The Avon and Somerset Constabulary had conducted mass DNA screening during the 1995 investigation into the disappearance of Louise Smith. McCarthy suggested that the screening process should be extended beyond Clifton to the wider Bristol area. DNA that had been found on Yeates' body was tested for a potential profile. Detectives also began tracking the movements of several hundred registered sex offenders living within their jurisdiction to determine the individuals' whereabouts on 17 December.|$|E
5|$|Roughly {{one quarter}} of all zinc output in the United States in 2009 was {{consumed}} in zinc compounds; a variety of which are used industrially.
