40|$|The overall {{return on}} {{investment}} (ROI) for single-use technology is enhanced {{by the fact that}} plants designed around it are typically less complex and can usually be built faster. As a result, a product can be brought to market and start generating revenues sooner. Alternatively, the reduced build-time for single-use based plants can be used to delay <b>finalisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>process</b> and plant design decisions, which typically must be made during Phase II trials – well before the process details are completely characterised. Another side-benefit of single-use cost savings is a reduction in the threshold for building manufacturing capacity. The lower capital and operational investment requirements of single-use technology allow biotech companies to establish their own manufacturing capabilities, rather than searching out manufacturing capacity from contract manufacturin...|$|R
40|$|Although empirically being {{a country}} of {{immigration}} right from the beginning, Germany {{for a long time}} had difficulties to accept immigration and integration as vital features of its history. This contribution aims at uncovering and explaining the complex divergence between empirical reality and self-description and argues that the roots of this gap {{are to be found in}} the German history of being an incomplete nation-state for a long time. As a consequence of the German partition and the emergence of large Diasporas in the East of Europe, Germany for a long time could not finally finish its nation-building project and thus was obliged to renounce the immigration and integration reality. The German reunification in 1990 und as a corollary the <b>finalisation</b> <b>of</b> the German nation-building project ended this period of self-renunciation. Consequently, normalisation processes started right after the <b>finalisation</b> <b>of</b> the nation-building <b>process</b> in the various realms of society. Two <b>of</b> these normalisation <b>processes,</b> politics and law, are explained in more detail. If somebody would be asked to summarise the relationship between Germany and immigration with one word, he/she probably best would use one word: “ambivalent”. The ambivalent relationship between Germany and its immigration experience can be best summarised with the sentence: “Germany is not {{a country of}} immigration. ” This formula is the centre point of the stubborn self-denial of Germany, a country which Dietrich Thränhard...|$|R

40|$|Workshop 3 Beyond competive tenderingDuring 2009, the Swedish Government {{is proposing}} to the Parliament {{that the last}} {{remaining}} monopoly of the national operator SJ – the commercial parts of rail passenger traffic – is removed in a step-wise process 2009 - 2010. This would introduce the possibility of on-the track competition for rail passenger services on {{all parts of the}} network. If so, it will mark the <b>finalisation</b> <b>of</b> a <b>process</b> that started in 1988 with the vertical separation of railway infrastructure from operations. The critical issue is how to legislate and regulate the new railway market that will emerge in 2010 - 2012. In this paper, we discuss the conditions for such a reform, looking at some critical issues such as the interface between subsidised (tendered) services and commercial services, the markets for rolling stock and vehicle maintenance, and the distribution of infrastructure capacity. The first aim of the paper is to recapitulate and analyze the increasing commitment to deregulation in the Swedish railway market. The second aim is to analyze the possible options that are at hand in dismantling SJ AB’s remaining monopoly rights to profitable railway lines in the inter-regional railway market and other potential sources of monopoly power. The third aim is to describe and analyze the transition from the multitude of market structures that exist today to an envisioned unified market structure after the reform. In addition, the sustainability of SJ’s financial performance in a changing market environment is reviewed, finding that the influence from general business cycles may be an important factor. The paper also includes an overview of the experience from the previous regulatory reforms and recent changes in the competitive environment and supporting industries.
