5|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{decides to}} motivate and inspire {{everyone}} by taking {{them on a}} field trip to Gettysburg. At Gettysburg, Andy is unhappy with the lack of morale and belief in his leadership and attempts to make an analogy between running a paper company and fighting in the Civil War. Andy starts to lead a haphazard tour, and eventually most of the office members sit down to rest. Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) and Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) follow Andy after <b>he</b> <b>presses</b> on, and eventually tell him to stop trying to impress the office. They reinforce the fact that his co-workers like him the way he is.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not clear}} what happens to the Rocket Group {{immediately}} after this: the next time Quatermass is seen on screen (Quatermass, also released internationally as The Quatermass Conclusion and Quatermass IV, 1979) he has long been retired, living in retreat in the Scottish Highlands. He has recently become the guardian of his teenaged granddaughter Hettie after her parents were killed in a road accident in Germany. After Hettie runs away from home, he travels to London in search of her and finds a dystopian world there. Quatermass and the scientist Joe Kapp establish that an alien probe is causing the collapse of society by feeding on the world's youth, and Quatermass forms a plan to drive the intruder away by the detonation of a nuclear bomb. <b>He</b> <b>presses</b> the button to detonate it himself, with Hettie's help, and they are killed in the blast as the planet is saved.|$|E
5|$|After {{fighting}} his {{way back}} to the top of the temple, Ryu encounters Bloody Malth, whom Ryu defeats. While dying, Malth reveals that he was the one who dueled with Ryu's father, that his father is still alive and that Ryu will meet him as <b>he</b> <b>presses</b> onward. When he reaches the temple's inner chambers, he discovers that his father was not killed but was instead possessed by an evil figure. He destroys the evil figure, which releases Ken from its hold. Jaquio, enraged from Ken's release from the possession, shows himself; he immediately tries to kill Ryu with a fiery projectile, but Ken throws himself in front of Ryu and takes the hit. Jaquio is killed during the ensuing fight by Ryu, but then a lunar eclipse occurs, causing the demon statues to transform into Jashin. After Ryu defeats the demon, Ken tells him he does not have much longer to live due to Jaquio's attack. He tells Ryu to leave him behind in the temple while it collapses and to take the young woman with him. Afterwards, Foster, communicating via satellite, orders the girl to kill Ryu and steal the demon statues; she chooses to be with Ryu instead of carrying out the order. The two kiss, and the girl tells Ryu her name, Irene Lew; the two watch as the sun rises.|$|E

50|$|Hepburn {{also became}} the first man in history to bench press 400, 450, and 500 pounds. He set a series of bench press world records in the early 1950s: In November 1950 <b>he</b> <b>pressed</b> 400 lbs (181.82 kg), in 1951 <b>he</b> <b>pressed</b> 450 lbs (204.55 kg), and finally 500 lbs (227.27 kg) in December 1953.|$|R

25|$|An {{offer of}} a draw should be made after a player makes a move but before <b>he</b> <b>presses</b> his game clock. The other player also declines the offer if he makes a move, and the draw offer {{will no longer be}} in effect.

25|$|Danforth and Hathorne have {{returned}} to Salem to meet with Parris, and are {{surprised to learn that}} Hale has returned and is meeting with the condemned. Parris, who has lost everything to Abigail, reports that he has received death threats. He begs Danforth to postpone the executions in order to secure confessions, hoping to avoid executing some of Salem's most well-regarded citizens. Hale, blaming himself for the hysteria, has returned to counsel the condemned to falsely confess and avoid execution. <b>He</b> <b>presses</b> Danforth to pardon the remaining seven and put the entire affair behind them. Danforth refuses, stating that pardons or postponement would cast doubt on the veracity of previous confessions, not to mention the hangings.|$|E
25|$|When Agnes Fletcher, a maid in Morley's apartment, {{admits to}} having seen Carter {{on the stairs}} going down to Morley's office, it seems that Carter {{is likely to be}} tried and convicted of both the murder and the {{attempted}} murder. The fact that the gun with which he was captured was the twin of the murder weapon only makes things worse for him. At the climax of the novel Poirot realises that by allowing Carter to persist in his lies he can ensure that the real killer goes free, and wrestles with his conscience. Eventually <b>he</b> <b>presses</b> Carter to admit the truth: that he had seen two people leave Morley's surgery, and that when he entered it the dentist was already dead. This is the final element in the puzzle.|$|E

500|$|Plagis {{shot down}} his first enemy {{aircraft}} on 25 March 1942, and on 1 April achieved four more aerial victories {{in a single}} afternoon, thereby becoming the Siege of Malta's first Spitfire ace. His downing of four enemies {{in a few hours}} won him much praise from superiors and reporters, and contributed to his growing reputation as an aggressive but skilful combat pilot. He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC) on 1 May 1942, the citation noting that he had [...] "destroyed 4 and probably destroyed a further 3 hostile aircraft". [...] "With complete indifference to odds against him, <b>he</b> <b>presses</b> home his attacks with skill and courage," [...] it continued—"He has set an outstanding example." ...|$|E
500|$|Plagis was {{promoted}} {{in the field}} to flight lieutenant on 4 June 1942 and transferred to No. 185 Squadron to command [...] "B" [...] Flight. He shot down two Re.2001s two days later to bring his tally of victories to ten (thereby fulfilling his pledge following Leggo's death), and destroyed a Bf 109 on 7 June. A month later, he received a Bar to his DFC, having been adjudged to have shown [...] "exceptional skill and gallantry in combat... Undeterred by superior numbers of attacking aircraft, <b>he</b> <b>presses</b> home his attacks with great determination." [...] Plagis left Malta when his tour expired on 7 July 1942, flying first to Gibraltar, then the UK. The British finally delivered vital supplies to Malta on 15 August with Operation Pedestal (known in Malta as the [...] "Santa Marija Convoy").|$|E
500|$|The {{young soldier}} is {{unaware of what}} is happening, at first – he asks why the bugles are blowing, and why the Sergeant looks so pale, but is told that Deever is being hanged, and that the {{regiment}} is drawn up in [...] "ollow square" [...] to see it. <b>He</b> <b>presses</b> the Sergeant further, in the second verse – why are people breathing so hard? why are some men collapsing? These signs of the effect that watching the hanging has upon {{the men of the}} regiment are explained away by the Sergeant as being due to the cold weather or the bright sun. The voice is reassuring, keeping the young soldier calm in the sight of death, just as the Sergeant will calm him with his voice in combat. In the third verse, Files thinks of Deever, saying that he slept alongside him, and drank with him, but the Sergeant reminds him that Deever is now alone, that he sleeps [...] "out an' far to-night", and reminds the soldier of the magnitude of Deever's crime – ...|$|E

500|$|During his journey, {{while waiting}} for a Mississippi steamboat, Uncle Tom first meets little Eva, who with her father is also taking the boat south. Tom is at once {{attracted}} to the beautiful little girl, and she in turn talks to the kindly old darkey. While looking at the boats, the little one accidentally falls into the swiftly flowing river and escapes drowning only through the bravery of Uncle Tom. He of all the crowd has the courage to jump in and rescue the little girl. Eva's father to reward Tom for his bravery, buys him from Legree, and once more Tom {{knows what it is}} to be treated kindly. He lives happily as little Eva's special bodyguard until the little one is seized with a sudden sickness and dies. She had become greatly attached to Uncle Tom, and the last act of her life was to present him with a little locket containing her picture. Once more Uncle Tom is sold and again falls into the hands of Simon Legree. He is taken to Legree's plantation in Mississippi, where he is overworked and ill-treated to the point of death. Just before he dies <b>he</b> <b>presses</b> to his lips the locket with the picture of his beloved little girl and in a vision sees her in the clouds holding out her arms to him that he, too, may enter with her the pearly gates, inside of which all souls are equal, and all free. The comedy of the story is furnished by little Eva's Aunt Ophelia, a queer old lawyer named Marx, and his stubborn donkey, to say nothing of Topsy, a wicked little colored girl, who Aunt Ophelia tries hard to convert." ...|$|E
2500|$|George bids {{his guests}} a good evening, then heads downstairs where his {{full-size}} time machine awaits. <b>He</b> <b>presses</b> a lever and moves forward through time 17 {{years into the}} future to the year 1917. He meets Filby's son, James, who tells him of Filby's death in the Great War. Saddened, he resumes his journey, stopping in 1940 during The Blitz, finding himself in the midst of [...] "a new war"; George resumes his journey and stops in 1966, finding his neighbourhood now part of a futuristic metropolis. People are hurrying into a nearby fallout shelter amid the blare of air raid sirens. An elderly James Filby urges George to immediately take cover. Moments later, a nuclear explosion causes a sudden volcanic eruption around him. George narrowly makes it back to his machine and continues his journey forward as the lava rapidly cools and hardens, trapping him inside. He travels much farther into the future until the rock eventually erodes away, revealing a lush, green, unspoiled landscape.|$|E
2500|$|Following {{his move}} to Atlético Madrid, Sky Sports analyst Adam Bate {{wrote that he}} was the perfect fit for manager Diego Simeone's style as Mandžukić is 'often the {{instigator}} of the press with his energetic running, Mandzukic battles defences, driving them back to create space for teammates as well as preventing opponents building patiently without pressure on the ball.' Bate further added that the Croatian 'is both a physical and mobile striker who does so much of his best work without the ball, seemingly doing the work of two players and thus allowing an extra man in midfield.' ESPN FC contributor Michael Cox has also praised Mandžukić for his excellent team-work, highlighting that while <b>he</b> <b>presses</b> his opponents energetically when they attempt to play the ball out from the back, he is also extremely diligent and disciplined {{in the manner in which}} he drops back into his own half to defend behind the ball if his opponents manage to bypass his team's pressing. In 2014, Aleksandar Holiga commented on Mandžukić's playing, stating that [...] "e stretches the defences with constant movement and seemingly endless stamina, opening space for others to come from behind or cut inside from the wing; his pressing on the ball has proven decisive on a number of previous occasions and he is, of course, one of the best strikers in the world when it comes to aerial power. So even if he does not score himself, his presence could be key for the team’s chances.|$|E

Greenlee demands that Jack not tell anyone, especially Ryan, that she is alive. On Valentine's Day, David walks {{down the aisle and}} is joined by his heavily veiled bride, whose face is obscured. Just as Jack, Erica and Ryan walk in, Greenlee reveals herself as the bride. Greenlee's sudden [...] "return from the dead" [...] sends shock waves through the assembled guests, who soon take their leave with the exception of Ryan (but not before everyone tells Greenlee it is a dumb idea to marry David). Ryan's speechless over Greenlee's intention to marry David, let alone on Valentine's Day of all days. Ryan tells Greenlee he never stopped loving her and is dismayed she kept her survival a secret from him. Greenlee defends David, insisting {{he is the one who}} is going to take care of her now. Despite her insistence that Ryan stay away, it is obvious that she still cares for him. Annie crashes the now non-wedding and is stunned to see Greenlee. Ryan lets Greenlee go but remains confident they will get back together one day.
