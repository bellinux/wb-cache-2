5|$|In North Carolina, Virginia, and Maryland, {{rainfall}} {{was generally}} light, {{with the exception}} of a few areas receiving over 3inches (75mm). Henri produced greater amounts of rain in Delaware and Pennsylvania, with a peak of 9.02in (229mm) in Hockessin. In Downingtown, Pennsylvania, over eightinches (203mm) of rain fell in around sixhours, while Doppler Radar estimated that Kennett Square received over 10inches (255mm) in a five-hour period. The heavy rainfall led to record <b>discharge</b> <b>rates</b> along the Red Clay Creek, which also had a record crest peaking at just below 26feet (8m). Parts of the creek saw a 500-year flood, which has a 0.2% chance of occurring in any given year. Numerous rivers in southeastern Pennsylvania also crested above their flood stage.|$|E

Isolated locations in Texas, northern Oklahoma, and southeastern Kansas received over 10inches (25.4cm) of precipitation, and the highest total in the United States was 11.35inches (28.8cm) at Fort Scott, Kansas. Moderate rainfall extended northeastward through Missouri and Illinois. In Barnsdall, Oklahoma, a station recorded 10.42inches (26.5cm) on September 29, which was the highest daily precipitation for any station in the state. In combination with previous storms, some locations received over 20inches of rainfall in an 8-day period, which produced severe river flooding along the Osage and Arkansas Rivers. The flooding resulted in record <b>discharge</b> <b>rates</b> along many streams and creeks, while many reservoirs were nearly filled to capacity.

25|$|The UltraBattery is {{a hybrid}} {{rechargeable}} lead-acid battery and a supercapacitor invented by Australia's national science organisation CSIRO. Its cell construction contains a standard lead-acid battery positive electrode, standard sulphuric acid electrolyte and a specially prepared negative carbon-based electrode that store electrical energy with double-layer capacitance. The presence of the supercapacitor electrode alters the chemistry of the battery and affords it significant protection from sulfation in high rate partial state if charge use, which is the typical failure mode of valve regulated lead-acid cells used this way. The resulting cell performs with characteristics beyond either a lead-acid cell or a supercapacitor, with charge and <b>discharge</b> <b>rates,</b> cycle life, efficiency and performance all enhanced. UltraBattery has been installed in kW and MW scale applications in Australia, Japan and the U.S.A. in frequency regulation, solar smoothing and shifting, wind smoothing and other applications.|$|E

40|$|It is {{difficult}} to predict the heating time and power consumption associated with the self-heating process of lithium-ion batteries at low temperatures. A temperature-rise model considering the dynamic changes in battery temperature and state of charge is thus proposed. When this model is combined with the ampere-hour integral method, the quantitative relationship among the <b>discharge</b> <b>rate,</b> heating time, and power consumption, during the constant-current discharge process in an internally self-heating battery, is realized. Results show that the temperature-rise model can accurately reflect actual changes in battery temperature. The {{results indicate that the}} <b>discharge</b> <b>rate</b> and the heating time present an exponential decreasing trend that is similar to the <b>discharge</b> <b>rate</b> and the power consumption. When a 2 C <b>discharge</b> <b>rate</b> is selected, the battery temperature can rise from − 10 °C to 5 °C in 280 s. In this scenario, power consumption of the heating process does not exceed 15 % of the rated capacity. As the <b>discharge</b> <b>rate</b> gradually reduced, the heating time and power consumption of the heating process increase slowly. When the <b>discharge</b> <b>rate</b> is 1 C, the heating time is more than 1080 s and the power consumption approaches 30 % of the rated capacity.

500|$|The {{opportunity}} for the row hammer effect to occur in DDR3 memory is primarily attributed to DDR3's high density of memory cells {{and the results of}} associated interactions between the cells, while rapid DRAM row activations have been determined as the primary cause. [...] Frequent row activations cause voltage fluctuations on the associated row selection lines, which have been observed to induce higher-than-natural <b>discharge</b> <b>rates</b> in capacitors belonging to nearby (adjacent, in most cases) memory rows, which are called victim rows; if the affected memory cells are not refreshed before they lose too much charge, disturbance errors occur. [...] Tests show that a disturbance error may be observed after performing around 139,000 subsequent memory row accesses (with cache flushes), and that up to one memory cell in every 1,700 cells may be susceptible. [...] Those tests also show that the rate of disturbance errors is not substantially affected by increased environment temperature, while it depends on the actual contents of DRAM because certain bit patterns result in significantly higher disturbance error rates.|$|E

Flooding in rural areas resulted in landslides in the mountains, while destroyed crops cost an estimated $7million. Hundreds of miles of roads and bridges were also destroyed, accounting for $82million in damage. Damage from Diane's winds were generally minor.
