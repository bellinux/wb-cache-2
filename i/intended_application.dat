5|$|It {{is largely}} an {{empirical}} procedure, {{and has a}} reasonable safety record {{within the scope of}} its <b>intended</b> <b>application.</b> Advantages are reduced overall decompression time and for some versions, easy estimation of decompression by the use of a simple rule-based procedure which can be done underwater by the diver. It requires the use of specific gas mixtures for given depth ranges. The advantages claimed are flexibility in that if the depth is not known accurately, the schedule can be adjusted during the dive to allow for the actual depth, and that it allows deep dives without the use of an expensive trimix dive computer.|$|E

25|$|Dietary {{exposure}} {{assessments are}} often completed using models to simulate exposure. Once dietary consumption data, chemical residue data and any additional supplemental {{information has been}} compiled, one can utilize the data to model the dietary exposure {{of the population of}} interest to the chemical of interest.

25|$|One of {{the most}} {{visually}} striking features of a steam locomotive is its wheel arrangement which is largely a function of its <b>intended</b> <b>application</b> and purpose. The fundamental principle of design for 19th century steam locomotives was tractive force which relies on adhesion. A switching locomotive for example, is relatively low-powered but with a high starting tractive effort for getting heavy cars rolling quickly. These locomotives are geared to produce high torque but are restricted to low top speeds and have small diameter driving wheels. Switchers are rail analogs to tugboats. For higher speeds, larger boilers were required which in turn {{led to the development}} of lead trucks.|$|E

25|$|There are a {{large number}} of {{different}} types of fish hooks. At the macro level, there are bait hooks, fly hooks and lure hooks. Within these broad categories there are wide varieties of hook types designed for different applications. Hook types differ in shape, materials, points and barbs, and eye type and ultimately in their <b>intended</b> <b>application.</b> When individual hook types are designed the specific characteristics of each of these hook components are optimized relative to the hook's intended purpose. For example, a delicate dry fly hook is made of thin wire with a tapered eye because weight is the overriding factor. Whereas Carlisle or Aberdeen light wire bait hooks make use of thin wire to reduce injury to live bait but the eyes are not tapered because weight is not an issue. Many factors contribute to hook design, including corrosion resistance, weight, strength, hooking efficiency, and whether the hook is being used for specific types of bait, on different types of lures or for different styles of flies. For each hook type, there are ranges of acceptable sizes. For all types of hooks, sizes range from 32 (the smallest) to 20/0 (the largest).|$|E

This results in control over material parameters known as [...] permittivity and magnetic permeability. These two parameters (or quantities) determine the propagation of electromagnetic waves in matter. Therefore, controlling the values of permittivity and permeability means that the refractive index can be negative or zero as well as conventionally positive. It {{all depends on the}} <b>intended</b> <b>application</b> or desired result. So, optical properties can be expanded beyond the capabilities of lenses, mirrors, and other conventional materials. Additionally, one of the effects most studied is the negative index of refraction.|$|E

2500|$|In general, {{the more}} surface area {{a heat sink}} has, the better it works. However, {{this is not always}} true. The concept of a pin fin heat sink is to try to pack as much surface area into a given volume as possible. As well, it works well in any orientation. Kordyban has {{compared}} the performance of a pin fin and a straight fin heat sink of similar dimensions. Although the pin fin has 194cm2 surface area while the straight fin has 58cm2, the temperature difference between the heat sink base and the ambient air for the pin fin is [...] For the straight fin it was 44°C or 6°C better than the pin fin. Pin fin heat sink performance is significantly better than straight fins when used in their <b>intended</b> <b>application</b> where the fluid flows axially along the pins (see [...] ) rather than only tangentially across the pins.|$|E

2500|$|As first {{reported}} by Wired on October 17, 2007, an interesting application of using PlayStation 3 in a cluster configuration was implemented by Astrophysicist Gaurav Khanna, from the Physics department of University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, who replaced time used on supercomputers with {{a cluster of}} eight PlayStation 3s. [...] Subsequently, {{the next generation of}} this machine, now called the PlayStation 3 Gravity Grid, uses a network of 16 machines, and exploits the Cell processor for the <b>intended</b> <b>application</b> which is binary black hole coalescence using perturbation theory. In particular, the cluster performs astrophysical simulations of large supermassive black holes capturing smaller compact objects and has generated numerical data that has been published multiple times in the relevant scientific research literature. The Cell processor version used by the PlayStation 3 has a main CPU and 6 SPEs available to the user, giving the Gravity Grid machine a net of 16 general-purpose processors and 96 vector processors. [...] The machine has a one-time cost of $9,000 to build and is adequate for black-hole simulations which would otherwise cost $6,000 per run on a conventional supercomputer. [...] The black hole calculations are not memory-intensive and are highly localizable, and so are well-suited to this architecture. Khanna claims that the cluster's performance exceeds that of a 100+ Intel Xeon core based traditional Linux cluster on his simulations. The PS3 Gravity Grid gathered significant media attention through 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2010.|$|E
