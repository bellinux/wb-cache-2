40|$|Abstract This paper {{deals with}} an {{employment}} of elec-trical resistivity imaging (ERI) for survey of leachate content on the waste disposal site in Northern Israel. The research consisted of conducting ten ERI lines and drilling investigation wells. Data simulation used a 2 D EarthImager inversion program. Analysis of 2 D ERI interpretation re-sults shows that {{determination of the}} boundary between the landfill body bottom intensively saturated with leachates and underlying layers of highly water saturated <b>fat</b> non-consolidated <b>clays</b> presents a challenge. However, statisti-cal analysis of ERI data indicates that standard deviation and confidence interval of a set of resistivity data measured in the landfill body are significantly larger than those in underlying clays. Moreover, maximum changes of these parameters are found on the boundary between landfill body and underlying soil, thus reflecting natural differences in scattering of resistivity data measured in these two ob-jects...|$|R

40|$|Author's final manuscriptA {{series of}} Bromhead ring shear tests were {{conducted}} to measure the drained residual strength of Rancho Solano <b>Fat</b> <b>Clay.</b> Tests conducted using different test procedures demonstrate the significant effect that wall friction can have in the Bromhead ring shear device. This problem was addressed by beveling the top loading platen, which led to measurements of drained residual strength that were 21 – 23 % lower than those measured with the unmodified platen. Using the modified platen, similar test results can be achieved independent {{of the details of}} the test procedure that is followed, giving greater confidence in the measured residual shear strength.

40|$|Author's final manuscriptFast {{and slow}} ring shear tests were {{performed}} in the Bromhead ring shear device to {{examine the effect of}} the displacement rate on the shear strength measured along slickensided discontinuities in Rancho Solano <b>Fat</b> <b>Clay.</b> For each test, initial drained shearing was performed at a displacement rate of 0. 018 mm/min, fast shearing was performed at a rate of 44. 5 mm/min, and drained shearing was recommenced at a displacement rate of 0 : 018 mm/min. Significant variations in measured post-peak shear strengths were observed, and problems with the pore pressure response in the soil surrounding the slickensided plane are discussed. As a result of these problems, it was concluded that fast Bromhead ring shear tests may not be suitable for evaluating the effects of fast shearing on the strengths of slickensided surfaces.

As recipients of this tradition, Greek and Roman medical writers offered magical, verbal therapies along with theoretical and empirical approaches. From the perspective of modern medicine, the irrational element can perhaps be overemphasized; many remedies in the Medicina Plinii, such as a topical cream for sores made from bear <b>fat</b> and red <b>clay,</b> or any number of potent herbal preparations, are typical of traditional medicine and contain active ingredients with demonstrated effect.|$|R
30|$|First {{three tests}} were {{performed}} to determine the index properties. Water pycnometer {{was used to determine}} the specific gravity of soils. Hydrometer tests {{were performed to}} find out the percentage of sand, silt, and clay contents in soil samples. The sizes of clay, silt, and sand particles used in this study are[*]<[*] 0.005  mm, 0.005 – 0.05  mm, and 0.05 – 2  mm respectively. The liquid limit and plastic limit of samples were established according to ASTM D- 4318 [17]. Samples were classified according to the Unified Soil Classification System (USCS) by using the index properties. Eight samples were classified as lean clay/low plastic clays (CL), and 22 samples were classified as <b>fat</b> clays/high plastic <b>clays</b> (CH). Standard compaction test was used to find out the compaction characteristics of soils [20].|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{suitability}} of industrial by-product oil-clay to produce biogas in anaerobic digestion was studied. Oil-clay (spent bleaching earth) contains high amounts of <b>fats</b> and <b>clay</b> (sand). The methane production potential was studied by methane production batch assay with two mesophilic and one thermophilic inoculum. Methane production potential of oil-clay was high in all assays ranging from 532 to 664 l CH 4 /kg substrate VS added and from 728 to 922 l CH 4 /kg substrate VS removed. The yield {{was close to}} the theoretical maximum of fats. No inhibition caused by high lipid content of the substrate was ob-served, only some differences in the lag phase before the methane production initiated. Pretreatment with alkali increased the soluble COD but it did not {{have an effect on the}} methane production potential of oil-clay in batch assay. Thermal pretreatment had no effect on soluble COD levels. The behavior of oil-clay in the anaerobic digestion vessel was observed to be problematic, because of its tendency to float and after wetting sink quickly to the bottom. The spent oil-clay is acidic (pH 3. 5) causing the need to adjust the pH before feeding it to the digester. As a conclusion it can be postulated that oil-clay substrate used is a potent feedstock for methane production by anaerobic digestion. Its methane production potential is high and the volatile solids of the substrate are efficiently used for methanogenesis. However the acidic nature, high lipid content and behavior in the vessel need to be taken into account when planning full scale application. More studies with actual reactors and careful planning of the input amounts and processes are needed to evaluate this issue further...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Miocene {{siltstone}} with variable sand {{content and}} bentonitic clay {{is the most}} abundant sediments encountered at the metro construction site at Rákóczi Square (Budapest). Core logs, drilling reports and records of laboratory analyses were studied {{to better understand the}} local geology and to prepare a database on engineering geologic properties of the materials. Using this database, geologic sections were prepared and geomathematical methods were used to obtain a better correlation of the strata in the area and a reconstruction of the geologic evolution of the area. The samples were divided into five groups based on physical properties. These five parameters allowed the use of multivariate statistical methods as cluster and discriminant analysis. As a result it was possible to identify several types of lithotypes, including two bentonitic clays with substantially different properties, one <b>fat</b> <b>clay,</b> one medium clay and one sandy, lean clay and siltstone group...|$|E
40|$|Soil {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} things in every civil engineering construction. But the problem is how to define physical and mechanic characteristic of the soil. Physical and mechanic characteristic that have influence on bearing capacity of the soil is water content. Size of soil also has effects on the changing of water content. To define water content, engineer is often using Gravimetry Method, but this method can only be doing in laboratory, so it can 2 ̆ 7 t specifically describe real condition of water content in the fields. Then, an in-site test such as Electrical Sensory Method is needed, in order To get correct result of water content in fields.

40|$|Permeability {{anisotropy}} (ratio {{of horizontal}} to vertical permeability) {{is an important}} but uncertain parameter used in characterizing underground formations. While it is a fairly unknown parameter, it is integral for the petroleum industry, where a greater permeability anisotropy understanding can greatly aid in basin modelling, pore pressure prediction, and borehole stability. This research experimentally characterizes the permeability anisotropy of several mudrocks, which are clay-rich sedimentary formations, using re-sedimentation, a process of homogenization of naturally-occurring soils and recreation of the sedimentation environment in a controlled laboratory setting. The permeability anisotropy of resedimented Boston Blue Clay (RBBC), an illitic lean clay (CL), increases from 1. 5 to 3 when mechanically compressed from 0. 1 to 40 MPa, corresponding to porosities ranging from 0. 55 to 0. 26. Resedimented Gulf of Mexico - Eugene Island mudrock (RGoM-EI), a smectitic <b>fat</b> <b>clay</b> (CH), exhibits permeability anisotropy increasing from 1 to 5 when compressed to the same stresses, corresponding to porosities ranging from 0. 6 to 0. 25. Not only does smectitic RGoM-EI mudrock transition to greater anisotropy with compression, but {{the rate of increase}} accelerates with compression. These measurements are made using a commercially-available Trautwein® constant rate of strain (CRS) consolidometer with vertical drainage combined with a novel radially-outward draining CRS device. The combination of the vertically and radially draining CRS devices produces permeability anisotropy data quickly, with very little scatter. For RGoM-EI, the effects of horizontal shearing to 29. 5 % shear strain at 0. 14 MPa on permeability anisotropy are negligible. Permeability anisotropy of the homogeneous resedimented mudrocks tested, using a cubic specimen constant head permeameter within a triaxial cell, is directly correlated to their electrical conductivity anisotropy. The permeability anisotropy values measured using this technology, however, are lower than those measured using CRS testing. by Taylor James Nordquist. Thesis: S.
