500|$|By contrast, {{the young}} Edward VI disliked Windsor Castle. Edward's Protestant beliefs {{led him to}} simplify the Garter ceremonies, to {{discontinue}} the annual Feast of the Garter at Windsor and to remove any signs of Catholic practices with the Order. During the rebellions and political strife of 1549, Windsor was again used as a safe-haven for the king and the Duke of Somerset. Edward famously commented whilst staying at Windsor Castle during this period that [...] "Methink <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> prison, here are no galleries, nor no gardens to walk in". Under both Edward and his sister, Mary I, some limited building work continued at the castle, in many cases using resources recovered from the English abbeys. Water was piped into the Upper Ward to create a fountain. Mary also expanded the buildings used by the Knights of Windsor in the Lower Ward, using stone from Reading Abbey.|$|E
500|$|On the {{afternoon}} of 17 October, two weeks after their arrival, Horatio and eighteen of his party were murdered in the deadliest massacre of settlers by Aborigines in Australian history. Tom was away from the property at the time, having been sent with two stockmen to collect supplies left en route to Cullin-la-Ringo. He returned several days later to a scene of devastation. Despairing and in shock, Wills first wrote to Harrison in Melbourne: [...] "... all our party except I have been slaughtered by the black's ... <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> great fix no men." [...] Police, native police and vigilante groups from neighbouring stations swiftly tracked down and killed at least 70 local Aborigines; the total may have been 300. Wills took refuge near Cullin-la-ringo, and though he desired to avenge his father's death, {{there is no evidence}} that he joined the reprisal raids.|$|E

500|$|For the 1969 season, Rindt {{signed for}} the 1968 World Constructors' Champion Lotus, where {{he joined the}} {{defending}} Drivers' Champion Graham Hill. Rindt felt uncomfortable with the move, owing to the notorious unreliability of the Lotus car; in a twenty-month period between 1967 and 1969, the team was involved in 31 accidents. Hill alone had nine crashes between 1968 and 1970, which led him to joke: [...] "Every time I am being overtaken by my own wheel, I know <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> Lotus." [...] When Rindt joined Lotus, his friend and de facto manager Bernie Ecclestone, who had negotiated the deal, remarked that they were aware that Brabham {{may have been a}} better choice of team but the speed of the Lotus gave Rindt a chance to win the championship. Rindt commented: [...] "At Lotus, I can either be world champion or die." [...] Because of his uncertainty about the wisdom of joining the team, Rindt did not sign the Lotus contract until shortly before the 1969 Spanish Grand Prix.|$|E

According to Eddie Van Halen, as a teen, he would often practice while walking around at home with his guitar strapped on or sitting in his room for hours with the door locked. Van Halen acknowledged the importance of super group Cream's [...] "I'm So Glad" [...] on Goodbye Cream to be mind-blowing. He once claimed that he had learned almost all of Eric Clapton's solos in the band Cream [...] "...note for note."

2500|$|In August 2010, she {{was criticized}} after saying that {{breastfeeding}} should be law. She told Harper's Bazaar UK, [...] "Some people here [...] think they don't have to breastfeed, and I think 'Are {{you going to}} give chemical food to your child when they are so little?'...I think there should be a worldwide law, in my opinion, that mothers should breastfeed their babies for six months." [...] Bündchen later posted a statement on her blog saying, [...] "My intention in making a comment about the importance of breastfeeding {{has nothing to do with}} the law. It comes from my passionate beliefs about children. Being a new mom has brought a lot of questions. I feel like <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> constant search for answers on what might be the best for my child. It's unfortunate that in an interview sometimes things can seem so black and white." ...|$|E
2500|$|Symington ran {{for reelection}} {{to a second}} term in 1994. In the Republican primary, Symington was {{challenged}} by Barbara Barrett, wife of business executive Craig Barrett. In regard to his primary campaign message, Symington stated [...] "I vowed to get state spending under control, reduce taxes and {{do my best to}} promote economic development and restore strength to the economy. I think <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> strong position because I accomplished my goals." [...] Barrett had spent more than $1 million of her own money in the attempt to defeat Symington, who she stated she did not dislike personally, but simply felt that she could do a better job as Governor. On September 13, 1994, Symington defeated Barrett in the primary by a margin of 68% to 32%. Political analysts stated that Barrett had failed to distinguish herself from the incumbent Governor, and ran a flawed campaign.|$|E
2500|$|With {{reference}} to the Voisin Machine recently presented by the Duke of Westminster and delivered to the Wolsley (sic) Tools and Motor Co., I have to report that the method of controlling and steering this machine is obsolete and different to any present make; that the wood frame of the wings struts and canvas covering have deteriorated {{to such a degree}} that they should be replaced if the machine is to be flown in safety. [...] I therefore desire to recommend that I may be instructed to fit this machine with certain spare wings and struts which I have in stock and alter the controls so that it is similar to the Farman type, and thus enable the machine to be flown by anyone qualified to fly a Farman type machine. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> position to effect these alterations quickly and economically and it would then be equal to a good Farman machine.|$|E

I believe {{the time has come for}} me to put my talents to good use. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> rush to fetch my mother but I will be {{dropping}} by Dongcheng County for a while. I heard that recently, someone called Zheng Bao (鄭寶) has rallied thousands of followers in Chaohu and the lands under their control are very fertile. Many people in Lujiang Commandery are planning to join him after hearing about him – not to mention myself. I observe his situation and see that he is still gathering followers. You should act fast and not miss this opportunity." [...] Lu Su agreed with what Liu Ye said. After his grandmother's funeral, Lu Su returned to Qu'e County and made plans to leave Jiangdong and head north to join Zheng Bao. However, he found out that Zhou Yu had fetched his mother to Wu Commandery (吳郡; around present-day Suzhou, Jiangsu) so he went to Wu Commandery to speak to Zhou Yu.|$|E

He put my file on the desk, sat in the swivel chair and turned to face me. He smiled; I smiled. I could tell from the way he was acting that he wasn't going to tell me anything that I didn't already know.
