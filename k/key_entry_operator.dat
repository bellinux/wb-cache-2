Subjects complained about neck and shoulder pain, visual problems, and psychosocial conditions. The ergonomic intervention included installation of new luminaires and Venetian blinds, new chairs, repair of ventilators, and optometric corrections. The results after the intervention showed mainly improvement in chair comfort, lighting conditions, visual strain, and sitting posture.

To be more illustrative they are now crust of the security systems in many military agencies. It is very often noticed that, a combination of biometric and key login {{or a combination of}} token and a key are widely accepted authentication systems. Besides the problem of high faulty recognition, biometric suffers from a backdrop of high cost and slow authentication process. Like many of our valuable possessions tokens like magnetic cards are highly prone to theft and duplication. Traditional <b>key</b> <b>entry</b> schemes are very much vulnerable to peeping and shoulder surfing attacks. Furthermore, with the advancement of technology many other fake login schemes like dictionary attacks or key logging have become a major security concern. In this paper we propose pattern based <b>key</b> <b>entry</b> scheme, Mirage 1. 0, which would not only withstand peeping and shoulder-surfing attacks but also would be resilient towards dictionary attacks and key logging schemes.
