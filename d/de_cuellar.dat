50|$|As Pérez <b>de</b> <b>Cuéllar's</b> {{second term}} {{drew to a}} close in 1991, the {{campaign}} for an African Secretary-General got underway. The Organization of African Unity promised that its member states would vote against any non-African candidates in the General Assembly. The Non-Aligned Movement also endorsed the six official candidates from Africa. Since the Non-Aligned Movement included a majority of the votes in the UN General Assembly, it could block any candidate recommended by the Security Council. China again declared its support for a Secretary-General from Africa. However, the other four permanent members of the Security Council rejected the principle of regional rotation.|$|R

40|$|The file {{associated}} with this record is embargoed while permission to archive is sought from the publisher. The final published version may be available through the links aboveDuring {{the late nineteenth and}} early twentieth century, alcoholism was a relatively new and ill-defined concept in Mexican society, but despite this conceptual lack of clarity, alcoholism loomed large in public discourse and public policy as a source of concern. Mexican politicians, intellectuals, and medical professionals, who were engaged in major public health reforms, informed by positivist philosophies and degeneration theories, and devoted to the governmental motto of “order and progress”, considered alcoholism to be a major threat to national development. The unstable edges of alcoholism as a concept, together with its place within era-defining discourses and policies, therefore, make it a very useful theme to explore the multifaceted and layered engagement of intellectuals and public figures with questions of identity, selfhood, and authenticity during a time of landscape of modernising change and development in Mexican society. This chapter will examine the fictional biographies of alcoholic characters across different genres and styles of Mexican literature in {{the late nineteenth and early}} twentieth century, to illuminate the larger intellectual process through which Mexican writers participated in the construction of Mexico’s “biography” as a nation. While symbols {{associated with}} alcohol and drinking were intertwined with the articulation of an “authentic” past, or birth, of the Mexican nation, alcoholism as a kind of medical and psychological condition was frequently used to explore Mexico’s present and potential future as a nation. José Tomás <b>de</b> <b>Cuéllar’s</b> Las jamonas (1891) and Federico Gamboa’s Santa (1903) narrate the life stories of two fictional alcoholics, and, through their exploration of the characters’ alcoholism and its impact on their selfhood, these texts identify aspects of modernity that conflict with an idealised, traditional Mexican identity of the past. Consequently, alcoholism features prominently in the articulation of anxieties about the Mexican present and, in particular, about the destabilising effect of social change on “authentic” images of Mexican identity. The works of Rubén Campos and Heriberto Frías, meanwhile, also chart the biographies of various real and fictional alcoholics to look to the future, and, particularly, to dwell on the potential death of Mexican nationhood (or, at least, the death of its contemporary form). Within each biography, alcoholism makes possible the realisation of a more authentic self, but this experience also reveals the emptiness of nationalist ideals like fraternity, sacrifice, and patriotism and of modernist ideals like order, progress, and development, without necessarily offering any alternatives to replace them. Through the exploration of these different literary biographies of alcoholism, therefore, this chapter will show how the biography of the Mexican nation was imagined at the turn of the twentieth century.

Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit {{extended}} the Child Status Protection Act’s (“CSPA”) protections to all children who age {{out during the}} extended process of obtaining a visa as a child derivative beneficiary. In so holding, the court overturned a precedential decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals (“BIA”). In its review of the BIA’s decision, the Ninth Circuit applied the two-step test from Chevron, U. S. A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., the seminal case in administrative law for review of executive agency action. The court exercised a rigorous review in step one of the test, and held that the CSPA unambiguously grants broad protection to all aged-out children. In exercising its constitutional power to say “what the law is,” the court protected immigrant families by ensuring the executive agency executes the law accurately and fully, as passed by Congress. As the Supreme Court of the United States considers this case, it should uphold the Ninth Circuit {{to ensure that the}} unambiguous protection granted by Congress to all children will be properly implemented by the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services...|$|R

25|$|In 1511, {{the first}} Spanish {{settlement}} {{was founded by}} Diego Velázquez <b>de</b> <b>Cuéllar</b> at Baracoa. Other towns soon followed, including San Cristobal de la Habana, founded in 1515, which later became the capital. The native Taíno were forced to work under the encomienda system, which resembled a feudal system in Medieval Europe. Within a century the indigenous people were virtually wiped out due to multiple factors, primarily Eurasian infectious diseases, to which they had no natural resistance (immunity), aggravated by harsh conditions of the repressive colonial subjugation. In 1529, a measles outbreak in Cuba killed two-thirds of those few natives who had previously survived smallpox.|$|E

Velázquez then commissioned another expedition led by his nephew Juan de Grijalva, who sailed south along the coast to Tabasco, part of the Aztec empire. In 1518 Velázquez gave the mayor of the capital of Cuba, Hernán Cortés, the command of an expedition to secure the interior of Mexico but, due to an old gripe between them, revoked the charter.|$|E

Goldsmith and a party of activists subsequently occupied the main lobby, refusing to move until the Secretary General, Perez <b>de</b> <b>Cuellar,</b> agreed to see them. The group demanded for him to call an extraordinary general meeting of the Security Council to tackle the global crisis of deforestation. Although failing, the campaign managed to organise a meeting in the US Senate with a group of senators, headed by Al Gore, whom the activists called upon to end their support of the World Bank.|$|E
25|$|The Spanish {{began to}} create {{permanent}} settlements {{on the island}} of Hispaniola, east of Cuba, soon after Columbus' arrival in the Caribbean, but the coast of Cuba was not fully mapped until 1509, when Sebastián de Ocampo completed this task. In 1511, Diego Velázquez <b>de</b> <b>Cuéllar</b> set out from Hispaniola to form the first Spanish settlement in Cuba, with orders from Spain to conquer the island. The settlement was at Baracoa, but the new settlers were to be greeted with stiff resistance from the local Taíno population. The Taínos were initially organized by cacique (chieftain) Hatuey, who had himself relocated from Hispaniola to escape the brutalities of Spanish rule on that island. After a prolonged guerrilla campaign, Hatuey and successive chieftains were captured and burnt alive, and within three years the Spanish had gained control of the island. In 1514, a settlement was founded in what was to become Havana.|$|E
