40|$|The {{characteristics}} of the driver population in Kentucky were examined and related to their driving record.

Accident records _ and responses to a questionnaire distributed to {{a random sample of}} the driver- population <b>and</b> to high-risk <b>drivers</b> were the data source for the study. Frequency of accidents was found to be much higher among males than it was among females and was highest among teenage drivers. However, females had a higher accident rate. Teenage drivers had the highest accident rate. The rate decreased for-qriddle-aged <b>drivers</b> <b>and</b> then increased again among older drivers. In contrast, the fatal accident rate for males was almost twice that for females. Young <b>drivers</b> <b>and</b> males tended to have more single-vehicle accidents while older <b>drivers</b> <b>and</b> females were involved in more rear-end- and angle-type accidents. Unsafe speed and alcohol involvement were listed as contributing factors in accidents more often for young <b>drivers</b> <b>and</b> males. Failure to yield was listed more often for accidents involving older <b>drivers</b> <b>and</b> females. A direct relationship was found between the number of traffic violations a <b>driver</b> receives <b>and</b> frequency of accident involvement.

30|$|Stakeholder theory {{accounts}} {{for all individuals}} who are socially impacted or who have a social impact on the firm through social <b>drivers</b> <b>and</b> barriers (Kusyk and Lozano, 2007). Using grounded theory, Kusyk and Lozano (2007) identify <b>drivers</b> <b>and</b> barriers to social issue management. They classify internal and external stakeholders according to their <b>drivers</b> <b>and</b> barriers to social responsibility practices <b>and</b> weigh these <b>drivers</b> <b>and</b> barriers in order to assign them to a category. The stakeholders are placed into categories by Kusyk and Lozano (2007) and ranked with valences of low management of social issues to high involvement and high decision-making in managing social issues. The current study defines this weighing as the stakeholder social issue management valences (SIMVs). Kusyk and Lozano (2007) conceptualize the social issue management valences exhibited by stakeholders in small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) into a 2 x 2 matrix of internal <b>and</b> external <b>drivers</b> <b>and</b> barriers to social issue management.|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The study aims to {{investigate}} the <b>drivers</b> <b>and</b> enablers Swedish companies’ have when reshoring. To fulfill {{the purpose of the}} study, two research questions have been formulated: What drivers do Swedish companies’ have for reshoring? What enablers do Swedish companies’ have for reshoring? Method – In order to fulfill the purpose of the study, a literature review and a case study of three manufacturing companies was conducted. The literature review was conducted to create a theoretical framework of <b>drivers</b> <b>and</b> enablers when reshoring and the case study consisted of interviews and document studies which generated empirical data. This data was analyzed and the theory of reshoring has been developed and updated through the results of this study. Findings – In this study, 19 of the 45 <b>drivers</b> <b>and</b> 7 of the 19 enablers identified in theory are confirmed. The study shows that it is not only one driver or one enabler behind Swedish companies' reshoring decisions, it is a combination of many. The study also identifies 15 new <b>drivers</b> <b>and</b> 12 new enablers to Swedish companies when reshoring. These new <b>drivers</b> <b>and</b> enablers are not considered specific for Swedish companies, but can be seen as general. However, further research is required to confirm this. The study shows that there are major differences in the <b>drivers</b> <b>and</b> enablers for Swedish companies when reshoring, as only four <b>drivers</b> <b>and</b> four enablers are confirmed by more than one case company. Even though the case companies all are manufacturing companies, they differ in several aspects and have different conditions. This has resulted in the study showing a variety of <b>drivers</b> <b>and</b> enablers and that a number of new <b>drivers</b> <b>and</b> enablers have been identified. This confirms that more research of this type, about reshoring in a Swedish context, is needed to identify more <b>drivers</b> <b>and</b> enablers and fill the gap that exists in the theory. Implications – Since research about reshoring is fairly unexplored, the theoretical implications of this study have been to partially fill the gap of knowledge about <b>drivers</b> <b>and</b> enablers, as new ones have been identified at the case companies. However, the study has also contributed with a new dimension as it separates <b>drivers</b> <b>and</b> enablers from one another, something that is not clearly made in the existing theory. Furthermore, a suggestion of how the <b>drivers</b> <b>and</b> enablers can be categorized is presented. From a practical perspective, this study has given companies wishing to reshore, other companies experiences of reshoring. This can facilitate decision making, as decisions to a greater extent can be based on facts rather than gut feeling. This may result in companies becoming more competitive and long-term strengthening their survival. Limitations – The limitations of the study consists of the fact that only three companies were included in the case study and that only one person was interviewed from each case company. Had more companies and more respondents been included in the case study, more <b>drivers</b> <b>and</b> enablers probably would have been identified. Furthermore, the generalization is also limited by the fact that only manufacturing companies have been included in the study. Companies in the service sector have been reshoring, and if any of these companies were included in the study, other <b>drivers</b> <b>and</b> enablers would probably have been identified.
