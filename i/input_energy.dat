25|$|Heat {{pumps are}} more {{effective}} for heating than for cooling an interior space if the temperature differential is held equal. This is because the compressor's <b>input</b> <b>energy</b> is also converted to useful heat when in heating mode, and is discharged along with the transported heat via the condenser to the interior space. But for cooling, the condenser is normally outdoors, and the compressor's dissipated work (waste heat) must also be transported to outdoors using more <b>input</b> <b>energy,</b> rather than being put to a useful purpose. For the same reason, opening a food refrigerator or freezer has {{the net effect of}} heating up the room rather than cooling it, because its refrigeration cycle rejects heat to the indoor air. This heat includes the compressor's dissipated work as well as the heat removed from the inside of the appliance.|$|E

40|$|We analyse the {{influence}} of <b>input</b> pump pulse <b>energy</b> on the four-wave mixing (FWM) conversion efficiency in semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOAs). For the simulation of the wave propagation in the SOA, we use the nonlinear propagation equation {{taking into account the}} gain spectrum dynamics, gain saturation which depends on carrier depletion, carrier heating, spectral hole-burning, group velocity dispersion, self-phase modulation and two photon absorption. The simulation results confirm that corresponding to each <b>input</b> probe pulse <b>energy,</b> there is an optimum <b>input</b> pump <b>energy</b> that maximises the FWM conversion efficiency in the SOA. The configuration of the SOA <b>input</b> pump pulse <b>energy</b> is organised to maximise the FWM conversion efficiency, which is very much useful in practical communication systems. It is shown that energy of the generated FWM pulse will remain constant when the <b>input</b> pump <b>energy</b> increases further from the optimum <b>input</b> pump <b>energy.</b> Moreover, FWM conversion efficiency will decrease when the <b>input</b> pump <b>energy</b> increases further from the optimum <b>input</b> pump <b>energy...</b>|$|R

25|$|The energy {{efficiency}} {{of a system}} or device that converts energy {{is measured by the}} ratio of the amount of useful energy put out by the system ("output energy") to the total amount of energy that is put in ("input energy") or by useful output energy {{as a percentage of the}} total <b>input</b> <b>energy.</b> In the case of fuel cells, useful output energy is measured in electrical energy produced by the system. <b>Input</b> <b>energy</b> is the energy stored in the fuel. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, fuel cells are generally between 40–60% energy efficient. This is higher than some other systems for energy generation. For example, the typical internal combustion engine of a car is about 25% energy efficient. In combined heat and power (CHP) systems, the heat produced by the fuel cell is captured and put to use, increasing the efficiency of the system to up to 85–90%.|$|E

The grain {{can be used for}} liquid transportation fuels while the straw can be burned to produce heat or electricity. Plant biomass can also be degraded from cellulose to glucose through a series of chemical treatments, and the resulting sugar can then be used as a first generation biofuel.|$|E

Sandia labs recently proposed a conceptual 1 petawatt (1015 watts) LTD Z-pinch power plant, where the electric discharge would reach 70 million amperes.

The numerical calculations, performed using both truncated Wigner and exact $+P$ phase-space methods, include nonlinear and stochastic Raman effects, through coupling to phonons variables. The simulations reveal that excess phase noise, such as from depolarising GAWBS, affects squeezing at low <b>input</b> <b>energies,</b> while Raman effects cause a marked deterioration of squeezing at higher energies and longer fibre lengths.

The energy consumption for different farm operations from land preparation to transportation,- to storage, and- to market places was considered. Primary {{data were obtained}} through field survey and personal interviews using questionnaires. The {{data were collected from}} 909 farms owned by 487 farmers. Secondary data and energy equivalents were obtained from available literature. Results showed that <b>energy</b> <b>input</b> in farm operations for sugarcane production was the highest (14. 48 - 18. 65 GJ/ha). For irrigated rice, rainfed rice, maize, wet-season soybean and cassava, it varied between 1. 79 - 18. 49, 10. 09 - 13. 11, 9. 79 - 12. 79, 5. 21 - 10. 03 and 4. 95 - 9. 13 GJ/ha respectively. <b>Energy</b> <b>input</b> in dry-season soybean production was the lowest with a range of 5. 31 - 7. 86 GJ/ha.

25|$|These output {{energies}} {{are still}} {{less than the}} 422MJ of <b>input</b> <b>energy</b> required to charge the system's capacitors that power the laser amplifiers. The net wall-plug efficiency of NIF (UV laser energy out divided by the energy required to pump the lasers from an external source) is less than one percent, and the total wall-to-fusion efficiency is under 10% at its maximum performance. An economical fusion reactor would require that the fusion output be at least {{an order of magnitude}} more than this input. Commercial laser fusion systems would use the much more efficient diode-pumped solid state lasers, where wall-plug efficiencies of 10 percent have been demonstrated, and efficiencies 16-18 percent are expected with advanced concepts under development.|$|E
25|$|The fission of a {{heavy nucleus}} {{requires}} a total <b>input</b> <b>energy</b> of about 7 to 8 million electron volts (MeV) to initially overcome the nuclear force which holds the nucleus into a spherical or nearly spherical shape, and from there, deform it into a two-lobed ("peanut") shape in which the lobes are {{able to continue to}} separate from each other, pushed by their mutual positive charge, in the most common process of binary fission (two positively charged fission products + neutrons). Once the nuclear lobes have been pushed to a critical distance, beyond which the short range strong force can no longer hold them together, the process of their separation proceeds from the energy of the (longer range) electromagnetic repulsion between the fragments. The result is two fission fragments moving away from each other, at high energy.|$|E
25|$|When {{hydrocarbon}} molecules (oil) {{are forced}} into water layer, hydrogen bond of water molecules and some dispersion forces between hydrocarbon molecules {{must have been}} destroyed, and new water-hydrocarbon interaction must have been formed in this state. Considering enthalpy change of the process, the <b>input</b> <b>energy</b> to reach this state and the released energy break even rendering enthalpy change of zero (ΔHsolution =0) for the process. Enthalpy change equals zero also means that the thermal entropy change ΔSthermal is also about zero for the process. However, positional entropy change for the process (ΔSpositional) is negative. This is because when oil droplets are in water medium, those water molecules that are {{in contact with the}} hydrocarbon molecules lose their freedom of movement. If oil droplets are not in water phase, more water molecules would be more freely to move instead of having restriction on their arrangements. Thus, it is a thermodynamically favorable process for the pure, unprotected oil droplets to move out of water medium as the process is driven forward by entropy.|$|E
