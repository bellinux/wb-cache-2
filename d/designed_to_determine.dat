25|$|The New Zealand Land Commission was a 19th-century {{government}} {{inquiry into}} the validity of claims to land purchases by European settlers from the New Zealand Māori people prior to 1840, when New Zealand was annexed to the Australian colony of New South Wales. The inquiry was <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> who owned what land, in order to formalise and regulate land ownership in the new colony. The commission carried out its work in two distinct sections—a three-man inquiry to examine purchases in general throughout New Zealand, and a one-man inquiry run by English lawyer William Spain to investigate just those purchases claimed by the New Zealand Company. The commissions were to advise the Governor of which claims were accepted, {{with the expectation that}} land owners would then be awarded a Crown grant to their property.|$|E

2500|$|The SSP {{contained}} {{a number of}} sensors <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> the physical properties of Titan's surface {{at the point of}} impact, whether the surface was solid or liquid. An acoustic sounder, activated during the last 100 meters of the descent, continuously determined the distance to the surface, measuring the rate of descent and the surface roughness (e.g., due to waves). The instrument was designed so that if the surface were liquid, the sounder would measure the speed of sound in the [...] "ocean" [...] and possibly also the subsurface structure (depth). During descent, measurements of the speed of sound gave information on atmospheric composition and temperature, and an accelerometer recorded the deceleration profile at impact, indicating the hardness and structure of the surface. A tilt sensor measured pendulum motion during the descent and was also designed to indicate the probe's attitude after landing and show any motion due to waves. If the surface had been liquid, other sensors would also have measured its density, temperature, thermal conductivity, heat capacity, electrical properties (permittivity and conductivity) and refractive index (using a critical angle refractometer). [...] A penetrometer instrument, that protruded 55mm past the bottom of the Huygens descent module, was used to create a penetrometer trace as Huygens landed on the surface by measuring the force exerted on the instrument by the surface as the instrument broke though the surface and was pushed down into the planet by the force of the probe landing itself. [...] The trace shows this force as a function of time over a period of about 400 ms. [...] The trace has an initial spike which suggests that the instrument hit one of the icy pebbles [...] on the surface photographed by the DISR camera.|$|E
