Alprazolam is not very soluble in water—when crushed in water it does not fully dissolve (40µg/ml of H2O at pH 7). There have also been anecdotal reports of alprazolam being snorted.

5|$|Animal {{studies show}} that astatine, {{similarly}} to iodine, although to a lesser extent, is preferentially concentrated in the thyroid gland. Unlike iodine, astatine also shows {{a tendency to be}} taken up by the lungs and spleen, possibly because of in-body oxidation of At– to At+. If administered {{in the form of a}} radiocolloid it tends to concentrate in the liver. Experiments in rats and monkeys suggest that astatine-211 causes much greater damage to the thyroid gland than does iodine-131, with repetitive <b>injection</b> <b>of</b> the nuclide resulting in necrosis and cell dysplasia within the gland. Early research suggested that <b>injection</b> <b>of</b> astatine into female rodents caused morphological changes in breast tissue; this conclusion remained controversial for many years. General agreement was later reached that this was likely caused by the effect of breast tissue irradiation combined with hormonal changes due to irradiation of the ovaries. Trace amounts of astatine can be handled safely in fume hoods if they are well-aerated; biological uptake of the element must be avoided.|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} study, we {{investigated}} {{the influence of}} intra-medial septum (intra-MS) <b>injections</b> <b>of</b> dopamine D 1 receptor agents on amnesia induced by intra-CA 1 <b>injections</b> <b>of</b> a muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist, scopolamine. This study used a step-through inhibitory (passive) avoidance task to assess memory in adult male Wistar rats. The results showed that in the animals that received post-training intra-MS <b>injections</b> <b>of</b> saline, intra-CA 1 administrations of scopolamine (0. 75, 1, and 2 Î¼g/rat) decreased inhibitory avoidance (IA) memory consolidation as evidenced by a decrease in step-through latency on the test day, which was suggestive of drug-induced amnesia. Post-training intra-MS <b>injections</b> <b>of</b> a dopamine D 1 receptor agonist, SKF 38393 at doses of 0. 1, 0. 15, and 0. 3 Î¼g/rat had no effect, but at dose of 0. 5 Î¼g/rat impaired IA memory consolidation. Interestingly, intra-MS <b>injections</b> <b>of</b> SKF 38393 (0. 15, 0. 3 and 0. 5 Î¼g/rat) significantly prevented amnesia induced by intra-CA 1 <b>injections</b> <b>of</b> scopolamine (1 Î¼g/rat). Intra-MS <b>injections</b> <b>of</b> a dopamine D 1 receptor antagonist, SCH 23390 (0. 5 and 0. 75 Î¼g/rat) by itself impaired IA memory consolidation, and also at dose of 0. 75 Î¼g/rat increased amnesia induced by intra-CA 1 administrations of an ineffective dose of scopolamine (0. 5 Î¼g/rat). Post-training intra-MS <b>injections</b> <b>of</b> ineffective doses of SCH 23390 (0. 1, 0. 3 and 0. 5 Î¼g/rat) prevented an effective dose of SKF 38393 response to the impaired effect of scopolamine.

40|$|Cardiac slowing {{occurring}} during diagnostic coronary arteriography was {{studied in}} 78 patients. Comparable degrees of slowing occurred with injections {{into the right}} and into the left coronary arteries into the contralateral artery, and with injections into the coronary artery giving rise to the sinus node artery and into the contralateral artery. Rapid intracoronary <b>injections</b> <b>of</b> isosmotic dextrose solution produced significantly less slowing than comparable <b>injections</b> <b>of</b> contrast medium. Slow <b>injections</b> <b>of</b> contrast medium produced cardiac slowing comparable to that caused by rapid <b>injections</b> <b>of</b> contrast medium. However, the cardiac slowing was significantly greater than that produced by rapid <b>injections</b> <b>of</b> dextrose solution. Inhalation of 100 % oxygen did not alter the heart rate response to <b>injections</b> <b>of</b> contrast medium. Atropine produced dose-related attenuation of cardiac slowing. Bradycardia persisting after cholinergic blockade was significantly greater after injections into the coronary artery supplying the sinus node than it was after injections into the contralateral artery.

In experiment 1, rats received an eight-trial training session {{on one of}} the two tasks followed by <b>injections</b> <b>of</b> d-amphetamine or saline. Retention was tested 24 hr later. On the spatial task, intrahippocampal, but not intracaudate, <b>injections</b> <b>of</b> d-amphetamine facilitated retention.

The findings (i) provide further evidence of a dissociation between the roles of the hippocampus and caudate nucleus in different forms of memory, (ii) indicate that the modulatory role of the amygdala is not limited to either of the two different forms of memory represented in spatial and cued discriminations in a water maze, and (iii) are consistent with previous findings indicating that amygdala influences on memory storage are not mediated by lasting neural changes located within the amygdala...|$|R

The disruption of neurotransmitter release patterns at the site <b>of</b> <b>injection</b> appears to contribute significantly to the mechanisms underlying amnesia produced by protein synthesis inhibitors, calling into question the dominant interpretation that the amnesia reflects loss of training-initiated protein synthesis necessary for memory formation. Instead, the findings suggest that proteins needed for memory formation are available prior to an experience, and that post-translational modifications of these proteins may be sufficient to enable the formation of new memories...|$|R
