In <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> four years, notional amounts outstanding of interest rate swaps and options tripled, and outstanding credit default swaps surged more than ten-fold.

2500|$|The sea ice {{thickness}} {{field and}} accordingly the ice volume and mass, {{is much more}} difficult to determine than the extension. Exact measurements can be made only at a limited number of points. Because of large variations in ice and snow thickness and consistency air- and spaceborne-measurements have to be evaluated carefully. [...] Nevertheless, the studies made support the assumption of a dramatic decline in ice age and thickness. While the Arctic ice area and extent show an accelerating downward trend, arctic ice volume shows an even sharper decline than the ice coverage. Since 1979, the ice volume has shrunk by 80% and in <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> decade the volume declined by 36% in the autumn and 9% in the winter.|$|E

The brief ray of hope for a resurgence under previous coach Clark's one year in 1945 seemed dimmer, but there was still reason to hope.

However, in <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> forty years Sully has grown steadily along the various commercial plastics factory developments and with the wider spread of private car ownership.

50|$|A major {{food source}} for most fish in Lake Michigan had been Diporeia shrimp {{that have been}} {{drastically}} decreased by an infestation of zebra mussels. The Diporeia shrimp have declined from over 10,000 per square meter to virtually zero on the lake bottom because of these zebra mussels. In Lake Michigan the decrease in Diporeia numbers is extreme at 94% killed {{over the past ten}} years.

50|$|There is a fearless {{quality to}} the music of Christopher Paul Stelling. A voice that sounds both old and young, an {{effortless}} yet intricate finger-picking guitar style and lyrics that are both dramatic, and intensely confessional. It’s a sound that channels the restless spirit of a young man who left home to travel the country, haunting and impassioned songs formed by endless nights alone on stage with a guitar, playing to packed houses, other times to nearly empty rooms. Stelling estimates that he’s played over four hundred shows in <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> three years. It places him within a longstanding tradition that serves to nurture ones character and art.|$|E
