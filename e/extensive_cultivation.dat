5|$|The infrageneric {{phylogeny}} of Narcissus {{still remains}} relatively unsettled. The taxonomy has proved very complex {{and difficult to}} resolve, particularly for the Pseudonarcissus group. This {{is due to a}} number of factors, including the diversity of the wild species, the ease with which natural hybridisation occurs, and <b>extensive</b> <b>cultivation</b> and breeding accompanied by escape and naturalisation.|$|E
5|$|The infrageneric {{classification}} {{has been}} even more complex and many schemes of subgenera, sections, subsections and series have been proposed, although all had certain similarities. Most authorities now consider there to be 10 – 11 sections based on phylogenetic evidence. The problems have largely arisen from {{the diversity of the}} wild species, frequent natural hybridisation and <b>extensive</b> <b>cultivation</b> with escape and subsequent naturalisation. The number of species has varied anywhere from 16 to nearly 160, but is probably around 50 – 60.|$|E

25|$|The {{village was}} founded about 1866 by Māori chiefs Te Whiti o Rongomai and Tohu Kākahi on land {{seized by the}} {{government}} during the post-war land confiscations of the 1860s. The population of the village grew to more than 2000, attracting Māori who had been dispossessed of their land by confiscations and impressing European visitors with its cleanliness and industry, and its <b>extensive</b> <b>cultivations</b> producing cash crops as well as food sufficient to feed its inhabitants.|$|R

25|$|<b>Extensive</b> <b>cultivation</b> has {{disturbed}} the habitats of some birds which {{nest and}} {{feed on the}} fescue grassland. However, the horned lark and meadowlark have managed {{to adapt to the}} new conditions. Song sparrow, vesper sparrow, and American goldfinch can often be seen in open areas.|$|E
25|$|The {{rufous-naped lark}} {{is found in}} many parts of sub-Saharan Africa. It has a very large but {{discontinuous}} range, with an estimated global extent of occurrence of 5,600,000km2. Its range is believed to be increasingly fragmented in the north, from which a declining population is inferred. The southern African population has not contracted in range or abundance, save for areas of <b>extensive</b> <b>cultivation</b> or urbanization. Livestock ranching is believed to have created bare patches in grasslands, which they favour. The populations of southern Mozambique and Swaziland have been estimated at >50,000 and 100,000 individuals respectively.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of <b>extensive</b> <b>cultivation</b> of legumes (particularly soy, alfalfa, and clover), growing use of the Haber–Bosch process in the {{creation}} of chemical fertilizers, and pollution emitted by vehicles and industrial plants, human beings have more than doubled the annual transfer of nitrogen into biologically available forms. In addition, humans have significantly contributed to the transfer of nitrogen trace gases from Earth to the atmosphere and from the land to aquatic systems. Human alterations to the global nitrogen cycle are most intense in developed countries and in Asia, where vehicle emissions and industrial agriculture are highest.|$|E
50|$|Tensions {{rose in the}} mid-1840s as {{settlers}} and Māori were left {{to deal with the}} consequences of haphazard and often dubious land purchases by the New Zealand Company. The boundaries of purchased land and Māori reserves were often only vaguely indicated, creating confusion and conflict. The company's purchasing agents seldom questioned the right of vendors to sell the land, whose possession even Māori disputed among themselves and Māori who lived in the Hutt Valley under customary rights were forcefully evicted by the government with little or no compensation for their homes and <b>extensive</b> <b>cultivations.</b>|$|R
50|$|West Rarh's Bagri {{river is}} a fertile, low-lying {{alluvial}} tract. Rice, jute, legumes, oilseeds, wheat, barley, and mangoes are the chief crops in the east; <b>extensive</b> mulberry <b>cultivation</b> {{is carried out}} in the west.|$|R
50|$|In the 19th century, {{planters}} had <b>extensive</b> rice <b>cultivation</b> on {{lands of}} the lower Waccamaw River.

25|$|Bangladesh {{is located}} in the Indomalaya ecozone. Its ecology {{includes}} a long sea coastline, numerous rivers and tributaries, lakes, wetlands, evergreen forests, semi evergreen forests, hill forests, moist deciduous forests, freshwater swamp forests and flat land with tall grass. The Bangladesh Plain is famous for its fertile alluvial soil which supports <b>extensive</b> <b>cultivation.</b> The country is dominated by lush vegetation, with villages often buried in groves of mango, jackfruit, bamboo, betel nut, coconut and date palm. The country has up to 6000 species of plant life, including 5000 flowering plants. Water bodies and wetland systems provide a habitat for many aquatic plants. Water lilies and lotuses grow vividly during the monsoon season. The country has 50 wildlife sanctuaries.|$|E
25|$|Monticello was {{the primary}} {{plantation}} of Thomas Jefferson, the third President of the United States, who began designing and building Monticello at age 26 after inheriting land from his father. Located just outside Charlottesville, Virginia, in the Piedmont region, the plantation was originally , with Jefferson using slaves for <b>extensive</b> <b>cultivation</b> of tobacco and mixed crops, later shifting from tobacco cultivation to wheat in response to changing markets. Due to its architectural and historic significance, the property has been designated a National Historic Landmark. In 1987 Monticello and the nearby University of Virginia, also designed by Jefferson, were together designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The current nickel, a United States coin, features a depiction of Monticello on its reverse side.|$|E
2500|$|Red tide algal blooms (blooms of {{single-celled}} algae) {{known as}} the Peridinium bipes, noticed to proliferate intensely at the Tsukabaru reservoir from the later part of the 1970s, is a serious environmental problem that has received due attention of the agency involved with the project. It is inferred that the algal development is not on account of eutrophication or unusual growth of plankton but is on account of accumulation of stable cyst {{on the surface of}} the reservoir caused due to the process of phototaxis at the inlet end of the reservoir and spread to cover the reservoir surface completely. Its annual occurrence was noted since 1990. This process created <b>extensive</b> <b>cultivation</b> of Peridinium bipes of dinoflagellate, which generated a foul smell and discolored the water surface area thus marring the scenic beauty of the reservoir. This necessitated instituting measures to eradicate the problem. Various alternative treatments were examined, such as cyclic aeration, treatment after collection, use of ozone and ultraviolet irradiation; the ultraviolet irradiation method has been chosen and put into practice. For this purpose a river craft was developed and named as [...] "Red tide treatment ship". With the automated process operated from the ship, the red tides are eliminated almost completely using ultraviolet (UV) irradiation.|$|E

60|$|The large village, at {{the time}} of our visit, was gay with holiday dresses. It is {{surrounded}} by trees, chiefly of banyan, jack, mango, peepul, and tamarind: interminable rice-fields extend on all sides, and except bananas, slender betel-nut palms, and sometimes pawn, or betel-pepper, there is little other <b>extensive</b> <b>cultivation.</b> The rose-apple, orange, and pine-apple are rare, as are cocoa-nuts: there are few date or fan-palms, and only occasionally poor crops of castor-oil and sugar-cane. In the gardens I noticed jasmine, Justicia Adhatoda, Hibiscus, and others of the very commonest Indian ornamental plants; while for food were cultivated Chenopodium, yams, sweet potatos, and more rarely peas, beans, and gourds. Bamboos were planted round the little properties and smaller clusters of houses, in oblong squares, the ridge on which the plants grew being usually bounded by a shallow ditch. The species selected was not the most graceful of its family; the stems, or culms, being densely crowded, erect, as thick at the base as the arm, copiously branching, and very feathery throughout their whole length of sixty feet.|$|E
6000|$|Loiseleur-Deslongchamps (9/45. 'Les Cereales' page 94.) {{has argued}} that, if our cereal {{plants have been}} greatly {{modified}} by cultivation, the weeds which habitually grow mingled with them would have been equally modified. But this argument shows how completely the principle of selection has been overlooked. That such weeds have not varied, or at least do not vary now in any extreme degree, is the opinion of Mr. H.C. Watson and Professor Asa Gray, as they inform me; but who will pretend {{to say that they}} do not vary as much as the individual plants of the same sub-variety of wheat? We have already seen that pure varieties of wheat, cultivated in the same field, offer many slight variations, which can be selected and separately propagated; and that occasionally more strongly pronounced variations appear, which, as Mr. Shirreff has proved, are well worthy of <b>extensive</b> <b>cultivation.</b> Not until equal attention be paid to the variability and selection of weeds, can the argument from their constancy under unintentional culture be of any value. In accordance with the principles of selection we can understand how it is that in the several cultivated varieties of wheat the organs of vegetation differ so little; for if a plant with peculiar leaves appeared, it would be neglected unless the grains of corn were at the same time superior in quality or size. the selection of seed-corn was strongly recommended (9/46. Quoted by Le Couteur page 16.) in ancient times by Columella and Celsus; and as Virgil says,-- ...|$|E
