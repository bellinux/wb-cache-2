40|$|Basically, the {{performance}} of ceramic structure {{is essential for the}} development of ceramic system or component. This performance can be controlled from the early stage i. e preparation of raw material up till the final stage i. e. finishing steps. In this work, ceramic processing parameters at intermediate stage (consolidation) were considered to obtain good properties and structure of alumina ceramic. The microstructure, mechanical and physical properties of the green and sintered alumina ceramic pellets (single and double layer) were investigated. Some modification during consolidation (drying and firing) which focuses on the particle characteristics, <b>drying</b> <b>techniques,</b> additive and types of sintering were conducted. Three <b>drying</b> <b>techniques</b> (room, oven and microwave) were performed to the single and double ceramic alumina. Several factors which are identified as strong influence towards the sintered body i. e. characteristics (particle size and particle size distribution), MgO additive and sintering types (conventional and HIP technique) were selected as controlled parameters during the sintering step. All samples were fabricated using uniaxial press prior to the consolidation stage and were characterized using standard procedures. Based on the observation and measurement, {{it was found that the}} microwave <b>drying</b> <b>technique</b> produced a homogenous and uniform microstructure compared to the other <b>drying</b> <b>techniques</b> for both green and sintered bodies. The density value of 25 μm sintered body (Al 2 O 3) with microwave <b>drying</b> <b>technique</b> shows an increment value from 3. 551 g/cm 3 to 3. 624 g/cm 3 compared to others <b>drying</b> <b>technique.</b> The same phenomena were also observed with the addition of MgO.

40|$|Wheat kernel {{breakage}} is {{a critical}} factor in the flour milling process, and is affected by kernel density. Kernel density measurement is not routinely performed, and depends on the measurement technique used and the moisture content of the grains. This study compared currently available wet and dry methods based on gas displacement and liquid displacement (using water, water-ethanol mixtures and xylene) to determine the density of Hereward (hard) and Consort (soft) wheat kernels of different sizes and moisture contents. A gas pycnometer was used to measure the average density of a sample of wheat kernels, while a double cup system was used to measure individual kernel density by weighing kernels in air and immersed in liquid. The hard wheat variety, Hereward, had kernels of slightly higher average density, with a narrower distribution, than the soft variety, Consort. Kernel density was independent of kernel size, while increasing moisture content decreased the measured kernel density. The <b>dry</b> <b>technique</b> using the gas pycnometer gave the highest kernel densities, followed by xylene immersion, with water immersion giving the lowest density values, lower than the <b>dry</b> <b>technique</b> by 6. 2...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{conjugated}} polymer polypyrrole can {{be useful}} in a lot of applications such as LEDs, solar cells, organic thin film transistors, (bio) sensors, corrosion protection and antistatic layers. However, today, large area coating is still difficult. For this reason, plasma deposition at atmospheric pressure is presented as an alternative synthesis method, because of its possibility for inline processing and in situ doping. Furthermore, plasma polymerization is a more environmental friendly <b>dry</b> <b>technique.</b> Injection of a pyrrole aerosol into a nitrogen plasma and in situ doping by co-injection of NOBF 4 or iodine, results in polymerization and coating deposition.

40|$|A simple {{new device}} for dry {{separation}} of fine particulate matter from bulk soil samples is presented here. It {{consists of a}} stainless steel tube along which a nitrogen flow is imposed, resulting in the displacement of particles. Taking into account particle transport, fluid mechanics, and soil sample composition, a tube 6 -m long, with a 0. 04 -m diameter, was found best adapted for PM 10 separation. The device rapidly produced several milligrams of particulate matter, on which chemical extractions with EDTA were subsequently performed to study the kinetic parameters of extractable metals. New Caledonian mining soils were chosen here, as a case-study. Although the easily extracted metal pool represents only 0. 5 – 6. 4 % of the total metal content for the elements studied (Ni, Co, Mn), the total concentrations are extremely high. This pool is therefore far from negligible, and can be troublesome in the environment. This <b>dry</b> <b>technique</b> for fine particle separation from bulk parent soil eliminates the metal-leaching risks inherent in wet filtration and should therefore ensure safe assessment of environmental quality in fine-textured, metal-contaminated soils...|$|E

The advantage of spray <b>drying</b> <b>technique</b> is not only in the ability to control the product particle size, but also good for the ability of retaining and protecting some of volatile compounds. Since, major content of seaweed is of liquid compounds, therefore, the production of seaweed powder using a spray <b>drying</b> <b>technique</b> was considered an appropriate process technique. In this study, a study on production of powder from Sabah Green Seaweed (Kappaphycus alvarezii) was conducted.

Investigation of mechanical properties of graphene, which are crucial for applications in flexible electronics, performed on bendable synthetic materials, requires a transfer technique using polymers soluble in aliphatic solvents harmless for target polymer substrates. In this study we explore a <b>dry</b> <b>technique</b> using polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) as stamping polymer and polyisobutylene (PIB) layer as graphene-support polymer.
