40|$|Processes in generating, transporting, and dissipating the {{airborne}} dust particles are global phenomena -African dust regularly reaching the Alps; Asian dust seasonally crossing the Pacific into North America, {{and ultimately the}} Atlantic into Europe. One of the vital biogeochemical roles dust storms play in Earth's ecosystem is routinely mobilizing mineral dust, {{as a source of}} iron, from deserts into oceans for fertilizing the growth of phytoplankton -the basis of the oceanic food chain. Similarly, these <b>dust-laden</b> <b>airs</b> also supply crucial nutrients for the soil of tropical rain forests, the so-called womb of life that hosts 50 - 90 % of the species on Earth. With massive amounts of dust lifted from desert regions and injected into the atmosphere, however, these dust storms often affect daily activities in dramatic ways: pushing grit through windows and doors, forcing people to stay indoors, causing breathing problems, reducing visibility and delaying flights, and by and large creating chaos. Thus, both increasing and decreasing concentrations of doses result in harmful biological effects; so do {{the airborne}} dust particles to our Living Earth. Since 1997 NASA has been successfully launching a series of satellites - the Earth Observing System - to intensively study, and gain a better understanding of, the Earth as an integrated system. Through participation in many satellite remote-sensing/retrieval and validation projects over the years, we have gradually developed and refined the SMART (Surface-sensing Measurements for Atmospheric Radiative Transfer) and COMMIT (Chemical, Optical & Microphysical Measurements of In-situ Troposphere) mobile observatories, a suite of surface remote sensing and in-situ instruments that proved to be vital in providing high temporal measurements, which complement the satellite observations. In this talk, we will present SMART-COMMIT which has played key roles, serving as network or supersite, in major international research projects such as the Joint Aerosol Monsoon Experiment (JAMEX), a core element of the Asian Monsoon Years (AMY, 2008 - 2012). SMART-COMMIT deployments during 2008 AMY/JAMEX were conducted in northwestern China to characterize the properties of dust-laden aerosols. In 2009, SMART-COMMIT also participated in the JAMEX/RAJO-MEGHA (Radiation, Aerosol Joint Observations-Monsoon Experiment in the Gangetic-Himalayan Area; Sanskrit for Dust-Cloud) to study the aerosol properties, solar absorption and the associated atmospheric warming, and the climatic impact of elevated aerosols during the premonsoon season in South Asia.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the reconstruction of}} a 73 -year time series of the aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 500  nm at the subtropical high-mountain Izaña Atmospheric Observatory (IZO) located in Tenerife (Canary Islands, Spain). For this purpose, we have combined AOD estimates from artificial neural networks (ANNs) from 1941 to 2001 and AOD measurements directly obtained with a Precision Filter Radiometer (PFR) between 2003 and 2013. The analysis is limited to summer months (July–August–September), when the largest aerosol load is observed at IZO (Saharan mineral dust particles). The ANN AOD time series has been comprehensively validated against coincident AOD measurements performed with a solar spectrometer Mark-I (1984 – 2009) and AERONET (AErosol RObotic NETwork) CIMEL photometers (2004 – 2009) at IZO, obtaining a rather good agreement on a daily basis: Pearson coefficient, R, of 0. 97 between AERONET and ANN AOD, and 0. 93 between Mark-I and ANN AOD estimates. In addition, we have analysed the long-term consistency between ANN AOD time series and long-term meteorological records identifying Saharan mineral dust events at IZO (synoptical observations and local wind records). Both analyses provide consistent results, with correlations [*]>[*]  85  %.

We introduced a new hybrid Lagrangian-Eulerian receptor model, in which air mass residence time probability maps in the geographical domain latitude = [5 °N, 60 °N], longitude = [70 °W, 30 °E] were combined with TOMS-AI data (TAPI Index), and with simulated Total Suspended Particles (TSP) with the BSC/DREAM model (SDPI Index). Both approaches show a good agreement. For dust gravitational settlement episodes within the MBL, the dust sources are located in southernmost latitudes compared to those associated with lower air mass transport. A seasonal variability in potential dust sources is found with both approaches, TAPI and SDPI. In winter, most dust sources are located within the Sahara in an area bounded by latitude = [18 °N, 35 °N], longitude = [15 °W, 15 °E].

40|$|This machine cuts coal along a {{longwall}} face extending up to 500 feet by a rotating auger with bits. The machine also transports the coal that is cut acting as screw conveyor. By virtue of an integral shroud comprising {{part of the}} conveyor the machine is also amenable to a separation of the zones where men work from air being contaminated by dust and methane gas by the cutting action. Beginning as single intake air courses, the air separates at the working section where one split provides fresh air to the Occupied Zone (OZ) for human needs and the other split purges and carries away dust and methane from face fragmentation in the Cutting Zone (CZ). The attractiveness of the Variable Wall Mining Machine is that it addresses the limitations of current longwall mining equipment: it can consistently out-produce continuous mining machines and most longwall shearing machines. It also is amenable to configuring an environment, the dual-duct system, where the air for human breathing is separated from <b>dust-laden</b> ventilating <b>air</b> with methane mixtures. The objective of the research was to perform a mathematical and experimental study of the interrelationships {{of the components of}} the system so that a computer model could demonstrate the workings of the system in an animation program. The analysis resulted in the compilation of the parameters for three different configurations of a dual aircourse system of ventilating underground mines. In addressing the goal of an inherently safe mining system the dual-duct adaptation to the Variable Wall Mining Machine appears to offer the path to solution. The respirable dust problem is solvable; the explosive dust problem is nearly solvable; and the explosive methane problem can be greatly reduced.

40|$|Primary {{productivity}} of continental and marine ecosystems is often limited or co-limited by phosphorus. Deposition of atmospheric aerosols provides the major external source of phosphorus to marine surface waters.

Acid mobilization is expected to be pronounced where polluted and <b>dust-laden</b> <b>air</b> masses mix. Our hypothesis is supported by the soluble compositions and reconstructed pH values for atmospheric particulate matter samples collected over a 5 -yr period at Finokalia, Crete. In addition, at least tenfold increase in soluble phosphorus was observed when Saharan soil and dust were acidified in laboratory experiments which simulate atmospheric conditions. Aerosol acidification links bioavailable phosphorus supply to anthropogenic and natural acidic gas emissions, and may be a key regulator of ocean biogeochemistry.

The flights included constant altitude measurements in the boundary layer as well as profiles up to 3800 m providing detailed chemical information about {{the composition of the}} aerosol distribution in the lower troposphere. Three cases with different air mass origins — clean marine air, anthropogenically-influenced air from the European continent, and <b>dust-laden</b> <b>air</b> from the Sahara — were identified. The samples were analyzed by ion chromatography (IC) for ionic species, by combined thermal and optical analysis (TOA) for organic carbon, and by total reflection X-ray fluorescence (TXRF) for elemental composition. Particle composition and size distributions for the range of air masses encountered illustrate links in the chemical and microphysical characteristics of aerosol from different sources. Clean marine air masses were characterized by low particle number and mass concentrations with no detectable metals, while anthropogenically-influenced and <b>dust-laden</b> <b>air</b> had high number, mass, and trace metal concentrations. Anthropogenic sources were characterized by high concentrations of submicron particles and some Fe and Cu, whereas dust particle loadings included a significant mass of micron-sized particles and significant loadings of Fe, in addition to small amounts of Mn, Cu, and Ni. These results showed similar tracers for air mass origin as those found in other measurements of oceanic and continental air masses. Aerosol optical properties were estimated with a simplified model of the aerosol based on the measured compositions. The real and imaginary refractive indices and single scattering albedos differed significantly among the three types of aerosol measured, with clean marine aerosol properties showing the least absorption and dust-containing aerosols showing the most. There were only small differences in optical properties for the two different cases of clean marine aerosol, but some {{significant differences between the two}} dust cases. Since measurement uncertainties affect these calculations, we studied the type of mixing and the fraction of absorbing species and found the calculation was sensitive to these variations only for the dust-containing aerosol case, probably due to the small amount of water present.

40|$|Underground {{coal mining}} {{companies}} that operate continuous miner sections often {{apply to the}} Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) for approval to take extended cuts to depths of up to 40 ft {{as a means of}} improving productivity. Historically, MSHA has granted approval of this practice if the mine has successfully demonstrated the ability to control the roof, methane, and respirable dust while extracting these extended cuts. A key component for controlling dust generated by continuous miners in 40 -ft cuts has been the utilization of flooded-bed scrubbers. These fan-powered scrubbers pull <b>dust-laden</b> <b>air</b> from the mining face and remove respirable dust particles by passing the collected air through a wetted filter panel. The filtered air is then discharged back into the mine atmosphere. To effectively use scrubbers in faces that employ exhaust ventilation, the return ventilation curtain or tubing should be located outby the scrubber discharge on the continuous miner, which results in a setback distance from the face of approximately 40 ft. Over the last several years, MSHA has emphasized that mines demonstrate effective dust control before granting approvals for taking extended cuts with extended curtain setbacks. Each mine operator must successfully demonstrate control of workers 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 dust exposures in standard 20 -ft cuts before MSHA considers approving extended cuts.

Profiles of backscatter and extinction coefficients, lidar ratios, and backscatter-related Ångström exponents (wavelength pair 355 / 532 nm) were measured at Gwangju. Linear particle depolarization ratios were used to identify East Asian dust layers. We used backward trajectory modelling to identify the pathway and the vertical position of <b>dust-laden</b> <b>air</b> masses over China during long-range transport. Most cases of Asian dust events can be described by the emission of dust in desert areas and subsequent transport over highly polluted regions of China. The Asian dust plumes could be categorized into two classes according to the height above ground in which these plumes were transported: (I) the dust layers passed over China at high altitude levels until arrival over Gwangju, and (II) the Asian dust layers were transported near the surface and the lower troposphere over industrialized areas before they arrived over Gwangju. We find that the optical characteristics of these mixed Asian dust layers over Gwangju differ in dependence of their vertical position above ground over China and the change of height above ground during transport. The mean linear particle depolarization ratio was 0. 21 ± 0. 06 (at 532 nm), the mean lidar ratios were 52 ± 7 sr at 355 nm and 53 ± 8 sr at 532 nm, and the mean Ångström exponent was 0. 74 ± 0. 31 in case I. In contrast, plumes transported at lower altitudes (case II) showed low depolarization ratios, and higher lidar ratio and Ångström exponents. The mean linear particle depolarization ratio was 0. 13 ± 0. 04, the mean lidar ratios were 63 ± 9 sr at 355 nm and 62 ± 8 sr at 532 nm, respectively, and the mean Ångström exponent was 0. 98 ± 0. 51. These numbers show that the optical characteristics of mixed Asian plumes are more similar to optical characteristics of urban pollution. We find a decrease of the linear depolarization ratio of the mixed dust/pollution plume in dependence of transport time if the pollution layer travelled over China at low heights, i. e., below approximately 3 km above ground. In contrast we do not find such a trend if the dust plumes travelled at heights above 4 km over China.

We used backward trajectory modeling to identify the pathway and the vertical position of <b>dust-laden</b> <b>air</b> masses over China during long-range transport. Most cases of Asian dust events can be described by the emission of dust in desert areas and subsequent transport over highly polluted regions of China. The Asian dust plumes could be categorized into two classes according to the height above ground at which these plumes were transported: (case I) the dust layers passed over China at high altitude levels (> 3 km) until arrival over Gwangju, and (case II) the Asian dust layers were transported near the surface and within the lower troposphere (< 3 km) over industrialized areas before they arrived over Gwangju. We find that the optical characteristics of these mixed Asian dust layers over Gwangju differ depending on their vertical position above ground over China and the change of height above ground during transport. The mean linear particle depolarization ratio was 0. 21 ?? 0. 06 (at 532 nm), the mean lidar ratios were 52 ?? 7 sr at 355 nm and 53 ?? 8 sr at 532 nm, and the mean ??ngstr??m exponent was 0. 74 ?? 0. 31 for case I. In contrast, plumes transported at lower altitudes (case II) showed low depolarization ratios (0. 13 ?? 0. 04 at 532 nm), and higher lidar ratio (63 ?? 9 sr at 355 nm and 62 ?? 8 sr at 532 nm) and ??ngstr??m exponents (0. 98 ?? 0. 51). These numbers show that the optical characteristics of mixed Asian plumes are more similar to optical characteristics of urban pollution. We find a decrease of the linear depolarization ratio of the mixed dust/pollution plume depending on transport time if the pollution layer traveled over China at low heights, i. e., below approximately 3 km above ground. In contrast, we do not find such a trend if the dust plumes traveled at heights above 3 km over China. We need a longer time series of lidar measurements {{in order to determine}} in a quantitative way the change of optical properties of dust with transport time...|$|E
40|$|Worker {{exposure}} to coal dust in underground mines remains a major health hazard. This research has: 1) Analyzed the wetting characteristics {{of less than}} 10 micron dust particles using a novel micro-emulsion technology (MET) at bench scale and prototype scale with emphasis on agglomeration of dust particles, and 2) Simulate airflow and dust dispersion patterns on a longwall mining face using CFD modeling techniques to compare the current and proposed spatial distributions of water sprays around a longwall shearer. With the “Final Dust Rule” adopted by MSHA in 2014 and slated to go into full effect August 16, 2016, this research is {{a significant contribution to}} the coal industry. A suitable micro-emulsion containing 0. 2 % oil and 0. 0125 % didodecyl-dimethyl-ammonium bromide (DDAB) was identified. For assessing the wettability of coal dusts, a slightly modified version of “Fixed Time Wettability” or FTW (Chugh et al., 2004) was employed. These wettability tests however, did not yeild true wettability using the MET. An analysis for both unwetted and wetted portions of coal dust using particle size distribution curves (PSD) confirmed agglomeration when treated with the emulsion. For the unwetted portion, 96. 6 % of the particles had sizes greater than 25 μm after treatment with MET. Similar data for wetted dust was 100 %. Experiemental studies in a 4 ft x 4 ft x 10 ft chamber showed 12 - 15 % improvement in respirable dust when using MET as compared to water alone [...] Validated computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models were used to study airflow patterns and the interaction between sprays and airflow for designing both engineering and administrative controls around a longwall face. Two important zones – low air velocity (LAV) and recirculation (RC) – were identified around the model of a longwall face. These zones were located: 1) Behind the headgate drum and 2) Above the shearer chassis. Analysis of a modified geometric configuration of sprays on the shearer chassis showed improved coverage for wetting the dust on the longwall face. Numerical modeling comparisons were made between current spray systems and spray systems proposed by Dr. Y. P. Chugh using the concepts of “Continuous and Discrete Phase Modeling”. Analyses included changes in airflow patterns caused by spray systems and dust dispersion tracks generated from the cutting face. Chugh’s spray system was able to effectively eliminate RC zones existing above the shearer body, thereby minimizing the extent to which coal dust enters the walkway of the longwall face where workers are located. The proposed spray system used concepts of multiple wetting points for dust, air-locks, and venturi to wet the dust and direct the <b>dust-laden</b> <b>air</b> from mine workers. These improvements can be used in longwall mines as engineering controls for meeting new dust control standards...|$|E
