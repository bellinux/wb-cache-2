40|$|The {{research}} considers and analyzes {{vibration isolation}} systems, whose design schemes are single {{degree of freedom}} systems, including nonlinear elements - <b>displacement</b> <b>limiter</b> and viscous damper. Presented are calculation formulas in closed form for linear systems in operational modes (for harmonic and impulse loads), algorithms and examples of calculation of linear and nonlinear systems in operational and transient modes. The calculation method and the above dependences are written using the transfer (TF) and impulse response functions (IRF) of linear dynamical systems and dependencies that determine {{the relationship between these}} functions. The effectiveness of 2 options of vibration isolation systems in transient modes is analyzed. There is significant reduction of load from the equipment to the supporting structures in the starting-stopping modes by the use of <b>displacement</b> <b>limiter...</b>|$|E
40|$|Nonlinear {{dynamics}} of a bouncing ball moving in gravitational field and colliding with a moving <b>limiter</b> is considered. <b>Displacement</b> of the <b>limiter</b> is a quadratic function of time. Several dynamical modes, such as fixed points, 2 - cycles and chaotic bands are studied analytically and numerically. It is shown that chaotic bands appear due to homoclinic structures created from unstable 2 - cycles in a corner-type bifurcation. Comment: 11 pages, 6 figure...|$|R
40|$|Nonlinear {{dynamics}} of a bouncing ball moving vertically in a gravitational field and colliding with a moving limiter is considered and the Poincare map, describing evolution from an impact {{to the next}} impact, is described. <b>Displacement</b> of the <b>limiter</b> is assumed as periodic, cubic function of time. Due to simplicity of this function analytical computations are possible. Several dynamical modes, such as fixed points, 2 - cycles and chaotic bands are studied analytically and numerically. It is shown that chaotic bands are created from fixed points after first period doubling in a corner-type bifurcation. Equation for {{the time of the}} next impact is solved exactly for the case of two subsequent impacts occurring in the same period of limiter's motion making analysis of chattering possible.
