5|$|Lennon {{played a}} mouth organ during a bus journey {{to visit his}} cousin in Scotland; the music caught the driver's ear. Impressed, the driver told Lennon of a {{harmonica}} he could have <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> to Edinburgh the following day, where one had been stored in the bus depot since a passenger left it on a bus. The professional instrument quickly replaced Lennon's toy. He would continue to play harmonica, often using the instrument during the Beatles' Hamburg years, {{and it became a}} signature sound in the group's early recordings. His mother taught him how to play the banjo, later buying him an acoustic guitar. At 16, he played rhythm guitar with the Quarrymen.|$|E
25|$|In addition, {{there were}} serious accusations that federal {{officials}} had not earnestly tried {{to negotiate with}} the hostage-takers (including the alleged threat from Moscow to arrest President Dzasokhov <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> to negotiate) and deliberately provided incorrect and inconsistent reports of the situation to the media.|$|E

As of now, however, he has yet to mention if he has any ideas for a third film since the interview.|$|E

25|$|The Packers were {{scheduled}} to retire Favre's #4 jersey in a ceremony {{during the first week}} of the season. However, on July 2, 2008, he publicly indicated that he wanted to play again as the starting quarterback. On July 11, 2008, Favre sent a letter to the Packers management asking for an unconditional release which will allow him to play for another team. The Packers did not give it to him, but they were unwilling to release him for fear that he would sign with division rival Minnesota Vikings (Favre's choice for an alternate team). Also, the Packers would not start him as quarterback <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> back to the team, and named the other Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers as the starting quarterback and Favre as the backup.|$|E
25|$|The abbey we {{now know}} as Vale Royal was founded by Prince Edward, the future Edward I, prior to his {{accession}} to the throne. In 1263 the prince was undertaking a sea voyage from France when his ship {{was caught in a}} terrible storm. He then made a vow that <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> safe to land he would found an abbey of unprecedented size and grandeur as a thanksgiving to God for saving him. Political problems and civil war meant that the vow could not be fulfilled immediately, but by 1266 negotiations were in hand {{for the establishment of a}} monastery of Cistercian monks in the secluded location of Darnhall in Cheshire. In August 1270, Edward granted a charter to his new abbey along with an endowment of lands and churches.|$|E

25|$|Temporary {{migrant workers}} in Russia {{consists}} of about 7 million people, {{most of the}} temporary workers come from Central Asia the Balkans and East Asia. Most of them work in the construction, cleaning and in the household industries. They primary live {{in cities such as}} Moscow, Sochi and Blagoveshchensk. While worker migrants are opposed by most Russians, the mayor of Moscow said that Moscow cannot do without worker migrants. New laws are in place that require worker migrants to be fluent in Russian, know Russian history and laws. The Russian Opposition and most of the Russian population opposes worker migration, Alexei Navalny stated that <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> to power he would introduce a Visa regime to non-Eurasian Union countries in the former Soviet Union and have a Visa free regime with the European Union and The West to attract skilled migrants. The problem of worker migration has become so severe it has caused a rise in Russian nationalism, and spawned groups like Movement Against Illegal Immigration.|$|E
25|$|Codreanu {{had to go}} into hiding, {{waiting for}} things to calm down and delegating {{leadership}} to General Gheorghe Cantacuzino-Grănicerul, who later assumed partial guilt for Duca's killing; Stelescu, who soon became Codreanu's adversary as head of the Crusade of Romanianism, later alleged that he had been given refuge by a cousin of Magda Lupescu, Carol's mistress, implying that the Guard was becoming corrupt ("She was a person adverse to your action. How did you get along so well?"). Codreanu's resurgence brought arrest and prosecution under the martial law imposed in the country; he was acquitted yet again. Despite Codreanu's attacks on the elite as hopelessly corrupt and self-serving, at his trial in 1934 a number of respected politicians like Gheorghe I. Brătianu, Alexandru Vaida-Voevod and Constantin Argetoianu testified for Codreanu as character witnesses. The Iron Guard did have some links to the Nazi Party's foreign office under Alfred Rosenberg, but in 1933–34 the Romanian fascist that was the main beneficiary of financial support from Rosenberg was Codreanu's rival Octavian Goga who lacked Codreanu's mass following and thus was more biddable. A further issue for the Nazis was concern over Codreanu's statements that Romania had too many minorities for its own good, which led to fears that Codreanu might persecute the volksdeutsch minority <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> to power. But the connections between the NSDAP and the Iron Guard, as limited as they were, did add to the Legion's appeal as the Iron Guard was associated in the public mind with the apparently dynamic and successful society of Nazi Germany.|$|E

500|$|In April 1890, it was {{announced}} in The Colonist that Wilson was leaving Launceston to move to Melbourne. He had been recruited by Major Wardill, {{the secretary of the}} Melbourne Cricket Club, who offered Wilson a [...] "lucrative position" [...] at a Melbourne branch of the National Bank of Australasia <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> to play for the cricket club and the Melbourne Football Club, with which the cricket club had a close affiliation.

500|$|In 1980 the Communist Party of Peru, {{known as}} the Shining Path, {{launched}} an insurgency against the government of Peru. This conflict followed Maoist tactics of guerrilla warfare. In 1983, Gagnon met {{with members of the}} Peruvian government to let them know about the difficulties in Cutivireni. While he was meeting with authorities in Lima, members of the Shining Path burned down the mission and threatened that they would kill him <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> back in May 1984. [...] The Franciscans who were working with the Asháninka did not have a coordinated strategy to provide for their defense, but Gagnon was able to secure weapons from the Peruvian army, and approached the United States military for support as well.|$|E
500|$|Calvin and Servetus {{were first}} brought into contact in 1546 through a common acquaintance, Jean Frellon of Lyon; they {{exchanged}} letters debating doctrine; Calvin used a pseudonym as Charles d' Espeville; Servetus left his unsigned. Eventually, Calvin lost patience {{and refused to}} respond; by this time Servetus had written around thirty letters to Calvin. Calvin was particularly outraged when Servetus sent him {{a copy of the}} Institutes of the Christian Religion heavily annotated with arguments pointing to errors in the book. When Servetus mentioned that he would come to Geneva, [...] "Espeville" [...] (Calvin) wrote a letter to Farel on 13 February 1546 noting that if Servetus were to come, he would not assure him safe conduct: [...] "for <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>came,</b> as far as my authority goes, I would not let him leave alive." ...|$|E

500|$|Ahmose's reign can {{be fairly}} {{accurately}} dated using the Heliacal rise of Sirius in his successor's reign, {{but because of}} disputes over from where the observation was made, he has been assigned a reign from 1570–1546, 1560–1537 and 1551–1527 by various sources. Manetho supposedly gives Ahmose a reign of 25 years and 4 months (but, as Manetho called the first ruler of his dynasty [...] "Tethmosis", he probably intended someone else). [...] This figure is seemingly supported by a 'Year 22' inscription from his reign at the stone quarries of Tura. A medical examination of his mummy indicates that he {{died when he was}} about thirty-five, supporting a 25-year reign <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> to the throne at the age of 10. The radiocarbon date range for the start of his reign is 1570–1544 BC, the mean point of which is 1557 BC.|$|E
500|$|... {{the cruel}} oppressions of this kingdom by England {{are not to}} be borne. You send what books you please hither, and the booksellers here can send nothing to you that is written here.

But I am so incensed against the oppresions from England, and have so little regard to the laws they make, that I do, as a clergyman, encourage the merchants both to export wool and woollen manufactures to any country in Europe, or anywhere else, and conceal it from the Custom-house officers, as I would hide my purse from a highwayman, <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> to rob me on the road, although England hath made a law to the contrary; and so I would encourage our booksellers here to sell your author's books printed here, and send them to all the towns in England, if I could do it with safety and profit; because I repeat, it is no offence against God, or the laws of the country I live in.|$|E
500|$|Gough and Millar {{had five}} months for casting, but their primary {{focus was on}} finding an actor to play Clark Kent. They {{received}} Kristin Kreuk's audition tape {{for the role of}} Lana Lang and liked it so much that they immediately showed her to the network. Tom Welling, after twice turning down the producers' attempts to get him to audition for the role of Clark Kent, eventually accepted the opportunity {{to be part of the}} show. It was David Nutter who finally convinced Welling to read the script for the pilot, after finding Welling's picture in a photo album at the casting director's office. Welling's manager did not want him to take the role because it could hurt his feature film career, but Welling liked the script and agreed to come in for an audition. Welling's reason for turning down the role was because the producers were keeping quiet on what the show was really about, which left him with the impression the show was going to be [...] "Superman in high school", something he did not want to do. Nutter promised to let Welling read the script <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> in and auditioned. After auditioning, Welling was given the script to read, which he thought was [...] "amazing". For one of his auditions, he read the graveyard scene, from the pilot, with Kristin Kreuk; the network thought they had [...] "great chemistry". No one could agree on which actors had the best audition for Lex Luthor. Michael Rosenbaum auditioned twice, and, believing he did not take his first audition seriously, outlined a two-and-a-half-page scene from the pilot. He indicated all the places to be funny, charismatic, or menacing, and performed so well that everyone agreed he was [...] "the guy".|$|E

During Vladimir's interrogation of the boy, he asks <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> the day before, making it apparent {{that the two men}} have been waiting for a long period and will likely continue.

2500|$|In 1956, Unitas {{joined the}} Baltimore Colts of the NFL under legendary coach Weeb Ewbank, after being asked {{at the last}} minute to join Bloomfield Rams lineman Jim Deglau, a Croatian steel worker with a life much like Unitas', at the latter's {{scheduled}} Colts tryout. The pair borrowed money from friends to pay for the gas to make the trip. Deglau later told a reporter after Unitas' death, [...] " [...] uncle told him not to come. [...] was worried that <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> down and the Colts passed on him, it would look bad (to other NFL teams)." [...] The Colts signed Unitas, much to the chagrin of the Cleveland Browns, who had hoped to claim the rejected Steeler quarterback.|$|E
