40|$|This article {{examines}} strategies to reduce nonresponse rates among <b>ethnic</b> <b>minorities.</b> The authors review nonresponse rates {{and data collection}} strategies among <b>ethnic</b> <b>minorities</b> with respect to response rates and response bias in six European countries. The national statistical institutes of these six countries use different definitions of <b>ethnic</b> <b>minorities.</b> This is why the definitions of <b>ethnic</b> <b>minorities</b> {{and their impact on}} the number of members of <b>ethnic</b> <b>minorities</b> in the six countries are compared. Nonresponse rates are usually higher among <b>ethnic</b> <b>minorities</b> than among the native population. Dissecting the nonresponse phenomenon shows that contact rates among <b>ethnic</b> <b>minorities</b> are lower, nonresponse due to an inability to produce the required information is higher, and cooperation rates are higher among <b>ethnic</b> <b>minorities</b> than among the native population. Increasing the response rates among <b>ethnic</b> <b>minorities</b> should focus on enhancing the contact rate and reducing the number of nonrespondents who are unable to produce the required information.

40|$|Last year a {{study on}} <b>ethnic</b> <b>minorities</b> as sources in the Danish news shows that this group is {{underrepresented}} compared to how many <b>ethnic</b> <b>minorities</b> {{there are in the}} Danish society. 	This thesis examines why this group is underrepresented by asking journalists who produce the news and select the sources. The analysis is based on qualitative interviews with seven journalists from two TV-stations broadcasting national TV-news. 	In the journalists’ perspective, there are several editorial challenges regarding the use of <b>ethnic</b> <b>minorities</b> as sources. News criteria such as identification, simplicity and representation restrain the journalists from using <b>ethnic</b> <b>minorities</b> as sources – particularly in news-stories where the source represent the 'ordinary citizen'. The journalists prefer to use <b>ethnic</b> <b>minorities</b> as sources in news-stories that deal with <b>ethnic</b> <b>minorities.</b> There seem to be some organisational guidelines which affect the journalists’ choice of <b>ethnic</b> <b>minorities</b> as sources. At the same time journalistic latent understandings of how <b>ethnic</b> <b>minorities</b> is best used as a case in a news-story – and the journalists own bias – make them deselect <b>ethnic</b> <b>minorities</b> as sources. 	Furthermore this thesis discusses which steps are necessary for these news-routines to change. It seems that it might be the organisations which should make guidelines on increasing the use of <b>ethnic</b> <b>minorities</b> as sources – because the journalists are afraid of their position at their workplace if they step outside the organisational guidelines. 	It is also discussed whether the journalists themselves should make active choices on increasing their use of <b>ethnic</b> <b>minorities</b> and thereby make a change in the population’s perception on how <b>ethnic</b> <b>minorities</b> are used as sources in the news...|$|R

40|$|The {{construction}} workforce in Hong Kong {{is experiencing}} a severe ageing problem and labour shortage. One initiative to enhance the supply of manpower is to assist <b>ethnic</b> <b>minorities</b> joining the industry.

Statistics show that <b>ethnic</b> <b>minorities</b> were nearly 30 % more likely to have work-related injuries than local workers in some developed countries. However, official statistics on the safety of <b>ethnic</b> <b>minorities</b> are not available in Hong Kong. A search in newspaper archive revealed that <b>ethnic</b> <b>minorities</b> in the construction industry of Hong Kong are subjected to higher fatality rate than local workers, just {{as is the case in}} many developed countries. This reflects that the safety of <b>ethnic</b> <b>minorities</b> has not received the attention it rightly deserves. Safety communication has been one of the key factors leading to accidents.

40|$|Objectives To {{explore how}} <b>ethnic</b> <b>minorities</b> {{at risk of}} vitamin D {{deficiency}} are constructed in Danish policy documents (current as of April 2009), regarding vitamin D supplementation. Methods Ten policy documents were analysed through content analysis, focusing on definitions and explanations of <b>ethnic</b> <b>minorities</b> being at risk of vitamin D deficiency. This {{formed the basis for}} an analysis of constructions of <b>ethnic</b> <b>minorities</b> at risk which was undertaken using the Social Construction of Technology (SCOT) theory as an organising framework. Results The analysis showed a high degree of interpretative flexibility regarding how <b>ethnic</b> <b>minorities</b> are constructed as a risk group for vitamin D deficiency. The ten documents analysed revealed eight different constructions of the <b>ethnic</b> <b>minorities</b> groups at risk. A low degree of interpretative flexibility was found regarding the importance of skin colour and skin covering. Major disagreements were found regarding the importance attributed to the Islamic religion, other traditions, immigration, gender and age, and use of an evolutionary explanation for the increased risk. Conclusions <b>Ethnic</b> <b>minorities</b> at risk of vitamin D deficiency are constructed very differently in Danish policies current as of April 2009.

5|$|Tradition and old records {{assert that}} {{southern}} Somalia, including the Mogadishu area, was inhabited very early by hunter-gatherers of Khoisan descent.

By the time of the arrival of peoples from the Cushitic Rahanweyn (Digil and Mirifle) clan confederacy, who would go on to establish a local aristocracy, other Cushitic groups affiliated with the Oromo (Wardai) and Ajuuraan (Ma'adanle) had already formed settlements of their own in the sub-region.|$|E

Key policies that Khan proposed included a London 'living rent'; a quota system for <b>ethnic</b> <b>minority</b> officers in the Metropolitan Police; increased home building; and a campaign for a London Living Wage. Commentators raised Khan's Muslim religion as a potential barrier to election, after a poll (not mentioning Khan by name) suggested that 31% of Londoners would be 'uncomfortable' with a Muslim mayor. Khan, who was London's first Muslim MP, argued that the election of a Muslim could encourage London to become recognised as a more cosmopolitan city. While Khan had stated that he would serve a full term as MP for Tooting if he were to become Mayor of London, he later announced that would stand down as MP for Tooting if he were elected Mayor.|$|E
40|$|Purpose - The paper aims to {{discover}} {{the role of the}} middle classes {{in the development of the}} <b>ethnic</b> <b>minorities</b> of China, given the importance of the middle classes in international economic development in the modern age. Design/methodology/approach - The paper offers a definition of the "middle classes", including both the economic and political aspects. It looks at these classes among the <b>ethnic</b> <b>minorities</b> of China through fieldwork and printed statistics and materials. Findings - The <b>ethnic</b> <b>minorities</b> were 8. 41 per cent of the total population of China, according to the 2000 census. The paper finds that there are emerging middle classes among the <b>ethnic</b> <b>minorities,</b> especially some of them, including the Uygurs and Koreans of China. These middle classes are centres of entrepreneurship among the <b>ethnic</b> <b>minorities,</b> promoting development and modernization, but also intensifying inequalities. Their role is mainly economic, but also political; for example, there is some material on the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in general and among the <b>ethnic</b> <b>minorities</b> in particular. There is some discussion on literacy and education among the <b>ethnic</b> <b>minorities,</b> on the grounds that middle classes do not emerge in the modern age without education. Originality/value - Although there is some research on the role of the middle classes in recent Chinese development, this is the first time that such a concept has been applied to the <b>ethnic</b> <b>minorities.</b> No Full Tex...|$|R
