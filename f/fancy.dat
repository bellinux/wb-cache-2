5|$|<b>Fancy</b> rats {{care for}} themselves, {{and are thus}} very {{affordable}} compared to even other small pets. This {{is one of the}} biggest draws to them. Additionally, <b>fancy</b> rats are quite independent, loyal and easily trained, earning them comparison to both cats and dogs. This comparison is merited given <b>fancy</b> rats are considered more intelligent than any other domesticated rodent.|$|E
5|$|<b>Fancy</b> rats {{have their}} origins as the targets for blood sport in 18th- and 19th-century Europe. Specially bred as pets since then, <b>fancy</b> rats now {{come in a}} wide variety of colors and coat types and are bred and raised by several rat enthusiast groups around the world. <b>Fancy</b> rats are {{commonly}} sold as pets in stores and by breeders.|$|E
5|$|Because R. norvegicus {{and related}} species {{are seen as}} pests, their {{intentional}} import into foreign countries is often regulated. For example, the importation of foreign rodents is prohibited in Australia, and so various coat types, colors, and varieties have been bred separately from foreign lines, or are just not obtainable within that country (for example, hairless and dumbo-eared <b>fancy</b> rats do not exist in Australia). In other areas, like the Canadian province of Alberta, which is considered rat-free, the ownership of domestic <b>fancy</b> rats outside of schools, laboratories, and zoos is illegal.|$|E

5|$|The painting's {{depiction}} of {{preparation for a}} <b>fancy</b> dress party would have been familiar to Etty's generally wealthy audience. In both London and the English provincial cities, such balls and parties had become extremely fashionable by the 1830s. Though conservative in comparison to some costumes worn at contemporary <b>fancy</b> dress events, {{the richness of the}} design of the sisters' dress indicates the high status of the Williams-Wynn family in fashionable circles.|$|E

5|$|Preparing for a <b>Fancy</b> Dress Ball was one {{of eight}} works {{exhibited}} by Etty at the 1835 Royal Academy Summer Exhibition, the others being The Bridge of Sighs, Phaedria and Cymochles on the Idle Lake, Study from a Young Lady: A York Beauty, Study of the Head of a Youth, Venus and her Satellites, The Warrior Arming and Wood Nymphs Sleeping: Satyr Bringing Flowers. Art historian Sarah Burnage believes Etty's choice of Venus and her Satellites may have been {{to draw attention to}} similarities with Preparing for a <b>Fancy</b> Dress Ball and possibly to link the Williams-Wynn sisters' beauty with the legendary Venus.|$|E
5|$|Speaking in 1994, Pintilie {{indicated}} that he was considering a sequel to the film, also based on Dumitriu's writings. Planned for 1996, it was to depict an aging and jealous Marie-Thérèse, who intervenes in her son's love life and chases away women who <b>fancy</b> him.|$|E

5|$|The body {{structure}} of domesticated rats {{differs from that}} of a wild rat as well. The body of a <b>fancy</b> rat is smaller, with larger ears and a longer tail than that of its undomesticated counterpart. They are generally smaller with sharper facial features as well.|$|E

5|$|Although Etty painted {{many private}} portraits {{of his friends}} and acquaintances, he {{produced}} very few publicly exhibited portraits, fewer than 30 of which were shown during his lifetime. Portraiture was seen as a vulgar and generally worthless form of painting throughout much of the 19th century, and portrait painters continued to be disparaged as a greedy and unimaginative group who survived by feeding the vanity of the emerging middle class. Other than Preparing for a <b>Fancy</b> Dress Ball, critics generally disliked his portraits, preferring his history paintings in spite of reservations over his depictions of nudity. Preparing for a <b>Fancy</b> Dress Ball did, however, serve as an indication that Etty could successfully paint works as commissions for the English elite, boosting his status and leading to further commissions. Etty died in November 1849 and soon fell from fashion; by the late 19th century the cost of all his paintings had fallen below their original prices. Charlotte Williams-Wynn became a noted letter writer and diarist; Mary Williams-Wynn married Member of Parliament James Milnes Gaskell. Both Charlotte and Mary died in April 1869.|$|E
5|$|Although it {{was popular}} with {{travelling}} vendors, particularly of small <b>fancy</b> goods, {{the maintenance of}} the market cross was costly and unpopular with Norwich's citizens. In 1732 the cross was demolished, and the stone was sold for £125. In 2005 the base of the cross was rediscovered in excavations during renovation of the market area, but has since been re-covered. Its site is now outlined in red stones embedded in the market floor.|$|E

5|$|Diamond {{enhancements}} {{are specific}} treatments performed on natural or synthetic diamonds (usually those already cut and polished into a gem), which {{are designed to}} better the gemological characteristics of the stone {{in one or more}} ways. These include laser drilling to remove inclusions, application of sealants to fill cracks, treatments to improve a white diamond's color grade, and treatments to give <b>fancy</b> color to a white diamond.|$|E
5|$|Domesticated rats are physiologically {{and psychologically}} {{different}} from their wild relatives, and—when acquired from reputable breeders and shops—pose no more of a health risk than other common pets. For example, domesticated brown rats are not considered a disease threat, while exposure to wild rat populations could introduce pathogens like Salmonella into the home. <b>Fancy</b> rats experience different health risks from their wild counterparts, and thus {{are less likely to}} succumb to many of the same illnesses as wild rats.|$|E
