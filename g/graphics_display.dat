The {{projection}} screens were revamped (with one large screen behind Stewart, while the smaller one behind the interview subject remained the same), a large, global map directly behind Stewart, {{a more open}} studio floor, and a J-shaped desk supported at one end by a globe. The intro was also updated; the <b>graphics,</b> <b>display</b> names, dates, and logos were all changed.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} two documented first-person shooter {{video games}} are Maze War and Spasim. Maze War features on-foot gameplay that evokes modern first-person shooter games. Development {{of the game}} began in 1973 and its exact date of completion is unknown. Spasim had a documented debut at the University of Illinois in 1974. The game was a rudimentary space flight simulator, which featured a first-person perspective. They were distinct from modern first-person shooters, involving simple tile-based movement where the player could only move from square to square and turn in 90-degree increments. Spasim led to more detailed combat flight simulators and eventually to a tank simulator, developed for the U.S. Army, in the later 1970s. These games were not available to consumers, however, {{and it was not}} until 1980 that a tank video game, Battlezone, was released in arcades. A version of the game was released in 1983 for home computers and became the first successful mass-market game featuring a first-person viewpoint and wireframe 3D graphics, presented using a vector <b>graphics</b> <b>display.</b>|$|E

25|$|Hecker {{obtained}} {{a job at}} Microsoft in Seattle, Washington around 1992. He worked there for three years, becoming creator {{and leader of the}} WinG API project for the Windows operating system. After completing WinG, he moved to Microsoft's entertainment division where he wrote the rendering engine for the real-time globe display in the Encarta World Atlas. In 1995, Hecker left Microsoft to form his own company in Seattle, Definition Six, a games and computer graphics consulting company that was later moved to Oakland, California. The company focused on the development of physics technology for games and lobbied for the OpenGL standard for <b>graphics</b> <b>display.</b> The company never actually shipped a commercial title, but did produce a tech demo. He also spent several years working independently on a game based on rock climbing as a side project, though it was never completed.|$|E
500|$|The PC {{version of}} the game was {{considered}} to be [...] "faithful" [...] to the Xbox 360 {{version of the}} game, retaining the same content without adding any new features. Reviewers commented that Braid benefited from keyboard controls. However, as a port of the Xbox 360 version, the lack of initial support for optimizing the <b>graphics</b> <b>display</b> for one's computer, either through larger screen resolutions or turning off certain game effects, was seen as a drawback, though it is expected that patches will be released to add these options. Both the PlayStation 3 and Macintosh ports of the game by Hothead Games were found to be easily accessible on the system and retained all the innovation and challenge of the original Xbox Live game.|$|E

40|$|<b>Graphics</b> <b>displays</b> {{can be of}} {{significant}} aid in accomplishing a teleoperation task throughout all three phases of off-line task analysis and planning, operator training, and online operation. In the first phase, <b>graphics</b> <b>displays</b> provide substantial aid to investigate work cell layout, motion planning with collision detection and with possible redundancy resolution, and planning for camera views. In the second phase, <b>graphics</b> <b>displays</b> can serve as very useful tools for introductory training of operators before training them on actual hardware. In the third phase, <b>graphics</b> <b>displays</b> {{can be used for}} previewing planned motions and monitoring actual motions in any desired viewing angle, or, when communication time delay prevails, for providing predictive graphics overlay on the actual camera view of the remote site to show the non-time-delayed consequences of commanded motions in real time. This paper addresses potential space applications of <b>graphics</b> <b>displays</b> in all three operational phases of advanced teleoperation. Possible applications are illustrated with techniques developed and demonstrated in the Advanced Teleoperation Laboratory at JPL. The examples described include task analysis and planning of a simulated Solar Maximum Satellite Repair task, a novel force-reflecting teleoperation simulator for operator training, and preview and predictive displays for on-line operations...|$|R
5000|$|With {{the coming}} of {{electronic}} processors and <b>graphic</b> <b>displays</b> it became possible to replace these discrete controllers with computer-based algorithms, hosted on a network of input/output racks with their own control processors.

500|$|Spacewar was {{extremely}} {{popular in the}} small programming community in the 1960s and was widely recreated on other minicomputer and mainframe computers of the time before migrating to early microcomputer systems in the 1970s. Early computer scientist Alan Kay noted in 1972 that [...] "the game of Spacewar blossoms spontaneously wherever there is a <b>graphics</b> <b>display</b> connected to a computer," [...] and Graetz recalled in 1981 that as the game initially spread it could be found on [...] "just about any research computer that had a programmable CRT". The majority of this spread took place several years after the initial development of the game; while there are early anecdotes of players and game variants at a handful of locations, primarily near MIT and Stanford, {{it was only after}} 1967 that computers hooked up to monitors or terminals capable of playing Spacewar began to proliferate, allowing the game to reach a wider audience and influence later video game designersâ€”by 1971, it is estimated that there were over 1000 computers with monitors, rather than a few dozen. It is around this time {{that the majority of the}} game variants were created for various computer systems, such as later PDP systems, and in 1972 the game was well-known enough in the programming community that Rolling Stone sponsored the [...] "SpaceWar! Olympics", possibly the first video game tournament.|$|E
500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1970s, video games existed almost entirely as novelties passed around by programmers and technicians with access to computers, primarily at research institutions and large companies. One of these games was Spacewar!, created in 1962 for the Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) PDP-1 minicomputer by Steve Russell and others in the programming community at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The two-player game has the players engage in a dogfight between two spaceships, set against the backdrop of a starfield, with a central star exerting gravitational force upon the ships. The game was copied to several of the early minicomputer installations in American academic institutions after its initial release, making it potentially the first video game to be available outside a single research institute. Spacewar was extremely popular in the small programming community in the 1960s and was widely recreated on other minicomputer and mainframe computers of the time, later migrating to early microcomputer systems. Early computer scientist Alan Kay noted in 1972 that [...] "the game of Spacewar blossoms spontaneously wherever there is a <b>graphics</b> <b>display</b> connected to a computer," [...] and contributor Martin Graetz recalled in 1981 that as the game initially spread it could be found on [...] "just about any research computer that had a programmable CRT". Although the game was widespread for the era, it was still very limited in its direct reach: the PDP-1 was priced at US$120,000 and only 55 were ever sold, most without a monitor, which prohibited the original Spacewar or any game of the time from reaching beyond a narrow, academic audience. The original developers of Spacewar considered ways to monetize the game, but saw no options given the high price of the computer it ran on.|$|E
