5|$|Agent Fox Mulder {{arrives at}} the civic center after {{what looks like a}} massacre; bodies lie on the {{sidewalk}} and in the foyer. Sheriff Spencer (John Cygan) explains that the suspect murdered four people from the elevator with <b>his</b> <b>bare</b> hands. His rampage ended when he was shot by a security guard. Spencer notes that seven other individuals have murdered twenty-two people in Franklin in the past six months. Mulder discovers that the LED display in the elevator has been damaged, and that the dead suspect has a green residue on his fingertips.|$|E
5|$|The biblical account {{states that}} Samson was a Nazirite, {{and that he}} was given immense {{strength}} to aid him against his enemies and allow him to perform superhuman feats, including slaying a lion with <b>his</b> <b>bare</b> hands and massacring an entire army of Philistines using only the jawbone of an ass. However, if Samson's long hair was cut, then his Nazirite vow would be violated, and he would lose his strength.|$|E

5|$|After infiltrating the Garden of Death and {{the castle}} where Blofeld spends his time {{dressed in the}} costume of a Samurai warrior, Bond is {{captured}} and Bunt identifies him as a British secret agent and not a Japanese coal miner. After surviving a near execution, Bond exacts revenge on Blofeld in a duel, Blofeld armed with a sword and Bond with a wooden staff. Bond eventually kills Blofeld by strangling him with <b>his</b> <b>bare</b> hands {{in a fit of}} violent rage, then blows up the castle. Upon escaping, he suffers a head injury, leaving him an amnesiac living as a Japanese fisherman with Kissy, {{while the rest of the}} world believes him dead; his obituary appears in the newspapers.|$|E
5|$|Drummond's wartime {{experience}} {{had given him}} a series of abilities akin to that of a hunter: stealth—"he could move over ground without a single blade of grass rustling"—and the ability to incapacitate others—"he could kill a man with <b>his</b> <b>bare</b> hands in a second". During his time on the Western Front he would take himself on solitary raids through no man's land. Drummond was also proficient in jujutsu and boxing, was a crack shot, played cricket for the Free Foresters, and was an excellent poker player. In addition to Drummond's physical attributes is his common sense, which allows him to equal and beat his opponents, even if they have a superior intellect.|$|E
5|$|During this time, Zhou Tong {{also has}} an {{additional}} disciple named Wu Song. Wu Song becomes famous for killing a man-eating tiger with <b>his</b> <b>bare</b> hands and is appointed as a constable in his native Shandong. The county magistrate Sun Guoqin later sends Wu {{on a mission to}} Kaifeng with precious tiger bone balm in order to curry favor with influential personages. During his stay in the capital, he makes the acquaintance of Zhou. Zhou finds Wu to be a man of great strength, but feels that he lacks refinement in his martial technique and, therefore, offers guidance for Wu's training. Unfortunately, these two men only interact for a brief two months before Wu has to return home, never to see Zhou again.|$|E

5|$|However, one {{particular}} incident in Kasi {{had a profound}} impact on E.V. Ramasamy's ideology and future work. At the worship site there were free meals offered to guests. To E.V. Ramasamy's shock, he was refused meals at choultries, which exclusively fed Brahmins. Due to extreme hunger, E.V. Ramasamy felt compelled to enter one of the eateries disguised as a Brahmin with a sacred thread on <b>his</b> <b>bare</b> chest, but was betrayed by his moustache. The gatekeeper at the temple concluded that E.V. Ramasamy was not a Brahmin, as Brahmins were not permitted by the Hindu shastras to have moustaches. He not only prevented Periyar's entry but also pushed him rudely into the street.|$|E
5|$|In July 1942, Harada was {{reassigned to}} the {{aircraft}} carrier Hiyō. In early October of that year, the carrier departed Japan {{to take part in}} the Guadalcanal Campaign. On 17 October, Harada formed part of the escort for a force of torpedo bombers which were attempting to attack targets on Guadalcanal. American Grumman F4F Wildcats attacked this force, and while Harada probably downed a Wildcat, his aircraft was badly damaged. His plane crash-landed near the Japanese base at Rekata Bay on Santa Isabel Island, and Harada had to dig himself out from underneath the wreckage of his plane with <b>his</b> <b>bare</b> hands. Harada was later returned to Japan on board a hospital ship.|$|E
5|$|In 1875, {{again at}} the {{invitation}} of the Prince of Wales, he joined HMS Serapis, which conducted the Prince on an official tour of India, 1875–76. Louis sketched some of the events of the tour and his drawings were published in the Illustrated London News. He was promoted to lieutenant on 15 May 1876. The Prince asked Louis to stay with him at Marlborough House for the summer of 1876, but wishing to gain further experience at sea, Louis instead accepted an offer to join Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, as a lieutenant on board HMS Sultan. In addition to acting as the Duke's equerry, Louis continued his naval duties. He did not enjoy the position, as the Duke was rather touchy and Louis's cabin was infested with rats, one of which he caught with <b>his</b> <b>bare</b> hands as it ran across his chest as he lay in bed. The Sultan toured the Mediterranean from July 1876.|$|E

60|$|Tommy {{sat down}} {{opposite}} her. <b>His</b> <b>bared</b> head revealed {{a shock of}} exquisitely slicked-back red hair. His face was pleasantly ugly--nondescript, yet unmistakably {{the face of a}} gentleman and a sportsman. His brown suit was well cut, but perilously near the end of its tether.|$|R
50|$|On May 14, 2005, after {{commanding}} his son {{to strip}} naked, Malone disciplined his son for failing grades and misbehavior by striking <b>his</b> <b>bared</b> body repeatedly with a leather belt. Without the protection of clothing, the son developed extensive welts across his back, chest, stomach, legs and buttocks.|$|R
5|$|The imprisoned {{architect}} Daedalus tells Kratos {{to unite}} the Labyrinth. Completing this task, Kratos fights {{his way through the}} aerial puzzle and rescues Pandora, who tells him to break the Chain of Balance so the Labyrinth can be raised, and she can reach her box. Neutralizing the three judges and breaking the chain, Kratos raises the Labyrinth, and Pandora tries to enter the Flame of Olympus. Zeus intervenes and fights Kratos; after a brief battle, Pandora sacrifices herself and quenches the flame, despite Kratos' protests. Finding Pandora's Box empty, Kratos attacks the mocking Zeus. Gaia returns and tries to kill them, but they escape through a gaping wound in her chest where they continue their battle. Gaia is killed when Kratos impales Zeus against her heart with the Blade of Olympus, which apparently also kills Zeus. When Kratos recovers the blade and tries to leave, he is attacked by Zeus' spirit and loses all of his weapons in the process. Before Zeus can land a fatal blow, Kratos is saved by Pandora during a journey into his psyche. With help from the spirits of his wife Lysandra and daughter Calliope, Kratos forgives himself for his past sins. After discovering the power of hope, he regains consciousness and beats Zeus to death with <b>his</b> <b>bare</b> hands, thus ending the reign of the Olympian Gods.|$|E
5|$|The {{island is}} ruled {{over by a}} king. His name is Epatiana. He is a large, ignorant-looking boy of about 18 summers, {{and is one of}} the worst rowdies on the island, and there is no power to touch him. The first time we met him he was just landing from an {{excursion}} trip to the island of Rimatara, near by. And you need not be told that I was surprised when told that he was the king of the island; for instead of being dressed in a garb of rich apparel of some kind, with a crown about his head, as I had expected, he had nothing whatever on to indicate his supreme power. His costume was composed of a red breech-clout, a red woolen shirt and upon <b>his</b> <b>bare</b> head an old dried up wreath of faded flowers, such as is worn by all rowdies. When we spoke to him about his island, he dropped his head, as he sat upon the sand, and blushingly answered us. We told him who we were and where we were from, saluted him and left him with very different ideas formed about the king of Rurutu, than we had before meeting him. This was the first monarch of the kind I ever saw, and the first time we were ever under the reign of a king. The island is under the French protection, still it regulates and governs its own affairs, and the French have nothing to say in that respect. The king has judges under him, who make the laws and enforce them while he is in his childhood days.|$|E
25|$|The protagonist Beowulf, {{a hero of}} the Geats, {{comes to}} the aid of Hrothgar, king of the Danes, whose great hall, Heorot, is plagued by the monster Grendel. Beowulf kills Grendel with <b>his</b> <b>bare</b> hands and Grendel's mother with a giant's sword that he found in her lair.|$|E

60|$|Verily this hunter merited {{the respect}} which {{shone in the}} great chieftain's glance. Like a mountain-ash he stood, {{straight}} and strong, his magnificent frame tapering wedge-like from his broad shoulders. The bulging line of his thick neck, the deep chest, the knotty contour of <b>his</b> <b>bared</b> forearm, and the full curves of his legs--all denoted a wonderful muscular development.|$|R
6000|$|... "Stealer of balus!" [...] he cried. The panther rose to {{a sitting}} position, <b>his</b> <b>bared</b> fangs but {{a few feet from}} the ape-man's taunting face. Tarzan growled hideously and struck at the cat's face with his knife. [...] "I am Tarzan of the Apes," [...] he roared. [...] "This is Tarzan's lair. Go, or I will kill you." ...|$|R
25|$|Bonham drum solos {{would often}} feature his playing floor toms and cymbals with <b>his</b> <b>bare</b> hands. He started using this {{technique}} {{as well as}} developing a finger-control style, influenced from hearing jazz recordings by drummer Joe Morello, during the early 1960s with his first band the Blue Star Trio.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to his protective equipment, a catcher usually also adopts practices that minimize his risk of injury. For instance, unlike fielders elsewhere on the field, a catcher tries, to the extent possible, to catch the ball with his gloved hand alone. An outfielder may catch a fly ball by covering the ball, once it strikes {{the pocket of his}} glove, with <b>his</b> <b>bare</b> hand in order to secure it. The catcher, however, tries to keep <b>his</b> <b>bare</b> hand, which is highly vulnerable to injury, out of harm's way by presenting the pitcher with a target (the large round glove) while hiding his unprotected throwing hand behind his back. By doing so, the bare hand cannot be struck by a foul tip. Many broken fingers, split fingernails, and grotesque dislocations are avoided by adherence to this simple expedient.|$|E
25|$|He {{attacked}} {{a large number}} of women, and while he would often use <b>his</b> <b>bare</b> hand, he would occasionally use a rod. Some of his victims were left badly injured by the attacks. He would appear, carry out his attacks and vanish with such speed that some people attributed him with supernatural powers.|$|E
60|$|He smoked without knowing. Then he {{took the}} {{cigarette}} from <b>his</b> lips, <b>bared</b> <b>his</b> teeth, and putting {{the tip of his}} tongue between his teeth spat off a grain of tobacco, turning slightly aside, like a man who is alone, or who is lost in thought.|$|R
60|$|O'Brien {{took off}} <b>his</b> coat and <b>bared</b> <b>his</b> right arm. His under lip still trembled, {{but he held}} a tight grip on himself. The captain's {{penknife}} was opened and passed to Gorman.|$|R
60|$|But the Lord of Stoutenburg is more wakeful than all. Like a caged {{beast of}} prey he paces {{up and down}} the low, narrow weighing-room of the molens, his hands tightly clenched behind his back, <b>his</b> head <b>bare,</b> <b>his</b> cloak cast aside despite the bitter coldness of the night.|$|R
25|$|Hera's wrath against Zeus' son {{continues}} {{and while}} Heracles {{is still an}} infant, Hera sends two serpents to kill him as he lay in his cot. Heracles throttles the snakes with <b>his</b> <b>bare</b> hands and was found by his nurse playing with their limp bodies {{as if they were}} a child's toy.|$|E
25|$|The Stooges soon {{gained a}} {{reputation}} for their wild, primitive live performances. Pop, especially, became known for his outrageous onstage behavioursmearing <b>his</b> <b>bare</b> chest with hamburger meat and peanut butter, cutting himself with shards of glass, and flashing his genitalia to the audience. Pop is sometimes credited with the invention or popularization of stage diving.|$|E
25|$|On January 30, 2014, a {{fisherman}} from El Salvador named Jose Salvador Albarengo {{was found by}} people living at the Ebon Atoll. Albarengo claimed to have spent 13 months adrift after his ship's motor failed {{off the coast of}} Mexico. He said another fisherman sailing with him had died several months before he was rescued. He reportedly survived by eating turtles, birds and fish caught with <b>his</b> <b>bare</b> hands.|$|E
