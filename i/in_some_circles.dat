5|$|The term Żydokomuna {{originated}} {{in connection with}} the Russian Bolshevik Revolution and targeted Jewish communists during the Polish-Soviet War. The emergence of the Soviet state was seen by many Poles as Russian imperialism in a new guise. The visibility of Jews in both the Soviet leadership and in the Polish Communist Party further heightened such fears. <b>In</b> <b>some</b> <b>circles,</b> Żydokomuna came {{to be seen as a}} prominent antisemitic stereotype expressing political paranoia.|$|E
5|$|Phips, whose motives {{continue}} to be debated by historians today, claimed this {{was a violation of}} the terms of capitulation, and consequently declared the agreement void. He allowed his troops to sack the town and destroy the church, acts that he had promised to prevent in the oral surrender agreement. He had the fortifications destroyed, removing all of their weaponry. Before he left, he convinced a number of Acadians to swear oaths of allegiance to the English crown, appointed a council of locals to administer the town, and then sailed back to Boston, carrying Meneval and his garrison as prisoners of war. Phips received a hero's welcome and was lavished with praise, although he was criticized <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>circles</b> (and has been vilified in French and Acadian histories) for allowing the sacking of Port Royal.|$|E
5|$|Ripostes, {{published}} in October 1912, begins Pound's shift toward minimalist language. Michael Alexander describes the poems as showing a greater concentration {{of meaning and}} economy of rhythm than his earlier work. It was published when Pound had just begun his move toward Imagism; his first {{use of the word}} Imagiste appears in his prefatory note to the volume. The collection includes five poems by Hulme and a translation of the 8th-century Old English poem The Seafarer, although not a literal translation. It upset scholars, as would Pound's other translations from Latin, Italian, French and Chinese, either because of errors or because he lacked familiarity with the cultural context. Alexander writes that <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>circles,</b> Pound's translations made him more unpopular than the treason charge, and the reaction to The Seafarer was a rehearsal for the negative response to Homage to Sextus Propertius in 1919. His translation from the Italian of Sonnets and ballate of Guido Cavalcanti was also {{published in}} 1912.|$|E

50|$|The {{type of a}} Fuchsian group {{need not}} be the same as its type when {{considered}} as a Kleinian group: in fact, all Fuchsian groups are Kleinian groups of type 2, as their limit sets (as Kleinian groups) are proper subsets of the Riemann sphere, contained <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>circle.</b>|$|R
5|$|The State President of the South African Republic, Paul Kruger, {{was not an}} easy man to work with, and <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>circles</b> it was {{predicted}} that Reitz would quickly find himself subordinated to Kruger. This was not the case, however. On occasion the two men clashed on matters of policy, but Reitz remained true to his own convictions, gaining some influence over Kruger in the process. Originally praised by the British for his diplomatic courtesy, their attitude quickly changed when they understood that Reitz was a protagonist of Transvaal independence. Reitz was sometimes rather brazen in his political statements, so when he – incorrectly – claimed the South African Republic to be a fully sovereign state, the British jumped on him.|$|E

25|$|The {{intelligence}} work of Special Branch {{was often}} overlooked <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>circles.</b> This is because its role sat somewhere between {{that of the}} Security Service (MI5) {{and that of the}} Metropolitan Police Anti-Terrorist Branch (SO13). Special Branch officers were usually the ones to perform arrests of suspected spies, since Security Service officers are not authorised to take such actions; an example being the Portland Spy Ring.|$|E
25|$|The losing bid by the Brisconnections {{consortium}} incorporated three {{lanes of}} traffic {{in each direction}} (as opposed to two lanes for the winning bid).

50|$|Robert Stewart was {{the second}} son of the future King Robert II of Scotland (1316-1390) and of Elizabeth Mure of Rowallan. His parents' {{marriage}} was deemed as uncanonical at first, which, <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>circle,</b> gave their children and descendants the label of illegitimacy, but the granting of a papal dispensation in 1349 saw their remarriage and their children's legitimisation. Robert's grandfather was Walter Stewart, 6th High Steward of Scotland (1293-1326) and his father was the first monarch of the House of Stewart. His great-grandfather was Robert the Bruce (1274-1329), legendary victor of the Battle of Bannockburn.|$|R
25|$|Eden Park was {{established}} as a cricket ground with the Kingsland Cricket Club renting land close {{to what is now}} Sandringham Road. Subsequently, the Eden Cricket Club purchased a plot of land in the area and progressively developed it as a cricket ground.

25|$|<b>In</b> <b>some</b> <b>circles,</b> it is {{considered}} bad luck to depict a dragon facing downwards, as {{it is seen as}} disrespectful to place a dragon in such manner that it cannot ascend to the sky.

As such, it is believed that one must be fierce and strong enough, hence earning the right to wear the dragon on his skin, lest his luck be consumed by the dragons.|$|E
