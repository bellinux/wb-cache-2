Estimating luxuriousness and durability for 57 consumer goods, we confirm this prediction in U. S. data. We exploit this finding to test predictions of cyclical utilization and increasing returns models of business cycles. Both models predict more cyclical productivity for durable luxuries, a prediction borne out in the data. The utilization model predicts procyclical relative prices for durables and luxuries; the increasing returns model does not. Prices are more procyclical for durables and luxuries, discriminating in favor of cyclical utilization. I...|$|R

Before the revolution, the French debt had risen from 8 billion to 12 billion livres. Extravagant <b>expenditures</b> <b>on</b> <b>luxuries</b> by Louis XVI, whose rule began in 1774, were compounded by debts that were run up during the reign of his even-more-profligate predecessor, Louis XV (who reigned from 1715 to 1774).

40|$|This paper {{begins by}} arguing that the 'poverty {{measurement}} debate' has become bogged down in the poverty statistics and has failed to evolve into {{a consideration of the}} causes and consequences of poverty. In order to redress this imbalance, it is necessary to develop poverty measures that lead more naturally in these directions. It is argued that poverty can be given a meaning from two different perspectives, the first focusing on what poverty means to those who study it, and the second focusing on what it means to those who actually experience it. In attempting to shed some light on the latter interpretation, the paper presents some survey data in which DSS clients indicate what poverty means to them. the paper then explores three different approaches to measuring poverty, each of which draws on the two key features of poverty, that it is a situation in which choice is severely restricted, and that there must be some socially determined relevance to any poverty measure. The first method estimates and compares poverty using both income and expenditure data as a way of better understanding the choices and circumstances of the poor. The second estimates a poverty line income as a situation where all resources must be devoted to meeting immediate consumable needs and where there are no <b>expenditures</b> <b>on</b> durable and <b>luxury</b> items. The third method, budget standards, is described briefly from the perspective developed in the paper with the aim of highlighting how budget standards research addresses issues of choice and social relevance...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis {{study was}} {{conducted}} in order to investigate the relationships between different factors affecting educational competitiveness, which is crucial to enhancing national competitiveness in every country, and to put forward policy implications whereby each country may raise the level of its educational competitiveness. PISA score was selected as an indicator representing the educational competitiveness of 22 OECD countries, and this included some independent variables, such as per capita GDP, total public <b>expenditure</b> <b>on</b> education as a percentage of GDP, and total per capita public <b>expenditure</b> <b>on</b> education (US dollars), affecting educational competitiveness. We employed the fuzzy set analysis method (FS/QCA) to analyze the complex causal relationships among the factors affecting educational competitiveness. The research results show that there are three significant combinations of variables affecting educational competitiveness (PISA score). Model 1 is a configuration of four variables (high total <b>expenditure</b> <b>on</b> education as a percentage of GDP, high total per capita <b>expenditure</b> <b>on</b> education, high ratio of private-source <b>expenditure</b> <b>on</b> education to GDP, and high GDP), and includes Netherlands, Finland, Australia, and Ireland. Model 2 is a configuration of five variables (low total <b>expenditure</b> <b>on</b> education, low total per capita <b>expenditure</b> <b>on</b> education, low ration of students to teaching staff, low private-source <b>expenditure</b> <b>on</b> education, and low GDP, and includes Poland. Model 3 is a configuration of five variables (low total <b>expenditure</b> <b>on</b> education, low total per capita <b>expenditure</b> <b>on</b> education, high private-source <b>expenditure</b> <b>on</b> education, high ratio of students to teaching staff, and high GDP), and includes Japan. Finally, the study suggests that each country should endeavour to enhance its own educational competitiveness, considering how the factors associated with this relate to each other...|$|R
