50|$|The {{filing of}} a <b>European</b> <b>divisional</b> <b>application</b> with a {{national}} authority (such as a national patent office) has no effect in law. The national authority may however, as a service, choose to forward the divisional application to the EPO. If the authority does so, the divisional application is deemed to be received {{at the time the}} documents are received at the EPO. The authority has, however, no obligation to do so.|$|E
5000|$|<b>European</b> <b>divisional</b> <b>applications</b> must {{be filed}} {{directly}} or by post {{with one of}} the filing offices of the EPO, i.e. at the European Patent Office at Munich, The Hague, or Berlin. It may also be filed using the so-called epoline online filing software.|$|R
5000|$|The {{conditions}} for filing <b>divisional</b> <b>applications</b> regarding the time limit {{to be met}} have however been modified several times since the entry into force of the European Patent Convention in the 1970s, and changed again on April 1, 2010. What has not been changed however is that a <b>divisional</b> <b>application</b> can by no means be filed after grant of a European patent, i.e. based on a <b>European</b> patent. A <b>divisional</b> <b>application</b> can only be filed based on a pending European patent application, provided that the provisions of [...] are met.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>divisional</b> <b>application</b> is {{one which}} has been [...] "divided" [...] from an {{existing}} <b>application.</b> A <b>divisional</b> <b>application</b> can only contain subject matter in the application from which it is divided (its parent), but retains the filing and priority date of that parent. A <b>divisional</b> <b>application</b> is useful if a unity of invention objection is issued, {{in which case the}} second (and third, fourth, etc.) inventions can be protected in <b>divisional</b> <b>applications.</b>|$|R
50|$|A divisional {{application}} of a European patent application can be filed {{as long as the}} latter is still pending. European {{divisional application}}s must be filed directly or by post with one of the filing offices of the EPO, i.e. at the European Patent Office at Munich, The Hague, or Berlin. It may also be filed using the so-called epoline online filing software. The filing of a <b>European</b> <b>divisional</b> <b>application</b> with a national authority has no effect in law.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>divisional</b> <b>application</b> {{also claims}} {{priority}} {{based on the}} filing date of the parent application, but differs from a continuation application in that a <b>divisional</b> <b>application</b> claims a distinct or independent invention [...] "carved out" [...] of the parent <b>application.</b> A <b>divisional</b> <b>application</b> must share {{at least one of}} the inventors named in the parent <b>application.</b> A <b>divisional</b> <b>application</b> is often filed after the examiner issued a [...] "restriction requirement", because a patent can only claim a single invention (cf. unity of invention).|$|R

"The {{procedure}} {{concerning the}} <b>divisional</b> <b>application</b> is in principle independent from the procedure concerning the parent <b>application</b> and the <b>divisional</b> <b>application</b> {{is treated as}} a new application....

50|$|<b>Divisional</b> <b>applications</b> are {{generally}} used {{in cases where}} the parent application may lack unity of invention; that is, the parent application describes more than one invention and the applicant is required to split the parent into one or more <b>divisional</b> <b>applications</b> each claiming only a single invention. The ability to file <b>divisional</b> <b>applications</b> in cases of lack of unity of invention is required by Article 4G of the Paris Convention.|$|R

"In {{the case}} of a {{sequence}} of applications consisting of a root (originating) <b>application</b> followed by <b>divisional</b> <b>applications,</b> each divided from its predecessor, it is a necessary and sufficient condition for a <b>divisional</b> <b>application</b> of that sequence to comply with Article 76(1), second sentence, EPC that anything disclosed in that <b>divisional</b> <b>application</b> be directly and unambiguously derivable from what is disclosed in each of the preceding applications as filed." ...|$|R
5000|$|A <b>divisional</b> patent <b>application</b> (sometimes {{referred}} to as a <b>divisional</b> <b>application</b> or simply a divisional) is a type of patent application which contains matter from a previously filed application (the so-called parent <b>application).</b> Whilst a <b>divisional</b> <b>application</b> is filed later than the parent application, it may retain its parent's filing date, and will generally claim the same priority.|$|R

5000|$|In October 2013, the Administrative Council of the European Patent Organisation again amended Rules 36, 38 and 135 of the Implementing Regulations, which {{define the}} time limits for filing <b>divisional</b> <b>applications</b> in Europe.

5000|$|As {{mentioned}} above, a <b>divisional</b> <b>application</b> {{can only}} be filed based on a pending European patent application.
