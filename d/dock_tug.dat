These ocean going vessels (armed under the DEMS programme) bore little resemblance to the small Harbour or <b>Docking</b> <b>tugs</b> seen in most large ports and often worked alongside the naval tugs of His Majesty's Rescue Tug service, the only distinctions being that they were crewed by Merchant Seamen and flew the Red Ensign instead of the White.|$|R

Keadby Lock is much shorter than the ship, and so it had to sail through when the river made a level with the canal, and both sets of gates could be opened at the same time. However, the canal company were worried that because of its width, it might jam in the lock, which would cause flooding of the hinterland at high tide, and draining of the canal at low tide. Dunston's had to build a dam across the canal beyond the lock, to prevent both consequences. Once built, the ship successfully passed through the lock, and the dam was removed. During the Second World War, Dunston's designed and built TID (<b>Tugs</b> in <b>Dock)</b> <b>tugs.</b> They were constructed from eight pre-fabricated sections, manufactured by companies who were not normally involved in shipbuilding.

50|$|A {{fuel pipe}} line was built, it started at Martigues and utilising storage tanks in the La Mede refinery. The harbour was mined {{and it was}} 9 September when the first tanker <b>docked.</b> A <b>tug</b> {{assisting}} it <b>dock</b> hit a mine. Pipe laying started the same day. Six teams, each laying over two miles of 4 inch pipe a day. Interim storage and dispensing points were built. When completed it was capable of moving 500 tons of petrol a day, which reduced the problems caused by a shortage of Jerrycan's and trucks. A second 6-inch pipeline would be laid and it eventually reached the Sarrebourg, 850 km away. By Spring 1945, 1,200,000 gallons were being pumped every day. Meeting the requirements of both the Seventh United States Army and the First Army (France).|$|R
5000|$|In 1960, {{during the}} Dutch {{decolonization}} and planned independence of Western New Guinea, a territory {{which was also}} claimed by Indonesia, Karel Doorman set sail along with two destroyers and a modified oil tanker to [...] "show the flag". In order to avoid possible problems with Indonesia's ally Egypt at the Suez Canal, she instead sailed around the Horn of Africa. She arrived in Fremantle, Australia, where the local seamen's union struck in sympathy with Indonesia; the crew used the propeller thrust of aircraft chained down on deck to nudge the carrier into <b>dock</b> without <b>tugs.</b> In addition to her air wing, she was ferrying twelve Hawker Hunter fighters to bolster the local Dutch defence forces, which she delivered when she arrived at Hollandia, New Guinea. Karel Doorman was also to have visited Yokohama, Japan during this Asian cruise to celebrate the 350th anniversary of the establishment of Japanese-Dutch diplomatic relations but, due to Indonesian and local protests, Japan withdrew its invitation.|$|R
5000|$|A week later, {{she began}} an {{extended}} {{tour of duty}} in the Central Pacific. Towing the floating dry <b>dock</b> , the <b>tug</b> arrived in Kwajalein lagoon on 2 June. Reassigned to ServRon 12, Zuni served as a harbor tug at Kwajalein until mid-July when she again took ARD-16 in tow and got underway for the Mariana Islands. There, she participated briefly in the 24 July assault on Tinian before settling into a routine of shuttle voyages between Eniwetok and the Marianas. Late in September, she towed a different floating dry dock, , to the Palau Islands where, during the first 18 days of October, she provided support services to the combined forces invading Peleliu. At that point, she received urgent orders to rendezvous with [...] after that light cruiser had been damaged by two torpedoes during a Japanese aerial blitz to answer Task Force 38's raids on Okinawa and Formosa. She relieved [...] of the light cruiser and towed her into Ulithi lagoon on 27 October. After serving at the anchorage there for five days, the tug returned to sea with a group of oilers. Soon another set of urgent orders sent her to aid another light cruiser, , which had been torpedoed in the Philippines, off the San Bernardino Strait, on 3 November by Japanese submarine [...] Though the cruiser nearly capsized, the shipsâ€™ companies of Zuni and Reno combined efforts to meet the threat; and the tug succeeded in towing the cruiser 1,500 miles (2,800 km) back to Ulithi.|$|R
50|$|Hanson {{stayed in}} Sasebo {{for two days}} before {{proceeding}} into the Korean Strait and Sea of Japan to observe and report on Soviet and North Korean ship movements. For {{about three or four}} days Hansons activities went smoothly until she came upon a group of fleet <b>tugs</b> towing dry <b>docks</b> in a northerly direction. On 6 May 1971 Hanson collided with one of the Soviet Navys fleet tugs. Hanson was following the Russian tugs towing floating dry <b>docks.</b> The <b>tugs</b> were headed north, perhaps to a Russian port, when one of the tugs (said to be the Diomede,) fell back and came along the starboard side of Hanson. The two ships were traveling around 12 knots and 150 feet apart. Hansons bridge crew attempted to hail the tug via a bullhorn, but the tug turned and struck Hanson near her anchor. While no injuries were reported, and Hanson received little damage, the tug lost at least 30 feet of its port side main deck railing or life line. Hanson immediately went to general quarters and film of the incident was collected from crew members as evidence of the international incident. This was a third and final collision that occurred prior to signing of the Incidents at Sea Agreement in 1972 and was officially between the U.S. destroyer USS Hanson and the Soviet tug Diomede in the Korean Strait on 5 May 1971. This minor collision, which was caused by the Soviet tug violating the nautical rules of the road, did not have serious repercussions for Soviet-American relations. Hanson then made way for Yokosuka, Japan, for repairs and cooling of Soviet/US Navy tensions. She remained in Yokosuka for about ten days. During her stay in Yokosuka, a marching group composed of at least two crew members per division was selected and the group, in the command of one of the ships officers, practiced for half a day on the pier to prepare for the Black Ship Festival in Shimoda, Japan.|$|R
40|$|Electrostatic {{modeling}} of spacecraft has wide-reaching {{applications such as}} detumbling space debris in the Geosynchronous Earth Orbit regime before <b>docking,</b> servicing and <b>tugging</b> space debris to graveyard orbits, and Lorentz augmented orbits. The viability of electrostatic actuation control applications relies on faster-than-realtime characterization of the electrostatic interaction. The Volume Multi-Sphere Method (VMSM) seeks the optimal placement and radii of {{a small number of}} equipotential spheres to accurately model the electrostatic force and torque on a conducting space object. Current VMSM models tuned using force and torque comparisons with commercially available finite element software are subject to the modeled probe size and numerical errors of the software. This work first investigates fitting of VMSM models to Surface-MSM (SMSM) generated electrical field data, removing modeling dependence on probe geometry while significantly increasing performance and speed. A proposed electric field matching cost function is compared to a force and torque cost function, the inclusion of a self-capacitance constraint is explored and 4 degree-of-freedom VMSM models generated using electric field matching are investigated. The resulting E-field based VMSM development framework is illustrated on a box-shaped hub with a single solar panel, and convergence properties of select models are qualitatively analyzed. Despite the complex non-symmetric spacecraft geometry, elegantly simple 2 -sphere VMSM solutions provide force and torque fits within a few percent...|$|R
