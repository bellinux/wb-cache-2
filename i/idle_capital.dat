25|$|Iran is the last, large {{untapped}} {{emerging market}} in the world. According to many experts, the economy of Iran has many investment opportunities, particularly on its stock exchange. The Central Bank of Iran indicate that 70 percent of the Iranians own homes with huge amounts of idle money entering the housing market. However, if the stock market grows stronger, it will undoubtedly attract <b>idle</b> <b>capital.</b> In terms of investment, the domestic rival markets of the bourse are the Iranian real estate market, cars and gold (with gold {{being used as a}} store of value, a hedging tool against hyperinflation and the devaluation of the Rial). According to Goldman Sachs, Iran is forecast to reach the highest economic growth between 2015 and 2025 and join the world's largest economies (world's 12th economy by 2025). Since 2012, TSE has served as a safe heaven against international sanctions and inflation.|$|E
500|$|The {{terminal}} {{was very}} successful {{for the first five}} years of operation, but then events began to move against it. The Suez Canal reopened and the economics of ULCCs began to appear less satisfactory than had originally been anticipated. Shipping goods in the form of infrequent but very large loads involves engaging more <b>idle</b> <b>capital</b> in the form of stock than the alternatives. Also, the process of trans-shipment is costly. The whole economic basis of the Whiddy terminal was incompatible with the [...] "just-in-time" [...] approach to industrial management which was being widely adopted at the time. That apart, the late 1970s had a levelling-off in demand for oil as the result of both economic recession and a rise in the price of oil. All these circumstances caused a fall in the use of the terminal to a level below that which had been planned. Thus, by the late 1970s, the local Gulf operating company (Gulf Oil Terminals (Ireland) Ltd) was struggling to maintain the viability of the terminal. The company was forced to undertake a number of cost-saving measures.|$|E
60|$|Aside from {{salaries}} {{to these}} dependents, and {{quite apart from}} the consideration of macassar, the possession of all this animal filament was financially unprofitable: the hair market was buoyant, and hers represented a large amount of <b>idle</b> <b>capital.</b> And it was otherwise a source of annoyance and irritation; for all the young men of the city were hotly in love with her, and skirmishing for a love-lock. They seldom troubled Dan much, but the outlying Beersheba had an animated time of it. He was subject to constant incursions, and was always in a riot.|$|E

40|$|This paper derives a real options {{model that}} {{accounts}} for the value premium. If real investment is largely irreversible, the {{book value of assets}} of a distressed firm is high relative to its market value because it has <b>idle</b> physical <b>capital.</b> The firm's excess installed capital capacity enables it to fully benefit from positive aggregate shocks without undertaking costly investment. Thus, returns to equity holders of a high book-to-market firm are sensitive to aggregate conditions and its systematic risk is high. Simulations indicate that the model {{goes a long way toward}} accounting for the observed value premium. Copyright 2006 by The American Finance Association. ...|$|R
40|$|For {{nearly five}} years, {{austerity}} has been {{touted as the}} only way to tackle the effects of the Eurozone’s financial crisis. Steve Coulter profiles a new initiative from the German trade union confederation, the Deutsche Gewerkschaftsbund, which aims to leverage Europe’s <b>idle</b> private <b>capital</b> via a ‘European Future Fund’. This fund would focus on green investment, as well as training, R&D and transport. The Fund would be supported by bonds whose interest would be covered by the proposed Financial Transactions tax. While questions remain over how the initial finance can be raised and the plan’s short term results, this new ‘Marshall Plan’ for Europe shows that there may yet be alternatives to austerity...|$|R
60|$|When a {{great nation}} has {{equipped}} itself to produce far more than it can, under the present division of the product, consume, it seeks other markets for its surplus products. When a second nation finds itself similarly circumstanced, competition for these other markets naturally follows. With {{the advent of a}} third, a fourth, a fifth, and of divers other nations, the question of the disposal of surplus products grows serious. And with each of these nations possessing, over and beyond its active capital, great and growing masses of <b>idle</b> <b>capital,</b> and when the very foreign markets for which they are competing are beginning to produce similar wares for themselves, the question passes the serious stage and becomes critical.|$|E
60|$|A great {{conflict}} for national existence made necessary, for temporary purposes, {{the raising of}} {{large sums of money}} from whatever source attainable. It made it necessary, in the wisdom of Congress--and I do not doubt their wisdom in the premises, regarding the necessity of the times--to devise a system of national currency which it proved to be impossible to keep {{on a par with the}} recognized currency of the civilized world. This begot a spirit of speculation involving an extravagance and luxury not required for the happiness or prosperity of a people, and involving, both directly and indirectly, foreign indebtedness. The currency, being of fluctuating value, and therefore unsafe to hold for legitimate transactions requiring money, became a subject of speculation within itself. These two causes, however, have involved us in a foreign indebtedness, contracted in good faith by borrower and lender, which should be paid in coin, and according to the bond agreed upon when the debt was contracted--gold or its equivalent. The good faith of the Government can not be violated toward creditors without national disgrace. But our commerce should be encouraged; American shipbuilding and carrying capacity increased; foreign markets sought for products of the soil and manufactories, to the end that we may be able to pay these debts. Where a new market can be created for the sale of our products, either of the soil, the mine, or the manufactory, a new means is discovered of utilizing our <b>idle</b> <b>capital</b> and labor to the advantage of the whole people. But, in my judgment, the first step toward accomplishing this object is to secure a currency of fixed, stable value; a currency good wherever civilization reigns; one which, if it becomes superabundant with one people, will find a market with some other; a currency which has as its basis the labor necessary to produce it, which will give to it its value. Gold and silver are now the recognized medium of exchange the civilized world over, and to this we should return with the least practicable delay. In view of the pledges of the American Congress when our present legal-tender system was adopted, and debt contracted, there should be no delay--certainly no unnecessary delay--in fixing by legislation a method by which we will return to specie. To the accomplishment of this end I invite your special attention. I believe firmly that there can be no prosperous and permanent revival of business and industries until a policy is adopted--with legislation to carry it out--looking to a return to a specie basis. It is easy to conceive that the debtor and speculative classes may think it of value to them to make so-called money abundant until they can throw a portion of their burdens upon others. But even these, I believe, would be disappointed in the result if a course should be pursued which will keep in doubt the value of the legal-tender medium of exchange. A revival of productive industry is needed by all classes; by none more than the holders of property, of whatever sort, with debts to liquidate from realization upon its sale. But admitting that these two classes of citizens are to be benefited by expansion, would it be honest to give it? Would not the general loss be too great to justify such relief? Would it not be just as honest and prudent to authorize each debtor to issue his own legal-tenders to the extent of his liabilities? Than to do this, would it not be safer, for fear of overissues by unscrupulous creditors, to say that all debt obligations are obliterated in the United States, and now we commence anew, each possessing all he has at the time free from incumbrance? These propositions are too absurd to be entertained for a moment by thinking or honest people. Yet every delay in preparation for final resumption partakes of this dishonesty, and is only less in degree as the hope is held out that a convenient season will at last arrive for the good work of redeeming our pledges to commence. It will never come, in my opinion, except by positive action by Congress, or by national disasters which will destroy, for a time at least, the credit of the individual and the State at large. A sound currency might be reached by total bankruptcy and discredit of the integrity of the nation and of individuals. I believe it is in the power of Congress at this session to devise such legislation as will renew confidence, revive all the industries, start us on a career of prosperity to last for many years and to save the credit of the nation and of the people. Steps toward the return to a specie basis are the great requisites to this devoutly to be sought for end. There are others which I may touch upon hereafter.|$|E

5000|$|Its banking {{philosophy}} may {{be inferred}} from {{an excerpt from the}} annual report for 1852 — “the function of a great banking institution is not so much to start new branches of industry [...] [...] [...], as to induce the capitalists of the country, by recommendations based on exhaustive investigations, to turn <b>idle</b> <b>capital</b> toward such enterprises, which, when properly launched in response to existing requirements, and offering the guarantee of expert management, bid fair to yield reasonable profits.” Industrial in purpose, current account business was secondary, and deposits were received only on condition of three, six and 12 months' notice being given for their withdrawal, and then only at a low rate of interest. The close identification from the first with the prosperous and flourishing Rhineland-Westphalia industry, and the strict adherence to its original purpose, lent strength to the Bankverein to weather the financial crisis of 1857 without the necessity of canceling any of its outstanding credits — a strong factor in extending its influence during succeeding years. One after another it nurtured industrial enterprises within its banking zone, each becoming an added source of strength for the Bankverein.|$|E
50|$|Another {{advantage}} of economic planning from the neoclassical perspective {{is the ability}} to eliminate unemployment (with the exception of frictional unemployment) and business cycles. Since the state is effectively the sole business proprietor and controls banking, it theoretically avoids classic financial frictions and consumer confidence challenges. Also, because the state makes labor compulsory and can run enterprises at a loss, full employment is a theoretical possibility even when capital stocks are too low to justify it in a market system. This was an advantage that the USSR arguably realized by 1930, although critics argue that sometimes certain segments of Soviet labor exhibited zero productivity, meaning that though workers were on employment rolls, they essentially sat <b>idle</b> because of <b>capital</b> deficiencies; i.e., there was employed unemployment.|$|R
50|$|Born in Stockholm, Söderberg {{began his}} {{literary}} {{course at the}} Swedish news daily Svenska Dagbladet, age 20. Six years later his first novel was released, Förvillelser (Delusions, 1895), written {{from the viewpoint of}} a young dandy aimlessly <b>idling</b> in the <b>capital,</b> recklessly squandering money and love. The somber yet reflective and insightful story would prove typical of much of Söderberg's output. Subsequent to the release of Historietter (Anecdotes, 1898), a collection of twenty short stories, his next major work - Martin Bircks Ungdom (Martin Birck's Youth, 1901) - was released. Much like Förvillelser in terms of its vivid environmental depiction and acute perception, it follows the development of a young amateur poet. Söderberg's next novel, by some considered his masterpiece, was Doktor Glas (Doctor Glas, 1905). In a frightful tale of vengeance and passion, Söderberg stays true to his detached yet emotionally poignant writing style.|$|R
40|$|The {{main goal}} of this work is to apply {{the use of a}} dynamic {{distributed}} system tool specialized in processing huge informations data sets. We are going to use MapReduce to perform some mathematical computations on a data storage that contains some accounting information. In particular, we decided to use a Spanish and Portuguese database called Sistema de Análisis de Balances Ibéricos (SABI). This work focuses on the financial database SABI, which is considered as a basic research tool by many Spanish universities and is largely used by private companies to perform market analysis. Although this repository constitutes the main financial information source in Spain, many companies do not properly fill in all the field, leading to an incomplete data panel. In some works, this issue is roughly solved by excluding those rows that belong to companies with missing values or inconsistent data. Nonetheless, this data repository is targeted to engage researchers in analyzing companies’ efficiency, computing ratios like indebtedness, availability of <b>idle</b> resources, or <b>capital</b> costs, among others.

40|$|When {{the present}} war began in September 1939, {{the evils of}} {{inflation}} so typical {{of the first world}} war induced the warring nations to adopt the principle of price control.

40|$|This article {{examines}} the effectiveness of Keynesian policies {{from the perspective of}} Marxian value theory. It starts from a sketch of the economic cycle, whose ultimate cause is identified in the decreasing production of (surplus) value following technological innovations, and argues that the strongest case for Keynesian civilian policies is not the redistribution of a (decreasing) mass of value. Rather, they should spur the production of more value through the state-induced mobilization of <b>idle</b> <b>capital</b> and/or Labor's savings. In this case, they can initially increase profitability and/or wages and/or employment, but they cannot create the conditions for an upturn and boom. Similar conclusions are reached concerning military Keynesian policies. The paper concludes by arguing that Labor should fight for state-induced, Capital-financed public works (and for reforms in general) not from the perspective of Keynesian policies (i. e., as if they were Labor-friendly, effective anticrisis devices), but from the perspective of thoroughly different social relations—that is, relations based on cooperation, equality, and solidarity...|$|E
40|$|We propose an {{optimisation}} {{approach for}} determining the optimal decay factor in time weighted (BRW) simulation. The backtesting of the BRW simulation, which involves different decay factors, together with {{a broad range of}} competing VaR models, has been performed on a sample of seven stock indexes and two commodities: gold and WTI oil. The results obtained show that the BRW simulation with an optimised decay factor relative to the Lopez (1998) size-adjusted function is among the best performing VaR models, second only to the conditional extreme value approach (McNeil & Frey, 2000). The optimised decay factors are sufficiently stable over time, giving economic justification to the optimisation because they do not change over longer time periods. Unlike most of the VaR models tested, in the large majority of cases, the optimised BRW model passes the Basel II criteria but yields significantly lower VaR forecasts than the extreme value approaches, thus resulting in a lower <b>idle</b> <b>capital,</b> i. e. lower costs.

40|$|Mining {{typically}} {{accounts for}} around 5 per cent of Australia's nominal market sector gross domestic product. Long lead times between investment in new capacity in mining {{and the associated}} output response can lead to short term movements in mining multifactor productivity (MFP) unrelated to underlying efficiency. Ongoing depletion of Australia's natural resource base is estimated {{to have had a}} significant adverse effect on long-term mining MFP. Over the longer-term, MFP impacts of resource depletion have been offset by technological advances and improved management practices. An increase in the use of open-cut mining has been a key development, along with a general increase in the scale and automation of mining equipment. An expected rebound in mining MFP from 2008 - 09 onward may be delayed {{as a consequence of the}} decline in world prices for many mineral and energy commodities in mid-to-late 2008. Any temporarily <b>idle</b> <b>capital</b> associated with production cut-backs and mine closures will tend to lower MFP. On the other hand, significantly lower commodity prices may lead mining companies to cut costs, with a positive effect on MFP. Despite the impact of the fall in mining MFP, the sector has made a significant contribution to the strong overall growth in national income so far this decade through a substantial improvement in Australia's terms of trade. The views expressed in this paper are those of the staff involved and do not necessarily reflect those of the Productivity Commission. mining, resource depletion, multifactor productivity...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{composed}} of three chapters. In the first chapter, I show that capital reallocation is highly procyclical, {{in contrast to the}} prediction of existing businesscycle models with firm heterogeneity, where it is highly countercyclical. I argue that endogenizing the price of used capital relative to new solves this puzzle. First I show empirically that in several sectors the price of used investment goods relative to new is procyclical. Then I build a dynamic general equilibrium model with heterogeneous firms facing both aggregate and idiosyncratic productivity shocks. Used capital is an imperfect substitute for new capital because of firm-level capital specificity. In equilibrium both the price of used capital and the volume of reallocation become procyclical. The second chapter studies the link between investment irreversibility and capital utilization. I show that when it is costly to downsize, firms respond to negative transitory profitability shocks by underutilizing their capital stock. In a partial equilibrium setting I derive both analytical and numerical results on the links between the level of irreversibility, the size and persistence of the shocks and the optimal utilization decision. In an industry-equilibrium model with heterogeneous firms and aggregate shocks, I endogenize the resale price of capital as in the first chapter and show that when this price falls, the option value of <b>idle</b> <b>capital</b> rises and the aggregate utilization rate decreases. The third chapter, co-authored with Esther Hauk and Albert Marcet, studies optimal policy in a class of models of endogenous partial information. The economy is hit by multiple shocks and the policy-maker cannot observe their realizations, but only aggregate outcomes. In general the solution to this signal extraction problem cannot be separated from the {{solution to the problem of}} finding the optimal policy and we show how to solve them jointly. We apply the result to a model of optimal fiscal policy with incomplete markets and show that the endogeneity of the signal extraction may lead to highly non-linear optimal policies...|$|E
