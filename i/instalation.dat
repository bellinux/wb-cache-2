40|$|This {{dissertation}} thesis {{consists of}} an investigation where two components join, one of a practical nature, the other theoretical. The practical component results in two artistic proposals, a series of drawing <b>instalations</b> {{and a series of}} cyanotypes, which motivate the development of the theoretical component. The theme which intersects the whole dissertation is set in the construction of personal identity. Since personal identity is based on experiences shared in a certain environment, what I propose to explore is the importance of the other in the constitution of personal identity. This problem is thought through the study of two authors, Paul Ricoeur and Anthony Giddens, and three works: Atlas Mnemosyne by Aby Warburg, Gabinete > Panero by Pedro Saraiva and Pierrot Le Fou by Jean-Luc Godard. The practical component builds an expanded self-portrait based on visual memories from a familiar and day-to-day environment which, at first tends to belong to a single one, ends up revealing itself as the result of multiple others...|$|R

For the attainment of these aims, it is necesary to compute the equivalent electrical resistance of the system and the potential distribution on earth surface when a fault condition occurs. In the last years, we have proposed a numerical approach based on the Boundary Element Method for the earthing analysis in uniform and homogeneous soils. This formulation has been succesfully applied to the analysis of several grounding grids in real electrical <b>instalations.</b> In this paper we present the generalization of this BE formulation for the grounding systems embedded in layered soils {{and the development of a}} CAD system based on it.

When people became careless and not wisely when using those appliancies, it will bring so many negative effects to people’s life.

Electromagnetic radiation is a radiation that aroused from electrical <b>instalations,</b> such as radar, radio, television, and many electrical appliancies. Those negative effects are aroused by the intensity of electrical usage and the positions – closeness between electrical appliancies and people who use it. The higher the intensity, the greater the negative effects. Some errors in positioning electrical appliancies in a building also bring negative effects, even if the usage intensity are pretty low. Things {{we can do to}} reduce the negative effects of electromagnetic radiation is by managing the usage intensity, the positioning, and be wisely about it.
