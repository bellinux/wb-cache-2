40|$|An alpha 1 b-knockout (KO) mouse has {{recently}} {{been shown to have}} markedly reduced pressor responses to phenylephrine and reduced adrenergic receptor (AR) number in the liver, heart and brain. We have now examined the potency of exogenously applied and neuronally released noradrenaline (NA) on segments of isolated tail artery of wild type (WT) and KO mice. In WT mice the CRC to NA was shifted to the right by the high affinity alpha 1 -AR antagonist YM 12617 (pKB 9. 41) but not by the high affinity alpha 2 -AR antagonist <b>delequamine</b> (pKB 6. 02). The EC 50 values for NA in WT (6. 93) and KO (6. 64) were not significantly different. CEC caused a 20 % depression in the maximum response to NA in both WT (EC 50 6. 27) and KO (EC 50 6. 46). Responses to electrical field stimulation (EFS) were transient, returning to baseline within 14 seconds. Responses to low frequency stimulation were significantly smaller in KO (4 - 16 Hz, p < 0. 1). Time to EFS induced maximum response ranged from 2. 5 - 2. 8 sec. WT and 2. 9 - 3. 6 sec in KO (p < 0. 1 for 4 &# 38; 8 Hz). A 4 Hz (10 sec train) reached maximum amplitude at 6. 9 seconds and 9. 15 seconds for WT and KO respectively (p < 0. 1). The slope of the KO response (mv/sec) was reduced at low frequencies (4 - 16 Hz; p < 0. 1). CEC inhibited the responses to EFS in both WT and KO arteries. These results suggest that the alpha 1 b-AR {{may play a role in}} sympathetic neurotransmission...|$|E
