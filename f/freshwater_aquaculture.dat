40|$|Abstract A lot of {{research}} {{has been given to}} the use of copepods in saltwater aquacultures; however there is also a demand for freshwater fish that could also potentially benefit from being fed copepods. Acartia bifilosa is a robust species in regards to their salinity stress and are as such potential candidates to utilize in <b>freshwater</b> <b>aquacultures</b> if they are capable of hatching and surviving for long enough to allow the fish larvae to ingest them. Sediment from Umeå, Sweden, was investigated under the assumption that it contained eggs from A. bifilosa. The sediment was distributed into 6 different salinities (0, 1, 7, 15, 30 & 40 ppt), with the salinity of 7 being the control, where the eggs were allowed to hatch and after approximately 3 days the number of nauplii was counted. The copepods from the sediment turned out to handle all salinities relatively well, with hatching and survival in all 6 salinities, the lowest survival was seen at the extremes (0, 1 and 40 ppt), with hatching success at around 20 - 30 %, and the highest hatching rates were seen in between at approximately 80 - 90 %. To confirm if the copepods in the sediment were truly A. bifilosa, some sediment was used to hatch copepods to use for the identification of potential species in the sediment. Two species turned up in the sediment, being the assumed Acartia bifilosa and Eutymora affinis, another common copepod in the baltic. The distribution of the two species was roughly 1 E. affinis for every 5 A. bifilosa. The results from this study indicate that Acartia bifilosa {{has the potential to be}} used in <b>freshwater</b> <b>aquacultures</b> assuming its nutritional values were acceptable, as it both hatches and survives in fresh water...|$|R

25|$|In {{shellfish}} and algae farms, biofouling species tend {{to block}} nets and cages and ultimately outcompete the farmed species for space and food. Bacterial biofilms start the colonization process by creating microenvironments that more favorable for biofouling species. In the marine environment, biofilms {{could reduce the}} hydrodynamic efficiency of ships and propellers, lead to pipeline blockage and sensor malfunction, and increase the weight of appliances deployed in seawater. Numerous {{studies have shown that}} biofilm can be a reservoir for potentially pathogenic bacteria in <b>freshwater</b> <b>aquaculture.</b> As mentioned previously, biofilms can be difficult to eliminate even when antibiotics or chemicals are used in high doses. The role that biofilm plays as reservoirs of bacterial fish pathogens regarding has not been explored in detail but it certainly deserves to be studied.|$|E

40|$|The {{freshwater}} prawn fishery {{plays an important}} role in the economy of Bangladesh. The fishery is mainly based on the culture of Macrobrachium rosenbergii.

Despite the high prospects of the <b>freshwater</b> prawn <b>aquaculture</b> in Bangladesh, a lot of research is needed to ensure the sustainable development of the capture fishery which forms a key source of prawn aquaculture seed as well as provide a baseline for future appraisals. <b>Freshwater</b> prawn <b>aquaculture</b> in Bangladesh is based on traditional methods with continuous adaptations by the rural fishers. However, numerous constraints to its full development are evident at all stages of its production. Lack of quality brood stock, seed, feeds and poor technical knowledge at farmers level are but some of the impediments challenging the sustainability of this industry.

40|$|Osmoregulation {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{fundamental}} and delicately controlled processes in euryhaline marine species like penaeid shrimp. Here we first report a cDNA encoding for the crustacean cardioactive peptide (CCAP) precursor cloned from the intestine of Pacific white shrimp, Litopenaeus vannamei, a prominent commercial culture species. The CCAP mature peptide (PFCNAFTGC-NH 2) is generated by post-translational processing and found to be highly comparable with its counterparts in insects and other crustaceans. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR reveals that L. vannamei CCAP (Lv-CCAP) mRNA is predominantly expressed in the brain and intestine. However, only the expression level of intestine-derived Lv-CCAP mRNA showed responsiveness to salinity changes in culture. The inducible expressed Lv-CCAP mRNA by transfer to high-salinity condition was continuous, while mRNA expression stimulated by transfer to low-salinity condition was transient. Functionally, the stimulatory effects of CCAP on heart rates in the shrimp cultured in low-and normal-salinity conditions were confirmed. Furthermore, injection of CCAP could up-regulate the freshwater tolerance of shrimp by increasing their survival rates. Our study, as a whole, provides new insights into hormone-regulated crustacean osmostasis and may prove instructive to the inland <b>freshwater</b> penaeid shrimp <b>aquaculture.</b> State of relevance It proves instructive to <b>freshwater</b> shrimp <b>aquaculture.</b> (C) 2015 Elsevier B.
