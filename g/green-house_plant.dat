50|$|Institute of Life Sciences has a broad {{vision of}} {{carrying}} out high-quality multidisciplinaryresearch {{in the area of}} life sciences. The goal is for overall development and betterment of human health,longevity, agriculture and environment. The stated mission of the institution is to work towardsupliftment of the human society and generate skilled human resources for future India. These areachieved by undertaking cutting-edge research using state-of-the-art technologies in the fields of vectorbornediseases such as malaria and filaria, viral infections, cancer biology, allergy and auto-immunedisorders, genetic disorders, and agricultural productivity. Towards this, the institute has establishednecessary infrastructure, including research facilities, genomics and proteomics platforms, flowcytometry, imaging facilities, animal house, <b>green-house,</b> <b>plant</b> tissue culture and zebrafish facilitiesand high performance computing facility etc. with financial support from the Dept. of Biotechnology,Govt. of India.|$|E
40|$|A {{greenhouse}} of semi-circular shape {{was employed}} to study the effect of spectral light response on the stem-cutting propagation of horticultural plants. The number of days taken for the root formation were noted and {{it was observed that}} the stem cuttings showed earlier root formation under a red-tinged greenhouse followed by a blue-tinged greenhouse. The UV-stabilised sheet prolonged the formation of well-formed roots by an additional three days over that for the control system. The study shows that the temperature gradient is not only a minimum at canopy level but also negative throughout in blue cladded greenhouse and a maximum vertical heat flux of zero is noticed. <b>Green-house</b> <b>Plant</b> propagation Solar energy Temperature gradient...|$|E

There were two persons in the room--a young lady, who sat drawing at the round table, and a youth, lying on a couch near the fire, surrounded with books and newspapers, and a pair of crutches near him.

40|$|Extensive {{use of the}} preemergence her-bicide triallate {{over the}} last three decades has {{selected}} for resistant (R) Avena fatua L. populations in several areas of the Unit-ed States and Canada. R plants are also cross-resistant to the unrelated pyrazolium herbicide difenzoquat. We made recipro-cal crosses between inbred R and sus-ceptible (S) lines to determine the genetic basis of triallate resistance. Seeds from parental lines and F 2 populations were treated with soil applications of 0. 275, 0. 55, or 1. 1 kg/ha triallate in the <b>green-house</b> and <b>plant</b> heights recorded after 37 days. Surviving F 2 plants were selfed and the resulting F 3 families were screened with 1. 1 kg/ha triallate. In the F 2 popula-tions, assortment of S and R phenotypes fit a 15 : 1 segregation ratio, suggesting that resistance was controlled by the two independently segregating recessive genes TRR 1 and TRR 2. None of the 912 F 3 progeny from 51 R F 2 individuals was susceptible to triallate treatment, further supporting a two-gene mode of inheri-tance. There was a possible maternal ef-fect on susceptibility at the highest triallate rate tested. Widespread use of herbicides has selected for resistant (R) populations of more than 200 weed species in many agronomic and noncrop situations (Heap 2001). Triallate, a thiocarbamate herbicide used for Avena fatua (wild oat) control, has been used successfully in small grain production fields for more than 25 years. However, A. fatua populations not controlled by field rates of triallate were first documented in 1990 in Alberta (O’Donovan et al. 1994) and have since been confirmed in Mon...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the effect of}} hydric stress on Select sunflower hybrid grown under near-neutral and acid soil conditions. The experiment was conducted in <b>green-house</b> with sunflower <b>plants</b> grown in PVC tubs filled with: near- neutral soil (pH = 6. 2) (I), acid soil (pH = 5. 27) (II) and ferti-lized acid soil [(phosphorus (100 kg/ha), potassium (100 kg/ha) and nitrogen (150 kg/ha) ] (pH = 4. 83) (III). Two watering regimes were used: five replica-tions were watered daily and maintained at 70 % from TSWC (total soil water capacity) (control variant) and five replications were watered once {{at a couple of}} days no more than 40 % from TSWC (hydric stress variant). Sig-nificant decrease of leaf area, volume of root and dry matter accumulation was registered in sunflower plants under drought conditions. These modifications were more obvious under acid soil (albic luvisoil) as compared with near-neutral soil (cambic chernozem soil). The ef-fect of fertilizers applied in acid soil on sunflower growth was positively significant. As a result, the growth of sun-flower plants in this soil, under normal watering condi-tions, was higher than in the near-neutral and acid soils. For all that, under drought conditions, the leaf area, the volume of roots and dry matter accumulation of sun-flower plants in fertilized acid soil significantly decrease as compared with near-neutral soil. Key words: drought, hydric stress, soil water capacity, sun...|$|R
40|$|Em trabalho preliminar foram obtidos 24 isolados fúngicos com propriedades antagônicas a nematóides parasitas de plantas segundo experimentos realizados em laboratório. Para dar continuidade a tal trabalho, tornou-se desejável dispor de metodologia simples e de baixo custo para selecionar aqueles sem capacidade de produção de substâncias fitotóxicas, para serem empregados em experimentos em casa-de-vegetação com fitonematóides. Conseqüentemente, cultivaram-se os fungos em meio líquido e, após filtração, as fases líquidas foram liofilizadas e extraídas com acetato de etila/metanol. Os extratos foram concentrados sob vácuo e dissolvidos em água e solução de sacarose para serem submetidos a testes {{in vitro}} com sementes de alface (Lactuca sativa L.) e com coleóptilos de trigo (Triticum aestivum L.), respectivamente. Vinte e três isolados pertencentes aos gêneros Arthrobotrys, Aspergillus, Coniothyrium, Cunninghamella, Cylindrocarpon, Fusarium, Monacrosporium, Mortierella, Paecilomyces, Penicillium, Sclerotinia, Trichoderma e Verticillium, apresentaram atividade tóxica contra os coleóptilos de trigo. Apenas os isolados de Cylindrocarpon magnusianum (Sacc.) Wollenw., Fusarium moniliforme Shelden, Mortierella sp., Paecilomyces lilacinus (Thom.) Samson e Penicillium sp. apresentaram atividade fitotóxica no teste com sementes de alface. Somente um isolado de F. moniliforme se mostrou inativo em ambos os testes, o que sugere que não seja produtor de fitotoxinas. In a {{previous}} work 24 fungi cultures were selected {{due to their}} antagonic properties to phytonematodes in laboratory experiments. To proceed to further studies, it became desirable to use a simple and inexpensive methodology to identify those fungi able to produce phytotoxic substances, so that only the non phytotoxin producers {{could be used in}} <b>green-house</b> experiments with <b>plant</b> parasite nematodes. Thus, fungi were grown in liquid medium and the resulting mixtures were submitted to filtration. The liquid phases were freeze-dried and extracted with ethyl acetate/methanol. After extracts concentration under vacuum, the remaining substances were dissolved in water and aqueous saccharose solution to be submitted to in vitro assays with lettuce seeds (Lactuca sativa L.) and wheat coleoptile (Triticum aestivum L.), respectively. Twenty three isolates from genera Arthrobotrys, Aspergillus, Coniothyrium, Cunninghamella, Cylindrocarpon, Fusarium, Monacrosporium, Mortierella, Paecilomyces, Penicillium, Sclerotinia, Trichoderma and Verticillium, presented toxic activity against wheat coleoptile, though only isolates of Cylindrocarpon magnusianum (Sacc.) Wollenw., Fusarium moniliforme Shelden, Mortierella sp., Paecilomyces lilacinus (Thom.) Samson and Penicillium sp., presented phytotoxic effects in the lettuce seeds assay. Only one isolate of F. moniliforme was inactive in both assays, what suggests that this fungus is not able to produce phytotoxins...|$|R
