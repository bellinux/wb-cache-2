Power system having good power quality means it has constant sinusoidal voltage with rated frequency and without high frequency noise (flicker or harmonics). In wind power generation, voltage variation is produced due to variations in <b>energy</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> the <b>wind</b> and interruptions during high wind speed. The SMES unit having VSC type converter can fulfil the reactive power <b>of</b> <b>wind</b> generators and improve the power quality by stabilizing voltage [51, 52, 58].

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a {{finite element model}} of an overhead transmission line using so called cable elements which allow reproducing the cable’s nonlinear characteristics accurately employing only a few elements. Aerodynamic damping is considered in the equation of motion by {{taking into account the}} relative velocity between the flow <b>of</b> the <b>wind</b> and the moving structure. The wind flow itself is simulated by wave superposition making necessary assumptions on the lateral correlation between the wind velocities along the cable length. As result from the simulation, the following conclusions can be drawn. The first natural frequency of generally used wide spanning cables lies well below 1 [*]Hz where also most <b>of</b> the <b>energy</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> the <b>wind</b> excitation is to be expected. Aerodynamic damping is significant for the moving cables holding very low structural damping which leads to a suppression of resonant amplification. This is particularly of interest regarding the support reaction which is dominated by the mean value and the so called background response. The latter is mostly influenced by the randomness <b>of</b> the <b>wind</b> flow, especially lateral to the main wind direction...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the impact of}} climate change on the <b>wind</b> energy resource <b>of</b> Ireland using an ensemble of Regional Climate Model (RCM) simulations. The RCM used in this work is the COSMO-CLM Model. The COSMO-CLM model is evaluated by performing simulations of the past Irish climate, driven by ECMWF ERA- 40 data, and comparing the output to observations. Results confirm that {{the output of the}} COSMO-CLM model exhibits reasonable and realistic features as found in the historical wind data record. For the investigation of the influence of the future climate under different climate scenarios, the Max Planck Institute’s GCM, ECHAM 5, is used to drive the COSMO-CLM model. Simulations are run for a control period 1961 - 2000 and future period 2021 - 2060. To add to the number of ensemble members, the control and future simulations were driven by different realisations of the ECHAM 5 data. The future climate was simulated using the IPCC emission scenarios, A 1 B and B 1. Results show a substantial overall increase in the <b>energy</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> the <b>wind</b> for the future winter months and a decrease during the summer months. The projected changes for summer and winter were found to be statistically significant over most of Ireland. The research was undertaken to consolidate, and as a continuation of, similar research using the Rossby Centre’s RCA 3 RCM to investigate the effects of climate change on the future <b>wind</b> energy resource <b>of</b> Ireland. The COSMO-CLM projections outlined in this study agree with the RCA 3 projections, with both showing substantial increases in 60 m wind speed over Ireland during winter and decreases during summer. The agreement of the CLM-COSMO and RCA 3 simulation results increase our confidence in the robustness of the projections...|$|R
40|$|Transient {{collimated}} plasma eruptions in {{the solar}} corona, commonly known as coronal (or X-ray) jets, {{are among the most}} interesting manifestations of solar activity. It has been suggested that these events contribute to the mass and <b>energy</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> the corona and solar wind, but the extent of these contributions remains uncertain. We have recently modeled the formation and evolution of coronal jets using a three-dimensional (3 D) magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) code with thermodynamics in a large spherical domain that includes the solar wind. Our model is coupled to 3 D MHD flux-emergence simulations, i. e, we use boundary conditions provided by such simulations to drive a time-dependent coronal evolution. The model includes parametric coronal heating, radiative losses, and thermal conduction, which enables us to simulate the dynamics and plasma properties of coronal jets in a more realistic manner than done so far. Here we employ these simulations to calculate the amount of mass and energy transported by coronal jets into the outer corona and inner heliosphere. Based on observed jet-occurrence rates, we then estimate the total contribution of coronal jets to the mass and <b>energy</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> the solar <b>wind</b> to (0. 4 - 3. 0) % and (0. 3 - 1. 0) %, respectively. Our results are largely consistent with the few previous rough estimates obtained from observations, supporting the conjecture that coronal jets provide only a small amount of mass and energy to the solar wind. We emphasize, however, that more advanced observations and simulations are needed to substantiate this conjecture...|$|R
40|$|Spatial Decision Support System (SDSS) {{assist in}} {{strategic}} decision-making activities considering {{spatial and temporal}} variables, which help in Regional planning. WEPA is a SDSS designed for assessment <b>of</b> <b>wind</b> potential spatially. A wind energy system transforms the kinetic energy <b>of</b> the <b>wind</b> into mechanical or electrical energy that can be harnessed for practical use. Wind energy can diversify the economies of rural communities, adding to the tax base and providing new types <b>of</b> income. <b>Wind</b> turbines can add {{a new source of}} property value in rural areas that have a hard time attracting new industry. Wind speed is extremely important parameter for assessing the amount <b>of</b> energy a <b>wind</b> turbine can convert to electricity: The <b>energy</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> the <b>wind</b> varies with the cube (the third power) <b>of</b> the average <b>wind</b> speed. Estimation <b>of</b> the <b>wind</b> power potential for a site is the most important requirement for selecting a site for the installation <b>of</b> a <b>wind</b> electric generator and evaluating projects in economic terms. It is based on data <b>of</b> the <b>wind</b> frequency distribution at the site, which are collected from a meteorological mast consisting <b>of</b> <b>wind</b> anemometer and a wind vane and spatial parameters (like area available for setting up wind farm, landscape, etc.). The wind resource is governed by the climatology of the region concerned and has large variability with reference to space (spatial expanse) and time (season) at any fixed location. Hence the need to conduct wind resource surveys and spatial analysis constitute vital components in programs for exploiting wind energy. SDSS for assessing <b>wind</b> potential <b>of</b> a region / location is designed with user friendly GUI’s (Graphic User Interface) using VB as front end with MS Access database (backend). Validation and pilot testing of WEPA SDSS has been done with the data collected for 45 locations in Karnataka based on primary data at selected locations and data collected from the meteorological observatories of the India Meteorological Department (IMD). Wind energy and its characteristics have been analysed for these locations to generate user-friendly reports and spatial maps. Energy Pattern Factor (EPF) and Power Densities are computed for sites with hourly wind data. With the knowledge of EPF and mean wind speed, mean power density is computed for the locations with only monthly data. Wind energy conversion systems would be most effective in these locations during May to August. The analyses show that coastal and dry arid zones in Karnataka have good wind potential, which if exploited would help local industries, coconut and areca plantations, and agriculture. Pre-monsoon availability <b>of</b> <b>wind</b> energy would help in irrigating these orchards, making wind energy a desirable alternative...|$|R
40|$|The {{method of}} Regional Climate Modelling (RCM) was {{employed}} to assess the impacts of a warming climate on the mid- 21 st-century climate of Ireland. The RCM simulations were run at high spatial resolution, up to 4 km, thus allowing a better evaluation of the local effects of climate change. Simulations were run for a reference period 1981 – 2000 and future period 2041 – 2060. Differences between the two periods provide a measure of climate change. To {{address the issue of}} uncertainty, a multi-model ensemble approach was employed. Specifically, the future climate of Ireland was simulated using three different RCMs, driven by four Global Climate Models (GCMs). To account for the uncertainty in future emissions, a number of SRES (B 1, A 1 B, A 2) and RCP (4. 5, 8. 5) emission scenarios were used to simulate the future climate. Through the ensemble approach, the uncertainty in the RCM projections can be partially quantified, thus providing a measure of confidence in the predictions. In addition, likelihood values can be assigned to the projections. The RCMs used in this work are the COnsortium for Small-scale MOdeling–Climate Limited-area Modelling (COSMO-CLM, versions 3 and 4) model and the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. The GCMs used are the Max Planck Institute’s ECHAM 5, the UK Met Office’s HadGEM 2 -ES, the CGCM 3. 1 model from the Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and the EC-Earth consortium GCM. The projections for mid-century indicate an increase of 1 – 1. 6 °C in mean annual temperatures, with the largest increases seen in the east of the country. Warming is enhanced for the extremes (i. e. hot or cold days), with the warmest 5 % of daily maximum summer temperatures projected to increase by 0. 7 – 2. 6 °C. The coldest 5 % of night-time temperatures in winter are projected to rise by 1. 1 – 3. 1 °C. Averaged over the whole country, the number of frost days is projected to decrease by over 50 %. The projections indicate an average increase in the length of the growing season of over 35 days per year. Results show significant projected decreases in mean annual, spring and summer precipitation amounts by mid-century. The projected decreases are largest for summer, with 'likely' reductions ranging from 0 % to 20 %. The frequencies of heavy precipitation events show notable increases (approximately 20 %) during the winter and autumn months. The number of extended dry periods is projected to increase substantially during autumn and summer. Regional variations of projected precipitation change remain statistically elusive. The <b>energy</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> the <b>wind</b> is projected to significantly decrease for the future spring, summer and autumn months. Projected increases for winter were found to be statistically insignificant. The projected decreases were largest for summer, with 'likely' values ranging from 3 % to 15 %. Results suggest that the tracks of intense storms are projected to extend further south over Ireland relative to those in the reference simulation. As extreme storm events are rare, the storm-tracking research needs to be extended. Future work will focus on analysing a larger ensemble, thus allowing a robust statistical analysis of extreme storm track projections...|$|R

40|$|Dichromate {{oxidation}} is {{a simple}} technique that {{is often used to}} estimate the <b>energy</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> eggs in studies of marine invertebrate life histories (1). We used this method to measure the <b>energy</b> <b>contents</b> <b>of</b> the eggs of 12 species of marine annelids. In combination with measures of egg ash-free dry weight (AFDW), these data yielded estimates of AFDW-specific energy density that were mostly lower than the average weight-specific energy density of carbohydrates. This seemed unlikely to be correct, as invertebrate eggs typically contain little carbohydrate and instead are composed primarily of energy-dense protein and lipid (1, 2). After validating our methods (by using them to estimate <b>energy</b> <b>content</b> and AFDW <b>of</b> the eggs of a previously studied echinoderm) and reexamining published data on the <b>energy</b> <b>contents</b> <b>of</b> echinoderm eggs, we conclude that dichromate oxidation often underestimates the <b>energy</b> <b>contents</b> <b>of</b> small eggs of marine invertebrates.

The anaerobic digestion experiment was carried out in a semi-continuous tubular horizontal reactor (1. 13 m 3) and lasted 6 months to take into account all the possible changes in feedstock composition during different periods of the year. Throughout the experiment the feedstock was characterized by measuring the total solid content, volatile solid content and higher heating value. The composition and <b>energy</b> <b>contents</b> <b>of</b> the biogas produced and the residue sludge were also evaluated. The results of the study demonstrate that fruit and vegetable wastes lead to high biogas yields and high methane contents. In particular, an average biogas yield of 0. 80 Nm 3 /kgvs and a specific methane yield of 0. 45 Nm 3 /kgvs were obtained.
