At temperatures around 2-3 gigakelvins (GK) and short process time of a few seconds (this requires an <b>explosive</b> <b>process)</b> photodisintegration of the pre-existing nuclei will remain small, just enough to produce the required tiny abundances of p-nuclei. This is called γ-process because the photodisintegration proceeds by nuclear reactions of the types (γ,n), (γ,α) and (γ,p), which are caused by highly energetic photons (Gamma rays).|$|E
50|$|Basement rocks {{consist of}} Ordovician clastic sediments {{consisting}} of phyllite with some sandstone interbedding. At about 13.8 Ma, the dome was extruded. During the <b>explosive</b> <b>process,</b> the Venus breccia formed when the ascending dacite magma reacted with groundwater {{to produce a}} phreatic eruption. The released pressure allowed {{the formation of the}} Caracoles tuff ring on top of the breccia. The magma then extruded outward from a dike to form a volcanic dome over the tuff. The dacite dome is 1700 m by 1200 m at the surface and narrows down to the 100 m wide dike at depth. Hydrothermal circulation and fracturing soon followed, altering the dacite and depositing ore minerals and gangue in the veins.|$|E

The Granger-Johansen representation shows that this results in processes with two common features: a random walk and an explosively growing process. Co-integrating and co-explosive vectors can be found which eliminate these common factors. Likelihood ratio tests for linear restrictions on the co-explosive vectors are derived. As an empirical illustration the method is applied to data from the extreme Yugoslavian hyper-inflation of the 1990 s.

The eigenvalues of Johansen’s eigenvalue problem are shown {{to have the same}} consistency rates accross the parameter space. The test statistic is shown to have the usual asymptotic distribution as long as the possibilities of additional unit roots and of singular explosiveness are ruled out. To prove the results the convergence of stochastic integrals with respect to singular <b>explosive</b> <b>processes</b> is considered. ...|$|R

Simulations show that double asymptotics deliver a good approximation to the finite sample distribution, with both finite sample and asymptotic distributions showing sensitivity to initial conditions.
