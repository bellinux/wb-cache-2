500|$|Judge Sheindlin’s third {{book for}} adults, “Keep It Simple, Stupid: You’re Smarter Than You Look,” {{also on the}} New York Times best seller list, {{published}} in 2000, shares her wisdom and opinions on solving everyday family squabbles. Her career as an author began prior to her courtroom series. One of her more recent books, which hit shelves on April 25, 2013, was inspired by one of her advisory catch phrases encouraging romantic partners to be judicious with regards to domestic partnerships. This catch phrase is: “There is no Court of People Just Living Together.” In September 2014, Sheindlin celebrated the opening of her 19th season by giving out <b>her</b> <b>latest</b> <b>book,</b> [...] "What Would Judy Say: Be the Hero of Your Own Story," [...] for free.

500|$|After {{watching}} someone {{play the}} game for about two-and-a-half hours, Lawrence eventually retracted her earlier statements. She added {{that she had been}} told the game was similar to pornography, and noted that she [...] "has seen episodes of Lost that are more sexually explicit." [...] In the interim, largely as a reaction from an offended gaming community, <b>her</b> <b>latest</b> <b>book</b> attracted many customer reviews on Amazon which rated it one star out of five. Many of these reviews satirically noted that they had not read her book, but heard from someone else that the book was bad, and thus voted low. Mass Effect was also banned in Singapore for a short time before it was lifted with an M18 rating. Censors in the country said that a scene with an alien and human female caressing was the main reason why the game was not allowed to be sold in video game stores.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile [...] Mitford had {{completed}} <b>her</b> <b>latest</b> <b>book,</b> [...] Voltaire in Love, {{an account of}} the love affair between Voltaire and the Marquise du Châtelet. [...] She considered it her first truly grown-up work, and her best. Published in 1957, it sold well, was taken seriously by the critics and [...] was warmly praised by Mitford's friends. Its writing had been hampered by painful headaches arising from her apparently failing eyesight and [...] worries that she might be going blind. The problem was resolved after a visit to the ophthalmic surgeon Patrick Trevor-Roper, who gave her new spectacles: [...] "It is heavenly {{to be able to read}} for a long time on end & now I see how handicapped I was when doing Voltaire". She then returned to writing [...] fiction, with Don't Tell Alfred, in which she revived Fanny Wincham, the narrator of The Pursuit of Love and Love in a Cold Climate, and placed her in a Paris setting as wife of the British ambassador. Several characters familiar from the earlier novels appear in minor roles. The book, published in October 1960, was popular with the public, but received indifferent reviews. Some of Mitford's friends disliked it, and she decided she would write no more fiction.|$|E

2500|$|Hirsi Ali, {{a former}} devout Muslim who {{abandoned}} her faith {{and became an}} atheist, has been a vocal critic of Islam. In 2004, she collaborated on a short movie with Theo van Gogh, entitled Submission, a film depicting oppression of women under fundamentalist Islamic law, critical of the Islamic canon itself. The film sparked controversy and death threats. Van Gogh was murdered later that year by Mohammed Bouyeri, a Moroccan-Dutch Islamic terrorist. Hirsi Ali maintains that [...] "Islam is part religion, and part a political-military doctrine, the part that is a political doctrine contains a world view, a system of laws and a moral code that is totally incompatible with our constitution, our laws, and our way of life." [...] Having previously argued that Islam was beyond reform, in <b>her</b> <b>latest</b> <b>book</b> Heretic (2015) she calls for a reformation of Islam by defeating the Islamists and supporting reformist Muslims.|$|E
